    "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Melbourne, AU",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine recently the hubman Lab podcast\nhosted a live event at the plenary\ntheater in Melbourne Australia the event\nwas called the brain body contract and\nfeatured a lecture followed by a\nquestion and answer session with the\naudience we wanted to make the question\nand answer session available to everyone\nregardless if you could attend so what\nfollows is the question and answer\nsession from the plenary theater in\nMelbourne Australia I also would like to\nthank the sponsors for the event they\nare eight sleep and ag1 eight sleep\nmakes Smart mattress covers with cooling\nHeating and sleep tracking capacity now\none of the key aspects to getting a\ngreat night's sleep is to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nand that's because in order to fall and\nstay deeply asleep your body temperature\nactually has to drop by about 1 to 3°\nand in order to wake up in the morning\nfeeling refreshed your body temperature\nactually has to increase by about 1 to\n3° eight sleep makes it extremely easy\nto control the temperature of your\nsleeping environment at the beginning\nmiddle and throughout the night and when\nyou wake up in the morning I've been\nsleeping on an eight Sleep mattress\ncover for nearly 3 years now and it has\ndramatically improved my sleep if you'd\nlike to try eightsleep you can go to\n8sleep.com\nhuberman to save $150 off their pod 3\ncover eights sleep currently ships to\nthe USA Canada UK select countries in\nthe EU and Australia again that's\n8sleep.com / huberman the other live\nevent sponsor ag1 is a vitamin mineral\nprobiotic drink that also contains\nadaptogens and other critical\nmicronutrients I've been taking ag1\ndaily since 2012 so I'm delighted that\nthey decided to sponsor the live event\nthe reason I started taking it and the\nreason I still take it every day once or\ntwice a day is that it ensures that I\nmeet all of my quotas for vitamins and\nminerals and it ensures that I get\nenough Prebiotic and probiotic to\nsupport gut health now of course I\nstrive to consume healthy whole foods\nfor the majority of my nutritional\nintake every single day but there are a\nnumber of things in ag1 including\nspecific micronutrients that are hard to\nget from Whole Foods or at least in\nsufficient quantities so ag1 allows me\nto get the vitamins and minerals that I\nneed probiotics prebiotics the\nadaptogens and critical micronutrients\nto try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman\nand you'll get a year supply of vitamin\nD3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman and now for the question and\nanswer session from Melbourne\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nAustralia hey Dr hman uh some some of\nyour listeners are in or approaching our\n50s okay\nsame um and are thinking of doing all we\ncan to prevent dementia same do you have\nany additional thoughts or protocols or\nresearch we could focus on yes so\num for the next two and a half hours no\nI'm kidding the uh I'm not known for\nbeing\nsuccinct I didn't go over too much\nearlier so okay so uh ground truths so\nlet's start with ground truths and then\nlet's move to um emerging let's maybe\nget to a little bit of speculation let's\navoid conjecture um ground\ntruths um blood circulation is good for\nthe brain perhaps most important for the\nbrain so anything that is good for\ncardiovascular health is going to be\ngood for brain health it's not the only\nthing but that's true we know this so\nyou hear these days a lot about Zone 2\ncardio I don't know who gets credit for\nthat petera talks a lot about it I talk\na lot about it none of us invented the\nnotion but you know 150 probably more\nlike 180 to 200 minutes of so-called\nZone 2 cardio per week is good numbers\nto shoot for some of us get more some of\nus less what is Zone 2 cardio Zone 2\ncardio is um cardiovascular exercise\ncould be running could be swimming could\nbe walking depending on your level of\nFitness which you can just barely\nmaintain a conversation were you to push\nany harder or faster you wouldn't be\nable to complete your sentences with\nmuch ease okay so is this zone two\ncardio for me no but if I were to jog\nand try and have a conversation at some\npoint I would have a little bit of a\nhard time that's Zone 2 cardio um so we\nknow that's true why uh well it seems to\ndo a number of things at the level of\nrelease of growth factors brain dve\nneutrophic Factor at the level of um\ndifferent let's call them I realize the\nimmunologists are going to like roll\ntheir eyes but um anti-inflam flammatory\ncyto kindes and things of that sort you\nalso have inflammatory cyto kindes um\nand things of that sort um it does seem\nthat increasing blood flow in and\nthrough the brain is important for brain\nhealth which is not all that surprising\nthere are species of animals that spend\npart of their life swimming about and\nthen when they stop um a good port and\nstick to a rock or something good\nportion of the nervous system actually\ndegenerates but neurod\ndegeneration and dementia are not\nnecessar neily the same thing and this\nis something that we don't often hear\nabout um the age related decline in\nmemory capacity in particular working\nmemory can be related to reductions in\ndopamine Transmission in the brain so\nthings that increase the catacol amines\nthat we talked about earlier um this\ncould be pharmacology of course but it\ndoesn't have to be pharmacology it could\nbe um anything that increases the\ncamines um and we talk about this on the\npodcast we have zeroc cost protocols\nthat you don't have have to sign up for\nyou can just go to our website and go to\ndopamine regulation and it will list out\nways to increase the catac colomines\nthrough zero cost and very lowc cost\nways are known to improve working memory\nworking memory of course the capacity to\nmaintain a string of numbers or\ninformation for sake of kind of\nimmediate goals but not information\nthat's passed to longer term memory so\nthat's that's different than neurod\ndegeneration that's simply reductions in\nthe amount of neuromodulators like\ndopamine being deployed as we get older\nso modul modulating dopamine through\nhealthy ideally uh\nmeans but I do think we are going to see\nan increase in the use of selective\npharmacology for this purpose and here\nI'm not recommending anyone do drugs or\ntake drugs prescription or\notherwise but it does seem that um\ncertain compounds like nicotine believe\nit or not um even though it increases\nvasil constriction and blood pressure um\nCan offs set some of the age related\nreductions in dopaminergic and coleric\naceto Coline coleric\ntransmission um and you know you don't\nwant to smoke Vape dip or snuff I'm not\neven recommending people take Zin\npatches but I think um there is some use\ncases for uh nicotine provided you're\ndoing it with the you know a your\nphysician knows and you're not getting\ninto blood pressure dangerous blood\npressure range or supplementation with\ncholine donors and things of that sort\nto increase acetylcholine and dopamine\nsome people are starting to take things\nlike modafanil and adol in older age um\nbut keep in mind these are not modaal\nbut adderal liant Etc these are\namphetamines they're amphetamines so I'm\nnot recommending this but I think that's\nwhere we're headed I think you're going\nto see a number of different cognitive\nenhancers that are used to offset some\nage related um uh cognitive decline AKA\ndementia now in terms of um so we're\ngoing Zone 2 cardio to like prescription\ndrugs we're kind of bracketing here and\nthen behavioral protocols that can\nincrease neuromodulators such as the\ncatac colomines now in terms of um other\nthings that can perhaps decrease the\nlikelihood of Alzheimer's and other\nforms of dementia as it relates to\nneurod\ndegeneration um currently there are a\nlot of do not don't hit your head too\nhard if you hit it really hard don't hit\nit again hard um the so-call two hit\nmodel literally um you know and and we\nthink of football or I guess rugby\nthat's a sport you guys play down here\nwhere they use the head as a battering\nram um I've seen this right some big\nnecks on those kids and then it boom and\nthey yeah but the problem is not\nnecessarily just rugby or American\nfootball um or a I was told that someone\ntold me I had to shout out an Australian\nfootball team and I know it's a setup so\nI'm not going to do it they're like when\nyou're in Melbourne tomorrow you got to\nsay that your favorite team is blank and\nI'm like this feels really dangerous um\nso I'm not going to do it um I'm not\ngoing to do it but what's\nthat do it I can't remember the name of\nthe team\nsorry um but I watched the document\nwhat's\nthat um but I still don't understand the\nrugby thing they do they use the guy's\nhead as or G's head as a battering\nram cuz I they used to play you see\noutside the my lab we had this big field\nand my Bulldog loved watching he was\nlike this this sport makes sense but um\nthey were just like run and then the I I\nnever understood it but anyway what's\nthat got it I need a translator\nsorry so I need a translator um but I\nlove the\nenthusiasm um yeah so we think about um\nhead injuries and brain injuries mostly\nin the context of sport but that's not\nwhere most the head injuries occur most\nof them occur construction workers car\naccidents TBI things of that sort um\nthere's some interesting data on\nhyperbaric chambers this is getting\nreally into the you know kind of high\nlevel stuff here meaning most people\ndon't have access to them I I look\nforward to learning more these are\nplaying with different concentrations of\noxygen in a little micro environment for\ntraumatic brain injury um and neurod\ndeener ation I mean do I think in 5\nyears that everyone's going to be\nsitting in hyperbaric chambers order to\noffset neuron loss probably not I think\nit's not coste effective but um I will\nsay that most of the things that are\ngood for the body are good for the brain\num keeping kind of anything that plaques\nthe arteries capillaries and veins of\nthe brain because it's so heavily\nvascularized um minimal and and minding\nthose\nneuromodulators um obviously drugs of\nabuse like methamphetamine can deplete\ndopamine neurons the data on MDMA by the\nway I don't know there's drug\nenforcement in the room um the data you\nknow where they have most of the safety\ndata or lack of safety data in some\ncases on MDMA keep in mind MDMA ecstasy\nis methylene dioxy methampetamine\nmethamphetamine we know causes\nneurodegeneration no question it also\ncauses bad teeth do you know how do you\nknow how turns people into mouth\nbreathers dry mouth and the teeth\ndegenerate yeah we have an episode on\noral health coming out this this is real\nthat's actually why the teeth\ndegenerates from excessive um dry and it\nlimit saliva production saliva is very\nimportant for remineralization of the\nteeth they shout out to the dentist in\nthe house\nso the\nthe the thing about MDMA is interesting\nbecause it turns out that MDMA because\nit also it increases dopamine just as\nmethamphetamine does remember MDMA\nmethylene dioxy methamphetamine but also\nhuge increases in serotonin seem to be\nmost most of the effect of MDMA the kind\nof empathogenic effect um there was a\nstudy done of um people from the LDS\nlatterday Saints sometimes referred to\nas Mormons um why was a study on MDMA\ndone with people from the LDS community\nand I don't want to imply that everyone\nfrom the LDS Community does MDMA but why\nthey're very interesting um test\npopulation because they don't do other\ndrugs but for some reason dma is not on\nthe no fly list so there's is it's a\nbeautiful paper um in which they took\npeople who had only done as any drug not\neven taking caffeine right either once\nor semi frequent or very frequent use of\nMDMA and they did a bunch of cognitive\ntesting and there were some attention\nissues when people had taken over what\nwas a couple hundred doses of of MDMA at\nthe 80 milligram dose or more but\ndoesn't seem to be much neurod\ndegeneration which is not to say that\nit's all safe there is an abuse and\naddictive potential there the biggest\nissue seems to be contamination of\nbatches if we have a feny issue in the\nUS I I I don't know if it's happening\ndown here as well very concerning okay\nso the point here is that I think very\nsoon you're going to hear about drugs\nprescription drugs and supplements to\naugment the release of neuromodulators\nnot for sake of empathogenic states or\npsychedelic States but to try and keep\nthose dopaminergic neurons online to\noffset dementia because that's what the\nquestion is about in fact there's a\nNobel prize winning neuroscientist at\nColumbia University whose name I won't\ntell you or maybe I will who when I went\nto visit his office chewed no fewer than\nfive pieces of Nicorette in the course\nof a half an hour and I'm like what's\ngoing on he got a Nobel Prize but this\nlooks kind of pathologic and I said why\nand he said well the nicotine is to\noffset age related loss of dopaminergic\nand coleric neurons I thought really\nhe's like yeah when I quit smoking\nbecause I want lung cancer but this is\nhim this is anic data I'm not sugesting\nyou do this I think there are a number\nof things that we can do but protect\nthose neuromodulators keep perfusion\nthat is blood flow to the brain strong\nthere's a a case for cardiovascular\nexercise and it does seem it really does\nseem that exercise that engages the\nneuromuscular connections more than\ncardiovascular exercise so not just\nresistance training but anything that\ninvol involves coordinated bodily\ntraining learning new physical skills\nDance Etc really does seem to offset\nsome of the loss of cognitive fun\nfunctioning in adults so it's kind of\ninteresting that physical exercise is\ngreat for cognition and probably\ncognition may or may not help physical\nability but\none probably can imagine why there's a\nbidirectional relationship there your\nnervous system doesn't really\ndistinguish between physical and\ncognitive it's all working as a bunch of\nfunctional units I could go on and on\nabout this but um hopefully that um at\nleast gets your um the gears turning\naround some things that perhaps you've\nheard about and some things that you\nhaven't and we'll do an episode on\ndementia and offsetting dementia in\norder to get into some of the fine\ndetails\nokay can we increase our willpower just\nlike training a muscle group with your\nresearch into the amcc O I'm so glad\nthat you mentioned the amcc I think of\nall the new areas of Neuroscience\nresearch um that are out there I think\nthe anterior mid singulate cortex is one\nof the most\ninteresting um structures and and areas\nof research nowadays you know I think I\nif I have my way then not only will most\npeople have heard of dopamine and the\namydala I guess you need a Star Wars\ncharacter named after your brain part um\nisn't there one right I only saw the\nfirst three I'm of that generation but\nisn't there a Amidala or something yeah\nright don't leave me hang in here is\nthere or not if I'm wrong just say no\nokay anyway the amydala\num thanks the um the amydala is a brain\nstructure that is involved in threat\ndetect ction and Novelty detection not\njust threats the anterior mid singulate\ncortex is an area of the brain that we\nknow is activated well let me tell you\nthe best experiment the best experiment\nwas done in my opinion by a neurosurgeon\nat Stanford Joe pery uh he's probing\naround in people's brains they got a\nlittle piece of skull missing he's\nstimulating in the brain he's asking\nthem questions how do you feel what's\ngoing on how do you feel what's going on\nand he's got this electrode in the\nanterior mid singulate cortex\nand the patient says I feel like\nsomething really bad's going to happen\nlike a storm's coming it's like okay\nwell we can stop stimulating he's like\nno I'm going into the storm like oh\nthat's interesting stimulate a little\nbit further back just by a millimeter or\nso completely different subjective\nexperience for the patient that's\ninteresting get a different patient in\nthere map to the enter mid singulate\ncortex\nstimulate and the person says I like I'm\ngoing to get out of my chair and I'm\ngoing to do something hard wild right\nthis is prior to any knowledge of what\nthe interior mid singulate cortex is\ndoing make a long story short people who\nsuccessfully overcome a physical\nchallenge a cognitive challenge that\nlearn a new skill that um successful\ndieters I don't really like that term um\ntheir interor mid signate cortex grows\nor becomes more active under conditions\nthat challenge the inter mid singulate\ncortex so this brain region seems to be\nthe the brain region that puts us in a\nforward Center of mass physically and\nsort of cognitively and emotionally I\noften like to think that you know the\nnervous system as sophisticated as it is\nand psychology as sophisticated as it is\nas it is excuse me can be bined into\nkind of three categories things that we\nlike to eat or don't like to eat or can\nkind of be bended into yum yuck or me\nthat's kind of what the the nervous\nsystem has to do because ultimately you\nhave to decide do I want to go toward it\nso-call repetitive Behavior do I want to\nget away from it do nothing people were\neither like yum or some cases\nyum yuck or in some cases like or like\nme right yum y me yum yum me this is the\nthe sort of three tributaries that we\nhave the option of moving down not\nmoving down or moving away from so the\nenter mid singulate cortex because it\nhas inputs from so many different areas\nand outputs to so many different areas\nit can access circuits related to\ndopamine norepinephrine it can access\ncircuits related to memory and context\nit's a hub it's a hub that by All Views\nthrough all lenses of the existing\nresearch suggests that when we anytime\nwe do something truly challenging in\nparticular things that we do not enjoy\nthis is key\nthe an mid singulate cortex undergo some\nsort of\nplasticity everything's in the research\ndata now point to the idea that the\ninter mid singulate cortex is the seat\nof so-called willpower which is linked\nto Concepts like tenacity or grit and\nEtc and what I love about this research\nis that it comes from a bunch of\ndifferent areas human brain Imaging\nbrain\nstimulation\nEtc here's what I don't like about the\nreality but that we all need to accept\nwhich is that the anterior mid singulate\ncortex is modifiable by experience by\nleaning into challenges at any stage of\nlife that's great we talked about that\nearlier plasticity but lest we\nforget plasticity goes in the other\ndirection too it seems that when we\ndon't engage in challenges that the an\nmid singulate cortex it doesn't atrophy\nbut it undergoes sort of a downshift in\nactivation\nnow here's what's really really\ninteresting in relates to the previous\nquestion the anter mid singulate cortex\nseems to be especially active at\nBaseline and available for plasticity in\nwhat are called superagers superagers\nyou know we've all heard of blue zones\nthe superagers are these people who they\ndon't just exist in blue zones they're\nspread around the world these are people\nthat seem at least by cognitive measures\nand other physiological measures of the\nbody seem to age extremely slowly so\nthey shouldn't really be called\nsuperagers right they should be called\nsuper non aers anyway the anid singulate\ncortex seems to be hyperactive in these\nsuperagers as they're called and so it\nseems that not only do they maintain\ncognitive function later in life but\nthat seems to be related to their\nregular engagement in challenging things\nso remember for so many years years we\nheard okay like nuns don't get dementia\nand then there's all sorts of things you\ncan imagine could be related to that and\nthen we're thinking oh maybe it's\ncrossword puzzles maybe it's crossword\npuzzles maybe it's hanging out with\nother people maybe and you know and then\nyou know that person down the street and\nshe cycling on the weekends like crazy\nand she's 90 and she looks like she's 50\nand she's sharp as attack it's probably\nleaning into Challenge on a regular\nbasis leaning into Challenge on a\nregular basis as opposed to one specific\ncognitive or physical thing which means\nthat if you love cycling or you love the\ncold plunge or you love a certain form\nof exercise it's probably not doing that\nmuch for your anterior mid singulate\ncortex but these super agers also live\nlonger and so there is this notion that\nbecause the anterior mid singulate\ncortex has connectivity to a lot of\nareas of the brain and body that it is\nsomehow linked to the will to live and\nthis is being examined now in so-called\nterminal cancer patients\nso-called you you know terminal cases I\ndon't like the language because there\nare these amazing instances and\nPhysicians and oncologists have known\nthis for a long time that when people\ndecide they're going to fight cancer\nthey don't always win that fight\nunfortunately but often times it's the\npeople who insist on fighting it\npsychologically that they won't give in\nthat end up still living more months\nmore years and in some cases putting the\ncancer into remission with of course\nother tools right I'm not saying you\nshouldn't use other tools to combat\ncancer it's a very interesting structure\nrelates to the question on dementia\nhopefully that was uh informative Julian\nthank you how would you recommend shift\nworkers minimize the effects of\ndisruption to their circadian rhythm oh\nthis is so important you know why\nbecause like right now 92 uh 9:40 p.m.\nwe're kind of doing shift work right now\nmost people are on a shift work schedule\nnow in the world this is true we think\nof shift workers as only the people who\nare up in the middle of the night\nsleeping during the day but most people\nare doing shift work the criteria for\nshift work is at least a 2hour varant at\nleast in the US a two-hour variance in\nthe sleep wake cycle more than three\nnights a week anyone here go to sleep\nevery night same time wake up every\nmorning the same time never stay up\nlater than that more than two nights a\nweek okay most people are doing shift\nwork nowadays they're just on their\nphone or they're on their computer and\nI'm not going to argue that's NE you\nknow you shouldn't uh and many times\nthat's me as well so here's what we do\nknow and I could we did whole episode on\nshift work but I'll try and summarize\nsome of the key\npoints you want to have your cortisol\nelevated early in the day and then\nsubside across the day that's the ideal\npattern of cortisol release cortisol is\na great thing when it's high and then\ntapers off from early day into the later\nday it's a bad thing if that cortisol\nPeak is shifted late that cortisol Peak\nis coming every 24 hours you don't have\na choice\nquestion is is it going to be early day\nor is it going to be late day late day\ncortisol is Peaks are associated with\ndepression anxiety this was done by my\ncolleague David Spiegel and the great\nRobert spolski at Stanford a study about\nthat Robert another great\nbeard\namazing and and and I I always thought\nit was to blend in with the species that\nhe studies cuz he was like the baboon\nguy you know I haven't quite figured out\nhow to master that one you know like the\nCuttlefish look but the um working on it\nworking on it maybe I just have to no\nnever mind there's a there's a story\nabout you heard remember the earlier\nstory The the made anyway the cuttle\nfish anyway never mind\num again this is why I don't like to\nspeak too late in the day I get myself\ninto trouble but um the point here um is\nthat having that cortisol Peak early in\nthe day sets you up for mood focus and\nalertness immune system function and\nreally um in a really great way shift\nworkers have a serious problem which is\nthat late peaks in cortisol are kind of\nParamount in all forms of shift work and\nso what you need to do is to put\nyourself ideally in lighting conditions\nthat limit the amount of blue light\ncoming in at night or when you're doing\nthat shift work now you have to do your\nwork and I think in the next two years\nif I have my way one one idea that I'd\nlike to of embed in people's minds is\nyou you know we hear a lot now about how\nhyper processed foods and highly\nprocessed foods are bad for us sort of\nempty calories what are empty calories\nit's foods that are very calorie dense\nbut micronutrient poor right that's what\nit it really is it's also the quality of\nfood issues and people get you know like\nlet's please not have the seed oil\ndebate it's like people get really into\nthis and it's unclear to me still and\nokay but we we sort of think of empty\ncalories like alcohol sugar Etc calorie\ndense micronutrient po\nlight can be viewed in much the same way\nthese days we live in a very blue light\nRich World lot of blue light so short\nwavelength light blue light UV light and\nby the way in sunlight especially down\nhere it's very UV Rich blue which is\ngreat during the day especially when\nit's offset or or sorry when it includes\nlong wavelength light full spectrum\nlight by the way for everyone that's\nobsessed with red light and I love red\nlight and red light therapies remember\nthe best source of red light is the sun\nit's full spectrum light it includes red\nit's just there's a bunch of other stuff\nin there too see it doesn't look like a\nRed Light Panel um that said if you are\ngoing to do shift work one of the best\nthings you can do it's been shown to\nreduce cortisol levels at night while\nyou're doing that shift\nwork is to filter out some of the blue\nso that is a use case for blue blockers\nor even\nfor glasses that put you into more\nreddish conditions provided you can\nstill do the work work you need to do\nsafely you will see a dramatic reduction\nin cortisol under those conditions this\nblue and UV pathway picked up by a\ncertain set of neurons in the eye the\nintrinsically photosensitive melanops\nand cells Etc is a real thing and it and\nit's designed to activate you this is\nwhy so-called Seasonal effective\ndisorder lamps sad lamps are basically\nbright blue whsh light so when you're\ndoing that shift work if you can get\ninto red or orange or light conditions\nif that's great you can do this very\ninexpensively by the way by just getting\nsome party lights it doesn't have to be\nany fancy red light this is we're not\ntalking about red light\npanels the other thing of course\nis when you get back to your nonwork\nenvironment you need to do some work to\nthink about when is best to sleep when\nis not best to sleep you know is it best\nto sleep all day and be up all night or\nget that sunlight in the morning and I\ntalk about that in the shift work\nepisode and I'm tempted to go down that\nrabbit hole now but I would just\nencourage you to take a look at that\nepisode and um I'll just cue you all to\na resource the hubman lab.com webbsite\nallows you thanks to our wonderful\nEngineers to put in multiple topics so\nyou could say shift work red light or\nshift work dopamine or shift work\nsunlight and it will take you to the\nexact time stamps across all the\nepisodes where those specific topics\noccur is all zero cost as opposed to\nhaving to go and peruse all these\ndifferent episodes you a lot of people\nhave said why not shorter episodes it's\nlike well the idea was to create a\nlibrary of information that now\nai is and better engineering of websites\ncan allow you to just pull the relevant\ninformation just like you would a book I\nused to go with the library for those of\nyou like me old enough to remember he\nactually took this thing called a book\noff a shelf he Xerox copied it in any\nevent he very archaic and very expensive\nand you'd always get the margin of the\nbook in the middle like the the spine it\nsucked now you can go to the website and\njust get that information and then we\nalso just launched an ai. huberman\nlab.com webbsite again as all zero cost\nyou can say hey what should I do for\nshift work but I wanted you here to come\nhere tonight so I didn't tell you that\nuntil you got here no I'm just kidding\nI'm just kidding okay um and there are a\nfew other tools about adjusting eating\nschedules for and what not for shift\nwork but um hopefully that gets you\ngoing um Julia thank you what's the\ndifference between nsdr and meditation\num thank thank you for this question I\nam a huge huge huge believer and\nproponent and practitioner of nsdr\nnonsleep deep rest what is non-sleep\ndeep rest well to be fair Yoga Nidra\nwhich translates to yoga sleep is a\nthousand-year-old\npractice um thousands of years little\npractice in which you lie completely\nstill keep the Mind awake you're not\nthinking in a structured way it's more\nof a body scan directed relaxation Etc I\ndiscovered this in 2015 when I was doing\nsome research for a book that I still\ncan't manage to seem to\nfinish on trauma and addiction and I\nwent I have a friend very talented\ntrauma therapist who's managed to help\npeople with all sorts of addictions\nhe'll be on the podcast in the not to\ndistant future and I went down to this\nclinic in\nFlorida and everyone there spent the\nfirst hour of the day doing Yoga Nidra\nthis is pretty wacky I was still in my\npure science quote unquote pure\nscientist naive scientist lens and I\nthought what is this about and he said\nwell you know so much of addiction is\nabout an inability to regulate impulses\num to deal with agitation especially in\nthe early days of trying to get sober or\nbeing sober and it just helps people\nlearn to regul self-direct the their\nnervous system in terms of relax\nself-directed relaxation it also seems\nto help with their sleep it also has\nthese components about time and and and\nsort of if you because he said you know\nit's kind of interesting if you take a\nstep back you know if you can tolerate\ncraving for a second you just did it so\nwhy couldn't you do it for another\nsecond why could you do it for another\nsecond another second it's not as if it\nnecessarily increases linearly or over\ntime so you know what's going on and so\nagain sort of our ability to realize and\nregulate our states across time and to\nrealize there's this funny thing where\nwhen we feel terrible we think it's\ngoing to go on forever and when we're\nhappy we we were like certain it's going\nto stop there's a kind of asymmetry in\nour nervous system that we don't\nunderstand we showed he started talking\nabout yoga NRA really seems to help\naddicts recover and stay sober if they\ndo it regularly thought well this is\ncool what is it I'm a neuroscientist we\nstarted studying in my\nlaboratory we discovered that the brain\ngoes into these States during yoga NRA\nthat are similar to\nsleep body still mind\nalert and that seems to be very\nbeneficial maybe even accelerates\nneuroplasticity and learning and indeed\nthere's evidence for that there's\nevidence that yoga at from a laboratory\nout of\nScandinavia not my laboratory showing\nthat it can increase dopamine levels in\nthe striatum basil ganglia by up to 60%\nusing human positron emission tomography\nImaging so we're talking about how to\nincrease dopamine through non\npharmacologic means this something about\nbody still brain active very very\npowerful way to do that I I made up this\nterm This Acronym non-sleep deep rest\nbecause I have tremendous respect for\nYoga Nidra and the the yoga Traditions\nbut I was concerned for a lot of people\nun unfortunately when they hear Yoga\nNidra the it sounds esoteric and they're\nnot going to approach that practice also\nyoga NRA includes intentions and some\nthings that are a little bit on the\nmystical side and I knew I was going to\ntake some heat for it and I feel badly\nabout it but that bad feeling is offset\nby I think when you call something\nnon-sleep deep breast it tells you what\nit is and then more people are likely to\ncome to the practice and I felt like it\nwas worth you know kind of\nputting myself you know jumping on the\ngrenade for that one so non-sleep deep\nrest is very effective at restoring\ncognitive and physical Vigor and can\nindeed offset some degree of sleep loss\nit also gets you better at falling and\nstaying asleep and it's very simple and\nvery easy to do and it's zero cost and\nif you want to try it you can go on to\nYouTube and put nsdr in my last name\nthere's a woman named Kelly boy boys who\nhas a much more pleasant voice than mine\num who does them as well these are all\nzeroc cost protocols she's also in the\nwaking up app um and there are many of\nthem common toai as another person who\nhas you know Wonderful Yoga Nidra\nscripts so you can find these things and\nthey're really about 10 minutes to 20\nminutes sometimes 30 minutes long you\ncan do it for an hour but most people\nwon't do that consistently you don't\nhave to do them every day and they're\nvery very effective at restoring mental\nand physical Vigor when you're feeling\ndepleted and it getting you to be a\nbetter sleeper\nso I figure that's a zeroc cost tool\nthat is grounded in good mechanistic\nscience and makes sense logically so why\nnot meditation typically and if and\nthere many different forms of meditation\nbut if you're let's just say kind of um\nstandard if there were such a thing um\nthird eye meditation closing your eyes\nfocusing your concentration on a point\njust sort of at your forehead\nconcentrating on breathing redirecting\nyour attention to your breathing if it\nif your attention drifts we know based\non work from Wendy Suzuki's\nlaboratory at New York University and\nsome work out of the University of\nWisconsin can improve\nmemory can improve\nfocus and does seem to have some stress\noffsetting effects but it's more of\na focus exercise as opposed to an energy\nreplenishing exercise now some people\nmeditate and feel better afterwards they\nhave more energy but then it's sort of\nlike well compared to what um I don't\nthink that's the maor effect of\nmeditation and while we're on these\ntopics I should just say that\nself-directed hypnosis of the sort that\nmy colleague David Spiegel studies is\nmore about solving a particular problem\nso hypnosis is more about engaging\nneuroplasticity remember earlier we said\nthat neuroplasticity in adulthood can be\nactivated by Focus followed by rest it\nseems that in the self-directed hypnotic\nStates the brain enters kind of pattern\nof activity in which\nneuroplasticity can be accessed more\nquickly we think because the brain is\nboth focused and relaxed in a particular\nway merging that focus and rest State\nand of course the hypnotic script is not\nabout getting you to do crazy things on\nstage that's stage hypnosis but\nself-directed hypnosis is for instance\nsmoking sensation by the way the the\nsuccess with smoking Sensation from\nhypnosis is far greater than the\ncessation with smoking from pretty much\nany other protocol but unfortunately it\nhas the name hypnosis which makes people\nthink about stuff that people do on\nstage that's kind of wacky so we need a\nnew name for it um because unfortunately\nnames are a problem there there names\ncan be differentiators as opposed to\nintegrators they don't bring PE when\npeople say I'm going to hypnotize you or\nyou should try hypnosis people like like\nyum yuck me they're like yuck so um by\nthe way does everyone here remember how\nyou know if you're highly hypnotizable\ndo you know that the Spiegel eye roll\ntest it's not what teenagers do David\nSpiegel and his father psychiat\ndiscovered the clinical application of\nhypnosis it's a clinically approved tool\nthere's brain stem neurons that cause\nelevations and alertness and focus and\nthey're associated with moving the eyes\nup they're brain stem neurons that close\nthe eyelids and push and essentially\nDrive the eyes down that are associated\nwith parasympathetic states which why\nyou like this when you're tired you're\nout there I'm\nsure if you are capable of keeping your\ney your gaze upward and closing your\neyelids you\nscore on a particular end of the\nso-called Spiel eye roll test which\nmakes you highly\nhypnotizable because that state of\nhypnosis is one in which you're what\nalert but very very relaxed so if you go\nto Spiegel's laboratory they're going to\nlook at you and they say look up at the\nceiling and then close your eyelids and\nif you can still see the whites of if\nthey still see the whites of your eyes\nas your eyelids close well then you're\nin the highly hypnotizable realm kind of\ninteresting right there's all nervous\nsystem related and you can see this\nstuff is this is like real clinical\ntools okay how do we stop ourselves from\nmindlessly scrolling on our\nphones hard questions um I didn't look\nat my watch because I'm bored I'm just\nthinking how much time do you have\num well on the way here to Australia my\nRob who you met earlier my friend and\npodcast producer he said okay\nguys everyone's deleting social media\nfrom your phones for the whole trip the\nwhole trip and I'm like I don't know if\nI can go on this trip Rob no I'm kidding\num uh we got one we have one guy who's\nkept it on his phone so that we can post\nthings um and we continue\nto honestly I think that's what it\ntakes um if it's social media that\nyou're scrolling I think you should do a\ndelete and\nreinstall if I'm honest a delete and\nreinstall every day uh because I think\nand then you have to limit the amount of\ntime and one of the members of my\npodcast team experienced this he said I\njust picked up my phone a minute ago and\nI went to like hit the Instagram Tab and\nit wasn't there and I know it's not\nthere and that's where I say yeah at\nsome point it becomes more compulsive\nthan addiction these are just reflexive\nbehaviors it's like walking in the\nrefrigerator like I did every day of my\nlife all day I just I walk into people's\nhomes and just look in the refrigerator\nI don't even know I get into people's\ncars I look in the glove box I just do\nthis I'm kind of like looking around I'm\nnot going to steal anything but it's\nlike the teenage boy in me you know just\nkind walk in I'm going to open your\nrefrigerator um so I think it's it gets\nto the point of\nreflexive and it's compulsive and it\nmight be\naddictive but it can't be good when it's\nlike that um but I think social media\ncan be really useful so I think um if\nyou're you can set timers you can try\ngraying out the screen getting rid of\nthe color thing there's all this stuff\nbut I think if if there are particular\napps that you're struggling with I would\njust delete them from your phone and and\ndo a reinstall because that's enough of\na of a behavioral barrier there are\nenough steps involved enough sequencing\nto put the thing back on there each day\nand each time maybe twice a day that\nyou're going to vastly reduce your use\nto be honest I think that's probably the\nbest way to do it and there are probably\npeople in this audience that are\nthinking this seems crazy like just\ndon't turn it on just don't just don't\nopen it and look if I was 65 years old\nI'd say that too\nbut it doesn't work that way for\ncertainly the younger generation it\ndoesn't I know this because I gave a\ntalk at Santa Clara University a few\nyears ago and I was talking about\nlimiting social uh social media use and\nphones and this kid came up to me\nafterwards he said you don't get it he\nlike you're like back then I was like 43\nhe said you don't get it he said for you\nthe phone was a thing that you like\nintegrated into your like post 9s High\nSchool life like you watched The\nBreakfast Club or I don't know how he\nknew that movie I was like you're right\nI did watch The Breakfast Club a bunch\nof\ntimes and he said but for us it's like\nlife I like I rolled my eyes and I\nthought wait no listen I'm going to\nlisten because no one knows what it's\nlike to be 16 years old or 24 years old\nin 2024 unless you're 16 or 24 like okay\nhere we go listen he said when my phone\nhe said when my phone Powers down\nI feel the energy drain out of me and\nwhen it comes back up I feel Life Energy\ncome back into my body and I thought oh\nmy goodness like we are hosed but that's\nbut that's the reality and I'm of the\nmind you know I was a I was a camp\ncounselor I worked with at risk kids I\nwas a wild kid and you learn something\nespecially when you work with kids like\nme when I was a teenager I was a Helen\nis be a channel not a damn you cannot\nblock the system that's emerged this is\nhere and it's here to stay so I think\nthings like deleting the app is putting\nit back on there is the only way to go\nwe have to listen I think we have to\nlisten understand that you know we after\nall adults created these Technologies\nand these kids are using them and I\ndon't think we're going to see a\nreversal I don't so we have to really I\nthink that what he said to me as scary\nas it was to me I think reflects the\nreality it's part of their life energy\nit's part of their connectivity and we\nwe're going to have to come up with\nbetter tools and I doubt those tools are\ngoing to be uh to the effect of\neliminating it you could say\nunfortunately you know all the adult\nlast I checked I'm an adult people in my\nlife have argued differently but I think\nwe're going to have to learn to be a\nchannel not a dam with this uh I do if\nresources and ethics were not an issue\nwhat would your dream clinical trial to\nrun oh my\ngoodness this is a hard question\nokay um dream clinical\ntrial what's\nthat oh gosh the accent is killing\nme more cuddlefish yeah more cuddlefish\nlike cuddlefish I like the idea of more\ncuddling\num physical contact so key\num I think we're all still recovering\nfrom the years we had a few years of\njust like no physical like physical\ncontact so minimal um I mean there's the\nclassic harlo experiments right the wire\nmonkey or versus the cloth monkey I mean\nprimates go to the cloth monkey even if\nthey don't get food there I mean it's\nsuch a critical component of you know\nhow our nervous system forms um the I\nthink this is a this is a you know what\nI'm going to do something I've never\ndone before I'm going to turn the\nquestion around I actually would I\nseriously I'm not trying to avoid\nanswering this but you know we've worked\non all I've worked on cuttlefish we\nworked on respiration practices we\nworked on uh Vision we've worked on\nneuro regeneration you know I've enjoyed\num working on a great number of\ndifferent things I'm sort of curious\nwhat people like what do you think we\nneed more of I've never done this but I\nreally want to know um I don't know how\nwe're going to do this in any kind of\nnon-chaotic format but what the hell um\nit's late enough in the evening we just\ndo it um like really I mean so now\nthere's trials on psychedelics we do\nthis by kind of like I'll throw out some\noptions and then we'll do it so right\nnow it seems that psychedelics are a big\nthing um do they increase plasticity\nyeah I'm excited about it I'm a convert\nbut I do think that one has to be\ncareful and there are certain people in\npopulations like people who um suffer\nfrom certain types of manic bipolar or\nschizophrenia that really need to avoid\nthese things kids I mean being a kid is\nbasically being in a psychedelic State\nthe you know lateral connectivity of the\nbrain is extended ensive um and you know\nI don't encourage it I mean that the\ntrials with MDMA and PTSD are incredible\nwhat's happening with maps is incredible\nyou know 60 plus perc remission rates\ndone with licensed Physicians of course\nI don't get Cavalier with this so okay\nso I'll just ask so I\nmean it's going to be hard to draw out\nthe denters but more work on\npsychedelics psilocybin Etc as ways to\namarate depression are people like more\nlike yum yuck or meh is that like yum\nokay or like yuck don't be afraid to say\nyuck I like a good argument is anyone\nlike yuck on psychedelics sorcery it's\nsorcery I heard that um meh okay all\nright interesting okay so psychedelics\nget a strong push I think we have enough\nevidence that changing patterns of\nrespiration changes brain States but I\nthink that that's an interesting area um\nI don't know you can you just shout it\nout just shout it out one all right\nfirst over here\nyes oh God the accent you guys are so\ngood I love the accent listen I listen I\nI don't drink I don't drink anymore but\nwhen I used to when I used to go to bars\nI'll just say the Australian accent\nnever fails um in the US\nyeah time\nChambers time\nChambers oh hyperbaric chambers yeah\nhyper that's an interesting one yeah I\nmean when I think of ways to modify\nphysiology you think temperature light\nneurom\nmodulators right you think by the way\nanytime you want to think about changing\nsomething in the body your brain you\nthink mechanical and chemical so this is\nkind of this is changing the chemistry\nof the brain and body through hyperbaric\nchambers thank you appreciate it I think\nI re did we run into each other at the\ngym the other day no anyway um think I\nrecognize you I um the\nokay one I'll get to you in one second\nyeah yeah love that okay so protocols\nfor childhood trauma yeah so I mean I\nthink we're finally at the place where\nwe as a world where like this word\ntrauma actually is Meaningful like\nbecause we knew it before but I think\nbefore people thought if like if you\nhadn't lived in a war zone which\nobviously is trauma um now I think\npeople appreciate that trauma is\ninherent to a lot of Life by the way I\nlove your shirt I that shirt it's like\nyeah a lawn stale shirt was Against\nRacism hey I love I love that shirt um\nyou know the history of that shirt right\nit's like lawdale was co-opted by some\nNeo-Nazi groups as a brand so lawdale\ncame out with an Against Racism and hate\nshirt which is like the best like to\nthat which is yeah so anyway little side\nnote there not sponsored by lawdale um\nbut rad shirt yeah I think childhood\ntrauma you know trauma can be best\ndefined as an adverse event that changes\nthe nervous system in a way that causes\nmaladaptive functioning going forward\nit's not every bad thing right but it\ncertainly happens and I think we need to\nlearn\nto rewire the nervous system let's let's\nface it whether not psychedelics or it's\ntalk therapy or it's hyperbaric chambers\nor it's cold plunges what we're talking\nabout is neuroplasticity we're trying to\nrewire the nervous system so I love that\none um we need some very structured um\ntools there's all sorts of stuff about\nsoaz release for trauma and you know\nthere's little bits like little Sil of\nthings that are all very interesting\nbreath work you know release work but so\nfar there isn't like a structured\nframework for for treating trauma\ndifferent groups doing different things\nEMDR Etc I think they all have Merit\nokay there was that shouting out cons\nConsciousness The Big C yeah um in my\nhouse Costello was the big ca he would\nalways remind me of that but\nConsciousness I think that um and now\nwith AI we have to ask ourselves like\nwhat is what is conscious\nand I think we need a clear definition\nof what that is do you guys know this\nstory of like they were going to solve\nConsciousness a few years ago and and\nthey didn't do it there was this bet in\nNeuroscience that um it was going to be\nsolved by 2015 or something like that so\nI think we need and it's not obviously\nso we need better definition of what\nthat means but I think it's very\nimportant uh problem indeed so thank you\nmaybe\na free will yeah that's a tough one\nthat's one I usually avoid\num R Robert Robert slammed me on that\none on the podcast what was it in the\nback I heard as an Adaptive technique\nbut oh yeah you know we hear I yeah we\nhear so much I I'm agreeing with you the\num we hear so much about ADHD these days\nwithout an understanding of like what it\nreally reflects except in the extreme\nclinical cases so I think a better\nunderstanding I did two episodes of the\npodcast by the way on a attention in 88\nshe one focused mainly on behavioral and\nnutritional tools it was positively\nreceived by about half of people and\nthen the other half were like this is\ngarbage what about all the drugs that\nare useful then I did one about all the\ndrugs that can be useful and people said\nthis is garbage you're putting kids on\nmeth and I'm like wait a second hold on\nwe try and cover it all so um because I\nI favor balance I heard a excellent\nthings there was were all male voices we\nkind of got a sampling bias here unless\nI'm got a high frequency cut off thank\nyou something negotiation\nsorry\nscience of\nnegotiation yeah so people being able to\nresolve\ndifferences\nbetter Lord please\nyes oh my goodness I mean this is yes\nthank you um if ever there was a call to\naction it's like um you know this is a\nbig question right I'm a neuroscientist\nnot a historian not a not a futurist or\na politician but um thank goodness can\nyou imagine what a terrible job I would\ndo I like being outdoors I hate meetings\nI like dressing like this and and I and\nI don't like the news um it'd be the\nworst\nbut yeah if ever there was a need and a\nquestion it's you know are we just going\nto continue in these like iterative\ncycles of like when the economy is good\nthings seem mostly good and then a lot\nof people are still suffering and then\nlike these cycles of and or are we going\nto finally just sit back and go okay\nwhat are we good at as a species what\nare we really bad at what are we like\nkind of good at and start coming up with\nsome tools to try and function better on\nthe whole with the understanding that\nthere are Bad actors out there that are\nconstantly trying to you know exploit\nand manipulate but there are also a lot\nof good actors too and by good actors I\ndon't mean actors in the in the stage\nacting sense I mean I think that um look\nwhat we're we're we're a smart species\nwe can think in past present and future\nterms we can look at mechanism we can\ncommunicate better with each other\nbetter than any species except maybe the\ncuddlefish and so I think the question\nis are we you know is there going to be\nsome sort of sitting back and finally\njust saying like enough like let's just\nfigure out a way to dialogue and I love\nthat um you\nknow it it's a it's a science we that\nthere are problems and there are hard\nproblems um and honestly I think it's\ngoing to come about if it comes about\nit's going to come about through groups\nnot through individuals I don't think\nwe're going to get like the world leader\nor world leaders of 12 people like let's\nget it done let's get it done right this\ntime I think it's going to be a a more\nCollective Consciousness you know I'd\nlike to see fewer individual leaders and\nmore groups and panels leading things\nbut anyway that's that's my bias and you\nknow\nums\ngenetics\ngenetics\ngenetics love\nit\nyeah okay well there's okay I'll say two\nthings and then I think my team's going\nto make me close out\n[Music]\nwait um rad okay awesome now it's\nturning into like a like a science punk\nrock show so um the um genetics well I\nthink the big things is in genetics are\nwe're soon going to be in the place\nwhere we can do genetic well right now\nyou can take human embryos and Screen\nthem for mutations by whole genome\nsequencing it's very inexpensive\ncompared to a few years ago it's still\nexpensive and you can do selection you\ncan select out based on lack of\nmutations maybe even based on over\nrepresentation of certain genes um\nthat's interesting has some ethical\nconsiderations but there soon will be\nyou can do crisper um you could in\ntheory you could modify the Genome of of\nadults um and certainly babies and so\nthat's where we're headed it's already\nbeing done in certain countries it was\ndone in China um it was not looked upon\nkindly by the International Ethics\ncommittees um but it was done a mutation\nin the in the HIV receptor um so those\nbabies exist so it's happening uh it's\ngoing to be interesting times uh the\nmicrobiome I think is really exciting\nhere's my big call to action is that\nthere's a microbiome in the gut but\nthere's also microbiome on the skin and\nthe nose and the mouth and the genitals\nlike these all these little niches and\nwell I guess it depends the little or\nnot so little niches um depends um I was\nthinking about the nostrils um the\nnight's getting long um there I go again\num the\nuh they they are all important and and\nthere's a lot more to understand I think\nthe gut microbiome is just one of the\nmicrobiomes so and female hormones\ncertainly important topic it's received\nfar less sadly far less attention than\nmale hormone therapy or um understanding\nand and things are starting to change\nthere it's been slow yeah yeah there's\nbeen it's been can you believe it it was\nlike four only like eight years ago that\nthe National Institutes of Health in the\nUnited States was like hey maybe you\nshould start studying female mice too\nit's like like this I mean we're modern\nscience is very far behind we're very\nfar behind and I think it's a it's a\nresource issue it's also uh you know\nthere's a bunch of um sociological\nconsider considerations in science\nanyway I'm trying to change the story\nthere but I'm but one person and you\nknow I hope to live a very long time but\nyou know um should I get hit by a bullet\nto bus or cancer um tomorrow I want you\nto know that it's going to be or late\nlong time from now I have natural causes\nsorry I have a morbid sense of humor I\nwork I worked with the Physicians they\nall talk like that I hope to live a very\nlong time um but it's a collective\neffort so I just want to um before we\nwrap want to say a couple of things we\ncan get on with the rest of the night\nfirst of all um I it is a collective\neffort um you know I as I've mentioned\nseveral times this evening I I look no\ndifferently on the massage therapy\nversus Chiropractic versus uh whole\ngenome sequencing it's just all\ndifferent lenses to look at the same\nsort of set of goals through and yes\nthere's a range of quality and rigor and\ncommunication Styles and personality but\nif you can maintain some level of\ncuriosity and discernment about what\nworks for you or doesn't work for you or\nwhere you think there's Merit um that's\ngreat but but it's going to be um a\nwonderful thing when we can all start to\ndialogue and see where the points of\nconvergence are where we're you're\nbasically talking about two different\ngroups talking about the exact same\nthing through different language I think\nthat's where things really can move\nforward um the discourse of public\nscience and health communication\nobviously is something I'm very\npassionate about I would love to see\nmore podcasts believe believe it or not\nnot just my podcast but they more\npodcasts if you have something to say to\nthe world please say it please put it\nout there on social media I do think\nthat there's value there so I'm\nencouraging the every person not just\nusually they go the young people but\nlike the every people to um you know get\ninformation out there and and to support\nthe efforts and I also want to say thank\nyou so much for coming out on a Saturday\nnight here in Melbourne um and for\nlistening to the podcast and for\nyeah it really means a lot to me thank\nyou thank you thank you thank you thank\nyou so\nmuch thank\nyou thank\nyou thank\nyou I re I really appreciate it that the\npodcast is indeed a labor of love I feel\noh so blessed to do it and um and my\nhope is that the tools protocols and\ninformation will radiate out as far and\nwide as possible I don't need or want\ncredit I just want people to have the\ninformation I really mean that and to\nshare it where you think it can be\nuseful to people and last but certainly\nnot least thank you for your interest in\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nscience"
