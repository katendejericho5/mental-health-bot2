    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing skin\nHealth our skin is an incredibly\nimportant organ not just for our\nappearance or because it serves as a\nbarrier to the other organ systems of\nthe body but because it actually\nreflects the health status of all the\nother organs and systems in our body\nincluding our brain as well you'll learn\ntoday about the direct and reciprocal\nrelationship between the immune system\nand our skin and if you think about it\nyou've seen this relationship in action\nbefore when any of us is feeling\nfatigued or sick the color the tone of\nour skin tends to be a bit quote unquote\noff at least for us relative to what it\nnormally is conversely when we are\nfeeling particularly well rested and\nvibrant and healthy our skin reflects\nthat so today we will discuss the skin\nas an organ we'll talk a little bit\nabout the biology of skin so that\neverybody is on board the nomenclature\nof the different cell types in the skin\nand how they're affected by various\nthings and then we will discuss those\nthings such as sunlight and sun exposure\nas it relates to skin cancers we'll talk\nabout sunscreens of course something\nthat I know Garners a lot of interest\nthese days and even some controversy we\nwill talk about common conditions of\nskin that concern people such as acne\nrosacea psoriasis eczema and of course\nwe will talk about so-called anti-aging\ntreatments for skin that is the things\nthat can be done to help reduce the\ndegradation of the protein components in\nskin things like collagen things that\nyou can do to improve collagen turnover\nas well as elastin these are other\nproteins within skin that give skin its\nyouthful or in some cases where it's\ndegenerative non- youthful appearance\nthings like wrinkles and sagging skin so\nwe'll talk about all of that we'll also\ntalk about the various products that\nhave been developed in order to treat\nwrinkles treat sagging skin reverse acne\nEtc we'll talk about which ones are safe\nwhich ones are not safe and which ones\nfor which there still is no clear answer\nI want to make very clear here at the\noutset that while I'll discuss various\nskin products during today's episode I\nnor the podcast has any Financial\nrelationship to those products I will\nprovide examples of certain products and\nprovide a few links in the show note\ncaptions but I want to point out that\nthose serve merely as examples that I\nfound during researching this episode\nwhich by the way included speaking to\nseveral board-certified dermatologists\nincluding a dermatologist expert in\noncology cancers of the Skin So by the\nend of today's episode you will have a\nmuch clearer understanding about skin\nand what it is at the level of biology\nand function its relationship to other\nsystems in the body including the immune\nsystem and gut microbiome and you will\nbe armed with the knowledge to make the\nbest possible decisions for you in terms\nof skin health and Skin Care depending\non your age your goals and any current\nconditions you may have before we begin\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is ju\njuv makes medical grade red light\ntherapy devices now if there's one thing\nI've consistently emphasized on this\npodcast is the incredible impact that\nlight can have in our biology now in\naddition to sunlight red light and near\ninfrared light have been shown to have\npositive effects on improving numerous\naspects of Cellar and organ Health\nincluding faster Muscle Recovery\nimproves skin health and wound healing\neven improvements in acne reducing pain\nand inflammation improving mitochondrial\nfunction and even improving Vision\nitself what sets juv lights apart and\nwhy they're my preferred red light\ntherapy devices is that they use\nclinically proven wavelengths meaning it\nuses specific wavelengths of red light\nand near infrared light in combination\nto trigger the optimal Cellar\nadaptations person recently I use the ju\nhandheld light both at home and when I\ntravel it's only about the size of a\nsandwich so it's super portable and\nconvenient to use I also have a ju whole\nbody panel and I use that about three or\nfour times per week if you'd like to

therapy\nfor over three decades initially I\ndidn't have a choice it was a condition\nof being allowed to stay in school but\npretty soon I realized that therapy is\ncritical to overall health in fact I\nconsider doing regular therapy just as\nimportant as getting regular physical\nexercise which of course I also do every\nweek research tells us that excellent\ntherapy includes three critical\ningredients the first ingredient is a\nstrong Rapport between you and the\ntherapist somebody that you can really\ntrust and talk to about the issues that\nare concerning you second great therapy\nshould provide support in the form of\nemotional support or directed guidance\ntowards the issues you're facing and\nthird excellent therapy should provide\ninsights either directly from the\ntherapist or that you arrive at that you\nwould have otherwise not been able to\narrive at had you not have that\nemotional support and strong rapport\nwith better help they make it easy for\nyou to find an expert therap with whom\nyou can have those three critical\ncomponents and because better help is\ncarried out entirely online it can mesh\nwell with your schedule you don't have\nto

biology of the visual\nsystem and I can tell you that your\nvisual system has to contend with an\nenormous number of different challenges\nin order for you to be able to see\nclearly from moment to moment Roa\nunderstands all of that and has designed\nall of their ey glasses and sunglasses\nwith the biology of the visual system in\nmind Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were\nfirst designed for use in sport in\nparticular for things like running and\ncycling and as a consequence Roa frames\nare extremely lightweight so much so\nthat most of the time you don't even\nremember that you're wearing them and\nthey're also designed so that they don't\nslip off even if get sweaty now even\nthough Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere initially designed for sport they\nnow have many different frames and\nstyles all of which can be used not just\nfor sport but also for wearing out to\ndinner to work essentially anytime in\nany setting I wear Roa readers at night\nor Roa eyeglasses if I'm driving at\nnight and I wear Roa sunglasses in the\nmiddle of the day anytime it's too\nbright for me to see clearly my eyes are\nsomewhat sensitive so I need that I do\nnot wear sunglasses in the morning when\nI'm getting my morning sunlight viewing\nfor sake of setting my circadian rhythm\nbut I do wear sunglasses often at other\ntimes throughout the day when it's very\nbright out I particularly like the\nhunter 2.0 frames which I have as\neyeglasses and now as sunglasses too if\nyou'd like to try Roa you can go to\nroka.com huberman to get 20% off your\npurchase again that's roka.com huberman\nto

I\nmentioned earlier not just because it\nprotects all the other organs of our\nbody and I should mention it protects\nthem not just by a physical barrier but\nthere's also chemical things a chemical\ncomposition a skin microbiome to the\nskin that also provides additional\nlayers of support such as neutralizing\ndifferent bacteria that land on your\nskin there's a lot more to skin than you\nmight realize but to start off let's\njust talk about what skin is at the\nlevel of its structure some of the cell\ntypes because in understanding that\nyou'll be best equipped to understand\nsome of the recommendations for skin\nhealth and Skin Care the skin like many\nother organs in the body is a layered\nstructure so the very outermost layer is\ncalled the epidermis the epidermis has\ncells in it below that there are other\ncells that comprise What's called the\ndermis or sometimes referred to as the\ndermal layer and then beneath that you\nhave subcutaneous fat now of course in\ndifferent areas of the body the skin and\nas a consequence these different layers\nof the epidermis and dermis and the fat\nlayer below it are of different\ncomposition and different thicknesses\nthink for instance about the thickness\nof the skin on your forearm versus the\nthickness of the skin on your belly\nversus the thickness of your skin on\nyour eyelid okay and as soon as you\nthink about your eyelid you realize okay\nthis thing that we call skin varies\ntremendously in thickness depending on\nwhether or not we're with the scalp the\neyelid the face the chin even you know\nneck versus chin body Etc so what we\nthink of as skin while it may have a\ndesignated set of layers that have\nparticular names can vary tremendously\nin terms of its overall thickness and\ntherefore its vulnerability to things\nlike sunlight which indeed can mutate\nthe cells within the skin cause them to\nyou know have disregulation of the\nexpression of DNA and the production of\nother cells we'll get into that so I\njust want you to think about skin as\nhaving these critical components of\nlayers epidermis and dermis below it and\nby the way within the dermis is where\nyou're going to find the blood supply\nthe vessels and capillaries that\ninnervate the skin innervate simply\nmeans that Supply or go-to the skin you\nof course have hair follicles and hair\ngrowing out of those follicles in many\ncases and then of course you have skin\nthat does not have hair the so-call\nglabrous skin like on the palms of your\nhands the bottoms of your feet Etc so I\ndon't want to give the impression that\nskin is the same everywhere it varies in\nthickness it varies in terms of the\npresence of hair or lack of hair it\nvaries according to a lot of different\nparameters including how much oil is\nproduced in one region or another but if\nyou just know that the skin has an\nepidermis an outermost layer a dermis or\nsometimes referred to as the dermal\nlayer which is below it and then it has\nfat below that and that the vasculature\nright the vessels and capillaries are at\nthe level of the dermis they come up\nthrough the subcutaneous fat and into\nthat dermal layer but they don't reach\ninto the epidermal layer that outermost\nlayer and if you understand also that\nthat nerve endings okay the little\nterminals as we call them of neurons\nnerve cells also go up into that dermal\nlayer you've got temperature sensors in\nthe skin all of this becomes very\nimportant for our discussions of skin\nconditions things like rosacea things\nlike acne which sometimes can be painful\nor can be exacerbated by things like\nheat they can be suppressed in some\ncases or even activated by things like\ncold okay so if you just understand that\nthere three layers epidermis on the\noutside dermis below it subcutaneous fat\nand that skin varies in thickness and\nthat nerves that is nerve endings and\nblood vessels and capillaries are within\nthe dermal layers of the skin well\nyou're going to be very well equipped\nfor the rest of today's discussion I'll\nthrow in some additional information\nabout oil production within the hair\nfollicle and a few other things like\nextracellular Matrix which as the name\nsuggests is extracell it's outside where\nthe cells reside but gives it its\ncomposition as either plump and moist\nappearing on the outside or it can be\nkind of sag and wrinkled and dry\nappearing all of that relates to the\ndifferent components of proteins and\nother things within those skin layers\nbut if you understand what I just told\nyou even at a crude level if you can\njust imagine it just a little bit those\nthree layers you're going to be very\nwell equipped for the rest of today's\ndiscussion I should also mention that\nthere are glands within the skin this\nwon't be surprising to most of you those\nglands will produce oil either more or\nless depending on certain conditions and\nthere are things that live on the skin\non that epidermal layer and within it\nthat we call microbiota you've no doubt\nheard of the gut microbiome right the\nexistence of trillions of little\nmicrobacteria that live within your gut\nthat provided they are varied in their\ncomposition and of the right sort really\nsupport your immune system and other\naspects of Health including brain\nfunction and health well you also have a\nskin microbiome that is the existence of\nmicrobiota on the outside of your skin\nthat serve as a barrier to infections\nbut that also provide things that are\nnourishing to the skin and give it that\nvibrant look that most people want and\nby cleansing your skin in particular\nways that is washing it with certain\nsubstances and avoiding other substances\nyou can support as opposed to diminish\nthat skin microbiome okay so to start\ntoday's discussion I want to jump right\ninto the deep end meaning into one of\nthe more controversial issues related to\nskin health and Skin Care out there\nright now which is sun exposure and\nsunscreen now it makes sense why this\nwould be such a heated issue no pun\nintended because most everyone is\nexposed to the Sun or has the\nopportunity to be exposed to the Sun to\nsome degree or another every single day\neven on cloudy overcast days it's also\nthe case that we've learned a lot in the\nlast 10 years or so about how different\nsunscreens and their components may be\ngood for us may be less good for us and\ntoday we're going to talk about what is\nknown and what is still unknown but\nbefore we do that we need to take a step\nback and look at the context in which\nall this controversy is happening my\nread of the online community as a whole\nas it relates to sunscreen and sun\nexposure in particular is the following\nI think most everybody I didn't say\neverybody but most everybody out there\nseems to accept the idea that excessive\nsun exposure can cause certain cancers\nof the skin that's the general belief\nout there and there is good reason for\nthat belief because indeed the Sun as\nfull spectrum light includes long wave\nlengths it's probably easier to think\nabout those long wavelengths as the Reds\nand oranges and yellows and so forth\nthat are present in\nwell they're always present from\nsunlight but they're most obvious to us\nwhen the sun is low in the sky so-called\nlow solar angle sunlight at sunsets and\nalso at Sunrise but of course as full\nspectrum light sunlight also includes UV\nultraviolet light of different types\nwe'll talk about those types today as\nwell as blue light and green light and\nin midday sun when the sun is overhead\nwe just see the Sun as white light right\nbecause containing all those different\nwavelengths so while this is not a\ndiscussion about wavelengths and optics\nfor sake of today's discussion just\nunderstand that long wavelength light\ntends to be more of the red orange\nyellow variety okay Loosely speaking and\ndown at the other end of the spectrum\nthe short wavelength light is more of\nthe blue and green and so-called\nultraviolet light so it's well accepted\nlight of different wavelengths such as\nUV Blue Light Green Light all the way\nout to Red Light even near infrared\nlight can penetrate into cells it can\nactually pass through surfaces it turns\nout that long wavelength light can\nactually go deeper in into the surface\nof our skin right it literally can\npenetrate just by shining a red light on\nyour skin it can actually penetrate the\nskin to a deeper layer then can short\nwavelength light like UV light and it's\nwell accepted that UV light when it\npenetrates mostly that epidermal layer\nof the skin that outermost layer it can\ncause changes in the way that DNA\nfunctions it can cause mutations such\nthat DNA which as many of you probably\nremember from high school biology DNA is\ntranscribed into RNA and RNA is\ntranslated into proteins the proteins\nare the things that the cells produce\nthey're actually made up of proteins\nwell UV like can disrupt which DNA are\nexpressed and how they are expressed in\nsome cases leading to overproduction of\ntoo many cells or disruptions in the\nfunctions of cells and that's why people\nlink UV light to skin cancer that's the\nwhole idea there and that's the whole\nnotion behind using sunscreens and\nnotice I'm saying Sun screen so ways to\nscreen out UV light or maybe all\nsunlight in some cases in order to\nprevent that penetration of the UV light\ninto cells which can cause mutations\nwhich in some cases can lead to skin\ncancer now I realize as I'm saying this\nthere's probably a group of you out\nthere saying what's the evidence that\nsunlight can actually cause skin cancer\nwell there is clear evidence that\nsunlight can cause skin cancer so which\nskin Cancers and how deadly those skin\ncancers are we'll get to in a few\nmoments that turns out to be a very\ninteresting twist in the whole story but\nI want to highlight the fact that\nthere's very little controversy as to\nwhether or not UV light can cause\nmutations in cells right but what you\nshould be asking yourself is well why\nwould long wavelength light like red\nlight perhaps be good for skin we'll\ntalk about that later there are\ntherapies phototherapies that use that\nexploit red light which can penetrate\ndeep into skin that actually can enhance\nthe health of skin if done correctly\nwhereas short wavelength light which\nonly hits that epidermal layer on the\noutside of the skin may be bad for our\nskin and I say maybe because it's really\na function of dose and timing and\ngenetic background okay if all this is\nseeming rather complicated I'm going to\nmake it very simple and before I do that\nI do want you to ask yourself a question\nI want you to ask yourself where you\nreside on the Continuum of beliefs about\nsunscreen UV light and skin cancers so\nhere it goes my read of the landscape\nout there is that there are some people\nit's a small minority but there are some\npeople who feel that sunscreen in any\nform is bad for them they think okay sun\nis great for them and sunscreens of any\nkind chemical or physical barriers bad\nfor them okay some people believe this\nI'm not saying I believe this in fact I\ndon't believe that I'm a big believer in\nsunlight and the power of sunlight for\nhealth but I am not what is called a\nsunscreen truther okay I'm not somebody\nwho thinks that sunscreen has no value\nin fact quite the opposite under certain\nconditions and certain sunscreens I want\nto say that for the record other people\nout there believe that certain\nsunscreens can be valuable but only the\nsunscreens that lack certain chemicals\nbecause they are concerned about\nchemicals in certain sunscreens being\nso-called endocrine disruptors or maybe\neven causing cancer on their own okay\nother people are so afraid of sunlight\nand believe that it causes so many\nissues as it relates to skin cancer that\nthey basically create beekeeper uniforms\nfor themselves so that anytime they're\nout in sunlight they want to have\nsunglasses on they want to have a hat\nthey want to cover their neck every part\nof their body okay they sit at the\nopposite extreme of the people who don't\nbelieve in using any sun protection\nwhatsoever and now of course there's the\nbackdrop of how much natural melanin\nproduction we each make that is how dark\nour skin happens to be according to our\ngenetics and of course there's the issue\nof where we live on the planet and how\nmuch sun we have available to us in\norder to potentially expose ourselves to\nand perhaps also ask yourself if you are\nin what I believe is the largest\ncategory of people out there which is\nthe category of people who probably\ndon't wear sunscreen every day maybe\nthey put it on occasionally but only if\nit's very bright out very hot out\nbecause they don't want to get a soall\nsunburn and I believe most people fit\ninto that General category of a not\nwanting to be burned B not wanting to\nage any faster than they would were they\nto not wear sunscreen at least that's\ntheir belief and C they've just been\ntold that sunscreen's good for them and\nthey'll reach for whatever sunscreen is\non the shelf or that was recommended to\nthem either by their dermatologist or\nthat they they happen to find in the\npharmacy or when they're out skiing and\nthey you know they notice it's a bright\nday and so they buy some sunscreen and\nslather it on so before I go any further\njust ask yourself those questions you\nknow where do you reside are you afraid\nof sunscreen do you love sunscreen are\nyou in The Beekeeper category like you\nthink all sun is bad it's going to give\nyou skin cancer it's going to age you\nfaster we'll get to the Aging component\nin a few minutes but just ask yourself\nthat question as we wade into the\nmaterial I'm about to cover so what's\nthe story with sun exposure sunburn\nsunscreen skin cancer and aging I spoke\nto several different dermatologists\nabout this including one expert in skin\ncancers specifically and what I was told\nis the following first of all sun\nexposure will disrupt the collagen and\nelastin but mostly the collagen\ncomposition of your skin in a way that\nmakes it appear as if you're aging\nfaster okay so sun exposure yes ages the\nskin now that does not mean however that\nyou want to avoid all sun exposure\nbecause the same dermatologist said that\nsome sun exposure is healthy for us why\nbecause our skin is also an endocrine\norgan it's involved in making various\nhormones it's part of the vitamin D\nproduction pathway although a little bit\nlater we'll talk about the fact that\nmost people get their Vitamin D from\ntheir diet and in some cases also from\nsupplementation but it is a good idea to\nget some sunlight for sake of vitamin D\nproduction but also the production of\nother hormones like testosterone and\nestrogen okay so every single dermat\nologist that I spoke to said that some\nsun exposure is good for us but that too\nmuch sun exposure will accelerate the\nappearance of Aging in our skin so let's\npin that up on the wall as fact okay\nthis again is not saying you should\navoid Sun completely it's also not\nsaying you should get excessive sunlight\nexposure it's saying sunlight exposure\nby virtue of the UV wavelengths ability\nto cause mutations in the epidermal\nlayers of the skin and to impact the\ncollagen composition of the dermal\nlayers below it as well as some of the\nother proteins present in the karatinos\nsites okay one of the major skin cell\ntypes and other cell types of the skin\ndoes lead to the appearance of aged skin\nwhich is one rationale for wearing\nsunscreen now when I say sunscreen\neveryone including myself thinks about\nlotions or in some cases sprays but\nlet's pay attention to the one fact that\nI do think everybody regardless of what\ncategory they are in the general\npopulation or what background training a\ndermatologist has\nbelieves which is a physical barrier a\nshirt a hat a jacket a physical barrier\ncan provide in some cases very good\nprotection from the Sun and I don't\nthink there's any controversy whatsoever\nas to whether or not the composition of\nthe physical barrier is having negative\neffects on the skin okay you will find\nthose Niche communities out there that\nare saying okay certain chemicals\npresent in certain materials that\nclothing are made with can be problems\nfor the endocrine system but we're not\ntalking about that here okay what I'm\nsaying is that all dermatologists I\nspoke to and I think most every rational\nhuman being on Earth would say that a\nphysical barrier can help to a great\ndegree in order to protect our skin from\nthe Sun as it relates to sunburn but\nalso acceleration of the appearance of\nAging in our skin okay so I don't think\nthere's any dispute about physical\nbarriers for protecting the skin how\nmuch you want to protect your skin from\nthe Sun well that will depend on what\ncategory you decided you were in from\nthe earlier discussion we'll get back to\nthat\nwhat else did all the dermatologists and\nskincare experts that I spoke to also\nagree upon well they all said that\nindeed excessive sun exposure can\nincrease the propensity for certain skin\ncancers I want to go on record by saying\nI believe that why well because of this\nability of UV light and some other\nwavelengths of light potentially to\ncause mutations in skin cells that can\nlead to certain skin cancers okay I\ndon't think that's a debated topic out\nthere there might be a few people out\nthere who are going to hang their hat on\na study that I'll go into a little bit\nlater which is that the relationship\nbetween sun exposure and all-cause\nmortality is a tricky one it's one that\nwill parse okay meaning I'll just give\nit a little you know hint into what I'm\nsaying people who avoid the sun entirely\ndon't tend to live as long as people\nthat get some sun exposure but there are\na bunch of confounding variables that\nhave to be understood in order to really\ninterpret that statement and the study\nthat we'll parse a little bit later for\nnow let's just accept the reality that\nthe vast vast Ma majority of\ndermatologists out there and skincare\nexperts really understand that sun\nexposure can accelerate aging of the\nskin but most will also tell you that\nsome sun exposure is good for you not\njust for skin Health but for overall\nbrain and body Health now as it relates\nto skin cancer the dermatologist\noncologist that I spoke to all right who\ndid his training at Stanford and I'll\nprovide a link in the show note captions\nto his clinic and you can learn more\nabout some of his work he's published\nsome really nice\npapers said following and this was\nsurprising to me he said it turns out\nthat the skin cancers that sun exposure\ncauses while they can be serious and\nshould be taken seriously they should be\ntreated those generally are not the most\ndeadly of the skin cancers now why would\nhe say something like that okay he said\nit because it turns out that there are\nlots of different kinds of skin cancer\nsome of them arise or can arise through\nsun exposure others and indeed some of\nthe most deadly of skin cancers are\nindependent of sun exposure and this is\nwhere things can get a little bit tricky\nyou'll hear out there oh you know Sun\ncan cause skin cancer but not the skin\ncancers that kill you I don't think\nthat's really a fair statement you'll\nalso hear however that all the skin\ncancers that are out there are the\nconsequence of sun exposure and that\nalso is not true and if anything this\nprovides motivation not just on the part\nof the dermatologist but it should be\nmotivation from within all of us to make\nsure that we understand our background\ngenetics not just how much pigmentation\nWe Carry in our skin by virtue of our\ngenetics but we should know by asking if\nyou're not going to get genetically\nsequenced which you can do nowadays of\ncourse but you should know whether or\nnot your family your genetics tends to\ncarry certain mutations that make you\nmore prone to skin cancers in general\nnot just the type that can be\nexacerbated by sun exposure what I'm\nbasically saying is that if you have\nparticular genetics in your family even\nif you avoid all sun exposure you know\nnobody should do that of course you need\nsome sunlight I mean like all other or\nmost all other uh creatures on Earth\nsunlight is important for us it's\nimportant for setting our circadian\nrhythms that's why I'm always telling\npeople to get sunlight in their eyes\nearly in the day which by the way when\nthe sun is low in the Sky low solar\nangle sunlight the UV index tends to be\nvery low okay so you are at the lowest\npossible risk of getting burned of\ngetting any kind of mutations to your\nskin that doesn't mean you should overdo\nit it doesn't mean you should stare at\nthe Sun and damage your eyes I've talked\nabout this a lot on other podcasts how\nto get morning sunlight exposure\nproperly but when the sun is low in the\nsky that's generally a safe time to get\nsun exposure it's that midday Sun\ntypically between the hours of you know\n11:00 a.m. or even 10: a.m. Depending on\ntime of year and where you're at and 2\nor 3 or 4 p.m. that the sun is overhead\nand at its greatest intensity and where\nthe UV index can be very high it's very\neasy to look up the UV index and when\nthe UV index is very high right I was\ndown in Australia earlier this year and\nthe UV index down there is so high you\ncan almost feel it you actually can feel\nit you step outside and you immediately\nfeel like wow my skin is really being\nbombarded with the sunlight and I'm\nsomebody who tolerates sunlight pretty\nwell because my dad's fairly um you know\ndark pigmentation just Naturally by\nvirtue of being South American normally\nI can tolerate the skin pretty well but\nyou should not rely on just that\nsubjective feel you should look up the\nUV index and we'll provide a few Links\nof good UV index sites that you can look\nup the UV index and where you might want\nto be extra cautious about providing a\nphysical barrier or a chemical barrier\nto protect your skin now a lot of people\nout there also believe that if you avoid\nsunburn you're avoiding skin cancer\nperhaps you're very pale or it's the\nearly phase of the summer season or you\nhave a susceptibility to sunlight such\nthat you know you step outside and you\nget too much sunlight on a given day and\nyou get a sunburn that reflects an\nimmune reaction an inflammatory reaction\nwithin the dermal layers of the skin so\nthat means the vasculature right those\nvessels and capillaries they're going to\ndilate you often times will get\ninfiltration of things like cyto coses\nwhich are of the immune system you get\nan inflammatory respon that's why it's\nred that's why it's tender to the touch\nthe nerve endings there can be overly\nactivated so the reason why your skin\nactually feels warm right when you touch\nyour sunburn is because in fact you have\nan activation of some of the nerve\nendings at that site as well as the\nactivation of the local immune system\nproperties that give rise to again\nvessel and capillary dilation it's a\nwound of sorts induced by excessive sun\nexposure now does sunburn cause skin\ncancer there's no direct relationship\nbetween Sunburn and skin cancer except\nthe fact that sunburn reflects excessive\nsunlight exposure and yes as I mentioned\nbefore it's conclusive that excessive UV\nsun exposure to the skin can cause\ncertain mutations in skin cells that\ngive rise to certain skin cancers why\nare we parsing things at this level of\ndetail right is this all just semantics\nno it's not just semantics many people\nbelieve that if they didn't get a\nsunburn they are not at additional risk\nfor inducing skin cancer or other issues\nwith skin right we're not just talking\nabout skin cancer we're talking about\naccelerated aging of the skin according\nto sun exposure so let's make this very\nsimple you don't need a sunburn for the\nsun to accelerate the Aging appearance\nof your skin you don't need a sunburn to\ninduce the kind of mutation that may\nagain I want to highlight may give rise\nto a skin cancer it's also not the case\nthat if you got a sunburn or even\nmultiple sunburns that you'll\nnecessarily develop skin cancer although\nby virtue of the fact that sunburn\nreflects UV exposure\nmultiple sunburns would reflect\nincreased UV exposure and therefore\nincreased risk for certain skin cancers\nso all this to say avoid sunburn however\nyou can and if you're somebody who just\nloes sunscreen that doesn't want to even\nhear the discussion we're about to have\nnext about which sunscreens are safe and\nwhich ones appear to be less safe if\nyou're just one of these people that\ndoes not want to put sunscreen on\nbecause you're very concerned about\nwhatever chemical might be in sunscreen\nwell then consider that the physical\nbarrier of an article of clothing or a\nhat or a bandana of sorts can indeed\nShield you from the Sun to some degree\noften to a great degree and again I\ndon't think there's any controversy as\nto whether or not those are safe as many\nof you know I've been taking ag1 for\nmore than 10 years now so I'm delighted\nthat they're sponsoring this podcast to\nbe clear I don't take ag1 because\nthey're a sponsor rather they are a\nsponsor because I take ag1 in fact I\ntake ag1 once and often twice every\nsingle day and I've done that since\nstarting way back in 2012 there is so\nmuch conflicting information out there\nnowadays about what proper nutrition is\nbut here's what there seems to be a\ngeneral consensus on whether you're an\nomnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a\nvegan I think it's generally agreed that\nyou should get most of your food from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources which allows you to eat enough\nbut not overeat get plenty of vitamins\nand minerals probiotics and\nmicronutrients that we all need for\nphysical and mental health now I\npersonally am an omin and I strive to\nget most of my food from unprocessed or\nminimally processed sources but the\nreason I still take ag1 once and often\ntwice every day is that it ensures I get\nall of those vitamins minerals\nprobiotics Etc but it also has\nadaptogens to help me cope with stress\nit's basically a nutritional insurance\npolicy meant to augment not replace\nquality food so by drinking a serving of\nag1 in the morning and again in the\nafternoon or evening I cover all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take A1\none report feeling much better in a\nnumber of important ways such as energy\nlevels digestion sleep and more so while\nmany supplements out there are really\ndirected towards obtaining one specific\noutcome ag1 is foundational nutrition\ndesigned to support all aspects of\nwell-being related to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink a1.com

our\ndiscussion about sunscreens and the\nchemicals in\nsunscreens let's just take a moment and\ntalk about vitamin D vitamin D is\nimportant for a great number of bodily\nand brain functions as I mentioned\nearlier most people get their Vitamin D\nfrom the foods they eat if you eat dairy\nin most countries the dairy is fortified\nwith vitamin D many people nowadays\nsupplement with vitamin D anywhere from\na th000 IUS to 5,000 IUS that folks out\nthere who perhaps even take 10,000 IUS\nseems a bit high for most people but\nit's going to depend on how much sun\nexposure you get the pigmentation of\nyour skin but there are a number of\npeople especially in countries where\nthey don't get a lot of sun exposure in\nparticular times of year and maybe\nthey're not eating enough Dairy\nfortified with vitamin D who would\nbenefit from vitamin D supplementation\nand many people find they feel better\nwhen they supplement with vitamin D but\nI encourage you that if you're going to\nsupplement with vitamin D to probably\nstart at the lower end of\nsupplementation like a th000 to 3,000 IU\nmaybe 5,000 IU best would be to measure\nyour vitamin D levels many people are\nsurprised to find that even if they live\nin a part of the world where they get a\nfair amount of sun exposure and they eat\nsome Dairy that's fortified with vitamin\nD that for whatever reason their vitamin\nD levels are still too low and benefit\nfrom supplementation with vitamin D the\ndermatologist that I spoke to told me\nthat yes even if you wear sunscreen or a\nphysical barrier okay this is\ninteresting even if you wear sunscreen\nor a physical barrier when you get\noutside into the\nsun it can still have a positive effect\non your vitamin D levels this was\nsurprising to me but then of course it\nmakes sense sunlight is full spectrum\nlight it's not just UV and short\nwavelength light the ability for longer\nwavelength light to penetrate the skin\nis clear and those longer wavelengths\ncan also impart a positive influence on\nthe vitamin D pathway okay so if you're\nconcerned about wearing sunscreen\nbecause you're worried that it's going\nto impair your vitamin D synthesis or\nmetabolism in any way probably no reason\nto be concerned now if you're somebody\nwho is in The Beekeeper category who's\ncompletely avoiding sun exposure for\nwhatever reason well then you probably\nwant to get your vitamin D levels\nchecked and you may want to rely on\nsupplementation or something of that\nsort at the same time because of\nvariation in genetic background there\nwill even be some of you out there who\nare super anti-s sunscreen who are\npeeling your shirts off all the time who\ngetting lots of sun exposure who may\nsurprisingly have vitamin D levels that\nare still low that's rare okay for all\nthe obvious reasons but it could still\nbe the case and indeed some of the\ndermatologists that I spoke to said they\noccasionally have a patient like that\nvitamin D as you may recall is involved\nin a bunch of different things it acts\nas a hormone it's involved in calcium\nabsorption it's involved in some of the\nother hormone Pathways and I should\nmention that there's a study I'll link\nto this in the show note captions that\nshows that some amount of sunlight\nexposure to the skin this is an Israeli\nstudy where they had people you know get\nseveral tens of minutes of sunlight\nexposure in the afternoon during\nparticular times of year uh they didn't\nhave them going naked outside okay this\nwas sort of like context and culturally\nappropriate um skin exposure to the\nupper body and to the legs could induce\nincreases in hormones such as\ntestosterone and estrogen which were\ncorrelated with it wasn't causal but it\nwas correlated with improvements in mood\nwell-being libido Etc well some of that\nprobably relates to testost Stone and\nestrogen synthesis directly again the\nskin as an endocrine organ okay there\nare certain elements within the cortinos\nsites skin cells that can literally\ncommunicate with some of the organs of\nthe body that produce testosterone and\nestrogen even some of the glands\npituitary Etc this is through a number\nof different stations it's not\nnecessarily direct but also through the\nsun's ability to impact the vitamin D\npathway that then impinges on those\ntestosterone estrogen and things like\nluteinizing hormone Pathways we don't\nhave time to go into into all this now I\ncovered this in an episode about\ntestosterone and estrogen you have\nhormones such as lutenizing hormone\nwhich then stimulate the gonads the\ntestes to the ovaries to make\ntestosterone Endor estrogen the skin is\na not so obvious player in this whole\nthing whereby external environmental\nstimuli such as the availability of\nsunlight which in most places in the\nworld varies across the year can\nstimulate more or less vitamin D\nproduction luteinizing hormone\nproduction that can hinge on\ntestosterone and estrogen\nproduction these pathways are one of the\nreasons why when we get the right amount\nof sunlight not too little not too much\nwe feel better we feel better because\ncertain hormones are being produced at\ncertain levels when we're getting that\nsun exposure and when we don't get that\nsun exposure we have lower levels of\nthose hormones this is well established\nand the study that I linked to in the\nshow note captions which I've covered in\nprevious episodes is but one example of\nthat phenomenon okay let's talk about\nsunscreens now the reason I changed my\ntone of voice voice with this is that if\nyou look on the internet you will see\nclaims that I don't use or believe in\nsunscreen that is just false I've worn\nsunscreen my entire life I don't\nnecessarily wear every day I don't tend\nto burn easily okay I have some natural\nlevel of pigmentation in my skin based\non my genetics as I mentioned earlier\nbut as we talked about earlier just\navoiding sunburn is not going to protect\nme or anyone else against certain\nsun-induced mutations in skin cells and\nthe aging effects that sun can have so I\ndo believe in certain sunscreens meaning\nI will put sunscreen on on certain days\non certain parts of my\nbody however I do believe now having\nspoken to multiple\ndermatologists and looked into the\nliterature very deeply that there are\ncertain chemicals in certain sunscreens\nthat are of concern I don't mean that if\nyou put these on once or even twice that\nyou are going to suffer negative\nconsequences I mean they are of concern\nmeaning we should pay attention to them\nand when given the option we should opt\nfor the healthier choices and in fact\nthere are known healthier choices to\nmake all of this very clear I'm going to\ntell you what is very clear to the\nDermatology community at this point in\ntime okay in June of 2024 here's what we\nknow there are two major types of\nsunscreens out there well really three\nwe talked about physical barrier before\nno one argues about a physical barrier\nno one's worried about the chemical\ncompos I of physical barriers okay when\nwe talk about sunscreen so lotions\ncreams sprays Etc there are two major\ntypes the first are organic types which\nis essentially chemical sunscreens okay\nso when you hear organic sunscreens that\nmeans chemical type sunscreens and then\nthere are inorganic types which are\nsometimes referred to as mineral-based\nsunscreens here's what most everybody\nseems to accept that mineral-based\nsunscreens meaning sunscreen that tend\nto include either zinc oxide or titanium\ndioxide or both in some cases are\ngenerally thought to be safe up to\nconcentrations of 25% 25% is a pretty\nhigh concentration you can find\nsunscreens out there that have 25% zinc\noxide or 25% titanium dioxide they're\nrare to find however more often you'll\nfind sunscreens that have 15% 10% 18%\nzinc oxide sometimes alone or in\ncombination with titanium dioxide you'll\nfind some pure titanium dioxide\nsunscreens out there alth those are a\nbit more rare right a little bit harder\nto find here's the story zinc oxide and\ntitanium dioxide reflect back UV light\nthose short wavelengths of light that\nwould otherwise potentially cause\nmutations in your skin cells at the\nlevel of the epidermis okay in the\noutermost layers of skin remember short\nwavelength light doesn't pass very\ndeeply into the skin sunscreens\ncontaining zinc oxide Andor titanium\ndioxide were engineered for that\nspecific purpose to reflect back UV\nlight this is very different than\norganic or chemical sunscreens which\ncontain certain compounds these Go by\ndifferent names\noxybenzone avobenzone there are a bunch\nof these different chemicals that are\ncontained in so-called organic or\nchemical sunscreens those chemicals in\ngeneral don't serve to reflect back UV\nlight but rather absorb UV light okay so\nwhen they're applied to the skin they're\ndesigned to absorb the UV light so that\nthe UV light can't negatively impact the\nskin those chemical again chemical AKA\norganic components within organic\nsunscreens again sometimes called\nchemical sunscreens are designed to\nabsorb UV light mineral-based sunscreens\nso-called inorganic sunscreens\ncontaining things like zinc oxide or\ntitanium dioxide are designed to reflect\nback UV light why am I telling you this\nwell I'm telling you this because it's\ngenerally believed that the zinc oxide\nand titanium dioxide containing\nsunscreens are safe up to concentrations\nof 25% whereas there is some again some\nconcern about the chemicals within\nchemical AKA organic sunscreens as\npotential endocrine disruptors so\ndisrupting things like testosterone\nsynthesis estrogen synthesis and other\nhormones it's not all just about\ntestosterone and estrogen folks other\nhormone Pathways that many people\nincluding some governing bodies and\nagencies that assess the safety of\ndifferent cosmetic and sunscreen\nproducts are concerned about now how\nconcerned they are depends on where you\nare in the world okay so in Europe they\nhave different stringencies for what is\nconsidered safe versus unsafe or just of\nconcern as opposed to in the US here's\nwhat every dermatologist in the US\nbecause those are the ones I spoke to\ntold me which is that it is advised that\non children younger than 6 months of age\nyou do not use chemical based B\nsunscreens why well young skin even the\nskin on the external part of the body in\nchildren 6 months or younger acts more\nlike mucosal skin in that it can very\neasily absorb things transdermally\nthrough the skin however even as we age\nso into puberty our young adult years\nand even into our elderly years there is\nstill a capacity for things to pass\ntransdermally through the skin although\nbecause of some of the additional\nbarriers formed within the dermal and\nepidermal layers of the skin like\nextracellular Matrix the changes in\ncollagen Etc there is less tendency for\ncompounds to pass transdermally through\nthe skin now that just simply highlights\nthe fact that if you are a very young\nperson or if you're applying sunscreen\nto a very young person maybe six months\nor younger but also perhaps older\ndepending on how careful you want to be\nto avoid these chemical-based\nsunscreens there is very little if any\nevidence that the mineral-based\nsunscreens are of concern for\ntransdermal pass into the skin at\nconcentrations of 25% or less meaning\nsunscreens containing zinc oxide and\ntitanium dioxide are probably safe or at\nleast have been deemed safe enough that\nthey are freely available on the market\nand we are told that they are safe for\npeople of all ages so if you are\nsomebody who is concerned about the\nchemicals in sunscreen most every\ndermatologist or chemist who works on\nsunscreens will tell you well\nmineral-based inorganic sunscreens are\ngoing to be your safer option if you're\nconcerned but get this the\nchemical-based sunscreens while some of\nthe chemicals in them indeed can be\nquite scary when you read the literature\nyou look at some of these things like\noxybenzone um avobenzone and some\nsimilar chemicals even at low\nconcentrations have been shown to be\nendocrine disruptors people talk about\nhow the fact when they apply these\nsunscreens they can taste them in their\nmouth there's a lot of fear around these\nand some of that fear is substantiated\nwhen one goes and looks at the studies\nthat have been done on these\nchemical-based sunscreens you may find\nit interesting to note that the way\nthese studies were done often involves\nhaving people apply a ton of these\nchemical-based sunscreens like two full\nbottles of these sunscreens over the\ncourse of a very short period of time\nand then have their blood drawn and then\nit's revealed that some of these\nchemical components are within the blood\nso a big issue that's not often\ndiscussed because it's very difficult to\ncontrol for in a natural setting but is\nstraightforward to control for in a\nlaboratory setting is how much sunscreen\none is applying and how often and across\nhow many years of time so there's no\nreal prescriptive that can tell you hey\nif you put chemical sunscreens on once\nthat's problematic although certainly\npay attention to that six months and\nyounger what is essentially a rule that\nI mentioned earlier and do not put\nchemical based sunscreens on really\nyoung kids you might want to avoid them\nentirely depending on how stringent you\nare about this stuff but when it comes\nto chemical based sunscreens personally\nI avoid them but then it becomes a\nquestion of if you could only use a\nchemical based sunscreen you simply look\nat the label some of these have by the\nway zinc oxide titanium oxide and\nchemical based components okay keep that\nin mind some are purely mineral based\nsome are purely chemical based but if\nyou look at a sunscreen label you know\nokay well this is the only thing\navailable on this very hot day with a\nvery high UV index and otherwise I'm\ngoing to get a burn well if you're\nreally concerned then I would resort to\na physical barrier if you are less\nconcerned then you could perhaps tell\nyourself okay you get to put it on that\nday but you might not want to use it\nevery day and you might want to use a\nsmall volume of it right or maybe just\non parts of your face or your ears or\nyour neck that are particularly\nsensitive to Sun okay these are the\nthings that need to be taken into\nconsideration but when we step back from\nall of this all of the literature\nincluding by the way some of the\nliterature that assessed and I'll put a\nlink to this review a review on the\npotential neurotoxicity of titanium\ndioxide nanoparticles I'll get into this\nin a moment it has been explored whether\nor not titanium dioxide is more risky\nthan zinc oxide talk about that in a\nmoment but when you step back from all\nof this here's what you get physical\nbarrier no one argues About That No One\nBelieves that clothing is dangerous per\nse when it comes to avoiding excessive\nsun exposure again excessive relates to\nyour skin tone your background genetics\nyour activities and where you are in the\nworld and what time of year okay very\nspecific to your needs very few folks\nare concerned about mineral based\ninorganic sunscreen so if you want to\nuse sunscreen as many people do and you\nwant to make sure that it's not an\nendocrine disruptor and it's not a\nneurotoxin or something else that's been\nraised for some of these chemical-based\nsunscreens well then find a sunscreen\nthat has 25% less zinc oxide and or\ntitanium dioxide if you were a bit more\nconcerned about say titanium dioxide and\nsome of the suggestive evidence only\nsuggestive evidence that maybe titanium\ndioxide is more risky than zinc oxide\nespecially when it's in its Nano form\nthe very small form that may indeed\nallow it for more easy Passage through\nthe layers of the skin that transdermal\npassage will then find a sunscreen that\nis purely zinc oxide sunscreen and again\nthey always have other things in them\nbut what I mean is the only active\ningredient in a zinc oxide only\ncontaining sunscreen is zinc oxide and\nthen there are a bunch of other things\nthat allow it to be a lotion for\ninstance again up to 25% concentration\nwhy would somebody not want to use zinc\noxide containing sunscreen up to 25% and\nopt for anything else you might ask\nright if that's considered safe the\nreason is the consistency of the zinc\noxide is it's pretty sticky and thick\nand it's kind of pasty right back in the\n80s and 90s some of you may recall that\nhad um zinc oxide um sunscreens that\nwould actually you know color the nose\nwhite so you could really see it was\nreally prominent on the face they tried\nto turn that into a fashion statement\ndidn't go over so well over time but in\nany case the addition of titanium\ndioxide to those zinc oxide containing\nsunscreens allow it to be a bit silkier\nso that it would spread on more evenly\nand then you may say well why even put\nchemicals in sunscreen at all if there's\nrisk the reason why chemical-based\norganic sunscreens even exist is that\nthey can come up with compositions of\nthose sunscreens that are very silky and\nthat could spread on clear over makeup\nand things of that sort but there are\nthese concerns about some of those\nchemical components as endocrine\ndisruptors and potentially as mutagens\nthat could cause other issues or you\nknow any number of different things you\nyou know you can find all sorts of\nconcerns out there on the internet most\nof those concerns are not substantiated\nbut these chemicals can be problematic\nat high concentrations and that takes us\nback to the point made earlier which is\nthat in the studies of those chemicals\nand the reasons in some cases being\nbanned in certain countries and other\ncountries carrying uh warning\nrecommendations the amount of those\nchemical-based sunscreens that were\napplied was exceedingly high so if\nyou're wearing sunscreen very often\nyou're wearing a lot of it probably best\nof year towards a mineral-based\nsunscreen if you are concerned at all\nabout the chemicals in chemical based\nsunscreen wear a mineral based sunscreen\nand or use physical barrier and if\nyou're somebody who just doesn't believe\nthat sunscreens are safe whatsoever well\nyou know as far as I know it's a free\nworld you don't have to wear sunscreen\nbut then I would say you need to be very\naware of the fact that sun can induce\nthe appearance of accelerated aging in\nthe skin right that's an actual process\nthat takes place there's really no\ndebating that frankly and sun exposure\ncan potentially accelerate or even give\nrise to certain skin Cancers and nobody\nwants that okay before we move on to a\ndiscussion about what can be done to to\nincrease the youthfulness of our skin or\nthe appearance of youthfulness in our\nskin we need to have a bit more\ndiscussion about skin cancers notice I\nsaid skin cancers plural because there\nare many different forms of skin cancer\nsome of them relate to sun exposure as\nwe discussed earlier others do not and\nin fact some of the more deadly skin\ncancers are independent of sun exposure\nthey can relate to genetics and to other\nfactors so the most straightforward\nstory about all of this is that\napproximately 80 to 90 % of melanomas\nwhich are skin Cancers and they are very\nserious skin cancers that can indeed be\nvery deadly arise in what's called\ndenovo skin denovo skin is non mole skin\nnow does that mean that you should not\npay attention to the shape and any\nchanges in your moles no you absolutely\nshould but for people who have naturally\ndarker pigmentation everywhere or who\nhave very few\nmoles then you aren't going to be able\nto use the monitoring of your moles as\nthe only readout of potential\ndevelopment of skin cancer and frankly\neverybody should be thinking about these\nmore serious skin cancers independent of\nmoles or changes in moles here are a\ncouple things that everyone should pay\nattention to if you have a pimple like\nlesion or you have any kind of spot on\nyour skin that seems like it's an acne\nthat's lasted more than a month or you\nhave an area that's seeping something\nthat might look like plasma or pus or\nblood and it persists over a long period\nof time like a month or more\nabsolutely get that checked out by a\ndermatologist okay don't wait any longer\nthan a month get it checked out in\naddition it's highly recommended that\nyou go in and you get your moles checked\nby a dermatologist and frankly that you\nget all of your skin checked by a\ndermatologist at least once per year\nthis is going to really protect you\nagainst both the sun-induced skin\nCancers and other forms of skin cancer\nthe most common form of sun exposure\ninduced cancers are basil cell\ncarcinomas and indeed those are less\ndeadly many of the melanomas but they\nstill can be exceedingly problematic and\nthey can be deadly so it's very\nimportant to get these checked out now\nthere are websites and I'll provide a\nlink to one of them in the show note\ncaptions for which you can look at a\nbunch of different examples of different\nmoles and how they change over time and\nif you happen to have a mole that\nresembles the appearance of any of the\nmoles in that image gallery then you\nwould be wise to go to a dermatologist\nright away because it could be again\ncould be cancer of some sort you do not\nwant to let these things linger for too\nlong at the same time many people get\nconcerned about one mole that didn't\nhave an irregular border and then\nsuddenly has an irregular border there\nare a lot of different features as\nyou'll learn from the website or if you\ntalk to your dermatologist that relate\nto whether or not something is\npredicting skin cancer or has become\nskin cancer it's not just irregular\nborder it's changes in size certainly\nchanges in pigmentation vascularization\nbleeding any kind of seeping there are a\nlot of different things there so don't\nbe alarmed at first appearance of one of\nthese things but do take it seriously\nand keep in mind that there are things\nthat your dermatologist can do to help\nprevent certain skin cancers so for\ninstance there's a growing Trend now\namong dermatologists to suggest laser\nresurfacing of skin that is a laser used\nto essentially disrupt that epidermal\noutermost layer turn it over so that it\nregenerates because it can indeed\nregenerate to create new cells there\nkeep in mind that UV light and other\nfactors in the environment can cause\nmutations within that skin layer\nsometimes they're caused by genetic\nfactors but often environmental factors\nlike sun and chemicals and other things\nand by encouraging turnover of that skin\nlayer through laser resurfacing which by\nthe way may also increase the sort of\nyouthfulness appearance of your skin so\nmany people are motivated to do it for\nthat reason can dramatically reduce the\nincidence of certain kinds of skin\ncancer in fact the dermatologist I spoke\nto who's an expert in Derm oncology okay\ncancers of the skin said that laser\nresurfacing can cause a 30% reduction in\nskin cancers because of this ability to\nrejuvenate that epidermal layer and\nthat's especially true for areas of the\nbody like the face ears neck tops of the\nhands etc for which the sun often\ninduces the most damage because those\nare the most exposed parts of the body\non a regular basis and by the way this\nwhole thing about skin cancer is not a\ntrivially small number it's a big number\nin the us alone there are up to four\nmillion cases per year of what's called\nSquam cell carcinoma one of these forms\nof skin cancer so getting checked out by\na highly qualified dermatologist on a\nyearly basis maybe even more if you're\nreally concerned about this because you\nhave a lot of familiar\ngenetically inherited skin cancers\nthings of that sort is really highly\nadvised I'd like to take a brief break\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors\nelement element is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need that means\nthe electrolyt sodium magnesium and\npottassium in the correct amounts and\nratios and nothing you don't which means\nno sugar now I and others on this\npodcast have talked about the critical\nimportance of hydration for proper brain\nand body functioning even a slight\ndegree of dehydration can diminish\ncognitive and physical performance it's\nalso important that you get adequate\nelectrolytes the electrolytes sodium\nmagnesium and potassium are critical for\nthe functioning of all the cells in your\nbody especially your neurons your nerve\ncells drinking element dissolved in\nwater makes it very easy to ensure that\nyou're getting adequate hydration and\nadequate electrolytes to make sure I'm\ngetting proper amounts of hydration and\nelectrolytes I dissolve one packet of\nelement in about 16 to 32 ounces of\nwater when I wake up in the morning and\nI drink that basically first thing in\nthe morning I'll also drink element\ndissolved in water during any kind of\nphysical exercise I'm doing especially\nin hot days when I'm sweating a lot\nlosing water and electrolytes they have\na bunch of different great tasting\nflavors of element my favorite is the\nwatermelon although I confess I also\nlike the raspberry and the Citrus\nbasically I like all the flavors and\nelement has also just released a new\nline of canned sparkling element so\nthese aren't the packets you dissolve in\nwater these are cans of element that you\ncrack open like any other canned drink\nlike a soda but you're getting your\nhydration and your electrolytes with no\nsugar if you'd like to try element you\ncan go to drink element El spelled l\nmn.com huberman to claim a free element\nsample pack with the purchase of any\nelement drink mix again that's drink\nelement.com huberman to claim a free\nsample pack now with respect to\neverything we've talked about about sun\nexposure sunscreen and skin cancer I'd\nbe remiss if I didn't discuss a study\nthat's often used kind of as a wedge or\na weapon in the online debates about sun\nexposure skin cancer and mortality and\nthe title of this study is quote\navoidance of sun exposure as a risk\nfactor that's right sun exposure as a\nrisk factor for major causes of death a\ncompeting risk analysis of the melanoma\nin southern Sweden cohort so the basic\ndesign of the study was to evaluate\npeople's self-reported amount of sun\nexposure across many years and then to\ncorrelate that with all cause mortality\nand then to relate it to different\ncauses of disease in particular\ncardiovascular death compare this to\nsmokers keep in mind that some of the\npeople who were reporting their sun\nexposure were smokers some weren't\nand the conclusion of this study that\nDrew a lot of attention and continues to\ndraw a lot of attention is the following\nquote and here I quote from the abstract\nnonsmokers who avoided sun exposure had\na life expectancy similar to smokers in\nthe highest sun exposure group okay I'm\ngoing to repeat that non-smokers who\navoided sun exposure had a life\nexpectancy similar to smokers in the\nhighest sun exposure group so what many\npeople take this to con clude is that\navoiding sun exposure is as dangerous as\nsmoking okay that's not the conclusion\nthat I'd like you to take away because\nwhat this study basically shows is and\nhere I continue quote compared to the\nhighest sun exposure group life\nexpectancy of avoiders of sun exposure\nwas reduced by 0.6 to 2.1 years so way a\nsecond can this really be true that\npeople that are avoiding sun exposure\nhave a low life expectancy than people\nwho get sun exposure and indeed in this\nparticular study that does seem to be\nthe case but the interpretation of this\nis not completely straightforward here's\nwhat we know getting some degree of sun\nexposure appears to be good for life\nexpectancy that is true but is it\ndirectly related to sun exposure that's\na critical question and is the increased\nsun exposure that one gets if you do get\nsun exposure linked to other issues in\nparticular the development of melanoma\nas you recall melanoma was even in the\ntitle of the study so here's how I think\nwe should think about this study it does\nappear that getting sun exposure is\ncorrelated with longer life expectancy\nbut there could be any number of\ndifferent reasons for that for instance\npeople that are getting regular sun\nexposure presumably are also enhancing\nactivation of the vitamin D Pathways\nwhich is related to any number of\ndifferent things they no doubt are\nexperiencing increased feelings of\nwell-being I talked about papers that\nhave substantiated that earlier and\nfrankly we didn't even need a scientific\nstudy to substantiate that although it's\nalways great to have it we know that\nbeing out in sunshine for some period of\ntime each day as long as we don't get\nburned in the sun feels good why does it\nfeel good it leads to the production of\ntestosterone estrogen some of the\nendorphins that generally make us feel\ngood it is directly related to the\npathways associated with dopamine\nrelease there's a whole story there\nabout seasonality both in humans and\nother animals about dopamine synthesis\nwhen we get sunlight there's elevated\ndopamine and serotonin and testosterone\nand estrogen and feelings of well-being\nand libido this is all well\nsubstantiated in animal models and\nhumans so getting sun exposure makes\npeople feel good when people feel good\nthey tend to be lower stress when people\nare feeling good and they have energy\nbecause there indeed is a direct\nrelationship between sun exposure\nespecially to the eyes early in the day\nand our feelings of elevated mood and\nalertness and energy they tend to\nexercise more walk more and of course if\nyou're outside exercising more walking\nmore cycling swimming you're also going\nto get more sun exposure and we know\nthat exercise is strongly related to\nimproved or extended life expectancy\nokay so the study basically says getting\nsunlight as opposed to very little\nsunlight is good for life expectancy but\nit doesn't say get too much sunlight\nright because and this is interesting it\nis very clear that the people who lived\nlonger because they were getting more\nsunlight also tended to have more\ncancers including melanoma but this is a\nvery important point it's also the case\nthat the longer one lives the more\nlikely you are to develop a cancer okay\nso as you can see these studies that\nmany people just draw one\nstraightforward conclusion from such as\npeople who get less sun exposure don't\nlive as long as people to get more sun\nexposure well that's true but when you\nget more sun exposure very likely you're\ndoing other things like exercise and\nfeeling better that relate to living\nlonger so it's very difficult if not\nimpossible to isolate one single\nvariable in this case sun exposure as\nthe key variable however I'm happy to go\non record saying that we know from so\nmany studies of animal models and humans\nthat sun exposure especially early day\nsun exposure when the sun is low in the\nsky to set your circadian rhythm and\nlate day sun exposure okay I'm not\ntalking about middle of the day getting\nbaked in the Sun and you know sunburned\nor things of that sort but around the\ntime of sunset especially sun exposure\nto the eyes is powerfully modulating\nyour circadian rhythm to elevate daytime\nmood focus and alertness and improv\nsleep both of which are strongly\ncorrelated with improvements in mental\nhealth immune system function feelings\nof well-being enhanced cognition I mean\nthere's this whole story about people\nwith Alzheimer's and disruptions in\ncircadian rhythms and sleep so sun\nexposure to the eyes in terms of setting\ncircadian rhythm\npowerful powerful Improvement of life\nexpectancy and immediate health sun\nexposure to the skin no doubt very\npowerful positive modulators of certain\nhormone and neuromodulator Pathways such\nas dopamine testosterone estrogen and so\nforth that make people feel good and do\nthings generally that are good for them\nokay generally not all the things people\ndo with elevated dopamine testosterone\nand estrogen are good for them we know\nthat for sure but getting some sunlight\nthat is some appropriate dosage of\nsunlight especially to the eyes ear in\nthe day don't stare at the sun don't\ndamage your eyes but getting some of\nthat sun exposure to your eyes early in\nthe day and some to the skin especially\nin the early and later part of the day\nclearly is positively correlated with\nvarious Health metrics in terms of\nmental health and physical health and\nnot surprisingly with lifespan so I\nmentioned the study because I do think\nit's very interesting right I think it's\nreally interesting that people who\ncompletely avoid sunlight are not living\nas long as people who get some sun\nexposure and some of this actually is on\npar with what's experienced with\ncigarette smoking I think something that\neveryone agrees is negative in terms of\nlife\nexpectancy and certainly is not good for\na great number of different systems\nwithin the brain and body but I think\nthe study sometimes is used to highlight\nthe wrong conclusion which is that\nsunlight itself is extending lifespan I\nthink that that very simple conclusion\ncan be taken too far and can start to\nnegate some of the equally important\nmessages about excessive sunlight\nexposure causing certain problems as it\nrelates to skin cancers which we talked\nabout earlier as it relates to things\nthat you can do in order to offset some\nof that risk with if I were to suggest a\nphysical barrier if you need it a\nchemical based sunscreen if you choose\nto use sunscreen and of course that's an\nindependent choice that each of us have\nto make for ourselves okay let's talk\nabout youthfulness of skin or the\nappearance of youthfulness in skin\nbefore I did this episode I put the call\nout on social media for questions about\nskin and skin health and I must say that\nthe vast majority of questions related\nto this topic and it's a very\ninteresting one because it relates to a\nlot of decisions that people are making\nabout what to do what to buy or not BU\nas the case may be and it is an\nenormous probably hundreds of billions\nof dollars industry if not trillion\ndollar industry over time this business\nof devices products and procedures to\ntry and reverse aging or the appearance\nof Aging in skin or even create denovo\nnew synthesis of collagen and skin and\nother things to make skin look more\nyouthful okay so if we step back from\nthis whole area we have to ask ourselves\nwhat do we know for sure about what\nmakes skin look youthful and what can be\ndone to make skin look more youthful and\nto understand the answers to those\nquestions we simply have to go back to\nthe beginning of today's discussion for\njust a moment remember that we have the\nEP dermal layer of skin we have the\ndermal layer of skin where you have the\nvascul the blood vessels and capillaries\nyou have the nerve inputs there and you\nhave a bunch of different cell types in\nthere the cartinos sites you have\ndifferent proteins within those cells\nlike collagen elastin that over time can\nyes be mutated by things like UV rays\nfrom the Sun but that over time tend to\nlose their elasticity which leads to\nwrinkles and sagging skin you also have\nthis issue of hydration of the skin\nright the skin has a lot of watery\ncomponents within it actual water within\nit and those watery components are what\ngive it its kind of plump moist look\nsmooth look as opposed to desiccated you\nknow sagging wrinkled look to speak in\nextremes and there are hundreds if not\nthousands of different chemicals out\nthere that dermatologists as well as\ncosmetic surgeons as well as just you\nknow frankly manufacturers of products\nassert are going to be good for skin so\nlet's talk about where there is a lot of\nevidence for certain things that you can\ndo if your goal is to increase the\nyouthfulness or the appearance of\nyouthfulness in your skin and one of the\nmain ones is collagen itself now I have\nto admit I was very surprised when I\nlooked at this literature but I was\npositively surprised here's why as you\nknow there are various macronutrients\npresent in foods you can have proteins\nfats and carbohydrates when we ingest\nproteins such as beef chicken fish eggs\nas well as some vegan sources of\nproteins like beans or lentils or tofu\nthings of that sort they contain\ndifferent amounts of different essential\namino acids and those essential amino\nacids and other amino acids are used as\nthe building blocks for proteins in our\nmuscles in our tendons in essentially\nall the organ systems of our body the\nlipids are also used for cell membranes\nEtc okay this has been discussed various\ntimes on this podcast before people like\nDr Lan Norton Dr Gabrielle lion and\nothers it's well established that when\nthese proteins are broken down in the\ngut some of those amino acids go and\nserve for the purpose of tissue repair\nothers are for the purpose of other\nthings what most people in the field of\nnutrition agree upon and what certainly\nI believe is that if you were to say eat\na little bit of liver right you might\nhave a little bit of cooked liver or a\nlittle bit of skeletal muscle in the\nform of like a steak that there's no\nselective trafficking of the amino acids\nthat are broken down from the liver that\nyou eat to your liver right so when you\nhear that eating liver supports your\nliver it may do that by the broad\nprocess of certain amino acids and\nvitamins and lipids Etc serving your\nliver and other organ and tissue systems\nof the body but not selectively your\nliver however when we talk about\ncollagen this protein that forms one of\nthe most essential aspects of what makes\nour skin what it is which is elastic and\nyou know and and to have some tensile\nstrength where we can push on it it\nreturns to its uh original position\nespecially if if it's well hydrated and\nmakes our skin very youthful in\nappearance when we're young and then as\nit degrades when we get old makes it\nlook less youthful wrinkles and sagging\nand so forth well then why would eating\ncollagen protein which can come from any\nnumber of different sources it can come\nfrom fish sources it can come from\nBelieve It or Not animal hoof sources\ncan come from any number of different\nsources tendon Etc why would ingesting\ncollagen be selectively trafficked to\nthe collagen in our skin right that\ndoesn't square with everything we know\nand yet when you look at studies\nincluding metaanalyses of studies where\npeople supplement with collagen powders\nand these powders typically come from\nfish or tendon any number of different\nsources when people do this and then\nmeasures are taken as to skin appearance\nskin elasticity there are a bunch of\nmeasures that could be done in humans in\nthe laboratory to do this you often will\nfind studies that show statistically\nsignificant improvements in collagen\ncomposition and skin appearance and even\nthe appearance of reduction in wrinkles\nand so forth\nso this is an interesting exception\nwhere the ingestion of a particular\nprotein that naturally exists in\nabundance in certain tissues such as\nSkin but also other tissues like tendon\nligaments Etc seems to be assisting in\neither the repair and Rejuvenation of\ncollagen or perhaps some other aspect of\ncollagen synthesis that leads to\nimprovements in collagen composition and\nthe appearance of skin in humans that's\nvery interesting and the stud study that\nI find particularly interesting is one\nthat I'll link to in the show note\ncaptions it's entitled quote exploring\nthe impact of hydrolized collagen oral\nsupplementation on skin Rejuvenation a\nsystematic review and metaanalysis and\nthe basic takeaway of this and other\nmetaanalyses and the studies with in\nthis metaanalyses is that when people\nsupplement with anywhere from 5 to 15\ngrams okay grams of hydrolized collagen\nper day in particular in combination\nwith vitamin C it doesn't have to be a\nof vitamin C that one can observe okay\nnot always but can observe some visible\nimprovements in skin composition meaning\nless wrinkles even some reversal of\nwrinkles less skin sagging more youthful\nappearance more kind of um let's just\ncall it rebound elasticity of the skin I\nrealize that's not the appropriate\ntechnical term but uh the ability of the\nskin to bounce back from an indentation\nwhen you push down on it as opposed to\nsaying down or or sagging so some pretty\nimpressive results when one considers\nthat what people are basically doing\nhere is just mixing up some hydrolyzed\ncollagen protein and then uh drinking\nthat down once per day or so now that is\nnot to say that you have to supplement\nwith hydrolyzed collagen why well\ncollagen is also present in various\nFoods so for instance drinking bone\nbroth beef bone broth chicken bone broth\nis a rich source of collagen you can go\nonline and simply look up just by web\nsearch you can just say you know what\nfoods contain high levels of collagen\nand you'll get a list of things back\nthere hopefully a few of those are not\njust palatable to you but you actually\nlike and you can start to include those\nin your daily diet or you could\nsupplement with hydrolyzed collagen\nprotein there any number of different\nsources for these it's interesting that\nwhile indeed I don't believe and there\nis frankly zero evidence for Selective\ntrafficking of amino acids arising from\na particular organ source to that\nparticular organ when you ingest it it\nis interesting that consuming hydrolized\ncollagen in the form of a supplement or\nderiving it from foods like bone broth\nEtc does seem to be able to improve\ncollagen synthesis or the appearance of\nskin making it more youthful for those\nof you that are interested in ingesting\ncollagen peptides as a way to improve\nthe youthfulness of your skin should\nmention that the dosages there uh come\nin a Range depending on the studies that\nyou've looked at and the dermatologist\nthat I spoke to said if one decides to\ngo down this route of supplementing or\ngetting collagen from food sources you\nwant to aim for anywhere from 15 gam to\n30 gam of collagen peptide per day okay\nthat's a bit higher than what was used\nin a number of uh studies but you'll\nfind studies that use 30 grams and that\nthat whole process can be augmented can\nbe\nimproved through ingestion of 500 to\n1,000 milligrams of Vitamin C as well\nbut check the label on those collagen\npeptides that you might be supplementing\nwith because often times they already\ninclude that 500 to 1,000 milligrams of\nVitamin C I should also mention that the\ndermatologists I spoke to said that they\nlike collagen protein supplement ation\nnot just for the reasons discussed up\nuntil now but that they like them for a\nnumber of other reasons such as the\npotential anti-inflammatory effects of\ncollagen proteins to be honest I don't\nknow what the exact mechanism of that is\nmaybe if you get a certain protein\nthreshold the inflammation is down but\nanyway that's still cryptic to me but in\nany case they did describe some of the\npotential mechanisms by which collagen\ningestion can do its thing in terms of\nimproving youthfulness it's broken down\nin the blood into dipeptides and\ntripeptides which then are used within\nthe collagen itself of the skin this is\nthe hypothesis and that it can increase\nthe chemotaxis the mobility of\nfiberblast which make up some of the\nskin tissue and give rise to the\nappearance of more youthful skin there's\nalso evidence that ingestion of\nhydrolized collagen peptides can improve\nthe elasticity of the Skin Barrier on\nthe outside right make it look nice and\ntaut if I guess we say nice we're sort\nof passing subjective readout on this uh\nmake it appear taut um through the\nincrease of certain proteins unrelated\nto collagen such as filigran elastins\nEtc what about other peptides okay so\nthis is a big topic nowadays especially\nin the online communities I did an\nentire episode of this podcast about\npeptides keep in mind that insulin is a\npeptide OIC what is essentially an\nAgonist for glucagonlike peptide one\nthis is a very popular prescription drug\nnow for the treatment of obesity and for\nthe treatment of diabetes there there\nare lots of things that qualify as\npeptides a peptide is simply a small\nchain of amino acids a polypeptide is a\nbit longer chain of amino acids and then\nproteins are made up of amino acids okay\nso when we say peptides that means many\nmany things but these days when you hear\nabout quote unquote peptides especially\nin online communities generally people\nare referring to exogenously given okay\nso pills ointments or more typically\ninjections of peptides that are designed\nto achieve some specific biological or\nphysiological outcome and one of the\nmore common of these peptides being used\nnowadays is one that I've talked about\nbefore called bpc157 body protection\ncompound 157 which is essentially a\nsynthetic version of something found in\ngastric juice in all of us it's known\nthat certain peptides within the gut\nthat bpc 157 is known to mimic or\nactually is a synthetic version of that\nexact sequence or a portion of that\nsequence can assist in tissue and wound\nrepair of different kinds tendon\nanything involving fiber blast all of\nthat has been well demonstrated in vitro\nin a dish okay so not in Vivo as well as\nin Vivo in certain cases but only in\nanimal models to my knowledge there's\nonly one study and frankly it's not a\nvery good study at all on bpc157 in\nhumans and yet a lot of people are\ntaking bpc157 either orally in the form\nof a capsule or pill or more typically\ninjecting it what does it do or what\ndoes it likely do in humans we know from\nanimal models that pc-1 157 increases\nangiogenesis the growth of capillaries\nin blood vessels we know this it can\naccelerate wound healing by virtue of\nincreasing fibr blast motility for this\nreason it's used post injury in sports\nit's used by people who want to build\nmore muscle it's used by endurance\nathletes it's used for cosmetic purposes\nanytime people are using bpc157 for any\nof those purposes it's likely that\nthey're using it in part to increase the\nblood flow that's available to a given\ntissue and the repair of that tissue now\nagain I do want to caution people that\nthere is very little basically no\nevidence in humans besides the anecdotal\nevidence that people say they healed\nfaster what I do know is that anytime\nyou get vascularization of tissue you're\ngoing to get improved blood flow so it\nall makes sense mechanistically I also\nknow that vascularization due to bpc 157\neven if it's injected locally into a\ngiven tissue is likely to occur globally\nthroughout the body this is why some\npeople taking oral bpc157 or injecting\nit you know just subcutaneously at the\nlevel of you know their stomach a little\nbit you know Under the Skin at the level\nof their stomach report faster wound\nhealing even in a distal limb or like a\nhand or a nerve injury in their foot or\nsomething like that that also tells us\nthat there's going to be increased\nvascularization of other tissues such as\nSkin such as tumors if tumors exist so\nyou need to be very careful I need to\nsay that upfront as a cautionary note\nbecause it is very clear that many many\npeople are starting to either inject\nbpc157 or apply in the form of a topical\ncream in effort to get more\nvascularization of skin in order to make\nthat skin appear more youthful and more\nand more products are out there that\ncontain bpc157 I can't in good conscious\nrecommend those products I can only\noffer to you the likely mechanism by\nwhich they work if they work and also\noffer you the caveat that it is unclear\nthat bpc 157 can go transdermally if\nit's applied topically so if you put on\na say wrinkly portion of your face so\nlike I've got crow's feet crow's feet\ncome from either aging smiling or both\num you know crow's feet are the kind\nwrinkles that extend out the corners of\nyour eyes when you smile or for me\nbecause I'm you know 48 you know\nprobably do that even when I don't smile\nthe the logic would be that if you take\na cream containing bpc157 and you put it\non there that you'll get increased\nvascularization of that area delivery of\nmore growth factors in nutrients and\nthose wrinkles will either be halted in\ntheir aging progression or that they\nwill reverse that's the logic to my\nknowledge there are no clinical studies\nand I'd love to know from you if you've\ntried these products please put your\nexperience of those in the comments on\nYouTube so we can get a sense of whether\nor not people are having good um results\nwith this that of course is not a\ncontrolled study but I'm very curious as\nto know many of the products that\ncontain bpc157 by the way also contain\ncopper copper is a trace mineral it's\nfound in your diet there is some\nevidence that copper is important for\nsome of the collagen and other elements\nof skin synthesis Pathways and so the\nmechanistic logic and the biochemical\nlogic is there on paper however it's\nalso clear that ingesting too much\ncopper can induce an inflammatory\nresponse and would lead to the exact\nopposite desired effect that people who\nare using copper and usually copper bpc\ncontaining products are taking them for\nwhich is to Halt or reverse the\nappearance of Aging in their skin why am\nI going through this whole gymnastics of\nyou know bpc157 and copper well because\nnowadays many many products are starting\nto include quote unquote peptides for\nskin Rejuvenation and most often those\npeptides are of the copper variety of\nthe bpc 157 variety and often times also\nwith things related to collagen\nsynthesis sometimes collagen directly so\nyou'll find oral products that one takes\nby pill form that are bpc157\ncopper and or things that promote\nsynthesis of collagen you'll find\nointments that are pure bpc157 still\nunclear if those go transdermal okay so\nthis is still a very very young science\nand most of this is not being explored\nin randomized control trials however I\nknow some of you out there are pretty\nexperimental you like experimenting with\nthis kind of stuff you like hearing\nwhat's working for other people here's\nwhat I suggest if a sunscreen or a\nlotion or a pill or an injection is\nasserted to contain peptides to help\nwith skin Rejuvenation make sure you\nlook and see which specific peptides are\nincluded know the risks associated with\nbpc-157 it's uncertain risk about\nacceleration of tumor growth but the\nmechanistic logic is just as strong for\nthat with bpc-157 as it is for bpc157\nencouraging vascularization of any other\ntissue muscle tendon ligament or skin\nfor that matter so I'm not telling you\nwhat to do just know what you're doing\nand understand the likely mechanisms\nbehind it um in the absence of any of\nthese randomized controls trials I will\nsay in service to making sure that your\ndiet and/or supplementation includes\nenough Trace mineral copper copper has\nbeen shown to play a key role in DNA\nrepair which is a critical component of\nthe turnover of collagen and other\nproteins in skin it has been shown to\nreduce so-called reactive oxygen species\nso it serves as a so-called antioxidant\nand and this relates to what I just said\nreduced inflammation but too much copper\nis a problem so I wouldn't run out and\nstart supplementing with excessive\namounts of copper please don't do that\nbut you want to make sure that you're\ngetting sufficient amounts of copper\nfrom your diet and you can simply look\nup online what sufficient amounts of\ncopper are given it's a trace mineral\nand it's very likely that if you ingest\nany kind of supplement that is a\nmultivitamin mineral supplement or a\nfoundational nutrition supplement that\nincludes at least some copper so it's\nlikely that you're sort of quote unquote\ntopped off in terms of the amount of\ncopper that you need but very unlikely\nto be excessive amounts of copper but if\nyou start supplementing with copper\nbeyond that again you can induce an infl\ninflammatory response so it's a dosage\nuh kind of Middle Ground issue there you\ndon't want your copper too low you don't\nwant your copper too high you want it\nright there in the middle okay as I\nmentioned before we will talk about\nother components of food that are great\nfor skin health and we'll also talk\nabout components of certain foods like\nAdvanced glycation end products I don't\nknow if you've heard of those before but\nvery interesting not good stuff that you\nwant to avoid if you can especially if\nyour concern is youthful looking skin\nand healthy skin and frankly Health\noverall but before we do that I think\nit's worth paying attention to a few\nthings that you can potentially take\nthat can really improve the youthfulness\nof your skin for which there is\nexcellent science to support it okay so\nwhen I spoke to board certified\ndermatologists who trained at excellent\ninstitutions what people can do to\nimprove the youthfulness or the\nappearance of youthfulness In Their Skin\nand that there specifically be\npeer-reviewed studies to support their\nstatements they mentioned hydrolyzed\ncollagen protein in combination with\nvitamin C we talked about that earlier\nthey mentioned a bunch of dos and don'ts\nas it relates to sun exposure and\nnutrition Etc some of which we've\ncovered some of which we are yet to\ncover but will soon and they mentioned\nsupplementing with\nniacinamide niacinamide is a form of\nvitamin B3 it is also sometimes referred\nto as nicotinamide and I was told that\nwhen taken at twice per day at a dosage\nof 500 milligrams per dose for a total\nof 1 gram or 1,000 milligrams per day\nthat niacinamide supplementation can\nincrease the production of ceramides\nwhich relate to the lipids in skin that\nimprove the moisture in skin and by the\nway moisture in skin is a key component\nof the youthfulness or plump appearance\nof that skin and when I say plump I\ndon't necessarily mean outwardly rounded\nplump I mean the fact that the skin\nlooks like the outermost layer of the\nskin which you now know as the epidermis\nis kind of taut and the skin looks\nhydrated and smooth at the level of its\nouter appearance all of that\nis improved by niacinamide\nsupplementation but that the\nsupplementation has to be carried out\nfor 3 to six months or more before that\neffect is noticed now the origin of the\nniacinamide effect on the youthfulness\nof skin could also be related to the\nfact that there's evidence that\nniacinamide supplementation can reduce\ninflammation of skin overall we haven't\ntalked so much about the immune skin\nrelationship although as I alluded to at\nthe beginning of the episode this is a\nkey relationship but for those of you\nsuffering from rosacea from acne so\nrosacea being a rening of the skin we're\ngoing to talk more about it later and\nspecific things that can be done for it\nacne almost always involves some rening\noften painful rening of specific pox on\nthe skin sometimes even the appearance\nof you know pus-filled bumps this sort\nof thing that niacinamide\nsupplementation may also assist there\nbecause of the reduction in inflammation\nand we'll talk all about the\nrelationship between inflammation and\nacne regardless of whether or not you\nsuffer from rosacea acne or not at all\nthat ninite supplementation May benefit\nyou also because nicomide\nsupplementation appears to balance the\nlevel of oil production in the skin you\nneed oil in the skin you need oil down\nin those pores but not too much and that\nit can definitely help reduce the\nappearance of clogged pores and if\nyou're concerned about pores that appear\ntoo large this typically happens in the\nface around the nose on the upper cheeks\nalthough other regions of the body as\nwell nicomide supplementation May assist\nwith that as well there's also a number\nof people out there that are concerned\nwith specific spot spots that they see\nas hyperpigmented spots so regardless of\nwhether or not overall your skin is very\nlight or very heavily\npigmented supplementation with nicomide\ncan reduce the appearance of\naccumulation and maybe even the actual\naccumulation of melan in at particular\nspot so-called dark pigmented spots that\nsome people decide that they don't want\nfor whatever reason usually just\ncosmetic reasons although there may be\nreasons why hyperpigmentation in a given\narea could relate to skin cancers we\ntalked about that earlier another reason\nto go get not just your moles but all of\nyour skin checked at least once per year\nnow if you decide to supplement with\nniacinamide you have the option of\neither taking that th000 migs and 2 500\nMig dosages per day you also have the\noption of using any number of different\ntopical niacinamide ointments or serums\nthat exist out there keep in mind that\nmany skincare products already contain\nniacinamide so check the label and there\nthe dermatologists tell me that to be\neffective the nicomide needs to be\npresent at at least a two and as high as\n10% concentration within those ointments\nor serums keep in mind that many serums\nand ointments also contain what's called\nhyaluronic acid hyaluronic acid is a\nnatural component of the skin that\nprovides a physical substrate for\nholding in water so moisture within the\nskin it does a bunch of other important\nthings too within the extracell Matrix\nand elsewhere the regions between the\ncells that is and supplementation with\nhyaluronic acid or ointments or serums\nthat contain hyaluronic acid and\nniacinamide are pretty common out there\nbecause of the already stated effects of\nniacinamide and the fact that hyaluronic\nacid can serve as what's called a\nhumectant something that serves to S\nbarrier in moisture at the level of the\nskin okay so it gives that kind of um\nPlumping uh moist look of skin that's\ncharacteristic of youthful skin as\nopposed to aged skin the dermatologists\nand the cosmetic surgeons that work on\nfaces that I spoke to I told you I\nconsulted with a fairly large and\nDiversified Group of folks um in\npreparation for this episode all agreed\nthat supplementation with collag vitamin\nC niacinamide and hyaluronic acid was\nsomething that they suggest to their\npatients the other supplement well\nactually it's a prescription treatment\nmost often that dermatologists recommend\nif the goal is youthful appearing skin\nare things within the so-called retinoid\npathway such as retinol okay many of you\nhave perhaps heard of this and it's a\nwhole story related to the relationship\nbetween vitamin A and skin okay so\nTrenton Noah is the common name for it\nalthough some of you may know it as\nretina and prescription drugs that are\nsimilar to that are basically\nderivatives of vitamin A why why are\nthese used for skin care why are they\nused to increase the youthfulness of\nskin well vitamin A gets into skin cells\nand is converted into something called\nretin aldhy then into something called\nretinoic acid now very important to know\nthat retinoic acid is involved in a lot\nof different cellular processes\nespecially during neural development\nthis is why and please pay careful\nattention to this this is why women who\nare pregnant or breastfeeding should\navoid taking these products because it\ncan seriously disrupt the development of\nthe fetus okay and keep in mind that\nmany times people don't realize they're\npregnant for some period of time so this\nis of Paramount concern okay we could\nhave a whole discussion as to the role\nof retinoic acid in fetal development\nbut you don't want to tamper with that\npathway okay very serious consequences\ncan occur okay so when retinoic acid\ngets into cells it can activate what's\ncalled transcription factors\ntranscription factors bind to DNA okay\nyour genetic code and can induce the\ntranscription and translation of DNA\ninto RNA and RNA into proteins of\nparticular types so think of\ntranscription factors is sort of setting\na menu of different proteins that\nultimately will be formed okay by\nbinding to DNA and then you get DNA to\nRNA rnate a protein and you're getting a\nset of proteins related to a particular\nprocess that's generally how\ntranscription factors work and retina\nTreno and things similar to that are\ngoing to induce the formation of\ncollagen protein within skin as well as\nother proteins that relate to the\nformation of denovo skin new skin and\ncan replace old degenerated skin so the\ndermatologists that I spoke to were\nreally bullish about the fact that\nbelieve it or not they felt that people\nstarting in their 20s could very well as\nlong as they're not pregnant or\nlactating or planning to get pregnant\ncould take a or things similar to it in\norder to stimulate the production of\nmore skin and look more youthful now for\npeople already in their 20s you know by\nmy RAID they're already youthful but\nthat they could initiate the use of\nthese compounds at least in one's 20s\nand continuing on really as long as they\nwanted through life and they told me\nabout quote remarkable results so I said\nwell why isn't everyone aware of this\nwhy isn't everyone taking them well it\nturns out that these different compounds\ncan also increase sensitivity to life\nmake you more prone to sunburn to some\nof the other effects of light on skin\neven from screens or from artificial\nlights so one has to be careful about\ninducing too much skin sensitivity to\nlight of all kinds not just sunlight\nthat they can also induce some redness\nor dryness so one has to get the dosage\nright the frequency of use right they\ncan be a little bit tricky to work with\nbut that if one can home in on the right\ndosages the right frequency Etc the\ndermatologist felt like this was one of\nthe best things that one could do to\nimprove the youthfulness or the\nappearance of youthfulness in one's skin\nnow I find this interesting for a number\nof reasons first of all I've heard of\nretina right I've heard of these\ncompounds before um but I hadn't heard\nabout all these you know reportedly\nspectacular things like improved\nangiogenesis vascularization of the skin\nthis is why people are taking the rather\num experimental untested bpc157 that I\ntalked about before um the improved\nelasticity of skin which somehow seems\nrelated to the ability of these\ncompounds to remove degenerated elastin\nwithin the skin to clear that out as\nwell as to induce denovo synthesis and\neven the number of different fiber\nblasts that are present in skin so more\nnew skin clearing away of old skin\nimproved vascularization and while all\nof this sounds a little bit too good to\nbe true the mechanisms by which it's\nasserted to work all hold up so that's\nalways reassuring right mechanism isn't\neverything but it's really nice to see\nthere for instance these compounds are\nknown to get into the nucleus of cells\nright to impact gene expression and we\ntalked about that before you have\nreceptors on the surface of cells okay\nso cell surface receptors you also have\nnuclear receptors and the ability of\ncertain things we call them ligans but\nthese are chemicals right in this case\nyou know in the vitamin A pathway to get\ninto the nucleus of cells and impact\ngene expression this is actually how\nhormones like testosterone and estrogen\nchange the way that people look so\ndramatically during puberty they\nactually you know they operate by\nbinding the cell surface receptors they\nalso get into the nuclear compartment of\nthe cell they bind to nuclear receptors\nand they turn on entire genetic program\nthat cause for instance deepening of The\nVoice or the growth of hair or breast\ntissue Etc so these are powerful\ncompounds now I talked to a cosmetic\nsurgeon expert in face specifically uh\nremember cosmetic surgery is done for a\nnumber of different areas of the of the\nbody but for face specifically who also\nspecializes in these sorts of treatments\nfor skin and they've started using and\nare frankly quite confident in the use\nof retinoid Esters that can be applied\nto the surface of the Skins these things\nare available not by prescription\nthere's far less research on these sorts\nof compounds but these compounds get\nenough positive support from the people\nthat have tried them reporting improved\nyouthfulness of skin Etc that some of\nthem are becoming quite sought-after and\num people let's just say are very\nenthusiastic about them and I will say\nthat in discussing the various\nmechanisms of this with these cosmetic\nsurgeons and some dermatologists the\nlogic holds up so you're starting to see\nmore and more of these now as I\nmentioned at the beginning of today's\nepisode there is zero\nbusiness relationship between me the\npodcast or any of these um people that\nhave marketed serums or creams or\nprescription drugs for that matter\nrelated to skin health and skincare\nhowever I have provided a couple links\nin the show note captions of some of the\ndifferent sources of these obviously if\nyou need a prescription for something\nlike Trent noan or something similar\nbecause you're interested in this whole\nretinol retina um vitamin A pathway\nstory you need to talk to a board\ncertified dermatologist who could\npotentially prescribe that for you if\nthey decide it's right for you but in\nterms of these topical ointments and\nserums and creams and things like that I\ndo provide a link to at least one source\nof those that uses the retinoid Esther\njust keep in mind that these various\nointments and serums do not yet have the\nrandomized control trials to support\nthem that some of the other compounds\nthat we were discussing do have now I'd\nlike to talk about things that one can\ndo to improve the health and appearance\nof one's skin that don't involve taking\nanything or putting on any kind of\nointment or serum or anything like that\nand what I'm referring to is\nphototherapy now at the earlier part of\nthe episode I talked about how different\nwavelengths of light like UV light and\nlong wavelength light can penetrate skin\nto different depths and some of the\nnegative but also positive things that\nthat can do so for instance we talked\nabout UV light mutating DNA in cells and\npotentially causing cancers accelerating\nthe aging process and so forth but as\nyou also recall long wavelength light\nso-called red light and near infrared\nlight which is even longer wavelengths\nof light can penetrate deep into the\nskin tissue so pass that outer epidermal\nlayer into the dermal layers of the skin\nand can access the vasculature the\nneurons some of the glands located\ndeeper in the skin and of course the\ncells there like cells in the epidermis\nI should point out contain things like\nmitochondria for which red light has\nbeen shown to be beneficial why red\nlight and near infrared light\nphototherapy has been shown to reduce\nreactive oxygen spe species and thereby\nto improve mitochondrial function in\ncells and that in turn has been shown to\nbe beneficial for all the different\nprocesses within cells that involve\nmitochondria which of course include\nenergy production but a bunch of other\nthings too so when I say that photo\ntherapy has been shown to be beneficial\nfor cells of the body it's not just\ncells of the skin in fact a Nobel Prize\nwas granted in the early 1900s for the\nuse of phototherapy for the treatment of\nLupus so this is not a new technology at\nthe same time\nwhile there are many studies exploring\nthe use of phototherapy for improvement\nof skin health and appearance most of\nthose Studies have fairly low sample\nsizes but there are a lot of those\nstudies and fortunately by now there are\na few metaanalyses and reviews that take\ninto account lots of different studies\nusing slightly different wavelengths of\nlight appli to different portions of the\nface for different purposes treatment of\nacne U maybe even um putting red light\nnear infrared light on one half of the\nface to have a so-called within person\ncontrol to compare you know the changes\nin skin or lack of changes in skin as\nthe case may be between one side of the\nface and the other um I'll put links to\nsome of these studies and some of the\nmetaanalyses and reviews of these\nstudies one that I like in particular\nwas published in 2018 entitled light\nemitting diodes in dermatology a\nsystematic review of randomized control\nTrials of course randomized control\ntrials being one very powerful way to\nanalyze the utility of a practice or a\ncompound it's not the only way to assess\nthe utility of something I know some\npeople argue that they are very use ful\nbut keep in mind in the field of\nmedicine we often have entire fields or\neven entire chapters of medical books\nthat are based on case studies for\ninstance we implicate the so-called\nhippocampus of the brain for its\nfunction in human memory which it\nabsolutely has and that fact largely\nGrew From one major case study that then\nexploded into a number of different\nanimal model and then human studies\nlater on so we all love randomized\ncontrol trials reviews of randomized\ncontrol trials and the uses of the\nphototherapy for treatment of skin\nconditions and improving the quality of\nskin are wonderful and point to the fact\nthat phototherapy can indeed improve the\nappearance of skin in conditions like\nacne can accelerate wound healing can\nimprove the youthfulness appearance of\nskin but these effects tend to be\nsomewhat mild to moderate when they\noccur and certainly there are many\nstudies that show no significant effect\nno statistically significant effect that\nsaid I'm of the belief based on my read\nof the literature and this is a\nliterature I've spent a lot of time with\nfrankly because I did an episode all\nabout light and health I've also been\nvery interested in the use of\nphototherapy for the treatment of eye\ndiseases and offsetting age related\ndecline in visual function there's some\ninteresting evidence there again mild to\nmoderate effects but that can be\nmeaningful in the real world and when I\nstep back from all of the literature\nhere's what I see and this is what I ran\nby a dermatologist to make sure that\nthey they thought that this protocol\nwould be useful or not useful right I\nasked them I didn't tell them do you\nthink this will be useful tell me yes I\nasked them and what we basically\nconverged on was that if somebody\ndecides to do phototherapy the use of\nphototherapy that involves long\nwavelengths of light so red light Plus\nnear infrared light typically at a\ndistance of about a foot to 2 feet from\nthe light source depending on the\nintensity of the light source although\nthat doesn't seem to be so critical but\none can't be across the room from the\nred light source nor should one get\nright up next to the red light source so\nthat there's a lot of heat generated\nfrom the red light source that one can\nfeel but at a distance of about a foot\nto 2 feet away at fairly High\nintensities done for anywhere from 10 to\n15 minutes 5 to 7even days per week on a\nconsistent basis does seem on average to\nlead to improvements in the youthfulness\nappearance of skin why this would be the\ncase isn't exactly clear but there are\nnumber of different logical\ninterpretations such as reduced\ninflammation improved mitochondrial\nfunction all Downstream of reduced\nreactive oxygen species improved blood\nflow to that particular area because of\nthe effect that long wavelength light\ncan have on vasod dilation of expansion\nas opposed to contraction of blood\nvessels and capillaries all of this\nmakes mechanistic logical sense and the\neffects that one sees in these various\npeer-reviewed papers randomized control\ntrials seem pretty good meaning there\nare mild to moderate none of them are\nsort of jaw-dropping like wow complete\nreversal of severe acne or you know\nmassively accelerated wound healing and\nwe also of course have to take into\naccount that many people who are doing\nphototherapy often are combining it with\nother things sometimes in today's era\nlike injections of bpc-157 or the use of\nhyaluronic acid or niacinamide Etc so\nthese things aren't always being\nexamined in isolation but when we look\nat this literature I think it's fair to\nsay that there is now substantial\nevidence for the use of phototherapy y\nfor improving the quality of skin and in\nsome cases for reducing the symptoms of\nacne reducing the symptoms of psoriasis\nbasically any condition where improved\nblood flow lowered inflammation fewer or\nreduced oxygen species improved\nmitochondrial function delivery of\nnutrients anytime some or all of those\nthings are going to be involved\nphototherapy makes logical sense and so\nit's no surprise that we're seeing\nincreased evidence for phototherapy in\nthese conditions now I've provided a\nlink to the review of the random control\ntrials that I mentioned a bit ago I also\nprovided a few links to some specific\nstudies that show pictures of before and\nafter some cases on two sides of the\nvery same\nface I did an entire episode about light\nand health I'll also provide a link to\nthat episode and if you don't want to\nlisten to or watch that entire episode\nyou can go to specific um timestamps in\nthat episode to learn about the uses of\nphototherapy for the treatment of skin\neye and other conditions related to\nmental health and physical health now\nkeep in mind that when people hear\nphototherapy they almost immediately\nthink about a device and that makes\nsense right red light near infrared\nlight however if you recall there's this\nthing called the Sun that emits full\nspectrum light which of course\nincludes red light and longer\nwavelengths of light okay so just\nbecause you can't see those longer\nwavelengths of light that doesn't mean\nthey're not there just like UV light you\ncan't sense UV light with your eyes by\nthe way ground squirrels and some other\nanimals can it's thought to be the case\nthat they have photo receptors to detect\nUV because they actually this is sort of\nstrange but interesting you'll never\nforget this that they'll take their\nurine and they'll spread it on their\nstomach with their little paws and\nthey'll stand up and they'll like signal\nflash one another from across the\nPrairie or whatever it is across the\nlawn to signal to one another so they're\nsending uvp signals across the lawn I'm\nnot making this up I actually studied a\nlittle bit of this when I was an\nundergraduate but not at the level of\nthe urine and the signaling at the level\nof the retina any discussion about skin\nhas to include a discussion about\nnutrition why remember the fact that I\nmentioned at the beginning of today's\nepisode that your skin and your immune\nsystem have a very intimate relationship\nit's bidirectional your skin reflects\nthe status of your immune system in many\nways and this is why many people with\nautoimmune conditions things like lyan\nplanis you can look it up or if you you\nknow mind uh particularly you know\nstriking photographs please don't look\nit up but people that have autoimmune\nconditions that often manifests in skin\nconditions we'll talk more about this in\nthe context of psoriasis in a little bit\nbut anytime we're talking about the\nimmune system or skin we need to take\ninto account the gut microbiome and\nnutrition so many people asked what are\nthe things that they should eat to have\nhealthy appearing youthful\nskin they also asked what are the things\nthat one eats that could exacerbate\nthings like acne and what can one eat in\norder to reduce their acne so let's just\nstart off with the basics and here I'm\ngoing to be fairly brief because I think\nwe all know the big take-home message\nabout nutrition nowadays we hear over\nand over again and we should pay\nattention to the fact that the vast\nmajority of our food well I should say\nif one desires to be healthy mentally\nhealthy physically healthy and a high\nperforming individual in any number of\ndifferent things cognitive physical or\notherwise we want to consume the vast\nmajority of our foods from nonprocessed\nor minimally processed sources so-called\nWhole Foods so fruits vegetables if\nthat's within your diet some people\ninclude grains some people don't I'm not\nhere to discuss that meat eggs fish\nchicken and so forth if that's within\nyour diet plan or your nutrition or if\nyou're a vegetarian or vegan you make\nthe associated adjustment so that you\ncan make sure you're getting enough\nprotein and amino acids but it's in\nkeeping with your ethical and maybe your\nhealth goals okay so we're not here to\ndiscuss vegan vegetarian omnivore of\nwhich I am or carnivore okay that's not\nthe discussion I think all of those\ngroups agree that getting the majority\nof your nutrition from nonprocessed or\nminimally processed foods is going to be\nbest and that of course if you're human\nsometimes you'll ingest processed foods\nbut really trying to avoid highly\nprocessed foods is critical now with\nrespect to the specific foods that can\nimprove skin appearance and skin Health\nit's very clear that diets that are of\nthe so-called lowi inflammatory type\nthat don't spark inflammation so these\nwould be things that sometimes are\nreferred to as the Mediterranean diet or\na Paleo like Diet you hear these terms\nbut what what are we really talking\nabout mostly Whole Foods minimally\nprocessed foods okay and then there's\nvariation depending on whether or not\nyou emphasize or deemphasize meat and\nfish or emphasize or deemphasize\nvegetables this kind of thing again I'm\nan omnivore I love fruit I love\nvegetables I do like rice oatmeal and\nsome pastas I like a great sourdough\nbread I like butter I like olive oil I\nlike meat I like fish I think I am\nrepresentative of most people out there\nbecause I eat most all those things but\nI also eat the occasional croissant I\nalso eat the occasional slice of pizza I\ndon't eat a lot of that stuff but I eat\nit now and again and then of course you\nhave people that are super strict what\ndo we know about the relationship\nbetween specific foods and skin health\nand skin appearance well\nanti-inflammatory diet we've more or\nless spelled out what that represents\nwithout getting into too many specifics\nand then there are the specific\ncomponents within Foods so vitamins\nminerals and\nmicronutrients as well as things like\ncollagen present in bone broth that can\nbe really useful to include so one one\nof the I think best accounts on\ndermatologic health and skin health and\nappearance on the Internet is Dr Andrea\nSuarez she's a medical doctor board\ncertified dermatologist and she has a\nwonderful video that describes the\nvarious foods that one can eat to\npromote skin health and skin appearance\nand rather than repeat that entire video\nbecause a that wouldn't be right and B\num it already exists out there in\nexcellent form I'll just give a brief\nsynopsis of some of the things that she\nsuggests because I entirely agree and\nagain there's no need to be repetive\nand she does an excellent job so she\ncertainly mentions collagen and bone\nbroth she also mentions various sources\nof omega fatty acids that are often\nlacking in people's diets that they\nshould pay extra careful attention to\nget so things like walnuts flax fatty\nfish I personally am a big believer in\nsupplementing with liquid form fish oil\nthat's what I do why am I a big believer\nin that well I don't tend to cook much\nfatty fish I love the taste of it if\nit's prepared right but I don't tend to\ndo that very often so I use a liquid\nform fish oil or capsules but the liquid\nform is generally more affordable this\nwas discussed in episode that I did with\nDr Ronda Patrick so we can put a link to\nthat particular segment in the show note\ncaptions it's also suggested that we eat\na lot of leafy greens so dark leafy\ngreens you're probably noticing a lot of\nthese recommendations are kind of\ntypical for what people describe anytime\nthey're talking about nutrition for\nhealth she highly recommends people get\nenough folic acid for the role that\nfolic acid plays in DNA synthesis is and\nrepair of skin cells as among other\ncells and cell proliferation and of\ncourse we should get our colored fruits\nand veggies so our oranges our\nstrawberries the Reds and oranges are\ncritical out there and she also\nhighlights something very important that\nI want to reiterate which is that we\nhave a critical need for Vitamin A for\nour skin health and this was covered\nalbeit through the lens of exploring the\npharmacology of trentino and those retin\nA compounds but vitamin A is crucial for\na number of different processes with in\nthe cell types that make up skin she\nappropriately cautions against\nsupplementing with vitamin A because\nit's a fat soluble vitamin it's very\neasy to overdose vitamin A if one is\nsupplementing with too much of it she\nrecommends rather getting enough vitamin\nA from things like oranges carrot sweet\npotatoes she recommends as much Berry\nintake as is appropriate for someone and\none can afford the berries are so\ndelicious but they tend to be expensive\nDepending on time of year ingesting\nthings like garlic because garlic has\nsulfur which is key for collagen\nsynthesis and repair and she talks about\nthe critical role of torine anyway she\ndoes such a terrific job of describing\nthe nutrition for skin health and skin\nappearance those are just a few of the\nhighlights I do encourage you to check\nout that video and her other content is\nspectacular as well again she has an\nInstagram account YouTube channel that\nare really wonderful so again without\ndoing a deep dive into nutrition decide\nwhether or not you're going to be vegan\nvegetarian omnivore or carnivore and\nthen make sure that you're getting\nenough of the vitamins and minerals and\nmicronutrients from your Foods or\nsupplement if necessary but note that\ncaution about vitamin A supplementation\nin excess and also make sure you're\navoiding excessive amounts of Highly\nprocessed foods you know I mentioned\nearlier these Advanced glycation end\nproducts these are things that are\npresent in a lot of processed foods like\ncrackers and chips and things like that\nthat make those Foods inflammatory so\nyou're getting the theme now\ninflammation is bad not just for the\nskin but for all organ systems of the\nbody it's not just about the high\ndensity of calories\nand the high density of taste present in\nhighly processed foods those are\nproblematic but a lot of the issue with\nthese highly processed foods is the high\nheat conditions used to make those Foods\nstable on shelves or stable in packaging\nover time okay so there's a whole\ndiscussion to be had here that frankly I\ndon't think I had enough but that is\noutside the scope of today's episode the\npoint is that when these highly\nprocessed foods are basically made right\nthey're constructed um they involve the\ninteractions between sugars and proteins\nand fats at high heat that make them\nstable on the shelf or in packaging and\nthose can be very inflammatory and that\ncan show up in the form of reactive skin\nit can make your psoriasis worse yes it\ncan make your acne worse it can make\nyour skin more tender and painful it can\nmake your skin basically more reactive\nto some of the underlying\npredispositions you might have either\nbecause of genetics or other things\nyou're doing or not doing maybe you're\ngoing through a particularly stressful\ntime maybe you're getting a little a\nlittle bit of extra sun and you're\neating more highly processed foods and\nthose things are combining and making\nyour skin break out or flush more than\nit would ordinarily again there's so\nmany reasons to eat most of your foods\nfrom non-processed or minimally\nprocessed sources and of course and now\nI sound like a broken record because you\ncan hear this all over the Internet\ningesting foods that are excessively\nhigh in sugar excessively high in sugars\ncombined with fats just not good to do\npro-inflammatory it's going to cause all\nsorts of issues and we're going to get\ninto this more as it relates to acne in\nparticular because as you probably know\nwhen you ingest foods that are high in\nsugars or even just carbohydrates\ngenerally that also contain a lot of\nfats and in particular when those foods\nare highly processed well then you\ninitiate an inflammatory response and\nyou often can initiate additional things\nhappening in the pores of cells that can\nstart to really aggravate acne and cause\nmore acne this has to do with the whole\ninsulin pathway so when we talk about\nacne I'll talk about diets that create a\nhigh glycemic load we're not necessarily\ntalking about the glycemic index of food\nyou may know that when people measure\nthe glycemic index of food they're\nlooking at the blood sugar response\nafter eating that food typically in\nisolation and not in combination with\nother Foods what I'm talking about is\neating combinations of foods that induce\nhigh levels of insulin high levels of\nblood glucose that then lead to all\nsorts of things in the hormone Pathways\nand cell growth Pathways that exacerbate\nacne so we'll get there in a moment but\nI think the Takeo message around\nnutrition is pretty clear so much so\nthat I don't want to to spend any more\ntime on it we all know what the best\nnutrition really is for us regardless of\nwhether or not you're vegan vegetarian\nomnivore or carnivore it's nonprocessed\nor minimally processed foods\nrepresenting probably anywhere from\nlet's say 75 to 100% of your food intake\ndepending on how strict you want to be\nand then sure make some room if you want\nfor some processed foods but just know\nthat those Advanced glycation end\nproducts and the high glycemic load that\ncomes from those processed foods can\nreally exacerbate inflammatory responses\nin skin and set for it a whole domino\nset of issues related to hormone\nPathways and cell growth Pathways that\nmake everything acne psoriasis and\noverall appearance worse yes your skin\nwill appear to age faster and on the\npositive side most of the foods that we\nthink of as healthy and\nanti-inflammatory are actually quite\ndelicious so enjoy ah and I forgot to\nsay what's absolutely clear you know\nthat myth that they told us when we were\nteenagers they eat a lot of fried food\nwould make you break out would make your\nskin worse guess what it's true that\nhigh heat preparation required for\ncreating things as delicious as the\ndoughnut or french fries right there's a\nreason people love these Foods they're\nso delicious they do cause problems\nthey're pro-inflammatory does that mean\nyou can never have a french fry no you\ndecide what's best for you but know what\nyou're doing as a segue to talking about\nacne we need to talk about the gut\nmicrobiome and this is a direct\noutgrowth of our discussion about\nnutrition here's the simple takeaway\nthat I believe everyone should follow\nnot just for sake of healthy appearing\nskin but also for sake of every organ\nand tissue system in your body which is\nthe data clearly show that ingestion of\nsufficient amounts of fiber so Prebiotic\nand probiotic fiber so fruits vegetables\nsometimes this can also come from grains\nsome people will supplement with\nadditional fiber if they feel they need\nit as well as ingestion of low sugar\nfermented foods talked about this before\nso regular listeners of this podcast may\nhave heard this things like kimchi\nsauerkraut the sort of sauerkraut that\nhas to stay in the fridge so not the\nstuff that's stable on the Shelf at room\ntemperature anything containing a brine\nthat salty brine so pickles but not the\npickles that are stable at room\ntemperature the ones that have to be\nkept in the refrigerated section of the\ngrocery store these low sugar fermented\nfoods are powerful enhancers of the gut\nmicrobiome and when the gut microbiome\nis healthy you have reduced overall\ninflammation in the body this is often\nreflected at the level of the skin and\nbasically skin health and the\nyouthfulness appearance of skin is\nenhanced okay this can also help with\nconditions like acne or psoriasis\nespecially in conditions where there's a\ndirect immune system skin relationship\nthat we'll talk about more in a little\nbit okay so I highly recommend people\nhave anywhere from 1 to four servings of\nlow sugar fermented foods per day or try\nand enhance the health of their gut\nmicrob biome generally maybe you take a\npill probiotic although those can be\nvery expensive there's a little bit of\ndata suggesting that if you chronically\ntake pill probiotics that yield very\nhigh levels of bacteria well then maybe\nthere's some Associated brain fog that's\na little unclear pun intended but you\nknow they are very expensive they have\nto be kept refrigerated and let's face\nit low sugar fermented foods if you find\nthe ones that you like are really great\nto ingest cuz they're tasty and they're\ngood for you now why am I talking about\nthis in part because we keep coming back\nto inflammation as a general issue for\nskin health and that points us also\ntowards some specific dos and don'ts as\nit relates to\nLifestyle let's face it pun intended if\nyou sleep well so maybe you need six\nhours maybe you need seven maybe you\nneed eight maybe you need nine but if\nyou sleep well on a consistent basis\nyour skin is going to look so much\nbetter so much healthier more vibrant\nthan if you are not getting enough sleep\nif you drink alcohol and you wake up the\nnext morning you know your Skin's going\nto look puffy it's not going to look\ngood but many of you can ingest alcohol\nwithout issues I've an entire episode\nabout alcohol yes it's a poison up to\ntwo drinks per week for adults who are\nnon-alcoholics is probably safe zero is\nbetter than any but let's face it\nalcohol is going to exacerbate most skin\nissues this is just clear from the\nliterature doesn't mean you never have a\nglass of wine doesn't mean you never\nhave a beer or a cocktail if that's your\nthing but alcohol consumed in excess and\nit doesn't take much to get there is\ngoing to cause sleep issues microbiome\nissues so indirectly and negatively\nimpact the skin appearance and health\nand indirectly and negatively impact the\nhealth of other tissues in your body but\nit's clear some of that is reduced to\nincrease inflammation some is related to\ndecreased Sleep Quality or duration so\nget great sleep avoid alcohol in excess\nmaybe avoid it allog together drink\nplenty of water this sounds like such\nbasic advice but proper hydration is key\nget enough water in electrolytes it\nabsolutely will impact your inflammation\nLevels by reducing them it absolutely\nwill impact your skin health and\nappearance in a positive way so these\nare just basic things that I'd be remiss\nif I didn't mention the other one is\nsmoking and nicotine from non-smoked\nsources so it's very clear that smoking\nvaping dipping or snuffing is bad for\nskin appearance and health bad bad bad\nevery dermatologist said this why well\nwith smoking you can imagine why okay a\nlot of carcinog and toxic end products\ngenerated from smoking even from vaping\nyes even from vaping it will make your\nskin age faster that's clear but it's\nalso the substance itself why all of\nthose things in addition to increasing\ninflammation nicotine itself is a\nvasoconstrictor so you're doing the\nexact opposite of what you want when it\ncomes to skin health and appearance and\nthat's why people take things like bpc\n157 that's why people take nicotinamide\nthat's why people are trying to improve\nthe hydration status of their skin so if\nyou're somebody that's vaping nicotine\nor even taking nicotine in some other\nform pouch or smoking nicotine and\nyou're interested in having youthful\nappearing skin you are really shooting\nyourself in the I know face and as we\nall know our emotions impact the\nappearance of our skin and yes it can\nexacerbate so-called breakouts and we'll\nget to that in a moment as to what the\nexact pathway is but I've done entire\nepisodes about controlling your stress\nwe have a master stress episode that\ntalks about real time tools that you can\nuse like the physiological sigh provide\na link to a clip about the physiological\nsigh it's the fastest way that I'm aware\nof to reduce one's levels of stress this\nis something my laboratory has studied\nin detail at Stanford there are also\nthings you can do and we're all aware of\nwhat they are proper sleep meditation\nnon-sleep deep rest we'll provide a link\nfor that all things that we can do that\nare zero cost very minimal time\ninvestment physiological side takes\nabout 10 to 15 seconds uh non-sleep deep\nbreast AK Yoga Nidra sometimes called\ntakes anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes per\nday and that reduced stress can\ndramatically improve not just the health\nbut the appearance of your skin and it\nmakes perfect sense as to why that is\nthe stress hormones such as cortisol but\nother hormones too such as adrenaline\nwhen they are chronically elevated\nbecause of the fact that adrenaline\nimpacts Vaso constriction in the skin\nit's going to reduce blood flow to the\nperiphery to the skin it can cause all\nsorts of issues at the level of nerve\nendings that can lead to believe it or\nnot enhanced Flushing when we're under\nstress this is why we measure the\ngalvanic skin response so not just\nsweating but also blood flow and other\nthings to the skin when we are studying\nstress okay so direct relationship\nbetween stress and skin appearance learn\nto control your stress stress is part of\nlife but learn to control your stress in\nreal time and through tools like\nnon-sleep deep rest that are zero cost\nthat can help you reduce your overall\nlevels of stress get great sleep don't\nuse nicotine if you do use nicotine know\nwhat you're doing maybe use it sparingly\nand please don't smoke or vape it dip it\nor snuff it there are other form forms\nand I don't recommend those forms\nbecause they're very very addictive and\nkeep in mind that things that improve\nblood flow reduce inflammation give you\nlower stress better sleep all of that is\ngoing to make you look more youthful\nit's not an imagined effect it is real\nlet's talk about acne acne is very\ncommon it impacts anywhere from 80 to\n90% of young people at some point some\npeople get very bad cystic acne you know\ndeep acne in the cheeks on the back of\nthe neck the back it can be very\nuncomfortable very painful some people\nonly get the oal pimple but they get\nthem very deeply they're very painful\nand look nobody likes acne nobody likes\nthe appearance of acne on themselves it\ncan be very distressing for people it\ncan cause additional stress that then\nfeeds back in terms of inflammation and\nyou know I guess my first uh you know\nrequest I suppose I I can't tell people\nwhat to do and never do but you know for\npeople that have acne you know be\ncompassionate okay young people be\ncompassionate I remember when I was\nyounger some of the kids with bad acne\ngot teased and it it really upset me as\nis really frustrating especially when\ngoing through puberty because there's\nthis hormonal component to acne now\nfortunately there are things that we can\ndo for acne I'll provide a link to one\nof the major sources I used for\nresearching this episode I also of\ncourse spoke to dermatologists one of\nwhom really knows an exceptional amount\nabout acne and its relationship to the\nimmune\nsystem the paper that I'm referring to\nnow is a systematic review and network\nmetaanalysis of topical pharmacological\noral pharmacological physical and\ncombined treatments for acne GIS which\nis the technical name for acne there are\na lot of things that impact acne let's\njust briefly talk about what acne is\nanytime you talk about acne you're\nusually thinking about pus or oil that's\ncalled sebum the sebum accumulates in\nessentially the follicle around the hair\nthis also occurs on non-hairy skin or\nwhere they're just tiny little hairs\nthat often aren't uh visible that's why\nit's very unusual to get acne on say the\nglabrous skin of the Palms I suppose it\ncould happen but it's very rare at any\ngiven moment 10% of people worldwide\nwill have acne as I mentioned up to 90%\nof young people have acne so very common\nvery distressing the accumulation of\nthat sebum in the follicle can be due to\na number of different things some of it\ncan be related to androgens things like\ntestosterone increasing the amount of\nsebum that's produced okay this is why\nyou often see acne during puberty in\naddition the anabolic the progrowth\neffects of androgens such as\ntestosterone and by the way these occur\nin both males and females because both\nmales and females have testosterone and\nestrogen the androgenic effects of\ntestosterone can also cause hypertrophy\ngrowth of the hair follicle right so an\nincrease in the number of catinos sites\nthe cells in and around the follicle\nwhich can compress that and hold some of\nthat additional sebum beneath the\nsurface and that's why you're getting a\nswelling of what looks like a pimple or\na cyst so there's the potential for a\nhormonal influence on increasing acne\nnow if someone going through puberty you\njust have to deal with that increase now\nif there's a sudden increase in acne\nwhen one is post puberty you may want to\nlook at levels of androgens that are\nbeing produced and nowadays with\nincreasing numbers apparently of things\nlike polycystic ovarian syndrome which\nin part relates to increases in\nandrogens this is becoming an additional\nconcern so getting a quality blood test\nlooking at Androgen levels over time can\nbe very beneficial for both males and\nfemales now in addition insulin that is\nrelated to our diet so insulin and\nglucose generally go up together or down\ntogether depending on whether or not\nwe're ingesting Foods or amounts of\nfoods that greatly increase our insulin\nand blood glucose so insulin is part of\nan anabolic pathway as well a cell\ngrowth pathway progrowth pathway we\nshould call it that involves mtor\nmamalian Target of\nrapamycin that is a general growth\nsignal for cells so this occurs in the\neye this occurs in the liver you know\nmtor is involved involved in growth of\ncells of all kinds including cells\nwithin the skin when our\ndiet increases the amount of insulin and\nglucose to a degree that is in excess of\nsome threshold that's going to be\ndifferent for everybody depending on\nyour activity levels your metabolism the\nway you manage insulin when that happens\nyou get increases in mtor that then can\nfeed back on those Androgen receptors\nincrease the levels of things like\ntestosterone further that then feed back\non the production of increased SE\nokay that oily stuff increased kosy\nproliferation and you get more acne in\nother words having a diet that has a\nhigh glycemic load or evokes a large\ninsulin response can be problematic so\nwhat to do well we talked about it\nbefore you want to eat mostly\nnonprocessed minimally processed foods\nyou definitely want to exert portion\ncontrol right you don't want to eat much\nsugar or sugar in excess you don't want\nbig spikes in insulin and blood glucose\nyou want to avoid inflammatory diet so\nagain fewer if any highly processed\nfoods because of those glycation n\nproducts that we talked about before and\non the positive side if one exercises\nsomething like say intermittent fasting\nand here I don't necessarily think young\npeople especially people going through\npuberty should do this because they're\ngrowing they need nutrients so you have\nto strike that balance between getting\nenough nutrients and not overloading the\nsystem with insulin glucose and calories\nbut things like intermittent fasting\ncould be useful or making sure that if\nyou ingest complex carbohydrates as I\nmentioned I do okay I'm an omnivore that\nyou don't do it in excess to the point\nwhere you're getting big spikes in\ninsulin and blood glucose all of this\nthe dermatologist tell me can help serve\nto reduce acne and while it might seem\nindirect you know this relationship\nbetween testosterone and sebum\naccumulation the relationship between\ninsulin and mtor and increased\ntestosterone and SE sebum accumulation\nand growth of the carattino sites these\nare real Pathways that have been\nestablished and some of those are\ndiscussed in detail in the review\nso much so that there has been the\nexploration of specific Foods in\nparticular Dairy and Whey you know we\nhear a lot about ingestion of whey\nprotein it's a very high quality protein\nHigh bioavailability high in the amino\nacid Lucine which for those of you that\nare interested in muscle building and\nrepair there's a lot of discussion about\nLucine being a critical component there\nyou want Lucine but it does appear that\npeople that over consume whey people\nthat over consume Dairy can run into\nissues now does that mean you shouldn't\nconsume whey protein no I take whey\nprotein do I suffer from acne no if I\ndid would I reduce my whey protein\nintake well I might decide to run a bit\nof an experiment where I reduce the\namount of whey protein that I eat for a\nlittle bit and see how that goes should\nI reduce the amount of dairy I ingest ah\nwell here's where things get interesting\nso in discussing this with a\ndermatologist who also happens to know a\nlot about nutrition they told me\nsomething very interesting a lot of\npeople think that high-fat Dairy will\nexacerbate their acne\nbut here's the\nsituation nonfat and low-fat Dairy has\nemulsifiers this actually based on work\nI believe some of which was done at\nStanford that can Spike insulin more\nthan full fat Dairy so some people in an\nattempt to reduce the amount of acne\nthey're getting will move from high fat\ndairy or full fat I should say to\nnon-fat milk or non-fat dairy or low fat\nDairy and their acne will actually get\nworse and that could be because of the\ninsulin Spike associated with some of\nthe Ulsa fires in that non-fat and\nlow-fat Dairy so what this means is that\nyou don't have to avoid Dairy altogether\nbut you might be better off ingesting\nfull fat Dairy you might be best off not\ningesting any dairy at all maybe you\nwant to run that experiment on yourself\nand just see what works and what doesn't\nwork or if there's no change at all in\naddition if you're consuming a lot of\nfried foods so those french fries you're\ningesting cheeseburgers and things of\nthat sort it may not be so much the fat\ncontent of those meals but rather the\nbig insulin response that occurs when we\ningest high fat meals in common with\nthings like sugary milkshakes or fried\nfoods like french fries and things of\nthat sort that's leading to the acne by\nway of increased inflammation right so\nthere are a lot of different Pathways\ninflammation androgens like testosterone\ninsulin leading to increases in\ntestosterone and inflammation a lot of\nPathways converge to exacerbate acne and\noften times it's just the removal or\neven just the reduction of some of this\nfood intake or types of food intake that\ncan really lead to Big improvements in\none's acne so all of these things\ncombined to support lower inflammation\nappropriate amounts of sebum production\nbecause you do need sebum production you\ndo need cartinos sites in and around the\nhair follicle but you don't want too\nmany of them and so on but what can be\ndone to directly address acne well there\nare a number of different prescription\ntreatments that your dermatologist can\nsuggest but one thing that all the\ndermatologists agree upon is first of\nall getting adequate sleep reducing\nstress taking care of your gut\nmicrobiome the nutrition recommendations\nthat we've been talking about up until\nnow but also get this this is\ninteresting not over cleansing a lot of\npeople with acne will start to wash\ntheir face constantly and we'll often\nuse harsh cleansers that can exacerbate\nthat acne either by virtue of removing\nsome important skin microbiome\ncomponents that then lead to even other\ninfections like fungal infections or\nadditional inflammation because you're\nremoving that microbiome barrier but\nthey all recommend regular cleansing of\nthe skin usually two or three times per\nday but not in excess of that using a\ngentle unscented unfragranced\ncleanser okay so they're number of\ndifferent types of these I personally my\nbasically my entire life that I at least\nas far as I can remember I've always\nused unscented unfragranced Dove soap\nokay I have no relationship to Dove soap\nI'm sure people out there are going to\nsay oh my goodness you know it contains\na bunch of things that are bad for you\nbut that's what's worked for me and not\nthe liquid form just bar soap and there\nare things like Cetaphil these are some\nbrand names and there are a bunch of\nother more sophisticated gentle\ncleansers that one could use there are\nalso a lot of products out there that\ncontain what's called salicylic acid\nokay this as often as um you know clear\nfluid that you put onto a cotton ball or\na tissue and then you you spread on on\nthe face it's very important very very\nimportant that if you're going to use\nthese products that you do it on clean\nskin that is skin that's been cleaned\nwith a combination of mild zero\nfragrance soap and lukewarm water okay\nbecause of the relationship between\ninflammation and acne that's what gives\nit its red appearance you don't want to\nuse extreme temperatures of especially\nhot water when washing your skin so\nlukewarm water mild soap and then and\nonly if it's been recommended by your\ndermatologist the salicylic acid\nsalicylic acid comes from the same class\nof drugs as aspirin so it tends to\nreduce cattiny stickiness right the\nextent to which um those cells stick\ntogether why do I mention aspirin well\nyou may have heard that people will take\naspirin to reduce the stickiness between\ntheir platelets and an attempt to\nimprove heart health we'll cover that on\nanother episode at some point but\nsalicylic acid reduces the stickiness of\nthe coratin oyes so it can lead to less\nclogging of the pores by accumulation of\ncarattino sites or I should say by less\naccumulation of the cortinos sites and\nit can reduce swelling in and around the\narea related to the acne sometimes if\npeople get an acne pimple especially if\nthey have an event or they don't want to\nbe seen with that pimple the use of a\nlittle bit of corticosteroid cream put\non there can reduce the redness or\nswelling the dermatologists tell me you\nshould absolutely not pop your pimples\npart of the problem when you pop a\npimple I know there entire videos about\nthis online I know please don't go look\nat them these uh the whole communi is\naround this is super gross but I know\npeople find it very satisfying in some\ncases to pop these pimples get the\ninfection out while there are certain\nuse cases for that where someone has an\ninfection it just absolutely needs to\nget out then be cleaned then covered\nwith a bandage and maybe some topical\nantibiotic that would be a use case for\nthat the dermatologist practically\nbegged me to tell you don't pop your\npimples because a they will go away in\nnot too much time if you leave them\nalone and B you can always put a little\nbit of corticosterone cream on top of\nthem to reduce the redness or swelling\nbut most importantly they tell me that\nwhen you pop those pimples what ends up\nhappening is you get a mechanical a\nphysical disruption of that area which\nto you might just seem like okay\nwhatever it turns a little bit red and\nthat's transient but you get the influx\nof what are called Matrix\nmetalloproteases these are enzymes\nremember anytime you hear an ace it's\nusually an enzyme Matrix Metallo\nproteases that then and go eat at The\nextracellular Matrix and then you can\nget an indentation scar that is\npermanent okay so if you're concerned\nabout the appearance of your skin avoid\npopping those pimples I know it can be\nhard to do but really try and avoid\npopping pimples it can lead to scarring\nbecause of the Matrix metallic proteases\nand the eating away of the exellar\nMatrix keep the area clean cover it up\nif you need to get some cortico stero\nand cream on there if you want to reduce\nthe redness if it's really bad and you\nhave some big important event like\nyou're getting married tomorrow and it's\nright on the tip of your nose or\nsomething like that then you can\npotentially go to the dermatologist and\nget it injected with a corticosteroid to\nreduce the redness um in a more potent\nway but they did ask that I ask you to\nplease not pop your pimples and if\nyou're somebody that suffers from acne\nI'd like you to know I provide a link to\na paper in the show note captions\nentitled acne and diet a review of\npathogenic mechanisms and I also provide\na link to the review I mentioned before\nthat covers all of the other aspects of\ntreating acne topical pharmacological\noral pharmacological physical and\ncombined treatments for acne vulgaris\nbecause again I do sympathize with the\nfact that acne can be very distressing\nvery painful fortunately there are a\nnumber of different avenues that you\nwithout a dermatologist but ideally you\nand a dermatologist can use use to\nattack acne at the level of inflammation\nthrough diet through lifestyle if needed\nprescription medications and again\ngentle cleansing and thinking about the\nvarious things that indirectly will\nimpact that acne so much so that a few\nof the derms told me that they have\npatients young and old who will be\nsuffering from really bad acne that will\nsometimes just make a few adjustments to\ntheir diet the exclusion of certain\nthings mainly highly processed foods\nmaybe reducing Dairy a little bit or\nweigh a little little bit or completely\nand increasing the amount of things that\nreduce inflammation so more fruits and\nvegetables and meat fish eggs from\nhealthy sources and seeing dramatic\nimprovements in acne so that's always\nreassuring to hear doesn't always\nrequire prescription medication but if\nyou need it you should take it okay\nlet's talk about rosacea rosacea is\nrening of the skin and some people\nsuffer from this pretty severely other\npeople mildly some people transiently\nbut it tends to be kind of distressing\nfor people and the reason it's stressing\nis that it can look like blushing or\nflushing of the face when in fact one\nisn't emotionally embarrassed however\nbeing embarrassed or having any flushing\nof the skin can exacerbate existing\nrosacea so it's thought to be caused by\na combination of genetics there can\nperhaps be some again over inflammation\nof the skin which probably reflects\ninflammation more globally at the level\nof the gut and body Etc we've been\ntalking a lot about that today and there\nare things that can exacerbate rosacea\nsuch as alcohol intake or anything that\nacts as a vasod dilator that dilates the\nvasculature innervating the skin so the\napproach to treating rosacea is pretty\nmuch similar to the other things that\nwe've talked about consuming a low\ninflammation low glycemic low diet\ntrying to get enough sleep keeping\nalcohol intake in particular to a\nminimum or cutting out alcohol\ncompletely the reason I say in\nparticular is that a lot of people that\nsuffer from rosacea who cut out alcohol\ncompletely essentially eliminate the\nrosacea or dramatically reduce it so\noften times it's alcohol that's the\nculprit either directly or indirectly we\ndon't know again alcohol is a poison but\ncould be the indirect manner in which\nalcohol impacts sleep and the gut\nmicrobiome negatively that's causing the\nrosacea without knowing the direct or\nindirect mechanism reduce or even\neliminate your alcohol for a bit and see\nif your rosacea improves that will give\nyou a strong indication of what might be\ngoing on and even better it could give\nyou a potential solution to the problem\nnow now for those that don't experience\na reduction or elimination of rosacea If\nyou eliminate alcohol get your sleep\nright get your diet right there are some\nadditional things you can do first of\nall you want to follow the same\nrecommendation we talked about for acne\nwhich is also the general recommendation\nfor skin care use lukewarm water not\nexcessively hot or cold water a gentle\nunfragranced cleanser you want to use\nsunscreen regularly remember sun damage\nto the skin is also inflammation so\nthat's going to exacerbate rosacea and\nof course sunlight because of the\nrelease of nitric oxide is also going to\nact as a vasod dilator does that mean\nyou have to go full beekeeper mode no it\ndoesn't you can if you want to I suppose\nbut use a quality mineral-based\nsunscreen which we talked about earlier\nin the episode and you should use some\nsort of moisturizer to help lock in the\nmoisture within your skin you could use\nthings like hyaluronic acid or use any\nkind of gentle moisturizing cream that's\nnot going to cause inflammation or kind\nof irritate the skin in any way and can\nkeep the moisture within the skin and\nthere are a lot of different versions of\nthese available out there and frankly a\nlot of them are not terribly expensive\nyou can find super expensive varieties\nof any and all these things but many of\nthe things that meet the criteria of\ngentle unfragranced\ncleanser SPF 30 mineral only sunscreen\nas well as a quality moisturizer are not\nnecessarily the most expensive available\nand you know what justifies the higher\nexpense in some cases could be I don't\nknow the silkiness or the um packaging\nit could be any number of different\nthings I'm not going to say that the\ncheapest varieties are necessarily as\ngood as the most expensive varieties but\nI do think and the dermatologist that I\nspoke to definitely confirmed that\nthere's a lot of price inflation out\nthere related to kind of the overall\nmilu of packaging and ex and purported\nexclusivity of certain skincare products\nlook for the things that meet the\ncriteria you are trying to establish for\nyour skinc care but just like with acne\njust like with General skincare if you\nhave rosacea you want to think about\nmild treatments for the skin at the\nlevel of cleaning at the level of sun\nprotection at the level of locking in\nmoisture and then there's some\nadditional things that if you can spare\nthe expense could also be beneficial\nlike nicotinamide niacinamide as it's\nalso called or there's also been some\nevidence that things like licorice root\ncan be of benefit okay these things are\ntypically found as a topical ointment or\nin a topical ointment but in the case of\nniacinamide nicotinamide talked about\nhow this can be available in an ointment\nform a topical form or it can be taken\nas 2 500 milligram dosages per day I\ngave you the long list of the various\nmechanisms by which it can improve skin\nHealth reduced inflammation production\nof collagen Etc all of that still holds\nfor the potential treatment of rosacea\nbe sure to avoid any kind of things that\nare acting as strong astringents or that\nincrease heat so people who have rosacea\nwill often try to avoid hot peppers so\nspicy foods of any kind I know that's\ntough I'm somebody who really enjoys\nspicy foods so if you have to avoid\nspicy foods I sympathize with you um\nthat's rough um anything that acts as an\nEST stringent or can you know really\nirritate the skin from the inside or\nfrom the outside so think not\nexcessively hot foods as it relates to\nspicy or temperature things of that sort\nnow I should point out there are\ndifferent types of rosacea the\ndermatologist I spoke to who is expert\nin rosacea told me there are four major\ntypes of rosacea many of them respond to\nthe sorts of guidelines that we've been\ntalking about up until now some of them\nthat also include acne need some\nadditional treatment we talked about\nacne treatments that can be easily\nfolded into the treatment for\nrosacea there are people who have very\nstubborn rosacea this may be due to\nexcessive use of cleansers and again\nwe're talking about how over cleansing\ncan really be a problem so we're not\nsaying don't wash your face we're not\nsaying don't take a shower please do in\nfact and I should have said this earlier\nby the way for a lot of reasons related\nto your comfort and appearance and other\npeople's\nComfort after you work out at a gym\nregardless of whether or not you're\nrolling around on the floor with a foam\nroller or you're rolling Jiu-Jitsu or\nyou're lifting weights or you're doing\ncardio it is a good idea to take a\nshower and cleanse with a gentle\ncleanser as soon as possible I know this\nsounds like just basic advice but a lot\nof people just throw on a clean shirt or\nthey don't rinse off or they don't wash\ntheir face and they're wondering why\nthey're getting all sorts of skin issues\nwell there's a lot of bacteria gyms a\nlot of sweating people um there are a\nlot of bacteria on you a lot of bacteria\non the equipment and yeah you can spray\ndown the equipment and do these various\nthings but it's a good idea to shower as\nsoon as possible or to bathe rather as\nsoon as possible wash your face after\ngoing to a gym for your sake and for the\nsake of others now some rosacea is very\nstubborn meaning it does not go away\neven if somebody makes all the\nappropriate LIF style adjustments tries\nany number of different Medical\nTreatments and by the way rosacea is a\nmedical condition and in some cases\npeople will get angomas um you know the\naccumulation of blood vessels near the\nsurface of the skin that can be you know\nfor them something they don't want so we\ncould say unsightly but they just don't\nwant it or in some cases they'll treat\ntheir rosacea and then they'll get an\naccumulation of Broken Vessels near the\nsurface of the skin this is pretty\ncommon for people that experience\nrosacea and treat rosacea for these\npeople there is a treatment it has to be\ndone in a dermatologist office called\npulse die laser where they use a laser\nof a particular wavelength that can\npenetrate excuse me The Superficial\nlayers of the skin and now you know how\ndifferent wavelengths of light can\npenetrate to different depths within\nskin and destroy the blood vessels or\nthe broken blood vessels that then call\nin immune system cells to clear out the\ndestroyed endothelial cells and other\nstuff around it and take it away get rid\nof those blood vessels that sit beneath\nthe surface let's talk about psoriasis\nso when I was researching this episode I\nasked the dermatologist is psoriasis\nrelated to yeast or overproduction no\nskin cells and what they told me was\nreally interesting they said for more\nthan 80 years within the dermatologic\ncommunity it was thought that psoriasis\nwas just an overproduction of skin cells\nbut it wasn't really known what the\nsource was and it turns out that now\nalmost all the derms at least the ones I\nspoke to said that it has something to\ndo either directly or at least\npowerfully and indirectly with the\nimmune system so what can be done to\ntreat psoriasis you can probably guess\nthings that reduce the overall level of\nactivation in the immune system not so\nmuch that you become susceptible to\ninfections because that's not good but\nyou treat this like any other autoimmune\ncondition there are now drugs these are\nprescription drugs that directly Target\nthe inter lucans the components of the\nimmune system that are directly involved\nin psoriasis such as interlukin 17 and\ninterlukin 23 and I'm told that these\ndrugs are very effective in the\ntreatment of psoriasis so that's very\nreassuring you know I know um especially\nin communities online that are focused\nmore on behavioral tools and nutrition\nbased tools or supplementation based\ntools of which I am right we focus on\nthose but as you probably noticed in\nthis and other episodes of The hubman\nLab podcast we also talk about\nprescription drugs that have proven to\nbe very effective in certain conditions\nso it's very reassuring to hear that\nthere are excellent prescription drugs\nthat can Target the specific inter\nlucans that are\noveractivated in psoriasis because\npsoriasis is now known as an\noveractivation of the immune system and\na kind of uh turning of the body on\nitself if you will to create this itchy\nscaly uncomfortable and in some cases\nunsightly uh overproduction of skin\ncells at the scalp and elsewhere Okay so\nwe've covered a lot of topics thus far\nwe've talked about skin biology we\ntalked about various skin conditions\nthat are very common such as acne\npsoriasis and so forth we talked about\nways to increase the youthfulness or the\nappearance of youthfulness in skin that\nare based on data some that are a bit\nmore\nexperimental and we talked about even\nsome laser procedures and phototherapy\nthings of that sort and at the same time\nI acknowledge that there are many topics\nand conditions related to skin health\nand skin care that we did not talk about\nwe didn't talk about Eczema we didn't\ntalk about Botox we didn't talk about an\nenormous number of topics that I know\nare of interest and relevant to many of\nyou so as a consequence the plan is to\nhost various expert guests both\ndermatologists expert in particular\nareas as well as yes a cosmetic surgeon\nwho believe it or not does not like to\ncut but rather likes to use fairly\nnon-invasive procedures that touch on\nsome of these very same mechanisms yes\ninjections of certain things things that\noperate at the surface level of the skin\nand sometimes surgical procedures that\nyou know I know when people hear\ncosmetic surgery they think oh people\njust trying to improve the youthfulness\nof their look or something of that sort\nbut you know that also relate to certain\nserious skin conditions for which\nsurgery and non-surgical approaches can\nassist in so the point is that any\ndiscussion about skin health and Skin\nCare is going to be an ongoing\ndiscussion one that I do plan to\ncontinue on this podcast in the form of\nexpert guest episodes maybe even another\nsolo episode we've occasionally done\nso-called toolkit episodes where we\nsummarize some of the main points of\nprevious solo episodes and that arrive\nwith guest episodes and that reflect the\nlatest knowledge that gets published in\nbetween episodes I do plan to cover this\ntopic in more detail going forward\nmeanwhile I like to think that what I've\ncovered today provides at at least an\nintroduction to the biology of skin and\nan understanding about the various\nthings that we all can and should do for\nour skin health and appearance as well\nas ways to attack certain pain points\nrelated to certain skin conditions that\ncome from expert sources from excellent\nliterature that has been established\nover many many decades and I personally\nfind this organ that we call skin to be\ninfinitely fascinating not just by\nvirtue of what it does but by virtue of\nall the different organ and tissue\nsystems that it interacts within our\nbody and by virtue of the fact that our\nskin is this incredible living organ on\nthe outside of our body that tells us oh\nso very much about how we and others are\ndoing in terms of our immediate and\npotentially our long-term Health
