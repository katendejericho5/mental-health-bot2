    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing Placebo\neffects we will also be discussing what\nare called nobo effects as well as\nbelief effects all three of these\nPlacebo nobo and belief effects are all\nrelated to our brains in inedible\nability to place an expectation on what\nis about to happen and actually change\nwhat is about to happen independent of\nthe physical and chemical properties of\na drug or some sort of other treatment\nsolution for things like pain\nParkinson's disease irritable bowel\nsyndrome asthma stress and on and on and\non now one of the most incredible things\nabout these effects is that despite the\nfact that it would appear that they are\nsimply psychological or the power of the\nMind Over Matter it's not that at all\nPlacebo nobo and belief effects actually\nchange the way your biology your\nphysiology Works in fact you have neural\ncircuits within your brain that are\ndedicated to how your expectation of\nwhat will happen actually changes some\nof the most core biological functions\nwithin your brain and body modifying for\ninstance heart rate blood pressure the\nrelease of specific neurom modulators\nsuch as dopamine and adrenaline and so\npowerfully so that these types of\neffects can actually work along with\ntraditional drug treatments or\nbehavioral treatments in order to vastly\nchange the way that your brain and body\nwork so if you think of the word Placebo\nas an inert substance or treatment that\nis merely a control it's merely\nsomething introduced to an experiment or\na clinical trial to try and figure out\nyou know what's happening normally in\nsomebody's brain or body as a comparison\nto some drug or other type type of\ntreatment well while that can be true\nand Placebo controls are vital for\ncertain clinical studies it's also the\ncase that placebos nobos and belief\neffects have powerful impact on our\nphysiology entirely separate from all of\nthat so much so that several highly\nesteemed researchers in the medical\ncommunity around the world believe that\nPlacebo nobo and belief effects should\nactually be leveraged in the treatment\nof various diseases as their own unique\ntreatment so by the end of today's\nepisode you you are going to have a\nclear understanding of what Placebo nobo\nand belief effects are their biological\nunderpinnings and the way that you can\nleverage them toward your mental health\nphysical health and performance before\nwe begin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\neight sleep eight sleep sleep makes\nSmart mattress covers with cooling\nHeating and sleep tracking capacity I've\nspoken many times before on this podcast\nabout the fact that sleep is the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance now one of the\nkey things for getting a great night's\nsleep is the temperature of your\nsleeping environment for instance in\norder to fall and stay deeply asleep\nyour body temperature needs to drop by\nabout 1 to 3° and in order to wake up\nfeeling refreshed your body temperature\nactually has to increase by about 1 to\n3° with eight sleep it makes it very\neasy to control the temperature of your\nsleeping environment you can dial in\nspecific temperature ranges for the\nbeginning middle and end of your night\nit even has a sleep tracker so it will\ntrack your slow wave sleep REM sleep\ntotal sleep and give you a sleep score\nand you can actually divide the mattress\ninto two different temperatures if\nsomeone else in your bed likes things a\ndifferent temperature and they of course\ncan have their sleep tracked\nindependently of yours it's an\nabsolutely wonderful tool it's\ncompletely transformed my sleep so much\nso that when I travel to hotels or\nairbnbs I find I don't ever sleep as\nwell as when I have my eight sleep I've\neven Shi shipped my eight sleep out to\nthose places that gets a little\ncomplicated but that's how much I love\nmy eight sleep it gives me the best\npossible night sleep

to\nmake coffee I first learned about\nAeropress well over 10 years ago and\nI've been using one ever since Aeropress\nwas developed by Allan Adler who was an\nengineer at Stanford and I knew of Allan\nbecause he had also built the so-called\naobi frisbee so he was sort of famous in\nour community for developing these\ndifferent Feats of engineering that\nturned into commercial products now I\nlove coffee I'm somebody that drinks\ncoffee nearly every day usually about 90\nto 120 minutes after I wake up in the\nmorning although not always sometimes if\nI'm going to exercise I'll drink coffee\nfirst thing in the morning but I love\nlove love coffee and what I've\npersonally found is that by using the\narero Press I can make the best possible\ntasting cup of coffee I don't know what\nexactly it is in the arero press that\nallows the same beans to be prepared\ninto a cup of coffee that tastes that\nmuch better as compared to any other\nform of Brewing that coffee even the\ntraditional French press the Aero press\nis extremely easy to use and it's\nextremely compact in fact I take it with\nme whenever I travel and I use it on the\nroad in hotels even on planes I'll just\nask for some hot water and I'll Brew my\ncoffee or tea right there on the plane\nwith over 55,000 five-star reviews Aero\npress is the best reviewed coffee press\nin the world if you would like

activities\nand your sleep patterns impact your\nhealth by giving you real-time feedback\non your diet using a continuous glucose\nmonitor now blood glucose sometimes\nreferred to as blood sugar has an\nimmediate and long-term impact on your\nenergy levels and your overall health\none of the best way ways to maintain\nfocus and energy throughout your day as\nwell as to keep your so-called metabolic\nHealth in best order is to make sure\nthat your blood glucose never spikes too\nmuch nor does it get too low with levels\nyou can monitor how different foods and\nfood combinations impact your blood\nglucose levels on a momentto moment\nbasis I've been using levels for some\ntime now and it's really helped me\nunderstand which foods and food\ncombinations exercise schedules and\nsleep schedules are optimal for my blood\nglucose levels and how that transl Ates\nto energy levels and other metrics of\nHealth if you're interested in learning\nmore about levels and trying a\ncontinuous glucose monitor you can go to\nlevels. l/h huberman levels has just\nlaunched a new CGM sensor that is\nsmaller and has even better tracking\nthan before right now they're also\noffering two free months of membership\nagain that's levels. linkli nk/ huberman\nto try the new sensor and two free\nmonths of membership okay let's talk\nabout Placebo effects I will also be\ntalking about no sibo effects and just\nestablish the difference between those\nPlacebo effects are when an inert\nsubstance or behavioral treatment that\nis a substance or behavioral treatment\nthat is not going to have any kind of\ndirect biological or psychological\nactivity right it shouldn't do anything\non its own somehow does in the direction\nof improving symptoms or performance now\nlet's contrast that with no sibo no sibo\nis when a drug or behavioral\nIntervention which is inert it should\nhave no impact on symptoms or\nperformance of any kind but with no sibo\nit turns out these substances or\nbehavioral interventions actually worsen\nsymptoms or performance now often times\npeople will just say a placebo effect\nit's a little bit more rare for people\nto distinguish between Placebo and no\nsibo effects but I do think it's\nimportant to know their difference going\nforward I'll mostly just refer to these\nas Placebo effects but I'll talk about\nNo sibo Effects a little bit later I'll\nalso talk about belief effects so let's\njust establish what belief effects are\nbelief effects are when you or somebody\nelse learns specific knowledge that\nchanges your expectation about what is\ngoing to happen in reference to say\nstress or consuming a given food or\ntaking a given drug or doing a specific\nbehavioral protocol and the specific\ninformation you learn or assimilate\nactually leads to that specific outcome\nso in many ways belief effects and\nPlacebo effects are similar it's just\nthat the word Placebo or placebo effect\neffects is commonly used to refer to\ndrugs and behavioral interventions\nbelief effects are a more specific\nlanguage used to describe when\ninformation of any kind changes the\noutcome of some physiological or\npsychological process now what's common\nto Placebo nobo and belief effects is\nthat they all work by changing\nexpectation and anytime we talk about\nexpectation we're talking about the\nfunction of the nervous system and\nspecifically the brain and specifically\nthe prefrontal cortex within the brain\nthe pre frontal cortex is neural real\nestate which is just fancy nerd speak\nfor the neurons and their connections\nthat reside just behind your forehead\njust in the front of your skull now the\nprefrontal cortex has a lot of different\nsubdivisions or regions the overall\nfunction of the prefrontal cortex can be\ndescribed as having the ability to\neither activate or suppress other neural\ncircuits deeper in the brain some people\nin fact a previous guest on the hubman\nLab podcast a neurosurgeon said the\nprefrontal cortex can generally be\ndescribed as the structure in the brain\nthat controls other structures in the\nbrain by saying sh or suppressing their\nfunction so for instance if you have the\nimpulse to move or to shout the\nprefrontal cortex suppresses that\nmovement or suppresses that desire to\nshout or that shouting if you've ever\nhad the experience of you know going to\nthe edge of a cliff or being on a high\nbridge and thinking oh my goodness like\nyou know you just have this spontaneous\nthought which please don't do this in\naction but one will have this thought\nlike oh my goodness like what if I just\njumped off and people think oh my\ngoodness you know do I have some sort of\num Death Wish well no the prefrontal\ncortex being largely a context\nevaluating and prediction machine is\nessentially looking at that landscape\nand predicting what would happen indeed\nhow bad it would be if you were to jump\noff that bridge or jump off that cliff\nand then you feel that oh my goodness\nlike what's wrong with me why would I\nthink this but the fact that you think\nit even for a moment but you don't do it\nand the fact that you recognize that\nit's sort of a uh you know dangerous\nthought certainly a dangerous action\nagain please don't engage in the action\ntells you that your prefrontal cortex is\nworking properly again the prefrontal\ncortex is involved in suppressing\ncertain types of behaviors and what\nsorts of behaviors well the larger theme\nof the prefrontal cortex that we need to\nconsider today is that it is an\nexpectation or prediction making machine\nit is a bunch of neurons that release\nchemicals and have electrical activity\nthat're speaking with and receiving\ninformation from other areas of the\nbrain and it's evaluating a number of\nthings like context like what's going on\nin this room what's going on in this\nscene what's supposed to happen here\nwhat might I do what should I do what\nshould I not do etc etc now the other\nthing about the prefrontal cortex given\nthat it has all these different\nsubdivisions is that some of those\nsubdivisions have a unique what we call\nlabeled line communication like a unique\nHighway that leads to specific brain\nareas that control specific bodily\nfunctions including heart rate blood\npressure Etc and a little bit later in\nthe episode I'll talk about a specific\npaper it's one of my favorite papers in\nwhich a specific prefrontal cortical\nregion is identified as controlling very\nprimitive aspects of our physiology such\nas body temperature and heart rate in\nreference to beliefs or what's happening\nin a social scene and this is very\ndifferent from the way that say getting\ninto cold water or experiencing some\nother sort of stressor causes increase\nin heart rate or Vaso constriction what\nwe're talking about here when we talk\nabout Placebo nobo and belief effects\nare the way in which you learn\ninformation or you are told information\nlike hey this pill is going to do blank\num maybe because the label says it maybe\nbecause the um scientist or the doctor\ntells you that this pill does blank or\nthis injection will do blank or maybe\nyou learn some information about what\nsome specific drug or supplement or\nbehavioral protocol will do and in that\nlearning you come to expect a specific\nset of effects and certain neural\ncircuits in the prefrontal cortex become\nactive and start to activate certain\nneural circuits deeper in the brain in\nareas like the hypothalamus these are\nancient very well conserved across\nanimals areas of the brain that control\nvery primitive functions okay they exist\nin essentially all mammals and even in\nreptiles the prefrontal cortex also\ncommunicates with areas of your brain\nstem controlling things like breathing\nEtc so the prefrontal cortex is a\nsophisticated area of your brain that\ntakes into account context both in the\npresent as well as memories from the\npast it can take into consideration\ngoals about the future and then combines\nall of that into neural signals to areas\nof the brain that control basic\nphysiological functions related to the\nimmune system the stress system the\nreward system the pleasure system and on\nand on so when we talk about Placebo\nnobo and belief effects what we're\nreally talking about is the ability for\ninformation and specific experiences to\nlead to expectations within us about\nwhat's going to happen and then our\nphysiology of our brain and body\nfundamentally changes such that those\nthings happen so let's talk about some\nspecific examples of placebo effects\nfrom the research literature and today\nwe're going to cover a lot of different\nexamples from different systems but as\nwe do that I will specifically be\nselecting examples that illustrate\ndifferent types of placebo effects and\nillustrate what those different types of\nplacebo effects are now I should mention\nthat if you're interested in Placebo\neffects there's a wonderful book that\ndescribes many many different Placebo\neffects and their biological\nunderpinnings in cases where those\nbiological underpinnings are understood\nand the book I'm referring to is one\nthat I used prominently in researching\nthis episode It's called none other than\nPlacebo effects understanding the other\nside of medical care and the book is by\nfabrio Benedetti I hope I pronounced\nthat right fabrio um and to your\nItalians out there if I didn't do it\ncorrectly I apologize it's an absolutely\nwonderful book I confess I've never met\nfabrio Benedetti I confess I have no\nrelation to the publisher or to the book\nitself except that I absolutely love the\nbook so highly recommend this book I'll\nbe pulling from a number of different\nexamples described in this book today to\nmy mind one of the most interesting\nexamples of placebo effect is where\nPlacebo is given and can profoundly\nchange levels of dopamine release in the\nbrain now the study I'm about to\ndescribe was done in Parkinson's\npatients people with Parkinson's have\ndegeneration of neurons in an area of\nthe brain called the substantia\nwhich is an area of the brain in the\nkind of bottom back part of the brain\nfor ufan AOS it's the ventral tegmental\narea but you don't need to know that\nname these neurons contain dopamine and\nare essential for the generation of\nsmooth movement patterns including\nwalking and reaching and moving um one's\nhand to write Etc and of course dopamine\nis involved in a bunch of other things\ntoo including motivation and reward in\npeople with Parkinson's depending on how\nsevere and advanced the Parkinson's is\nthey suffer deficits in the ability to\ngenerate smooth movements and often\ndeficits in motivation and reward\nPathways as well now there are many\ndifferent treatments for Parkinson some\nmore successful than others\nunfortunately it's still not completely\ncurable at least not at this time but\nmost of the drugs that are successful in\ntreating Parkinson's to some degree or\nanother are drugs that increase levels\nof dopamine within the brain for obvious\nreasons as I just mentioned Parkinson's\nis a degeneration of the dopaminergic\nmeaning dopamine containing and\nreleasing neurons in the brain so people\nwith Parkinson's will often be given L\nDoopa which is a precursor to dopamine\nor other types of drugs that increase\ndopamine within the brain now there have\nbeen a number of studies that have\ncompared certain drugs known to increase\ndopamine such as lopa things like\napomorphine bromocryptine\nEtc to Placebo control drugs and one of\nthe interesting takeaways from those\nstudies is that yes drugs like elopa\nbromocryptine Etc increase dopamine and\nat least can partially or transiently\nimprove symptoms of Parkinson's in many\nnot all patients with Parkinson's the\nplacebo drugs given in many of those\nstudies which were simply a sugar pill\nor some other inert pill it doesn't\ncontain any chemicals that are known to\ndirectly bind to or increase dopamine in\nthe brain and yet nonetheless when the\nbrains of certain patients were imaged\nit was clear that Not only was there an\nimprovement in symptomology but there\nwere increases in dopamine release\nwithin those patients brains which on\nthe face of it should make no sense\nhowever when people with Parkinson's or\npeople who even don't have Parkinson's\nare told a given drug can increase\ndopamine and then they put these people\ninto a brain Imaging device it's called\na pet device has nothing to do with\nanimals it's the patron emission\ntomography device and these people had\nbeen injected with or consumed something\ncalled raclopride it sounds really weird\nand dangerous but actually ride looks a\nlittle bit like dopamine itself\nchemically and it has a little tag or\nlabel on it and it can bind to certain\nreceptors in the brain where dopamine\nwould normally bind what was observed is\nthat the placebo itself was causing\nreduced binding of this rack Pride to\nareas of the brain that have dopamine\nreceptors which meant unequivocally that\nthere was more dopamine released in the\nbrain because if more dopamine is\nreleased in the brain and parks in those\nreceptors well then the rprod which\nlooks a lot like dopamine can't also\npark or bind to those receptors simply\nput a placebo drug again a drug that has\nno direct action on the dopaminergic\nsystem if it's given to somebody who has\nParkinson's or who doesn't and they are\ntold this drug is going to increase\nlevels of dopamine in your brain and\npotentially improve your symptoms of\nParkinson's or have some other effect\nwell it succeeded in increasing dopamine\nlevels within the brain which basically\nshould make us all sit back and say okay\nwhat are we to think of drugs like elopa\nand apomorphine bromocryptine as\ncompared to placeo why isn't everyone\njust taking Placebo why aren't we just\ntelling people hey this sugar pill is\ngoing to increase dopamine well two\nimportant points to answer that first of\nall the increases in dopamine that are\nobserved from Placebo plus information\nabout what that Placebo ought to do for\nincreasing dopamine are not as robust or\nI should say generally not as robust as\nthe increases in dopamine observed from\nan actual drug known to increase\ndopamine transmission or release within\nthe brain the second point is that the\nstructure of the information given to\nsomebody and the belief that they form\nabout what ought to happen that is the\nexpectation effect which you'll start to\nrealize more and more across today's\nepisode that expectation effect really\nis the underpinning of the placebo\neffect well the strength of that\nexpectation is really hard to Anchor\nacross individuals and in fact if people\nrealize they're taking a placebo the\nmagnitude of of the dopamine increase is\nactually decreased so this is why we use\nPlacebo controls in clinical trials we\nwant to establish the real difference\nbetween the effect of a given drug on a\nbiological system in this case\nincreasing dopamine from the belief or\nthe expectation of what that drug will\ndo so in that sense the placebo is\nreally a measure of expectation of what\na drug treatment will do at least in the\ncontext of a drug trial so I mentioned\nthis somewhat complicated example\nbecause first of all many people are\ninterested in dopamine we all make\ndopamine it's involved in motivation\ndrive and focus and reward all sorts of\nthings that we hear a lot about these\ndays second of all it really illustrates\nthat Placebo that is expectation about\nwhat will happen is impacting of course\nPlacebo effects you realize that now but\nit then also has to be the case that\nPlacebo effects are playing into any\neffect that we might observe from taking\na given drug or supplement based on our\nour expectation of what that drug or\nsupplement will do and miraculously or\nat least what I find miraculous is that\nPlacebo effects these expectations based\non knowledge and beliefs are highly\nspecific which raises all sorts of\nquestions about for instance if you were\ngiven a drug that increases dopamine\nlevels but you weren't told that it\nincreases dopamine levels that perhaps\nyou were told you were lied to and told\nthat it increases the activity of a\ndifferent neuromodulator like serotonin\nwould it well let's explore that because\nas wild as that seems it turns out that\nwhat we believe about a given drug\ntreatment or behavioral treatment\nactually has a high degree of\nspecificity so to illustrate the\nincredible specificity of placebo\neffects I want to describe a study\nrelated to hormone function hormones\ncome in many different forms we have\ntestosterone estrogen growth hormone\ncortisol Etc there's a study that was\ncarried out in humans in which subjects\nwere informed about growth hormone\nrelease and cortisol release growth\nhormone is a hormone released from a\ngland in the brain called the pituitary\nthe pituitary has different parts the\nanterior pituitary releases growth\nhormone each night when you go to sleep\nit's involved in protein synthesis\ntissue repair bodily growth appendage\ngrowth and many other things cortisol is\na hormone that's released from the\nadrenals it can also be synthesized and\nreleased a couple other places in the\nbrain and body and it's involved in\nimmune system function in\nanti-inflammatory action a lot of people\nthink cortisol is bad but it's actually\nan important hormone for our daily\nHealth our alertness and waking up in\nthe morning Etc in any event subjects in\nthis study learned about growth hormone\nand cortisol and their release where\nthey're released from what they do just\nas you did and then their growth hormone\nand cortisol levels were measured and\nnot surprisingly they didn't change just\nlearning about growth hormone and\ncortisol did not change growth hormone\nor cortisol levels in these human\nsubjects now on days two and three of\nthis experiment subjects received an\ninjection of a drug the drug is called\nsumatriptan and sumatriptan is known to\nincrease levels of growth hormone and\nreduce levels of cortisol and indeed\nthat's what they observed when people\nreceived these injections and then their\nblood was drawn growth hormone levels\nwent up cortisol levels went down now\nthe interesting part of the study is a\nseparate day okay so after the drug\ntreatments they come back and they are\ninjected with saline which has no\nspecific biologic effect it's simply\nsaltwater okay they're injected with\nsaline and they experience increases in\ngrowth hormone and decreases in cortisol\nwhich on the face of it might seem like\nwow that's incredible but based on what\nyou've learned thus far in today's\nepisode you could imagine that knowledge\nabout growth hormone and cortisol\nsomehow combined with the injection to\nlead to an expectation of increases in\ngrowth hormone and decreases in cortisol\nwhich would be amazing in its own r\nright okay after all saline is inert it\ndoesn't do anything directly and\nspecifically to the growth hormone or\ncortisol system but get this it turns\nout that a saline injection which does\nnothing on its own on day four or five\nafter people have received this drug\ntreatment increases growth hormone and\ndecreases cortisol independent of what\npeople are told they are being injected\nwith even if they are told they are\nbeing injected with a drug that has\ncompletely different effects than\nsumatriptan so why would this be how\ncould this be in fact there was even a\ncondition in which subjects were told on\nthe day they receed the placebo you're\nabout to get an injection of something\nthat's going to decrease growth hormone\nbut rather they experienced a genuine\nincrease in growth hormone and decrease\nin cortisol in the exact same way they\ndid when they received the active drug\nSumma triptan okay so this wild type of\nscenario has to be explained and in\norder to explain it we need to zoom out\nfrom the experiment and ask what's the\nsimilarity between Day 2 and three of\nthe experiment meaning the days in which\nthe people received the actual active\ndrug sumatriptan that increases growth\nhormone reduces cortisol and the day in\nwhich they receive the placebo and the\none thing that anchors both those days\ntogether meaning the one thing in common\nthat can explain this effect is that\nthose were the days in which people\nreceived an injection and in fact\nthrough various control experiments and\na few other experiments that were done\nsubsequent to this because this\nexperiment has been more or less\nrepeated in different forms in different\nLaboratories it became clear that the\nbrain and body somehow came to expect\nthat receiving an injection leads to\nincreases in growth hormone and cortisol\nnow this is not an indefinite effect\nright people will get injections of\nother things in the future presumably\nactive drugs not just saline that will\nchange hormone levels or change\nneurotransmitter levels but in this\nexperiment what happened is is is that\nthere was a pairing within the nervous\nsystem there was a somehow a binding of\nthe notion of getting an injection with\na syringe which in the first case was of\na drug that increases growth hormone\ndecreases cortisol and then when\nsubjects came back and were injected\nwith a different syringe presumably I\nwould hope so with a different syringe\nfilled with saline even though the\nsaline should do nothing the body and\nbrain had somehow formed a pairing an\nassociation between syringe injection\nand increased growth hormone decreased\ncortisol which is incredible given that\nthese systems the anterior pituitary the\nadrenal glands I mean these are ancient\nsystems that to our knowledge we can't\ndirectly control with our mind I can't\nsimply like close my eyes and grit my\nteeth and cause the release of growth\nhormone I can't simply decide to deploy\ncortisol from my adrenals although if I\nthought about something very very\nstressful for a long time there'd\nprobably be some cortisol secretion but\nto our knowledge there is no way to use\nthoughts to use beliefs to use\nunderstanding of knowledge to cause\nchanges in our endocrine glands right\nour hormone glands the pituitary the\nadrenals but here we have a case where a\ndrug that increases certain hormones and\ndecreases other hormones simply by\nvirtue of the fact that it was injected\ninto somebody leads to a case where\nsubsequent injections at least in the\nshort run lead to the exact same hormone\nchanges simply because in the mind and\nor body of these individuals injection\ncomes to equal increase in growth\nhormone decrease in cortisol independent\nof what's being injected now a key point\nis that had on the final day of the\nexperiment the subject's been injected\nwith a different drug that for instance\nyou know increases serotonin or reduces\nepinephrine I doubt that they would have\ninstead experienced increases in growth\nhormone and reductions in cortisol\nthat's simply not the case the fact that\nthere was only saline in there meant\nthat there was an opportunity for the\nthe syringe and the injection we don't\nknow which to lead to some sort of pair\ndissociation in the brain and body that\nled to increased growth hormone\ndecreased cortisol which mimic the drug\neffect but the whole scenario here as\nwild as it is really speaks to the fact\nthat often times we think a given\ntreatment is causing a given effect only\nbecause of the action of the drug or the\naction of a given behavioral protocol\nbut in fact the drug and the protocol\nexist in a big context of different\nthings that the brain and body are\nintegrating and trying to make sense of\nand that often gets lumped together I\noften say that your brain is yes a\nprediction machine but it's also trying\nto simplify things in those predictions\nit's not taking into account all the\ninformation it's often lumping\ninformation together and coming up with\nideas about what's going to happen and\nwhy and doing this subconsciously in a\nway that as you just learned can have\nprofound effects on what happens within\nus even at the level of something as\nbasic as hormone release now what I just\ndescribed is a pretty extreme example\nand it's a very experimental condition\ntype example I mean it's rare that\npeople are undergoing uh you know these\nkinds of organized receival of\ninformation followed by specific drug\ntreatments and Placebo injections Etc\nbut you've all experienced the placebo\neffect in action by way of what's called\nclassical conditioning simply by virtue\nof the fact that the smells of certain\nfoods and your past experience of\ncertain foods can lead to the release of\na hormone called insulin insulin is a\nhormone that is involved in regulating\nblood glucose blood sugar and typically\nwhen insulin levels go up in the\nbloodstream glucose levels are going to\ngo down because of the way that insulin\ncontrols blood sugar levels now if\nyou've ever had the experience of\nwalking past a bakery or a pizza shop\nwhere a delicious smell is wafting out\ninto the environment you may notice that\nit quote unquote makes you hungry and\nindeed it does make you hungry because\npresumably you've had the experience of\ncertain smells being associated with the\nconsuming of certain foods maybe Bakery\nFoods maybe pizza maybe steak whatever\nit is\nand the consumption of those Foods\nactually leads to increases in insulin\nin your bloodstream well there's the\nso-called conditioning effect whereby\nthe smell of the food itself starts to\nlead to increases in insulin but the\nconditioning effects of different\nstimuli different things in the context\nof eating and specific Foods leading to\nincreases in insulin is actually highly\nhighly modifiable so much so that\nexperiments have been done where for\ninstance\nsomebody eats a particular food or in\nsome cases it's just directly injected\nwith insulin but more often consumes a\nparticular food and just prior to\nconsuming or during consuming that food\nthere's a bell ringing or a buzzer in\nthe background going off and they do\nthat a few times and then I'm sure\nyou're anticipating what's coming\nsomebody can just hear the buzzer or the\nBell can simply ring and that person\nwill experience an increase in insulin\nso what I'm describing is a conditioned\ninsulin response a stimulus such as a\nbell or a buzzer that on its own should\nhave zero effect on insulin release has\nbeen paired with a food that genuinely\nincreases insulin within the bloodstream\nand then even if the food isn't present\nthe stimulus the buzzer the Bell Etc can\nevoke the insulin response now this is\nan important example to understand\nbecause it's a common one that we've\npresumably all experienced and that\nexists within the wiring of our brain\nright now but it's different than the\nsmell evoking the insulin response\nbecause delicious food which evokes an\ninsulin response having a particular\nodor that makes sense in the context of\nfood but here we're talking about\nsomething completely unrelated to the\nfood not the odor not the taste not the\nappearance just something that happened\nto be in the environment in which you\nate the food leading to an increase in\ninsulin and it just screams placebo\neffect but it also screams that the\nplacebo effect is strongly modifiable\naccording to context again the\nprefrontal cortex being the seat of the\nanticipation or placebo effect effect\nand the prefrontal cortex taking into\naccount lots of things in the\nenvironment trying to understand what's\nhere what sounds what smells what colors\nand then lumping all of that together\nand eventually through the activation of\nspecific neural circuits leading to a\nvery basic hormonal response in this\ncase the release of insulin and of\ncourse what I just described is\nclassical conditioning Allah Pavlov\nPavlov won the Nobel Prize for his\ndescription of classical conditioning in\nwhich dogs could be induced to Elevate\nin anticipation of food by way of a\nstimulus completely unrelated to food\nitself not the smell not the look not\nthe taste rather just a bell rung before\nthe consumption of food in a dog\neventually led to a situation where the\nmere ringing of a bell could evoke\nsalivation from those dogs so are we all\njust like salivating dogs I guess we are\nI'd like to take a brief moment and\nthank one of our sponsors and that's ag1\nag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens I started\ntaking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I\nstarted taking it and the reason I still\ntake it every day is that it ensures\nthat I meet all of my quotas for\nvitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dop and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are a number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in sufficient quantities so ag1\nallows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports\nso many different systems within the\nbody that are involved in mental health\nphysical health and performance to try\nag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and\nyou'll get a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman okay so given that context is a\npowerful modifier of the placebo effect\nand in fact may be Central to the\nplacebo effect I just want to Rattle off\nof few of the known Placebo effects that\nhave been demonstrated which show the\nextent to which your brain and my brain\nare coming up with ideas about what\ngiven drugs or given behavioral\ntreatments ought to do and in that way\nshaping what happens when you take a\nplacebo or and this is an idea that\nwe'll go into in a bit more detail in a\nfew minutes perhaps context is also\nchanging the way that active drugs not\nplacebos but active drugs are impacting\nyour brain and body the examples i' like\nto give our from laboratory studies\nabout the placebo effect but that relate\nto very common at home and normal life\nscenarios okay they are not unique to\nthe laboratory and they are the\nfollowing first of all Placebo effects\nare strongly modifiable by the\nexpectation of the quality of a given\ntreatment for instance if you are given\na placebo that has a brand name on it or\na name of a drug it could even be a\nmadeup name you don't know what the drug\ndoes does but it has trademark TM there\nin the corner of the name so brand name\nas opposed to generic Placebo the brand\nname Placebo has a stronger effect\nmoreover if a placebo is placed into a\npackage not just put in front of you on\na little tray or in a little dish but\nrather in a package where you have to\npush it through that little foil\nwrapping or you have to take it out of a\nbottle and especially if that wrapping\nor bottle has a label on it or it looks\nas if it's a quote unquote real drug\nwell then the placebo has an even\ngreater placebo effect the color of a\ngiven drug can even have an effect based\non our association or expectation of\nwhat different colors relate to in terms\nof our physiology for\ninstance if subjects are given pills\nthat they are told will help them fall\nand stay\nasleep and some subjects are given blue\npills other subjects are given Red pills\nother subjects are given yellow pills\nthe subjects that take the blue pills\ntend to sleep better even though all the\npills regardless of color are Placebo\nthey contain no active substance okay so\nfor some reason most people associate\nthe color blue with sleep whereas or I\nshould say by contrast if people are\ngiven a blue a red or a yellow pill and\nthey are told it's a stimulant the\nsubjects taking the red pill here I mean\nthe actual literal red pill I'm not\ntalking about any kind of cultural red\npill I haven't seen The Matrix yet\npeople tell me I need to see it but I'm\nnot talking about taking the red pill\nquote unquote I'm talking about taking a\npill that is the color red in an\nexperiment the people that take that\npill experience a greater Placebo\ninduced stimulant effect as opposed to\nwhen subjects take a blue or a yellow\npill for some reason the color red is\nassociated with a quote unquote upper\neffect or stimulant effect moreover if\nsubjects are given a blue a red or a\nyellow pill and they are told that the\npill will have an anti- depressant\neffect the subjects that took the yellow\nPlacebo get the biggest anti-depressant\neffect so color of a given pill even\nimpacts the direction or in this case\nthe magnitude of the placebo effect and\nI should mention that in every one of\nthose studies yes there was information\nabout what the given pill should do it\nwas not the case that if people took the\nred pill they felt a stimulant effect if\nthey took a blue pill they felt a sleepy\neffect and if they took the yellow pill\nthey felt an anti-depressant effect\nthese were three separate experiments\none on sleep where subjects were given\none of the three colors of pills blue\nhad the strongest effect or a study of\nstimulant effects they were told it's a\nstudy pills that will increase alertness\nand attention they were given one of\nthree different colors the red pills had\nthe biggest effect and the third\nexperiment subjects were told this is a\npill that will alleviate to some degree\nyour symptoms of depression the people\nwho took the yellow pill experienced the\ngreatest relief of depressive symptoms\nnow that's pretty wild but what perhaps\nis even Wild ER is the more invasive a\nplacebo intervention is the greater the\nplacebo effect so capsules have a bigger\neffect than tablets I don't know if\nthat's more invasive but I guess it\nlooks more medicinal to have a capsule\nversus a tablet who knows why but that's\nwhat's been observed an injection of a\nplacebo has a greater effect than a\nconsumption of a capsule or a tablet of\ncourse and if people are placed into a\nmedical device or machine especially in\ncases where one of their limbs or both\nof their limbs or even their whole body\nis placed into a device even though the\ndevice is doing absolutely nothing\nspecifically to our biological system it\nis inert right a bunch of buttons and a\nbunch of noises and a bunch of humming\nas if something were happening but\nnothing is happening that directly\nrelates to any one specific biological\nsystem except and now you know what I'm\nabout to say except expectation of what\nthe machine is doing well that has the\ngreatest placebo effect of all\nso for some reason as the level of\ninvasiveness or the let's just say the\ncomplexity of a given treatment is\nincreased well then the magnitude of the\nplacebo effect is also increased and\nwhat this tells us is that the human\nbrain has come to associate level of\ninvasiveness level of complexity of a\ngiven treatment or machine to equate to\nbigger outcomes and in some sense that's\ncompletely logical but again we have to\nremember in absolutely zero of these\nconditions whether or not it's a tablet\na capsule an injection or a medical\ndevice is there anything being done to\nthese human subjects that impacts a\nspecific biological function except one\nand that one again is the activation of\nspecific neural circuits in the\nprefrontal cortex that then are able to\ncommunicate with other areas of the\nbrain and body through Bonafide\nbiological mechanisms of\nneurotransmitter release and electrical\nactivity in neurons this is what the\nbrain does and of course the prefrontal\ncortex being part of the brain those are\nthe mechanisms it employs to change the\nactivity of hormone relasing glands to\nchange the activity of other neurons in\nother words the belief effects the\nexpectations are real they are having\neffects through true biological\ncircuitry it's just that the pills and\nthe treatments and the machines are not\ndoing anything specific at all except\nactivating expectation so we've been\ntalking about the placebo effect and\nI've been giving examples of strong\nPlacebo effects and while all of what I\ntold you is substantiated by data I do\nnot want to give you the impression that\nthe placebo effect is Limitless because\nit is not Limitless for instance\nplacebos have been used to help in the\ntreatment of cancer but their effects\nwithin the treatment of cancer are\nlimited to a very specific set of\nsymptoms and context so for instance\npeople who are told a given drug will\nhelp them with their cancer by reducing\ntheir symptoms of chemotherapy or\nradiation therapy all often experience\nreductions in the negative symptoms of\nchemotherapy or radiation therapy\nreduced pain reduced nausea and by\nconsequence improved feelings of\nwell-being compared to people who do not\nreceive the placebo and who are not told\nhey this drug which in reality is a\nplacebo is going to help you with your\ntreatment it's going to make it less\nuncomfortable okay so in the context of\ncancer treatment Placebo can reduce the\ndiscomfort of various cancer treatments\nhowever placebos cannot reduce the size\nor eliminate tumors if people who\nunfortunately have tumors okay cancer\nare given a placebo and told this drug\nwhich actually is a placebo unbeknownst\nto them is going to reduce the size of\nyour tumors or eliminate your tumors\nthat Placebo is not effective in\nreducing the size or eliminating those\ntumors this is very important to\nunderstand because as you recall Placebo\neffects are expectation effects\nexpectation effects are driven in large\npart by the prefrontal cortex and its\nconnectivity to other areas of the brain\nand thereby to the body but the outputs\nof the prefrontal cortex are limited\nthere are a certain number of them and\nindeed there are many of them but those\nconnections do not extend to tumors\nthemselves or biological systems or\ncircuitries that allow one's beliefs to\nreduce the size of or eliminate tumors\nand this is very important because\nunfortunately there are many sufferers\nof cancer and there are many theories\nabout accelerating the treatment of or\nimproving the treatment of or even\ncuring cancer using so-called mindbody\ntechniques or mindbody tools and we need\nto be fair to the data which have\nconclusively shown that reductions in\nstress improvements in sleep social\nsupport a number of things can improve\ncancer treatment outcomes now those are\nnot Placebo effects those are all\npractices for which we know there are\nreductions in inflammation reductions in\nstress hormones that lead to improved\noutcomes in the context of radiation\ntherapy in the context of um\nimmunotherapy in the context of any\nBonafide treatments known to reduce\ntumor size so what we need to do is\nseparate out three things here\nbehavioral practices such as meditation\nsleep social support known to reduce\ninflammation and stress and that can\nimprove cancer outcomes those are not\nPlacebo effects those are real effects\nthere are also drugs radiation\nchemotherapy immunotherapy and devices\nknown to reduce tumor size and hopefully\neliminate cancerous tumors that would be\nthe hope those are real effects and then\nthere are the placebo effects the\nknowledge and belief and expectation\nabout what a given treatment will do in\nsome cases it's knowledge about what a\ngiven drug will do that improves the\noutcome achieved with that drug in some\ncases it's people being given a\ncompletely inert substance or solution\nlike saline solution but being told this\nis going to help with your nausea\nsymptoms this is going to help with your\npain during your immunotherapy radiation\nEtc and those are real effects but they\ncan only be explained by virtue of\nexpectation and knowledge AKA Placebo\neffects and I want to emphasize that\nthose Placebo effects are not acting\ndirectly on tumors to reduce their size\nor eliminate them another example of how\nplacebo effects can be very powerful and\nyet still have limits to them is yet\nanother study from Dr Ted cap truks Lab\nat Harvard Medical School and by the way\nmany not all of the studies that I've\nbeen describing today have been done by\nthe captrick lab he's done beautiful\nwork on Placebo effects for a very long\ntime now he's considered a real Pioneer\nand a leader in the study of placebo and\nhe's also been a big proponent of\nexploring the placebo effect not simply\nas a contrast to drug effects or device\neffects but as their own specific effect\nthat perhaps can be leveraged in the\ncontext of treating disease so hats off\nliterally plural hats off because\nthey've had oh so many discoveries in\nthe context of placebo and their\npowerful effects and their possible uses\nfrom the capu lab and their colleagues\nthere at Harvard Medical School just\nincredible work and one of my favorite\nstudies from the cap lab is one\npublished in the New England Journal of\nMedicine some years ago in in which they\ntook people who had asthma so these are\npeople diagnosed with asthma these are\npeople who have challenges breathing and\nthey experienced a lot of discomfort in\ntrying to breathe normally unless they\nare taking their asthma medication in\nthis study they took people off of their\nasthma medication of course not\nindefinitely but for a short period of\ntime and as expected those people\nexperienced challenges in breathing and\ndiscomfort associated with the\nchallenges in\nbreathing one group received no\ntreatment they were just taking off\ntheir\nasthma meds and evaluated and then of\ncourse put back on their asthma meds\nanother group received a placebo\ntreatment and another group received a\ndrug known to improve the symptoms of\nasthma now what was interesting is that\nthe people who receiv received the drug\nfor the treatment of asthma not\nsurprisingly had improvements in\nbreathing and less discomfort it's\nexactly what you'd expect however the\npeople with Placebo also experienced\nless discomfort in breathing\nbut their patterns of breathing didn't\nchange so again this really speaks to\nthe fact that Placebo effects can be\nvery powerful but that they're very\nspecific they are not simply wiping out\na condition like asthma or completely\neliminating all simpology of a given\ncondition like cancer this study\nillustrates very clearly that Placebo is\neffective in reducing the discomfort\nassociated with the challenges of\nbreathing but not eliminating challenges\nwith breathing per se where as as I\nmentioned before there are drugs\nBonafide prescription drug treatments\nthat can both restore normal patterns of\nbreathing and relieve the discomfort so\nwhat this really speaks to is the fact\nthat the prefrontal cortex and its\ninvolvement and expectation can have\npowerful effects on things like pain\npowerful effects on things like dopamine\npowerful effects on any number of\ndifferent brain and body systems but not\nall of them our beliefs and expectations\nare powerful as evidenced by the place\nEO effect itself but they are not what\nwe call omnipotent they can't do\nanything and everything I'd like to take\na quick break and thank our sponsor\ninsid tracker inside tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals now\nI've long been a believer in getting\nregular blood work done for the simple\nreason that many of the factors that\nimpact your immediate and long-term\nHealth can only be analyzed from a\nquality blood test a major problem with\na lot of blood tests out there however\nis that you get information back about\nmetabolic factors lipids and hormones\nand so forth but you don't know what to\ndo with that information with inside\ntracker they make it very easy because\nthey have a personalized platform that\nallows you to see the levels of all\nthose things metabolic factors lipids\nhormones Etc but it gives you specific\ndirectives that you can follow that\nrelate to nutrition behavioral\nmodifications supplements Etc that can\nhelp you bring those numbers into the\nranges that are optimal for you if

the context of placebo is a\npaper that was published pretty recently\nand the title of this paper is nicotine\nrelated beliefs induce dose dependent\nresponses in the human brain and if ever\nthere was a paper that pointed to the\nfact that our belief systems can really\nshape the way that different drugs\ndifferent supplements different\nbehavioral protocol s can impact the way\nthat our physiology and our brain work\nit's this paper it's a pretty\nstraightforward study it was of course\ncarried out in humans and what they did\nis they had people Vape\nnicotine nicotine is a known cognitive\nenhancer nicotine so named because it\nbinds to nicotinic acetylcholine\nreceptors in the brain which is just\nfancy nerd speak for The receptors the\nlittle parking spots for acetylcholine a\nneuromodulator that's involved in\nattention and by virtue of being\ninvolved in attention is critical for\nthe performance of certain focused tasks\nokay so most people associate nicotine\nwith smoking vaping dipping or snuffing\nhere we're talking about nicotine that's\nVaped however I want to be very clear I\nam not encouraging people to vape\nnicotine yes vaping is probably\nhealthier for you than smoking but\nvaping is not good for you it would be\nbetter to not vape than to vape at all I\ndid an entire episode about Nic\nso I want to leave aside the issue of\nwhether or not you decide to use\nnicotine okay that's all covered in the\nepisode on nicotine I'll provide a link\nto that in the show note captions\nthere's a lot of considerations there it\ndoes increase blood pressure and it\nincreases vasal constriction and on and\non but as I mentioned nicotine is a\ncognitive enhancer it can increase focus\nand attention and in doing so it can\nallow your brain to do certain things\nbetter like task switching like focusing\nin the context of a lot of distraction\netc etc so in this study Nick nicotine\nrelated beliefs induced dose dependent\nresponses in the human brain\nsubjects used a vape to ingest nicotine\nand they were told that they were either\ningesting a low medium or high\nconcentration of nicotine and a really\nnice thing about this study is that they\nactually measured how much nicotine\npeople Vaped so they were able to\nmeasure how much nicotine made it into\nthe bloodstreams of these people and\nthey were also able to evaluate brain\nactivity in areas of the brain known to\nhave these Nic IC receptors and to also\nbe involved in certain cognitive tasks\nso just to get to the Grand conclusion\nof the study what they found is that\npeople who were told that they ingested\na high concentration or a medium\nconcentration of nicotine performed\nbetter on a cognitive task that we know\nis dependent on or can be modified by\nthe amount of acetylcholine transmission\nin a certain area of the brain then did\nindividuals who were told that they\ningested a small concentration of\nnicotine now the interesting part of the\nstudy is that everybody consumed the\nsame amount of nicotine so here we have\na situation where there is a so-called\ndose dependent placebo effect everyone\ngets the same amount of nicotine but\npeople are either told meaning they were\nlied to in some cases that they got a\nsmall medium or high concentration of\nnicotine and for the group that was told\nthat they received a medium\nconcentration of nicotine they performed\nbetter on a cognitive task than did the\npeople who were told they received a\nsmaller concentration of\nnicotine moreover people who were told\nthat they received a high concentration\nof nicotine performed better than either\nthe individuals who were told they\nreceived a medium or small concentration\nof nicotine but as I mentioned before\neveryone received the same concentration\nof nicotine so this tells us that not\nonly are Placebo effects related to\nexpectation but that the expectation\nsomebody has of the degree of an effect\nthey should expect experience actually\ncreates a different level of experience\nput differently if you're told that\nyou're getting a small amount of drug a\nmedium amount of drug or a high amount\nof drug and that the size of an effect\ngets bigger as you go from small medium\nto high well then you will experience\nthe small medium or high effect\ndepending on which group you were in\neven if you all got the same dose of\ndrug now I need to be very clear\neverybody got actual nicotine the\nplacebo effect here is related to what\npeople believed about the dose of\nnicotine they got but everyone got\nactive nicotine now here's where it gets\nreally cool as I mentioned earlier in\nthis study they imaged the brains of\npeople that were in either the group\nthat was told they got a small or medium\nor high concentration of nicotine and\nwhat they found is that in the specific\narea of the brain that is known to\nrespond to nicotine and that is involved\nin cognitive functioning related to the\ntask that these subjects were given they\nsaw increased levels of activity of the\nneurons in that brain region that scaled\nup according to whether or not people\nwere told they got a small medium or\nhigh amount of nicotine again everyone\ngot the same amount of nicotine they\nwere simply told small medium or high\nand the Brain area itself changed its\nlevel of activity which in turn changed\nthe outcome on the cognitive task which\nbasically puts everything in a really\nnice box wraps it up with wrapping paper\nbeautiful puts it in a bow and says okay\nPlacebo effects are real and Placebo\neffects scale with the degree of\nexpectation that one has so anytime we\nare told that a small dose of something\nis going to lead to a small effect a\nmedium dose of something is going to\nlead to a bigger effect and a high dose\nwill lead to an even higher effect well\nwhether or not that occurs is going to\ndepend a lot on what sorts of quote\nunquote effects we are expecting again\nyou can't use Placebo to eliminate\ntumors there's a limit to what Placebo\neffects can occur but assuming that the\neffect that one is interested in is\nmodifiable by knowledge and expectation\nwell the size of that effect will scale\nwith how big you expect the effect to be\nand it's not purely psychological that's\nthe point here it's not just about your\nbeliefs and you doing something very\ndifferent in the context of a task or in\na sports event your physiology in this\ncase the activity of a specific brain\nregion increases its level of output\naccording to your expectation of the\nlevel of drug you consumed so in my\ndescription of that recently published\nstudy you notice I said Placebo effects\nbut in many ways what I was describing\nwere belief effects it's a little bit\ndifficult to disentangle what's a\nplacebo effect and what's a belief\neffect in general belief effects have to\ndo with acquiring a bit more information\nor specificity of information about what\nthe expectation should be so I suppose\nthe study I just described could would\neasily fall under the category of belief\neffects and not just Placebo effects but\nnonetheless belief effects are powerful\nand they're especially powerful because\nas one starts to layer in different\namounts and different types of\ninformation as to what a given drug\ntreatment or behavioral treatment will\ndo one can start to see really nuanced\noutcomes as well as truly surprising\noutcomes and some of my favorite studies\non belief effects were done by my\ncolleague at Stanford she's in the\ndepartment of psychology her name is Dr\nalah crumb she's been a guest on the\nhubman Lab podcast before we will also\nprovide a link to that episode and Ali's\nlab studies mindsets mindsets of course\nincorporate a lot of things besides\nbeliefs they involve prior knowledge\nthey tend to have even more information\nwoven into them than either Placebo\neffects or belief effects but alli's\nreally one of the world leaders in\nunderstanding these belief effects and\nhas done some just gorgeous work in\nillustrating the incredible range and\nextent of belief effects that exist one\nof my favorite studies in this context\nis the paper from alli's lab entitled\nMind Over milkshakes mindsets not just\nnutrients determine the grin response so\nhere I'll just briefly describe the\nstudy I'll paraphrase the abstract on\ntwo separate occasions people consumed a\n380 calorie milkshake and they were\neither told that it was a 620 calorie\nquote unquote indulgent shake or a 140\ncalorie quote unquote sensible Shake\nthen the hormone gin was measured gin is\na hormone associated with Hunger it is\nreleased from and binds to various sites\nwithin the brain and body but it's\ngenerally associated with The Hunger\nresponse the desire for food then their\nsubjects had their blood drawn at three\ndifferent time points so at Baseline\nprior to consumption of the milkshake\nanticipatory meaning just prior to\nconsuming the milkshake and post\nconsumption 90 minutes after consuming\nthe milkshake and then gin was measured\nwithin the blood samples that the people\nprovided now as you recall everyone is\nconsuming the same 380 calorie Shake but\nthat's unbeknownst to them one group\nthinks they're drinking an indulgent\nshake that has lots of calories the\nother group thinks they're ingesting a\nquote unquote sensible shake with fewer\ncalories and it's important to note that\nin the study the individuals were asked\nto read the labels of the shake and get\ninformation about okay this is an\nindulgent Shake has a lot of calories a\nlot of fat it's Etc in the other case\nthis shake has very few calories it\ncontains healthy ingredients Etc now you\ncan probably guess where this is going\nthe people that consumed the milkshake\nbut were told it was a high calorie\nindulgent shake and also by the way\nconsumed information about it being high\ncalorie and indulgent and they were\nreading that on the label experienced\nsteeper reductions in this hunger\nAssociated hormone called gin as\ncompared to the group that also consumed\nthe same 300 180 calorie Shake but\nthought that the shake was a sensible\nshake with fewer calories that was a\nhealthier shake those people experienced\nreductions in Gin as well but they were\nless steep they occurred less quickly\nover time and in addition their\nsubjective level of satiety of fullness\nor of feeling as if they had enough food\nto quell off hunger was also related to\nwhether or not they thought they had\nconsumed the higher calorie indulgent\nshake or the lower calorie sensible\nShake there are a bunch of other\ninteresting aspects to this study I'm\njust giving you a cursory overview of\nthe major effects but the takeaway is\nvery straightforward what we believe\nabout the foods we are consuming\nstrongly impacts the downstream hormonal\neffects of consuming those Foods gin\nafter all is a peptide hormone that is\nsecreted from the stomach okay yes the\nstomach has neurons but as far as we\nknow the stomach doesn't have a little\nthinking brain in there the stomach is\noperating in a very kind of crude\nlanguage of the nervous system as\ncompared to the thinking and analytic\nlanguage of the brain the forbrain but\nwhat's happening here is that knowledge\nindeed specific knowledge about what\nmore calories means as opposed to fewer\ncalories what the word indulgent means\nas opposed to sensible all of that is\nbeing combined and then communicating\nwith neurons and other systems of the\ngut to literally create a different\nhormonal response to food and that's\nincredible because the hormonal response\nto food is a very strongly evolutionary\nconserved set of mechanisms and yet this\nstudy and other studies like it\nincluding the conditioned insulin\nresponse that we talked about earlier\nyou know Pavlov's dogs or in this case\nwe are the pavlos dogs we're the ones\nthat can get conditioned to a bell or\nthe smell of a food or the sight of a\nsign on a bakery to get a insulin\nincrease all of that stuff that is\nprimitive hard wiring of the brain and\nbody is also being strongly impacted by\nthe more let's call it sophisticated or\nanalytic as aspects of the wiring of the\nbrain such as the prefrontal cortex such\nthat what we believe is going to happen\nis actually what happens now the other\nstudy on belief effects and mindsets and\nhow they can impact outcomes in terms of\nour physiology relates to exercise and\nthis is a study um that Dr Crum herself\ndescribed came about because she was\ntalking to one of her academic advisers\nthis was before she opened her own\nlaboratory and you know Aaliyah's an\nathlete she was actually a division\nathlete she's an incredibly impressive\nindividual by the way she's a tenure\nprofessor at Stanford uh she was a\ndivision one athlete she has a degree or\nrather a certification in Clinical\nPsychology so um she's an extremely\naccomplished individual but exercise in\nathletics have always been a big part of\nher life and one day she was talking to\nher adviser and her adviser offered the\npossibility that and here I'm\nparaphrasing from a different\nconversation perhaps all the positive\neffects of excise exercise are Placebo\nthat's actually what her adviser said\nand allly said no there's no way right\nwe know that you exercise you sure get\nan increase in heart rate and blood\npressure during exercise but that leads\nto lower levels of Baseline blood\npressure and heart rate afterwards after\nyou adapt to that exercise and her\nadviser said well okay that might be\ntrue but why don't you go test it so she\ndid test it what she did is she took\nhotel service workers so these are\npeople that clean hotel rooms for a\nliving and these are very active people\nright they're vacuuming they're changing\nsheets they're going upstairs they're\nfolding laundry they're doing a bunch of\ndifferent things throughout the day and\nthey divided them into two groups one\ngroup was told that doing a great job\nand being diligent is very good for you\nthey were told all sorts of things about\ntheir job and how it was important and\nindeed their job is important right we\nneed people who can perform these roles\nof turning over hotel rooms and doing\nthose sorts of things so that hotel\nrooms can be clean and beautiful When we\narrive the other group however was told\nthat the normal daily activities that\nthese people were partaking in the\nfolding of the laundry going up and down\nthe stairs pushing of carts Etc was\nexercise and more importantly that it\nwas the type of movement that could for\ninstance lead to reductions in blood\npressure reductions in body weight\nimprovements in lots of different Health\nmetrics now the incredible outcome of\nthe study was that simply on the basis\nof whether or not people were told and\ntherefore believ that their daily\nactivities would lead to improvements in\nthese different Health metrics\nreductions in blood pressure reductions\nin basil heart rate reductions in body\nweight well that's exactly what happened\npeople who received the information\nabout how exercise was healthy and their\nwork mimicked exercise experienced the\nhealth metric changes whereas people who\nwere simply told your work is important\nyou know it's important to do a good job\netc etc they did not experience the same\nHealth metric improvements so that\nprovides support for what Dr crumb's\nadviser had suggested that at least some\nof the effects of exercise are likely\ndue to mindsets or beliefs AKA belief\neffects so throughout today's episode\nI've been talking about how our\nexpectations and beliefs and mindsets\ncan impact these really deep layers of\nour physiology things like hormone\nrelease things like level of discomfort\nor pain during a given treatment and on\nand on and talked a lot about the\nprefrontal cortex as critical for\nunderstanding what's happening in a\ngiven context and for setting those\nexpectations because the prefrontal\ncortex as you recall is a prediction\nmachine and context is important for\nprediction and on and on what I haven't\nyet told you is how it is that the\nprefrontal cortex actually does this I\nmean what are these magical output\nPathways of the prefrontal cortex and\nwhile I already established that they\nare not infinite right the prefrontal\ncortex can't control everything meaning\nif I give you some information like you\nknow just thinking about and believing\nthat um your left quadricep is going to\nbe you know much stronger than your\nright quadricep and if you just keep\nperseverating on meaning you keep\nthinking about that and looping on in\nyour mind and I give you some examples\nof how you know thinking about strength\ncan make Muscle stronger and on and on\nyou know in the classic context of the\nplacebo effect all that expectation\nought to lead to an improvement in\nstrength and perhaps size of your left\nquadricep but that's not what happens\nwhy or more accurately why not well as\nfar as we know there isn't a direct\nneural circuit or hormonal pathway\nwhereby thoughts from the prefrontal\ncortex can impact the growth of muscles\nin your left quadricep however there are\noutput Pathways from the prefrontal\ncortex to regions of the brain that are\nknown to control very basic bodily and\nbrain functions such as the hypothalamus\nand those pathways are known to be able\nto change certain parameters of our for\ninstance stress response so blood\npressure heart rate Vaso constriction\neven body temperature so I just want to\ntake a moment and describe what I\nconsider one of the more beautiful\nstudies illustrating a specific pathway\nfrom the prefrontal cortex to the\nhypothalamus that allows control of the\nso-called stress response in the context\nof very specific psychological stressors\nnow this paper is important not just for\nour discussion of placebo belief and\nmindset effects but also for any\ndiscussion about so-called psychosomatic\neffects or the idea that our modes of\nthinking whether or not they are related\nto calmness or to stress can strongly\nimpact our physical health and the title\nof the paper is a Central master driver\nof Psychosocial stress responses in the\nrat goodness that's a tongue twister\npsychosocial stress responses in the rat\nnow the fact that this study was\nperformed in the rat should not cause us\nto lean away from it or to think that\nit's not relevant to humans because the\nvery same circuitries that are described\nwithin this study have analogous\ncircuitries within the human brain I\nknow that to be true from my work in\nneuron Anatomy teaching neuron anatomy\nand other groups separate from the group\nthat did this study have explored\nsimilar circuitries in the human brain\nnow in this study what they were able to\ndo was to identify these two particular\nregions which I'll just call them dpdt\nfor short so instead of saying dorsal\npeduncular cortex and dorsal tat tecta\nso just say DP dtt this is this area of\nthe prefrontal cortex okay don't let\nthese acronyms and names scare you these\nare just names of a little sub region\nwithin the prefrontal cortex send\nconnections little wires that we call\naxons to a area of the brain called the\ndorsal medial hypothalamus the dorsal\nmedial hypothalamus is a highly\nconserved structure meaning whether or\nnot you look in mouse or in rat or in\napes or in humans or in dogs the dorsal\nmedial hypothalamus contains neurons\nthat are involved in and generating\nCardinal features of the stress response\nthings like increased blood pressure\nthings like increased phasal\nconstriction things like increased body\ntemperature things like increased Brown\nfat thermogenesis now we can even go a\nstep further because that's what they\ndid in this study they mapped the\nconnections from these specific sub\nregions of the prefrontal cortex the\ndpdt down to the dorsal medial\nhypothalamus and a very specific set of\nneurons within the dorsal medial\nhypothalamus but even there we're still\nin the brain we haven't yet established\nhow activation of these specific neurons\nin the dorsal medial hypothalamus\nactually change blood pressure how they\nactually cause Vaso constriction in the\nperiphery because that's what happens\nwhen you get very stressed whether or\nnot it's from social stress or from cold\nwater there's a constriction we call\nVaso constriction in the periphery right\nblood is shuttled toward the core of the\nbody to keep your core organs alive\nyou're still going to get blood to the\nbig limbs of your body so you can move\nrun if you need to but you're digits\nyour appendages are going to get far\nless blood flow to them because of this\nphasal constriction and that's achieved\nby an output from the dorsam medial\nhypothalamus okay so the second Hub\nalong this chain to an area of the brain\nstem called the rostral medular raap\nokay again fancy name you don't have to\nremember the name if you don't want to\nmaybe you afficionados want to but what\nwe're doing here is we're moving from\nthe prefrontal cortex to the\nhypothalamus then to the brain stem and\nthen from the brain stem out to what we\ncall the periphery to the body to the\nspinal cord to the blood vessels\nthemselves to the organs of the body\nlike the gut and the heart and the lungs\nall the things that we associate with\nthe so-called stress response so as\nwe've been learning about Placebo\neffects and belief effects and mindset\neffects and learning that okay just our\nknowledge about something our\nanticipation our thinking can influence\nlevels of a hunger hormone isn't that\nwild or can influence the amount of pain\nthat we experience in response to a\ncancer treatment or can change the\namount of dopamine in the brain in the\ncontext of a placebo given to people\nwith Parkinson's well all of that seems\nvery very surprising until you look at\nstudies of the sort that I've been\ndescribing in the last few minutes that\nare starting to establish the very\nprecise neural circuitries that lead\nfrom areas of the brain like the\nprefrontal cortex that are associated\nwith thought and context and planning\nand prediction down to I don't want to\ncall them the deeper or more primitive\nlayers of the brain because these areas\nlike the hypothalamus and the medulla\nthe brain stem they're not really\nprimitive in the sense that they do very\nsophisticated things it's just that they\ntend to be present in both mammals and\nreptiles they're present in fish whereas\nthe prefrontal cortex is a brain\nstructure that has undergone fairly\nsignificant elaboration As you move from\nanimals like say cats dogs up to great\napes and to humans and at least to our\nknowledge as a field of neuroscientists\nand biologists humans have the most\nsophisticated or rather elaborate\nprefrontal cortex the most number of\ndifferent sub areas of the prefrontal\ncortex and every time there's an\ninvestigation of those sub areas what\nthey do what Their anatomies are meaning\nwhere they connect to and who connects\nback to them it's found that there is a\ntremendous degree of specificity all of\nwhich is to say that we shouldn't be\nsurprised at all that these Placebo\nbelief and mindset effects occur because\nthere's a clear biological substrate for\nthem so up until now we've been talking\nabout the placebo effect as these\nincredible set of effects that have a\nreal biological substrate there are\nanatomical Pathways hormonal Pathways\nneurotransmitters involved and that's\nall true but what's also true is that\nthe placebo effect can vary in size\ntremendously between individuals and\nacross different studies and in fact\nthis was described in the first formal\nstudy of the placebo effect in that\nstudy it was shown that approximately\n30% of the individuals in the study\nshowed a robust placebo effect but that\nthe other 70% showed a less robust\nplacebo effect and that result meaning\nthat variation in susceptibility to the\nplacebo effect has borne out again and\nagain and again across different studies\nnow modern science has now taught us\nthat if you look at the genomes the\ngenes that happen to be expressed in one\nindividual versus the next versus the\nnext versus the next there are certain\ngenes not a lot of them but there are\ncertain genes that seem to correlate\nwith certain types of placebo effect\nbeing greater or lesser in certain\nindividuals and while there are a lot of\nthese different genes and a lot of\ndifferent Placebo effects one of the\nmore interesting ones is the CT Gene\nwhich encodes for something called\ncatacol o methyl transfer cacal Oyl\ntrans phrase as the name suggests\nbecause it has a Ace in there in the\ncontext of a discussion about bi ology\nthat almost always means you're talking\nabout an enzyme catacol om methyl\ntransferase is an enzyme involved in the\nregulation of the so-called catac\ncolomines catac colomines being dopamine\nepinephrine and norepinephrine okay\nwe've already talked about dopamine in\nthe context of Parkinson's I've talked\nabout dopamine a lot frankly on the\nhuberman LA podcast because it's\ninvolved in motivation it's involved in\nFocus pursuit of reward it's involved in\nmovement as we discussed earlier\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine also do\nmany different things in the brain and\nbody but not the least of which is to\nincrease activation state for heightened\nFocus for increasing the bias toward\nmovement of the body and on and on in\nany event this Gene CT catacol o methyl\ntransferase seems to show strong\nvariation in individuals that show\nstrong variation in the placebo response\nto certain types of placebo conditions\nand I just mention it because a I think\nit's super interesting uh after all all\na lot of the studies that have\ndemonstrated Placebo effects have shown\nthose effects in the context of changes\nin dopamine epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine so it's not without\ncontext that we're talking about the CT\nGene but also just as a general theme\nthe fact that there are genes that\nencode for specific biological\nsubstrates in this case regulation of\ndopamine epinephrine and norepinephrine\nand those genes show up at different\nlevels in different individuals and the\nplacebo effects show up at different\nlevels and different individuals and now\nthere are studies that are starting to\nshow that the levels of those genes and\nthe degree to which one experiences the\nplacebo effect either elevated response\nor reduced response to the placebo\neffect seem to be fairly strongly\ncorrelated so this again is more\nevidence that yes the placebo effect is\nbased on knowledge belief expectation\nbut that it has a real biological\nsubstrate just as there are anatomical\nPathways out of the prefrontal cortex of\nthe hypothalamus down to the brain stem\nout to the body there are also genes\nexpressed in specific cells within our\nbrain and body that allow for our\nbeliefs and expectations that are\ncarried through that prefrontal cortex\ncircuitry to have either a greater or\nlesser effect so throughout today's\nepisode I've been talking about how\nknowledge your belief and understanding\nabout what might happen ought to happen\nor very likely will happen influences\nwhether or not that thing actually\nhappens the so-called placebo effect or\nbelief effect or mindset effect and what\nI hope I've made clear during the course\nof our discussion is that while Placebo\neffects arrive through our cognitive\nunderstanding of what might ought to or\nis likely to happen the downstream\neffects the effects on asthma irritable\nbowel syndrome insulin growth hormone\nyou know pick your favorite biological\nsystem essentially every system within\nthe brain and body has been shown to be\nsusceptible to Placebo effects but what\nI hope is becoming clear is that in\nevery case the placebo effect is a\nbiological effect it's not just you know\nour thoughts tricking us into thinking\nsomething happened that didn't happen\nit's our thoughts our mind creating real\nbiological effects if you're
