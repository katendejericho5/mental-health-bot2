    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast, where\nwe discuss science and science\nbased tools for everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nHello, everybody, and welcome.\nI want to thank all of you\npremium Huberman Lab podcast\nsubscribers for joining.\nThis is an exciting one.\nEven though the backdrop here\nlooks very much like the studio\nback in the United\nStates, I am doing\nthis AMA live from\nSydney, Australia,\nwhere I and the Huberman\nLab podcast team\nhave been for well over a week.\nWe were in Melbourne.\nAnd we just did two live\nshows here in Sydney.\nAnd we're headed off\nto Brisbane tomorrow.\nAnd it's been\nabsolutely delightful.\nWe've had so much fun talking\nscience, learning from people.\nIt's a wonderful place.\nI want to get right\ninto your questions\nand do my best to answer as\nmany of them as possible, as\nthoroughly, clearly, and\nsuccinctly as possible\nover the next hour.\nSo I'm going to dive into\nthose in just a moment.\nJust one last important\nthing before I\ndo that, which is that\nI want to thank everyone\nfor being a premium subscriber\nand let you know that we, based\non your contributions to the\npremium channel, have already,\nas you know, supported\nfour laboratories\nat Stanford Columbia University\nSalk Institute and elsewhere\nfor important projects on\nhumans that are already\nleading to important\ntherapeutic breakthroughs\nthat we will soon share with\nyou on the Huberman Lab podcast.\nBut that this year, 2024,\nwe were fortunate enough\nto secure no fewer than\nthree dollar for dollar match\ndonors who have\ngenerously agreed\nto match our contributions\nfrom the premium channel\nto additional projects.\nThose are going to\nhead out to a number\nof different universities\nand researchers\nworking again on human\nstudies, so no animal studies.\nHuman studies on\nimportant projects.\nEverything from novel treatments\nfor mental health issues,\nheadache and migraine,\nsome interesting stuff\non immunology and cancer,\nmindsets and immune system\nfunction, and much, much more.\nAlso nutrition, physiology,\nexercise physiology, et cetera.\nSo your contributions\nto the premium channel\nreally do make a difference.\nI can say this because I'm\nfamiliar with the challenges\nof raising funding for doing\ntruly breakthrough work\nand getting things quickly\nout to the general public.\nSo thank you, thank\nyou, thank you.\nAnd now, without further ado,\nlet's get to your questions.\nThe first question\nwas, is how are you\nmanaging to achieve\nyour key health\npillars while in Australia\nand any other place\nyou've enjoyed doing so,\nall while working so hard?\nWell, thanks for the question.\nI'll answer this\nquestion in the context\nof what I think we all\ncan, and should, and really\nwill do because if you're a\npremium channel subscriber,\nI'm certain that you're\ntaking your health seriously.\nSo first off, I\nthink there's a bit\nof a misconception about the\nprotocols on the Huberman Lab\npodcast being that we are\nall, including myself,\nsuper, super regimented\nabout them to the point where\nwe don't enjoy other\nthings in life,\nand that's simply not true.\nSo I view the protocols of\nthe Huberman Lab podcast\nas science-based,\nactionable, low cost,\nzero cost, minimal cost\nin almost all situations.\nThere are a few\nexceptions to that.\nBut it really designed to\nmesh with the rest of life\nand enhance mental health\nand physical health, which\nof course, means\nremaining social staying,\non typical sleep\nschedules, et cetera.\nSo the big ones for\nme when arriving here\nwere, of course, to get morning\nsunlight as often as possible.\nWe saw a beautiful sunrise\nthis morning over Sydney.\nBut even on the\novercast days, we've\nhad a few rainy\novercast days to really\nmake it a point to get outside\nand to get that morning\nsunlight.\nAlso, our crew did travel\nin with a red light.\nNot a red light panel, although\nI do have a couple red light\npanels.\nThose little portable ones\nthat I use from time to time.\nThe red lights I'm referring\nto in reference to answering\nthis question are the red lights\nwhich are just red light bulbs\nthat I actually travel with\na little red light bulb unit.\nIt's just like a\nsmall screwing unit.\nYou plug it in here with\nan adapter of course.\nAnd then in the evening,\nwe've switched off\nthe lights in the place\nwhere we're staying,\nand it just brings the\noverall levels of cortisol\ndown low very quickly,\nand it makes it very easy\nto get to sleep each night.\nIt makes a big, big difference.\nAnd this is a very\nlow cost tool.\nYou could essentially purchase\nany red light, even red party\nlights, and put those\nup, and then switch off\nthe regular overhead lights.\nIt makes a big difference, and\nit's probably even cost-saving.\nWe've also stayed fairly\nregimented about exercise.\nSo this morning, we took a\ngreat jog down to the ocean,\njumped in the ocean.\nIf you don't have access\nto an ocean on vacation,\njust getting outside and getting\nsome movement early in the day\ncan help shift your rhythm.\nReally the quadfecta of\nshifting your circadian rhythm\nin a new place or\nbecoming an early riser\nif you want to do that is\nmorning, sunlight movement,\nsocial engagement, and\nin my case, caffeine.\nAlthough some people would\nopt for eating breakfast,\nI just happen to prefer to eat\na little bit later in the day.\nSo when you combine\nthose things,\nyou are really amplifying\nthat morning cortisol increase\nthat I've talked\nabout on the podcast.\nMorning catecholamine release.\nSo dopamine, epinephrine,\nand norepinephrine.\nAnd those act in\nsynergy to create\nmore early day and daytime\nmood focus and alertness\nand enhance the transition\nto nighttime sleep.\nBut of course, that dimming of\nthe lights and maybe even red\nlight in the evening\nreally, really can help.\nAnd so those are the biggies.\nAnd then of course, if you want\nto shift your circadian rhythm\nreally quickly to be\non a local schedule,\nit helps to hop on the\nlocal meal schedule.\nBut for me, that always\nmeans skipping breakfast.\nI'm not a big breakfast eater.\nI like lunch and afternoon\nsnack sometimes and dinner.\nSo when you do all\nof those things,\nit makes it very easy to\nstay with the health pillars.\nAnd of course, stress\ncontrol is important.\nWe're doing lives.\nThere's a lot of work to do.\nSo there's a daily for\nme non-sleep deep rest\nor yoga nidra protocol.\nBy the way, you may be familiar\nwith non-sleep deep rest\nand yoga nidra.\nTerrific zero cost practice\nfor reducing stress, replacing\nor replenishing dopamine and\nmental and physical vigor.\nI've talked about this\nand the studies that\nsupport this on the podcast.\nThere's a Huberman\nNSDR script on YouTube.\nThat's, again, zero cost.\nBut while down here, we\nrecorded a 10-minute, 20-minute,\nand 30-minute NSDR script with\na view of a beautiful Sydney\nsunrise.\nThose should be posted\nto our Huberman Lab clips\nchannel in the not too\ndistant future, probably\nin the next couple of weeks.\nAnd then you can have\ndifferent duration NSDR scripts\nthat you can use,\nagain completely zero\ncost, any time you like.\nWe've recorded also some\nadditional meditations,\nand we're considering\nputting out\na Spotify album, if you\nwill, of NSDR and meditations\nthat are science-based,\nof different durations.\nSo if you like that\nidea, maybe just\ngive a shout into the\ninternet, and hopefully we'll\nhear it, or put a comment on the\nlatest episode of The Huberman\nLab podcast on YouTube.\nAnd if that sounds like\na good idea to you,\nwe will do more of that.\nThese are, again,\nzero costs, zero\nto access tools for\nenhancing mental health\nand physical health.\nSo combining all of those\nis really what we've done.\nNext question is I have\nfollowed your sleep advice,\nand I have seen a\nhuge improvement.\nGreat.\nHappy to hear that.\nWonderful.\nBut I still wake up at night\nand only get five or six hours.\nIs that enough?\nCan you please give\nmore advice if possible?\nWell, first of all, thanks for\ntuning in to the sleep advice.\nSo the question of\nwhether or not five or six\nhours is enough really\ndepends on person context.\nAnd by context, I\nmean it can even\nchange across the course of\nthe year by life circumstances.\nThe criteria for\ninsomnia are very clear.\nInsomnia is excessive\ndaytime sleepiness\ndue to lack of sleep at night.\nExcessive daytime sleepiness\ndue to lack of sleep at night.\nSo if you're not falling\nasleep during the day\nand you feel reasonably good\nthroughout the day, maybe\nyou only need a brief\n10-minute to 30-minute nap\nin the afternoon.\nSome people nap.\nSome people don't like to nap.\nDoesn't matter.\nBut if you feel pretty\ngood throughout the day\nand you have enough mental\nand physical energy and focus\nto complete the activities\nthat you need to complete,\nthen I wouldn't worry so\nmuch about five to six hours,\nand I wouldn't obsess over\nthese kind of scary things\nthat we hear.\nOh, if we're not getting\nseven to eight hours,\nthat we get dementia, et cetera,\nbecause that's not necessarily\nthe case.\nEveryone has\ndifferent sleep needs.\nThe other thing,\nand this is perhaps\nthe most important thing\nfor everybody listening\nto this really to think about\nis QQRT, which is quality,\nquantity, timing, excuse me.\nQuality, quantity,\nregularity, and timing.\nQQRT.\nQQRT.\nWhich is an acronym coined by\nthe great Matt Walker, author\nof the book Why We Sleep.\nHe has his own terrific\npodcast in his own right,\nhas a series on the Huberman\nLab podcast coming out soon.\nQQRT is what you really\nneed to think about when\nyou think about your sleep.\nSo you want to think\nabout the quantity.\nHow much are you getting?\nWell, you, Rema, who\nasked this question,\nare getting five to\nsix hours a night.\nOK, what about the\nquality of that sleep?\nIs it consistently five to\nsix hours with no breaks,\nor is there a break\nin the middle?\nOne trip to the restroom\nin the middle of the night\nis considered normal and\nhealthy for most people.\nIf you're making multiple trips\nto the restroom in the middle\nof the night or you're\nwaking up multiple times\nthroughout the night\non a regular basis,\nthat's something to\ntry and overcome.\nSo the quality\npiece is important.\nAlso, whether or not\nyou remember your dreams\nor you don't, you\nwant to make sure\nthat you're getting ample\namounts of slow wave\nsleep, which dominates the\nfirst half of your sleep night,\nand rapid eye movement\nsleep, which dominates\nthe second half of\nyour sleep night\nbecause they have\ndifferent roles in recovery\nof brain and body.\nNamely slow wave\na.k.a. deep sleep\nis responsible for\ngrowth hormone release.\nRapid eye movement sleep\nresponsible for the unpacking\nor the uncoupling of emotions\nto prior day and previous day\nexperiences.\nAnd in that way, acts as\na kind of scrubbing out\nor a therapy for\nyour emotional state.\nSo are you feeling emotionally\nrested when you wake up\nis a good indication\nof whether or not\nyou're getting enough\nrapid eye movement sleep.\nSome people like\nto sleep trackers,\nusing their Eight\nSleep or their WHOOP\nor their Oura Ring or\nsomething like that.\nI'm a fan of sleep\ntrackers, but I\nthink that relying too heavily\non sleep scores can be risky.\nThere are data from Alia\nCrum's Lab at Stanford showing\nthat if people receive a poor\nsleep score, even though they\nslept well, their\nperformance will drop.\nIf people get a\ngood sleep score,\neven though their\nsleep was lousy,\ntheir performance is\nmaintained or even enhanced.\nSo you don't want to\ntake any one sleep score\nand overinterpret it.\nYou want to look at the\naverage and compare that\nto your subjective\nexperience of sleep.\nMaybe I would say go about\nhalfway through your day\nif you can bear to do it before\nlooking at your sleep score\nand see how you feel.\nThen look at your\nsleep score as opposed\nto the other way around.\nThat might be a good way\nto adjust for that belief\neffect I just mentioned.\nBut if you're getting\nenough quantity,\nlet's say you get five\nto six hours and quality,\nyou're sleeping\nthrough that bout\nmaybe with one\nepoch of waking up.\nAnd then the regularity\nof your sleep\nis that you're going to sleep\nmore or less at the same time\neach night plus or minus an hour\non let's say five to six days\nper week because\nsometimes, we like\nto stay up on a weekend\nnight and have some fun\nor something like that.\nAnd then the timing,\nyou know, where\nthat sleep is falling in your\n24-hour schedule is really key.\nAnd here's what we're\nlearning as a field,\nthat for many people who are\nearly to bed, early to rise\ntypes, if they go to bed\naround 9:00 PM, 9:30,\nand they only get six hours\nof sleep, they feel great.\nWhereas if they get the\nequivalent amount of sleep\nbut go to bed at 11:00 PM or\nmidnight, they feel lousy.\nSimilarly, if\nyou're a night owl,\nyou're somebody\nthat really prefers\nto go to bed around 1:00 or\n2:00 AM and wake up around,\nlet's say, 10:00 AM, if you take\nthat equivalent amount sleep\nand you go to bed\nearlier, you're\ngoing to feel not so good.\nSo getting the\ntiming of your sleep\nin the 24-hour cycle correct\nand fairly consistent,\nthat's the R part of QQRT.\nCorrect is going\nto be beneficial.\nSo I wouldn't worry so much\nabout five to six hours only.\nHere's what I would do, Rima.\nI would take that\nfive to six hours.\nAnd before getting out\nof bed each morning,\nI would do a 10 to 30-minute\nNSDR non-sleep deep rest\nprotocol, which will allow\nyou to feel deeply rested\nand frankly, to recover\nwhatever bits of sleep\nthat you perhaps missed\nduring the night.\nI found that to be a\ntremendously beneficial\npractice.\nWaking up, if I\ndon't feel thoroughly\nrested, doing a 10\nto 30-minute NSDR.\nThen getting out of bed\nand continuing the day.\nAnd if you don't\nhave time to do that,\ndo that 10-minute,\nmaybe 20-minute later\nin the day at any point.\nAnd I think you'll see terrific\nresults not just because you're\nrecovering some sleep that you\nlost perhaps during the night\nor maybe you just need\nfive to six hours,\nbut also because you'll get\nbetter at falling and staying\ndeeply asleep through the\npractice of NSDR in the morning\nor at some point\nthroughout the day.\nI wouldn't recommend\nanything else\nelaborate unless\nyou're feeling really\nexhausted during the day.\nIn which case, then I would move\nto some of the more advanced\nsleep tools.\nI've had vertigo.\nI should announce,\nthis is a question.\nI'm not just telling\nyou about my vertigo.\nI've had vertigo on and off\nand wonder what causes it.\nIs it hormones, adrenals,\notoliths moving around?\nOh, this person knows\nabout the cochlea.\nHydration, virus exposure.\nZenana I think is how\nyou pronounce your name.\nForgive me if that's not the\ncorrect pronunciation, Zenana.\nSo vertigo is very interesting.\nUnfortunately,\nit's uncomfortable,\nbut we can learn a thing\nor two right now that\nshould be able to help\nyou, Zenana and others,\neven if they\nhaven't had vertigo.\nSo vertigo, this perception\nof falling or dizziness,\nneeds to be distinguished\nfrom lightheadedness.\nSo if you're ever\nfeeling dizzy, it's\nworth stopping and\nsitting, or if you\ncan't sit, standing\nand closing your eyes\nand asking yourself a question.\nDo I feel like I'm ready\nto fall straight down,\nor do I feel like I'm going\nto spin and fall down?\nBecause in answering\nthat question,\nyou can determine whether\nor not you are lightheaded,\nthat would be the\nstraight falling down,\nor you have vertigo,\nwhich is you're dizzy,\nwhich is that you're going\nto spin and fall down.\nNow do this in a\nsafe place, please.\nYou can do this while bracing\nyourself against a wall,\nor that's why I\nsaid, ideally seated,\nso you don't actually fall.\nBut in most cases, if\nyou're feeling that spin,\nif you're feeling truly\ndizzy, you're feeling vertigo,\nand I move my head\naround like on purpose,\nthen chances are\nyou've got some issue\nin either your visual\nsystem or your inner ear.\nOK.\nSo since this is being\nrecorded on video,\nI can display what\nI'm about to say.\nSo your visual system and your\ninner ear system for balance\nhave some really\nimportant features.\nI'm going to make this\na very quick tutorial.\nYour head, as you\nmove through space,\nis experiencing visual\nimages going by all the time.\nYour retinas, your eyes are\nessentially exposed to a lot\nof what's called visual slip.\nImagine you're\nwalking and you're\ntrying to take a\npicture on your iPhone,\nor if you have an Android\nphone, on your Android phone.\nAnd you're moving, it's\ngoing to be blurry, right?\nWell, there's a stabilization\nprocess in your body and brain.\nIt's a magnificent\none that frankly is\nbuilt into all jawed animals.\nWhereby your head, because\nit can move forward,\nso think nodding, right?\nSo this is pitch for\nyou pilots, right.\nYaw, moving from side to side.\nThis would be the no.\nThis would be the no.\nNo.\nSo pitch, yaw, and roll, which\nwould be like the puppy look,\nright?\nPitch, yaw, and roll.\nPitch, yaw, roll.\nThose are the three major\nangles of visual slip.\nAnd in an absolutely\nmagnificent set of things,\nyour inner ear has three hula\nhoop like shaped structures.\nOne that's arranged\nvertically, so up on its end.\nOne that's at an angle of\nabout 45 degrees to that.\nAnd another that sits like a\nhula hoop flat on the ground.\nAnd inside of each of those\nlittle hula hoop like tubes,\nthere are little stones\ncalled otoliths, OK?\nYou heard that word earlier.\nThat roll around\non the bottom, just\nlike marbles at the\nbottom of a hula hoop.\nSuch that when you\npitch, nod, the marbles\nin the vertical hula hoop\nslide back and forth.\nWhen you say no, the\nmarbles in that hula hoop\nlying essentially parallel\nto the floor move around.\nAnd then the one at 45 degrees,\nwhen you roll your head\nfrom side to side, those move.\nAnd each of those\nsends neural signals\nthat converge on the neural\nsignals coming from the eye.\nAnd get this, when you\nmove through space,\nthere is a precise\noffset of whatever\nvisual slip you happen to\nbe experiencing by walking.\nThe images are moving,\nyou're looking up.\nYou're looking at buildings.\nYou're looking around.\nYou're talking to somebody.\nThey're moving their head.\nAnd your eye is making\nlittle tiny movements,\nlittle microsaccades on\nthe millisecond time scale\nthat act as a perfect\nimage stabilizer.\nSo what this means--\nthis is, by the way, called\nthe vestibulo-ocular reflex.\nVestibular system,\nocular reflex.\nAnd it's mediated through a\nstructure called the cerebellum\nin the back of the brain.\nThis is why when you're on\na boat, when the horizon is\ntipping back and forth, I\nhave to be careful with this\nbecause I have such a\nprominent seasickness based\non a prior experience that if\nI think about this too much,\nI might get nauseous.\nWhen that horizon\nis moving around,\nyour system becomes uncalibrated\nbecause you can't really\nkeep the system jolting\nabout in a regular way.\nTo be really careful\nhere, I'm getting dizzy.\nNotice I said dizzy,\nnot lightheaded.\nAnd you will end up\ndisrupting that slip process,\nand you'll essentially\novercompensate,\nwhich is why whenever you\nfeel sick on a boat, they say,\nlook at the horizon.\nFixate to something\nat a distance.\nOK.\nSo if you have vertigo,\nalmost certainly,\nthere's something going\non in your inner ear.\nYes, it can be\ncaused by viruses.\nYes, it can be\ncaused by hormones.\nThese things tend\nto be transient.\nBut the most important\nthing is going\nto be to anchor the visual part\nof the vestibulo-ocular reflex.\nSo what you're\ngoing to want to do\nis you're going to want\nto fixate on a point\nmaybe three or four feet away.\nAnd then you're going\nto actually want\nto move closer to that point, or\nif you don't have access to it,\nyou would want to look\nat your hand, your finger\nout in front of you,\nand then slowly move it\nin toward your nose.\nAt some point, you'll feel like\nyou're going to go cross-eyed,\nand you can stop at that point.\nThen move out again.\nThen in again.\nWhat are you doing\nwhen you're doing this?\nWhat you're doing is you're\noverriding the error signals,\nthe incorrect error signals that\nexist in your kind of default\nsetting when you have\nvertigo, and you're\nforcing the visual\ncomponent to dominate.\nAnd then your inner ear\nmechanisms will adjust to that.\nSo this is a very powerful tool.\nIf you ever feel\nnauseous or seasick,\nit's a very powerful tool.\nIf you've ever been like me,\nyou sit in the back of an Uber,\nand the Uber is too small.\nYou get out and you're\nlike walk into a building\nwhere there are no windows.\nAnd you're, like I\ndon't really feel good.\nGet outside and look\nat a fixation point\nsome distance away.\nThis actually happened\nthe other day.\nWe went to the gym.\nWe went inside this gym.\nWe'd been in a van\nand then went inside\nand weren't feeling well.\nSo we decided to get out,\nand just take a walk,\nand fixate to the longest\ndistance possible.\nThe fresh air probably\nhelped as well.\nBut when doing that, you are\nanchoring the visual part\nof the vestibulo-ocular reflex.\nNow that's far and\naway better than trying\nto avoid moving\nyour head to not get\nthose little stones\nmoving around\nin the semicircular canals.\nLots to say about this.\nI could go on and on.\nBut hopefully, you\nlearn some biology,\nand you learn to howl to not be\nnauseous if ever you feel dizzy\nor nauseous based on movement.\nMotion sick.\nAnd we can talk about\nwhy you get motion sick,\nbut it's through the vagus\nnerve, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut this is a very useful tool.\nAnd if you're ever\njust not feeling well,\nunless you have a fever\nor something like that,\nI recommend getting\noutside and looking\nat the furthest fixation\npoint with your vision\nthat you possibly can and\nthen walking toward it\nas far as you can safely.\nIf not, by actually just\ndoing a few of these exercises\nof looking at your\nfinger up close,\nthat's going to be very good for\nanchoring the vestibular ocular\nreflex and not every time\nbut many times people\nreport feeling better,\nespecially if you've\nmoved from one\nclosed environment,\nto another closed environment,\nto another closed environment,\nand so on.\nOK.\nNext question is\nwhat can be done\nto improve brain\nfunction for people that\nhave been negatively\nimpacted by things,\nsuch as poor sleep, poor\ndiet, and TBI early in life?\nJames.\nYeah.\nThis is a great question,\nand I get this a lot.\nI think that it reminds me\nthat a lot of the conversation\nthat we have on the podcast\nis about the good things that\nhappen when you do things right\nand the bad things that happen\nwhen you do things wrong.\nAnd while I think that's an\nimportant conversation, what\nI've frankly failed\nto do enough,\nand that's why I'm\ngrateful for this question,\nbecause it gives\nme the opportunity\nto talk more about the fact\nthat your system is very robust.\nThere is neuroplasticity.\nAnd also, as my graduate\nadvisor used to say,\ntime is broken, which is not\nto say you're out of luck.\nBut I wouldn't spend any\nextra energy thinking\nabout how many seats--\nnot seats, excuse me.\nHow many, I have to be\ncareful, the seed oil debate\nis still a debate.\nIt's unclear how\nmany trans fats you\nwere exposed to in childhood.\nWe know trans fats are bad.\nEveryone agrees they're bad.\nGovernments agree they're bad.\nThis is perhaps one\nof the few things\nthat everybody agrees\non in the nutrition\nspace trans fats are bad.\nWhen I was growing up, trans\nfats were abundant in foods.\nThere were probably\nfewer of certain things\nthat we have more\nof now that are bad.\nBut we ate a lot of trans fats.\nWe had margarine in our fridge.\nThere were other things\nthat were probably weren't\ngood for us that we consumed.\nAnd every once in a\nwhile, I'll think,\ngosh, if I'd only been eating\ngrass-fed meats, and fruits,\nand vegetables, and healthy\ngrains as I do now back then,\nimagine how much\nhealthier I'd be.\nBut I really don't spend\ntoo much time on it,\nand I don't think\nyou should either.\nI think the most important\nthing to remember\nis that biological systems,\nunless they're really damaged,\nyou know, you're talking\nabout a major injury,\nand even then,\nthey're very robust.\nYou can overcome years,\ndecades of poor use\nor misuse of those systems.\nThat said, if you\nhave the opportunity\nto take care of them now,\nI highly suggest you do.\nSo for instance, if you\nhaven't slept well for years,\nnow's the time to get it right.\nI wouldn't worry\nabout the past, truly.\nYou can always rescue some\nof your health and healthspan\nand lifespan.\nPoor diet, same thing.\nIt's a just do it kind of thing.\nJust hop on the train of\ngetting things right 80% to 90%\nof the time.\nTBI, traumatic brain injury.\nWell, the episode\nof the Huberman Lab\npodcast that's out right\nnow with Dr. Mark Esposito.\nHe's an MD, a neurologist,\noriginally trained\nat University of Pennsylvania,\nnow at University\nof California Berkeley.\nWe talk about TBI.\nThere are a lot\nof different forms\nof TBI, different origins.\nEverything from bomb\nblasts, to car accident,\nto construction work, to\njust slipped on the stairs\nat a party.\nI know someone that slipped\non some wet floor at a party\nand has a brain injury.\nWhat do we know?\nWell, you get back\nto the basics.\nSleep is going to be important.\nBut there are some things\nlike transcranial magnetic\nstimulation, certainly things\nthat reduce brain inflammation\nlike glymphatic outflow.\nSo glymphatic outflow is this\nwashing of the brain at night\nthat removes debris.\nVery, very important\nin the weeks and months\nafter traumatic brain\ninjury to get adequate sleep\nfor that reason.\nBut then there are things that\nalso seem to perhaps improve\noutcomes from\ntraumatic brain injury,\nsuch as hyperbaric chambers.\nSo hyperoxygenation treatments,\nif you have access to those.\nEven things like elevating\nthe feet slightly\nwhen you sleep by\nabout 5 to 15 degrees\nis known to increase glymphatic\nflow during sleep, which\ncan, we believe by\nway of increased\nclearance of a bunch\nof basically debris,\nreactive oxygen species\nwithin the cells\nbut also debris outside the\ncells in the extracellular\nspace, so between neurons.\nSo it isn't just empty space.\nThere's all this like heavily\nglycosylated stuff, which\nbasically just means this kind\nof like spongy carbohydrate\nstuff that fills in the spaces.\nThe clearance of some\nof the metabolites\nand some of the debris\nthat's accumulated there\nby just sleeping with\nfeet slightly elevated.\nDefinitely not falling\nasleep in a chair upright.\nThat's the worst thing\nfor glymphatic flow.\nThings like that.\nSome people will go kind\nof bonkers on all things\nanti-inflammation.\nThey start taking\ntons of curcumin,\nand they kind of get obsessed\nwith inflammation as the enemy.\nI wouldn't do that.\nIn fact, there are\nsome negative effects\nof things like\ncurcumin, turmeric,\nif you take it in high\ndoses, like limiting\nthe amount of\ndihydrotestosterone production,\nwhich is not good.\nYou don't want that.\nMale or female, you\ndon't want to take\ntoo much turmeric or curcumin.\nThere are real issues with that.\nTo say nothing of the\nstudies that have shown\nlead contamination\nin a lot of turmeric.\nSo you want to\ncheck the sourcing\nvery carefully if you\ndo consume any turmeric.\nA little bit is probably fine.\nCooking with it is fine.\nBut here, we're talking\nabout supplementation.\nAnd just really not trying\nto turn inflammation\ninto this terrible\nthing to the point where\nyou're starting to\ndo other things that\nare potentially damaging.\nThere's some really\ninteresting evidence\nthat 5 grams, maybe 10 grams,\ndepending on your body weight,\nof creatine monohydrate per day\ncan enhance creatine phosphate\nmetabolism in the forebrain\nand enhance brain function\nunder conditions of\nhigh altitude or TBI.\nI take 5 to 10 grams\nof creatine, just\ncreatine monohydrate powder.\nFrankly, any creatine\nmonohydrate powder\nshould be sufficient.\nThere are other\nforms of creatine.\nThey are not any\nbetter creatine.\nMonohydrate is the least\nexpensive fortunately.\nThat mixed in water.\nYou take it with\nor without food.\nSome people ask, does creatine\nmake your hair fall out?\nNo, it does not.\nMake your hair fall\nout, but some people\ndo experience an increase in\nDHT with creatine monohydrate,\nand there can be a\nDHT hair loss link.\nSo if you think you're losing\nyour hair from taking creatine,\nthen stop and see, do\nthe control experiment.\nIt should grow back.\nBut 5 to 10 grams of\ncreatine monohydrate,\nsomething to explore.\nHyperbaric chamber,\nsomething to explore.\nExcellent sleep,\ndefinitely do that.\nAnd I just wouldn't obsess\nover past ills or wrongs\nto the extent that it impacts\nyour ability to try and correct\nthose in the present.\nI would say that\nabout most everything.\nBut then again, I\nunderstand that as humans,\nbecause we can remember\nthe past, the present,\nand the future,\nthat sometimes it's\ndifficult to let go of the\nmistakes of past that we made.\nBut that's just\nsimply being human,\nand I don't have a\nsolution to that.\nAre we any closer to\nfinding the cause of OCD?\nWell, I think we\nknow what causes OCD.\nI think it's pretty clear that\nOCD is some form of miswiring\nin the basal ganglia.\nThe structures of the\nbrain that are involved in\ngo action and no go,\nwithholding, action type\nbehaviors.\nAnd some malwiring\nof those structures\nto the dopamine reward\nsystem because here's\nwhat's interesting about OCD.\nOCD involves\nobsessions obviously.\nThat's the O in OCD.\nCompulsions, the actions.\nThat's the C in OCD.\nBut in a kind of weird\ntwist of the neurology,\nOCD is a situation where\nthe compulsion does not\nremove the obsession.\nRather, it exacerbates it, OK?\nThe compulsion does not\nremove the obsession.\nIt exacerbates it.\nSo unlike an itch that\nyou scratch, with OCD,\nthe scratching of the\nitch makes it worse,\nwhich is actually\nwhat we experience\nwhen we have a mosquito\nbite, which by the way,\nI absolutely loathe\nmosquito bites.\nIt's one of my least\nfavorite things in life.\nI have about 3,600 and\ncounting pet peeves.\nThat's definitely high\non the list of those.\nThe obsessive\ncompulsive disorder\nis one that really needs\nto be treated, frankly,\nneurologically.\nIt's one for which there are\nbehavioral interventions,\nbut it's clear that\nadjusting the pharmacology\nof the neural circuits involved\nin OCD really can help.\nAgain, there are\nbehavioral treatments.\nBut for severe cases of OCD,\nit's just very, very clear\nthat interventions,\nwhich include SSRIs,\nwhich have been demonized.\nA lot of people say, oh,\nselective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors are terrible.\nBlah, blah, blah, blah.\nYou know, the serotonin\nhypothesis of depression\nisn't true.\nWell, listen, the\nreality is this\nthat all treatments for\ndepression that are effective,\nwhich include SSRIs,\nin some cases,\ncognitive behavioral treatments,\nall of these sorts of things,\nwhich are shown efficacy,\nare all about what?\nThey're not about serotonin.\nThey're about neuroplasticity.\nThat's why some\nantidepressants center\non dopamine and norepinephrine.\nOthers center on serotonin.\nThey're about neuroplasticity.\nThey're about changing\nneural networks.\nThey're not about\nneurochemical per se.\nBut the neuromodulators\nsuch as serotonin\nallow an access point.\nThey are a wedge into the\nneuroplasticity process.\nNow with OCD, in order to\novercome these malwirings,\nit's very important\nto get plasticity.\nHow do you get plasticity?\nWell, in my belief, you work\nwith an excellent psychiatrist\nwho can prescribe the\nappropriate dose of drug\nto release the appropriate\namount of neuromodulator.\nThen, and this is\nreally key, you\nhave opened up the\nwindow for plasticity,\nbut then it's really important\nthat the proper behaviors\nare engaged in.\nAnd when I did an\nepisode on OCD,\nI talked about what\nsome of these are.\nFor instance, the\nperson is exposed\nto the stimulus that\ncauses the obsession,\nor maybe the obsession\narises spontaneously.\nThey feel the\nimpulse to complete\nthe compulsion, the\nbehavior, and they\nresist with the\nsupport of a therapist,\nbut they're doing this\nin the context of having\nelevated levels of serotonin\nor some other neuromodulator\nthat then allows fewer\ntrials of resistance.\nFewer times of needing\nto withhold the behavior\nthat this person so badly\nwants to perform because it's\ncoming from within.\nIt's this compulsion literally.\nThen they are able to achieve\nplasticity more quickly.\nPerhaps also transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation.\nSo a conjunction of\ncorrect behavior,\nthe withholding behavior,\nmaybe a replacement behavior\nthat's often used.\nUse a replacement behavior with\nthe appropriate neurochemical\nmilieu is the solution to OCD.\nOK.\nNext question is if I'm just\ngoing to New York City from San\nFrancisco, how do I control\nshifting my circadian\nrhythm by only three hours?\nSo if you're going to New\nYork City from San Francisco,\nthe best way, frankly,\nwould be to get up\nan hour earlier two days before\nyou head off to New York.\nAnd then another day, you might\ntry and shift by two hours\nbefore you go and\nthen head to New York\nand do the last shift\non the last day.\nMost people won't do that.\nIt takes a little bit\nof work, but they just\ndon't have the time ability\nor your discipline to do that.\nBut it is perhaps the best way.\nI would say the best thing to\ndo is to know your temperature\nminimum, and I'll try and\nkeep this pretty simple.\nIf you typically\nwake up at 8:00 AM,\nlet's say, just\nby way of example.\nThat means that your minimum\nbody temperature is at 6:00 AM.\nWhich means that if you want\nto get up earlier in the days\nwhere you travel to New York,\nwell, in the couple of days\nbefore you leave, any time\nbetween 6:00 AM and 10:00 AM,\nget some bright\nlight in your eyes,\neven if you go back to sleep.\nSo for instance,\nget up at 6:00 AM.\nSet an alarm clock.\nI know you normally like\nto get up at 8:00 AM.\nGet up at 6:00 AM.\nGet some bright light in your\neyes from artificial sources\nor from sunlight,\nmaybe 5 to 10 minutes,\nthen go back to\nsleep until 8:00 AM.\nYou do that again\nthe next night.\nAnd then you head\noff to New York.\nYou'll find the shift\nto be much easier.\nNow here's what you\ndon't want to do.\nYou want to make sure\nthat you do not view\nbright light before 6:00 AM.\nSo in the middle of the\nnight, if you get up,\nyou need to use\nthe restroom, try\nand use dim lights as dim is\nas safely possible, et cetera.\nAnd what are you doing\nwhen you're doing this?\nI could get into\na long description\nof the science behind this,\nand I'll probably do a podcast\nall about this at some point.\nBut really what you're doing\nif you get up at 6:00 AM\nand getting some bright light\nexposure is you think about it,\nyou're kind of looking at a\nNew York sunrise of sorts, OK?\nIf it's not a sunrise,\nyou're getting\nsome bright light\nthat mimics sunrise\nat least to some extent.\nNothing's quite like\nsunrise, but to some extent.\nSo in that sense, even\nif you go back to sleep,\nwhat you're doing is you're\nsending the light signal,\nthe zeitgeber, the time\nsignal, to your circadian clock\nof your hypothalamus\nthat it should shift,\nthat you need to get up earlier.\nAnd indeed, that will\nhappen over the course\nof about two to three days.\nThe other thing you\ncan do, and I know this\nis kind of rare these days\nto get an answer like this.\nThe other thing you can\ndo is just fly to New York\nand force yourself to get up.\nAnd just drink caffeine, and\nget out, and exercise and use\nthe social rhythm of the\nactivity of the city in order\nto get up earlier.\nBut you will feel\nlousy late morning.\nAnd so you would only want to\ndo that if you could access\na brief nap of anywhere from\n30 to 90 minutes late morning,\nand then you'll feel fine.\nBut my suggestion\nwould be to, something\nback there like some\nanimal or something\nlikes that answer so much.\nIt would be to just try and get\na little bit of light exposure\na couple hours before\nyour normal wake up time.\nThen go back to\nsleep in the two days\nbefore you head off\nto New York City.\nAnd of course,\neverything here was\nset in the context of\nthe New York City, flight\nfrom San Francisco\nand New York City.\nBut the principle,\nthe logic holds.\nAnd if you have any questions\nabout this temperature minimum\nand wake up time, and you want\nto get your circadian clock\nright for travel,\ncheck out the episode\nthat we did on jet\nlag and shift work.\nAnd I'm realizing now as I\nsay this, and my team is here,\nand they're listening, that I\nwill do a video on the Huberman\nLab clips channel where I\nexplain temperature minimum\nand how to plug in\nyour normal wake\nup time in order to\nessentially arrive at whatever\ntime shift you want.\nWe should probably put that\nout as a newsletter too,\nwhere it's a little chart, where\nit says I currently wake up\nat 8:00 AM, and\nthen which means my,\nand then it'll say\nsubtract two hours.\nMy temperature\nminimum is 6:00 AM.\nAnd I want to travel\nto whatever it is.\nI don't know.\nSydney, Australia on\nthis date from this city.\nAnd then we know\nthe time change.\nAnd then I can tell\nyou exactly what\nto do for a couple of days.\nI've done this for\nvarious military groups.\nI've done this for people and\nclose friends who travel a lot,\nand it works fabulously well.\nI can't eliminate\njet lag for you.\nI wish I could just\neliminate jet lag.\nI can't do that.\nBut I definitely\ncan have the time\nthat it takes for you\nto shift maybe more.\nHi.\nHi.\nI love the Sydney Show.\nThank you.\nThanks for coming out.\nThanks for coming to Australia.\nThanks for having us.\nI take fish oil,\nbut I'm not sure I'm\ngetting the dose right.\nWhat are your thoughts\non fish oil and dose?\nI have lots of\nthoughts on fish oil.\nI think it's a terrific tool.\nI think every time I see\na study or a news article\nsaying fish oil not shown to--\nI just go, oh, gosh.\nAll right.\nWell, listen, whoever's\nreading, wrote that article,\nI take no pleasure in\nyour declining health span\nor lifespan, but whatsoever.\nBut the rest of us are\ngoing to be taking fish oil.\nAnd here's why.\nThere's just, oh, so\nmuch evidence that\ngetting enough\nomega 3 fatty acids\nis great for brain\nhealth, body health.\nAnd I think that the\nissue around fish oil\nis typically around\ncontaminants.\nSo you want to make sure that it\ndoesn't have loads of mercury.\nSo things like sardines,\ncod liver oil, et cetera.\nYou can get those\nfrom natural sources,\nexcept there's one problem.\nI hate sardines, and I\ndon't want to slurp down\na bunch of cod fat.\nI'm just not interested in that.\nSo if you eat a lot of\nfatty ocean fish and it's\nreally clean fish, great.\nI don't.\nMost people don't.\nSo I believe in taking\na high quality fish oil.\nThere are a lot of\ndifferent sources of these.\nIn fact, in the episode that\nwe did with Dr. Rhonda Patrick,\nthere's a link in the\nshow note captions\nI believe that takes you to a\nchart of the different fish oil\nsources and their relative\nlevels of contaminants,\net cetera.\nBut most of the reputable\nbrands out there\nare not going to have any\ncontaminants because they've\nbeen cleaned out.\nIt's been checked for.\nSo I take the fish oil\nfrom G1 or from Momentous.\nThat's just me.\nThere are a lot of other\ngreat sources out there.\nBut I will say this.\nThat's when I'm traveling,\nand I take capsules.\nTypically, I like to\ntake it in liquid form,\nand I will take\nit in liquid form.\nI have no financial relationship\nto the liquid non-capsule forms\nof fish oil, and I get the\none that has a lemon flavor\nto overcome the absolutely\ndisgusting flavor of Cod liver\noil.\nI guess, I don't\nknow, presumably cod,\nlike the taste of cod liver oil.\nBut I don't.\nSo that's what I do.\nI'll take a tablespoon of that\nonce a day and a protein shake.\nIt tastes like lemon.\nIt doesn't taste like\ncod, thank goodness.\nAnd when I travel, I take\nthe capsules from AG1,\nor Momentous, or there\nare excellent ones\nfrom other sources.\nLots of great sources out there.\nNow what are we trying to\ndo when we take fish oil?\nYes, it can reduce inflammation.\nYes, it can do a number\nof different things.\nBut that's all by way of omega\n3 fatty acid intake, right?\nMost people get far too\nmuch omega 6, right?\nThis is why there's\na seed oil debate.\nWe're not going to\nhave that debate now.\nWe'd put us all\nto sleep frankly.\nThe key thing is to\nget enough omega 3s,\nand they're hard to get\nunless you're eating krill.\nSo unless you're a\nlarge baleen whale,\nyou're probably not\neating that much krill.\nIf you're getting\nfatty fish, great.\nBut when you take\nan omega 3 fatty\nacid in the form\nof fish oil or you\neat sardines for that matter,\nwhat you're getting essentially\nis the substrate for a lot\nof other important building\nblocks, not the least of\nwhich is the lipid bilayer\nthat surrounds the\nneurons of your brain.\nAnd so basically, the\nomega 3 fatty acids\nprovide the substrate\nfor some key building\nblocks of nerve cells and other\ncells in the brain and body.\nAnd, this is perhaps the\nmost important reason\nI can think of, when you get\nout past 1 gram of the EPA\nform of omega 3, OK, 1 gram of\nEPA form of omega 3 per day,\nit's clear there's\neither mild to moderate\nantidepressant effect, so much\nso that one can, in some cases,\ntalk to your psychiatrist\nor psychologist, partially\noffset the dosage of\nany antidepressant.\nI am not telling you to go\noff antidepressant medication\nand go on to fish oil.\nThat is not what I'm saying.\nI'm just saying that there's\nsome impressive clinical trials\nshowing that fish oil,\nif taken at dosages\nof 1 to 3 grams of EPA per day,\ncan have a mild to moderate\nantidepressant effect.\nAnd I don't know\nanyone that wouldn't\nwant to have better mood.\nSo I take 1.5 grams\nof EPA, which is not\nto say 1.5 grams of fish oil.\nYou need to look at the\npackage and see how much\nfish oil but then\nlook at how much EPA.\nAnd typically, it's less\nthan 1 gram per serving.\nSo you may have to\ntake two servings.\nSome people say, well, is it\nsafe to take two servings?\nI don't see any reason why not.\nAnd then of course, there\nare the high potency fish\noils for which there is\ncertainly 1 gram or more\nof EPA.\nKeep in mind that all this\ndiscussion about fish oil\nmight sound kind of\nhealth food hippie store.\nForgive me, hippies.\nHealth food store kind of stuff.\nBut the reality is that\nEPA, high concentration\nEPA is actually a prescription\ndrug in the United States\nand elsewhere, prescribed often\nfor enhancing mental health,\nenhancing cardiovascular\nhealth, and on and on.\nSo we're not out\non a limb or out\non a fin as it were when\nwe're having this discussion.\nWe're actually just\ntalking about something\nfor which there's a lot\nof clinical evidence.\nThere's a lot of\nbiochemical evidence.\nThere's a lot of mechanisms.\nSo I take anywhere from one\nto 2 grams of EPA per day,\neven if that requires taking six\nrather than the suggested three\ncapsules per day or taking\na full tablespoon or even\ntwo tablespoons of fish oil.\nAnd frankly, most people\nare getting too much omega\n6 fatty acids and\nnot enough omega 3.\nSo shout-out to the fish oils.\nWhat is the recommended protocol\nfor measuring hormone levels?\nInteresting.\nHow frequently do\nyou advise monitoring\nthese levels to accurately\ndetermine their typical range?\nAnd I just have to try\nand pronounce your name.\nVallad Resnichenko.\nWhat a cool name.\nVallad Resnichenko.\nI'm a big fan of like\ntwo-syllable first name.\nAll right.\nSo Vallad Resnichenko,\nthank you for this question\nand the opportunity to try\nand pronounce your name.\nSo hormone levels.\nI think a good thing to\ndo is, in the absence\nof any apparent or suspected\nendocrine dysfunction, right?\nSo we're talking about\nyou feel pretty good.\nYou're wondering if\nyou're good under--\nif I say good under the hood,\nthat just sounds like weird.\nIt rhymes.\nSo if you're\nfeeling pretty good,\nI recommend getting your hormone\nlevels checked once if you can,\nif you're still in your\nteens, in your late teens,\nafter you've gone through\npuberty to establish\na sort of baseline.\nMost people won't do that\nbecause it's too late.\nI didn't do that.\nOnce in your mid-20s.\nAgain, we're talking about no\nsuspected or apparent endocrine\ndysfunction in your mid-20s.\nYou have a baseline.\nSomething to compare to when\nyou were in your say 18 to 20\nand again, when you're 25.\nThat would be ideal.\nAnd then again, I would\nsay when you're 30.\nAnd then start once\na year starting\nwhen you are 40 or older.\nI think that just\nlogically, I would\nlove to know what my\nhormone levels were\nwhen I was 25, when I was 30.\nMaybe when I was, yeah,\nwhen I was 18, 25, 30, 35.\nAnd actually, 35 is when I got\nmy first blood draw for just\ngetting a look under the hood.\nLike what's there?\nWhat are my estrogen levels?\nWhat are my testosterone levels?\nWhat are my growth\nhormone levels?\nThis kind of thing.\nAnd then once\nyou're 40 and older,\nI think once a year minimum.\nAnd I realize that\nsome people out there\nare going to say, well,\nthat's ridiculous.\nWhat are you going to do\nwith that information?\nWell, you're going to do a\nlot with that information.\nYou're going to figure\nout whether or not\nyour LDL cholesterol\nis in healthy range.\nYou're going to figure out\nwhether or not your ALT is\nin the healthy range.\nYou're going to figure\nout whether or not\nyour ApoB is in healthy range.\nYou're going to figure out a lot\nmore than just whether or not\nyour testosterone is\n400, 600, 800, or 1,200.\nAnd I think we also need to be\ncareful about overinterpreting\nresults of hormones\nbecause a lot of it\nhas to do with the\nratio of testosterone\nto estrogen or the ratio of free\ntestosterone to testosterone,\nboth in men and women.\nSo for instance, if your\ntestosterone level is 900\nbut your free\ntestosterone level is 2,\nwell, then you have a problem.\nWhereas if your\ntotal testosterone\nlevel is 500 or 600 but your\nfree testosterone level is 15,\nwell, then you're probably\ndoing pretty well.\nSo I would say getting\nyour hormone levels checked\nonce a year after age\n40, and prior to that,\nonce every three to five\nyears starting at about age 18\nwould be ideal.\nBut most people don't do that.\nThey either don't have\nthe disposable income.\nI certainly didn't\nwhen I was 18, 20, 25.\nAnd at that time, it\nwas really hard to get\nthat measured unless you\nhad a clinical problem.\nNow if anyone has a clinical\nproblem that they suspect\nor is real, then\nobviously more testing.\nI think great sources\nfor endocrine profiling\nare things like InsideTracker.\nFull disclosure, they are\na sponsor of the podcast,\nbut they do an excellent job.\nThey'll even come to your house.\nThe phlebotomist will come\nto your house if you want,\nor you can go to a clinic, so\nthey make it all very easy.\nBut there are other\nsources as well, right?\nI'll never make these AMAs\nor anything else about\nspecific companies\nfor its own sake.\nI just think InsideTracker\ndoes a great job.\nThere are a number of clinics\nlike Marek Health and others,\nonline clinics\nthat will do that,\nbut it's part of a more\ncomprehensive package\nof agreeing to work with them.\nAt least that's how\nI understand it.\nI hope I didn't get that wrong.\nBut check and see.\nNowadays, it's pretty\neasy to find ways\nto get your hormones checked.\nBut I would suggest that the\nfollowing things at least\nbe on there.\nGrowth hormone or IGF-1 rather.\nIGF-1, testosterone, estrogen.\nThis is true for women and men\nby the way.\nSo IGF-1, testosterone,\nestrogen. It'll\nshow up as estradiol on there.\nFree testosterone,\ndihydrotestosterone, cortisol.\nKeep in mind, morning\ncortisol is always\nelevated relative to\nafternoon cortisol.\nIt will be impacted by food.\nSo you want to go in\nfasted in the morning,\nideally get this done early.\nYour creatinine levels,\nwhich by the way, will be\nelevated if you're\ntaking creatine\nor you're exercising hard.\nYour doctor will say your\ncreatinine levels are elevated.\nAnd you say, well, great.\nWell, my creatine\nintake is elevated too.\nSo take that.\nIt's not going to be\na problem necessarily.\nDo check with your doctor.\nLDL cholesterol, ApoB.\nAnd there are probably\na few others that\nwould be good to have in there.\nFor men and women, sex hormone\nbinding globulin, SHBG.\nAnd for women especially,\nprogesterone and prolactin,\nand any of the progestins\nare going to be important.\nAnd of course, for\nwomen, the trick\nis going to be when you\nget your blood taken\nwith respect to your hormone\ncycle, your ovulatory cycle,\nand to try to make that at least\nconsistent from test to test,\nnot necessarily having to go\nin both during the follicular\nand the luteal\nphase of your cycle,\nbut always going in during\nmid-follicular or mid-luteal,\nand that can be\nchallenging to do perhaps.\nBut that's going to be important\nbecause of course, those\nare widely fluctuating\nlevels across the cycle.\nBut unless you're really\nobsessed with your hormone\nlevels, and analyzing\nthem, taking them\nat multiple times throughout\nyour menstrual cycle,\nprobably not necessarily\nunless you're\nstarting to think\nabout conceiving,\nor there's some issue,\nPCOS or other issue.\nOK.\nI find that I need to do\nNSDR after working out.\nAny thoughts on this?\nYes.\nWell, first of all, I'm\nglad you're using NSDR,\nzero cost tool, known to\nreplenish mental and physical\nvigor, works oh so well.\nI think it's great.\nI think it probably is\naccelerating your recovery.\nI think this tells me\nthat you're probably\nworking out really hard\nand hopefully not too long.\nIf you find that you\nwork out in the morning\nand then you're\nreally, really sleepy\nin the afternoon\nand the next day,\nyou might be working out\ntoo long or too hard.\nSo maybe ratchet back the\nintensity a little bit\nor the duration.\nIt's amazing how\ngreat we can feel\nwhen we work out to 80% to\n90% of our maximum output\nand duration.\nAnd we did this the other day.\nWe went out for a little\njog, run, bounding,\nskipping, jumping jack thing,\nand stopped at like 80% to 90%\nof maximum and went\nabout the rest of the day\nand evening feeling great.\nIf you do this\nconsistently, you'll\nfind you have more energy.\nAnd there's actually a lot of\nsolid physiology and physics\nto support why that is.\nAs opposed to if you go to\nthe gym and you do every set\nto failure, or even\nevery exercise,\nyou include one set to failure,\nand you're grinding out four\nstraps, or you're--\nI don't know what kind\nof exercise you're doing.\nOr you're running more\nand more distance each day\nor with more intensity.\nIt's understandable how\none gets kind of drawn to\nor addicted to that\nburn or the effort.\nBut keep in mind,\nthat is stress.\nYou're stressing\nthe body to produce\na certain kind of\nadaptation, either endurance,\nor strength, or hypertrophy,\nor et cetera adaptation.\nSo there's real\nbeauty in learning\nto love working out hard\nbut to leaving the gym\nor ending the run with 10% to\n20% of the gas in the tank.\nAnd knowing that you can\ncome back and do more,\nand you actually\nwant to do more.\nIt increases vigor, as\nopposed to taking yourself\nover that cliff even\na slight 10% to 20%\nand then finding that\nyou're kind of depleted.\nAnd this is something that\nwe don't hear enough about\nbecause most people\nthat are into fitness\nare into pushing themselves.\nIt's also true for work.\nI think some of the\nbest advice I ever\ngot in the\nprofessional landscape\nwas when I was a graduate\nstudent at UC Berkeley.\nAnd an excellent neurologist\nby the name of Bob Knight\nsaid the key is to figure\nout how much can you\nwork each day consistently?\nIf that's four\nhours a day, fine.\nIf that's eight\nhours a day, fine.\nWe're talking with\nweekend breaks\nbecause that was in the\nera of weekend breaks.\nMaybe a weekend\nevery once in a while\nwhere you have a deadline.\nBut by thinking about what\nyou personally can really\ndo consistently\nwhile maintaining\nsleep, and mental health,\nand physical health,\nyou're going to go a lot\nfurther than doing like,\nfor instance, what I\ndid, which was maniac\nand working 100 hour weeks\nas a graduate student\nand then ending up\nsick four times a year\nand missing out\non a bunch of days\nwhen I could have been in lab.\nSo these days, I try and\nget as much focused work\ndone as possible\nbut try and make\nthat as consistent as\npossible, if not from every day\nto the next, over time.\nFigure out what those averages\nare, and don't be ashamed\nof those averages.\nI would say declare\nthose averages to people,\nso they know what to expect.\nAnd the fact that\nyou can do more\ndoes not necessarily\nmean that you\nshould do more because\nI think one of the best\npieces of advice I ever\ngot in the world of fitness\nis more important than training\nhard, more important than doing\nany particular\nexercise, more important\nthan anything is\nto not get hurt.\nBecause if you get\nhurt, you can't train.\nSo I love that you're\ndoing NSDR after training.\nI love that you're making\nthat part of your practice.\nBut maybe also throttle\nback a little bit\nbecause you said I have\nto do it after training.\nMaybe throttle back a little\nbit on the duration or intensity\nof exercise and\nsee how you feel.\nWhat can we do to\noptimize the functioning\nof our gut-brain axis?\nThat's very simple.\nGet enough sleep.\nIn addition to that,\navoid excessive intake\nof antibiotics.\nBut if your doctor\nprescribes them, take them.\nI am a believer in\nantibiotics, OK?\nBefore the internet jumps on\nme, I'm not anti-antibiotic.\nI always want to say.\nThat I'm not anti-antibiotic.\nI am not pro-antibiotic,\nbut I am pro-probiotics.\nI'm probiotic.\nSo I think you should ingest one\nto four servings of low sugar\nfermented foods per day.\nSo sauerkraut, kimchi,\nnatto, or kefir,\nor otherwise, whatever you like\nand fits with your nutrition\npreferences and plan.\nI think it's also very\nimportant that you\ndon't overuse antiseptics,\nlike antiseptic mouthwashes,\nand hand rinses,\nand all that stuff.\nThis was all discussed\non a podcast episode\nI did with Dr. Justin\nSonnenburg on the Huberman Lab\npodcast, which is just\nto say that Justin, who's\na professor at Stanford\nand is amazing,\neven said that he lets his kids\neat lunch when they've been\nplaying outside without washing\ntheir hands before eating lunch\nbecause he wants the\nprobiotic makeup of their gut\nto be diverse,\nincluding from outside.\nNow I'm presuming that's\nnot a public park.\nI'm assuming it's their yard.\nSo we're not talking about gross\nstuff being on their hands.\nWe're talking about a\nlittle dirt here and there.\nIt turns out owning a pet\nincreases the diversity\nof your microbiome.\nLots of things like that.\nYou don't want to go around\nlicking people's pets.\nIt's OK to let them lick you.\nAnd depending on\nwhat your preferences\nare, but don't lick them.\nBut when you\ninteract with people,\nyou shake their\nhands or pets, you're\nincreasing the diversity\nof your microbiome.\nWhen you eat low\nsugar fermented foods,\nyou want to make\nsure also you get\nenough fiber, both prebiotic\nand probiotic fiber.\nSo fruits and vegetables.\nThe fiber debate for me\njust makes me roll my eyes.\nI mean, it's so clear\nthat fiber is good for us,\nfor gut motility and for\noffsetting cancers of the gut.\nI mean, I realize there are\nthe people out there who\nare really into\nelimination diets\nwhere they just only eat meat.\nBut I mean, there's just so much\ngood data on fiber, especially\nfrom fibrous vegetables.\nIt just seems like what, yes.\nI mean, it's almost silly that\nwe have the debate frankly.\nBut I'm sure someone out\nthere who's pure carnivore\nwill be shouting.\nBut guess what?\nYou're shouting and\nyou're constipated.\nLast question.\nRegarding the subject on tongue\ncleaning from the oral health\nepisode, can you\nplease share a bit\non brushing tongue,\nscraping tongue,\nand generally how best\nto clean the tongue?\nSo tongue cleaning came up\non the oral health episode.\nI talked to four different\ndentists and a periodontist\nin preparation for that episode.\nAlmost all of them,\nremarkably, extraordinarily\nconverged on the\nsame advice except\nfor some slight deviations\naround frequency of flossing.\nIt's kind of cool, right?\nA field where almost\neverybody seems to agree.\nI realize that it isn't\nthe hugest sample size,\nbut I picked them from diverse\nlocations, backgrounds,\ntrainings, et cetera.\nEvery one of them said\nbrush and floss your teeth.\nEvery one of them said\nantiseptic, alcohol-based\nmouthwashes are bad.\nAnd every single\none of them said\nthat brushing your\nteeth before sleep\nis especially important\nbecause at night, you\nproduce less\nsaliva, and you want\nto be able to remineralize\nyour teeth, that\nis fill in cavities that\nare starting to form brush.\nSo brush your teeth, floss\nideally as well before sleep,\nbut at least brush.\nAnd of course, in the morning\ntoo, for everyone's sake.\nBut if we're talking about\ntongue brushing and scraping,\nit was clear that\ntongue scraping was\nadvised if done correctly, OK?\nBecause there are\ncertain bacteria\nthat grow on the tongue\nthat you don't want there.\nAnd that scraping can\nhelp with the turnover\nof healthy bacteria there\nin addition to removing\nsome of the bad bacteria.\nBut that most people scrape\ntheir tongue too hard.\nAnd rather, it would be wise\nto brush your tongue gently\nwith a soft toothbrush.\nAnd by the way, you should also\nuse a soft brush for your teeth\nbut not the same one that\nyou use for tongue brushing.\nSo the takeaway that\nI was told, and it\nmakes a lot of sense to me\nbased on what I know now\nabout the biology, physiology,\nand care of the mouth\nis that you want to use a\ndifferent soft toothbrush\nto brush your tongue\nthan the soft brush\nthat you use to brush your\nteeth and that you do not\nneed to use anything on it.\nBut if you wanted to put a\nlittle bit of salt and baking\nsoda, that is perfectly fine.\nA lot of people\nwonder whether or not\nbaking soda scrapes the\nenamel off the teeth.\nIt actually is low on\nthe abrasion scale.\nDentists have,\nbelieve it or not,\nan abrasion scale\nwith a list of things\nof how much enamel it scrapes\noff at a given pressure.\nThese dentists have\ndone their work.\nIt's really, really cool.\nI can't say I always\nliked dentists.\nI didn't like going\nto the dentist.\nThey always seem\nlike nice people.\nBut now I have newfound\nrespect for dentists.\nThey really care\nabout their craft,\nand oral health has\nbeen kind of pushed\nto the back seat of the\ndifferent aspects of health.\nI consider it one\nof the major pillars\nof mental health\nand physical health\nbecause taking care of your\nteeth, your gums, your mouth,\nincluding your\noral microbiome is\ncritical for\ncardiovascular health.\nIt's critical for brain health.\nOne of the bad bacteria,\nStreptococcus mutans,\nthat can proliferate\nin the mouth,\nespecially after\neating sugary foods,\ncan make it through the\nblood-brain barrier.\nAnd maybe, it's thought one\nof the causes of dementia,\ncan disrupt your neurons.\nYour brain and body is a system.\nEverything is talking\nto everything else.\nAnd so yeah, brush your tongue\nbut use a separate soft brush\nto do that and replace it\nevery few weeks to months.\nI suppose get\nexpensive but probably\nnot as expensive as\nsome of the other health\nissues that were just described.\nSo I appreciate that question.\nWe didn't talk about oil\npulling on the podcast.\nA lot of people\nasked about that.\nSome people like to swish oil\nand then spit it out as a way.\nThat's oil pulling\nfor oral health.\nAll the dentists I spoke\nto said nah, not big fans\nof oil pulling.\nBut none of them said it\nwould be particularly bad.\nSo if you enjoy it or you\nthink it works for you, great.\nBut none of them really\npointed to any clear evidence\nthat it was going\nto be beneficial.\nSo I was told that\nwas the last question,\nand we are coming\nup on the hour.\nAgain, I want to thank\neverybody for joining this AMA.\nI'm doing this from Australia.\nSydney, Australia.\nWhat's interesting\ndown here is because we\nare below the equator,\neverything is reversed, right?\nSo this was actually--\nit's being presented to you.\nI'm actually upside down,\nbut they turned the camera,\nso I would appear\nright side up to you.\nAlso, when I'm down\nhere, I drink my AG1.\nNormally, I swish\nit counterclockwise,\nbut I notice here, reflexively,\nI'm swishing it clockwise.\nSo anyway, lots of\ninteresting stuff going on.\nWe'll talk about\nhow that all works.\nIt's not through\nthe vestibulo-ocular\nreflex it turns out but maybe on\na future episode of the podcast\nabout the relationship\nbetween location\nrelative to the equator\nand neural functioning.\nAnd I'm just kidding.\nBut what I'm not\nkidding about is\nI appreciate that you tuned in.\nAnd last but\ncertainly not least,\nthank you for your\ninterest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
