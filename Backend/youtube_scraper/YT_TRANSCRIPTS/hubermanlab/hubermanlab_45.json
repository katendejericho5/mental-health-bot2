    "video_title": "Dr. Mark D'Esposito: How to Optimize Cognitive Function & Brain Health",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr and\nProfessor Mark\ndespasito Dr Mark despasito is a\nneurologist and a professor of\nneuroscience and psychology at the\nUniversity of California Berkeley he is\na world expert in the brain mechanisms\ncontrolling executive function and\nmemory executive function is the way in\nwhich we are able to designate and carry\nout specific cognitive strategies and it\nis fundamental to every aspect of our\ndaily lives and because so much of being\neffective in daily life involves using\nspecific context relevant batches of\ninformation in order to understand what\nto do and when and what not to do and\nwhen and to come up with strategies that\nare very adaptive for us to move forward\nin the context of relationships work\nschool and Athletics and on and on\nthere's really no separation between\nexecutive function and memory and today\nDr desposito explains the neural\ncircuits controlling executive function\nand memory how they interact the key\nrole of dopamine in executive function\nand something called working memory and\nteaches us ways to optimize executive\nfunction and memory that is how to\noptimize cognitive function in addition\nto discussing how to optimize cognitive\nfunction in the healthy brain today's\ndiscussion also centers around how to\nrestore cognitive function in disease or\ninjury conditions that deplete executive\nfunction in memory such as traumatic\nbrain injury concussion Alzheimer's\nParkinson's and attention deficit\ndisorders Dr desposito shares with us\nresearch findings both about behavioral\nand pharmacologic strategies to enhance\nexecutive function and memory by the end\nof today's discussion you will have\nlearned from Dr despasito a tremendous\namount about the modern understanding of\ncognition that is thinking and memory\nand the carrying out of specific\ncognitive strategies you will also learn\na tremendous amount about how to\noptimize brain function and brain health\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is Maui Nei venison\nMaui Nei venison is the most new\nnutrient-dense and delicious red meat\navailable I've spoken before on this\npodcast and there's General consensus\nthat most people should strive to\nconsume approximately one gram of\nprotein per pound of body weight now\nwhen one strives to do that it's\nimportant to maximize the quality of\nthat protein intake to the calorie ratio\nbecause you don't want to consume an\nexcess of calories when trying to get\nthat one gram of protein per pound of\nbody weight mauii venison has an\nextremely high quality protein to\ncalorie ratio so it makes getting that 1\ngram of of protein per pound of body\nweight extremely easy it's also\ndelicious personally I like the ground\nvenison I also like the venison steaks\nand then for convenience when I'm on the\nroad I like the jerky the jerky is a\nvery high protein to calorie ratio so it\nhas as much as 10 grams of protein per\njerky stick and it has something like\nonly like 55 calories so again making it\nvery easy to get enough protein without\nconsuming excess calories if you would\nlike to try Maui Nei venison you can go\nto mauii venison

if there's one thing I've\nconsistently emphasized on this podcast\nis the incredible role that light can\nhave on our biology and of course I'm\nalways telling people that they should\nget sunlight in their eyes as soon as\npossible after waking on as many days of\ntheir life as possible for sake of\nsetting circadian rhythm daytime mood\nfocus and alertness and improv sleep\nnow in addition to sunlight red light\nand nearin red light has been shown to\nhave positive effects on improving\nnumerous aspects of Cellar and organ\nHealth including faster Muscle Recovery\nimproved skin health and wound healing\neven improvements in acne or that is\nremoval of acne reducing pain and\ninflammation improving mitochondrial\nfunction and even improving Vision\nitself what sets juv aart and why it's\nmy preferred red light therapy device is\nthat it has clinically proven\nwavelengths meaning meaning it uses\nspecific wavelengths of red light and\nnear infed light in combination that\ntrigger the optimal seller adaptations\npersonally I use the handheld ju every\nday the handheld ju is about the size of\na thick piece of toast and I also own a\nju panel that allows for full body\nexposure and I use that one\napproximately five times per week for\nabout 10 to 15 minutes per session if\nyou would like to try ju you can go to\nj.com huberman to receive $50 off your\nfirst purchase again

capacity I've\nspoken many times before in this podcast\nabout the fact that sleep is the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance now a key\ncomponent of getting a great night's\nsleep is that in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep your body temperature\nactually has to drop by about 1 to 3°\nand in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3° one of the best ways to\nmake sure that those temperature changes\noccur at the appropriate times at the\nbeginning and throughout and at the end\nof your night when you wake up is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's what eight sleep\nallows you to do it allows you to\nprogram the temperature of your mattress\nand sleeping environment such that you\nfall and stay deeply asleep easily and\nwake up each morning feeling incredibly\nrefreshed and energized I've been\nsleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress\ncover for almost 3 years now and it has\ndramatically improved the quality of my\nsleep if you'd like to try eight sleep\nyou can go to eights sleep.com huberman\nto get $150 off their pod

desposito welcome\nhi Andrew thank you so much for inviting\nme I'm really looking forward to\nconversation yeah you may not remember\nme but I remember you when I was a first\nyear graduate student and uh you showed\nup at Berkeley one of the first people\nto really bring functional Imaging of\nthe human brain to Berkeley bring a\nneurology and a clinical\num emphasis to the Neuroscience studies\nthere and it's really just um blossomed\nand it's been a real thrill for me to\nsee all the Magnificent work out of your\nlaboratory over the years and I know you\nalso still see patients so the topics\nthat are of interest to you I know are\nof great interest to our audience maybe\nwe'll just start off with a few of the\nbasics and um do a little functional\nneuroanatomy lesson for folks not to\nscare anyone don't worry this will be\naccessible to everyone and just talk\nabout the frontal lobes and prefrontal\ncortex and a little bit of what those\nstructures do because many times on this\npodcast I've said okay the neural real\nestate right behind your forehead is\ninvolved in context and planning Etc but\nyou're the real expert here um how\nshould we think about what the frontal\nloes do and and they're very roles in\nhealth and disease yeah so there's four\nloes there's a frontal loes parietal\ntemporal occipital and the frontal loes\nprobably take up more do take up more\nterritory than the other Lo probably\nabout a third of of the uh cortex and\nwithin the frontal loes uh I I don't I'm\ngoing to use sort of frontal loes\nprobably in our conversation a lot but\nwhat I really mean is the prefrontal\ncortex So within the frontal loes\nthere's also Mo areas that important for\nmotor function as well um but when we're\ntalking about the frontal loes and\ntalking about it you know involved in\nhigher level cognitiv abilties we real\ntalking about the prefrontal cortex and\nthis is what's considered sort of the\nhighest level of Cortex in the brain and\nso yeah when you think when you think\nabout it people assign it all sorts of\nfunctions almost every function you\nthink of people sort of put into the\nfrontal lows but I think what we've all\nkind of uh moved towards is this idea of\nexecutive function this abil this\nability to to plan to\norganize uh to really transfer our\nthought thoughts you know into an action\nand really to be guided by goals and and\nintentions and not be kind of take you\nknow kind of ruled by sort of just\nautomatic behaviors and a word we use in\ncob ner science is called cognitive\ncontrol so C control executive function\nis what we attribute to the frontal L\nand so you can think of it as you know\nthe CEO of the brain or the U you know\nor the conductor of the orchestra really\nthe part of the brain that's that's\nreally controlling the the the rest of\nthe the brain so yeah if you had to\nchoose which part you wanted to not\nleave home it's your front it's your\nfrontal opes speaking of which um what\nare some of the uh symptoms of mild\nfrontal lobe damage um and severe\nfrontal lobe damage a damage brought\nabout either through uh neurod\ndegenerative disease or physical injury\nI know we're going to talk a bit about\nboth today or a lot about both um but\nhow would lack of executive function uh\nshow up um and maybe on in kind of a\nsubtle level yeah I mean at first I\nshould say is that it it shows up all\nthe time because when when uh and and\nfrontal lobe behavior is probably much\nmore prevalent than than we realize\ncertainly we think about it when you\nhave a brain injury to the frontal loes\nand there's lots of neurological\ndisorders like stroke and traumatic\nbrain injury and Alzheimer's disease\nthat can affect the frontal lobe and\nthere's a number of you know psychiatric\ndisorders obsessive compulsive disorder\nand schizophrenia and depression that\nare thought to be frontal l D function\nbut when you're sleep deprived and when\nyou're stressed and just normal aging\nthe frontal lobe seems to be the first\nsystem that's affected because it really\nis involved in the highest level so when\nwe're having a bad day when we're having\ndifficulty sort of setting priorities\nwhen we're having difficulties achieving\nthe goal that we've set out when we get\ndistract you know when we get distracted\num you know when we're not able to sort\nof adapt and be flexible these are all\nthe type of things that are reflect that\nour frontal loes are not functioning\noptimally approximately what age does\nthe frontal lobe\ncircuitry uh come online so to speak I\nmean when I see a baby uh babies can\nOrient their eyes towards things but\nthey're rather reflexive in and where\nthey'll Place their eyes but um by time\nkids are three or four they can\ncertainly you know play with blocks or\ninteract with other children or their\nparents but it seems that you know full\nfunctionality the frontal loes is it's\nreally gradual at least that's my\nnon-clinically trained assessment yeah\nyeah I mean it's a really tough question\nto know when they're fully develop\nbecause these studies haven't been done\nwhen MRI was introduced and we were able\nto sort of image the brain in a\nnon-invasive way uh then studies did\nstart to come out trying to sort of map\nout at what age does your frontal loes\nfully develop and it seemed like it was\nearly into your your 20s um you know I\nalways say that it's not surprising that\nyou can't rent a car until you're 25\nthat's insurance companies knew before\nneur scientists did as to when your\nfrontal loes have you know when your\ndecision-making skills at their highest\nand so that's probably about right into\nyour 20s um is probably before your\nfrontals are fully developed and it's\nreally interesting question is why why\ndoes it take so long it's the area of\nthe brain that takes the longest to\ndevelop and why is that and I think\nthere's a reason I think that this sort\nof slow development of frontales allows\nus to to explore allows us to think\nabout novel ways of solving problems\nallows us to take in the world if they\nwere shut off\nearlier uh it it would lead to maybe a\nmuch more sort of rigid kind of you know\nless flexible kind of uh behavior that\nthat we see things so I so I think that\nthat it helps to be uh it take a long\ntime to develop but also it obviously\nleads to some problems sometimes in\nadolescence as as as we see\nsometimes can one see a la of frontal L\nmaturity in just the sheer number of\nphysical movements that a child makes um\nso for instance in a classroom of you\nknow let's say um you know fourth\ngraders um oftentimes there'll be a\nrange of uh a parent of ability of kids\nto sit still or to listen um do we think\nthat the kid that's having a hard time\nfocusing and listening to instructions\nor steadying their body when they're\ntold to sit still um I don't know if\nthey still tell kids to sit still but\nthey were telling me to sit still when I\nwas a kid um is that um somehow\nreflective of a you know slightly\nlagging frontal frontal L function um\nand maturity whereas that you know the\nthe kids that can sit you know still and\nstoic and focus does that mean that\nthey're a little bit more accelerated\nalong that trajectory yeah it's hard to\nsay I mean the frontal lobe is B is a\nbig territory and we can get into it but\nthere's you know the frontal L probably\nhas 25 different sub regions within it\nand and so grossly we think about the\nfrontal loopes as the lateral portion of\nthe frontal loopes which is involved in\nthese executive function probably\nsupports these exective function\nabilities but then we've got another\npart of the frontal loes called the\norbital frontal cortex which is probably\ninvolved more in Social and emotional\nBehavior so you know when we think again\nwhen we think about frontal behaviors uh\nthey kind of you have to break there's\nso many different type of frontal\nbehaviors so that type of behavior which\nmay be involved in sort of being able to\ninhibit you know your motor movements or\nmaybe not being distracted May reflect\nthat that system is a little bit delayed\nbut it could be that another system the\none that's involved in planning and\norganizes you know is more developed and\nI do I do think they they develop at\ndifferent\ntrajectories so with the frontal loes\nessentially um serving an executive or\nCEO type function goal directed Behavior\nintentions cognitive control uh these\nare the terms you used\num where are the rules what do the rules\nrules look like you know when I think\nabout brain function which I've spent a\nlot of my life thinking about we think\nabout chemical and electrical signaling\nbetween neurons different neurons\ncommunicating more or less at a given\nmoment reflecting some sort of circuit\nas we call it and then some Behavior or\nsome decision comes out and if I for\ninstance um I have to get my driver's\nlicense renewed soon so if I go to the\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles what a\nlovely experience that is um the moment\nI get there the I sort of lock into a\ncertain rule set um when I'm home I'm in\na different rule set when I'm in with my\nfriends versus when I'm with my parents\ndifferent rule sets and it seems that\nthe frontal lobe is really good at um\ndrawing on context based on knowledge of\nwhere one is um and then coming up with\nkind of algorithms that are appropriate\nor inappropriate to run in that context\nbut what is the nature of these\nalgorithms are they um of the okay shut\ndown all all um cursing in this\nenvironment um okay you're free to just\nquote unquote be you I mean when when it\nreally comes down to it it has some\ninteresting philosophical aspects too\nbecause uh just be yourself be authentic\nbe vulnerable you know all these things\nmake sense but of\ncourse one needs to be appropriate with\nthe context so how how do does this work\nlike what what is the what are the\nalgorithms how how does this work right\nbecause because that's a pretty common\nexample of our patients that they they\ndon't follow the rules um they they you\nknow if you're sitting in a someone's\nthe doctor's office and the phone rings\nyou you you know not to pick up his\nphone but the patients don't and they\nthey may pick up the phone there there's\nthis Dr L who's a a neurologist from\nFrance published these beautiful papers\nin the 80s of all these things that\npatients did that just that broke the\nrules and and so and BR just kind of\npulled to the their environment without\nhaving any context to it if you put a\npair of glasses on the table uh and\ndidn't ask him to put them on they would\nput them on even if they had a pair of\nglasses on already or he took them to\ntheir apartment and they saw the bed and\nthey jump into the bed and go under the\ncovers or he saw he had a nurse and she\nhe put a blood pressure cuff there and\nshe picked up the blood pressure cuff\nand just started taking his blood\npressure again not asking him to do any\nof these things and so they they they\njust don't follow sort of the social\nrules but they're there they they\nhaven't lost rules if you ask these\npatients was that the appropriate thing\nto do they'll say no\nthey know it's not they know it's\nappropriate yeah they say no I'm not\nsupposed to answer your phone but oh wow\nso they know better but they can't\ncontrol the impulse exactly so it's it's\nit's so it's not a breakdown that the\nrules disappear it's that they can't\napply the rule they can't apply the\nrules Pro properly and and and that's\ntrue for a lot of PA patients even with\nkids you know you tell them uh don't\nhave anything to eat before dinner\nbecause we're having dinner and then\nthey're sitting there having a sandwich\nand you say what did I just tell you you\nsaid well don't eat but I'm I'm hungry\nright as another sort of example sort of\nthe frontal Lo's not completely kind of\ndeveloped so when I think about rules I\nI think about the brain you know the\nbrain processes information obviously\nbut it also stores information the most\nimportant thing it does is store all\nsorts of information all over the brain\nand I think what the frontal loes do is\nthey store rules and what's interesting\nuh about the way it stores rules they\nseem to store the rules and hierarchical\nfashion um and what I mean by that is\nthat there's different levels to rules I\nlike to give the example of uh playing\ngolf I tell a story a lot about my good\nfriend bob Knight when he hits a ball\ninto the you know off into the woods and\nhe has to try and hit the ball out of\nthe woods he's holding on to all\ndifferent levels of rules on how to\nsuccessfully get his ball back towards\nthe green so the most simplest one is\njust like where you know where is the FL\nyou know I've got to maintain the uh\norientation to get to the flag you know\nso he's holding that he also at a higher\nlevel rules he knows that if he kicks\nthe ball it's a penalty so he's not\ngoing to do that right and then another\nhigher level rule might be if I just\nkeep doing this you know then this is\ngoing to be healthy for me so he's\nstoring all this information at sort of\nat different levels of hierarchy and\nhe's apply he's applying it to\nultimately achieve this very simple Act\nof or not so simple Act of of hitting\nthe golf ball\nso yes so I just I think about sort of\nthe frontal cortex is able to call upon\nthe rule in the appropriate context and\nif you don't have your frontal loes it\nit it doesn't get pulled up properly and\nthose rules must be learned right that\nit there's no way I can imagine that one\ncan be born into the world with these\nrules sets intact um I think about the\nthe two marshmallow experiment that's\nsort of famous now um where kids are\noffered to eat uh one marshmallow right\nway or defer and get two marshmallows\nthese uh adorable videos of the kid the\nvery strategies they use like Turning\nAway poking the marshmallow and you know\nthere's some debate uh ongoing as to\nwhether or not uh success or lack of\nsuccess in deferring to the two\nmarshmallow reward is um predictive of\nof other things in life but leaving that\naside um am I correct in assuming that\nthat task is a frontal lobe task the\nkids are given a novel rule you can have\none marshmallow now or wait\num patiently and then uh with and\novercome the craving for that one\nmarshmallow and then you'll get two um\nand presumably that um that experiment\nis engaging the frontal loes and you\nknow we can only speculate but um some\nkids are able to defer some are not um\nand I can imagine that at that age\nthere's a lot of neuroplasticity um\nstrengthening and weakening of\nConnections in the brain on in an\nexperience dependent way so does that\nmean that um children and perhaps adults\nas well can train up their prefrontal C\ncortical abilities to strategize and\ndefer in a way that's adaptive\nabsolutely I mean definitely you can\nlearn strategies to not only sort of\nlearn rules um but but how to apply\ngoals when when you start to think about\nthat task in particular some of it has\nto do with sort of maintaining a goal\nand and maintaining a goal at different\nyou know time scales right and children\ntend to sort of act on goals that are\nmuch more short on a shorter time scale\nyou know I'm going to have the sandwich\nright now because I'm hungry as opposed\nto wait till till dinner which is a\nlonger longer term goal and so yeah this\ndefault to sort of the shorter you can\nyou can learn that maintaining a longer\ntype goal uh can be much more beneficial\nuh than than the short-term goal even\nthough it doesn't seem obvious and we\nall learn that right we as we as we get\nolder most of us we keep our eye on the\nball sort long-term goals and that's\nvery predictive of how successful we can\nwe can be the farther out we can\nmaintain a goal and that's what the\nthat's what the prefrontal cortext does\nit maintains goals and then applies\nthose goals and if you don't apply them\nthen you lose you know then you then all\nof this executive function breaks down\ndo you think that these algorithms and\nrules that the prefrontal cortical\ncircuitry can learn and indeed does\nlearn can generalize so for instance\nwhen I my first year of college was this\ndisaster uh for reasons that aren't\ninteresting right now but then when I\ncame back my sophomore year really\nspring of my freshman year I was like\nokay it's on it was I had to rescue\nmyself and so one of the things I used\nto do was I would study um and I would\nset a timer so I refuse to get up even\nif I had to use the the restroom very\nvery badly I would um set up all sorts\nof Behavioral constraints um and I like\nto think that I was building up my\nprefrontal ability to refocus on the\nmaterial and fortunately for me there\nwere no smartphones back then it was\nmuch easier internet now we had email\nbut no no real internet browsing to to\nspeak of and I like to think that the I\nsometimes call it uh and this is\nterrible um to call it this because it's\nnot uh nearly exhaustive of the\nunderlying function but I call it sort\nof like lyic friction it's like there's\nthis friction that one feels mentally\nlike you want to get up you want to use\nthe restroom you want to eat something\nyou want to call a friend but you stay\nfocused on the task at hand do you think\nthat that business of quote unquote St\nstay focused on the task at hand can\ngeneralize because of the sensations it\ngenerates in the body and then you oh\nthis is familiar this is just like\nstudying but in a different context one\nis one stays focused or do you think\nthat the prefrontal cortex is is so\ncontext specific that it needs to learn\na Ru the rules for every individual\nsituation and then this has all sorts of\nimplications for Behavioral restraint\nand focus and attention deficit so uh if\nyou could just speculate um I know a\nnumber of people are interested in how\nthey can be more focused and people\noften defer to like what supplement what\ndrug okay that those are interesting\nconversations but I think ultimately\nwe're talking about neural circuitry\nyeah I mean it absolutely can generalize\nit that's been a frustrating thing and\ntrying to develop what we call cognitive\ntherapy where we we teach we try to\nimprove someone's memory ability or we\ntry to improve someone's executive\nfunction ability the the disappointing\nearly results was always that yeah they\nget very good at the task that you've\ntrained them at but it doesn't seem to\ngeneralize to anything else so if you\nteach them a you know a task they can do\namazing things like match a finger to a\ncolor to a shape and put together all\nsorts of rules and then and they're\nreally good at that task very quickly\nand then nothing's really changed in\ntheir real life but but I think we've\nlearned on how to sort of on how to try\nand make it uh translate to real life\nand and so for example there's there's a\ntherapy called goal Management training\nwhich is developed um by Brian LaVine\nand colleagues at the rotman Research\nInstitute of Toronto where they've been\nvery successful\nin teaching uh patients how to improve\nyour executive function uh and how to\nmake that translate into your real world\nbut it's it's very hard work it's it's\nvery therapist driven it requires um it\nrequires a series of of trainings for\nexample people learn uh they develop\nindividual projects like planning a meal\nor planning a family vacation or\nplanning a podcast and then they work\nthrough what's involved in that sort of\nvery specific project how you how you\nstay focused how you don't just get\ndistracted how you you keep your eye on\nthe ball how you break it down to subg\ngoals how you um you monitor what you're\ndoing how you don't let anxiety and\nprocrastination get involved but it's a\nit's a very active sort of process but\nwhen you add all that to it in a very\ndisciplined way over the course of many\nhours many weeks it does translate\npatients and individuals just say yeah\nI'm just better at doing things I mean\nthe whole goal is to do things right and\nand just better at it I don't know what\nit is but I'm I'm not just better at\nwhat you taught me I'm just better at\nother things so I do have a lot of hope\nthat these kind of therapies will\ngeneralize to the you know to people's\nreal life I throughout the term lyic\nfriction again not a technical or\nclinical or official term in any way but\njust a way to kind of capture um some of\nthe interactions of the frontal cortex\nwith other circuitry I mean there's far\nmore um involved in agitation and\nchallenges focusing than the lyic system\nbut it it certainly is involved\num when thinking about the frontal\ncortex I often think about its\nconnections with other areas of the\nbrain so maybe we could talk a little\nbit about those connections and and in\nparticular the connections from the\nfrontal cortex to let's call it um\ncircuitry that controls reflexive\nbehaviors um what are what is the nature\nof that circuitry and um can we make any\ngeneralate statements like does the\nfrontal cortex really serve to um\nprovide a\nquieting um suppressive function on\nreflexes or is it more of an Orchestra\nconductor where it's saying okay A\nlittle bit of that and a little bit of\nthat um and then what's what comes out\nin Behavior or speech is something that\nlooks very organized but is actually the\nthe the reflection of a lot of selective\nfiltering yeah I mean the prefrontal\ncortex what's so fascinating about it is\nthat it I would say it connects to every\npart of the brain uh cortex and the\nsubcortex and almost every part of the\nbrain connects to it so that I mean that\nright there tells you it's a pretty\nimportant area and it has to if it's\ngoing to be in this CEO you know\nconductor type experience uh role and so\nit's in this privileged position just\nanatomically so that that gives us great\ninsight to how important it is and so it\nis connecting and then of course we\ncould talk about it how it's connected\nto the body as well how it controls\nheart rate and respir ations as well so\nit's not just just the brain so um but\nit's really interesting like like you\nsaid is is it really just sort of\nmaintaining telling you what's relevant\nand what's not relevant or is it\nallowing you to switch I think it does\nall those things it it it definitely\nwhat we call sends these top down\nsignals it's sending signals to the\nother brain about what you should be\npaying attention to and what you\nshouldn't be paying attention to so for\nexample if you we've done studies with\nfunctional Imaging where we have them\nlook at pictures of faces and scen\nand that lights up the back of your\nbrain your visual cortex has areas that\nare can process faces and process scenes\nand um but sometimes we have you just\nwant to pay attention to the faces and\nnot the scenes and other times we want\nyou to pay attention to the scenes and\nnot the faces well you know even though\nit's getting the same bottom up visual\ninput the prefrontal cortex will will\nshow greater activity to the relevant\ninformation it it'll it'll sort it's\nsending a signal say pay attention to\nthe faces ignore the scenes and uh or\nvice versa so it's it's directing all of\nthis information that been bombarded\nwith to what's what's relevant but at\nthe same time it's also uh allowing us\nto switch if if that we now have to go\nswitch to another task it says okay this\nis not important now we're going to move\nover to this this other other task so\nthere's many different components of how\nI can you know how I can kind of control\nBehavior but it does all of these things\nin this incredible way that we still\ndon't completely understand but we know\nthat's the source of of all of this\ncontrol is coming from the prefrontal\ncortex I'd like to take a brief moment\nand thank one of our sponsors and that's\nag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that also contains adaptogens I\nstarted taking ag1 way back in 2012 the\nreason I started taking it and the\nreason I still take it every day is that\nit ensures that I meet all of my quotas\nfor vitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are a number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in sufficient quantities so ag1\nallows ows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports\nso many different systems within the\nbody that are involved in mental health\nphysical health and performance to try\nag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and\nyou'll get a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's a drink AG 1.com huberman\nyou mentioned connections between the\nprefrontal cortex and the body um that's\nthe first I've heard of that um and I'm\nnot challenging that to the contrary I'm\njust intrigued by it um I'm aware that\nthe hypothalamus and some of these\ndeeper brain structures associated with\nmore um let's call them primitive drives\num temperature regulation uh hunger Etc\nconnect to the body but uh what what's\nthe nature of some of the connections\nwith the front to the body yeah I was\njust talking in terms of of our\nknowledge of how you know changing I one\nof your podcast you talked about how TMS\nto the prefrontal cortex can slow heart\nrate so I meant in that in that sort of\nway got it that that that yeah by by\nthat by influencing cortical function\nwill obviously we can influence uh\norgans like the got it so through some\nintermediate stations yes yeah I mean\nit's you know not to\num not to be hyperbolic but I mean it\nseems like the prefrontal cortex what\nhere we're referring to as the frontal\nloes um are essentially the seat of what\nmakes us human and What Makes Us\nfunctional or dysfunctional in a given\ncontext right I mean uh I recall there's\na syndrome cluver buy syndrome which has\nsome vague um uh similarities to how you\ndescribe frontal cortex damage but there\nas I recall humans or animals um with\nthat syndrome\nwill act in a way that's not appropriate\nto context but more inappropriate like\nthey'll they'll try and eat a ceramic\ncup or Draw with a piece of paper which\nobviously won't work it seems like with\nthe frontal cortex it knows that a pen\nis for writing it just the person might\nsay yeah I know I'm not supposed to\nwrite this but I'm just going to or\nwrite with it but I'm going to take your\npen and write something inappropriate\nwith it but it it's not that they people\nforget that there's that it's a pen so\nit seems like it's drawing on um rule\nsets but that something intact it's like\nit's not like cluver buy syndrome where\num like animals and people can try and\nlike mate within animate objects um\nwhich is one of the more Salient um\nsymptoms I'll never forget that never\nforget that from from my cognitive\nNeuroscience course which you taught by\nthe way um just throw that in there so\nyeah so how how should we think about\nthis and here I'm trying to get at a\nkind of a broader understanding of brain\nfunction and context specific behavior\num it so frontal cortex is like super\nsophisticated um but it doesn't have all\nthe information right it seems like\nsomeone without a frontal cortex\nprobably knows that you write with a pen\nyou don't write with a piece of paper\nyeah I I think it's you know we think\nabout it as it's you know the frontal\nCeX allows us to take thought and move\nit towards action and there's this\ndisconnect between the knowledge and and\naction and the separation of action from\nknowledge and I guess I can reflect on\nmy patience you know when I seen a lot\nof patients with damage all over the\nbrain and all of the families of\npatients who have frontal Lo injury\nalways say the same thing they're\nthey're just no longer that person\nthey're no longer my spouse they're no\nlonger my best friend they're no longer\nmy father just something they can't put\nit into words but they're not them\nanymore there's something has changed\nwhereas if you talk to a patient with\nbrokus Aphasia who has this inability to\nspeak they can't get any words out you\nknow this is a devastating problem\nthere's still the same person they they\nthey their personality hasn't changed\nthey they feel the same person they just\ncan't speak the way they get around in\nthe world is different or if you take a\npatient with prosopagnosic which is uh\nhis inability to recognize faces of\ncourse the way they navigate around the\nworld is is is difficult and it's not\nthe same but they're still the same\nperson so there's something really\nspecial about the frontal cortex that\nallows us to be as you said sort of who\nwe are and that's the difficult part\nlike how does the frontal allow us to\nsort of take um take who we are and\ntranslate that into knowledge so we're\nnot I guess in other words saying just\njust having knowledge isn't what makes\nus who we are right it's to be able to\ntake that knowledge and and and present\nit in a way that allows us to live life\nbased on our intentions and our goals\nand our\ndesires so much of things like stoic\nphilosophy and um and even online\nWellness culture are about um having\nroutines um you know overcoming reflex\nby just having recipes scripts to follow\neach day um I certainly try to have my\nmornings be as what I call linear as\npossible and I find it's much easier in\nthe earlier part of the day to just\ndecide here's what I'm going to do write\nout a list do things in a certain\nsequence if I don't do that I go\nnonlinear as I refer to it and we'll get\ndistracted and things of that sort but\num earlier you mentioned sleep\ndeprivation can impair frontal Lo\nfunction it does seem that um as the day\nprogresses and certainly in the middle\nof the night it just becomes much harder\nto um control our our thinking maybe\neven our Behavior but um and certainly\nour emotions is there a frontal lob uh\nregulation of emotional states as well I\nknow you have some recent work on this\nso love toar more yeah I mean that's I\nwas saying earlier the frontal loes is a\nbig place and and half of it is involved\nin these high level executive functions\nbut the other half of it is in is a part\nof the lyic system or that we call it\nthe paralic system that's involved in\nSocial and emotional behavior and so uh\nthere's this intimate back and forth\nbetween these two areas of the cortex if\nyou have just damage to these frontal to\nthese areas that are kind of in the\noveral frontal lobe you will have many\ndifferent impairments that are we would\ncall sort of social or emotional\nimpairments and their executive function\nwill be quite normal and then you'll\nhave the the opposite where patients\nwith the model damage will have\nexecutive functions but they seem\nemotionally intact but but you know in\nreal life when we have both these intact\nthey're they're communicating with each\nother so right emotion and contacts and\nis going to influence our executive\nfunction we make bad decisions in\nstressful situations or situations we're\nnot comfortable with it's it's where we\nmight make a better decision if it's a\nquiet you know kind of quiet place um\nbut it is something that we can I think\nyou're right you can you can sort of get\ninto a routine and learn how to do\nthings you know if you have very much\nplanned out but what's so unique about\nus how we can be flexible and adaptable\nright when when something novel comes up\nor there's something something\nunexpected comes up we can adapt to it\nand that's really what the frontal\ncortex is really important for um not\njust sort of making these plans routines\nand setting all the rules with being a\nwhen things don't go right how to how to\nwrite the ship right I will never ask\nyou to um demonize technology um I\ncertainly use a a smartphone um from\nwaking till sleep um generally not in\nthe middle of the night if I can avoid\nit uh and I generally avoid it but I'm\ntrying to take what we've discussed this\nfar\nand superimpose the the notion of\nsmartphones and ask what are the rules\nwhat are the algorithms that we're\nlearning when we use these devices and\nI'm not calling them adaptive or\nmaladaptive they're clearly here to stay\nthey've assisted in medicine I'm sure it\nmakes it easier for doctors to\ncommunicate on the on the ward and and\nfor um clinic and it's so useful right\nbut contained in the small device um\nthere are things like uh for instance\ntext messaging where unlike 20 years ago\nwe can have four or five different\nconversations very quickly while\nboarding a flight um there's a task\nswitching element that was just not\npresent in our life um prior to that um\nsocial media in particular this notion\nof being able to scroll so move if we\nreally step back from this move one's\nthumb and\naccess hundreds if not thousands of\nvideo content from dist which Each of\nwhich has a distinct\ncontext um and so I have to imagine that\nkids and adults have frontal coures that\nare learning these rules and the rule\nrule is move your\nthumbs stay\nengaged emotions either positive veence\nemotions or negative emotions I mean\nit's it's a fairly limited um landscape\nthere when you really think about it but\nbut the algorithm that's learned is to\nme doesn't seem exportable it doesn't\nhelp me prepare for a podcast at all I\nknow that for sure doesn't help me go\nfor a run doesn't help me listen with\nmore focused attention to a family\nmember or a friend or a significant\nother um it may make me more empathic or\nmore angry I you know we can we can\nspeculate but um again with no with no\nintention of demonizing social media it\ndoes it seem that the the\nalgorithms that are being run in our\nbrain I mean are they neutral are they\npositive are they negative should we be\nworried um it doesn't seem like they\ntranslate to much else they W I can't\nsee a way in which they help us be\nbetter people in other domains whereas\nreading a book line by line and then\ngoing back oh I didn't even remember\nanything from that page going back line\nby line um playing a game of squash or\nsomething like that there I can see the\nreal value of the rule sets that\ngeneralize yeah I mean I can you know\njust historically I grew up in a world\nwhen there was no smartphones as a\nresident and and so one of the most\ndifficult things I do in practice is\nhave to take care of patients in the\nemergency room and there's a real\nemergency someone's having gun control\nseizures or they're having a stroke and\nyou know doing this back in the 80s or\n90s and early 2000s when you went down\nthere and you didn't have any smartphone\nyou you could only rely on what's what's\nin your head and I could say now having\nthe smartphone it hasn't it doesn't help\nme at all I I never you know it does not\nhelp me at all in making the kind of\ndecisions that I have to make in the\nemergency room I'm I'm trying to decide\nyou know what what what's the problem\nhere what's the differential diagnosis\nwhat how should I treat it I'm just\ntrying to make very going through an\nalgorithm like you said in a common\nsense way and there's nothing on my\nphone that I can turn to to help me do\nthat it has helped with giving me\nknowledge like back in the day I had to\nremember what the Dilantin dose was and\nhave that in my head or go look for the\npiece of paper in my pocket and so I can\nquickly pull up you know I guess I'm a\nlittle bit you know there's information\nthat I can access that I don't have to\nworry about keeping every single dose in\nmy head or keeping everything in my head\njust facts in my head but uh outside of\nthat there's nothing I can turn to that\nit's it's making me you know better\nmaking me make better decisions so I I\ndon't even need my cell phone I don't go\nsearching my for my cell phone if I'm\ngoing to go to mer room or going to take\na take a phone call so I don't see how\nit's helping sort of make your frontal\nLo it can't be your frontal loes I mean\nit's another way of saying it but but on\nthe flip side can it help you optimize\nfrontal low function technology\ncertainly it can we can maybe talk about\nit later there there certainly the\nthat's one way to get learn strategies\nis through a through a device that\nthat's easily accessible and uh you know\nto you as opposed to a book or or having\na therapist uh in your house yeah I\nsuppose I worry that um too much of my\ntime and other people's time and\nespecially young people's time is um\nengaging in a algorithm that does not um\ngeneralize for adaptive Behavior\nelsewhere and and by comparison you know\nlike a a game of soccer with friends or\nsomething right it's social social media\nis social um it's physic social media is\nnot physical but we'll we'll rule that\nthat portion out but there's a rule set\num there's gold directed behavior um\npresumably some of the things that\nhappen in a game of soccer with friends\ntranslate to some other domain of life\num because it's a single context game of\nsoccer whereas with social media I don't\nknow anybody that goes and looks at One\naccount and that's it and absorbs the\ninformation maybe comments has an\ninteraction and goes it's it's hundreds\nor thousands of contexts so is there any\nrisk or perhaps benefit to being able to\num get this very detailed portal into so\nmany contexts per unit time I mean the\nthe forb brains never had done that in\nthe course of human history as far as I\nknow yeah I mean I think there is a risk\nbut what Pops to mind you know having\nkids is is watching them navigate in\ntheir cars to places totally dependent\non on Google Map Maps I think you're\nprobably old enough to remember real\nMaps where you didn't I still have in my\nI still I love paper maps I love Maps\nright where you had to really figure out\nyou know you you had to go to a certain\nplace and you had to either look at the\nmap or or or ask stop at a gas station\nand ask these the these skills were\nsomething that you learned and you\ndeveloped and it was problem solving and\nand uh and that's all gone now I mean\nit's it's I I wonder even if sometimes\nif if uh people even know the direction\nthey're going whether it's West North or\nwhat set Town they're in because they're\njust following the directions so I we\nwe'll see I I just can't imagine that\nthat learned skill is not going to be\ndetrimental to us at at some point and\ngeneralize in the generalize in a bad\nway right and as as opposed to a good\nway um so I don't I yeah it does it does\ndefinitely worry me but like you said\nthere's nothing on the phone that helps\nyou plan a podcast nothing that helps me\nin the emergency room nothing helps a\nprofess when he's giving a lecture so I\nagree with you that that the sort of\nhaving your head buried in in a cell\nphone I'm not yeah it's I don't see it\nbeing healthy for your frontal\nloves let's talk about working memory um\nsome years back but still now you use\nworking memory tasks and experiments in\nyour laboratory if you would um be so\nkind as to explain what working memory\nis and then I'd love to talk about um\nsome of the work you've done exploring\nthe role of dopamine in working memory\num because this is so critical to\neveryday life and I know dopamine's a\nbit of a buzzword these days but um the\nlisteners of this podcast anyway are are\num pretty sophisticated in terms of\nknowing that dopamine is not just about\nreward it's about motivation and go\ndirected behavior and I think dopamine\nintrigues for a good reason that it does\ngovern a lot of our you know quality of\nlife so um what's working\nmemory yeah I mean working memory it's\ninteresting I start studying it about 30\nyears ago and I don't think I realized\nhow important it was when I started but\nwhat we mean by working memory is this\nability to hold information in mind uh\nwhen it's no longer accessible to us so\nif you tell me your telephone number and\nI'm have to put it into my phone you\nknow it's no longer there you just told\nme but I'll hold it in my working memory\nuntil I can punch it into my my phone it\ndoesn't have to be something that comes\nfrom the outside world I could hold up a\nyou know I can pull up my own if I'm\nfilling out a form and I want to pull up\nmy social security number I can hold\nthat in mind too until I put it down so\num when you think about it it's a very\nimportant uh you know ability that we\nhave that we do very flawlessly and what\nI've learned more about working memory\nis is the working part of it it's not\njust this passive holding information of\nmind but it's being able to do things\nwith the information it's being able to\num you know when we when we do a bath\nproblem which we don't do that much now\nthat we have calculators but if you do\nthat in your head you're able to to sort\nof manipulate the information and do the\ndifferent parts of the problem or even\nif you're you know you're trying to find\nsomeone in a crowd and you're holding on\nto some face you're able to hold that\nface in mind and cross check it and\nsearch and and so there's there's\noperations to working memory is not just\nyou know it's not just this passive\nmaintenance so when we start to think\nabout working memory in that way we\nstart to realize how important it is for\nit's you know I think of it as the\nfoundation for for cognition just think\nabout reading confer apprehension you\ncan't understand this conversation if\nyou can't hold in mind what's going on\nyou know earlier in the in the\nconversation or when you're reading a\nbook you know remembering the sentence\nuh before it so it just predicts all\nthese abilities that that allows us to\nto read to to uh plan to organize and\nall the sort of executive functions that\nwe're we're doing right we have to hold\nin mind rules we have to hold in mind\ngoals we have to hold in mind all of\nthese things in order to carry out\nbehavior um you know so it's it's it's\nit's really come a long way in terms of\nhow people are thinking about it I I I\nknow that uh Matt Walker said that like\nyou know sleep is our superpower but I\nguess one way to sort of use his term\nwhile we're awake working memory is is\nreally our superpower because it it\nallows us to to translate as we said\nsort of our knowledge into action by\nholding this information uh in mind as\nwe're thinking about what we want to do\nif we're going to think about dopamine\nin the context of working memory is\ndopamine an accelerator on working\nmemory is it a facilitator I mean what\nis dopamine doing for working memory and\nmaybe we could talk a little bit about\nthe circuitry um I've talked about\ndopamine before on this podcast but\nthere's a good chance that some of the\npeople listening to this haven't heard\nthose episodes so maybe we could just\nquickly review the three major circuits\nfor dopamine and the one that's relevant\nfor working memory yeah let me start\nwith the working memory the circuitry\nfor working memory because one one of\nthe important things about working\nmemory is the other type of memory is is\nlong-term memory it's it's you you can\nworking memory shortlived it's only as\nlong as you're able to rehearse it and\nthen it disappears whereas what we call\nlong-term memory if I remembering what\nyou had for breakfast or your vacation\nthis is information that's gets\nConsolidated and and gets put into a a\nmore durable form that we call longterm\nmemory and the interesting thing about\nmemory is that these are separate\nsystems everything from working memory\njust doesn't pass into long-term memory\nthey're they're two completely different\nsystems and and two completely different\nparts of the brain that seem to control\nit um so working memory uh the frontal\ncortex seems to be very important for\nworking memory when when we are holding\ninformation in line the neurons the\nbrain cells in the frontal loes are\nactive and they stay kind of active as\nlong as we're holding on that\ninformation and they're more active when\nthe information is relevant um and if we\nuh we we get distracted they'll get less\nactive so it kind of the frontal Loops\nkind of track your uh you know track the\nmemory that you're holding in mind\nanother important thing about the\ncircuitry is that if we're holding in\nmind say digits you know the phone\nnumber well that information is in your\nback of the brain and so the the frontal\nloes is sort of keeping information in\nthe back of the brain active because\nit's connected to the visual areas it's\nit's able to sort of keep that\ninformation active and so what what\nwe've learned is that there's not these\nbuffers in the brain where oh you know\nif you're holding verbal information\nit's in this little buffer and if you're\nholding visual information it's in\nanother buffer the whole brain acts as a\nbuffer and and the frontal lobe can call\nup any part of the brain and keep that\npart of the brain active as it's as it's\nyou know as it's trying to hold this\ninformation in line so the mechanism for\nworking memory is just this persistent\nneural activity within the frontal LS\nand so then the question is what does\nDOP mean do well dopamine is one of the\nneuromodulators that are made in the\nbrain stem and IT projects up to\ndifferent parts of the brain there's a\nsystem that goes up into the into the\nwhat we call the basil gangula which is\nimportant for motor function and there's\nanother dop neric system that goes up to\nthe\nfrontales and what was discovered was\nthat if you deplete DOP mean a working\nmemory drops you get a significant\nimpairment in working memory if if you\ndeplete dopamine and if you replace it\nuh then your working memory will be\nimproved and so DOP mean seems to be a\nmodulator to help this persistent\nactivity\nstay persistent uh you know during the\ntime that you need to keep this\ninformation in mind am I reaching too\nfar to draw an analogy between\ndopamine's role and working memory that\nis to keep information online and the\nother established role of dopamine which\nis for movement for the generation of\nsmooth movement um as evidenced by\nconditions like Parkinson's where people\nlack dopaminergic neurons or have\ndamaged to dopam ergic neurons and have\na you know challenges in generating\nsmooth movement what I'm essentially\nasking is can we think of dopamine as\nfacilitating physical movement through\none circuit but also kind of mental\nmovement thought movement kind of um I'm\nthinking about for those uh just\nlistening and and not watching I'm kind\nof rubbing my um index and middle finger\nagainst my thumb just keeping something\nonline um it's sort of a movement of\nthought or information and then you kind\nof Chuck it away and bring out the next\ninformation is that is that yeah I think\nthat's a good way of thinking about it\nand one might wonder well how can dop me\nbe important for memory but also be\nimportant for movement and and it's\nreally simple it's just that it's acting\nat different circuits the the the\nneurons that go to the motor areas that\ncarry dope mean will will when dope mean\nis expressed there then and boosted\nthere then it will be involved in\nmovement and lack of don't mean in the\nbasil ganging will lead to neurological\ndisorders like Parkinson's disease that\nhas severe mve movement uh difficulty\nbut when it's acting in the frontal\ncortex uh and Express in the frontal\ncortex then it's going to improve\nworking memory so it's it's just a the\nnature of where the circuits are where\nthe DOP mean is that's that's allowing\nit to have different kinds of actions\nand that's all for all transmitters the\nreason why osal Coline seems to be more\nimportant for long-term memory is\nbecause it it's projecting to the\nhippocampus which was we know is another\narea that's important for memory and\nthat's why Asel doesn't boost your\nworking memory but DOP mean does and\nvice versa I'd like to take a quick\nbreak to acknowledge our sponsor element\nelement is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you\ndon't that means zero sugar and the\nappropriate ratios of the electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium and that\ncorrect ratio of electrolytes is\nextremely important because every cell\nin your body but especially your nerve\ncells your neurons relies on\nelectrolytes in order to function\nproperly so when you're well hydrated\nand you have the appropriate amount of\nelectrolytes in your system your mental\nfunctioning and your physical\nfunctioning is improved I drink one\npacket of element dissolved in about 16\nto 32 ounces of water when I wake up in\nthe morning as well as while I exercise\nand if I've sweat a lot during that\nexercise I often will drink a third\nelement packet dissolved in about 32\nounces of water after I exercise element\ncomes in a variety of different flavors\nall of which I find really tasty I like\nthe Citrus I like the watermelon I like\nthe raspberry frankly I can't pick just\none it also comes in chocolate and\nchocolate mint which I find tastes best\nif they are put into water dissolved and\nthen heated up I tend to do that in the\nwinter months because of course you\ndon't just need hydration on hot days\nand in the summer and spring months but\nalso in the winter when the temperatures\nare cold and the environment tends to be\ndry if you'd like to try element you can\ngo to drink element spelled elm.com\nhuberman to try a free sample pack again\nthat's drink element.com\nhuberman so drilling a little bit more\ndeeply into the role of dopamine in\nworking memory uh you did some really\nlovely experiments uh showing that if um\npeople who have low levels of dopamine\num increase their dopamine uh\npharmacologically I think the drug that\nwas used was bromocryptine um that\nworking memory improves um conversely if\none depletes dopamine\npharmacologically dop uh working memory\ngets worse um but as I recall there was\nan\nimportant Baseline that\nis important because it really mattered\nin terms of the Alca meaning if somebody\nalready had relatively high levels of\ndopamine in this circuit increasing\ndopamine further with bromocryptine\ndidn't impart a benefit and might have\neven made their working memory worse so\nthere's a kind of inverted u-shape\nfunction to this um how does one know\nwhether or not their Baseline dopamine\nis low medium or high Ergo how do they\nknow whether or not that they would uh\nwant to explore going about increasing\ndopamine through any number of different\napproaches right well most people\nprobably have optimal DOP mean but\nthere's a significant percentage that\nprobably have too little or maybe too\nmuch and it's unfortunately we can't\nmeasure it in the blood um there isn't a\nblood test that I'm aware of that can\ncan measure uh dop me because it's stuck\nin suck in the brain um peripheral\ndopamine in the blood doesn't is not a\ngood readout it's not a good readout\nyeah and and especially when you're\ntalking about dope mean in in areas like\nprefrontal cortex and um so we don't\nhave a good read out there there's\nthere's invasive procedures like\npositron amission tomography where we\ncan inject a radioisotope um and that\ntags DOP mean and then we can measure\nhow much we can do a scan that actually\nshows us how much dope mean this scan\nwas originally developed to show\nParkinson's disease that that you can\ndiagnose Parkinson disease by showing\nthat there's there's less DOP mean in in\npatients that have Parkin dis by looking\nat this this scan um obviously it's\ninvasive you're injecting a r isotope\nit's expensive and it's not something we\ncould all do but we had used it to show\nthat it correlates very strongly with\nyour working memory capacity so how much\ninformation you can hold online if you\ncan hold four or five or six letters\nwhen I do a a span task um correlated\nwith how much doping we can see in the\npet scan so that that would be a a way\nthat we could do it um so if you were to\nread out a string of a few numbers or\nletters\num and I can remember all of those a few\nmoments later um Perhaps Perhaps my\nBaseline dopamine levels are U moderate\num in the in the normal range whereas if\nI couldn't keep that online um that\nmight be might be reflective of lower\nBaseline dopamine levels is that right\nyeah it's a it's a very strong proxy for\ndopamine so if you're your working\nMaring capacity is seven letters when or\nnumbers when I say 4 3 7 1 5 56 if you\nget them 437 get all back pretty quickly\nyou probably have more dope Baseline\ndope mean than than someone who has five\nthere so it's it's a proxy for measuring\nOne open so that that's one way of do it\nand that's actually how we did it in our\noriginal studies we we actually um\ngrouped individuals based on whether\ntheir capacity based on this behavioral\nmeasure was high or low and like you\nsaid those who were that can only hold\nfive or six letters if we gave them\nbromocryptine which was the Doper neric\nAgonist we improved their working memory\nuh we got them into sort of an optimal\nlevel but but those who were already\nhigh we actually made them we were we\ngot them worse and the moral of that\nstory was that more is just not better\nwe're trying to get people optimal and\nso the real question is is you know if\nwe want to get people optimal like you\nwere\ninferring you have to know what their\ndope mean is where where are you on this\ninverted you curve another way of doing\nit uh is through um gen through genetic\nstudies so we have don't mean uh all\nneurotransmitters have to be broken down\nand reuptake into the into the brain\ncell in order to be used again and\nthere's different ways of doing it in\nsome cells uh it gets transported back\ninto the brain cell and other other\nplaces there's an enzyme that that\nbreaks it down well there's an enzyme\ncalled compt uh that is breaks down dope\nBean in the prefrontal cortex\nspecifically in a large percentage of\nindividuals that enzyme is either\noveractive or underactive probably about\n25% of individuals it's overactive and\nanother 25% it's underactive so probably\nhalf the population now this is going to\nvary depend on other where you live and\nwhere you come from and things but it\nbut but maybe half the population either\nhas an underactive enzyme or overactive\nenzyme if you have an underactive enzyme\nactually more dopamine sits around and\nyou you actually have more dopamine than\nothers and if you have an overactive\nenzyme it's the opposite so we've\nactually shown that if you now go and\ngenotype people with a simple saliva\ntest and figure out do they have this\ngenetic what we call polymorphism where\njust one amino acid gets changed and the\nenzyme becomes either active or\nunderactive we can we can do the same\nthing as as grouping them by their\ncapacity those that have the low dope\nmean we will make them better and those\nwho have sort of Baseline High dope mean\nwe we'll make them\nworse super interesting um maybe we\ncould talk about bromocryptine a little\nbit and I'm not encouraging people to\nrun out and take bromocryptine\num bromocryptine as you mentioned is a\ndopamine Agonist um relatively short\nacting yeah four five hours six hours so\nkicks in about 90 minutes after as I\nrecall you saying I've never taken um\nhow do people feel when they're on\nbromocryptine I mean when I hear\ndopamine Agonist I mean there a lot of\nilicit drugs like cocaine\nmethamphetamine that are increased\ndopamine but then again chocolate sex\nand food increased dopamine but the\nkinetics the time course and the levels\nare are different for each of those\nthings um dopamine of course being a\ncurrency of motivation and reward not\nnot um directly related to any one\ncompound but\num I would think that based B on the\ndata you just described that um and\ngiven the fact that there are a number\nof people out there with challenges in\nworking memory attention task switching\nEtc that there would be a strong\ninterest on the part of the\npharmaceutical companies at least and\ncertainly the general public um in\nthings like bromocryptine to increase\ndopamine to increase working memory\ngiven it it is our\nsuperpower yeah I mean one of the most\ndisappointing things to me in my career\nhas been that pharmaceutical companies\nhave not picked up on this idea that we\ncould improve cognition and very\nspecifically improve C process with very\nspecific neuromodulators the the\ndiscovery that depletion of DOP mean and\nnot other transmitters and pairs working\nmemory was made in\n1979 um when I heard uh Pat G he's talk\nabout this as a resonant I was just\namazed that there could be a single\ntransmitter can change a single Behavior\nI was seeing very complicated behavioral\ndeficits and it just seemed impossible\nto me that there could be be such a\ntight link between a single you know a\nsingle neurom modulator and a single Cog\nprocess and just open the door for me\nthat this really could be a incredibly\nbeneficial therapy for for any anyone\nwith executive function or frontal low\nfunction so but unfortunately there's\nnever been a pharmaceu company that's\ntried to develop a drug for improving\ncognition to this to this day CRA and\nthey I mean it's crazy for several\nreasons one is that the data are clearly\nthere uh two these drugs are already\nestablished it's not like they have to\ngo through safety trials again that\nthat's already been done but mostly\nbecause regardless of whether one is a\nfan of the pharmaceutical industry or\nhates it the pharmaceutical industry in\nprinciple can make a ton of money doing\nthis so I would think that they'd be\nheavily incentivized to do it so why\nhave they um Turned a blind eye on this\nI'm not sure I mean when I realized um\nthat I could test these drugs in in\nhealthy individuals that that they were\ns if I gave them in low enough doses\nthey were safe and and I had so much EXP\nexperience of him in patience that I\nfelt comfortable doing it um then I\nstarted asking pharmaceutical companies\nyou know do you want to get involved\nhere we we can we this should be done I\ncan't do this by myself we need to have\nreal trials and real studies of how this\nwill help you know and just was you know\ntheir eyes would always cross and never\nnever got any any sort of traction it\nalways went back to sort of disease you\nknow what what disease are you um curing\nyou know what what's the market for it\nis it a parking disease thing is an\nAlzheimer's disease thing and this has\nbeen a general problem with Neurology\nit's very disease Centric it's always\nsort of F and it's always focused on you\nknow how can we develop a treatment for\nAlzheimer's or traumatic brain injury or\nstroke as opposed to how can we develop\na treatment for working memory\ndysfunction which is a problem lacrosse\ndiseases so the answer to your earlier\nquestion is these drugs are very safe\nthey we give them in such low doses to\nhealthy individuals they don't even know\nthey can't even tell the difference\nbetween the placebo in the drug really\nthey don't even know which one they're\non so they're not buzzing thinking like\noh this feels good and my working memory\nis better they have no idea they don't\neven know their working memor is better\nuntil we we show them that their working\nmemory is better so love it yeah so\nthey're truly blind to what's going on\num bromocryptine is but one of the\ndopamine agonists um can think of a few\nother um koline like other things like\nthat um do any of these dopamine Agonist\num exert this uh impact on working\nmemory or is it um does it vary by drug\nbecause different dopamine agonists uh\nsort of hit different receptor Pathways\nand things like that yeah no it's not\nspecifically the drug I mean the the\nreason for bromocryptine is that it's\nthe oldest and it's the one I was most\ncomfortable with I had to be comfortable\nwith it clinically before I'd give it to\nundergraduates at at pener Berkeley so\nthere's nothing special but other\nagonists work similarly um there's a\nthere's a drug that's developed par\nwhich is a comp inhibitor which actually\ninhibits this this enzyme that we're\ntalking about and that that also will\nimprove uh we'll have the same uh\nfunction there's been some future work\nthat nor upan nephrine also seems to be\nhelpful with working memory uh it's not\nas uh maybe not as um potent as as the\ndope energic and that that's the point I\nwant to make another another\ndisappointing thing about this whole\nfield of the pharmacology of\ncognition um you know I I wrote a paper\nas a resident you know sometimes you're\ntending to say hey can you write this\nreview paper for us and and I wrote one\nas a resident called the pharmacology\ncognition where I just looked at all the\nanimal literature on you know uh giving\nneuromodulators Aline BR um dop me or\nwhatever and and there was a lot of\nthere was a lot of animal literature\nsort of supporting that this would work\nin humans but was more striking to me\nwas that it wasn't always just a single\na neurotransmitter there were studies\nwhere you'd give DOP mean and it\nwouldn't do anything you give acid\nColine it wouldn't do anything but if\nyou gave a low dose of both it would it\nwould be really effective so these you\nknow these n trans systems don't act in\nisolation so we need to also study sort\nof how the combinations work and that's\nwhere another you know where the\npharmaceutic companies have the\ninfrastructure to do these kind of\nstudies it's very hard to do in a single\nlab to to do multiple drugs at at at one\ntime you know and then try and look at\ntry and determine all the different\ninteractions maybe we could talk about a\ncouple of other drugs um that are legal\nor have and have FDA approval are known\nto be safe in the right context that um\nit seems would fit the bill here uh for\nimproving working memory one is um\nWellbutrin BR\nbron bron uh I can never pronounce that\num as far as I know it's a uh um\nepinephrine or norepinephrine Agonist\nyou just mentioned that increasing\nepinephrine may have a positive impact\nin working memory and to some some\nextent a dopamine Agonist is there any\nevidence that um Wellbutrin can improve\nworking memory yeah anything that um\nboosts norepinephrine can do it the one\nthat we've used that's most used is\nguanfacine which is actually a blood\npressure medication so that's starting\nto gain some Traction in fact I think\nthere was a study with Co with brain fog\nfor covid showing that improved uh\nsymptoms with it so there's actually\nsome trials now that are are looking at\nguanfacine and so I would say anything\nthat boosts norepinephrine would be be\nhelpful um but then again I don't I\ndon't want to leave out the other\ntransmitters Ser serotonin you know\nincreasing serotonin increasing asine\nboosts other cognitive processes and\nthen you know in a way they can help\nworking memory we talked about working\nmemory being being this Foundation well\nif if you give veloline and it kind of\nboosts memory well that can indirectly\nhelp your executive function or if you\ngive a a drug that improves your focus\nthen that can indirectly help you know\nworking memory so what I'm really\npushing for is is not just a single you\nknow it's going to be one drug you know\none drug it's going to be a cocktail and\nwe have to not only figure out what the\ncocktail is but also figure out who\nwe're giving it to what's to you know\nlink it to the person's own makeup of\ntheir own neurochemistry when we get to\na point where we'll know we can map out\nsort of everyone's dope me nephrine\nserotonin levels and then we'll make\nreal progress in in helping them because\nright now I sort of say with my students\nwhat we're doing is just it's just like\ncutting open the skull and just sort of\npouring it onto the brain it's we're not\nactually doing that we're not actually\ndoing it but it seems that way we're not\nthe Precision is not there yet well you\nit's great that you developed this um\ncognitive task that can be a proxy for\ndopamine levels the cognitive task again\nbeing um how many number letter strings\nsomebody can remember um basically\nworking memory performance um there are\na lot of tests out there that claim um\nthey can assess dopamine and serotonin a\ncocoline levels from a blood draw um\nI've heard of the Dutch test I've never\ntaken it um but a few Mo minutes ago you\nsaid that really we one needs to do\nPatron emission tomography Imaging which\nis fairly labor intensive most people\ndon't have access to one of those um\nit's a clinical tool um so there are\nbehavioral proxies there's\nneuroimaging but also to my knowledge I\nI don't know that there's any blood draw\nthat will say hey your serotonin levels\nare low your dopamine levels are are\nmoderate your uh Etc there are a lot of\ncompanies that market these but are you\naware of any clinical or other tools for\ngetting an accurate read of\nneurotransmitter levels in in a person's\nbrain aside from\nneuroimaging no and it and it's it's\neven more complicated than it seems\nbecause the Dober ner system is\ncomplicated because it's not only just\nthe prefrontal cortex as we talked about\nit's also the basil ganglia and um so\nnot only do we have to measure dope mean\njust levels we have to measure the\nbalance of the dop me in this Statum and\nthe and the prefrontal cortex there's\nthere's a model of dop me um function\nand its relation ex executive function\nthat has to do with sort of the balance\nbetween these two systems that do mean\nin the prefrontal cortex is promoting\nsort of stability it's it's keeping\ninformation in mind it's keeping these\nrepresentations stable whereas the dope\nmean in the basil ganglia what it's\ndoing is is allowing you to update and\nrefresh you know the information that\nyou're that you're holding in mind this\nsort of stability versus flexibility so\nif you have too much do and frontal\ncortex it could lead to a very rigid\nstate where you you don't let anything\nin and and if you have too much dop me\nin the strum and you get too flexible\nthen you can get very distractable so\nthere's a sort of balance of dope mean\nso it's not just how much dope mean you\nhave in your brain it's it's how much\nwhat's the balance of the dope mean so I\ndon't see a blood test as ever giving us\nthat information but I do see there\nbeing uh a brain test that that can that\ncan give us this kind of of information\nof of the two or at least a proxy for it\nso what I was thinking about when you\nwere talking about asking this question\nyou know for example if you measure\npupilary pupil dilation that's a pretty\ngood proxy for neur for the neurogenic\nsystem right so at a given people will\nwonder what um how to do it we're not\ngoing to um go into too much detail here\nbut at a given brightness in the room\nwhat we call luminance uh the p pool\ntends to be smaller when it's bright and\nlarger when it's um you're in a dim room\nthat's sort of obvious um but at a given\nluminance the more alert aroused\nsomebody is um arousal is a general term\nhere um not not talking about a\nparticular kind of arousal then the\npupil tends to be more dilated it gets\nbigger the more um norrine is is in the\nsystem so if somebody's pupils are\nreally big in bright light\nthat person's got a lot of epinephrine\nadrenaline right in their system do you\nuse this clinically like when someone\ncomes in and they those big old pups pup\nand you're like okay they're probably on\na stimulant yeah I mean a lot of what\nneurology does is is try to look for\nthese windows into the brain and so I\nthink there are a number of Windows into\nthe brain that we're going to be able to\ndevelop that can reflect these\nneuromodulatory systems so that's why\nI've been so interested in developing\nbiomarkers because really what a neural\nbiomarker is is is trying to uh develop\nsomething you can measure easily and\nsimply and cheaply with you know but\ngives you uh information about how the\nbrain is working and so that's a bio you\nknow that's a neuropen biomarker working\nMaring capacities adult mean biomarker\nand and we're getting better at that but\nagain we're not putting enough emphasis\non it in my opinion to really sort of\nhelp you know improve brain health have\nyou ever tried bromocryptine\nvery early on but it's it's such a low\ndo you know the at the dose that the my\nsubjects were getting but like I said it\ndoesn't it's so low you don't feel\nanything and I should say with even with\npatients um that take it they they\nrarely get any side effects sometimes uh\nwith these drugs because of this\nperipheral DOP mean they can get a you\nnause volume but it's extremely well\ntolerated you don't get any any anything\nfeeling from it does it change reaction\ntime it does and that's always the\nquestion of of how much of this is that\nwe're just sort of speeding up we're\njust sort them faster but for all the\nwork we've done it's it's pretty\nconvincing that it's it's not just how\nfast you're doing it you're doing it\nbetter uh you might find this\nentertaining um some years ago uh I\nlearned that athletes uh we taking\nbromocryptine uh pre- Olympics and in\nthe Olympics I think it's a band\nsubstance now um and the athletes that\nwere taking it don't ask me how I know\nthis but I could tell you offline um and\nI'm not one of these athletes nor was I\nsupplying the Brom crype were using it\nbecause uh they were sprinters and it\nturns out that a lot of the sprint races\nare won by being first out the blocks\nthere are other factors as well but that\nreaction time you know hundreds of\nmilliseconds are the difference between\nPodium and no Podium um and\nbromocryptine was one of the drugs used\nit was not on the band substance list uh\njust a reminder that every Olympics you\nsee there are lots of things being used\nthat are not on the band substance list\nand I'm not trying to be disparaging I\nthink there's just a lot of interest in\naugmenting neurom modulation for nervous\nsystem function bromocryptine was top of\nthe list at that time I think it's on\nthe band list now um there's a lot of um\nuse of pharmacology now on college\ncampuses and in high school and even in\nelementary schools and sometimes by\nparents for their kids to try and\nimprove cognitive function most\ntypically the use of adderal viance rlin\nand other stimulants which are NORAD\nenergic dopaminergic\nAgonist okay so\num with the\nuh disclaimer caveat whatever you want\nto call it that you know those decisions\nshould always be made with a a trained\npsychiatrist um monitoring\nthings what are your thoughts about um\npharmacology for enhancing cognitive\nfunction given that the landscape of\nsociety is challenging and people want\nto perform well they need to be able to\nfocus we've got smartphones distracting\nus and um to some extent um you know one\ncould say oh well it's cheating to use\npharmacology but a cup of coffee is a\nbit of a noradrenergic Agonist\nabsolutely and um certainly can improves\nmy focus as long as I don't drink too\nmuch of it right um yeah what are your\nthoughts and just yeah I think it you\nknow it kind of gets back\nto what we talked about there being an\noptimal you know optimal level of of dop\nme in your brain I I think if you think\nabout it as just more and more and more\nis better and that more is better then\nthere's really no end there really know\nhow do you know how much you should be\ntaking there's sort of no that\nexperiment was run in the ' 80s it's\ncalled the cocaine uh culture of of Wall\nStreet in the 80s that we there movies\nabout it and it doesn't lead to good\nplaces right right so so I'm all for\noptimizing function uh I want to\noptimize brain health and if you have an\nunderactive you know enzyme that's not\nthat that makes your don't mean levels\nthen I'm all for trying to optimize that\nalong with everything else we need to\noptimize in the brain so if we could\nfigure out who uh yeah who is sort of on\nthe lower end and boost them up I'm all\nfor that the problem is we don't know if\nthey're on the high end and some of\nthese athletes were actually making\nthemselves worse we know for sure I mean\nthese are healthy pen and Berkeley\nundergraduates that we made them worse\non working memory tests You knowre by\nincreasing their dopamine just a little\namount just tip them over just a little\nlittle amount and uh and so we we you\nknow without the knowing then it just it\nseems like it's it's not well informed\nyou're going to be taking it the other\nthing is I I I if we're going to do this\nwe should do it right I think drugs like\nAderall and Rin you know they were\ndeveloped because they helped patients\nbut they weren't necessarily developed\nwith knowing how exactly they worked I\nmean that's how the pharmaceutical\ncompany worked too yeah I mean it just\nit works so let's do it I'm all for that\nas a physician um but if I had my choice\nuh you know drugs that boost up multiple\ns all the catac colines the ones that\nboost up dopamine epinephrine and or\nmaner and I I would steer away from\nthose because you have no control over\nhow you're modulating the system uh\nagain I was sort of talking about a\ncocktail it's it may be a little bit of\ndope mean and a little more norrine but\nif you give take something like riddle\nanderol you're just getting the same\namount so it's it's kind of if I was to\nstart to sort of experiment uh then i'\ni' i' se you I wouldn't use adol oralin\nas the as the drug that I think would\nhelpful even though they're clinically\nsort of useful I use things like\nbromocryptine and guanosine where they\ncan modulate a very specific drug and\nthen and then yeah then the goal is to\nto optimize and and that's what we're\ntrying to do with cognitive the therapy\nand everything sleeping better and\nbetter nutrition all these are aiming to\noptimize not you know reach some super\nhuman uh potential right just bring out\nthe best in in people's abilities right\num and I'm I'm so glad you mentioned\nsleep um I would say you know sleep is\nthe the Bedrock it's the foundation of\nMental Health physical health and\nperformance I mean without that\npharmacology might Bridge you for an\nafternoon but you're going to pay the\npiper somehow um our friend and\ncolleague Matt Walker obviously has uh\nbeen beating that drum for a while um\nwhat about drugs like modafanil which\nare thought to be true cognitive\nenhancers um as opposed to um drugs that\njust kind of designed to ramp up levels\nof alertness as many of the drugs we're\ndiscussing do yeah it's hard to know I\nmean I think certain um drugs just\nimprove General abilities either they\nspeed how fast you can process it or how\nefficient you can process or or narrow\nthe focus of your attention and that\njust helps all abilities so it's so so\nit's hard to say I think this just has\nto be more work on really understanding\nwhat\nspecifically uh you know these drugs are\ndoing that's why Broc crypting the\ndoener story has been so interesting\nbecause it's a very specific effect with\na very specific mechanism I'd like to\nsee that be done with with other neurom\nmodulators maybe we could talk a bit\nabout some of the disease conditions\nthat you treat and the role of working\nmemory and dopamine in those conditions\nas well as other transmitter systems you\nknow one subject that we haven't talked\nabout on this podcast uh previously but\nis of tremendous interest to people is\ntraumatic brain injury or concussion\neven mild concussion and um before we\nwe're recording today we were talking\nabout football but just want to remind\npeople that football is just one\ninstance of an opportunity to get a\nconcussion or traumatic brain injury\nmost traumatic brain injury and\nconcussion is not due to football it\njust gets a lot of the attention but\nyou've got bicycle accidents car\naccidents playground accidents um uh\nmaybe you could list off a few more um\nbut how common is TBI in concussion and\nand maybe you could just perhaps list\nout some of the other situations where\nyou see a lot of this um that it's a bit\nmore cryptic that people wouldn't\nnecessarily think that sport or that\nthat population gets TBI but they do\nyeah I think concussion uh is much more\nprevalent than we we realize and and the\nnumbers have gone up and up not because\nit's becoming more common just it's\nbecoming more recognized and I think uh\nyou know we we underestimated and\ntrivialized sort of what a concussion is\nyou know is is that it's just a you know\nsomething that is um you know just\nyou're going to recover from it I mean\nstill the old school Thinking by a lot\nof neurologists is that everyone gets\nbetter within a couple of months you\nknow just just wait it out and you'll\nget better that's just the normal time\ncourse of concussion but as we've\nstudied it more uh we realized that\nthere's actually quite a large\npercentage of people who a year out\nthey're still suffering problems they\nstill feel like they're not mentally\nclear and they still are sensitive to\nlight and they still feel feel a little\ndizzy and and just the sympt you know\nthere a host of symptoms that just one\nyear later after a concussion where they\ndidn't even lose Consciousness you know\nthat something that they may not have\neven talked to their doctor about is is\nuh is is lingering um and so it's a real\nthis we call this persistent\npostconcussion syndrome and that's the\nmost worrisome to me because it is true\nthat most concussions will recover\nluckily the brain is incredibly\nresilient incredibly plastic and it will\nheal itself um but there are a lot of\npatients where it just it just persists\nand those are the most worrisome to me\nbecause we don't have very good\ninterventions to try and help that and I\ndon't think we take these patients very\nseriously when they're complaining of\nsomething that seems very vague and not\nvery specific to most most doctors what\ndo you tell a patient who comes in and\nhas clearly had a concussion um mild or\nsevere concussion you know maybe car\naccident maybe a sports injury Maybe\nwere knocked out cold maybe not but\nthey're having some headaches some\nphotophobia you know sensitivity light\njust feeling not right I I've had a\ncouple of these um unfortunately and you\njust feel off you don't feel quite right\num and some of that manifests as Focus\nissues this was some years ago I like to\nthink I'm through it I've had scans and\nI'm good um so thank thank goodness um\nbut what do you tell them besides don't\nget another one yeah well first of all\nall I I explain what a concussion is\nwhat I found in neurology a lot of What\npatients want to know is just they just\nwant to understand their problem not\nwalking in expecting a cure just just\nunderstanding what it is having someone\nunderstand what what happened to them is\nis very helpful and comforting so what\nwe mean by concussion and we in the\nclinical world we use M traumatic\nbrainery kind of synus with with\nconcussion uh it it's it basically is is\na tearing of axons it's the brain the\nbrain cells have these long fibers that\ncommunicate with each other and they're\ncalled axons and when the brain\nviolently moves forward and backwards if\nyou're in a car accident and you have\nyour seat belt on and you suddenly hit\nyou go from 50 to zero your head\nviolently goes forward and violently\ngoes backwards and that angular Force\nactually tears and stretches axons in\nthe brain so if you've had a concussion\nyou have torn some axons I mean luckily\nwe have billions of them and so if you\ntear a couple of th you you will Rec you\nwill recover but you you have torn axons\nit's a real neurological it's a real\nbrain uh injury even if if even if you\nhaven't lost uh Consciousness and you've\nonly had symptoms for a couple of days\num but there and there's a correlation\nthe longer you've lost Consciousness and\nthe longer your symptoms last the more\naxons you've you've torn there kind of a\ndirect relationship between the two so\nthe so the mechanism is is these torn\naxin so now nurse those don't\ncommunicate with each other and you know\nthat the brain different brain regions\nare not communicating with each other um\nso and it turns out the most common\nplace for axon tears in the in the\nfrontal loes and so now we talked about\nall these things that the frontal loes\ndo to orchestrate the rest of the brain\nwhile it doesn't it has some injured\nPathways and that's why a lot of the\nsymptoms that patients have are these\nkind of mild executive symptoms this\nthis mental fog that they're describing\nis this ability just this ability to to\nto get things get things done they don't\nlose knowledge of who they they don't\nforget their name or you know forget\nwhere they live or lose memories from\nthe past or anything like that but they\njust they don't officially get things\ndone as well as they used to it only\ntakes a little bit of a drop right you\npeople think you have to have a big uh\ndrop in performance to have it have a\nreal life impact just a 1% drop and\nyou're you're having a hard time doing\nyour podcast or teaching a lecture or\nwhatever you might do 1% drop sounds\nlike a um a frighteningly small change\num required to to negatively impact life\nso um how about a poor night's sleep I\nmean what kind of drop in prefrontal\ncortical function are we looking at um\nfrom a let's say I normally get seven or\neight hours or six to eight hours and I\nsuddenly only get three or four are we\ntalking a significant detriment I I do\nthink so I I do think that yeah that\nthat\nthat the it is significant this a poor\nnight's sleep and and and we all know we\nall notice that I mean it's very it's\nvery obvious I mean um and you and and\nyou know it's hard to sort of quantify\nI'm a baseball fan so I can quantify it\nlike if you think about it in a picture\nand how fast they throw you know a small\ndrop for them someone who's throwing 100\nmiles an hour just a small drop turns\nthem you know from really Elite to\nsomeone mediocre maybe it's more of a\n10% drop but but but it's still\nrelatively small drop can have a a huge\nimpact I think people think that just\nbecause you're a little bit off that's\nnot going to that's not a big deal you\nkind of you kind of work through it and\nthat's what most doctors say you just\njust just plow through it just just work\nyour way through it you're going to get\nbetter and um as opposed to saying yeah\nyou really had a brain injury um this is\nwhat happened we need to rehabilitate\nyou just like we would do if you tore\nyour anterior crucial ligament I don't\nknow why tearing your\nligament or your kiles tendon gets more\ninterest than than tearing axons in in\nyour brain it's it's it's amazing to me\nthat that there's more emphasis on\nOrthopedic injuries than than brain\ninjuries yeah I don't know why that is\neither I think the brain is mysterious\nenough that um most people and and um\nmany clinicians just kind of back away\nwith hands raised but if you are in the\nfield of Neurology or Psychiatry I\nsuppose that then one has officially\nsigned on to try and resolve these\nmatters um so for somebody that um has a\ntraumatic brain injury or or lowlevel\ncon concussion excuse me um would part\nof the uh primary advice be to try and\nget one's sleep as as good as possible\ngiven that sleep deprivation can\ncompound um traumatic brain injury uh\ninduce deficits in working memory and\nwho knows maybe a good portion of the\ndeficits in working memory due to um\ntraumatic brain injury and concussion is\nbecause of the sleep deprivation that it\ncan cause so it get it can get circular\nyeah not only that but one of the most\ncommon symptoms that patients my patient\nwith C have is is their sleep is\ndisruptive they they they're and that's\ntrue in neurology it's fascinating\nalmost every neurological disorder my\npatients complain their sleep and and I\nstarted asking you know not a lot of\nneurologists ask you how your sleep you\nknow but I I remember back from my\nresidency one of the first things my\nattending would do when we got to the\nward is said I just sleep last night and\njust across the board you know patients\nare not falling asleep they're not\nstaying asleep and it's it's uh we still\ndon't understand why just brain injury\ndoes that so almost every concussion\npatient says I'm not sleeping well which\nthen compounds you know compounds the\nproblem so optimizing sleep obviously\noptimizing nutrition um there's a a\nquestion about activity it used to be\nthat uh we used to recommend you know\nyou had a concussion you should you\nshould don't go to work you know know\njust sleep you know just just take it\neasy for a while don't exercise keep the\nBL blind strong but now it's it's it's\nthe idea is that you should really get\nup and moving as best you got to you got\nto do what you can tolerate you don't\nwant to give yourself a you you don't\nwant to give yourself more of a headache\nor more light sensitivity but as much as\nyou can tolerate is is the the thought\nthese days about sort of promoting\nrecovery and then really getting your\nbrain back working I think you know a\nlot of my patients they're off from work\nfor a couple weeks and they feel fine\nand they think they're pretty much\nnormal and then the first day of work is\na complete disaster because until you\nactually test it in real life you don't\nknow how what kind of troubles you have\nso I don't recommend going back full\nsteam but I do recommend going back\ntrying to build up these these Stills\nskills again and then I think we you I\nthink we need to develop therapies that\npeople will will use um you know things\nlike go Management training which\ninvolves a therapist and you know health\ninsurance doesn't pay for this so\n99% of my patients don't get any help\nyou know by any kind of intervention uh\nunfortunately but now we talked about\ntechnology things like um brain\nHQ do you know about brain HQ so Mike\nMerck um which I know you've talked\nabout with with Eddie um developed a a a\ncompany called posit science were were\ndeveloped these brain training games\nthat that can help improve specific\ncognitive functions and they're very\neasy to do because they're online and\nthey you know they're there's science\nbehind them and and you can you can do\nthem so that in that way you don't have\na therapist in your room but you can\nonline sort of do these sort of things\nthat are targeting specific Mech\nmechanisms to trying to improve the kind\nof things that we think are impaired by\nconcussion and I'd like to see more\npatients get started on some of those\nthings unfortunately if you go on the\nweb and just say I won't do brain\ntraining you'll be overwhelmed with\nthings and you don't know what works and\nwhat doesn't work yeah I I think the\nwork that merenik and colleagues have\ndone we'll provide a link to that I\ndon't have any Financial stake in his in\nhis work or products um trainings that\nis um but I will say I think Mike's work\nhas been um tremendous I mean he is so\nfar ahead of the curve 20 years ago\neveryone was talking about\nneuroplasticity in critical periods um\nthey gave a Nobel Prize to it to my\nscientific great-grandparents David\nHubble and toron weasel um and they\ndeserved that Noble prize but there was\na kind of a central tenant of\nneuroscience at that time was that\ncritical period plasticity ends around\nadolesence or On's early 20s and that is\nsimply not true and merenik really I\nthink one of the people who deserves\ncredit for um making it clear that\nplasticity is ongoing uh it takes some\nfocus and and work to access it in\nadulthood but that we can all access\nneuroplasticity but it it takes it's\nthere so I don't know they should give\nmerenik a Nobel too but you know I'm not\non the committee so um just a little\neditorial\nthere the description of specific\ncognitive trainings that can improve\nworking memory in people that have had\ntraumatic brain injury or concussion as\nwell as our earlier discussion about the\ndevelopment of frontal lob function and\nplasticity of frontal lob function makes\nme\nwonder is the working memory circuitry\nand frontal lob function a use it or\nlose it kind of circuit meaning if\nsomebody you know goes to high school\ngraduates high school and then gets into\na lifestyle or college and then\ngraduates College as well and then gets\ninto a lifestyle where they're not\nreading very many books they're\ndefinitely scrolling social media\nthey're carrying out their daily tasks\nwith you know apparently uh High degree\nof functionality um but they're not\nreally pushing these forbrain\ncircuits do we imagine that some of\nthose forbrain circuits regress um AKA\nuse it or lose it um seems to me that a\nfew years back maybe 10 15 years back\nthere was a lot of interest in you know\nhow to maintain cognitive function in\nfact one of the most common questions I\nwould get even as a neuroscientist\nprimarily focused on the visual and\nautonomic nervous system was how do I\nkeep my memory as I age it seems to me\nthat training it up and then continuing\nto use those circuits is would be a\nreally good way reading books without\nforcing oneself to finish the chapter\neven though distractions jump into one's\nhead things like that um for me it's\nwhen I go to the gym I try not to bring\nmy phone and if I do I'll listen to one\nalbum of music but I won't allow myself\nto play on my phone I try I mean not\ninterrupting a conversation with text\nmessaging I mean basically the the\nlandscape I'm trying to uh draw here is\nseems like the world is designed to to\ndisrupt the the modern world is designed\nto disrupt working memory and cognition\nof the frontal loes right right and we\nneed to do some real training just like\nmuscles and atrophy and cardiac Fitness\natrophies if we're not doing ready uh\nyou know resistance and cardiovascular\ntraining is that set yeah I think that's\nfair I think you know of all the systems\nuh that decline with aging not every\nbrain system declines but certainly the\nfrontal executive system we're talking\nabout is one that takes more of a\ndecline than others that's just how it\nis with with healthy aging um not\nsurprising it's it's the most\ncomplicated system and it's probably the\nmost biologically costly and so you know\nthe more complicated system is going to\nuh take more of a hit than than other\nsystems and so certainly um I don't know\nabout regressing but certainly we're not\nwe're we maybe accelerating this this\nthis uh decline that we know exist and\nbut a way I would think about it though\nis is that not just um trying to prevent\nthe decline but what we talked about\nbefore there's no reason not to optimize\nI mean if if everything is couched and I\ndon't want to get dementia and don't\nwant to get Alzheimer's disease and I\ndon't want to get this and that I think\nthat's not the the way we should be\nlooking about it we want to look about\noptimizing health and and uh brain\nhealth and and and getting up to our\noptimal levels um because otherwise\nwe're always playing defense instead of\nplaying playing offense and that's\nreally hard for neurologists we we have\na hard time thinking about brain health\neven though we're the brain Specialists\nwe think about brain disease and we're\njust now as a field start thinking about\npreventative neurology which seems and\nand thinking about it not just like\nstopping Alzheimer's disease but uh\npromoting healthy Health in a healthy\nbrain neurologist you know neurologists\ndon't talk to patients about or healthy\npatients about being\nhealthier I love how candid you are\nabout the medical profession um and I\nlike to think it's changing I don't know\nsomething happened in the in the 2020\n2021 um era I think I feel is just my my\nbias but I feel that the general public\nstarted becoming more aware of the\nthings they might do to support their\nmental and physical health maybe they\nhad more time on their hands but I think\nthere was just more foraging for\ninformation um I love the idea that\nthrough simple practices like forcing\noneself to read a book chapter start to\nfinish without looking at one's phone um\neven if it takes twice as long as one\nwould like um redirecting one's focus\nwhen what Focus moves away is it's a way\nof keeping working memory and cognitive\nfunction online maybe even strengthening\nit as you said optimizing it\num you know I think that there so much\nemphasis now on physical health which I\nthink is great sleep thanks to Matt\nWalker you know you really you know\nbrought that torch in on sleep um and\nnow others like myself are are really\nyou know trying to amplify the message\nof the critical role of sleep but also\nyou know most people realize they should\nprobably at least walk um as you know\nthe 10,000 steps thing is not a bad idea\num getting some heart rate up a few\ntimes a week or more maybe doing some\nresistance training a few times a week\nor more and then and not just for\nathletes but for elderly folks men and\nwomen you know um I feel like we need\nthe same for cognition for me for uh\nbrain function and there just isn't a\nstructure to that no one can say right\nnow you know you need to do uh three\nchapters of reading you know fiction per\nweek or uh you got to read a you got to\nlearn a few new vocabulary words and\nthen write sentences with them they do\nit in school but then we're just you\nknow set into the general population\nand right and most people I think\nregress right yeah I mean I I think the\nbig problem uh with brain health is is\ntrying to have a measure of what brain\nhealth is and it's interesting to me\nagain as a physician um thinking about\nit from a neurologist standpoint um when\nyou go to your family doctor your\nprimary care physician every year from\nyour yearly\nphysical uh they examine every organ in\nyour body\nexcept your brain your lungs your heart\nyou know your skull system your skin but\nwhat what do they do for you you know\noutside of having a conversation with\nyou yeah no cognitive task there's\nnothing no working memory task they\ndon't measure your your brain at all and\nand it's not their fault there we\nhaven't provide the field has not\nprovided them with a test of of of brain\nhealth right and so part of the problem\nis we don't have a measurement of brain\nhealth I I'm involved in something\ncalled the brain health project which is\nat UT Dallas um which is their goal as a\nstudy uh to enroll 100,000 people in uh\nand they've been developing a brain\nhealth index and uh that's a complicated\nthing to do but I I really believe\nthey're on to something because it's not\njust cognition it's cognition it's it's\nsocial it's it's lifestyle like sleep\nand and it's it's um well-being you the\nbrain a brain health index is going to\ncover all of these aspects so they've\ndeveloped quite a interesting uh\nimportant index which which can um which\ndoes try to capture all aspects of brain\nhealth and then can be used to track uh\nwhere you can track your brain health\nover time with interventions that\nthey've they've developed so we we need\nsomething like we need to First once we\ndevelop a brain health index that's that\nthen then we have something to to follow\nand to and to be able to measure if if\nour if we are optimizing our brain\nhealth otherwise how do you know if\nyou're you're optimizing your your brain\nhealth you don't your doctor's not\ntelling you you don't know um all these\ngames you get on in the web don't really\ntell you um so when we develop that uh\nthen all of the things that can promote\nbrain health will be measurable and I\nthink it will take off the way physical\nfitness did perhaps you get enough of it\nfrom your work but given what you know\nabout brain health and approaches to\nbrain health what are some of the things\nthat you do besides sleep exercise\nnutrition um in terms of um trying to\noptimize brain function I mean do you\nmake it a point to read fiction do you\nmake it a point to learn new new skills\nlike instruments things like that again\nmaybe your profession and your and your\npersonal life keeps you busy enough that\nyou don't have to do those things I mean\nfor me I uh Gathering organizing and\ndisseminating the information for the\npodcast feels like the the the the heavy\nlifting mental work for me but but I'm\nkeenly aware of that the fact that we're\nI to read more fiction or um learn an\ninstrument uh I mean everyone else\naround me would suffer if I learned an\ninstrument but um that it would probably\nbenefit me in some real way what are the\nthings that you do or and that you um\nyou think are kind of access points that\nhopefully people also enjoy yeah no I I\nI agree with that I I think when you\nhave a a busy career and you're doing\nmany different things like teaching and\nresearch and seeing patience I've always\nfelt that I I'm maxing out on on on full\nmy executive function is being tested to\nthe Limit but you're like an athl you're\nlike a professional athlete of the mind\nyeah in a way but then then you realize\nthere's that that's that's not you know\nthat's not everything there there's so\nmany other aspects uh everything\nemanates from the brain so you start to\nthink about what should I be doing in my\nmy life as as a a father and a husband\nwhat what what should I be doing you\nknow in terms of promoting social\ninteractions with friends and and uh\nwhat should I be doing for sleep and\nhealth of sleep and nutrition um and\nit's fun you bring up books I I think\nyou know I went probably 20 years where\nI never read any non you know any\nfictional book and said this this can't\nbe good for for my brain and then just\nconsciously started you know reading uh\nreading um books and reading his and\nmore non-fiction books and just\nlistening to books or reading reading I\nstill like to read the hard hard covers\nyou know likewise unfortunately when I\nwas a undergraduate you know with Premed\nthey don't let you take any courses that\nare interesting so I never learned any\nhistory or or you know all the books\nthat I never read I started reading my\nkids you know English literature books\nthat I never got a chance to and started\nreading history and so yeah I always\nfelt just like just increasing you know\njust knowledge was was another you know\nlike I said our brain just stores\ninformation that's one of its IT jobs so\nthat that's got to be useful but but\nagain um all of these things that I do\nbelieve help brain health we need we\nneed some way to me measure it I think\num certainly if you feel healthy that's\nan important thing if you feel like\nyou're healthy physically or mentally\nthat's that's good that's a good start\nbut if we actually had a way to sort of\ntrack it the way we can track you know\nheart disease and lung disease and skin\nand things like that I think that would\nreally boost everyone's confidence that\nthis is really making a making a\ndifference on the basis of today's\nconversation I'm going to read some\nfiction uh I read a lot of non-fiction\num and I enjoy it I listen to some Audi\nbooks but I I just it's crazy to me\nbecause I'm a neuroscientist by training\nand I understand\nneuroplasticity and I do know a bit\nabout Fitness and the key role of\nremaining active kind of use it or lose\nit and maybe improve it right kind of\nthat wasn't intended to rhyme folks um\nkind of behaviors but clearly based on\neverything you've told us that if we\ndon't exercise these working memory and\nother Co circuits for cognition like why\nshould they stick around and I and I'm\nbeginning to think that social media as\nentertaining as it is and I learn there\nand I teach there but that it's not a\ncohesive um plot right it's like those\nbaby\notters that really cool looking dog that\nI'd love to own I'm thinking about\ngetting another dog um this interesting\nconference you know it's it's like\nrandom pseudo random tailored to me of\ncourse because that's what their\nalgorithms do but but that's not\nfollowing a plot character development\num antagonist protagonist\num uh any of the the like things that\nprovide like cognitive richness um this\nkind of obvious as I as I say this but I\nfeel like we're divorced from these\nthings that really helped evolve culture\nand evolved individuals and and it takes\nsome discipline but like a run or going\nto the gym you do it a few times for\nshorter amount of time with less\nintensity and pretty soon you're up to\nspeed and there's an upper threshold\nunless you're going to be a pro I'm not\nI'm certainly not gonna be an English\nLit you know Professor you know so I\ndon't think uh obviously boosting\nexecutive function is incredibly\nimportant but I don't think it's going\nto happen just with technology I think\nit's going to need it needs human\ninteraction I mean I I believe executive\nF should be taught in you know school as\none of the Court you know as as a course\num uh this school management theory that\nI talk about could be taught in school\nit's what you do with your students for\nexample when you have a graduate\nstudents um and they have to learn how\nto read the literature and design\nexperiment and Carry Out the experiment\nuh there's no technology that's going to\njust be able to teach them how to do\nthat you've got to intervene sometimes\nand say stop reading all those papers\nare not relevant okay or you know you're\nyou you piloted this enough get going\nit's it's that kind of wisdom that that\nthat you get when you get older that\nthat that that allows that has to be uh\nhas to be on top of the the technology\nso that's why I think um we also need to\nit needs to be directed so whether it's\nin school or whether it's in a patient I\nthink there still needs to be someone\ncoaching us you know and I know that's\nwhy life coaches have have been some\npeople really benefited from life\ncoaches because someone just it sounds\nobvious when you tell your kids you know\njust write you know just just do it this\nway you know break it up into little\npieces it seems so obvious but to them\nit's not always obvious and they just\nneed to be told something simple for it\nto make a big difference and in school\nwe were we were brought along step by\nstep and there was context so why\nwouldn't it be the same in adulthood um\nI'm realizing I should probably learn\nhow to play chess yeah seems like a good\ngame right CH chess yeah any any one of\nthe working memory you got to keep\ninformation online there there's a bunch\nelse there um I think uh but as a tool\nto improve cognition um I was also\nthinking you know some people Orient\nmore towards the Arts my sister is\nreally great about um she's a therapist\nin San Francisco but also um takes like\ntheater classes and she said you know\nlike improv is like forces you to like\nkeep on your toes keep the context there\nyou're up on your feet like you know and\nI I wasn't a theater kid I did the crew\nI did like the pulling the curtains and\nstuff till I went and did other things\nbut but but that whole Biz is about um\nbeing you know learning the novel rule\nset in the moment you know it's improv\nby definition absolutely I mean anything\nthat requires you to have that you know\nwhere there's a goal and you've got to\nbreak it down into sub goals and you've\ngot to do it simultaneously and you got\nto filter out distractions and you know\nyou know for example my my kids got me\none of these pizza ovens for for uh\nChristmas and you know how you you think\nit's easy just sort of make some pizza\nand throw it in the oven and done that's\nwe I'm on my third time and it's still\nnot even\nround I'll come over and test that\nsounds good that sounds good and and\nyou're in a city with great food so the\nstandard is really high um tempted to\nmake a reference to the cheese pizza but\nI want to keep the lines as short as\npossible cuz they're already too long\num maybe we could talk a little bit\nabout some other unfortunately common\ndisease States um Parkinson's and\nAlzheimer's let's start with Alzheimer's\nI think um few few things um uh scare\npeople more than the idea of getting\nAlzheimer's especially if they have\nAlzheimer's in their family first of all\nwhat is the genetic link with\nAlzheimer's if one has a parent or\ngrandparent that got Alzheimer's is\nthere a known know um increase in in\ntheir one's risk for getting Alzheimer's\nit's not that straightforward as other\ndiseases there's disease like hunting\ndisease where it's a very strong link\nthat if you have a parent you have a\nvery high chance of getting it but\nthere's so many factors that uh it's not\nnecessarily the case that you're you're\nincreased your risk of getting it there\nare families where there is something\nspecial about the family where it just\nruns in families but uh I try to to um\nnot scare my P patients children into\nworrying that that they're necessarily\ngoing to get Alzheimer's because it's\nnot that\nstraightforward as I understand\nAlzheimer's is a a nerd degenerative\ndisorder um impacts the hippocampus\namong other structures there's been some\ndebate in recent years as to whether or\nnot the whole ameloid hypothesis is real\nor not there's a bunch of unfortunately\nfalse data accusations and that whole\nthing but but my understanding is that\nif you look at a slice of human brain\nfrom an alzhe a patient that died with\nAlzheimer's maybe even from alimer that\nyou see plaques and Tangles you see\nthese um\nsubcellular structures and buildup and\nthat our basic understanding of\nAlzheimer's that's in the textbook and\nthat most people have heard of um is\nstill correct right yes okay because I\nthink a couple years ago it was you know\nunfortunately the way social media\nsometimes can work is that you know the\nidea was that it was all wrong you know\nall wrong and indeed somebody somebody\nfudged data they made up data and that's\nterrible um but Alzheimer's is a\nneurogenerative disorder includes the\nhippocampus Plax and Tangles are present\nin the neurons those are not good for\nneurons as I understand so what's the\ncontroversy like and and why don't we\nhave a treatment for Alzheimer's yet I\nfeel like almost every other psychiatric\ndisease including Parkinson's like there\nthere are certain things you can do to\nat least push the system in the right\nway\nwhy is Alzheimer's and other dementias\nso\ntricky yeah I mean it's very frustrating\nbecause the neurod degenera it's just\nit's so uh so many factors that are\nprobably involved in the path pathology\nthat there's not one you know one single\num transmitter the Parkinson's disease\nit's a decreased doope mean and so one\ntransmitter can make a very big\ndifference um early on in Alzheimer's it\nwas discovered that there was low\naceline in in the brains and the only\napproved uh treatment for Alzheimer's\ndisease is a drug that boosts a Coline\nwhat's the drug it's called deasil there\nthere's a few of them they're anticolon\nestas Inhibitors that boost asline\nthey've been around for 20 years or more\nand you know the reality is when you\ngive it to your patients they don't see\nmuch of of a difference because it's\nit's not the primary deficit so the real\nproblem has been trying to find out what\nis the primary mechanism that's leading\nto this the the the wide range of\ncognitive behavioral issues and and and\nthere doesn't seem to be at least one\nneurotransmitter that can make the\ndifference and so now the push has been\nis there one is there something else\nthat we can do can we can we block amalo\ncan we block something in the pathology\nand again it just has not been\nsuccessful it it's very frustrating\nbecause I think it was over probably 35\nyears ago I saw my first Alzheimer's\npatients and I don't believe I say that\nmuch different to them now you know\nexcept that we have a lot more more\nthings we can do just on the social side\nof things but unfortunately for drugs we\ndon't have anything that's been really\ntransformative um but again that that's\nI I think part of the and being a\nneurologist it sounds very depressing\nbut I think part of the F what the\nfamily isn't always looking for a cure\nof course that's they'd like to have a\ncure but I think them understanding\nwhat's going on what to expect how to\nhandle the behaviors is what they're\nreally after at least until we find you\nknow a cure Parkinson's you mentioned is\na deficit and dopaminergic function due\nlargely to uh degeneration of\ndopaminergic neurons there there's some\nsome effective treatments right\nlopa um did you know there's this\nover-the-counter stuff that's sold that\na lot of people take who don't have\nParkinson's I'm not suggesting they take\nit um called Muna purines it's the\nvelvety Bean yeah I've heard of it it's\n99% lopa over yeah it's in present in\nlike some energy drinks and supplements\nI people can go buy it I'm not\nsuggesting they do that I actually tried\nit um boy feel being really dopamin out\ndoes not to me doesn't feel that good\nyeah I felt kind of agitated my vision\ngot a little you know twinkly it did not\nfeel like a high of any kind and then I\nfelt lousy for a couple hours after it\nwore off yeah I don't think you can\nreally get in enough elopa to get enough\ninto your brain that that happened early\nin neurology when it was discovered we\ncouldn't give our patients enough elopa\nwithout them feeling bad because it's\nall also um metabolized in the periphery\nand so it wasn't until we cinet came\nalong which is has this deoxy decarbox\ninhib that block sort of the the the\nbreakdown of doine that we were able to\nsort of get enough dopamine into the\nbrain so I'm not sure yeah so that's why\nI think um it's not going to probably\nget the levels up high enough in in the\nbrain so Parkin's patients are given\nelopa um or bromocryptine or drugs like\nthat back to alzheimer's for a moment I\nmean what do you tell somebody who has\nearly stage Alzheimer's you just say\nlisten try and get good sleep try and\nkeep people around you stay cognitively\nengaged try and keep those circuits\ngoing through behavioral induced\nneuroplasticity but we're just going to\nwatch the the the um steepness of the\ndecline is that really is that really\nall we've got all we've got is to yeah\nis to help them uh with everything that\ncomes up on a day-to-day basis a a lot\nof the problems um the memory problems\ntend to be something that families can\nhelp compensate for but but you do get\nto a point where you can't be with\nsomeone for 247 it's it's a real burnout\nfor for caregivers a lot of the\nbehaviors that come up uh patients get\nkind of delusions and agitated and and\nsome of the uh medications that we use\nfor uh other conditions uh are helpful\nfor for treating that but it it's really\njust a purely\nsymptomatic therapy and the more\nsocialization that patients get that\ntend they tend to do better there was a\nstudy back at Penn way back that if you\nshowed patients um family movies or\nfamily albums it was a real it was\nbetter than any drug you could give them\nto sort of help their behavior so\nthere's still those memories are in\nthere and they were making some type of\ncontact that was was helping them\nemotionally that you couldn't turn off\nwith with a drug so I think the more we\ndo things like that the the more will be\nhelpful for them at least in a you know\nsymptomatically yeah I've seen a number\nof videos and on social media of people\nwith Alzheimer's who listen to a piece\nof music or people with Parkinson's that\nhear a piece of music and that seems to\nuh resurrect some at least emot context\nappropriate emotional state where he\nkind of brings the person to the to the\nsurface um again um yeah it's a kind of\na tragic situation for Alzheimer's right\nnow it seems like if ever there was a\ncall to arms for the neurology community\nand um biotech and behavioral Tech would\nbe for for for Alzheimer's for the\ntreatment of Alzheimer's yeah\nabsolutely I will never ask a guest to\num comment on the the the good or bad\nbehaviors of other people except my own\num but uh there's a Nobel prizewinning\nneuroscientist and I visited him um he's\nat a big East Coast School uh back in\n2010 and during the course of our 1-hour\nmeeting he consumed no fewer than four\npieces of Nicorette\ngum and I said I got to ask what's this\nabout by the way he's extremely sharp\nstill\num and he said oh yeah yeah yeah you\nknow I used to be a smoker but smoking\nis really bad for you because you can\nget lung cancer dipping is bad for you\nbecause you can get mouth cancer but\nnicotine these are his words by the way\nis protective against Parkinson's and\nAlzheimer's and it keeps my brain sharp\nso I chew Nicorette all day long and I\nthought okay well he's not he is an MD\nactually\num and I thought that's interesting and\nI did an episode of this podcast on\nnicotine it by the way can raise blood\npressure it's certainly smoking vaping\ndipping or snuffing not good bad don't\ndo it but there is some interest in the\nuse of nicotine as a cognitive\nenhancer so I'd love to know your\nthoughts on that um and I'd love to know\nyour thoughts on his statement about\nnicotine being um a potential way to\nStave off Parkinson's and Alzheimer's\nwith the caveat that he just kind of\nthrew that out there and this guy's sort\nof known for just kind of throwing stuff\nout there every once in a while I have a\nfeeling you know who this person is but\num in any event what gives yeah well I\ndon't know anything about nicotine\nstaving off any neurogenerative disorder\num but nicotine was used uh and was used\nin a number of early Alzheimer's studies\njust because of its effect on Co the\ncoleric uh system so there is some truth\nto that uh the coleric system is is uh\nimp you know dysfunctional in\nAlzheimer's disease and and boosting the\ncolonic system probably is beneficial I\nmean patients that we give the anticolon\nnecessaries Inhibitors there are some\nfamilies that say yeah he just he's he's\nremembering more and he's just doing\nbetter so they're they I've seen\npositive um things to it uh it doesn't\nreally slow the course of the disease\nthat's the problem the disease just\ncarries on even though we're\nsymptomatically improving the symptoms\nbut again I think it's going to take\nboth Aline and something else I think we\ndon't know should we give dopamine with\nthe with the nicotine or the a Coline\nshould we nine nephrine I think it's\ngoing to be a cocktail which which again\npharmaceutical companies you know have\nnot tried a cocktail of neuromodulators\nfor Alzheimer dise they've just tried\nhustle Coline sounds like you should be\nrunning the FDA no disrespect to the\ncurrent um people in charge by the way\nbut maybe actually I'm I'm a um big\nbeliever that there shouldn't be\nindividuals in charge of large\norganizations there should be panels I\nmean there's so much talk about\ndiversity but they appoint individuals\nyou can't get it right anytime there's\nwhen there's only one person by\ndefinition so right committees folks\ncommittees um anyway another\neditorial are there any sex differences\nmale female differences in um sort of uh\nthese dopamine levels working memory um\ninjuries concussion like things that\nwould direct people toward different\nroutes of treatment um given that you\nknow maybe there's more susceptibility\nin one case maybe less susceptibility\nmaybe certain neurotransmitters are more\neffective in um improving symptoms in in\nmen versus women do you see that in the\nclinic yeah that's a great question um\nthere was Emily Jacobs who's a professor\nat UC Santa Barbara now in the\npsychology department when she was a\ngraduate student in my lab study the\nrole of estrogen on working memory and\ndogic function and what she brought to\nmy attention at the time and it was\nembarrassing that I didn't know was that\nthere's the frontal loes are full of\nestrogen receptors there's probably more\nestrogen receptors in the frontal loes\nthan any other part of the brain in men\nand women estrogen boost is DOP mean so\nyou higher estrogen levels correlates\nwith with increased DOP mean uh levels\nand and there was some anecdotal\nevidence that in post manop pasal one\nwom women who were put on estrogen that\ntheir working memory improved and there\nwas a kind of evolving link between\nestrogen and frontal L function and she\ndid this amazing study where she studied\nhealthy uh Berkeley undergraduates at\ntwo points in time during the mental\ncycle when Ean was at his lowest and\nwhat was his highest and she also um\ngentit them for this enzyme they were\ntalking about to know if they were sort\nof lower or higher on the dopamine level\nand then put them in the scanner and\nmeasured frontal function and and showed\nthat there was a clear the frontal low\nfunction was modulated by where they\nwere in their estrogen cycle when they\nwere low estrogen they were low doine\nand if they were low estrogen and low\ndop me to start they were really had\ndecreased frontal low function and\ndecreased working memory ability so it\nit fluctuated uh based on this\ninteraction between estrogen and\ndopamine suggesting that you know not\nDOP mean is important but hormones are\nare clearly important and they they work\nus since synergistically so you know as\nwe're developing this this cocktail um\nwe certainly have to bring hormones into\nthe equation and learn more about it\nthere's just so little information about\num hormones and cognition yeah one of\nthe themes that's come out of some of\nthe episodes we've done with MDS who\nspecialize in endocrine health is that\nfor both men and for women um optimizing\nestrogen levels is really important for\ncognition and vascular function I think\npeople mistakenly hear okay testosterone\nmen you know estrogen women obviously\nboth hormones are present in men and\nwomen in fact I think um I know that\ntestosterone levels in women are\nactually higher than their estrogen\nlevels when you look when you sort of um\nuh use the same units of measure uh it\njust so happens that they still have\nlower testosterone on average than the\ntypical male but that men whose estrogen\nlevels are too\nlow suffer COG itive defects and\nVascular defects so this idea that more\ntestosterone lower estrogen in men is is\nthe is the ideal right and um uh it just\ndoesn't hold it doesn't hold I mean\nunless you want to be dumb and have a\nheart attack it just doesn't it just\ndoesn't hold um very interesting do we\nknow what estrogen's doing there is it\nit's it's specifically raising dopamine\num we don't have to get into the\nsynaptic biology but so interesting yeah\nit's actually boosting doine activity so\nit's making more dopamine available yeah\nyeah it's it's really um amazing and and\num and to think about it sort of\nfluctuating um certainly during the\nmental cycle we can think about how much\nit fluctuates an IND woman over 30 days\nbut then you can think across\nindividuals you can think about how how\nmuch it can account for individual\ndifferences so not only sort of knowing\nyour doping level but just knowing cvest\nand uh C is really going to be important\ninteresting is there any evidence that\nphysical exercise can improve working\nmemory and cognition separate from the\nknown improvements in cardiovascular\nfunction and blood flow to the brain\nthat occur with exercise like is there\nanything about going for you know 45\nminute bout of exercise you know pick\nyour favorite exercise and then doing\ncognitive work immediately afterward\nwhen presumably the catac colines\ndopamine or epinephrine and epinephrine\nare going to be circulating at least in\nthe blood at higher levels is is there\nhas that stuff ever been explored in all\nof the groups around the country that\nare trying to develop cognitive\ntherapies they they often use aerobic\nexercise as as as another type of\ntherapy and and so for example the group\nat Universe Illinois uh champagne AR\nKramer group has done aerobic exercise\nquite a bit and they can find it just as\neffective as cognitive therapy and\nimproving executive function just\nstraight up wow aerobic exercise wow and\num and so you know the hard part in the\nreal world is is how do you get you know\na seven year eighty old you know to do\nthe kind of aerobic but but now with you\nknow recumbent bicycles and now there\nhas been studies with 7 year olds with\njust putting them in mostly with we\ncoming bicycles it's sort of Designing\nwe have to think about ways to design\nexercise that can get aerobics up but\nit's it's uh and you know neurologists\nare start I think you know my field is\nstarting to realize that there's there's\nwe got to tackle this at all all every\nway we can and so now I'm hearing you\nknow you hear more neurologists talk\nabout that you know 30 years ago no no\nneurologist would say you got to\nexercise more you know or just now it's\nwe talking about exercise and nutrition\nand sleep and and uh you know it's all\nbecoming sort of part of our package of\nhow we're going to help our patients but\nthe arobic exercise is is super is super\ninteresting and and I think it's going\nto be you know that that kind of made me\nthink that um what we didn't talk about\nwas mindfulness and so when we add a lot\nof these studies also if they add\nmindfulness training to the hardcore\ngoal Management training it's it's\nbetter than than just the the the\nexecutive training alone just learning\nskills to stop relax\nrefocus kind of gives this sort of boost\nuh to Executive function as well yeah I\nthink of mindfulness likea sort of well\nthere's no such thing as traditional\nmeditation I have to be careful here but\nbut the the sort of stereotypical\nmeditation of closing one eyes closing\none's eyes excuse me sitting down lying\ndown and and just focusing on one's\nbreath and then redirecting one's Focus\nto maybe Third Eye Center you know area\nbetween the forehead just redirecting\nFocus redirecting I think of meditation\nof that sort as a focus exercise right\nit's it's not so much a perceptual\nexercise because thoughts are kind of\nyou know doing what they're doing um\nit's like Focus exercise and that's half\nof the problem with not achieving our\ngoals right is we we lose our focus and\nso building into sort of strategies to\nto main focus uh you know to stop and\nrelax and refocus is is an important\nstrategy for boosting executive function\nso and that uh and it doesn't seem to\nmatter what you know I know there's all\ndifferent flavors of mindfulness so we\njust happened to use one when we were\nstudying it it doesn't yet I don't think\nwe know enough about how we should\ntailor the mindfulness but most forms of\nmindfulness will work of of the type\nyou're talking about that's similar what\nI described as similar to what you\nexplored exactly I mean it's amazing to\nme you know 20 years ago if somebody\nwanted to talk about neuroscience and\nmindfulness yeah on a major University\ncampus let's say Stanford or uh Berkeley\nwas probably a little bit more tolerant\nof these ideas at that time just given\nthe yeah the kind of culture um they\nwouldn't have been laughed out of the\nroom but but there was a lot of\nskepticism and I feel like now\nmindfulness meditation breath work the\nidea that oh my goodness breathing can\nimpact your emotional state yeah I mean\nthat should have been obvious but now\nthat people are on board that and now of\ncourse there's a lot of interest in\npsychedelics that's kind of a new\nemerging therapy carrying more risk\npotential risk but it looks like it's\nvery likely that some of those are going\nto make it through the the FDA filters\nat some point but the conversation we're\nhaving now you know neurologist and\nneurobiologist talking about mindfulness\nnutrition we're talking freely about\nnicotine you know we're not suggesting\npeople do that bromocryptine as it to\noptimize cognitive function I mean this\nconversation would have never happened\num seven years ago no it's just the\nfield has changed yeah neur I hear\nneurologists talk about it all the time\ndo so do you try mindfulness and if you\ndo does it make your day do you feel\nlike you perform better that day yeah\nthanks for asking there there two forms\nof yes the short answer is yes um I\nthere's a very specific practice that\nI've used since 2017 that's really\nbenefited me so much which is um I call\nit non-sleep deep rest but it's based on\na practice called Yoga Nidra where you\njust lie down and it's uh these are free\naudio scripts online we can provide\nlinks to these um and you go through a\nbody scan and you do some long exhale\nbreathing which emphasizes the\nparasympathetic AK relaxing aspect of\nthe autonomic nervous system I know you\nknow this I'm saying that for the\naudience um and it does involve some\nintentions and things like that but it\ncan also just be um self-directed\nrelaxation and I emerg from that with\nmuch more mental and physical Vigor than\nI did prior and this only takes maybe 10\nminutes there's also a 30 minute scripts\nI do those and then I do uh mindfulness\nmeditation the thing about mindfulness\nmeditation that the biggest impact for\nme has been the problems of My Life\num get\nre um I get a different perspective I\nstart thinking about things in different\ndomains of time like this thing that is\nlike a problem that I've been dealing\nwith for instance um I start to think\nyou know like in the course of my\nlifetime this is you know know a\nrelatively small not small thing but in\nrelatively small time bin and I sort of\nthink about you know best course of\naction given its real role in my life\nand what I want Etc so I feel like it\nsort of orients me in time um so that's\nbeen a major effect for Focus the best\ntool I know is to you know put the phone\nin another room right that's kind of a\ndon't um and I know our friend Eddie\nchangen neurosurgeon chair of\nneurosurgery at UCSF he's big on on\nmindfulness meditation do so do you\nmeditate no I think that's one of the\nthings when we were talking about what\nshould we do besides reading fiction I\nthink that's that should be on my list\nbecause because I know because it's just\namazing that I that the patients tell me\nabout it and what we've seen from our\nour studies um you know a lot of this\nlike again I was saying before is is if\nwe had some measure of uh you know brain\nhealth that we could see the impact of\nit would sort of push us towards towards\nyou know probably doing it more I think\nanother thing that we didn't sort of\ntalk we talked a little about with\ndopamine is are there other kind of\nbrain states that sort of uh you know\npredict you know you know how you're\ngoing to respond to these therapies and\nand how if if you're going to benefit\nfrom them and and uh you know we've\nwe've done a lot of work with sort of\nmeasuring sort of the large scale\norganization of the brain and brain\nnetworks and that's sort of very popular\nidea in in Neuroscience today sort of\nmoving away from sort of what is this\nwe've talked a lot about what the\nfrontal loes do but the frontal loes are\npart of these networks in the brain and\nand um really sort of your the state of\nyour networks is really important factor\nas well in in addition to sort of your\nyour do your sort of neurom module you\nsort of neurochemical profile yeah tell\nme more about this I mean um you\nactually uh preempted my next question\nwhich was going to be and this is my\nfavorite question to ask Carl diero\ntaught me to ask this way back when like\nwhat are you most excited about now\nbecause I know the work you've published\nand and we and you've done a magnificent\njob of of Shar sharing the details of\nthat and and work of others um in a\nreally informative and in some cases\nactionable way but what are you what are\nyou really excited about like like if if\nuh there were no Financial barriers to\nyour grants Etc you had a thousand\npeople working what what what's the\nwhat's the thing that's hitting your\ndopamine circuits these days well in the\ngrand scale I'm excited that things that\nwe've learned over the last 30 years not\njust in my lab or your lab or anyone's\nlab is actually now being translated to\nactually help ing people I mean when\npeople ask me what I do I say I'm a\nneurologist because that's at my core\nwhat I feel I am and I feel I got into\nthis business to to to help people and\nso it's it's when you when you work for\nyears and years and years and and it\ndoesn't translate it it it's can be\nfrustrating but uh but now I'm excited\nthat I it seems that the things we've\nlearned that all of us have learned in\nNur science is starting to now translate\ninto some into something in Neuroscience\nwhat's sort of what's happened last 10\nyears we we're thinking of the brain and\nin a kind of grander scale is sort of\nit's overall organization and not so\nfocused on just this area or that area\num when I when I talk about the frontal\nloes as being the most important part\nthe you know the uh conductor yes I I I\nam talking about one brain region but it\nit's a brain region like I said that's\nconnected to everywhere and it's because\nit's connected to everywhere is what's\nreally um the essence of why it's it's\nso important so uh some of the research\nI'm excited most about is sort of taking\naway the names of areas and just\nthinking about the brain as a as a a big\nNetwork like a like an airline Network\nor or electrical Network and how how\ndifferent areas communicate with each\nother and when you think of it that way\nso for example an airline network uh\nyou've got all these hubs all over the\nworld all over the country in the United\nStates for example you've got Chicago is\nis is a hub and and and there's other\nhubs Milwaukee or Cincinnati but they\nhave very different functions in the\nnetwork as a whole right if if you're\ntrying to get from uh New York to San\nFrancisco which happened to me many\ntimes even though you're not going\nthrough Chicago if Chicago is shut down\nyou're probably going to get delayed\nbecause it just has this huge impact on\nthe whole system and you know if\nMilwaukee goes down you don't even know\nit you just fly right over that I'm\nsorry if anyone's listening from there\nare probably a few you kind of go\nthrough but but so thinking about the\nbrain the brain is the same way the\nbrain has these hubs as well and and you\nknow the prefrontal cortex is is a hub\nlike Chicago it's just an important Hub\nthat keeps the whole system uh going and\nthat's why it has much more of an impact\nwhen you when you you when you damage it\nor you stress it as opposed to some\nother part of the brain and so what's\nexciting to me is not only is that\nmaking us thinking about disease\ndifferently because now we're starting\nto think about how is diseases affecting\nthese hubs that the pathology seems to\nbe like when you look at Alzheimer's\ndisease and you look at schizophrenia\nand you look at a lot of diseases it's\nnot just that there some microscopic\nchange in some neuron it seems to be\naffecting hubs in the brain that are\naffecting the whole network and so we\nhave a different Target to go after for\ntreatments what what can we do to sort\nof boost you know a hub that's been\ndamaged as opposed to thinking about it\nin a in a less specific way and then\nalso as we've as we' really start to\nlearn about how the the brain is\norganized in these networks we've\nactually learned that\nmeasuring uh your network structure is\nvery predictive of of of your well-being\nand how you respond to interventions so\nthere's a metric called modularity which\nmeasures um how organized your brain\nnetworks are and the brain is made up of\ndifferent modules uh different networks\nand these Networks can either be very\ncommunicating with each other or not so\ncommunicating with each other and and\nthe more segregated they are we call\nthat more modularity they're kind of\nseparate entities they're they're\nmodular and it turns out we can measure\nthat with FM we can put someone in a\nscanner we can do this resting uh fmri\nscanning and then we can measure how\nmodular your brain is versus my brain\nand all of us are very different levels\nof modularity is it more advantageous to\nhave more modularity as opposed to less\nyeah it turns out that it seems to be\nmore avation have more so we can predict\nmore separateness of brain of function\nbetween areas yeah that the networks are\nsort of more independent that doesn't\nmean they don't talk to each other but\nat at at sort of Baseline they're more\nindependent resting state connectivity\nyeah they're they're more they're more\nindependent as opposed to uh less\nindependent with each other not unlike a\nneuromuscular Junctions during\ndevelopment are what we call poly\ninnervated that's why babies can move\ntheir limbs but not with a lot of\ncoordination look at a one-year-old\ntrying to eat spaghetti for instance\nit's hilarious look at that same kid 7\nmonths later there's a lot more\nPrecision of movement largely due to\nremoval more modularity of con\nconnections right right interesting so\nwe we did a study where we took 12\ntraumatic brain injury patients and\nmeasured the modularity so you get a a\nnumber you know you just get a\nmodularity index for each of the 12\npeople and then they underwent this goal\nManagement training and we were able to\npredict who was going to improve\nuh on the training that those who had\nmore started off more modular benefited\nmore from the training and it's turned\nout that this has been a very robust\nfinding across studies now across\ndifferent training um different young\nold patient populations it's also\npredicted things like um whether someone\nin a coma is more likely to do well or\nif someone who's older is going to have\na certain amount of cognitive decline or\nsomeone's going to respond to behavioral\ntherapy if they're obsessive compulsive\nso there's something about this brain\nstate that not only we can measure but\nactually is giving us insight into the\ninterventions that we're doing which\nagain is going to be much more helpful\nin determining what helps and what\ndoesn't help if we know uh we know sort\nof what the state is before we start the\nintervention so interesting and um makes\nme think many things but um I'll just\nfocus on two of them one is I love this\nidea that you and others are starting to\nlook at brain network activity as\nopposed to overemphasizing the role of\nsay prefrontal cortex or hippocampus\nunderstanding more that those are hubs\nin a larger theme of um of activation\nbecause you know if I had one wish for\nscience communication it's that people\nwould yes learn some terms like dopamine\nand frontal loes it is important to know\nthe nomenclature but to understand that\nif you really want to be able to work\nwith the information in a way that's\nbeneficial you need to think about verbs\nnot nouns right it's about the action\nstates of these areas and those action\nstates are always um involving multiple\nareas just like you can't talk about\nrunning as just like quadricep and\nhamstring flexion and extension you know\nand contraction it's just it just you\ncan you can break it down that way and\nit's useful to know that but ultimately\nyou're talking about gate and stride and\nthings that that have a real verb action\nto them and we haven't had so much of\nthat for the nervous system at a at a\ncircuit level we've been able do that\nfor individual neurons that's the first\npiece and then um the second piece is\nthat you know it occurs to me that\nthere's so much Rich understanding of\nthe different states of sleep you know\nMatt Walker was just here recording this\nseries on sleep that we'll release later\nthis year and you stages one two 3 four\ndeep sleep slow wave sleep rapid eye\nmovement sleep but we don't even really\nhave a naming um system for waking\nStates like we say f Focus we say task\nswitching but those are um just names we\nmade up just as stage 1 2 3 and REM\nsleep are names that we made up but\nthere seems to be a much richer\nunderstanding of like what rapid eye\nmovement sleep is good for and what\ndeficits in rapid eye movement sleep\nlead to than there is for instance how\nuh given I Network G I'm going to make\nthis up like calling a certain Network\nactivation State like State\na like we we the I feel like\nNeuroscience is tasked the field of\nNeuroscience now is tasked with with\ngiving us understanding of the verb\nStates and like what like these waking\nstates of Mind are very mysterious and\nand for the general public this is\nimportant because people wonder like is\nmy focus poor or is it is it good is my\ntask switching ability good I mean we\nonly tend to look at you know are they\nfunctional enough to do their job and\nmanage their family manage their lives\nwe don't really have metrics but for\nsleep we have metrics and Commercial\nproducts can measure that you know sleep\ntracker Rings wristbands mattress covers\nthat I mean this sort of thing well you\nknow yeah I I think modularity can\nactually be that metric some Metric of\nof your large scale organization of your\nof your brain can be that metric we\nwe've there's a number of labs that have\ndone this have measured modularity in\nreal time so what I was talking about\nwe're just getting a snapshot of this is\nwhat your Baseline modularity is but we\ncan also look at modularity how changes\non a second to second to minute to\nminute basis and um one of my forign\npostto sep Sani she just did a very\nsimple experiment where there were\nnoises there were sounds and the the\nfunctional my scan is very loud so you\nyou can't hear very well but every once\nin a while there'd be a sound that was\njust above the this the level of the\nnoise of the of the scanner and all you\nhad to do was sort of uh you know press\na button if you heard that sound and you\ndidn't pick it up all the time you know\nyou maybe 80% of the time you heard and\nsometimes 20% of the times you didn't\nhear it well she measured their\nmodularity on a moment to moment basis\nand she could predict if they were going\nto get that if they were going to be\ncorrect or not and wck and and wreck the\nsound before they they got the sound if\nthey were highly modular boom they they\nthey got it if their brain had gone into\nthis kind of you know diffuse less\nmodular State they they missed it and so\nI could definitely see as you're talking\nabout where if we could develop a\nmodularity metric in real time on a\ndevice uh this would be GameChanger and\nso and that's sort of what I'm you know\nwhat I've been interested and do what's\nexcites me is that we're not going to do\nwith a SC obviously you can't walk\naround with a scanner in your head right\nand and even I don't think you can even\ndo with the EG I think can we develop a\nproxy for modularity with some more\nsimple way of doing it can we extract\nthis maybe out of heart rate variability\nor for oxygen um I've been I've been\nworking uh with uh some colleagues the a\nformer student uh uh Brian Miller and\npost St of Adam gazali's West clap who\nhave a company called neuros scouting\nwhere they are able to um they have\nwe've been sort of doing scanning and\nalso collecting physiological data to to\ntry and determine if there's some Pro we\ncan measure the modulat in the scanner\nbut can we pick that up in the in the\nphysiology data because they can collect\nyou know oxygen and heart rate\nvariability and and other metrics that\nmay be kind of a readout of that and\nthen then we'd have a brain state which\nis what you looking you know you're\nlooking for some brain state but it's\nnot I think people are thinking we we\nneed a helmet or something like that we\nneed just something simple right that\nreads out brain State just the way we\nread out other\nphysiological uh information from our\nour watch or or something like that well\nthe Sleep trackers of various kinds have\ncertainly been able to pull out\ninformation about rapid eye movement and\nother stages of sleep I mean key metrics\nnot every metric not what you would get\nwith person wearing a EEG uh you know\nknow probe or something you know set of\nprobes but certainly information that\ncan be used um one thing that has me a\nlittle bit perplexed um and uh I'm\nalmost reluctant to bring it up but I'm\ngoing to do it um is that I did a couple\nepisodes about Sil cybin and the use of\num Sil cybin for the um treatment of\ndepression this is Robin cardart Harris\nfrom UCSF and I also did a solo episode\nemphasizing of course this isn't\nrecreational use we're talking about\nwe're talking about for treatment of\ndepression but there there's a lot of\nneuroimaging about um of patients before\nand after U macro do cocy and this isn't\nmicro doing and one of the major\ntakeaways is um increased resting state\nconnectivity which by virtue of what you\njust described might not be ideal for\ncognitive function it might be good for\num social emotional function and I'm\ncertainly don't want to disparage the\nbeautiful work that's being done there\nbut you said that inre inre modularity\npredicted improved function especially\nwith cognitive interventions uh Sil\ncybin seems to uh induce fairly\nsignificant Inc increases in crossmodal\ntalk between brain networks in other\nwords less modularity so um should we\nbe concerned no it's just it has to do\nwith how we uh make these measurements\nand and connectivity doesn't mean the\nsame you know there's different types of\nconnectivity um and so I like to when I\nthink about connectivity we talked about\nthe connectivity of of of brain State\nand versus a brain trait so when we're\ntalking about you being highly modular\nas a trait uh that's very different than\nwhat your modularity is like in\ndifferent states it it actually turns\nout you do when you do these highly\nexecutive demanding tasks you get less\nmod you get less modular because you\nhave more your networks are\ncommunicating with each other so it's\nimportant to be for networks to get less\nmodula when it's a more demanding task\nbut that's very different than than\nwhether what's your you know what's your\nBaseline modularity I see because it's\nyou got to get from your your you know\nwhere your Baseline is to this other\nstate and a lot of it has to do is like\ngoing from one state to another not not\nso much s of the absolute sort of\ndifferences so that's that's interesting\nI didn't know about those results but\nit's interesting that uh that it does\naffect sort of connectivity in that way\nI think the drugs are going to be\nhelpful are going to are going to\npromote sort of networks talking to each\nother as opposed to networks not\ncommunicating with each other in your\nclinic do you ever combine drug\ntherapies cognitive training and things\nlike transcranial magnetic stimulation\ndo you use\nstimulators yeah so I think um you know\nI have a lot of patients that I've\nreferred for uh for its approved use\nwhich is depression so I'm very excited\nabout sort of the the work that's being\ndone with it as a as a for depression\nbut we haven't really had any improved\nuh anything that's been for um you know\nfor cognition so there there are bunch\nof studies anotal small studies where\nyou can give trans simulation frontal\ncortex and working memory improv but\nthey really haven't been done in ways\nthat are we don't know if it generalizes\nif it's if it's going to be how you know\nthe way it's been done in depression in\na way that can really be but I but again\nit's just a matter of doing it I think\nit will be part of the things we do\ndrugs TMS\num and all the other things we've talked\nabout it's not just going to be one one\nthing and and it gets back to networks\nright what this is doing is really\nchanging how nodes you know the the\ninteraction of regions it's not about\nsort of just increasing or decreasing\nactivity in some mysterious part of the\nbrain it's just sort of restoring the\nbalance of a of a of a network well Mark\nI just really want to thank you you um\nyou g given us an amazing tour of uh\nbasically five Fields I threw a lot at\nyou um you know as a neurologist but the\nway I'm I I'm slightly reluctant to do\nthis but um I'm going to tell you a joke\num that was told to me um uh so that\nthere are these people stranded on an\nisland and\num they're they're really stuck and\nthey're running out of resources and um\nby the way this joke was told to me by a\nphysician and all of a sudden this hot\nair balloon and comes over and they're\nlike oh my goodness so they start they\nwrite help in the sand and they you know\nand um hot air balloon directly over\nthem descends almost you know almost to\nthem and um and then someone in the hot\nair balloon says you know I'm doing the\nmeasurement and it's exactly 76 feet\ndown to those people and then the hot\nair balloon takes off and goes away and\nthe people on the beach one of them is a\nphysician and he goes those were\nneurologists I tell that joke because\nthat was the old school view of\nNeurology that um neurologists were\ngreat at describing things talking about\nthe terrible conditions they could\nobserve in great detail but that they uh\ndid not do anything about it you on the\nother hand and I'm guessing others in\nthe field but certainly you have proven\ntoday that you that joke needs to be\nrevised whereby there's one at least one\nneur who cast a line down and and\nshimmies down and assists them and and\npulls uh those stranded uh people on on\nthe island up to the uh the balloon\nbecause uh today you've described the\nthe underlying nature of some of these\nthings like working memory deficits\ntraumatic brain injury concussion\nAlzheimer's Parkinson's again I threw a\nlot at you and you you responded with in\nin thorough clear detail but also a\nnumber of things that that clearly can\nassist in these in these um in these\nsituations such as bromocryptine\nmindfulness exercise and uh and really\nas a as an exploration of of what can be\ndone interventions and so um for all\nthose reasons and for tolerating this\nterrible joke that I just told um I want\nto say thank you because um I've learned\na ton and I know the audience has\nlearned a ton and much of what we've\nlearned has us um looking in the\ndirections of of possibility to to\nalleviate these situations and and as\nyou point out for the already health\neven to optimize brain function and\nhealth so for all of that thanks for uh\nsliding down the Rope to the to the\nisland well I'd say you know on behalf\nof all the neurologist in the world\nthank\nyou for appreciating what we do it's\njust it's just so important to try and\nget this message apart like I said you\nknow with patients we just try to have\nthem understand what what it is that\nthey're going through and I think today\npatients have to really be advocates for\nthemselves and so I think the more they\nlearn about all of these possibilities\nthe more they can go back to their their\ndoctors or whoever and try and ask for\nyou know what about this what about that\nis do you think this would help me\nbecause we have to be advocates for our\nown health and and the only one we're\ngoing to do that is just make people\nunderstand what it is that the\npossibilities are so thank you it was a\nlot lot of fun a great time well Amen to\nall of that and uh hope to have you back\nagain thanks so much you're welcome\nthank you for joining me for
