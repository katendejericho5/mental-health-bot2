    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing oral\nhealth now when most people hear oral\nhealth they immediately think tooth\nhealth and appearance and presumably\nfresh breath or lack of bad breath as\nwell and while of course two and breath\nfreshness whiteness and health is a\ncritical component of oral health today\nyou will learn that oral health\nincluding the oral microbiome the health\nof your pallet your tonsils indeed the\nentire oral cavity is an extremely\nimportant component of General bodily\nhealth so much so that today we are\ngoing to add a seventh pillar to the\nso-called six pillars of mental health\nphysical health and performance this is\nnot a trivial step to add a seventh\npillar to these six pillars if some of\nyou have been listeners of this podcast\nfor a while you may recall that the six\npillars of mental health physical health\nand performance that is the six things\nthat everyone needs to invest specific\nprotocols into each day are in no\nparticular order by the way\nsleep sunlight and light exposure\ngenerally which by extension also\nincludes dark exposure\nnutrition exercise which we could also\ncall movement both cardiovascular\nexercise and resistance training stress\nmanagement and relationships and social\nengagement including relationship to\nself and today we are going to add oral\nhealth and microbiome health and I\nsuppose we could generally call this\noral and gut health because as you know\nif you think about it your mouth your\noral cavity and your gut are contiguous\nwith one another we are going to add\noral and gut health as the seventh\npillar of mental health physical health\nand performance because as you will\nlearn today there are so many aspects of\noral health and daily protocols for oral\nhealth that extend to cardiovascular\nhealth to metabolic health and indeed to\nbrain health and to staving off diseases\nin all of those bodily compartments I\ncannot overemphasize enough how much\noral health influences your general\nbodily health so today you will learn\nabout Oral B biology and health we won't\ngo tooo deep into the biology but we\nwill go deep enough into the biology\nthat you will learn some incredible\nthings such as your teeth have the\nability to literally fill back in\ncavities that have formed provided those\ncavities haven't gone too deep into the\nteeth layers yet you will learn that\nsaliva While most people think of it as\njust spit is an incredible substance\nfluid that contains all sorts of\ninteresting and important things that\nallow you to rebuild the strength of\nyour teeth and indeed to support the\nhealth of your oral cavity and gut\nmicrobiome and body generally so saliva\nis super interesting and important and\ntoday you're going to learn many many\nprotocols including zeroc cost protocols\nprotocols that will actually save you\nmoney as well as some lowcost protocols\nto both restore improve and maintain\noral health and in doing so maintain and\nimprove your overall bodily Health\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is matina matina makes\nloose leaf and ready to drink yerba mate\nI often discuss ybba mate's benefits\nsuch as regulating blood sugar it's high\nantioxidant content the ways that it can\nimprove digestion and possible Minal\nprotective effects I also drink yamate\nbecause I love the taste while there are\na lot of different choices of yamate\ndrinks out there I love matina because\nagain they have the no sugar variety as\nwell as the fact that both their loose\nleaf and their canned varieties are of\nthe absolute best quality so much so\nthat I decided to become a partial owner\nin the company although I must say even\nif they hadn't allowed me to do that I\nwould be drinking matina is the cleanest\ntasting and best yeram mate you can find\nI love the taste of brewed loose leaf\nmatina yerbamate and I particularly love\nthe taste of maa's new canned cold brew\nzero sugar yerbamate which I personally\nhelp them develop if you'd like to try\nmatina go to drink maa.com\nhuberman right now matina is offering a\nfree one PB bag of loose leaf yerbamate\ntea and free shipping with the purchase\nof two cases of their cold brew\nyerbamate again that's drink maa.com\nhuberman to get the free bag of y brate\nloose leaf tea and free shipping today's\nepisode is also brought To Us by Roa Roa\nmakes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are\nof the absolute highest quality I've\nspent a lifetime working on the biology\nof the visual system and I can tell you\nthat your visual system has to contend\nwith an enormous number of challenges in\norder for you to be able to see clearly\nunder different conditions Roa\nunderstands this and designed all of\ntheir eyeglasses and sunglasses with the\nbiology of the visual system in mind now\nRoa eyeglasses and sunglasses were\ninitially developed for in sport and as\na consequence you can wear them without\nthem slipping off your face while\nrunning or cycling and they're extremely\nlightweight Roa eyeglasses and\nsunglasses are also designed with a new\ntechnology called float fit which I\nreally like because it makes their\neyeglasses and sunglasses fit perfectly\nand they don't move around even when I'm\nactive so if I'm running and I'm wearing\nmy glasses they stay on my face most of\nthe time I don't even remember they're\non my face because they're so\nlightweight you can also use them while\ncycling or for other activities so if\nyou'd like to try Roa glasses go to Roa\nthat's r r.com and enter the code\nhuberman to save 20% off your

highest\nquality I've spoken many times before on\nthis and other podcast about the fact\nthat sleep is the foundation of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\none of the key things to getting a great\nnight's sleep is to make sure that your\nmattress matches your sleep requirements\nthe Helix website has a brief two-minute\nquiz that if you go to it will ask you\nquestions such as do you sleep on your\nback your side or your stomach do you\ntend to run hot or cold during the\nmiddle of the night as well as some\nother questions that allow you to\ndetermine the optimal mattress for you\nwhen I took the quiz I personally\nmatched to their dusk mattress dsk which\nhas allowed me to significantly improve\nmy sleep so if you're interested in\nsignificantly improving your sleep go to\nhelixsleep.com\nhuberman take their brief two-minute\nquiz and they'll match you to a\ncustomized match mat and you'll get up\nto $350 off any mattress order and two\nfree pillows so again if you're\ninterested in trying Helix go to\nhelixsleep.com\nhuberman for up to $350 off and two free\npillows okay let's talk about oral\nhealth this absolutely critical aspect\nof not just having fresh bright teeth\nand no cavities and fresh breath or at\nleast lack of bad breath one would hope\nbut also total body Health as I\nmentioned a little bit earlier oral\nhealth is inextricably linked to all\naspects of brain and bodily Health both\nin the short term and in the long term\nand it is perhaps the most overlooked\naspect of mental health and physical\nhealth so today I'd like to start off\nwith a quiz I'm going to ask you which\nof the following three categories you\nbelieve you best fall into okay the\nfirst category is those of you out there\nwho brush and floss every day probably\ntwice a day and who make some effort to\ntry and keep your teeth clean who like\nthe feeling of your teeth being clean\nand who pay a fair amount of attention\nto whether or not your teeth are getting\nwhiter or not getting whiter maybe\nwhether or not your breath is fresh or\nnot fresh maybe okay these aren't\nrequirements for being in this category\nbut maybe you're somebody who also uses\na mouthwash or uses mints or gums in\norder to try and keep your mouth\nsmelling and looking fresh and your\nmouth clean okay so this first category\nuh does not require that you do all of\nthose things but let's just make a basic\nrequirement of participation in this\ncategory that you routinely brush at\nleast twice a day and that you floss at\nleast once a day okay if you fall into\nthat category you are in category one\nand by the way if you're in category one\nand you do those things and you do a\nbunch of other things like tooth\nwhitening and maybe you go to the\ndentist especially often more than the\nrecommended twice per year that still\nputs you in category one okay second\ncategory are those of you out there who\nare let's say a bit more blas√© about\nyour oral and tooth care those of you\nthat perhaps just brush your teeth in\nthe morning so that your breath is fresh\nyou clean out that kind of sticky\nfeeling in your mouth that's accumulated\novernight that sometimes brush and maybe\nfloss at night but you know a lot of\ntimes you fall asleep without doing that\nor you don't feel like doing it or\nperhaps that don't really floss at all\nokay that perhaps go to the dentist once\nevery 6 months maybe a little less maybe\nonce a year once every couple years so\nwhile there's a bunch of different\nthings that could put you into Category\n2 let's make a basic requirement for\nbelonging to Category 2 that you brush\nyour teeth once a day but not twice a\nday on a regular basis or that you brush\ntwice a day but that you rarely floss\nokay that would put you into what I'm\ncalling category to and then of course\nthere's the third category that maybe\nsome of you out there fall into and this\nis the CATE ategory of people who are\nextremely diligent not just about tooth\ncare but also about oral health\ngenerally about maintaining the\nmicrobiome of your mouth about making\nsure that your gums are very healthy\nabout making sure that your soft pallet\nand hard palet is very healthy about\nmaking sure that yes your teeth are\nclean that they're devoid of as much\nbacterial buildup and other stuff in\nthere that can cause cavities but also\nthat you're paying careful attention to\nyour oral micro probiome and the overall\nmilu of your health in the mouth and the\nfact that your mouth is linked to all\nthese different aspects of brain and\ncardiac and metabolic Health okay if you\nfall into that third category great but\nlet's be honest most people I would\nargue 95 maybe even 98% of people or\nmore fall into either category one or\ncategory two so as you're hearing this\nyou're probably thinking okay well if\nI'm in category one I'm good right I go\nto the dentist twice a year I brush in\nfloss use some mouthwash I even brighten\nmy teeth I you know I make sure that if\nI had a sugary meal I'll rinse out my\nmouth I try not to drink acidic Foods\nthings that we'll discuss today as to\nwhether or not they actually have\nrelevance for cavity formation or\nnot but guess what if you are in\ncategory one as I described it or\ncategory\ntwo chances are you are doing things to\nreally deplete and disrupt your oral\nhealth that's right even if you're\npaying a lot of attention to tooth\nHealth chances are if you're like most\npeople out there simply because you\ndon't have the latest information on\nwhat oral health really is and how to\nbest support it chances are you are\ndoing things that yes might be keeping\nyour teeth white and clean and you're\nnot getting cavities or you're not being\ntold you have cavities that need to be\nfilled when you go to the dentist twice\na year or more but that you are\ndisrupting your oral health in ways that\nare depleting other aspects of your\nbrain and bodily health and I'm not here\nto scare you I'm just here to tell you\nthat if you're in category one okay\nyou're clearly doing some things that\nare beneficial for you but that there's\nsome additional things that you can do\nand a few things to avoid doing that\nvery likely will improve your overall\nbily health very quickly and the good\nnews is those things are also zero or\nlow cost or in some cases can save you\nsubstantial cost now if you're in\ncategory two chances are you are\ndepleting both your oral health and your\noverall bodily Health but here's what's\ninteresting some of the folks in\nCategory 2 that are not doing as much\nfor the let's say hygiene and freshening\nand whitening of their teeth actually\nhave a healthier overall oral microbiome\nthat's not always the case but often it\ncan be the case so what you're going to\ndiscover today is whether you're in\ncategory 1 or Category 2 there are some\nwonderful and easily accessible\npractices that are well backed by\nscience and by the way in preparation\nfor this episode I also consulted with\nno fewer than five dentists including a\npediatric dentist I talked to a\nperiodontist I talked to people who fall\ninto the functional dentist category I\ntalk to people with a bunch of different\norientations who are all heavily\nqualified to talk about and to make\nrecommendations about oral health and\ntooth Health Etc and what I'm going to\ndeliver today is essentially the overlap\nin the vend diagram of what they all\nagreed on I'll highlight a few\ndifferences that they each had and that\nseveral of them they do fall into\ndifferent camps but I was positively\nsurprised how much overlap or consensus\nthere was in terms of best protocols for\ntooth and oral health and by the way if\nyou're in that third category of the\nperson that's doing a lot for their\ntooth health and appearance and breath\nEtc but also oral health and microbiome\nI'm sure that today you'll also learn\nsome new health practices and some\nthings that will allow you to expand on\nyour already terrific practices for oral\nhealth so let's get into the material\nabout oral health focusing first on two\ntooth anatomy and health and some a\nlittle bit about mouth Anatomy I promise\nto not go into this in too much depth\nbut we really need to have a firm basis\na foundation of understanding of what\nthe mouth cavity really consists of and\nI'm not just going to throw a bunch of\nnames out there for sake of nomenclature\nI don't need to Cloud your hippocampus\nwith that sort of information unless\nit's functional information but it is\ncritical functional information for the\nrest of our discussion where we'll talk\nabout ways that you can really build up\nthe strength of your teeth even if\ncavities have already started to form\nand how to really get your saliva to be\nthe best healthiest saliva for your\noverall mouth and for your gut and for\nyour brain your heart Etc okay so let's\ntalk just briefly I promise briefly\nabout the anatomy and a little bit of\nthe physiology of the this stuff okay\nthe teeth we're all familiar with what\nteeth are and the tongue the tonsils in\nthe back of the mouth we have our soft\npallette hard pallet gums let's talk a\nlittle bit about how all that fits\ntogether centering around the thing that\nmost people think about when they think\nabout oral health and that's the teeth\nit's just a good jumping off point for\nus your teeth are layered structures\nlike pretty much every structure in your\nbody is a layered structure it's just\nthe way those structures form cells are\nborn at one location they migrate out\nand form Stacks or layers those\ndifferent layers have different cell\ntypes and your teeth are no exception so\nwhile there are different kinds of teeth\nin your\nmouth teeth have an outer layer which is\nthe enamel the enamel believe it or not\nis not white it is translucent light can\nmake it through but it's not transparent\nit's not like a clear window it's\ntranslucent light can make it through\nbut it's a bit opaque okay beneath the\nenamel is a structure called Dentin\nDentin is important for today's\ndiscussion because as it turns out\ncavities form not surprisingly from the\noutside of teeth Inward and Cavities as\nthe name suggests are holes that\nbacteria burrow down through the enamal\nand if you're unlucky make it down to\nthe Dentin our goal meaning your goal\ngoal is to engage in Daily protocols\nthat's right daily protocols that are\nsimple and fast and zero or very low\ncost that allow you to avoid the\nformation of those cavities yes but also\nthat can allow you to fill in those\ncavities this is one of the most\nimportant things to understand about\noral health that frankly I didn't know\nuntil I started researching this episode\nand talking to all these experts in the\nfield which is that you can repair\ncavities that have started to form\nthat's right your mouth environment\nbased on its chemistry and some things\nthat are mechanical but mostly based on\nits chemistry in particular how acidic\nit is or how basic it is is always in a\nstate of what's called either\ndemineralization or\nremineralization now those words are\nhard to say and they're especially hard\nto say fast so demineralization\nremineralization it's a little bit of a\ntongue twister today I'm going to use a\nshorthand that's a convention in the\nDentistry field which is De Min or remin\nto refer to demineralization or\nremineralization remineralization is\ngood it is the process by which within\nthe enamel and to some extent in the\ndeeper Dentin layer of the tooth but\nespecially within the enamel there can\nbe the addition of new minerals that\nform very robust\nessentially chains of crystals okay if\nyou've ever looked at a crystal of any\nkind under a microscope or you've seen a\npicture of it they are incredibly well\norganized they form a lattice of very\nstrong often although they're weaker\ncrystals too very strong bonds and\nstructure it's like the structure of a\nreally well-formed building okay\nremineralization is the process of\nputting minerals back into that crystal\nstructure and it's actually possible to\nfill back in those cavities that\nbacteria have started to form especially\nwhen those cavities have burrowed down\ninto the enamel but have not yet made it\ninto the Dentin layer of the tooth or\nteeth okay this is very important to\nunderstand it's especially important to\nunderstand the context of the fact that\ntypically not always but typically if\nyou have a cavity formed at one tooth\nand let's say it's just halfway or 3/4\nof the way through the enamel layer that\nif you have cavities elsewhere in your\nmouth chances are that they are at the\nsame depth or level not always but\nchances are and that's great news if\nthose cavities have not yet made it into\nthe dtin layer why is it great news well\nI don't know about you but I don't like\nhaving my teeth drilled I don't like\nhaving cavities drilled and filled I had\na very traumatic childhood with respect\nto dentistry and oral health I'll talk\nabout it a little bit later in the\nepisode it's not that I had tons and\ntons of cavities I actually had this\nother issue where my adult teeth came in\nbehind my baby teeth I had have all my\nbaby teeth pulled I had to get a bunch\nof injections of Novacane in my mouth I\ndidn't like getting injections into my\nmouth so I opted to have any cavities I\nhad drilled without Novacane it's not\ncuz I was a tough little kid although\nthat definitely toughened me up it was\nbecause I hated having syringes in my\nmouth I might have even bitten a dentist\nor two or three I don't bite the dentist\nanymore I thank the dentist by the way I\nthink dentists are wonderful regular\ncleanings are wonderful we'll talk about\nfrequency of cleanings but here's the\npoint if you are somebody who enjoys\ngetting your teeth drilled well then I\ndon't know what to say but if like most\npeople out there with proper wiring of\nyour neurology well then you don't like\ngetting your teeth drilled and you can\navoid it in many cases by remineralizing\nthat enamel layer of your teeth now if\nthere's a demineralization down to the\ndeeper Dentin layers of the tooth then\nmost often you're going to need it to be\ndrilled drilled and filled as they say\nor as some people say which is a bit\nmore cynical drill fill and build\nbecause you get charged for that or your\ninsurance gets charged for that okay\nback to some tooth anatomy and mouth\nAnatomy we talked about the enamel layer\nof the tooth on the outside I told you\nthat it either can demineralize demmin\nor remineralize remin this is a key\nPoint your teeth are always in a state\nof either demon or remen that's right\neither demon or remen it's not both at\nthe same time it's one or the other and\nit is largely dependent on the p that is\nthe acidity of your mouth which is\nlargely dependent on how much saliva\nyou're producing and the mineral content\nof that saliva keep that in mind I think\nit's a very important point now another\nkey point is that next to your teeth\nright you have your gums the gingiva as\nit's called now the gingiva provides a\nreally important role in keeping the\nteeth stable we don't often think of it\nlike that but even though that stuff\nseems gummy and soft it is soft tissue\nit is very important for fixing the\nteeth to the Bone it's not just about\nthe roots that extend down into the\nJawbone below the gums are very\nimportant for keeping the teeth where\nthey are there's actually a little\nligament too between gums and the teeth\nthat resides a little bit deeper but the\ngums form a critical barrier between the\noral cavity and the deeper layers of\nwhat eventually is bone and into the\ngeneral blood flow or bloodstream of the\nbody now this is so important to\nunderstand that the gums are a seal\naround the tooth this is why when you go\nto the dentist they're paying attention\nwith that little pick they're paying\nattention to how high or hopefully low\nthe tenting is the the the little\nrecesses or pockets of gums along the\nthe\nhere in my mouth yes I'll try not to do\nthat during today's episode point to my\nteeth so much so that I'm then you know\nyou can't understand what I'm saying\nthat the gums are providing a seal\nbetween the oral cavity and essentially\nthe bone and the general bloodstream now\nthis is so critical because let's just\ntake a step back and think about the\noral cavity and what a remarkable place\nit is think about it this is a gaping\nhole in our body okay we have some other\ngaping holes in our body but those tend\nto be sphincter based holes yes I\nrealize there probably some Chuckles as\nsoon as you say sphincter like yes the\nanal sphincter okay we're anatomists\nwe're biologists we can talk about that\nstay shut stuff is generally not going\nup there and if it is not very often\nokay your nasal passages yeah those are\nholes but you know there's a lot of\nstuff there there's mucus to catch stuff\nthere's a CRI form plate there's a bone\nthere's a bunch of things that act as\nbarriers between the nasal cavities and\nthe Brain which sits right behind it the\nolfactory bulb and yes we have eyes and\nthen you know we have the outside of the\neyes and there's a you know a\nsusceptibility there but we have our\nblink reflex there's a also an ocular\nmicrobiome there's a bunch of things\nthere but think about the just this\ngaping hole in the front of our face\nthat we use to eat and speak and breathe\nokay it's a huge hole and as a\nconsequence it's filled with bacteria\nfrom our outside environment all day\nlong all day long sometimes at night\nalthough we're going to talk later about\nthe critical critical need to be a nasal\nbreather at night and not a mouth\nbreather not just for sake of staving\noff sleep apnea but also because turns\nout the dryness of the mouth is one of\nthe ways that you really can throw off\nyour oral health in major ways in fact\nit's one of the leading causes of tooth\ndecay in people like methamp addicts or\nif you see people that are mouth\nbreathers their oral health and their\nteeth generally but certainly their oral\nhealth is severely depleted so you've\ngot this big hole in your front of your\nface and you're talking and eating and\nmoving about during the day even if\nyou're a nasal breather when you're not\ntalking or eating and all this bacteria\nis getting in and it's a really moist\nenvironment and it's really warm so the\ncombination of bacteria moist and warm\nmeans that this thing is like a petri\ndish for growing stuff that could\npotentially be really bad for us but but\nit has this incredible feature which is\nthat if the pH is right then the bad\nstuff is killed off doesn't make it into\nour system doesn't disrupt our oral\nhealth or our bodily Health it also has\na critical feature which is that the\nbacteria that are good for us\nproliferate and supports the sealing\nprocess of the gums against the teeth\nand tooth health and tongue health and\npallet Health Etc okay so the oral\ncavity is Amazing by virtue of how\nvulnerable it is but also how robust it\nis and the way it stays robust is by\nkeeping the saliva healthy now there are\nother ways too but that's one of the\nmain ones and it's a huge portal into\nthe rest of the body and if the oral\ncavity isn't amazing to you already\nbased on what you've heard thus far\nthink about this if you get a cut on\nyour arm or your hand or your shin\nunless you're one of these remarkable\npeople that always heals up without a\nscar as long as you're about 25 years or\nolder typically you'll form a little bit\nscar there'll be something noticeable\nthere the oral cavity also can take cuts\nand burns and things like that\nunfortunately those things occur but\nwith rare exception heals up with nearly\nzero scarring sometimes there's a scar\nbut nearly zero scarring which is\nremarkable why well it's basically an\nopen wound with a bunch of bacteria in\nit and it's warm and it's moist so\nclearly there's something special going\non in this thing that we call the oral\ncavity indeed there is and it's anchored\nin the fact that if we treat it right\nyou can encourage\nremineralization how do you do that by\nkeeping the saliva healthy how do you do\nthat by supporting the proper bacteria\nwithin the mouth and making sure that\nyou're eliminating the bacteria that you\ndon't want or at least limiting those\nbacteria and today we're going to talk\nabout how to do that and by virtue of\ndoing all the things that support tooth\nHealth you're also going to support gum\nhealth okay those gums are critical\nbecause they form that barrier that if\nit gets too big if those Pockets those\nrecesses get too big and you're not\ntaking care of the bacteria in your\nmouth when you're not getting rid of the\nbad bacteria those bacteria worm their\nway down into the deeper recesses near\nthe roots of the tooth sometimes into\nthe tooth we'll talk about that and can\nget down into the bone and then can\ncause serious serious issues this is\nso-called perodontal disease and\nperodontal disease is associated with\nall sorts of really bad stuff including\nAlzheimer's okay this is not just some\nWellness culture woo science leap to\nalzheimer's there's literally evidence\nthat the specific bacterias that cause\nrecession of the gums can cross the\nblood brain barrier if they make it into\nthe general circulation and potentially\ncause Plax and Tangles some of the\nHallmark features of neural degeneration\nin Alzheimer's okay probably not the\nonly cause of Alzheimers but potentially\none of the major causes this is a new\nTheory but it's one that a lot of people\nare starting to pay attention to and\nit's also very clear that bacteria make\nit down into these deeper recesses near\nthe roots and into the bone that you can\nend up with issues related to cardiac\nhealth and certainly metabolic Health\nokay so again the goal today is not to\nscare you it's not to spend too much\ntime um on all the terrible things that\ncan happen but rather to emphasize the\npositive which is that if you do the\nright things at the right times\nespecially if you do them on a regular\nbasis that you can really improve the\nhealth of your total oral cavity and\nyour teeth and your breath and all the\nother stuff that people care about for\nAesthetics and interpersonal\ninteractions will flourish as well I'd\nlike to take a brief moment and thank\none of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens I started\ntaking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I\nstarted taking it and the reason I still\ntake it every day is that it ensures\nthat I meet all of my quotas for\nvitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are a number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in sufficient quantities so ag1\nallows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take just one\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports\nso many different systems within the\nbody that are involved in mental health\nphysical health and performance to try\nag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and\nyou'll get a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman okay let's talk about how\ncavities form because I think this is\nthe major question that people ask when\nasking about or thinking about oral\nhealth as I mentioned before cavities\nare literally holes they're\nfenestrations as the uh nerds call them\nnerds like me call them little\nfenestrations little holes down into the\nenamel that if they make it down to the\nDentin layer of the tooth most likely do\nneed to be drilled and filled and\npresumably build okay but your goal I\nthink all of our goal is to try and keep\nour teeth in a state of remineralization\nby keeping the pH that is the relative\nacid alkaline balance of the mouth such\nthat the saliva supports\nremineralization now let's think about\nhow a cavity actually forms turns out\nthat no specific food not even sugar\ncauses cavities cavities are not caused\nby sugar cavities are caused by bacteria\nthat feed on sugar and now that's not\njust a little bit of a Twist in the\nmechanism that's a critical point\nthere's no specific food not even pure\nsugar not even like a hard candy like a\ndelicious Jolly Rancher I used to like\nthose when I was a kid they get stuck in\nyour tooth that causes cavities no it's\nthe bacteria that feed on sugar that\nthen produce acid that burrows down\nthrough that degrades that demineralizes\nthe tooth in this very focal area that\nwe call a cavity okay now if that isn't\nsurprising enough get this the bacteria\nthat causes cavities by eating sugar and\nreleasing this acid while there are\nseveral of them the major one is called\nstreptococus mutans or what I'll call\nstrep mutans for short strep mutans is\nnot something you're born with it's\nactually a\ncommunicable bacteria that's right you\ngive it to one another through how\nsharing of glasses sharing of bottles\nkissing on the mouth Etc now I am not\nhere to tell you not not to do any of\nthose things I'm certainly not here to\ntell you that however and by the way in\nresearching this episode I did learn\nthat there is a specific category of\nperson out there typically they are a\ndentist or married to a dentist that\nhave opted believe it or not to never\nkiss their children near or on the mouth\nso as to help their children not get\nstreptococus mutans because almost all\nadults carry it not all but it's\ncommunicable like a STI or like a flu or\nlike a it's communicated between\nindividuals we are not born with it now\nthat's a whole area of U let's just call\nit\nbiosocial ethics decision-making that I\nthink most people are not going to be\ntoo concerned with or at least act on\nbecause let's face it most people are\nnot going to change their overall\nbehavior of kissing or usage of bottles\nor glasses in order to avoid getting\nstrep mutans most people in the world\nhave strep mutans or will get strep\nmutans and it lives in the mouth okay it\njust resides there strep mutans is there\nand it's hungry what's it hungry for\nsugar when there's sugar present it eats\nit it produces acid the acid produces\ncavities taking teeth from a state of\nremineralization to demineralization or\nand by the way this is really important\nif your mouth is already in a state\nthat's more\ndemineralization mode so to speak well\nthen it will capitalize on that and it\nwill cause cavities much faster okay so\nkeep in mind that acidity is bad for the\nmouth does that mean that you should\nnever consume a lemon or and by the way\nyes I'm guilty of everyone a while chew\na lemon slice or drinking water with\nlemon in it or carbonated drinks or\nsodas or tea or anything that has acidic\nflavor no likewise should you completely\navoid ingesting any kind of sugar\nbecause strep mutans love sugar no turns\nout strep mutans like sugars in the form\nof complex carbohydrate sugars too so if\nyou eat pasta or rice or oatmeal and\nsome bread every once in a while as I do\nI'm an omnivore I eat meat and fish and\neggs and also starches and vegetables\nand fruits I'm an omnivore as most\npeople are well then strep mutans has an\nopportunity to eat the sugars that come\nfrom those other carbohydrates does that\nmean that if you were to have a zero\ncarbohydrate diet no sugars no starches\nEtc you would reduce the opportunity for\nstrep mutans to consume sugar and\nrelease acid maybe maybe however most\npeople won't do that and strep mutans is\na very clever maybe even diabolical\nbacteria and if you are on a zero\ncarbohydrate zero sugar diet there's\nsome evidence that strep mutans will\nfigure out ways to feed on other\ncomponents of food in order to create\nthis acid to then create cavities in\nyour teeth so the key thing to\nunderstand here is that cavities form\nform not from foods not from sugars per\nse but from strep mutans and other\nbacteria that eat those sugars and\ncreate acid hence the critical need to\nkeep your mouth as alkaline as possible\nwhich does not mean that you can never\ndrink some lemon water or coffee or tea\nhere's the key point that everyone needs\nto remember because this dovetails\nbeautifully into how often you should\nbrush and floss and when you should\nbrush and floss specifically the key\npoint is the degree to which your mouth\nis in a demon state or a remin state and\nthe degree to which cavities have the\nopportunity to form is dependent on the\namount of time the amount of time in\nwhich your mouth is net acidic or net\nalkaline the amount of time that you are\nin a\ndemineralization mode or\nremineralization mode okay so it's the\namount of time no one no one can avoid\nhaving their mouth be acidic every once\nin a while or ingesting a sugar or a\nfood that strep mut mutans can feed on\nand produce acid the key is to try and\nreduce the amount of strep mutans and\nreduce the amount of acid in the mouth\nthat's the best way to reduce cavities\nand even reverse cavities that have\nstarted to form now in a moment I'm\ngoing to tell you about fluoride because\nI know there are a lot of questions\nabout fluoride but in order for you to\nunderstand what I say about fluoride and\nto make the best decision about fluoride\nboth in drinking water and toothpaste\netc for you you have to understand the\nremineralization process just a little\nbit just a little bit so a little bit of\nchemistry here a little bit of\nstructural biology and this will be fun\nI promise even if you know no biology no\nstructural biology no chemistry you're\ngoing to like this part and it's very\nsimple those minerals that form the\ncrystals within the enamel and some of\nthe deeper layers of your tooth or teeth\nrather those crystals form through a\nspecific type of bond and those bonds\nare very strong think of them like Lego\nchains but these are not you know just\nconventional Lego chains these are Lego\nchains that when they stick when two\npieces come together things are tough to\npull apart they're not indestructible\nbut they're tough to pull apart and\nthey're also special because unlike a\nstring of Legos like a single string of\nLegos these bonds that form during\nremineralization of the teeth are\ninterdigitated with one another or\nrather are at angles with one another\nthat make those bonds especially strong\nany architect or somebody that\nunderstands structural biology will\nunderstand that bonds can be weak or\nstrong depending on whether or not\nthey're linear whether or not they're\ncrossed whether or not and lates there's\na whole bunch of interesting you know\nangled forces stuff that the Architects\nwill understand and the the construction\nworkers will understand at a very\nintuitive and and concrete level no pun\nintended and on and on but just think\nabout it a bond is only as strong as the\nnumber of different points at which it\ncan resist shearing and pressure so the\nway that these re remineralization bonds\nform is through the addition of specific\nminerals at specific angles and the\nnaturally occurring mineral mineral\nthat's responsible for the majority of\nthese Bonds in the enamel and teeth is\ncalled hydroxy appetite what a great\nname if you're talking about oral health\nright because we use the mouth for a lot\nof things you can think of the small\nlist or long list of those things there\nare many of them you know depending on\nwho you are and what you like to do with\nyour mouth but the point being that we\ndo indeed eat with our mouth appetite is\npart of eating so you just remember\nhydroxy appetite bonds and they are very\nstrong but they're not indestructible\nacid can actually break those bonds okay\nthat's the mineralization process now\nfluoride is a substance that is not a\nvitamin it's not a mineral it is not an\nessential nutrient but that in the last\ncentury it was discovered can actually\nreplace some of the hydroxyapatite bonds\nin teeth and actually make those bonds\nhyper strong super physiologically\nstrong now we'll talk about the safety\nconsiderations with fluoride in a little\nbit because there are some safety\nconsiderations but it was decided in\nMass in the United States and Europe\nthat the addition of fluoride to the\ndrinking water and to many toothpastes\nor tooth powders would be useful because\nit creates these super physiologically\nstrong bonds within the minerals of the\nteeth and indeed it does it does\nfluoride gets between those Lego pieces\nand makes them extra extra strong and\nthis is why fluoride is added to the\ndrinking water but and this is very\nimportant to emphasize but nowadays\nthere's a really polarized debate about\nfluoride because some people out there\nbelieve that fluoride can disrupt\nthyroid Health might be disruptive for\nbrain health certainly if fluoride\nlevels are too high in drinking water or\nany substance it can be very dangerous\nit can be a poison but of course the\ndose makes the poison right fluoride\nitself may not be poisonous at very low\nlevels but there really two camps now\nthat have formed and I'll just\nillustrate those two camps by virtue of\nwhat's happening right now right now in\nthe state of California there is a major\nlawsuit against the government because\npeople want fluoride removed from the\ndrinking water because of the long list\nof bad things that excessive I want to\nhighlight excessive fluoride can do for\nbodily and brain health especially in\nkids but also in adults at the very same\ntime meaning right now there is also a\nmajor lawsuit this one in Buffalo New\nYork from Mostly parents who are suing\nthe City of Buffalo saying that there\nwas not enough maybe even zero fluoride\nin the drinking water for some period of\ntime and as a consequence their\nchildren's teeth or oral health or both\nis depleted and they are suing for\ndamages okay so there this is a really\npolarized camp now I did a full episode\nof The hubman Lab podcast all about\nwater and I talked about fluoride levels\nwhich levels are thought by the CDC to\nbe safe which levels are not thought to\nbe safe I talked about some of the\ntheories as to how fluoride might\ndisrupt function of the thyroid and some\nconsiderations there please check out\nthe time stamp in that episode I link to\nthat time stamp in the caption for this\nepisode but the important Point here is\nthat if you are at all concerned about\nfluoride in the drinking water the\nsimple answer is to just filter the\nwater that comes out of the tap if\nyou're concerned about fluoride then I\nsuppose you'd probably want to avoid\ntoothpastes that have fluoride indeed\nthere are some I will provide links to\nsome of those in the show note captions\nfor this episode there are a variety of\nthese zero fluoride toothpaste that have\nstarted to accumulate but keep in mind\nthat when fluoride is introduced into\nthe bonds of the mineral of the teeth\nthey do make the teeth really really\nstrong but and all the dentists I spoke\nto emphasize this point the bonds that\nform are not the natural bonds now the\nfact that they're not the natural bonds\ndoesn't necessarily mean that they\naren't good for us or that they're bad\nfor us but the bonds that form when\nviewed under what's called electron\nmicroscopy look different they look wavy\nthey're not smooth bonds and they do\nincrease the so resistance to different\nforces including cavities or acid that\nwould create cavities to be specific\nthey make the teeth stronger\nstructurally so resistance to chipping\nEtc but there is a growing concern about\nexcessive fluoride which by the way if\nyou drink a lot of tap water you're\ngoing to be exposed to more fluoride\nthan if you drink less tap water that's\njust kind of stands to reason but people\ndon't really talk about this right when\nyou talk about x amount of fluoride by\nconcentration in a given liter of water\nor gallon of water you also have to ask\nwell how much tap water are you drinking\nevery day okay you have to ask that\nquestion right it's not simply the\nconcentration it's how much you're Ines\noverall and that's something that's much\nharder to control for again in the water\nepisode I talk about ways to eliminate\nor reduce fluoride in the drinking water\nif that's a concern of yours but if you\nwant to know why there's fluoride in\ndrinking water it's because government's\nfigured out hey well if we want to\nreduce tooth decay what's the simplest\nlowcost method to do that well it's to\nput fluoride in the drinking water and\nyou now also now know why there's\nfluoride in a lot of toothpaste but\ngiven the concerns about thyroid Health\npotential concerns about brain health\nnow you also know why many people\nincluding some dentists that I spoke to\nare not big fans of fluoride both for\nchildren and for adults so you just have\nto make a decision for you I'm not here\nto tell you what to do you just have to\ndecide are you Pro neutral or against\nfluoride in you're drinking water and if\nso are you going to filter are you going\nto completely avoid drinking any water\nmaybe even cooking with any water from\nthe T and on and on but now you know why\nfluoride is in drinking water and\nfluoride is in toothpaste if you're\nsomebody who's concerned about fluoride\nin either or both of those sources well\nthen what you really want to think about\nand what most of us probably should be\nthinking about anyway is trying to\nincrease the remineralization state of\nour teeth and mouth in ways that don't\ncreate the opportunity for any other\nhealth hazard and I will say this as\nwell which is that there's some data not\na lot but some data that fluoride might\nnot be so great for our oral microbiome\nand as we'll soon learn the oral\nmicrobiome is critical for our oral and\noverall all Health I'd like to take a\nquick break and thank our sponsor insid\ntracker insid tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals now I've long\nbeen a believer in getting regular blood\nwork done for the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact your\nimmediate and long-term Health can only\nbe analyzed from a quality blood test a\nmajor problem with a lot of blood tests\nout there however is that you get\ninformation back about metabolic factors\nlipids and hormones and so forth but you\ndon't know what to do with that\ninformation with insid tracker they make\nit very easy because they have a\npersonalized platform that allows you to\nsee the levels of all those things\nmetabolic factors lipids hormones Etc\nbut it gives you specific directives\nthat you can follow that relate to\nnutrition behavioral modifications\nsupplements Etc that can help you bring\nthose numbers into the ranges that are\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninside tracker you can go to insid\ntracker.com huberman to get 20% off any\nof insid tracker's plans again that's\ninside\ntracker.com huberman so in a moment we\nare going to get into what to do the\nto-dos the behavioral to-dos and some of\nthe other to-dos for trying to keep your\nmouth in the best possible\nremineralization State the best pH for\ntooth health for gum health for avoiding\nperiodontal disease maybe even for\nreversing some aspects of tooth and\nperiodontal sickness because indeed you\ncan do that if you shift your mouth to\nthe correct pH if you're putting it into\nthat remineralization mode okay however\nbefore we get into the todos I think\nit's very important to discuss the do\nNots that every dentist and periodontist\nI spoke to agreed\non the Quick List as I'll call it of bad\nfor your teeth bad for your mouth and\ntherefore bad for your brain and body\nare not surprisingly perhaps alcohol\nwhich by the way I did an entire episode\nabout alcohol it's one of our more\npopular episodes I'm not here to tell\nyou to never drink if you're an adult\nwho's not- alcoholic but the cut off\nseems to be two alcohol based drinks per\nweek Beyond which you run into trouble\nand yes zero is better than any but here\nwhen we say alcohol is not good for oral\nhealth and for tooth Health what we're\ntalking about is the disruption that\nalcohol creates to the microbiome and\nthe way that it Alters the pH of your\nsaliva and places the mouth and the\nteeth into a demineralization state\nthat's very clear it also kills certain\ncells of the mouth some people I\nremember this in college would say oh\nyou know if you've got a you know you've\ngot a like scratch in the back of your\nthroat you're getting sick you know you\nshould drink and that's what they said\nyou should drink it's going to kill that\nthing off well guess what it does the\nexact opposite it kills off a bunch of\nthings that you want like the cells in\nand around the mucosal layer of the\nmouth that are actually going to provide\nimmune support and eliminate those\nbacteria or viruses uh that are making\nyou sick Etc so alcohol is bad I'm not\nsaying you shouldn't drink at all if\nyou're a non-alcohol adult you have to\ndecide for you but just understand that\nif you're drinking alcohol that you want\nto pay extra attention to your oral\nhealth and your tooth care practices\nespecially on the days around that\nalcohol consumption and if you're\nsomebody who doesn't want to drink\nalcohol now you have yet another reason\nto not drink\nalcohol the second thing on the no fly\nlist or the not good for us list for\nsake of oral health are stimulants now\nof course things like methamphetamine\nwhich are you know severely dilus\naddictive drugs for all sorts of reasons\nthey kill dopaminergic and other brain\nneurons they are highly addictive um and\non and on but also stimulants like\nadderal viance etc those stimulants\nbasically any drug that increases\nepinephrine and norepinephrine so called\nadrenaline and noradrenaline are the\nother names for those are going to have\na negative effect on oral health does\nthat mean you should stop those\nmedications if you've been prescribed\nthem no it means that you should do some\nother things to try and offset the\nnegative consequence of stimulants why\nwould stimulants cause such disruption\nin oral health well there are really two\nreasons there's a chemical reason and\nthere's a mechanical\nreason the chemical reason is that\nstimulants change the pH of your saliva\nmaking the mouth more acidic which makes\nstrep mutans and other bacteria more\ncapable of creating cavities down into\nthe teeth they take your mouth and your\nteeth from that remineralization state\nor I've been referring to it mode to\nthat demineralization demon mode demon\nmode that's a way to remember it's bad\ndemon mode demon mode not good maybe in\na video game demon mode is good Demon\nmode not good for the mouth demon mode\ndemineralization mode so there's a\nchemical reason why stimulants disrupt\nthe oral health milu and cause\ndisruption in tooth health and\ndegradation demon of the enamel of the\nteeth and deeper layers of the teeth and\nthis is profoundly evident in meth\nbut the other reason and this was a\nreason that was shared with me by a\nphysician an MD from University of\nCalifornia San Francisco who interacts\nby virtue of his profession with a lot\nof Methamphetamine\naddicts who have terrible teeth is that\nstimulants encourage mouth breathing\nwatch a meth addict or watch somebody\nwho's on a high dose of stimulant and\nthey tend to mouth breathe because of\nthe shifts in autonomic nervous system\nfunction they tend to be mouth breathers\nso it's the drying of the mouth that\nalso shifts the mouth from that\nremineralization mode to\ndemineralization mode so if you do take\nstimulants by prescription I would hope\nnot methamphetamine or elicit drugs but\nif you take prescription stimulants and\nby the way things like Wellbutrin\nmodafanil they do qualify as stimulants\neven though modaal is a little bit of a\nspecial case any drug that increases\nnorepinephrine epinephrine any stimulant\nand yes indeed coffee we'll talk about\ncoffee as well and tea will make the\nsaliva more acidic and make your oral\nhealth po potentially less good mouth\nbreathing bad for oral health bad for\nteeth bad bad bad there's just no\nquestion about it so today's discussion\nI'm calling oral health but that\nincludes oral Airway health and I've\ntalked before on this podcast about the\nfact that if you can be a nasal breather\nbe a nasal breather please as long as\nyou're not speaking as long as you're\nnot eating try and breathe through your\nnose if you're exercising and exercising\nreally hard like you're running really\nhard fine mouth breathe I don't think\nthere's any evidence that staying in\nnasal breathing mode all the time while\nexercising is best for performance in\nfact to the contrary there are times\nwhen you need to mouth breathe and\nthere's Sports where you need to Exhale\nthrough the mouth specifically certain\nmartial arts for instance so not saying\ndon't ever breathe through your mouth\nbut as much as possible try and keep the\noral cavity moist and closed okay this\nis critical so stimulants dry out the\nmouth they increase the acidity of the\nsaliva that's bad smoking cigarettes and\nyes also cannabis and yes vaping does\nthis too it's so funny anytime I talk\nabout smoking being bad people like well\nwhat about cannabis well I didn't\nepisode about cannabis cannabis does\nhave certain medical uses that are very\ninteresting and um there's good evidence\nfor those but for many people cannabis\nis not a good idea you can check out\nthat episode to decide for you then\npeople ask what about vaping vaping is\nnot as bad as smoking right that's what\nthey say where they're sort of asking\nsaying hoping wishing fantasizing and\nthe truth is that vaping is terrible for\nyour oral health as well is it as bad as\nsmoking probably not but it's bad for a\nbunch of other reasons that offset any\ngain or gains you would get from vaping\ninstead of smoking so just know that if\nyou're a smoker or a vapor or if you\nvape rather that you're going to want to\npay extra attention to some of the other\nprotocols discussed and that we will\ndiscuss going forward in order to try\nand support your oral and therefore your\nwhole body Health Okay so we've got\nalcohol stimulant smoking SL vaping and\nby extension dipping tobacco frankly not\ngood for oral health or tooth Health in\nfact they can be proc cancerous to the\ngum tissue it's well established and\nthey can also cause degradation of the\ngum tissue and even some of the\nunderlying bone if you tend to do it on\nthe same side all the time or often at\nall so that's not good we already\ndiscussed that sugar is not good for\noral health does that mean you can never\ningest sugar no of course not enjoy the\nsweets you enjoy every once in a while\nenjoy a nice pastry um you know do as\nyou will um if you're somebody who never\neats those things great but then\nunderstand that any carbohydrate any\nstarch provides a sugar that strep\nmutans can eat and create acid and\ndemineralize your teeth create cavities\nthat is so avoid sugar in excess and if\nyou eat sugar try and rinse your mouth\nafter and ideally you would brush maybe\neven floss after okay I do know those\npeople that after every meal they run\neven in the middle of the day they run\nto the bathroom and brush their teeth\nand floss and that's great but most\npeople don't do that so swishing water\nrinsing your mouth out again plain water\nmaybe with a little bit of salt in it is\ngoing to be beneficial we'll talk about\nmouthwash es later just to give you a\nlittle window into where we're headed\nwith that most\nmouthwashes terrible terrible for your\noral health especially alcohol-based or\nantiseptic based mouthwashes except\nunder certain conditions prescribed or\notherwise okay so if you eat any sugar\nand frankly after you eat anything it's\na good idea to try and clear as much of\nthat food product from your mouth you\nmay not think you still have food in\nyour mouth and teeth but trying to you\nknow swish some water maybe spit it out\nmaybe swallow it that's up to you are\nyou a spit or swallow not my business\ndon't want to don't tell me don't put it\nin the comments just decide for\nyou but sugar and other food products\nresiding in the mouth for long periods\nof time not good and similarly acidity\nfoods that are acidic so certain things\nlike citrus fruits which I love I love\noranges I have an orange tree in my\nbackyard now and I absolutely love it I\nlove oranges grapefruit I just I love\nthe peel I even eat the peel sometimes\nit's so\ndelicious and no one's telling you not\nto eat acidic Foods or to avoid atic\ndrinks like lemon water or carbonated\nlemon water some people are really\nextreme and they decide to just use a\nstraw when they drink those things in\nfact the dentist I spoke to said yes\ncould you ask people please if they're\ngoing to drink acidic drinks to try and\nuse a straw but then I said well you\nknow a lot of straws they disrupt the\nenvironment most people aren't carrying\naround metal straws or you know and what\nabout the turtles this kind of thing and\nthey said well okay here's the real\ntruth the real truth is it's the amount\nof time that the mouth is exposed to\nthat acid so if they're going to drink\nit drink it over the course of 10 15\nmaybe 20 30 minutes and then be done\nwith it rinse out the mouth with a\nlittle bit of water and try and clear\nout that acidity it's not about\ncompletely avoiding acid foods or sugary\nFoods or acidic drinks it's about again\nlimiting the amount of time that the\noverall milu of the mouth is acidic\nbecause of this whole demon remen thing\nstrep mutans and the acid created by\nstrep mutans that can derode the teeth\nand the fact that if your mouth is kept\nacidic for long periods of time you're\ngoing to provide the opportunity for\nfaster and deeper development of those\ncavities and keep this in mind again\nanytime we talk about demineralization\nthe formation of cavities remember it's\nlike a seesaw it's either demon or reman\nbut not both so anytime you're\ndemineralizing your teeth you're also\nnot remineralizing your teeth okay so\nreally avoid alcohol stimulants smoking\nvaping sugar mouth breathing acidic\nFoods acidic drinks but many of us most\nof us can't avoid any sugars any acidic\nFoods the other things can be avoided\nbut some of us are prescribed these\ndrugs and need these drugs some people\nlike a drink with alcohol in it every\nonce in a while and it's perfectly fine\nfor them or they've deemed it perfectly\nfine for them in that case try and rinse\nthe mouth try and keep the milu of the\nmouth as moist and as basic or alkaline\nrather less acidic as possible so to\ntranslate this a bit more to the real\nworld if you're somebody like me who\nloves tea I drink cold brew zero sugar y\nbate that's my favorite source of\ncaffeine I also like a nice black double\nespresso or coffee every once in a while\nit's fine to drink that but you don't\nwant to sip on those sorts of things all\nday and you don't want to sip on them\nfor hours and hours and if you're going\nto combine those things with some acidic\nFoods or with any kind of food you know\ntry and get your meals done wrap them up\nand rinse your mouth and move to the\nnext part of your day and that actually\nSegways into a really important point\nthat came about when researching this\nepisode that if I had to highlight bold\nface underline and light up one\nparticular protocol that I think most\neverybody is not thinking about is that\nthere are certain times in the 24-hour\ncircadian period in which your mouth\nmakes the maximum amount of\nsaliva okay and that the saliva has an\nopportunity to be the optimal pH that is\nchemistry for encouraging\nremineralization of your teeth and\nthat's during the daytime and especially\nthrough the middle of the day now there\nare a couple things that can disrupt\nthat for instance eating anything I\ndon't care if you're carnivore or vegan\nwhatever omnivore when you eat you\nchange the pH of your saliva and you're\nintroducing those sugars that the\nbacteria can feed on so one thing that\nbecame very clear to me when researching\nthis episode talking to experts reading\nmanuscripts and also reading some really\ninteresting books about\nremineralization opportunities for the\nteeth is that having a stretch of time\nof maybe two four six hours or more\nwhere you're not eating anything or\ningesting anything that's acidic in\nterms of liquids can be very beneficial\nnow this is a vote in support of\nso-called intermittent fasting this is\nsomething that I practice typically by\neating my first meal somewhere around\n11:00 a.m. every morning sometimes\nearlier sometimes have a little\nbreakfast at 9:00 if I particularly\nhungry but typically I eat my first meal\naround 11:00 a.m. or noon and then I eat\nmy last bite of food by about 8:00 p.m.\nnot Everyone likes to do intermittent\nfasting and I realize for sake of weight\nloss it's probably interchangeable with\ncaloric restriction generally and\nthere's a lot of debate as to whether or\nnot intermittent fasting is going to\nextend lifespan whether or not it's\nbetter for metabolic Health than simple\ncaloric restriction I don't want to get\ninto that debate frankly it's a barbed\nwire debate that's been carried out on\nthis podcast and elsewhere before and I\nthink this is ongoing I think it's the\nthe best way to couch that debate but in\nresearching this episode it became very\nclear that we have an amazing\nopportunity during the day especially in\nthe morning and throughout the day to\ncreate a lot of saliva that's the right\npH to support remineralization of the\nteeth provided that there isn't a lot of\nfood or acidic liquids in the mouth at\nthat time so at least to my mind this is\nan interesting opportunity to place\nintermittent fasting which again or even\njust gaps between meals not constantly\nsnacking or sipping on acidic beverages\nthroughout the day as an opportunity to\ncreate that healthy milu during which\nthe teeth can remineralize and the\noverall oral health can improve\nnow does that mean you should never eat\nor drink anything during the middle of\nthe day no I'm not saying that I'm\nsaying that if you're going to do those\nthings try and clear them from your\nmouth as I described\nbefore now many of you will probably say\nhey during the middle of the night I'm\nnot eating or drinking anything for some\nof you that might be the only time that\nyou're not eating or drinking anything\nbecause you're asleep one would hope\nyou're\nasleep but here's the interesting thing\nevery cell tissue and organ in our body\nis on a 24-hour circadian clock I think\nmany of you have heard heard me say that\nin the context of viewing morning\nsunlight and other protocols that I you\nknow suggest on the huberman loud\npodcast but here's the interesting and\nimportant point in the middle of the\nnight indeed you're not ingesting any\nfood or fluids presumably but your\nsaliva production is dramatically\nreduced again dramatically reduced and\nas a consequence if there's food or\nrather food opportunity for strep mutans\nand other bacteria to feed on and create\na to erode your teeth the saliva\nnecessary to offset that to combat that\nis simply not present or at least not\npresent at the same levels that it is\nduring the day so this is a sort of\ntwo-prong protocol on the one hand I'm\nsaying you might consider trying to\nintroduce maybe an hour or two hour or\nlonger stretches during the day in which\nyou're not ingesting any food and if\nyou're drinking anything it's not acidic\nor if you are to try and rinse away that\nacid as much as possible so PL water\nwould be great avoiding carbonated lemon\nwater would be great but if you like\nthose things and indeed I love those\nthings I love carbonated lemon water I\nlove things like yamat indeed the yate I\nlike is cobw zero sugar but has some\nlemon and ginger in it okay that's\nfairly acidic but then drinking it down\neither pretty quickly or if you're going\nto sip on it then rinsing it away with\nsome water and not doing that throughout\nthe entire day and indeed I tend to\ndrink my caffeine early in the day and\nnot so much throughout the day maybe a\nlittle bit of mate in the afternoon\nsometimes okay so that's one aspect of\nmaintaining or encouraging the correct\npH of saliva to remineralize your teeth\nright create these windows of\nopportunity where there's a lot of\nsaliva for long stretches of time during\nthe day as long as possible while still\nmaking it compatible with your nutrition\nneeds and your hydration needs of course\nthe other prong or the other aspect of\nthis protocol is that at night when you\ngo to sleep you need to know you're not\nproducing very much saliva and that's\nthe critical time to make sure that\nthere is as little opportunity is\npossible for strep mutans and other\nbacteria to feed on sugars or other food\nproducts and thereby to create acid that\ncreates cavities and so this is a very\nimportant protocol that every single\ndental and oral health care professional\nI spoke to supported and indeed\nChampions which is if there is a most\ncritical time of day or night to brush\nyour teeth and floss and clean your\nteeth it's at nighttime it's at\nnighttime why am I saying this with such\nwhispered importance well I think there\nare many people out there in particular\npeople that fall into that second\ncategory that I mentioned at the\nbeginning of today's episode that wake\nup in the morning and brush their teeth\nmaybe even use\nmouthwash maybe floss and do a bunch of\nthings to try and get their mouth clean\nand fresh especially if they're going to\ninteract with other people during the\nday and to get rid of all the kind of\nstickiness and you know mouth you know\nmorning breath that kind of thing but\nthat at night they're finishing dinner\nmaybe having some dessert doing some\nwork and passing out without brushing\ntheir teeth or flossing or simply\ngetting too lazy to brush or floss and\nby the way I'm going to raise my hand\nand just say for many years I was in\nthat category I know ew gross but I was\nin that category I had high motivation\nto brush in floss or at least a brush in\nthe morning very little motivation to do\nit in the evening every professional\nsaid if you're going to brush and floss\njust once per 24 hours and that is not\nwhat they recommend by the way but if\nyou were going to do it just once the\ncritical time the most essential time to\nbrush and floss and clean the mouth and\nget the millu of the mouth correct for\ntooth care and mouth overall oral health\nis at night before you go to sleep\nbecause you already know the mechanistic\nbackbone for this argument because at\nnight you're producing far less saliva\nand if there's any food product there\nthat the bacteria can feed on the saliva\nisn't there to combat that because it's\na constant battle between acidity and\nalkalinity your saliva is coming in\ntrying to save everything and the strep\nmutans is trying to destroy your teeth\nand the acid is the Weaponry they use\nand what fuels that Weaponry what\nprovides them more ammo to destroy your\nteeth are sugars and acidity so if you\nwere going to brush your floss and\nideally you do both only once per 24\nhours it would be at night before going\nto sleep indeed so much so that I would\nsay that nighttime brushing and flossing\nis perhaps one of the most important\nthings that we could do for overall oral\nhealth care we'll talk about what to do\nwhat to use for brushing and flossing in\na few minutes but that's absolutely\nessential I do not want that to be\ntranslated into you only need to brush\nor brush and floss once per 24 hours\nevery professional I spoke to and all of\nthe data point to the fact that doing it\ntwice per 24 hours is best or perhaps\neven three times per 24 hours but let's\nbe honest most people are not going to\nbrush and floss three times every 24\nhours some will but most won't and now\nof course I've been saying brushing and\nflossing but I haven't talked about the\nincredibly extensive landscape of how to\nbrush and floss so now let's take\nourselves back to being little kids\nright when we were taught to brush our\nteeth in a particular way you know\nyou're supposed to spend a certain\nnumber of minutes set a timer supposed\nto floss in a certain way every time we\ngo to the dentist they tell us to floss\nin a certain way do this not this what\ndo the data really say what are the\nmodern health professionals in dental\nand oral health really suggest in we do\nwhen it comes to brushing and flossing\nand fortunately here there's a near\nuniform consensus there's always that\noutlier that person that says to do\nthings a little bit differently or no\nthere's in fact one person very\nprominent in the dental health space\nthat is not a fan of flossing but they\nare really the outlier the vast majority\nof dentists out there all say the same\nthing you need to brush you need to\nfloss you need to do it twice a day or\nmore and you need to do it correctly so\nnow let's talk about what Cor correct\nbrushing and flossing really is okay so\nI'm not going to demonstrate how to\nbrush your teeth but one very actionable\nprotocol that was told to me by all the\ndental professionals I spoke to was use\na soft toothbrush now this one hurts or\nI suppose hurts less anyway it hurts my\nheart a little bit because I enjoy very\nmuch using a medium or hard toothbrush\nand really like scrubbing back there\nespecially in the teeth in the back it\njust feels good I feel like I'm doing\nsomething good I get into the backs of\nthe teeth the fronts of the teeth I know\nI actually enjoy brushing my teeth\nespecially lately don't ask me why but I\ndo but every single one of them said\nthat that very vigorous brushing with\nmedium or hard as they're called\nbristles really disrupts the interface\nbetween the teeth and the gums in ways\nThat's not healthy for the gums and\nactually makes tenting of the gums and\nthose Pockets those recesses as they're\ncalled far more likely to form and every\nsingle one of them said if you are\nregular with your brushing and\nespecially if you're brushing and\nflossing regularly that a soft\ntoothbrush that is one that's moved in a\ncircular motion on the fronts and backs\nof your teeth for all your teeth and\nthat is gentle you're not providing a\nlot of pressure is going to be the best\nway to break up that bofilm layer each\nand every time and promote the best\ntooth and overall oral health so I\nsuppose um manufacturers who are making\nmedium and hard toothbrushes maybe give\nus some w rationale for that um you know\nbecause the dental professionals that I\nspoke to and again I spoke to a fair\nnumber of them all said the same thing\nsoft toothbrush Notch just better soft\ntoothbrush best likewise if you use an\nelectric toothbrush which I now do\nsometimes I switch back and forth but if\nyou use an electric toothbrush it was\nrecommended that you not provide too\nmuch pressure that you really try and\nkeep the tips of the bristles on the the\nteeth and gums and yes it was also\nsuggested that people brush their gums\nthis is interesting for people out there\nwho have tooth sensitivity one of the\nmajor suggestions from people in the\ndental and perodontal field at least the\nones I spoke to was to actually brush\nyour gums lightly to increase\ncirculation of blood and other nutrients\nto the deeper portions of the tooth that\nactually extend into the bone now there\nis a tremendous amount of blood flow to\nthe gums anyone who's um you know sort\nof nicked their uh gum with a while\nwhile flossing or with a toothpick can\ntell you bleeds very readily and that's\nnot a good thing right you don't want to\ncreate bleeding of the gums we'll talk\nabout bleeding of the gums during\nflossing in a moment by the way so don't\njump the gun just yet I said jump the\ngun not jump the gum by the way if you\nare brushing your gums make sure you're\nusing a soft toothbrush if you're using\nelectric toothbrush make sure you're\ngoing very lightly on the gums and\nbecause there's so much blood flow to\nthe gums it does encourage a lot of\ncirculation to some of the deeper\ncavities of the tooth as it turns out I\ndon't want to reverse to tooth anatomy\nin any kind of detailed way now but of\ncourse within the tooth you have again\nenamel you have the Dentin you've got\nWhat's called the the pulp or the center\nthere's a lot of nerves inating the\ncenter of the tooth there's a bunch of\nother tissues and and the bone around it\nand layers Etc and when you massage or\nlightly brush the gums around there\nyou're encouraging a lot of blood flow\nto those deeper components of the tooth\nwhich are really the live and active\ncomponents of the tooth that require\nblood flow and nutrients so this is a\ngood thing in fact it's probably such a\ngood thing that most people perhaps all\nof us should do it but most people\nprobably won't take the time to also\nbrush their gums but if you have a\nlittle bit of time it can be beneficial\nespecially if you have sensitive teeth\nthe idea that's of emerging now in the\ndental field is that it can help promote\nresilience or less sensitivity of the\nteeth to things like hot and cold and\nmaybe even to pressure so before we talk\nabout flossing I just want to\nreemphasize that the reason to brush\nyour teeth and the reason to brush your\nteeth lightly or without too much\npressure that is is that if you're\nregular with your toothbrushing and\nflossing the main goal of brushing is to\nbreak up the biofilm layer that provides\na substrate for strep mutans and other\nbacteria to layer on thicker layers of\nbacteria so-called plaque that will\neventually turn to Tarter okay if we\nreally want to gross ourselves out and\nreally motivate brushing and flossing\nmaybe we should describe that what\nhappens with strep mutans is it forms\nthese strand-like bacteria so these are\nlike little Celia so they're attached to\nthe tooth is the bofilm layer so like\nlittle strands of strings but if enough\nof it accumulates and it gets thicker\nand kind of Mossy it's kind of like you\nknow thicker it looks kind of sponge\nform and that's the plaque and then if\nenough of it forms and there's enough\nacidity in the mouth then it forms\ntartter which is the hard caked on stuff\nthat requires scraping off by the\ndentist you know and some people get a\nlot of tartar some people have less\nTarter buildup depending on how diligent\nthey are at removing the bofilm with\nbrushing now you can remove biofilm and\nplaque with brushing but once it starts\nto form tarar that is once it's layered\non sometimes it has a yellowish tint to\nit then you really start to run into\ntrouble because brushing and flossing\nwill not remove that tarar and that's\nwhy the dentist needs to get in there\nand scrape it away so it's ideal to be\ndiligent about removing the bacteria\nwhile it's still in that strand or\nplaque form ideally within this when\nit's still in that strand form removing\nthat bofilm if you've ever been to the\ndentist you may recall they'll do this\ntooth polishing you know they'll do that\nthing the kind of gritty stuff on your\nteeth and you wonder um you know is this\nto make my teeth whiter and indeed it\ncan create a bit more shine or Sheen to\nuh your teeth but the main reason for\ndoing that it turns out is to make the\nsurfaces of your teeth smooth after all\nthey do it on your backs your your teeth\ntoo right if they're good dentist they\ndo on the backs of your teeth as well\nwhy would they do it there it can't be\nfor cosmetic purposes well they do that\nbecause the smooth surface makes it\nharder for those strands that bofilm to\nstick and form and certainly for the\nmore dense plaque and Tarter layers to\nbuild up on top of it so they're making\nyour teeth smooth so that the the\nbacteria can't adhere to it as readily\nbut it's the daily Protocols of tooth\nand oral health that are really critical\nwe'll talk about dental visits and\nfrequency of dental visits and what a\ndental visit is really about is it\nalways about cleaning or filling Etc but\nin the\nmeantime brushing and brushing often\nenough such that you don't get any\nbuildup of bofilm for very long periods\nof time a eliminating or reducing the\namount of plaque and tartter that builds\nup is going to be your best strategy for\nimproving tooth Health now what about\nflossing there's a little bit of debate\nabout flossing in the Dentistry field\nsome people say if your gums bleed when\nyou floss you need to floss more in fact\nmost dentists I spoke to said that but\nthey also emphasize that you need to\nfloss correctly you can't just pull the\nfloss down onto the gum in between the\ntooth you need to Glide down the side of\nthe tooth get a little bit underneath\nthe gum and use a circular motion and\nthen lift up from between the two teeth\nwhich frankly is a lot easier if your\nteeth aren't very very close together\nright some of us have teeth that are\nvery close together and when you try and\nbring it up through the teeth it's more\nof an effort okay but they really all\nemphasize trying to not drop this you\nknow rather sharp floss and the you know\nhere we could also be talking about the\ntooth pick based floss where there's a\nlittle Arc with a with a a little bit of\nfloss across from it the ones that you\ncan buy some people actually use\ntoothpicks they're old fashion method um\nfrankly most dentists I spoke to don't\nwant people jabbing their mouth and gums\nwith toothpicks you can decide for\nyourself but almost all of them except\nfor one felt that flossing is a great\nidea for tooth health and that if your\ngums bleed when you floss correctly as I\njust described what correct flossing is\nthat you\nbest strategy is to floss at least twice\na day between all of your teeth and if\nyou're not going to floss twice a day\nfor whatever reason in protest or for\nlack of time at least once a day and\nwhen would that once a day be it would\nbe at night before going to sleep for\nthe reasons we talked about earlier and\nseveral dentists I spoke to said that\nusing a water pick is going to be better\nthan using more typical floss or for or\nusing those toothpick based floss\napproaches because it's gentler on the\nteeth I personally have not used a water\npick but I'm sort of intrigued by the\nthe concept because it sounds like it's\num much harder to damage the gums and\nteeth by doing it and that it is at\nleast as efficient as standard flossing\nso for those of you that have the\ndisposable income and the interest in\nusing a water pick sounds like it could\nbe a really good idea for the vast\nmajority of us like me just getting some\ntraditional uh floss and using dental\nfloss um at least once a day at night\nand ideally also in the morning after\nbrushing that seems like the most direct\nand lowcost strategy I should just\nmention that the pediatric dentist that\nI spoke to mentioned that flossing is\nreally about removing food product from\nbetween the teeth and therefore children\nyounger than six who typically have big\nspaces between their baby teeth and\ntheir adult teeth have not yet come in\nin fact that's what those spaces are\nabout by the way unless you're me and\nwhen you were a kid your teeth were too\nclose together and all your adult teeth\ncame in behind those teeth it was really\nmiserable experience for me most kids\ntheir baby teeth are spaced out a bit\nand in order to allow the adult teeth to\ncome in to erupt as it's called such a\ndramatic word I love reading this\nliterature you know when the molers\nerupt it's like whoa no it just come up\nthrough the gums those spaces are really\nthere for the adult teeth to come up\nthrough the gums and so it was suggested\nthat children who have those spaces\nbetween their teeth and the spaces are\nbig don't need to floss between those\nteeth because it could cause some damage\nto the gums rather they should just\nfocus on their brushing now let's talk\nabout some protocols that involve\nchanging the chemistry of your mouth not\njust immediately after meals or during\nbrushing or flossing but really around\nthe clock and one of the key protocols\nthat I'd like to discuss is the use of\nan artificial sugar called Xylitol\nxylitol is a very low calorie sweetener\nI can place it among the other low\ncalorie sweeteners like aspartame\nsucrose Stevia Etc but what's unique\nabout xylitol is that very much like\nstandard sugar or any kind of\ncarbohydrate\nsugar the bacteria streptococus mutans\nloves to eat Xylitol but when\nstreptococus mutans eats Xylitol it\ndoesn't meaning it cannot produce the\nacid that normally would demineralize\nthe teeth and create cavities in\naddition to that when streptococus\nmutans eats Xylitol it kills\nstreptococus mutans so what this means\nis that if xylol is present in the oral\ncavity after a meal say in the minutes\nand hours after a meal then any strep\nmutans that happens to be there is going\nto preferentially feed on the Xylitol\nnot other sugars and it won't be able to\nrelease acid and because Xylitol can\nactually inhibit the growth and that is\nthe proliferation of more strep mutans\nwe've got a twofer we've got a situation\nwhere strep mutans can't release acid to\ndemineralize the teeth and potentially\ncause cavities and the total amount of\nstrep mutans that can grow that can\nproliferate in what are called colonies\nliterally the bacteria colonizes on the\nteeth in that forming that bofilm well\nthen that can't happen so xylitol is a\nvery potent tool for improving oral\nhealth in this way in addition Xylitol\nreduces inflammation of the gum tissue\nand other soft tissues of the mouth and\nso xylitol is providing an array of\npositive benefits especially when it's\npresent to the mouth immediately after\nmeals and for that reason there are a\nnumber of different dentists that have\ncreated Xylitol products\nin the form of gums or in the form of\nmints specifically to be used after\nmeals so by chewing a few of these\nXylitol mints or by chewing a Xylitol\nbased gum immediately after a meal\nyou're taking substantial steps towards\nimproving the chemical milu of your\nmouth and inhibiting the proliferation\nof cavity forming streptococus mutants\nnow you can also find some literature on\nother proposed benefits of Xylitol such\nas you know improving overall\nmicrobiome uh such as reducing\ninflammation in other tissues besides\nthe gums and within the mouth there is\nsome evidence that it can support the\ngut microbiome because of course the\noral microbiome and the gut microbiome\nare contiguous they have different\ncompartments I mean you might even be\nsurprised to learn that within your\nmouth there are different niches as\nthey're called for instance there's\ndifferent microbiota that live on the\ngums versus the hard pallet versus the\nsoft pallet back in the throat and then\nas you descend into the gut Etc and it\ndoes appear that Xylitol has certain\npositive benefits for all of those\ndifferent gut microbiome niches but the\nliterature on that is less well\nsubstantiated than for instance the\nliterature showing that if xylitol is\nput in as a surrogate sugar substrate\nfor strep mutans that it disables strep\nmutans and can prevent the formation of\ncavities now as far as I know when\nconsumed in mint form or gum form I'm\nnot aware of any specific side effects\nor bad effects of Xylitol provided that\nit's not consumed in excess but as with\neverything dosage matters so if you're\nsomebody who wants to explore the use of\nxylol gum or xylol mins after a meal I\nwouldn't suggest going from consuming\nzero Xylitol mins to consuming 50 a day\nor something like that or even 10 a day\nyou might start off slowly and just\nconsume one or two after a meal maybe\njust your morning meal maybe just your\nevening meal something of that sort\nrather than chewing Xylitol gum all day\nlong etc etc I'll just mention one other\npositive benefit of Xylitol gum which is\nif you use Xylitol gum after say your\nnoon meal or your early Day meal it\nfurther increases the production of\nsaliva which as we talked about before\nis a great thing because one of the best\nways to support oral health and tooth\nhealth is to have a long stretch of time\nin the middle of the day where you're\nproducing a lot of healthy saliva in\nlarge amounts because again saliva is\nthis incredible stuff that's supporting\nremineralization of the teeth so lots\nand lots of reasons to think about maybe\nconsider using xotl gum or xotl mins\nthere are a number of different ones\navailable out there I have zero again\nzero Z Financial relationship to any of\nthose Mint or gum companies I'll provide\na link in the show note captions to One\nSource the company and the products were\ndeveloped by a dentist Dr Ellie Phillips\nwho is quite prominent in the public\nhealth education space around dental\nhealth some of her views are a little\nbit controversial like her views on\nflossing other of her views I find\nfrankly quite ahead of their time in\nthat she's been talking about a number\nof these things like promoting the\nhealth of the oral microbiome and the\npotential value of Xylitol gums and etc\nfor some period of time I think most of\nthe information that she puts out there\nis supported by other dentists and she\nstill suggests regular Dental visit so\num you know nothing Renegade out there\nor heretical uh again there are other\nsources of xotl gums and mints that you\ncould consider I'm simply putting a link\nto the one that I use because I happen\nto use them and like them so I'd like to\nuse the discussion about Xylitol as a\nsegue into a discussion about toothpaste\nbecause there is a lot of controversy\nout there about which tooth space are\nbetter for us maybe even bad for us and\nbest for us I think it's fair to say\nbased on what we all now know about\nxylol that if you can find a toothpaste\nthat contains Xylitol as a sweetener\nthat can only be a good thing and indeed\nthere are a number of them out there\nwe'll talk about specific sources in a\nlittle bit but let's just put Xylitol on\nthe um short to not so short list of\nthings that would be great to have in a\ntoothpaste for all the reasons that you\nnow understand the real big question\nwith toothpaste is always should I use a\ntoothpaste that has fluoride or avoid\ntoothpastes that have fluoride and in\norder to answer that we have to go back\nto our earlier discussion about fluoride\nit really depends on whether or not\nyou're somebody that thinks that\nfluoride is great because it creates\nthese super physiologically strong bonds\nwithin our teeth the crystal structures\nare that much stronger than when formed\nby hydroxy appetite or whether or not\nyou're somebody who is wary of fluoride\nthat you're concerned about potential\nbrain health issues or thyroid issues\nand you know here I think people really\ndo fall into either camp or the camp\nfrankly of I don't know should I be\nworried I don't know if I should be\nworried I personally grew up using\nfluide toothpaste we had the kind of\nstandard name brand fluoride toothpaste\num in our bathroom I brushed my teeth\nwith those for years whether or not that\nnegatively impacted my health or not I\ndon't know uh get my blood work done my\nthyroid hormones are normal um my brain\nworks at least you know reasonably well\nbut I do realize that some people are\nvery concerned about fluoride and they\njust don't want it anywhere near their\nkids they don't want it anywhere near\nthemselves so if you're somebody who's\ngoing to air on the side of caution with\nfluoride and you are seeking a non\nfloride containing toothpaste there are\nsuch toothpaste out there and most of\nthose if not all of them contain you\nguest it hydroxy appetite they contain\nthe minerals that naturally form the\nbonds that create that additional enamel\nthat can potentially fill in cavities\nand by remineralization of the enamel\nand some of the deeper layers of the\ntooth so if one is seeking toothpaste\nand you want to avoid fluoride you'd\nwant to find something that ideally had\nhydroxy appetite and something that had\nXylitol and they often also contain some\nsort of mild abrasive okay not a not a\nreally scratchy abrasive substance um\nbut a mild abrasive that can really\nallow for breaking up of the bofilm that\nwe talked about earlier now I've\nprovided links to a couple of sources\nfor such toothpaste and also for these\nlittle toothpaste tablets um that I've\nbeen using lately as well sometimes\nswitch back and forth between the two\nthese are tablets that you chew up and\nthen you uh brush your teeth immediately\nafter you with your wet toothbrush both\nof them work quite well again I want to\nbe clear that the companies that I've\nprovided links to in the show note\ncaptions are companies for which I have\nabsolutely zero Financial relationship I\ndo know some of the people that started\nthese companies I actually discovered\nthese companies because these people are\ndentists or periodontists or other\npeople in the oral health field uh but I\nalso want to be very clear that there\nwas no exchange of promo of their\nproducts for information or otherwise I\nsimply tried and like the products and I\njust so happen to have learned some\nthings about Oral healthc Care from\nthese people separate and away from\nanything about toothpaste or Xylitol Etc\nokay so want to be very clear that I do\nbelieve these are quality sources these\nare the toothpaste and tooth tablets\nthat I happen to use gums and mints that\nI happen to use large part as a\nconsequence of researching this episode\nbut I pay full price for them I'm\ncertainly not suggesting that anyone\nelse has to use them they just represent\none option if you're looking for non-\nfluoride containing toothpaste and some\nother things to promote oral health and\nI'm sure there are other sources out\nthere and if you'd like to refer the\nvarious viewers and listeners of this\npodcast to those sources because you\nfeel very strongly about those other\nsources just put those in the comment\nsection on YouTube okay let's talk about\nmouthwash or mouthwashes plural at the\nbeginning of today's episode I said\nlet's determine what category of oral\nhealth you are in are you somebody who\npays a lot of attention to oral health\nyou brush and floss at least twice a day\nyou're using mouthwashes tooth whiteners\nperhaps as well or are you in category\ntwo or three well here's the deal most\nall most all not all but most all\nmouthwashes especially those containing\nalcohol are terrible for oral health\nsimply put they deplete certain\ncomponents of the mucosal lining of the\nmouth and they disrupt the healthy\ncomponents of the oral microbiome so for\nthose of you that rely on such\nmouthwashes I would really encourage you\nto learn more about them you're about to\ndo that now you're already doing that\nnow and to really consider whether or\nnot they are helping or harming your\noral health now I'm not suggesting that\nyou create a scenario where your breath\nis causing other people to dissolve into\na puddle of Tears or back away from you\nquickly that's not what you want that's\nnot what I want that's not what anyone\nwants but I think it's important to\nrealize that these alcohol-based\nmouthwashes are not good for us in\naddition they're antiseptic mouthwashes\nsome of which contain alcohol some of\nwhich don't which sometimes are\nprescribed for very serious bacterial\novergrowth and infections of the oral\ncavity if your dentist or physician or\nperiodontist prescribes those I\ncertainly am not going to try and get in\nthe way of that prescription that's\nbetween you and your healthc care\nprofessional but you would be wise to\nask them whether or not these\nchlorohexidine type mouthwashes Etc are\npotentially bad for other components of\noral health or microbiota in the gut\ngenerally because in some cases they\nhave been shown to be not good for us at\nthe same time we don't want\noverproliferation of really bad bacteria\nin the mouth so we don't want infections\nto run wild either most people however\nare using mouthwashes to freshen their\nbreath and to kill off additional\nbacteria in the mouth that they might\nbelieve they couldn't get with brushing\nor flossing if if you are somebody who\nreally wants to use a mouthwash for that\nreason I encourage you to try and find a\nmouthwash that is not alcohol-based and\nthat is not a strong antiseptic or that\nif it is an antiseptic that it's not\nalcohol based okay and such mouthwashes\nexist out there they're a little bit\nhard to find I'll provide a link to at\nleast a couple of them in the show note\ncaptions here I have to say I have not\ntried those mouthwashes yet they do come\nfrom sources in which they were\ndeveloped by licensed mental healthare\nprofessionals but this is always the\ncase when somebody's selling something\nit's worthwhile to do diligence now as\nwe talk about toothpaste and mints and\ngums and mouthwashes I think it's worth\ntaking a step back and also asking the\nquestion are there any zero or very very\nlowc cost or even cost-saving\nalternatives to any of this and the\ngreat answer is yes there are actually a\nnumber of things that you can do with\nbasic over-the-counter stuff from the\ngrocery store that all the dentists I\nspoke to said yeah that's a pretty good\noption it's not the best option\navailable perhaps but it's a pretty good\noption and in many cases it's better\nthan the typical commercially available\ntoothpaste or mouthwash for\ninstance I would imagine based on\neverything I now know about the\nstructure of teeth that using something\nlike baking soda to brush the teeth\nwould indeed scrape off the bofilm\nperhaps even whiten the teeth a little\nbit although as we talked about earlier\nyou're not really whitening the teeth\nyou're actually just changing the um\nreflectiveness uh and some of the\ncomposition of that enamel which is\ntranslucent so that you can see the\nunderlying components better well I\ntalked to several dentists and they told\nme that baking soda actually is fairly\nlow on the abrasiveness rating scale\nthey have a specific rating scale for\nthis that we don't have to go into but\nit's actually considered quite safe for\nthe enamel of the teeth especially if\nyou're brushing with a soft toothbrush\nand you're not like really grinding the\nstuff against your teeth at maximum\nintensity or even near maximum intensity\nso it turns out that baking soda and\nwater is actually a pretty good\ntoothpaste if you're not going to go buy\na toothpaste so that's good news now you\nmay have heard that you can make a sort\nof mouth wash or mouth rinse with baking\nsoda water and a little bit of hydrogen\nperoxide I want to emphasize a little\nbit but I'm also going to emphasize I\ndon't think this is a good idea at all\nwhy is it not a good idea at all well\nfirst of all when we were kids we used\nto take baking soda and hydrogen\nperoxide and put them together to\nsimulate volcanoes so um that tells you\nright there the kind of chemical\nreaction that you're going to get but in\naddition to that it's pretty clear that\nhydrogen\nperoxide unless there's a specific\nmedical recommendation to do so is not\nsomething you want to introduce to the\noral cavity now this is something that\nI'm very familiar with because when I\nwas a postto so this is in the 2005 to\n2010 stretch I started to get some\npretty bad caners saurus I don't know\nabout you but krur feel awful to me I\nhate them when you eat they hurt when\nyou swallow they hurt when do anything\nthey pretty much hurt and someone gave\nme the recommendation to use a little\nbit of baking soda dissolved in some\nwater and a little bit of hydrogen\nperoxide to use that as a oral rinse and\nof course then to spit it out and I did\nthat and actually what happened to me is\nI got almost quarter siiz ulcers on the\nroof of my mouth and on the sides of my\nmouth it took those little canr saurs\nwhich were annoying and kind of painful\nand turn them into full-blown ulcers I\nknow this because when I stopped using\nit those healed up almost immediately\nand then when I spoke to some dentists\nand peridontist they said oh yeah yeah\nhydrogen peroxide is just far too\nabrasive for the mouth cavity and the\nreason I raised this is because I don't\nthink I'm alone in that if you kind of\nventure into some of the um let's call\nit alternative recommendation space for\noral health um you may hear that things\nlike hydrogen peroxide can be useful for\ngargling with or swishing with if you\nare starting to get a little bit of a\nthroat tickle maybe an infection it\nturns out it's a really bad idea now if\nthere are Physicians or oral health\nexperts out there that strongly believe\nin the use of hydrogen peroxide rinses\nor gargling with it to promote oral\nhealth for any reason let me know in the\nshow note captions I don't want to go\nagainst any of those recommendations but\nthis now considered kind of old school\nrecommendation of creating one's own\nmouthwash with a little bit of baking\nsoda some hydrogen peroxide and water\ndoes not seem like a good idea not just\nbased on my experience but every one of\nthe dental professionals that I spoke to\nthat said it does seem that creating a\nhigh salt solution okay so taking some\nsalt putting in water dissolving it and\nthen finding the point at which it won't\nquite dissolve because the concentration\nof sodium is just high enough and using\nthat as of course not something to\nswallow but rather as a dental rinse so\nputting your mouth and swishing it\naround and then spitting it out and it's\ngoing to taste very salty and then\ntaking a swig of water you know just\nplain water and then swishing it around\nand then spitting it out that actually\nprovides a really nice milu for the\nprodu production of healthy mouth\nbacteria it's near zero cost suppose you\nneed a little bit of salt low water and\na glass to put it in but it's basically\nzero cost and if you think about it that\nhigh saline or high salinity solution is\na lot like the sort of brins and the\nliquid that comes from these low sugar\nProbiotic foods that earlier I was\nsuggesting and in other episodes I've\nsuggested could be really healthy for\nswallowing for the gut microbiota but\nagain I want to be very clear do not do\nnot swallow high\nsalt concentration fluid we're talking\nabout a Swish and then a spitting it out\nas a way to improve the overall milu of\nthe mouth to get the pH right to promote\nthe proliferation of healthy microbiota\ncomponents Okay so we've talked about\nsome commercially available gums and\nmints containing Xylitol we've talked\nabout some commercially available\ntoothpastes indeed some toothpaste that\nyou know almost fall into the very\nBoutique category because they have all\nthese things that are known by dentists\nand uh peridontist to be great for oral\nhealth but those can run some cost right\nand so I do think it's important that we\nalso talked about the use of just baking\nsoda with a soft toothbrush and some\nwater and gently brushing the teeth as a\ngreat way to disrupt the bofilm and\nclean your teeth and a high salt\nsolution as a Swish and spit followed by\nyou know uh Swish and spit with clear\nwater clean water no salt in it as a\nEssen\nvery low cost or zeroc cost mouthwash\nFar and Away different from the heavily\nscented alcohol-based antiseptic mouth\nwashes that are commercially available\nand that we know are basically not good\nfor our oral microbiome in addition I'd\nlike to point out that those\nalcohol-based mouthwashes that many\npeople in the world use are also known\nto reduce the amount of nitric oxide\nthat's produced in the oral cavity and\nthat's very important for the production\nof nitric oxide elsewhere in the body\nwhy is that important well nitric oxide\npromotes\nvasodilation not just within the blood\nvessels that line and feed the oral\ncavity but also the throat also in the\nnose also in the brain also in the heart\nso what we're talking about here is a\nsubstance that is indeed increased when\nwe for instance nasal breathe we know\nthat dramatically increases nitric oxide\nwe're talking about a substance that\nwhen the oral microbiome is preserved in\nits healthy State tends to increase in\nproduction and we're talking about a\nsubstance that's really good for small\ncapillary vein and arterial health\nbecause it allows for the passage of\nblood both for the delivery of oxygen\nand other nutrients to tissues but also\nthe removal of waste products from\ntissues so we don't want to do anything\nthat reduces nitric oxide unless there's\nsome specific medical condition that\nleads us to want to do that so for most\npeople increasing nitric oxide or\nkeeping nitric oxide levels stable is\nthe state that we want to seek and these\nalcohol-based mouthwashes are known to\ndeplete the production of nitric oxide\nso there's yet another reason to avoid\nthe use of these alcohol-based more\ntypical over-the-counter\nmouthwashes by the way this is not a\nscare tactic against mouthwashes I'm\nsure that if you use mouthwashes you're\nstill producing some nitric oxide but I\nthink nowadays many hopefully all of you\nare interested in doing whatever you can\nto improve your mental health physical\nhealth and performance and if there are\nthings that you are doing that are\ninhibiting those in any way that you'd\npotentially want to at least think about\nthose maybe remove them from your\nprotocols especially if there's a cost\nto them that you can remove in other\nwords you can save on costs so again\nlots of reasons to move away from the\nalcohol-based standard antiseptic\nmouthwashes aside from the Improvement\nin your breath that by the way can be\nbetter achieved by supporting the oral\nmicrobiome other ways that we've\ndiscussed there's really no clear\nAdvantage as to why one would use one\nand there apparently are a number of\ndisadvantages anes now earlier we talked\nbriefly about canker sours they are\nreally uncomfortable there are a lot of\ntheories as to why canker form and\nthey're a lot of products and theories\nas to how to get rid of canker sorus\nwell indeed there are some ways that we\ncan prevent the formation of canker\nsorus and accelerate their healing and\nthat actually has to do with promoting\nthe health of the gut microbiome so\nthere's a clear link between gut\nmicrobiome and oral microbiome in a way\nthat can either promote or reduce the\nformation of canker sores and can\nactually help heal canker sores and to\nmy knowledge the best way to support a\nquote unquote healthy gut microbiome is\nto consume at least one to four servings\nof low sugar fermented foods per day I\nmentioned what some of those are a\nlittle bit earlier I also did an entire\nepisode about gut microbiome we've\nhosted expert guests on the microbiome\nincluding Justin sonenberg from Stanford\nschool of medicine and for sake of time\nI can just briefly list off the things\nthat are known to promote a healthy gut\nmicrobiome and that would indirectly\nsupport the healing and prevention of\ncanker sorce and those are consuming one\nto four servings of low sugar fermented\nfoods per day for instance consuming\nenough Prebiotic fiber so consuming\nenough fiber in the diet through fruits\nand vegetables or perhaps supplementing\nPrebiotic or probiotic fiber and in some\ncases if somebody is really dis biotic\nor if you've been taking antibiotics\nactually taking a pill form or capsule\nform probiotic but it's not something\nthat I recommend people take\nconsistently and I certainly don't I\nthink by ingesting those low sugar\nfermented foods on a regular basis by\ntrying to make sure that you're getting\nenough sleep each night this is key\nprobably should have mentioned this\nearlier in the episode uh but you know\none of the folks who I have great\nrespect for in the public health\ndiscussion around dental health is Dr\nMark bheen he goes by ask the dentist on\nInstagram he's actually a retired\ndentist uh but he's been deeply involved\nD in the kind of evaluation of the\nconsumer product space as it relates to\ndental and oral healthare for a number\nof years um and Mark Beren in addition\nto discussing all the various topics\nthat we've talked about today such as\nXylitol and fluoride yes or fluoride no\netc etc has also been a big proponent of\npeople paying attention to that first\npillar of mental health physical health\nand performance which is sleep and\npointing out that when people get fewer\nthan their necessary allotment of sleep\neach night so typically most people need\n6 to 8 hours some people need more some\npeople need a little less but getting at\nleast 6 to8 hours of quality sleep per\nnight which supports the health of the\ngut microbiome and oral microbiome and\nthereby indirectly supports the health\nof the entire brain and body so um Dr\nburin and others have talked about this\nbut I really appreciate that he's\nchampioned the importance of sleep among\nother things but certainly sleep as a\nway to support the oral microbiome so\nwe've talked quite a bit about teeth and\ngums a little little bit about mucosal\nlining and throat one thing that we\nhaven't talked very much about is a hung\nthe\ntongue your tongue is obviously a very\nimportant component of your mouth and as\nI mentioned earlier different niches\ndifferent locations within the mouth\nhave different microbiota living on them\nboth good and quote unquote bad meaning\nones that we'd like to promote the\nproliferation of because they reduce bad\nbreath and promote oral health and all\nthat good stuff and\nquote unquote bad bacteria because they\nmake our breath smell bad and because\nthey deteriorate the various tissues of\nthe mouth I looked pretty extensively\ninto this issue of tongue scraping and\nit's an interesting one and every\nlicensed dental health care professional\nI spoke to in preparing for this episode\nagreed that yes it can be a good idea to\nscrape the tongue and each one of them\ncited the fact that a number of\nunhealthy bacteria can build up on the\ntongue across the course of the day and\nthroughout the night much in the same\nway that biofilm can build up on teeth\nalthough through a different process\ndifferent bacteria and that scraping the\ntongue or brushing the tongue can be\nadvantageous for removing that bacteria\nwhat was interesting is that several of\nthem pointed out that lightly brushing\nthe tongue may in fact be better than\nscraping the tongue because they argue\nthat especially when people use those\nsteel tongue scrapers that few people\nknow how to use them with sufficient\nForce to remove the bacteria but not so\nmuch force that they don't damage the\ntongue tissue and the tongue is a very\nfragile soft tissue so the\nrecommendation that they relayed to me\nwas to suggest once or twice a day\nbrushing of the tongue but here's an\nimportant point they all suggested that\nyou use a separate toothbrush to brush\nyour tongue than you would to brush your\nteeth okay so if things weren't\ncomplicated enough already about using a\nseparate toothbrush why well they gave\ntwo reasons one is they want to prevent\ncrossover of the bacteria between those\ntwo different tissues especially if one\nis brushing the tongue too vigorously\nyou don't want to introduce bacteria\nfrom your toothbrushing onto your tongue\nof course you can rinse it in between\nbut the ideal situation is to use a\nseparate toothbrush for the purpose of\nbrushing the tongue now that opened up a\nwhole exploration and discussion about\ntoothbrush care we can probably do a\nwhole episode all about toothbrush care\nbut we won't suffice to say that when\nyou brush bacteria off your teeth or\ntongue\nand presumably the toothbrush gets moist\nif by no other means certainly by means\nof your saliva being on it then you\nrinse it off and then even if you were\nto dry it off with a clean um some sort\nof clean towel or something like that\nand you set it out a lot of bacteria are\ngoing to proliferate on that toothbrush\nso this opened up a whole discussion\nabout you know should you cover your\ntoothbrush or let it dry out in the air\nshould you use UV irradiation uh to\nsterilize your toothbrush and frankly it\ntook us me down the rabbit hole of\ntoothbrush care so far that at one point\nI just I just screamed like Uncle like\nenough I I think um one has to decide\nhow much bacteria they are willing to\ntolerate living on their toothbrush in\nbetween toothbrushing um anywhere from\nzero where you use a new toothbrush or\ntoothbrush head every single time you\nbrush that seems unreasonable or at\nleast economically unreasonable for most\npeople versus replacing it once a week\nversus once every two weeks really\nthere's no specific recommendation I can\nmake all I can say is be aware that\nbacteria are growing on the toothbrush\nhead try and avoid contact between the\ntoothbrush head and any um unsanitary\nsurfaces try and rinse and dry off the\ntoothbrush head all these things are\nrecommendations that were relayed to me\nand that just make good common sense now\nprior to this episode I put the call out\non social media for questions about oral\nhealth and one of the questions that\ncame back from many hundreds of people\nwas what about fillings what about Metal\nfillings what about sealant are they\nsafe well most dentists will tell you\nthat sealant are safe they are now made\nfrom compounds that are generally not\nthought to cause any major issues to be\nhonest I did not do a deep dive into the\nchemical composition of different\nsealants because it turns out that\ndifferent Dental practices use different\nsealants I'm sure that if I looked hard\nenough I could find um some really bad\nstuff in sealants I'm sure I could also\nfind some reassurance that at the\nconcentrations and conditions that\nthey're introduced to teeth that they\nare better alternative to having deep\ncavities into the teeth and that\nactually gives me an opportunity to\nraise something that I perhaps said\nearlier but I want to reemphasize which\nis I've been talking about how you can\nremineralize the teeth and how that's\ncritical if you want to maintain and\nbuild up your tooth and oral health but\nit's very clear that if the cavities get\ndown into the denting layers of the\ntooth that in most cases there is no\nremaining opportunity to remineralize\nthe teeth you using the sorts of\npractices we're talking about today and\nthat indeed it's very likely that those\ncavities need to be drilled and filled\nokay now that's not always the case and\nthis is one reason why I highly\nrecommend that if you've listened to\nthis episode and if you're here at this\npoint in the episode and you've listened\nto the episode that you talk to your\ndentist ask them if they say you have a\ncavity how deep are these cavities do\nyou think there's an opportunity for me\nto remineralize the teeth if I do the\nfollowing things and if they tell you\nlook you have a cavity or cavities and\nthey're simply too deep into the tooth\nthat you can't remineralize your teeth\nand fill those in well then you know you\nshould trust them they're the dental\nprofessional if you don't you should\nfind a different dentist however they\nmay be surprised and who knows\npleasantly surprised for you to uh say\nHey you know I heard that you can\nactually remineralize teeth and if I've\ngot a cavity but it's still not through\nthe enamel layer you know if I'm really\ndiligent and you know use some zotol and\nmaybe some hydroxy appetite and avoid\ncertain things and do certain things\ndiscussed in this episode that I could\nre\nuh remineralize and fill in those\ncavities that said there of course will\nbe situations where you need to get\nthose cavities drilled and filled\nespecially if they make it into the deep\ndeep layers of the tooth and you do not\nwant those cavities to persist and for\nbacteria to proliferate in those deeper\nlayers of the teeth and down into the\nbone that is oh so bad for reasons we\ntalked about earlier not just for your\nmouth and your teeth but for your\nGeneral Health and brain health included\nso for that reason and also because you\nknow the history of Dentistry was such\nthat you know in the early part of the\nlast century if you had a toothache in a\ncavity what did they do they pulled the\nteeth they extracted the teeth then at\nsome point this business of filling\nteeth became industry standard so people\nwould get metal fillings now the types\nof metal fillings that people had and\nhave depend on when they got those\nfillings there were were believe it or\nnot lead fillings this is not good you\ndon't want lead in your body for all\nsorts of reasons it is terrible for\nbrain health that's why it's now illegal\nto contain in paints and many household\ngoods you don't want lead fillings but\nsome people had lead fillings or silver\nfillings or a combination of lead silver\nand other things and many metal fillings\nthat were given and sometimes are still\ngiven depending on where you live in the\nworld and Country and the kind of Health\nCare and costs that you have available\nto you contain mercury now I asked\nseveral dentists about this and said\nwell if somebody has a metal filling\nthat likely has mercury in it do they\nneed to have that metal filling removed\nand all of the dentists I spoke to said\nit depends but generally the practice is\nto leave those fillings in and try not\nto disrupt them now they also provided a\nimportant recommendation which is if you\nhave metal fillings that contain mercury\nor that you think might contain mercury\nto avoid disrupting those fillings\nthrough the use of things like Mastic\nGum we haven't talked too much about\nmastic gum um I've used mastic gum\nbefore not for long periods of time it's\na very thick gum uh you know the\noriginal use of mastic gum and the the\nkind of origins of Mastic Gum are like a\ntreap kind of substance that you chew on\nsupposed to strengthen your jaw Etc um I\ndon't use it any longer I use it for a\nshort while doesn't taste like much of\nanything some people believe there are\ncertain anti-inflammatory and other\nhealth benefits of Mastic Gum I haven't\nreally explored mastic gum in enough\ndepth or detail to comment on any of\nthat but a number of dentists said well\nif you have metal fillings chewing on\nthe like Mastic Gum or you know hard\ncandies where you're really chewing on\non that hard candy which by the way\nyou're supposed to suck the hard candy\nthe Jolly ranch you're not supposed to\nchew on them but that some people will\ndo that they'll just naturally chew on\nthose can actually disrupt and liberate\nsome of that mercury and that would be\nbad and keep in mind also that when\nMercury is contained in a metal filling\nit's not really bioactive in that mode\nbut if it's liberated then it can get\ninto the bloodstream and potentially\ncause other issues so this is a somewhat\ncontroversial topic so much so that in\ncertain countries and I believe in the\nEU somebody checked me on this but I\nbelieve that in the not too distant\nfuture metal fillings will no longer be\nused in the European Union perhaps\nelsewhere in the world they're sometimes\nstill used in the United States there's\na lot that's changing in this landscape\naround fluoride around metal fillings\nEtc so it's very Dynamic landscape right\nnow I think suffice to say that if you\nhave metal fillings currently try not to\ndisrupt them in a way that could\nliberate that mercury however if you\nhave them and you're really concerned\nabout them talk to your dentist ask what\nthe various options are see whether or\nnot they could be replaced with\nsomething safer and if the process for\nreplacing them is really worth the\ntrouble and again to just go back to the\nlarger point of whether or not you\nshould get cavities filled whether or\nnot you need that root canal that was a\nvery common question a lot of people\nsaid do we really need root canals do we\nreally need to drill cavities you know\nmy observation based on now having\ntalked to a number of different\npractitioners in this space who really\npay a lot of attention to the peer\nreviewed research the old school\npractices the new practices and where\neverything is headed is that you know\nthere are indeed instances where people\nneed root canals there are many cavities\nthat are just too deep into the teeth\nthat remineralization of the teeth\nthrough the sorts of protocols that\nwe're talking about today is not going\nto cut it that they really need to be\ndrilled and filled and of course we hope\nthose dentists are doing that as little\nas is required to maintain dental health\nI also would hope that dentists are\ntalking to their patients about ways\nthat they can improve their oral health\nand indeed there are a lot of cases\nreported online where people will go in\nget X-rays and an exam they'll talk\nabout all these cavities that they have\nand then they go home and they do a\nbunch of practices and they are able to\nremineralize their teeth and to\nessentially reverse those cavities and I\ncertainly don't doubt those stories but\nit's simply not always the case that we\ncan remineralize our teeth and fill back\nin our cavities if those cavity recesses\nare too deep into the teeth they need to\nbe drilled and filled now that raises a\nfinal set of questions and points which\nis do we really need to go to the\ndentist twice a year every six months\nthat's the general recommendation and\nthis was a tricky one to ask dentists\nbecause of course dentists are highly\nincentivized to see their patients and\nI'm not somebody that believes that\neverything is a you know is an attempt\nto make money but look when money is\ninvolved things can get complicated now\nwhat was really great is that the\nfeedback I got from dentists was very\nbalanced I mean I must say that the\ncommunity of dentists um seems like a\nreally wonderful Community I don't know\nhow they treat each other but they were\nvery kind very generous with information\nwith me and at the end of this episode\njust before wrapping I'll refer you to a\ncouple um online oral health and dentist\nEducators that I think are providing\nsome really useful content on a\nconsistent basis and I'll provide links\nto those in the show note captions but\nhere's what the consensus was this\nbusiness of going to the dentist twice a\nyear makes sense it makes sense from the\nperspective of quote unquote routine\ncleanings but everyone acknowledged that\nthose routine cleanings while they can\nremove tarar that's built up that would\nbe very very difficult for people to\nreverse or eliminate at home and while\nthey can identify cavities and tell you\nhow far a cavity has developed into the\ntooth Etc every one of those dentists\nagreed that those routine cleanings are\nnot actually going to help remineralize\nyour teeth except to the extent that\nthey remove existing bacteria plaque and\ntartar and so all of them said that they\nwish for and that they really strive in\ntheir own practices to promote more oral\nhealth daily Protocols of the sort that\nwe've talked about today which I think\nis just great I think obviously I\nbelieve in medical professionals\nproviding routine care I also believe in\neach and all of us doing things for our\nhealth not just oral health but sleep\nHealth mental health physical health Etc\nto try and not just maintain but really\nbolster our brain and body against\ndisease and also to bolster our Vitality\nto feel really great energetic focused\nsleeping better Etc so it was refreshing\nto hear that they feel that way as well\nand in addition to that all the dentist\nI spoke to said that you know setting\naside situations of like\nreconstructive uh surgery for the mouth\nor perodontal surgery which often is\nneeded if that those recesses into the\ngums and gingivitis and and worse have\nstarted to really develop and\nproliferate all of them emphasize that\nthe twice a year Dental visit is not\njust about getting the cleaning it's\nreally the checkup to evaluate how those\ndaily practices are emerging so it's\nsort of like going to the doctor for a\ncheck up on your BMI on your blood\npressure but also things like blood\ntests things that typically we don't do\nat home unless we're accessing those\nthrough um particular sources but all of\nthem emphasize that going to the dentist\ntwice a year is not just about those\ncleanings it's also about establishing\nwhat the Baseline level of health is in\none's mouth and teeth and having that on\nrecord and in a very detailed way so\nthat one can check back routinely twice\na year and discover whether or not in\nfact they could get away with perhaps\none cleaning a year because you're so\ndiligent about your brushing flossing\nXylitol uh not being a mouth breather\nand on and on or perhaps if you're not\nbeing very good about those protocols or\nand this is important if you have some\nof the genetic variants that create an\nover proliferation of certain bacteria\nthat predispose you to gingivitis or\nthat predispose you to excessive buildup\nof tartar this is the reality that some\npeople have genetic variations that\ncreate a susceptibility to certain\nthings both bacteria and other\nconditions in the mouth that make it\nsuch that those people perhaps need to\ngo to the dentist not just twice a year\nbut perhaps four times a year or six\ntimes a year indeed there are some\nindividuals for whom either because of\nlack of diligence to protocol and or\ngenetic issues actually need to go to\nthe dentist every single month for major\ncleanings but fortunately if we are\ndiligent about these daily protocols\nnighttime protocols and we really are\nare paying attention to the components\nthat can create healthy saliva and\nremineralize the teeth and that can fill\nin any cavities that begin to form and\nwe're staving off the production of\nmutants and we're scraping away that\nbofilm on a regular basis that we are\ngoing to prevent the need for so many\nroutine cleanings and even if we are\nstill getting those two-year routine\ncleanings you know for those out there\nthat are fortunate enough to have that\ncovered by insurance or can afford it\nwell then all the better because as I\nmentioned at the beginning of today's\nepisode oral health is not just about\nhaving clean straight white teeth and\nfresh breath it's not just about that\nall of those things are great to have\nbut oral health is about all of that and\nit's also about reducing cardiovascular\ndisease it's about reducing irritable\nbowel syndrome yes I know that we\nhaven't done an episode about this yet\nbut I get oh so many requests to do\nepisodes about irritable bowel syndrome\nand other colitis type uh you know\nboweling gut issues that people have and\nit's so clear that oral health and\npromoting oral health has been linked to\npromoting positive gut health as well\nmaybe even reducing and possibly\neliminating some of the symptoms of\nirritable bowel disease because again\nthe mouth and the gut are contiguous\nwith one another they're related and a\nlot of the bacteria that can cause\nthings like gut issues are making their\nway into the body not directly through\nthe gut but through the oral cavity\nbecause of the richness of blood flow to\nthat region so again today we've talked\nabout a lot of different protocols\nranging from cost saving to zero cost to\nlow cost to let's just be frank higher\ncost products and protocols such as\nwater picks Etc the point of today's\ndiscussion was essentially three-fold\nfirst of all to really Tamp down in our\nminds the importance of oral health not\njust tooth Health but oral health on the\nwhole because of its relationship to\nbrain and body Health on the whole so\nmuch so that I'm placing it right up\nthere next to the other six pillars of\nsleep nutrition MO movement stress\nmodulation relationships and light as\nthe seventh pillar of critical to attend\nto on a daily basis in order to promote\nour mental health physical health and\nperformance the second point is that\nthere are many things that we are\nprobably doing currently that we could\ndo differently either by doing them more\nor perhaps less or eliminating them all\ntogether things like considering whether\nor not these antiseptic alcohol-based\nmouthwashes are good for you or not\nthey're not they're bad for you in my my\nopinion but you can decide for you how\noften you brush when you brush whether\nor not you decide to use Xylitol Etc as\nways to improve your oral health and of\ncourse in doing so the strength of your\nteeth the brightness of your teeth the\nfreshness of your breath Etc but through\nsome means that I think for most people\nthey weren't aware of I certainly wasn't\naware that we could remineralize our\nteeth at any moment by changing the\nacidity the chemical millu of our mouth\nand that they're very straightforward\ncost saving zero cost and low cost ways\nto do that and then the third point is\nthat today's discussion by no means was\nexhaustive right you may be exhausted\nbut it was by no mean exhaustive meaning\nwe simply don't have time to go down the\nrabbit hole of all these other promoted\nHealth practices such as for instance\noil pulling a lot of people out there\nbelieve that if you take olive oil and\nswish it around your mouth and spit it\nout that that's good for your mouth and\nindeed some Dental healthc Care\nProfessionals I should say licensed\nDental Healthcare professional said yeah\nI think there's some benefit to that\nthere's the whole story about vitamin D\nand whether or not we're getting enough\nvitamin D can indeed impact our tooth\nhealth so make sure your vitamin D\nlevels are sufficient make sure you're\ngetting some sunlight again this ties\ninto some of the other six\npillars am I suggesting that everyone do\noil pulling no I don't think the\npeer-reviewed evidence on oil pulling is\nsufficient to suggest that people do\nthat but as a practice considering that\nit's you know essentially near zero cost\nyou know taking a little bit of olive\noil and swishing around your mouth and\nspitting it out couple cents maybe um\nyou know if that's something that you\nfeel benefits you great if you are aware\nof some terrific peer reviewed research\non that and you want to put a link to\nthat in the comments on YouTube great\nplease send them my way I'd love to\nreview them but my point is that there\nare a lot of different practices that\nhave been promoted including oil pulling\nand a bunch of other things that start\nto get pretty far into the esoteric\nwhich doesn't necessarily mean that they\ndon't have Merit but today I've really\ntried to focus on the major ones the\nones that relate to what most everybody\ncould and should be doing like brushing\nand flossing rinsing getting the oral\nmicrobiome healthy reducing the amount\nof strep mutants and the opportunity of\nstrep mutants to create that acid that's\ngoing to deplete the enamel of your\nteeth and lead to tooth\ndecay trying to limit the amount of\nrecessing of the gums and perodontal\ndisease and for all the reasons that we\ntalked about\nbefore keeping a healthy mouth including\nhealthy teeth healthy tongue healthy\ngums healthy pallet and all the rest is\noh so important not just for your mouth\nnot just for speaking and smiling and\nlooking the way you want to look but\nalso for your heart also for your gut\nalso for your believe it or not your\nskin didn't have time to go into this\nbut it directly relates to skin health\nand for your brain health so I strongly\nsuggest that all of us take a look at\nwhat we are currently doing for our\ntooth and oral health and consider what\nmodification\nare best for us if you're learning from\nAndor
