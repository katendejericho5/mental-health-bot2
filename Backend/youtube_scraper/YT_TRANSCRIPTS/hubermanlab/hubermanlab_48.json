    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr K Tai Dr K\nTai is a professor of neuroscience at\nthe sulk Institute for biological\nstudies she did her training at MIT and\nat Stanford and is currently an\ninvestigator with the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute which is a highly\ncurated group of individuals who are\nincentivized to do highrisk high reward\nwork and Pioneer new areas of biological\nstudy throughout her career Dr Kai has\nmade fundamental breakthroughs into our\nunderstanding of the brain including\ndemonstrating that a brain area called\nthe amydala which most people associate\nwith fear and threat detection is\nactually involved in reinforcement of\nbehaviors and experiences that are\npositive and involve reward her current\nwork focuses on various aspects of\nsocial interaction including what\nhappens when we feel lonely or isolated\nindeed today K Tai will tell us about\nher discovery of so-called loneliness\nneurons neurons that give us that sense\nthat we are not being fulfilled from our\nsocial interactions she also describes a\nphenomenon she discovered called social\nhomeostasis which is our sense that we\nare experiencing enough not enough or\njust enough social interaction\nirrespective of whether or not we are an\nintrovert or an extrovert we also talk\nabout social hierarchies and social rank\nhow people and animals tear out into\nso-called alphas and betas subordinates\nand dominants Etc in all sorts of social\ninteractions I think everyone will find\nthat discussion especially interesting\nand we talk about the role of social\nmedia and online interactions and why\ndespite extensive interaction with many\nmany individuals those social media and\nonline interactions can often leave us\nfeeling deprived in specific ways we\ntalk about the neurochemical the neural\ncircuit and some of the hormonal aspects\nof social interactions it's a discussion\nthat by the end will have you thinking\nfar more deeply about what is a social\ninteraction and why certain social\ninteractions leave us feeling so good\nothers feeling sort of meh and why other\nsocial interactions or lack of social\ninteractions can often leave us feeling\nquite depleted even depressed it's a\nconversation Central to mental illness\nand the understanding of things like\nlike depression and anxiety PTSD and\nisolation and it's a conversation\nCentral to mental health and in order to\nbuild healthy social interactions before\nwe begin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\neight sleep eight sleep makes Smart\nmattress covers with cooling Heating and\nsleep tracking capacity I've spoken many\ntimes before on this other podcast about\nthe fact that sleep is the foundation of\nmental health physical health and\nperformance now one of the key aspects\nto getting a great night's sleep is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's because in order\nto fall and stay deeply asleep your body\ntemperature actually has to drop by\nabout 1 to 3Â° and in order to wake up in\nthe morning feeling refreshed your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to three degrees eight sleep\nmakes it extremely easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nat the beginning middle and throughout\nthe night and when you wake up in the\nmorning I've been sleeping on an eight\nSleep mattress cover for nearly 3 years\nnow and it has dramatically improved

sleep\npatterns impact your health by giving\nyou real-time feedback on your diet\nusing a continuous glucose monitor now\nblood glucose sometimes referred to as\nblood sugar has an immediate and\nlong-term impact on your energy levels\nand your overall health one of the best\nways to maintain focus and energy\nthroughout your day as well as to keep\nyour so-called metabolic Health in best\norder is to make sure that your blood\nglucose never spikes too much nor does\nit get too low\nwith levels you can monitor how\ndifferent foods and food combinations\nimpact your blood glucose levels on a\nmomentto moment basis I've been using\nlevels for some time now and it's really\nhelped me understand which foods and\nfood combinations exercise schedules and\nsleep schedules are optimal for my blood\nglucose levels and how that translates\nto energy levels and other metrics of\nHealth if you're interested in learning\nmore about levels and trying a\ncontinuous glucose monitor

has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans zero sugar and the appropriate\nratios of the electrolyt sodium\nmagnesium and potassium and that correct\nratio of electrolytes is extremely\nimportant because every cell in your\nbody but especially your nerve cells\nyour neurons relies on electrolytes in\norder to function properly so when\nyou're well hydrated and your hydration\nalso includes the appropriate ratios of\nelectrolytes your mental functioning and\nyour physical functioning is improved I\ndrink one packet of element dissolved in\nabout 16 to 32 ounces of water when I\nwake up in the morning as well as while\nI exercise and if I've sweat a lot\nduring that exercise I often will drink\na third element packet dissolved in\nabout 32 ounces of water after I\nexercise element comes in a variety of\ndifferent flavors personally I like all\nthe fruit flavors so raspberry and\nwatermelon are my favorite I also like\nthe Citrus flavored one frankly I can't\nreally pick just one of the fruit\nflavors I like them all so much and it\nalso comes in chocolate and chocolate\nmint flavors which I find are best in\nthe winter months because of course you\ndon't just need hydration on hot days\nand in the summer and spring months but\nalso in the winter when the temperatures\nare cold and the environment tends to be\ndry if you'd like to try

Andy\nhuberman what a treat folks are going to\nhear you call me Andy and wonder if my\nname is Andy I always know who I'm\nspeaking to according to whether or not\nthey call me Andrew which is my family\nand people that I know after a certain\nperiod of my life Drew which are people\nthat know me through my very brief and\nnon- illustrious career in boxing\nand Andy which are people that met me as\nI was coming up through science uh let's\njust put it this way there was another\nAndrew we did a coin flip and I lost so\nAndy is fine Andrew is fine whatever\nmakes you comfortable what's important\ntoday is not how anyone refers to me but\nrather the discussion about your work\nwhich is spectacular I've known you a\nlong time and I've been following your\ncareer and it's just been amazing and\nwonderful to see the contributions\nyou've made to science and also to the\nculture of science so we're going to\ntalk about both of those things to kick\nthings off let's talk about a brain\nstructure that most people I think have\nheard of but that is badly misunderstood\nand that's the amydala most people hear\namydala and they think oh fear that's\nwhat the amydala is all about but you\nknow\nand I'm hoping you'll educate us on the\nfact that that the amydala is actually\nfar more complex than that and far more\ninteresting than that so when you hear\nthe word amydala where does your mind go\nI agree that a lot of the the bandwidth\non the amydala has been occupied by fear\nstudies but we've known actually for\nreally long time that the amydala is\nimportant for all sorts of emotional\nprocessing since clu and beuty\nperformed lesions on on monkeys and\nfound that monkeys would then have flat\naffective responses to all sorts of\ndifferent stimuli poop food inanimate\nobject whatever it was just nothing no\nemotion no emotional response no\nmotivational significance however you\nwant to phrase it to things that usually\nwould make you either you know disgusted\nor excited or neutral and so um I think\nthat that knowledge about the amydala\nwas there from the beginning it's not\nsomething I came up with um but then\nit's interesting it's almost a it's a\nmeta statement or meta observation about\nhow scientific research progresses\nsometimes you make a lot of progress in\none particular vein because it's easy to\npress forward there but it's important\nto also think about all the other parts\nand filling in the space in between to\nmake sure you haven't missed anything so\nthe narrative about the amigdala became\nabout fear and and I think also just\nwhen we think about\nsurvival when you are an animal in the\nnatural world especially if you're a\nprey animal which is the majority you\nknow that's a lot of animals um then you\nneed to prioritize escaping a predator\nit's immediate threat on your survival\nversus rewards set mating drinking water\ngetting food these things can be done\nlater escaping this Predator is\nParamount and so there should be some\nnatural a symmetry in how we process\nemotion at Baseline and so that's\nsomething that we've looked into a lot\nas well but um I think the the big\npicture discovery that um my team has\ncontributed to our understanding of the\namigdala is that it represents a fork in\nthe road uh for processing emotional\nveence and thinking about all these old\npsychological theories about how do you\nemotionally evaluate the world around\nyou what's what's the what's the chain\nof events is there chain of events\nwhat's happening in a certain order um\nversus what's happening in parallel for\nexample one model is you know there's\nall this information that comes in and\nthen we have to filter out what's\nimportant um what's going to be\nsomething I need to pay attention to\nversus what do I need to ignore if I'm\ndriving I need to pay attention to the\nroad this this light this pedestrian\njust started walking versus you know\nwhat it feels like for my sock to be\ntouching my foot not super relevant\nright now or the my butt against the\nseat not nothing I need to pay attention\nto I need to focus on you know the\ndynamic information then you have to\nselect you know the Second Step would be\nselecting whether it's good or bad and\nwhat you want to do with it and so that\nprocess I think the selection of whether\nyou're um assigning it a positive or\nnegative veilance happens in the amydala\nso glad you brought up this word\nveilance I think it's a word that some\nscientists but most of the general\npublic are probably not familiar with so\nlet's um talk about veilance um and then\nI want to go back to the amydala and um\nkind of explore some of its diversity of\nfunction a little bit more so when I\nhear the word veilance I think goodness\nversus Badness yeah of something is that\nbasically basically it's been used in a\nlot of different fields I think of that\nyou know negative and positive numbers\nor or um but it's an analogy that we\ntake to just mean yeah net positive net\nnet negative and it's it's a intentional\ndeparture from the word value um value\nbecomes very scalar everything's on you\nknow it can be in the same direction\nwith different magnitudes is often how\nwe think about value it it could be\nrepresenting both valances but um often\nit's a small reward and a big reward or\nsmall punishment and big punishment is\nhow experimentally we parse um value and\nso veillance is just asking about um how\nyour brain responds to things that are\ngood or bad what are neurons that might\nrespond similarly to things that are\ngood and bad you know those might be\nimportance neurons rather than um\npositive or negative veilance neurons so\nyeah I I think it's a it's just a term\nthat that signifies that next step so\nwhen we walk into say a novel\nenvironment um do you think that our\namygdalas are active and really trying\nto figure out whether or not an\nenvironment a set of people or a person\nis safe and really just check that box\nfirst in order to be able to do other\nthings is you know is this business of\num determining veilance and the role of\nthe amydala in that kind of the first\ngate that we have to walk through\nanytime we're in a new environment for\ninstance you showed up here today and\nyou mentioned you know I think I locked\nmy car and um and I said you'll be fine\nin this neighborhood either way and then\nyou walked in and presumably you were\ntaking in the new environment meeting\nsome new people um we had a little\ndiscussion about caffeine uh a little\ndiscussion about alcohol and presumably\nbecause you and I know one another you\nfelt safe I would hope so but presumably\nthe amydala is always performing this\nrole even if we have some prior\nknowledge about something just figuring\nout am I safe here where are the exits\nwhere are the entrances uh who's here\nwhat's their story um do you think all\nof that is is operating and do you think\nit's always conscious or is it largely\nunconscious to us\nokay so there's a few different\nquestions there um first I want to\naddress the the question about novelty\nand then I want to come back to this the\nother issue of conscious but um the way\nthat amydala works is its job is is to\nassign meaning to anything that could\nhave motivational significance and so if\nit's a brand new thing we're paying\nattention we're seeing if if it if it\nmattered did it matter and so I think\nanything that's novel even if we don't\nknow what it means a loud sound you've\nnever heard before um even if it\nsignifies nothing of motivational\nsignificance the first few times that\nyou're presented with it you'll get an\namigdalar response so you see this in\nthe lab play the tone for the first time\nand then there's a response that rapidly\ndecays when the tone doesn't end up\npredicting anything that the the animal\ncan can detect or human is this also\ntrue in this is true in humans um if\nyou're the type of person that puts your\nphone on do not disturb versus has it on\nvibrate and you know sometimes it's\nalways vibrating and it's just it\nvibrates all the time whereas I put my\nphone on do not disturb and so when\nsomeone else's phone rings it's very\nstartling to me but they they don't even\nnotice because their phone that's just\nthe sound their phone makes it makes it\nall the time so I think it has to do\nwith how many times you're presented\nwith it and it's it's a startle response\nso the first few times that you are\npresented with a stimulus uh the amydala\nwill respond and then it decays very\nquickly and then only if that stimulus\npredicts something important or\nsomething rewarding or or punishing then\nuh will will begin to respond again so\nit's it's like you're giving everything\nnovel\na chance to to tell you in one trial in\nsingle trial learning um if something's\ngoing to happen and\nso um I think a fire alarm is a great\nexample you know fire alarm goes off\nyou're\nyou're instantly you know you're looking\naround is there anything happening even\neven just people rushing out you know\nthere's there's this the Salient thing\nthat you're going to respond to and you\nknow if you have a lot of fire drills\nthen you might respond differently after\na while so I think that's the\nhabituation component you mentioned that\nthe amigdala will respond to a novel\nstimulus\num and if it predicts something\ninteresting then other things happen\nwe'll talk about those um if not the\namydala stops responding and you said\nsomething really important which is that\nthe amydala will respond to something\nthat is predicting reward or punishment\nand I think most people don't realize\nthat in fact I think a lot of early\ncareer neurobiologists don't realize\nthat that the amydala is not just\ninvolved in fear and Punishment um so\nwhen we talk about the amydala\npresumably we're talking about the\namydala complex a bunch of other things\nso is it true that there are neurons in\nthe amydala complex that predict reward\nand others that predict fear and\nPunishment yeah so um as a graduate\nstudent I worked on a part of the\namydala called the basolateral amydala\nit's still a complex Within the broader\namydala\num this brain region is cortical like in\nthat it's mostly glutamatergic neurons\nwith some gab argic neurons mixed in but\nwithout the same structure that the\ncortex has um and I studied the the\namigdala in the context of reward I\nfound essentially that when you induce\nplasticity you get a synaptic\nstrengthening when you uh when animals\nlearn things amigdala neurons fire in\nresponse to cues that predict rewards\nand this was you coming into the context\nof a field that had shown that this\nhappens with fear and so this became I I\nremember my the very first time I gave\num a SC a presentation at a scientific\nconference I was a junior graduate\nstudent I was given a 10-minute talk at\nthe you know inaugural amigdala Gordon\nresearch conference many famous\nprofessors were\nspeaking and there were two talks about\nthe amigdala and reward and I was one of\nthem and the response to the talk was\njust how is this possible how can how\ncan the amydala how can how can you get\nthe same readout for reward and fear and\nreally it came to be there's two two\npossibilities I there's more\npossibilities but the main two\npossibilities are number one that the\namydala wasn't specific for fear at all\nit just responds to anything important\nif it's important it responds period the\nother possibility is that the amydala is\nsending has different neurons that\nrespond to positive and negative\npredictive stimuli and sends this\ninformation to different Downstream\ntargets to respond differently obviously\nI respond differently to a reward I walk\ntowards it I I consume it a punishment\nI'm avoiding it and so clearly the\nbehaviors are diametrically opposed and\nso to me it seemed very possible at\nleast that that there was a Divergence\npoint and maybe this could be it and so\nwe just did some very simple experiments\nwhen I first started my lab to trace the\nprojection targets of amydala neurons\nand record and so everything's all mixed\nup together so it's not obvious that\nthey would that that this would be a\nfork in the road but when you look at\nthem you do see that there are\nprojections that come from the amigdala\nthat are predominantly encoding either\nreward or fear and there's many\ndifferent projections and um you know\nthis is just the beginning but this was\na time when it\na novel concept to even think that\nneurons from one region could have\ncompletely different functions going to\ndifferent Downstream targets which now\nseems totally obvious um and it there's\nhundreds and hundreds of papers showing\nit now but at the time it was difficult\nto get this work published because\nthat's just not how people thought\nabout information moving through the\nbrain I guess well I think um first of\nall such important work and so wonderful\nto be uh uh early in the the phase of\nrecasting how the brain works which is\nwhat you did um I think most people in\nthe general public still think amydala\nfear and uh clearly it's able to Signal\nreward and Punishment as you discovered\nand are now pointing out um I'm curious\ndoes the amydala have a direct line to\nsome of the organs of the body that can\nchange our bodily activation state heart\nrate breathing rate um muscle tension\nbecause I think most of us experience\nfear and reward as both in our head in\nour brains but also of the body great\nquestion great question so um I'll tell\nyou the clues that lead me to my current\nworking model which may you know is not\nnecessarily the final word but I would\nsay that I think the amydala complex as\nwe're discussing it these 13 subnuclei\nthat reside you know in the temporal\nlobe\nthey are important for assigning\nimportance but they're not important for\nproducing the actual autonomic arousal\nthat we associate with Panic or fear the\nreason I say this is there's a famous\ncase study patient SM who have has\nbilateral damage to her amyd and um in\nyou know no responses to emotional faces\nno responses to fearful stimuli um but\nif you\nif capable of having the Panic response\ndue to low to to Suffocation associated\nwith it with Suffocation and so there's\nstill the ability to produce that panic\nand arousal response um it's just not\nthe cognitive evaluation of it I think\nthat's what we think the amydala is\ndoing is assigning that it it does\nreceive information from the rest of the\nbody um there are for example gin\nreceptors in the amydala things that can\nsense hunger and um we've done\nsome some work looking at this kind of\ninspired by I'm not sure if this you're\nfamiliar with this study um it's a\ncontroversial study Dan zigger 2011 but\nwhere the Supreme Court judges they they\nlooked at Supreme Court Judge rulings on\non parole decisions um across the day\nrelative to meal breaks and you can see\nright after it's like it's like\nbreakfast you know 90% everybody's\ngetting for everybody's getting out yeah\nand then it just drops till 10% then\nthere's lunch then we're back to 80% and\nthen it just precipitously drops to\nsingle digits again so the judges are\nchanging the leniency of their rulings\ndepending on how wellfed they are you\nknow there there are counterarguments to\nthis but that is strongly what the data\nsuggests you know it is not a controlled\nstudy it is just a striking correlation\num but it's the it's it's not a\ncompletely novel concept the hangry\nphenomenon I'm sure I don't know\neverybody's different I certainly\nexperience it um but we we think that\nwhen you are getting strong signals from\nthe body for example you know I think I\nthink the amdal is going to be able to\ndetect a lot of different homeostatic\ninputs even though we haven't we don't\nhave evidence for that yet but for\nspecifically energy balance when you're\nhungry um your amydala can detect it\nperhaps through grin receptors or other\nother you know mechanisms um and then\nwhat we see is that in that food deprive\nafter one day of food dep deprivation\nfor mice\num you can see this shift in the balance\nbetween the positive veilance um\nencoding projection neurons and the\nnegative veence en coding projection\nneurons and a at\nBaseline fear trumps all the negative\nprojection neurons you know can silence\nthe reward projection ones which makes\nsense if I need to run away from this\nPredator you know I can't I can't worry\nabout eating this food right now but if\nI'm in a near starvation like state\nwhich for my they have very high\nmetabolism so one day without food is a\nreally big deal um they only last a few\ndays so um at this point they are\nkicking into survival mode where\nactually getting food becomes the the\ngreater need and you'll see animals you\nknow hunting in ways they normally\nwouldn't hunt when when they're really\ndesperate and so this mode of of food\ndeprivation shifts things so that the\nreward um pathway actually has stronger\npower to to influence and silence the uh\nfear pathway than before wow the brain\nis so smart it really is it can take\nwhat we normally think of as a priority\nlist fear and staying safe is more\nimportant than food reward and then if\nfood and acquiring food is critical to\nsurvival it can invert all that is what\nyou're saying exactly amazing and it\nhappens you know in a day it seems\nreversible so that's something that\nwe're looking at right now and thinking\nabout um um how specific is this this to\nfood is this true for lots of different\nthings what about exercise other other\nstressors that are you know potentially\nmore positive the amydala is able to\ndetect a lot of different signals from\nthe environment and we're not sure how\nall of that gets in there um so I think\none of the the detection of the\nenvironment has been you know really\nwell worked out in terms of our basic\nsensory modalities but think about the\nthings that really affect your emotions\nday-to- day at least for me as a human\nin this Society the things that affect\nmy emotions mostly today are almost\nentirely social interactions very subtle\nones ones that don't seem to threaten my\nlife or safety you know very small\nsubtle um social interactions are are\nwhat you know have the greatest bearing\nI think on um my emotional evaluation\nand my emotional bandwidth and what is\nthat how do we detect that how do we\nassemble this information apply all the\nNuance you know put on the onion layers\nof social programming to come out with\nwhatever you know I interpret this\ngesture to mean it's it's pretty\nincredible and so that's kind of where\nuh my research program has has been\nsliding such a interesting area let's\ndrill into it a bit um and to put it in\ncontext maybe um we talk about social\nmedia um so on social media um whether\nor not it's Instagram or X those are\nseem to be the two major platforms I'm\nnot on Tik Tok\num people say stuff sometimes they say\npositive things sometimes they see say\nnegative things sometimes they say\nthings that are sort of neutral um so it\nseems to me that nowadays if one is on\nthese social media platforms that we are\num we've sort of crowdsourced\nthis phenomenon of social interaction in\na way that we hadn't before because I I\ngrew up prior to the Advent of social\nmedia and I could bring my physical body\ninto certain environments and not others\neven at high school I could hang out we\nhad an area called the Batcave where you\nknow skateboarders and some other at\nthat time Misfits hung out with the quad\nwhere the cool kids hung out um Etc you\ncould you could pick your Niche okay\nsocial media is not like that you can\npick followers they can pick you Etc but\nI think since most people have social\nmedia nowadays seems or on there in some\nways that we've placed ourselves in the\ncenter of an arena which we have a ton\nof incoming input we all most of us have\namigdalas two of them amydala you\npointed out one on each side of the\nbrain and presumably we're on these\nplatforms to receive positive feedback\nand avoid negative feedback\nhowever there does seem to be a cohort\nof people who seem to like the friction\nof com combat or kind of let's just call\nit high friction interactions or\nmoderate friction interactions they like\nto argue they like to parse ideas it's\nnot all bad necessarily um so have you\never looked at social media in your in\nyour own mind looked at social media\nthrough the lens of of amydala filtering\nor through the lens of of neural circuit\nfiltering and kind of wondered um what's\ngoing on there that someone with without\nyour in-depth knowledge of these brain\ncircuitries would not think to uh look\nat that landscape through or maybe we\ncould just do that now as a as as a kind\nof play experiment I like that um so I a\nlot of people ask me about social media\nfrom the context of is this of is this\nsocial contact meaningful is this\npositive does this count does this help\nyou not feel lonely um and of course I\ndon't know the answer we haven't done\nthat particular study yet and I don't I\ndon't know of that specific study having\nbeen performed but my prediction um is\nthat it's not going to do much because I\nI believe that a key component of what I\nwould consider social contact heavily\ndepends on having some interbrain\nsynchron some interaction in in that is\nsynchronous and I think with social\nmedia sometimes there can be an engaging\ndialogue that plays out in near real\ntime but generally speaking it's\nasynchronous you're looking at things\nthat are happened that you're not a part\nof you're excluded from all these things\nthey happened in Australia yesterday and\nI'm on there saying cool love it and\nthen the person's already asleep yes\nexactly that's by asynchronous\nasynchronous like that we're not\nexperiencing things at the same time\nit's not a shared experience you know\nthat in in terms of that having that\nBond necessarily and so I've never\nactually been asked about how the\namydala processes social media um I\nguess I think what happens is you know\nthe amydala is just responding to\nstimuli sending up bottom up signals you\nknow it's a caricature of of um bottom\nup and top down processing let's give an\nexample that I'm I'm walking down the\nstreet and all of a sudden I hear like a\nreally ferocious dog barking at me all\ngoing crazy and then I get super scared\nand then I realize okay there's a fence\nso the amydala detect you know heard the\ndog barking hey there's a dog barking\nand you know I'm freaking out then my\nprefrontal cortex realizes there the F\nit looks very sturdy this fence looks\nstable and then I'm relaxing and I'm\nresuming my walking normally you know I\nthink that's sort of the dance that our\nbrain is doing when we have top down and\nbottom up uh information then we're\ntrying to stay focused so for me I think\nwhen I'm on social media there's so many\nstimuli that that are evoking responses\nand um to be completely transparent and\nI know this is not something that\neverybody else does or can do is\nnecessarily what's best for them but I\nwork very hard to control input from the\ntop down um in terms of I really really\nlimit the amount I I basically don't\ncheck email or go on social media I\nwould say I'm on social media or email\nless than one hour per week basically\nperek per week oh I have to say to that\nis congratulations we'll talk about\nsocial media again in a second but as a\nfellow Professor email once a week I've\nheard of people scheduling their times\nfor email responses but once a week that\nis awesome I have have people who help\nme get through it and filter out what's\nimportant but otherwise I just whenever\nI do my own email I say yes to all these\nthings then I make all these plans and\nthen I'm and then I'm have too many\ntrips and I'm responding fra fragmented\nfragmented and it's just you know\novercommit and I think um I know my\nlimits sometimes it's difficult ult for\nme to be in my amydala mode responding\nto stimuli and yet letting my prefrontal\ncortex do its thing so I've set some\nvery heavy prefrontal cortically\nselected limits of the input I put in so\nthat my brain can function and be clear\nI can't be creative I can't have\nepiphanies if there's all this clutter\nof like writing this person back and\nblah blah blah blah blah tweet tweet\nit's just you know trash out wipe\nsqueegee squeegee the brain down so that\nwe can actually grow something beautiful\nand new\nwell and I want to re-emphasize what I\nsaid in my introduction which is that I\nmean you are oh so productive and when I\nsay productive I don't just mean\nproductive like plug-and chug you you\nthe work you've done is incredibly\ncreative you transformed our\nunderstanding of what this famous\nstructure the amydala actually does I\nmean you've made so many important\ndiscoveries as a consequence of\npresumably other things but including\nwiping away all this incoming clutter as\nyou said controlling the top- down\ninputs I have to ask just from a\npractical standpoint during that one\nhour a week are you reading every email\nthat came in or are you just being very\nselective about which emails so you're\nnot opening most emails no I don't open\nmost emails amazing no I just I search\nfor the ones that my assistant\nidentifies as the one I need to open\nthere's like a list of things that i'\nwould be interested in and then we'll go\nthrough the list and then you know\nsometimes it requires me to go and find\nthe email and respond to my myself\nbecause it that is and then I would do\nthat for 10 you know 10 10 minutes a day\nor something do you recommend get out of\nthere as soon as I can love it um do you\npass on this advice to the people that\nyou train I think it depends on what\nresources and what's your what's the\nwhat's your job right now right so I\nthink um as a traine I definitely did my\nas a assistant professor I did my own\nemails but at a certain point um I was\njust never getting to the bottom and\nthen it would just stress me out make me\nfeel overwhelmed and what is my job my\njob is to number\none be a\nstable core of a sustainable research\nprogram and um that just requires me\nhaving a lot of mental health and\nwell-being and um and and\nclear-mindedness and I need to be able\nto come up with creative ideas I need to\nbe able to Sprint when there's a\ndeadline and I I just can't exhaust my\nsystem with\nunnecessary I would call them\nquadrant four in the time management\nquadrant if you're familiar with this\nyou know uh important urgent certain\nthings are urgent but not important some\nthings are Urgent some things are\nneither important nor urgent that's most\nemails are are like if you read time\nmanagement literature and you have the\nluxury to have someone else help you or\nsomething that's like so well trained to\nbe really good at cap chaptering things\nthat are important and you know\nsometimes I miss emails but emails are\nnot the way my traines would reach me\nthey would reach me in a different way\num and then emails are for everyone else\nthat I didn't give my number to you know\nI feel so honored to have have your\ncontact I'd like to take a brief moment\nand thank one of our sponsors and that's\nag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that also contains adaptogens I\nstarted taking ag1 way back in 2012 the\nreason I started taking it and the\nreason I still take it every day is that\nit ensures that I meet all of my quotas\nfor vitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in sufficient quantities so ag1\nallows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports\nso many different systems within the\nbody that are involved in mental health\nphysical health and performance to try\nag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and\nyou'll get a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman I think this is wonderful\nadvice for people to hear um we have a\nfuture guest on this podcast named Cal\nNewport he wrote the book deep work and\nhe has another book called A World\nWithout email he's a computer science\nprofessor at Georgetown where he talks\nextensively about the tremendous career\nbut also relationship and life value of\ndoing essentially what you're describing\nalthough I do think Kay that you\nrepresent kind of the extreme of what\nI've um become aware of in terms of\npeople that can limit the amount of time\non uh social media platforms and email\nanyway I just want to say um\ncongratulations I just want to say that\nagain and I think it even if people\ndon't reduce to one hour per week I\nthink that making some effort toward\nreducing the amount of incoming as you\nsaid controlling the top- down inputs to\nthe amydala but also to the rest of the\nbrain involved in Creative processing\nEtc is so key and we actually do have\nagency it's just it's it's tough um\nsometimes to build up that discipline so\nyou're doing a tremendous service by\nsharing that somebody as successful as\nyou does this presumably is successful\nin part because you do this could we by\nextension say that many people since\nbillions of people are on social media\nare likely um triggering the activation\nof their amygdala clouding out other\nmore potentially productive activation\nof their neural circuits by S just\nmaking themselves freely available to\nthe to the uh thoughts and words and\nimpulses of others I mean to me it seems\nthe answer would be yes but I'd like to\nknow what you think I mean I think um\nand there's something to be said there's\ndefinitely been moments where I've I've\nyou know gone a deep into social media\nand spent more time in a certain burst\nright that is isolated and I think that\nthere's a lot to be learned from social\nmedia so to actually to bring it back to\none point you mentioned earlier um on\nsocial media sometimes people Pro just\nwant accolades and sometimes there's a\nlot of of friction one of the reasons I\nstay on social media even though I'm\nmaking this big effort to sort of\ndeclutter my Consciousness is because of\nthat feedback especially when you know\nfor someone like you I imagine this has\ngot to be super true and even for me at\na certain point in my career it just\nfelt like people don't want to tell me\nbad news to my face as much anymore\neverybody's so positive all the time and\nyou know what they what are they really\nthinking and social media allows you the\nprotection of anonymity to say what you\nreally think without um consequence\nessentially and so on the oneand the\nconsequence-free\num nature of being able to just say\nthings can be very dangerous but at the\nsame time for me I really value just\nbeing able to receive it I I'm you know\nI'm a big girl I can filter out what I\nwant when I get the all the inputs but\nif I don't receive the inputs sometimes\nit's hard to learn from the feedback I'm\nnot getting so even sometimes feedback\nis given in a not very nice way I can\nstill create a model for someone else\nthat has this perspective that I can\ntake with me and that can be another\nperspective I can honor easily in the\nfuture because I have this theory of\nmind for someone some someone would get\nupset about that uh you know that's\nsomething that could be harmful to\npeople who are think you know have this\ntheory of mind so I think it's super\nvaluable from that perspective and\nthat's why I continue to use\nit great yeah I I really applaud that as\nwell I I always read my teaching evals\nbecause they're Anonymous and yes I do\nwonder you know what grade the different\nuh people who gave different evals you\nknow got I don't know that information I\nsometimes wonder do they attend the\nclass or they just angry they didn't do\nwell on the exam but that really\nrepresents the small fraction of\nfeedback that I'm um that I wonder about\nmost of it um that's valuable to me is\nthe hey you know liked the course but\nthese parts really sucked Professor\nhuberman or this part was completely\nunclear or completely hated the way you\nblank blank and blanked because that\nfeedback is something I can really work\nwith to improve so I think um course EV\nvals are are similar to what you're\ndescribing I think there's value there\nif I were to just look at the the\npositive feedback and then ignore the\nnegative feedback and write those people\noff then I don't think I could improve\nas a teacher actually I always encourage\ncomments and feedback and suggestions in\nthe YouTube comments for this podcast\nfor that reason and I do read the\ncomments I go through and I read and um\na few of them sting um but you know the\npositive feedback is great too sometimes\nit's more of this please y or less of\nthat please I think there there's\ninformation in that um so I think it\nsounds like you've been doing all of\nthese things naturally I so so actually\nthen uh since I've had my research group\nmy my lab um we do an anonymous lab\nsurvey every it's supposed to be about\nevery 18 months and then it's a whole\nlong process of going through it and\nit's just evolved it's I think it's the\nfourth or fifth time we've done it and\nso it's now I think it's like 70\nquestions it's so many question we got\nmaybe we should we should trim it down\nbut it it ends up being hundreds of\npages of of text you know short answer\nsometimes long answer feedback from\nanonymously from people in my lab my lab\nis pretty big so it's it's you know I'm\nnot even trying to really guess who is\nsaying it it's just feedback and it\ntakes me months to go through with it\nand and get all the feedback and it is\nso useful I mean in a class the the the\namount of contact that you have is it's\nit's restricted to this very specific\ntime and space whereas when you're\nmentoring someone over the course of\nyears there's a lot of different\nthere's a lot of different points of of\ncontent and interaction and you know\nyou're in the lab all 40 hours a week or\nwhatever and you know going trip meeting\nhere there's just a lot of different\ndifferent ways to improve and ways we've\nnever you know I haven't had any\ntraining in how to be a really great\nmentor and so I'm getting that training\nnow I'm making my own course and my\nmentees are my teachers and um I really\nam grateful for the the tutelage that\nthey provide for free in this anonym\nmust lab survey sometimes it makes me\ncry but sometimes it makes me feel\nreally good about something that I'm\ndoing that's working and in any case it\nmakes me feel that I have ground truth I\nguess I still don't know but when people\nsay things that sting um it makes me\nfeel like they're saying what they\nreally think and they're not holding\nback it doesn't you know and um bad news\nfeels like reality and so that is very\nsomething about that is rewarding\num just to feel like I have reality\nrather than I'm getting something else\nyou know that the model doesn't quite\nfit it's very unsatisfying with the\nmodel doesn't quite fit so I love the\nword ground truth there's something so\nbeautiful to that and I I resonate with\num what you're\nsaying let's go back to social\ninteraction something that your lab is\ndoing um lots of work on nowadays and\nmaybe we could shift to the sorts of\nsocial interaction that most of us are\nfamiliar with with the um sitting across\nthe table having a coffee with somebody\nthe taking a walk with somebody maybe a\nphone call yeah um maybe a tough\nconversation um maybe a playful you know\num you know unscripted conversation um\nmaybe a meal at a holiday dinner you\nknow there's a huge range there what\nwhat do we know about the value of\nsocial\ninteraction at the level of sort of core\nbiological needs like at the level of\nneural circuits and maybe even hormones\nI mean you know most people have heard\nof oxytocin they think the love hormone\nbut it's there's so much more there for\npeople to understand and know about you\nknow how important is this thing that we\ncall social interaction and how bad do\nthings get when we're not getting the\nright kinds of social interaction you\nknow I think this is this is a great\nquestion and I'm glad that it's become\nsomething that has been recognized at a\nmore global a national scale just the\nimportance of of having social support\nin our lives for heal for our well-being\num but social isolation or even just\nperceived loneliness has immense Health\nconsequences for all social species so\num shortened\nlifespan\nincreased mood\ndisorders um increased actually\nmorbidity and mortality for disease like\ncancer or heart disease that you know um\nmight not be what we would normally\nthink and so I think understanding how\neach of those processes is happening\nthose mechanisms are far from being\nworked out but the the correlational\nevidence is undeniable we're now taking\nthis into the lab really for the first\ntime and so something so simple as\nsocial isolation how can we don't know\nway more about it and um I'm someone who\nstumbled into the field field of social\nisolation by accident prior to the\npandemic and so I'll just say you know\nthe whole story on why there's such a\ngaping hole in our knowledge as a\nneuroscience Community about social\nisolation really comes from Harry haro's\nwork this original work of maternal\nseparation that was undeniably cruel it\nit caused irreparable damage to these\nbaby monkeys and they never recovered\nand sorry to interrupt apologize I'm\nstriving to not interrupt in my life but\nI but so that people are on on board um\ncould you just briefly describe the\nharlo experiments yes so they're very\nfamous experiments where they separated\nuh baby monkeys from their moms and then\nhad either a wire sort of thing holding\na bottle so okay what what do you miss\nmost about the mom is it the wire is it\nthe food or is it the the the comfort\nand then they had\nso they had a wire thing with with a\nmilk bottle versus you know blankets and\ncuddly soft things and and the the baby\nmonkeys would go to the cuddly soft\nthing but you know a blanket is not a\nreplacement for a mother nobody's saying\nthat it is and and through these\nexperiments there was extended maternal\nseparation and it's it it was deemed\ncruel um there was permanent irreparable\ndamage when you when you rehouse these\nmonkeys they never resocialized normally\nthey had lots of different mental and\nphysical health problems um and I think\nin humans we know that so you know\nsolitary confinement is considered\ntorture um you know social isolation is\na difficult thing to study in in a lot\nof\nconditions and we stumbled onto it by\ncomplete accident through working with a\npostto a former postdoc in my lab\nJullian Matthews who was a graduate\nstudent um doing an experiment on on it\nwas just trying to figure out if these\ndopamine neurons um would also respond\nto cocaine the way VTA these sorry these\nvental tegmental area dopamine earons\nwere known to respond to cocaine wanted\nto see if these other dopamin respond to\ncocaine so sort of a incremental study\nso when you do these cocaine studies you\nyou inject the animal with cocaine or\nsaline and they leave the naive animal\nin the cage and then you take brain\nslices record from the neurons and look\nat the synaptic strengths and so you\nknow the expected outcome sort of was\nthat these dopamine NS would would be\nsimilar to other dopamine nands that\nshowed in you know long- lasting\npotentiation after a single dose of\ncocaine but what happened instead was\nthat yes there was potentiation in the\ncocaine animals there's also\npotentiation in the saline animals\nrelative to the naive group and this was\na huge puzzle what was this and it\nturned out through many many different\nexperiments um that it's actually\nbecause when you inject animals with\ncocaine you're separating them from the\ngroup they I act all crazy and this is\nwhat the way people did the experiment\nso you inject them with saline you\nseparate them the naive animals just\nstay there so with their other their\nother litter mates I see so the control\ngroup The saling control group is\nactually a social isolation condition so\nby accident this control group that\ndidn't make sense was how we stumbled\nonto so then we tried is it novel cage\nit's not the novel cage it's the it's\nthe social isolation and so um that is\nhow we became a lab that studied social\nisolation it was complete accident we\nweren't sure what what we were looking\nat and then um we man we found these\nneurons and we manipulate these neurons\nand they\nproduced um something very different\nthan other dopamine neurons which\nnormally if you stimulate dopamine\nneurons these ventral tental area\nmid-brain dopam like 90% of the time\nwhen you you hear people talk about\ndopamine they mean these ones and\nthey're the ones where you press a lever\nstimulate the nerves we'll press a lever\nthousands of times you know and they\nlove to be stimulated yes and if if\nyou're a human and you do cocaine you\nyou most people love cocaine they they\nwant they're very pro-social when\nthey're on cocaine and so that's what\ndopamine neurons were thought to be\ndoing but these other dopamine neurons\nin the dorsal rap that I will also say\nis in the brain stem near to an aqueduct\nwhere you could detect signals from the\nbody um but these other dopamine neurons\nin the raap they when you stimulate them\nanimals don't like it they will not work\nfor reward they actually will move away\nfrom a space that's where they're being\nstimulated you know condition place and\nreal-time Place aversion I don't like\nthe feeling of these neurons being\nactivated please stop it and yet they\nwould be pro-social and so for a long\ntime this was super confusing we\ncouldn't understand it and then just\nbecause at the same time we had a um a\nhunger study going on in the lab we just\nthought about it like I can eat food\nbecause it's delicious and I I want to\neat this yummy treat or I can eat\nbecause I'm super hungry I feel shaky\nI'm just to eat this nasty fiber bar out\nof my backpack CU I'm so desperate and I\nneed like I need my my blood sugar is\ndangerously low you know and so there's\ntwo reasons that you can eat and one of\nthem is uncomfortable hunger is not\ncomfortable you don't it's not a good\nfeeling to be hungry and so we thought\nabout this and that's kind of how we\ncircularly came around to thinking I\nthink we've discovered the loneliness\nneurons essentially and so what is\nloneliness and loneliness is this\nunpleasant need state of wanting social\ncontact that would have this\npro-social effect as well and so um\nthat's basically the very serendipitous\nloop-de-loop way that I came to be um uh\nstudying how loneliness is represented\nin the brain amazing before we talk a\nbit more about these loneliness neurons\nand some of their inputs and outputs in\nthe brain\num how has the discovery of these\nneurons um perhaps changed the way that\nyou organize your day and week and life\nright um if at all um for instance are\nyou more aware of how much time you\nspend alone versus with others are you\num more careful or Discerning about who\nyou spend your time with um you know I I\nasked this um because you know there's\nso many examples for me in the\nNeuroscience literature where you know I\nlearned something new about how the\nbrain works and I think oh yeah you know\nit makes a lot of sense why my sleep\nisn't great you know it turns out that\nlight exposure to the eyes at particular\ntimes of day really sets the whole body\nand brain into particular rhythms that\nyou know explain why I was a little\ndepressed when I was in graduate school\nstaying up all night doing experiments\nand I'd sleep much of the day and feel\nlike I was getting eight nine hours I\ndon't get eight to nine hours now but um\nyou know and when I wake up early for me\npersonally there's a bit of an\nanti-depressant effect as long as I\nslept the night before seasonal effect\ndisorder is real right so you know I\nthink as new information comes online um\nat least for me it's it's changed the\nway that I organize my life to to s in\nsubtle or or in not so subtle ways so\nthe idea that there are neurons in the\nbrain that encode loneliness the absence\nof social contact does that have you\nthinking you know after a few days of\nmanaging the lab uh with which as you\npoint out you have a very large lab lots\nof social interaction but it's work\ncontext social interaction does that um\nhas that led you to think hey you know\nwe should go out to dinner as a lab or I\nshould spend time with somebody who's\nnot in science um or I should spend time\nby myself because I've had too much\nsocial interaction I'm not asking for\nstrict protocols here I'm just wondering\nif you're willing to get um like play in\nthe sandbox of this with me a bit um how\nthis information perhaps has shaped some\nof your choices you personally and and\nbe very clear I'm not asking you to\ndictate what other people do um has it\nchanged your social life so it's really\ninteresting that you ask this question\nand now that you you know now that\nyou're asking it this way\num I I mean of course when I learn new\nthings I I I um take them and Implement\nthem into my life but to be honest in in\nthe cycle of of of you know learning and\nstudying and being curious and I\nactually think where I reside more is\nwhen something's going on with me my\nresearch program you know research is\nresearch it becomes what the re it\ndictates what the research program\nevolves into and so for ex for example\nso I've just had started studying\nloneliness um a few years before the\npandemic hit and then the pandemic hit\nand it was just a step function like\nchange I went from I'm never alone\nunless you call being in an Uber Alone\num or being on a plane and and and just\nyou know constantly people in my office\neven when I'm going to the bathroom\nsomeone's waiting for me outside like\nyou know I'm not it's like I'm hurrying\nin the bathroom I'm never alone there's\nlike four people in my bed kicking me in\nthe face I'm just you know there's just\nso much Social contact and then boom you\nknow there would\nbe a day I wouldn't see another like you\nknow just the a not zero but just\nextremely sudden drop of social contact\nwhen there's no more work and you know\nit was just that that period of time\nand it was it was very depressing it was\njust this huge I felt like I was in\nfreef fall and it made me you know at\nfirst it was really disruptive and I was\nworried about myself you know and then\nat some point I adjusted to it and then\nI got used to working from home I got\nstarted a garden like I got all this you\nknow I got you know I just started a\ndifferent life pattern that involved a\nlot of alone time and you know something\nan alone time personal life AG grew\nwhere there wasn't any space for\nanything to grow before and then I\nbecame comfortable with it and so then I\nstarted thinking about that that's\nreally where the idea of social\nhomeostasis was born this idea that okay\nwhy is it with acute social isolation\nhumans monkeys mice you know you acutely\nisolate the individual from the social\ngroup you reintroduce them to the social\ngroup rebound of pro-social interaction\noh so happy to see you there's like all\nthese affiliative interactions a Hu a\nburst of affiliative interactions\nwhereas with chronic social isolation in\nhumans monkeys mice even\nflies you reintroduced into the social\ngroup and you get territorial Behavior\naggression avoidance antisocial behavior\num or just you know sort of a very\ndifferent negative veillance response to\nthe exposure to the group and so this\nmaybe people brushed it off for a long\ntime is just oh it's confusing this\nliterature is inconsistent or maybe\nthere's one model that makes it all make\nsense that is social home homeostasis\nwhere you know you're used to getting\nthis at a certain point and so my\naffector system gets activated I I\ndetect that I'm alone it's I want more\nthe deficits detected then my affector\nsystems gets activated this and then I\nstart spinning all the systems that try\nto get me back into contact I'm calling\nmy friends I'm texting my friend I'm I'm\nif I'm a mouse I'm making ultrasonic\nvocalizations I'm exploring outside of\nthe burrow and then you know if my\nfriends don't call me back they're like\nsorry we don't want to see anyone till\nend of covid bye whatever it is you know\nyou it's it's not working my correction\nefforts are failing or maybe a certain\namount of time we don't know then I give\nup I stop I stop calling I stop going\nout I just make a different life you\nknow you the the the they don't you\ndon't leave the burrow whatever it is\nand there's in in animal and humans at\nleast behaviorally there's a near step\nfunction like drop off of attempts to\nyou know you can see sort of dat oh then\nthey just give up on dating after this\none you know whatever happens there's\nsome some straw that breaks the camels\nback and then this person doesn't want\nto date anymore or doesn't want to go\nout anymore whatever and and what is\nthat so that adaptation then you're at a\nnew Baseline you're You're Expecting now\nyour new normal I'm I'm expecting to\nhave a gardening day at home alone not\nsee anyone and then and then a bunch of\npeople come over feels like a surplus so\nmy previous Optimum you know\nreintroduction to the social\ngroup is now feeling like a surplus an\noverload overstimulated and that's I\nthink something that a lot of people\nexperience this Whiplash of going into\nthe pandemic and coming out of it\ndifferent people to different levels it\ndepends on how much you you know\nisolated while you were in the pandemic\nbut I think thinking about um your\nsocial set point as being flexible and\ndynamic Was A New Concept to me and then\nin my mind the question is what is the\npart of this process that is causing all\nthese harmful Health consequences like\nshorten lifespan mood disorders Etc is\nit the initial detection that I'm\nmissing something and affect your system\nactivation because if that was the case\nmaybe I want to Band-Aid that you know\nmaybe I want to get get a pet get a get\na get a zoom buddy I don't know what you\nknow you would have different\nprescriptions and advice to give people\nthat were the case versus you would give\nalmost opposite advice if the thing\nthat's causing it is the the set point\nadaptation then you want to you want to\nsave it off versus if you wanted to\naccelerate getting into the set point\nwhich is better you know is it the\nadaptation or is it you know kind of\ntrying to fix it and so in one case you\nwould want to ease off the the having\nthe set point happen the set point\ntransition happen in the other case rip\nit off like a Band-Aid cold turkey Just\nAdjust and then you'll be fine you know\nthen you won't worry about it then you\nwon't be lonely anymore cuz you'll just\nbe comfortable being alone you know\npeople talk about cognitive flexibility\num and I think it's it's sort of like\nthat but it's social flexibility I want\nto be able to be alone I also want to be\nable to be in a large group and be\ncomfortable and so I think what I've\ndone if anything to change my lifestyle\num to accommodate these new insights\nI've had is is to\nconsciously create Dynamic social\nexperience\nlots of social experiences yes but also\nprotecting alone time which I never did\nbefore I just I just just gave it all\naway and you know I realized that having\nthat just made my social homeostatic\nsystem feel more elastic and flexible\nand resilient and less like a crisis if\nsomething you know I'm I'm very\ncomfortable being alone I'm super\ncomfortable with my own skin now and it\nrequires investing in that relationship\nI like how you framed uh earlier I think\nwe were not not recording yet but the\nrelationship with yourself as being a\nvery important relationship and um when\nI think about brain States you know we\ndon't know this yet but my working model\nwould be that different individuals we\nrepresent their identities and whenever\nthey're present it creates a unique\nEnsemble of that combination of people\nbeing present and being alone is also a\nunique state that cannot be achieved I\nhave the brain state of being alone I\ncannot achieve it if anyone else is\naround\nand that's just what you know that's\nkind of the working model I have I think\nwhat you're saying is uh essential for\npeople to hear because um it makes sense\nthat loneliness would hurt um it makes\nsense that some people are more\nextroverted which I think is defined as\ngetting energy from social interactions\nand resetting energy through social\ninteractions as opposed to introverted\nwhich by the way folks introverts like\nmyself do enjoy social interaction it's\njust that we reset through more um Solo\nor one-on-one time than we do in larger\ngroups that's my understanding of the\nintroversion extroversion literature we\ncan revisit that but this notion of\nsocial homeostasis is I think so key uh\nimportant enough that I think we\nprobably want\nto redefine it um as many times or\nrestate it rather as many times as it's\nnecessary because I believe what you're\ndescribing is the same thing that one\nwould experience with food if we eat a\nlot we're consuming I know 3500 calories\na day and then um suddenly we only have\naccess to 1,800 calories a day there's\nit feels like a deficit because indeed\nit is whereas after some period of time\nat 1,800 calories a day 2200 calories a\nday feels like relative abundance\nrelative abundance\num when the pandemic hit I certainly um\nwas unhappy about the State of Affairs\nin the world of course um but I recall\nfeeling like oh my goodness I finally\ndon't have to commute 90 minutes in each\ndirection to Stanford because I lived in\nthe East Bay at that time um I felt like\nI had time to do things I hadn't done in\na long time and thanks to zoom I was\nable to get certain things done not\nothers then after about six to eight\nmonths when I realized this is going to\ncarry on for a while I remember feeling\nquite lonely and making some efforts to\nrepair that I I\nthink social media not to harp on social\nmedia um could do either one of two\nthings and I don't know which in the\ncontext of uh social\nhomeostasis either going on Instagram\nand seeing a lot of familiar faces and\ncomments and accounts could make me feel\nlike I'm getting some social interaction\nsuch that then when I close that app and\nmove to my work at my desk or something\nuh which these days is mostly done um\nsolo um that I would feel like I had\nsocial interaction or perhaps it's the\nequivalent of um\ncalories that um then makes me feel more\nisolated when I'm not in the app\nperhaps I find it to be distinctly\ndifferent than like the experience I had\nlast night of going to dinner with\nsomeone I know quite well sitting down\nand having a open-ended conversation and\ndeciding to close out the night only\nwhen we realized you know we got to get\nup tomorrow for work so went our\nseparate ways um there's something that\nfelt very s ating about it so I wonder\nin this context of social homeostasis\nwhether or not the analogy of social\ninteraction to caloric intake if we\ncould is there another dimension to it\nwhere it's not just the total number of\ncalories or the total amount of social\ninteraction but the quality of social\ninteraction the type of social\ninteraction that actually feels like\nnourishment as opposed to just calories\nI love where you're going with this and\nand so um when we wrote this review the\nfirst time we know we're we're conceptu\nthis idea of of how your social set\npoint can change based on if if you're\nacutely isolated or or chronically\nisolated and\num the Y AIS is the quality quantity of\ndetected social contact which is so\nfuzzy and you know there's it's it's\nagain one of the most challenging\nfrontiers of this field because how even\nif we measure every single component\nthat the brain can detect of the social\nthe social contact so much of it is\nabout expectation you know like if I\nthink I got a gesture if if I get a nod\nfrom the president I'm like oh my god\ndid the president just nod at me that's\nso exciting versus if I get a nod from\nmy partner I'm like oh my God are they\nmad at me what's going on why why did I\njust get a nod right it totally matters\nthe gesture you need the identity\nthere's many\ndifferent cognitive systems that need to\nall plug in to this wheel um\nto make it spin so I think that uh that\nis one of the the I I think that's going\nto keep us busy for a\nwhile but in terms of your question\nabout social media and when you switch\nfrom you know getting social media\nfeedback and then doing work um I think\nI think it really depends I mean social\nmedia is such a large category you can\nhave many different types of responses\ngenerally I think the bounds so you know\nwhen you say social media versus real\nlife interaction where you're with\nsomeone maybe you're touching maybe\nyou're not touching but even if you're\nhaving conversation um you have\ninterbrain synchrony you are um having a\nlot of interbrain syn you're in the same\nplace if but you can have interbrain\nsynchrony even on the phone right just a\nvoice call is actually a lot more\ninterbrain synchrony than than messages\nI think I think text messages can bring\na lot of anxiety and there's been a lot\nof commentary about that um and same\nthing with with with social media I\nthink the the thing about social media\nthat is perhaps um the\nmost harmful or NE negative I think in\nterms of I when I'm thinking about\nsocial nourishment if I you know sort of\nmaking that term up on the Fly here but\num it's it's almost a withdrawal when\nsocial media is posted it's not to you\nit's to everyone and you could be one of\nthe people that receives this message\nbut it's not even what to you I'm not\nnot even talking to you and I'm doing\nsomething that's without you otherwise\nyou'd be in this picture and not reading\non social media listening to whatever so\nit's like by almost exclusively you're\nyou're posting about activities that\nyou're being excluded from and someone's\nnot even really talking to you unless\nthey're D you know direct messaging you\nbut then I I kind of consider that a\ndifferent category if it's like a\nonetoone communication social media to\nme is is a blast right it's not it's\njust you know catching up with someone\non social media I I don't really see the\nMerit of it because is I'll just catch\nup with them when I catch up with them\nand their kids will just be like way\nolder but you know I don't know I'll\nactually really catch up with them then\njust see pictures of you know I don't\nknow I I feel mixed about it because\nit's not a real connection and it\ndoesn't for me Sate my social appetite\nto catch up with to to look at someone\nelse's profile on on social media um\nthat doesn't actually do anything for\nthe the connection I I don't know but I\nseriously doubt tons of oxytocin is\nreleased when I you know follow\nsomeone's feed about their vacation so I\ndon't know I would I think that it\ndefinitely matters the quality and\nsocial media is is different than real\nlife interactions for many reasons I'd\nlike to take a quick break and thank our\nsponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals now\nI've long been a believe lever in\ngetting regular blood work done for the\nsimple reason that many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate and long-term\nHealth can only be analyzed from a\nquality blood test a major problem with\na lot of blood tests out there however\nis that you get information back about\nmetabolic factors lipids and hormones\nand so forth but you don't know what to\ndo with that information with inside\ntracker they make it very easy because\nthey have a personalized platform that\nallows you to see the levels of all\nthose things metabolic factors lipids\nhormones Etc but it gives you specific\ndirectives that you can follow that\nrelate to nutrition behavioral\nmodifications supplements Etc that can\nhelp you bring those numbers into the\nranges that are optimal for you if you'd\nlike to try insid tracker you can go to\ninsid tracker.com huberman to get 20%\noff any of insid tracker's plans again\nthat's insid\ntracker.com huberman I really appreciate\nyour willingness to uh explore in this\nuh in this context I\nthink your mention of the fact that um\nreal life interaction involves\ninterbrain synchrony could be by text\nscaling up from that by phone um\nFaceTime or something akin to that video\nvideo chat um on social media there is\ncomments back and forth um although\nthat's timec consuming and it's\ndifficult because there's anonymity\npeople are in different places different\ntime zones if you don't know someone\nit's different context um so I'm really\nthanks to what you're describing I'm\nreally starting to think about social\nmedia as so different than in-person\nsocial interactions or by phone or video\nchat social interactions and how those\nwould differentially impact social\nhomeostasis and it's leading me at least\nto conclude that at least for me that\nmost social media interactions would\ncreate more\nhunger as opposed to a um sting of of\nthe need for social interaction it's um\nI have to be careful with the analogies\nhere but since I can do this I I was\nalmost going to make analogy between um\nporn pornography\nuhhuh inperson sexual intimacy I suppose\nthere's something in between where\npeople could talk by phone but we don't\nwant to explore this in any kind of\nsalacious way and then um sexual\nintimacy with with uh with emotion with\npositive emotion right those there's a\nscaling Factor there and I'm not P I'm\nnot putting um judgment or veilance I'm\nI'm certainly not that's not my place as\na good friend of mine says I'm not a cop\nyou know I'm not telling people what to\ndo they can't do but it's so interesting\nto think about these um these circuits\nwithin us that create these what you and\nI in our field call repetitive the\ndesire for or aversive the desire to\nmove away from type responses and how so\nmuch of our life aside from you because\nyou're regulating your social media and\nyour uh and your email intake but so\nmuch of Life Now is offering us the\nopportunity to um tickle these circuits\nor even hit them hard with a\nsledgehammer but we're not thinking\nabout these homeostatic mechanisms of\nwhether or not they're creating more\nhunger for or more satisfaction from\nyeah and I I I cannot emphasize enough\nhow critical this is and I think that's\nbecause you know I'm somebody who does\nspend a fair amount of time on social\nmedia a lot of my my work exists on\nsocial media YouTube Etc and I would\nhope that the work that we're putting\ninto the world with this podcast is\ncreating a a satiation of the desire for\ninformation rather than a Hunger for\nMore I do hope that but I recognize that\neducational material on social media\nrepresents the the a tiny tiny fraction\nof what's there so social homeostasis I\nthink is a term that if people haven't\nalready stamped into their mind they\nshould be stamping into their mind and\nand Dr K Tai deserves credit for that I\ndon't uh I will say that so you don't\nhave to\num I've heard you say before you wrote\nin a review something akin to social\ncontact is either positive or negative\nwhen it's deficient or in excess which\nis I think what you're describing is is\nsocial homeostasis is that right when we\ntalked about the quality and quantity um\nthere's just in terms of contact just\namount of contact there's such a thing\nas just the right amount there's some\nthing is too little there's such a thing\nas too much there's overcrowding right\nit doesn't matter who it it can be your\nfamily it could just sometimes it's like\na lot maybe your family depends depend\nyou know the famous ROM dos quote no\nthink you're enlightened go spend a\nweekend with your\nparents no no disrespect Mom and Dad I\nknow right um but\num I think with quality it matters so\nmuch like I was sort of saying before\nyou know the same gesture from the\npresident or my partner it's going to\nfeel very different to me whether that\nwas a slight or uh you know it's just\nit's relative to what is appropriate for\nour rank for our prior history\nrelationships for you know the the\nenvironmental context and so I think\nwith social media in general and I agree\nsocial media is great for a lot of\nthings I mean I and I I I think that\nhaving a podcast like this that is\naccessible to the public makes research\nmore sustainable so I have a lot of\nthings to say about science\ncommunication that I'm very you know\ngrateful for but in terms of social\nmedia think about the mutual investment\nwhen you are interacting with someone on\nsoci social media what are they\ninvesting in this connection so if I put\nout a post about my vacation that is\npublic I'm investing\n00000000000000 one% of my bandwidth to\nmake contact with you you know what I\nmean and so it's it it scales up from\nthem if if you're making a voice call\nwith someone you're giving them at least\nmost of your attention for the time that\nyou're on the call that's a lot right\nwhereas you know so so just thinking\nabout the investment is another\ncomponent there's the real time\ncomponent and then there's the the\ninvestment component who is it coming\nfrom it matters if you're anonymous I\nreally I cannot tell what this means you\nknow a compliment from an or or a hate\nhate comment or a love comment from\nAnonymous\nperson I don't know what to do with this\nyou like I just literally don't know how\nto you know it doesn't really doesn't\nreally do anything for me because I\ndon't know how to interpret it it's\nalmost you know uninterpretable without\nthis other dimension that my brain is\nhas evolved to look for I think so\nthat's you know\nspeculation but I think social media is\nis operating in a way that that is not\nethological and not designed to make us\nfeel better it's just designed to make\nus want to use it and I think a lot of\nthis comes down to things that are\nrelative you know there's the famous um\nthere's the famous observations if of a\nm monkey sees Another Monkey get a\ncucumber it's happy with the Cucumber\nbut if a monkey sees the other monkey\nget great grape monkey wants grape you\nknow you want you want to keep up with\nthe Joneses you want what if you see\nsomeone else having something suddenly\nit feels like a loss that you don't have\nit that you didn't even think that of\nthis thing that you needed right and so\nI think social media is exposing you to\na lot of things that you don't you know\nthat it's it's like this this parameter\nspace you didn't have there's all these\nthings you didn't know you were missing\nthat you didn't need to miss out on and\nso we have this whole project now we\nhave two projects one that's looking at\nsocial isolation and following what\nhappens with social isolation across the\ntime course to try to understand is it\nthe amount of time or is it the amount\nof effort that you put into correcting\nthat deficit um that that makes you\nleads you to the giving up you know kind\nof state change and another project that\num is about the quality of social\ncontact specifically social exclusion so\na different kind of deficit you're with\nyour other animals but there's this this\nyou know it's four animals that have um\nare cagemates and um three animals are\non one side able to drink a chocolate\nmilkshake and the other animals ex\nexcluded and this one excluded animal\nwill go up against the the divider and\nand you know look look frantic and you\nknow ex exhibit lots of behaviors that\nwe would associate in humans with fear\nof missing out trying to reunite with\nthe group trying to get the attention of\nthe group trying to get over there a lot\nof attending looks\nfrantic and studying what we think is\nactually going on and so I think that I\nthink coming up with paradigms to try to\nprobe social isolation and we don't even\nknow what behaviors animals exhibit when\nthey're lonely this is this is a\nchallenging field because there's no\nnumber of lever presses you know there's\nno there's no script to follow and\nthere's no trial structure and so for a\nneuroscientist NE neur scientists were\ntrained to be rigorous about our\nstatistics because of the stochastic\nnature of neural neural activity and you\nknow how do we process things without a\ntrial structure how do we be\nstatistically rigorous when the animal\nis just free floating deciding whatever\nit wants to do and so that is kind of\nThe Crucible that my lab is is working\nthrough right now to establish pipelines\nand techniques and ways to\nquantify social behavor avors and peel\noff all the\nlayers I love where your lab is headed\nwhich just means we're going to have to\nhave you back on here again at some\npoint in the future to get the answers\nto those questions that you're now\naddressing I've long thought that we\nreally know how we feel about somebody\nwhen something good happens to them or\nfor them and I never quite understood\nthis at the level of mechanisms how\ncould I it's not more my lab studies but\nyou know I think that there's a natural\nsort of empathy if one is a healthy uh\nempathic person to seeing a member of\nour own species and hopefully uh also to\nobserving the members of other species\num you know experiencing some discomfort\nwe don't like that nor should we so\nanother human is in emotional pain right\num you know the whale or the Cry of loss\nis like one that just I think for any\nperson who's empathically attuned is\njust like uh or an animal you hear an\nanimal in pain like goodness I mean I'm\nnot here to diagnose sociopathy but if\nif that doesn't evoke a at least some\nsort of response of like oh gosh like\nwhat I wouldn't do to remove that pain\nthat their pain is your pain empathy um\nthat seems like a very reflexive circuit\nor at least I would hope so um but when\nsomebody experiences something positive\nI think it's normal and healthy to to\nhave a um a graded set of responses if\nit's somebody that we really love um we\nmay not even know them we think yeah\nlike you're you just reflexively happy\nfor them um somebody that we dislike I\nthink there's a more natural tendency to\nbe like oh you know right you know as as\nopposed to if that person were in pain I\nwould like to think that even if one\ndidn't like them that you would think\nlike oh that that sucks I'm really sorry\nto hear that um so I feel like there's\nsome asymmetry in these empathic\ninteractions they're both empathy one\nhas negative veilance pain the other one\nhas positive veilance another member of\nour species or other species receiving\nreward and we can Delight in that I mean\nI I'm almost embarrassed to admit how\nmany freret and Otter and raccoon\naccounts I follow because I love seeing\nthem eat I love seeing the little hands\nof the raccoons there's some great\nraccoon accounts by the way um and I\nDelight in it I like Delight in it I\nwant to see the raccoons win I don't\nknow why I just I love animals and so I\nsuppose that's why um so do you think\nthat there that we are asymmetrically\nwired for this empathic Attunement um\ncan we observe that in other animals I\nrealize this might not be squarely in\nthe Wheelhouse of what your lab is\nfocusing on but I think it it relates\nenough to the topics that we're covering\ntoday that just you know if you'd like\nto speculate um uh on what might be\ngoing on there yeah I I I can definitely\nspeculate something that we think about\na lot but again you know I there's some\nthere's some level of this which is\nsemantics um I think of empathy as being\ndefined as being able to understand\nanother animal's emotion and also taking\nit on so I think um something that's a\nlittle bit different than emotional\ncontagion right I see a panic I'm going\na group with P it's not the same thing\nas uh as as empathy um empathy is often\nused in in sort of certain contexts like\nfeeling sorry for someone and it's maybe\ndifferent if for feeling happy for\nsomeone and this is something I was just\ntalking about with one of my graduate\nstudents the other day why is there is\nis there an\nasymmetry in in empathy for positive and\nnegative or is it just what we've\nstudied it's easier to study this so\nthere's a number of you know we don't\nknow the answer but I guess another\nconceptual framework to put out there\nI'm not saying it's correct it's I think\njust a a good tool for debate but um\nit's not so much that there's good\npeople and bad people and that good\npeople are empathic and bad people\naren't uh so you it's not quite so\nsimple I I guess the way I think about\nit is whether you view this other social\nagent as having\naligned goals or agendas as you or are\nthey adversarial so if they're if\nthey're in in your alliance whatever\nthat means broadly defined versus\nadversarial you would have a different\nfeeling and you know it's it's you see\nthis I guess I was just I was just\nwatching this okay this is just sort of\noversharing but this is a podcast not a\na primary research Journal so I can just\nsay things right so I I watch some trash\nTV sometimes and you know these reality\ncompetition shows where it's like then\nyou vote the two best friends into\nelimination and they have to they have\nto eliminate each other mildly sadistic\nbut you know then they're best friends\nand they like like they you know and\nthen it's basically mutually exclusive\neither you can care about your friend\nand feel bad not wanting to send them\nhome\nor you you kick it you just you know you\nit's game time and you you you\nand so you can see different individuals\nwrestling with these two brain States\nand and how to like what to do but they\nare essentially you know my my my\nspeculation is that viewing someone as a\ncompetitor and they're an adversary they\nare standing in the way of me getting\nwhat I want you empathy goes down it's\nlike inversely correlated to empathy if\nyou are viewed as a competitor so things\nthat would contribute to you creating a\nmodel where an in a social agent it is\nan adversary as opposed to an a\npotential ally is really what it's going\nto come down to to the degree that you\nfeel empathy you know like you the\nsecond someone you realize someone's out\nto get you no empathy no and no more\nempathy for this person who I just\nrealized is out to get me or something\nlike that or you know uh in the case of\nbeing isolated for a long period of time\nyou've learned to exist on your own now\nmaybe everyone's your competitor or\nadversary you know and none of you guys\nare really helping me do my day like I\ndon't really need you guys for anything\nso so I'm eating this food or whatever\nyou know I think it just becomes\ndifferent um when you're part of an\necosystem and you realize that you know\nthere's consequences and there's there's\nEV every action that you take you know\nevery Act of altruism will be recognized\nand there you know there's there's\nthere's a there's some score being kept\nin your when you're part of a society\nand um and then when you're when you're\nnot there's none there's there's none of\nthat and so I think the degree to which\nyou're integrated in society um it's\nalmost like the extracellular Matrix you\nknow this is a really this is an out\nthere analogy but you know when you\nthink about synapses being made um\nconnections between people there's also\nall the support material that\nfacilitates certain patterns and certain\nconnections from happening or not\nhappening and and I think um that's it's\nit's stuff that we haven't Quantified\nyet but it doesn't you know I think\nthose things should be studied years ago\nI worked with at risk kids and and a\nfair number of them had just arrived um\nfrom a region of the world that had\nundergone dramatic\nsociopolitical um Evolution um and\nchange and it was remarkable because we\nwould put out a tray of food to eat and\nthen the the format was everyone would\nserve themselves and then um you could\nuh go get more food if if you if\neveryone\nfinished um and a couple of these kids\nthat had come from these very deprived\nenvironments um would just take a more\nthan their their share it was clear that\nby taking that other kids weren't going\nto get any and um and I remember telling\nthem listen we all have to eat more or\nless equal parts and then we can there\nis more we can get more and um I'll\nnever forget this kid's response he just\nturned to me and he said you can't hit\nus and I said that's true I can't hit\nyou and he and he said so I'm just going\nto take as much as I want and this took\nseveral weeks actually to to work out\nright um CU of course I would never hit\nhim and um but everyone's his adversary\neveryone's his adversary and it was\nremarkable to see the evolution of these\nkids across that it was about three and\na half weeks um at which point they\nactually became\nincredibly um good at sharing um but it\nit took a lot of work it was almost as\nif even though they knew more tra of\nfood could arrive yeah not Limitless but\nthere was there was an abundance of food\nyeah in the moment they they were\nsolving for that short Horizon moment\nyeah and it and here we're talking about\nhuman beings capable of speech and\nexpression of emotion Etc and he\nunderstood the fundamental rule which\nwas I couldn't hit him therefore he\ncould basically do what he wanted\nwithout that\nconsequence and which the main\nconsequence he faced apparently exactly\nand um and I remember you know it was it\nwas so striking I'll never forget that\nand the evolution to a different more um\naltruistic state was wonderful\nespecially because of what I think what\nit did for him but but I'll never forget\nthinking this is a human being who's\nessentially functioning like an\nanimal like an animal I mean I had a\nBulldog Mastiff and he was kind to other\ndogs but if there\nwere unattended to toys at the dog park\nhe was going to pick them up and he put\nhim right in front of himself and his\nthis was down San Diego and he sit with\nthem right in front of him and I'm like\nCostello you're not going to play with\nall those toys but if another dog came\nand and he wouldn't he would just sit in\nfront of them but another dog would come\nand try and take one of those toys and\nhe would he had these giant mitts and he\nwould just boom Stam it out and drag it\nback and so it seems that there are\nthese very primitive circuits about uh\nresource allocation and protection of\nresources that in the absence of\nunderstanding that there's a much bigger\nlandscape like Costello eventually\nfigured out like tug's a fun game\nalthough most dogs couldn't play tug\nwith him there were a few that could he\nwas a 90b bulldog he was just a neck\nlike this but you know to see this in a\nhuman being was just so striking I just\nas you're describing this it's like this\nadversary versus um neutral versus uh\nfriend it is just so striking and it's\ngot to be you know that that the brain\nas complex as it is I've often wondered\nand our colleague Marcus Meister once\nsaid that you know C cirs in the brain\num Can broadly be divided into these\nsorts of circuits into yum yuck and me\nright Which is far too simplistic right\nbut who am I to argue with the great\nMarcus Meister um and I'm not going to\nbut it's sort of interesting we sort of\nBin our responses into yes okay let\nlet's cooperate or yes let's cooperate\nyou're summarizing veence yeah or or no\nway no chance like mine yeah versus like\nme me and um you know as complex as I'd\nlike to think the brain is and we are I\nmean maybe when it comes down to\nbehaviors and how we interpret input and\nour\ndecision-making um maybe it's really all\nabout feelings of safety and feelings of\num relatedness yeah I think it's also\nabout the IR experiential statistics\nthat you have been exposed to so this\nthis boy who says you I'm going to take\nall this food because you can't hit me I\nmean we don't don't know but the the\npicture that grows out of my imagination\nis this boy had a lot of experiences of\npeople hitting them a lot of experiences\nof not enough\nfood and not a lot of experiences of\nstrangers being nice to them you know\nlike not a lot of people that you could\ntrust that's the that's the experiential\nstatistics that would fit this\nmodel someone like like you who's coming\nin being like Oh no there's more I'm\ngoing to give you guys more food for\nfree you know I'm going to give you even\nmore food for it's you know it the\nexperiential statistics are you come\nfrom a world of abundance where people\nare gener you know generosity being\nyou've learned being generous can make\nyou have a lifelong friend and all these\namazing opportunities that make your\nquality of life that food is you're\nnever going to think about food again\nit's about the relationships because\nthat's your experiential statistics and\nso I think this is such a profound\nconcept about about neuroscience and the\nBrain about our social structures and\nhow they form what makes a structure\negalitarian or\ndespotic right like how how can we as\nindividuals take a structure that is is\none format let's say despotic hierarchy\nand evolve it into something that's more\negalitarian and um what are what are the\nthe the levers and what are the\nparameter spaces that we can pull on and\nI think these are questions\nthat I mean it's hard to think of what\ncould be more important um but that\nperspective of thinking about from\nexperiential statistics I think really\nsupports you know the need of of of\ndiversity having bringing in people to\nAcademia whove had very different\nexperiences experiential statistics\ndifferent biases of what they're going\nto think is interesting to work on and\nstudy and obviously in every every\nsector of our society so I think\num how can we get more diverse sets of\nexperiences\nrepresented at each decision-making body\nthat really\nmatters yeah Amen to that and also to be\nable to understand that um differences\nin background experience um require that\nwe we earlier you mentioned theory of\nmind this ability to get into the\nmindset of others and and sort of assume\nor presume certain mindsets in order to\nhopefully create a more benevolent\nenvironment for everybody um\nyou know it requires um you know\nrealizing that some people's social\ninteractions are you know have been\nterrible or traumatic or um you know it\nrequires a departure from self\nessentially it requires this empathy or\nsomething like empathy um in all\ndirections right I mean in all\ndirections it requires that everyone at\nleast makes some effort to try and\nunderstand that I do wonder and maybe\nsomeone would put on the comments on\nYouTube maybe maybe you're aware um K of\num whether or\nnot kids are being trained in that\nbeautiful period of time of life where\nneuroplasticity is so robust um although\nit does continue throughout the right\nlifespan it is especially robust early\nin life to um to be in a healthy way\nempathically attuned to be able to have\ntheory of mind more robust theory of\nmind yeah so I think it's it's really I\nmean I'm I'm so I'm a parent I have two\nkids that are in public school and I\nthink their Public Schools rated you\nknow it's fine Buton say it's all right\nand um but but at their school they\ndefinitely do get education about um\nmore holistic health and emotional\nregulation I think and and considering\nothers um that's been that's that's a\nbig focus of the school and I think\nthat's actually really important I I I I\nmean you know again I'm I'm super biased\nfrom from my upbringing but my kids are\ngoing to learn math whenever it's time\nto learn the that they'll learn it\nwhenever they need it you know whenever\nthey need it they're going to learn it\nin a couple I don't know a couple weeks\nand figure out do the thing um most of\nthe things that they learn they're going\nto forget them and then have to relearn\nthem um so what are the things that\nyou're going to really need to know no\nmatter what you choose to do and I think\nregulating your your own emotions and\nand and engaging other individuals in a\nhealthy sustainable way that you know\nand I mean sustainable in terms of the\nlongevity of their relationships and I\nthink those are the things that end up\nreally mattering so I think um also this\nquestion about exposure to abundance and\nscarcity uh is really interesting too I\nmean I don't know if that's a direction\nwe want to go into so please yeah well I\nthink you know this whole you know it\nsort sounds sort of new Agy when I say\nyou know abundant the abundance mindset\nright um I mean you see this in people\nwho are like uh recently divorced or\nnewly single for whatever reason like is\nis the world a place where like finding\num partnership is is relatively\nstraightforward with some work involved\num or is it like well there's only one\nperson on the planet for you and they\nmight be dead already right like um is\nthere PL if someone else's business\ntakes off maybe someone you went to\ncollege or high school with or their lab\nis doing really well you're seeing them\nyou know tremendously successful that\nmaybe they made a $100 million in a in a\nnew in a company acquisition do you\nimmediately feel like oh those are\nresources that I don't have um even\nthough I'm not in that business um or do\nyou see it as wow that there must be a\nlot of money out there that um that\npeople could earn and and potentially\nmake I really you know prescribe and\nbelieve in this abundance versus\nscarcity mindset\nframework um I think there's absolutes\nlike the example we just talked about\nthis the the kid you know there's just\nnot food there's scarcity of food fact\nyou know of course there are individuals\nthat experience scarcity of various\ndifferent needs but many of us we reach\na threshold of abundance and then it\nbecomes relative we have everything we\nabsolutely physiologically need if we're\nnot comparing ourselves to anyone else\nbut then once we were enter the social\nArena comparison is essential why do we\ncompare ourselves to others it's it's\ningrain because social status is\nsomething that we need to attend to a\nlarge part of our our our brain is\ndevoted to representing our relative\nsocial rank what's our place with a\nsocial network what's the dynamic how do\nwe fit into the social landscape and\ncomparison I think is just a way to do\nthat that's that's been evolutionarily\nconserved perhaps for less of a good\npurpose at this point because so many of\nour basic survival needs are met for the\nlarge majority of of humans on the\nplanet today not not for everybody of\ncourse but so yet what is the percentage\nof humans who feel they have everything\nthat they desire how many people feel\nlike they don't want for anything and\nyou know it's interesting because having\nthings doesn't make\nyou have an abundance mindset having\nabundance does not is not sufficient to\ngive you the mindset of\nabundance that's such an important\nstatement I mean just I don't think they\ncould be restated enough\num you've studied social rank mhm uh\npeople hear social Rank and hierarchy\nand I have to guess that at least some\nneurons in their amydala and other areas\nof the brain get buzzing because as soon\nas people hear social\nrank they I think naturally started\nthink well where am I in this social\nRank and um how do I feel about how that\nrank is you know established and and all\nsorts of interesting and important\nquestions um some people get very angry\nthat there are billionaires on this\nplanet M especially given that in most\nmajor cities you don't have to go very\nfar to see people who have very limited\nuh\nresources\nso social rank is something that um I\nthink exists in every little niche like\nyou know at work and maybe even in the\nfamily there's social rank um I have a\nsibling I remember um who got more of a\nof a piece of cake like even a slight\ndifference in that you know was\nsomething that my older sibling would\npoint out um because she was more\neffective at getting the slightly larger\npiece of cake cuz I was until I was you\nknow big enough to offend for myself um\nand my friends with larger sibling pools\nin their family it was especially\ncompetitive yeah I don't if you've ever\ngone to a meal with somebody who had a\nlot of siblings they eat fast they they\ndifferent resource allocation methods\nthan if they were an only child versus\nuh one sibling MH they there's variation\nhere I'm generalizing but um but yeah\nlet's talk about social rank what do we\nknow about how social rank is organized\nin the brain how we perceive our own\nsocial ranking and um yeah like what's\nthe what's the modern science on this\nstuff I find it fascinating um I'm not\nscared of any topic well most any topic\nand I think this is one that that\naffects us all yeah I mean I'll first\nsay that social rank is something very\nspecific to a certain type of hierarchy\nthat assumes a linear hierarchy which\nsometimes forms but oftentimes there's\ndifferent types of hierarchies that are\nflatter or more Amorphis it's not really\nclear who's who's the alpha on the\nplayground I don't know there's this\nclick here there you know it can be\ndynamic right right it's Dynamic it's\nnot always organized as such but um if\nyou get animals into a sort of small\nspace um you will see in many species\nespecially with in the males um forming\na linear hierarchy and um um we wanted\nto explore this and so I think one of\nthe biggest challenges with studying\nsocial Rank and this is something we've\nstruggled with as well is how do you\ncontrol for the\nindividual identity versus the uh the\nactual rank so what I mean by this is\nlet's say there's a\nstudy that says um that you know neurons\nin a certain brain region fire to\nanimals of different ranks according to\nthe rank fire most of the alpha less\nless less less down to the rank you know\ndoes that does that tell us that this\nbrain region encodes social rank maybe\nin a loose sense and I'm sure that when\nrank issues come up a lot of the brain\nlights up for different comp different\nreasons but for example let's say the\namydala would respond more to the Alpha\nmaybe because it inodes social rank but\nmaybe also\nbecause whoever is the dominant is the\none who's most likely to have\nconsequences and so all of my\ninteractions with the alpha are\nrelatively High consequence and so I'm\nsort of stressed out whenever I'm\ntalking about Alpha paying attention and\nyou know you remember all the\ninteractions you have with your boss\nmore so than you know someone else\nthere's an attention hierarchy\nsubordinates attend more to dominance\nand so there's it's almost hard to make\nthis comparison because it's not all\nflat like the the clean experiment which\nwe are still trying to do it's it's\ndifficult to do the perfect experiment\nwould be if you take an individual and\nchange their rank so for\nexample um I like to use this example\nwith Barack Obama so just indulge me I\nknow that this is from a while ago but\nonce upon a time I met Barack Obama for\na very brief moment when he was\npresident and and maybe there's some\nneurons that light up oh wow you know\nthere's the Barack Obama president\nneurons but if they are identity neurons\nonce he was no longer president if I was\nto be presented with Barack Obama then\nthey would still fire if they were\nranked Neons then maybe after he was no\nlonger president it just these neurons\nfire to whoever is president now and so\nI think that experiment is very\ndifficult to do and has not been done\nbut we're working on it right now um in\nuh uh another experiment where we take\nanimals and they're living in groups uh\nand we rank them all and then we rehouse\nthem so everybody has a rank that they\nstart with then we put all the alphas\ntogether put all the betas together Etc\nso that everybody forms a new rank then\nyou have animals that went up a rank\nwent down a rank or stayed the same for\nevery group and so that's something that\nwe're looking at right now so initially\nyou take a pool of animals and then\nlet's say you got your number one two 3\nfour just for sake of Simplicity let's\nsay I take the number four lowest in\nthat hierarchy but now I make them the\ntop of a new hierarchy that's right\nthat's right got it and so it's really\npreliminary and we'll see what happens\nbut we're\ninvestigating it it seems that when you\ntake\nAlpha's intermediates or subordinates\nand put them together into new\nhierarchies it takes them different\namounts of time and then Dynamics are\nvery different in forming the new\nhierarchy and so in any kind of\npredictable way that you're willing to\nshare or is it just too early I think\nit's too early but I'll just say I guess\nit seems like the\num the intermediates might be taking the\nlongest amount of time to form the\nhierarchy they don't know where they sit\nin the hierarchy they they were flexible\nor something whereas the dominants\nthey're going to Duke it out and then\nyou know we're going to we're going to\nbattle there'll be defeat it's quick the\nfight doesn't last that long\nsubordinates you know I I I you know we\nhave to still observe this is all still\nyou know being we'll see if everything\nreplicates but certainly the Dynamics\nare different what the exact readouts we\nyou know we're working on what the\nfeatures are what key features to to see\nbut it's kind of uncanny because these\nare genetically inbred animals that are\nall hous in these should be all everyone\nshould be the same theoretically but\nthis makes me think that during certain\ndevelopmental periods rank is shaping\nyour long lasting development I think\nit's a simple similar phenomenon perhaps\nto the older child younger child\nphenomenon where you know if you're the\noldest you go into the world and you\nhave lots of different roles you might\nbe the bottom you know you're going to\nplay on sports teams and be in different\nclasses and have all these but the the\nthe leadership desire slash potential\nskill seems to be correlated in a very\nnon-scientific way you know the number\nof presidents that's often old oldest or\nonly children this type of thing it's\nit's a loose correlation there's a lot\nof other reasons why it might not be\nbehavioral but there's sort of you know\nfluffy fluffy correlations about that I\nthink there's something to it though um\nwhen plasticity happening you're this\nthis becomes your most familiar state of\nassuming a certain role and that\nattractor state deepens with more time\nspent there I find that so fascinating\nI've also observed and I think I've seen\na few papers on I don't know how\nrigorous these papers are that um\nyoungest or let's just say not oldest\nsiblings um here we're setting aside\nsingle children that don't have any\nsiblings but that youngest siblings uh\ndo tend to quote unquote break the mold\nmore in terms of uh socio and cultural\nnorms of the family they they Venture\nfurther in terms of um experiences and\nsystems they're often seen as having had\nfewer constraints than the older sibling\nwhich may or may not be true um but that\nthe youngest uh siblings often will um\ntake on risk yeah that older siblings\nwon't yeah yeah yeah and that's\ncertainly been my observation\nnonconformists right I mean I'm a young\nyounger brother of an older sister um\nbut and then but then there was times in\nour childhood where she was out of the\nhouse and I was at home just with my mom\nso so that sort of changes things but\nand it's very Dynamic I realize we're\nplaying here in in a kind of a loose\nspace but but I find Social rank stuff\nto be super interesting I grew up in a\nbig pack of mostly boys um that's just\nkind of how it worked out in my\nneighborhood um at the time um and it\nwas very interesting because it was very\nclear it was a dynamic hierarchy where\nif we were skateboarding certain kids\nwere Alpha if we were playing soccer\nother kids were Alpha if we were doing\nanything artistic um if it was uh kind\nof geeky knowledge and and nerdy stuff\num you know then you know might have\nbeen somebody else who had the knowledge\num and had the information that people\nwanted so I think Dynamic hierarchies\nare really interesting and I think um\nget us out of that sort of more standard\nAlpha like kind of chest beating telling\neveryone what to do dictatorial model I\nmean and this is now fully out of any\nscience land and into speculation\nopinion land but I think that type of\nstructural structure where when you're\ndoing different tasks different\nindividuals become the the alpha or the\nleader because it's based on competence\nis very healthy I think structures where\nyou have locked down this is the this is\nthe hierarchy where someone's the boss\nof you because of this one skill but\nthere's all these other skills that\nthey're not as they're they're not\nSuperior you know they they they don't\ndon't outrank you at and and so how do\nyou work all of that out and so I think\nthat's also something about keeping\nscore like what is what is the rank\nright and so we did this experiment\nwhere we designed a\ntask um animals are trained that a queue\npredicts reward delivery only one animal\ncan get at a time it's just a very\nnarrow place so if one animal's getting\nit you can't get it then um we would\nhave four animals that are CAG mates\nfour mice that are cagemates and we\nwould have two of them duke it out at\neach point and they we know the ranks\nthe ranks are stable they have a rank\none two three four in the cage and\neverybody does a round robin ones versus\ntwos ones versus threes two versus yeah\nthey well they they do round rabit in\nthis reward competition task they're\nfood deprived you know and we we present\nrewards what's the what happens and so\nsubordinates do win some of the times\neven though dominants win more all you\nknow they they consistently win more and\nwe found that prefrontal cortical\nneurons you could represent very stably\nand decode which animal was\ndominant um flat regardless of the trial\nand then when you looked at whether we\ncould decode competitive success meaning\nwho is going to win that next trial so\nthere's a new trial every 30 or 40\nseconds and so but 30 seconds before\nwhich is as far as we can measure\nbecause then we're like kind of into the\nprevious trial as soon as the last trial\nends even before the next trial ends You\ncan predict above chance\nsignificantly which animal is going to\nwin the next trial just based on the\nfiring pattern of prefrontal cortical\nter so you can predict winners and\nlosers you can predict\nand understand where they are in the\nhierarchy as well based on the ACT\nactivation of neurons prior to the\nbattle that's like recording from the um\nby analogy it's like recording from the\nprefrontal cortex of two let's say\nbusiness competitors or um martial arts\ncompetitors and you can predict who's\ngoing to win based on the pattern of\nfiring in their brains prior to the\ncompetition that's right and so um that\nsuggests all sorts of things number one\nit doesn't mean these competitions are\nnot independent there's something about\nthe state of the animal and when we\nlooked at is it just whoever won the\nprevious trial that did not account for\nthis and so um I thought this was really\ninteresting but when you look at the\ndecoding accuracy for dominants versus\nsubordinates about uh who will win the\nnext trial for dominance it stays pretty\nflat it just has to do with I think this\nis my speculation of our data um that\nyou know they they either are engaged or\nthey're not engaged the subordinates the\ndecoding accuracy is is above a it's\nabove chance but then it shoots up\nsomewhere around closer to the queue\npresentation and so my speculation about\nthat is that the subordinates are\nlooking at the dominance they're looking\nthe dominant doesn't look like they're\nit doesn't look like they're going to go\nfor it okay yeah there there looks like\nthey're turning away I'm gonna go I'm\ngonna go so it's it's not like they're\nboth going out full every time it's it's\na calculation which trials oh he's not\npaying attention you know it's like when\nyou're driving in traffic and you're\ntrying to find the the moment to cut\nover and you're waiting for the person\nwho's like te texting and there just\nthere's a big space and everybody's just\ngetting in right here you know you can\njust see you're like looking for clues\nabout the state of level you know of\ncompetition and then and then the\ndominants they are not looking at the\nsubordinate they're just doing whatever\nthey feel like doing it's like a there's\na I think there's that one scene in\nMadmen where something happened in the\nwork environment and um and it was clear\nsomeone's account didn't sell or\nsomething didn't work out for one person\nversus the other and I think one of the\ncharacters says to uh Don Draper who's\nclearly one of the alphas in that work\nenvironment by virtue of yeah role and\nand um position um says you know you\nknow I sometimes think about the way\nthat you blank blank blank and blank and\nhe goes on this brief tiate about how\nupset he was and um and Draper says well\nI don't think about you at all and then\nthe elevator I believe closes and it\nreally cemented his status in the office\nas somebody who's really not paying much\nattention to what other people are doing\nhe's just making decisions according to\nwhat's going to be best for the firm and\nin some cases for himself and in some\ncases both so I think that's essentially\nwhat you're talking about yeah I think\nit's um it's kind of the nature of the\nstructure that's what makes you the\nalpha is you're you you have you have\nother things that are occupying your\nattention and your your Visionary status\nhopefully if you're you know a\nproductive successful Alpha and for a\nsustainable you know group and then\neveryone else is they don't they don't\nneed to have the big picture they don't\nthey don't you know it it becomes the\nreinforcement schedule is different I'm\njust looking for validation am I am I\nplaying my role okay it's a very\ndifferent mindset I think you know as a\nscientist when you're a trainee\nsometimes you're a a supporting member\non a team where you're getting\ninstruction someone's telling you what\nto do versus the moment where you get\nyour own project and maybe you're\nworking by yourself maybe there's no one\nto command but no one's telling you what\nto do that is to me one of the biggest\nthresholds to step over when you're\nbecoming a scientist or an investigator\nis the first time where you just do\nsomething and like try an experiment no\none told you to do and it feels super\nweird it feels like you're sneaking\naround or something and and then you\nknow I think I think\num in\ntoday's mentorship chain sometimes that\nthat happens too late I think if we\ncould have that experience happen\nearlier um I think that would only be\ngood\nfor for the future of research I agree I\nwas very fortunate that my graduate\nadviser um told me look I'm going to\nhelp you but I'm going to have two kids\nwhile you're in the lab and I'm not\ngoing to be around a lot so you're going\nto have to figure it out don't burn the\nlab down don't kill yourself with any of\nthe poisons in the lab and then my postt\ntalk adviser um the late and great Ben\nBaris um largely treated the postto as\nas Junior professor from an early stage\nand I remember thinking he can't control\nthe experiments I'm going to do this is\nup to me and he and and a great number\nof us who were training with him at that\ntime went on to have our own lab so I\nthink um uh there's really something\nimportant to that model and of course\nwe're discussing the research field but\num this could be exported to any number\nof different fields because what those\nmentors were essentially training us to\ndo was to um to assume the role that we\nwould eventually have as opposed to be\nsubordinates\num do you watch chimp\nEmpire so actually um just this week\nyesterday and the day before before this\nuh an postto interview who worked with\nthe chimps on chimp Empire visited an\ninterviewed him in my lab and um talked\nabout his work so I have not seen chimp\nEmpire but it's at the very top of my\nto-do list oh God it's so good I don't\nwant to spend the next 20 minutes\ntalking about it but you see all sorts\nof interesting um Behavior very relevant\nhuman behavior hierarchies yes but also\num altruistic behavior um allopathic\ngrooming I mean in in chimp culture um\nas I've learned from the show assuming\nit's accurate um that who Grooms who is\nvery important um and there's all sorts\nof interesting um Maneuvers that\nsubordinates make and there's all sorts\nof interesting displays of vigor that\nthe alpha makes to remind people that\nthey are the alpha and then\nas they age or make mistakes of judgment\nthe subordinates also will Fain\ndeference they'll be like oh yeah you're\nthe alpha you're really tough and\nsecretly they're plotting to replace the\nalpha um so whether or not we're talking\nabout a scene from Mad Men or we're\ntalking about chimp Empire we're talking\nabout Research Laboratories or um or any\nother landscape kindergarten I think\nthese circuits are active in all of us\nand the sooner that we uh acknowledge\nthose and try and find um one that\ngeneralize to the the goodness of as\nmany uh members as possible um we're not\ndoing our task but clearly you're doing\nthe task so okay social rank is\nsomething that uh we need to acknowledge\nno doubt um which actually leads me to\nwhat might seem like a desperate topic\nbut um one that I know we're both very\ninterested in and that you're focusing\non now which is psychedelics because one\nof the interesting things about\npsychedelics is their capacity to\nincrease\nneuroplasticity um but but also some of\nthe psychedelics and I realize MDMA is\nnot a classic psychedelic but they are\nclassified as empathogens they increase\nempathy for self and others so uh what\nare you looking into with psychedelics\nwhich psychedelics and um yeah what\nbrought you to the study of psychedelics\nand by the way I've done participated in\nclinical because people will wonder I\nhave participated in clinical trials for\nuh psilocybin and MDMA I don't recommend\npeople do psychedelics Recreation I do\nthink they hold great promise for the\ntreatment of depression and trauma but\npeople need to be careful there are\ncertain people who could not and should\nnot take psychedelics because it would\nbe genuinely unsafe for them um\npsychologically especially young people\nso there's my disclaimer and um but they\nare fascinating compounds so um I guess\nI've always been interested in\npsychedelics I think I wrote my\nundergraduate thesis about it's just\nabout hallucinations produced by\npsychedelics psychotic breaks and REM\nsleep and schizophrenia just comparing\nwhat is the common thread when our brain\ncreates a reality that is not\nobjectively there and um psychedelics of\ncourse is a way that we can experience\nthat and remember it and recall it in a\nway that's very difficult with REM sleep\nand and sometimes with psychotic breaks\num obviously schizophrenia is not\nsomething that you can transiently give\nyourself and have that experience so I\nthink having the ability to move into\nother brain States is what makes it so\nattractive I think the other component\nis the the plasticity you can you can\nhave an experience and perhaps the\nfirsthand experience is you have an\nepiphany that you take with you it's\nlife-changing and you know your life\nhabits are completely different for a\nlong lasting way after this singular\nexperience is is kind of one of the\nthings that makes it so different from\nall of the other um therapeutic\ntreatments that we've got or most of the\nother ones I'd say um and so for me you\nknow right now there's a lot of work\ngoing\non exploring psychedelics as a therapy\nfor various different conditions disease\nStates um I think that's great I think\nit's really important work I'm glad a\nlot is being done on that I think my\nfocus\nis is to turn over some rocks that might\nnot have been turned over yet and just\nto get really down at a quantitative\nrigorous mathematical level of what is a\nhallucination for example um when I\nasked this question what is a\nhallucination I'm interested in the\nactual cellular mechanisms are we just\nyou know we think about neurons having\nsignal to noise and neurom modulation as\nchanging that are we just changing the\nsignal to noise ratio and then pattern\ncompleting all the noise and that's what\na Hallucination is we just you know take\nthat's we're just reinterpreting noise\nand and putting sort of existing Maps\neverything's fitting to existing mold or\nmap that we've already got that then\nappears as some\nhallucination um or is and and and you\nknow maybe it doesn't have to be\nhallucination there's also obviously\nsome various different thresholds of the\nPsychedelic experience um but all these\nclinical statements this human\nself-reported\num Quality ative descriptions of the\nPsychedelic experience things like being\nhaving just more positive outlook being\nuh uniting one self and other like a\nsort of you know Clarity of the world\num more labile in thoughts more flexible\nthoughts uh we are trying to just\ncreate actual ways to test them so for\nexample this idea about what is what is\ngoing on in your mind when you when\nyou're having a psychedelic experience\nall of these different states might feel\nmore labile um it maybe the transition\nprobabilities between different brain\nstates of like happy sad thinking\nnostalgic you know maybe it's just all\nlooser and so you can access everything\nbecause the transition probabilities are\njust High another possibility is that\nand maybe it's dose dependent at a\ncertain dose you go into another brain\nState and so\npreviously we've done this in the same\nproject I was just about rank um we were\nrecording for prefontal cordal neurons\nand looking at all the behaviors and so\nthe behaviors for representing social\nrank we don't know what they are so we\nused computer vision to extract a bunch\nof Behavioral motifs and then tried to\nunderstand what's the best model that\nwould predict you know what the animal\nis going to do next not just wins and\nlosses but all the subtle gestures are\nwe going to fight are we going to give\nit up are we going to back off and\npredict the behaviors from prefrontal\ncortical activity and the best model\nthat we found with something called a\nhidden maravian model which essentially\njust means that there are hidden States\nyou might think of them as moods um you\nmight give them some other name but I'll\nI'll I'll use moods Loosely it's not\nperfect but um that's kind of one way\nthat helps me think about hidden states\nwhere you have certain statistics of\nbehaviors that you would produce if I'm\nsad there's certain things I'm going to\ndo it's a different statistics and of\nwhen I'm happy different probability of\ngoing surfing if I'm sad or happy or you\nknow things like that so we basically\nfound that there are a certain number of\nhidden States and so if you are on\npsychedelics would that change the\nnumber of states or just the transitions\nbetween them we also found in our\nprefrontal cortical representation that\nthere's a certain distance of the\nrepresentation of self and other in this\nyou know dimensionality reduced activity\nspace so for mumbo jumbo that just means\nthere's a representation of self and\nother there's some quantifiable distance\nin in\nabstract you know terms in the brain and\nwe can quantify if those representations\nget closer together and merge of self\nversus other of self versus other so\nthat's something that we would want we\nwould be looking for if you are putting\npsychedelics on these are these are\nquestions that I'm interested in that\nare under construction so right now\nwe're recording from\num animals while we're giving them cybin\nusing neuropixels recordings so\nrecording from thousands of neurons um\nin preal cortex and other parts of\nCortex cuz the you know the shank goes\nto lots of places and looking at how um\nanimals respond in a conflict task so\nthere's there's trials where there's a\nQuee that predicts reward a queue that\npredicts shock then there's some trials\nwhere both cues are presented and both\noutcomes are presented and the reason\nfor this conflict trial is that actually\nif you give you know moderate to low\ndoses of psilocybin or most drugs\nhonestly animals can do this\nyou know even on lots of different drugs\nmost people can still eat food and avoid\ngetting hit by this truck I mean there\nare exceptions of course but generally\nspeaking you know there's a lot of\ndifferent brain states where you can\nstill do these these essential functions\npretty robustly but it's about what\nhappens in the more ambiguous Zone what\nhappens when there's a conflict and and\nwhat do you do how do you when there\nwhen it's a little gray I think that's\nwhen you can see a shift in veilance\nassignment so that's something that\nwe've been looking for and trying to see\nif um you know in clinical studies\nthey're exploring set and setting um as\nmaybe the factors that have in the past\nhistorically given very unpredictable\noutcomes for psychedelic therapies um\nit's possible that it's set in setting\nit's also possible that there's\nindividual variability it's possible\nthat there are biomarkers that can\npredict which individuals would be well\nsuited for this type of therapy and so\nthose are also things that we're\ninterested in I find this so fascinating\nand I I just want to applaud you again\nfor taking on these hard questions these\nare fairly high level questions um\ncertainly there's a lot of uh clinical\ntrials exploring psychedelics like\npsilocybin and their role in treating\nmental health um and there's at the same\ntime um a real dir of studies exploring\nmechanistically how these compounds are\nworking I mean um I do want to tip my\nhat to all the folks that have explored\ndendritic changes and you know so\ncellular changes in the level of neurons\nand and on and on but in terms of these\nlike higher level states of um self\nversus other recognition um in\npsychedelics um you know that those are\ntough questions that need to be\naddressed mechanistically and it's clear\nyou're doing that um I I think this um\nthis notion that you're testing of\nwhether or not psychedelics reveal more\naccessibility or liability as you\ndescribed it of between different states\nlike oh wow I can actually move from sad\nto Happy there's a there's a route for\nthat and you can experience that as\nopposed to just being told that hey when\nyou're feeling sad feel your you know\nthe field of psychology especially pop\npsychology is in a real crisis right now\nin my opinion because we're told to feel\nour feelings but then we're also told to\nnot react to our feelings which sounds\ngreat but if those feelings get intense\nenough that's very hard for most people\nto do so it's feel your feelings but\ndon't stay with you know what there's\nthe cathartic model you know like feel\nyour feelings and and get them out\nscreaming and Etc and then there's the\nthe no you know the more you engage a\nneural pathway the stronger that neural\npathway gets and therefore you're just\ngoing to feel more anger there's a lot\nof conflict right now in terms of the\npopular\npsychology version of this whereas the\nthe clinical Fields I think have a an\nunderstanding that hasn't been\ntranslated I think one other thing about\npsychedelics that is interesting is that\nthe transitions into States is also more\nlabile like if you start feeling a\nlittle sad you know there's the\npotential to feel very very sad and to\ngo into a state of sadness of of an\nintensity you've never experienced\nbefore which by the way could be\ntherapeutically beneficial um I think\nthere's some evidence for that provided\nthere's adequate support before during\nand after those sessions\num but I think most people feel when\nthey're not on psychedelics will feel\nemotions that are uncomfortable and\nwill'll do all sorts of things to try\nand avoid those emotions so I I'm not\nspeaking as a clinician here but I just\nagain I think what the the uh the range\nand specificity of questions that you're\nasking about psychedelics I I find so\nexciting another uh uh reason I'll say\nthat you we want to have you back to to\ndiscuss those findings when that when\nthey come out let's talk a little bit\nabout you okay um I've known you for a\nwhile but to be honest I think this is\nthe longest conversation we've ever had\nwhich is one of the reasons I love doing\nthis podcast I get to sit down with\ncolleagues and have intellectual slash\nother conversations of of substantial\ndepth that I wouldn't have the\nopportunity to have\nelsewhere I know enough about you\nhowever to know that um you've been\ninvolved in various things um I'm not\ngoing to say peripheral to science but\nyou have other interests as well um as I\nrecall um you have been a yoga\ninstructor or a or you've been involved\nin the uh kind of wellness fitness uh\nCommunity industry tell us about that\nand then I'm also curious about um how\nyou structure your day your routines\ngiven that you're a parent of two young\nchildren you run a very large laboratory\noperating at the very highest level um\nand of course you value important things\nlike relationships and relationship to\nself and health and all these sorts of\nthings so um not to make it too\nopen-ended but yeah like tell us of tell\nus of your interests and and of your\nrelationship to Wellness and fitness and\nwell-being yeah um I guess I\nthink you know I everybody comes to\ntheir their calling in in some what\nfeels like a path that you could have\npredict but when you look at it outside\nI guess both of my parents are\nprofessors so it doesn't look super\nsurprising that I'm a professor but\nthat's not how it felt to me when I was\nin high school I was a total rebel I\njust threw parties at my house my\nparents weren't there sorry everybody\nwho's listening it's not I don't\nrecommend that but I just cared about I\njust cared about having fun and sports\nand\num I\nthink school wasn't maybe challenging\nenough for me at that time I didn't\nnecessarily recognize that that was what\nit was but um I've always enjoyed being\nreally active and that's what makes me\nfeel good it's I I I definitely um agree\nwith stuff you've said on your podcast\nabout having exercise routines in the\nmorning that really influence the rest\nof your day I I didn't always exercise\nin the morning at different phases but\num yeah after I was an undergrad I took\nsome time to travel around Australia\nbackpack around Australia live in some\nvery remote places spend some time\nliving in a tent then I was a yoga\ninstructor um then I I went to grad\nschool in the Bay Area I had a very\nactive uh hobby of I was a\nsemi-professional break dancer I was\nvery into break dancing really really\ncompetitive break dancer in area yes we\ndid um you know halftime shows or I\nguess technically third quarter timeout\nshows at Oracle Stadium for the Golden\nState Warriors I was the one girl who\ncould do a windmill so they would use me\nokay windmills someone's going to find\nfootage of this yeah yeah there's some\nyou know very mediocre footage of me\nbreak dancing um and I was just really\ninto it but I think that's where my work\nlife balance passion comes from I talk\nabout it a lot I think about it a lot\nand people say to me all the time well\nyou is this really true why do you why\ndo you preach all this work life balance\nstuff when you know you must have been a\nworkaholic at some point in your life\nand I think you know when I was younger\nI definitely didn't like the idea that\nyou had to only be one thing I wanted to\nbe so many things I couldn't decide it\nwas a huge challenge I was going to be a\nwriter I was going to be a yoga\ninstructor I was going to be I never\nreally thought I was going to be a\nprofessional dancer I just wasn't good\nenough and there's not careers to be\nmade from dancing really it's very\ndifficult but um you know had a lot of\nother interests and I wanted to\nprove I don't know who I wanted to prove\nit to I think myself at first and then\neventually it made me May me feel like I\nshould maybe prove it to everyone that\nyou can have a very whole life and not\nsacrifice everything you don't have to\nchoose between family and career or\npersonal life you can have them all you\njust have to decide that it's a priority\nand own that and make those choices on\non a daily basis and comes down to time\nmanagement and so it's been a very even\nthough it looks like oh K just likes to\nhave fun and have all these other\nHobbies it it's it's important because I\nthink that we need more role models in\nespecially in academic science where\npeople bring their whole selves to their\njob and even though your job is a very\nspecific thing um because you have a\nrole as a mentor and you know I suppose\nthe mentor apprenticeship relationship\nhas evolved then there's I have you know\nlots of comments about that too um in\nAcademia I still think ultimately when\nwhen I was working in someone else's lab\nand I definitely looked up to them they\nwere the role model obviously I'm\nlooking at yes there science I'm looking\nat how they make this all work how you\nhow are you doing this how how do they\nlive their lives and how do they\napproach balancing it all and so I guess\nI just wanted to put some more data\npoints on the on the scoreboard where\npeople are having lots of hobbies and\nother nonwork activities while still\nmaking meaningful contributions and it\ndoesn't make you less of a less of a\nscientist or less of a person because\nyou're a whole\nhuman if anything perhaps it makes\npeople better scientists yeah did your\nexploration of of yoga and or break\ndancing inform anything about your your\nresearch or was it really about\nresetting uh your mind and body in\nhealthy ways so that you could return to\nthe lab feeling excited about returning\nto the lab I think of always been of the\nmindset where sometimes things don't go\nwell in a certain Arena and it's it\ndoesn't feel good to have all your eggs\nin that\nbasket stuff goes wrong sometimes\nexperiment doesn't work sometimes you\nfind something out you lose a whole data\nset it's you know bad news happens in\nthe lab and um I think just want to\ndiversify your portfolio so that your\nhappiness portfolio is not entirely\nbased on your accomplishments at work um\nI think we just want to have more\nelements and this the same thing goes\nfor you know at one point when I was\nreally into dancing I got a very serious\ninjury and it took this huge part of my\nlife away from me I was so glad I had\nwork thank God I have work you know I\nhave something I can do else and I just\nthink having a lot of different parts of\nyour life make you more flexible more\ncreative more awake more engaged and you\nknow when I don't I definitely have been\na workaholic when I was a postdoc and\nassistant professor period definitely\ndid not make enough time for myself to\nhave a a richer a rich personal life at\ncertain points and very quickly I just\nwither away into a shell of a human a\nshell an empty shell of a the person I\nused to be and it's noticeable everybody\ncan feel it you can't pretend you know\neveryone that works with you feels it\neventually and so I think that's a big\nthing and so as I've taken feedback from\nmy Anonymous lab surveys and other other\nforms of feedback and just\nreflecting it's clear I you know taking\nyour lifestyle into to and having agency\nover designing your lifestyle to be\nideal for you is super important so a\ntypical day for me uh might look\nlike um okay the last work day let's say\nI woke up actually so it was early high\ntide so I got to wake up in the dark\npack up my bags go surfing and then get\nhome before surf see my friends in the\nwater and I think surfing is a lot of\nthings it's exercise it's it's a cold\nplunge it's photons some of your\nfavorite things maybe a little bit\nmeditative maybe some social Community\nthen and I you know go every time at the\nsame day so there's the same group of\npeople then I go home make the kids\ntheir snacks breakfast drop them off at\nschool then I go to a lab and then run\nlab meeting um\nand have meetings most of my day when\nI'm at work is spent meeting with people\ndrawing on a whiteboard mostly meeting\nmeeting with my trainees um is what I\nlike to spend most of my time on of\ncourse there's other stuff that gets in\nthe mix like administrative whatever and\nthen come home at a pretty early hour\npick up my kids make dinner and then go\nto sleep kind of early kind of boring\nthese days that's my typical day sounds\nexciting to me sounds exciting to me um\nI think uh if one were to stay up late\nthen one feel sleep deprived if they\nwake up early if you wake up late you're\nmissing out on the early morning Sunrise\nthe surf all of that I've never surfed\nactually once I paddled out once when I\nwas in college and uh there was no surf\nso I would paddle back in but um I keep\nhearing about this surfing thing and um\npeople seem to love it that's one of my\nconcerns is that if you fall in love\nwith it you're going to spend a lot of\ntime out in the ocean but clearly it's\nall serving you well and um uh must be\nwonderful to be a child in your home I\ncan imagine how much fun it is and how\ninteresting it is um you mentioned\nseveral\ntimes uh mentorship and trainees and\nit's clear that\nuh reshaping um the landscape of science\nfor the Next Generation coming up is\nsomething that's of real passion to you\num I take great uh pleasure in asking\nthis because um you know it wasn't long\nago that you and I were graduate\nstudents in postdocs and more or less\nthe same vintage right and as is the\ncase people retire people die this is\nthe reality of life and people move up\nup the ranks as you have um so what are\nsome of the things that you're most\npassionate about in terms of shaping the\nfuture of science um in particular\nresearch science but maybe more broadly\nand um what do you doing about it I\nthink that\num science academic culture has\nevolved and and I guess I should start\nby just saying first I as I was driving\nover here it's just beautiful drive and\nI'm just thinking it is so cool that we\nget to do this for a living isn't it\namazing\nthat studying whatever I find\ninteresting to me is something that I\ncan you know have a secure job for and\nthen just thinking about cool ideas and\ndirections and talking about it stuff\nthat I would do for free is is really my\njob and I I just am so grateful to have\nthat and um um I think there are a lot\nof beautiful sides of Academia that\nsometimes don't get the airtime that\nthey deserve and of course there's a lot\nof Doom and Gloom there always has been\nwhen I was a grad student there's lots\nof Doom and Gloom in The Ether there's\nplenty now um I think perhaps it has\nbecome a little bit more dire um the\nplight of Academia right now uh there's\nbeen a nationwide drop of posts in\ngeneral there's just a mass Exodus away\nfrom Academia to Industry and I think\nthat reflects the changing environment\nand so um I guess when I was a graduate\nstudent I had this book in my desk\ndrawer called advice for young\ninvestigator written by ramonica Hall\nwhich is a great book it's thin it's a\nquick read it's got some whims Whimsical\nanecdotes and some some some important\ninsights I think um also a lot of\nmisogyny very much glamorizing work\nworkaholic Tendencies and you there was\ndefinitely a picture of a scientist this\nwas the way to succeed other options not\nreally offered and and I really\nstruggled with that I had a lot of\nimpostor syndrome coming up through I\nmean I someone asked me when when did I\nwhen did I stop having impostor syndrome\nI think maybe\n2021 you know very recently I think I\nspent 20 years of my career having\nimpostor syndrome wondering if I was\ngood enough if I was going to make it am\nI going to do I have what it takes and\nconstantly doub Ting and questioning it\num and I think that it would have been\nnice to to not feel so alone at that\nperiod of of my career um so I think\nsome of the things that were described\nin this original book um were really\nimportant for academic research to be\nborn as a thing like how do we make this\nbe a thing that you can get paid for you\nknow how do we make this be a job that\npeople get to have and then at this\npoint I think most people would agree we\nneed science science is important we\nwant to we want to we benefit from\nscience um and I think at this point\nit's not so clear that we need elitism\nas much as we did before it's not um\nwe're we're looking at a crumbling\nacademic culture where where we're\nstruggling to retain people and you know\nthat's it's not it's not a great\nsustainable Dynamic I think trainees are\nnot getting compensated well enough or\ntreated treated well enough that it's an\nattractive choice and so I think we need\nsort of make a change and nothing wrong\nnecessarily about about the intentions\nthat were set hundreds of years ago but\nthings change and where where we are now\nand things are changing very\nquickly so um I I guess I get to make\none of my childhood dreams which is to\nto write a book come true um in uh I get\nin and one of the benefits of social\nmedia I did have a tweet kind of you\nknow just sort of spontaneously ranting\nabout about how this book is problematic\nand it's very\nmisogynistic and maybe we need another\nbook for other types of people um and\nthat makes people feel more\nincluded um and so and and this tweet\nwent around and it s I didn't expect you\nknow I didn't expect anything to come to\nthis I'm just you know living my daily\nlife and then my DM suddenly had\nliterary agents and a book deal and then\nokay I'm now I'm writing this book and\nso I'm at about halfway\nthrough but I think the the goal of the\nbook I I don't really have time for this\nproject to be honest but it's such an\nimportant project to me um I think\nthat\nI I want to see Academia be a one of the\nhealthiest places why is it second only\nto the military in the pervasiveness of\nsexual misconduct\nand you know things yeah y did you know\nthat so actually you know factoid is\nAcademia is the military is worse in\nterms of sexual misconduct retaliation\nissues that occur but Academia second\nand I and it makes you wonder what are\nthe parameters that\nmake this type of abuse so rampant I\nthink one of the obvious ones is the\nclear ranks how stable the rank ranks\nare how the power structure um of\nAcademia and the military veryy fixed\nnot super debatable not difficult to\nmove these the ranks are you know\nthey're there and the power structure is\nvery skewed and those are the\ningredients\nthat facilitate abuse and so I\nthink in the\nmilitary I could see a very good\nargument for why that hierarch that\nstrict rigid hierarchical structure is\nnecessary there's not time for making\nmistakes get it but with\nAcademia there's there's time there's we\nwhat do we we're not you know it's not a\nwar we're we're just studying stuff that\nwe think is cool why is uh such a rigid\nhierarchy with such devastating\nconsequences necessary I would argue\nmaybe it's not and um I think I've been\nspending a lot of time thinking about\nthis for myself I've been um I I found\nthis professional leadership coach I I\nlove and just thinking about\nsustainability how do we make an a\nsustainable ecosystem and um it's not\nsomething you find in a lot of\nleadership management uh literature that\nI that I've been exposed to so I'll take\nI'll take a note from from the the\npodcast and say if anyone knows of\nliterature that talks about developing\nsustainable um ecosystems within\nleadership and management I would love\nto hear about that in the comments but\num I think that's a big hole um people\nthink about making things stable the\npower structure should be stable but\nactually being flexible and dynamic is\nwhat gives systems resilience and and\nflexibility um to to survive and right\nnow all the cracks in in the towers of\nAcademia are showing and it's time to to\nsee if this is are we going to adapt and\nsurvive or are we going to the crumble\nthere's a lot to unpack there and I'm\ngrateful that you're drilling into all\nof that with I'm sure the same rigor and\num attention to asking the really\ncritical questions that you have in your\nlab um certainly I observe the landscape\nchanging very rapidly um I think there's\nalso a lot to be learned and to explore\nthat um exports to other professions I\ncertainly um believe that the more um\nfirsttime opportunities to experience\nthe beauty of doing research and biology\nin particular because that's what I'm\nfamiliar with um the more likely that we\nare as a field of research and science\nto make more fundamental discoveries in\nother words the more people that get the\nexperience of trying science doing\nexploratory research science the more\nlikely we are to pull from that pool and\nwithin that pool there will be people of\ncompetence uh talent and and also gifted\nlike we just you know sort of like\nincrease the the size of the net y um\nand the net of course is netting\nsomething very specific which is you and\nI both know that um while training\ncertainly matters knowledge is important\num that ultimately you know love of\ncraft and passion um and just being\ntickled by that research bug once that\nneuron that you know gets tickled that\nlets us see something for the first time\nor know something\num down the microscope or in a in a data\nplot or something there's there's really\nno going back so I I you know I want to\nbe very clear that I loudly applaud your\nefforts to extend the experience of\nresearch to people and earlier you were\ntelling me that you're doing this that\nmany of the people in your lab are\nfirsttime researchers they didn't come\nthrough the pedigree of research yeah I\nknow we do a lot of Outreach about 25%\nof my lab this summer was firsttime\nresearch experiences and so um we've\nbeen really privileged to have the\nbandwidth to support that um I will say\nthough I mean on the same tip I think\nwhat you've done with this podcast is\nincredible you've made millions of\npeople who didn't have access to science\nor Neuroscience be fascinated with\nneuroscience and now imagine what if\nevery person that listened to this\npodcast and thought this is such a great\npodcast I wish I could do some\nNeuroscience could do it with some you\nknow not full-time what if they could\ncontribute in any just whatever level\nthat they wanted to that's so much more\ncontribution that we're currently\nmissing out on because there's so many\nbarriers to be able to contribute to\nscience and I think um removing the ones\nthat are really there as well as the\nones that are just perceived to be there\nis so powerful but I mean the podcast is\na a you know proof the proof is in the\npudding the proof is in this podcast how\nmany people could fall in love with\nscience if they were given a chance to M\nwell thank you for that it is indeed a\nlabor of love for me and um and there\nare opportunities maybe we'll provide a\nlink to a couple of them um where uh\ncertain projects in Neuroscience are\ncrowdsourcing data analysis is actually\nquite fun there's the connectone project\nwhere you can trace neurons it's\nactually very very pleasing you can do\nit while listening to podcast or a book\nkids can do it you're you're tracing\nthese neurons basically filling in lines\nit's like a coloring book and you're\ncontributing to the parcelation of\nunderstanding the structure of of the\nbrain including the human brain and\nwithout that crowd sourcing um it's just\nnot going to happen I mean there efforts\nto make machine learning do it and to do\nit through AI but that there's a lot to\nbe gained from having actual humans do\nthis that those Technologies don't quite\nyet approximate so we'll provide a link\nto to some of those projects but listen\nK Dr Tai of course um I want to thank\nyou so much first of all for coming here\ntoday and sharing so much knowledge and\nalso being willing to go into some\nplaces that were um by virtue of my\nquestions a little speculative and and\nand really think about those and and and\naddress those through the lens of of\ndeep mechanistic understanding of how\nthese circuits work and to make it clear\nto people um your enthusiasm for science\nis infectious in the most positive sense\nof the word and I know that so many\npeople are going to benefit from from\nyour knowledge and also from the work\nthat you've been doing in your\nlaboratory you know I've seen your star\nrise and it's um still going going going\nand it's just remarkable and\nextraordinary but I must say not at all\nsurprising so um that and your advocacy\nwork and for all you do and that you're\ndoing um I just on behalf of myself and\neveryone listening I just want to extend\na genuine and really heartfelt thanks\nthank you thank you so much and it's\nbeen such an honor to be on the Hub Lab\npodcast it's legendary so thank you
