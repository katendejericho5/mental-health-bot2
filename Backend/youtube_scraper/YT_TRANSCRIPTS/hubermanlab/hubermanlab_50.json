    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing working\nmemory working memory is a special\ncategory of memory in which we are able\nto hold small amounts of information in\nour mind for short periods of time\nworking memory is also very closely\nrelated to attention so for any of you\nthat are interested in how to develop\nbetter focus and attention understanding\nwhat working memory is and some of the\nthings that you can do to improve your\nworking memory can be very beneficial\ntoday I'm going to talk about what\nworking memory is including some of the\nunderlying biology although I promise\nirrespective of whether or not you know\nany biology or you are an expert in\nbiology I'll make the conversation\naccessible to you in addition I will\ntalk about tools to improve working\nmemory and I'll also compare working\nmemory to other forms of memory memory\nlike long-term memory and short-term\nmemory and through that understanding\nI'm confident that you'll be able to\ndevelop better focus as well as be able\nto commit certain forms of information\nto your short and long-term memory\nstores before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfor my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is matina\nmatina makes loose leaf and ready to\ndrink ybba mate I often discuss ybba\nmate's benefits such as regulating blood\nsugar it's high antioxidant content the\nways that it can improve digestion and\npossible neuroprotective effects I also\ndrink yamate because I love the taste\nwhile there are a lot of different\nchoices of yerbamate drinks out there I\nlove matina because again they have the\nno sugar variety as well as the fact\nthat both their loose leaf and their\ncanned varieties are of the the absolute\nbest quality so much so that I decided\nto become a partial owner in the company\nalthough I must say even if they hadn't\nallowed me to do that I would be\ndrinking matina is the cleanest tasting\nand best yerbamate you can find I love\nthe taste of brooded loose leaf matina\nyerbamate and I particularly love the\ntaste of maa's new canned cold brew zero\nsugar yerbamate which I personally help\nthem develop if you'd like to try matina\ngo to drink maa.com Huber\nRight Now matina is offering a free one\nPB bag of loose leaf yerbamate tea and\nfree shipping with the purchase of two\ncases of their cold brew yamate again\nthat's drink maa.com huberman to get the\nfree bag of yamate looseleaf tea and\nfree shipping today's episode is also\nbrought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp\noffers Professional Therapy with a\nlicensed therapist carried out online\nnow I've been going to therapy for well\nover 30 years initially I didn't have a\nchoice it was a condition of being\nallowed to stay in school but pretty\nsoon I realized that therapy is\nextremely valuable in fact I consider\ndoing regular therapy just as important\nas getting regular exercise including\ncardiovascular exercise and resistance\ntraining which of course I also do every\nweek the reason I know therapy is so\nvaluable is that if you can find a\ntherapist with whom you can develop a\nreally good rapport you not only get\nterrific support for some of the\nchallenges in your life but you also can\nderive tremendous insights from that\ntherapy insights that can allow you to\nbetter not just your emotional life and\nyour relationship life but of of course\nalso the relationship to yourself and to\nyour professional life to all sorts of\ncareer goals in fact I see therapy is\none of the key components for meshing\ntogether all aspects of one's life and\nbeing able to really direct one's focus\nand attention toward what really matters\nif you'd like to try betterhelp go to\nbetterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off\nyour first month again that's\nbetterhelp.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by Helix sleep helix IC sleep\nmakes mattresses and pillows that are of\nthe absolute highest quality I've spoken\nmany times before on this and other\npodcast about the fact that sleep is the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance one of the key\nthings to getting a great night's sleep\nis to make sure that your mattress\nmatches your sleep requirements the\nHelix website has a brief two-minute\nquiz that if you go to it will ask you\nquestions such as do you sleep on your\nback your side or your stomach do you\ntend to run hot or cold during the\nmiddle of the night as well as some\nother questions that allow you to\ndetermine the optimal mattress for you\nwhen I took the quiz I personally\nmatched to their dusk mattress D which\nhas allowed me to significantly improve\nmy sleep so if you're interested in\nsignificantly improving your sleep go to\nhelixsleep.com\nhuberman take their brief two-minute\nquiz and they'll match you to a\ncustomized mattress and you'll get up to\n$350 off any mattress order and two free\npillows so again if you're interested in\ntrying Helix go to helixsleep.com\nhuberman for up to $350 off and two fore\nfree pillows okay let's talk about\nworking memory and let's start off this\ndiscussion by comparing working memory\nto other forms of memory that most\npeople are more familiar with or at\nleast when most people hear the word\nmemory they typically are thinking about\nlong-term memory like one's ability to\nremember the capitals of states or\ncountries the different continents\ndirections from one location to another\neven one's name all of those things are\nexamples of long-term memory now I want\nto emphasize that long-term memory\nreally has two components there are what\nwe call declarative long-term memories\nso these are the things that we can\ndeclare things like facts about\nourselves or the world or others and\nthen there are procedural long-term\nmemories procedural long-term memories\nas the name suggests are aspects of our\nmemory that allow us to perform certain\nprocedures they are literally action\nsteps that we take to for instance ride\na bicycle or drive a car which by the\nway we might not be conscious of\nourselves doing after we learn that is\nafter we pass information into our\nprocedural long-term memory but even\nonce those things become reflexive they\nare stored in our long-term memory now a\ndiscussion of long-term memory is not\nthe focus today but me being a\nneuroscientist and I like to think you\nall generally being interested in the\nunderlying biology I'll just mention\nthat there's a key structure within the\nbrain that is part of a larger neural\nnetwork that is a collection of\nstructures which is absolutely essential\nfor the formation and storage of\nlong-term memories and that's the\nhippocampus which in Latin means\nseahorse and it does look a little bit\nlike a seahorse but you actually have\none on each side of your brain so we say\nhippocampi plural and so what we know is\nthat if people have damage to their\nhippocampus of any kind that people have\ntrouble accessing or forming long-term\nmemory sometimes both and there's a lot\nmore that we could say about long-term\nmemory indeed I did an entire episode of\nThe hubman Lab podcast about the\nformation and storage of long-term\nmemories including some tools to improve\nlong-term memories we'll touch on a few\nof those tools later today but you can\naccess that episode if you go to hubman\nlab.com and just put memory into the\nsearch function and you'll find it there\nin the meantime if we want to understand\nworking memory we not only have to\nunderstand how it's different from\nlong-term memory but also how it's\ndifferent from short-term memories\nshort-term memory is a capacity that we\nall have that as the name suggests\nrepresents a short-term memory bank for\ninformation that may or may not get\npassed into long-term memory so for\ninstance if you've learned anything and\nof course you have if you can understand\nwhat I'm saying you've learned English\nlanguage if you can write you've learned\nhow to write Etc well in order to learn\nthose things and to commit them to\nlong-term memory the information\nrequired to do those things and to have\nthat knowledge needed to be held in\nshort-term memory and short-term\nmemories are the sorts of memories that\nwe maintain for somewhere between a few\nminutes and potentially a few hours\nmaybe a little bit longer but only a\ncertain percentage of that is passed\ninto our long-term memory so for\ninstance if you listen to this podcast\nor you go to a course lecture uh whether\nor not that lecture is about cognitive\nmaterial or whether or not it's about\nlearning a new physical skill regardless\nof what you learn you're only going to\nlearn a certain amount of that\ninformation but were we to examine how\nmuch of the information you just heard\nor that you're hearing now you remember\nimmediately after this podcast episode\nas compared to say a week later we know\nbased on gosh millions of scientific\npapers and studies that you are going to\nhave more information in your short-term\nmemory stores shortly after being\nexposed to new information then you will\nlater in other words only a small\npercentage of what we perceive what we\nsee what we hear Etc gets passed into\nshort-term memory and then only a\nfraction of that gets passed into\nlong-term memory now the neural circuits\nfor short-term memory and the passage of\nshort-term memories into long-term\nmemory involve a lot of different brain\nstructures but here again we can\nimplicate the hip hi campus Because the\nactual passage of short-term memories\ninto long-term memories occurs in part\nwithin the hippocampus and then a lot of\npeople don't know this some of the\nmemories that we think of as long-term\nmemories are actually distributed into\nthe neocortex which is the outer portion\nof the brain now the point here is less\nto fill your mind with different names\nof things and nomenclature but rather to\nget you thinking about what's involved\nin creating short and long-term memories\nand equally important that even though\nthe hippocampus is critically involved\nin the formation of short and long-term\nmemories that the formation of short and\nlong-term memories is really a network\nphenomenon in fact among the more\nimportant themes that comes up again and\nagain on this podcast anytime that we're\ntalking about Neuroscience or actually\nbiology in any case is that rarely if\never is there one location in the brain\nwhere something happens typically it's a\nnetwork phenomenon meaning it's the\ncollaboration of a bunch of different\nbrain areas passing information from one\nlocation to the next and storing it in a\nkind of distributed way way now another\nkey thing to understand about working\nmemory and how it is different from\nshort and long-term memory is that the\nformation of short and long-term\nmemories almost always involves\nneuroplasticity neuroplasticity is the\nnervous system's ability to change in\nresponse to experience now there are\ndifferent types of neuroplasticity so\noften when we hear about neuroplasticity\nin the popular sphere people don't\nemphasize that there are different types\nof neuroplasticity and it's worth paying\na little bit of attention to what those\ndifferent typ are there is for instance\nwhat we call long-term potentiation\nlong-term potentiation or ltp as the\nacronym goes is the strengthening of\nconnections between neurons as a\nconsequence of their repeated firing\nvery closely together in time okay\nthere's a lot more to it but if you've\never heard the phrase fire together wire\ntogether sometimes that is misattributed\nto Donald Hebb who did talk about\nneuroplasticity by the way Donald Hebb\nwas a psychologist up in Canada who\ntalked about neuroplasticity in the\ncontext of lots of different forms of\nlearning but that fire together wire\ntogether phrase was not actually stated\nby Donald Hebb it was stated by Carla\nshatz my colleague at Stanford and she\nwas referring to ltp but other forms of\nneuroplasticity that occur mainly in\ndevelopment when neurons fire very\nclosely in time and thereby strengthen\nthose connections which can include ltp\nokay so for now think of ltp as anytime\nthat some small group of neurons could\nbe two neurons\ncould be 2,000 neurons are very active\nclosely together in time and they have\naccess to one another physically and the\nconsequence is often not always but it's\noften ltp that is the strengthening of\nthose connections such that after that\nbarrage of activity subsides those\nneurons can speak to each other they can\ncommunicate through electrical activity\nand chemical activity much more easily\ntheir communication is more robust it's\nlike removing a wall between a a\nconversation such that the conversation\ncan take place more fluidly now there\nare other forms of neuroplasticity\nincluding LTD longterm depression which\nunfortunately the name often calls to\nmind ideas about depression as a\npsychiatric or a psychological symptom\nbut has nothing to do with that\nlong-term depression is simply the\ninverse of ltp it's actually the\nweakening or the removal of connections\nthat we call synapses between neurons I\nwant to emphasize that both ltp and LTD\nare both critically involved in lots of\ndifferent kinds of learning and both of\nthem tend to be involved in the\nformation of both short-term memories\nand long-term memories and this is very\nimportant in the removal of short-term\nmemories and long-term memories\nliterally forgetting of certain things\nbecause as we all know there are many\nthings that we will never forget and\nthere are also things that we almost\nalways forget now there's a third form\nof neuroplasticity that's involved in\nthe formation of short and long-term\nmemories that's important for us to\ndiscuss just briefly but I do want to\nemphasize that there are not just three\nforms of neuroplasticity there are many\nother forms dozens if not more things\nlike Spike timing dependent plasticy\npaired pulse facilitation and on and on\nbut the third type of neuroplasticity\nthat I'd like to mention now is\nneurogenesis neurogenesis is the\nformation of new neurons now\nneurogenesis is robust in the developing\nnervous system we know this it's robust\nin the developing nervous system of\nanimals and humans however neurogenesis\nthe literal formation of new neurons in\nthe brain is a very exciting idea and it\ndoes occur and it's very exciting in a\nway that has motivated lots of popular\npress Outlets to talk about or to\ndiscuss papers that have discovered\nneurogenesis in the adult brain because\nlet's be honest what's more exciting\nthan the idea that your brain can add\nnew brain cells later in life and indeed\nthat has been shown even in people well\ninto their 80s and 90s however it's very\nimportant to know that the total amount\nof neurogenesis that occurs in the adult\nhuman brain is infantes small as a\nmechanism for neuroplasticity and\nlearning as compared to the other forms\nof neuroplasticity that we discussed\nsuch as long-term potentiation and\nlong-term depression so I don't want to\nyou know throw cold water on the topic\nof neurogenesis it's an incredibly\ninteresting and important topic but all\ntoo often they tend to eclipse the much\nmore common mechanism for the formation\nof short and long-term memories which\nare those other forms we just talked\nabout ltp LTD Etc so the point here is\nthat yes indeed there are new neurons\nthat can be added in the adult brain\nmaybe even in the adult human brain and\nthere is some evidence that some of\nthose new neurons are added to the\nhippocampus in fact a particular region\nof the hippocampus called the dentate\ngyrus of the hippocampus and there's\nbeen a lot of controversy about how much\nneurogenesis occurs or doesn't occur and\nwhether or not it occurs after puberty\nor not there's a whole field of people\nbattling over this now for several\ndecades ades but one thing is very clear\nneurogenesis while it's very exciting\nand intriguing is not the main mechanism\nby which the formation of short and\nlong-term memories occurs when you learn\nnew information as you are right now the\nstorage of that information in your\nshort-term memory networks which is then\npassed on to your long-term memory\nnetworks and that can be recalled that\nallows you to State certain facts about\nfor instance the existence of this thing\ncalled a hippocampus hopefully you will\nremember that going forward or your\nability to perform any kind of motor\nmovement that you learned now or way\nback in\nchildhood most of that is the\nconsequence of the strengthening of\nparticular connections and the weakening\nof other types of connections those are\nthe two major forms of neuroplasticity\nokay so I don't want you to get the\nimpression that there's something wrong\nwith my memory and that I forgot that\nthis episode is not about short or\nlong-term memory but it's about working\nmemory and indeed I have not forgotten\nso now is where I tell you why I've been\ntalking about short and long-term memory\nand the mechanisms of those because I\nwant them to provide a stark contrast\nfor what we call working memory working\nmemory as far as we know does not\ninvolve neuroplasticity or at least if\nit does it's not a particularly robust\naspect of working memory rather working\nmemory is the reflection of a particular\nneural circuit running an algorithm over\nand over and over for different types of\ninformation but the information isn't\nstored it is actually intentionally\ndiscarded now what sorts of daily\nactivities and life activities would\nrequire working memory the answer to\nthat is basically everything that you\nneed to do but that you don't want to\nremember now what types of things would\nthose be well let's think about it most\nall of us learned at some point in our\nlife to tie our own shoes presumably you\nknow how to tie your own shoes if you\ndon't perhaps you should learn or wear\nvelcro or slippers I don't know but\nassuming you can tie your own shoes\nthat's something that you know how to do\nand you can do it as a procedural\nlong-term memory you can do that action\nyou don't have to think about it too\nmuch working memory would come into play\nwhen say you wake up in the morning and\nyou know that you need to head out for a\njog but you also need to make a cup of\ncoffee first and you need to remember\nwhere the coffee is where your shoes are\nand perhaps you're making a phone call\nor you're having a conversation while\nyou need to tie your shoes and so on and\nso forth working memory is basically the\ntaking in of information that's critical\nfor you to sequence your actions over a\nshort period of time and then forget\nthat sequence for instance I'm willing\nto bet that you put your shoes on to go\nrunning before you go running that's\nsort of a duh and if you're like me you\ndrink your water your coffee your yante\nbefore you go running the point here is\nthat if you wake up in the morning and\nyou like caffeine before you go for a\nrun there are certain series of action\nsteps that you need to carry out to\nhydrate make that cup of coffee or tea\ndrink it put on your shoes head out the\ndoor you need to sequence things\nproperly but you don't want to to commit\nyour long-term or even your short-term\nmemory stores to carrying out that\nsequence you simply want to be able to\ncarry out that sequence and then discard\nthat information about the sequence and\nfocus your attention on for instance\nwhat trajectory you're going to run\nthrough the park or around your\nneighborhood then you want to discard\nthat information and you want to lean\ninto the next portion of your day and so\non and so on in fact working memory is\ninvolved in essentially every activity\nboth cognitive and motor from the point\nwake up in the morning until the time\nyou go to sleep at night for every\nsingle day of your life and we know this\nbecause there are indeed people who have\ndiminished working memory or even lack\nworking memory entirely although the\nlatter is somewhat rare it has happened\nand as you can imagine they have a\ncomplete failure of ability to sequence\nactivities and their lives are extremely\ndifficult they need a ton of assistance\nfrom other people even more assistants\nthan do people who have minimal or no\nlong-term memory okay so this is really\nhighlighting just how important working\nmemory is working memory is basically\nthe way that you navigate any immediate\nenvironment and as I mentioned earlier\nit's very closely tied to attention\nbecause in order to know what to do now\nand then what to do subsequently and\nthen subsequent to that you need to be\nable to hold your attention to the\nthings you need to do so working memory\nand attention collaborate literally at a\nneural circuit level and at a\nneurochemical level in order to allow\nyou to move through your day in an\nAdaptive functional way and people who\nhave challenges with attention or Focus\nor working memory and sometimes it can\nbe hard to dissociate which one they're\nhaving challenges with really have a\nhard time moving through life as\ncompared to people whose attention and\nworking memory is more robust now the\ngood news is today we're going to talk\nabout working memory some of the neural\ncircuits involved and some of the\nneurochemicals involved that can augment\nor improve working memory and we're also\ngoing to talk about what one can do to\ndirectly increase the amount of\nneurotransmission of those particular\nchemicals within the circuits that\ncontrol working memory in other words to\nimprove your working memory now I can\ntalk about working memory and the\nmechanisms Etc all day long but as is\noften the case sometimes it's better to\nnot just learn about Concepts but\nactually to experience them in real time\nso what we're going to do now is I'm\nactually going to give you a working\nmemory test this is the sort of working\nmemory test that you would take if you\nwere to go into a psychology laboratory\nor a neuroscience Laboratory and they\nwere studying working memory in humans\nnow there's another advantage to us\ndoing this in real time right here as\nyou're listening or as you're listening\nand watching and that's because you're\ngoing to get data you're going to get\ninformation about what your Baseline\nworking memory capacity is and you're\ngoing to want to keep those data in your\nshort-term memory stores maybe even your\nlong-term memory stores but certainly\nyour short-term memory stores because\nshortly later in this episode I'm going\nto talk about different ways to improve\nyour working memory depending on where\nyour Baseline working memory starts\nwhich by the way turns out to be a\npretty good proxy for the levels of a\nneuromodulator called dopamine within\nthe neural circuits that control working\nmemory so right now let's take a working\nmemory task we're going to do this\npurely through audio form because I\nrealize some people are watching and\nlistening to this on YouTube and others\nare just listening to this episode so\nthere are not going to be any visual\ncues or slides that I present and that's\nperhaps what distinguishes what we're to\ndo most from what would happen in a\nlaboratory typically in a laboratory\nthere would be some visual presentation\nof what I'm about to say but here\nbecause of the format that most of you\nare consuming this information by we're\ngoing to do this purely by Audio so the\nfirst test of your working memory is\nvery simple I'm going to read off a\nseries of letters and your task is to\nremember as many of those letters as you\ncan the first string of letters is J K k\nz p\ni okay just to make this really easy I'm\ngoing to say it twice although typically\nin a working memory task it would just\nbe said once but I'm going to make this\nextra easy j k z p\ni okay now you in your own head can try\nand recite back those letters if you\nlike okay second string of letters r r o\nm k l\ne I'm going to make this extra simple\nand do it again not typical for a\nworking memory task but there are some\nworking memory tasks where that happens\nr o m k l\ne okay now a third string of letters\nthis one's going to be a little bit\nlonger so queue up that working memory\nand\nattention w a c q v d\nn I'll repeat that again w a c q v d\nn how many of the letters I just read\ncan you remember okay so depending on\nhow many letters you can remember\nperhaps you have a low moderate or high\ndegree of working\nmemory keep in mind that some of you are\nperhaps doing other things you're\nattending to driving or other tasks\nwithin your home or your office and so\nperhaps you weren't able to pay full\nattention so there'll be some variation\nthere but nonetheless after reading each\nof those strings of letters you were\nasked to recall those letters in your\nmind and if you wrote them down and\nyou're rereading them yes that's\ncheating but how about this what if I\nwere to ask you now about the simplest\nfirst string of letters the one that\nconsisted of only five letters how many\nof you can remember any of those five\nletters\nnow okay I can't hear you if you're\nshouting them out uh I can't see you if\nyou're raising your hand but chances are\nmost of you have forgotten the first\nseries of letters even though it was\nquite short and you could remember it\nearly on that ability to remember that\nstring of letters when you first heard\nthem and indeed I read them twice so I'd\nbe very surprised if any of you couldn't\nremember that string of letters after\nhearing them twice but I also read you\nsome other letters in the interim okay\nso that now just a couple minutes later\nI'm asking you to remember that first\nstring of five letters and assuming that\nyou didn't write it down you're not\ncheating chances are you remember\nanywhere from two to zero of those\nletters in that first word which is a\nperfect example of your working memory\nnothing got committed to short-term much\nless long-term memory rather your\nworking memory was able to work with\nthat information hold it in mind for\njust as long as you thought you needed\nto know that information but then thank\ngoodness that information was discarded\nyou didn't know that I was going to ask\nyou for that first string of letters\nagain after reading you the longer\nstring of letters but I did that\ndeliberately to show you how your\nworking memory works so in some sense\nthe working memory task is a bit unusual\nin that it's a test of yes memory in the\nvery very short term but also a test of\nyour ability to forget to discard\ninformation that's not critical and that\ngets us back to the original definition\nof working memory which is our ability\nto attend to specific small batches of\ninformation remember it for just as long\nas we think we need to and then to\ndiscard that information and by the way\nif you want to know what those first\nfive letters were they were j k z p i\nI'd like to take a brief moment and\nthank one of our sponsors and that's ag1\nag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens I started\ntaking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I\nstarted taking it and the reason I still\ntake it every day is that it ensures\nthat I meet all of my quotas for\nvitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support support gut health\nnow gut health is something that over\nthe last 10 years we realized is not\njust important for the health of our gut\nbut also for our immune system and for\nthe production of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are a number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in efficient quantities so ag1\nallows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports\nso many different systems within the\nbody that are involved in mental health\nphysical health and performance to try\nag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and\nyou'll get a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 and five free travel packs of of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman so now is where we talk a\nlittle bit about the neural circuitry\nand the neurochemistry of working memory\nnow it's important that we do this\nbecause in a few minutes you're also\ngoing to learn that people generally\nfall into two broad bins of having a\nhigh or low Baseline of a certain\nneurochemical in the brain that affords\nthem either high or low working memory\ncapacity now in reality it's a\ndistribution in fact it's what we call a\nnormal distribution so it really isn't\ntwo bins but during today's discussion\nand in fact in a lot of laboratory\nstudies we can actually bin people into\nthese two groups the neural circuitry\nunderlying working memory involves a lot\nof different brain locations that is a\nlot of different neural networks\ncollaborating to create this thing we\ncall working memory however there are a\ncouple of key hubs that is locations\nwithin the brain that are especially\nimportant for working memory the ones\nthat I'd like to focus focus on today\ninvolve the prefrontal cortex so this is\nneural real estate that resides just\nbehind the forehead and the neurons in\nthe brain stem so further back in the\nbrain that manufacture dopamine and that\nsend their little wires that we call\naxons up to the prefrontal cortex to\nrelease dopamine dopamine is a\nneuromodulator many people are familiar\nwith dopamine and familiar with it in\nthe context of motivation and drive\nsometimes people mistakenly think it's\nonly involved in pleasure but dopamine\nis involved in motivation and drive when\ndopamine systems go Ary that is if their\nlevels get too high that can create\nmanic States it can create addictive\nStates when dopamine levels are too low\nyou can get movement challenges such as\nin Parkinson's which is a deficit or a\nliteral destruction of the neurons that\nmanufacture dopamine there are a bunch\nof different areas of the brain that\nthose dopamine neurons in the brain stem\nproject to but for right now we're going\nto focus almost entirely on the dopamine\nprojections from the brain stem to the\nprefrontal cortex which is called the\nmisoc cortical circuitry I'm not going\nto get into the origins or the meaning\nof the misoc cortical versus other\ndopamine projection systems I did that\nin a couple of episodes about ADHD and\nattention and dopamine in particular and\nyou can find those at huberman lab.com\njust put dopamine and circuits into the\nsearch function and it will take you to\nthose particular time stamps where I\ndescribe that but since we want to keep\nthings fairly top Contour at the level\nof neural circuit here just know that\nthere are a bunch of neurons that\nmanufacture dopamine back in the brain\nstem that send their axons those little\nwires up to the prefrontal cortex and\nthat the amount of dopamine\nreleased per unit time so in a certain\namount of time strongly dictates the\nextent to which working memory capacity\nis going to be high medium or low now I\nwant to be very clear because I'm going\nto come back to this a little bit later\nagain and\nagain it is the case that when dopamine\nlevels are lower that is either there\nare fewer neurons that have the\npotential to release dopamine in the\nfrontal cortex or for whatever reason\nless is being released in the frontal\ncortex that working memory performance\ntends to be lower as compared to\nconditions where dopamine release or the\navailability of dopamine is higher\nhowever it is not the case that more\ndopamine is always going to equate to\nimproved working memory this is so\nimportant that I'm going to say it again\nit is not always the case that\nincreasing the amount of dopamine\nTransmission in the frontal cortex leads\nto improvements in working memory there\nis a specific criteria that allows us to\npredict whether or not it will improve\nor maintain or actually degrade working\nmemory performance so before you head to\nthe end of the podcast to try and figure\nout ways to increase dopamine to improve\nworking memory please keep that fact in\nmind don't just commit it to your\nworking memory commit it to your short\nand long-term memory because that's very\nimportant if your goal is to improve\nyour working memory with that said I do\nwant to describe just a little little\nbit of research showing the relationship\nbetween having a low working memory span\nas it's called the ability to only\nremember a few letters or numbers or\nshort batches of information as compared\nto a high working memory span meaning\nlonger strings of letters longer strings\nof numbers which of course in the real\nworld translates to being able to carry\nout shorter versus longer action\nsequences as described earlier in the\nscenario where you're getting up in the\nmorning and you're making coffee and\nyou're heading out for run etc etc\npeople do differ in terms of their\nworking memory capacity and there's a\nclassic study done by kols and desposito\nand colleagues this was published in\n2008 where they had a way to label the\namount of dopamine that is available for\nrelease in the frontal cortex in human\nsubjects they did this by the injection\nof a specific Dy that Dy gets taken up\nspecifically by the neurons in the brain\nthat manufacture dopamine then they were\nable to image the brains of those people\nwhile those people were Wide Awake using\nsomething called positron emission\ntomorrow graphy again the specific tool\nisn't necessarily important but since\nsome of you like to know and what they\nfound is that for people that had a high\nworking memory span that is could\nremember long strings of numbers or\nletters or other information they tended\nto be the people that had more dopamine\navailable for release in the frontal\ncortex either because they had more of\nthe dopamine neurons themselves or\nsimilar number of neurons but those\nneurons had more dopamine to release\nokay and they also found the converse\nindividuals that had a low working\nmemory span and ability had less\ndopamine available for release so that\nestablishes a correlation but it's not\ncausal a different study which is also a\nclassic was carried out by brazowy Brown\nroswold and Goldman and this is a really\nimportant study because in this study\nthey were able to introduce small\namounts of dopamine directly into the\ncortex and evaluate working memory\ncapacity now anytime working memory test\nis done the same pattern always emerges\nthis is regardless of any dopamine being\ninfused into the brain which is people\nand animals for that matter are very\ngood at remembering short spans of\nnumbers letters or other types of\ninformation so if you tell them one\nthing like the letter a and then you ask\nthem do you remember the letter almost\neverybody remembers that but if you give\nthem a string of 10 letters they\nremember fewer of those 10 letters\nthat's sort of obvious but it's an\nimportant point to emphasize nonetheless\nand so there's a kind of a dropping off\ncurve of performance as one progresses\nfrom fewer to Greater number of items to\nbe remembered in this study when\ndopamine was introduced to the frontal\ncortex the number of things that\nindividuals could remember simply\nincreased it was a very straightforward\nresult more dopamine introduced allowed\nlonger letter number and information\nstrings to be remembered and of course\nforgotten because that's what working\nmemory involves remembering and then\ndiscarding of information shortly\nthereafter now the findings I just\ndescribed complement what I said before\nwhich is the naturally occurring\nexperiment bring people into the lab\nmeasure their working memory span look\nat how much dopamine they make higher\ndopamine better working memory lower\ndopamine lower working\nmemory the experiment I just described\nwas one in which dopamine is introduced\nshowing that dopamine is very likely the\nrate limiting or the capacity limiting\nit's probably the better way to put it\nthe capacity limiting neurom modulator\nfor improving working memory that's a\nfancy nerd speaker way of saying more\ndopamine allows for better working\nmemory but a critical feature of this\nexperiment is that they did a number of\nexperiments where they didn't introduce\ndopamine but instead they introduced\nother neuromodulators to the prefrontal\ncortex such as\nnorepinephrine or serotonin and the\ninteresting finding is that the addition\nof norepinephrine or serotonin which of\ncourse are other neuromodulators that\ncan change the firing patterns of\nneurons in the prefrontal cortex but\nelsewhere as well it's just that in this\ncase they were added to the prefrontal\ncortex had no effect on working memory\nit neither improved nor degraded working\nmemory when those neuromodulators were\nintroduced in other words dopamine and\nperhaps only dopamine seems to be the\ndominant neuromodulator for regulating\nthe degree that is whether or not you\nhave small medium or large amounts of\nworking memory capacity in the\nprefrontal cortex and of course there\nhave been a bunch of other experiments\nthat are worth mentioning briefly in\nthis context such as taking people that\nhave a high working memory capacity and\nindeed have their brains imaged and one\nsees that they have high levels of\nBaseline dopamine especially the\ndopamine projecting to the prefrontal\ncortex and then they're given a drug\nthat depletes dopamine within the\nprefrontal cortex and their performance\ndrops and so what's so nice about the\nliterature around working memory is that\nwhile I'm not covering all of that\nliterature exhaustively it all tends to\nJive it all points in a direction\nwhereby the levels of of dopamine being\nreleased in the prefrontal cortex during\nworking memory tasks correlates very\nstrongly with capacity to perform\nworking memory tasks lower dopamine\nlower working memory span as it's called\nhigher dopamine higher working memory\nspan okay so next we're going to do\nanother working memory task different\nthan the one we did earlier and we're\ngoing to do that with a specific purpose\nin mind which is for you to be able to\ndetermine what your working memory\ncapacity is and by extension your\nBaseline levels of dopamine or at least\nthe levels of dopamine that are likely\nbeing released into your prefrontal\ncortex while you do these working memory\ntasks in other words we're going to try\nand figure out whether or not you are of\nthe low medium or high working memory\ncapacity and of course we're doing that\nin part to try and establish whether or\nnot you likely have low medium or high\namounts of dopamine available for\nrelease in the prefrontal cortex of\ncourse we're not putting you into a\npositron Omission tomography scanning\ndevice we aren't able to do that for\nobvious reasons but keep in mind that\nwhat we about to do is very similar and\nin some cases identical to laboratory\nstudies where the researchers were\ntrying to determine what people's levels\nof dopamine within these particular\nneural networks we've been discussing\nthe misoc cortical pathway are likely to\nbe in other words performance on The\nWorking memory task that we are about to\ndo is a decent indication of what the\ndopamine levels that are available for\nrelease in your prefrontal cortex\nperhaps might be now I say perhaps might\nbe because I don't want to cause any\nunnecessary alarm if for instance you\nfall into the low working memory span\ngroup in fact if you fall into the low\nworking memory span group there are\nactually some terrific tools that you\ncan use to improve dopamine Transmission\nin those Pathways and improve your\nworking memory I also don't want people\nto get the impression that somehow\nperformance on this working memory task\nis reflective of some larger dopamine\nissue in the brain and certainly it is\nnot I repeat it is not diagnostic of\nParkinson's or any kind of neurod deener\ngenerative condition although I will say\nthat deficits in working memory are\ncommon in patients with Parkinson for\nobvious reasons those patients have\ndeficits in dopamine neurons not only\nproduction but the number of dopamine\nneurons it's one of the Hallmark\nfeatures of Parkinson's but also in\nthings like traumatic brain injury Etc\nbut the working memory task that you're\nabout to take when given to a general\npopulation or a group of undergraduates\nor you know so-called normals or typical\ncontrol subjects which all of you are\nokay so unless you're dealing with with\na traumatic brain injury or you know you\nhave Parkinson's we know that the data\nthat you're going to get back right now\nis very similar to the data that people\nget back when they do these sorts of\nstudies in a laboratory that is it's\ntypical for some people to have a short\nworking memory span some people to have\na medium working memory span and some\npeople that have a high working memory\nspan and today we're actually just going\nto divide into two bins short working\nmemory span and high working memory span\nand we can have some degree of\nconfidence that correlates with the\namount of dopamine available for release\nin the front Al cortex but and this is a\nvery important Point as we progress\nalong this discussion of working memory\nthe neural circuits dopamine Etc I want\nto make clear something that I said\nearlier which is that it is not the case\nthat increasing the amount of dopamine\nthat's available always increases\nworking memory spin in fact there's a\ncommon circumstance whereby people with\na relatively High degree of working\nmemory capacity increase their dopamine\nlevels even further using pharmacology\nor other methods that we'll discuss and\ntheir per performance actually can\ndegrade okay so if any of that is\nconfusing now we'll make it all very\nsimple going forward so that if you\ndecide to implement any of the protocols\ndiscussed in this episode that you are\naware of what you can expect and whether\nor not you in the category of people\nthat should or perhap should not\nincorporate those protocols okay let's\ntest your working memory again this time\nthe working memory task is going to be a\nlittle bit different than the one you\ndid previously this working memory task\ninvolves me reading six different\nsentences to you and your job is to pay\nattention to these six sentences because\nyou're going to be asked some\ninformation about these sentences in a\nfew moments the first sentence is real\nestate costs are going\nup the second sentence is the Atlantic\nOcean is warm in\nsummer the third sentence is there's a\nlot of interest now in electric\ncars the fourth sentence is some\nreptiles eat only one once a\nyear the fifth sentence is kids nowadays\nlook at screens more than 60% of their\nWaking\nLife and the sixth and final sentence is\nfootball can mean different sports\ndepending on the\ncountry okay so I read you six sentences\nthey were moderately long I confess your\njob for the working memory task is now\nto recall as many of the final words of\neach of those sentences as you can I'll\ngive you a few moments to do that now\nbefore I tell you what the final word of\neach of those sentences actually is I\nwant to remind everybody that working\nmemory capacity follows a normal\ndistribution so some of you will be able\nto remember the final word of perhaps\nfive or even six of those sentences\nalthough I must say that is exceedingly\nrare some of you are going to be able to\nremember three to four of the final\nwords of those sentences and that's more\ntypical that actually represents the\naverage or the mean as we call it and\nthen fewer people although still many of\nyou will only be able to remember one or\ntwo of the final words of those\nsentences okay so now I'm assuming that\nmost of you have tried to call to memory\nthe final word of as many of those six\nsentences as you can and maybe you've\nwritten them down or you've typed them\ninto your phone or you have some record\nof what you recall those six final words\nof those sentences are now I'm going to\ntell you the actual final word of each\nof those sentences the final word of the\nfirst sentence was up because as you may\nrecall the sentence was real estate\ncosts are going up the final word of the\nsecond sentence was summer because the\nsentence was the Atlantic Ocean is warm\nin summer the final word of the third\nsentence was Cars because the sentence\nwas there is a lot of interest in\nelectric cars the final word of the\nfourth sentence was year because the\nsentence was some reptiles eat only once\na year the final word of the fifth\nsentence was life because the sentence\nwas kids nowadays look at screens more\nthan 60% of their Waking Life and the\nfinal word of the sixth sentence was\ncountry because the sentence was\nfootball can mean different sports\ndepending on the country okay so be\nhonest with yourself and tell yourself\nand you don't have to tell anyone else\nif you don't want to how many of the\nfinal words of those six sentences you\ncould remember correctly it's important\nthat you remember them correctly again\nthe number of words that you can recall\nthat is your working memory span is\ngoing to vary from person to person but\nwe can take the normal distribution of\nthose scores and sort of draw a line\ndown the middle and say that if you\ncould remember three to six of the final\nwords of those sentences correctly\nyou're going to fall into the high\nworking memory span group whereas if you\ncould only remember one or two or maybe\nzero of the final words of those six\nsent\nthen you're going to be in the low\nworking memory span group again I don't\nwant to alarm anybody this doesn't mean\nthat you have any Global memory deficits\nor dopamine deficits but it is important\nespecially if you plan to apply any of\nthe protocols to improve working memory\nthat you Faithfully that is you\naccurately report your working memory\nperformance at least to yourself now as\nyou recall whether or not you have low\nor high and here we are just binning\ninto low and high there's no medium\nwe've divided right at that line we're\nsaying if you can remember 3 to six\nwe're calling that high working memory\nspan at least for this discussion and if\nyou can remember fewer than three even\ndown to zero of the final words of those\nsentences that's low working memory span\nwe're dividing it in two we divided you\ninto two groups and we do know when this\nhas been done in large numbers of human\nsubjects and some in some cases all of\nthose subjects have their brains imaged\nfor the amount of dopamine available for\nrelease in their prefrontal cortex that\nshort workking memory span correlates\nwith lower amounts of dopamine whereas\nhigher working memory span or longer\nworking memory span whatever you want to\ncall it correlates with more dopamine\navailable for release in the prefrontal\ncortex now this is where things get\nreally interesting and frankly really\nexciting for everybody especially the\nfolks in the low working memory span\ngroup work from martus bazito and\ncolleagues at UC Berkeley as well as\nother Laboratories have explored the\nconsequences of increasing dopamine\nlevels in the brain of typical\npopulations of individuals so these are\nnot people with Parkinson's or TBI but\nundergraduate students which we do\nrealize is not completely representative\nof the quote unquote normal population\noutside the university but also people\nfrom the community so people who are not\nUniversity students and so on and the\nways that they've increased dopamine in\nthose individuals had tended to rely on\npharmacology so these are prescription\ndrugs that most often have been\ndeveloped for theat treat M of\nParkinson's in order to increase\ndopamine levels but for some other\npurposes as well drugs like\nbromocryptine which we know are\nso-called dopamine agonis and agonis is\na drug that has the consequence of\nincreasing the amount of a given\nneurochemical in this case dopamine\nwhereas an antagonist is a drug that\neither blocks or prevents or somehow\nlowers the total available amount of a\ncertain chemical such as dopamine or\nserotonin Etc so bromocryptine is a drug\nthat increases dopamine so when human\nsubjects came into a laboratory didn't\ntake any drug no bromocryptine yet and\nof course they were being evaluated for\nwhether or not they were taking any meds\nfor ADHD their caffeine consumption Etc\nthere were certain rule-in and Rule outs\nfor that study but certainly people that\nwere taking any kind of prescription\nmedication for ADHD were not included in\nthe study or were eliminated from the\nstudy because those drugs can indeed\nincrease dopamine as well as some other\nneuromodulators such as norepinephrine\nand epinephrine I covered all that in\ntwo ADHD episodes that I did which again\nyou can find at hubman lab.com just go\nto the search function put in ADHD in\nany event in these studies they took\npeople that had not taken any drugs to\nincrease\ndopamine had their working memory\nmeasured very similarly to the way that\nyou measured your working memory a few\nminutes ago with the six sentence\nbusiness that we did and then they took\nbromocryptine and they either took a low\na moderate or high dose of bromocryptine\nand 90 minutes later they took a working\nmemory task and what was observed was\nvery interesting you can probably\npredict what it is based on everything\nI've set up until now individuals that\ninitially had low Baseline levels of\ndopamine and therefore shorter working\nmemory span so they only remembered zero\nto about three of the final words of\nthat six sentence\nseries their performance significantly\nimproved they were able to remember four\nand in some cases up to six the final\nwords of those sentences now that is in\ncomplete agreement with everything we\nset up until now simply says that\ndopamine is important for working memory\nif you start off with lower dopamine\nstores or dopamine availability for\nreleasing the prefrontal cortex lower\nworking memory performance increase\ndopamine through ingestion of\nbromocryptine which is this dopamine\nAgonist all of the circuit changes that\nwe want and would expect to improve\nworking memory occur and indeed working\nmemory improves okay very\nstraightforward\nthat's interesting but the even more\ninteresting part of the study is that\nindividuals that already had high\nworking memory span when they took\nbromocryptine at a low or a moderate\ndose their working memory did not\nincrease further now if somebody was\nalready getting six of the final words\nof those six sentences well then of\ncourse they couldn't improve their\nperformance anymore but many of the\npeople in the high working memory span\ngroup of course only remembered four in\nsome cases three typically it'll be four\nfive or six of the final words of those\nsentences when they took bromocryptine\nat low or moderate doses their working\nmemory did not improve significantly\nthere was either no change or a very\nmodest change and here's where things\nget really interesting when individuals\nwho already had a high working memory\nspan took the highest dose of\nbromocryptine and by the way studies\nverified that the amount of dopamine\navailable indeed increased so that was\nimportant to do and they did that well\ntheir working memory performance\nactually\ndecreased such that now they had a short\nor a low working memory span so what\nthis tells us is that the relationship\nbetween dopamine and working memory\nfollows an inverted u-shaped function so\nimagine a u and then just flip it over\nmeaning if you have low dopamine\navailability in the prefrontal cortex\nworking memory span is short as you\nincrease that amount working memory\nbecomes greater but if you increase the\namount of dopamine in the prefrontal\ncortex too much working memory span\nactually drops significantly below the\nBaseline that you started with now this\nis important for a number of reasons not\nthe least of which is the known\nrelationship between working memory and\nattention now this is very important to\nunderstand in the context of ADHD but\nalso for people who don't have ADHD and\nare struggling to maintain focus and\nattention and carry out working memory\ntasks throughout their normal everyday\nlife not in the laboratory but just\nmoving through life because these days\nwe hear a lot a lot a lot about people\nstruggling with focus and attention\nperhaps we don't know perhaps in part\ndue to overuse of smartphone social\nmedia Etc although there's not yet a\ndirect causal relationship that's been\nestablished the data that are emerging\nsuggests that indeed overuse of those\nthings can cause problems but regardless\nof the source there does seem to be more\nADHD both in kids and in adults and\nsubclinical challenges in focus and\nattention and here's where things get\nreally interesting as it relates to the\nneural circuitry work from desposito and\ncolleagues and other Laboratories as\nwell have shown using the similar\nParadigm that I described before giving\npeople drugs to increase their Baseline\nlevels of dopamine above their initial\nstarting point of short or long-term\nmemory span capacity and then had people\ncan perform different types of working\nmemory tasks that tap into two different\naspects of attention in working memory\nup until now we've been talking about\nworking memory it's kind of just one\nthing but working memory actually\ninvolves two things or at least two\nthings the first is that in order to\ncarry out a working memory task into to\nattend to something to really focus we\nneed the ability to rule out distractors\nwe need to be able to not pay attention\nto things that would otherwise distract\nUs in addition to that we need to be\nable to switch from one context to the\nnext right making the cup of coffee to\nputting on one shoes and heading out the\ndoor and in some cases layering\ndifferent contexts together talking on\nthe phone while tying one shoes and so\non and so forth what this work shows us\nis that the ability to task switch and\ncontext switch that is to shift around\nwhat it is that we're paying attention\nto and interleave different things that\nwe're paying attention to something\nthat's so critical for moving through\nour daily lives is largely dependent on\nthe dopamine projections to a structure\nin the brain called the basil ganglia\nwhich is a structure I've talked about\nbefore on this podcast but if you didn't\nhear about it we can just broadly Define\nthis structure as being involved in\nmovement generation and stopping\nmovement generation in fact it's often\ndiscussed as the neural circuitry that\ngenerates go as in do commands and noo\ndon't do commands so the basil ganglia\nare involved in task switching and they\ninvolved in task switching in part by\nsending certain commands to go do\ncertain things and no go to not do other\nthings okay task switching stop doing\nthis start doing that start doing that\nstop doing this and sometimes to varying\nextents right I mean we could take any\nreal world scenario of tying one shoes\nwhile talking on the phone and we could\nmicro analyze it in the context of this\nbut I think uh if you think about it\njust a little bit you understand that in\norder to perform daily task we need to\nbe able to task switch and that's not\nalways a start one task end start a new\ntask end often times we're interleaving\ndifferent tasks to varying degrees now\nthe other aspect of working memory and\nattention is to eliminate distractions\nto not pay attention to the irrelevant\nstuff in one's environment or even the\nirrelevant stuff on your own body like\nyou can't get distracted by you know a\nbutton that you know might be only\npartially buttoned or maybe some little\nsomething on your sleeve if you're\ntrying to do something else at that\nmoment okay and people with ADHD and\npeople who have subclin clinical\nchallenges and focus really have a hard\ntime with this right you know the the\nsort of stereotype is you know the oh\nlook a squirrel that whole thing but\nreally this typically exists as a more\nsubtle and challenging phenomenon for\npeople where they either can't remember\nwhat they were doing or they're simply\ndrawn down different trajectories\ndifferent thought trajectories or action\ntrajectories and then they have a hard\ntime making it back to the original\nthing that they were trying to focus on\nand we know based on these studies of\ndopamine and neuroimaging that\neliminating distractors is largely the\nconsequence of dopamine neurons\nprojecting to the prefrontal cortex okay\nnow why am I telling you all this neural\ncircuitry stuff well yes there are a\nbunch of studies showing that if you\nselectively activate the neurons that\nsend dopamine into the basil ganglia you\nimprove Tas switching ability without an\nimproved ability to rule out distractors\nor if you selectively increase the\namount of dopamine from neurons\nprojecting the prefrontal cortex that\nyou're able to selectively improve the\nelimination of dist tractors without\nimproving task switching ability for\npractical purposes in this discussion we\nwant to pay careful attention to whether\nor not the data tell us that those\nparticular protocols those particular\napproaches are globally increasing\ndopamine that is increasing the activity\nof dopamine neurons projecting to the\nbasil ganglia and the prefrontal cortex\nor selectively to the basil ganglia or\nselectively to the prefrontal cortex and\nwhat I can tell you now is that\nfortunately there are several prot some\nof which are behavioral some of which\ninvolve specific over-the-counter\nsupplements and some of which involve\nprescription pharmacology that can tap\ninto each of these systems independently\nas well as globally increased dopamine\nto improve focus and working memory at\nlarge I'd like to take a quick break to\nacknowledge our sponsor element element\nis an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you\ndon't that means zero sugar and the\nappropriate ratios of the electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium and that\ncorrect ratio of electrolytes is\nextremely important because every cell\nin your body but especially your nerve\ncells your neurons relies on\nelectrolytes in order to function\nproperly so when you're well hydrated\nand you have the appropriate amount of\nelectrolytes in your system your mental\nfunctioning and your physical\nfunctioning is improved I drink one\npacket of element dissolved in about 16\nto 32 ounces of water when I wake up in\nthe morning as well as while I exercise\nand if I've sweat a lot during that\nexercise I often will drink a third\nelement packet dissolved in about 32\nounces of water after I exercise element\ncomes in a variety of different flavors\nall of which I find really tasty I like\nthe Citrus I like the watermelon I like\nthe raspberry frankly I can't pick just\none it also comes in chocolate and\nchocolate mint which I find tastes best\nif they are put into water dissolved and\nthen heated up I tend to do that in the\nwinter months because of course you\ndon't just need hydration on hot days\nand in the summer and spring months but\nalso in the winter when the temperatures\nare cold and the environment tends to be\ndry if if you'd like to try element you\ncan go to drink element spelled lm.com\nhuberman to try a free sample pack again\nthat's drink element.com\nhuberman okay so let's talk about\nprotocols to improve working memory\nspecifically by way of changing levels\nof dopamine in the brain now I've\ndiscussed dopamine many times before in\nthis podcast in fact we have entire\nepisodes devoted to optimizing and\nregulating dopamine and of course\ndopamine comes up within the context of\nthe ADHD episodes and episodes as well\nand again if you have specific questions\nabout dopamine or any other topic for\nthat matter if you go to huberman\nlab.com that website has been engineered\nso that you can put one word such as\ndopamine but also multiple keywords so\nperhaps dopamine exercise or dopamine\ncold plunge Etc into the search function\nand it will take you to the specific\ntimestamps of multiple episodes where\nthose topics were discussed as well as\nnewsletters where some of that\ninformation has been condensed into\nshort PDF form Etc so we certainly are\ngoing going to cover some material about\nimproving dopamine for sake of improving\nworking memory now but if you're\ngenerally interested in the science and\npharmacology of dopamine and protocols\nto modulate dopamine levels all of that\ncan be found at huberman lab.com okay so\nlet's say you have a short working\nmemory span or a moderate working memory\nspan and you want to experiment with\nincreasing levels of dopamine for sake\nof improving working memory now there\nare a lot of different ways that one\ncould imagine doing that let's start\nwith the behavioral tools known to\nincrease dopamine stores that is shown\nin peer-reviewed studies to increase\ndopamine stores within certain circuits\nof the brain that are relevant for\nworking memory performance and the\nprotocol that immediately leaps to mind\nis the use of certain non-sleep deep\nrest protocols now non-sleep deep rest\nor nsdr is actually a term that I coined\nbecause there is a practice that's been\nestablished for many hundreds of years\ncalled Yoga Nidra which actually means\nyoga sleep whereby individuals\npotentially you if you decide to do them\nlie down listen to to a script that is\nlisten to an audio script which\ngenerally instructs you to do long\nexhale breathing to deliberately relax\nyour musculature of your face and of\nyour body and Yoga Nidra typically also\ninvolves doing certain intentions and\nthe instruction always given at the\nbeginning of Yoga Nidra is that you\nshould try to not fall asleep now some\npeople sometimes fall asleep some people\ndon't fall asleep but the idea and there\nare data to support that Yoga Nidra puts\npeople into kind of a shallow pattern of\nsleep um certainly not deep sleep s and\nnot rapid eye movement sleep but it's a\nvery interesting and unusual brain state\nfor which we're starting to understand\nmore and actually I have some plans in\nthe not too distant future to\ncollaborate with Matthew Walker the\nauthor of the book why we sleep and some\nother colleagues to try and figure out\nwhat exact patterns of neural activity\nare taking place in the brain and rest\nof nervous system during Yoga Nidra and\nthis similar protocol which I call\nnonsleep deep rest the difference\nbetween Yoga Nidra and non-sleep deep\nrest is that nonsleep deep rest doesn't\ninclude any of the intentions and\nremoves a lot of the kind of opaque or\nsometimes called mystical language from\nthe protocol now a great thing is that\nyoga needra scripts or protocols as well\nas nsdr scripts or Protocols are\navailable totally zero cost you can find\nthem certainly on apps like waking up\nbut also on YouTube for instance if you\nput nsdr and my last name there's a\n10-minute nsdr script there there are a\nlot of yoga NRA scripts if you prefer a\nfemale voice there are a lot of\ndifferent excellent female voices out\nthere one in particular particular that\nI like very much is Kelly boy first name\nKelly last name b y s she has both yoga\nNRA and ndr scripts of various durations\nof anywhere from 8 minutes all the way\nout to I believe 45 minutes why am I\ntelling you all this well there have\nbeen several studies but in particular\none and I do realize we're talking about\nonly one study but the results are\nreally intriguing as it relates to what\nwe're talking about today in this study\nthey had individuals do effectively an\nnsdr protocol they call it yoganidra and\nthe protocol they used was essentially a\nyoga Nedra script they had people lie\ndown and listen to a yoga Nedra script\nand to perform yoga Nedra and they\nevaluated the amount of dopamine\navailable within the brain both prior to\nand after performing this yoga NRA\nscript and what they discovered was that\nafter performing a Yoga Nidra protocol\nthe Baseline levels of dopamine that is\nthe amount of dopamine available in the\nbasil ganglia and a few other structures\nof the human brain of course these are\nhumans was increased by as much as\n60% as compared to individuals that did\na different protocol not yoganidra not\nnsdr now did that study evaluate lots of\ndifferent durations of yoga Nedra AKA\nnstr no they looked at fairly long hour\nplus Yoga Nidra sessions however there's\nsome other data that have explored Yoga\nNidra AKA\nnstr in the context of cognitive\nperformance and a few other\ncircumstances all of which point to the\nfact that cognitive performance and in\nparticular cognitive performance tasks\nthat have a working memory element to\nthem so they weren't the exact working\nmemory task that you did earlier but\nthey have a working memory element to\nthem that is subjects had to keep\ncertain small batches of information in\nmind and then discard that information\nin order to be able to perform the task\nwell all of those show significant\nimprovements in task performance so\nwhile something like nsdr or Yoga Nidra\nmight sound kind of mystical or kind of\nyou know wishy-washy or I guess as the\nkids say weak sauce uh to some of you it\nis anything but weak sauce it is really\npowerful stuff and it's powerful stuff\nas it relates to the very neurochemicals\nand neuros circuits that are involved in\nworking memory so if I were to take a\nstep back and just say okay what are\nsome zeroc cost very low if any risk\nprotocols that one could perform in\norder to improve dopamine levels without\nhaving to ingest anything take anything\nand really do much of anything at all\nexcept lie there do this progressive\nmuscle relaxation there are a few other\nthings involved in nsdr as well which\nyou'll learn if you decide to try them\nand improve or increase the levels of\ndopamine availability in the brain\nsignificantly well then nsdr and Yoga\nNidra really are the first line tools if\none wants to do that I think it's\nreasonable to say that and as I\nmentioned before there's no reason to\nthink that there's any risk of doing\nnstr yoga NRA you know provide that\nyou're lying down in a safe place as\nopposed to like in the middle of the\nroad or something but assuming you do it\nin a safe location I would encourage you\nto try it for really for 20 to 30\nminutes when you first explore it\nperhaps you do longer although I\npersonally have a hard time doing long\nyoga needer scripts regularly a full\nhour is a big commitment I don't\ngenerally have that much time I often\nwill do a 10-minute nsdr have there been\nbrain Imaging experiments done for each\nand all of these yoga needra scripts to\ndetermine the amount or if there's any\ndopamine increase within the brain no\nbut I think that we can safely\nextrapolate from that wonderful study\nout of Scandinavia that showed that when\nhuman subjects do this yoga NRA protocol\nthat there's a significant increase in\nBaseline dopamine levels within key\nneural structures that relate to working\nmemory now many of you have perhaps\nheard that getting in a cold plunge or\ntaking a cold shower or provided you can\ndo it safely getting into a cold ocean\nor a cold lake can significantly maybe\neven double or even triple your\ncirculating dopamine levels and indeed\nthat is true it has been shown that when\npeople get into cold water typically up\nto their neck and that cold water by the\nway can range in temperature anywhere\nfrom low 40s to low 60s depending on how\nlong you stay in that there is a\nsignificant increase in the so-called\ncirculating catac colomines what are the\ncatac colomines the catamin are dopamine\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine now the\nevidence for the catac colomine increase\nin response to cold water mainly stems\nfrom two studies and in particular one\nand in that particular study they had\npeople get into I wouldn't say super\ncold water it was in the low 60° and by\nthe way I'm speaking in Fahrenheit here\nand they had those human subjects\nsubmerged in water up to their neck I\nthink they actually had them sitting in\nlawn chairs on the bottom of a pool uh\nbut again their heads were above water\nso they could breathe and they stayed in\nfor quite a long while you know 45\nminutes or longer and it was observed\nthat there was a big big statistically\nsignificant increase in epinephrine\nnorepinephrine in dopamine that lasted\nseveral hours or more this is one of the\nreasons why if you've ever done\ndeliberate cold exposure as it's called\nit often is uncomfortable when you get\nin but then when you get out you feel\ndifferent you feel really good in most\ncases provided if you're me you take a\nwarm shower afterwards yes I like to do\nthat I realize if you want to increase\nyour metabolism perhaps it's better to\nnot warm up afterwards I like a nice\nwarm shower or to get in the sauna\nafterwards that's just me but\nnonetheless deliberate cold exposure\nclearly induces a state shift of mind\nand body that most people provided they\ndo it correctly and they don't go into\nwater that's far too cold for them for\ntoo long they report as pleasant and I\nthink it's reasonable to assume that\nsome of that is the consequence of these\nincreases in catac colomines which is\nwhy many people opt for a cold shower\nwhich if you're me cold shower followed\nby a warmer or hot shower or a cold\nPlunge in the morning or maybe even just\nonce or twice a week many people like\nthem typically people like getting out\nof them and the feeling that they have\nafter they do them although some of you\nsickos really like the feeling of\ngetting in and being it but not me the\npoint here is that if we were to take a\nlook at the landscape of zeroc cost\nbehavioral Tools in fact behavioral\ntools that could potentially save you\nmoney meaning reduce your heating bill\nthat are known to increase the very\nneurochemicals AKA dopamine that are\ninvolved and improving working memory I\nthink it's reasonable to assume that a\ncold shower about 30 to 60 minutes prior\nto doing any kind of working memory task\nor any kind of activity that would\nrequire increased Focus could be okay we\ndon't know this specific Studies have\nnot been done but could be in theory it\nmakes sense mechanistically it's\nlogically\nsound could be done after deliberate\ncold exposure and indeed many people\nreport not just feeling a bit of you\nknow mild Euphoria or feeling good after\ndeliberate cold exposure but also an\nincreased capacity to focus in fact so\nmuch so that a lot of people who do\ndeliberate cold exposure say that they\ndon't require as much caffeine in order\nto maintain their alertness and energy\nwhich shouldn't be surprising to us at\nall right I mean it's increasing cacola\nmeans we know this so that's another\nprotocol that you could explore as well\nis there an important difference or not\nbetween deliberate cold exposure done by\ncold shower or deliberate cold exposure\nin a cold plunge or the ocean frankly\nthere haven't been a lot of studies\ncomparing those but I think it stands to\nreason that if you have access to a cold\nplunge or a cold body of water that you\ncan safely get into up to your neck for\n30 seconds to a minute if it's 50° or\nless right if you get in colder water we\nknow for instance if you get into say 45\nDee water and you only get in for 30\nseconds you're going to get a big\nincrease in the catacol amines perhaps\nas big as the catacol amine increase\nthat you would get from being in 60°\nwater for 45 minutes most people don't\nhave 45 minutes to sit around in water\nup to their neck so most people opt for\n30 seconds to as much as 3 minutes\ndeliberate cold exposure in a shower or\ncold plunge or other body of water again\nonly do this if you can do it safely\nnever ever please for the love of God\nplease never ever do any kind of\nhyperventilation breathing or breath\nholding while doing deliberate cold\nexposure because you can pass out you\ncan die don't combine breath work and\ndeliberate cold exposure just don't\nseparate those two things completely\nokay but deliberate coal exposure we\nknow is a very reliable way to increase\nthe catacol amines which includes\ndopamine so if you want to explore\ndeliberate cold exposure protocols get\ninto the Nuance of temperature and\nduration Etc you can find that\ncompletely zero cost go to hubman\nlab.com go to the menu tab scroll down\nto newsletter and go to the cold\nexposure news letter where it details\nall of that in short PDF form now some\nof you are probably asking hey what if I\nwas in the high or long working memory\nspan group I ought to have high Baseline\nlevels of dopamine should I not do Yoga\nNidra or nsdr should I not do deliberate\ncold exposure well there you're just\ngoing to have to experiment again\nthere's essentially zero risk to doing\nyoganidra nsdr as I mentioned before\ndeliberate cold exposure there's always\nsome risk getting into water cold water\npeople always want to know how cold well\nthe newsletter gets to this but I'll\njust tell you right now as well the\nideal temperature is the temperature\nthat you can safely get into and stay in\nfor a duration of 30 seconds to 3\nminutes before getting out some people\nop to go longer but I think 30 seconds\nto 3 minutes is a good duration to work\nwith for most people especially if\nyou're going to do it frequently so the\ntemperature should be safe for you to\nstay in for that duration but\nuncomfortable enough that there's some\nimpulse to want to get out that you have\nto of work to stay in there that you\nhave to kind of overcome that adrenaline\nrelease and the impulse to get out okay\nso for some people that's going to be\n45° for some people be 40° depends on\nhow cold adapted you are depends on how\nrested you are there is no specific\ntemperature you have to really gauge for\nyourself and so airor on the side of\ncaution and you can experiment provided\nyou experiment within the margins of\nsafety so if you found during the\nworking memory task that you took today\nthat you have a very good working memory\nI don't think there's any reason to\navoid yoganidra nsdr and deliberate cold\nexposure in fact there may be reasons to\nincrease your dopamine and other catacol\namines by way of nsdr Yoga Nidra\ndeliberate cold exposure perhaps for\nworking memory performance maybe it\ncould increase\nfurther perhaps it would decrease\nperformance in which case there you got\nyour answer you don't have to do those\nprotocols again and you certainly\nwouldn't want to do them before anything\nthat involves a lot of working memory\nand attention but of course those\nprotocols have other benefits as well so\nthere's no reason to avoid them entirely\njust perhaps avoid them within the\ncontext of trying to improve working\nmemory however if you're somebody that\nhas challenges with working memory\nchallenges with attention challenges\nwith Focus well then I think that the\nprotocols I've been talking about up\nuntil now would be an excellent first\nforay into the sorts of things that you\ncould do to increase dopamine and of\ncourse those other catacol amines as a\nway to see whether or not it augments\nyour focus and attention and working\nmemory capacity now some of you are\nprobably shouting shouting shouting what\nabout exercise does an exercise increase\ndopamine it does yes there are other\nthings that increase dopamine it's not\njust exercise there are activities that\nincrease dopamine some people are saying\nwait doesn't playing video games\nincrease dopamine sex increases dopamine\nchocolate increases dopamine yes yes\nindeed those things can increase\ndopamine what's interesting and\nimportant about the protocols I've been\ntalking about however nsdr yoga Nedra\ndeliberate cold exposure is not just\nthat they increase dopamine but the\nduration over which they increase\ndopamine okay this is very important if\nyou want to understand more about the\nrelationship between dopamine spikes as\nthey're called and dopamine Baseline and\nwhy I'm emphasizing these tools that\ncause large longlasting increases in\nBaseline dopamine check out the episodes\nI did on optimizing dopamine we've got a\nlink to them in the show note captions\nnow before I talk about other ways to\nincrease dopamine for sake of improving\nworking memory things like\nover-the-counter supplements like El\ntyrosine makuna pururin things like that\nI do briefly want to mention and I\npromise briefly I know sometimes I say\nbriefly and then I spend 20 minutes\ntelling you about something but very\nbriefly I just want to spend two minutes\ntelling you about protocols that we do\nnot yet know whether or not they\nincrease dopamine levels but we do know\nthat they improve working memory because\nafter all this episode is about working\nmemory not just about dopamine in\nworking memory it has been shown that\nthe use of binaural beats okay binaural\nbeats being the presentation or the\nlistening to sounds of different\nfrequencies in the two ears typically by\nheadphones I think that's been shown to\nwork best and there's a subtraction\nbetween the two frequencies such that\nthe brain tends to entrain or start to\nfollow a particular frequency within not\nthe entire brain but certain neural\ncircuits so if you've heard of say 15\nHertz binaural beats or 40 Herz binural\nbeats that doesn't mean that you listen\nto a 15 Hertz sound or a 40 HZ sound you\nlisten to two different frequencies of\nsound right Hertz is just a measurement\nof sound frequency in each of the two\nears and then the difference between\nthem is 40 Herz or 15 Hertz and there\nare several studies that show not\nenormous okay I want to be clear small\nto moderate improvements in working\nmemory performance but in some cases\nsignificant Improvement and I'll provide\na link to these two papers in the show\nnote captions but I'll just briefly\ndescribe them by way of their title and\ntheir major conclusions the first is a\nstudy entitled the effects of binaural\nand monoral beat stimulation on\ncognitive functioning in subjects with\ndifferent levels of emotionality a\nreally interesting study published in\n2019 it was a relatively small number of\nsubjects only 24 participants 16 males\neight males between 19 and 31 years old\nlisten to these 40 Herz binaural beats\nand by the way it's very easy easy to\nfind apps and other sources of 40 HZ\nbinaural beats at zero cost or nominal\ncost out there um you would simply look\nfor 40 HZ binormal beats and looked at\nperformance on working memory tasks as\nwell as some other cognitive tasks and\nfound in some cases a small to moderate\nbut significant Improvement in cognitive\nperformance on working memory tasks the\naspect of the study looking at\nemotionality did not find a significant\neffect so it doesn't seem that\nemotionality uh impacts things there but\nnonetheless that study plus the other\none entitled the effect of binaural\nbeats on visual spatial working memory\nand cortical connectivity this was a\nstudy published in\n2016 found generally something similar\nin this case they were using 15 Herz\nbinaural beats and here I'm I'm\nparaphrasing produced network activity\ncharacteristic of high information\ntransfer with consistent connection\nstrengths what they're really talking\nabout is changes in neural activity\npatterns within the brain that led to or\nat least were correlated with with\nimprovements on visual spatial working\nmemory visual spatial working memory\ntasks are different than the working\nmemory tasks that you performed earlier\nvisual spatial working memory tasks\ninvolve the cognitive generation that is\nwithin your head of the so-called Visos\nspatial sketch pad so it's this idea\nthat you see something and then you got\nof sketch it out in your mind you have\nto know the relationships between things\nin space pay attention to what they are\nkeep those in mind again because it's\nworking memory just as long as it's\nnecessary to perform a task that's what\nviso spatial working memory is as you\ncan imagine it translates to an enormous\nnumber of everyday activities required\nfor focus and attention and learning and\nperformance and indeed 15 Herz binaural\nbeats was able to produce a small but\nsignificant Improvement in that sort of\nworking memory task so I want to\nemphasize again we don't know the\nrelationship between binaural beats and\ndopamine at least not from these studies\nbut I felt I'd be remiss if I didn't\nmention these two studies that show that\n40 Herz binaural beats 15 Herz binaural\nbeats can indeed improve working memory\nperformance and in these sorts of\nscenarios individuals are listening to\nthe binaural beats while they are doing\nthe working memory task and in some\ncases before they are doing the working\nmemory task either seems to work it\ndepends on the study there a bunch of\nother studies but I thought I'd mention\nbinaural beats because I know a number\nof people are interested in them again\nnon-pharmacologic zero cost because you\ncan find tools for bormal Beat\nGeneration zero cost out there\napproaches to improving working memory\nokay what about over-the-counter\ncompounds that are known to increase\ncirculating dopamine that can\npotentially improve working memory and\nthat indeed have been shown in\npeer-reviewed studies to improve working\nmemory by way of increasing circulating\npresumably brain levels of dopamine well\nI can think of two specific categories\nof supplements that is over-the-counter\ncompounds that at least at this point in\ntime are legal in the United States that\ncan increase dopamine levels those two\nare El tyrosine which is an amino acid\nprecursor to dopamine and Muna purines\nwhich is a believe it or not it's the uh\na velvety Bean or the outer component of\nthis velvety Bean that contains or is\nequivalent to\n99% lopa L Doopa is a key component in\nthe biochemical Cascade leading to the\nproduction of dopamine in fact lopa is\noften prescribed for Parkinson patients\nas a means to increase their dopamine\nlevels there are at least three studies\nthat I am aware of of the use of Muna\npurines to increase dopamine for the\ntreatment of Parkinson's in other words\nMuna purines increases dopamine levels\nand yes it has been shown to improve\nsome of those symptoms of Parkinson's\npatients we're not talking about\ntreatment of Parkinson's today I want to\ncaution people against any sort of use\nof supplements to treat Parkinson's or\nother conditions without consulting your\ndoctor all right that's very very\ncritical to point out if we're talking\nabout ways to increase dopamine for sake\nof improving working memory by way of\nsupplementation I think we should start\nwith El tyos because El tyrosine unlike\nMuna Pines is a bit further up actually\nit's way further up the biochemical\nCascade leading to dopamine production\nhowever it has been shown in several\nstudies that El tyrosine supplementation\ncan indeed increase dopamine and\nmoreover and here I'm quoting the title\nof a study published in 1999 which I\nrealized is a few years back but of\ncourse there's some excellent studies\nfrom a few years back or more tyrosine\nimproves working memory in a\nmultitasking environment now this\nparticular study from Thomas at all has\nsome interesting aspects and some\naspects that made me go a little bit\nwide-eyed but not necessarily wide-eyed\nbecause the results are so dramatic in\nfact when one looks at all of the data\nin this paper what you find is that\nsupplementing with El tyrosine as they\ndid in this study did indeed lead to\nimprovements in working memory under\nmultitask conditions as the title\nsuggests those improvements were\nsignificant but they weren't enormous\nokay they were statistically significant\nbut they were not enormous increases now\nwhat was enormous and the reason I got\nwide-eyed and still get wide-eyed is\nthat the dosages of of tyrosine used in\nthe study are really big they had\nsubjects take 150 milligrams per\nkilogram of el crystalline tyrosine I\nhad them take it in applesauce for\nwhatever reason or Placebo and they did\na number of different control conditions\nto make sure that whatever effects of el\ntyrosine they observed were in fact due\nto El tyrosine supplementation why am I\ngoing wide-eyed When I See This 150\nmilligrams per Kil\nof tyrosine well I weigh 220 lb that's\nabout 100 kg so if I weigh 100 kilg and\nit's 150 milligram for every kilogram\nthat means that if I were a subject in\nthe study that they would give me 15,000\nmilligram that is 15 gram of el tyrosine\nprior to doing these cognitive tasks now\n15 grams of tyrosine to me seems like a\nvery very high dose and I frankly can't\nin good conscience recommend that why\nwell maybe I'm just hypers sensitive to\nEl tyroine but I've taken 1,000 or500\nmilligrams of el tyrosine and I've\ndefinitely experienced an increase in\nalertness from taking 1.5 gram not 15\n1.5 grams of el tyrosine and in fact at\na subjective level I can feel a\nmeaningful increase in alertness and\nfocus from 500 milligrams of el tyrosine\nso I can't in good conscience suest that\npeople replicate the exact do protocols\nwithin the study nonetheless the study\nas the title suggests shows that\nsupplementing with El tyrosine can\nindeed increase working memory capacity\nespecially in a multitasking environment\nwhich in many ways carries over to the\nsorts of requirements for working memory\nand attention capacity to get through\nlife in a very focused for lack of a\nbetter word way in a very regimented do\nthis do that task switch multiple things\ninter Lea that's what moving through\none's day or at least work day or\nanything that requires cognition and\nfocus entails so first of all I'll just\nsay what I always say when discussing\nany kind of compound or prescription\ndrug never add or remove any supplement\nfrom your supplement regimen if you have\none without consulting with your health\nprovider first to make sure that you are\nsafe to take that particular supplement\nnow many Physicians MDS are not familiar\nwith most supplements so you'll probably\nneed to bring some literature um to the\nphone call or to the visit but of course\nthere are many Healthcare Providers\nincluding some MDS that are open to\nsupplementation especially these days um\nas supplements have become uh I would\nsay generally more accepted I mean there\nare certain ones like vitamin D3 that\nand fish oils and things like that that\nare more common than El tyrosine but\nthere are many Physicians who are open\nto discussions about supplements such as\nEl tyrosine if you know that you can\nsupplement with El tyrosine safely and\nyou opt to do so what dosages would you\npotentially take well here we have to\nlook at the dosages used in these\nstudies I think it's only fair it's only\nsafe that we acknowledge that these dose\njust are really really high and I think\nthe logical the safe thing to do would\nbe to start with the minimal effective\ndose so if you weigh 50\nkilograms rather than start right off\nwith you know the equivalent dosage to\nthis study maybe you start with 250\nmilligrams of el tyrosine if you weigh a\nbit more like me or 100 kgrs or 75 kilg\nmaybe you take 500 milligrams of el\ntyrosine and see whether or not you\nexperience a significant effect on\nworking memory attention and performance\nso the idea here is to establish the\nminimal effective dose I should also\npoint out that some people not all but\nsome people experience a bit of a crash\nafter El tyrosine supplementation such\nthat they feel more alert more focused\nbetter ability to perform working memory\ntasks move about their day but then\nthree or four hours later experience\nkind of a drop so you need to be mindful\nof that in fact you need to be mindful\nof any kind of pharmacology where you're\nincreasing dopamine this is one of the\nreasons why I like the behavioral\nprotocols that we talked about earlier\nbecause they're known to create big but\nlong lasting and slowly tapering off\nincreases in dopamine and other catacol\namines now for those who are curious\nabout and perhaps even want to try Muna\npurines please absolutely talk to your\ndoctor first Muna perin is essentially\nthe equivalent of lopa lopa is a\nprescription drug as I mentioned before\nand Muna perin potently increases\ndopamine what dosages of Muna Pines can\nincrease dopamine well typically in\nstudies of Parkinson's patients but also\nstudies exploring typical people who\ndon't have Parkinson's in tasks or in\nsports performance have explored\nanywhere from 1 to 5 gr of Muna purins\nMuna purin again is a very potent way to\nincrease dopamine and here if your\nhealthc care provider approves it and\nyou decide to try it I would suggest\nstarting with a very very low dose again\nto to find the minimal effective dose so\nmaybe even just 500 milligrams not even\ngoing to the one gram dose maybe even\n250 milligrams and really evaluating how\nmuch Muna pance can produce a meaningful\nimpact on working memory and attention\nfor you so Muna pan is kind of a bridge\nbetween over-the-counter supplements and\nprescription drugs I say it's a bridge\nbecause it is Oho similar to that\nprescription drug L Doopa and of course\nthere is a long list of prescription\ndrugs that are known to be dopamine\nAgonist several of which many of which\nin fact have been shown to improve\nworking memory you already learned about\none of those before which is\nbromocryptine now you need a\nprescription from a physician to get\nbromocryptine but bromocryptine we know\nbased on that work from desposito\ncolleagues that I talked about earlier\nincreases dopamine it does so in about\n90 minutes it achieves Peak levels of\ndopamine about 90 minutes and improves\nworking memory in individuals that start\noff with a low working memory span and\nwe know from neuroimaging those are the\nindividuals with lower Baseline levels\nof dopamine so should you run out and\nask your doctor for bromocryptine maybe\nmost doctors won't prescribe\nbromocryptine for that reason I should\nmention that work from desposito lab and\nother Laboratories has shown that one of\nthe Hallmark features of traumatic brain\ninjury especially frontal lobe injury as\nwell as certain neurod degenerative\nconditions like Parkinson's but other\nforms of dementia as well as ADHD\ninvolve deficits in working memory and\nattention which makes sense given what\nwe know about the symptoms of those\nconditions and that bromocryptine has\nbeen prescribed off Lael for the\ntreatment of those conditions to some\ndegree of success however those are off\nLael circumstances right now as far as I\nknow bromocryptine is not prescribed\nspecifically for those conditions at a\nkind of whole population level it's not\none of the drugs on the lookup table for\nADHD or TBI but certain well-informed\nneurologists and Physicians do prescribe\nit for that reason there are other\ndopamine agonists that are relevant in\nthis context the ones that I think most\nof you will be familiar with are the\ndrugs that increase dopamine and\nnorepinephrine for the treatment of ADHD\nand I did an entire episode of The\nhubman Lab podcast about those compounds\nthings like adderal things like rellin\nwhich by by the way is quite different\nthan Aderall in terms of how much\ndopamine relative to norepinephrine it\ncauses the increase of I cover all that\nin those episodes again you can simply\ngo to hubman lab.com put ADHD Aderall or\nADHD riddlin and I talk about other\nthings as well I also took a little bit\nabout modafanil which is a entirely\ndifferent category of drug known to\nimprove cognitive performance in some\ncases in ADHD but in everybody so there\nare a lot of different drugs that can\nimprove working memory most of those do\nso by increasing transmission of\ndopamine or availability of dopamine\nsomehow changing dopamine levels in the\nbrain by increasing them so if you're\nsomebody that has challenges with\nworking memory focus and attention\nplease see those episodes and please\ntalk to your doctor about potentially\nusing pharmacology to increase dopamine\nhowever and this is very important many\npeople who have challenges with Focus\nattention and working memory and fall\nunder the category of subclinical levels\nof ADHD and even some individuals with\n88 she young and old manage their\nsymptoms and in some cases improve their\nfocus through the use of Behavioral\ntools nutritional tools supplement based\nTools in ways that either allow them to\nreduce their total prescription drug\ndosages and in some cases come off them\nentirely now I am definitely not saying\nthat people should come off those drugs\nentirely and in fact I want to take a\nreally firm stand here because I know\nthis is a bit controversial but I'm just\ngoing to tell you having evaluated the\nwhole literature several times over now\nI do think I personally believe that\nthere is a strong case for certain\nchildren and adults to take these\ncompounds that increase dopamine and\nepinephrine yes those compounds are\ndifferent forms of amphetamine but those\ncompounds we know can increase\nneuroplasticity the rewiring ltp LTD Etc\nwithin the neural circuits that control\nFocus attention and working memory and\nso they do have their place for certain\nindividuals we don't want to rule those\nout are they over prescribed my feeling\nis that yes they are probably\noverprescribed however there are a\nnumber of individuals that strongly\nbenefit from them as well so if you are\ngoing to explore the use of those\ncompounds for sake of improving working\nmemory certainly if you're going to\nexplore them for sake of improving\nworking memory and focus in young kids\nplease please please talk to your\nphysician because they're prescription\ndrugs you would need to talk to a\nphysician anyway but regardless of\nwhether or not you're trying to improve\nfocus and working memory in a child in\nan adult someone with TBI someone with\nParkinson's\nI think it stands to reason that you\nwould arrive to that conversation with\nsome knowledge of not just the\nprescription drugs that are potentially\navailable but also some of the\nsupplement based tools some of the\nbehavioral tools because as we know and\nas a good friend of mine who's an\nexcellent physician says Better Living\nThrough Chemistry still requires Better\nLiving meaning yes prescription drugs\ncan have a positive impact on these\naspects of brain function in a way that\ncan really improve lives but that\nbehavioral tools also work in fact they\ncan collaborate in a very synergistic\nway to increase the amount of\nneuroplasticity in the relevant circuits\nso I'm of the mind and I think more and\nmore people out there I like to think\nare of the mind that behaviors nutrition\nsupplement based tools and prescription\ndrugs all can have their place to\nvarying degrees depending on the\ncircumstances and the individual okay so\ntoday we talked about working memory\nthis incredible capacity of our brain in\nfact a specific set of brain circuits\ndesigned for us to absorb absorb\ninformation that is perceived in our\nenvironment use the relevant parts and\nthen Chuck it just get rid of it forget\nit so very different than short and\nlong-term memory which we also discussed\nand we talked about a few of the\nmechanisms as well I think you'll agree\nthat working memory is one of the more\nincredible aspects to brain function I\nmean if you think about this is a set of\nneural circuits that engage the same\nalgorithm over and over in different\ncontext in order for us to be able to\nnavigate new environments familiar\nenvironments to interleave different\nactivities these different strategies to\ntask switch to rule out distractors it's\noh so critical to every aspect of our\nWaking Life and fortunately there are\nalso zeroc cost and lowcost
