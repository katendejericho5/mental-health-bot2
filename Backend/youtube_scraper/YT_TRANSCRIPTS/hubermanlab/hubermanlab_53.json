    "transcript": "You have all these voices\nthat are telling you you're fucked up,\nand this is going to be hard.\nBut for some reason, you put\nso much practice into you\nthat you can ignore every one of 'em\nthat are telling you you're\nnot going to fucking make it\nand still be able to fucking make it\nbecause you have put the practice in\nthat you know this is the process.\nIt's such a daunting task that\nall the voices are saying no,\nbut you still had the conviction that,\n\"I know I can do this,\"\nand that's what it took\nfor me to get here.\nWhen you put that practice in,\nevery day you lace 'em up...\nAnd I don't mean run. It's\njust a metaphor for life.\nWhen you lace them\nmotherfuckers up every day,\npretty soon you win.\nYou have the courage and\nthe heart and the dedication\nand the mindset about everybody\ncan go fuck themselves.\nI know what I know.\nI've listened to myself enough\nto know I know what I know.\nNone of you can hear what I'm hearing.\nAnd that's what people don't do enough of.\nThey don't listen to their journey.\nThey listen to everybody else's shit.\nYou're not looking at the\ntruth in front of you.\nThe truth in front of you is it sucks.\nThis is what it takes,\ncreating another voice\nand sometimes going at it alone."
