    "video_title": "Dr. Robert Lustig: How Sugar & Processed Foods Impact Your Health",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Robert\nlustig Dr Robert lustig is an\nendocrinologist that is he's a\nspecialist in the function of hormones\nin the body and a professor of Pediatric\nEndocrinology at the University of\nCalifornia San Francisco he has authored\nmore than 100 peer-reviewed studies\nexploring how different types of\nnutrients that is food impact our\ncellular functioning our organ\nfunctioning and thereby our health\nduring today's discussion we discussed\nthe idea of whether or not a calorie is\nindeed a calorie and whether or not our\nbody weight and body composition only\nreflects the number of calories we eat\nversus the calories that we burn we talk\nabout how different food types that is\nhow the different macronutrients protein\nfat and carbohydrates are processed in\nthe body and the important role that\nfiber and the gut microbiome plays in\nthat process and we pay particular\nattention to the topic of how different\ntypes of sugars and fructose in\nparticular can indeed be addictive to\nthe brain and can modify the way that\nhormones in the body in particular\ninsulin impact our Liver Health Kidney\nHealth and indeed the health of all of\nour cells and organs indeed Dr lustig is\nan expert in how sugar impacts the brain\nand body we talk about how certain types\nof sugars can indeed be addictive in the\nsame way that certain drugs of abuse and\nbehaviors can become addictive so in\nother words how sugar actually changes\nthe way that the brain works and we\ndiscuss how the food industry that is\nthe commoditization and sale of\nparticular types of food has altered the\nway that we eat and indeed the foods\nthat We crave today's discussion covers\nall of that and by the end of today's\ndiscussion you'll have a thorough\nunderstanding of how foods are processed\nwhen they enter your body and how those\ndifferent food choices are impacting\nyour immediate and long-term Health\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is eight sleep eight\nsleep makes Smart mattress covers with\ncooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\nin this podcast about the fact that\nsleep is the foundation of Mental Health\nphysical health and performance now a\nkey component of getting a great night's\nsleep is that in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep your body temperature\nactually has to drop by about 1 to 3\ndegre and in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3Â° one of the best ways to\nmake sure that those temperature changes\noccur at the appropriate times at the\nbeginning and throughout and at the end\nof your night when you wake up is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's what eight sleep\nallows you to do it allows you to\nprogram the temperature of your mattress\nand sleeping environment such that you\nfall and stay deeply asleep easily and\nwake up each morning feeling incredibly\nrefreshed and energized I've been\nsleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress\ncover for almost 3 years now and it has\ndramatically improved the quality of my\nsleep so much so that when I travel and\nI'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't\nhave access to my eight sleep I very\nmuch look forward to getting home\nbecause my sleep is always better when I\nsleep on my eights Sleep mattress cover\nif you'd like to try eights sleep you\ncan go to 8sleep.com\n/ huberman to get $150 off their pod\nthree mattress cover eight sleep\ncurrently ships in the USA Canada UK\nselect countries in the EU and Australia\nagain that's 8sleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by levels levels is a program that\nlets you see how different foods affect\nyour health by giving you real-time\nfeedback on your diet using a continuous\nglucose monitor one of the most\nimportant factors in your immediate and\nlong-term health is your blood sugar or\nblood glucose regulation with levels you\ncan see how different foods and food\ncombinations exercise and sleep patterns\nimpact your blood glucose levels it's\nvery easy to use you just put the\nmonitor on the back of your arm and then\nyou take your phone and you scan it over\nthat monitor now and again and it\ndownloads the data about your blood\nsugar levels in the preceding hours\nusing levels has allowed me to learn a\ntremendous amount about what works best\nfor me in terms of nutrition exercise\nwork schedules and sleep so if you're\ninterested in learning more about levels\nand trying a continuous glucose monitor\nyou can go to levels. l/ huberman levels\nhas launched a new CGM sensor that is\nsmaller and has even better tracking\nthan the previous version right now\nthey're also offering an additional two-\nfree months of membership again that's\nlevels. linkhub to try the new sensor\nand two free months of membership\ntoday's episode is also brought To Us by\nAeropress Aeropress is similar to a\nFrench press for making coffee but is in\nfact a much better way to make coffee I\nfirst learned about Aeropress well over\n10 years a ago and I've been using one\never since Aeropress was developed by\nAllan Adler who was an engineer at\nStanford and I knew of Allen because he\nhad also built the so-called aobi\nfrisbee which I believe at one time\nperhaps still now held the Guinness Book\nof World Records for furthest Throne\nobject and I used to see Allan believe\nit or not at parks around paloalto\ntesting out different aobi frisbee so he\nwas sort of famous in our community for\ndeveloping these different Feats of\nengineering that turn turned into\ncommercial products now I love coffee\nI'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly\nevery day usually about 90 to 120\nminutes after I wake up in the morning\nalthough not always sometimes if I'm\ngoing to exercise I'll drink coffee\nfirst thing in the morning but I love\nlove love coffee and what I've\npersonally found is that by using the\narero Press I can make the best possible\ntasting cup of coffee I don't know what\nexactly it is in the arero press that\nallows the same beans to be prepared\ninto a cup of coffee that tastes that\nmuch better as compared to any other\nform of Brewing that coffee even the\ntraditional French press the Aero press\nis extremely easy to use and it's\nextremely compact in fact I take it with\nme whenever I travel and I use it on the\nroad in hotels even on planes I'll just\nask for some hot water and I'll Brew my\ncoffee or tea right there on the plane\nif you'd like to try Aeropress you can\ngo to Aero press.com huberman that's a r\no p\nrs.com huberman to get 20% off any\nAeropress coffee maker Aeropress ships\nanywhere in the USA Canada

being\nhere being invited uh high honor really\nappreciate it and it's not doctor it's\njust Rob okay Rob I've been looking\nforward to this conversation for a long\ntime I've seen your your now famous can\nwe also say Infamous but famous YouTube\nvideo about sugar we'll put a link to it\nin the show note captions it's been\nviewed many many millions of times yeah\nand I still can't figure out why that is\nyou know I didn't think my mother would\nwatch it and she didn't but 24 and a\nhalf million people did well I think\npeople are very interested in what to\neat what not to eat and we'll start off\nsimply talking about what most everyone\nbelieves and understands\nwhich is that a calorie is a form of\nheat\nenergy that's given off during the\nprocessing of some food bit or something\nif that's mysterious to people just\nunderstand that a calorie is a unit of\nenergy and I was taught and still many\nmany people worldwide believe that a\ncalorie is a calorie meaning if I\nconsume more calories in whatever form\nthen I metabolize by thinking feeling\nmoving exercising Etc then I will gain\nweight and if I consume fewer calories\nthan I burn I will lose weight and we\ncould talk a lot about where that weight\nloss comes from does it come from\nadapost body fat stores or from muscle\nor from protein or muscle of course is\nprotein Etc but let's start off with is\na calorie truly a calorie when it comes\nto the processing of different types of\ncalories everyone thinks that obesity is\nabout energy\nbalance that is calories in calories out\ntherefore two behaviors gluttony and\nsloth therefore if you're fat it's your\nfault\ntherefore diet and exercise therefore\nany calorie can be part of a balanced\ndiet therefore don't pick on our\ncalories go pick on somebody else's\ncalories this is actually what the food\nindustry uses to assuage their\nculpability for the change in the food\nsupply and the rise in obesity and\nchronic disease like diabetes now it is\ntrue that a calorie is that unit of\nenergy that raises one gram of water one\ndegree Centigrade and so therefore a\ncalorie burned is a calorie burned I\ndon't argue that that's true that's you\nknow the first law\nthermodynamics but that doesn't mean a\ncalorie eaten is a calorie eaten that's\nnot the same and that's where people get\nit wrong so let me give you some\nexamples of how that calorie eaten is\nnot a calorie\neating you like almonds I do me too\nalmonds are great okay you eat 160\ncalories in\nalmonds how many of those do you\nabsorb\n130 you eat 160 you absorb 130 where'\nthe other 30 go in the processing of\nthat food energy\nno turn out the fiber in those almonds\nboth soluble and insoluble fiber and by\nthe way fiber is sort of the key to the\nkingdom in this\nstory forms a gel on the inside of your\nintestine the insoluble fiber the\ncellulose forms a fishnet if F A lattice\nwork on the inside of your dadum the\nsoluble fiber which are globular plug\nthe holes in that fish net together they\nform a secondary barrier you can\nactually see it on electron microscopy a\nwhitish gel and that prevents absorption\nof those 30 calories so yes 130 get\nabsorbed but many of them don't they end\nup going further down the intestine to\nthe next part called the junam and\nthat's where the microbiome is now now\neveryone knows about the microbiome\nnowadays you know it's all the bacteria\nyou know we always say when women are\npregnant you're eating for two well\nwe're always eating for 100\ntrillion now they have to eat well what\ndo they eat they eat what you eat the\nquestion is how much did you get versus\nhow much did they get well if you ate\nalmonds they're getting those 30\ncalories so even though you count the\ncalories at your\nlips that doesn't matter what really\nmatters is counting the Cal calories at\nyour intestinal brush\nborder okay and they're not the same so\nif you feed your gut that's a good thing\nbecause then your gut will take those\ncalories and turn it into things like\nshort chain fatty acids which end up\nbeing protective against chronic\nmetabolic disease acetate propionate\nbutyrate valorate those are actually\ngood they're anti-inflammatory\nanti-alzheimer's because you fed your\nmicrobiome so even though you ate 160\nyou absorbed 130 so a calorie eaten is\nnot a calorie eaten because if you ate\nit with fiber it wasn't for you it was\nfor your bacteria but that's not the way\nyou count them up so that's problem\nnumber one problem number two amino\nacids so we all eat\nprotein let's say you eat too much\nprotein you yeah you know the Porter\nHouse steak all right now if you're a\nbodybuilder\nthose amino acids might go to muscle and\nyou might increase your muscle mass\nbecause you're a bodybuilder because\nyou're putting uh excess uh force on\nthose muscles and you're growing those\nmuscles okay but let's say you're not a\nbodybuilder let's say you're a mere\nmoral like me or let's say you're a kid\ngoing through puberty who's synthesizing\na lot of muscle not because they're\nlifting weights because they're because\ntestosterone's making it happen yeah\nabsolutely but let's say you're not\nlet's say you know you're just you know\njust slump off the the street like uh\nyou know joeo okay and you eat that\nPorter\nHouse you've taken on all these amino\nacids there's no place to store it other\nthan muscle so your liver takes the\nexcess and deamidates that amino acid\ntakes the amino group off to turn it\nfrom a amino acid into an organic acid\nand then that organic acid can then\nenter the kreb cycle the tricarboxylic\nacid cycle what goes on in the\nmitochondria in order to generate ATP\nthe chemical energy that your body needs\nin order to power itself okay now that's\na good thing it takes double the amount\nof energy to prepare that amino acid for\nburning as it does to uh prepare a\ncarbohydrate for burning or fat for\nbecause when I asked about when you\nasked about almonds why the the 160\nversus 130 I thought it was the\nprocessing it turned out it was fiber\nyou're saying for protein let let's make\nit realistic for a a really nice big\nporterhouse steak which I love by the\nway let's say let's say 800 calories\nyeah well it turns out how much of that\nis is uh so that's what goes in your\nmouth right my mouth right how much of\nit is actually um eaten in uh to stay\nwith the your calorie eaten is not a\ncalorie eaten in the processing of that\nwhat percentages actually goes into your\ntotal caloric intake right so about 10%\nof everything you eat goes to just\nmaintaining body temperature it's called\nthe thermic effect of food but when\nyou're eating protein you actually\ngenerate more Heat and the reason is\nbecause it takes to ATP to phosphorate\nthat organic acid as opposed to one ATP\nto uh phosphorate that carbohydrate for\nuh consumption so you actually have a\nnet loss of energy because it was a an\namino acid versus a monosaccharide a\nsugar now you you brought up fat fat\ndoesn't need to be phosphorated so it\nactually doesn't have any um thermic\neffective food at that point so depends\non what it is as to whether or not you\nhave loss okay so but in this um let's\nmake it actually realistic a 1600\ncalorie uh Porter House with a nice slab\nof of uh of fed butter on there I do\nthis every once in a while not not often\nwith some cream spinach and maybe some\nmushrooms along the side honestly I when\nI'm eating a porter house I don't want\nto adulterate The Taste okay with\nanything else except maybe some some\nbutter maybe a salad okay afterwards but\nbut let's say 1 1600 calories of of it's\ngot some fat in there for sure uh let's\nsay um uh a thousand of those calories\nis protein mhm the other 600 are\nfat something like that like that\ndepending on how marbled it is okay so\nbased on what you just said about the\nthermic effect of food and protein in\nparticular yeah of that thousand\ncalories how much actually is can we\ncount I'm not a calorie counter but does\none include as calories truly ingested\nwell if you ingested 1600 well that's\nwhat went in the mouth but but but what\nis is going to go against your your uh\nburn deficit right so I would have to\nactually do the math to figure that out\nbut as a guess yeah back of the envelope\nback of the envelope calculation you're\ngoing to lose about 25% of that wow so\nwe're talking 750 calories yeah you know\nso and to translate this a bit so what\nwe're saying here is if you're somebody\nwho is trying to lose weight or maintain\nweight or perhaps even gain weight you\neat a 1600 calorie Porter House with a\nslab of butter on it 600 of those\ncalories we're saying in this instance\nis fat with the remaining thousand\ncalories that's that all went in your\nmouth so you count it at your mouth\nright but 700 but then when you compare\nit against your energy burn for that day\nto maintain temperature brain activity\nphysical activity really it's only 750\ncalories that's right that's a huge\ndifference exactly and another reason\nwhy a calorie is not a calorie now let's\ntake the third let's take fats so over\nhere we have omega-3s heart healthy\nanti-inflammatory anti-alzheimer's save\nyour life and over here we have trans\nfats the devil incarnate consumable\npoison because you can't break the trans\ndouble bond you don't have the\ndesaturates to break that trans double\nbond so it basically accumulates lines\nyour arteries lines your liver causes\nchronic metabolic disease causes insulin\nresistance\nOmega-3s don't even get broken down for\nenergy because they're so important they\nstay intact because your brain needs\nthem your heart needs\nthem whereas trans fats can't be broken\ndown because of that trans double bond\none save your life other one kill you\nthey're both nine calories per gram if\nyou explode them in a bomb calorimeter\nbecause a calorie burned is a calorie\nburned but a calorie eaten is not a\ncalorie eaten because one will save your\nlife one will kill\nyou and finally the Big Kahuna the one\nthat blows everything else out of the\nwater from ose and glucose all right now\nglucose is the energy of life so here\nwe're talking carbohydrates I think most\nof our audience will be familiar with\nthe so-call macronutrients so we talked\nabout fat in this case almonds there's\nsome Fiber in there probably a little\nbit of carbohydrate a little bit little\nbit talked about the Porter House with\nbutter right making me hungry already\nthat's protein and fat M very little of\nany carbohydrate it should be zero\nessentially maybe one zero zero y\num and then now we're talking about\ncarbohydrates and we're going to\nsubdivide that into glucose and fructose\nright galactose basically becomes\nglucose in the liver so we we can\ndispense with that unless you have a\ndisease called galactosemia which is\nabout one in 20,000 um and causes\nneonatal menitis and you know it's a\ndisease as a pediatric endocrinologist I\nwould take care of but we can dispense\nwith that for the moment all right so\nglucose fructose glucose is the energy\nof life every cell on the planet Burns\nglucose for energy glucose is so damn\nimportant that if you don't consume it\nyour body makes it so it will take an\namino acid and turn it into glucose\nthat's gluconeogenesis glucogenesis\nthat's right it will take a fatty acid\nand turn it into glucose and\nspecifically the glycerol portion of the\ntriglyceride will turn into\nglucose\nso the\nInuit they didn't have any place to grow\ncarbohydrate they had ice they had whale\nblubber they still have serum glucose\nlevel and the reason is because you had\nto you have to have a serum glucose\nlevel in order to power your brain in\norder to power your heart yes you you\ncan use ketones of course you can but\nyou know only if you're in a ketogenic\nstate will you use exclusively ketones\nand you also need glucose for structural\nchanges in specific proteins and\nparticularly hormones so glucose\nmolecules will stud TSH LH FSH different\npituitary hormones in order to increase\ntheir potency it's one of the reasons\nwhy aging leads to defective\nhormonogenesis for instance hypogonadism\nhypothyroidism is the loss of\nglycosilation on individual um uh uh\npeptide hormones because of uh the\ninability to add glucose because of\ninsulin just it's an aging phenomenon\nokay we'll come back to this cuz I think\nthat's really important yeah the idea\nthat ingestion of\ncarbohydrates and the as you called it\nthe studing of carbohydrate molecules on\nhormones can augment the function of\nthose hormones and with aging that's a\nless efficient process it's a less\nefficient process but it's not because\nof consumption it's right people are\nstill I I see the the uh plenty of folks\nwho are uh 65 and older eating plenty of\ncarbohydrates you're saying a lot of\nthem have deficient thyroid testosterone\nestrogen right um prolactin Etc because\nof the Wes those carbohydrates are not\nstuding the uh the hormones exactly so\nthey're all of those are glycoprotein\nhormones let's tea that up for later\nbecause I think that's an interesting\nAvenue to go down okay and there's a and\nthere's a disease in children in in\nbabies called congenital disorders of\nglycosilation where you can't put uh uh\nglucose Mo uh molecules on specific\nproteins and it causes severe mental\nretardation all sorts of metabolic havoc\nand a lot of those babies die for that\nmatter so that's an important thing all\nright but that's how important glucose\nis fructose on the other hand this sweet\nmolecule the molecule we seek the reason\nwhy the food industry studs every food\nin the grocery store you know 73% of all\nitems in the American Grocery Store have\nadded sugar on purpose for the food\nindustry's purpose is not for yours\nbecause fructose is addictive activates\nthe nucleus accumbens the reward center\nof the brain in the same way that\ncocaine heroin nicotine alcohol do and\ndrives dopamine receptors down just like\nnicotine you know alcohol you know\ncocaine heroin\ndo that molecule\nfructose is number one uh completely\nvestigial to all vertebrate life there\nis no biochemical reaction in any\nvertebrate that requires dietary\nfructose that's number one number two\nokay sorry I'm going to juster so you're\nsaying that even though we can process\nfructose we have a limited capacity to\nprocess it in the same way we have a\nlimited capacity to metabolize\nalcohol now if you have one drink a day\nyou you're okay if you have two drinks a\nday depends on how big you are you know\nyou and I can probably I would argue two\ndrinks a week is the maximum but but\nlet's not go there the um but but in\nterms of you're saying when you\nsay fructose processing a fructose is\nvestigal what you're saying is that we\ndon't need to do it it's like the\nappendix it's an organ for which it has\nno function exactly and fructose has no\nfunction in the human body period you\ndon't need it you don't need it don't\nneed it but our diet is replete with it\nin fact our fructose consumption has\ngone up 25 fold since the beginning of\nthe last century I have to ask this now\nI love fruit I eat berries Galore\nespecially since the price of berries\nseems to have come down it used to be\nthat you only get them certain times of\nyear I'm what you call a drive by\nblueberry eater so I'll just walk past\nand just take a fist full you can't put\nthem in front of me without me eating\nthem this is even difficult for me when\nother people I don't know are eating\nthem so um I lots of blueberries\nstrawberries blackberries if they're in\nseason I love them no problem loaded\nwith fructose no plenty of fiber low\nfructose low fructose and berries\nberries are the lowest fructose of all\nthe so worried about asking you this\ntoday okay um and fruit is okay because\nof the fiber so the molecule the\nfructose molecule is the same whether\nit's in a berry or in a banana or for\nthat matter in in a Coca-Cola the\nfructose molecule is the same molecule\nthe difference is that in the berry it\ncomes with a whole lot of fiber and the\nbanana comes with a whole lot less fiber\nand in the Coca-Cola it doesn't come\nwith any fiber and the fiber is what\nmitigates the\nabsorption so when you consume the\nfructose with fiber so your blueberries\nyou're feeding your\nmicrobiome that fructose wasn't for you\ngot it such a relief and um\nI I must say recently I had a whole body\nMRI as a preemptive thing uh someone\nthat it was it was great I got to watch\na Netflix in there and um I never had a\nwhole body MRI I learned a few things\nthat were useful to me I've got a clean\nbill of health so that's great one of\nthe pie of feedback I got is um that my\ngut was filled with this very high\ncontrast um stuff right and they asked\nyou know do you consume a lot of\nblueberries and I said indeed I do why\nand they said um because that high\ncontrast offf it shows up white on the\nscan is um high concentrations of\nmagnesium MH um that we see in people\nthat ingest large amounts of blueberries\nwhich is pretty rare and yours are\ncomparable to a bear in blueberry season\nwow um and basically my entire gut was\nfilled with with blueberries I suppose I\nneed to cut back a little bit but now I\nknow that fruit is okay especially if\nthe fruit has a lot of fiber yeah but\nfructose itself especially if it's not\npartnered with fiber yeah is first of\nall not required for survival at all but\nyou're telling me is uh problematic yeah\nand let me tell you why it's problematic\nwe haven't gotten to that yet we're just\ntalking about whether it's vestigal\nversus needed now let's talk about what\nfructose\ndoes turns out fructose inhibits three\ncount them three separate enzymes\nnecessary for normal mitochondrial\nfunction now your mitochondrial make ATP\nyour mitochondria have to work at Peak\nefficiency that's what metabolic health\nis is mitochondri are working at Peak\nefficiency well there are three enzymes\nthat are inhibited by fructose number\none amp kinas all right now amp kinas is\nthe fuel gauge on the liver cell it's\nthe thing that tells the liver to make\nmore mitochondria fresher mitochondria\nbecause if your amp levels are high that\nmeans means you've def phosphorated a\nbunch of atps and you have to regenerate\nthem so you need some more mitochondria\nso it's a negative feedback pathway well\nyou need that amp kinas to generate that\nmitochondrial biogenesis signal except\nthat fructose a metabolite of fructose\ncalled methylglyoxal\nMGO sits in the active site of the gamma\nsubunit of that amp kinas and actually\nbinds to arginines in that active site\nrendering that uh uh enzyme now dead\nit's an irreversible inhibition because\nof the Cove valent bonding of that\nmethylglyoxal that alahh to the Arginine\nand now that enzyme is dead Okay so it\nbasically acts like a key that doesn't\nturn the lock but prevents the the key\nthat you want in that lock from entering\nthe the lock it's like it's like gluing\na lock shut yeah got it all right so\nthat's one of the enzymes that's one\nokay second one aad L asil COA\ndehydrogenase longchain so this is\nnecessary to cleave two carbon fragments\nof fatty acids to prepare them for uh uh\nmetabolism so it inhibits that one and\nthen finally it inhibits carnitine pidal\ntransferase one now cpt1 now that's the\nenzyme that regenerates carnitine\ncarnitine is the shuttle mechanism by\nwhich you get the uh fatty acids from\nthe outer mitochondrial membrane\nthrough to the inner mitochondrial\nmembrane so that they can be beta\noxidized for energy so if you don't have\nthat c uh\ncpt1 you're basically carnitin lless and\ntherefore you can't generate um beta\noxidation you said fructose inhibits all\nthree of these enzymatic Pathways y as a\nbiologist I have to ask you know how\npotently does it inhibit them I mean\nbecause there's there are drugs that\nblock receptors and then there are drugs\nthat block receptors with in\nunbelievable Affinity so you know I mean\nmechanistically in a dish meaning in\nvitro you can see all sorts of things\nbut how how significant is this for like\nfor obesity for mitochondrial function\nin Vivo in us all right so look you know\nthe the dose determines the poison right\nparacelsus\n1537 um there are toxins that are parts\nper billion and will kill you like sarin\nrysen Cyanide by the way I is a good\nanalogy because it's working on\nmitochondria it's basically causing\nmitochondria to be completely defective\nall right then there are um intermediate\ntoxins like Arsenic and carbon\ntetrachloride parts per million and they\ntake a little longer to work they're not\ngoing to kill you on the spot that's why\nI can eat an apple seed that has a\nlittle bit of arsenic in it but I'm not\ngoing to die right and then finally\nthere and by the tobacco smoke goes in\nthere and then finally you have um uh\nweak toxins all right and you know where\nit's not one exposure that will kill you\nit's you know 10,000 exposures that'll\nkill you like alcohol or toxic people\nyeah or toxic\nwell toxic couldn't resist sorry\nsometimes it don't mildly toxic people\nanyway the point is that fructose is in\nthat last category so it's not what you\ndo one day that kills you it's what you\ndo every day that kills you and if you\nbasically eat Ultra processed food high\nin sugar for 10 years in a row it's\ngoing to show up in terms of your\ncomorbidities and ultimately yeah it\nwill kill you and we have the data to\nshow you know how many years you will\nlose so right now in America we pay an\n8year longevity tax if you look at Japan\nwho uh they have a mean age of death of\n88 we have a mean age of 80 okay we're\npaying an eight-year longevity tax just\nby living here and we're talking about\nthe healthy people now if you have\nmetabolic syndrome it's a 15-year\nlongevity tax and uh sorry if you\nobesity it's a 15year longevity taxt and\nif you have metabolic syndrome it's a\n20-year longevity\ntaxt that is primarily not completely\nbut primarily sugar it's also you know\nomega-6 it's also trans fats you know\nleft over because now they're gone but\nyou know people are still suffering the\nravages of the trans fats you know from\nthe previous generation are they gone I\nmean I do remember as a kid when we had\nmargarine in our refrigerator this is\nactually a big debate in my home one\nparent I won't identify which um was Pro\nmargarine the other was Pro butter anti-\nmargarine right um the marriage didn't\nlast but there were other reasons that's\nprobably why I went butter um butter is\nfine in fact time declared you know\nfront cover Butter's back you know um\nmargarine was the bad guy without\nquestion U and we know now but you know\nback when we thought it was a calorie\nwas a calorie we thought oh margarine\nyou know it's the same you know nine\ncalories per gram and we said it lowers\nyour\ntriglycerides bad idea it was because\nwhat it did was it lined your liver\nbecause you couldn't break that trans\ndouble\nbond and um you know so they're they're\nnow gone from our uh food supply they're\nillegal they're illegal they're banned\nbut you can make trans fats in your own\nkitchen by taking olive oil and heating\nit to beyond the smoking point so\nthey're not completely gone they're just\ngone from ultr processed food so now\nsugar is the big problem because of\nthese three enzymes that you are\ninhibiting the point is we were we\nstarted this with a calorie is a calorie\nwell if you are inhibiting mitochondrial\nfunction then a calorie is not a calorie\nis it you're reducing the um intensity\nof the Furnace yeah exactly so this\nwhole calories of calorie just makes no\nsense and it hasn't worked at any level\nand there is no study that actually\nshows that cutting calories makes a\ndifference and I can show you you know\nvoluminous data that shows that virtu Al\nevery weight loss study that caus that\nled to you know caloric restriction\nbasically didn't work not for any length\nof time just to round out our earlier\ndiscussion because I find it fascinating\nand I know other people will as well\ntalked about that 160 calories that's\nactually 130 at the business end of\nthings uh of almonds we talked about the\nPorter House steak with butter and the\n25% reduction in what's actually quote\nunquote eaten and I'll get back to this\nbecause this quote unquote is I think\nthe problem is there's there's a lack of\nuseful language to dissociate this stuff\nyou know even just calling fat fat\npeople think it it's going to make you\ngain body fat totally if we called it\nadapost tissue and lipids we would have\navoided this confusion so I I don't want\nto get there just yet but I I want to\nmake sure with the food industry does\nthis on purpose oh absolutely so they\ntell you a sugar is a sugar which is not\ntrue they tell you a calor is a calorie\nwhich is not true and they tell you a\nfat is a fat which is not true okay this\nis very specifically so when you're\ntalking about sugar you're talking about\ndietary sugar are you talking about\nblood sugar because blood sugar is blood\nglucose or dietary cholesterol or\ncirculating cholesterol or you\nabsolutely okay so we we've done this um\nyou know uh to ourselves but the food\nindustry has really promulgated it\nbecause we farmed out nutrition policy\nand information to the food in so they\nactually use this for their purposes\nit's one of the problems in this\nfield as we all know quality nutrition\ninfluences of course our physical health\nbut also our mental health and our\ncognitive functioning our memory our\nability to learn new things and to focus\nand we know that one of the most\nimportant features of highquality\nnutrition is making sure that we get\nenough vitamins and minerals from\nhighquality unprocessed or minimally\nprocessed sources as well as enough\nprobiotics and prebiotics and fiber to\nsupport basically basally all the\ncellular functions in our body including\nthe gut microbiome now I like most\neverybody try to get optimal nutrition\nfrom Whole Foods ideally mostly from\nminimally processed or non-processed\nFoods however one of the challenges that\nI and so many other people face is\ngetting enough servings of high quality\nfruits and vegetables per day as well as\nfiber and probiotics that often\naccompany those fruits and vegetables\nthat's why way back in 2012 long before\nI ever had a podcast I started drinking\nag1 and so I'm Ed the ag1 is sponsoring\nthe hubman Lab podcast the reason I\nstarted taking ag1 and the reason I\nstill drink ag1 once or twice a day is\nthat it provides all of my foundational\nnutritional needs that is it provides\ninsurance that I get the proper amounts\nof those vitamins minerals probiotics\nand fiber to ensure optimal mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nif you'd like to try ag1 you can go to\ndrink a1.com huberman to claim a special\noffer they're giving away five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim that special offer for\nthe third category of macronutrients\ncarbohydrates you differentiated um\nglucose and fructose MH if I ingest um\nlet's say a half a bagel um since we\nwere talking about New York your city of\norigin they have great Bagels on the\nwest coast yeah know not the same it's\nit's pretty pitiful same with the pizza\ndough it's like they claim it's the the\nthe water whatever it is it's different\nback there and it's better indeed half a\nbagel let's say 250 calories mostly\ncarbohydrate mhm this is an an unlined\nun no cream cheese no shmear as they\ncall back there no no cream cheese no\nbutter none that just half a bagel 250\ncalories so that's what I ate you're\nsaying that a calorie eaten is not a\ncalorie eaten how much of that\ncarbohydrate given that it's probably\nmost let's assume it's mostly glucose\nlet's do it this way yeah it is it's\npolymerized glucose okay glucose how\nmuch of that is actually utilized or\nburned versus um you know the original\n250 so if you look at what happens to\nenergy in the body\n65% of that which is ingested goes to\nresting energy expenditure just to power\nthe body 10% goes to the thermic effect\nof food and then 25% goes to activity\nthat's the breakdown of where the uh\nenergy goes and that's calories from fat\nprotein and carbohydrates yeah from\neverything together and you know glucose\nis a perfectly good example of how that\nworks the point is though that when you\ningest glucose you're getting a big\nglucose Excursion in your bloodstream so\nyou're getting a big glucose Spike and\nthat glucose Spike has to come down well\nwhat makes it come down the hormone\ninsulin insulin is the bad guy in the\nstory\nthe higher your glucose goes the more\nyour pancreas will release insulin in\norder to bring that glucose down Well\nturns out that glucose rise was not\nbenign that glucose rise led to\nendothelial dysfunction transient but\nnonetheless endothelial dysfunction\ncould you just um remind people what\nendothelial cells are the inside of your\narteries okay and it will change blood\npressure we've got plenty of data to\ndemonstrate how it changes blood\npressure and over time that will cause\ncoronary artery disease that will cause\nkidney disease Etc but it's the insulin\nresponse that is really the bad guy now\npeople think insulin is good because it\nlowers blood glucose after all diabetics\ntake insulin you know to lower their\nblood\nglucose okay let's take a diabetic\npatient with diabetes blood sugar's 300\nthat's bad we give them a shot of\ninsulin in the arm blood sugar goes down\ndown to 100 blood sugar went from 300 to\n100 okay where did the 200 points of\nblood glucose\ngo I'm assuming that the insulin was\nsequestered it to where I'm assuming to\nthe liver to the fat interesting for\nstorage that's insulin's job insulin\ntakes whatever you're not burning and\nputs it into fat for storage insulin is\nnot the diabetes hormone insulin is the\nenergy stor hormone how quickly does it\ndo that because because if I'm you know\nhaving a a very busy day mhm or that a\ndiabetic person is having a very busy\nday and they're moving around a lot then\nyou got insulin bound glucose in the\nbloodstream uh for how long no no\ninsulin doesn't bind glucose insulin\nbinds to its receptor sure sorry Sor and\nallows for glucose Transporters to work\nso so but for some period of time while\nthat person is active There's an\nopportunity to utilize that glucose yeah\nright yeah um so how quickly is insulin\nmanaging that glucose uh we know that\nthe spike comes down quickly but the\nglucose is not available for energy\nutilization after what it's or it's it's\nsequestered to the the adapost to the\nfat tissue at within an hour is that\nabout so about 90 minutes yeah but I\nmean if if you're if you're active if\nyou eat uh you know a muffin and you're\nactive Okay your muscles are going to\ntake up that glucose IR perspective of\ninsulin in fact muscles are insulin\nindependent they have glucose\nTransporters but they are insulin\nindependent because if they weren't then\nevery patient in diabetic keto acidosis\nwould be paralyzed okay so glucose will\nend up in muscles irrespective of energy\nstatus and uh insulin status and in\nmuscles it's used as immediate Fuel and\nglycogen both okay met Fuel and glycogen\nstorage okay in the muscle\nabsolutely all right now if you're\nactive then you will clear glucose into\nmuscle Therefore your blood glucose\nwon't rise as much because it went into\nmuscle and therefore your pancreas will\nput out less insulin because it doesn't\nhave to clear as much from the\nbloodstream and that's okay that's good\nright but let's say you didn't exercise\nso you've got a big glucose Excursion\nnow you have a big insulin response and\nthat insulin is going to take the excess\nthat's in your blood it has to clear it\nand it will go to fat for storage that\ninsulin rise turns out to be\nparticularly egregious in terms of\nmetabolic disease and I can prove it\nthere is a mouse my favorite Mouse I\nlove this mouse this mouse turns\nmedicine on its head and teaches every\ndoctor why they have to go back to\nmedical school and learn it\nright this mouse is called the padco\nmouse p o d i r KO is it discovered by\npadco no no it was uh discovered in Ron\nK it was manufactured in Ron cons lab so\nthis is a tissue specific insulin\nreceptor knockout Mouse Okay IR KO\ninsulin LAX insulin receptor in specific\nthe kidney in the kidney interco\nglomular poicy insulin receptor knockout\nwe haven't talked too much about\ntransgenic models and knockins and\nKnockouts so uh just in 10 seconds or Le\nbasically these are mice that are\ngenetically engineered to lack the\nreceptor for insulin specifically in the\nglul poite the kidney in the in the\nkidney and everywhere else in this mouse\ninsulin does its thing normally exactly\ngreat so these animals are ug glycemic\nnormal blood glucose levels these\nanimals are normally glucose tolerant\nthey you know go up they go down just\nlike every other\nMouse these mice are not fat these mice\nare not thin these mice are\nmice except they have the worst diabetic\nnephropathy on the planet so their ner\noh their kidney is degenerative their\nkidneys is degenerate to nothing yikes\nnow they have normal blood glucose\nlevels they have normal glucose\ntolerance they have normal insulin\ntolerance whole body but they're kidneys\nare\ndying how come can't be the\nglucose it's the\ninsulin because insulin is the bad guy\ninsulin's actually making the kidney\ndisease and so these animals that are\ninsulin resistant they have diabetic\nnephropathy without\ndiabetes so the insulin is having a\nnegative clearly negative effect on the\nkidneys without binding to the receptor\nexactly so circulating insulin can do\nstuff without binding to its receptor\nwell it's no it binds to its receptor in\ndifferent parts of the body other parts\nof the body party it can't because it's\na knockout because it's knockout right\nthe point is insulin does stuff by\nitself and it turns out insulin drives\ngrowth now every cell in your\nbody wants to burn at one time in its\nlife and wants to grow at another time\nin life every cell has those two\nPathways burning growth burning growth\nwhat determines whether a\ncell should be burning or whether a cell\nshould be growing I don't know what\nmakes it um burning but presumably it's\nin the has something to do with\nmitochondria it has everything to do\nwith mitochondria right so every cell\nneeds to burn and needs to grow at a\ndifferent time in its life here's a way\nto think about it we all start out as a\nzygote a single\ncell we end up an\nadult now that single cell had to become\ntwo\ncells those two cells had to become four\ncells those four cells had to become\neight cells and on and on and on and on\nso every cycle there's a\ndoubling how many doublings to get from\na zygote to an adult what's an\nexponential growth so yeah I don't I\ndon't know it off the top of my head\n41 41 41 two to the 41 doublings giv you\nan organism 10 trillion cells we're 10\ntrillion cells we're 10 trillion cells\ndid we know that yeah okay two to the 41\nokay okay now of those 41 doublings some\nof them had to occur in\nutero some of them had to occur\npostnatally so I need two numbers that\nadd up to 41 how many in utero how many\npostnatally well way\nmore you start off with a lot more than\nyou end up with but then you have cells\nthat turn over throughout the lifespan\nso this is a tough one okay because skin\ncells turnover I I with neurons it's\nit's pretty straightforward because\nyou're going to somewhere between three\nand 10 right well you're and you're born\nwith somewhere between 3 and 10x of what\nyou end up with depending on the brain\nstructure so but for whole body I don't\nknow how you'd come up with that number\n36 and\nfive okay 36 doublings\nprenatally five doublings postnatally\nand I can prove that to you too typical\nbaby weighs s pounds first doubling 14\npounds second doubling 208 lb next\ndoubling 56 lb next doubling 112 lb next\ndoubling 224 lb that's hopefully it\nstops OB division hopefully it stops\nthere not not all people 212 lbs are\nobese um but some people who are of\ncertain Heights or below are 212 aerobes\nokay point is the cell has to know when\nto grow and when to burn it turns out\nthat the signal for that is\noxygen because oxygen is necessary for\nmitochondria to be able to burn in the\nabsence of oxygen the cell only knows\nhow to grow this is actually why OT\nwarberg won the Nobel Prize in 19 1931\nfor the warberg effect he asked the\nquestion how come cancer cells don't\nneed oxygen to grow and the answer is\nbecause no cell needs oxygen to grow in\nfact oxygen is the thing that prevents\ngrowth famous article from the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine 1951 Mount\nEverest in utero because every\nfetus is oxygen\ndeprived so normal\npartial pressure of oxygen 100 millim of\nmercury out here right if if I checked\nyour blood it'd be about 100 right I\nhope so how about a tumor cell um\nguessing tumor cell is\nprobably is it double about 44 wait you\njust told me partial pressure of of\noxygen in a tumor cell it's about 44\nwell you just told me that well tumor\ncells which grow like wild right they\ngrow like wild because they don't have\noxygen\nbut they but there's some of the so\nhere's what's peculiar about it um tumor\ncells are some of the most vascularized\ncells or tumors are are heavily\nvascularized I mean I mean one way to\none way to try and kill one is to to\ndevascularize the tumor yes and you know\nAng Genesis inhibition Etc you it's a\nbig deal you know Judah folman and all\nthat from Harvard you know so the excess\nblood to a tumor is the attempt to bring\nin oxygen that it's not getting that's\nright as opposed to deliv in lots of\noxygen and that's why it's growing\nthat's right okay but a fetus what's the\npartial pressure in the placenta I don't\nknow 6 to\n31 so it's actually like a mile above\nMount Everest that's how much oxygen the\nfetus gets and it's that for that reason\nthat you've got 36 doublings and then as\nsoon as you're out you know you cut the\ncord and you start breathing and now\nyour partial pressure is at 100 that's\nwhen growth slows down\nhas there been any effort to treat\ntumors by oxygenating tumors yes and\nwhat does that look like it's hyperbaric\noxygen therapy it's a thing oh yeah yeah\nyeah we we'll probably do an episode on\nhyperbaric chambers it's the the the\nreason we haven't yet is it's pretty\nniche in but there are people who own\nthese things who sit in these things um\nokay so we got here by way of by way of\ncar by The Bagel right um so I just want\nto orient us um that you just that 250\ncalories of the The Bagel we talked\nabout glucose excursions but it's that\ninsulin rise that's driving the atopos\nit's also driving the\ngrowth okay in the absence of oxygen\nbecause if you have oxygen then you\ndon't need that much\ninsulin okay\nso because you're going to burn instead\nof store got\nit in terms of the the uh the raw\nmetabolism\nof carbohydrate though that glucose if I\neat 250 calories of glucose how much of\nthat did I quote unquote actually eat\nhow much is is used how much is used\nyeah let's assume that I'm I'm at my\ndesk working or I'm walking around a\nlittle bit I'm not I'm not exercising\nhard in the in the subsequent hour so\nused for what is the question I'm\ngetting back to the calorie is is a\ncalorie a calorie clearly the answer is\nno based on the processing of different\ntypes of calories we established it for\nfat the almonds we establish it for\nprotein\nthe Porter House with butter and now\nwe're we're trying to establish that for\nthe 250 calories of of bagel which is\nglucose right so the glucose has to be\nphosphorated so you're going to lose uh\nan ATP in the process so you're going to\ngo ATP goes to ADP and then that ADP\nwill go to am a denzine monophosphate\nwhich will then go to im an ocol\nmonophosphate which will then go to uric\nacid okay and that uric acid will be\nthen released from the cell circulate in\nthe bloodstream and hopefully go out in\nthe kidney in the process that uric acid\ncan inhibit mitochondrial function and\nit can also inhibit endothelial nitric\noxide synthese which is the enzyme in\nyour vasculature that is your endogenous\nblood pressure lowerer right by\nexpanding blood vessels and capillaries\nexactly right this is the mechanistic uh\nfoundation of the drugs that were\noriginally used for uh improving\nprostate function but are used to treat\nerectile dysfunction which are the the\nPD Inhibitors which allow nitric oxide\nto be uh around longer and more of it\nright people use it for other purposes\ntoo um now no one will forget if I queue\nit up with that that example well we we\nuh you know in the neonatal Intensive\nCare Unit it closes patent ductus\narteriosis which is a big deal in uh in\nthe neonatal uh uh World okay I I want\nto ask you about that but but um so I\nheard two things one is that um gluc ose\nand the insulin that goes with it\nincreases uric acid MH uric acid while\nit has certain important functions in\nhealth too much of it you said Can\ninhibit nitric oxide yeah can inhibit\nnitric oxide so that means that the\nblood vessels and capillaries are going\nto stay more constricted so blood\npressure is going to be higher than it\nwould be normally that's right and then\nuric acid is also inhibiting\nmitochondrial function that's right okay\num but eating half a bagel isn't\nnecessarily a terrible thing if it's\nwithin your caloric require requirements\nit and it it all depends on how much uh\nyou clear and how high your insulin goes\nnow let's compare that 250 calories of\nglucose to 250 calories of fructose\nright uh let's let's come up with a food\nexample 250 calories of fructose would\nbe trivial to uh consume in the form of\nhigh fructose corn syrup right well so\nremember that high fructose corn syrup\nis half glucose half fructose 125 125 so\nlet's not use that well so let's assume\num so we can talk about a soda for uh to\nget that that uh 250 calories easily um\nespecially if it's not a can or a\nEuropean siiz bottle or can 8 o 8 oz can\nof soda okay so 8 oce can of soda um and\nmaybe let's include a food item let's\ntalk like a store-bought packaged cookie\ncouple Oreos two Oreos okay probably get\nyou to that 250 or maybe four Oreos\nmaybe three Oreos yeah okay um Oreo\nlovers everywhere celebrate\nthree 250 calories of\nfructose what's the effect on uric acid\nwhat's the effect on caloric burn what's\nthe effect on anything for that matter\nthat uh we should be aware of all right\nso first of all the Oreo has plenty of\nfructose in it so keep that in mind okay\nthe um if let's say you consumed uh 250\ncalories in a bagel because that's\npretty much polymerized glucose versus\nsay the soda so the bagel versus the\nsoda that's what you're equalent\ncalories equalent calories or the The\nBagel versus let's say two Oreos and a\nlittle bit of um and yeah two Oreos okay\nso number one there's only half the\nglucose in the soda because the other\nhalf is the fructose it's 125125 so your\nglucose rise won't be as high your\nglucose Excursion will be lower this is\nactually one of the reasons why there's\nthis thing called glycemic index\nglycemic index is a Canard it's garbage\nit is complete and utter BS the glycemic\nindex absolute BS nothing nothing is\nmore um uh egregious in terms of uh\nargument than then than the glycemic\nindex and this is one of the things that\ndietitians promote and espouse and one\nof the things that's got to go okay this\nis an idea that must die okay we'll get\nback to why the glycemic index has got\nto die uh but so so the 250 calories and\nactually can we can we make these equal\njust for sake of of Simplicity can we\nsay 250 calories of glucose from The\nBagel versus 250 calories of fructose\nhow do we get 250 calories of pure\nfructose we don't you can't okay you got\nto bring the glucose with lab Lab\nfructose you'd have to make it with the\nOreos which is half glucose half\nfructose right I mean there is no\nfructose alone in nature even crackers\nsome of the ones that are salty are also\nsweet they have fructose in them\nAbus yeah that's why it's impossible to\neat just one indeed um so what's\nhappening biochemically as a consequence\nof the fructose component specifically\nso the fructose will first of all go\ninto the intestine the intestine will\nmetabolize some of that fructose through\nwhat is known as intestinal denova\nlipogenesis about 10% of that fructose\nwill be turned into fat right in the\nintestine and that's cuz fructose it\njust wants to be fat yeah fructose wants\nto be fat fructose is the lipogenic\nsubstrate here we're not talking about\nbody fat we're talking about fat\nmolecules that can potentially be used\nas energy that's right triglyceride\nmolecules okay so that so 10% of that\nfructose will be turned into\ntriglyceride right in the intestine and\nbe released into the bloodstream and it\nis the reason for a post prandial\ntriglyceride response postprandial is uh\nand I'm including myself in this group\nis nerd speak for after eating lunch\ntypically it's\nlunch so that's actually one of the\ndrivers of cardiovascular pathology that\nintestinal denova lipogenesis turning\nthat fructose into triglyceride right in\nthe intestine now there's a limit to how\nfast and how much the intestine can do\nthat the rest of the fructose will be uh\nabsorbed into the portal vein but not\nbefore some of that fructose will make\nit further down and it will Nitro create\ntight Junction proteins now okay portal\nve the kidney portal ve goes to the\nliver portal vean goes from the visceral\nfrom the intestine to the liver no K\ndoesn't feed the kidney no\nkidney intestine to liver okay okay but\nfructose nitrates tight Junction\nproteins now let me explain that to your\naudience your intestine is a\nsewer definition of a sewer a pipe with\n in it okay that's a sewer our\nintestines are\nsewers there's junk in the center and\nthe job of the intestine is to move the\njunk through to the anus absorbing the\ngood stuff while you can the intestine\nis made up of cells intestinal\nepithelial cells that are bound together\nand they're bound with proteins that\nbasically form a barrier those barriers\ncalled tight Junction proteins things\nlike cloudin and things like that um\nzulin is the main one okay there are\nothers but zulin is the one that goes is\ndefective in the celiac disease what\ndefines a tight Junction is it is like\ncompletely impermeable or semi-permeable\ncompletely impermeable okay unless its\nfunction is inhibited turns out if you\nalter the um phosphorilation status or\nthe nitrate status of that tight\nJunction it will will become transiently\npermeable okay and so fructose nitrates\nTI Junction proteins causing them to be\ntransiently permeable allowing some of\nthe junk in your intestine to get\nthrough into your bloodstream so this is\nleaky gut this is leaky gut this is what\ncauses leaky gut fructose is a driver of\nleaky gut got it that causes\ninflammation at the level of the liver\nwhich ultimately leads to systemic\ninflammation one of the reasons why High\nSensi CRP sensitivity CRP is high in\npatients who eat ultrapress food CRP is\nC reactive protein which is a marker of\na essentially inflammatory immune\nresponse exactly yeah you don't want it\ntoo high and 93% of Americans today are\ninflamed does that mean that 93% of\nAmericans have leaky guts yeah it does\nbecause that's where it comes from so in\naddition to limiting fructose intake\nMH what are things that um support the\ntight junctions of of the intestinal\npathway so there are three barriers in\nyour intestine to keep the junk where it\nbelongs in the center so that it can get\npooped out the you're behind all right\nthree separate barriers one is a\nphysical barrier called the muin layer\nso it's a layer of mucus that actually\nsits on top of the intestinal epithelial\ncells now now that mucin is a\npolysaccharide and the bacteria can use\nthat mucin layer for its own purposes it\nwill eat your mucin layer if you don't\nfeed your bacteria you must feed your\nbacteria or your bacteria will feed on\nyou MH okay so you are in concert with\nyour microbiome if you deprive your\nmicrobiome of the food that it needs it\nwill use you as its food and that's one\nof the reasons why fire fiber is so\nimportant so fiber to build up this muin\nlayer is one way to reinforce the the uh\nthe fence that that is the tight\njunctions Etc ex um between your\nintestine and the bloodstream exactly\nthis raises an interesting point about\nfasting many people including myself do\na sort of pseudo intermittent fasting I\neat my first meal somewhere between 11:\nand noon I'm not strict about this the\n11 versus noon thing and probably eat my\nlast bite of food somewhere around 8:00\np.m. and occasionally it's outside that\nwindow I've done this for a long time\nit's feels best to me right but other\npeople use a shorter eating window one\nthing that I learned from a colleague at\nYale who studies the gut microbiome that\nwas surprising to me is that when you do\nwhen you eat in that way there's a long\nstretch of time sometimes longer for\npeople that have a shorter eating window\nlonger fasting what know that is yeah\nwhere you're actually eating up your own\nintestinal lining so this idea that\nfasting is so great for us on the one\nhand might be true on the other hand\nyou're you're actually consuming\nassuming components of your you're not\nfeeding your gut microbiome and you\ndeplete it but then here's where I was\npositively surprised when you do eat\nprovided that you eat enough fiber and\nin particular high quality fermented\nfoods low sugar fermented foods it seems\nthat the the lining of the gut and the\ngut microbiome is replenished to a level\nthat is greater than if you had eaten\nfor longer periods of the 24-hour cycle\ndo I have that right we do you do have\nit right and I don't know why that is\ntrue but it does seem to be the case and\nfermented foods B in part because\nthey've got already short chain fatty\nacids in them um see the preferred food\nof the microbiome well it's what the\nmicrobiome actually turns fiber into so\nit's probably helping your intestinal\nepithelial cells in the same way what\nthe microbiome turning fiber into short\nchain fatty acids helps so it's what we\ncall a postbiotic so you have Prebiotic\nwhich is the food for the bacteria you\nhave the probiotic which is the the\nbacteria itself and then you have the\npostbiotic which is what the bacteria\nmake in order to heal you okay and so\nshort chain fatty acids are postbiotics\nand there are a lot of people selling\nshort chain fatty acids you know drinks\nand supplements and what have you\nwhether they work or not is another\nstory if I consume fructose in the uh\nform of let's say a highly processed\nfood has minimal antioxidants but it's\ngot plenty of calories typically um Y\nand it's disrupting the tight junctions\nmaking my gut leaky right but I'm also\neating fiber y you know I'm having a you\nknow a meal that includes a salad I'm\nhaving having some probiotics and then I\nwant like a couple rees's peanut butter\ncups like in the dark chocolate ones in\nparticular I don't do this anymore but I\nused to eat like that more often as as\ntime has gone on I've become I don't\nlike to call it stricter but more I I I\ntend to like healthier foods over time\nand I think you can get away with\ndifferent things at different stages of\nLife although you work with young people\nso we'll uh we'll get to very young\npeople so we'll get to this but how how\nmuch damage am I doing by ingesting any\nfructose in the form of a highly\nprocessed food so I'll make it very\nsimple\nAndrew I am for\ndessert for dessert I am not for dessert\nfor breakfast lunch snacks and dinner\nokay so if you want to have a couple of\nree's peanut butter cups as your dessert\nin the same way as you might have a\nconac for\ndessert that's fine I have no problem\nwith that the question is are you going\nto eat re's peanut butter cuffs for\nbreakfast no I don't eat breakfast but\nno I got but I see your point the\nNational School breakfast program which\n29% of school children today consume is\na bowl of fro loops and a glass of\norange juice that is 41 gam of sugar\nAmerican Heart associate says that the\nupper limit for children should be 12\ngram of added sugar per day that's 41\ngrams of added sugar and it's just\nbreakfast and that's fructose Rich\ntotally completely so the question is\nwhich dessert are we talking about and\nright and can we can we adjust that\nmorning meal um to a different reality\ncuz I agree that there are plenty of\nkids eating that or a muffin that might\nbe the equivalent um but what about the\nparent who's has okay let's come up with\na healthier option that the kids still\nlikes like a I'm thinking back to my\nchildhood like a honeynut Cheerios or\nsomething so not Froot Loops which is\nkind of the extreme um take a look at\nthe side of the package no difference\nand now let's say they go with um some\nuh like waffles that are made so with a\nwith a pre-made U mix some milk some\nbutter um you know so mom or dad is\nmaking waffles great it sounds healthier\nbut then if you do the breakdown or\nwe're still ending up at very high are\nwe basically eating dessert for\nbreakfast in Cas are we eating ego\nwaffles or we uh making waffles uh\ndenovo you know from scratch in your own\nkitchen let's say big\ndifference okay because the Eggo waffles\nyou know replete with sugar on purpose\nbecause the food industry knows when\nthey add it you buy more because it's\naddictive okay and we actually have the\num uh uh demographic the mechanistic the\nImaging and also the economic data to\ndemonstrate that Sugar's addictive and\nthe food industry knows it so have you\never heard of a phenomenon called price\nelasticity okay price elasticity is an\neconomic term that is used to ask the\nquestion if the price of a given good\ngoes up by\n1% that should result in reduction in\npurchase or consumption because price\ninfluences\nconsumption how much does it influence\nit so if it's if something's price\nelastic when the price goes up\nconsumption goes down\nequivalently a food that is price\nelastic the most price elastic food is\neggs so when the price of eggs goes up\n1% consumption of eggs goes down\n68% meaning that eggs have a price\nelasticity of.\n32 got it got it now what's the most\npric in elastic\nfood the top three most price inelastic\nfoods are fast food Cal can1 I like a\ngood quiz fast food 081 um uh uh soft\ndrinks at 79 and juice at 77 meaning\npeople will pay not whatever but they'll\nthey're willing to pay more more more\nreadily willing to pay more because of\nthe sugar because it's addictive because\nit's honic so many many years ago Andrew\nyou probably remember something called\nKeynesian economics and Keynesian\neconomics was based on this concept of\nthe rational actor and the rational\nactor can determine value which is\nutility over\ncost and if you're a rational actor you\nshould be able to say yeah I'll buy that\nbut I won't buy that right\nokay in\n1979 Daniel canaman and Amos\nfski Nobel Prize winner Daniel canaman\ndescrib the irrational\nactor now the irrational actor cannot\ndetermine value and the reason is\nbecause he is risk averse so the cost is\nalways too great so the utility may be\nthe same but the cost goes up because\nthat's why they have you know aversive\nTendencies the irrational actor Jeffrey\nSachs has described the honic actor who\nalso cannot determine value because it\ndoesn't matter what it costs they need\ntheir\nfix and this is what's going on and the\nfood industry knows it and that's why\nevery food in the store has been\nspiked I'd like to take a quick break to\nacknowledge our sponsor element elements\nis an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you\ndon't that means zero sugar and the\nappropriate ratios of the electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium and that\ncorrect ratio of electrolytes is\nextremely important because every cell\nin your body but especially your nerve\ncells your neurons relies on\nelectrolytes in order to function\nproperly so when you're well hydrated\nand you have the appropriate amount of\nelectrolytes in your system your mental\nfunctioning and your physical\nfunctioning is improved I drink one\npacket of element dissolved in about 16\nto 32 ounces of water when I wake up in\nthe morning as well as while I exercise\nand if I've sweat a lot during that\nexercise I often will drink a third\nelement packet dissolved in about 32\nounces of water after I exercise element\ncomes in a variety of different flavors\nall of which I find really tasty I like\nthe Citrus I like the watermelon I like\nthe raspberry frankly I can't pick just\none it also comes in chocolate and\nchocolate mint which I find tastes best\nif they are put into water dissolved and\nthen heated up I tend to do that in the\nwinter months because of course you\ndon't just need hydration on hot days\nand in the summer and spring months but\nalso in the winter when the temperatures\nare cold and the environment tends to be\ndry if you'd like to try element you can\ngo to drink element spelled\nel.com huberman to try a free sample\npack again that's drink element.com\nhuberman we talked about dessert for\nbreakfast in the the form of cereals\nsome of which are um disguised or\ncouched as healthier you know I think of\nlike honeynut Cheerios it seems\nhealthier than Froot Loops it looks\nhealthier like the just by way of color\nit looks kind of weedy you know color so\nbut let and in terms of lunch I mean one\nof the things that I love about Europe\nis that the breads are amazing yeah\nbreads are terrific there and I like\nthem because they're not as sweet\nexactly and so a sandwich from not every\nDeli but from a typical sandwich shop or\nthat one makes with store-bought bread\nsliced bread in the US has a lot of\nfructose I looked I looked this up prior\nto to our discussion today so in some\nways dessert is being woven into foods\nthat\nare that parents Andor kids everyone\nthinks our Savory are we're actually\neating sweets exactly right but we can't\nbut we don't taste them as sweet at a\nconscious level necessarily right but\nour but our taste buds do right that's\nexactly right so the question is why do\nthey do that so\nquestion for your audience you buy a\nloaf of bread at the local bakery how\nsoon before it stales two days at best\nyeah if it's really grap bread that's\nright the better the bread the quicker\nit\nstals you buy a loaf of bread at the uh\nNeighborhood Grocery Store how soon\nbefore it stales w you've got probably a\nweek and then there's the moldy pieces\nat the end that you try you know if\nyou're in college and me try and scrape\nthat off um but can last up to 3 weeks\ndepending right you could throw it in\nthe freezer you probably do that with\nthe bakery bread but it's never the same\nnever the same it's never the same so\nthe question is why is that and the\nanswer is\nsugar the answer is sugar so the grocery\nstore bread had sugar added to it on\npurpose because when you bake it the\nsugar does not evaporate it stays in the\nbread and the sugar is hygroscopic\nmeaning it holds holds on to water this\nis a phenomenon that the food industry\nuses called water activity okay and so\nit will hold on to water and so it will\nstay spongy and it will not stale as\nquickly as the bakery store bread which\ndid not have that sugar added to it so\neven something as benign as bread has\nbeen turned into something that\nultimately leads to Chronic metabolic\ndisease we've pivoted somewhat from\ncarbohydrate divided in to GL glucose\nand fructose to a discussion of sugar\ncould you tell us the link between sugar\nand fructose so table sugar what\npercentage of table sugar is fructose\nwhat percentage of brown sugar is\nfructose what percentage of the sugar\nthat's added to food is high fructose\ncorn syrup on average you know just\nbecause here what we're talking about is\num what you're describing as an\nintentional lacing of food with\nsomething that's addictive but that's\nalso processed very differently at the\nlevel of the kidney at the level of the\nliver um right\nand it's bad it's a bad it's a bad\nsituation so when we talk about sugar I\nthink we need to be as careful in\ndescribing what we really mean as when\nwe talk about a calorie I completely\nagree so let for your audience let's be\nvery very clear on definitions okay\nlet's not use the word sugar because it\nhas multiple\ndefinitions let's use\nsucrose sucrose is what you put in your\ncoffee it's the crystals all right it's\ncane sugar Beach\nsugar you know the you know the stuff\nthat teaspoons of right this was all\nthat was available for many many\nyears that is one molecule of\nglucose one molecule of fructose bound\ntogether uh for the chemists out there\nan Oly acidic linkage\nokay the enzyme in your intestine called\nsucra Cleaves this glycosidic linkage in\nabout a nanc you absorb the two\nmolecules separately the glucose goes to\nthe entire body generates an insulin\nresponse the fructose goes straight to\nyour liver generates\nfat that's sucrose high fructose corn\nsyrup is essentially one molecule\nglucose one molecule of fructose not\nbound together no Oly acidic linkage so\nthey're\nfree the enzyme sucra doesn't care\nbecause the blond's already\nbroken ultimately they do the same thing\nand that's why high fructose corn syrup\nand sucrose are indistinguishable\nmetabolically what they are is they're\nvery different economically and the\nreason is because high fructose corn\nserbs half the price of sucrose because\nsucrose we get from importing and high\nfructose corn Sy we make it\nhome sucrose is in bags high fructose\ncorn syrup is in barrels sucrose you can\nsell at the store high fructose corn\nsyrup you sell to the you know ultr\nprocessed food manufacturer you can't\nbuy high fructose corn syrup at the uh\nyou know at the grocery store so they're\nvery different in terms of what they're\nused for high corn syrup is particularly\negregious because it's so missable\nbecause it's already a liquid so you've\nprobably remember chips aoy cookies in\nthe old days okay they would often would\nseem like the sugar in the uh cookie had\ncrystallized cu the sugar content was so\nhigh it's been a while since I've had\none they weren't particularly good yeah\nbut you eat two of them and then you\nthink they're good and then you want to\neat four that's what so odd the first\nbite is kind of like and then it bombs\naway there you go well now it's a chewy\nChips of Hoy cookies oh I remember the\nchew chips remember chewy Chips well\nthat that's high fructose corn syrup\nbecause because the two molecules are\nfree they don't crystallize so you can\nactually up the dose several times\nthroughout today's discussion you've\nbeen talking about the quote unquote\nfood industry mhm okay so I'm not a\nconspiracy theorist I am but I now but I\nunderstand um you know that most\nbusinesses exist to make money yeah many\nbusinesses start off with good\nintentions and drift in order to stay um\nto stay competitive um and many many\nbusinesses as we know um not all of\nwhich are entirely bad such as the\npharmaceutical industry right you\nthey're bad they're instances of like\nthe opioid crisis but then there are\ndrugs from the pharmaceutical industry\nthat help save lives I mean that's my my\nstance um the food industry I think they\nare good actors and there are Bad actors\nbut we're talking about the food\nindustry okay well we talk about the\nexercise industry we talk about the\npodcast industry I mean you got good\nactors and Bad actors but but what\nyou've alluded to several times here and\nyou're more informed than I am is a uh\na concerted effort to lace food with a\nform of sugar that makes people crave\nmore of that food and that is causing\nmetabolic illness disrupting\nmitochondria and on and on exactly and\nyou're the physician not me um you've\nworked with patients who struggle with\nobesity and for various reasons um not\nme and um so we could probably spend\nhours if not days talking about all the\nterrible things that the quote unquote\nfood industry has done but what do you\nthink is the the pure pure motivation\nright I don't think that they want\npeople to be sick but they want to sell\nproduct and this sells more product so\nthen it raises two\nquestions if why is it that more people\ndon't know about know this information\nalthough many more will know after\ntoday's conversation but and certainly\nin government it's it's a mix regardless\nof what side of the aisle you're on or\nif you're right in between they're\nthey're clearly people that care about\nthe health of themselves and others\nso I can understand how things might\nhave gotten to this point but what do\nyou think are the barriers to getting\npeople to appreciate just what a problem\nthis is and and getting people to change\ntheir choices in terms of what they're\neating are they truly addicted to the\npoint where they are sick they can't\nmake good decisions like a like a drug\naddict who's highly addicted to heroin\nis a sick person they have an illness\nand they need treatment but until they\nget that treatment they can't make good\ndecisions let's take an analogy\nalcohol 40% of Americans are tea tolers\nnever touch the stuff 40% don't drink\n40% don't drink great I'm not a big fan\nof alcohol I've never seen it make\nanyone better at anything that really\nmattered no because except drinking and\nmatter completely vestigal there's no uh\nbiochemical reaction in the body that\nrequires alcohol okay for the same\nreason by the way\nfructose um 40% are social drinkers you\nknow you can pick up a beer put it down\nI'm in that category 10% % are binge\nDrinkers and 10% are chronic\nalcoholics okay now do you\ndeprive the 40% of social drinkers\nbecause of the\n20% of binge Drinkers and chronic\nalcoholics no I believe people should be\nin choice but I believe people should\nknow what they are doing so that they\ncan be in Choice well right like do as\nyou I always say uh and I said this\nabout the alcohol episode which turned\nout to be one of our most prolific Epis\nepisodes where I said you know more than\ntwo drinks zero is better than any and\nmore than two drinks per week you need\nto do other things to offset that and\nit's problematic that's what those are\nwhat the data say but I but I would say\ndo as you want but know what you're\ndoing well so I would say that that's\nexactly what the food industry wants you\nto think that's that is the food\nindustry's Mantra is you have your own\nchoice personal\nresponsibility so the question is does\npersonal responsibility work and the\nanswer is no it doesn't\nevery uh Public Health debacle in the\nhistory of mankind started out as a\npersonal health issue before it became a\nPublic Health crisis and you can pick\nyour uh you know personal responsibility\nissue whether it be exposures whether it\nbe addictions whether it be\ninfections bottom line is ultimately it\nrequired a societal response okay we can\ntalk about syphilis we can talk about\ntuberculosis ultimately needed a public\nhealth response we can talk about um uh\nteen pregnancy we can talk about tobacco\ntobacco ultimately needs a public health\nresponse because the sheer enormity of\nit and the uh the egregiousness of it\nrequires that public health response\nWell turns out this is no\ndifferent in order to exercise personal\nresponsibility four criteria have to be\nmet those four criteria are the\nfollowing number one knowledge you have\nto have the knowledge because if you\ndon't have the knowledge then how can\nyou exercise personal responsibility\nwell in fact the Public's being kept\nfrom the knowledge we're doing this now\nin part to in you know to entrain that\nknowledge to to get people to understand\nwhat the problem is yeah I mean I\nconsider myself pretty informed about\nnutrition and health but\nalready today I've learned two dozen\nfacts about processing of fructose and\ncalories generally that I had no\nknowledge of Prior well that's good okay\nbecause it's not about the math it's\nabout the science okay they want it to\nbe about calories so we have this thing\ncalled food science we have this thing\ncalled nutrition and we have this thing\ncalled metabolic Health they are not the\nsame food science is what happens to\nfood between the ground and the mouth\nnutrition is what happens to food\nbetween the mouth and the cell metabolic\nhealth is what happens to food inside\nthe cell but all of the chronic diseases\nthat we are suffering from type two\ndiabetes hypertension dyslipidemia\ncardiovascular disease cancer dementia\nfatty liver disease polycystic ovarian\ndisease those eight diseases which make\nup 75% of healthc care expenditures in\nthis country\ntoday are all inside the cell because\nthey are all mitochondrial dysfunction\nand there is no medicine that gets to\nthe mitochondria although you and others\nat Stanford Harvard Etc are starting\nthis with the metabolic Psychiatry being\none instance righted and UCSF as well\nforgive me I should mentioned UCSF up\nfront your your home institution\nwonderful institution right up the road\nfrom Stanford so you know things are\nchanging people are starting to think\nabout mitochondrial Health they are okay\nso you list off the first the first\nthing and you said there are four things\nthat stand is be first one was knowledge\nokay second access\nbecause if you don't have access then\nhow can you exercise personal\nresponsibility access to healthier\nAlternatives exactly which means cost\neffective I mean I love berries from the\nfarmers market more than I love berries\nfrom the store I love the farmers\nmarkets generally but it takes time\nenergy to go there and the costs are\nactually lower at the level of what you\nhand the vendor typically right but uh\nvolume is tough to achieve right they\nactually have me at a at a quota I'm not\nnot allowed to buy as many berries as I\nwant because obviously there are other\npeople who want berries so there's that\nright people have to feed their family\nthat you know and they want we're used\nto eating a lot of volume but you're\nable to at least go there sometimes okay\nyeah we're talking about people who live\nin quote food deserts we're also talking\nabout people who live in food swamps\nokay when we're talking about food\nswamps we're not talking about an\nplethora of healthy foods we're talking\nabout all the junk that's what they they\nlive in the swamp of junk so\nif you live in the swamp of junk how are\nyou supposed to exercise personal\nresponsibility number three uh or\naffordability so you have to be able to\nafford your choice and Society has to be\nable to afford your choice and right now\nwe can't afford that choice\nbecause health care costs right now are\nat $4.1 trillion a year but like so many\nthings in uh behavioral economics and\nhealth it's so hard for people to see\nthat the the immediate choice is leading\nto a higher cost down the road there\njust too many nodes of separation for\npeople to realize hey when I'm reaching\nfor this cereal as opposed to making\nwaffles for my kids from scratch or you\nknow they're thinking time efficiency\ncost efficiency volume the kids's not\nthrowing Tantrums because they're not no\nlonger getting the cereal and it's a\nvery difficult to see this is the reason\nwhy healthc care costs are going up\nthere just too many nodes of separation\nwouldn't agree more but the ultimately\nit's because the government separates\nand\nsilos um food industry profits from\nhealth care costs if you actually\ncombine those because they ultim are the\nsame you would see the problem so\nglobally the food industry grosses $9\ntrillion a year health care cost\nglobally cost1 trillion a year dietary\nrelated health costs environmental costs\ncost $7 trillion a year and productivity\ncosts cost $1 trillion a year so when\nyou do the math 9 - 11 - 7 -1 means that\nthere is a 10 trillion a year\ndeficit because of us cleaning up the\nmess that the food industry makes and\nwhile numbers like that that's not\naffordable right I agree and while\nnumbers like that land really hard I\nfind that for myself and for many people\nstatistics like that are hard to keep in\nmind in a way there's something about\nthe human brain that hears that and goes\nwhoa we're like that War cost that much\nand this food issue costs that much and\nthen we go to the store and we're hungry\nright and the kids are are are are\nhungry and and you're and so those nodes\nof Separation it's it's almost like a\nneural SL memory SL prefrontal cortex\nissue to me and of course I look at\neverything through the lens of\nneurobiology you know not everything but\nmost everything and so how how could I\nnot how could we not but then like the\nissue is well there's still food on the\nshelves and you know and so it's very\nwhat do we do to connect to bring closer\ntogether these notes what would the\ngovernment do so the question is is\nthere food on the shelves let me finish\nthe fourth one and then I want to come\nback to that point let me just you know\nfinish a concept so affordability and\nnumber four externalities your choice\ncan't hurt anybody else but what if your\nchoice does hurt somebody else so like\nfor tobacco secondhand smoke right for\nalcohol drunk driving what was the\nargument for teen pregnancy that someone\nelse was going to have to raise the kids\nexactly all right but what about for\nfood okay well how about the fact that\nyour employer Stanford University has to\npay\n$2,750 uh per year in obesity related\nhealth care expenses that they have\npassed on to you even though you're not\nobese that is affecting you so that\nguy's obesity right there that is\naffecting you ah but there nowadays it's\nespecially tricky even to have the\nconversation I'm willing to have it now\nwhich is that you know there's this\nwhole concept of fat shaming right so if\nsomebody's obese whose fault is it and\nif we even talk about it is uh are we\nsubject to um attack legitimate attack\nyou know so like so calling something o\no someone obese at a clinical level like\nI mean you're an expert\niny don't talk about obesity let's talk\nabout diabetes okay so talk about\nconsequence of obesity yeah let's talk\nabout the metabolic health issue\nitself okay the fact is that diabetes is\nnow\n11.4% of America what was it 20 years\nago it was 20 years ago it was about 8%\nI was wondering this earlier 20 years\nago there was a lot more margarine in\nrefrigerators but people were thinner\nand there was less diabetes everything\nyou told us about margarine and trans\nfats is that it's bad bad bad now butter\nis back as Time Magazine and you said\nright so clearly can't be the transition\naway from trans fats that's increased\nobesity well no no so it's going to be\nthe increase in sugar and increase in\nsugar and these hidden sugars in exactly\nthat's right all right the the the the\nkey though is Pakistan and India because\nuh and China they are not fat but they\nhave 14% diabetes rates and they're thin\nand the reason is because of ultr\nprocessed food are there any countries\nin the\nworld that don't allow high fructose\ncorn syrup or at least not at the level\nthat that we do oh the fre boats okay\nthere are boatloads of countries that uh\ndon't don't import high fructose corn\nsyrup or don't make it so uh\nScandinavian countries Scandinavian\ncountries most of Europe um the other\nthan the asia-pacific rim so uh Japan\nhas it in fact it was invented in Japan\n1966 Saga medical school\ntakasaki at all um uh Korea has it um\nbut Australia does not have it Thailand\ndoes not have it but they have just as\nmuch of an uh obesity and diabetes\nproblem as we do because they have\nsucrose\nbecause hypose corn syrup and sucrose\nare no different metabolically so it\ndoesn't really matter is that one to one\nit's one to one thing exactly of glucose\nand fructose so here's the question\nAndrew okay so I want to go back to that\nyou said all this food is still on the\nshelves is it food what is the\ndefinition of\nfood can I give the definition I think\nmost people would give that's not\nnecessarily the one I would I would give\nbut um\nsomething that has contains caloric\nenergy right like I I could eat this\nmicrophone um but it's not going to\nprovide much useful energy the\ndefinition of food straight from the\ndictionary and believe me I looked it up\nand memorized it I believe you substrate\nthat contributes to either growth or\nburning of an organism interesting that\nis the definition of food I'm free\nscientific for\n100% correct growth or burning so any\nsubstrate that passes your lips that\ncontributes to either growth or burning\nthat's food okay let's do it let's do\nburning first I just showed you that\nSugar which is the marker of ultra\nprocessed food and 73% of the items in\nthe grocery store are spiked with sugar\ninhibits burning it inhibits those three\nenzymes involved in mitochondrial\nfunction now let's do growth my\ncolleague Dr arrat maneno Oran who is\nwas the chairman of nutrition at Hebrew\nUniversity\nJerusalem actually looked at this\nquestion and showed that Ultra processed\nfood actually inhibits growth it\ninhibits cortical bone growth it\ninhibits uh tricular bone growth it\ninhibits uh cancelous bone growth it\ninhibits linear bone growth it hijacks\ngrowth for cancer because it inhibits\nmitochondria and so you have to then\ngrow instead of burn and this was work\nthat was done in in Vivo or in vitro inv\nVivo inv Vivo so these are people that\nare eating high amounts of Highly\nprocessed food exactly how did he find\nthose in in the in the Middle\nEast they they found in Israel they\nfound it so the bottom line is if a\nsubstrate does not contribute to growth\nand does not contribute to burning is it\na\nfood I the answer is no well that's 73%\nof what's in the grocery store so I\nwould argue you said the food food's\nthere no it's not that's not food in\nfact it's consumable poison so this\nleads to an important question of what's\nleft right you remove all that what's\nleft um just anecdotally and what I\nsometimes call anec Dat um you know I've\nhad several friends in their 40s and\nearly 50s say they wanted to lose weight\nand get in shape and the the thing\nthat's worked every every single time\nfor them to lose significant amounts of\nweight quickly and keep it off and many\nof them were already exercising but then\nalso increase their exercise was I just\nsince I'm not a dietitian nutritionist\nor anything I just say eat meat fish\neggs vegetables fruits you're not going\nto eat starches you're not going to\ndrink alcohol you're not going to drink\nsoda you can still have coffee tea you\ncan still have artificial sweeteners I\nwe go get to artificial sweeters in a\nlittle bit we have to go there but um\nand the reason I say no starches even\nthough I personally eat rice oatmeal\npasta things of that sort some in in\nmoderation depending on on what sort of\nexercise and I'm doing and how much is\nbecause of the fact that nowadays many\nof those things contain fructose and\ninevitably every one of those people is\nblown away by the fact that it quote\nunquote works and assumes that it's all\nbecause of reduced calorie intake\noverall and they lose like anywhere from\n30 to 55 pound and keep it off and they\nlike hey this is great I can actually\nstill eat riye steaks and salads and but\nthey're not eating croutons they're and\nso in some sense it looks extreme it\nsounds ketogenic but it's nothing like\nthat you're just saying basically stay\naway from you're eliminating processed\nfoods you're eliminating liquid calories\nin in general you and on and on and so\nthere's nothing sophisticated about it\nand my question to you is how much of\nthat weight loss effect do you think is\ncalories in versus calories out out\neffect because they're eating a lot of\nfood and in some cases and how much of\nit do you think is the elimination or\nnear elimination of this fructose or\nthis glucose fructose combination it's\nnothing to do with the calories it has\neverything to do with the\ninsulin if you get the insulin down\nyou're not shunting energy to Fat you\ncan lose weight your\nfat will give up\nit the ad the uh the triglyceride stored\nin it as soon as your insulin goes down\ninsulin is pushing on your fat cell all\nthe time and as long as your insulin's\nup your fat cell can't release it the\nminute your insulin goes down you can\nnow engage in what we call lipolysis\nhormone sensitive lipase is a an enzyme\nin the fat cell that is U inhibited by\ninsulin as soon as the insulin's gone\nhormone sensitive lipase can turn that\nstored triglyceride into free fatty\nacids and glycerol and release it and\nyou can lose weight so get the insulin\ndown and it all works so the question is\nwhat makes insulin go up well two things\nrefine carbohydrate and sugar those are\nthe two things that make insulin go up\nin addition Branch chain amino acids\nmake insulin go up as well Lucine\nisoline veine which is in cornfed beef\nchicken and fish processed food all\nright here's here's here's the deal in\none concept my colleague Dr Carlos\nMontero who is a professor of Public\nHealth at the University of sa Paulo has\ndone the world a great service he has\ndeveloped a system for categorization of\nfood processing it is called the Nova\nSystem just means new but he has\nbasically categorized every\nfood anywhere in the world into one of\nfour\nclasses easiest way to explain this\nwould be an example let's take an\napple Nova class one would be an apple\npicked off a tree Nova class two would\nbe apple slices D stem deed deskinned\nmaybe Nova class 3 would be\napplesauce cooked mated possibly at\npreservative added maybe some extra\nsugar maybe not Nova class 4 would be\nMcDonald's apple\npie now does that McDonald's apple pie\nlook anything like that Apple no is\nthere even any Apple in it maybe a tiny\nbit maybe not maybe a tiny bit you know\nit's it's all flavor enhanced Etc okay\nturns out and this is epidemiologic data\nbut nonetheless prospective\nepidemiologic data so it's not\nuseless that Nova class 4 that ultr\nprocessed food category which is 7 3% of\nthe American grocery\nstore is the class that is associated\nwith all of these chronic metabolic\ndiseases Nova class 1 through three no\nproblem now when you say associate what\npercentage of one's daily total caloric\nintake needs to come from Nova class 4\nbefore that statement you just made is\ntrue because it I love the\nrecommendation you made earlier or the\nlet's just say the the Contour of a you\ndon't have to\navoid dessert you can enjoy dessert but\ndon't eat dessert at other times of day\nright and maybe you don't eat dessert\nevery single night right I is there a\nrule that people have to eat dessert\nevery single night so the answer is\nabout 7 to\n10% would be the upper limit so you can\nget 7 to 10% of your caloric intake\ndaily caloric intake from these Nova\nclass 4 foods and still still be okay\nand still be okay yeah so this is I know\nbut that's not what's happening right I\nknow some very healthy Physicians who I\nused to um observe how people ate and\nmoved because I I would pay attention in\nmy in our field right I I was like oh\nyou know people all around me at\nStanford UCSF ET were successful or else\nthey wouldn't be there I was like you\nknow who looks healthy who can make it\nup the stairs and doesn't have to take\nthe elevator how much exercise are\npeople doing at a given age are they\nfanatic you know like four in the\nmorning Runners I'm not going to do that\nconsistently unless I have to um and and\nI observed that you know many of the\nhealthiest people I know they move a lot\nduring the day they ate very well many\nof them skip breakfast or lunch not\nalways and then I also noticed that they\nwould drink very little or no alcohol\nand then but they would enjoy like a uh\nthere's one physician at UCSF in\nparticular I'm thinking of who really\nenjoyed his dark chocolate Kit Kat after\nlunch and he sort of very um ceremonial\nabout the unraveling of that uh the foil\nand you and it was like okay so you're\ntalking about that small percentage of\ncalories if that if that's if that's all\nyou do hey you know God bless you but\nthat's not what people are doing that's\nthe problem bottom line that Nova class\n4 is where all the action is in terms of\nchronic metabolic disease so the\nquestion is how can you avoid that how\ndo you know which is which we have a\nsolution so my colleagues and I have\ndeveloped a web-based tool that is\navailable to the entire world right now\nand you'll put it in your show notes\nyeah we'll put a link to this absolutely\nit's called perfect p r f a and you can\nfind it at perfect.\nCo and what it is is it's a\nrecommendation\nengine not AI we're going to talk about\nAI in a minute but it is a\nrecommendation engine based on the\nscience of human\nmetabolism that categorizes Foods based\non not their nutrients content but on\ntheir Metabolic Effect interesting and\nso there is a Nova filter which will\nfilter out all the Nova class 4 stuff\nand it will go to your grocery\nstore and will tell you what you can buy\nthat will be a Nova class 1 through\nthree which turns out to only be 20% of\nthe grocery store it means basically\nstaying on the periphery of the grocery\nstore right general in general the\nproduce the meat the dairy the all the\nthings\nmentioned in fact so I'm not low carb\nI'm low insulin and there are a lot of\nways to get to low insulin get rid of\nthe refined carbohydrate get rid of the\nsugar increase the fiber get rid of the\nbranch chain amino acids okay so eating\nfish is a good place to be um even\neating a steak is okay if it's a uh\npasture fed steak so let's talk about\nyour steak which is also better for the\nanimals right it is absolutely so you\nmentioned marbling before we love our\nmarbling right we can cut our us grade A\nsteaks with a butter knife because\nthey're so tender right you ever been to\nArgentina yeah my father's argentin oh\nright that's right you're Argentinian\nyeah they only know they only know grass\nF steak the only the idea that that cows\nwould eat anything but grass is sort of\nlike the idea that um fish would would\nwould fly absolutely New Zealand same\nthing yeah okay the meat is gorgeous\nit's homogeneous it's pink it's\ndelightful I've been to Argentina the\nmeat is fantastic but you have to use a\nsteak Knife you can't use a butter knife\nand it takes more chewing it and it\ntakes more chewing because there's senu\nthere you know it's a it's a different\nexperience entirely it's delicious but\nit is kind of a little bit you know\ntougher all right turns out that\nmarbling is intramyocellular\nlipid that animal has metabolic syndrome\nthe American cornfed the American\ncornfed animal because that corn is\nfilled with Branch chain amino acids\nLucine isoline veine Branch chain amino\nacids are what's in protein powder\nthat's what um you know bodybuilders you\nknow put in their smoothies you know to\nbuild muscle and if you're building\nmuscle that's okay because 20% of the\namino acids in muscle are Branch chain\num so you know if you've got a place to\nput them you know have at it yeah\nthere's a need there cuz they're down\nmusle yeah fine but if you're not if\nyou're you know again a mere mortal like\nme you consume those excess branchin\namino acids they're going to go to the\nliver they're going to be deamidated\nlike we talked about earlier and they're\ngoing to end up as Branch chain organic\nacids they're going to flood the\nmitochondria the mitochondria are not\ngoing to be able to deal with the volume\nand so they're going to divert the\nexcess and turn that into fat and so now\nyou've got hyper\ntriglyceridemia and chance for fatty\nliver disease\nand insulin resistance\nso what kind of meat you eat has a lot\nto do with your metabolic Health what\nabout the egg the whole egg near near\nperfect protein score in terms of its um\nuh\nbioavailability um eggs are terrific\nokay there's nothing wrong with eggs now\nthere are better eggs than others so\nthere so well there's yellow uh yolk\neggs and there are orange yolk eggs\nwhat's the difference between a yellow\nOak egg and an orange Oak egg I'm\nguessing that something about the uh the\nfeed of the the mother chicken um and\nI'm guessing it probably also has\nsomething to do with choline content\nOmega-3s ah interesting okay the orange\nuh yolk egg has a lot of Omega-3s in it\nwhat are other great sources of Omega-3s\nI I I know some off the top of my head\nbut I'd like to hear it from you okay so\nmarine life is number number one okay um\nyou know fish provided you're not\nbringing in heavy metals with it well\nyes so I mean that's always the the the\nargument you know the question is you\nknow is it the Mercury or is it the\nOmega-3s ultimately I think it's the\nOmega-3s that is more important but yes\nI do understand the Mercury issue um uh\nultimately there are three Omega-3s\nthere's ala alpha linolenic acid which\nyou can get in vegetables there is EPA\neicosapentanoic acid which you can only\nget in marine life fish oil cod liver\noil right and finally DHA dooh heex\nenoic acid which you also get from\nmarine life but you can get from algae\nso you can get algal oil which you know\nthe vegans will use do you um personally\ntake anything to increase your omega-3\nintake I I know that there's even\nprescription Omega-3s I take fish oil\nyou take a fish o yeah uh the the thres\nI only take three I only take three\nsupplements okay I'd like to know what\nthose are I will say that I always\nalways always say behaviors first right\ndos and don'ts behaviors\nnutrition then only if needed and one\ncan afford it then supplementation and\nprescription drugs and I'm a big\nconsumer of supplements and always have\nbeen frankly so what are the three so\nyou take fish oil fish oil and do you\ntake to get above a certain threshold of\nEPA about a th000 milligrams say about a\ngram a day OFA okay uh vitamin C how\nmuch vitamin C do you a th000 milligrams\na day you line is Pauling yeah well it's\nactually for my rosacea I've got the um\nskin issue and vitamin C helps with\nhelps with that interesting and finally\nvitamin D now I will tell you vitamin D\nis a complicated one all right uh let\nand we can talk about vitamin D and how\neither important or non-important it is\nbecause there's a there's a quirk to\nvitamin D and uh uh it it's important\nfor your audience to know about it\nbecause everybody in his brother's you\nknow touting vitamin D a cure for\neverything it's sort of funny because\nthat you have your supplement lovers\nhaters and agnostics but vitamin D\nsomehow made it through the shoot like\neveryone's like Pro vitamin D it's\nreally interesting somehow vitamin D\npeople are comfortable taking a gel a\nvitamin D gel cap but like other\nsupplements where you say oh like maybe\num this might be good for uh you know\nlike Omega-3s and fish them people are a\nlittle bit like more standoff it's\nreally interesting that the kind of\npsychos social stuff around this how\nmuch vitamin D do you personally take I\ntake 5,000 units a day okay so do I\nvitamin D is complicated though here's\nthe problem if you look at the\nliterature vitamin D deficiency is\nassociated with all these chronic\nmetabolic\ndiseases however\nsupplementation with vitamin D has not\nfixed any of\nthose so so if you're vitamin D\ndeficient why wouldn't supplementation\nfix\nit couple of reasons one one of the\nreasons for vitamin D deficiency is\nbecause everyone's drinking soft drinks\nthat's one reason but there's a more\nimportant reason uh sugar and\nartificially sweetened soft drinks yeah\ncan deplete vitamin D utiliz well you're\nnot consuming Dairy because you're\nconsuming soft drinks but I can't\ntolerate milk anymore well then you take\nvitamin D but here's the here's the real\nnugget of Truth and this is a little\ncomplicated but the endocrinologists and\nthe audience will get\nit vitamin D is a pre-pro hormone it's\nnot it's not active at all vitamin D is\nconverted in the liver first step to a\ncompound called 25 hydroxy vitamin D\nthat is a pro hormone it also is\ninactive it has no activity whatsoever\nfrom there 25 hydroxy vitamin D can be\nmetabolized one of two\nways it can either be one alpha\nhydroxylated in the kidney to the active\nform one Alpha One 25 dihydroxy vitamin\nD which will then do all of the business\nof vitamin D such as calcium absorption\nfrom the gut suppression of the immune\nsystem at the toll like receptor 4 that\nsounds like a bad thing no that's a good\nthing I know but I had to bring that up\nbecause when you say suppression of the\nimmune system people go I'm\nimmunosuppressed nobody that sounds like\nAIDS a good it suppresses inflammation\ngot it it's a good thing okay\nsuppression of inflammation and that's\nactually the point that we're we're\ngetting to so there are a lot of good\nthings about 125 dihydroxy vitamin\nD however that 25 hydroxy D that came\nout of the liver can be metabolized a\ndifferent way it can be 20 for\nhydroxy in inflammatory\ntissue like tuberculosis\nsarcoid gut\ninflammation and so you will end up\ntaking your 25 hydroxy D which is a pro\nhormone and turning it into the inactive\n2425 dihydroxy D which then just gets\nexcreted out so in other words you\nconsumed all this vitamin D and it\ndidn't go where you needed it to go and\nthe reason was because you're\ninflamed you have to fix the\ninflammation before the vitamin D can be\neffective and 93% of Americans are\ninflamed so giving them vitamin D is not\ngoing to do a damn thing got it is\nreducing fructose intake the one of the\nprimary ways to reduce systemic\ninflammation absolutely what are some\nothers reducing oxidative stress in\ngeneral so heavy metals like cadmium you\nknow cadmium is very high in chocolate\nespecially South American chocolate\nsorry no I I'm not a fan of chocolate I\noccasionally like a little dark\nchocolate but okay but um so if people\nare going to eat chocolate they should\nbe careful how much chocolate they eat\nwell especially if it's South American\nchocolate and processed chocolate I mean\nthe really good we're going to be on the\nhit list of so many Industries after\nthis episode comes out all I can tell\nyou is I've been on the hit list for a\ndecade and I'm still here you're you're\njust one big Target yeah right got it I\ngot to I it's my back you know kick me I\nalready got that um uh there are uh uh\nthe main thing is to make that gut work\nright so fiber short chain fatty acid\nproduction from fiber uh is a huge you\nknow uh Boon and reduce inflammation to\nreduce inflammation how about improving\nsleep is there any evidence that you\nknow chronic slight sleep deprivation\ncan increase inflammation well what it\nwill do is it'll increase cortisol and\nchronically increased cortisol will\ndefinitely lead to increased\ninflammation you know which is funny\nbecause cortisols usually considered the\nanti-inflammatory but only acutely right\nchronic cortisol elevation does the\nopposite if if we can contribute to I\nhave this secret uh agenda which is not\nwhich is not a secret which is that\npeople think cortisol is bad when in\nfact acutely cortisol does wonderful\nthings provided it's happening at the\nright time of day right late shifted\ncortisol bad right too much or too\nfrequent cortisol bad but cortisol you\nyou need it it's so essential and I\nthink most people just hear cortisol and\nit's been associated with all things bad\nand and maybe we can help shift that\nnarrative yeah I'm I'm very happy I mean\nas an endocrinologist you know this is\nyou know this my wheelhouse is where I\nlive um cortisol is a good news bad news\ndeal like so many things shortterm gain\nfor long-term pain okay so when you are\nin what we call\nallostasis that is perturbation of\nhomeostasis that is a stress an acute\nstress cortisol is one of the things\nthat helps you manage that bodily and\nmental stress so an English\ntest a car accident running away from\nthe lion you know the famous you know\npyg me running away from the lion all of\nthose require cortisol in in order to\nmanage and mitigate that stress the\nupcoming 2024 election that's chronic\nstress that is not acute stress mean to\nthat's the worst that'll be the only\nmention of Politics on this podcast uh\nand we don't have to go there but we're\nall chronically stressed and we can talk\nabout why that is and what's going on\nand I'm actually very interested in that\nand a colleague of mine in Paris and I\nhave built a computational model of the\nlyic system which focuses on the stress\ncenter of the brain the amydala to\nunderstand how chronic stress is\ndifferent from acute stress and how that\nchronic stress ultimately leads to\nmetabolic and mental health disaster\nvery interested in learning more about\nthat before we touch on that you've\nworked a lot with kids MH um people age\nas you put it 0 to\n19 I don't know about\nthe exact numbers but when I was growing\nup there were some kids in school that\nwere overweight but it was the\noccasional kid right now it seems\ndepending on where one draws the\nthreshold for overweight it seems that\nthere are a lot of kids that are\noverweight um how about 25%\nobese and 40% overweight okay so\nobviously a serious problem Ser now and\ngoing forward what about adults in the\nUS um I remember seeing at a meeting a\nmap of obesity in the US and um over\ntime and it very quickly filled in from\nvery few people were obese to very many\nColorado was this um was this like like\nBeacon of of of fit people but now it's\nno longer and that's too oh\nokay cool I'll tell you why there there\nare four things that can increase\nmitochondrial uh uh uh biogenesis are\nyou going to tell me altitude is one\ncold yeah that's why Colorado is less\nobese altitude that's why Colorado is\nless obese\nand um uh what were the other two I for\nbut those were the reason it had nothing\nto do with being more fit it had to do\nwith cold and altitude example\nSwitzerland compared to Germany they got\nthe same crappy food but Switzerland has\nhalf the Obesity that Germany does\nbecause Switzerland is higher oh I love\nthe food when I go to Munich I love the\nSchnitzel and wonder sourkrauts and they\ngot that in Switzerland too okay so they\nhave great food Switzerland's less obese\nright same way Colorado is less obese\nit's because of the altitude you you\nmentioned cold U many listeners of this\npodcast are at least interested in some\nuh also practice deliberate cold\nexposure cold showers cold plunges\nmainly for the um I think the best data\nare the increases in catac colam Mees\nepinephrine norepinephrine dopamine that\nare long- lasting people feel a big\nstate shift they feel better yeah but\nwhen one looks at the effects on\nmetabolism they're pretty slight they\nare they're slight however studies like\nthat to me always seem um shortsighted\nin the sense that if there's a longer\nArc of effect on the mitochondria that's\naffecting other things in terms of how\ncalories are\nprocessed or how calories are feeding\ninto mitochondrial function or\ndysfunction there I could see how it\nmight shift the um shift the scal so to\nspeak I mean cold is is an amazingly\npowerful stimulus it and um I think of\nlight cold food movement it's kind of\nlike the core four ways in which you can\nshift physiology easily all of these\nthings are eminently manipulable and for\nalmost zero dollars okay but you have to\nknow what you're doing and right now\nwe've been actually kept from that\nknowledge and you know if you're\naddicted it's really hard to un addict\nyourself so that brings us back to this\nthing about\num food industry conspiracies government\nconspiracy and the rest boy this is\ngoing to be an interesting um we can go\nuh section\nbut what do we do like so if you and I\ngo up to cap capitol hill which I've\ndone yeah which you've done and and\nmaybe I'll join you someday\num and you know you're UCSF I'm down at\nStanford you're a clinician I'm a\nscientist and and a public health\nAdvocate um podcaster right and we\nexplain to people Hey listen like\nthere's the food is laced with a drug\nit's it's it's not even really food it's\nnot it's an aggregate of food and non-f\nfood parts that make you think it's food\nit's sort of like telling people hey\nyour kids are you know they're swimming\nin a swimming pool looks like water but\nit's actually part poison and it's and\nit's harming them it's giving them you\nknow if you say those kinds of things I\nmean congressmen and women are they're\nlike reasonably smart people right I\nmean AR aren't they going to do\nsomething about it no so where is the\nconflict is it that the food industry\nhas um the government by the short hairs\nthat's exactly right and they have them\nby the short hairs where I mean is it\nare they lining their pockets I mean\nwhere where where is The Leverage ACC\nactually exerted okay so they're they\nare lining their pockets that's number\none that is absolutely true we have the\ndata to support that blanch Lincoln who\nwas a senator from Arkansas who was the\nchairman of the nutrition committee you\nhad to see her campaign contributions\nevery time she was up for re-election so\nit's all about getting reelected or it's\nabout them like having a like a third\nhome in the Hamptons so I think it's the\nthird home in the\nmore than anything wow okay so it's\nreally as bad as as as some of the\ndocumentaries make us believe without\nquestion goodness and we and we and we\nhave the data there is a uh uh an\norganization that I absolutely want to\ncall out because they are you know the\nmost egregious organ you political\norganization on the face of the Earth\nthey're called the American legislative\nexchange Council Alec or alic and they\nwrite bills they are a bill Mill okay\nand they for whoever gives them money\nand who gives them money big Pharma big\nAgra big oil and uh big food and you're\nso you're including big Pharma you're a\nphysician you've written scripts before\nyou've written prescriptions for\npatients before isn't that Pharma that\nprovides the drugs that allows your\npatients to feel better well the\nquestion is do they do they feel better\nthis is a big question let's you want to\ngo you're writing but you're writing the\nscript I mean I mean I'm just trying I'm\nnot trying to try to challenge you but I\nsee so so you don't uh there have to be\ninstances where someone's thyroid\ndeficient and you give them you know a\ndrug AB so if so if if you've got a\ndisease and a medicine will replace\nwhat's missing sure okay so for\ndeficiency diseases which as an\nendocrinologist that's what I do\nabsolutely and I did that you know with\nno compunction of uh of impropriety\nwhatsoever but that's not what we're\ntalking about here let's talk about\nwe're really talking about let's start\nwith\nstattin Statin lower\nLDL okay does statins reduce heart\ndisease yes or\nno you know I seem to be whiffing today\non all the quizzes and it's kind of\nbecoming fun for me at this level I'm\ngoing to go with no but but I will say\nyou know my friend and I think his\nexpert uh physician as well you know\nPeter AA and others you know has talked\nabout some of the positive attributes of\nstatens in certain cases for certain\nPati in certain cases that's exactly\nright and I completely agree and by the\nway Peter's a friend and you know we\nsomeday we'll we'll you know all you\nknow go out drinking together well I\nwon't drink but how about we share a\nsteak share a absolutely you got it you\nguys I don't I don't know if he drink he\ndrinks a little bit if if you're\nlistening okay he drinks a little bit\nhouse on me yeah I don't do the dessert\nor the or the alcohol anymore but but\nI'm and it's not so I can live to be 120\nit's so I can wake up the next morning\nand and uh keep up with you guys it's\nfine I get the so for primary prevention\nthat is your LDL is high you need a\nStatin that's primary prevention you\nhaven't declared yourself you haven't\nhad an event for primary prevention the\nmean increase in lifespan for being on a\nStatin is four days four days four days\nfour days so to chuckle that's that's uh\nand the risk for\ndiabetes is 20% increase what about any\nImprovement in in quality of life none\nfor primary prevention now for secondary\nprevention for secondary in other words\nyou've already declared yourself you\nalready have a problem for secondary\nprevention that's where Statin shine so\nthere's a value to them I'm not arguing\nthat and if you have familial hyper\ncholesterolemia which is one in 500 okay\nnot do you need a Statin but you need a\nlowfat diet and a\npriest okay so there is definitely a\nvalue to stattin but not for primary\nprevention but that's what everybody\nwhat every doctor is doing oh your LDL\nit's over 80 you know you need a Statin\nthat's ridiculous that is absolutely a\njoke and the data show that in fact in\nfact my colleague aim Malhotra in the UK\nparticipated in an analysis where they\ntook the entire UK\npopulation and they took out everybody\nunder age 65 so you're looking at people\n65 to 90 and it turned out that the LDL\nlevel correlated with longevity the\nhigher the LDL the longer they lived\nwhen you took out all the people who had\nproblems so LDL is not really the\nproblem and the reason is because there\nare two ldls there's one called large\nbuoyant there's one called small dents\nturns out dietary fat raises your large\nbuoyant your large buoyant is\nirrelevant it is\ncardiovascularly neutral but that's the\none that statins\neffects the small dense that's the\natherogenic particle when your small\ndense LDL is high that means you are not\nclearing triglyceride peripherally\nbecause that's what small dense show you\nthat's that that's what happens to\ntriglyceride is become they become small\ndense can I take a guess and say that\nthe best way to reduce small dens is to\nreduce insulin yes by reducing\nsugar because that triglyceride is made\nin the liver it's all palmitate and\nthat's the only fat that the liver knows\nhow to make and so triglyceride is your\nliver output of\ncarbohydrate that's how you have to look\nat triglyceride so triglyceride turns\nout to be much more important as a\ncardiovascular risk factor than LDL ever\nwas so does the does big Pharma and big\nfood do they know all of this yes I know\nthey know because they've told me so and\nbut they have statins to\nsell and Foods in the uh the Nova class\n4 mhm they know this too so you know I'm\nan optimist or you know what what's it\ngoing to take to really move the needle\nI mean you described the four barriers\num we're trying to add to the knowledge\ncomponent now um you know what's it\ngoing to take is it going to take uh you\nknow having a president in office or a\ncongress people in office that really\nunderstand and care about this\nstuff yeah I mean to really revamp the\nwhole system yeah so right now the\nsystem is completely and utterly broken\ncompletely and utterly broken and\nthere's a reason why it's completely and\nutterly broken because the food industry\nlikes it that way\nwell it's profitable for them obviously\nthere are 51 different federal agencies\nthat manage our food 51 and none of them\nknow what the other one's\ndoing and the food industry likes it\nthat way so communication across these\n51 organizations would help well if we\nhad a centralized food um zor or food uh\nyou know if we split the food off the\nFDA because you you know it's like it's\nnot the FDA it's the da or the FDA is\nnot the Food and Drug Administration\nit's the Federal Drug Administration\nthey spend a lot of time on drugs they\nspend almost no time on food well let's\nthink about where there's been success\nso I can recall when people smoked on\nplanes I actually recall going to a gym\nin Europe and there was an ashtray\nmolded into the squat rack yep that was\ntelling yeah I don't see people smoking\ncigarettes around Stanford Hospital\nanymore but I remember they initially\nsaid that people couldn't smoke anywhere\nexcept in this one little designated\narea right and that's typically what you\nsee nowadays and my understanding of the\nanti-smoking campaign at least for kids\nfor people 18 and younger was that\ntelling people it was bad for their\nhealth didn't work showing them lungs\nthat were decrepit didn't work what\nworked was showing them commercials of\ncackling handw ring um white guys who\nwere talking about how much money they\nwere making off of these um uh naive\nkids who were buying cigarettes and\nother tobacco products so it became a\nthe the effective campaign to end\nsmoking in young people was to hijack\ntheir re inherent rebelliousness of\nYouth and then they were like no we're\nnot going to stick it to them like give\nyou know the the as my friend calls it\nlike the two the two-finger business\ncard like No And so that worked that\nworked vaping is making a comeback we\nvaping is a separate episode we won't\nget into that but because nicotine is\nstill addictive but you don't see a lot\nof people smoking cigarettes so it\nworked like something that you would\nnever imagine could ever work worked\nwell so yes no I mean that's part of it\nI'm not going to tell you that it's not\nit is part of it um and we actually have\nan example of how that could be applied\nto another uh uh uh toxic substance\nsugar we had Berkeley versus big soda\nyou know that's how Berkeley ended up\nwith its soda tax that dates back to\n2015 the city of Berkeley city of\nBerkeley it we just celebrated the\n5-year anniversary of the Berkeley soda\ntax and we've been able to actually\nlook just stational diabetes way down\nobesity down slightly not a lot but a\nlittle bit um cardiovascular disease\ndown Dean Schillinger and Chris Madson\nat UCSF and UC Berkeley just presented\nat San Francisco General just um three\nweeks ago so a soda tax like the\ncigarette tax just makes soda expensive\nexactly so you're telling me that a can\nof\nCoke that I buy on shatak Avenue in\nBerkeley costs more than a can of Coke\nthat I buy in on University Avenue in\npal Alto it does huh okay by by a dime\nand that was and sufficient enough to to\ncreate this kind of change well yes it\nis money hurts because money hurts\nexactly so\nAndrew there have been four count them\nfour cultural tectonic shifts in America\nin the last 30 years and they're all\nundeniable here they are number one\nbicycle helmets and seat bels oh yeah\neverybody uses those two smoking in\npublic places Nobody Does that three uh\ndrunk driving hopefully fewer people are\ndoing that four condoms and bathrooms\ncondoms in bathrooms in bathrooms in\npublic bathrooms yeah you see those more\navailable okay yeah all right 30 years\nago if a legislator stood up in a state\nhouse and proposed legislation for any\none of those four and I don't care if\nit's an a state house or in Congress or\nin Parliament or in the Duma or anywhere\nelse in the world okay they have gotten\nlaughed right out of town Nanny state\nliberty interest get out of my kitchen\nget out of my bathroom get out of my car\nokay today they're all facts of\nlife right nobody's belly aching about\nany of those the point is we were able\nto solve those\nfor public health debacles how did we do\nit how did we solve those four no one\ncould imagine that we would ever solve\nsmoking right but we did sort of I mean\nwe brought consumption down by half okay\nthat's pretty good when you think about\nfor an addictive sub how many fewer\npeople are dying of lung cancer nowadays\nin the US um it's like 80% lower wow\nwell there's also been improvements in\ntreatment but yeah but no but it's it's\nthe in diagnosed with in inci incidence\ngone down amazing okay because tobacco's\ngone down so the question is how did\nthat happen the answer is very and why\ndid it take 30 years to do it we taught\nthe children the children grew up and\nthey\nvoted and the\nnaysayers are\ndead that's how you make a cultural\ntectonic\nshift\nso we now have this real food Movement\nwe have people who are arguing against\nUltra processed food we have kids who\nare demanding different in their schools\nand by the way what is the biggest fast\nfood\nfranchise in the United States I'm going\nto get this wrong so try me again I\ndon't know I've never tried it but I've\nheard of uh is it\nChick-fil-A nope is it McDonald I don't\nknow it is this nation's Public Schools\nah you can add up McDonald's Subway\nBurger King\nchickfila and uh Wendy's and every other\nuh fast food franchise Jack in the Box\nevery fast food franchise in the entire\ncountry and would only be\nhalf our nation's Public Schools wow so\ncould you imagine a world where there\nwere no class three or class four Nova\nFoods allowed in uh in public schools\nand we're doing it so I am the chief\nscience officer of a nonprofit and put\nthis in the show notes called Eat Real\ne.org and we have a new business model\npropos Public\nSchools so in\n1971 the Department of Education issued\nan administrative ordinance called\nresolution\n242 and they did this purely on monetary\nis reasons this was under Nixon and what\nthis resolution 242 said was that all\nSchool\ncafeterias all throughout the country\nhad to make\nbook they had to basically cover their\ncosts they couldn't be lost leaders for\nthe school they had to fend for\nthemselves well this sent every food\nservice director in the country\nscurrying for you know how am I going to\ndo this because I got all these you know\nuh you know Lunch Ladies you know which\nyou know personnel and and food\npreparation equipment and and and costs\nyou know that they're you know mounting\nhow am I going\nto break even they couldn't do it so in\nwalks\nyou know aramar and Cisco and uh\nGuggenheim and McDonald's and they say\nhey we'll do it for you we'll provide\nevery kid in America with a nutritious\nmeal Every Single Day hot lunch well\nthey didn't say hot okay they just said\nlunch okay nutritious they said\nnutritious and I put that in air quotes\ntoo because it wasn't\nnutritious and here's the added benefit\nyou can take your food preparation fac\nfacilities and your um uh footprint in\nthe school and you can turn that into\nclassrooms cuz you're going to need them\nand that was the goal because as soon as\nyou've moved the food preparation\nfacilities out of the school you are now\nHostage to the food industry for the\nrest of your life uh and I could also\nsee how that allows room for them to use\nthese commoditized Foods foods that have\nvery long shelf life exactly right\nbecause you want to make sure that you\nknow if you only sold um you know 2third\nof the lunch that were prepared that on\nnext Tuesday after the weekend you could\nstill give them food that isn't moldy\nexactly right and I will tell you so\nthat's how it happened and you can\nactually Trace IQ scores and reading and\nmath scores in this country down from\n1971 to\ntoday when I went to school I was\nallowed to get I called it hot lunch\nbecause it was usually hot it was um\nallowed to get the school lunch one day\na week one day a week the other days I\nhad to bring my lunch MH that one day\nwas pretty special like you felt like\nyou were getting a treat it was usually\nlike corn dog or a hamburger the\nhamburger was pretty poultry but the um\nit's a commoditized hamburger yeah\ncommoditized hamburger um you had to go\nlooking for the Patty portion um and the\nbread was sweetened and so it was\ndifferent right but um I don't remember\nnearly as much obesity I went to to high\nschool in the early 90s MH um so you're\nsaying that now if I went to a high\nschool it would be a lot more sodas and\ndonuts and pizza and got it yeah Pizza\nis a vegetable didn't you know they\nclaim it's a vegetable Congress said\nPizza is a vegetable Amy kashar made\npizza a vegetable maybe they need their\neyes check because the biggest frozen\npizza uh uh uh producer is in Minnesota\nI mean the ketchup is a vegetable was\nwas a was a stretch but at least it it\nmade sense on the Nova System of going\nfrom tomato all the way to uh to uh\nketchup since high fructose corn syrup\nis the primary ingredient in ketchup\nindeed so the point is that our kids are\nsuffering under the weight the burden of\nthis chronic disaster of ultra processed\nfood which is not food and no wonder\nthey're all obese and uh um uh sick and\num uh you know doing so poorly in school\nand by the way also depressed ultr\nprocessed food has now been shown in\nthree separate studies to correlate with\ndepression in teenagers so what is the\nrelationship between processed food or\nmaybe we call it Nova System level 34\nfoods and depression and other\npsychiatric challenges and if you could\nyou separate out metabolic syndrome from\nobesity um in answering that like like\nis there something inherently depressing\nabout carrying excess adapost tissue as\nsetting aside any kind of aesthetic um\nuh stuff you know how people want to\nlook or are perceived you know just is\nthere anything bad about carrying a lot\nof body fat independent of the metabolic\nsyndrome for mood and an overall sense\nof well-being no I'm really glad you\nasked that Andrew we should have\nactually covered this earlier um\neveryone thinks fat is fat as we've\nlearned fat is not fat and a fat is not\na fat but um body fat is not body fat\nthere are three fat Depot and they are\nmetabolically different the first is the\ndoes this bathing suit make me look fat\nfat by the way never answer that\nquestion that's called subcutaneous fat\nor big butt fat if you will so here's\nthe question how many pounds or kilos of\nsubcutaneous fat do you have to gain\nbefore you become metabolically ill I\nhave no idea about 10 kilos about 22 lbs\nokay why the reason is because that\nsubcutaneous fat drains into the\nsystemic\ncirculation so you have to have a lot of\ncyto kindes coming from those\nsubcutaneous atopos sites to raise the\nblood level of cyto kindes to the point\nwhere it starts doing damage at the\nlevel of the liver so fats are releasing\ncytoid which are pro-inflammatory\nexactly and they're doing that at rest\nany fat cell any fat cell okay any fat\ncell but if it's going to the systemic\ncirculation you have a volume of\ndistribution of six liters so you have\nto lose you know you have to have a lot\nof cyto kindes to get the concentration\nup now just out of fairness to the\nfat how many cyto kindes does a muscle\ncell release I mean are are we unfairly\npicking on adapost tissue because why\nwould adapost tissue be pro-inflammatory\nI mean a single fat\ncell I've got a fat cell sitting at you\nknow on my shoulder someplace right I\nmean I'm not zero fat at my shoulder why\nwould it be pro-inflammatory so in fact\nthe fat cell itself is not here's what\nhappens the fat cell has a fat vacu it\nhas a storage place for this lipid\ndroplet you stuff it you stuff it you\nstuff it the fat vacu gets bigger bigger\nbigger the perpen border that\nencompasses that fat vacu that it\nborders the the the the space ultimately\ncan't get any bigger and it starts\nbreaking down when that happens it\nspills the grease into the fat cell the\nfat cell\ndies becomes necrotic that calls macras\nis in to clean up the grease and it's\nthe\nmacras that release the cyto kindes all\nright so in fact the fat cell is not the\nproblem it's the breakdown of the grease\nthat lead leads to the maccrage\nactivation that's the problem but when\nyou do it in subcutaneous fat it's going\ninto this 6 L tank and so the\nconcentration doesn't go up very much\nso 10 kilos before you start seeing some\neffect fat Depot number\ntwo visceral or big belly\nfat now how many pounds or kilos of big\nbelly fat you have to gain before you\nget metabolically ill I don't know but\nI'm guessing it's less than 22 pounds\nit's way less oh for once I got an\nanswer right today that's right about\nfive about five pounds\nnow question is why number one the\nvisceral fat does not drain into the\ninto the systemic circulation it drains\ninto the portal vein which goes straight\nto the liver so you're getting a bigger\nload going straight to the liver of cyto\nkindes not to the kidney the good thing\nabout getting an answer wrong folks is\nthat you never forget the correct answer\nthat's why I always tell my students\nright so I'll never forget that indeed\ngot it and the question is what made the\nvisceral fat in the first place was it\ncalories no it's cortisol it's stress\nit's the combination of the sympathetic\nnervous system and cortisol and the\nreason we know this is because you can\ntake patients with major depressive\ndisorder with endogenous depression who\nare suicidal who have to be admitted to\nthe hospital to keep themselves from\nkilling themselves stick them in a\nscanner and they are losing subcutaneous\nfat like crazy because they're not\neating but they're gaining visceral fat\nbecause of the high cortisol and the\nstress so there's something about the\nadrenocorticoid receptors in that area\nthat just preferentially Depot fat there\nwhen cortisol is high indeed because\nthat's the metabolically active\nfat right and five pounds will do it and\nthen finally the third fat Depot the\nliver now how many pounds of fat can the\nliver store\nbefore you become metabolically\nill got to be even less because the\nliver is not nearly as large as the sort\nof abdominal region half a pound quarter\nof a kilo how much does a healthy liver\nweigh healthy liver weighs 1500\ngrams okay okay so you know it's not\nvery I'm trying to translate quickly to\npound so we're going Metro we're going a\nstandard so, 1500 G would be 3 lb so you\nknow basically half a pound okay so not\nvery\nmuch because that's where the action is\nand so when you have fat in your liver\nit causes metabolic dysfunction right\naway and the question is where did that\nfat come from that came from alcohol or\nsugar so alcohol and sugar most\nmetabolically egregious because it\naffects the liver directly\nstress second most because it affects\nthe visceral fat and subcutaneous fat\nthe least important in terms of\nmetabolic derangement so yes it may not\nlook good in the bathing suit but from a\nmetabolic standpoint it is actually the\nleast important so the question then\nbecomes all right what are you trying to\nfix if you're trying to fix liver fat\nit's really easy get rid of the alcohol\nin the sugar except of course they're\nboth addictive will that also liberate\nany fat that's already in the liver\nabsolutely and that's one of the reasons\nwhy intermittent fasting works is\nbecause it gives your liver a chance to\nbasically\noffload what it's already stored that's\none of the things that intermittent\nfasting will buy you is a little e uh\nless liver fat so that's a good thing\nall right now stress on the other hand\nas you know and as we've talked about\nand as you know you've had um Dr Lissa\napple on your podcast before you know\nstress is tough you know trying to\nmitigate stress especially in today's\nenvironment and I hope you'll invite me\nback sometime to talk about the the role\nof stress on um the amydala yeah gladly\nokay um and then finally you know\nsubcutaneous fat so when people go on\ndiet\nsweeteners what are they doing are they\nreally\nreducing the fat and the answer is no\nwhen you're talking about artificial\nsweeteners artificial diet sweeteners of\nany sort you can pick your artificial\nsweetener so a spart tame or you know uh\nsuc sucos Stevia monk fruit uh um the\nnew ones you know yeah the one that\npeople are more excited about nowadays\nis alos Al it's expensive it tends to\nhave less of an artificial sweetener\ntaste that people can detect right um so\nyou're saying that regardless of oh and\nwe should I'm remembering from the\ncomment section I do read them\nartificial sweeteners and\nnoncaloric sweeteners yes because the\nmoment you say artificial people say\nwhat about Stevia what about Alo so so\nlet's just say um uh non-caloric\nsweeteners can wrap our arms around all\nthat entire category sure unless we need\nto distinguish among the different\nparticipants in that category so you're\nsaying that even though people can um\nlower their total choric intake pretty\neffectively I've seen the studies that\nshow if you know dieters who consume um\nwater only as their you know main liquid\nversus diet sodas with aspartame\ntypically or Stevia the diet soda\ndrinkers actually lose more weight we\nknow that but you're saying there may be\ndeposition of fat in the liver in those\nindividuals be specifically because of\nthe artificial sweetening because of the\ninsulin turns out there's still an\ninsulin response it's a fa very famous\nstudy done in um Copenhagen 100 normal\nindividuals 25 in four different groups\none\ngroup uh one uh one liter of sugared\nsoda per day for six months one liter\nthat's a lot of sugared soda yeah one\ngroup one liter of diet soda per day for\nsix months I probably did that in\ngraduate school one group one liter of\nmilk per day for 6 months I probably did\nthat when I was an infant and finally\none final group one liter of water per\nday for six months I do that now I do\nmore than that but yeah the one liter of\nsoda per day in six months gained 10\nkilos the sugary soda the sugary soda 10\nkilos okay 10 kilos no surprise the one\nliter of water per day lost two kilos\nalso no surprise those were the easy\nones now let's do the ones in the middle\none liter of milk per\nday no change presumably that was full\nfat milk we're talking about milk full\nfat milk yeah they like their their full\nfat milk no change why is that they're\ntaking on an enormous increase in total\ncaloric intake I'm guessing that there\nis a blunted insulin response due to the\nfat and the milk and also because\nlactose is not a very uh uh Big Driver\nof insulin response and because there's\na satiety effect that's like f eat less\nyeah it's like food like\nfood and finally the key the kicker to\nthe whole thing diet soda the one liter\nof dioda what what would you predict\ntheir weight would do more weight loss\nthan in the water group based on my\nunderstanding of the literature they\ngained two kilos wild because they ate\nmore\nwell you tell\nme why did they gain two kilos if they\nwere consuming a liter of Da soda which\nare zero calories the answer is because\nthey still generated an insulin response\nand that insulin response generated more\nhunger more more weight and more hunger\nexactly and that's the key so they\ndidn't gain the 10 kilos they gained two\nkilos so it looks better compared to the\nsugared uh uh version but it looks like\nyou know a problem compared to the water\nversion or even the milk version so\nunless you bootstrap calories and hold\nthat constant you're going to see a\nweight gain due to artificial sweetener\nin exactly right and that's been shown\n50 ways from Sunday at a whole bunch of\ndifferent studies so compared to Sugar\nyeah it's better but compared to water\nit's way worse and the reason is the\ninsulin response you put something sweet\non the tongue message goes tongue to\nbrain Sugar's coming message goes brain\nto pancreas through the vus nerve\nSugar's coming release the insulin and\nso tongue doesn't know if it's sugar or\nnot it releases the in the pancreas\nreleases the insulin which drives energy\ninto fat whether it was you know from\nthe uh diet sweetener or not I I saw\nsome really interesting data from Dana\nSmall's group at Yale showing that when\npeople have a diet soda with food so\nthis is like the diet coke with the\nsandwich or with the burger maybe even\nwith the pasta the insulin resp response\nfrom the food and the insulin response\nfrom the diet soda are compounded but\nthere's a classical conditioning effect\npavlovian effect such that then later if\nthey just drink the diet soda they get\nan even bigger insulin response just to\nthe diet soda than they would have\noriginally if they only had the diet\nsoda separate from food so in other\nwords the the insulin the food induced\ninsulin response is conditioning a\ngreater insulin response from the diet\nsoda and we actually have another study\nthat demonstrates the same thing out of\nSingapore um teay at all uh in American\nJournal clinical nutrition 2018 I\nbelieve that looked at a similar\nParadigm here's what they did they took\na bunch of people and they admitted them\nto their Clinical Research Center four\ntimes a week apart and they did them in\nrandom order and each time they uh\nstarted the morning they fasting and\nthey did either a sucrose tolerance test\nor an aspartame tolerance test or a\nsucralose tolerance test or a monk fruit\ntolerance test so two hours you know\ningesting one of the three one of the\nfour and measuring glucose and Insulin\nover the course of the next two hours\nfasted fasted okay okay then it was time\nfor lunch and they let them have\nwhatever lunch they want it was a\nmetabolic Buffet they could eat whatever\nthey want wanted off the\nbuffet except that they were being\nclocked and the same for dinner they\nwere being clocked but they could eat\nwhatever they wanted in a given period\nof time in the 24 hours okay you know or\nyou know from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.\nwhenever they went home okay turned out\nthe sucrose tolerance test generated an\ninsulin response as you'd expect the\nmonk fruit the Ste the uh U sucros and\nthe aspartame did not but then when they\nate\nlunch they if they had had one of the\nthree diet sweeteners in the morning\nthey ate more at lunch and more at\ndinner and generated an increased\ninsulin response both at lunch and\ndinner so that the area under the curve\nfor the whole day was exactly the same\nso they ate a significantly more yeah\nyeah because they had the diet soda in\nthe\nmorning Wild Well I\ndrink drinks that contain Stevia and I\ndon't worry about it too much but what\nyou're saying is even if I bootstrap my\ncalories there's a possibility that the\ninsulin response could have Direct\neffects on the liver exactly right and\nnot for the better and not for the\nbetter now having said\nthat um we have undertaken an\ninteresting project which I don't know\nif you know about\num in 2020 during the pandemic I was was\napproached by a food company in the\nMiddle East called Kuwaiti Danish Dairy\ncompany kdd it's the Nestle of the\nMiddle East now they make all sorts of\njunk frozen yogurt flavored milks ice\ncream confectionary biscuits tomato\nsauce\nokay Kuwait has an 18% diabetes rate and\nan\n80% obesity rate 80 zero wow in the\nadults all right now the company\nrecognized that they wanted to be a\nmetabolically healthy company and they\nknew they\nweren't they contacted me and said would\nyou put together a scientific advisory\nteam to advise us what we need to do to\nchange the food in order to be a\nmetabolically healthy company and we\nwant to lead and I said we'd be ha I'd\nbe happy to do that with one Proviso we\nget to publish what we did so that it\ncan serve as a road map for the rest of\nthe food industry and they said fine and\nso I convened a scientific advisory team\nwith my colleague wol from Alderson who\nstarted the very first farmers market in\nLos Angeles and is now actually the\ndirector of sustainability and nutrition\nfor\nkdd um uh Tim Harland who is the head of\nculinary medicine at George Washington\nUniversity Rachel\nwho is a fatty acid expert who ran the\nomega-3 for add trial at the NIH and\nAndreas cornat who's actually a computer\nscientist from\nStanford and we\nbasically stripped down every single\nthing that kdd did in terms of\nprocurement in terms of ingredients in\nterms of packaging we submitted every\nsingle ingredient to biochemical\nanalysis because you couldn't trust what\nthe vendors were\nbasically telling kdd was in the food we\nhad had to actually know what was in the\nfood and that was a half a million\ndollars all by itself I mean this was\nnot a cheap little uh you know uh you\nknow sojourn into the woods this was a\nbig deal we basically\nreengineered their entire 180 item\nportfolio and they have now turned over\n10% of their products to be\nmetabolically\nhealthy\nand the precepts that were we set in\nthis paper which is in Frontiers and\nnutrition in March of this year\n2023 three things three principles if\nyou adhere to these three principles you\ncan turn any food healthy including\nUltra processed food number one protect\nthe liver number two feed the gut number\nthree support the\nbrain if you have a food that does all\nthree of those it is healthy if you have\na food that does none of those three\nthen it's poison because it's not food\nit's I was going to say it doesn't sound\nlike food is is the right um the right\ndescriptor in that case exactly and if\nit's does one or two but not all three\nthen it's going to be somewhere in\nbetween so the goal was to take all of\nKD's products and move them from you\nknow the lowest tier up to the highest\ntier by adhering to these three\nprinciples and we came up with some very\nsimple things number one got to get rid\nof the sugar number two got to add fiber\nnumber three got to add\nOmega-3s number four gotta do something\nabout the\nemulsifiers because the emulsifiers are\ncausing the gut inflammation because\nafter all emulsifiers are detergents\nthey hold fat and water together they\nburn a hole in the mucin layer so\nthey're actually contributing to that\ngut inflammation and emulsifiers are you\nknow stre throughout ultr processed food\nthem we've heard about hidden sugars a\nlot um during today's episode and\nelsewhere but based on everything you\ntold us of about artificial excuse me\nlow calorie sweeteners um it makes more\nsense to me now why foods that are not\ntouted as diet foods would be laced with\nthings like sucralose because it should\ndrive the craving for that food through\nincreases in insulin and craving of\nother Foods later that day and later\nthat evening is that\nwhy non-caloric sweeteners are added to\nto all sorts of foods now that because\ntypically one things noncaloric\nsweeteners probably only added to quote\nunquote diet foods low calorie foods but\nthat's not you're right it's that that's\nnot the case and they are adding diet\ndiet sweeteners to foods that you didn't\nknow had diet sweeteners in them that's\nright um there are two reasons that this\nhappens one is insulin because insulin\nblocks leptin signaling at the level of\nthe hypothalamus and the nucleus\naccumbent so if it blocks leptin leptin\nis the hormone that your fat cells make\nthat tells your brain you've had enough\nso if insulin blocks leptin it makes you\nhungrier and it also extinguishes it it\nit stops the extinguishing of reward by\nthat food so that you want more of it so\nit does both because leptin normally\nsuppresses food intake and reduces\ncraving the analogy that comes to mind\nis um a slot machine that encourages you\nto feed more money and hit go to pull\nthe lever but that also blinds you to\nthe outcome so even if you win you don't\neven know that you have wins it's also\nblinding you to your losses you're\neffectively becoming automaton yeah of\njust eating without any um kind of\nconscious understanding of what you're\nyou're bringing in or tasting the food\nany longer exactly right it's not this\nlike and Anna lmy when she came on the\npodcast author of dopamine nation and\nobviously head of our dual diagnosis\naddiction clinic at Stanford talked\nabout\nyou know these these consumptive\nbehaviors where people are scrolling\nsocial media or consuming porn or uh\nconsuming drugs or alcohol in a way that\nlike they're not in touch with the\npleasure of the of the substance or\nbehavior anymore they become automatons\nbut they but if they don't do it they\nfeel lousy so the pleasure is gone the\npain is definitely waiting tolerance and\ndependence that's the definition of\naddiction so dopamine is an excitatory\nneurotransmitter it excites the next\nneuron always there was no such thing as\ndopamine inhibiting a postoptic neuron\ndopamine stimulates the next neuron and\nit doesn't matter which dopamine\nreceptor it is one through five it's\nalways excitatory now neurons like to be\nexcited that's why they have receptors\nbut neurons like to be tickled not\nbludgeoned chronic overstimulation of\nany neuron and you know this leads to\nneuronal cell death and the reason is\nbecause the neuron needs energy the\nneuron is the most energy\ndependent uh tissue in the body it needs\nthose mitochondria to be pumping out ATP\nlike crazy to engage in\nneurotransmission well when you're\nfiring\nnonstop you risk cell death so the\nexcitatory neuron the the poptic neuron\nhas a plan B it downregulates the\nreceptor it downregulates the dopamine\nreceptor so there's less chance that any\nstray dopamine molecule will find a\nreceptor to bind to and this is its Plan\nB in order to try to mitigate the risk\nof\ndying well what does that mean in human\nterms it means you get a hit you get a\nrush receptors go down next time you\nneed a bigger hit to get the same rush\nand receptors go down and you need a\nbigger hit and a bigger hit and a bigger\nhit until finally you need a huge hit to\nget nothing that's called tolerance and\nthen when the neurons do start to die\nthat's called\naddiction that's what we've got and\nthat's what's happened in terms of food\naddiction\nso the question is what's\naddictive is fat addictive no because if\nfat was addictive then all the people on\nthe Atkins diet or on the ketogenic diet\nwould be gaining weight not losing it\nand I'd be craving ribe eyes all day I\nlike a ribeye pretty often actually but\nI know I know people say no but hey look\nmy lipids are in in line and I I don't\neat many starches and I certainly avoid\nsugar although now I'm thinking I might\nwant to really reduce my uh low calorie\nsweetener intake I don't see myself\nreducing my Stevia intake to zero\nbecause it's in some things I really\nlike Andrew I am not the food police um\nyou know I always say that to people I'm\nnot a cop but the um but but but data\nare data and and and Health Data are the\nthe the data say that that's not helping\nyou any that's what the data say mhm um\npoint is that the Fat's not the problem\nthe salt's not the problem the\ncaffeine's a problem really caffeine's\nclassic addictive substance at every\nlevel yeah but in Sugar's a problem but\nif if one can cut out caffeine by the\nearly afternoon or even sooner in the\nday and it's not consumed to excess um\nand it's in the form or coffee or bate\nsome other form that's healthy you know\nis it really that much of a problem um I\nlove coffee in your that's my addiction\nlike with a capital l underline bold\nface highlight I I I I I feel your pain\nand the answer is no one has shown that\ncoffee is toxic it is addictive but it's\nnot toxic now if you mix the coffee with\nalcohol now you got four Loco now it's\ntoxic but in and of itself caffeine is\nnot um toxic and that's why there's a\nStarbucks on every street corner but it\nis highly reinforcing I did an episode\non caffeine where um it covered some\ndata that was published in the journal\nscience one of the three Apex journals\num and if you put caffeine unbeknown to\nthe consumer into plain yogurt people\nwill crave plain yogurt indeed much more\nI mean people like the feeling of being\ncaffein as long as it's not creating\nanxiety levels of energy exactly to\nstick with caffeine that's fine yeah and\nso will I we've been talking a little\nbit about the hypothalamus as well as\nsome peripheral gut-based mechanisms for\nhunger and satiety right um this is a\ngreat opportunity to talk about some of\nthe glp1 agonists that are now\num widely used so things typically\ncalled those zic but gp1 gluc glucon\nlikee peptide one right um originally\ndiscovered in the heila monster which\neats very seldom and some really smart\nbiologist I love biology like this said\nhow come they don't have to eat very\nmuch well they their blood is loaded\nwith gp1 right um and so they only have\nto eat one Whatever helila monsters um\nDelight in per year or something\noutrageous like that humans make glp1 as\nwell my understanding is that gp1 that\nthat not that's injected but that one um\nmakes\nnaturally is acting on both the brain\nand the gut to increase satiety so it is\nacting on the brain no argument but the\nprimary action is on the\ngut gp1 decreases the rate of gastric\nemptying that is its primary driver yes\nit does affect the brain I'm not arguing\nthat it does but the primary effect is\nto reduce the rate of gastric emptying\nso you stay Fuller longer because the\nfood doesn't move through the stomach\nand the intestine interesting in South\nAmerica in uguay in Argentina it was\nlong thought that um yeram mate\nconsumption which we know very modestly\nincreases glp and by the way a lot of\nother things do too um that people were\ntaking it for its uh after meals for its\nlaxative effect partially that's you\nknow it's not pleasant for but that's\nalso at the colon that's at the level of\nrather the stomach but it is used fairly\neffectively for people to space their\nmeals without snacking that you're you\nknow and maybe it's the glp1 maybe it's\nsomething else um but people are\ninjecting themselves with gp1 analoges\nnow $1,300 a month is that what it cost\nthat's what it lost right um and it\nseems to be pretty effective at inducing\nweight loss although a significant\namount of that weight loss seems to be\nfrom a skeletal muscle tissue and we're\ng we need to talk about that so what are\nyour thoughts on OIC as a as a primary\nuh earlier you talked about primary and\nsecondary control you referred to it a\nlittle bit differently in the context of\nstatins right um so a kid comes in who's\nobese or slightly overweight it's like I\ndon't know what to do I'm trying to eat\nbetter exercise or a person comes in and\nsays hey i' I've had a really hard time\ngetting that last 20 uh n pounds off for\nso many years will you prescribe me\nthose mic so the short answer is number\none I'm retired so I'm not prescribing\nanything but let's let's let's go with\nthere the data show that gp1 analoges\nlike um semaglutide and now tepati which\nis uh Li version uh Manjaro is the\ndiabetes version Zep bound is the\nObesity version in the same way that OIC\nis the diabetes version for um uh\nnovonordisk and wovi is the Obesity\nversion so they're all glp1 they're all\nGP gp1 analog there synthesized in a lab\nit looks like gp1 smells like gp1 acts\nlike gp1 when injected tepati the uh\nLily one actually has a dual function it\nuh binds to the\nGip recept receptor so it might have\ndouble duty and the data show that it's\nactually even slightly more effective at\nWeight Loss than the Nova Nordisk\nversion so we'll be seeing a shift in\nterms of uh uh consumer preference soon\nno doubt but here's the thing you look\nat the data one year uh of treatment 16%\nweight loss now that sounds great and\nI'm not saying it's bad it's good and\npeople are not craving food all the time\nis that because people are feeling full\nlonger right so they're eating less\nthey're eating less this is the calorie\nin calorie out model they're eating less\nand so they are losing weight I'm not\narguing that and they might be craving\nalcohol less According to some recent\nreports yeah well we can go there for a\nminute too in a\nsecond here's the problem when you look\nat that 16% weight loss as you just said\nwhen you put people in a dexas scanner\nthey have lost equal amounts of fat and\nmuscle musle now is it good to lose\nmuscle no it is not good ask any little\nold lady who breaks her hip if she wish\nshe had a little bit more muscle or\nsomebody who dieted lost a lot of muscle\nbecause they weren't offsetting the\nweight loss with resistance training or\nsome other form of exercise and the\namount of food that they can eat in\norder to maintain that weight to put it\nin scientific terms sucks and um you\nknow we mentioned Peter AA earlier okay\nin outlive he's made it very clear that\nsarcopenia lack of muscle mass is one of\nthe drivers of mortality so losing\nmuscle is not uh uh a a good idea but\nyou lose equal amounts of fat and muscle\nwhat else causes loss of equal amounts\nof fat and muscle starvation in fact the\nreason that all these glp1 analogues\nwork is because you stop eating like the\nhe yeah just like the Heil monster the\nHeil monsters look pretty chubby to me\nwell\nask another heal a monster I did but\nunfortunately whatever answer it\nprovided was not interpretable indeed\nthe point is that starvation is not so\ngood and if you think about why it's\nworking it's reducing gastric the rate\nof gastric emptying all right well it\nturns out that that's the reason for its\nside effects the reduction in gastric\nemptying that's why you get nausea\nthat's why you get vomiting that's why\nyou get pain\npancreatitis and most importantly now\ngastroparesis your stomach turns to\nStone and you can't move any food\nthrough your intestine at all and worse\nyet when you stop the medicine the\ngastroparesis doesn't get better this is\nnot a good idea this is like the\nopposite of the yerbamate induced effect\nwhich has a sort of prolax gastri\nemptying Maybe glp1 agonism gosh okay so\nit's obvious why people who've struggled\nto lose weight like it especially if\nthey're struggled to lose weight was at\nleast in their mind the consequence of\nbeing hungry all the time and needing to\neat more or was it because of the reward\nand you know their\ndependence because in fact yes uh uh uh\nthese go1 analoges reduce reward and\nthat's one of the reasons why they've\nnoticed that you know thing uh uh\nreduction in alcohol consumption uh as\nwell and that sounds like a good thing\nexcept there also numerous cases now of\nmajor depressive disorder in response to\nthese drugs so it's almost like an Al\ntreone or something for the treatment of\naddiction which sometimes can be useful\nbut now but the attempting to remove the\nthe um the amplitude of that reward\nsignal I mean a lot on paper it makes\nsense but the but it doesn't always play\nand in practice it doesn't play out\nthat's right and so I'm going to refer\nyou now to an old uh literature that uh\nwas from 2006 there was a drug that was\napproved in Europe called\nraniban okay a trade name ACC complia\nand it was approved in uh Europe for\nweight loss and it was pretty good at\nWeight Loss it caused about 20% weight\nloss it also caused severe depression\nand 21 suicides\nso it's no longer available because it\nwas the an yeah it was pulled from the\nEuropean market never approved in the\nUnited States and the reason this\nhappened was because this was the\nanti-marijuana drug this was the anti-\nmunchies drug this was an endoc canabo\nantagonist well when you reduce reward\nyou also reduce your desire to live and\nthat's why this concern about reduction\nin alcohol consumption we've already\nseen major depressive disorder in\npatients receiving OIC so are we going\nto see the same thing play out as we did\nfor rabant I'm worried about it or\nfenfen well fenfen didn't have um uh no\nit was cardiac it was cardiac right we\nhad cardiac problems due to the\nfenfluramine because of the uh serotonin\n1B receptor agonism right I'm just\nreferring to the fact that these these\nquote unquote Blockbuster drugs for\nobesity they tend to follow a contour of\nyou know very prom ing very exciting a\nlot of people losing\nweight suicides or very promising a lot\nof people losing\nweight um cardiac issues very promising\nlosing weight and now you're saying the\nstomach turns to Stone sound sounds so\nbiblical uh well indeed so that's the\nquestion and then finally we can really\ntalk biblical if everyone in America who\nqualified for OIC got it that would be\n2.1 trillion to the healthc care system\nwhich is currently at 4.1 trillion so\nthat would be a greater than 50%\nincrease in health care\ncosts okay at300 a\nmonth\nconversely if we just got sugar\nconsumption down to USDA guidelines by\nbasically you know putting some limits\non how much added sugar the food\nindustry can put into any given product\nlike Froot\nLoops we could reduce weight by\n29% and save $3.0 trillion doar so we'd\nget better weight loss and we'd save\n$5.1\ntrillion which makes more sense to the\nUS\ngovernment well earlier you were\nalluding to government uh big food big\nPharma relationships I mean there's a\nhuge win here for whoever's\nmanufacturing these um gp1 analoges\nindeed um but the question is who's\npaying the tab well we are um um now the\nquestion is why can't the government see\nthat and the answer is because the\ngovernment's on the Dole too because the\ngovernment uh uh through tariffs on\nus-made Foods okay grosses um 56 billion\na\nyear so they're a player they're not\njust a regulator they're an actor to\nplay devil Devil's Advocate a little bit\nlisten I'm going to be the last person\nto step in and try and defend government\nas a as a unified body I'm not qualified\nto do that but you could see how it if\nyou looked at it like Checkers instead\nof Chess you'd say okay here's a drug\nthat's going to allow many millions of\npeople to reduce their overall body\nweight overall body weight is a risk\nfactor for a number of things um and\nthere will be savings on the back end as\na consequence of that weight loss I mean\nso that's the checkers version right the\nchess version is how you're describing\nit and I think that um I mean\nclearly people in government are are\nwell most some perhaps are smart enough\nto play chess not Checkers or to at\nleast understand it but there's very\nlittle incentive for the chess model so\num what would quote unquote solve this\nproblem is the same thing that happened\nto fenfen or this Ro Roman which is if\nsuddenly there's a major issue with the\ndrug then everyone stops taking it and\ntraditionally that's how it's gone it\nsounds like these gp1 analoges are going\nto make it through the shoes though yeah\nI\nmean there is a very clear downside to\nthese medicines on the other hand you\nknow there's an upside and so I'm not\nsad that these medicines exist I'm for\nthem I'm not against them I'm for them\nfor the right patient and right now it's\nnot the right patient who's getting them\njust like the statens so what if\nsomebody who's taking uh one of these\nanaloges makes it a point to do\nresistance training and here you know\nyou mentioned bodybuilders earli I'm not\nI'm not suggesting they become\nbodybuilders but we now know and I think\npetera and others would agree that\neverybody should be doing some form of\nmuscle loss offsetting resistance\nexercise agree at least past you know\ntheir reaching their adult height or\nsomething you know I know there are\nthose that say weight training doesn't\nblunt your height but anyway let's just\nsay that from early 20s onward doing\nespecially especially if you're on these\nmedicines right in order to maintain\nmuscle mass right so that's a different\npicture\nright um people are drinking less\nalcohol again I'm playing devil's\nadvocate here um so if we look at these\nthese compounds not in a vacuum but okay\nthe person who's been carrying that\nextra 30 pounds is now only carrying a\nfew extra pounds of adapost tissue\nthey've lost a lot of muscle but now\nthey feel well enough to exercise um the\ndepression part worries me yeah but\nanyway I'm just I'm just trying to round\nthe Contour of it what we've seen in\nchildren you know because that's who I\ntook care of was was that often they\nneeded a jump start okay and there were\ndifferent ways to get them to jump start\nstomach stapling well that's not jump\nstart that's but that was what a lot of\npeople did I know I have a friend he's\nhe was and sadly still is really big and\nhe always talked about the stomach\nsaving like if I could just get 50\npounds down quickly then I could\nexercise but exercise is painful this\nkind of thing and and sadly he's he's\ncontinued to maintain or creep up in in\na very excessive weight and that's the\npoint is you know that this concept of\njump start actually if if you're only\ndoing it yourself doesn't really work\nand the question is why is his weight\ncreeping up if he's had the stomach\nstapling the answer is because he's a\nsugar addict yeah he's definitely\naddicted to the super big gulp soda and\nif you drink your calories it doesn't\nreally matter does it no and and he's\ngot such terrible psoriasis and joint\npain and all this that the prospect of\nexercising is like a you might as well\ntell him to to like flap his wings and\ngo to Mars you know fructose is a driver\nof immune dysfunction if he got off you\ncan tell him from me if he got off the\nsugar his psoriasis would get better his\nweight would get better his arthritis\nwould get better and he could have then\nthat jump start this is a perfect\nexample to bridge to the brain component\nof all this because I've long wondered\nbased on what I understand about neural\ncircuitry and\nneuroplasticity I know we share in this\nknowledge that at some point carrying a\nlot of adapost tissue means that the\nbrain sort of represents the body\ndifferently I mean we know there are\nthese these somatotopic M maps of self\num you know but that the neural\nMachinery in the hypothalamus sure which\nis responsible for Motivated States Etc\nbut but also just the entire mapping of\nthe self yeah changes in other words if\none is fat long enough mhm that it\nbecomes increasing ly hard to get to a\nhealthy weight because of the way that\nthe neural circuitry is impacted it\nbasically remaps to maintain that that\num fat person not necessarily even just\nat the level of appetite but just in\nterms of what do you what do big animals\ndo I had a bulldog that weigh 90 lb\nBulldog Mastiff he was very economical\nwith his movement right he was extremely\npowerful he could run at least in when\nhe was younger but if he could be still\nhe was still as opposed to certain\nsmaller animals that are like peretic\nright because because he was leptin\nresistant so leptin as we talked about\nbriefly is um the hormone that tells\nyour brain you've had enough if you are\nleptin sensitive you are happy to burn\nif you are LEP and resistant your brain\nthinks you're starving and if your brain\nthinks you're starving it's going to\naffect your behavior in two ways it's\ngoing to make you want to eat and it's\nalso going to make you want to conserve\nbecause the goal is to try to increase\nthe leptin levels in order to overcome\nthat resistance which of course you can\nnever do because all you're going to do\nis lay down more fat and make more\nleptin that makes so much sense because\nleptin comes from the adapost tissue\nexactly so that leptin resistance is\nwhat you have to be able to break\nthrough you have to fix the leptin\nsensitivity well what's the driver of\nthe leptin resistance\ninsulin insulin inhibits leptin\nsignaling and it does it at three\nseparate places in the palc neuron the\nproopiomelanocortin neuron in the\nhypothalamus it does it at um irs2\ninsulin receptor substrate 2 it does it\nat socks 3 suppressor of cyto signaling\n3 and it does it at pip 3 phosphole\nandosol triphosphate those three\nseparate arms of the uh uh leptin\nreceptor are all basically put to sleep\nby high insulin insulin blocks Le in\nsignaling so the higher the insulin goes\nthe more your brain thinks you're\nstarving and the more your brain thinks\nyou're starving the hungrier you get and\nthe less you want to move so the\ngluttony and sloth that we've been\ntalking about all all you know podcast\nis really biochemical it is secondary to\nthis phenomenon of insulin blocking\nleptin signaling you got to fix that\nfirst get the insulin in down any way\nyou can and the best way get rid of the\nrefined carbohydrate and\nsugar that's where you\nstart it makes so much sense it works\ntoo how about that that's always good it\nis I once heard you say I think it was\nin a conversation with Peter AA on his\npodcast and this really stuck in my mind\nthat when a person\nconsumes\nglucose that it activates a number of\ndifferent brain sites you know neurons\nloving glucose but that when one ingests\nfructose that it preferentially\nactivates neurons in the reward pathway\nthat's right at maybe seven times the\nthe magnitude or or something like that\nwell uh glucose activates the basil\nganglia uh this is work from walner\nHousen and uh Switzerland and also Eric\nstce at or for movement at planning and\nexecution exactly okay um fructose\nbasically stimulates the nucleus\naccumbent the reward center it is just\nlike heroin Just Like Cocaine just like\nuh nicotine it activates the reward\ncenter it doesn't do anything for the\nbasil\nganglia so it is addictive anything that\nstimulates the reward center in the\nextreme is addictive so we have chemical\naddictions heroin cocaine nicotine\nalcohol sugar we have behavioral\naddictions shopping gambling internet\ngaming social media pornography doesn't\nmatter they all stimulate dopamine in\nthe reward center and in the extreme\nthey are all addictive so the question\nis if you are\naddicted is that personal\nresponsibility well it's uh a very\num it's a question I think about a lot\nbecause uh I know a lot of people in the\naddiction recovery Community um both\nfrom the treatment end and the addict\nend yeah and there's always comes down\nto this question when somebody is\nsuffering from an addiction of any kind\nand they're resistant to getting\ntreatment if you look at it them as a as\nbeing sick at least in that moment is a\nsick person in the best or worst or at\nleast diminished position to guide their\nown treatment so for instance somebody\nwith dementia would you ask them do you\nwant to go see a\nneurologist you might ask them that but\nare they the best person to make that\nthat decision well this is the problem\nso that this is this is where personal\nresponsibility falls down so personal\nresponsibility as you know we talked\nabout four criteria have to be met none\nof them are met that's the first issue\nsecond one is a little bit shall we say\ncheek gear who invented personal\nresponsibility any idea I'm definitely\ngoing to get this this one wrong yeah\nyou're going to get this one wrong are\nyou ready got yeah I don't know the\ntobacco industry the notion of person Al\nresponsibility they invented it there\nwas no personal responsibility until\ntobacco in 1962 CU they were getting\nkilled on the science and they needed to\ninvent another reason for you to smoke\nin fact there's a paper that came out\nDorfman at all that looked at the New\nYork Times And The Washington Post and\nthey did a entire lit search of the\nentire of uh you know the all of the\noutput of those two new newspapers for\ndecades to look for the term personal\nresponsibility and the very first time\nit was ever mentioned was\n1962 and it didn't pick up in speed\nuntil\n1986 which was the same year as cipolone\nV liot in the at the Supreme Court which\nbasically said that the uh you know that\nuh uh the cigarette industry was um was\nguilty of U of um uh applying people\nwith an addictive substance so this is\nvery\nspecifically industry-driven and we have\nthe data to prove it amazing\nwell I\nwonder along the lines of personal\nresponsibility um given that many\nlisteners to this conversation are going\nto be thinking about their own food\nintake and food choices that of their\nchildren and other relatives that we\ncould play a little a little uh not a\ngame but a little rapid is fire Q&A\nnever done this before in this podcast\nbut I think it's particularly\nappropriate for a discussion like this\nthat Wicks out into so many areas and I\nabsolutely will invite you back and\nperhaps along with um lle to talk about\nsome of the exciting work you guys are\ndoing because there's so much we could\ncover but people are going to wonder in\na very practical\nsense whether or not they should or\nshould not be consuming certain things\nand I know you're not the food police\nI'm not the food police and I'm not a\ncop and I do believe people should are\nshould be in choice about these matters\nbut I also believe that because you're a\nguest on the podcast and you're highly\ninformed and and have done clinical work\nand research for so many years in this\narea and you have such a clear stance on\nthe role of big food and and we really\nreally appreciate your your honesty and\ndirectness but not you'd be willing to\nprovide a comment about a couple of\ndifferent terms that I'll throw out and\nif you choose to say really nothing to\nsay about that fine that would be a\nquick Quick Pass so um here we go um and\nwe covered a little bit of this earlier\nbut um fruit in whole form so\num has fructose but has fiber so thumbs\nup thumbs sideways or thumbs down for\nfruit consumption fruit is fine fruit\njuice is not great thank you white rice\nversus brown rice and among the white\nrice is the sticky rice um and the Rices\nwith added sugars which you find in in a\nlot of um a lot restaurants brown rice\nbecause of the fiber white rice polished\nyou know number one all the vitamin B1\ngone and of course a much larger glucose\nExcursion that glycemic index thing\nwhich of course I hate is it's glycemic\nload that matters and that is a very\nhigh glycemic load so brown rice so\nbrown rice is better than white rice yes\nokay in a meaningful way in a meaningful\nway okay um earlier you mentioned tomato\nsauce I love tomato sauce that's made\nfrom just Tomatoes can Tom so is are\nmost tomato sauces filled with sugar\nperfect our little uh recommendation\nengine looked at this question and it\nturns out that only 10% of the available\ntomato sauces out on the market don't\nhave added sugar so you have to know\nwhich ones well you can look yourself or\nyou can look up perfect and it will tell\nyou which ones you can buy if people\nchose to consume bread which many people\ndo uh is there a way to just across the\nboard without just baking your own or\nsee or looking at the ingredients list\nto make a better choice is it like\nsourdoughs tend to have less sugar than\nblank um well sourdough has been\nfermented so it will have actually\nconsumed some of the sugar so it would\nbe a better choice but really the best\nchoice is the highest fiber breads\nnow if you look at a wheat berry\nit is\n25% fiber the husk is 25% of the weight\nof that wheat berry that means that the\ncarbohydrate to fiber ratio of a wheat\nberry is\n3:1 so a good bread should have a\ncarbohydrate to fiber ratio of somewhere\nbetween 3:1 to 5:1 tops anything above\nthat means that they've stripped the\nfiber away so that's something you could\ndo but the easier way is to actually\nlook it up on\nperfect you mentioned meat and meat\nsourcing um egg and chicken sourcing\nearlier maybe we just revisit that um\nmeat fish and eggs uh thumbs up thumbs\nsideways thumbs down or it depends it\ndepends it depends on where the meat\ncame from it depends on whether it was\npastur raised depends on whether it's\norganic or not if they uh animal was\ninjected with antibiotics stay away from\nit because those antibiotics are in the\nmeat they're going to to basically\nsterilize your gut and then the bad\nbacteria are going to take over we\nhaven't really talked much about the\nmicrobiome today but that's a whole\npodcast all by itself well we can touch\non it a little bit more uh F low sugar\nfermented foods thumbs up thumbs\nsideways thumbs fermented foods short\nchain fatty acids all good what are your\nfavorite sources of fermented foods I\nlike kimchi yeah I like kimchi too I\nlike some of the live sourkrauts yeah\nthat's also good but with the right you\nknow the right uh AC accouterment um the\none thing I would be uh careful about is\nyogurt okay so there are yogurts with\nlive cultures and there are a whole lot\nof yogurts with dead cultures and if\nit's a yogurt with dead cultures it's\nkind of irrelevant and the chances are\nthey've actually covered up the sourness\nwith sugar so Comm you know large\ncommercially available yogurt be very\nvery careful okay if it's a you know\nArtisan yogurt you know made by a you\nknow people you know or trust you know\nthat's a very different story um you\nknow yogurts with live cultures\nintermittent fasting do you practice it\nand what do you think about it um I\ndon't practice it but I am for it for\nthe right patient turns out who's the\nright patient the patient with liver fat\nbecause the reason it works is because\nit gives the liver a chance to basically\nburn off the fat that it's stored\nzero calorie\nsoda got it it's definite no and I don't\neven have to ask about sugary soda\nbecause that's uh that that's basically\njust poison in a can food combinations\nuh I have a feeling I know what your\nanswer is but the glycemic index which\nwe know your feelings on now um asserts\nthat if you combine some fat with a\nsugary like like eating ice cream you\nhave a more blunted insulin response\nthan if you were to eat pure sugar of\nequivalent calories but um\nwhat are your thoughts on food\ncombinations as a way to blunt the\ninsulin response food combinations are\ngreat if there's some Fiber associated\nwith it it comes back to fiber again and\nby the way and by the way uh I you know\nfull disclosure I am the chief medical\nofficer of a fiber company what is it it\nis called\nbiolumin and it is a proprietary fiber\nit is a uh microcellulose\nsponge seven microns in diameter so the\nsize of a red blood cell you swallow it\nit goes to your stomach it expands 70\nfold over its original size and so it'll\ngive you a feeling of fullness because\nit's taking up space in the stomach but\nmore importantly when it expands the\nnooks and the crannies in the sponge\nbecome available and embedded in those\nnooks and crannies are a set of\npropretary hydrogels soluble fiber which\nsequester glucose fructose sucrose\nsimple starch es and render them\nunavailable for early absorption in the\ndadum thus reducing the glucose response\nreducing the insulin response protecting\nthe liver and moving it through the\nintestine so that microbiome can chew it\nup for its own purposes feeding the gut\nwe can reduce glucose absorption by 36%\nfructose absorption by 38% sucrose\nabsorption by 40% simple starch\nabsorption by 9% and increased short\nchain fatty A acid production by\n60% without an increase in gas when do\npeople take this with meals okay so B it\nit comes as a sachche u one teaspoon\nsprinkle it on your food or take it as a\nyou know in a drink you know just mix it\nin and Slug it down and then eat\nbreakfast lunch or dinner and it will\nbasically act like you ate real food it\nwill turn processed food into real food\nin the intestine and we have clinical\ntrial data that demonstrates that is it\navailable as a commercial it is\navailable it is called Munch Munch now I\nhate that name I didn't make it up well\nyou getet yeah your marketing team sucks\nbut the product sounds amazing um so\nbiol. Tech great thank you for that\nsorry Munch Munch marketing team but you\ngot to munch munch to a new product name\num but it sounds like a a very\ninteresting product and it actually\nanswered my next question which was\nabout um fiber supplements fiber is good\nbut there are two kinds of fiber there's\nsoluble and there's insoluble they are\nnot the same so soluble is what goes\ninto Fiber One bars you know that\npsyllium um\ninulin uh um uh uh pectin like what\nholds jelly together um that's good I'm\nnot saying it's bad but you need the\ninsoluble fiber the cellulose the\nstringy stuff in celery the cardboard if\nyou will um together they form this gel\nthat we talked about earlier if you only\nconsume the soluble fiber which is what\nthe food industry will add to to food\nbecause the insoluble fiber is not\nmissible if you only add the soluble\nfiber back you're not getting the\nbenefits of the entire fiber\ncomplement earlier when talking about\nthe Nova system and uh how most all of\nour food so n let's say I know it was 7\nto 10% let's say 95% let's air on the\nside of better uh 95% of our food should\ncome from Nova System class one or class\ntwo Foods or three or three okay staying\naway from those um Nova class 4 Foods\ncould you give us some examples of Nova\nclass one and Class 2 Foods um just BR\nbroadly speaking okay Nova class one is\nany food without a\nlabel\nperiod if you see a label on a food it's\na warning label well there's ground\nground beef has a label okay so that's\nwell does it so you're talking about\nApple well when I buy it it has a label\nI'm asking this because people are going\nto wonder so well it doesn't have a\nnutrition facts label is there a\nnutrition facts label on a thing of\nground beef I buy that that uh ground\nbeef where I consume venison um where if\nyou flip it over it says how many\ncalories how many protein so there's a\nlabel um but but it's just beef for\nvenison okay then that's class one okay\negg egg is class one so and then of\ncourse fruit apples orange okay so it\ndoesn't matter if it has a has a name a\nname tag as long as it it doesn't have\nan ingredient lab got it real food does\nnot need a label it's only if they did\nsomething to it that it needs a label so\nyou have to look at every label as a\nwarning label now the problem with the\nlabel is it only tells you what's in the\nfood what you really need to know is\nwhat's been done to the food because\nit's the ultr processed food that's the\nproblem they don't want to tell you that\nthat's secret okay secret from a\nproprietary standpoint but also secret\nbecause if you knew what they did to it\nyou wouldn't need it you would never buy\nit and they don't want you to know so\nthey only tell you what's in the food\nthat's not what's important it's what's\nbeen done to the food that's important\nand that's why this Nova class 4 is so\nimportant and that's why perfect is so\nimportant because it'll do the work for\nyou okay well definitely um provide\nlinks to all of these\nso if you could pick one thing to\nrecommend to people that want to improve\ntheir health get rid of the sugar okay\nperiod very clear that's number one\nnumber two go for a walk the exercise\npiece yeah go for a walk and if you\ncould recommend one thing that the\ngeneral public can do to try and um\nassist in this advocacy\nfor not redefining but actually clearly\ndefining what is food and what isn't and\nmaking people aware um at the level of\npolicy and change and school lunches I\nmean if there were one thing what can we\ndo I mean I I you've clearly activated\nmy neurons surrounding like the the the\nset of problems that exist and the paths\nto correct them but should we be writing\nto our Congress people should we be um\ngetting angry at hospitals because\nthey've got all these fast food machines\nand that the cafeteria food is like is\nlike is like illness promoting at UCSF\nwe've gotten rid of oil sugar beverages\nwe have the healthy beverage initiative\nso no Coke machines at UC No Coke\nmachines at ucss wow Stanford check that\nout because you know people always send\nme pictures of the of the coke machines\nin the school of medicine I'm like\nlisten I didn't put him there but I I I\nuh we have to model for the public you\nknow I mean where where was the first\nplace that smoking was banned hospitals\nokay because we knew so if you get rid\nof the you know uh uh soda if you get\nrid of the sugared soda at the hospital\nyou're telling people something so yeah\nI think that every hospital and really\nevery public venue in America needs to\nclear out the junk so post photos of\njunk that are supposed to be in uh in\nhealth promoting institutions and um I\nguess the we're trying to cancel junk\nfood we're trying to cancel junk food\nI'm pretty opposed to cancel culture but\nhere we go we're going to cancel um\nmarvelous it's actionable it's\nstraightforward it's low cost low time\ninvestment zero cost um very low time\ninvestment so thank you for that and\nlook up eat real because we're doing it\nfor your kids so you need to help\nsupport it any school district in\nAmerica can do it so what do we do we\nhave a business model whereby the uh\nFood Services director um either\npurchases or rents a dilapidated Factory\nin the center of the district repurposes\nit into a food preparation facility they\ncan make 27 to 30,000 meals a day okay\nwith a you know Skeleton Crew and then\nthey and and you control what's in it\nand because you're buying in volume it\nactually reduces the cost so it's\ncheaper than buying it from Cisco or\naromar or sedexo or wherever and then\nyou farm it out via you know truck or\nbus all the different schools so every\nkid gets a hot meal made from scratch\neach day and we can solve\nthis\nproblem can't help but ask this one last\nquestion for people that want to cut out\nsugar which you clearly stated is the\nmost important thing to do for one's\nHealth how do we know how much sugar is\nin something I so should people be\nlooking at labels and just looking for\nhow how much sugar how much carbohydrate\nor could we even go so far as to say if\nit says um high fructose corn syrup then\nit's it's on the nfly list don't don't\ndon't eat it so the problem the problem\nis that there are 262 names for sugar\nand the food industry uses all of them\nand the reason they use all of them is\nbecause they can include a different\nsugar as number five number six number\nseven number eight number nine on the\nlist when you add it up it becomes\nnumber one they hide in plain sight and\nthey do it on\npurpose\nnow do I expect everybody to memorize\nall 262 names no of course\nnot can you figure it out yourself well\nthe answer is no unless they have the\nline where it says added sugars if it\nsays added sugars it is either sucros or\nhigh fructose corn syrup no one's adding\nlactose okay that's not Happ or glucose\nthey're not even adding adding glucose\nbecause glucose isn't that sweet glucose\nis not that interesting you don't see\npeople going around chugging Kos syrup\ndo you okay that's glucose who cares\nyeah might be good in the Molasses\ncookie but that's it all right so it's\nfructose so you need to know what's been\nadded so if it says added sugars that's\na good place to start no greater than\none teaspoon per serving no greater than\nfour gam per serving of added sugars\nanything greater than that leave at the\nstore and aim for those Nova type type\none for no aim for Nova types one two\nand three and if you don't know whether\nit's Nova type one two or three you can\nuse perfect and if you don't look at\nthat then go look at the nutrition facts\nlabel and anything that has more than\nfour ingredients is Nova class 4 Robert\nlustig thank you so much you've provided\nsuch an incredible educ education in\nnutritional biochemistry the processing\nof fat protein carbohydrate sugar\nfructose in particular the clear\ndetriments of consuming fructose on so\nmany different organ systems I love love\nlove that you separated out food science\nNutrition and\nmetabolic health or self that's just I\nthat's a you know that's a gazillion\ndollar delineation for people to\nunderstand and to shape their\nunderstanding of all the information\nthat's out there\nand bins into these different categories\nyou've given us so many actionable tools\num new conceptual Frameworks you given\nus a real tour to force today in a just\noh so clear language so I want to thank\nyou I've learned a ton and um and I know\neveryone else has as well and if people\nhave questions they can of course put\nthem in the comment section on YouTube\nthat's the best place we'll provide\nlinks to all the the companies and uh\nwebsit ites that that you referenced and\nsome of your other work and listen I\njust I'm so so grateful that you exist\nand that you've done the work that\nyou've done and and your passion and\nyour advocacy for health is um it's just\noh so clear so thank you so much for so\nI want I want to thank you and the\nreason I want to thank you is first of\nall you know inviting me that's nice you\nknow that's good but the reason is\nbecause people need to understand\nscience I am completely in agreement\nwith you the public needs to understand\nscience they listen to you because you\nnumber one provide the science and\nnumber two you don't talk down to them\nyou treat them as equals and that is\ntruly remarkable and so I want to thank\nyou for your service well you're most\nwelcome it's a labor of love and um I\nthink it was the great Max Del Brook\nthat said uh when teaching assume zero\nknowledge and infinite intelligence and\nI do believe that humans are infinitely\nintelligent although sometimes as a\nwhole we mask it um people deserve the\nthe knowledge so thank you so much for\nsharing that knowledge today and let's\nabsolutely have you back my pleasure\nthank you thank you for joining me for\ntoday's discussion with Dr Robert lustig\nabout nutrition and how sugar impacts\nthe health of our brain and body
