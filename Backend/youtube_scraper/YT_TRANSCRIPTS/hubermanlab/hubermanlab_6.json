    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine I'm pleased to announce that my\nnew book which I've been working on for\nmore than 5 years is now available for\npre-sale purchase the book is entitled\nprotocols an operating manual for the\nhuman body and within the book you can\nfind as the suggests protocols for\neverything from how to improve and even\noptimize your sleep for increasing your\nmotivation and focus for nutrition that\nis specific nutritional guidelines to\nfollow for health and performance as\nwell as exercise Stress Control your\noral and gut microbiome both of which\nare critical for brain and body Health\nas well as protocols for creativity and\nmuch more within the Book You'll also\nfind the scientific basis that is the\nmechanisms and specific studies that\nsubstantiate these protocols and the\nbook is designed to be incredibly easy\nto use such that if you're suffering\nfrom a particular pain point in life\nsuch as difficulty sleeping or excess\nstress or any number of different issues\nthat you can go to a specific chapter in\nprotocol and begin to resolve that issue\nso my goal in writing this book is that\nit not only be exceptionally practical\nbut that it also be extremely\ninformative that is teaching you a lot\nabout the science that underlies the\nprotocols that can improve your mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nto order protocols go to protocols\nbook.com and there you will find links\nto any number of different vendors and\nyou can select the one that you prefer\nagain that's protocols book.com my guest\nfor today's episode is Dr Gabriel lion\nDr Gabrielle lion is a medical doctor\nwho did her clinical and research\ntraining at Washington University in St\nLouis she is an expert in geriatrics in\nnutrition in Health and Longevity and\nduring today's episode Dr lion explains\nhow if we are interested in our\nimmediate and long long-term Health\nMuscle is the organ that we need to pay\nattention to she explains how this is\ntrue for everybody men and women alike\nand that there are specific things that\nwe all can and should do with our\nnutrition and our exercise in order to\nmaximize the health of our muscular\ntissue now in some cases people will be\ninterested in building more muscle but\nit's important to point out that much of\ntoday's discussion is simply about\nimproving the health of your muscular\ntissue and the specific ways to do that\nin order to support brain Health body\nhealth and movement of course as well as\nthe health of every organ system in your\nbody again placing a focus on improving\nmuscular tissue itself as a way to\nimprove all the organ and tissue systems\nof your body Dr Lon explains the\nspecific science and protocols that can\nbe applied in your everyday life at the\nlevel of what you choose to eat or not\neat as well as how much of certain foods\nto eat or avoid as well as specific\ntraining regimens most of which take\nvery little time but they can vastly\nimprove the health of your muscular\ntissue and therefore the health of your\nentire brain and body I'm certain that\nby the end of today's episode you will\nhave a much more thorough understanding\nof what you can do to improve your\nimmediate and long-term health and\nthereby potentially your lifespan all of\nwhich are based on the most modern\nunderstanding from basic research from\nclinical studies and from practical\napplication in the real world before you\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nMaui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the\nmost nutrient-dense and delicious red\nmeat available I've spoken many times\nbefore on this and other podcast and\nwith several expert guests on this\npodcast about the fact that most of us\nshould be seeking to get about 1 gram of\nhighquality protein per pound of body\nweight every day not only does that\nprotein provide critical building blocks\nfor things like muscle repair and\nsynthesis but also for overall\nmetabolism and health Maui Nei venison\nhas an extremely high quality protein\nper calorie ratio so that you can get\nthat one gram of protein per pound of\nbody weight easily and without ingesting\nin excess of calories also Maui venison\nis absolutely delicious I love their\nvenison steaks their ground venison I\nlove their bone broths and I love their\njerky which is extremely convenient when\nyou're traveling those Maui Nei venison\njerky sticks have 10 G of high quality\nprotein per stick at just 55 calories\nwhile Maui Nei offers the highest\nquality meat available their supplies\nare limited responsible management of\nthe access deer population on the island\nof Maui means that they will not go\nbeyond Harvest capacity so signing up\nfor a membership is the best way to\nensure access to their highquality meat\nif you'd like to try Maui Nei venison\nyou can go to mauii venison\ndocomond to get 20% off your membership\nor first order again that's Maui venison\n/ huberman today's episode is also\nbrought To Us by levels levels is a\nprogram that lets you see how different\nfoods and activities affect your health\nby giving you real-time feedback on your\ndiet using a continuous glucose monitor\none of the most important factors in\nboth your short and long-term health is\nyour body's ability to manage glucose or\nwhat's sometimes called blood sugar to\nmaintain energy and focus throughout the\nday you want to keep your blood glucose\nsteady without big spikes or crashes I\nstarted using levels about 3 years ago\nas a way to understand how different\nfoods and activities impacted my blood\nglucose levels and it's proven\nincredibly informative for me in\ndetermining what food choices I make\nwhen to eat and when to time eating\nrelative to workouts sleep Etc indeed\nusing levels has made it very easy for\nme to optimize my entire schedule and to\nunderstand where the flexibility in that\nschedule exists so that if I need to\nmove a meal or I need to fast a little\nbit longer or if I need to work out\nfasted or not fasted all of that can be\nadjusted while maintaining energy and\nfocus and great sleep at night if you're\ninterested in learning more about levels\nand trying a CGM yourself you can go to\nlevels. l/ huberman levels just launched\na new CGM sensor that is smaller and has\neven better tracking than the previous\nversion right now they're also offering\nan additional two free months of\nmembership again that's levels. link l\nnk/ huberman to try the new sensor and\ntwo free months of membership today's\nepisode is also brought To Us by Helix\nsleep Helix sleep makes mattresses in\npillows that are customized to your\nunique sleep needs now I've spoken many\ntimes before on this other podcast about\nthe fact that sleep is the foundation\nfor mental health physical health and\nperformance now one of the key things to\ngetting a great night's sleep is to make\nsure that you sleep on a mattress\ndesigned specifically for your sleep\nneeds and that's what Helix sleep\nmattresses are designed to accomplish if\nyou go to the Helix website and take a\nbrief two-minute quiz it asks you\nquestions such as do you sleep on your\nback your side or your stomach do you\ntend to run hot or cold during the night\nmaybe you know maybe you don't know the\nanwers to those questions in any case\nthey'll match you to the ideal mattress\nfor your unique sleep needs for me that\nturned out to be the dusk Helix mattress\nI started sleeping on a dusk mattress\nabout three and a half years ago and\nit's been Far and Away the best sleep\nthat I've ever had because it's\ncustomized to my unique sleep needs if\nyou'd like to try Helix you can go to\nhelixsleep.com\nhuberman take that two-minute sleep quiz\nand Helix will match you to a mattress\nthat's ideal for your unique sleep needs\nright now Helix is giving up to 30% off\nmattresses and two free pillows again\nthat's helixsleep.com\nhuberman to get 30% off and two free\npillows and now for my discussion with\nDr Gabrielle lion Dr Gabrielle lion\nwelcome thank you so much so great to\nhave you here you have a tremendous\nrange and depth of expertise you treat\nmen you treat women you know a ton about\nexercise physiology\nnutrition you've done work in Psychiatry\nyou've done work in\ngeriatrics you know so very much about\nhow to get healthy and stay healthy and\ntoday we're going to talk about all of\nthat to kick things off I would love to\ndive into your take on this unique\naspect of our physiology that most\npeople when they hear about think about\nweight training or maybe bodybuilding or\nhave some immediate reaction to to but\nyou have a different stance on this\nincredible organ that we call\nmuscle so if you would just tell us how\nyou look at this thing that we call\nmuscle in Men in women in kids and old\npeople young people how should we think\nabout muscle well first of all muscle is\nthe organ of longevity and we've always\nthought about muscle just as you said\nwhen it comes to exercise performance\nmobility and strength which by the way\nall of those things are are important\nand critical for life but there's\nsomething very unique and special to\nskeletal muscle first of all it's an\norgan system it's an endocrine organ it\nis responsible for a large component of\nglucose disposal roughly 80% of glucose\ndisposal and we all hear about these\nthings like cardiovascular disease type\n2 diabetes\nobesity largely many of these metabolic\ndiseases begin in skeletal muscle\ndecades before interesting\nskeletal muscle is also an amino acid\nReservoir it is the place that your body\npulls from amino acids and that is um\nsomething that changes as we age this\nidea of protein turnover and we require\nhealthy skeletal muscle of course it's\nthe body armor that we all know and it\nis really responsible for how we age and\nby the way I came to this understanding\nthrough um an experience I'd love to\nshare with you I did my fellowship in\ngeriatrics and nut sciences and at the\ntime we were looking at you know every\nfellow has to have a project lucky for\nus and we were looking at body\ncomposition brain function and there was\none patient who I just adored she was a\nmom of three kids and she had always\nyo-yo dieted we imaged her brain and her\nbrain looked like the beginning of an\nAlzheimer's brain and I thought to\nmyself and I felt very responsible\nthinking why was this woman who was\ndoing everything that we told her to do\nshe was exercising she was eating a\nlow-fat High carbohydrate diet why was\nshe so metabolically\nunhealthy and I realized that at the end\nof the day it wasn't that she was\noverfat it was that she was under\nmuscled and we spend decades and have\nspent decades trying to treat obesity\nwhen really what we need to be looking\nat is skeletal\nmuscle super interesting we know that\nthe brain is among the most\nmetabolically active organs in the body\nand muscle too one of the most\nmetabolically active organs in the body\nyou'll probably tell me that one is more\nactive than the other which one is it\nmuscle is actually quite frankly not\nvery metabolically active at rest\ninteresting for every pound of skeletal\nmuscle it might at rest burn 10 calories\nprimarily Burns fatty acids at rest okay\nI learned something new and I imagine\nmany other people did as well so this\nwoman that was overweight yeah um you\nlooked at the problem through a\ndifferent lens that she's under\nmuscled how does one go from being\nunderused to properly muscled and what\nis that and as I say this I realize that\nmany of our listeners probably don't\nresistance train or if they do they may\nnot want to carry a lot of muscle\nthinking that that would make them have\nto buy a new wardrobe you know certainly\nsome of our listenership probably wants\nto gain more muscle but is or a new\nwardrobe new wardrobe is there a way to\nview increasing muscle mass in a way\nthat is compatible with kind of um I\ndon't know we call like traditional\nAesthetics or um with overall health in\na way that's sort of distinct from quote\nunquote bodybuilding I mean again as\nsoon as we talk about muscle we think\nabout slabs of meat added to different\nparts of our body and surely certain\npeople probably want to add muscle to\ncertain parts of their body for\naesthetic reasons but how should we\nthink about muscle in the context of\nsome of the todos um in terms of\nnutrition and exercise and we'll segue\ninto that again how should we\nconceptualize this business of being\nunder muscled and getting to I guess\nwhat we call appropriately muscled uh I\nthink that that's a it's a really good\npoint this idea of being appropriately\nmuscled so the truth is I can't tell you\nhow much skeletal muscle mass you should\nhave for Optimal Health I don't know how\nmuch skeletal muscle mass I should have\nfor Optimal Health we haven't done a\ngood job in the literature and just as a\npopulation being able to track skeletal\nmuscle and know what is optimal we are\nreally good at looking at body fat and\nwe're really looking good at looking a\nbone but when it comes to skeletal\nmuscle dexa is an extrapolation so for\nexample we use dexa as the gold standard\nand I'm going to come back to what we\nneed to do to gain healthy skeletal\nmuscle but I think that there it's\nreally important to put things into\nperspective and a framework for how we\nthink about things we traditionally use\ndexa dexa looks at bone and it looks at\nlean tissue collectively part of lean\ntissue is skeletal muscle mass it\ndoesn't determine the health of skeletal\nmuscle mass it doesn't determine\nanything about the quality of that\ntissue it purely looks at lean tissue\nwhich then we determine part of that\nlean tissue maybe it's 40% is skeletal\nmuscle and that's important to\nunderstand as we begin to frame up the\nconversation is how much skeletal muscle\nshould I have\nI have no idea but what I can tell you\nis that if I were to look at your blood\nwork and I saw something like elevated\ntriglycerides or elevated insulin or\nelevated glucose I would begin to\nunderstand that the health of your\nskeletal muscle isn't where it should be\nand by the way the health of skeletal\nmuscle mass begins when we're young this\nidea of sarcopenia which for The\nListener or the viewer the definition of\nsarcopenia by the way became a disease\nit wasn't even classified as a disease\ntill 2016 wow yes wow which is very\nrecent for a disease it is a decrease in\nmuscle mass and\nfunction but interestingly we don't\nnecessarily know what one should have so\nI think it's important to understand\nthat when we're talking about the health\nof skeletal muscle we're still pretty\nmuch in the infancy of understanding the\ntrajectory of of where it is and where\nit's going so when we think about how we\nmaintain the health of skeletal muscle\none of the things that I I didn't\nmention is that skeletal muscle is a\nnutrient sensing\norgan it is uniquely sensitive to the\nquality of our diet the quality of our\ndiet defined as the quality of the amino\nacids that we're gaining and that would\nbe for the listener dietary protein\nskeletal muscle is sensitive to one of\nthe amino acids lucing and depending on\nthe quality of the diet meaning how much\nLucine that you're getting in any given\nmeal will then stimulate muscle Health\nnot just muscle size but muscle Health\nMuscle health and the way that we think\nabout muscle health is bioxy is this\nthis concept called muscle protein\nsynthesis which we can measure and when\nwe get a dietary protein amount which is\nbetween 30 and 50 grams of high quality\nprotein it stimulates skeletal\nmuscle so I love this idea of focusing\nfor a bit on muscle protein health\nbecause it divorces us from this\nconversation at least temporarily about\nmuscle size which of I have to imagine\nis correlated but it's a separate thing\nAl together actually I should just ask\nthe question is it possible for somebody\nto have a lot of muscle but their muscle\nhealth is poor yes okay conversely can\nsomebody have a moderate to low amount\nof muscle but their muscle quality is\nhigh or is that less common um well the\nthe first thing that you said is is AB\nabsolutely something that we see is that\nin an individual that carries a lot a\nlot of muscle and say they're inactive\nthere is a big discussion about how um\nheavy individuals will have more muscle\nmass but what we have to recognize is\nthe health of that skeletal muscle is\nfat deposition can be visceral fat\ndeposition fat around the organs and it\ncan be also fat infiltrate into the\ntissue like not to gross anyone out a\nmarbled steak and that's exactly what\ncan happen to un healthy skeletal muscle\nwhich then affects its ability to\ncontract which also affects there's a\nton of mitochondria in skeletal muscle\nit affects the efficiency of skeletal\nmuscle so yes someone can have\npotentially more muscle but more\nunhealthy muscle interesting when you\nsay um a marbled steak I think at the\nextreme like a wagu m um a raw wagu\nlooks like there's as much white fat in\nit as there is red meat in it um and\nit's a very different taste and texture\nso that's what we're talk talking about\nmy understanding is those cows uh don't\nmove around much um they're somewhat\nsedentary compared to say a free range\ngrass eating cow is that right yeah\nthat's that's absolutely correct okay so\nwe want we want quality healthy muscle\nand then we can talk about muscle amount\nand then the other thing that I'll say\nabout it is part of what defines muscle\nhealth is that flux that movement so if\nyou were to think about skeletal muscle\nlike a suitcase and an individual was\nsay going on a trip for 4 days but\nchooses to eat or pack for 30 days we\nknow these people yes I know I'm maybe\none of them I have my suitcase here I\nwas only coming in for a day but I may\nhave packed for four days not sure what\nI was doing but uh that's besides the\npoint when an individual is overeating\ncalories overeating carbohydrates I had\nmentioned earlier that skeletal muscle\none of its primary roles is glucose\ndisposal and I'm sure we're going to get\nin the mechanisms of glucose disposal\nwhether it's uh insulin dependent or\ninsulin independent depending on if\nsomeone is moving or Contracting that\nmuscle when an individual is eating food\ncarbohydrates it gets stored in skeletal\nmuscle as glycogen because as we know\nglucose at a high level is toxic to the\nbody so the body must move glucose out\nof the bloodstream into the the cells\nnow what happens is is there becomes\nthis stasis so if an individual is\ninactive\nand not exercising then that skeletal\nmuscle becomes overpacked uh skeletal\nmuscle at rest Burns primarily free\nfatty acids which is interesting most\npeople think about skeletal muscle as\nburning carbohydrates but actually at\nrest skeletal muscle Burns fatty acids\nas you can imagine when that muscle is\nfull and you are not exercising it then\nthe substrates have nowhere to go and it\nremains in the bloodstream and that\nwould be a sign of unhealthy skeletal\nmuscle which then Loops back to what you\nsee in blood work elevated insulin\nelevated blood glucose elevated free\nfatty acids elevated Branch chain amino\nacids all of these things which again as\nskeletal muscle as the metabolic sink\nhave nowhere to go so I'm starting to\nget a picture where in order to have\nhealthy\nmuscle we need to think about the\nfeeding of that muscle the providing of\nnutrients to that muscle that is as well\nas the use of that muscle maybe let's\nstart with the feeding or the providing\nof nutrients to that muscle you\nmentioned that muscle at rest mainly\nBurns fatty acids it can store glycogen\nhow do we know when a muscle is full of\nglycogen I mean there's the the visual\nuh representation of the muscle seems\nFuller as opposed to flatter um you know\nbut these are um not specific um or\nthese are not um precise terms you know\nhow much carbohydrate does it take to\nfill all the muscle of the body with\nglycogen and then what sorts of things\nperhaps deplete that I think it's a\ngreat question we know that when we're\ntalking about glycogen the the liver\nstores glycogen maybe 100 grams and then\nskeletal muscle depending on your size\nfor example um you might store much more\nmuscle glycogen whether it's four 500\ngrams compared to someone who is my size\nand can we do the the standard\nconversion of four calories per gram so\nif the liver is 400 gr you know we just\nsay okay there's about 1,600 calories\nworth of yes of energy there so if I if\nI go out and I uh do some exercise and\nburn, 1600 calories over time does that\nmean that the the liver is then\ncompletely depleted so well the liver\nwill deplete in through an overnight\nfast so the liver's main the liver\nmaintains blood glucose so skeletal\nmuscle doesn't maintain blood glucose\ndirectly the way that you would leverage\nuh muscle glycogen would be through\nexercise the way in which you would\ndeplete muscle glycogen would be through\nmore um intensive exercise\nand when you think about the foods and\nthe way in which you know your original\nquestion is how would we know how much\nmuscle glycogen or how much we need to\nrefuel I typically think about it as\noverall activity levels so if someone is\nsedentary then the current\nrecommendation for carbohydrates would\nbe 130 grams a day per day per day at\nfour calories per gram at four calories\nper gram and is that um both simple and\ncomplex carbohydrates fibrous\ncarbohydrates yes it would just be\noverall\nif they completely sary so just a little\nbit of walk getting up going to the\ncomputer to the bathroom to the car Etc\nbut basically sedentary and the average\nAmerican takes in 300 grams of\ncarbohydrates a day so more than double\nand as you can imagine this\ncan distort metabolism when we think\nabout glucose disposal the way in which\nI think about glucose disposal if an\nindividual is sedentary is thinking\nabout how many carbohydrates an\nindividual can ingest at one time that\nwould mitigate uh insulin response and\nwould be able to be disposed of safely\nand that number is between 40 and 50\ngrams of carbohydrates at a meal outside\nof exercise the rest of carbohydrates\nwould be earned through exercise and\nthrough every hour of exercise depending\non the intensity that could be between\n40 to 70 gram depending on how intense\nan individual ual exercises and that\nwould be safely disposed\nof in a 2hour period I mean when you\nthink about an oral glucose tolerance\ntest that's a 75 gram load you assume\nwithin two hours that that blood sugar\nregulation should come back to a normal\nrange so at 40 to 50 grams of\ncarbohydrate every two hours does that\nmean that if somebody were to eat 40 to\n50 grams of carbohydrates every two\nhours which they shouldn't which they\nshouldn't but you're going to quickly\nexceed that 130 G per day and even if\nexercising with resistance training say\nhard for an hour um which you know can\nafford somebody maybe what another\ncouple hundred 300 grams of\ncarbohydrates probably not that much\nokay uh you know I I think that if\npeople care about body composition which\num I would say everyone should because\nyou want to have an appropriate level of\nbody fat and healthy skeletal muscle\nthen you wouldn't NE necessarily unless\nyou're doing some kind of cardiovascular\nactivity you're not using a ton of of\nmuscle glycogen depending on how much\nyou're training and how much glycogen is\nthe brain using so that is a that is a\ngood question um the brain uses um a lot\nof carbohydrates that would be the a\nprimary source when they come up with\nthe numbers of 130 it's really based on\nbrain and then the rest of the the body\ncan we safely say that for somebody\nthat's thinking a lot they need more\ncarbohydrates um you could say that then\nyour brain yes your brain is very\nmetabolically active interesting so\nwe're going of drawing rough estimates\nnot knowing people's body weight not\nknowing their body composition but what\nI'm arriving at here is you know if\nsomebody does a little bit of\ncardiovascular training maybe a little\nbit of light resistance training I'm\ndescribing the activities of many people\nout there maybe 250 gram of\ncarbohydrates you're kind of at the\nthreshold that's a lot that's that's a\nlot four four calories per gram um of\nthose carbohydrates and so let's say 200\ngram of carbohydrates per day um but\nthat's not a ton of calories overall so\nwhat should the remainder of the\ncalories be made up of so you know I\nthink what we're really talking about\nhere is how do we design a nutrition\nplan for people to have healthy skeleton\nmuscle right and you know if I were to\nsay okay what are we thinking about for\nthe listener or for the people out there\nthey're thinking you know I really want\nto have a healthy body composition and\nhealthy skeletal muscle mass the way in\nwhich they would do that is number one\nyou have to prioritize dietary protein\nso we're we're talking about\ncarbohydrates here but carbohydrates\nshouldn't be the primary focus nobody\nhas challenges getting carbohydrates in\n130 grams would be a safe recommendation\nif it someone is overweight or struggles\nwith type 2 diabetes or any of these\nother metabolic conditions there is\nevidence to support a lower carbohydrate\nintake I mean 130 G is you know one\nlittle micro packet of pretzels on an\nairplane ride you know so that that\nactually has probably closer to 37 grams\nof carbohydrates okay good not that I\nhad a pretzel packet before or threw one\nat Rob on the way in but no right okay\nso I'm way off there um uh so they have\na one of those a bagel in the morning\nand um they shouldn't but they uh but\nthey do and then they have some you know\npasta at dinner and so most people are\nprobably exceeding that 130 gram by a\nhuge margin yes they are and um there's\na couple things there that it's really\nimportant that you said is that\nindividuals when we're thinking about\ndesigning a plan for skeletal muscle\nHealth that first meal is most important\nthat first meal of the day having\ndietary protein will set you up\nmetabolically for the rest of the day\nand when you say first meal and we'll\ntalk a little bit later about\nintermittent fasting and you know I for\ninstance eat my first meal at usually\n11: a.m. it's just kind of how I'm wired\nI've never wanted to eat breakfast first\nthing I've forced myself to eat some\neggs first thing in the morning from\ntime to time and it felt fine but do you\nrecommend that people eat a true\nbreakfast like within a certain number\nof hours of waking up for sake of muscle\nHealth that and and metabolic Health\nwhen we think about um that first meal I\nfrankly don't care when you have it one\nalso has to understand that you're\ncoming out of an overnight fast if you\nare young and healthy then the timing of\nthat first meal likely doesn't matter\nbecause you're\nrobust your body is very efficient and\ncapable to withstand um protein deg\ndegradation it's able to withstand\nprotein degradation and protein turnover\nwhich is ultimately why we're eating so\nthat's one reason why we're eating and\nwe'll talk a little bit more about that\nthat first meal of the day if you are\nyoung and healthy the timing doesn't\nreally matter matter and I would say\nwhen it begins to matter is when you're\nolder when you are in your 60s fat\ncontinuing to fast may be a negative\nnegative for muscle muscle Health that\nfirst meal of the\nday is important because we know that\nwhen you get between 40 and 50 grams of\nprotein that first meal of the day you\nstimulate muscle protein synthesis\nmuscle protein synthesis is by proxy\nwhat we use to measure um as a marker\nfor overall muscle Health now there's a\nlot of history here when we think about\ndesigning a a meal plan that first meal\nhas between we'll say give it between 30\nto 50 grams of dietary protein that will\ndo a number of things number one it will\nstimulate skeletal muscle what we would\nconsider the health of skeletal muscle\nit also will affect the brain it'll\nimprove satiation you and I were talking\npreviously it releases um a handful of\nuh gut peptides like gluc gone like\npeptide one which later we'll talk about\nMonaro C py things that will affect\nappetite uh for that second meal and\nthis there's some very interesting\nresearch out out of Heather Li's lab and\nbasically when she put individuals\nyounger uh adolescents on a meal of 30\nto 40 grams of protein they were much\nless likely to choose say Donuts or\nsomething uh outside of what we consider\na healthy nutrition plan later in the\nday or in the same meal later in the day\nso um is essentially augmenting their\nwillpower okay so it sounds like for\nyoung people they can delay breakfast if\nthey want for older people probably not\nbut that the first meal of the day\nshould include what you're calling\ndietary protein 30 to 50 grams yes and\nmaybe we should talk about the quality\nof that protein because I think a lot of\npeople understand that there are meat\nproteins there are plant proteins how\nimportant is the quality of that protein\nthis tends to be a Hot Topic and\nsomewhat very controversial great when\ngreat for you I know great for everybody\nI mean controversy on this podcast is um\nis embraced uh in the following way we\nState what we know we State what we\ndon't know and we are always happy to\nreturn to the conversation in a future\ntime to adjust any uh uh stances based\non the data and how we evolve as people\nso okay well I love that yeah um dietary\nprotein we speak about it as if it's one\nthing but actually it's 20 different\namino acids nine of which are essential\nthe rest we can generate in our body and\nwhen we think about skeletal muscle we\nthink about the essential amino acids\nand the essential amino acids primarily\nfor skeletal muscle Health are the\nbranch chain amino acids Lucine being\none of those so Lucine is uniquely\nstimulating to skeletal muscle and when\nyou have enough Lucine it triggers\nmuscle protein synthesis and when you\nsay stimulating and muscle protein\nsynthesis I think a lot of people get a\npicture in their mind of a muscle\ngrowing but no you're not necessarily\ntalking about that you're talking about\nthe organ that is\nmuscle um that it's Health it's\nmetabolism being cultivated so that it\ncan do all the hormone endocrine related\nthings and the glucose disposal related\nthings that we'll get into in a bit more\ndetail later is that right yeah and so\nwhen you have a breakfast of 30 to 50\ngrams you appropriately stimulate muscle\nprotein synthesis and one has to\nrecognize that if you eat below that\nthreshold you do not stimulate the\nhealth of that skeletal muscle you do\nnot stimulate muscle in a a way that\nwould be necessary for outcomes that\nmatter and outcomes that matter are\nsarcopenia outcomes that matter are body\ncomposition prevention of obesity you\nmust get this nutrition right it's the\nthing that 100% of people do is eat as\nmany of you know I've been taking ag1\nfor more than 10 years now so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring this\npodcast to be clear I don't take ag1\nbecause they're a sponsor rather they\nare a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact\nI take ag1 once and often twice every\nsingle day and I've done that since\nstarting way back in 2012 there is so\nmuch conflicting information out there\nnowadays about what proper nutrition is\nbut here's what there seems to be a\ngeneral consensus on whether you're an\nomnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a\nvegan I think it's generally agreed that\nyou should get most of your food from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources which allows you to eat enough\nbut not over eat get plenty of vitamins\nand minerals probiotics and\nmicronutrients that we all need for\nphysical and mental health now I\npersonally am an omnivore and I strive\nto get most of my food from unprocessed\nor minimally processed sources but the\nreason I still take ag1 once and often\ntwice every day is that it ensures I get\nall of those vitamins minerals\nprobiotics Etc but it also has a\nadaptogens to help me cope with stress\nit's basically a nutritional insurance\npolicy meant to augment not replace\nquality food so by drinking a serving of\nag1 in the morning and again in the\nafternoon or evening I cover all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nreport feeling much better in a number\nof important ways such as energy levels\ndigestion sleep and more so while many\nsupplements out there are really\ndirected towards obtaining one specific\noutcome ag1 is foundational nutrition\ndesigned to support all aspects of\nwell-being related to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink a1.com huberman to\nclaim a special offer they'll give you\nfive free travel packs with your order\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman it's great that we're focusing\non muscle and then referring to obesity\nbecause I think so many people virtually\neverybody thinks okay reduce body fat\nhow do you do that you get the calories\nin calories out equation in a certain\ndirection and by the way I believe in\nthe law of thermodynamics and um\ncalories in calories out but by focusing\non muscle protein synthesis and muscle\nHealth through the ingestion of quality\nprotein early in the day I see that\nyou're entering this all through it\nthrough a different Channel but at the\nend points of reduced body fat Etc as\nwe'll get into later um one can still\narrive there so just for practical\npurposes what are some excellent sources\nof quality protein for that first meal\num well now the quality of protein is\ndefined by the amino acid composition\nand typically animal-based proteins have\nhigher quality these are hard fast\nbiological numbers the dietary protein\nin say um a steak is very similar to the\nprotein amino acid in skeletal muscle so\nthe quality of the proteins like eggs\nlike whey protein like beef like poultry\nThose comp compositions are similar to\nthe human body composition so they\ncontain the amino acids in the\nappropriate ratios for skeletal muscle\nHealth now plant-based proteins have a\ndifferent composition and they have a\ncomposition obviously similar to plants\nand one can get enough of the essential\namino acids if the total caloric load of\nthat protein is high enough and I think\nthat that's important to recognize\nbecause right now the American diet is\n70% plant-based and we are we seem to be\nmoving more towards a plant-based diet\nright I mean I know there's sort of a\nmovement toward that you hear about\nplant-based but so most people are not\neating steak and eggs for breakfast we\nknow that well most people when I say a\n70% plant-based diet I'm talking about\nuh refined carbohydrates sugars ref oils\nand when we think about it so that 70%\nof um our diet comes from that where 30%\ncomes from animal-based\nproteins which contain a ton of\nnutrients like bioavailable zinc and\nselenium B12 but when it comes to muscle\nHealth one could as long as they are\nthinking about making sure that the\noverall protein load is high enough in\nthat plant-based protein for example um\none would not choose\nquinoa as a protein source so quinoa\nwould six cups of quinoa would equal the\nsame as one small chicken breast when it\ncomes to an amino acid profile so I\nthink one has to be aware that\nplant-based proteins typically have\ncarbohydrates that ride along with them\nand and that just becomes important for\noverall metabolic control when we think\nabout total caloric load and total\ncarbohydrates someone could use a rice\npea blend of protein for that first meal\nuh that would certainly be sufficient\ncertainly if someone is um geared\ntowards a more plant-based Di and\ndoesn't want to consume animal proteins\nthat's what I would\nuse is there any evidence that combining\na highquality protein with carbohydrate\nin that first meal is more or less\nbeneficial than having the protein alone\nthat's a good question I would say that\nwe don't have evidence for that that it\nwould be more beneficial because the\nquestion would be what what is the\nbenefit that we're looking\nfor if the benefit that one is looking\nfor is diversity then certainly because\nwe know carboh hydrates can have fiber\nphytonutrients if you're going to\ncombine it with berries that could\ncertainly be advantageous but not\nnecessary what becomes interesting is\nwhen we think about designing a diet\ndoes that second meal matter and not to\nget too technical but maybe I'll we\ncould get a little technical here is\nthat when you stimulate muscle protein\nsynthesis that will last about 2 to\nthree\nhours now the next thing one would think\nis well I know that I need a certain\namount of protein for overall muscle\nHealth the amount of protein for overall\nmuscle Health could be anywhere from 1\ngram per pound ideal body weight to\nlower and when we think about how we are\ndesigning a diet we have to recognize\nthat the current recommendations are the\nminimum to prevent a deficiency the way\nin which diets are designed now\naccording to the RDA is 8 grams per\nkg8 gram of protein per kilogram of body\nweight which comes out body weight yes\nwhich comes out to be 37 G per pound so\nif someone was 115 PB female that\ncurrent RDA would be 45 grams of protein\nway below what we talked about earlier\nand this is these are very important\nConcepts to understand the foundations\nof how we think about dietary protein\nthe current RDA which is a minimum to\nprevent a deficiency is based on\nnitrogen balance nitrogen balance and by\nthe way the recommendations for protein\nthat were set in the 80s have not\nchanged which means one of two things we\nhaven't had new science come out or we\njust haven't recognized the importance\nof protein and I think that it's more\nlikely the latter that we have not yet\nrecognized even though there's a\nplethora of data and I worked on some of\nthese earlier studies which you know\nI'll share I even brought the numbers to\nmake sure that I said them right because\nuh you know this is the human Lab\npodcast well I've I've made I've made uh\nnumerical errors before on the podcast\nuh but great that you brought the\nnumbers we always try and correct any\nerrors but great to be precise the first\ntime so thank you you know when we think\nabout how we design a diet for optimal\nmuscle health is very different than how\nwe design a diet for um again just life\nand the two are very different the RDA\nfor Lucine which is that essential amino\nacid meaning we cannot make it we must\nget it from the diet is set at 2.7 gram\nper day that's a trivial amount that is\na trivial amount and 2.7 gram 2 total\nper day per day and one must understand\nthat this came from nitrogen balance\nstudies and typically those are young\nmen 18-year-old\nmen that does not support healthy aging\nor anyone that is struggling with\nobesity or any kind of chronic illness\nor anything and so then when we begin to\nthink well what do we actually need the\nevidence would support two to three\ntimes that amount closer to 9 n gam of\nLucine per day and just to calibrate us\nn gram of\nLucine again is essential amino acid we\ncan only get from food per day what does\nthat equate to in terms of the total\namount of let's say egg or steak protein\nthat one would need to eat in order to\nensure that just rough roughly yes\nwonderful question so there's a meal\nthreshold for skeletal muscle health and\nthat meal threshold is a minimum of 30\ngr now that would equal a four 4 and A2\nounce steak um dare I say six eggs which\nis a lot of eggs at one time or a scoop\nof whey protein scoop of whey protein\nmight have 18 grams of protein and two\nand a half grams of Lucine maybe you do\na 25 gram whey protein shake and that\nbecomes important to understand because\nit is a meal threshold amount you know\nwe are talking about you know the reason\nwhy I was so excited to come on this\npodcast is because I think that if we\ncan correct our new nutrition and we\ngear it towards skeletal muscle Health\nthen we can change the trajectory of\naging and we can stop focusing on\nObesity and really focus on skeletal\nmuscle Health but the only way that\nwe're going to do that is if we get this\nnutrition right because skeletal muscle\nrequires dietary protein there's only\ntwo main ways that we can stimulate\nskeletal muscle and that is through\nexercise primarily resistance training\nand dietary protein and so when we think\nabout how we design a diet if you look\nback at the history we have to recognize\na handful of things number one that\nthese essential amino acids primarily\nLucine is necessary to trigger muscle\nprotein synthesis number one number two\nthat aging impairs the efficiency of\nmuscle protein synthesis I see so it's a\nrunaway train if you start getting\nsarcopenia if there's obesity and other\nmarkers of Aging I realize obesity can\noccur at Young ages too but muscle loss\nthen basically you're Al you're losing\nmuscle quality AK protein synthesis and\nother things\nand as a consequence it makes it harder\nto increase muscle quality so you have\nto Short Circuit this pretty early um\nyes and I would even say that we talk\nabout sarcopenia as a disease of Aging\nbut I think that there is a youthful\nphenotype of sarcopenia if we Define\nsarcopenia as decreased muscle mass and\nstrength that can easily affect our\nyouth you know we talk about health span\nwe talk about lifespan there's also\nmuscle\nspan and muscle span is this concept\nthat um is really about the skeletal\nmuscle Health as we age and there's\nthree primary components to that that's\nunderstanding that skeletal muscle\nHealth begins very early on and we're\ngoing to talk about um because I know\nthat there's parents I have two little\nkids so I I want to talk about the\namount of protein necessary for children\nof course and then as we think about\nthis muscle span there is early on early\nage where you're laying down the\nfoundation where you're hopefully\ntraining doing exercise just doing\nmovement\nbeing sedentary is a disease state in\nand of itself period end of story being\nsedentary is not the opposite of\nactivity being sedentary is in in and of\nitself a diseasome of\ninactivity then midlife we have to\nmaintain the tissue we get a peak muscle\nmass in our 30s we get a peak bone mass\naround the same time and then that later\nhalf of life we have to do everything\nthat we can to maintain that tissue\nbecause of this decrease in efficiency\nof skeletal muscle so skeletal muscle as\na nutrient sensing organ can respond\nlike youthful tissue and the way that it\nresponds like youthful tissue from an\namino acid perspective just thinking\nabout how we eat to maintain that is\nthat when we increase our dietary\nprotein so older individuals or\nindividual as they age require more\nprotein to then stimulate mtor so does\nthat mean instead of eating 30 grams of\nprotein per meal minimum\nthat people older than say 50 60 should\neat 40 or 50 grams of prot I say that\nthat's true interesting and by the way\nskeletal muscle will mount a youthful\nresponse there's um you know this was uh\nthe initial work was out of uh Bob\nWolf's lab he's an icon in the industry\nof protein he's one of the can I say\ngrandfathers now I mean that's pretty\nembarrassing when I think about Bob wolf\nand Don Layman and these guys you know I\ntrained with Dr Donald Layman you know\nthese initial studies that we think\nabout and we take for granted dietary\nprotein we think okay well the Bros have\nalways known this but we have not and\nwhen you are younger there is a somewhat\nof a linear response let's say um a\nyounger individual still growing we'll\njust call them 10 12 years old or or my\nchildren I have a three and a four and a\nhalfy old\nthey will respond with 5 gr of dietary\nprotein 10 gam of dietary protein 15\ngram of dietary\nprotein versus an older individual will\nnot respond at all to that however that\nresponse can be augmented by increasing\nthe dietary protein at that meal so an\nolder individual will respond like an a\nyounger individual\nby 30 grams of protein 30 to to 50 later\nwe're going to talk about supplements\nbut I'm very\ncurious is there a place for\nsupplementing Lucine and other Branch\nchain amino acids specifically you know\nI always assumed that supplementing with\nBranch chain amino acids was kind of the\nunique domain of people you know post\nexercise trying to build more muscle but\nas you're telling me all this it seems\nthat adding Lucine in powder form to a\nmeal seems like it would be great for\nmuscle health is that true um I would\nsay that we do not add Lucine alone okay\nbecause Lucine isol leucine and veine go\nhand in hand it would not be advisable\nto add a single amino\nacid the amino acid levels are\nmaintained in the blood by adding more\nof one would have effects on the other\nthe way in which I would think about\nsupplementing essential amino acids and\nor Branch Chains would be if an IND\nidual is choosing to have a lower\nprotein meal I remember when I was in\nresidency the food choices were not very\ngood and maybe I had 2 ounces of fish\nwhich wasn't enough to bring me up to a\nthreshold that would be a place that I\nwould add in Branch chain amino acids or\nessential amino acids that would bring\nsomeone's amino acid threshold up but we\nhave to understand everything that we're\ndoing we should be doing with a purpose\nthe idea of just sipping on Branch chain\namino acids or just adding Amino acids\nwould be the equivalent of putting a key\ninto a car and trying to turn the car on\nbut not having any additional substrate\nso you need the full spectrum of all the\namino acids to affect skeletal muscle\nHealth yeah well that's um reassuring to\nhear because I love the taste of\nscrambled eggs and steaks and I also\nlike tuna and I also like chicken and I\nI love all those all those things um and\nI have to imagine that as you mentioned\nbefore there are other things in these\nquality and animal proteins like you\nmentioned um selenium you mentioned\nother perhaps essential fatty acids and\nother vitamins that perhaps have\nsomething to do with what the animal\ningested during its life that also\nbenefit muscle is that true it it is and\nthe the big standout to me is creatine\nwe know that creatine at five grams of\ncreatine will affect skeletal muscle but\n12 grams of creatine affects brain\nhealth and there's a lot of interesting\nresearch coming out on um creatine and\nbrain health C can you remind me the\nrough um amounts of creatine and say you\nmentioned a let's just I mean I must say\na 4 and a half ounce steak feels um\nrather poultry to me um that's probably\nthe size of which is a huge meal to me\nright um right so let's say a 6 oun\nlet's be generous a 6 oun steak or um\nfour scrambled eggs I mean how much\ncreatine are we talking eggs don't have\nmuch creatine right not much and um and\nI I was just recently looking at this\nthe amount of creatine in a pound of\nsteak you're going to cringe is is\nsomething like two grams so it's not\nvery much it's not very much but when we\nthink about eating Foods as in a food\nMatrix what you're saying is absolutely\ntrue that it's interesting we don't eat\nsingle nutrients while we think about\ndietary protein as um a single nutrient\nand we think about carbohydrates but\nwhat we really do is we eat mixed meals\nand when we think about that\nthe the quality of the protein Matters\nfrom a protein perspective could you get\nplant-based proteins and animal-based\nproteins and could it be equal yes it\ncould so I want to be very clear to say\nand have a very balanced perspective\nthat we could get all of our dietary\nprotein from plants from plant-based\nsources uh a few caveats there is that\nthat RDA that I gave you earlier is\nbased only on high quality\nproteins and that being the minimum to\nprevent a deficiency if an indiv ual was\nplant-based they would require closer to\n1.6 gram per kg a higher amount of total\nprotein if it's coming from plants and\nthat that becomes important to\nunderstand speaking of an Ideal World if\nyou had a magic wand I do what would be\nthe um my kids think I do I bet you do\num what would be the amount of protein\nthat you would have everybody eat what\nin terms of a number of grams per pound\nor kilogram of body weight that's\nactually an easy question one gram per\npound ideal body weight total body\nweight not ideal body weight actually\nwhere you want to be if an individual is\n200 lb but but would prefer to be 150\nlbs then I would have them eat towards\ntheir ideal body weight there's no\nevidence that a higher protein diet is\ndetrimental to Kidney Health to bone\nhealth and we use these terms Loosely\nlike a high protein diet when we have to\nrecognize that 8 gram per kg is a low\nprotein diet so where did the idea come\nfrom that if you eat say 1 gram of\nquality protein per pound of ideal body\nweight that you're going to get gout\nyou're going to have liver issues you're\ngoing to have all sorts of issues where\ndid that idea come from uh frankly I'm\nnot I'm not sure but the conversation\naround dietary protein has probably been\nthe most controversial what why do you\nthink that is I mean we don't we're not\ntrying to get political here I'm just so\ncurious some ideas but uh I I won't them\nbut I I do feel as\nif um nutrition is not just Science\nNutrition is complicated because it's\nsomething that people tie emotion to\nthey tie religion to they there's um a\nlot that goes into dietary protein and\nfood recommendations in general but it\nsounds like we can safely say that if\nyou eat 1 gram of protein per pound of\nideal body weight that you're not going\nto cause liver damage get gout or\nincrease your risk of cancer right my\nunderstanding is that even if it comes\nfrom red meat there's no increase in\nrisk of cancer is that right well um\nhere's what I would say to that I would\nsay that this idea about red meat and\ncancer number one we would have to even\nDefine what kind of cancers that we're\ntalking about there's many different\ntypes of cancers and there's many\ndifferent causes it would be important\nto understand what risk factors are and\na primary risk factor to many cancers is\nobesity the the question then becomes\nhow do we design a diet that mitigates\nobesity the evidence is also very clear\nthat a more protein forward diet\noptimizes body composition and you\ncombine that with resistance training\nand you will see a tremendous amount of\nchange I worked on some of these early\nstudies and I I'll share with you some\nof the um early studies and this came\nout of Don Layman's lab with University\nof Illinois both you and L Norton both\nwork there did you overlap there we did\nhe what was he like no just came so\nlet's just say he sat in the back of the\nclass and I sat in the front okay all\nright there you heard it shots\nfired and all kidding s Side Lane is a\nvery he's like my brother we've known\neach other for 20 some years and he's a\nvery popular guest former guest on this\npodcast and a very spirited guy and I I\njust like to say I don't know why his\nskin looks that good but\num whatever so I love you Lane I worked\non yes we do I worked on some of these\nearly studies and this was these studies\nwere some of the first studies to come\nout about dietary protein nutrition and\nresistance training in in fact to my\nknowledge and to I think the knowledge\nof many of my colleagues this was the\nfirst study and what it was it was um a\nit was a 12-month study 130 overweight\nmen and women so it was robust and\nbasically what they did is they had um\ntwo groups one group was a food guide\npyramid diet so it was 55 G of\ncarbohydrates a RDA of protein which was\n8 G per\nkg and 30% fat 30% fat was in both\ngroups the second group was 40%\ncarbohydrates this is remember the Zone\ndiet 40 3030 yeah I liked that diet okay\nI mean there's EV is I mean I don't\nfollow it anymore but you know I tried\nit for a little while and and it works\ngreat and there's some evidence to\nsupport that that is a great ratio for\npeople coming off the lowfat era of the\n'90s the Zone diet felt like um the best\nthing ever because it was like oh you\nknow you can enjoy some fats and wow\nyour satiety is improved and um you get\nstronger you just feel better when\nyou're ingesting some ideally quality\nfats that's my experience anyway and\nalso we know that it influences hormonal\nstatus you don't want to push uh fats\ntoo low so the second group had a 40330\nsplit so it was 40 gr of carbohydrates\n30 gram of protein 30 gr or 30 % fat so\nthese are all percentages yeah 40 30 40%\nnow we\ndidn't talk so much about the\ndistribution but what is really\nimportant to understand is they were\nisocaloric so they both had the same\ncalories the difference was the\npercentage of where the calories came\nfrom and how they were given um and\nthere was actually four different arms\nto this so there was individuals that\nexercised and individuals that didn't\nokay so either zone diet or let's call\nit I hate to say this but more stand\nthat's how it was designed standard\nAmerican versus Zone diet so it was\ndesigned that way and then exercising or\nnon- exercising for for each of the for\nthis 12 month study um and by the way I\nhad to to pack a bunch of meals it was\nnot pretty and I had to do urine\nanalysis it was terrible um but anyway\nthis besides the point so the first\ngroup had um a protein distribution of\n10 grams in the morning 15 at lunch and\n45 at dinner kind of standard American\nSte for din some cereal for breakfast\nwith a little bit of milk and then for\nlunch like a sandwich exactly and so\nthis mirrors what people do the other\ngroup had 45 grams of protein at that\nfirst meal six five six eggs five six\neggs um 35 grams of protein at lunch and\n35 grams of protein chicken breast and a\nsalad at lunch with a little piece of\ntoast and then at dinner how much um it\nwas it was 35 gram all right a piece of\nfish and some rice and a vegetable but\nit was an even distribution so what\nyou're seeing here is now these meals\nare meeting a loosing threshold of\nmuscle protein synthesis now it's 100\nthis is collectively 130 individuals and\nthey were they were older um I think\nthat they were all in their 40s or\nBeyond if we just compare first the\ngroups that did not exercise two\ndifferent diets what what did they see\nwhat did you see you participated in\nthis yeah un yes I did and almost said\nun unforunately no I I won't um but what\nwas so interesting is that those\nindividuals everybody lost weight so the\naverage weight loss um gosh I wish I had\nbetter handwriting but I'm a doctor and\nso it's pretty bad um the average weight\nloss was 24% greater in the high protein\ngroup so they lost 24% and you said it\nwas isocaloric between the two groups\nbut was it subc caloric overall I mean\npeople were five that's a very smart yes\nit was 500 calories less than what they\nneeded to maintain body weight correct\nokay got it so 24% more weight loss\ntotal total in the group that\ndistributed their protein evenly in and\nfollowed the So-Cal Zone Diet 40 3030\nand they lost more\nfat than the high carbohydrate group so\nthe high protein group lost uh a total\nof 16 pounds versus the calorie\ncontrolled group lost 11 pounds of fat\nof fat which is great everyone's at home\nthinking this is wonderful isocaloric\nisocaloric but the the thing here is the\nlean body mass change so again this was\ndone using dexa and we know dexa only\nlooks at lean body mass you mentioned\ndexa earlier just very briefly is dexa\nhow does dexa work not not not at a\nmechanistic level what what does it look\nlike I go into the clinic am I floating\nin water am I holding I'm holding the\nthe paddles you might be because you're\nAndrew hubin no no no but um you hold\nthe paddles and it um and you're\nstanding on something it's what's it so\nDEA you just lay on depending on the\nmachine you can just lay on this machine\nand it's a a dual X-ray and it it um\nmeasures bone fat and then lean body\nmass okay that's sufficient for this\nconversation great so the lean body mass\num lost and again this is everything\nother than bone and body fat so that was\n34% in which group uh in the standard\nAmerican diet group okay versus 26% in\nthe high protein group now where it gets\nfascinating so what the big takeaway is\nis understanding that protein had a\nsparing effect protein protected muscle\nmore body fat loss at the same caloric\namounts yes same amount of deficit\nrelative to body weight right in this\ngroup exercise was not introduced so\nthis was purely the food guide pyramid\num changing protein in the\nmorning versus having it at um two small\nmeals and then having it at dinner and\ndid they emphasize what we're calling\nhigh quality protein they did okay that\nis also very important fish eggs chicken\nET yes they did so then this led to\nanother study so then the second study\nwas a 2 by two design and this is oh\nsorry sorry to interrupt in that\nprevious study what was the effect of\nexercise between so we didn't they\ndidn't do exercise sorry that was my\nfault we they did not do exercise they\nwere just doing whatever that it was\nthat they were doing um but what was so\nimportant to understand was that this\nset the stage for this idea that protein\nhad a sparing effect\nand then following\nthat the other studies so then there was\na series of a few other\nstudies um the second study looked at\ndiet and exercise so this combined\neffect so this was one of the first\nstudies and this was 48 women with a BMI\nof 33 46 years old so this is your post\nPerry postmenopausal woman who um was\neither in one of four treatment groups a\nlow protein group low protein with\nexercise\nhigh protein high protein with exercise\nthe low protein group was defined as the\nRDA 8 gr the high protein group was\ndefined as 1.6\ngram kg so starting to approach that one\ngram per pound it's about seven gram\nyeah so starting to get there but not\nquite there yeah so this was um a 16\nweeks study and what they found\noverall was that the high protein group\nlost 18% more body fat and 25% less lean\nmass overall and 12% more total body\nweight and so now we start moving into\nthis synergistic effect of dietary\nprotein and resistance training and it\nwas the type of exercise that they\nperformed there resistance training this\nis the good news it didn't take much it\nwas 5 days a week of walking 30 minutes\nand two days a week of resistance\ntraining with just body weight it was\nlike yoga activity so air squats down\ndogs some Warrior poses maybe some\nhandstand attempts so\nyeah are you doing handstand I've been\nto some yoga classes where I look to the\nsides of me and people are doing some\npretty difficult things lanches and\nthings like that definitely not me do\nnot invite me life is better this way\nI'm not going to those classes but 16\nweeks they did a high protein with\nprotein and exercise those individuals\nso now so the the study the the group\nthat I just mentioned this was dietary\nintervention alone with exercise High\nProtein Plus exercise very simple\nexercise so if someone is listening to\nthis and they're thinking what can I do\nto make very practical changes to\nmassively impact my life outside of\nhormone replacement outside of any super\nself outside of anything diet in\nexercise has a dramatic effect those\nindividuals that were doing 1.6 gram per\nkg which is 7 gram per pound of body\nweight plus exercise lost 46% more body\nweight that's substantial 60% more\nfat and 40% less fat-free\nMass from organs you know muscle\nwhatever that is you know compared to\nthe low protein group plus exercise and\nwas it sub caloric were they below below\nmain weight it was so they're eating to\nideal body weight um but still 500\ncalories or so below their current\ncaloric needs to maintain body weight so\nI've heard before that um when we eat\nprotein a certain amount of energy is\nrequired to metabolize that protein can\nthat be translated as you know um the\ncaloric load of protein is not what it\nappears to be yes you know if let's say\nuh that 6 o steak I'm making this up\nI'll probably get the numbers badly\nwrong but if it's um you know um 6\nounces of steak and maybe that's a let's\njust say a 450 calories or 500 calories\ndoes that mean that only 400 of those\ncalories are actually quote unquote\nutilized um what you're talking about is\nthe thermic effect of food the thermic\neffect of feeding and that's the idea\nthat certain macronutrients require a\ncertain percentage of energy or the\nenergy from those calories to be\nutilized for fat it's something like 3%\nfor carbohydrates maybe it's 5 to 10%\nand then for protein it could be\nanywhere from 20 to I've seen even\nstudies that are at 30% wow I know but\nhere is the thing it's not that it's the\nenergy that it takes so if we were going\nto make it simple we'll say 100 calories\nfrom straight protein the body would net\n80 calories because 20% of that energy\nis being used for what I would say is\nmuscle protein\nsynthesis it's not the handling of\nnitrogen it's none of that and there's\nvariations in the literature and the\nvariations come from how an individual\ndoses protein so the dosing depending if\nyou've hit that minimum of 30 grams then\nyou will see a more optimal utilization\nof protein and I think that that's where\nthat number comes from it's actually the\nstimulation of\nmuscle because that is such an energetic\nprocess in and of itself I'd like to\ntake a quick break and acknowledge our\nsponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals now\nI've long been a believer in getting\nregular blood work done for the simple\nreason that many of the factors that\nimpact your immediate and long-term\nHealth can only be analyzed from a\nquality blood test\nnow a major problem with a lot of blood\ntests out there is that you get\ninformation back about metabolic factors\nand hormones and lipids and so forth but\nyou don't know what to do with that\ninformation with inside tracker they\nmake it very easy to know what to do\nwith those numbers because they have a\npersonalized platform that allows you to\nsee the levels of those metabolic\nfactors lipids hormones Etc and they\ngive you specific directives that you\ncan follow related to nutrition\nbehavioral modification supplementation\nand more that can help you bring those\nnumbers into the ranges that are optimal\nfor you\nif you'd like to try insid tracker you\ncan go to insid tracker.com huberman to\nget 10% off their new membership program\ninsid tracker membership offers\nsignificantly reduced

talking about why is it that\nif I eat a plate of scrambled eggs or a\nsteak or a chicken breast and some\nvegetables I feel very\nsaded um and unless I did some hard\nresistance training I'm kind of good\nwith that but that if I eat any of those\nsame foods and one piece of a baguette\nor one fork full of pasta that then I\nwant a lot more pasta and I want half\nthe loaf of bread why is that is it the\nblood glucose response is there\nsomething about carbohydrate at the\nlevel of the mouth I mean what is it you\nknow former guest on this podcast Dr\nDiego borquez who studies gut brain\nsensing explained to us and this is\nseparate from the microbiome that we\nhave receptors all along the length of\nour gut from our mouth out to the rectum\nthat are sensing the amino acids and are\nlooking for those essential amino acids\nbut also sensing sugar and things like\nthat and signaling to the brain about\nhow much more we should eat of a given\nfood or forage for a given food and I\njust have to say at a psychological\nlevel subjective level there's something\nso fundamentally different about eating\nprotein and veget vegetables or protein\nfruits and\nvegetables in the absence of starchy\ncarbohydrates and one adds starchy\ncarbohydrates or eat starchy\ncarbohydrates alone and it's like it's\nnot a runaway train but it's almost as\nif like it's never quite enough until\nthere's a physical volume in the gut\nthat is like at threshold and I don't\nthink I'm alone in this you look at the\nway people eat chips you look at the way\npeople eat pasta you look at the way\npeople eat risoto and it's just\ndifferent I mean there are a few you\nknow freaks out there that probably to\nribeye Stakes but for most people a\nribeye steak is like enough one ribey is\nenough what is going on there and and\nfeel free to speculate but is it amino\nacid sensing and because I think this is\nreally important because I think as\nyou're suggesting if I may that people\nprioritize protein from the first meal\nof the day and throughout the\nday you know I think people are\nimagining well gosh what happens to my\npasta what happens to the bread what\nhappens to all these things and you know\nthey're perhaps overlooking the fact\nthat eating protein vegetables and maybe\nfruit maybe a little bit of starch is\njust a a completely different experience\nthan eating starch alone or starch in in\nlarger volumes there now I'm going to\nspeculate here the foods that we have\naccess to are highly palatable and\npotentially we weren't necessarily\ndesigned to have access to those kinds\nof foods um and this kind of moves into\nthis idea of something called the\nprotein leverage hypothesis and the\nleverage hypothesis is that individuals\nwill continue to eat and this is one way\npeople explain obesity is that\nindividuals will eat to satisfy an amino\nacid need now your original question was\nwhen we eat um carbohydrates or risoto\nuh there is a component of blood sugar\nregulation that happens so as you go\nbeyond that 50 gram threshold you tend\nto release more insulin so there's an\ninsulinogenic effect of dietary\ncarbohydrates which some people will\nexperience as lower blood sugar we've\nall had that experience where you're I\nmean not all but you know e eating your\nkids macaroni and cheese and then you\njust can't stop and then you probably\nfeel very\ntired there's an eban flow of blood\nsugar the interesting thing about\ndietary protein is you will hear people\nsay I'm going to reduce my dietary\nprotein because it's insulinogenic as\nwell so dietary protein does does cause\na phase one insulin release and that's\npre-formed insulin in the pancreas it is\na component uh for muscle protein\nsynthesis but it is roughly 20% of the\ninsulin\nresponse than the same amount of\ncarbohydrates and when you eat a pro a a\nmeal that is robust and dietary protein\nyour body will be able to then generate\nits own glucose roughly for every 100\ngrams of protein your body will generate\n60 grams of glucose over a period of\ntime through the process called glucon\nGenesis and that is one of the benefits\nof a higher protein diet you generate\nthe glucose that you need and can that\nbe converted into glycogen can repack\nmuscle that you've that is a good\nquestion the process is very slow so\nit's a it's a much slower process than\nif you were to have your bread or\nrisotto so you told us about essential\namino acids are there any essential\ncarbohydrates no there are essential\nfatty acids yeah there are and you know\nit's interesting we're talking about\nprotein and as as I mentioned before we\nsimplified in the way that we talk about\nit is it's one thing but it's 20\ndifferent amino acids these amino acids\neach have unique metabolic roles in the\nbody it's not interchangeable for\nexample the essential amino acid will'll\njust pick a brain one uh tryptophan for\nserotonin production or threonine for\nmucin production in the gut which helps\nthe gut lining or you know take your\npick phenyalanine\nthese all of these essential amino acids\ndo various things in the body for\nskeletal muscle the primary essential\namino acid is\nLucine and while again it is very\ncomplex in the way that we would think\nabout how do we eat enough lysine or how\ndo we eat enough\nmethionine it's not a great way to think\nabout because then Things become very\ncomplex and someone is like well what do\nI do but if you eat for the needs of\nskeletal muscle Health everything else\nfalls into place my mom is 79 years old\nshe's relatively lean um by my read I\nhaven't um seen her dexa results but\nshe's probably had some muscular atrophy\nshe does yoga she walks she Gardens um\nand seems to be in good health thank\nthank goodness\nmy guess is she's lost some muscle in\nthe last decades if she were to increase\nthe amount of protein quality protein\nthat she eats especially in that first\nmeal of the day um would the health of\nher muscle and her muscle mass change\neven if she does no resistance exercise\nI I suppose she gets a little bit of\nresistance training from the yoga but I\nhaven't been to a yoga class with my mom\never you guys aren't doing headstands\ndefinitely not doing headstands she's\nactually you know she's she's very\nmobile and very sharp and um very\nvivacious um\nbut I don't think she's doing the the\nmore you know Advanced inversion things\nat yoga so let's assume that um she's\ndoing some moderate exercise three three\nfour times a week but not training with\nweights if somebody like her or a you\nknow a younger male that has a similar\npattern of behavior you know desk worker\nfor the most part uh jogs a little bit\ngets on the on the Recumbent Bike or\nwhatever it is but is not um doing\nresistance training increases is their\nquality protein intake um throughout the\nday and especially at that first meal\nensuring at least 30 and up to 50 grams\nof intake what changes are likely to\nhappen even without resistance exercise\num well the first thing is that if she\nis eating a sub amount of protein let's\nsay she's eating the Rd of protein and\nthe average woman eats around 68 grams\nof protein a day 40% of women over the\nage of 60 are deficient in protein\nthey're eating below the RDA and what's\nhappening to their body is their body\nrobbing their existing skeletal muscle\nof amino acids in order to supply what\nthe brain and other organs need in part\nin part one of the things that happens\nwith aging is the body the whole body\nprotein turnover\nbecomes um less efficient so the body is\nturning over roughly 300 grams of\nprotein a day that's a lot of turnover a\nlot it is a lot of turnover 300 g of\nprotein turnover yes and muscle only\naccounts for maybe 25% of turnover an\nindividual might eat an average female\nlike your mom is eating probably around\n68 grams of protein a day yeah if I'm\nlucky she's she's not big on on um beef\nor chicken and listen mostly eggs and a\nlittle bit of fish and lots of\nvegetables and fruits but maintains\nagain a like a healthy lean body weight\nand and that is wonderful so she's\nbalancing her lower protein intake with\nphysical activity remember there are two\nmain ways to stimulate skeletal muscle\nand that's through resistance training\nwhich one would argue she is doing and\nor dietary protein but when we think\nabout muscle protein synthesis there's\nreally four inputs there's resistance\ntraining there's\nenergy there's insulin growth hormones\nand then there's Lucine when you are\nyounger your body is driven by more of\nthe anabolic hormones which is one\nreason why we believe that a younger\nindividual can get way with five to 10\ngr to 15 gram of dietary protein because\ntheir um levels of testosterone Andor\nestrogen are driving protein synthesis\nin a way that lets them offset any\ndietary deficiencies well that their\nbody is just highly anabolic they're\ngrowing they're growing up they're\ngrowing when an individual like your mom\nwho's now stopped growing the body\nbecomes much more reliant on loosing and\nresistance training because the main\npathway that these things go towards is\nis something called mtor mamalian Target\nof rapamycin the influence on those\nPathways changes as we age so the lever\nin which you pull changes and the\nimportance of that lever changes so that\nthe best thing that your mom could do to\nmaintain skeletal muscle so why and what\nhappens to skeletal muscle as we age\nskeletal muscle if it is not contracted\nand utilized gets this fat infiltration\nmitochondria changes protein turnover\nchanges it becomes less efficient at\nsensing amino acids there's a decrease\nin capillary profusion which is why one\nreason why exercise is so important in\norder for her skeletal muscle to respond\nlike a younger muscle what she should do\nis do some kind of resistance training\nand then add in some kind of dietary\nprotein because when we think about the\nprotein hierarchy the amount of protein\nin a 24-hour period matters the most\nprotein hierarchy um um again closer to\none gram per pound ideal body weight the\nevidence would say 1.6 gram per kg I'll\nnever forget out when the protage study\ncame out I can't believe I've been out\nof Fellowship that long but the protage\nstudy was a position paper and it talked\nabout how the current recommendation for\ndietary protein is too low and that to\nsupport healthy aging you need 2.5 grams\nof Lucine or roughly 30 gram of protein\nand um you know an increase in total\noverall dietary protein and this was\nreally the first position statement and\nthat came out gosh I think\n2010 yet we haven't changed any of the\nrecommendations for the general\npopulation yet so in order for your\nmom's muscle to respond if you compound\nthose two things then she will maintain\nwith activity the health of her skeletal\nmuscle you mentioned something else an\nindividual shouldn't just load protein\nloading extra protein and not moving is\nnot a good idea because of proteins\neffect on mtor throughout the body so we\ntalked about mtor which is mechanistic\nTarget of rapamycin in skeletal muscle\nin the brain and the pancreas this is a\num a protein complex that you just don't\nwant stimulated all day long yeah for\nsake of um cancer risk yes my\nunderstanding is that mtor is very\nhighly expressed in all cells of the\nbody early in development and throughout\ngrowth in fact it's expressed in the\ncells I spent my career working on the\nretinal cells and then over time it\ndrops off and it's remarkable how\nstudies where emor is replaced into\ncells allows them to essentially look\nlike and behave like young cells again\neven replacing some regenerative\ncapacity this is work of a guy named\nxigang he at Harvard uh Children's\nHospital at Harvard Medical School but\nwhat one always observes and we've done\nthese experiments in my lab is that when\nyou increase mtor by any number of\ndifferent you know um ways you know\nmolecular CH canery and things like that\nthat the cells grow enormous and the\nconcern is always that if you increase\nmtor that you are going to bias any\npre-existing tumors to proliferate as\nwell is that right um I think that that\nyes compon yes um it is and we have to\nrecognize that mtor stimulation is\ndifferent in different parts of the body\njust as you mentioned and so um skeletal\nmuscle is uniquely sensitive to\ncontraction and it's through this\nbiochemical process called red one and\nwhen you contract skeletal muscle it\ninhibits red one which then again there\nis this uh fast foration of mtor and\nmuscle protein synthesis\nhappens that is unique to skeletal\nmuscle and when individuals will say\nthis is will be a common discussion that\nyou hear in the space is that well I\ndon't want to increase my dietary\nprotein because some how that is going\nto cause cancer and that is not true\nthat is a very myopic thought process\nthat would be the same as saying\nresistance training which also\nstimulates mtor is going to cause cancer\nright I completely agree with you I\nthink um it's interesting the\nmtor which in mice is mamalian Target of\nrapy um that word rapy might you know um\nprick up some people's ears there are\nsome people out there and by the way I'm\nnot recommending this that take rap Amy\nas a way to inhibit mtor in hopes of\nextending their lifespan uh there's some\nanimal studies that support this there's\num growing interest in this and um so\nmuch so that some people are willing to\ntake rap ayin um by that logic rap ayin\nwould perhaps inhibit muscle growth\nmuscle Health that's a whole other\ndiscussion we'd have to get a TIA and a\nfew Matt cine and a few other folks here\num and maybe we will with you to to\ndiscuss that but the point being that I\nagree completely that we can't just say\nsomething that increases mtor in muscle\nis also going to increase cancer that\nthese molecules like mtor have distinct\nroles in distinct tissues at distinct\ntime points throughout the lifespan and\nas you mentioned ingesting quality\nprotein can increase muscle protein\nsynthesis by way of mtor and other\nPathways right as well as resistance\ntraining and I don't think anyone in the\nlongevity space would suggest that\nresistance training is a bad thing and\nyet we know it's increasing mtor so\nthere's a little bit of a of a\ncontradiction in that field just if one\nstands back from it and says well wait\nyou want to take rapid M to block mtor\nbut you also want to do resistance\ntraining to stimulate mtor which one is\nit yeah and we have to recognize that\nthe efficiency of the stimulation\ndeclines as we age and the way that we\novercome that is again this idea of\nmuscle span how do we continue to go\nthrough life and design a diet that we\nknow will be more dependent on dietary\nprotein and movement as we age because\nthe balance between the two changes when\nyou're young you could eat the twinky\ndiet probably look at a weight and grow\nage is the great equalizer you I trained\nin geriatrics and I am telling you age\nis the great equalizer and creating\nprotocols and habits put into place to\nallow you to age well is everything and\nthere is so much confusion in the\nnutrition space that if we can pull back\nand recognize well number one science is\na is a evolving field and it's the you\nknow is a science of uncertainty but\nthere are foundational principles that\nwe can put into place and one of those\nfoundational principles is skeletal\nmuscle Health Muscle as the organ of\nlongevity must be supported and there\nare very few ways in which we can do\nthat you know when you think about the\nmetabolic implications of skeletal\nmuscle as glucose disposal unit these\ndiseases of Aging really begin skeletal\nmuscle before you see any outward signs\nof obesity before you see any outward\nsigns of um anything that would indicate\nyou are unhealthy it's kind of like\nosteoporosis as the silent disease\nskeletal muscle health is also that way\nand in fact there's some very uh pivotal\nwork out of Yale and they looked at\nyoung healthy college students you know\nas a college student you'll do anything\nfor a couple bucks right and they pay\nthem um and these individuals were\nsedentary and what they but they were\nhealthy lean and what they saw was\nskeletal muscle insulin\nresistance just by being\ninactive can you imagine as you continue\nand how do we Define inactivity now what\nis it less than 5,000 steps per day per\nday W there multiple way I mean think\nabout it we were designed as humans to\nbe very mobile and so now we live in a\nworld that what we think about as\nsedentary Behavior as something\ninnocuous and and not a big deal it is\nin it is a disease\nstate so I feel like you've made an\nexcellent case for the ingestion of\nsufficient amounts of quality protein\neach day especially starting with that\nfirst meal of the day um and just to\nunderscore the suggestion that I heard\nit was aim for one gram of quality\nprotein per pound of Target body weight\nso if somebody weighs 200 lb in the like\nto weigh 180 lbs try and get 180 gram of\nquality protein per day divided up into\nmeals that include somewhere between 30\nto 50 grams of protein per meal yes and\nthat first and last meal are the most\nimportant there's a lot of information\ngoing around that an even distribution\nhas to happen and partially this is my\nmentor's fault he'll laugh um this 30\ngrams of protein three times a day I'm\nsure you've heard about it yeah or that\nyou can't assimilate more than 30 grams\nof protein per meal let's let's um you\nassimilate you you assimilate all the\nprotein that you ingest even if it's\neither correct 100 grams correct even if\nit is 100 grams skeletal muscle protein\nsynthesis will max out probably at 55\ngrams again this is maybe it's 50 maybe\nit's 55 the rest is\noxidized you can only incorporate so\nmany proteins so much protein and the\nrest is then used as fuel or oxidized\nwhat if I do hard resistance training in\nthe hours before a meal and then that\nthat meal includes 100 gram of quality\nproteins let's say whey protein do I put\nall of that 100 grams into muscle\nprotein synthesis I would say I don't\nknow if you put all 100 grams but I\nwould guess that it would cap out at a\nat a certain number and really the\ntotality of evidence would suggest it's\nprobably around 55 grams so regardless\nof whether or not somebody does\nresistance training you can ingest about\n50 gram of protein again four calories\nper gram um typically um into muscle\nprotein synthesis the rest is oxidized\nyes um maybe just touch on that process\nof oxidation what that looks like yeah\nit's basically just utilizing those\nproteins it's utilizing them for energy\nit's not storing them it whether it goes\nback for glucano Genesis or wherever it\ngoes it is then oxidized okay and if\nthat meal with let's say 50 grams of\nquality protein is combined with 50\ngrams of carbohydrate fruit some oatmeal\npasta rice Etc does that change the\nutilization of the protein at all I know\nI asked this question earlier but one\ncould imagine that the body wants to use\ndifferent fuel sources differently um is\nthere any selective use of one um\nmacronutrient versus the other question\nthat that's an excellent question um the\nbody that amount it will be seen as a\nmixed meal but the body will always\nchoose to get rid of glucose first\nglucose dominates metabolism because\nagain it can be toxic to the body so it\nmust be utilized now what is also very\ninteresting is that now you're talking\nabout the speed of absorption one of the\nthings that we should mention is\ntypically you need a substantial rise in\nloosing and that will be again uh that\nwill probably take and last around 2 to\n2 and a half hours so when you have a\nmixed meal that slows down absorption\ndigestion\nthis is where the quality of the protein\ncomes in that becomes very important\nbecause you have to reach a threshold in\nthe blood to stimulate tissue and there\nwas a very interesting study it's the\nfirst study of its kind and this came\nout of Luke Van loon's lab and basically\nthey looked at a a vegan diet with I\nthink it had 40 grams of protein and\nthen it had a omnivorous diet so it had\nboth sources of protein um and what they\nfound was that the individuals that had\nthe for the 40 G meal that was a mixed\nmeal with animal-based proteins actually\nstimulated muscle protein synthesis\nwhereas the mixed meal of just the\nvegetables did not\ninteresting even though it\nwas plant-based proteins High you know\num enough protein in that meal and that\nlikely might be because of the rate of\nabsorption because of the fiber content\nand it becomes important to recognize\nthat a higher protein meal seemed\nespecially with the quality of the\nprotein that if you're picking the range\nbetween 30 and 50 depending on the mixed\nmeal\namount um I would certainly go towards\nthat higher end what is the case for\nfiber either supplementing fiber or um\nin my case I get fiber from fruits and\nvegetables mainly fiber is extremely\nvaluable it's extremely valuable for the\ngut microbiome it's extremely valuable\nfor\nsatiation um fiber if I were to design a\ndiet the first thing that I would pick\nwould be dietary protein then I would\nthink about how I'm going to parse out\nthe rest of the carbohydrates because\nyou earn carbohydrates through exercise\nI usually choose berries um high fiber\nsources of berries and then whatever fat\nblueberries strawberries blackberries\nthem I'm a big fan of berries I'm like a\ngrizzly bear when it comes to berries\nI'm a driveby blueberry eater when\nthey're there I can't help but swipe\nthem off the the bowl or the plate um\nbut there was something else that you\nmentioned that I wanted to highlight and\nthis was if I did resistance training\nthen could I eat 100 grams of protein\nand then 100 grams of carbohydrates the\namazing part about exercise is you know\nwhat we really care about is glucose\ndisposal and insulin sensitivity this\nidea of insulin resistance is killing\nour world young people too yes yes we've\nseen double to Triple the rates of\nchildhood obesity that's wild I don't\nthink people younger than um um 25\nrecognize that like when I was growing\nup in school we there was junk food Lord\nknows there was junk food there was also\ngood food and different kids from\ndifferent homes ate different amounts of\njunk food but it was the rare individual\nin school who was overweight who was\nobese right um and you had some kids\nthat seemed to be just kind of like born\nlean and and um with more muscle you had\nsaid wor were thinner with less muscle\nless it but it was very rare that there\nwas uh an obese kid you just didn't see\nit much and I don't recall there being a\nlot of restrictive eating or even\ndiscussion about nutrition right and\npeople were eating cereals people were\neating candy bars they were also eating\neggs and sandwiches and chicken dinners\nand um all sorts of stuff um so what's\nhappened yeah like really what's\nhappened because something is\nfundamentally different we we had PE\nclass that was required we had to run we\nhad to play volleyball um we had to do\nthose things but it's not like we were\nall athletes and we'd walk to class I\nskateboard I played some soccer but I\nwasn't an athlete per se so like what in\nthe world is going on yeah I will say\nthat also two-thirds of Americans are\neither overweight or obese yeah it's\nwild I mean again one has to have been\nborn in the 70s as I was or early ' 80s\nto really appreciate this tremendous\nshift in kind of like what you see\nand sure people are on phones more more\nsedentary it's got to be a combination\nof things but they're it's cultural you\nhave a disease on of inactivity and\nsedentary behavior um that is frankly\nkilling our\npopulation almost 50% of people have\nhypertension we have a a an what 40\nmillion people on statins I'm sure that\nnumber has changed and skeletal muscle\nis medicine skeletal muscle again helps\nwith triglycerides helps with insulin\nglucose disposal so where this came from\nyou just mentioned if I exercise then\ncan I eat whatever you're eating yes but\nwe're not talking about being\nirresponsible but skeletal muscle now\nhas sensitized within TW you know\nthere's a 24-hour period 72-hour period\nwhere that muscle is still sensitized\nmeaning it it consumes more nutrients it\nconsumes more nutrients but also when\nyou think about insulin resistance\ninsulin moves gluc ose out of the\nbloodstream into cells and through the\nmuscle there's the insulin dependent\npathway through um obviously insulin and\nthat's whatever pi3k if you care if\nanyone cares and then there is insulin\nindependent which is through exercise\nand how glucose moves from the\nbloodstream into the cells is through\nglute four receptors when you exercise\nyou increase the density of glute 4\nreceptors to the surface\njust by doing activity it doesn't\nrequire insulin you are able to then\nmove glucose out of the bloodstream into\ncells and again insulin resistance is at\nthe heart of so many of the problems\nthat we're seeing do you think that most\npeople including the um I'll just say it\nthe public health officials in charge\nunderstand that the points that you just\nmade I mean clearly one doesn't have to\neven have a degree in medic or science\nof any sort to look around and say okay\nthere are a lot of people um suffering\nfrom obesity and we are hearing more and\nmore about the negative effects on brain\non other aspects of mental health and\nphysical health and the interrelatedness\nof mental health and obesity I mean um\nDr Chris Palmer from medical school yeah\nwonderful person former guest on this\npodcast very popular episode I mean it's\nreally been championing this issue um as\nof a few Folks at Stanford and elsewhere\nthis new field of so-called metabolic\nPsychiatry the link between brain health\nmental health and and U metabolic Health\num but putting all that aside do you\nthink that most public health officials\nunderstand\nthat muscle contraction increases glute\nfour expression at the level muscle\nwhich then um uh grabs more nutrients\nfrom the bloodstream which then lends\nitself to all sorts of positive health\nbenefits and diverts from these negative\nhealth benefits I mean like why isn't\nthat on every billboard why I mean it's\nsuch a simple um Concept in principle\nyeah like why aren't we hearing this I\nmean do they even require PE in school\nanymore um no I am not sure but this is\na this is a problem I don't know but I\nwould say if two-thirds of our\npopulation is either overweight or obese\num the health officials may fall into\nthat category or at least two-thirds of\nthem potentially yeah and I'm not\nblaming them I'm just wondering I mean I\ndon't think um well I I don't think we\nhear this message enough that muscle\ncontraction is medicine we've heard that\nfrom Dr Casey means we're hearing about\nit from you that muscle and muscle\nHealth in particular and again I'm so\ngrateful that we're talking about muscle\nhealth and muscle quality and muscle as\na tissue that utilizes nutrients and can\ndivert things towards health and away\nfrom disease as opposed to just muscle\nsize because I think most people hear\nmuscle and they think eat for muscle and\nthey just think muscle size and frankly\nmost people don't want increased muscle\nsize but if you train for hypertrophy\nwhich is muscle size very difficult to\nget especially as you age by the way it\nbecomes much more difficult but you will\nalso get strength and power if an\nindividual struggles you know if they\nfall they break a hip they have to be\nable to get off up off the floor you\nhave to be able to travel on an airplane\nand put your stuff overhead or pick up\nyour toddler mine weighs 40 pounds or go\ndownstairs what um Dr Peter AA has\nreally been emphasizing that a lot of\nlife-ending injuries life-ending\ninjuries occur by virtue of people\nfailing to do the Ecentric movements of\nthat are essentially look like going\ndown stepping down off something I've\nhad to have this discussion with both my\nparents it was a little bit\nuncomfortable frankly because no one\nwants to be told Hey

again for that\nbut be careful as you walk downstairs I\nmean one fracture at age 79 80 the age\nof my parents you I think I'm going to\nget these numbers a bit wrong I'm sure\nbut I think um Peter mentions that that\nleads to death in a large percentage of\npeople that break that hip or break that\nleg or break that wrist even yes and the\nother thing that not because of the\nbreak itself but because the inactivity\nthat results and that's absolutely right\nthe skeletal muscle inactivity causes a\nderangement of metabolism the\nderangement of metabolism will then go\non to get fatty acid infiltration fatty\nacids that infiltrate into skeletal\nmuscle\nonce that happens you now have a\ndecreased flux you're not moving muscle\nglycogen you're not getting rid of these\nceramides or these diog glycerols that\nbuild up that potentially lead to an\ncompound insulin resistance skeletal\nmuscle insulin resistance you then\ngenerate a low grade inflammation that\nis constantly going on if 40% of your\nbody weight is skeletal muscle and you\nare not maintaining the health of\nskeletal muscle you are walking around\nwith an inflammatory bag on\nyou this decline in aging people think\nthat we go through a linear decline in\naging we don't we go through a series of\ncatabolic crisis and a catabolic crisis\nwould be something like someone Falls\nbreaks a hip and never regains full\nfunctioning or someone gets pneumonia is\non bed rest for 5 days or a period of\ntime this\ncompounds upon itself these catabolic\ncrises compound upon themselves and\nindividuals never return to full\nfunction the thing that becomes\ninteresting and very important is that\nwhen you maintain the health of skeletal\nmuscle low muscle mass would be early\nindication of osteoporosis bone attaches\nto muscle muscle pulls bone creates a um\na load a stimulation that is required\nfor for building I mean imagine the\nastronauts or an individual who again is\non bed\nrest when you are training and you are\nputting force and load on your body then\nyou're able to maintain the entirety of\nthe architecture of the body and this\nall makes useful sense um but it is\nunderappreciated as an organ system and\nthe other thing about skeletal muscle\nand depression and mood is that skeletal\nmuscle and inflammation as you contract\nit the duration and intensity of\ncontraction releases\nmyokines uh so myocin have you heard of\nmyokines uh I have but please educate us\nyes so amines are peptide hormones again\nskeletal muscles and endocrine organ\nthat travel throughout the body the most\nfamous one is interlan 6 you have\ninterlan 15 interlukin 6 these affect um\nlipolysis they affect the utilization of\nglucose there's this idea of training in\nlow glycogen state that might increase a\nmore robust amounts of these inter\nlucans these myocin which great CU I\nlove training fast which is interesting\nand we always think about exercise as\nthis way to improve\nmetabolism um it doesn't so much do that\nat rest but what it does is when you\nexercise you improve again glucose\nutilization but also you release these\nmyocin it's not just the physical\nactivity but it's also the subsequent\neffects and the subsequent um molecules\nthat skeletal muscle releases I I just\nwant to say realizing I'm interrupting\nAmen to that so often people look at how\nmany calories were burned in a given\nbout of resistance training and while\nthat is perhaps interesting the\nwavefront of other endocrine and\nmolecular factors that set in motion by\nproper resistance training to me is the\nmost interesting and important aspect\nmeaning in the hours afterwards sure\nyou're going to continue to burn\ncalories at an elevated rate but it's\nall the the effects of the hormones and\nas you're pointing out the Incans that\nlast hours and hours and even days that\nat least to my mind or my reader the\nliterature are the most interesting the\nmost benal fascinating and actually the\nscience is relatively new it came out of\nuh Peterson's lab bente Pon in\nCopenhagen um extraordinary work she's\nan she is in part an immunologist and\nexercise physiologist when you train and\nyou release these myokines they which\nare based on the intensity and duration\nof your activity release something\ncalled capspin B and irisin these myocin\nthen stimulate bdnf release in the brain\nbrain deriv neut trophy exactly which is\na component of neurogenesis when we\nthink about the plethora of activity of\nwhat skeletal muscle does it is no\nsurprise that number one it's free to\nmove can I just um mention something\nabout bdnf if I may um I spent much of\nmy earlier career working on\nneuroplastic brain development and bdnf\nbrain derived neutrophic Factor gets\nmentioned from time to time and um as\nyou mentioned it's involved in different\nneurogenesis Pathways and um but I think\none of its most interesting effects is\nits role in consolidating existing\nconnections what we call synaptic\nConnections in the brain and I'm so glad\nyou mentioned this because what you're\neffectively saying is that doing\nresistance training properly sets in\nmotion a molecular Cascade that feeds\nback to a molecular Cascade within the\nbrain that rein en forces the neural\ncircuits that exist and one of the\nHallmarks of Aging is a essentially a a\ndegradation of neural circuitry right\nsometimes in extreme cases like\nAlzheimer's or other forms of dementia\nParkinson's Etc but we know that the\nvolume of gray matter of of of NE\nneurons within the brain declines with\nage we know that the neural circuitry\nsuffers the speed of of neuronal\ntransmission suffers and it's long been\nobserved but only now um objectively\nsubstantiated that exercise can not just\nmaintain but even improve brain function\nover time and so um thank you for\nallowing me to kind of uh expand on on\nwhat you just said I just think that um\nif ever there was a potent medicine for\nimproving brain health its exercise and\nin particular resistance exercise I\nthink that the case for cardiovascular\nexercise is probably that it maintains\nthe the components of blood flow that\nare also critical for the yes and\ncertainly no one is arguing the\nimportance of cardiovascular activity\nand V2 Max we can appreciate that\non the flip side of that skeletal muscle\nhas not had its moment yet and in\nparticular resistance training you're\nnot going to be able to be effective at\nmaintaining a V2 max if you do not have\nhealthy skeletal muscle you are not\ngoing to be able to be effective at\nnearly doing anything or surviving any\nkind of illness the higher the amount of\nskeletal muscle mass you have the\nhealthy skeletal muscle mass the greater\nyour survivability against nearly any\nkind of disease remarkable for example\ncan cancer CIA which is the wasting that\ncomes with cancer kills 20% of\nindividuals survivability comes from the\nhealth of skeletal muscle also on that\nsame note Contracting skeletal muscle\nreleasing myocin interfaces with cells\nof the immune system we've all heard of\nmacras and the cytokine storm in Lucan\n15 uh tnf tnf Alpha as being uh\npro-inflammatory\nwhen the myocin which are also in lcan 6\nand Inter Lucan 15 are released from\nskeletal muscle they interplay and they\nsomewhat dampen the inflammatory effect\nand have a different effect on the\nentirety of the\nsystem when these quote cyto kindes come\nfrom skeletal muscle incredible so as\nlong as we are now on the topic of\nexercise let's make it concrete for\npeople we talked earlier about nutrition\nand specific gram amounts and calorie\namounts and distribution and that's just\nwonderful and thanks also for explaining\nthe mechanism and the incentive for\ndoing this let's talk about resistance\ntraining um and let's do this in a\nslightly different way than we did\nearlier what is your program for\nresistance training and then we'll talk\nabout what other people might consider\nfor them and maybe the same thing so if\nyou could just actually walk us through\nyour week what does it look like um it\ncould be uh Sunday Monday Tuesday Etc or\ncould be you know how many days a week\ndo you resistance train of course you\ndidn't know I don't I don't do any kind\nof training yeah well I know based on\nyour Instagram what you do and um and\nnow we we know why so I have a wonderful\ntrain uh trainer Carlos M shout out to\nhim every Monday I decide I don't want\nto train and I know that of course you\ndon't enjoy it um I do but it's usually\nsuffering um at least Monday every\nmorning I I know Monday morning's going\nto come up and I'm going to think about\nall the ways in which I can get out of\nit I never get out of it I always show\nup I train consistently three days a\nweek and I can train I train pretty\nheavy for my size so I'm maybe 110\npounds um what I do is I do some kind of\npush pull hinge squat on all three of\nthose days I do so you train your whole\nbody I do three days a week separated by\na day in between I do I do because uh\nessentially I'm working hard enough\nwhere I'm pretty exhausted so I came\nhere and you asked me if I trained this\nmorning Friday I'm off today okay but\nwhat I do is when I start I think about\nwell actually Carlos things about this\nbut I'll do some kind of sled push sled\npush uh it will be loaded it will be\npretty heavy it gets my full body moving\nand then we'll pick some kind of\ncompound movement whether it's a\nmulti-joint movement that's exactly\nright a multi-joint movement through\nfull range of motion so for instance a\nsquat or a deadlift that's right um if\nsomebody isn't skilled in squats or\ndeadlifts um could they maybe hold on to\na a kettle bell of appropriate weight\nfor them and do like a kettle bell squat\nI'm going to give them an even better\nsolution and this is this concept that I\nlearned from um a PhD named Pat Davidson\nand he talks a lot about High Ground low\nground movements and a high ground\nmovement would be something where you\nhave contact contact like a hack squat\nso ground you have back support leg\nsupport you are able to move in a way\nthat fully contracts the muscle that you\nare focused on we see a lot of people\nthat go to the gym and kind of just do\nwhatever and that might be okay to\nmaintain but the goal should always be\nladies you're not going to get bulky\nshould be Hy hypertrophy which is hard\nto achieve as you hard to achieve but\nyou must Focus because maintaining and\ngrowing skeletal muscle mass as you age\nit becomes much more challenging and so\nchoosing High Ground movements I would\nnot have someone who is an unskilled\nlifter go in and do a front-loaded um\ngoblet squat or free weight squat or\ndeadlift right I wouldn't I would have\nthem do High Ground movements and this\nis where machines are really really\nwonderful people kind of will say well\nbut you have to train for functional\nmovement and functional well what is\nthat we're training for life right we\ntraining for Life durability and uh if I\nmay um you know anytime people say you\nknow what's the best form of exercise\nhow do you work out Etc I always say\nrule number one definitely train train\nbut don't get hurt or avoid getting hurt\nI mean the moment somebody approaches\nexercise and gets hurt they're in\ntrouble one of the best ways to get in\nshape for your entire life is to avoid\ngetting injured but still train or train\nyour entire life if there are parents\nlistening thinking about your kids there\nwas a a whole push where kids shouldn't\ndo resistance training and shouldn't\nmove load I look at my kids they might\nnot be doing one rep Maxes but they're\npicking up kettle bells they have oh\nyeah yeah I was told growing up to not\ntouch the weights until\nI was at least 18 at 16 I started doing\nyou know pull-ups push-ups sit-ups um\nand then uh pretty quickly moved into\nall the leg press leg extension you all\nthat stuff couldn't help myself but I\nwould argue that outside normal play\nsomeone is never too young to start and\nfrankly never too old and body weight\nresistance is in many cases sufficient\nright I mean as a kid I would do um at\nnight I would do sit-ups and handstand\npush-ups against my door you know I\ncouldn't do a proper handstand\nunassisted but I'd you know flip over\nand then do the handstand push-ups until\nmy mom would yell at me about the marks\non the on the door but you know that's\nthat's was pretty tough right getting 10\nrepetitions of that was pretty tough um\nbut you're saying resistance training\nwhat you said um High Ground High ground\ncontact high contact so um when you are\nchoosing motions that an individual is\nunskilled to do I think Le let's frame\nthis is that most most people think\nabout exercise for optimization of\nperformance but if we take that back a\nnotch and you know I think about um my\naudience and they are individuals that\nare um aside from the special operators\nand aside from the CEOs they are\n40-year-old women that are like hey all\nof a sudden I noticed that my body\ncomposition has changed you know I work\nwith an amazing PhD her name is Victoria\nflear and she has helped me bring into\nthese pieces of how do we design and\nthink about training protocols and\ntraining programs for the more mature\nindividual and when you think about\nthese High Ground movements if someone\nhas not trained and they're thinking\nwell I don't want to fall so I'm going\nto do box jumps that plyometric movement\nthere's a high probability of injury\nyeah I don't like box jumps or I don't\nlike them because I the Ecentric loading\nthat you know it ends up being a lot of\nsoreness and it just takes a lot of them\nto to generate what I'm trying to\ngenerate so that is exactly the point is\nan individual going to be able to\ngenerate enough Force to make it\nmeaningful and someone would argue yes\nwell for them that would be you know\nwhen I was a a practicing geriatrician\nand I was going through my fellowship we\ndid the a number of metrics to look at\nstrength and one of those was a sit and\num stand out of a chair so sit to stand\nand that would have for some people have\nbeen considered a high-intensity\ninterval the question becomes is that\nenough to mount a response over time and\nI would argue\nno what do people need to do and that is\nwhen you train for hypertrophy which is\nmuscle growth and let's say that is five\nto 10 reps three you know four to five\nsets you pick there's many different\nways that it where the final repetitions\nare challenging where the final and the\nload is enough and there's wonderful\ndata out of mcmas University that it\ndoesn't have to be heavyweight as long\nas the stimulus is enough and then we\ntake it back to what is the stimulus and\nthe stimulus the goal should be are you\nmoving the muscles that you are supposed\nto be doing and are you generating\nenough activity to create adaptation and\nchange and so a high ground movement for\nsomeone who's listening to this and and\nis thinking I need skeletal muscle\nhealth I walk Walking is wonderful but\nis walking enough to maintain those type\ntwo fibers it's not you will see a\ntransition and we've all seen our aging\nparents I mean my dad is in his 70s he's\nvery fit but he used to be a Collegiate\nwrestler he went to warten he was\nCaptain of his wrestling\nteam Dad you're a lot smaller and part\nof the reason is the fail the failure to\nfocus on hypertrophy and those are those\ntype two fibers those type two fibers\nthat transition with age to more type\none fibers those long lean fibers you go\nfrom bigger to Bulky to less choosing\nactivities to maintain those fibers also\nthese fibers are bigger this is where\nglucose disposal goals choosing things\nlike leg extension it's not a bad thing\nif you get stronger and you have\nstronger muscles then you will have more\npower you'll be able to generate more\nForce you will be much less likely to\nfall and you'll be healthier overall\nbecause of muscle health so maybe we\ncould just list off some of the\nmovements that um people could think\nabout in terms of these High Ground\nmovements you mentioned hack squats uh\nleg presses come to mind leg extension\nleg curls leg curls lat pull Downs with\na supported back any kind of RS rows a\nsupported row again these are mostly\nmachine exercises that you're describing\nthey are they are which is UN machines\nso cables would be considered low ground\nbecause you're kind of in space and if\nyou think about it what takes someone\nout in their 40s what takes someone out\nof the game it's a tendon\ninjury tendonopathy whether it's a\nshoulder whether it's a hamstring\nwhether it's a hip and part of the\nreason is there's muscular strength we\nfocus on muscular strength but there's\nalso tendon strength which takes time\nand when you get tendinopathies you get\nthe thickening of these tissues you know\npeople will say that tendon lays down\nmuch slower that the collagen turnover\nis much slower but actually muscle turns\nover 1 to 2% per day 10 pendens uh turn\nover maybe 0.5 to 1.5% per day it's not\nthat substantially slow these it's\nhighly active tissue you need blood flow\nyou have to treat your body with respect\nthat if you think you can always train\nthe way that you did when you were\nyounger and just hit those heavy weights\nif you get injured and you are not\nallowing your tendons to keep up then\noverall injury over time again this is\nwhat we would call maybe not a catabol\ncrises but close what is the total\nduration of a resistance training\nworkout that the typical person uh could\nuse I I make it a point to try and warm\nup over the course of about 10 to 15\nminutes and then do 50 to 60 Minutes of\nhard work um but I always leave some gas\nin the tank it's it's the rare I would\nsay 5% of my total resistance training\nworkouts and I also train three times a\nweek although I divide my body up into\ndifferent um you splits um that's uh my\ncase and I run well you are much much\nlarger than me well it's it's um it's\nthe case now that I try and hit each\nmuscle group directly once per week and\nthen in directly another day per week so\nif legs are on Monday the in that's\ndirect and then but the indirect leg\ntraining is actually the hit workout on\nFriday sprinting as I love that that's\nwonderful I think that the um three days\nper week whole body workout I think\nwould work for a lot of people just to\ntake the complexity out of it um so is\nit the case that the entire workout\ncould be um constrained to 40 to 60\nMinutes absolutely and for a new lifter\nthey're going to get the most gains what\nwe find is that an if an individual is\nwhat we would consider a beginner you\nwill see um you know after they go\nthrough a neural um a neurological\nadaptation is that they will get\nmore um growth and potentially progress\na new lifter could progress weekly\nwhereas a more advanced lifter I would\nsay we would be considered more advanced\nwe've been lifting our whole lives that\nfor us to make changes um it's it's much\nmore challenging for us to put on size\nor uh even get stronger I mean yes there\nis a particular Cadence but our\nimprovements might be minute and when\nyou're thinking about designing a\nprogram the current recommendations uh\nfor physical activity which by the way\ndo you know 75 roughly 70 maybe it's 78%\nof individuals do not meet physical\nactivity guidelines and what are those\nagain 5,000 steps per day 150 minutes of\nmoderate to vigorous activity with two\ndays a week of resistance training per\nweek yeah so 150 minutes total and two\ndays a week of resistance plus two days\na week of resistance training um so that\nis what 30 minutes 7 days a week of\nactivity just to put that into\nperspective that is how sedentary we are\n50% of Americans are not even training\nis that true in other countries as well\num well I don't know the statistics in\nother countries but far and away we have\narguably the biggest Health\ncrisis with our population people always\npoint to the blue zones they say well in\nthe blue zones they have like a shot of\nvodka every night and they're socially\nconnected and they have a Mediterranean\ndiet and they're not lifting weights but\nis it the case that they are um piling\nwood um are they walking more um are\nthey caring active okay highly active\nand the blue zones are a funny thing\nbecause um you know some will say well\nare the the records kept appropriately\nand and Etc there is um a lot though\ndespite that that we can learn from the\nblue zones and I think\nagain uh connection social socialization\nbut also movement you know part of the\nreason why we are requiring this higher\nprotein load is because we are\nphysically less active again there's\nonly two main ways to stimulate skeletal\nmuscle resistance training and dietary\nprotein arguably the resistance training\npiece the physical activity piece is\nmore influential is much more impactful\nto full body\nhomeostasis than diet will ever be if\nyou just eat protein and don't exercise\nyou will likely still lose muscle\ninteresting my observation of family\nfriend friends um that include people\nwho are very fit into their 80s and '90s\nand even Beyond in a few cases are\nthat and here these are uh\ngeneralizations based on observation I\nwant to be clear that the people I know\nwho are still skiing in their\n80s who are sprinting in their 80s you\nknow not as fast as they used to who are\nstill playing tennis um in their 80s so\nwhat I'm referring to here are people\nthat are playing sports that involve\nDynamic movement that involve a lot of\ncoordination and no doubt some\nresistance um at least of some sort like\nskiing is you know there's some\nresistance involved depending on the\ncomplexity of the slope ET yeah and\ntrees so um what do you think is going\non there I mean there's a rich\nliterature to support the fact that most\nof our brain volume is there to support\nvision and movement and that when we\nmove less there's brain atrophy um John\nRady at Harvard talked a lot about this\neven some species of animals that will\nspend part of their life swimming around\nand then they'll Nest on a rock and then\nthe brain will actually eat itself due\nto the lack of movement will just\nmetabolize uh portions of itself so the\nrelationship between movement and brain\nhealth um seems Seems obvious but um\nyeah how many folks do you see out there\nin their 60s 7s 80s and 90s that are now\ndoing resistance training do we know the\npercentages on that um I don't and I was\njust recently looking at the ACSM\nguidelines which which is the American\nCollege of sports medicine um for\nactivity and older individuals I am not\nsure the percentage of individuals that\nare actually doing resistance training\nand partially um I'd have to believe\nthat it's less so again I trained as a\ngeriatrician and one of the things that\nwe always saw not for everybody but for\nthe majority of people is it wasn't the\nduration of the training they were still\nif they were active they were still\nactive it was the intensity that they\nwere able to Mount and so because you\nknow there's this interesting thing is\nas we age well I mean some of us are\nless intense in our training and it's\nthe actual intensity piece that seems to\ngo down that when this can be addressed\nand what do I mean by intensity um\nthere's a million ways in which I\nsuppose one could Define intensity but\nit is pushing themselves again are we\ngoing to say is it how many reps how\nheavy but the focus and the intensity of\nthe training goes down I guess we could\nDefine intensity somewhat Loosely but\nstill fairly by saying you know\nrepetitions in the what you know 5 to 10\nmaybe 12 repetition range where the\nfinal two or three repetitions are\nchallenging um in good form right maybe\neven to failure in good form does that\ndoes that seem like Fair yeah and and I\nwould think of the intensity component\nbecause the Aging literature it really\ndoesn't seem to matter if people are\nlifting heavier light I used to believe\nthat in order to maintain skeletal\nmuscle mass especially as hormonal\nstatus changes decrease in testosterone\ndecrease in estrogen decrease in\nprogesterone that the heaviness of the\nload has to increase I can't the data\ndoesn't necessarily support that I would\nlove for that to be the case surprising\nto me I would think think people would\nhave to push themselves with not\nextremely heavy loads but moderately\nheavy for them so was surprising to me\nas well and especially when we worked on\nsome of those earlier studies in\nlayman's lab there's this change in body\ncomposition that seems to happen midlife\nthere's an increase in visceral body fat\num or Central adiposity and one would\nthink that you require a lot of\nextra uh supplements Etc to influence\nthat but when training and nutrition are\naccounted for in a very controlled way\nbody composition changes to the positive\nyou can lose body fat and increase\nmuscle mass it'll be very interesting to\nsee as the literature around hormone\nreplacement continues to evolve\nespecially as it relates to women\nbecause we know that testosterone\nimproves skeletal muscle mass um\nbut that isn't going to be enough if you\ndon't have the foundation the foundation\nin place and I think that the other big\nconcern is how we're measuring skeletal\nmuscle mass we mentioned a little bit\nabout dexa the more effective way is\nreally MRI which doesn't seem to be\nachievable for many people it's\nexpensive and and CT would be the other\nway to actually look at muscle quality\nmuscle quality right now is defined\npurely on functional movement\nmeasurements but that's clearly not it\nwhen we Define if you look in the\nliterature muscle quality is really\nabout the load and the weight and the\nperformance not about the architecture\nand the infrastructure of the skeletal\nmuscle and the reason I say this let let\nme take a step back is that in the\nliterature and you will often hear\npeople say that only strength matters\nSize Doesn't\nMatter I don't believe that to be true I\nbelieve that we haven't been able to\ntest muscle size\nappropriately and when we begin to test\nit there's a a way and this is I I think\nthis is being done it it came from a a\ngentleman named uh Dr uh William Evans\nand he utilizes something called a D3\ncreatine and it's a deuterated tagged\ncreatine and an individual will ingest a\npill creatine is largely in skeletal\nmuscle there may be a small amount in\nbrain but for the majority of skeletal\nmuscle is that's where creatine goes and\nso this is a direct way first time ever\nit's it's been validated I think it\nstarted its utilization in maybe\n2019 but when individuals are directly\nmeasuring skeletal muscle mass they find\nthat skeletal muscle mass and strength\nare both important interesting so is\nthere a synergistic effect of ingesting\nquality protein in sufficient amounts\ndistributed throughout the day and as\nyou mentioned especially at the first\nand last meal of the day and resistance\ntraining exercise on muscle health and\nother metrics of longevity and current\nhealth status this is a bit of a nuanced\nanswer if you are young and you are\neating close to 1 gram per pound ideal\nbody weight then any time that you\ningest your protein would be\nadequate however if you're older and you\nwant to take advantage of resistance\ntraining plus dietary protein than\nconsuming within an hour or so and again\nthat number is the the way in which I\nthink about it is really about that\nblood flow is how long that blood flow\nis still getting to the skeletal muscle\nbecause you're delivering nutrients if\nyou are older or have a chronic\ncondition then there would be no\ndownside and there is evidence in the\nliterature if you consume dietary\nprotein around resistance training due\nto that synergistic effect if you are\neating a lower protein diet and or older\ngot it so would it be actionable to try\nand I don't know drink a away protein\ndrink within an hour of resistance\ntraining or eating a meal that include a\nchicken breast or some eggs or or steak\nis that is that basically what we're\ntalking about um it is is if you are\neating a lower protein diet I would take\nadvantage of that because you increase\nthe efficiency you lower that anabolic\nresistance load um yes one could do that\nand I say this in a way that if you are\nyoung and healthy and you are training I\ndon't really care when you ingest your\nprotein but if you are a um a group or\nin a group of individuals that\npotentially is at risk\nthen doing resistance training and\nadding in dietary protein I would say a\nshake is a great way to go because the\nabsorption is quicker a meal will have a\nslower absorption and again we need to\nget those amino acids into the\nbloodstream at a certain level at a\ncertain time what about cardiovascular\ntraining V2 Max I make it a point to try\nand do a long hike or jog once a week\nfor me that 60 to 90 minutes I'm not\nobsessive about it in the sense that\nsometimes I'll go out and I make it\nsocial with a weight vet or maybe just\nwalk or hike sometimes I'll jog on my\nown one shorter run of 30 minutes or so\nin the middle of the week at a faster\nclip and then one high-intensity\ninterval training session that lasts\nabout 12 minutes and total and thank\ngoodness it's only that cuz I'm\nbasically sucking for air at the end\nthat's it for me plus a bunch of walking\nif I can I try to walk as much as\npossible throughout the day I don't I\ndon't even consider that exercise I just\nconsider that movement that's wonderful\nnow you're talking about um non-\nexercise activity um that is extremely\nvaluable I try to Pace while I take\nphone calls and things of that sort as\nmuch movement as\npossible what is the value of getting\nthe heart rate elevated for some period\nof time longer you know longer than a\nfew minutes yeah I mean when you're\ntalking about increasing V2 Max I think\nthat there's a multitude of ways to do\nit one could do slow steady state\nactivity but I will say as individuals\nage that becomes more challenging on\njoints we are thinking about how are we\nable to m maintain our physicality\nthroughout life if you have got a ton of\ntime and uh you can do slow steady state\nit's wonderful alternatively there's a\nlot of evidence that high-intensity\ninterval training um Martin gabala would\nbe a wonderful guest he is really the\nexpert in high-intensity interval\ntraining and its changes in um insulin\nsensitivity influence on V2 Max and this\nis really going all out in a matter of\n20 seconds there's moderate intensity\ninterval training high intensity\ninterval training Sprint interval\ntraining that will increase V2 Max in a\nsubstantially less amount of time and\ncould be safer for an\nindividual um the other way is improving\nskeletal muscle mass if you improve\nstrength and hypertrophy you will\nimprove your V2 Max albeit not exactly\nin the same way but both are beneficial\nand both will improve V2 Max and blood\npressure and triglycerides and clinical\noutcomes that we care about it's\nwonderful to think about things um kind\nof nebulously and then it all comes back\nto what do we care about as we age we\ncare about having an appropriate blood\npressure let's call it 120 over 80 we\ncare about having a triglyceride level\nof 100 or less lower we care about\nmaintaining fasting insulin levels\nfasting glucose levels anywhere the the\ncut off they will say is between 70 to\n100 these are clinical outcomes that we\ncare about\nand that is what we ultimately want\nhowever the influence is to pull those\nlevers to get there can be varied It\nultimately comes with how are we going\nto do it and how are is it going to be\nsomething that we maintain you know\nthere's a certain aspects about dietary\nprotein that are interesting one of the\nthings that I've seen clinically is that\nthose individuals that are on our higher\nprotein diet will seem to have um higher\nblood glucose I don't know exactly why\nthis is It's thought that maybe because\nthe red blood cells live longer it maybe\nalso higher blood creatinine levels we\ndo see higher blood creatinine levels\nwhen individuals have higher muscle mass\nthat is uh typically a call that I get U\nmany of my patients are uh large and\nbuff as I would say and they almost all\nhave higher levels of creatinin that\ndoesn't mean that your kidney function\nis suffering uh one thing that one would\ndo clinically would uh get a cattin C to\ncorrect and get a corrected GFR to see\nif it's within the normal range is it\ntrue that if you do a hard resistance\ntraining session and then get your blood\ndrawn the next day that you might see\nhigher blood creatinine levels um\npotentially but what I have seen are\nhigher alt and liver enzymes and we see\nthat very frequently in individuals that\ntrain intensely and it concerns you or\ndoesn't concern it doesn't concern me\nright because it's just a consequence of\nthe training and presumably it's\ntransient it is transient typically um\nand we may see changes in creatinin with\nuh I have a one patient she runs 100\nmiles oh goodness she's in her 60s she's\nan ultra Runner yeah in her 60s and\nshe's strong I mean she's stronger than\nme it's extraordinary and you think\nabout what are the things that she needs\nto do to maintain the health of her\nmuscle mass so that she can continue for\nlong periods of time so while we both\nagree that nutrition is one of the\nfoundations of muscle health and health\ngenerally supplements often can have\ntheir place we talked a little bit about\ncreatine I and many other people\nsupplement with 5 to 10 gram of creatine\nmonohydrate per day I do that because it\nhas benefits for muscle strength there's\nsome brain benefits that I'm aware of\nand I realize and now you've reinforced\nthe idea that it's difficult to get\nenough creatine even if one is ingesting\nthe threshold amount of one gram of\nprotein per ideal body\nweight what are your thoughts on\ncreatine monohydrate and what other\nsupplements do you recommend for your\ntypical client excuse me patient yeah\ncertainly so creatine monohydrate is\nwonderful and particularly we're seeing\na lot of benefits in women uh\npostmenopausal women and older\npopulations creatine for sure uh the\nother supplement is uthan a uthan a is a\npostbiotic made from the gut microbiome\nand there's a percentage of people that\ncan make it and the majority of\nindividuals cannot make it interesting\nurethan a is the this connection which I\nfind fascinating it's a gut muscle\nconnection individuals that take urethan\na I happen to be one of them there are\nmany papers out there that improves\nmitophagy which is the health of\nmitochondria the turnover of\nmitochondria helps with the renewal of\nmitochondria but what's so fascinating\nis there are trials in human individuals\nthat it increases strength and endurance\ninteresting what um milligram doses do\nyou recommend so I take between 500 and\na th000 of uthan a really I I wish that\nI had actually created this or found\nthis out truly if I could make one\nsupplement I know I would probably make\na mix of urethan a with creatine and\nsome whey protein and maybe uh 25\nmilligrams of collagen and I would have\nmy perfect supplement is it taken with\nfood or without food it doesn't matter\ninteresting morning or night it also\ndoesn't matter what's so interesting\nabout urethan a is that it comes from\nagain it's made in the gut from the gut\nmicrobiome from things like pomegranate\nor walnut it's made from something\ncalled an\nelianin and it is really again what I\nthink of as this gut muscle connection\nwhich I do believe is going to be the\nnext Frontier so interesting I recall a\nfew studies that Dr Andy Galpin put on\nhis social media these were in mice um\nmind you but looking at how disruption\nof the gut microbiome could offset some\nof the strength and hypertrophy\nincreases of resistance training\npointing to the fact that having a\nhealthy gut microbiome is critical for\ntranslating resistance training into\nactual improvements in muscle Health yes\nand one of the things that we do see is\nthat as individuals increase their\nactivity talking about more endurance\ntype running there's this very\ninteresting inflection point there's\nthis idea of Optimal Performance and\nthen there is this kind of moment where\nOptimal Performance depending on the\ntraining load starts to take a toll on\nhealth and wellness I think that we see\nthat and with that one of the things\nthat we always see is impaired gut\nlining impaired gut Integrity the Gap\nJunctions seem to open whether it's the\ntraining volume and the physiological\nstress that can easily be measured with\nzulin or Cal protectin sto samples do\nthis but doing things that actually help\nthe gut not just the gut microbiome but\nthe gut Integrity is extremely important\nvery interesting what other supplements\nand maybe we should put whey protein in\nhere as well yes whey protein it's\ninteresting whey protein and whey\nprotein concentrate has alphal albumin\nand lact aerin and these immunoglobulins\nthat can be very beneficial whey protein\nit's interesting we talk a lot about how\nprocessed foods are negative but the\nreality is is that processed foods\naren't positive or negative the highly\npalatable processed foods that are full\nof sugar we can all agree Maybe those\nare not ideal but whey protein\nconcentrate or whey protein isolate\nthose are both processed however it is a\ngreat way to get your essential amino\nacids which are amino acids that you\nmust get from the diet your body cannot\nmake them there's been a lot of research\nwith whey protein has very little\ndownside and it's easily tolerated those\nthat have challenges with lactose can\nuse the Whey Protein Isolate versus the\nconcentrate and it's very portable if\none is traveling and things of that sort\nand if one has a child please make sure\nthat you use a lid of uh very tight for\nthe powder otherwise you will be wearing\nit your child will be wearing it is a\nbit of a disaster but yes noted uh what\nabout other supplements including fish\noil omega-3 fatty acids there's a lot of\nresearch around that and I think that\nit's a it's a positive it's not only a\npositive for brain function but it seems\nto have a unique anabolic effect maybe\nit is in you know potentially from on\nthe ribosomes we're not sure at least\nI'm not sure at this time but there\nseems to be even more emerging evidence\nthat it may even impact women\ndifferently um again I I can't say that\nin all certainty but nearly all of my\npatients are on some form of fish oil is\nthere a threshold amount that is a\nwonderful question\num there is not the general\nrecommendation is around four grams but\nsome individuals four to 10 grams which\nwould be definitely on the higher end\ncertainly can\nuh potentially thin your blood if an\nindividual is going for surgery two\nweeks prior would uh suggest not taking\nit but where it becomes very interesting\nit's really the combination of Omega-3\nto Omega 6 and understanding there's\nways in which you can test in your blood\nwe run this bloodwork all the time\nlooking at whether it's an Omega Quant\nor an Omega an Omega index can be very\nvaluable but it is a very easy\nsupplement to take and it seems to be\nvery beneficial for brain health and\neven muscle health I find it to be most\naffordable to take it in liquid form\njust take a tablespoon of the lemon\nflavored fish oil put it in a protein\ndrink or something then you don't taste\nthe fishiness and then capsules for um\nconvenience when traveling and things of\nthat sort but the liquid forms are so\nmuch more affordable in order to hit\nthat two grams a day or you know in this\ncase two to four yeah two to four grams\num again this also depends on the\nabsorption for the individual that's why\nit's really important to do blood work I\nhave some patients that require closer\nto six grams to be able to improve their\nOmega 3 to six ratio and it certainly is\nthere's that Precision Nutrition where\nthe amount for one person is not\nnecessarily the amount for another\ninteresting what other supplements do\nyou take I think let me think about what\nother supplements that I personally take\ncollagen I love collagen mhm collagen in\nmy coffee collagen coffee strong I love\nstrong coffee if you've never had it\nit's amazing collagen it's called strong\ncoffee it's called strong coffee it has\ncollagen it has eleanine in it really\nhelps with the Jitters there's some good\nevidence with alanine to help with\nanxiety but collagen is interesting\ncollagen is a I say protein it's not\nreally it has a protein score of zero it\ndoes nothing to affect skeletal muscle\nmass it is devoid in tryptophan and it\nis very low in the branch chain amino\nacids but it is high in glycine Proline\nand hydroxyproline\nwhich makes it very unique in structure\nit is also very difficult to test the\neffect on tendons uh collagen protein on\ntendons because as you can imagine one\nwould not want a tendon biopsy right\nsounds painful sounds painful also\nbiopsies are painful um yes I you know I\nused to do a lot of those when I was in\nmy fellowship it was it was probably\nless painful for me than it was for the\nsubjects imagine yeah it's like taking a\nsmall Quirk of tissue out of the muscle\num\nso collagen protein I think can be very\nbeneficial for skin hair and nails I\nfeel as if we just haven't gotten\nsensitive enough to determine its effect\non tissue yet I anticipate that higher\ndoses above 15 gram maybe of some\nbenefit I'm just speculating but I'm\nguessing that it's probably closer to 25\ngrams and I know that that seems a bit\nrobust so in one scoop might have 15\ngrams but I think there's no negative to\nincreasing collagen and quite frankly we\ndon't get a lot of collagen in our diet\nthe places in which you would find\ncollagen or the gristle and meats or\nbroth yeah yeah that's another great way\nto increase it so you take it once a day\nI do particular time of day in the\ncoffee in in the morning so my coffee\nhas collagen in\nit before I train yes I do and I\ntypically train fasted aside from that\nand then I'll add in an additional\nscoop you mentioned fasted Maybe we\nshould touch on fasting for a moment um\nI inadvertently have been doing\nintermittent fasting for years meaning I\nwas never hungry for breakfast so my\nfirst meal lands at 11:00 a.m. or so\nplus or minus an hour on most days there\nare exceptions to that last meal\ntypically I don't know 8:00 p.m. 700\np.m. sometimes 9:00 p.m. I'm not super\nstrict about that and it basically boils\ndown to anywhere from 2 to\nfour quote unquote meals per day um a\nlunch a dinner and then some eating in\nbetween could you first comment on that\narchitecture of eating um but maybe\nfirst on fasting specifically I mean\nwhat are the benefits or detriments to\num having a feeding window of about 8 or\nnine hours um regardless of where it\nlands in the day and then let's talk\nabout how that might slide around or if\npeople should ensure getting um more\nfood coverage throughout the day two\nbenefit\nthat I find from fasting number one\ncalorie restriction number two bowel\nrest many individuals have\ngastrointestinal challenges when they\nare in a Tim restricted window they are\nnot feeding all day long great point and\nthose are the two benefits that I often\nsee an individual who is older or\nstruggling to put on muscle fasting\nwould not be my primary go-to I think\nthat as individuals age there's a a bit\nof a a negative because you have to\nbalance this muscle protein synthesis\nthey're always going through a synthesis\nand a catabolism so an an anabolic\nprocess and a catabolic process as you\nage it becomes more difficult to\nregulate that process and if you add in\nadditional fasting go through long\nperiods of time where let's say you're\nnot training you're not protecting\nskeletal tissue that would be a place\nwhere I don't necessarily recommend\nfasting some people might find it\ndifficult to hit the 30 to 50 g gram of\nprotein per meal frequency across the\nday in order to reach that one gram of\nprotein per pound of ideal body weight\nif they were going to add a meal or\nlet's just say add 30 to 50 grams of\nprotein how much time separation do they\nneed from the other meals so for\ninstance if I were to take a step back\nand say okay you know I I need an\nadditional 30 to 50 gram protein intake\nper day in order to maintain the muscle\nI have as I age and I am aging as uh we\nall are I\nsuppose is 2 hours before my 11:00 a.m.\nmeal enough does it have to be 3 hours\ncould it be 1 hour I mean you can only\nassimilate and then oxidize a certain\namount of protein I mean how much time\nwindow does one need between these\nprotein feedings I appreciate that\nquestion and here's my answer to that\nthe first meal of the day is the meal\nthat has been studied the remainder\nmeals to my knowledge there is no study\nthat shows anything about the second or\nthe third meal and perhaps that's\nbecause of the difficulty but the\nliterature suggests that that first meal\nof the day whenever you're going to have\nit let's say for you it's 11: eating 30\nto 50 grams of protein the muscle\nprotein synthetic response will last 2\nhours however when we talked about mtor\nthere's other initiation factors like\neif4 that will maintain itself for\nanother four to 5 hours I see therefore\nthe second meal is really not necess\nnecessarily a muscle protein synthetic\nresponse I can't say that that's\nsupported in the literature but where\nthe benefit of that is is that we know\nthat more than one meal of that robust\namount of protein will likely have\nbetter outcomes on this 24-hour um\nprotein response 24-hour nitrogen\nbalance but that second meal would be\njust about getting your protein in it\ndoesn't matter if it's you know if you\nhave to hit your need of say 200 gram of\nprotein then that middle meal the real\ngoal for that metabolically is to get\nenough protein to meet that 1 gram per\npound ideal body weight I see and then\nthat final meal before you go into a\nfast would be what we would say would\nsupport overnight protein synthesis I\nmean not necessarily support overnight\nprotein synthesis but in the fasted\nState your body pulls from muscle it has\nto maintain the energy balance for all\nother systems in the body um all other\ntissues again 25% of protein turnover\ngoes to skeletal muscle and the rest\ngoes to other organ systems for you or\nfor hypertrophy adding an additional\nmeal would again let's say four meals I\nthink would be uh if I were to design a\ndiet in the perfect world to support\nhypertrophy I would add another a fourth\nmeal well I love to eat so that's not a\nproblem uh in\nprinciple this is probably getting a bit\nmore toward the afficianados but I've\nheard that certain forms of animal\nprotein and other proteins are more\nbeneficial at certain times of day for\ninstance meat and eggs early in the day\nmaybe chicken and fish in the middle of\nthe day and that casine and milk\nproteins might be more advantageous for\nmuscle Health in the final meal of the\nday or closer to bedtime I realize this\nis getting into the details but I'm sure\na percentage of our listeners would be\ncurious to do that and of course um milk\nproteins always make me sleep so uh kind\nof fits you know it's really interesting\nI I will say that milk protein casine\nseems to be slower absorbing and that's\nbecause of the impact with the the gut\nobviously but is there anything special\nabout casine or milk protein the answer\nto that would actually be no but the the\nlength of time that it takes for\ndigestion absorption maybe where the\nbenefit comes in that being said there's\nsome data to support High saturated fat\nDairy believe it or not actually can be\ngood for Health and Longevity I know\nthere's uh people will say high\nsaturated fat or or high fat Dairy would\nbe negative but I would say that there\nis evidence to support it being Health\npromoting well nothing like a piece of\nterrific cheese like a Parmesan or a um\nor a shot of uh full fat cream and I\nwill mention the which I love every once\nin a while that's a guilty pleasure a\nshot of full fat cream with equal part\nespresso I'll take it I'll take it I\nwill mention that the Lucine content in\nmilk protein is a little bit lower okay\nor um say Greek yogurt are there any\nsort of um cryptic Champion proteins you\nknow I I think most of us think okay\nsteak and ground beef and maybe Venison\nand elk and eggs and all the obvious\nthings chicken fish Etc but are there\nany kind of um cryptic proteins out\nthere that are particularly good for us\nin terms of their amino acid content\nthat people don't think of you hear\nthese days about Li I frankly don't like\nthe taste I don't like liver but um\nliver has a lot of other benefits to it\nso it's high in fat soluble vitamins and\niron very bioavailable but I'm not it's\nvery difficult to eat yeah I think\npeople either love it or hate it um I'm\non the second category so no no proteins\ncome to mind is you know is salmon you\nknow quality protein salmon is a quality\nprotein is higher in fat again calorie\nbalance does matter fish is interesting\nfish has 5 gram of protein per 1 ounce\nversus meat meat has on average seven\ngram seven or eight red meat has seven\nor eight grams of protein per 1\nounce so interesting you know that this\nidea that you know eating muscle can\nsupport the health of muscle it makes\nsense though doesn't it it makes perfect\nsense and and You' explained very\nclearly as to why that why that is um\nokay we set aside liver um for this\nconversation some people are into\ncricket and maybe there is sorry I\napologize to the well not to the\nCrickets The Crickets probably thank me\nfor for my response but I'm not judging\nit's just my my personal visceral\nresponse um my other people may like\ninsect proteins but what about other\norgan Meats heart um I know I mean\naround the world you see the consumption\nof of lots of different organ Meats is\nthere any evidence that that heart um is\na good protein or are we I'm generally\nlooking at skeletal muscle as the the\nbest source of of amino acids uh Heart\nis also a good source of protein it's\nalso high in CoQ10 which is is good for\nmuscle Health but many people again we\ndon't seem to eat that however other\nplaces eat the full animal but they are\nall they are all good sources of protein\naside from collagen which would be that\nprotein score of zero and if somebody\ninsists on being vegan or vegetarian um\nlet's just say Vegan what are their best\noptions there are rice pea blends of\nprotein which are absolutely suitable\nthere are a lot of now fermented types\nof protein powders out there that seem\nto have the same profile as we the one\nthing that I would say as individual's\nage a a vegan diet can be very\nchallenging need to make sure that you\nare getting enough B12 zinc iron things\nuh nutrients of concern that seem to be\ngoing down in general and we're seeing\ndecreases of that um in the general\npopulation what are your thoughts on\nmagnesium we sometimes hear that\nexcellent people are magnesium deficient\nbased on depletion of the soil o you\nhear this stuff but um what's the story\nwith magnesium that is true there seems\nto be um less magnesium in the diet very\neasy to supplement whether the the form\nthat you use whether you use a magnesium\nglycinate or there's a whole host of\nmagnesium citrate for gastrointestinal\nHealth whatever it is but yes magnesium\nsupplementation can be very beneficial\nuh for muscle for\nbrain do you support the idea of\nsupplementing with zinc or is that\nsomething that is kind of you know\nsometimes yes sometimes no I think if\nyou're eating a Whole Foods diet you're\ngoing to be unlikely to be deficient in\nzinc zinc is interesting because you\ndon't want to supplement zinc without\ncopper there is a zinc copper ratio that\nis well-maintained in the body\nsupplementation with one or the other\nwill typically deplete the other and you\nknow as a geriatrician there's a a zinc\ncopper ratio things that we think of as\nkind of proxies for overall brain health\nnot saying that the zinc copper ratio is\nthe only thing but certainly\nsupplementing with one or the other one\nwould\nbe careful what are some things that\npeople might be doing or taking that\ninadvertently disrupt muscle health and\nperhaps even hypertrophy one thing that\npeople often use is ibuprofen and\nibuprofen while not inherently bad\nthere's some evidence to suggest that\nhigher doses of ibuprofen can impact\nmuscle Health whether it's hypertrophy\nor strength I often think about those\ntogether but uh ibuprofen use it's also\nnot good for the gastric lining again\nyou have to be able to absorb your\nnutrients to be able to become strong\nand healthy the other thing is obviously\nStatin use some people do need statins\nI'm not saying that we shouldn't but\nthat can certainly affect muscle Health\nthe side effect can be uh muscle pain\nmyalgia muscle soreness it can deplete\nCoQ10 um is occasional use of these\nthings okay yeah of course and you know\nobviously check with your doctor but\nthings that suppress inflammation like\naspirin potentially or other nids can\nwell aspirin is in a category of its own\nbut nids in particular seem to suppress\nskeletal muscle at certain doses\nhypertrophy potentially and strength the\nother thing is um fluo quinolones they\nare antibiotics that can affect collagen\nand tendon turnover if an individual is\non a Flor quinolone there's a risk for\nyou hear a lot about these Achilles\ninjuries yeah which sorts of antibiotics\nI think um is it like cypro and things\nlike that people can injure themselves\nbadly you should be uh certainly careful\nabout the activity that you're doing at\nthe time the other thing is the proton\npump inhibitors people use that for\nstomach acid or reflux that can affect\nuh absorption of vitamins and minerals\nthat do have long-lasting effects what\nare your thought thoughts on the glp1\nanaloges OIC monjaro real quick anecdote\nI was in New York City I was walking up\nthe U side on a Sunday recently and\nthere was a sign outside a store I saw\nthat that said we carry OIC and monjaro\nand I thought the sign would say like we\nhave you know ginges or something and so\nand I thought wellow that's guy I\nsnapped a photo of it I didn't think\nmuch of it at the time and then I\ndecided to post it to my Instagram\nthinking that there' be a few opinions\nand frankly I was just curious what\npeople would think so I said what do you\nthink and it was one of the largest\nresponses in terms of comment volume and\ncontentiousness that I had ever observed\nand I thought whoa there's really\nsomething here my understanding is that\nthese compounds um which are becoming\nincredibly popular can help people lose\nweight but that there's some loss of\nmuscle maybe even some bone mass correct\nme if I'm wrong on that but I would also\nma imagine excuse me that some of the\nmuscle loss can be offset by resistance\ntraining maybe even protein intake and\nresistance training so what is your\nthought about these compounds last thing\nI'll just give a little bit of my stance\nI know a number of people that had\nextreme struggles losing weight I don't\nknow the extent to which um they were\ndoing things correctly or incorrectly\nwith nutrition it's not my place to\nprobe into that but that they got on\nthese compounds one or the other and\nseem to love them because it got them\nkind of out the gate you know 20 30 lb\nweight loss very quickly without um\nintense Cravings their appetite is\nsuppressed and many of them are now also\nexercising and doing other things so I\ndon't think we want to look at this or\ntalk about this as an either or OIC\nmonjaro or exercise and and proper\nnutrition I would imagine there's a\nplace for both but I'd love your take on\nthese I would love to share it uh these\nmedications\nare they're it's complex the issue of\nobesity the challenge with glp WS and\ndual Agnes like mongero glp1 and gips it\nis a complex conversation so the opinion\nthat I'm going to give is going to be uh\nwhile I give my opinion I recognize that\nthis is certainly like you said very\nheated there's a couple of ways to look\nat it first of all nothing has worked\nmore\neffectively other than bariatric surgery\nthan these medications to affect obesity\nso gp1 Agonist L OIC will an individual\nmight get a 13% weight loss and how long\nit a couple month that's good question\nyeah it's a it's a a titration it's a\nmonthly titration but over a period of\n24 weeks um wow it it certainly depends\nsignificant um yeah it certainly depends\non the individual but it's utilized and\nincreased month by month a four weeks SP\nB the other aspect is the Dual agones\nlike mno\ntritide and that will potentially cause\na 22% weight\nloss the challenge with obesity is real\nnow I have taken care of patients that\nhave deeply suffered with this whether\nit is a component of food addiction or\nwhether it is a component of whatever\nthe reason we have used these in clinic\nand it has trans formed their lives I\nwould never take that away from somebody\ncertainly it is personal choice now the\nother aspects of these the comment about\nskeletal muscle loss I have seen that\nand again we use these medications in\nour practice and with a proper nutrition\nplan and proper resistance training I do\nnot see a loss of skeletal muscle mass\nyou have to work with a provider that\ncan help titrate it but I think that\nthese drugs can be used in a very safe\nManner and you know we see improvements\nin alcohol consumption that's in in\nother addictions very interesting there\nare a whole host of benefits from these\nmedications now I think where people\nget upset is they say well is this a\nshortcut can you go off of them do you\nhave to regain that weight and again we\nhave many patients that go off of them\nand have implemented great strategies\nfor training and nutrition and we we\ndon't see weight gain interesting it all\ndepends on a comprehensive holistic View\nand that becomes important to recognize\nthere are many benefits and people will\nsay the negatives would be slowing down\nuh gastric emptying well I would say yes\nand that's exactly what the medication\nis designed to do there maybe some risk\nwith pancreatitis there is some\ndiscussion about thyroid um cancer in\nrodent models\nhave a\ndifferent thyroid and volume of thyroid\nreceptors in humans I think that\npotentially that is incidental I'm sure\nthat we'll be hearing more and more\nabout it these medications also are not\nnew they have been used\nfor over a\ndecade and those are all important\npoints to recognize that now it is very\npopular but these medications have been\naround for quite some time it is\ninteresting that some of the peptides\nlike lp1 analoges that have existed in\nsomewhat Niche communities for a while\num so including things like in the\nmelanite stimulating hormone community\nthat are now sold under FDA approval um\nfor things like low libido um things\nlike VII um and Addie we were mentioning\nAddie for for women for hyposexual\ndesire disorder right the I don't know\nthe history of Addie but um certainly\nthe um Alpha mocy stimulating hormone\nrelated peptides the gp1 peptides things\nlike celin which are in the growth\nhormone secretagogues all were viewed\nfor a long time as kind of Niche\nCommunity Fitness Community but now at\nleast the glp1 analoges have made their\nway into I mean massive scale use which\nspeaks to kind of a general theme of\nwhat I've observed over the last well\nI'm 48 now but let's just say 35 years\nwhich is that many of the things that\nexist in Niche communities become um\nmainstream it just takes some time and\nthey become mainstream through the\nstandard channels of FDA approval um\nwhich as is the case with OIC and W so\nit's great to hear that you Embrace sort\nof both sides like a lot of what you've\ntalked about today I think one wouldn't\nnecessarily find in the kind of standard\ntables or what's on a a a poster in the\ndoctor's office but some of it is and\nyou really um are at the intersection of\nboth those um those Landscapes thank you\nand and this idea of OIC and um tripti\nthese gp1s that you know we talked a lot\nabout protein and one way that it has a\nsatiating effect is this\ngp1 um stimulation and one has to\nrecognize that these glp Agonist these G\nAgonist last for a week the dietary\nprotein effect is meal to meal so eating\nprotein increases gp1 as does in\ndrinking yerbamate te but probably to a\nlesser degree and more transiently more\ntransiently and I I think that that is\njust an important\nan interesting fact and the other fact\nis that the amount necessary to\nstimulate muscle protein synthesis the\namount for muscle health is also seen in\nthe amount of gp1 released interesting\nit seems as if that that 30 to 40 or so\ngram amount of high quality protein is\nthe same amount that has a meaningful\nimpact on the release of gp1 very\ninteresting I did not know that so so if\nwe were to just back away from\neverything we've talked\nabout what are the top level benefits of\nhaving healthy muscle\neverything okay muscle muscle is the\norgan of longevity and when we think\nabout lifespan we think about health\nspan and then we finally think about\nmuscle span I would argue that that is\nright after lifespan the benefits of\nhealthy muscle cannot be denied this is\nbetter metabolic Health better blood\npressure better\nsurvivability better strength better\nMobility better body armor should\nsomeone fall should someone get sick\nyour survivability will be related to\nthe health of skeletal muscle and\nespecially as we think about aging if we\nwant to have good skin or we think about\nwanting to have a a good-look body even\nthough I can appreciate it's only a\nsmall amount aesthetic but leveraging\nthe aesthetic to have healthy brain\nfunction there's this idea that\nAlzheimers or certain types of dementia\nare type three diabetes of the\nbrain skeletal muscle is the only organ\nsystem we have voluntary control over it\nis the only endocrine organ system we\nhave voluntary control over it which\nmeans we have a responsibility to\nleverage it we've talked about these in\na lot of detail today meaning you've Ed\nated us about these in detail today and\nthank\nyou but perhaps you could summarize what\nyou view as the top nutrition-based\ntools for improving muscle Health number\none dietary protein and that would be in\nterms of a protein\nhierarchy roughly one gram per pound\nideal body weight an individual could\ncertainly go to7 grams per pound ideal\nbody\nweight the higher the protein the less\nit matters the quality whether it is a\nhigh quality protein or a lower quality\nprotein the total protein amount matters\nthat is at the base of the pyramid the\nnext would be\nthe I would say the quality\nunderstanding the quality of the protein\nso that you know exactly how much and\nthen certainly the distribution of how\nyou are ingesting this protein the\ndietary protein habits of someone who is\neating a more protein forward diet\ndistribution will matter less the higher\nit is but there is certainly some great\nimportance depending on if you are older\nwho you know challenging for any kind of\nHealth and Wellness challenges this is\nwhat I would say and I realize it will\nvary depending on activity but assuming\nthat somebody gets the one gram of\nquality protein per pound of ideal body\nweight how should they make up the rest\nof their caloric needs the next I would\nsay would be your choice you choose\ncarbohydrates are that there's evidence\nthat carbohydrates are helpful from a\nfiber perspective phytonutrients other\nvitamins and minerals I certainly would\ngo there that would be my preference the\namount of activity that you do certainly\ncould use carbohydrates and then fat it\nis very easy to get essential fatty\nacids your diet doesn't have to be too\nhigh in fat to get that but at the end\nof the day prioritize dietary protein\nthe next level would be understanding\nyour carbohydrate threshold could start\nat 130 gr titrate up or down depending\non your metabolic health and or\nactivity understanding that outside of\nactivity 50 g or less of carbohydrates\nwould be a threshold to mitigate\nsubstantial insulin response finally\nthat fat you can choose however you\nwould like to get that fat typically\ncomes within a meal and that would be\nthe remainders of your caloric intake\nand what are your Topline tools with\nrespect to exercise as it relates to\nmuscle Health resistance training is\nnon-negotiable it doesn't matter if you\nneed to start with body weight\nabsolutely okay move to bands definitely\nmoving load is valuable and\nnon-negotiable start with two days a\nweek you will likely progress to three\ndays a week if you're doing three days a\nweek again it all depends on the volume\nand intensity in which you are working\nunder depending on whether it's five to\n10 sets how many um reps you're doing I\nthink that there's many weight in which\none could do it right the only way in\nwhich someone could do it wrong is to\nnot do it quite frankly that would be\nwhat I would say for that and then\nadding in high-intensity interval\ntraining I would choose high-intensity\ninterval training over slow steady state\ncardio because the high-intensity\nintervals seem to have a a very\nimpactful effect with the low amount of\ntime that it takes let's talk about\nsomething that might seem somewhat\ndistant from everything else we've\ntalked about but I actually believe is\nCentral to all of this which is mindset\nthe psychology around health and\nself-directed health which of course\nincludes communication and cooperation\nfrom licens trained Physicians like\nyourself you know what's your mindset\nand recommended mindset around muscle\nhealth and just General Health in terms\nof health span and lifespan what you're\ntalking about here is muscle span and\nthe way in which the cognitive processes\nand the way that we think about our life\nhow does that influence what we actually\ndo and I could give someone the perfect\nplan and it doesn't matter if I give an\nindividual a perfect plan if they're not\nwilling to execute on it I've been a\nphysician for 20 years believe it or not\nthat is a long period of time and I\nwould say a good physician is a\nphysician that identifies patterns of\ndiseases patterns of illness but an\neffective physician is someone who\nidentifies patterns of people because\nonce you identify the pattern of the\nperson you're able to leverage that so\nthat they can get the best out of\nthemselves and there's a few core\nfundamental principles that people have\nto recognize if they want to be well and\nthat is you set standards and you don't\nset goals people will set a weight loss\ngoal or a muscle hypertrophy goal but if\nyou set a standard for how you operate\nand how you execute you know that\nregardless of how you feel you're going\nto get up and train you know that this\nis going to be your nutrition plan you\nget up and you do it you set a standard\nand that standard provides a framework\nfor\nexecution I love that um I sometimes\nthink of the non-negotiables of the week\num that unless I'm suffering from a\nreally bad cold or flu which fortunately\nfor me is pretty rare um that I'm going\nto get those three resistance training\nsessions in I'm going to try and get as\nmuch quality sleep as I can and I'll get\nthose card iov vascular training\nsessions and when you talk about setting\nstandards is that what you're referring\nto um are you talking about blood work\nstandards are you talking about um\naggressively trying to maintain um blood\nvalues in a particular range are you\nmainly talking about behaviors I'm\ntalking about both uh yes should there\nbe a standard for your blood work that\nyou're getting yes we have a very strict\nstandard that we have in place for all\nour patients however the framework for\nwhich they execute is all about the\nstandards that they place for themselves\nthe you know because ultimately what we\nwant Here Andrew is we want people to\nget results and the only way they're\ngoing to get results is if they stop\nchasing these goals and that might be\ncounterintuitive to people because\npeople will say well I'm going to set a\nweight loss goal goals come and go\nstandards remain and if you fail to do\nthe Practical in your life the Practical\nbecom\nimpossible and that's why we said\nstandards the other aspect is an\nindividual has to understand where they\nfail I take care of a lot of very\nsuccessful entrepreneurs and just\nindividuals they all know where they\nfail they all know their points of\nweakness over time it's not\nunderstanding where you Excel because\nquite frankly that's the easy part the\npart that becomes very valuable is you\nknow where you fail you know where your\npoints of vulnerability are you know\nwhere you fall off track I'll give you\nan example\ntypically when someone is about to do\nsomething amazing they have this but you\nwould you know this better than anyone\nthis dopamine high at that Pinnacle\nseems to be a place of vulnerability\nwhether they will skip a training\nsession or buy another car or do\nwhatever it is that they do eat more\ncake they have an experience in their\nenvironment where they're almost at\nthey're at the Pinnacle of what they are\ndoing that is a place of vulnerability\nwhere people will fall off health track\non the same token at the moment after\nthe big successful moment um I have a a\npatient who puts on a massive event in\nVegas and every year I wait for the call\nthat he's feeling\ndepressed because his\ndopamine didn't go back to baseline or\nfall to Baseline it went below Baseline\nwhat becomes important to recognize is\nthat this is another point of\nvulnerability at this point of of\nvulnerability is where people seem\nto go off track and never regain their\nfooting if they do not recognize that\nand so I I can appreciate that we're\ntalking about mindset here because\nthere's a level of neutrality that is\nnecessary for overall\nsuccess again this is what I've seen\ntime and time again that those that are\nthe healthiest are able to maintain this\nlevel of neutrality tell me more about\nlevel of neutrality I'm right there with\nyou on setting standards instead of\ngoals and I'll say I've never thought\nabout it in this way but I absolutely\nlove that um and for the record you said\nit and I'm going to blast it out credit\nto you as much as possible because I\nthink it's so critical for persistent um\nengagement in the kinds of behaviors and\nmindsets that lead to success over time\nso love this standards over goals uh\nprinciple um knowing where one fails\npoints of vulnerability um beautiful\nconcept painful to hear because of the\nuh realistic nature of it and that's\nexactly why it's pot so thank you for\nthat as predict and predictable human\nbeings are predictable in their\nbehaviors and it's for example on Friday\nnight when everyone tells themselves\nthey're not going to have that drink and\nthat pizza and that cookie and then\nFriday Night comes around and they are\nsurprised by their own humanness and\nagain what we're looking for are\nlong-term strategies for overall health\nbecause that wave of Youth does close\nand while we can all continue to get\nbetter as that window compresses it\nbecomes much more important to be very\ndiligent on the responsibilities to our\nhealth our nervous system so that we can\ncontinue on for Success it's just the\nway that it is tell me about the\nneutrality component this is fascinating\nand I I have a very good friend his name\nis Ben Newman and he really highlighted\nthis for me and he works with a lot of\nthese sports teams and he was the first\npatient that helped me put together this\nidea of\nneutrality I'll give you an example he\nwas flying to work with one NFL team I\nthink that they were going to the Super\nBowl something major and I said to him\nyou know how are you doing you just came\noff of your book launch and just before\nthis you were at another NFL team and he\nsay to me he goes Gabrielle it's just\nanother\nTuesday it's just another Tuesday and so\nthis idea of neutrality is that when you\ncan manage and mitigate your emotional\nes and\nfor when things are at their High the\nexcitement this isn't to celebrate or\nnot to celebrate but when you begin to\nmitigate these es and flows it's almost\nas if there's this level of neutrality\nwhen that happens these big moments\nbecause life is full of big moments yes\nit's full of small moments but it\ncertainly is full of these big moments\nand it's these big moments that once we\nenter into if one is not neutral then\nbeing able to pick themselves up from an\nexperience or a moment become much more\nchallenging my most successful patients\nI'm not talking about financially I\ntalking about the ones that are able to\nmaintain and contain their health are\nthe ones that are\nneutral in terms of tone and affect um\nno in terms of\nexperience as they go through life they\ncelebrate some wins they don't celebrate\nothers very consistent with some of the\num theories that I and a few others in\nthe science Community have expounded\naround dopamine regulation it makes a\nlot of sense and where where I care\nabout this is as a physician who takes\ncare of people and when they cannot\nmanage this emotional highs and lows\nbecause as you think about it if you\nwalk around and you feel that everything\nis stressful I mean you've got your\ncortisol going then you're not sleeping\nand it becomes this cycle and then that\ncycle becomes a habit and if one can\nteach themselves to Be steady for\nexample going into a big\nworkout maybe they mitigate the\nanticipation of that workout they're\nmuch more likely to continue on that way\nand it's what is so important about it\nis a trainable skill it's sounds like\nit's a lot about energy conservation yes\nmental energy not just caloric energy\nyes very interesting and so then you can\ndo the things that matter and then you\ndon't fall off the bandwagon because it\njust seems that each time a person does\nit they become better at doing that it\nis\nhard to hear I think probably for many\npeople but it's very predictable and if\nyou can leverage that predictable nature\nfor example that Friday night that comes\nalong and you've told yourself that this\nis going to be your last beer or your\nlast pizza then you know how to engage\nin it you come up with a game plan where\nyou've set a standard where this is the\nthing that you do Friday night you set\nthe rule and the foundation for your\nactions while hearing about your stance\non mindset standards goals knowing where\none fails points of vulnerability and\nneutrality I have one more oh\nplease this one is a big one and this is\na person will only ever be as healthy as\nthey feel worthy\nof tell me more that when individuals do\nnot feel worthy of having health and\nwellness they will sabotage themselves\nover and over and over again and it is\nsomething really important when you sit\ndown with a patient or you reflect on\nyourself the question becomes do you\nfeel worthy of being healthy do you\ntruly feel worthy of having the body\nthat you desire of having that overall\nsense of Vitality because if someone\ndoesn't they will use that as a\ndistraction they will sabotage\nthemselves and they will focus on the\nnot feeling well the feeling tired all\nof the other physical as aspects that go\nalong with ill health and that will\nallow them a\ndistraction I want read something about\na person who was obese who then got in\nshape um and they were reporting that in\ntheir family growing up they had a\nnarrative around exercise that for them\ntranslated\nto exercise being a form of extreme\nselfishness and that surprised me I\nthought you know you know what better\nthing to uh do in terms of helping one's\nhealth and helping therefore the\nrelationships in your life by you know\nsegmenting out a small not you know a\nhuge portion of one's day but you know\nan hour a day to take great care of\noneself and ensure health so that you\ndon't have to be you know dependent on\nothers in a way that would be burdensome\nto them perhaps earlier in life than it\nwould be in any other case so this seems\nto fit very well with what you're saying\nthis person obviously felt that exercise\nwas selfish and they weren't worthy\nsomehow of being healthy and in shape\nthat fortunately they flipped the script\non this and and I should say that was\nover goodness that was 2016 so it's been\na long while and they have maintained um\ngood health and staying in shape they\nthey set a standard for themselves isn't\nthat amazing it's awesome it's awesome\nto see it's also been awesome to see\ntheir transformation in their psychology\nand the different aspects of their life\nbut um is that something that you see a\nlot that people just feel like um get in\nshape or paying attention to what they\neat is is somehow selfish I think that\nsome people do not feel worthy of\nfeeling\ngood and they will sabotage themselves\nuntil they uncover that number one that\nis the message that they're sending\nthemselves and once they do that there\nis a bit of friction and we know in\norder to be successful in any game plan\nthat friction is required and on the\nother side of friction is quite frankly\nfreedom but those individuals have\nto understand that they are worthy and\nreally do that work but yes time and\ntime again it is one of the first\nquestions that I asked do you feel\nworthy of feeling good well Dr Gabrielle\nlion you have given us an incredible\ntour of muscle and in fact an entirely\nNew Perspective even for me on how\nmuscle impacts our\nhealth as we talked about at the\nbeginning so often when people hear\nabout the importance of muscle they\nthink just building muscle and that\ntends to separate people into those who\nwant to build muscle in those who don't\nor think that they can't or don't really\nunderstand what it's about but you've\nmade Oho clear the fact that muscle is a\ncritical perhaps the most\ncritical aspect of maintaining Health\nand Longevity of the body of the brain\nof Health span lifespan what you call\nmuscle span really seems to Wick out\ninto everything in terms of our\nwell-being and you've given us a ton of\nactionable tools at the level of\nnutrition at the level of exercise at\nthe level of supplementation and\nthankfully also at the level of mindset\nI think the tools that you shared along\nthe lines of mindset are absolutely\nspectacular as are all these other\nrecommendations so I want to say on\nbehalf of myself and everyone listening\nand or watching thank you for sharing\nall of this

you\nalso do a lot of work with people in the\nmilitary Community who perhaps who\ncannot afford the work so you make it um\na point to support communities that um\nperhaps couldn't afford the kind of\nsupport that they absolutely deserve so\nthank you for that thank you also for\nbeing a public educator and such an avid\none and really out there on Instagram on\nYouTube with your own podcast
