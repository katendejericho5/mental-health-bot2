    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Karen\nParker Dr Karen Parker directs the\nsocial neurosciences research program at\nthe Stanford University School of\nMedicine the goal of her laboratory's\nresearch is to understand the biological\nbasis of social functioning at every St\nage of the lifespan so this includes the\nbonds that form between infant and\nparent or parents as well as the bonds\nthat occur between children as they grow\nup which of course form the template for\nsocial functioning when we become adults\nDr Parker's research is heavily focused\non autism and indeed on all forms of\nautism spectrum disorders today we\ndiscuss autism we talk about the\nprominent theories and current\nunderstanding of the biological basis\nfor autism as well as what Still Remains\nmysterious and unresolved D about the\ncauses of autism you may have heard that\nthe incidence or perhaps just the\ndiagnosis of autism has dramatically\nincreased in the last 10 to 15 years and\ntoday we discuss why it is in fact that\nthe incidence not just the diagnosis but\nthe incidence of autism has so\ndramatically increased and perhaps most\nexcitingly Dr Parker shares with us\nbrand new research findings from her\nlaboratory that point to a new\nunderstanding of what causes autism as\nwell as a novel treatment for autism\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is eight sleep eight\nsleep makes Smart mattress covers with\ncooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\nin this podcast about the fact that\nsleep is the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance now a\nkey component of getting a great night's\nsleep is that in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep your body temperature\nactually has to drop by about one to 3°\nand in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3° one of the best ways to\nmake sure that those temperature changes\noccur at the appropriate times at the\nbeginning and throughout and at the end\nof your night when you wake up is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's what eight sleep\nallows you to do it allows you to\nprogram the temperature of your mattress\nand sleeping environment such that you\nfall and stay deeply asleep easily and\nwake up each morning feeling incredibly\nrefreshed and energized I've been\nsleeping on an eights Sleep mattress\ncover for almost 3 years now and it has\ndramatically improved the quality of my\nsleep so much so that when I travel and\nI'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't\nhave access to my eight sleep I very\nmuch look forward to getting home\nbecause my sleep is always better when I\nsleep on my eight Sleep mattress cover\nif you'd like to try eights sleep you\ncan go to

episode is also brought\nTo Us by element element is an\nelectrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans zero sugar and the appropriate\nratios of the electrolyte sodium\nmagnesium and potassium and that correct\nratio of electrolytes is extremely\nimportant because every cell in your\nbody but especially your nerve cells\nyour ner neurons relies on electrolytes\nin order to function properly so when\nyou're well hydrated and you have the\nappropriate amount of electrolytes in\nyour system your mental functioning and\nyour physical functioning is improved I\ndrink one packet of element dissolved in\nabout 16 to 32 ounces of water when I\nwake up in the morning as well as while\nI exercise and if I've sweat a lot\nduring that exercise I often will drink\na third element packet dissolved in\nabout 32 ounces of water after I\nexercise element comes in a variety of\ndifferent flavors all of which I find\nreally tasty I like the Citrus I like\nthe watermelon I like the raspberry\nfrankly I can't pick just one it also\ncomes in chocolate and chocolate mint\nwhich I find tastes best if they are put\ninto water dissolved and then heated up\nI tend to do that in the winter months\nbecause of course you don't just need\nhydration on hot days and in the summer\nand spring months but also in the winter\nwhen the temperatures are cold and the\nenvironment tends to be dry if you'd\nlike to try element you can go to drink\nelement spelled lm.com huberman to try a\nfree sample pack again that drink\nelement.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by Aeropress Aeropress is similar\nto a French press for making coffee but\nis in fact a much better way to make\ncoffee I first learned about Aeropress\nwell over 10 years ago and I've been\nusing one ever since Aeropress was\ndeveloped by Allan Adler who was an\nengineer at Stanford and I knew of Allan\nbecause he had also built the so-called\naobi frisbee which I believe at one time\nperhaps still now held the Guinness Book\nof World Records for furthest thrown\nobject and I used to see Allan believe\nit or not at parks around paloalto\ntesting out different aobi frisbe so he\nwas sort of famous in our community for\ndeveloping these different Feats of\nengineering that turned into commercial\nproducts now I love coffee I'm somebody\nthat drinks coffee nearly every day\nusually about 90 to 120 minutes after I\nwake up in the morning although not\nalways sometimes if I'm going into\nexercise I'll drink coffee first thing\nin the morning but I love love love\ncoffee and what I've personally found is\nthat by using the Arrow Press I can make\nthe best possible tasting cup of coffee\nI don't know what exactly it is in the\nAero press that allows the same beans to\nbe prepared into a cup of coffee that\ntastes that much better as compared to\nany other form of Brewing that coffee\neven the traditional French press the\nAero press is extremely easy to use and\nit's extremely compact in fact I take it\nwith me whenever I travel and I use it\non the road in hotels even on planes\nI'll just ask for some hot water and\nI'll Brew my coffee coffee or tea right\nthere on the plane if you'd like to try\nAeropress you can go to Aero press.com\nhuberman that's a r o\np.com huberman to get 20% off any\nAeropress coffee maker Aeropress ships\nanywhere

great to\nbe here this is going to be perhaps one\nof the longer conversations that we've\nbeen able to have over the years um in\npart because whenever I see you on\ncampus we're headed in our respective\ndirections but I'm very excited because\nthe topic of autism is one that is on a\nlot of people's minds and I think the\nfirst question that always comes up it\nseems is whether or not the frequency of\nautism is indeed increasing or whether\nor not the field of medicine is is\ngetting better at detecting what was\nalways there over time do we have any\nclear answers to that well I think it's\na multifactorial answer so we're getting\nbetter at detecting autism right so in\nthe past we were diagnosing kids at nine\nor 10 years of age right and now\nclinicians are able to reliably diagnose\nkids um at two to three years of age\nright so there's more people um there\nare pediatricians have autism screeners\nnow so when you bring in your baby and\nover the first couple years of life\nyou're filling out screeners that are\nlooking for autism symptoms right so so\nthere's just a lot more awareness around\nautism but the rates have increased to\nnow 136 us children have a diagnosis of\nautism which is over two years ago it\nwas 1 in 44 so 1 in\n36 wow I feel like it was just yesterday\nwhen it was 1 in 80 but is 1 in 36 um\nthe average across Bo and girls um does\nit\nskew differently if you look at just\nmale births versus female births yeah\nthat's a great question so autism is\nmale biased and prevalence so you have\nand again the studies veryy I mean it's\nit's worth noting that autism is a\nhighly clinically heterogeneous disorder\nwhich means that if you met one kid with\nautism you've met one kid with autism\nright so so we have to bear that in mind\nas we have this conversation but you\nknow different studies show that about\nfor every one girl there's three to four\nboys that are impacted by autism so\nthere's you know differences in the\nprevalence rate and also there's\ndifferent monitoring sites so the way in\nthe US that these data are generated is\nthe CDC has 11 monitoring sites across\nthe country and so they they follow um\nchildren and then that's where we um\nthat's where the prevalence rates come\nfrom and they release new prevalence\nrates every you know few years so if\nPhysicians are able ble to detect autism\nearly say in a 2-year-old or a\nthree-year-old have to imagine that\nthey're working off of tests that don't\nrely heavily on language because even\nthough you can get you know some verbose\ntwo and three year olds most two and\nthree-year-olds don't have a very\nextensive vocabulary um and I'm guessing\nthat they're also relying on things like\nvisual gaze um among other things um\nwe've already made clear that this is um\nnot a discussion to allow people to\ndiagnose themselves or others but um\nwith that said what are some of the\ndiagnostic tools that people use you\nknow um is it language is it Vision or\ndoes it present as um you know abnormal\nauditory processing maybe you could give\nus a sampling so autism is um a\nbehavioral diagnosis right so unlike\nother areas of medicine where you might\nbe able to take a blood test or there's\nother sort of tools it's all a\nbehavioral diagnosis by um an expert so\nusually um a psychiatrist or a\npsychologist and they look for two core\nfeatures so the so this is based on the\nDSM um five and there the two core\nfeatures are pervasive social\ninteraction challenges and the presence\nof restricted repetitive Behavior but\nthere are a lot of people with Autism\nwho have anxiety there are a lot of\npeople with sensory challenges there are\na lot of people with seizure disorder\num Sleep Disorders so again it's each\nperson with autism has this sort of\nunique collection of traits and you know\nthat's how they get diagnosed we're\ngoing to talk a lot today about\ninterventions but how early are some of\nthe behavioral interventions and I\nshould just say any interventions\nintroduced nowadays so if someone brings\ntheir child to the pediatrician and they\ntake one of these tests and that a child\nis deemed as having autism um um will\nthe will the one-year-old or the you\nknow two-year-old immediately go into\nbehavioral interventions well so usually\nyou need to have the diagnosis of autism\nand then there are behavioral\ninterventions a variety of different\nones um that are used there are some\nstudies where um because autism is\nhighly heritable you can have one child\nwith autism and then you if you have\nsubsequent children you're at an\nincreased risk of having subsequent\nchildren with autism and these are\ncalled Baby sibling studies so what\nyou're doing is enriching the population\nof infants that you follow\nprospectively um who are more likely to\nreceive an Autism diagnosis and there\nare studies where some of those children\nare enrolled in Behavioral Studies even\nwhen they're quote unquote at\nrisk I've heard before that you know\nparents in which one or typically both\nparents are say of the engineering mathy\nphysics quote unquote hard science\nscience type are um more likely to have\nautistic children is that true I mean\ndid that bear out in the data you know\nif you look at profession or or um you\nknow undergraduate major uh does any of\nthat correlate with the probability of\nhaving an autistic child yeah well what\nI can say is that there's been some\nstudies so what we know is that autistic\ntraits are continuously distributed\nacross the general population and there\nwas a study and there's a couple\ndifferent instruments that are used used\nto be able to measure these autistic\ntraits so there's something called the\nsocial responsiveness scale and then\nthat's a us-based instrument and there's\nan Autism quotient that's a similar\nmeasure that was um designed in England\nand what what we know from work with the\nAQ is that individuals that are in\nintense stem Fields like engineering\nphysics and math have a greater burden\nof autistic traits even if they don't\nhave an Autism\ndiagnosis okay so that leads me to\nwonder whether or not this whole\nbusiness of a spectrum yeah is actually\nmultiple spectry spectrums is it\nspectrums or spectry what someone will\nput it in the in the comments on YouTube\nwe know that for sure please let me know\nI would like to know what is the plural\nof spectrum spectrums um you know\nbecause when we hear the word spectrum\nwe think okay there's a spectrum of\nseverity right and in fact I have some\nexperience with um severe autism not in\nmy family but where I went to\nundergraduate University uh UC Santa\nBarbara down the way from that school\nwas the Deo school which was a school\nwhich um has been there for a long time\nthat um parents would send their kids if\nthey were quote unquote severely\nautistic it was actually where um Dustin\nHoffman went to um study for his role in\nRainman and the uh the kids who were\nreally delightful they used to come into\ntown every once in a while to the coffee\nshop where I'd study and they would also\ncontinue on from there to Kmart which is\nwhy the Dustin Hoffman character would\nsay gotta go to Kmart gotta go to he\nwould do that repetition right that\nKmart was down the road from our you\nknow our College housing and the Deo\nSchool those kids were literally in a um\naway from home facility\nfull-time and I spoke to some of the\nparents at one point and they were at\nthat facility meaning the parents had\nsent them their children away to live\nthere full-time of course they'd get\nvisits and they'd get visits home um\nbecause they were I suppose we could say\nat the far end of some spectrum that\nmade it at least to the parents idea\nimpossible for them to be at home okay\nnow at the other end of the spectrum if\none is just simply thinking in terms of\nseverity I know people who have\nself-identified as a autistic that's how\nthey've referred to it so I feel\ncomfortable um saying that they've said\nI am autistic um and they seem pretty\nhigh functioning meaning they have\ndriver's licenses drive cars are in\nhealthy relationships and manage life\napparently well um they have some traits\nthat yes I would agree are a little bit\ndifferent right so this is where we get\ninto neurode Divergence right um but I\nguess the point is you know should we\nthink about autism as on a spectrum or\ngiven the fact that there are these um\nkind of collections of different traits\ncould there be a spectrum of severity\nalso a spectrum of um you know more\nstereotype behaviors um another spectrum\nthat intersects with that that has to do\nwith you know obsession with a\nparticular topic you know you could\nimagine that there are you know 50 or 60\ndifferent Spectra or spectrums I still\ndon't know which one to say and that\nwhen we talk about the Spectrum we're\nreally talking about something that's in\nmultiple dimensions and not just one\nline that goes from severe to mild does\nthat make sense yeah I mean I think this\nis where understanding the biological\nbasis of behavior would then allow us to\nbe able to say you like here's these\ndifferent dimensions right but not\nunderstanding the biology you're left\nwith okay we're are we lumpers or\nSplitters like how do we think about\nthis because autism is highly heritable\nso there's about 40 to 80% of autism is\num is genetic right so these vary wildly\nright but the but the common thinking is\nthat the majority about 50% of autism is\num is associated with common genetic\nvariants and so the way that we've\nalways thought about this is that there\nis this you know autism is largely an\ninherited polygenic condition and but\nwhat I mean by that is that you have a\nlot of common variants that are additive\nand so if you think about this\ncollection of common genetic variant\nthat underly the Spectrum right so if\nyou have less of a dosing of some of\nthese common variants you might see\nsomebody who's a lot more who's higher\nfunctioning like you said and if you end\nup with one of these single Gene High\npenetrant um disorders you might see\nsevere intellectual disability and sort\nof lower functioning on the other end of\nthe spectrum but I think that there is a\nlot that we don't know and what you're\nbringing up I think underlines you know\nsort of an issue with autism autism\nwhich is common for many brain disorders\nwhich is like if you don't understand\nthe underlying biological basis it also\ngets very difficult to diagnose and\ntreat right and that's where we are with\na lot of different you know psychiatric\nand neurodevelopmental disorders to date\nhas there been any specific neural\nnetwork that we can point to and say Ah\nthat's the neural network that seems to\nbe different in people who are on the\nautism spectrum um I saw a study\npublished recently that seemed to point\nto the idea that the genes that are\naltered in autism um at least include a\nlarge number of genes that are altered\nor the proteins that are the consequence\nof those genes are altered\nand exist at the synapse at the\nconnections between neurons and I'm\nasking it that way because you know some\nyears ago I was at a talk on autism at\nStanford and someone raised their hand\nand says um do we even know that autism\nis a brain issue right could couldn't it\nbe an issue of you know the immune\nsystem or the cardiovascular system\nwhich at the time seemed like okay gosh\nof course it's but wait then you stop\nand you think that's a really good\nquestion right how do we know it's a\nit's a challenge of the brain right I\nthink that's a great question right and\nthere may be people talk about\njust take for a moment that this is a\nbrain disorder how do you study it in\npeople right so you know it's very\ndifficult to get access to either\ncerebral spinal fluid which is a fluid\nthat bathes the brain um brain tissue\nbiopsies it's very hard to get people\nespecially children that are really\nimpacted into a brain scanner right\nbecause they can't sit still they may\nhave sensory issues they don't want to\ngo into a scanner right so a lot of the\ntools that neuroscientists or or\npsychiatrist have to think about looking\nat the brain are um limited right and\nthen and then the other part is how do\nyou model so the other way we might\nthink about getting access or or\nthinking about model systems what we\nneed to do is think about the control\nanimals and we need to make sure that\nthe species that we're modeling them in\nhas um features of control humans if you\nwill so we need to have complex\ncognitive abilities we need to have\ncomplex social skills we need to have an\norganism that has Vision as its primary\nsensory modality right potentially sleep\nconsolidating so we need to think about\nall of those and and the the tricky part\nI think until fairly recently was that\nwe were doing all of this work in Mouse\nmodels and you know the control mice\njust fundamentally lack many of the\ncharacteristics that are needed to model\nyou know autism with Fidelity right and\nI think that's you know when we look at\ndrug development pipelines about 50% of\npreclinical failures so that would be\nsomething that's tested in an animal\nthat works and then fails in a human\nclinical drug trial 50% of those\nfailures can be attributed to poorly\nselected animal models and so I think\npart of where we we will be getting\ntraction is picking you know developing\nsophisticated models as a sort of point\nof entry into being able to understand\nsome of these things that are really\ndifficult us studying people yeah such a\nkey point and um for those that um have\nnot heard of pre-clinical models\npre-clinical models are non-human models\nso it could be Mouse could be nonhuman\nprimate could be flies or worms for that\nmatter but uh we're going to talk a lot\nabout non-human primate preclinical\nmodels um and the work that you've been\ndoing and of course also the work that\nyou've been doing in humans um the other\nanimal um the other private the other\nprimate right exactly I love to remind\npeople that we're primates um Old World\nprimates um thank you for doing that so\nyou've been talking about the genetic\ninfluences on autism and of course genes\nin the environment interact right it's\nnever nature or nurture it's always an\ninteraction and that isn't just about\nthe epig genome it's also just about the\nfact that nature impacts the genome and\nour genome impacts the way that we\ninteract with the environment Etc so\nwhat is the role of the environment in\nautism both the frequency and the\npresentation of autism right so I mean\nthere are again lots of different\nepidemiological studies so um Advanced\nparental age uh prematurity severe\nprematurity is a risk factor for autism\num maternal illness during pregnancy um\nso there's there's a bunch of different\nthings that have been associated with an\nincreased risk for autism in terms of\nenvironmental influences and how they\ncan intersect with Biology um one of the\nthings that I was really struck by in\nthe early 2000s that at least by my read\nof the literature hasn't really gone\nanywhere was this idea that was proposed\nby pashco who used to run the\nneurobiology department um at Yale um\nexpert in brain neuro anatomy in\nnon-human primates and in humans\nembryology um really luminary of our\nfield and he had a series of papers\nexploring how the migration of neurons\nduring early development you know it's\nyou and I both know but most people out\nthere probably don't know because we\nhaven't covered this in the podcast um\nit's not typical dinner table\nconversation you know when you when an\nembryo when a human embryo is developing\nthe the neurons are born at one location\nand they migrate out some distance to\ntheir final um resting place where then\nthey grow out their connections and\nconnect with one another and that\nprocess of neuron neuronal migration is\noh so critical for the eventual wiring\nof the brain and rakes had this idea\nthat perhaps and I really want to\nemphasize perhaps that the more frequent\nincidents of autism might be correlated\nwith the increase in early prenatal\nultrasound and he had these papers\npublished in number of really\nhigh-profile journals including\nproceedings of the National Academy and\nScience and elsewhere showing that in a\nmouse model if you do\nUltrasound with each successive\nultrasound you got more migration errors\nright so there to me was a you know an\ninteresting example of of the\nenvironment frequency of ultrasound and\ncell migration having some sort of\ninteraction but it seemed like it never\nwent anywhere it never got tacked to\nokay you should keep in mind the number\nof ultrasounds that you're getting for\nyour child and of course ultrasounds are\ncritical for for pregnant women to get\nbecause they can Stave off a number of\ndevelopmental issues and they're super\nimportant but you know we've heard about\nultrasound you know it within the\nscientific literature and then\noccasionally we'll hear other theories\nabout okay it's having two parents who\nare both engineers and then we'll hear\noh you know it's um you know toxicity in\nthe food environment we've heard you\nknow hypothesis about vaccines or the\nthe adant that the vaccines are\ncontained in you know in that large\ncloud of the\nhas anything really um emerged from them\nas like okay there really seems to be at\nleast one major risk factor\nenvironmental risk factor because I feel\nlike all those theories I come up get\nsome popular press bunch of papers are\npublished sometimes those papers are\nretracted like in the case of the\nvaccines um and then the theory kind of\ndies yeah so is there any specific\nenvironmental influence on autism that\nwe can say yes they're really seems to\nbe something there yeah I I mean it's a\nit's a really spectacularly good\nquestion I think the tricky part about\nit is that every single person that\ncomes into a trial has a different\ngenetic background right and so until we\ncan have these a priori stratified\ntrials where you could then you know as\na good scientist you would only\nmanipulate maybe one two variables at a\ntime right but when you're doing these\nlarge epidemiological studies because\nyou can't it's very difficult to do\nexperimental studies right especially\nwith developing children um I think\nthat's an incredibly difficult study to\ndo right so there's been an interest in\nthis field of there's these neurogenetic\nsyndromes that have high penetrance for\nautism which basically means that you\ncould have a disorder um or you know\nanother genetic condition let's say it\ndoesn't have to be a single Gene but\nthat a lot of those kids tend to also\nget an Autism diagnosis and so there's\nbeen work and like so for instance\nfragile X is a good example where\nbecause autism is so diverse in terms of\nclinical presentation that let's say you\nhave a medication that could work for a\nhandful of kids in the trial you may not\nbe statistically powered to see it right\nso so you know the way I think about the\nautism world is there's so little we\ndon't know so think about being in a\ndark room and you have a flashlight and\nyou only see where you shine the light\nright and so if you think about a very\nheterogeneous genetic heterogeneous\nstudy it's going to be very difficult to\ntease out these pieces because an\nenvironmental risk factor um might be a\ndriver for one kid but not another right\nand so I think what we need to do is to\nhave these genetically defined subgroups\nof individuals and then be able to test\nthe G by Gene by environment\ninteractions or in this genetically\ndefined group of individuals um can we\ntest this certain medication to see if\nit's beneficial for this subgroup of\nchildren got it so you you mentioned\nfragile X which um we know um presents\nwith autism like symptoms in some cases\nand then I think of another disease like\num Timothy syndrome a mutation in an L\nType calcium channel which um for those\nof you that don't know what these cell\ntype calcium channels are they're\nthey're not just important for the\nfunction of neurons in the brain they're\nreally important for the function of\nneurons and other other tissues\nincluding heart tissue right so um kids\nwith Timothy Syndrome have cardiac\nissues yeah and they have autism so you\nknow I think it's important for us to\nkind of explore this a bit because in\nmost people's minds you know kids with\nautism have autism and occasionally\nthey'll have other issues you know gut\nissues or heart issues or um muscular\nskeletal issues but we often think that\nthat's the consequence of the autism but\noften times that they have multiple\nthings going on and the autism actually\ncould be secondary or independent of the\nother thing that's going on so this is\nwhat leads me back to this idea of a\nspectrum you know is you know is it\npossible that what we call autism is\nactually like 50 different disorders or\n50 different conditions depending on\nwhat one wants to call them um I mean\nwhat is autism really I mean is it it's\nwhat does it really center around what\nand I I think here maybe it's useful to\ngo like do we go to the diagnostic\ncriteria like how do we decide if a\nchild has autism if they also have a\nbunch of other things that are\nchallenging them I I think that that's\nThe $64,000 Question right and and and\nagain in other areas of medicine so if\nyou think about let's think about cancer\nbiology right like decades ago somebody\nwould come in with cancer and you would\nhit them with radiation chemotherapy and\nthat was the best that we could do right\nbut with the invention of a lot of\nmolecular tools you can remove a a tumor\nand you can do molecular profiling and\neven you know have personalized\nmedications made right to attack that t\ntumor and so you know know what's really\ntricky when you have a behavioral\ndiagnosis that's not\nbiologically defined you you see a lot\nof heterogeneity so it's incredibly\ndifficult I think to answer this\nquestion because we don't know how many\nkinds of\nautismsocial people people I've heard\nclinicians say well that's not really\nautism right that's a piece of fragile X\nright but if it's a behavioral diagnosis\nand they meet be behavioral criteria it\nbecomes this weird circular argument\nright so like until we really understand\nwhat autism is I I I think that it's\ngoing to be very tricky to start you\nknow\nsubing different aspects of the\ncondition as we all know quality\nnutrition influences of course our\nphysical health but also our mental\nhealth and our cognitive functioning our\nmemory our ability to learn new things\nand to focus and we know that one of the\nmost important features of highquality\nnutrition is making sure that we get\nenough vitamins and minerals from\nhighquality unprocessed or minimally\nprocessed sources as well as enough\nprobiotics and prebiotics and fiber to\nsupport basically all the cellular\nfunctions in our body including the gut\nmicrobiome now I like most everybody try\nto get optimal nutrition from Whole\nFoods ideally mostly from minimally\nprocessed or nonprocessed Foods however\none of the challenges that I and so many\nother people face is getting enough\nservings of high quality fruits and\nvegetables per day as well as fiber and\nprobiotics that often accompany those\nfruits and vegetables that's why way\nback in 2012 long before I ever had a\npodcast I started drinking ag1 and so\nI'm delighted that ag1 is sponsoring the\nhubman Lab podcast the reason I started\ntaking ag1 and the reason I still drink\nag1 once or twice a day is that it\nprovides all of my

a1.com\nhuberman to claim that special offer\nwell probably a good time for us to\nthink about the work that you've done in\nterms of trying to tack the biology of\nsocial\ncommunication and behavior yeah right\nthose things interact not just language\nbut also Behavior to autism in humans\nusing non-human primate models and then\nof course to also discuss some of the\nwork that you've been doing in humans\nand we can't have that discussion\nwithout first having a discussion about\ntwo neuropeptides that I think most\npeople have heard of at least one of\nthem and I think there's a lot of\nmisunderstanding about but you're going\nto clarify that for us which are\noxytocin and vasopressin so before we\ndive into the uh the important work that\nyou've been doing on vasopressin in\nparticular but also oxytocin and\nautism what are oxytocin and vasopress\nreally okay so they're these small\nlittle peptide they're nine amino acids\nlong are very tiny they only differ by\ntwo amino acids and they're these\nancient peptides that are hundreds of\nmillions of years old and in almost any\nspecies studied um whether it's the\ncurrent version you might have vasit\ntocin or other Mosin which are um sort\nof precursor forms in other species but\nthey're highly evolutionarily conserved\nand they're involved in social behavior\num in pretty much any it could be egg\nlaying it could be you know but but\nreproduction and social behavior across\nthe philogenetic tax so house cats make\nvasopressin and oxytocin humans\nobviously make vasopressin and oxytocin\nand pretty much every other species that\nhas to interact with and connect with\nother members of its species especially\nmammals right so oxytocin and vasor\npressin are pervasive and Maman species\ndo the different species tend to make\noxytocin and vasopressin in similar\nbrain areas and tissues um yes but not\ncompletely overlapping but I I think the\nthing that the the beautiful mystery\nabout these and the infuriating piece of\nthem is that because they're so\nstructurally similar um they can have\nsimilar effects and they there's four\nreceptors that they bind to so if you\nthink about a hormone or a\nneurotransmitter so oxytocin vasor\npressent if you think about them like a\nkey and a receptor like a lock and you\nhave to put them together to open a door\nopen Behavior they can bind to these\nfour receptors so it can be very\ndifficult to\ndisentangle which one is acting and at\nwhich receptor and where in the brain oh\nso oxytocin vasopressin are chemically\nsimilar yes interesting yes and uh where\nwould you say lies their greatest um\noutput Divergence which is just nerd\nspeak for um is there an example of\nsomething that oxytocin does that\nvasopressin doesn't and vice versa yeah\nokay so what's really fascinating is\nthese two neurotransmitters or hormones\nwere discovered for their peripheral\neffects which basically means not in\ntheir brain but somewhere in their body\nand so oxytocin's involved in um uterine\ncontractions and milk let down and so\nwas during lactation so people sort of\nalways thought of it as the female\nhormone and then vasopress has um at\nleast in the in the peripheral system\nhas been involved in um urine regul like\nurinary output regulation blood pressure\num and so we only knew about their their\nphysiological roles as their sort of\nclassic hormones for decades and what\nwas interesting is these um like naming\nconventions are fascinating medicine\nright so you could name a virus after\nwhere it was first found right or it\ncould be named after somebody who\ndiscovered the disease like Alzheimer's\nfor instance is a good example and what\nwas interesting oxytocin was only named\nonce vasor pressin was named twice so\nit's either called Arginine vasor\npressin or anti-diuretic hormone and so\nit had two different names and so as you\ncan imagine sometimes genes are named\ntwice and so somebody in cancer is\nstudying one Gene and somebody and\nautism is studying another and they're\nnot even communicating because they\ndon't even realize that they've at least\nhistorically now we have all kinds of\nGene annotation sites so it's less\nlikely to happen now but but what was\nfascinating is they were these hormones\nwere named oxytocin is Greek for quick\nbirth so for decades people only\nappreciated their physiological roles\nbut but there were neuron anatomist\nsaying hey so these are both made\nthey're made in a lot of different\nplaces but the the the action sort of\nhappens in the hypothalamus where\nthey're made and there were anatomists\nthat said wait these sort of project\nback into the brain what are these doing\nin the brain and one of my favorite\nhistorical stories was um I had a mentor\num uh a colleague like an you know who I\ndidn't train with but he was um a real\nsource of wisdom to me for many years\nand his name is Court Peterson and he\ntold me this wonderful story about this\nduuk oologist named Peter claer and um\nPeter was studying ulet so sheep and\ngoats and he wrote a story of paper in\n1971 called Mother Love what turns it on\nand um you know one thing about science\nis I love going back and seeing where do\nthe Pearls of Wisdom come from and so he\nwrote this and said you know oxytocin is\norchestrating all these events of\nmotherhood and there are sheep and goats\nin particular that have offspring that\nare precocious meaning they're basically\nborn ready you know within an hour they\ncan run with the herd unlike our species\nwhich is altricial meaning we have very\nhelpless infants and mom needs to bond\nreally quickly with that baby if it's\ngoing to be running around and you only\nyou know from an evolutionary\nperspective you want to be investing in\nthe baby that's yours not somebody\nelse's right and um he hypothesized that\nit was oxytocin that was being\nco-released into the brain and during\nmilk let down that was what turned\nMother Love on and that was really the\nbeginning of this whole field of\nthinking and so that opened up thinking\nabout oxytocin in rodent maternal care\nand a variety of other instances can I\njust briefly interrupt you because I\nfind this so interesting and I know it's\ninteresting to everyone listening as\nwell because you know yes and thank you\nfor making it clear that oxid doin has\nmany different roles um but this role of\nMother Love and bonding to infant um has\nme needing to ask whether or not the\nidea was that oxytocin is released in\nthe mother when she interacts with her\nown baby um and that leads me to the\nquestion is oxytocin also released in\nthe baby um in reaction to to the mother\nand how long is that effect lasting\nbecause in order to have a pervasive\nbond with that baby and not just some\nother baby and of course we still have\nvisual cues and you know we know our\nbaby versus another baby most instances\num there are rare exceptions or perhaps\nnot so rare exceptions but leaving those\naside you\nknow the mechanism that would allow for\nmother infant bonding and infant mother\nbonding by way of oxytocin presumably is\nsomething that is literally changing\ntheir brains saying it's you are the are\nthe center of my life right and the baby\nof course is saying well you are my life\nbecause you are the source of life right\ncertainly for the early part um early\npart of life and that nowadays it seems\nthat that that can extend well into the\nuh the teens and 20s for some people but\num you how how is oxytocin working is it\nis it working over the course of minutes\nhours is there some specificity of this\nbaby and this mom that links them in in\nsome more pervasive way I mean how is\noxytocin doing this magic of bonding\nyeah I mean it's it's very species\nspecific right so I think that and you\nneed to think about like The\nevolutionary history of the species\nright so if you think about sheep or\ngoats the early studies that were done\nare you um The Passage through the\nvaginal Canal was what you know so you\nwould activate oxytocin receptors that\nway but if you gave an oxytocin\nantagonist meaning you would give into\nthe brain something that blocked the\noxytocin receptors so if the oxytocin is\nbeing released into the BL brain but you\nhave a pharmacological agent blocking\nits ability to bind to its receptors\nthese sheep and goats wouldn't um bond\nto their baby for instance so literally\nthe passage of the baby out of the\nvaginal Canal triggers the oxytocin\npathway the release of oxytocin as in\nlactation does too nature is so\nbeautiful because if you had to pick one\nevent yeah to trigger the release of\noxytocin if oxytocin's role is to create\nbonding with offspring that would be the\nevent because that's a tough one to\nmistake right right but but what I will\nsay because I think you will you know to\navoid you getting attacked on Twitter or\nwherever you might I'm GNA get attacked\nanyway if not if not for this discussion\nthen another one but I'm tougher than I\nlike so um but it's really species\nspecific right so if you think about our\nspecies and a lot of primate species we\nlive in these extended family groups and\nthat's how we evolved and so unlike a\ngoat or a sheep that might live in a\nherd where there's a lot of\nnon-relatives we lived in a community of\nrelatives right and so we and we do all\nkinds of care of extended relatives and\nso you wouldn't necessarily expect in a\nprimate species where you have this long\nrearing history where help from the\nfamily and and biparental care where\nwhere sort of everybody sort of like it\ntakes a village to raise the baby we\nreadily adopt in our in primate\nsocieties right and so you know um like\nI had a CE I mean I'll tell you\nsomething personal I had a C-section um\nand uh had I had a lot of postpartum\ncomplications and so lactation didn't\nwork out that well for me one of my\nfriends would say um I massive um DVS\nand Pulmonary emop and so I almost died\nafter my son was born the first time and\nso I didn't have a vaginal delivery I\ncouldn't\nDVT thrombosis yeah and it was sort of\nlike welcome to Motherhood and I was in\nthe ICU and um had to get a filter put\nin um an inferior vnea filter to um stop\nme from dying because the I had\nscattershot clots all over my lungs and\nso I didn't really you know I didn't I I\ndidn't do a vaginal delivery I had a\nC-section and I wasn't really able to\nlactate and man I love that baby right\nso you know I can give you know what I\nwill say is um it's really different in\nprimates and we don't really understand\nhow bonding occurs but what I will say\nis that bonding between a mother you\nreally need to think about the\nevolutionary selective pressure so I was\nan evolutionary biologist before I found\nNeuroscience right and so I really\neverything I do I think about from an\nevolutionary perspective um so but it it\nis um many people go into the oxytocin V\noppressing field because they have a lot\nof questions about social interactions\nright like I think if you think about us\nis being social is actually one of the\none of the core characteristics of our\nspecies right so social interactions are\nrewarding from infancy they Keep Us\nAlive as you mentioned right and so I\nthink it's not an accident that the way\nwe think about disorder in our species\nis many disorders are disorders because\nof lack of social connectedness right so\nit could be something like autism where\nyou know there's these pervasive social\ninteraction impairments it could be\nsomething like drug abuse where you know\nyou you a risk factor for drug abuse is\nfeeling you know socially disconnected\nand alone right um social um isolation\nor loss of a loved one is a very strong\npredictor of the onset of a stress\nrelated depressive anxiety disorder in\nterms of when and how oxytocin is\nreleased you mentioned um mother infant\nbonding um I think you said yes that the\ninfant is also releasing oxytocin we\nthink um so it's it's bidirectional um\nwe think I think most of the work has\nbeen done in mom would be and and again\nthis has not been really done well in\nprimates right so we're extrapolating\nthis information from species that have\ndifferent evolutionary histories than us\nright so it's go sheeps um Prairie vs\nmice rats so what do we know about the\nrole of oxytocin in humans do I mean we\nknow it's there yeah we presume based on\nthe animal models that it's involved in\nmother infant bonding um and presumably\nromantic partner bonding at least you\nhear that a lot um it was unfortunately\nnicknamed The Love hormone yes um and\nthe reason it's unfortunate it was is\nthat while that might cue attention to\noxytocin and I'm you know a big fan of\npeople paying attention to biological\nphenomena it uh it discards the other\nand many roles of of oxytocin but yeah\nwhat can we say about oxytocin in humans\nif anything like do we know that it does\nI mean we're just so we're assuming\nbased on the animal models that it does\nsomething I mean this is very different\nthan like dopamine where there's tons of\nanimal model data but we know but they\nbrain Imaging where we know where\ndopamine is expressed and do we even\nknow where oxytocin receptors are\nexpressed in the human brain presumably\nthat information is is out there\nrecently but again there's a lot of\nspecificity and I think if you're\nthinking about disorders you would then\nhave to study those specific\nsubpopulations right and and you need\nyou know a lot of this work has been\ndone so you have to think about how do\nwe study it right so the best way to\nstudy it would be to have radio tracers\nwhere you could then which we do have\nfor dopamine and and other compounds\nwhere you would then go and see where\nafter somebody's performed a task do we\nsee you know um activation right or\nuptake um there are some Imaging studies\nthey're usually done giving intranasal\noxytocin um and then you basically ask\nquestions about okay we give you\noxytocin and trenas which presumably\nenters the brain there's we could talk\nabout reasons why we think that um and\nthen we have you perform on some task\nright and so you know there's evidence\nif you give oxytocin it diminishes the\namygdala's response um to fearful\nstimuli right so that it might have this\nsort of pro-social effect and and it was\nactually data like that that caused\npeople to start thinking um initially\nabout oxytocin and those are data on\nhumans that's right it reminds me that\nthere was this brief moment where\noxytocin wasn't just being discussed as\nthe love hormone it it was being\ndiscussed as the trust hormon right also\num far too simple heuristic but but\nagain I think it's cool that the you\nknow that the the Press picks up on\nthese things and at least tells people\nabout what's being discovered and we\njust always have to be careful that not\num uh have it leads the assumption that\nthat's the only role of a given of a\ngiven hormone so um it can reduce\napparently it can reduce the output of\nthe amydala in some way this brain area\nassociated with um threat detection um\nand so you could imagine how that would\nbias the person toward being more\npro-social right um have there been\nstudies exploring the role of oxytocin\nin making autistic children more\npro-social and behind that question I\nsuppose is the assump you can verify or\nor not that autistic children are less\npro-social than other children um is\nthat true um or is it that you know\nautistic kids are just maybe more\npro-social with the one friend they\nreally really like um I happen to know\nsome kids uh with autism or however you\nwant to phrase it and um they have close\nfriends and they seem to really like\nthose specific friends a lot like they\nseem very happy when they show up at the\ndoor and like all all the Hallmarks of\nyou know healthy social mind but it is\ntrue that they are uncomfortable in in\ngroups and where there's a lot of noise\na busy birthday party is overwhelming\nfor them but you see them playing with\none or two friends and like you could\nsee all that and assume okay it's just\nkind of an introverted kid actually kind\nof reminds me of me you know I mean I\ndon't have a problem with crowds but I I\nmuch prefer to be with a small group of\nfriends or one close friend so I hear\nyou I'm that way too right so um you\nknow how do we think about this um okay\nwell I would say the social features of\nautism are interesting right and so you\nmight have there were there was an\nattempt a long time ago like 1979\nthere's a woman named Lura Wing who\ntried to subtype the social features of\nautism right and so there could be\npeople um that are socially avoidant and\nreally just don't want to have social\ninteractions there could be kids that\nare um active but odd which means that\nthey have an interest in being social\nbut maybe they don't read social cues\nright and they interact in ways that\nother kids don't understand or make\ncould cause bullying right and sounds\nlike Junior High School yeah exactly um\nand and that's often why um you know\nsome autistic kids do better with adults\nright because adults know how to sort of\nChannel um discussions with somebody who\nmight be a little socially awkward right\nbut there's different phenotypes I mean\nuh people having a disinterest in social\ninteractions could be that they're\nhighly socially anxious right um that\nmaking eye contact makes them anxious\nyou again that's another caveat um there\nhave been some studies administering\noxytocin to individuals with autism and\nagain these are these single dose\nstudies so the first studies that were\nwere done were looking at single dose\noxytocin in males because some of the\nand we can talk a little bit about why\noxytocin versus vasopressin which\nvasopressin actually would have been my\nchoice um based on the animal literature\nand we can talk about that but vas\noxytocin was given to males um partly\nbecause it wouldn't the idea would be\nthat the of Target effects in the\nperipheral nervous system I.E milk let\ndown uterine contraction are not going\nto happen in males right and so that it\nwas deemed that they might be safer\nsubjects males are often also the the\ngo-to for research studies as you may\nhave talked about on on your podcast\nbefore too something that fortunately is\nchanging thanks to a mandate by the uh\nby the NIH correct um I I had to just\nkind of um smile slash um raise my\neyebrows a little bit at the idea that\nyou know the the assumption that\noxytocin administered to males yes one\ncan see why it wouldn't cause milk down\nor uterine contract\nbut um but of there could be other\nperipheral effects ofto and males but\nthey had to pick they had to pick one so\nthey went with males okay so um and\nthere is this higher incidence of autism\nin males so it's not a terrible place to\nstart you just would hope that they\nwould also do the the experiment on\nfemales but um so they're doing this by\nnasal spray so intranasal one dose\ncorrect and for reasons that I don't\nunderstand it's 24 international units\nand I think maybe somebody did the first\nstudy using it and you know this is how\nscience happens right and it worked and\nso then everyone uses that protocol and\nso then there's been a lot of studies\nlooking at um you know there's one\nreading the mind and the eyes so can you\nlook at pictures of somebody's eyes and\nthen ask what is the emotion that\nthey're feeling right after receiving\nthis or Placebo um where's your eye gaze\ngoing in a picture right so one of one\nof the theories is that people with\nAutism May at least a subset of them\nlack social motivation so maybe they're\nnot looking in the places like eyes\nwhere you rece receive a lot of social\ncues that are relevant to social\ncommunication and so some of these early\nstudies showed that a single dose of\noxytocin in people that were um had high\nfunctioning autism so they were verbal\nlike you said they could come in for\nstudies and that it looked like it had\nsome potential Effectiveness and so\nthere became a really strong interest in\nthe field to think about oxytocin\npotentially is a therapy for autism and\nis oxytocin available over the counter\ndoes it require prescription I I mean\nyou see sites that are selling it but\nthat doesn't mean anything these days\nright um there's gry Market there's all\nsorts of stuff going on um but I know\npeople that have used oxytocin um\nthere's actually a market for and by the\nway folks I'm not suggesting this but\nsomeone the other day told me that\nthey've been regularly taking um uh\noxytocin ketamine nasal inhalations um\nas part of their work with their\nlicensed therapist on um like PTSD type\nstuff relating to let's just call it\nrelational trauma okay um so that's\nhappening um but let's just think about\noxytocin alone for the moment um are\nparents of of autistic kids able to like\nbuy oxytocin nasal spray no so so it\nwould need to be written like the\nprescription would be need to be written\nby a um by a physician um and it's not\non the market right so there's one thing\nwe should say is there's only two drugs\nthat are approved by the FDA to treat\nautism and they're both antis psychotics\nwhich they um they treat Associated\nfeatures like irritability and they have\noff Target effects like weight gain and\nand and you know so we don't have any\nmedications that are currently approved\nin the US or anywhere else for that\nmatter to treat the core features of\nautism interesting and um unfortunate um\nand hopefully that will change in the\nnot too distant future um do we know\nthat children autism people with Autism\nbecause I'm going to just sort of assume\nthat um autism is stable over the\nlifespan um like if a child is diagnosed\nwith autism are they going to be an\nadolescent and adult with autism so I\nwould say that in a lot of cases autism\nhas lifelong impact but there are people\nwho outgrow their diagnosis um you know\nthere are people who respond well to\nbehavioral therapy um I mean obviously\nit's not the Cure All for everybody\nthere's lots of people who go through\nintensive behavioral therapy and\nprobably see minimal benefits um but I\nmean it's certainly something that\noccurs in childhood for the diagnosis\noccurs in childhood and it you know for\nmost people will then be present across\nthe lifespan so we could say people with\nAutism because each study sometimes\nwe'll have adults sometimes you'll have\nteenagers sometimes you'll have\nkids I'd like to take a quick break and\nthank our sponsor insid tracker insid\ntracker is a personalized nutrition\nplatform that analyzes data from your\nblood and DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help you reach\nyour health goals now I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term Health can only be\nanalyzed from a quality blood test a\nmajor problem with a lot of blood tests\nout there however is that you get\ninformation back about metabolic factors\nlipids and hormones and so forth but you\ndon't know what to do with that\ninformation with inside tracker they\nmake it very easy because they have a\npersonalized platform that allows you to\nsee the levels of all those things\nmetabolic factors lipids hormones Etc\nbut it gives you specific directives\nthat you can follow that relate to\nnutrition behavioral modifications\nsupplements Etc that can help you bring\nthose numbers into the ranges that are\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninsid tracker you can go to insid\ntracker.com huberman to get 20% off any\nof insid tracker's plans again that's\ninsid\ntracker.com\nhuberman is it known whether or not\npeople with Autism assuming they meet\nthe criteria for being autistic at that\nat that moment um have lower natural\ncirculating or active levels of oxytocin\nbecause you know it's one thing for a\nnasal spray to um of oxytocin to improve\nsocial functioning it's another um to\nknow that it that the effect is\naddressing an underlying biological\ndeficit yeah that's it's such a great\nquestion okay so we should unpack that\nbecause there's been a lot of work in\nthis area so the first question is where\nare we measuring the oxytocin right so\nwe mentioned oxytocin has all kinds of\neffect in the body as well as the brain\nand it's released into the blood but\nit's also released directly into the\nbrain and there's variable evidence\nabout if you measure it in blood is it a\nreadout of the brain or not right or\nshould you be looking at something like\nspinal fluid that's maybe a a better\nbiochemical proxy of the brain um most\nstudies so what I will say is there were\nthere's been m a handful of small\nstudies where there has been some you\nknow there's been some benefit Maybe no\nbenefit small effects we did a study\nthat was a small study at Stamford and\nit was based on um Mouse genetic data\nand I'll I'll sort of walk you through\nwhat we did um so there's multiple Mouse\nmodels of these neurogenetic syndromes\nwhere um people have social impairment\nright we can Qui quibble about whether\nthat's autism or not but that they have\nsocial impairment and so that there are\nthis um fragile X Mouse there's a PR\nwillly syndrome Mouse which is the\nmagile 2 Gene that um gets manipulated\nand then there's a catnap two mouse and\nin all of those instances when you\ngenetically modify those mice you see a\nreduction of oxytocin in the\nhypothalamus and what's interesting is\nthat um in those instances where you see\nthis genetic modification you do see\nlower blood levels in these genetically\ndefined models what's really cool is you\ncan give oxytocin across development in\nthose models and at least in the cat to\nMouse you can restore oxytocin neuron\nnumber to equivalent of control animals\nsuggesting that oxytocin is doing\nsomething in these oxytocin deficient\nanimals right so these are not an\noxytocin Gene manipulation but these are\nthese syndromes where you see as a\nconsequence of manipulating genes for\nthese syndromes that oxytocin gets\nknocked down right and so our thinking\nwhen we went into our clinical trial was\nwhat if um its blood oxytocin levels\nthat there going to be a subset of\nindividuals that just make less oxytocin\nhumans and that maybe those are the\nindividuals who could who stand to\nbenefit the most from treatment and so\nwe were the first group um to\nask you know across this range of\nindividuals who showed up and we did in\nall the trials that we'll talk about\ntoday um these are done with my\ncolleague Antonio Harden at Stanford\nwho's a child psychiatrist um and we\nalways have double blind meaning that\nthe investigative team is blind and that\nthe um or unaware I should say they're\nunaware of treatment and then the\nfamilies and the children are unaware um\nand then they're randomized meaning\nthere's an equal chance you could get\neither drug or Placebo um and they're\nand they're controlled right okay so we\nasked if we know what your pre\npre-treatment pre-treatment blood\noxytocin level is who's going to benefit\nfrom treatment and we found a couple\nreally interesting things one was that\nthe lower your Baseline so your\npre-treatment blood oxytocin level you\nshowed much greater benefit from the\noxytocin intervention these are children\none one intervention one nasal spray\nthis was four weeks sorry I should have\nclarified this is four weeks of\ntreatment being um administered oxytocin\ntwice a day okay and um and and so we\nsaw Effectiveness there may sorry to\ninterrupt so much but just uh males male\nand female subjects we did but again you\nknow because the autism is male biased\nand prevalence even if you make this\nheroic effort to over recruit try to get\nmore girls in and um in in the study we\nusually try to aim for the prevalence\nrate because it's difficult to get girls\njust because there's fewer of them got\nit okay but um boys and girls were\nincluded they're taking oxytocin over\nthe period of several four weeks and if\nthey started off with lower Baseline\nlevels of oxytocin you observed a\nbenefit of the oxytocin treatment in\nthose individuals what about the\nindividuals who had normal to high you\ndidn't see much benefit right and so\nthat was a a cue to me to think that\nthere may be a subset of individuals\nthat you know for whatever reason they\nhave lower oxytocin and they may stand\nto benefit more from treatment and none\nof the prior studies had looked at blood\noxytocin levels and so what we had\nthought was that well maybe if everybody\nhad measured Baseline blood oxytocin\nlevels maybe some of these you know\nmaybe there would have been more um\npositive outcomes so but there's there's\na lot of controversy in this field about\nwhether oxytocin is a treatment for\nautism right so after we completed that\ntrial there was a large\nmulti-site um what's called a phase\nthree oxytocin treatment trial that was\ndone at I think five sites and they gave\noxytocin for an extended period of time\num and they showed no benefit um and and\nwere they looking to see who started off\nwith low levels of oxytocin at\npre-treatment so what was interesting\nabout that study um and there were a lot\nof issues with it\nwas that um oxytocin is something where\nyou have to if you look at it it\ndegrades it's like that's kind of what I\njoke about right so you need to take it\nwe take when we go in we have like these\nreally intense protocols right so you go\nin and we have vacutainer tubes that are\ncold and we put them on ice and then the\nFLOTUS takes the blood from the child a\nlot of technical gymastics yeah and then\nwe make sure we spin it in a centrifuge\ncold and then we pipe head it onto dry\neyes so like so we have very minimal\nloss of the signal and so if you don't\nadhere to those rigid protocols which is\nvery difficult to do across multiple\nsites um it can be very difficult to get\nan accurate read of oxytocin and so I\nthink for me it's still an open question\num they didn't see that blood oxytocin\npredicted response um in that study um\nthe data weren't provided in the paper\nit was just said that they didn't um but\nit's still an open question\nand so that you know maybe that is the\nway if you give it acutely like in those\nearly studies we talked about that maybe\noxytocin you know diminishes Spar we\nknow that oxytocin decreases um the\nstress axis the hypothalamic pituitary\num adrenal axis and then it can diminish\nanxiety in animal models so we that's\nwell established um and in a former life\nI was a stress researcher so I've spent\na lot of time thinking about this but\nbut it's sort of the sad thing is is\nthat once you have a negative trial it\num there isn't a lot of interest in\nfunding uh the work going forward right\nand so I think it's still really an open\nquestion about if there is a subset of\nindividuals that could benefit from\noxytocin replacement therapy right and\nit's and and until there's money to do\nthat work um we may not ever know the\nanswer well be it will be important for\nthat work to be done eventually\nhopefully the field will return to it\ndespite whatever Trends might be\nhappening now I think it's important to\nknow for the parents of autistic\nchildren um whether or not there were\nany negative effects of oxytocin\nAdministration in particular in the\nchildren that did not benefit from\noxytocin treatment the rationale is the\nfollowing well of course these things\nrequire a prescription um if a parent\nhas a child with autism especially if\nthey're young enough that the behavioral\ninterventions could possibly stand a\ngood chance of inducing neuroplasticity\nrewiring of the neural circuits that\nunderly social connection well then\nthere's this um Tim limited window um in\nwhich you know those parents presumably\nare willing to try most anything\nprovided it's safe right so let's assume\nand I'm making up these numbers now\nbecause I haven't seen this study but\naccording to what you told me that let's\nsay a third of the autistic boys and\ngirls that come in have um low Baseline\nlevels of oxytocin they're the ones that\nare going to benefit from this oxytocin\nintervention the other 23ds don't well\ngiven the difficulties of measuring\nBaseline levels of oxytocin most people\ndon't have access to those kind of\nresources um if it's safe to give\noxytocin no matter what well then if I\nwere that parent I'd be knocking on my\nPhysician's door saying hey give me an\noxytocin spray because my kid might fall\ninto that onethird category if and only\nif it turns out that oxytocin is safe to\ngive but if there's a risk profile that\ndoesn't justify that kind of shotgun\napproach well then I wouldn't do that\nyeah so um is oxytocin spray safe and if\nso why doesn't every physician who has a\npatient with autism give them oxytocin\nnasal spray right it's a great question\nand I I know that you know I'm a parent\nof three children and I know this sense\nof like you would do anything to help\nyour child right and so I I think the\ntricky part is that so one thing I will\nsay is that all of the studies and\nthere's been many of them have shown\nthat oxytocin is um is relatively safe\nin a pediatric population right um the\ntricky part is I don't know there's\nPhysicians that you know really pay\nattention to clinical trials and if they\ndon't see a benefit they may not be\nwilling to write the prescription right\nso until we could identify a group of\nchildren that could benefit you know we\nneed to create the opportunity for\nPhysicians to recognize that this could\npotentially still be a treatment right\nbut that work you know but I I think the\ntricky part and what I will say is and\nwe can maybe talk a bit about vasor\npress which you know my feeling is that\nif I was placing bets and and having to\nchoose between these two my my money\nwould be on vasor press well we are\ndefinitely going to yeah um talk about\nVaso pressent in detail I mean the\nreason I I mentioned that hypothetical\nscenario is just the sense of urgency\nand in some cases desperation that\nparents feel and you know time's ticking\nand if oxytocin's safe then you know um\nI guess I'll put in my vote that you\nknow parents should at least talk to\ntheir physician maybe even hand them the\nstudy um to consider but I can also\nunderstand the perspective of a\npediatrician who says well listen it was\na small number of kids that benefited um\nyou're welcome to try it but I don't you\nknow it doesn't seem like the results\nare that impressive but um you this gets\nto a bunch of larger issues about you\nknow Medical Care and randomized control\ntrials and the desperation of parents\nand kids to treat neurodevelopmental\nchallenges um I I just want to ask\nbecause it feels relevant in a in a real\nway um you know if ultimately the goal\nof improving symptom profiles in\nautistic kids is about improving social\ncognition and social\nbehavior and that process involves\nrewiring of brain circuits\nneuroplasticity is there any reason\nreason to think that other approaches to\ninducing neuroplasticity would be\nbeneficial even if they're not in the\nbiological Pathways that are disrupted\nin autism um I think for instance about\nthe now extensive use of ssris for the\ntreatment of\ndepression some cases it works in some\ncases it doesn't side effect profiles\nare a serious concern yeah as I've\ndiscussed on this podcast before but\nultimately we know that depression is\nnot a serotonin deficiency in most cases\nssris or atypical anti-depressants like\nRyon Wellbutrin and things of that sort\nwhen they work they probably work\nbecause of their ability to induce neuro\nor assist neuroplasticity right right um\nalso the trials on psilocybin are not\nreally about psilocybin they're about\nneuroplasticity at least the trials for\ndepression right there may be other uses\nof psilocybin that relate more directly\nto the effects of psilocybin But\nultimately you know what we're talking\nabout here is the attempt to re wire the\nbrain in a specific way whether or not\nit's assisted by oxytocin or some other\nmechanism so the question is are there\ntrials happening where people are\nexploring say psilocybin MDMA which by\nthe way we know increases oxytocin and\nserotonin dramatically as well as um\nthings like atypical anti-depressants in\nkids that have autism not because we\nthink that those autistic kids are\ndeficient in any of the neurochemical\nthat these drugs would Target but that\nthese drugs can help rewire the brain\nand ultimately that's what these kids\nneed right I it's a really great point\nand I there might be subsets of kids\nright there might be kids where there\nwould be a medication that would Target\nother Pathways but that potently\nreleases oxytocin right that and but\nthere might be kids that have an\noxytocin deficiency right but I think\nthat that circles back to your point at\nthe beginning or our point is that\nautism is a very heterogeneous condition\nand being a\nto know before you begin a trial right\nlike who am I going to put into it and\nwhat is my primary outcome like one\nmeasure that I think is going to move\nthe needle right like it kind of\nrequires a crystal ball so there's a lot\nof guesswork that goes into this um but\nI would very much like to see I I will\nsay one other thing that um there I have\na colleague named Adam guella who's at\nthe University of Sydney and he\npublished a paper a year or two ago now\nsuggesting that oxytocin be may be most\neffective in kids at younger ages and I\nI don't quote me somewhere between two\nand or you know two and five or three\nand six or something find the paper and\nput it in the show show notes but you\nknow so it could be to your point about\nneuroplasticity that oxytocin may be\nmaximally beneficial in younger ages\nright and if you're if these studies are\nthese Haj podes across ages and across\nsort of different social\nphenotypes finding that signal is really\nimportant right and and maybe age is a\ndriver or or maybe you know low blood\noxytocin regardless of what age you are\nor maybe in Adam's case if you recruit\nreally young children you're likely to\nsee a benefit just because the BL the\nbrain is wiring up and it's more plastic\nat you know younger ages yeah that's\nalso a vote um in my opinion um for\nearly examination of kids right like\nparents really need to get autism screen\nand perhaps maybe the most important\nthing is to make autism screening as\navailable and as inexpensive as possible\nfor everyone because of the importance\nof early intervention even if it's\npurely behavioral intervention but\ncertainly if it's behavioral and Drug\nintervention but the clinic wait times\nare really long right so you have to\nhave a specialist who's capable to\ndiagnose autism and so you could have a\nclinic where you know you're showing\nTroublesome features and a parent wants\nto get their kid into a clinic and you\ncould have a 12mth or or 18-month wait\ntime right and so there are a lot of\npeople that are thinking about are there\nare there laboratory based tests that we\ncan develop maybe either for detection\nor clinical referral right so could we\ncome up with a a biomarker panel for\ninstance where we might be able to say\nwow here's some here's a panel where we\nthink this child is at reasonable risk\nfor developing autism can we make sure\nthey're prioritized for getting a\ndiagnosis right so we can get them an an\nearly intervention but right now we\ndon't we don't have that right so having\nsome sort of laboratory based test\nwhether it could be\nbiological um or if we could do\nsomething with ey gaze and there's a lot\nof companies working on these things now\nto say this may not you know and and\nalso obviously again autism is always\ncontroversial in this field right\nthere's so many different stakeholders a\nlot of clinicians will say well I don't\nI don't want a 30-second video clip\nreplacing expert clinical opinion\nthere's good reasons for them to feel\nthat way but I think if there was a way\nto prioritize people that are in this\nline um you know we could get diagnoses\nfaster well you wouldn't want false\npositives but I would think that a 30\nsecond video clip provided itself\nsomething useful is going to be more\nvaluable than nothing yeah given the\ntime sensitivity uh what are some of the\nbarriers to um getting this behavioral\ntesting to be not just more prominent\nbut pervasive like it seems to me that\nwell I recall in school they gave us the\nhearing test we all marched on the bus\nwe get the beep test and you know um you\nknow for hearing um challenges uh we get\nVision tests you get the babinsky reflex\ntest not the moment you come out of the\nwomb but pretty pretty soon after I mean\nwhy isn't this stuff um happening uh for\nautism um for every kid yeah it's not\nscalable right so you these interviews\nwith parents and the tests that you do\ncan take hours right and and any given\nclinician even if they're working really\nlong hours there just aren't that many\npeople that are have the extensive\ntraining needed to make these expert\ndiagnoses right and so I think that\nthere's you know clinicians that are\ndoing the absolute best they can but\nthey can only see a certain number of of\npeople a week right and does it have to\nbe a physician sorry to interrupt does\nit or could it could you know could a\nwell trained technician do this yeah\nwell I mean I I think technically it's a\nDSM diagnos is right so it's usually\nsomebody who has a clinical degree so it\nwould be a clinical psychologist it\ncould be a behavioral pediatrician it\ncould be you know a child psychiatrist\nor child neurologist but I mean again\nthat requires years and years of\ntraining um and if we look in areas\nwhere people have fewer accesses access\nto Resource I mean particularly in\nimpoverished areas the mean age of an\nAutism diagnosis is years later than in\nwealthy areas where you know there's\nmany different medical specialist with\nparents you know that aren't working\nthree jobs and you know can sit waiting\naround you know and and really Lobby and\nand really advocate for their kids right\nbecause you know if they don't show up\nfor work that day they're not going to\nget fired from their job right and so I\nthink that you know if there's some sort\nof solution that allows there to be a\nmore democratic approach to saying we\nneed a really quick way like you said to\nbe able to identify at risk children\nespecially if it's a a blood test or\nsomething like that you know it could be\nincredibly\nimpactful are there human trials\nexploring MDMA methylene dioxy\nmethamphetamine also referred to as\necstasy um and oryan for um treatment of\nautism so I was aware that Maps had an\nMDMA trial in autism um I don't know\nwhat's happened with that yeah perhaps\nit's still ongoing I'll check the map\nsite in communication with them from\ntime to time I mean the the the reason\nfor asking it of course you know but\nmaybe in case um some of the listeners\num don't is the MDMA causes these\nmassive increases in serotonin that\nseems to be the major source of the MDMA\neffect so to speak um based on the work\nof our colleague Rob malanka and um in\nat least one human study comparing um\nMDMA to very high does oxytocin\ntreatment ruled out the oxytocin Spike\nthat's induced by MDMA as the as the\nsource or the only source but of course\nthese chemicals can synergize I mean but\nbased on its chemical profile oxytocin\nrelease massive serotonin release\ndopamine release and a propensity to\nenhance neuroplasticity I mean assuming\nall the safety protocols were were there\num seems like not the perfect drug but\nnot a bad choice um if of course it's\ninducing the kind of plasticity that\nsomeone with autism would be seeking\nright I mean I think I think the tricky\npart especially in children right is\nthere's going to be a reluctance to\npotentially give them psychedelics right\nand so you know is there a way to\nmodify um you know the chemical compound\nto you know be something that parents\nmight be more willing to give to their\nchildren right right and I totally agree\nwith that um I guess to play Devil's\nAdvocate not against you but um uh well\nI'll just state it very directly and\nthen I I'll take the heat as necessary\num I mean I've done two episodes about\nthe uh the drugs that you know Millions\ntens of millions if not hundreds of\nmillions of parents are already giving\ntheir kids for ADHD which are um include\namphetamines including dioxine\nmethamphetamine is actually a\nprescription drug for a very small\nsubset of kids with ADHD but things like\nadderal viance even methylphenidate rlin\nI mean these are amphetamines they\ninduce dopamine release and\nnorepinephrine release and uh again I'm\nnot suggesting people um give their kids\nMDMA um to try and amarate symptoms of\nautism but something chemically similar\nto it ought to be developed or at least\nexplored in a human trial in my in my\nopinion well time will tell I'll reach\nout to the maps group and see see what's\nhappening let's talk about vasopress yes\nbecause there's a lot to discuss there\nso you told us this is a molecule that\nchemically is very similar to oxytocin\num is it manufactured in the human brain\nand body yes okay do we know a subset of\nthe sites that it's known to be produced\nand where it's of its actions are and\nyou mentioned the kidney and the\nanti-diuretic hormone um roles but\nwithin the brain like what brain areas\nhave neurons that make vasopressin well\nor have the receptors for I mean The\nreceptors are all over are all over the\nbrain and again it varies depending on\nthe species and you know the way the\nreceptors are measured or in postmortem\ntissue right which can be very difficult\nto get good samples right and so we need\nto have that caveat going in um but yeah\nI mean it's it's made in the\nhypothalamus um and it's released all\nover the brain and there is vasor press\nand receptors all over the brain right\nand um what's really interesting about\nvaser press and I always sort of joke\nthat oxytocin you know always saw its\nday in the sun if you will and the\nvasopress was sort of the stepchild that\nwas like left you know sort of behind\nand and the reason why I find this\nfascinating is again like I think back\nto my you know my my roots as a you know\nevolutionary biologist behavioral\nneuroscientist and what was interesting\nis that there were studies in the early\nto mid 1990 showing that vasopressin was\ncritical for male social behavior and so\num there was work you know there was a\nvariety of people and I I think Rob\nMinka mentioned this on his on on the\npodcast he did about you know there's a\na group of people like Sue Carter Larry\nyoung Tom inso some of these early\npeople and they gave Vasa pressen to\nmale Prairie voles and V\nvasopressin was what induced um pair\nbonding um with a a female mate and also\npaternal care and and as I recall those\nexperiments were done in the context of\nlooking at um polygamy versus monogamy\nof these Prairie VES um Prairie VES\nversus like a different species so same\num genus but a different species so it\nmight be a Montaine V or you know highly\nrelated but these other species so\nPerales are monogamous the males uh well\nI mean that was the 50% divorce right\nyeah that was I don't think it's that\nbad but I think they're doing better\nthan we are as a species that's true we\nshould look to them for pointers and all\nthe divorce folks are saying wait why'\nyou say better I have some divorce\nfriends that have said divorce is like\nthe greatest thing so we always say like\ndoing better doing worse right um anyway\nthat's a whole other podcast um and\ncertainly not the hubman Lab podcast but\nor maybe it is but um or will be but\nyeah my understanding is is that you\nhave certain vs that mate with almost\nexclusively with one other V for their\nentire lifespan and then you have other\nvs located elsewhere um that in those\ncolonies they mate with lots of\ndifferent well so the males and females\nhave lots of different partners um rais\nyoung with lots of different partners\nmating with lots of different partners\nand that if you give Vasa presson then\nyou can make the I was want to call them\npolyamorous but I don't know if they\nlove each other I'm going to answer for\nmore and assume they love each other the\npolygamous moles not polyamorous but\npolygamous moles then become monogamous\nwell I yeah I would say that is probably\nnot the take-home message so the\ntake-home message would be they had\nlet's say that there was like the good\nvs right which are the Prairie VES and\nthey were the ones that formed these\nmonogamous parir bonds dad participates\nin paternal care with Mom they co- ra\nbabies together and then Dad chases off\nIntruders right and then there's the\nmore Ace social vs and so these are like\nthe Montaine VES um and um we'll we'll\nsee it's a complicated story but there's\nthese Montaine vs where um males and\nfemales live separately females like\nmaybe live on the male's territory the\nmale mes with a few different females\nabsolutely doesn't provide any paternal\ncare at all mom raises babies by herself\nright so that's these are really the\nlike 1950s versus 2020s yes yes to be to\nto broadly stereotype to broadly\nstereotype and if you give okay so for\nPrairie voles they're sort of primed to\nform bonds and to be the males to be\ngood daddies if you will and all you\nhave to do is give them a single\ninjection of vasopressin and you know or\nyou can give an antagonist and usually\nthe way they form the bond is through\nmating right so they you put them with a\nfemale they mate they cohabit for a bit\nthere's been all kinds of parametric\nstudies I I can't remember how many\nhours it takes to form a parabond um but\nthen you can do these things called\npartner preference tests and then you\ncan say here's the guy that you made it\nwith here's this guy you don't know and\nyou can do it for males you can do it\nfor females and they pick their partner\nthey choose to go hang out with their\npartner the Montaine BS you know either\nafter meting with somebody May either be\nequal or maybe they'll even go spend\ntime with the new individual so the\ncleanest story was that Prairie voles\nare monogamous Mont voles are not\nmonogamous but in the prairie vs you\ncould give vasor pressen instead of\nmated cohabitation and you could turn on\na like you know a bond with somebody\nafter only living with them for a very\nshort period of time right um or you\ncould induce paternal behavior and I was\nworking with a V species in grad school\nI think the most interesting scientific\nexperience that I've ever had right and\nyou and I both know this right when\nyou're young you're actually the person\ndoing the work right as you become you\nknow the head of your lab you're mostly\nwriting grants and giving talks right\nand then you get to hear about the super\ncool things that every in your lab is\ndoing right eventually the the members\nof your laboratory kick you out of the\nlab they literally say like get out of\nhere you're leaving things in the wrong\nplace whereas initially you're telling\nthem hey that's in the wrong place\nwithin a year or two for me I think it\ntook about four or five years but by\nabout year six right I was um demoted to\nmy office to just write grants and write\nPap I was told that one time I was back\nthere and I tried to waigh and I was\nlike so excited what they were working\non and they basically just said go write\ngrants and bring in more money right\nlike that was kind of their attitude\nlike we get to be the ones who get to do\nthe cool stuff so back when I got to\nactually do the science um I remember I\nhad this species where and I and again I\ntold you I came at this from an\nevolutionary perspective so these were\ncalled meadowes and I found them very\ninteresting so when I showed up in my\nthesis advisor lab she I said I really\nwant to study oxytocin and vasopressin\nand I really want to study VES and I\nknow you have a v species and she said\nwhy I don't have prairie vs I have these\nmeow voles and I'm studying them because\nthey're so sensitive to light and they\nchanged their behavior based on light\nand I she said well you can do what you\nwant but our grants basically have to\nhave a circadian component and so she\nsaid you got to work that in but then we\nkind of struck this deal so I was\nhanging out in the animal rooms and I\nthought it was really fascinating so she\nhad animals that were either on short\nday lengths or long day lengths so the\nmimicking some um summer and winter and\nI was noticing that on winter day\nlengths the the males were hanging out\nwith the females and when the female had\na litter he was like participating and I\nwas like whoa these are not supposed to\nbe monogamous animals and so I went into\nthe field research and they were doing\nall these radio telemetry studies and so\nlike if you I we should probably explain\nwhat those are putting a little\ntransmitter um under the skin it's\npainless for the animal but that allows\nthe researcher to um monitor the\nbehavior of the animal remotely without\nhaving to you know put them in cages and\nstuff so and so this is like under field\nconditions and vs are everybody's\nfavorite snack so they have like a very\nlimited lifespan in the wild I mean like\non the order of months and and so like\nif you have a short lifespan like you\nshould just keep reproducing right and\nso what was interesting is at the end of\nthe summer days as you're going into\nwinter territories collapse and males\nare found with females and they co- ra\nbabies it makes sense if it's you're\ngoing to have a litter and mom needs to\nget up to go eat you need somebody to\nsit there and warm those babies or\nthey're going to die because they're\ngoing to freeze to death right so I\nstarted saying like wow I think these\nmetales are good dats like I'm noticing\nthis and so I told my thesis adviser I\nwant to study how oxytocin invasor press\ncan maybe this is involved in tracking\nthese evolutionary mating strategies and\nso again like the coolest experience I\never had was on these males that were\nhoused under short day length so they\nwere like winter males um I was able to\nput Vaso pressent directly into their\nbrains and and it was like turning on a\nlight switch and they ran around the\ncage picked up all these babies put them\nin a nest and huddled over them and if\nyou put a placebo into their brain\nnothing happened and so to me I always\nfiled that away in you know in the back\nof my mind of like wow Vasa pressin is\nthis really interesting hormone um and\nmaybe someday I will I did a postto on\nsomething else but it was always you\nknow back in the back of my mind of I\nreally want to return to this it's so\nincredible that a eight amino acid long\npeptide could basically turn these um\nrelatively negligent fathers into very\nattentive fathers yes yeah it was\nfascinating right that I mean it just\nspeaks to the power of the peptide baso\npressent also speaks to the power of\nbrain circuitry it also speaks to the\nidea that brain circuitry is often\nsitting latent in the background you\nknow ready to be activated that it's not\njust about neuroplasticity and building\nup a new circuit that some forms of\nneuroplasticity are about unveiling\nwhat's what's already there and that\npeptides can act like switches um which\nyou know kind of makes sense on the one\nhand but um I've never heard of a result\nas dramatic as that so\num I'm presuming you're going to tell us\nthat that then LED you to go back to\nvasopress and explore its ability to\ninduce good parenting and negligent\nfathers I haven't studied that yet um no\nwell so I think that you know my mom\nalways says Chance favors the prepared\nmind and so I was doing my postto at\nStanford and I got recruited to stay on\nthe faculty and I you know had been\ndoing work in stress vulnerability and\nstress resilience and I really and I\nlove doing that work but I still felt\nthis tug of you know I had spent all\nthis time in a Psychiatry department\nwhere I was surrounded by clinicians and\nI realized that a lot of the stuff that\nI was doing had clinical relevance right\nand so sometimes you sort of meet the\nmoment right and so right as I was\ntransitioning to to have my own lab in\nmy department there was uh a bunch of\nstuff going on so there were a lot of\nvery dedicated parents who were lobbying\nfor funding for autism research because\nit was horrifically underfunded really\nhorrifically underfunded wow I mean at\nrates of one in 36 well not at the time\nright so it was it was 1 in 150 or\nwhatever it was back then but there were\nall these parents and and I I mean again\nthey're heroes in my eyes that they ad\nated so much for their loved ones and so\nthere was you know they started forming\nparent Grassroots organizations that\nhave culminated they all started joining\ntogether which is now Autism Speaks um\nand then there was a man named Jim\nSimons who runs um one of the most\nsuccessful hedge funds in the world and\nhe decided wow I'm gonna you know\nthere's let's put money into autism\nright and so does he have a personal\nlink to autism I you'd have to ask him\nbecause often times not always but often\ntimes when you hear about um wealthy\ndonors um devoting a lot of money to one\narea of science there's there's a\nfamilial thing there you know a member\nof their family or a close friend has\nthis Challenge and they they really want\nto see that challenge absolutely I mean\na lot of money I've gotten for my lab\nfrom philanthropist and what I will say\nis the most impactful work I've ever\ndone is through philanthropy right there\nare crazy ideas that no funding agency\never touches right um but yeah so they\nput they both put um a lot you know\nthere there was a lot of emphasis and so\nbecause the s's Foundation started\nissuing requests for applications there\nwas a group at Stanford that formed and\nit was um um a clinician with a basic\nscientist and my chair at the time said\nwell you know almost nothing is known\nabout the biological basis of autism why\ndon't you go I'm going to introduce you\nto the the the head of child psychiatry\nyou should go talk to this group and so\nas I Was preparing my slides and\nrealizing that you know social\ninteraction impairments were a core\nfeature of autism I thought wow you know\nthese neuropeptides May really be you\nknow um a part of this puzzle and so\nthat's actually really how I got pulled\ninto um autism research was was through\nthat and it was I I was you know\neverybody at the time was very\ninterested in oxytocin and you know I\nremember thinking so we actually did\nprobably the most definitive blood\noxytocin um study because there was this\nidea again like this marketing campaign\nof like the oxytocin deficit hypothesis\nof autism and you know given how\nclinically heterogeneous autism was we\ngot money actually from the Simons\nfoundation and we did the first study\nwith maybe 200 kids um and what we were\nable to show was that blood oxytocin was\nnot a marker of autism right so it\nwasn't like there was a bimodal\ndistribution meaning two completely\nnonoverlapping levels of oxytocin in\npeople with Autism people without autism\nso the lower your blood oxytocin levels\num actually regardless of who you were\nyou could be a child with autism you\ncould be an unaffected sibling with\nautism or you could be a unrelated\ncontrol child and it was the lower your\nblood oxytocin levels the greater your\nsort of social difficulties and the\nslopes you know were different they\nstarted at different points because the\nbehaviors were obviously different but\nthat's what got us thinking about our\nclinical trial which is that blood\noxytocin level is not going to be this\ngreat differentiator between people with\nand without autism right but we might be\nable to find a subgroup who could\nbenefit from treatment but what I like\nso much about your approach the way you\ndescribed it is that it it sets aside we\ndon't we don't want to say discards but\nit sets aside this thing that we call\nautism yeah which is already hard to\nDefine and diagnose and there's all\nthese different spectrums and you're\ntrying to F and just says okay children\nwith autism have challenges in social\ncognition social behavior social bonding\nyeah so do adults with autism for that\nmatter matter let's just focus on that\nyeah and not worry so much about whether\nor not somebody is diagnosed as Autistic\nor not and just focus on what are some\nof the potential neuropeptide deficits\nor overexpression of neuropeptides that\nmay in some way relate to those Social\nChallenges right and then one can Circle\nback to the question about autism in\ncollecting those data but it also points\nto this idea that like when we when we\ngo after a disease like Alzheimer we can\noften miss the possibility that\nAlzheimer's while it has you know\ndeficits in cognition and memory could\nalso be a bunch of other things like a\nmetabolic disorder of the body and so\nmaybe you go after a particular\nsymptomology yeah and try and attack\nthat and you might actually potentially\ntreat or cure multiple diseases it's a\nvery different approach and I I hope um\npeople are catching on to the the\nsubtlety but also the the the potential\nimpact of that um because if I heard\ncorrectly you said there are people who\nare not autistic who have social\nfunctioning deficits and they too have\nless circulating oxytocin right so I\nwould say we haven't studied people\nwhere we brought them in and\ncharacterized it right so these are\ntypically developing kids but what we\ndid is in the abilities that are typical\nof a controlled child we still saw that\ngradient right and so I think it just\nsort of begs the question about you know\nwhat is oxytocin's role in human\nsociality right I mean I think there's\njust so much that we don't understand\nabout both of these molecules um in\nterms of their disease liability if\nthey're low or their healing potential\nif we are you know able to use them as\nmodulators um of other\ntherapies so how did you move from\noxytocin to vasopressin um you mentioned\nthat everyone was was all excited about\noxytocin still the one that we hear the\nmost about yeah although after this\npodcast episode and when I start\nblabbing about vas oppress to everybody\num you know maybe that'll change but\nit's I think it's going to take a lot\nmore than that but um maybe it's because\nthe name isn't as there's something\nabout oxytocin that like kind of sounds\nlike the love looks like the love\nhormone but like vasopressin should be\nrenamed right well it should be called\nsomething else like not anti-erotic\nhormone not vasopressin I mean you're\ngoing to tell us how critically\nimportant it is perhaps even more\nimportant than oxytocin for autism and\nsocial functioning so I don't know by\nthe end of this podcast we'll we'll come\nup with a new name I it's needed right\nwell I'll put it out there um uh okay so\nhow did you get to vas oppressor okay so\nit was interesting with oxytocin because\nwe didn't you know and again I was\nskeptical that we would see these big\ngroup differences but you know it was a\nlittle bit of like okay you know what\neveryone's saying this is not going to\nbe the big solution right um and so I\nactually came at it from the work that\nwe did in monkeys and so I think I\nmentioned previously at the beginning of\nthe podcast that there were a lot of\nlimitations that I saw and then\nsometimes if you come into a field you\nknow when you're you're a little bit of\nan outsider right like I'm not a\nclinician I don't see autism patients\nbut I also I have this really strong\ninterest in social behavior and the\nbiology of it and so I I was thinking\nabout what are what are things that we\nneed to do to better address the\nchallenges in autism so one of them was\nwhy are we looking in blood right like\nif you look at neurological conditions\nthere's been a lot of progress made by\ndoing biomarker Discovery in cerebral\nspinal fluid right so like the the\nbiological substrates or or clues of\nmarkers of say um various forms of\nDementia or um or MS were for first\nfound in spinal fluid right because it's\nthe it's the fluid that bathes the brain\nin the spinal column and so if you're\nlooking for the bio chemistry of an\nillness that's the closest fluid that\nyou can get to the brain right so blood\ndraw just won't do it maybe right so\nthat was part of my thinking but then\nthere was the issue of the animal models\nright so there was drug after drug after\ndrug that was tested in mice and they\nfailed in human clinical trials and so\nit made me start thinking could we\ndevelop a primate model um of naturally\noccurring social impairments right so\ncan we because in autism these social\nimpairments are if you will naturally\noccurring right and so you know this is\nthese spontaneously occur in children um\nand so it made me wonder could we\nidentify monkeys in a large Colony that\nhave social\nimpairments in and after talking to to\nclinicians who who treat these children\ncan I spend a lot of time validating a\nmonkey model where there will be monkeys\nthat have features that look like they\nhave direct relevance to core autism\nsymptoms um and so what I did was\nthere's a um primate Center the\nCalifornia National Primate Research\nCenter and so what we did is so I think\nI mentioned earlier that there's these\nsurveys that can be used to look at\nautistic traits in the general human\npopulation right and so we refined one\nof these and we did what we call back\ntranslate so basically it's an\ninstrument that's used for humans and\nthen what we did is modified it to be\nable to to use this rating scale in\nreesus Max which are an old world monkey\nand I know you're familiar with them and\num and I was interested in looking at\nOld World monkeys because they're some\nof the closest relatives to human that\nare used in biomedical research and and\num as I mentioned previously these\nautistic traits are continuously\ndistributed across the general human\npopulation and that this\ngenetic uh say let's call it genetic\nliability which is a fancy way of just\nsaying that we think that there's a\nthere's a genetic risk that underlies\nthis Continuum of Behavioral traits\nright so if we think that that's true in\nhumans and in one of our closest\nrelatives and we think that some of\nthese genes create proteins that then\nare what sets up the developing brain to\ndevelop in the way that autistic brains\ndevelop so let's just assume that that's\nthe premise that's what we went with can\nwe find reesus maacs that are just\nliving in large outdoor colonies and\nidentify animals that might be good um\nmodels for autism and the answer is yes\nwe could do this all kinds of different\nways one is we could just take people\nand um score monkey behaviors outside\ntheir cages while they're interacting\nwith their peers we can use rating\nscales and again the rating scale we Ed\nit's called the social responsiveness\nscale so this is called the MAAC social\nresponsiveness scale revised it's a\nmouthful um but what it allows us to do\nis measure autistic like traits in\nmonkeys and we can also bring monkeys in\nfor experimental test to see where their\neyes look or how do they perform how do\nthey respond to videos of other monkeys\nyou know if they're making affiliate of\novertures do they um do like you know\nyou know ma goo which is a a positive\nresponse well they do that right I I um\nI'm going to apologize for interrupting\nyou again but I just have to tell people\nthis because I spent time up at the UC\nDavis primate Center as a graduate\nstudent and and by the way what we're\nreferring to here are non-invasive\nobservational studies at least thus far\nso these are monkeys living in large uh\nexclosures not enclosures large\nexclosures um forming colonies and\nsocial relationships and um you know I\nthink anyone that sees monkeys at the\nzoo and we all learn that monkeys go and\nthey don't if you want a monkey to like\nyou you learn this working with macx um\nfirst of all they don't the affiliative\ncall is\na they do this really nice and the\nlittle ones the babies I spend a lot of\ntime with these monkeys and the little\nones they do this thing where they go I\nused to I used to nurse the little ones\nevery once in a while they and they're\njust you know just like makes your heart\nmelt I think there must have been an\noxytocin dump at that moment that's\nprobably happening right now but if you\nwant the monkeys to like you you have to\ngive an affiliative facial gesture which\nis not a smile that's actually an\naggressive gesture so as Karen Dr Parker\njust showed you it's lip smacking which\nis so if you see a monkey at the zoo and\nyou want it to pay attention to you\nyou're going to have to lip smack and if\nit doesn't either you're not doing it\nright or it just doesn't like you\nexactly right great all right thanks now\nwe'll go back to the uh the study of uh\nor the establishment of this really key\nexperiment right so then what we did is\nwe identified these these animals and we\nspent a lot of time so one one of the\nthings that I do as one of my areas of\nexpertise is validating animal model so\na lot of like I mentioned like a lot of\nreason why experiments fail is people\nwill take an animal off the shelf and\nsay oh I'm going to do this right but if\nyou're you know if you're studying a\ndisorder that's characterized by visual\nissues is it is it the best thing to do\nin a nocturnal species that has old\nfaction as its primary sensory modality\nor you're referring to mice right or is\nit better you know and again I will say\nall models have value there's all you\nknow there's reasons you just have to\nyou know you basically have to stand by\nwhat you're modeling and so I think one\nof my the biggest issues I have with a\nsort of mouse phenotyping Mafia is that\nyou know there's this group of tests\nthat they use and they use it in every\nsingle disorder right and then if\nthere's a positive hit it's like oh this\nis like you know this test is really for\nParkinson's today but it's for\ndepression tomorrow right and so so my\ngoal was to to devise very specific\ntests that would allow us to evaluate\nyou know core features of autism in this\nmodel and the answer is we found it\nright so if you you look at monkeys that\nspend a lot of time alone they have a\nmuch greater burden of autistic like\ntraits measuring on this rating scale\nthey have diminished social motivations\nso other monkeys will come up and\ninteract with them but they don't engage\nin um social overtures them that much\nthemselves they do less grooming less uh\naffiliative um behaviors um they in some\nof the work that we're doing they don't\nlip smack back and we can talk a little\nbit about that we did a pharmacological\nprobe and we can talk a bit about what\nvasor press does to that which is kind\nof exciting um and so we spent a lot of\ntime validating this behavioral\nphenotype right to say that we really\nfeel like there are are core aspects of\nit that are allowing us to model autism\nright um and I have a paper which if you\nwant to put it in it's all about\ncreating this monkey model and and and\nthe power of of doing it and where it it\ntook us clinically we will provide a\nlink to that in the show note captions I\nalso just want to um throw up my vote\nfor the the fact that you did this work\nbecause again I I don't disparage Mouse\nmodel work but we've just seen over and\nover again that the incredibly small\nfraction of mouse models that lead to uh\nvalid Therapeutics in humans and that\nthere's just a lot of differences\nbetween um primate brains and rodent\nbrains and we have a very elaborate you\nknow frontal cortex a bunch of other\ncircuitry that might if they have the\nthat they probably use it for other\nthings and it's just very hard to com to\ndraw conclusions from those models and\nand they're they're great for probing um\nfunctions that are uh let's just call\nthem more autonomic type functions um\nand for doing some of the initial\ninvestigations but um you know I think\nwhile I don't want to see every research\nlab switch over to primates you know I\nthink one has to be really thoughtful\nabout the kinds of experiments one does\nwith primates at all yeah um this sort\nof um behavioral assessment and and the\nidentification of a of a primate model\nfor autism seems like a a very good use\nof of um of Human Resources right well\nand the other thing I will say is that\nthere were medications that were only\ntested in rodents that when they were\nwhen they were tested in people had\nreally negative consequences I can give\nyou two examples so one is the lamide\nwhich was a morning sickness medication\nthat was given to women um that were\npregnant um and the safety testing and\ntalks was toxicity testing was done only\nin mice I didn't know that yes and\nthat's why it went on the market it went\non the market in Europe um and there\nwere all these children born with\nprofound lib limb abnormalities when\nthey went back and tested the drug in um\nmarma sets neither rees's monkeys or\ncinus monkeys an old world monkey they\nhad the limb abnormalities and so all\nthey had to do and again you know I I as\nan animal lover treat the you know the\nlife of a single monkey or or a single\nMouse for that matter an individual\nmonkey excuse me or individual Mouse for\nthat matter as you know as critical I am\na species I do think there's a\ndifference between their life and our\nlives when it comes to um you know what\nstudy one does but um but just the idea\nthat these severe developmental defects\nin humans could have been avoided by\ndoing an experiment perhaps even on one\nright maret right um and again I feel\nfor the life of discomfort of that maret\nbut um the idea that that could have\nsaved so many human lives it's just\nstriking well and there was also that\nstreet drug MP TP that was a synthetic\nheroin right that caused like overnight\nparkinsonian ISM right when like I think\nthe dopamine cells were just oblad right\nbut when you went and looked in mice\nmptp didn't have those effects it was\nonly in primates and other or humans and\nother primates right so and I agree with\nyou I am an animal lover I I think that\nwe have to be very careful whenever we\ndo any animal experiments right and so\nyou really need to have a good\njustification I think for any science\nthat's done I will say that upfront um\nand you know we have this you know new\ngeneration of stem cell and organoid\nwork which I think is going to you know\nallow us to make all kinds of disease\nprogress right so without having to\nstudy uh whole animal models or in in\ncomplimentary right but I mean I think\nagain I think we need to pick the model\nbased on the question we're asking right\nand so if you want to have a medication\nthat's safe and well tolerated you know\nin people um were effective and you want\nto move the needle on Lex social\ncognition you want to be testing it in a\nspecies that also has complex social\ncognition look the Netflix show chimp\nEmpire people haven't seen it they\nshould watch it when you watch it you\nrealize they're very much like us yeah\nand dare I say we're very much like them\noh yeah it's uh Far and Away different\nthan watching a bunch of mice yes and\nI'm not being disparaging of mice I'm\nassuming they have that mice also have\ncomplex social cognition VES also have\ncomplex social cognition but it's of the\nmouse V type and we don't know really\neven what to look for right but with\nprimates there's you know affiliative\ngaze there's you know affiliative\ngrooming there's um ostracization of\nindividuals in a troop I mean there's a\nthere's a you know baning taking care of\nother babies there's all sorts of\ninteresting dynamics that map so clearly\nonto human behavior and vice versa yeah\nyeah so you establish this Colony up at\nDavis um at the regional primate Center\nthat and where you identified some\nmonkeys that we don't if they have\nautism but you could see that they were\nless socially affiliative right and I\nwould never say they have autism like I\nwill say that up front you know they\nhave features that resemble human autism\nand that allow us to model this right so\nso we started studying those animals and\nwhat we wanted to do was do some\nbiomarker Discovery so what we wanted to\nask was are there any molecules that\nallow us to differentiate these what\nwe'll call them naturally low social or\nlow social monkeys from soci socially\ncompetent high social monkeys and so we\nmeasured a bunch of different um\nreadouts of neurotransmitter systems\nthat were either involved in Maman\nsocial behavior had been implicated in\nidiopathic meaning autism that doesn't\nhave a genetic cause or these\nneurogenetic syndromes that we've been\ntalking about um where there's Pathways\nthat are really associated with them and\nso if we measured a bunch of these\nsystems with 93% accuracy without even\nknowing what the monkey who the monkey\nwas if they were low or high social we\ncould just put them in the low social or\nhigh social bucket and was this by blood\ndraw or cerebral spinal this was it was\neverything we did Blood we did CSF and\nwe put all these measures into the\nhopper we did a discriminate statistical\nanalysis which was like a machine\nlearning algorithm where we just said\nhere's all this information help me\nclassify if this individual is high or\nlow social for cerebral spinal fluid is\ncollected by spinal tap correct in my\nunderstanding I've never had one um but\nthat spinal tap is of course more\ninvasive than a blood draw but it still\nis um done as an outpatient thing in\nhumans like you can go in get a needle\ninserted into the lower spine by by an\nexpert um they're going to draw cerebral\nspinal fluid I mean not that much more\ninvasive and timec consuming than\ngetting a a needle into your vein for a\nblood draw right I mean it's it's we\nthink of it as it's technically a little\nbit more challenging um but their CSF\ndraw humans all the time right so in\ntheory this could map to a human study\nand it did which we'll talk about cool\nso we went out and we did this I have\nthis spectacular statistician who's we\nwe spend a lot of time together his name\nis Joe Garner and um and he is a\nstatistical genius and so he developed\nthis and and we do all of our work\ntogether or you know I would say 95% of\nit we just love working together and he\ndeveloped a statistical winning winwing\nstrategy to identify what were the key\ndrivers and what was fascinating is in\nthis first monkey cohort it was the\ncerebral spinal fluid levels of\nvasopressin that were really what was\ndriving this classification right so if\nwe just knew your levels of your of\nvasor pressent in spinal fluid but not\nin blood interestingly um we could\npretty closely perfect to perfect\nclassify you as high or low social and\nso then we replicated that again in\nanother monkey cohort because obviously\nit's a scientists you always want to\nreplicate your work and then if it was\nreally a biomarker meaning it's a\nmolecule in the body that gives us um an\nindication of something and in this case\nit's an indication of your Social\nfunctioning we were able to look at um\nmonkeys and we saw that the Vasa\npressent was consistent across\nmeasurement time so there was a wide\nvariety of Vasa pressin levels but\nwithin an individual monkey it was\npretty much the same right so that's\nwhat you want to see with the biomarker\nand then we showed that the vasor\npressen levels were closely uh linked to\nuh groom SP grooming uh time spending\ngrooming and as we mentioned I think we\nmentioned earlier grooming is in many\nmonkey species a critical behavior that\nsolidifies social bonds and maintains\nthem and so the individuals with the\nlowest CSF phasor pressent levels had uh\nspent the less time the least amount of\ntime in in grooming grooming other\nmonkeys other monkeys yeah this\nallopathic grooming is a very\ninteresting behavior and um from\nwatching chimp Empire I can tell you\nthat um new relationships are\nestablished in many ways by um monkeys\nthese chimps chimpanzees sort of\noffering their back for grooming and if\nanother um chimp elects to yes groom\nthat um chimp then it establishes some\nform of trust and it and it all seems to\nhave to do with proximity like how close\nare you going to let me get to you vice\nversa in humans that you know we talk\nabout personal space and there's a whole\nset of things related to consent in this\nwhole allopathic grooming thing and then\nif they um you know if a if a chimp\nmisbehaves on on an outing then they\naren't groomed by others and they can\nactually get parasitic infections and it\ncan be very costly uh it's very\ninteresting you know uh to just think of\nalpath grooming as a as not a um kind of\na primitive of language but a whole\nlanguage into itself absolutely yeah and\nand also just critical for the species\nso that was really interesting to me\nthat we were seeing these hints that\nvasor pressin could be you know really\nimportant but of course you know\nsomebody will say and I will say upfront\nmonkeys don't have autism right so then\nthe question becomes does this have\nwhat's called translational value so you\nknow can I see this observation in an an\nanimal model and will it provide\nfundamental insights into humans right\nand so I wanted to get cerebral spinal\nfluid from people um to test this\nhypothesis because we had in parallel\ndone a study looking at blood vas\noppress levels and people within without\nautism and we didn't see a group\ndifference there unlike this really\nprofound difference that we saw when we\nlooked at spinal fluid and the monkey\nand again I think I mentioned the blood\nvasor press levels were\nindistinguishable if you were higher low\nsocial monkeys so there was something\nabout looking more proximate to the\nbrain that was giving us more\ninformation than say the blood alone and\nso I said I wanted to get spinal fluid\nand like you said people do this all the\ntime how would we um but we're you know\nit's not going to be a first pass\nespecially when we don't really have any\nevidence in people to go in for what we\nwould call a research lumbar puncture\nright and so I had to get really\ncreative about how do I get spinal fluid\nfrom children and what we did was we\npiggybacked on to a clinical indication\nfor um a spinal fluid draw so and and we\ndid this so I tried to get funding for\nthis this is like you know again I mean\nI think this is important for people to\nknow how science is done right and so I\nwrote all these Grant applications\nnobody would fund it they said that this\nis really interesting it's too high risk\nyou won't be able to pull it off and you\nknow I don't usually back down from a\nchallenge like if I think think\nsomething's a good idea and I want to do\nit I'm going to find a way to do it if\nsomebody if it's impossible that's one\nthing but if it's hard to do it doesn't\nmean you shouldn't do it you just have\nto figure out how to do it and so I\nalways try to see Bridges where other\npeople see barriers right and so it's\nlike well how can I access spinal fluid\nand so I went around talking to all my\nfriends who were on and Stanford's\nreally wonderful because it's such a\nsmall school right and so you're on all\nthese different committees with all\nthese different people and so lot of\ncommittees lots of I can attest lot of\nComm exactly but it's really because\nyou're on them with people from all\ndifferent departments I know people in\ndepartments that I wouldn't otherwise\nknow um and you get very uh you get to\nknow these people well in these many\ncommittees and where we live it's a\nsmall community right so like maybe were\nthe experiment Karen maybe there's a I\nalways wonder whether or not there's a\nlarger experiment right not on monkeys\nnot on the the patients or the Clone but\nlike we're maybe we're the experiment\nright and they're looking at how we\ninteract on committees anyway please\ncontinue so I started going up to people\nthat I knew and said hey if you're\nyou're taking spinal fluid can I get a\nlittle bit of extra right and of course\nwe got you know IRB approval meaning we\nhad ethics approval and all this and um\nor you could get the remnant sample and\nobviously again get consent from the\nfamilies so we could either get a little\nbit extra when it was being drawn for a\nresearch indication so so they were\ngetting a spinal tap no matter what and\nthen we were just either we're getting a\nlittle bit extra or we were going to\ngetting the remnant that they were going\nto throw out right so you usually take\nmore than you need because you don't\nwant to have to do another spinal tap\nright and so we were able to go around\nand I hustled around and got all these\npeople involved to help me we put um hot\npink stickers on the lumbar puncture\ntrays so that in the emergency room so\nif somebody was doing a spinal tap they\nwould call us so we knew about it and we\ncould get you know samples um again\nunder people's consent um so we got all\nthese people involved and we finally got\nsamples from children with autism and\nchildren without autism and then we also\nmade sure that whatever they were being\nworked up for was negative right so we\ngot the the sort of healthiest people we\ncould given that everybody was coming in\nfor a medical reason to have a lumbar\npuncture and in this in this first study\nwe had seven children with autism seven\nchildren without autism and we could\nnearly perfectly classify 13 out of 14\nindividuals by just knowing their CSF\nvasor pressent level Alone um which is\npretty remarkable given that there isn't\na biological indicator that we a robust\nbiological IND Ator that we know so\nbasically in this relatively small\ncohort yeah having low vasopress is the\nbiomarker of autism correct and and\nagain and what I will say is in our\nmonkey studies and in our human studies\nCSF oxytocin level became our control\nright so in our monkeys there were no\ndifference in CSF oxytocin by group um\nand then in this first study um there\nwere no differences in CSF oxytocin\nlevels um uh a sample size of 14 is\nintriguing but given autism so\nclinically heterogeneous we want to\nreplicate it and so I knew that there\nwas um a professor at the NIH named um\nSue swedo who was collecting uh cerebral\nspinal fluid in as part of a research\nstudy because she was interested in\nimmune parameters and fate deficiency so\nshe had children that were medically\nhealthy and they were getting you know\njust like at ni you get these huge\nworkups right so they were very\nwell-characterized participants so we\nwere able to look at and again we also\nthis is the first time we were able to\nlook at girls so we had a small sample\nof girls and we had boys and we\nbasically just asked the question can we\nreplicate this and I was very interested\nin well will oxytocin be what's\ndifferent in the girls right so maybe\nthere will be some sex specificity here\nand that we'll see low CSF vasor pressin\nin the males and low CSF oxytocin girls\nthat was not the case what we found was\nthat if in the individuals with autism\nregardless of their um biological sex um\nthat they all had lower CSF phasor\npresson levels than the individuals\nwithout autism and because they were so\nwell characterized we were also able to\nshow on a gold standard research\ndiagnostic assessment of autism so it's\na an assessment that's used um uh to in\na research situation to validate an\nAutism diagnosis by an expert clinical\nopinion that the lower your vasopress\nlevels in spinal fluid the greater your\num social symptom severity um your\nclinical symptom severity and then we\nasked it's like well vasor press's\ninvolved in social behavior but it's not\nreally that involved in restricted\nrepetitive behaviors and that was\nactually the case so it was the CSF Vasa\npress and track the social symptom\nseverity not the repetitive symptom\nseverity suggesting that there might be\nother biological measures that could be\nincluded as a way to you know have a\nmore powerful way to differentiate\npeople with and without autism um and so\nthen I was really so so that was really\nexciting to replicate that um and then I\nhad a colleague named um John\nConstantino who um is now at Emery but\nhe used to be at wasio and I knew that\nJohn I had been at a meeting in I think\nit was 2010 and I found out that he had\nwhat I will call Liquid Gold so he had\nthis uh minus 80 uh C freezer um that\nwas uh had a bunch of um neonatal infant\nCSF samples that he had from Human\ninfants and he had collected them and\nagain this was under ethical approvals\nand it was basically they these infants\ncame in for something that needed to be\nworked up that was very rare um but if\nthey had it they would you know they\nthey could die so they needed to get a\nmedical treatment for it but the the\nvast majority of these children ended up\nbeing healthy so it was a pretty healthy\nsample if you will right and so I knew\nhe had all these samples and I said to\nhim wouldn't it be really interesting if\nwe teamed up and we look at this uh CSF\nvaser press finding in children before\nthe period when behavioral symptoms\nfirst manifest right and so so sorry\nagain to I'm going to apologize every\ntime no no no I just but I think it's\nimportant because this was a question\nthat um I was thinking about earlier and\nI imagine many other people were too you\nknow you find these monkeys that have\nsocial uh interaction deficits you find\num kids that have social interaction\ndeficits and you see that there's low\nvasopress in both groups this extends to\nmale and female children but then of\ncourse the question becomes well maybe\nthey have low vas oppress because of so\nmany years or even months of social\ninteraction deficits right that the the\ndirection of causality isn't clear and\nso yeah when you said Liquid Gold you\nknow referring to the um CSF from these\ninfants um taken prior to any\nopportunity for social interaction\nBeyond just you know whatever\ninteraction they had with their their\nmother up until the point the the CSF\ndraw was taken um this really gets at\nthe issue of causality right so it's a\nquasi perspective you know because it\nwas banked and then a lot of time went\nby right and so what we realized we\ncould do was and this was a heroic\nundertaking on John's part so these were\num this was these samples were collected\nback on paper medical records so he had\nto trace 2,000 paper paper what's that\nyeah exactly so he had to trace 2,000 I\nthink paper medical records to an\nelectronic medical record and then what\nwe did is we he looked to see who went\non to develop autism and who didn't\nright so then what we had with spinal\nfluid samples that have sort of been\nwaiting in the freezer if you will and\nthen we could ask you know do\nindividuals who later receive an Autism\ndiagnosis many months or even years\nlater already have low vasopress levels\nas infants and the reason why this was a\ncompelling question to ask is there's\nevidence to suggest that behavioral\ntherapies are more effective the younger\nthe child is right and if you think\nabout it if if behavioral\ncharacteristics of autism emerge across\ndevelopment you know what if and this\nwas my this is sort of my we haven't we\nhaven't substantiated this yet but this\nis like sort of my big question what if\nall these autism susceptibility genes\nsummon interact and converge upon a few\ncommon Pathways in the brain right and\nso for years people have talked about\nthis excitatory inhibitory balance\ntheory of autism but what if vas oppress\nis one of those Pathways because it's so\ncritically involved in Social\nfunctioning and so what I was interested\nin and so let let's just say for a\nmoment you know your genes are set at\nBirth what if the Vaso prestent is\nalready low in the brains of these\ninfants and so it puts them on this very\ndifferent trajectory where you have this\ncumulative effect of they're maybe a\nlittle bit less socially interested and\nmaybe they're not making the eye contact\nand if there was a way to intervene\nreally early even potentially with a\nvasopress and replacement therapy that\nyou might be able to put them on a\ndifferent developmental trajectory so\nthat was my big what if question\nand what was really remarkable was so I\nhad been asking John hey can I have your\nspinal fluid samples and and he finally\nagreed after he saw a couple of those\npapers understandably he wanted to make\nsure that we already had shown something\nin people and animals that were sort of\nif you will symptomatic with social\nimpairment and what we found was yes\nthis was the case so it was a small\nsample it needs to be replicated but\nindividual so infants that went on to\nhave an Autism diagnosis later in life\nalready had low CSF vasor pressent level\noxytocin levels did not differ between\ninfants that received a subsequent\nautism diagnosis and those that didn't\nso suggesting that we have a\nbiomarker that you know might really be\na good readout for you know clinical\nreferral or risk management monitoring\nincredible so you're telling us that\nlevels of\nvasopressin correlate with social\ncognition deficits that right I think\nthat warrants a brief discussion about\ncerebral spinal fluid I teach neuro\nAnatomy to medical students so um\nforgive me for for having to ask this\nbut you know I think of cerebral spinal\nfluid as the stuff that exists in the\nventricles and down the central Canal\nthe spinal cord and provides essential\nnutrients and uh for neurons and other\ncell types in the\nbrain but it's also a reservoir for\nchemicals coming from the brain which is\nwhy the spinal tap is useful right um\nbut\nin the context of a cerebral spinal tap\nand you're measuring CSF and you're\nseeing okay lower levels of vas oppress\nin these individuals with these\nchallenges with social deficits does\nthat mean that they're making less\nvasopressin does it mean I mean it could\nhave gone the other way too like they're\ndumping too much vasopressin into the\nCSF and it's not able to function in the\nbrain\nlike you know what do we know about CSF\nand what does it mean right well I mean\nit's a great question so I I think this\nis just the tip of the iceberg right so\nI think of the CSF as as sort of like\nthe kitchen sink of the brain right and\nwhat we need is real specificity and so\nI mean my working hypothesis and we'll\ntalk a little bit about pharmacology is\nthat there's a deficiency in um in vasor\nprodu vasor pressent production in\nindividuals with autism but there's a\nlot of elegant experiments that need to\nbe done to be able to answer this\nquestion so we have funding ly to look\nin um postmortem human brain tissue um\nto look at um in both blood CSF and\nhypothalamic tissue where vasopress is\nmade to look at inner relationships\nright which is very difficult to do but\nalso to see if there's a fewer number of\nVaso pressent producing cells and if\nVaso pressent gene expression is\ndiminished right because that would help\nus begin to answer is this a production\nissue right so if you think back to the\nPrairie V\nthey're sort of primed to be parental\nright um or in in my case the mees right\nbut you can do this in any V species\nwell at least the two that I'm thinking\nof and you put baso pressent into the\nbrain and then all of a sudden it it\nunlocks this Behavior right so is it\npossible that children with autism or at\nleast a subset of them um all you have\nto do is replace vasopress and that\nthere might be a subset of these kids\nminimally that could benefit from vasor\npresson replacement if you will\nis there any evidence for excessive\nurination in kids with autism which if\nanyone's going what what why is he\nasking that if you recall vas supressant\nis also anti-diuretic hormone um I\nsuppose the other question is could you\nhas anyone looked at levels of a oppress\nin the urine of autistic kids versus\nnon-autistic kids because it's acting\nperipherally and um you said blood draws\ndon't reveal any differences um in\ncirculating blood we know that you're\nurine is filtered blood fair enough but\num seems at least worth worth a looky\nokay so I have this awesome medical\nstudent in my lab named Lauren Clark and\nwe with um three different Physicians\nfrom different backgrounds so um wrote a\nperspective piece that's currently under\nreview and it actually asked this\nquestion so you know given all these\nweird medical naming conventions it's\npossible that this information is\nexisting in information silos in\ndifferent disciplines right so it raises\nthis idea of if you have low vasopressin\nso there's a if you really don't have\nyou're not making vasopress you have a\ndisorder called Central diabetes\ninsipidus right which is characterized\nby excessive thirst um um lots of\nurination um and and you know bed\nwedding potentially um and so what we\nwanted to do was ask has this been\nmissed right so shouldn't there be a\nsubset of kids with autism where we\nmight might be able to look at these\nother physiological features and say\nyeah this is the subset we want to be\ngiving vasor pressent to and so she\nwrote this perspective where we did a\nlittle bit of a review and the answerers\nthere's some\nintriguing um studies that we reviewed\nin this paper where it looks like and\nand what's funny is when you read the\ndiscussion section it'll be like wow\nthere's all these kids with autism that\nare drinking lots of water and we don't\nknow why or wow there's a lot of bed\nwedding but it's not tied to\nintellectual disability where you might\nsee a lot of bed wedding or something so\nall of these studies kind of raise this\npoint of like wow this is really\ninteresting um and there's been no big\nepidemiological study done on this and\ncertainly not any study where people who\ncome at it from brain science and then\nthe the practitioners who are like an\nendocrinologist for instance which which\nis where some of these people could show\nup um are are really connecting the dots\nso I think that remains to be determined\nbut we are actually about to launch a\nstudy to to investigate this right I was\nmeeting with Lauren yesterday about it\nso um it's a really good question and I\nhope to have information on it in the\nnot to distant future as I recall\nalcohol is an antagonist of vasopressin\nso Al there's a lot of different drugs\nthat could interact with vasor pressent\nand so one thing I'm interested in is\nare there any drugs that release vasor\npressent as a side effect and could some\nof them be mobilized to treat autism we\nalso know that like um acupuncture can\nrelease phaser and there's been some\nstudies done in Rats on that um and so\none question would just be are there any\nalternative therapies where we can be\nrelacing vasor pressent naturally or do\nwe need to you know do a replacement\nstudy where we give you know intranasal\nvaser press into children with autism\nright and of course I'm I'm not I want\nto say I'm not advocating that people go\nout and do this on their own right like\nI'm I I'm a big proponent of randomized\nclinical trials where you assess safety\nright and efficacy yes science science\nmedicine right but I appreciate you\nsaying that yeah um some years ago so\nthis would be\nmid90s um there was a small but very\nactive subculture that I was not a part\nof okay I swear um that were combining\nGHB gah hydroxy butyrate um and\nvasopressin as um combination quote\nunquote sex drugs really yes yeah um and\nI don't know the rationale for including\nBas oppress was in any case whether or\nnot that's by way of enhancing social\nbonding or a direct effect on sexual\narousal itself is still unclear but in\nany event since we're talking about Bas\noppressing maybe you should tell us\nabout the actual science of uh\nvasopressin sorry maybe I should allow\nyou to tell us about the actual\nscientific study of vasopressin um in\nother words what happens if you give\npeople Vasa press in a controlled\nenvironment not the sort of environment\nI'm talking about but a controll and the\none thing I will say because I have\npeople contact us all the time saying\nwhere can I get vasor pressent and what\nI would say is vasor pressen means you\nknow you're having effects on blood\npressure you're having effects on really\nimportant right vasod right and vas the\ndosing has to be appropriate you know\nyou don't want people just going and\ntrying this because there could be\nreally severe adverse effects right so\nthat's why we've been studying this in a\nin a controll clinical trial right so um\nI teamed up with Antonio Harden who's\nthe child psychiatrist that um I've been\nworking with for years and we did the\nfirst sort of first inclass vas oppress\ntreatment trial in children with autism\nso again this was everyone was unaware\nof who was on basor press whether it was\nthe family or the clinician who was\ndoing the evaluation um and then it was\nrandomized Placebo controlled um and\nthen we basically gave um vasor presson\nagain twice a day for four weeks um to\nchildren they were about 6 to 12 years\nof age and then we had a primary outcome\nmeasure which was the social\nresponsiveness scale we could get into\ndiscussions about what a primary outcome\nmeasure should be you know wouldn't it\nbe great if there was a biological\nmeasure um but this is sort of what had\nbeen used in the past and something that\nthe FDA approved us using I was partly\ninterested in using the SRS because we\nhad used it in monkeys right and we had\nshown at least in monkeys we've never\nlooked at this in people because of you\nknow the lack of available samples but\nthat monkeys in this general population\nthat we've looked at there's a\ncontinuous distribution of these SRS\nscores that relate to the CSF vasor\npress levels and so what was I wanted to\nknow if we use the SRS as an outcome\nmeasure and we're administering vasor\npresson can we change you know the\nscoring on this instrument based on our\nanimal data so SRS is social social\nresponsiveness scale corre um without\ngoing into a lot of detail because we\ncan always refer people to the paper and\nI think most people just want to\nunderstand the top Contour um the SRS\npresumably has to do with um how often\nthe kid uh interacts with another kid\nhow often they initiate that interaction\nversus on the receiving end things like\naffiliative play um how often they look\nat one another versus averting gaze um\nthese kinds of things yeah and then\nthere's also um a little bit about\nrestrictive repetitive behaviors so even\nthough it's called the social\nresponsiveness scale there's also an\nassessment of other features of autism\nin it but you can sort of think about it\nas a quantitative way to assess features\nof interest in autism and this was\nrelated to our biology and the monkeys\nand so then we use this as this outcome\nmeasure um in our trial and and you know\nas a as an experimentalist I have this\nsort of trust but verify right so you\nwant to you want to see the same thing\nover and over and over again right like\nscientists like repetition and so we had\nParents fill out um their impressions of\nwhat the child's uh Behavior was you\nknow before and after being on the\nmedication we also had a clinician make\nan evaluation but we also had the kids\nperform laboratory based tests where\nthey would see like I mentioned that the\num reading the mind in the eyes test or\nwe would show them a picture of a a face\nand say what emotion is this and so we\nwere able to have what's called um\nconverg in validity right so it's a\nfancy scientific term to say do all\nthese measures that we think should be\nrelated are they related and are we\nseeing the same thing and um the answer\nwas yes so that when we gave children\nwith um autism vasopressin versus kids\nwith autism of placebo the kids who were\ntreated with vasopressin showed um\nincreases in Social abilities on parent\nreport clinician evaluation and child\nperformance on laboratory based tests\nwow um was that um was that immediate\nlike they they did the nasal spray and\nthey immediately started um receiving\nand and initiating more social\nengagement or was this a buildup over\ntime and what I'm getting at here is\nwhether or not this is the reflection of\na short or longer term neuroplasticity\nlike where there structural changes in\nthe brain or or is this something that\nwas more acute um we don't know the\nanswer to that so we basically looked at\ndosing with the idea that we would you\nknow and and again I think we've\nmentioned this about um limitations on\nlike there's so many things that a\nscientist would like to do but you\nalways limited by a budget right and so\nwhen we started this work again it was\nlike philanthropic shoestring budgets\nright and so you had to really be laser\nfocused on what are the things that we\ncan do on the budget at hand so\nunfortunately we didn't do like EEG or\nbrain Imaging or other things that would\nbe I think potentially very interesting\nto do because you might be able to see\nan early signature of response right so\nmaybe after the first dose let's say wow\nlike there's some interesting changes\nthat are predictive of somebody who\nwould be a resp responder to the\nmedication and we don't know that yet um\nbut we do know after this 4-week period\nthat we we saw you know these changes\nand in then in a subset of kids we\nactually saw diminished anxiety and also\ndiminished restricted repetitive\nbehaviors um so suggesting that the\nvasor pressent effect may not only be on\num social behavior have you ever just\nwanted to try or tried vas oppress you\nknow I haven't but you're in a\nPsychiatry Department after all and I\nnot suggesting that members of the\nPsychiatry Department are constantly\ntesting the drugs that they use on their\npatients with themselves but but I've\nhad several members of this department\nof which I'm a courtesy member um member\nby courtesy any event and we'll see if\nI'm still am after what I'm about to say\nuh Dr Carl dth who's a clinician our\nfirst guest on the huberman Lab podcast\nalso a phenomenal neurobiology\nresearcher uh David Spiegel um Rob\nmalenka um\nand others um that I've spoken to you\nknow I think all of whom said you know\nthat they felt as clinicians Rob's not a\nclinician but anymore right but as a\nclinician that they felt almost a\nresponsibility to understand the effects\nand side effect profiles of the drugs\nthat they were giving their patients\nwhich I saw not as Renegade or\nexperimental but rather as very\ncompassionate like seeking empathy um so\nI'm curious have you ever just snuck a\nlittle little no no I never have but\nthere is a long history Medicine of\npeople trying out they believe so much\nin their solution that they go and\nvaccinate their family with the new\nvaccine that they've created or they try\nthe medication themselves right so MDMA\nwas developed by Sasha kogan in a\nlaboratory in the East Bay first by a\npharmaceutical company in the early\n1900s but then kind of disappeared it\ndid disappear and then it was\nresurrected independently in the in the\n19 I think 70s and 80s and then now it's\none of the um sort of hot topics items\nfor the treatment of PTSD still in late\nphase clinical trials still illegal but\num self-experimentation is is one of the\ncentral themes of Psychiatry frankly\nyeah I mean I guess I you know it's I\nPro I got in trouble in class for being\ntoo social right so so I guess I've\nnever it might send you over the other\nspot yeah yeah exactly who knows but no\nI I never no and the thing is is that\nthese oxytocin Vasa pressin and again\nthese are done and this is this is\nsomething that I think we've hit on over\nand over again in the podcast is you\nneed to know who's you're studying right\nwhat's the species who's the individual\nyou know most of these have been done in\nyou know neuro I mean a lot of the\noxytocin and a little bit of the\nvasopress work the single dose work was\nmostly done in in what we'll call\nneurotypical people right just asking\ncan we move around social behavior by\njust giving this single Drug\nAdministration most people that are\nneurotypical didn't say that they could\ntell if they were on the drug or the\nplacebo right so interesting so I think\nthe question really becomes you know\ndrugs have different you know they work\ndifferently based on the individual\nwho's taking them so if you have a\nneurotypical individual and you give\nthem Vaso presson you know maybe they'll\nself-report that they don't see a\ndifference but if you had somebody who\nisn't producing enough phas of presson\nmaybe you know they would self-report\nafter a period of time or maybe even\nafter the first dose wow I really see\nsomething different right did any of the\nkids uh report how they felt they just\nsaid like wow I I like playing with\nother kids more were they self-aware in\nthat way and um also feel free to\nmention if it feels right to you any um\nlet's let's consider two outlier cases\none spectacular result if that you know\na kid that went from very socially\nisolated to you know maybe very\ngregarious and um but let's also balance\nthat with another outlier the the kid\nwith low Vasa presson who took Vasa\npresson who for whom there was no\nsignificant shift I'm presum that the\ndata set you probably obser something\nlike each of those yeah so I mean what\nI'll say is that um so yeah I mean there\nwere definitely kids who didn't respond\nto the medication I mean one thing I\nthink it's important to say and again\nthis was a small pilot trial right we're\nin the process of replicating this in a\nmuch larger sample so you know as a\nscientist again you want to say okay\nthis is really intriguing and\ninteresting and I've invested a lot in\nyou know this monkey model and then\ndoing all the CSF work in patients to\nsuggests that there may be a there there\nhere but I want to see it replicate um\nwe did have an article um that Stanford\nmedicine I can send you the link um they\nthey were able to I think interview a\nfamily that had been in the trial um and\nso obviously there's patient privacy and\nyou know you have to they have to say\nit's okay to talk about it but this is a\nfamily that was contacted I think they\nwere Anonymous but this is in this\nreport um and they basically said the\nthe dad said that his son was walking\naround the he was on Vasa presson and\nhis son was walking around a grocery\nstore and he like was looking for him\nand he turned around and he said he was\nGob smacked because his child was you\nknow just talking to making chitchat\nwith somebody like in an aisle and he\nsaid he had never seen that happen\nbefore um and so you know we do have\nanecdotal reports like that and I think\nyou know the tricky part is are we we\ndidn't stratify anyone going into this\ntrial right and so the concern always is\ndid we get really lucky in the first\ntrial and we somehow got the the quote\nunquote right people that entered the\ntrial that we're going to be the ones\nwho would respond to the medication or\nis this a medication that has sort of\nbroad use in this population and we you\nknow the second trial will be um\npositive you used nasal spray to deliver\nthe vasopress and and um presumably that\ngets into the blood circulation of the\nbrain um and supplies neurons with\nvasopressin but it's very non-specific\nand I'm not criticizing but if you think\nabout you just putting a bunch of\nvasopressin into the brain and if people\nwonder why this is that it's because\nbasically you have neurons of your\ncentral nervous system um are part of\nyour factory system and believe it or\nnot right behind your where your nose\nmeets your forehead um the brain is\nright there there's a little bit of bone\nand then the brain is is is right there\nso um one of the reasons you can get in\nthere um and it's easier than an ocular\ninjection or something that wouldn't be\na good approach and it's easier than a\nperipheral in injection into the vein\nbut at the same time I have to presume\nthat this I'm imagining this V supress\njust kind of like preting through the\nbrain binding to whatever receptors\nhappen to be there you said The\nreceptors are\neverywhere and then this significant\nImprovement in social cognition right so\nthat raises all sorts of interesting\nquestions about like what are what\nrelevant circuits are impacted um or is\nit some Global Inc could it be some\nglobal increase in kind of awareness of\nsurroundings um although some autistic\nkids are overwhelmed by their awareness\nof surroundings so um yeah what are some\nthoughts about how vasopress might be\nworking to exert this this really\nimpressive and frankly important effect\nright so I mean could it increase social\nmotivation does it you know like so\nlet's talk about like how sort of\ncomplexity of social um sensory\nprocessing is it that were directing\nattention to social cues where there\nwouldn't have necessarily been as much\niess right um are we increasing social\nmotivation which would suggest from some\nof the animal studies may actually be\nhappening right um we don't know and I\nthink that's partly when you have other\nmodels or if you're able you know to do\nimaging studies I mean one thing that's\nbeen a little bit of a Holy Grail in\nthis field is that if we could get um\ntracers that are um basically like a you\nknow a molecule that would allow us to\ninject it into somebody and then\nvisualize the brain like if I'm thinking\nabout a pet trace or a radi liend where\nyou could then ask questions about you\nknow what's happening in the brain can\nwe can we give vasor pressent in the\ncontext of a you know functional brain\nImaging scan and ask like where is the\nvasor press and binding what kind of\ncircuits are involved like that needs to\nbe the next step of the work to know\nlike where where our targets are and you\nyou can do something like functional\nproteomics right where if you know where\nbasa press and receptors are you can\noverlay that with studies of functional\nbrain Imaging right and that would allow\nyou to say these areas are dense in\nphasor press and receptors and do we see\nsimilar responses in what we call bold\nsignal on a on a brain scan so let's\nlet's be more colloquial about this like\ndo certain areas of the brain light up\nif you will where we know vasopress and\nreceptors are are densely distributed um\nin ways that we know are tied to social\nmotivation or or social salience or\nother things that we think could be\nmoving the needle here um in the trial\nhow is this happening and and I think\nyou know one thing the reason why we did\nthis work is and I think it speaks to\nwhat you said earlier is there is an\nurgency on the part of parents to say\nyou know my child's brain is developing\nright and and there's a sense of that\nthem you know by the sort of Western\nmodel has failed a lot of people you\nknow they look to doctors and say what\nare what are the solutions and doctors\nwill say well we have a limited number\nof tools in the toolkit here we just\ndon't know right and so you know one of\nthe reasons why they did that big\noxytocin study was that people were\ntrying to get the oxytocin anyway so it\nwas like let's just make sure that this\nis safe let's see if it's effective and\nso some of our thinking was you know as\nsoon as some of this work hits you know\nlike it get and some of the work is been\ncovered by the media and so you know our\nfeeling was we can give this intranasal\num and we can do it under safe\nmonitoring ways um and so people are\ngoing to think about doing these things\nanyway so let's just make sure that this\nis safe and let's test this in a\nrigorous way so we don't know the mode\nof action but then our feeling is is\nthat you know at least from the initial\nsafety data it looks pretty safe um and\nyou know and so the idea would be and\nthere's a long tradition in Psychiatry\nif we don't know the the mechanism of\naction but if we have a medication that\ncan be impactful and improve the lives\nof people with Autism and we can\ndiminish suffering and people can more\nreadily reach their full potential you\nknow to me it actually seems unethical\nnot to move forward in a way that's\nscientifically sound Amen to\nthat this seems like a good time to\nraise the topic of the microbiome and\nnot as an unrelated topic and and here's\nwhy um I've seen a fair number number of\nstudies in Mouse models arguing that in\na mouse model of autism which now\nfrankly I have to kind of wonder about\nthe the um Power of that model but\nanyway the models are out there in the\nfield\num\nthat fecal transplant into a host that\ndoes have social deficits and rescue\nsome degree of social deficits I don't\nknow if this has actually been done in\nhumans as well and for those of you that\nare cringing yes they do feal\ntransplants in humans for treatment of\nobesity and a bunch of other things um\nthis isn't because scientists are\nobsessed with feal matter it's because\num feal matter contains a lot of the\nmicrobiome elements um so the\nmicrobacteria of the the of the gut um\nand the reason I'm raising this now is\nyou know one possibility and it it's not\nmutually exclusive with a brain\nmechanism is that the administration of\nvasopressin somehow rescued a vasopress\ndeficiency in the gut so the questions\nare as follows is there any evidence\nthat vasopress is manufactured in or\nimpacted by the gut microbiome of humans\nwe'll just start with humans since I\nthink most and um because that would\nthat wouldn't be a Smoking Gun but it'\nbe an interesting detective story well\nokay so the one piece of evidence that I\nwill say that I find provocative and\nfascinating and one thing I want to say\nis I I think there's really great work\ndone in mice I don't want to be a mouse\nBasher so I want to just like sort of go\non the record that I'm not bashing other\nmodels um if it's a conser so I think\nabout everything from like an\nevolutionary perspective if a mouse\nshares a brain structure with a human\nand it's highly conserved you know Mouse\nwork can be incredibly important and\nvery impactful right yeah my my lab did\nyears of mouse work some primate work\nwhere necessary um now I only work on\nhumans um but um absolutely it has it\nhas its uses um but clearly the primate\nmodel for social um deficits as it\nrelates to autism you you at least have\nme convinced that that one has a lot of\npower let's just say that exactly okay\nbut I'm going to now say there is a\nreally cool Mouse study that was done\nthat I found and there's been you know\nlots of different studies so there's\nbeen mice so there's these like I said\nthese genetically modified mice that\nhave genetic syndromes that are you know\nwhere the individuals have social\nimpairments and some of these\nindividuals and again here's a here's a\nproblem with a field often they will\nmeasure oxytocin but not vasor pressin\nright so like they're not often both\nmeasured together which I always do now\num but there's been some really\ninteresting evidence that in these Mouse\nmodels that and and again multiple\nstudies but like certainly low blood\noxytocin levels in these Mouse models\nwhat and and with the sense that maybe\nthey have some sort of abnormal gut\nmicrobiome and then what they've done is\nthey've given a probiotic to these mice\nnormalize their social functioning um\nand that in there's an increase in\noxytocin and in a recent study also\nvasopressin at the level of the\nhypothalamus so by giving a probiotic\nyou I believe the oxytocin levels were\nincreased in the blood you saw more\nspecies typical social behavior and this\nwas all driven by this upregulation of\noxytocin gene expression and also vasor\npressent in this very recent study and\nwhat's interesting is there's this nerve\ncalled the vagus nerve which is uh it's\nI think it means the wandering nerve\nvagam it's for Vagabond yeah exactly\nright\nand even it's in the gut but it actually\nhas a direct projection to the nuclei\nand the hypothalamus where oxytocin and\nvasor pressent are made how interesting\nyes and so when you sever the Vagas you\nthen in this one study it's a neuron\npaper um I think it's like 2020 it's a\nsuper cool paper and then what you do is\nyou decrease the gene expression and you\ndon't see the rescue of the oxytocin\nlevels or the social behavior in this\nmodel so so another words if I interpret\nthis correctly and I'll go look up the\npaper and provide a link to it um\nthey're they're by increasing the\ndiversity of gut microbiota because\nthat's really what a probiotic does sort\nof across the board increases the\ndiversity of gut microbiota no one\nspecific ilis as I always say because\nthey all seem to end in ilis you know\nmultiple Iles Iles ilsy here we go again\num you upregulate gene expression and\nthereby action of oxytocin and\nvasopressin in the hypothalamus but\nthat's a neurom mediated thing it's not\nas if the microbiota travel to the brain\nsomething changes in the gut which\nactivates the vagal pathway from gut to\nthe specific nucleus in the brain and um\nwe know that the vagal pathway is\ninvolved because it seems at least\npartially necessary if you sever that\nyou give a vagotomy then the uh this\neffect is is blunted or eliminated\nthat's very interesting and and ties the\nmicrobiome to oxy invasor Preston\nproduction in a neural and somewhat\ncausal way um and makes the data on\nfecal transplants make a lot of more\nsense because I always wondered okay so\nyou take a you know taking the\nmicrobiota from one animal putting into\nanother animal you're creating you're\ntransferring the millu of the gut but it\ndoesn't say anything about mechanism\nright so this this is a really cool\nfascinating and there's also a study\nI've always wanted to do is you can get\na vagal nerve stimulator they used to do\nthem as implants right but you can also\nget one that you sort of clip onto the\near and I've always wanted to ask if we\nwe use this in autistic individuals and\nyou know could we increase like can we\nalter social behavior right and would\nthat be something that we could actually\nmeasure in the blood especially if we're\nseeing this this change in these blood\nlevels right are you doing that\nexperiment no but I've always I've I've\nalways thought it would be we we have to\nget you the to do that experiment and\nand I know a few times you've raised the\nissue of funding it's not something we\nspend a lot of time on this discussing\non this podcast but I think what should\nbe abundantly clear to the listeners um\nthroughout the course of this episode is\nas you mentioned ear you're very\ndetermined to get work done you'll\nfigure out a way but the way I describe\num finances and and research is that\nit's absolutely necessary but it's not\nsufficient you of course have to have\nthe right people in the right lab head\ndirecting the work but no money no no\nproject and it and it is disappointing\nto see that despite the federal budget\nfor research being um you know still\nreasonable it's not what we would like\nit to be um it's still very hard\nfor amazing worldclass Labs like yours\nto say Hey you know listen there's this\nvagel thing and clearly there's a\nrationale it's not like you're pulling\nthis out of out of nowhere and um you\nwant to go do this study but what we're\nreally talking about is three to five\nyears of grant writing before you could\neven initiate that study meanwhile\nautistic kids are going from Age 2 to 5\nto six these are critical windows so if\never there was a um there was a\nrationale for um you know moving a lot\nof funding to uh you know I don't even\ncall it highrisk but you know logically\nsound hypothesis testing for the\ntreatment of autism it's it's now so I'm\nI'm going to get active on on this front\nso I won't get into how but you know uh\nwhen I get something in my uh in my\nneural circuits for for talking they\ntend to not shut down for a while well\nthere will be a community that is is\ngoing to be immensely grateful well it\nseems like um the parents of these kids\nand the kids themselves could greatly\nbenefit so um you mentioned that the\nfirst study on um vpress Administration\nthat saw these improvements in Social\nfunctioning you said a small cohort how\nmany how many kids was It ultimately\nthat you could use data from okay so we\nhad I mean you screen a lot so I think\nour you know because we had very rigid\ncriteria so we ended up with 17 kids\nthat were on active drug and 13 that\nwere on Placebo and then not a study no\nand the placebo CH we we always have\nlike a humanitarian open label extension\narm which allows for anybody who is in\nPlacebo can get access to the drug so\nboth Antonio and I feel very strongly\nabout making sure that if we're doing a\nmedication trial everybody can benefit\nfrom it right so afterwards if they say\nokay I was in the placebo group but I\nreally want the chance to try this thing\nthey can't but then you also get more\ndata we get right so I think when the\nfamilies are now aware that their child\nis on basor pressent and the clinicians\nare aware you know you really want\nthere's a huge Placebo response rate\nright and so I mean it's not a placebo\nresponse rate here but but we really\nwould want to make sure that our\nevaluation of the social behavior is\ndone unaware to the medication but you\ncan get good safety data right so so you\ncan have those you know 13 children who\nwere on Placebo we can then also make\nsure that their blood chemistry Labs\nlook good that their cardiograms look\ngood right and so that also allows us to\nassess safety parameters in a greater\nnumber of children in a fairly broad\nliterature search I was able to find\nokay microbiome so feal transplant is\nsomething that people are excited about\nas weird and there are trials in people\nwith Autism ongoing in using feal\ntransplants okay oxytocin nasal spray\npresumably still being investigated by\nsome groups or it's been abandoned well\nI think it's mostly been abandoned\nbecause there's no funding priorities\nfor it right so so I know that maybe in\nAustralia because of Adam's positive\nfindings that I I don't know what his\nplans are but maybe he's doing work\nthere um there might be a little bit of\nwork with behavioral therapy and\noxytocin but this is the problem when\nthere's one big trial that fails the\nfunding just completely dries up so even\nif there's promise I don't know a single\nfunding agency that's going to touch it\ngot it um and then there's the Vasa\npressen Administration work that you're\ndoing right I think it's worth\ncontrasting that work with the Fairly\nlarge trial that was done by a major\npharmaceutical company exploring the\nrole of vasopress in for the treatment\nof autism um you could tell us what they\ndid because it's\nbasically the opposite of what you did\num and you can tell us the outcome\nbecause I think that if anything that\nstudy um in advertently Provide support\nfor the results that you observed which\nis that administering let's say\nincreasing Bas oppress levels in the\nbrain seems to um ameliorate some of the\nsocial deficits of autism right so um Ro\nhad a compound called bapin which was a\nvasopressin\nv1a receptor antagonist which basically\nmeans there's um I think I mentioned\nthere's these four neuropeptide\nreceptors and oxytocin vas are present\nbinding to each other's receptors but\nthe v1a receptor is the one that is um\nmost implicated in social behavior um\nand so they had and this is the tricky\npart about when medications are\ndeveloped in in Pharma versus in\nacademics right in academics there's\ndefinitely this transparency we write\ngrants the abstracts are are publicly\navailable we register our trials they do\ntoo but a lot of the shall we say early\ndevelopment is all put out in\nPublications right and then it's also\npeer- reviewed and there's you know an\nopen trail of why we're doing what we're\ndoing but in a pharmaceutical company\nyou know they have the ability because\nalso they have all the funding to be\nable to do all kinds of development that\nmay never see the light of day because\nof the proprietary basis of it right and\nso you know when you go back to so it's\nnot it's it still is not clear to me why\nthey took the approach of using an\nantagonist to the main Vaso pressent\nreceptor in the brain um what's\ninteresting is if you go back and you\nlook at the animal literature there are\nhamsters that if you give them vasor\npresson they become aggressive right and\nif you give male Prairie VES vas op\npress they can become aggressive but\nlet's think about the context that\nthey're doing this in these hamsters\nthat show aggression are asocial they\nlive by themselves if you give them vas\noppress and the only social repertoire\nthey have is to you know have sex with a\nfemale or to fight a male that they see\nthey have a very limited social rep\nright and when the Prairie V male is be\nis being given vasopressin it's often in\nthe context of PR like um protecting his\nmate and his offspring and so then it's\nactually species appropriate for him to\nattack a Marauder male on his territory\nwho's going to you know kill his babies\nright and so so my thinking in reading\nthe preclinical literature the animal\nliterature was that all right that makes\na lot of sense in the context of those\nspecies but we've never seen any\nevidence in our Tri aggression didn't\nchange we also have an aggression\nmeasure in this current in the current\ntrial as well but you know for me the\nvast majority of evidence from the\nanimal literature suggested that Vasa\npresson was\npro-social um and that you know\nespecially given our our CSF findings\nlike over and over across species across\nstudies across ages that we we should be\ngiving vaser presson especially given\nthe correlations between vaser presson\nin CSF and symptom severity and autistic\ntraits you know the former and people\nand the latter in the monkeys um and so\nthey had some preliminary studies that I\nbelieve were maybe single dose one that\nthey published um but then they had a\ntrial where the primary outcome measure\nthe social responsiveness scale was\nnegative and then they had um some\nsecondary measures that maybe showed\nsome promise and then they were\nconducting another trial um and then did\na futility analysis and I know they\nstopped the trial and I don't think it\nwas for safety reasons but again you\nknow a lot of this isn't made public\nright because it's a pharmaceutical\ncompany so you know we we will see\nbecause we are going to be completing\nour larger trial you know this year and\nyou know as they say the proof is in the\npudding so we will see if you know we\ncan replicate our initial pilot findings\nwell sounds like they got it backwards\nthat blocking vasopress Pathways would\njust make things worse and that\naugmenting Vis oppress and makes things\nbetter um although that last statement\num needs to be supported by this more\nextensive population well I think you\nknow there's been a lot of speculation\nand maybe there are people closer to the\ntrial than me who might be able to speak\nto mechanism but you know I would meet\nthe RO people at conferences and they\nwould come to my talks and I would\nalways ask him like what's the mechanism\nof action why are you antagonizing the\nsystem when we're giving you know a Vasa\npressent Agonist if you will and you\nknow some people had said well maybe by\nblocking the Vasa presson recept\nyou know there's a way to have oxytocin\nme be more bioavailable that sounds like\nsome gymnastics yeah yeah I totally\ngreat and so I've never had a I I've\nnever received a\ncompelling response from anybody about\nwhy they did their trial and then you\nknow the differences I mean when when\nthis was ongoing and you know there was\npotentially room for both right um you\nknow maybe I thought that maybe there's\nsome some optimal band of Vasa presson\nsignaling in the the brain right and so\nmaybe there's some people where they\nhave too much vasopress and some who\nhave too little right and so this was a\nlot of maybe but it it doesn't to me\nseem like that's the case especially if\nour current trial has a positive rate\nout I'd be remiss if I didn't ask for\nyour stance and uh read of the landscape\non the data about vacines and autism I'm\nnot talking about covid vaccines here I\nwant to be really clear about that but\nthere was a theory uh running about um\nnot just in the Press but in um the\nscientific literature for a while that\nuh vaccines could cause autism yeah that\nwas proposed um my understanding is that\nwas\ndebunked that idea still lives on the\ninternet um but what is the evidence or\nlet let's say let's go through this\nsequentially what was the idea what was\nthe evidence for that idea and\nthen what caused the demise of the the\nat least the scientific support for that\nidea leaving open of course that new\ndata may come right but let's talk about\nwhat is known now right and I think what\nI will say is being evidence-based is is\nsort of like something that all\nscientists should strive for right and\nso so the the backstory on this is there\nwas a guy named Andrew Wakefield who\npublished a paper um and he basically\nsaid the preservatives and vaccines are\ncausing autism so not the specific\nvaccine but the adant the stuff that's\npreserving the stuff that's keeping the\nthe vaccines um bio effective right at\nleast that was my understanding right\nthat's mine as well and so and and then\nit turn I want to be clear because the\ninternet is is a is a cruel and um\ndiabolical place my stance is that that\nwas the hypothesis I don't agree with\nthat stance right okay right and so or\nif we want to just back up a little bit\nbroader there was this idea that\nsomething about vaccines were causing a\num autism but the study was debunked he\nlost his medical license and the paper\nwas retracted right well he lost his\nmedical license on the basis of the fact\nthat the study was wrong or was there\nthink he F the data there were that's\nwhy I recall as well that there was\nevidence of him literally making up the\ndata right right so it wasn't a case of\nlike sloppy technique it was a case of\nof intentional fraud right that's my\nunderstanding again what was the did\nanyone ever like look into what his\nmotivation for what what it was like why\nsomeone would I mean threw away his\nwhole career right yeah I don't I don't\nknow um but but I think the hard part\nabout that is understandably people got\nvery frightened right that we're doing\nsomething to our children that could\nhave you know un unanticipated\nconsequences and you know when something\nlike that happens then we dump a you\nknow we we spend a lot of money\ninvestigating it and so the the the good\nnews is at this point there have been\nmultiple multiple studies that haven't\nshown a correlation between you know\nvaccines and autism I do believe the\npreservatives have been changed as a\nresult so that's something we should\ncheck um that you know that might be\nsomething where you know there's been a\npublic health change on preservatives\nthat are in vaccines that's interesting\nin its own right I mean we don't want to\ncause alarm if um but that's that's\ninteresting you know that that in this\ndata fraud case it might have cued\npeople to the idea that certain things\nmight have been um needing change even\nthough it wasn't the specific issue that\nthis uh this fraudulent researcher was\nfocused on the change was made to make\nsure people would vaccinate their\nchildren right like so this is something\nthat I think we should have lots of\ncaveats here like you know post the post\nthe studies like make sure that what\nwe're saying is accurate right but I but\nI think that my concern is that we've\nspent you know so the good news is that\nyou know the Maj like every single study\nthat I'm aware of does not not show a\nrelationship between vaccination and\nautism right and so I think that most\nscientists and medical doctors that I\nknow that are part of like the you know\nstandard biomed research Community do\nnot believe the vaccines cause autism\nthey vaccinate their own children you\nknow they recommend vaccinations to\nother people's children um and and so I\nthink that's where we are um you know\ncould I just ask a question um uh and I\nfeel more than obligated to do this\nbecause I I don't you know I think I\nhave a pretty good finger on the pulse\nof the listenership of this podcast but\nI think there's a range of of stances on\nthis um where some people um have a lot\nof trust in the standard medical\nestablishment others have less right\ntrust in the standard medical\nestablishment and I wouldn't be doing my\njob if I didn't try and represent um all\nthose sides um and you know one thing\nthat I've heard okay is that over the\nlast 20 or 30 years there's been a\ndramatic increase in the number of\nvaccinations that kids get and I don't\nknow if that's true but when we say\nvaccinations we could be talking about\nyou know measles Mom's forella right um\npolio um we could also be talking about\nmeasles bumps forbell polio flu shots\nevery year rabies vaccine technis\nvaccine H HPV right with one that wasn't\neven available when I was in in college\nyou know as a everyone in college was\nwas well aware there wasn't an HPV\nvaccine um didn't change people's\nbehavior a whole lot but um\nyou\nknow there's there's a vaccine there's\nmultiple vaccines and then there's you\nknow all the vaccines yeah right and I\nthink that one of the concerns that I\nhear about um is the idea that okay\nthere's some critical vaccines but then\nwhich ones are perhaps less critical if\nany um and these are the kinds of\ndiscussions that are starting to surface\num and that you know have parents and\npotential parents you know rightfully\nthinking about this stuff and and no one\nreally knows where to get the\ninformation but like I'm I I've tried\nand I can't find a pediatrician that\nsays Hey listen these but not those or\nyou can certainly find board certified\nPhysicians that say many and certain\nboard certified Physicians that say none\nyou actually can find those um the none\ncategory tend to hide themselves a\nlittle bit more than others for obvious\nreasons but it's hard to get a sense of\nlike which which vaccines are critical\nand which ones aren't if you're a parent\nand you're not versed in this stuff and\nso you could imagine that like people\nare you know kids are taking many more\nvaccines and only some of those are\ncritical or maybe all of them are\ncritical well I think I guess the way I\nwould maybe turn it on its head is that\nyou know because of\nthis this study that did in some ways so\nmuch harm right like we SPI study we\nspent I I I don't even want to Hazard a\nguess about how much money worldwide\nwent into studying you know the the you\nknow vaccine and autism based on a\nfraudulent data right like that's to me\na real tragedy but at the time they\ndidn't know it was fraudulent exactly so\nthey went after this thinking it was\ntrue okay but I think I think the thing\nthe consequence of all this that I think\nis also extremely sad is that\neverybody because everyone got so riled\nup and so fearful there has been\nhistorically until recently many\nresearchers who were like oh man I don't\nwant to touch IM mology and autism with\na 10-ft pole right and yeah you know and\nI I wouldn't consider myself Fearless\nbut like my lab never had any reason to\nwork on those yeah on those important\nproblems but I'll tell you like it seems\nlike a it's not a kettle of fish it's\nit's a ball of barbed wire with a bunch\nof you know Napalm burning around it and\nyou know I mean you say one thing your\nyour career is ending you say the\nopposite thing your career is also\nending you know it's it it's it's a it's\na mess but but I think this highlights\nthat there are so many parents you know\nagain and I think we need to listen to\nparent stakeholders right like you know\nthere's there needs to be a dialogue\nwhenever anybody's studying any illness\nto to talk to the people who are\ninvolved right and and I think that\nthere are parents who will report wow\nlike there are there is immune system\ndisregulation in my child and but\nbecause of this historical issue with\nvaccines it's only been very recently\nthat I think people scientists medical\ndoctors have said okay we're hearing a\nlot about this from parents and are\nthere a group of individuals who have\nyou know um immune issues that could be\ndriving their autism right we don't know\nand everything should be evidence-based\nbut I think that like you said with this\ncancel culture and all this fear\nscientists sometimes will pick topics\nvery judiciously based on you know like\nhey I just want to be left in peace and\nI'm trying to help this community and if\nthere is areas of the Enterprise that\nyou think are going to cause all kinds\nof grief then people are going to be\nless reluctant to study them even if\nit's critically needed well that's a a\nperfect place to say thank you I realize\nyou're not addressing the vaccine autism\nissue directly but you're so clearly\ngoing after the target trying to figure\nout what are the biological mechanisms\nthat are disrupted in autism and by\nextension other deficits of social\nfunction in kids and adults you've\nidentified this incredible relationship\nbetween\nvasopress which should have more\nprominence in my opinion than oxytocin\nits lesser cousin just kidding oxytocin\nlovers um but also have shown you know\nyes in a small study but you're now\nextending this to a larger cohort as you\nmentioned uh a causal relationship when\nB oppress is administered to these low\nvasopress SL low social functioning kids\ntheir symptoms improve so I I know I\nspeak for many people when I say that um\nI truly appreciate your doggedness in in\ngoing after this problem especially on\nthe complicated landscape of lack of\nfunding for doing novel and truly\nhigh-risk work um especially on the\nbackdrop of the sociopolitical landscape\naround autism it's a complicated thing\neven to discuss you know as I mentioned\nin the introduction you know we had to\nhave some fluency around autism so we\nsometimes said autistic sometimes we\nsaid people with Autism you know I mean\nit's a it's a tough one but in order to\nmake progress real progress in this area\nwe need people like you we need you and\nyou're doing it to get in there and just\ngo okay you know let's get at the\nbiological functions let's get at the\nnovel treatments and you're making\namazing progress so I'm so grateful that\nyou're doing it and that you'll continue\nto do it and that you came here today um\nto teach us what you've been up to um\nI'm oh so grateful and I just want to\nsay thank you for that and that we\nabsolutely have to get
