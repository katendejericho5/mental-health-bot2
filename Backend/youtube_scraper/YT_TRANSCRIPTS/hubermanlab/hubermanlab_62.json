    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Robert Green\nRobert Green is an author who has\nwritten more than five best-selling\nbooks including the 48 Laws of Power the\nlaws of human nature and Mastery he did\nhis bachelor's training at the\nUniversity of California Berkeley and\nthe University of Wisconsin at Madison\nRobert Green's books are both unique and\nimportant for several reasons not the\nleast of which is that they explore the\ninteraction between the psychology of\nself self-exploration and the psychology\nof human interaction all rooted in\nhistory and modern culture and at the\nsame time in a way that pertains to\neverybody I first learned about Robert's\nwork from reading the book Mastery which\nto my mind is a brilliant exploration\nand a practical tool for how to think\nabout and pursue one's purpose purpose\nwhenever I'm asked for book suggestions\nI always include Mastery in my top three\nrecommendations during today's\ndiscussion we cover a wide range of\ntopics including how to find and pursue\nand Achieve one's purpose we talk about\nthe selection of a life partner as well\nas romantic and other types of\nrelationships we also discussed the\ntopics of motivation and urgency and\nthis concept of death ground which arose\nduring our discussion of Robert's recent\nstroke Robert stroke rendered him\ncertain limitations but also has allowed\nhim to explore how to write how to\nexercise indeed how to interface with\nlife in general in new ways that allow\nhim to continue to expand his sense of\npurpose I'm certain that by the end of\ntoday's episode you will have gleaned\ntremendous amounts of new knowledge that\nwill allow you to navigate forward along\nthe path to your purpose perhaps find\nyour purpose if you feel you haven't\ndone that yet as well as to greatly\nenhance your relationship with yourself\nwith others and indeed to the world\naround you before we begin I'd like to\nemphas EMP iiz that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Roka Roa\nmakes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are\nof the absolute highest quality I've\nspent a lifetime working on the biology\nthe visual system I can tell you that\nyour visual system has to contend with\nan enormous number of challenges in\norder for you to be able to see clearly\nRoa understands those challenges and has\ndesigned their eyeglasses and sunglasses\naccordingly so that you always see with\nCrystal Clarity Roa ey glasses and\nsunglasses are designed with a new\ntechnology called float fit which allows\nthem to fit perfectly and not move\naround even when you're active in fact\nwhenever I'm wearing my Roa eyeglasses\nor sunglasses I usually forget that I'm\nwearing them I happen to wear Roa\neyeglasses at night when I drive or if\nI'm reading at night and I wear Roa\nsunglasses during the daytime if it's\nvery bright especially if I'm driving\ninto sunlight if you'd like to try Roa\neyeglasses or sunglasses you can go to\nroka.com that's\nr.com and enter the code huberman for\n20% off your first order again that's\nr.com and enter the code

today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by waking up waking\nup is a meditation app that includes\nhundreds of meditation programs\nmindfulness trainings yoga NRA sessions\nand nsdr non-sleep deep breast protocols\nI started using the waking up app a few\nyears ago because even though I've been\ndoing regular meditation since my teens\nand I started doing Yoga Nidra about a\ndecade ago my dad mentioned to me that\nhe had found an app turned out to be the\nwaking up app which could teach you\nmeditations of different durations and\nthat had a lot of different types of\nmeditations to place the brain and body\ninto different states and that he liked\nit very much so I gave the waking up app\na try and I too found it to be extremely\nuseful because sometimes I only have a\nfew minutes to meditate other times I\nhave longer to meditate and indeed I\nlove the fact that I can explore\ndifferent types of meditation to bring\nabout different levels of understanding\nabout Consciousness but also to place my\nbrain and body into lots of different\nkinds of States depending on which\nmeditation I do I also love that the\nwaking up app has lots of different\ntypes of Yoga Nidra sessions for those\nof you who don't know Yoga Nidra is a\nprocess of lying very still but keeping\nan active mind it's very different than\nmost meditations and there's excellent\nscientific data to show that yoganidra\nand something similar to it called\nnon-sleep deep rest or nstr can greatly\nrestore levels of cognitive and physical\nenergy even with just a short 10-minute\nsession if you'd like to try the waking\nup app you can go to waking up.com\nhuberman and access a free 30-day trial\nagain that's waking up.com huberman to\naccess a free 30-day trial and now for\nmy discussion with Robert Green Robert\nI'm so happy you're here I'm really\nreally happy to be here Andrew thank you\nso much for inviting me a short\nstory in 2015 I was teaching a course to\nundergraduates this was a big course 450\nstudents where was this this was when I\nwas a professor at University of\nCalifornia San Diego I was about to move\nback to Stanford um but the course was\nentitled neural circuits in health and\ndisease but there was a final lecture\nwhere I would do a lot of Q&A with the\nstudents about science about careers\nabout career paths and what I found was\nthat many of the students had questions\nabout not just science but about how to\nlearn and forage for information yeah\nand I recommended three books at the end\nof the course every year that I taught\nit I taught it for four years and one of\nthe books was the book longitude which\nis a wonderful story about discovery of\ntimekeeping devices at c um one book\nI'll leave as a mystery um not to be not\nto be mysterious but because it's not\nit's it's a science book I'll just tell\nyou what it is it's um uh principles of\nNeuroscience so I thought that they I\ndon't know that one yeah it's a big it\nmakes a better a door stop uh for most\nthan than a book but it's it's a\nwonderful resource um if you want to\nlearn about neuroscience and your book\nMastery wow and the reason I recommended\nMastery is because these students were\nsoon going to go into the great Jungle\nof you know post uh undergraduate\neducation and and for me I found Mastery\nto be an absolutely transformative book\nin that it taught me so much about how\nto learn from others how to expect\ncertain types of um interactions when\none kind of assigns themselves to a\nmentor um and vice versa and it talked\nabout some things that we'll get into in\nmore depth today but not the least of\nwhich is about identifying that um\nunique seed that exists within all of us\nthat can guide our best decisions in\nterms of finding our purpose and it and\nso I will usually end with a great debt\nof gratitude and I'll probably do that\nagain at the end but I want to start\nwith a great debt of gratitude than\nMastery transformed my entire life and\nand in many ways this podcast probably\nwouldn't exist were it not for Mastery\nbecause um it really embedded in me this\nidea that we all have uh a deeper\npurpose and it explains how to go about\nfinding that purpose so I tell you that\nand I also will use that as a way for um\nasking you now since I'm sure people's\nears are pricked up to this you know how\ndo you find your purpose um could you\nshare with us what what it is to find\none's purpose and how early life events\nperhaps can cue us to what that purpose\nis for each of us well thank you for\nthat that marvelous introduction I'm\nalmost blushing that's that's fantastic\nstory um well you know being a human\nbeing is not easy as opposed to an\nanimal because we're born and nobody\ngives us like a direction our parents\nmight be a little bit our college\nteachers Etc mentors but generally we're\non our own and it's a very very\ndifficult process you wake up in the\nmorning and you don't really know what\nyou're what you can do you could choose\n12 different paths it can be very\nconfusing and very overwhelming when you\nfind that sense of purpose when you find\nwhat I call your life's task everything\nhas a direction everything has a purpose\nyour energy is concentrated it's not\nlike you're just going down a single\nnarrow pathway it's not like life\nbecomes boring and it's just about\ndiscipline and solving problems it's\nactually the most exciting thing that\ncan ever happen to you because you never\nhave that lost feeling you wake up in\nthe morning and you go yeah this is what\nI need to accomplish people come at you\nwith all kinds of distractions and\nboring and irritating things you're able\nto cut it out it's just the most\nmarvelous piece of internal radar that\nyou can have so I genuinely wish that\neverybody can find that that kind of\ninternal radar and so it's not easy and\nI understand that there's no like\ninstant formula because we're all about\ninstant formulas it's difficult and I\nwant you to know that so it's not like\nRobert can give me the answer in three\nminutes no I can't but there's a process\ninvolved it's not it's not you know a\nmystery you can follow a very singular\nprocess and the idea is you're were\ntalking about\nchildhood the way I like to frame it is\nwhen you were born you are a phenomenon\nyou are unique your DNA has never\noccurred in the history of the universe\ngoing back billions of years it will\nnever occur in the future your life\nexperien with your parents and\neverything that you experienc in your\nearly years going on up is unique it's\nyours you're one of a kind right so that\nis your source of power to waste that is\njust the worst thing you can do in your\nlife and what what the power is is\nfinding that uniqueness what makes you\nyou and how you can mine that and how\nyou can go deep into it and use that to\ncreate a career path right and so I tell\npeople when you're a child when you're\nfour or five or even younger you have\nwhat the great psychologist maslo called\nimpulse voices they Little voices in\nyour head that say I love this I hate\nthat I like this food I don't like when\nMommy moves this way I like when Daddy\ncomes from from here you're very CED\ninto who you are and what you like and\nwhat you don't like and these voices\nkind of direct you in certain ways\nright and when you're very young they\ndirect you towards intellectual mental\nPursuits as well and there's a book I\nrecommend for everybody uh it's Howard\nGardner's five frames of mind it's\nhelped me immensely the idea is he talks\nabout five forms of\nintelligence our problem is we think of\nintelligence as most intellectual but\nthere are many forms of intelligence\nthere's the intelligence that has to do\nwith words there's abstract intelligence\nthat has to do with patterns and\nMathematics there's kinetic intelligence\nthat has to do with the body there's\nsocial intelligence he has five of them\nand the idea is your brain naturally\nveers towards one of them it can Veer\ntowards two of them that happens but\ngenerally one of them kind of dominates\nright and it's like a grain in your\nbrain that's going in a certain\ndirection ction you want to go with that\ngrain and because that's where your\npower will lie so when you're young if\nyou go back and think about when you\nwere four or five you you can maybe get\na picture of some kind of direction or\nvoice inside of you that was impelling\nyou towards this I know for me it was\nwords from I can remember when I was six\nyears old I was just obsessed with words\njust the letters in Words almost like in\nalmost slightly schizophrenic way I\nwould spell words backwards I would take\nthem apart I would do anagrams I love\npaland drums right so I had a thing\nabout words and language it's very\nPrimal some people you know Albert\nEinstein when he was four years old his\nfather gave him a birthday gift of a\ncompass and he was just mesmerized by\nthis Compass the idea that there are\ninvisible forces out there in the cosmos\nmoving this needle and he's obsessed\nwith the idea of invisible forces Steve\nJobs when he was like seven or eight or\nmaybe younger in Berling game California\nhis father they passed by a store with\nde technological devices in the window\nand he was just hypnotized by the design\nof those devices and the glass tubes and\neverything so he wanted to go in that\ndirection you know Tiger Woods saw his\nfather hitting golf balls in the garage\nand he was just like screaming with joy\nhe had to he had to do that right you\nknow I can give you a million different\nexamples of this of course these are\npeople who are famous obviously we can\ngo back and find that it's easier but\nwhat happens to you and please cut me\noff if I'm going on too long no please\ncontinue please what happens to you is\nyou're seven now you're getting older\nand you're starting to not hear that\nvoice anymore you're hearing the voice\nof your teachers telling you you're not\ngood at this field you need to get\nbetter at math you know you shouldn't be\ninterested in these sports or anything\nyou should be going this dire your\nparents are starting to tell you this is\nthe career they want for the direction\nthey want you to go in right\nyou start hearing that more than your\nown voice and as you get older it gets\nworse and worse and worse then when\nyou're a teenager it's all about what\nother people are doing your peers what's\ncool what's not cool you know and that\nkind of is more so all of these noise\nenters your brain and you can't hear\nthat anymore you don't know who you are\nand so you go to\ncollege you kind of maybe choose a a\nmajor that seems practical that your\nparents want you to to go into maybe you\nkind of wander around you're not sure\nand then you enter the work world\nwithout that inner radar that I'm\ntalking about and you brother you're\nlost right where should I go well I need\nto make money right and so you make a\nchoice based on the need to make a lot\nof money some not everyone but some\npeople do that and I understand that\nneed we all need to make a living but\nthat can set you off on a very bad path\nbecause you're not connected emotionally\nthe thing is when you figure out that\nPrimal inclination that grain that's\ninside of you then you have the the\nenergy to to do to be disciplined to go\nthrough boring tasks to learn you learn\nat a faster rate because you're\nemotionally engaged when you're\nemotionally engaged in a subject the\nbrain learns twice three times four\ntimes as fast as when you're not I\nalways give the example in college I\nstudied foreign languages which was kind\nof a passion of mine for three or four\nyears I studied French and then I went\nto Paris and I couldn't speak a word it\nwas it was useless because it didn't\nteach me anything practical right I was\ntotally confused and then but I was in\nParis and I and I loved it and I wanted\nto live there right and I had a\ngirlfriend and I needed to speak French\nto her and I can tell you in one month I\nlearned more than those four years of\nUniversity because I wanted to because I\nwas engaged my emotions were there it\nwas like I had to survive to learn\nFrench whereas so most of us we don't\nhave a need really to learn this subject\nWe're Half we're paying half attention\nbut when you find that thing that really\nconnects to you you're paying deep\nattention your emotions are engaged\nyou're learning at a much faster rate\nokay and so the thing is how do you find\nthat when you're older when you're 21 I\nI I give people a lot of help and it's\nusually not so difficult we can go\nthrough that process it gets harder when\nyou're 30 and you've been wandering\naround but it's not impossible I didn't\nreally start find my exact path until I\nwas 38 39 to be honest so there's hope\nwhen you get 40 and you get 50 gets more\nand more difficult right and it's very\nsad if you wasted that seed of\nuniqueness that I'm talking about and I\ntell people there are ways of going back\nand we go through a process like\narchaeology we have to dig and dig and\ndig and find those bones from your\nchildhood that indicated what you were\nmeant to do do but when you find your\nlife's task everything opens up it\ndoesn't mean you figured out okay I've\ngot to aim for this particular job when\nI'm 28 that's not how it works it gives\nyou a sense of direction you can try\ndifferent things you can experiment you\ncan have fun when you're in your 20s\nyou're going to learn you're going to\nlearn skills but it gives you an overall\nframework instead of whoa all this\nconfusion this chaos social media the\ninternet I could go here here here\nyou're lost at C it gives you a very\nimportant sense of direction\nCompass as you described this I I have\nthis image of um you know you mentioned\nanimals um that presumably don't have a\nlot of flexibility in terms of the\nniches they can exist in but the way I\nimagine this process is that as a human\nwe're plopped into a environment and\nhere I'm using analogy where um we don't\nreally know if we are an aquatic animal\na terrestrial animal or a or an Aven\nright or an amphibian or an amphibian\nfor that matter\num and to make the wrong choice right to\nbe an amphibian who's trying to fly\nalthough I'm sure they're out there um\nin the animal kingdom uh it it's not\njust a waste of time it's probably\ndeadly um and not to overd dramatize the\nthe failure of finding one's purpose but\nI see it that way whereas um perhaps we\ncould just say that the process of\nfinding one's purpose is to to realize\nlike ah you know um I'm an amphibian I\ncan go in and out of water whereas a\nbunch of other creatures around me stop\nat the water's edge right right and this\nis really cool and a bunch of these\nother things like these flying things\nthat they can't actually even go in the\nwater some of them might you know be on\nthe surface or dive into it but they\nthey can't do what I can do so the\nprocess of self-discovery it sounds like\nit's about um restricting one's choices\nto a a a sort of wedge within the full\nlandscape of of options and um you know\nfor me I can certainly recall after\nreading Mastery it helped me recall some\nearly seed emotions that I experienced\nas a very distinct sensation in my body\ncan you describe that yeah um without\nmaking it too um specific to my my\nunique taste you know as a kid I loved\num flora and fauna I loved learning\nabout biology sure yeah no surprise\nthere um but animals and how they move\nin particular and fish and going to a a\nproper aquarium store for the first time\nfor me and going snorkeling for the\nfirst time was like Wow and even as I\ndescribe it it's almost like my body\nfloats I feel it in my left arm of all\nthings and it feels like there's\nsomething to do about it it's not just\nthat I'm in observation of things that\nDelight me right it's like there's\nsomething there's an activation State\ncreated within me like I got to do\nsomething with this and typically it's\ntell everybody about it until they won't\nlisten anymore um but oftentimes it's to\nalso draw those things to think about\nthem and I just Delight in them it's a\nconstant source of delight and so seeds\nsuch as those and there are a few other\nthings in that in that landscape of\nFlora and Fauna and learning about\nanimals and biology including the human\nanimal and then organizing information\nfeels so satisfying to me it's like a\ndrug that um and so it just felt feels\nlike this you know Eternal spring of of\nlife right and so for me that's what it\nwas and to and in 2015 when I was\nteaching that course the course I loved\nbut I was feeling a little bit astray in\nmy scientific career and then I read\nMastery and I realized yes I love\nrunning laboratory I love teaching but\nthere's something else for me and it has\nto do not with a podcast I didn't even\nknow what a podcast I probably I knew\nwhat a podcast was I was listening to\npodcasts at that time but um but I\nwasn't on social media I had no thoughts\nof having a podcast but what I wanted\nwas that feeling in\nits total number of forms that's the\ngoal get that feeling in as many forms\nas possible right is that is that about\nthat's that's that's absolutely perfect\nbecause the connection to what I'm\ntalking about it's not an intellectual\nthing it's it's visceral it's emotional\nit's physical right and you feel it in\nyour body and when you're doing it it's\nlike it's at your level it's like you're\nswimming with the current you feel it\nthings are easy everything clicks\ntogether there's a delight not\neverything is going to be delightful\nthere's going to be tedium involved\nthere's going to be moments of boredom\nbut you're able to withstand the moments\nof boredom because you feel that deep\noverall connection so yes that's\nprecisely what I'm talking about I mean\nit's for me it's a little bit a similar\nthing is I said about words but the\nother thing that I was obsessed with\nwhen I was a kid was early human\nancestors don't ask me why I just was so\nobsessed with our ancestors millions of\nyears ago and how it's possible to be\nliving here in the 60s or 70s with cars\nand everything but to come to where we\nare now and I wrote a a short story when\nI was 8 years old about a vulture It Was\nWritten from the point of view of a\nvulture watching the first humans kind\nof emerge on the planet I'm sure it was\nabsolutely awful Dreadful but the weird\nthing is I'm writing a new book and all\nI'm doing in that book is going into ear\ninto early humans and I feel like a kid\nagain I'm so excited I'm so happy so I\ncan very much relate to your\nstory you mentioned these five different\nforms of intelligence or frame frames of\nMind as you referred to them um and\nI'm certainly aware that you know I lean\ntowards a more intellectual interests\nalthough as you pointed out the the\nexcitement the Delight is visceral yeah\nand the actions are actions they're of\nthe body ultimately right um one has to\ndraw speak write books Etc um to to\ntransmute that excitement into something\nreal for people that are not as\nintellectually tuned but maybe are\nkinesthetically tuned for instance um I\ncan only wonder what that's like uh I'm\nnot completely uncoordinated but I don't\nthink I have a kinesthetic Attunement uh\nor frame of mind but I for instance um\nhad a podcast listener mention that they\nthink in feels that they literally\nexperience thought as a Ser as sort of a\npatchwork of of bodily Sensations right\nand that thought for them is not of the\nstuff from the neck up but only from the\nneck down which to me was really\nintriguing\nand so I only rais this because um there\nhave to be a as you point out there's an\ninfinite number of different sort of um\norientations based on our unique DNA and\nexperience but what do you\nthink explains why these particular\nseeds or uh as you point out like the\nthe the direction that the grain runs in\nthe brain I mean it's it's partially\ngoing to be nature it's going to be DNA\nsure um but we we're talking about this\nas if there's some exciting or a\ninspiring or Delight ful thing that\ncaptures us can it be the other way too\ncan it be um you know one has a bad\nexperience as a child in an intellectual\nenvironment and then decides you know\nI'm I'm going in the D things of the\nbody feel good if things of the mind of\nintellect feels bad and does it matter\nwhether or not we are drawn to our\nPurpose By recognizing what we love or\nwhat we hate um or are both useful oh\nthey're both very very useful\num you know a lot of intelligence is is\nnot is non-verbal we think in terms of\nimages we're we're very much infected by\nthe emotions of other people so I know\nfor instance uh my mother is very very\ninterested in history she's obsessed\nwith history and I probably absorbed her\ninterest in history I don't think\nthere's a genetic a gene for that\ninterest you know so you're you're going\nto absorb things from your parents as\nwell so it's not all\njust genetic but yeah what you hate will\npay a big have a big thing but the\nproblem with doing that is if you go\ninto a direction and you're in you're in\nelementary school Etc and they force you\nto learn math and you hate it what it\ntends to do is it turns you off from\nlearning in general you think I don't\nwant to I don't want to I don't want to\nbe disciplined I don't want to go\nthrough anything because it's painful\ndoesn't lead anywhere it's not me\nfrustration it turns you off from\nlearning in general so it's it's really\nreally important for a child to have the\nlove experience as early as possible so\nthat they can know what they hate and\nwhy they hate it right and then they can\nRebel and they can go into that field as\nopposed to I hate learning I hate\ndiscipline I hate studying I hate trying\nthings over and over again if you're\nkinesthetically oriented and you know a\npart of me I understand that because I\nlove sports is you have to you have to\npractice it's going to take a lot of\nit's not you're not going to instantly\nbe good at something right and that's\ngoing to require a love of it right but\nif your math experience CU I hate\nlearning you're not it's going to\ntransfer to sports you're going to hate\ndiscipline in general so it's very\nimportant for parents to let that child\nhave at least glimmers of that love\nmoment I know for me when I um finished\ncollege and I entered the work world I\nhad to get a job I got worked in\njournalism I hated it I hated working\nfor other people I hated office politics\nI hated all the egos I hated the\nsmarminess I hated the lack of quality\nit was all just about you know making\nmoney and getting things out there and\nthen I worked in Hollywood I hated\nHollywood I hated working in Hollywood\nthat formed me very much made me go in\nthe direction that I went in but only\nfrom the basis of I knew that I wanted\nto be a writer so you know that's very\nimportant that it's not just hate it can\nform you but there also has to be that\npositive deep emotional love of\nsomething that also is grounded in you\nin some way what you just said really\nhighlights the fact that energy and\nmotivation can come from either either\npressure you know desire for something\nor desire to get away from something and\num earlier when you were talking about\num how we are so much more engaged and\ndriven toward things that stir us\nemotionally and and actually we know\nbased on the the neurosciences you know\ntoo I'm sure that um only by the release\nof certain neurochemicals in the brain\nand body would our brain have any reason\nto change right if you don't feel\nagitation and you can do everything that\nyou're trying to do of course your brain\nwouldn't change like why would it right\nthat agitation is a is a signature of\nthe neurochemicals that are saying hey\nsomething's different now right right\nyou might need to do something different\nincluding rewire yourself right um and\nthat can come from positive or negative\nexperiences I'm obsessed with this ideaa\nof energy I mean we all want to have\nmore energy and focus and normally we\nhear about the concept of energy in the\ncontext of caloric energy like what\nshould we eat and when and how much and\nwe need to get sleep but what you're\nreally referring to is neural energy\nlike the engagement of ourselves that's\nyou know uh sitting there ready to be\nengaged but it requires the right\nexperiential macronutrients right the\nexperiential micronutrients as opposed\nto of course we need good nutrition but\nthat's not sufficient it's NE necessary\nbut not sufficient so uh would you say\nthat when um we are let let's say since\na good number of our listeners are in\nadulthood um you know from our 20s on\nthat the things that excite us as adults\nthat really generate some feeling of\nReadiness or or grab our attention um\nare still informative toward guiding our\ndecisions about best life and life\npurpose well um what do you what exactly\ndo you mean by that I mean like because\nthere are things that excite you in in a\nkind of a quick way like you know where\nyou have to relieve some tension and you\nthere's entertainment and there's things\nthat kind of give you pretty immediate\ngratification and there's the larger P\npicture of something that will give you\nfulfillment over years to come so you\ncan feel that when you're older and you\ncan pay attention to it but a lot of the\ntime is we we're paying too much\nattention to the immediate pleasures of\nlife to what gives us instant Gra\nification and that's what we're grabbing\nfor so this is a much more kind of\ndeeper process that involves that\ndigging that I was saying it it's it's\ndeeper than just kind of I like this I\ndon't like that you know kind of thing\nit's it's more it's more something macro\nthan than just just that and so when\nyou're in your 20s or in your 30s or\nyour 40s you want to be paying attention\nto yourself and the problem with people\nin the world today is you're not paying\nattention to yourself you're not inside\nyour own head you don't hear those\nvoices you don't hear what you love what\nyou like anymore because as I said\nthere's so many of these other\ndistractions going on and so you're\nalways like attuned to what other people\nlike right because you're in social\nmedia this is what people are following\nthis is what they're interested in as\nopposed to disengaging backing off from\nthat and and looking at yourself and\ngoing through the process of that's not\nme actually I don't really like that you\nknow and so what you're talking about is\nI think very profound is levels of\nfrustration or anxiety are definite\nsignals that you must pay attention to\nthat they're telling you this isn't a\ngood direction for you this is a waste\nof time for you and in general I tell\npeople selfawareness being able to hear\nthose voices to understand that your\nfrustration is telling you something and\nsometimes you you just act on it without\nunderstanding it but understanding why\nyou're frustrated why you don't like\nyour career why you're not happy about\nwhere you're going is the key to\neverything it will open up it will\nactually be able even in your 30s to\nreturn you to that childhood inclination\nbut if you can't listen to where those\nemotions come from then they're useless\nthey're not teaching you\nanything as we all know quality\nnutrition influences of course our\nphysical health but also our mental\nhealth and our cognitive functioning our\nmemory our ability to learn new things\nand to focus and we know that one of the\nmost important features of highquality\nnutrition is making sure that we get\nenough vitamins and minerals from\nhighquality unprocessed or minimally\nprocessed sources as well as enough\nprobiotics and prebiotics and fiber to\nsupport basically all the cellular\nfunctions in our body including the gut\nmicrobiome now I like most everybody try\nto get optimal nutrition from Whole\nFoods ideally mostly from minimally\nprocessed or nonprocessed Foods however\none of the challenges that I and so many\nother people face is getting enough\nservings of high quality fruits and\nvegetables per day as well as fiber and\nprobiotics that often accompany those\nfruits and vegetables that's why way\nback in 2012 long before I ever had a\npodcast I started drinking ag1 and so\nI'm delighted that ag1 is sponsoring the\nhubman Lab podcast the reason I started\ntaking ag1 and the reason I still drink\nag1 once or twice a day is that it\nprovides all of my foundational\nnutritional needs that is it provides\ninsurance that I get the proper amounts\nof those vitamins minerals prob biotics\nand fiber to ensure optimal mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nif you'd like to try ag1 you can go to\ndrink a1.com huberman to claim a special\noffer they're giving away five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim that special offer so\nit sounds like one of the goals is to\nengage in what I'll just call for the\nmoment unadulterated self referencing\nyou know unadulterated uh in the the all\nsenses of the word because um as a child\nas you pointed out um at stages of life\nthat are before puberty they're\nliterally prex um which I think is\nimportant right because um puberty to me\nas a neurobiologist who started off as a\ndevelopmental\nneurobiologist I can tell you that\npuberty is the most profound\ntransformation that the brain undergoes\nfor sure in the entire lifespan there's\njust absolutely no question about it\neverything is different after puberty\nbecause of all of the new relational\ndynamics that become apparent and our\npotential involvement in them yeah it's\njust it's you know it's not talked about\nenough how dramatically puberty changes\nthe brain sure I mean we are different\npeople before and after puberty hormones\nthat are suddenly raging the hormones\nare there and it's not just changes in\nhow we view the world but changes in how\nthe World Views us and not just through\nthe lens of sexuality but also so um\nexpectation of what we are capable of\nwhat we are responsible for or not\nresponsible for our learning capacity I\nmean puberty is like this you know it's\nalso the most rapid stage of Aging in\nour entire lifespan those kids that go\nhome for summer and then come back like\nshaving you know I was sort of a late I\nwasn't a late bloomer but I had a long\nprotracted puberty but I remember those\nkids I'm sure we we all remember those\nkids um everything changes and so I\nthink prior to puberty these seeds as\nyou described them of of delight or of\nresistance to things think they are\nunadulterated they're not contaminated\nby the voices and expectations of others\nand so I can see the challenge of\nreaching back to those as an adult um I\nwonder if this relates to um something\nthat I've heard you talk about before\nalthough perhaps not as much as some of\nthe other topics you've discussed\npublicly which is um the real versus the\nfalse Sublime oh um could you perhaps\njust Define for us what Sublime really\nis what a Sublime experience is and and\nthe distinction between real and false\nwow Sublime experiences because I I feel\nlike this relates to finding that seed\nright it's it's about finding authentic\nseeds of within us as opposed to when\nemotions can be distracting and\nmisleading wow I never thought I never\nmade that connection and it's the book\nthat I'm writing right now so thank you\nfor that I have to think about that I'm\nactually I'm writing a book on the\nsublime and um I have several ways of\nkind of illustrating I generally like to\nuse a metaphor and the metaphor is that\nbeing a human being being a social human\nbeing living in a particular culture\nmeans that you live inside of a circle\nand that Circle of that time are the\nconventions of thinking of ideas that\nare acceptable of behavior that is\nacceptable this is where you where you\ncan go mentally where you can go\nphysically you know all the codes and\nconventions so\nthat Circle for ancient Egypt and for\n21st century America they're obviously\nvery different but it's the same Circle\nit's the same limiting factor you're not\nsupposed to go outside of it these are\nthoughts experiences Behavior you're not\nsupposed to do the sublime is what lies\njust outside that Circle um the word\nsublime comes from on the threshold of\nit's like here's a door and the sublime\nis literally at the threshold of the\ndoor you're looking out into something\nelse right and the quintessential\nSublime experience is a near-death\nexperience you're standing on the on the\ndoorway the threshold of death itself\nright and so in my book I'm illustrating\nthe different kinds of sublime\nexperiences that you can have in\nrelation to the cosmos in the relation\nto thinking about being alive just being\nalive is the strangest sensation you can\npossibly have I have I know that very\nperson personally after my stroke I go\ninto childhood chapter on childhood and\nhow Sublime your own childhood was I go\ninto animals relation to animals I go\nhave a chapter about the brain chapter\nabout love I'm working right now on a\nchapter about history okay but what I'm\ntrying to say is the human brain is\nwired for these experiences is wired for\ntranscendental experiences that take us\nout of the narrow little realm that we\nlive in because we're aware of our death\nas the only animal truly conscious of\nits own mortality and it frightens the\nhell out of us and the idea that we can\nsee something larger than than just the\nthe the banal parts of our life is a\ndoorway that op allows us to kind of\ntranscend the moment to feel connected\nto something larger to feel connected to\nsome power in the cosmos to Evolution\nitself right and so we're wired for that\nand I'm writing a chapter now about\n40,000 years ago at the moment where I\nthink the sublime was born is a story\nthat I'm trying to illustrate right now\nwith our upper Paleolithic\nancestors so it's deep inside of us we\nneed it we have to have it in the 21st\ncentury we have very few avenues for it\nany real Avenues religion used to be the\nmain kind of way of accessing this and\nso because it's so deep we reach for\nfalse forms of the sublime that give us\nthe sense that we're we're transcending\nbut it's not at all because Sublime has\nto come from within it's an experience\nthat you have that you're generating in\nyour own mind and your own experience\nthe false Sublime comes from outside it\ncomes from drugs it comes from alcohol\nit comes from shopping it comes from\nonline rage it comes from joining a\ncause and just getting out all your\naggression and violence right it comes\nfrom causes it comes from\naddictions okay it giv you a sense it\ncalms you down and makes you feel like\nthere's something else going on in life\nbesides your job that you're you're sick\nof but it's not real it's not lasting\nit's false it's an illusion it's not\nbased on anything real it's not\nconnecting to that deep part of human\nnature that's wired for these\nexperiences so what happens is you have\nto have more and more and more and more\nof it you have to have you know more of\nthis rush you need more of the drug you\nneed more of the alcohol you need more\nof the sex you need more of the horn\nit's never going to satisfy you but the\nreal Sublime you don't have that feeling\nit's like it's transformative once you\nfeel it it lasts for you for the rest of\nyour life it's what maslo again called a\npeak experience so that's the difference\nbetween the faults and the real Sublime\nI haven't quite connected it to what you\nwere saying but if I think about it I\nthink you're on something very\ninteresting I mean maybe the connection\nI was trying to draw was uh doesn't hold\nbut yeah for me\num those early experiences of seeing\nthings that just delighted me in a way\nthat felt like that not only is well the\nthe the thought process was a long time\nago when something like oh my goodness I\ncan't believe this exists this is so\ncool this is the coolest thing and so\nclearly create an activation state\nwithin me but then there was also a\nthought and a feeling of again a lot\nthis is or pre preverbal it's not truly\npreverbal I could speak at that age but\nit was um that's of me and I'm of it\nright there's a connection there and\nthen it was there's something to do\nabout this the activation State created\nin the body was you know I I need to\nlearn more about this I need to tell\npeople about this I need to think about\nthis I need more examples of this and\nsee whether or not they're all like this\nyou know etc etc um so certainly it\nmeets some of the criteria of a Sublime\nexperience definitely and I knew again\nwhen I was in graduate school and again\nwhen I was this young Professor about to\ntransition to tenure that I knew it was\ngoing going to do something different it\nwas as if I was on the threshold of\nsomething but I didn't know what that\nnext thing was but I could trust it\nbecause of that early experience of\nknowing that's the threat like like I'm\nan amphibian this is my environment and\nyou're an amphibian too right and we're\ndifferent amphibians but you know we're\ngoing to be amphibians together right\nand then and there's a permanence to it\nthat it does seem to transcend time you\nI'm obsessed with time perception so I\nhave to be careful not to go off on a\ntangent about that but the human brain's\nability to F slice or macro slice time\nis incredible and and it's been said of\num not just addictions but also\ninteractions with toxic people that they\nmurder time that that humans have a I\nthink it was young I I'll look it up but\num one of the great psychologists said\nsomething to the extent that um\naddictive behaviors thought patterns\nsubstances are humans attempts to murder\ntime so that they don't have to address\ntheir mortality yeah and that's always\nmade a lot of sense to me yeah we say\nkill time is our expression kill time\nthrough passive engagement but also kill\ntime through um trying to get\noverwhelmed or overtaken by an\nexperience or a substance as opposed to\nwhen you're truly connected you have\nthat sense of\nflow and 3 hours can pass by and you're\nnot even aware of it so time is a\ntotally subjective experience it can be\nextremely slow and tedious and you feel\nvery depressed or it can pass by but\nthat passes by without you even noticing\nit and it's a wondrous experience you\nknow when I'm deep in my writing I'm not\naware of the time passing I'm so\ninvolved I'm so immersed it's a deeply\ndeeply pleasurable experience of time it\nis Sublime and yeah so I agree with you\nI think your distinction is very\ninteresting you know I'm eagerly\nawaiting your your next book but we\nwon't rush you well I I I'm I'm so\nimmersed in it that I could I could talk\nfor hours because I also have a chapter\nin there about what I call the\ndayon which is like that voice inside of\nyou that speaks to you and I'm writing a\nwhole chapter about how Sublime that is\nwhen you connect to that voice so you\nare spoton there is something very much\nconnected to Mastery in this book but\nit's the next chapter that I'm writing\nfantastic can't wait I can't wait I'd\nlike to shift slightly to a topic that\nyou've written extensively about which\nis power um and not just power but also\nseduction which you've written\nextensively about and of course you've\nwritten about finding one's purpose so\ntell me if the framework that I've just\ngiven myself Liberty to create is an\naccurate one and if it's not I I'm\nhoping that um it's not in perhaps some\ninteresting ways so to me you talk about\nand we will talk about power as as a\nresource it's it's something that um\nit's there as a resource it could be\nused or not used um and I think of\nSeduction as one form of exchange\nbetween an individual so there's a verb\nassociated with seduction power I'm\nthinking of more as a noun in this\ncontext you're the word guy um and then\nyou know purpose is uh is really about\nfinding like to what end or ends one is\ngoing to um devote power seduction and\nthe other forces that allow human beings\nto interact with each other in the world\num but power as a resource that can be\nexpressed in different ways and accessed\nin different ways maybe we could just\nexplore that a little bit because you\nknow when we hear the word power I think\na lot of people kind of brace themselves\nlike here we go someone's going to try\nand have power over me this is about\nmanipulation and so on and so forth but\nI learned pretty early on that every\nevery career Endeavor there there are\npower dynamics there's Mentor mentee\nthey teachers and their students and\nboth have power um in inter in romantic\nrelationships there's a power exchange\nthere are yeses and their NOS there are\nmaybe there are um uh covert and overt\ncontracts yeah I'll do this because I\nwant to right you'll do this because you\nwant to great sounds great overt\ncontract they're also covert contracts\nwell I don't feel safe doing that so\nwhat I'll do is I'll take some something\non through from the interaction that\nyou're not aware of so that I can sort\nof um ease my sense of danger and make\ngive myself the illusion of feeling safe\nand all sorts of kind of complicated\nhuman dynamics that have to do with us\nhaving this forbrain thing that can do\nall of that gymnastics so maybe we could\nstart very simply by just saying you\nknow how would you define power in terms\nof its uh functional definition like in\nin in interpersonal relations and then\nwhy do you think\npower is so essential to all\nrelationships that's really what I'd\nlike to get to why is it so essential\nwhy couldn't it be something else well\nthe way I Define po is I try and take it\naway from that kind of negative context\nthat most people have and that you that\nyou brought up and I bring it to\nsomething very primitive and very Primal\nthe way the human being is wired the\nfeeling that we have no control over our\nenvironment and in the earliest period\nit was literally over our environment\nand wild animals and nature and and the\nclimate Etc but now the sense that you\nhave no control over your career over\nyour children over your parents is\ndeeply deeply am miserating and it\ncompels us to act in certain ways either\nattempts to find positive ways of power\nor doing what you call covert ways of\ngetting power you know passive\naggressive traditionally passive\naggressive means so it's deeply wired in\nUS to want a degree of control over the\nimmediate environment and immediate\nevents we can never have complete\ncontrol and the idea of having complete\ncontrol is nonsense and it would\nactually be very ugly because you want a\ndegree of Letting Go and letting\ncircumstances come to you etc\netc so the sense of you you you want to\nfeel like with other people and\nrelationships that you can influence\nthem that you can move them in a certain\ndirection either to get you to love you\nand treat you better or either to stop\nannoying irritating behaviors or either\nto you know wake up and and find and and\nand do productive activity if it's your\nchildren Etc you want to have the\nability to influence people to move them\nin a certain direction either in your\ninterest or in their interest right and\nonce you have that need and every single\nhuman being ever who's ever lived has\nthat need and we often don't Rec\nrecognize it because we're embarrassed\nby it we're embarrassed by our desire\nfor power for our need to control every\nhuman being has it right and it's not\neasy because human beings are\ncomplicated they don't if you say do\nthis and you're talking to your son\nhe'll do the opposite or he'll do\nsomething else you can't just force\npeople in a direction right by being\novert and telling them this is what you\nneed to do you create resentment you\ncreate an enemy they may they may say\nyes yes daddy yes husband I'll do what\nyou say but they're you they're they're\ngoing to resist you deep down inside\nright so people are tricky they wear\nmasks they pretend to say one thing and\nthey do another they have their egos and\nyou inadvertently wound their egos or\ntrip them in some way and they react in\na way that you don't expect and so power\nis this kind of invisible realm that\nenvelops Society where people are\ncontinually battling each other and\nstruggling in it but no one is like\ntalking about it no one's being overt\nabout it no one's saying this is exactly\nwhat I'm trying to do and so when you\nenter the social world in the career\nworld you're not expecting these battles\nyou don't know no one's taught you no\none's trained you your parents don't\ntrain you nobody trains you and you make\nmistakes and you realize how political\npeople are if you're a Sharky character\nand there there's a certain percentage\nof them you realize wow I can deceive\npeople I can manipulate them I can get\nwhat I want I can pretend to love them\nand they'll they'll fall for me and I\ncan do all this other stuff but for most\nof us the 95% of us who aren't sharks\nand I'm I'm including myself in that\ncategory it's it's it's very very\ndisturbing to suddenly enter that world\nand see all of that invisible power\ngames on that's no one's given you any\nadvice for helped you and so take it out\nof the realm of it's just about trying\nto dominate the world and manipulate and\nexploit and and abuse\nit's something inside of you you have\nthis need and your suppression of it\nwill only make you come out in passive\nways and you won't be able to control\ncertain things if you want to move\npeople if you want them to follow your\nideas if you want them to be more\naligned with your politics or your ideas\nyou have to be subtle you have to learn\npsychology you have to learn certain\naspects of how to almost move people\nwithout them realizing in in certain\ndirections which is like The Art of\nSeduction and if you're not interested\nin that if you're just going to tell\npeople what you think and what you're\ngoing to do that means you're not\ninterested in Practical action you're\nnot interested in results you're just\ninterested in inventing your own\nfrustrations or your own anger so\nlearning the subtle little dynamics of\npower is extremely essential because\nwe're a social animal it doesn't mean\nthat you're going to get dirty that\nyou're going to suddenly go out there\nand manipulate the out of people most of\nthe 48 Laws of Power is about defense\nbut how to defend yourself from the\nSharks about there how to defend\nyourself from making classic mistakes\nlike outshining the master like talking\ntoo much like arguing with people\ninstead of demonstrating your ideas on\nand on and on it's not an ugly thing it\nactually makes you a better social\nindividual so that's how I I like to\nframe it it's very interesting I I\nthink as a young guy growing up it was\nso important to me um to know where I\nfit in with my friend group um and I\ndidn't think of it so much as a\nhierarchy um nor when I was in my\nacademic studies did I think of it as a\nhierarchy even though it was clearly was\nright um so much as it the goal was to\nfigure out where was my unique slot that\nI could um do the most good for myself\nand others right of finding my spot um I\ndon't want to say on a shelf CU that\ngives an image of something vertical but\nyou know in the let's make it lateral a\nlateral arrangement of different people\nwith different strengths different life\npurposes trying to figure them out you\nknow where where should I be in order to\nexpress that and also feel connected to\nothers and um and in order to do that I\ndid have to I realize now based on your\nanswer I did have to figure out um you\nknow who's trying to have power over\nwho's pretending that they don't want\npower but is actually exerting power um\nyou know these sorts of things and\nthere's an incredible piece that comes\nfrom knowing that one is in the correct\nPlace both profession interpersonally in\nrelation to oneself but also in the\ncontext of one's peer peer group just\nkind of yeah this is where I belong\nbecause trying to gain power when one is\ntrying to move to a position that isn't\nright for them or in a way that isn't\nright for them just seems so\nenergetically costly yeah seems like a\nwaste of a life frankly right right you\nknow trying to gather resources simply\nto to have them to give the illusion of\npower but then being afraid of losing\nthem just sounds like a recipe for for\nmisery as you pointed out you know\nwhereas figuring out where am I most\npowerful in the benevolent sense of the\nword that that that seems like a good a\ngood Pursuit well it's connecting up to\nto Mastery again and finding your life's\npurpose you know I I I knew when I was\nyoung that I couldn't exert physical\npower\nbecause I was a skinny little runt and I\nwas I wasn't bullied but people would\nkind of pick on me etc etc so I veered\ntowards intellectual Pursuits where I\ncould have power and in the end you know\nyou might have been a jock and you might\nhave done well in high school but haha\nLook at me now I'm not saying that it's\na beautiful thing that that's but that's\npart of human nature the desire to\nactually you know prove yourself and\nfind that Niche that you that you belong\nto so you don't have that kind of hum\nthat sense of\ninferiority which Alfred Adler the\npsychologist describes very eloquently\nso a lot of it is kind of compensating\nwhen you're a child for things that are\nyour weaknesses and finding what you're\nso good at that you do have that power\nand people can't bully you right and you\nyou're you're like now a famous\nneuroscientist whereas they're like who\nknows what they're doing kind of thing\nso power definitely is connected in some\nway to that inner sense of what you were\nmeant to do and you feel it with the\nwith the ease and the connection that\ncomes from it right so I can honestly\nsay that my dislike of working for other\npeople and office politics and egos I\nnow have a of an existence where I don't\nhave to deal with any of that and I'm so\nblessed and I wake up every morning and\nI pray to God thank God I I found this\nbecause it's it's the perfect lifestyle\nfor me yeah you're are can be accurately\nDes described as an intellectual Beast\nso it's um and which is like a\ncompliment right um we hear the word\nbeast and we think uh you know a\nFerocious Beast trying to harm others\nbut I'm happy being a beast yeah you\nknow so I think finding where we can be\na beast you know and and for some people\nthat's painting or or gardening or\nwhatever it might be um I think is again\nties back to the these issues of or this\nquest of for\nMastery seduction is also a very loaded\nword right it's even more more uglier\nthan power because seduction right\nseduction kind of drips with uh the idea\nthat somebody is\ntricking someone else into doing\nsomething that they otherwise would not\nwant to do but seduction is both our\npropensity to do it and to have it done\nto us is hardwired into our nervous\nsystem and has a lot to do with the\nhypothalamus and a bunch of other areas\nthat I won't Bor us with the\nnomenclature but um sedu\nto me implies some sort of exchange I\nsuppose we could seduce ourselves\nthrough denial or convincing ourselves\nthat of of something but more often than\nnot when we talk about seduction we're\ntalking about an interaction between two\nor more people so um what are some of\nthe core principles of Seduction and and\nif you care to play um Anthropologist a\nbit um and a neuroscientist I I would\ninvite that why do you think we have\nneural circuits in our brain that allow\nus to seduce and be\nseduced well um I don't know how if if\nI'm if I'm being kind of an armchair\nintellectual here but my my theory is\nsome of it has to go back to social um\nevents long in our prehistory which have\nto do with\ntaboos and Society was initially kind of\norganized by a series of taboos right\nmost notably the taboo on incest and\nwhat happened is just not my theory it's\nthe theory of the malanowski malanowski\nis I pronounce it um that the moment a\ntaboo enters the human brain like you're\nnot supposed to sleep with this woman\nthe desire arises inside of you to\nactually sleep with that woman the the\nthe sense of no the sense that this is\nprohibited stirs the desire stirs the\ncontrary impulses in humans and we can\nbe very um what's the word perverse\ncreatures right so if you've ever tried\nto suppress a thought you realize that\nit keeps coming up keeps coming up you\ncan't suppress it don't think of an\nelephant Andrews whatever you do don't\nthink of an elephant you're thinking of\nit because you can't help it right the\nidea that you're not supposed to desire\nof this person stirs that actual desire\nso I believe the sense of something\nbeing taboo and transgressive is the\nultimate kind of origin of our desire\nfor seduction but seduction involves\nvulnerability it involves somebody gets\ninside somebody gets under our skin\nright and to do that we have to let them\nin so the person being seduced is in\nsome ways to a degree complicit because\nif you just put up a wall and you said\nno I I'm not going to be seduced nothing\nwill happen but you have a vulnerability\nyou're letting that person into your\npsyche Into Your Inner Space the\nParadigm for that is Early Childhood so\nFreud talks a lot about this so I don't\nknow if people still believe in Freud\nanymore I certainly do okay absolutely a\ngenius of both Psychology and Physiology\nwrong about a lot of things did a lot of\nthings he shouldn't have done I let's\nacknowledge that I think everyone would\nagree that sleeping with your patients\nand being a cocaine addict bad ideas but\nat the same time he had an absolute like\nnear Supernatural levels of insight and\nBrilliance into human nature he sleep\nwith his patience I believe he did um\nbut if I just if I just threw that on\nhim without him doing it then you know\nuh forgive me certainly had emotional\nattachments to his patients that he\nshouldn't have had I don't know if he\nslept with them he very well might have\nbut his idea was that the child is\nseduced by the parent you're in\nextremely vulnerable position right your\nlife depends on them and they're\nseducing you with their energy you're\nletting them in right and that kind of\ncreates a pattern for the rest of your\nlife and so for instance the feeling of\nbeing carried by your father and just\nbeing taken around physically is a form\nof Seduction because you don't know what\nhe's going to do to you you're very\nexcited you want that surprise right and\nto me it's related to the seduction of a\nstory stories are very seducing to us we\ndon't know where they're taking us we\ndon't know what the next chapter is what\ngoing to happen to this character or not\nthe surprise lowers our resistance and\nopens our mind up to what's going to\nhappen next is a form of Seduction fairy\ntales the stories you were reading as a\nchild your interactions with your\nparents they're deeply deeply ingrained\nin you you cannot be seduced unless you\nare vulnerable right and so I like to\nswitch it around and get out of the\nnegative connotations being vulnerable\nis actually a positive trait I think a\nlot of people now in the world today\nbecause things are so harsh and invasive\nthat people have become too\ninvulnerable they don't want to let\nanything in right and this now infects\ntheir relationships with other people\nthey don't want to be influenced they\nthey want to be strong inside of\nthemselves they're afraid of giving in\nto the other person of surrendering to\ntheir influence but it's actually a\ndelightful feeling to surrender to the\npower of another person and then reverse\nthat charge and have them surrender to\nyour power so when I'm reading a writer\nand sometimes uh they completely seduce\nme like friederick nich is one of my\nfavorite writers I let go of everything\nI let him enter my brain and I'm\ncompletely seduced I let him lead me\nalong but then I encounter writers that\nI don't like at all I I'll mention one\nyou know it's probably not a good thing\nbut step Pinker I don't like St St\nPinker I find him really annoying okay\num but I force myself to try and find a\nway to be seduced by him to let him into\nmy brain to see where he's coming from\nto open myself to the possibility that\nhe could be correct so vulnerability\nletting people into your mental space is\na form of intelligence it's a it's kind\nof an emotional and an intellectual\nintelligence and forgive me for\ninterrupting but I think it also implies\na level of confidence because empathy or\nallowing oneself to be vulnerable to the\npoint where you're seduced by something\num by\ndefinition if you're choosing to do it\nuh implies that you also have the\nconfidence that you can get back to\nyourself afterward right that you're not\ngoing to get lost in the circumstances\nyou're not going to be hijacked to the\npoint of no return right or in some way\nthat's detrimental to you so it it's um\nit I'm sound really nerdy here it's it's\ncinear with with confidence in many ways\nsure like take my mind\nand take it where you will because I\nknow I can come back at any time right\nright and the same thing in a physical s\nin a romantic sense right you're opening\nyourself up to the charm to the energy\nof the other person but if they start\ndisplaying dark energy and you see that\nthey're abusive or something is wrong\nyou have the ability to retreat ah well\nthere it gets tricky because very tricky\nwell because the attachment systems\nwhich are also rooted in childhood um\noften times can overwhelm one's ability\nto recover oneself like I mean so I mean\nhow many if I had a dollar for every\ntime someone in that I knew in my life\nsaying like you know I know they're bad\nfor me but I just can't like we just\ncan't seem to disengage like that you\nhear about that all the time I mean you\nsee court cases about this that are\npublic and you know you just go why\ndidn't they just walk away from one\nanother well because once those\nattachment systems are locked in it\nalmost becomes in a and here\nmetaphorically speaking like a parent\nchild relationship like you can't\nsuddenly decide your parents weren't\nyour parents simply because you know\nbetter now right you are forever\nstricken with the reality that they were\nand they had an influence and I think\nthat that attachment system is um is a\nis a force that tugs pretty hard yeah\nand um a lot of women have written to me\nsince the Art of Seduction sort of\nsaying that their boyfriend or husband\nwas applying some of these tactics on\nthem and it was very painful and they\nwere kind of a little bit angry at me\nfor for it but then they kind of\nrealized that they it wasn't they didn't\nlearn it really from my book it was\nalready kind of wired in them but that\nreading about these tactics and these\nstrategies actually helped them to\nrecognize what their husband or\nboyfriend was doing to them the\nmanipulation and the games that were\nbeing played do men write to you and\ntalk about the seductive adornments that\nwomen have used to to um bring them into\nrelationship as well or are you\ntypically hearing from women I mostly\nhear from women complaining about men\nand and and how they've abused them and\nhow they used\nsome of these some of the strategies I I\ndon't deny have a slightly nefarious\nEdge to them because I didn't want to\nwrite a book about Seduction That\ndoesn't have that taboo element because\nI say seduction involves the taboo and I\ndidn't want to I didn't want to censor\nmyself but female to male seduction\nclearly also exists less of I\nacknowledge that it's um less often is\nit physically abusive um but right I\nmean from an early age both boys and\ngirls men and women are coached by\nSociety on the sorts of uh seductive\ntactics and and adornments right I mean\neverything from makeup perfume\nhairstyles cars watches jewelry um\nexpression power displays of any kind um\nI mean that stuff the world's filled\nwith that stuff yeah but men are\ngenerally kind of happy when a woman\nseduces them right they're unless\nthey're after their money or something\nlike that which happens but generally\nthe sense you know I talk about this in\nin the first chapter about which I could\nsay is the quintessential archetype of\nthe female seductress the the kind of\nhalf human half bird creature on a rock\nsinging so beautifully that you have to\njump in the water and then they kill you\nand so the idea is that men want to let\ngo because men have to be so in control\nso powerful they have to project this\nimage they have a secret desire to let\ngo and be almost dominated by a very\npowerful woman a lot of men have that\nand I talk about some of the most\npowerful men in in history Julius Caesar\nMark Anthony um Joe dagio who all these\nmen very masculine men who've fallen for\nvery feminine siren likee women and been\ncompletely dominated by them and they\nactually kind of enjoy the process\nbecause it's like a sense of I can let\ngo I can enter this totally s sensual\nphysical world and it it's extremely\npleasing it's like another realm outside\nof my kind of cold mascul\nworld you know so I don't really get men\ncomplaining too much about women who've\nseduced them honestly it's usually the\nother way\naround I'd like to take a quick break\nand thank our sponsor insid tracker\ninsid tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform

have heard\nelsewhere the my friend asked me to ask\nsort of question that in all sexual\nexchanges there's a power exchange\ndefinitely um maybe you could elaborate\non that um because as you were\ndescribing some of the seductive power\ndynamics that ex IST a phrase that I've\nheard before uh came to mind um that at\nfirst made me chuckle but then made me\nthink um quite deeply about this issue\nof the relationship between sexual and\npower dynamics which is this notion of\ntopping from the bottom you know if one\nis giving someone else the impression\nthat they are more powerful by virtue of\nthe word giving they actually hold some\npower right power is can be given or\ntaken but um often times uh seductive\nexchanges and sexual exch exchanges and\nromantic exchanges in particular are\nabout both people\nuh buying into a ill a temporary\nillusion let's pretend that you're in\ncharge when actually I'm in charge okay\nbut I know that you think that you're in\ncharge okay let's just pretend none of\nthat exists and just do X right and I\nthink this is another example of covert\ncontracts and it's one that actually can\npotentially create a lot of problems\npost Hawk right um but I think the\nrelationship between sex romance and\npower is an important area to explore in\nthe context of this well I wrote The Art\nof Seduction with the idea that it was\nan art invented by women it was invented\nby women who had no power essentially\nsocially politically in any sense of the\nword in in in domestically\nright and but the one power that they\ncould that they could wield over a man\nwas through sex\nsome physical attraction and so they\ndevelop this art of kind of luring a man\ninto their world through various\ntheatrical effects Cleopatra being kind\nof the archetype of this and then luring\nthe the powerful man into this world he\nhas the illusion that he's the one\npursuing her but in fact she is the one\ncontrolling the dynamic so often times\nthe person who appears to be the weaker\none in the relationship who's not doing\nthe pursuing is actually inviting the\npursuing is actually leading the other\nperson on so there's a lot of kind of\nappearance games going on and you can\nnever really figure out who exactly is\nin control of the dynamic because one\nperson is\nlike allowing the other person to lead\nthem on but the fact that you're\nallowing them is a degree of power is a\ndegree of control right so it's very\nhard to figure out and sex and power and\nromantic relationships are very much\nintertwined in US physically emotionally\nneurologically you can't avoid it right\nand so I think it's kind of dishonest to\nsay that that none of that exists that\nit's like that there's some egalitarian\nParadise out of there when it it's\nreally not wired in us for that kind of\nrelationship there's a recent scientific\npublication SL factoid that I want to\nshare with you in this context because\nI'd like your thoughts on it uh David\nAnderson who's a phenomenal\nneurobiologist he's been a guest on this\npodcast before he's a professor at\nCaltech studies um basically the\nfunctions of the hypothalamus so okay\nthings like uh aggression mating and and\nthings of that sort um and does it so it\nin with great detail he's a virtuoso of\nthe hypothalamus and he published a\npaper two years ago showing that indeed\nthere are neural circuits in the brain\nof animals and presumably in humans as\nwell that control sexual mounting\nBehavior but that there is actually a\nseparate circuit for\npurely nonsexual mounting and physical\npower over that's expressed in animals\nand anyone that's ever owned a dog and\ngone to the dog park will see same-sex\nmounting between dogs or mounting\nbetween dogs that has apparently um no\nsexual end point yeah and in exploring\nthis lit and some talking to David about\nit it's very clear that there are neural\ncircuits um that have everything to do\nwith essentially one animal of a species\ngetting on top of the other animal\nusually from behind often times\nscruffing or biting the back of the neck\nand saying I control you it's a it's\noften done in a playful context\nespecially between animals not always\naggressive but there's a certain element\nof aggressive to it but essentially says\nI decide whether or not you are mobile\nor not for this moment and that it and\nthis is very important I want to\nemphasize this this is a circuit that is\nentirely separate from all of the\nreflexes associated with sexual behavior\nin males and females I find this to be\nfascinating um and because we hear about\npower over right and we hear about power\nand we think about physical power over\nbut the idea that something as primitive\nas mounting just like something as\nprimitive as biting or as\nstriking has its own unique set of\ncircuits in the brain I think\nsubstantiates every everything that you\nput in uh in your books about power and\nmaybe even seduction as well so as I\njust kind of toss that out there for\nconsideration I I I wonder um if you\nhave any Reflections on it if not um\nfeel free to just say I don't but of\ncourse but to me this was a really\nimportant Discovery because I think\neveryone looks at mounting behavior and\nsays oh that has to be sexual and\nsometimes it's oh I see what you mean\nbut but it's not that there's a there\nseem to be a host of neural circuits in\nthe brain that are are really about\ndefining who's on top literally that has\nnothing to do with\nsex yeah I'm sure that's true I've never\nI've never I've never um read anything\nabout that but I can say that um I wrote\na chapter in in my new book about love\nand that's a different thing than than\nseduction and I was trying to come up\nwith an idea of love that does have an\nelement of equality that doesn't have\nthis power dynamic going on in it I love\nthat and um you know kind of like the\nantithesis of my Art of Seduction where\nI'm almost contradicting myself and I\nwas going into the into the biology of\nit and even into the physics of it so\nthere is a famous uh French biologist\nwhose Name Escapes me I'm sorry I can't\nremember from the 20s and 30s um and he\nwas studying\nparium and he found he was studying them\nyou know they they're in these ponds Etc\nand he said that there was these moments\nwhere these single celled organisms were\nsuddenly coupling they were all joining\ntogether just one to one and they were\nabsorbing the membrane of one inside the\nother and then they would like go and\nthen once one couple did that all the\nparium started joining up together then\nthey would sink to the bottom of the\npond and parium don't reproduce through\nsex they reproduce through dividing\nthemselves right self\nreproduction and so he was saying that\nthe desire to couple to to to connect to\nsomeone so deeply where you absorb one\nis absorbed in the other is biologically\nwired into US goes back millions and\nmillions and millions of years and it's\na desire essentially a biological desire\nfor love right and it's an energy that\npermeates all all the it's it's not just\nabout power and hierarchy\nand that he was showing other creatures\nthat had something similar going on and\nyou know in physics we talk about\nentanglement and we also talk about um\nyou know matter if matter isn't absor\nisn't um opposed by a lot of kinetic\nenergy it joins together I mean\nparticles join together to form matter\netc etc so there's something in the\nuniverse that's trying to connect things\nto each other so there's this this kind\nof energy that exists in the world where\nwe have a deep need to connect to\nsomebody with outside of those power\ndynamics right where there's a degree of\nequality where we're drawn to each other\nand we let go of the ego games we let go\nof the playing we kind of surmount our\nown physiology our own\nhypothalamus and we engage in this I\ncall it love Sublime and it involves the\nphysical part the sexual part is the\ntrigger for it because when you have sex\nwith someone your body is suddenly\npermeable to their energy in a way that\nyou cannot control it releases all kinds\nof of chemicals in the brain that are\nvery powerful and oftentimes that sense\nis too powerful and you react and you're\nafraid of it and you pull back but if\nyou don't react and you go further then\nthe mind also becomes permeable to the\nother person and their energy and their\ndesire and so then\nit kind of creates a spiraling effect\nwhere the physical and the mental\nconnection reaches this state that I\ncall love Sublime now it's an ideal it\ndoesn't really exist that much out there\nin the world today but there are stories\nin history that illustrate it and I\nbelieve that is a biological necessity\nfor us to feel a deep deep sense of\nconnection we normally ascribe that to\nreligion to God Etc but I maintain the\nessence of love the model for for love\nis between two human beings straight or\nhomosexual doesn't matter and that\nfeeling of surmounting our own neurology\nour own system and and entering this\nzone is deeply deeply satisfying we all\nwant it and it has to involve letting go\nof the power dynamics letting and\neverything being equal it's not that the\nother person is exactly like you you\nrecognize their difference but but as\nfar as being worthy of attention being\nworthy and\nrespected you leave all that other stuff\noutside so there is a Zone that's\npossible that's outside this power denam\nthat we're talking about I'm excited\nthat you're writing about this uh so\nthis is for your next book yeah I'm very\nexcited I couldn't help but think of\nsome of the parallels between what you\ndescribe and what we're observing\nnowadays in the landscape of politics\nand social dynamics where clearly um\nthey is no setting aside of egos people\nfeel both sides feel attacked everyone\nin between feels confused like why do I\nhave to pick aide um and there seems to\nbe no hint of a future where people are\nsetting down their swords it which means\nif we were to go with your earlier\ndefinition which I like a lot that um\nnobody feels safe enough to be\nvulnerable enough to um to allow the\nunion of of people to occur which is\njust a way a way of rewarding you know a\nbunch of other things um and not nearly\nas eloquently as as you described it but\nif setting aside of power dynamics and\nmaking oneself vulnerable is is the key\nto accessing love in the Romantic\ncontext surely but also in the um\nsocietal context I mean what are the\nchannels for that I mean I suppose there\nis the argument not mine that everyone\nshould just take a boatload of\npsychedelics and see the\ninterconnectedness of things but that\nseems like an realistic route I I just\ndon't see that being you know um you\nknow 12th grade graduation um curriculum\num nor do I think it would be healthy I\nto be clear I think that you we'd end up\nwith a lot of expression of of problems\nthere um but short of a magic substance\nthat could increase feelings of uh\nconnectedness among everyone\nsimultaneously um how are you going to\nsave Humanity Robert well um because I'm\nI'm concerned about young people in\nparticular with hookup culture with\npornography etc etc it's kind of\nrewiring the human brain and we're\nlosing what I was just describing and I\nsee aot particularly a lot of young\npeople and I don't blame them because\nthey've grown up in a world that's very\nchaotic and very hostile could could I\nsay I think it's um and not to be\nnitpicky here but I I love what you just\nsaid I think in my mind it's hi things\nlike that are hijacking the hard wirring\nof the brain okay um and I'm just I'm\nagain forgive me my the audience is\nprobably going can't really rewire the\nbrain like that so well I think we can\nexpand and rewire Upon Our hard wiring\nbut so much of what you you talk about\nin your books is about finding one's\nEssence but then also what I love about\nyour books so much among many other\nthings is that it's about that dance\nbetween the hard wiring and and the\npossible of through effort so anyway\nforgive me for for being it's very\naccurate so yeah what how do you get us\nout of this well you're putting a big\nburden on me I am but I think you're up\nto it you know um well I try to do it in\nthis chapter because I wanted to seduce\nthe reader into the idea that this is\nsomething extremely pleasurable and\nextremely healthy and the feeling of\nbeing vulnerable is a very positive\nattribute that will infect not just your\nromantic relationships but will infect\nyou mentally so creative people are\nextremely vulnerable they're extremely\nvulnerable to ideas they're extremely\nvulnerable to the environment and\nclosing yourself off into your own ego\ninto yourself so the chapter is called\nEscape the Prison of the egoo and you're\nyou're kind of trapped inside of\nyourself and your own thoughts and your\nown desires and it's like a prison it's\nenclosing you and you want to escape\nsomehow and you escape through drugs you\nescape through porn but it doesn't lead\nto actually escaping you want to be able\nto let go of the self and get out of\nthis this prison that you're in right\nand so it's a desire that that we all\nhave and so I wanted to frame it as this\nincredibly positive Dynamic that you can\nengage in and the ability to be\nvulnerable to other people to open\nyourself up and to say that yeah they\nmight hurt me but I'm strong enough to\ntake it and if they hurt me I'll learn\nfrom it and I'll rebound and I know\nthat's a bit naive on my part but I want\nyou to at least have that feeling\nbecause a lot of young people write to\nme and they say I I can't fall in love\nanymore I can't I don't like that\nfeeling I it makes the loss of control\nis too much you know and and a lot of\nthat their behavior patterns are in\ncreating this sense of control which you\ncan have when you're locked inside of\nyourself uh hence over indulgence in\npornography yeah and masturbation\nEtc as a way to avoid the you know the\nunderstandable fear about inter\nrelational Dynamics yeah yeah so you\nknow when you're young you're you're\nidealistic at least a lot of young\npeople are and you have these dreams and\nthese hopes and to let go of this\npossibility which is deeply pleasurable\nand deeply therapeutic to the human\nanimal as a social animal it's like the\nhighest form of interaction that we can\nhave so my strategy in that chapter was\nto paint such a wonderful portrayal of\nthe pleasures that are awaiting You by\nletting go of your defenses of letting\ngo of all of your natural resistance\nfactors and opening yourself up to other\npeople is is a key to not just a\nromantic relationship but to Career\nSuccess to mental energy to creativity\nto being open in general right and\nso I don't think I could have a a wi you\nknow a huge impact but we'll see when\nthe when the book comes out but I'm\nadvocating that sense of open opening\nyourself up to the universe to the\ncosmos itself as an energy that\npermeates the world and so that you\ndon't want to the feeling of being\nclosed inside of your ego inside of your\nyourself I want to make it so you feel\nthe pain of that because you don't\nreally feel the pain of it you feel like\nit's comfortable for you but I want to\nmake it clearity that it's not\ncomfortable it's deeply deeply painful\nand it's disconnecting you from some of\nthe best experiences you can have in\nlife so I have that strategy the only\nother hope I have is in the human Spirit\nitself so a lot of this is being caused\nby social media I believe right um and\nuh and the instant and the the kind of\nimmediate gratification we can get in so\nmany ways and my hope is that young\npeople get fed up and get dis disgusted\nwith all this disconnection an\nalienation in their life and that they\nhunger from actually something more\ncommunal more interactive more real as\nopposed to Virtual and so that the human\nSpirit can't be completely squashed by\ntechnology Etc so I have that hope\nbecause we've gone through these Cycles\nbefore in history where people have\nbecome very invulnerable and very locked\nand closed and suddenly there's an\nexplosion a creative explosion like in\nthe 1960s like in the 1920s like in 18th\ncentury Europe with the Casanova and the\nwhere seduction reached its kind of apy\nEtc so it has kind of swung back and\nforth between these moments where humans\nget incredibly closed and bitter and\npartisan and everything's conflict and\neveryone's divisive Etc and suddenly\ngoes in the opposite\ndirection I I have hope in that\npossibility and I structured my chapter\nto perhaps sweep that a little bit along\nthat tie and see if I can have any\neffect well I think what you just\ndescribed in conversations like it and\nthat stem from it are likely to have a\ntremendous effect I think it's exactly\nwhat's needed now and um certainly I'll\nbe uh to amplify that message I I agree\nwith everything you said and not just\nbecause you're sitting here as a guest\nuh on this podcast but because um it's\nclear to me that while power dynamics\nand seduction are um wired into our\nhuman relations since the beginning of\ntime that we have reached a a very\nchallenging period in our history um\nit's somewhat of a relief to me to know\nthat it's happened before but in a very\ndifferent context uh we hear a lot about\nThe Swinging back and forth of the\npendulum uh someone in fact uh Peter\nAtia online Physician's brother actually\nsaid I um so we'll credit him he said no\nit's not a it's not a pendulum that\nswings back and forth unfortunately now\nit's become a wrecking ball so it's\nswinging back and forth and doing damage\nas it as it reaches its um you know it's\nextremes and I think that um I also look\nforward to a time where people\num acknowledge the the injustices around\nthem and and that have been done to them\nand others and um but somehow are able\nto transcend that and the word that I'd\nlike to pick up on there is the word\njustice um it was pointed out to me uh\nby someone I respect very much that you\nknow having a sense of justice is a is a\nwonderful and important thing and as\nhumans it's important to how we\nstructure Society but I do think that\nthat a lot of the negative things that\nwe see out there nowadays are have\nsomething to do with the availability of\nuh ready availability of pornography\nhigh density calorie food Etc a bunch of\nthings like that but that one of the\nissues with social media because it does\nhave its positive aspects but one of the\nnegative issues in my mind is that it's\na steady flow of um examples of\nInjustice so all day long you're just\nseeing things like that that piss you\noff and that piss other people off and\nfor different reasons but but what was\npointed out to me is that one of the key\nthings about a sense of Injustice is to\nbe able to determine whether or not\nthere's anything that you should do\nabout it and I think that everyone now\nfeels a bit hijacked by all the\ninjustices we see because we feel like\nwell we're supposed to do something\nabout it but it may be that while we\ncan't let every Injustice pass that\nbeing bombarded all day long with things\nthat upset us is hijacking our\ncreativity it's distracting us from our\ndeeper purpose it's preventing a sense\nof vulnerability that would lead to a\nsense of deep love and on and on so I\ndon't think it's just about the The Lure\nthe tantalizing lures of of sex food and\num and looking at you know bodies and\nhearing voices on social media I think\nthere is some validity to that but that\nit's also that you know there's just\nample opportunity to go down the\ngravitational pole forces of Injustice\nlike H that's so frustrating why are\nthey doing that I mean I catch myself\ndoing that talking to co-workers when I\nwalk in about did you see this thing\nthis is crazy what's going on with it\nthey're crazy when you know as opposed\nto thinking about anything else in that\nmoment and I try and yank myself out of\nthat but I I think that um you're not\ngoing to do it alone but I think you\nwill play a major role in saving us from\nthis because people I do I think because\npeople just need to see themselves\nthrough a different lens and realize\nthis is distracting me from who I'm\nsupposed to be well a lot of what what\nmodern life should involve is the\nability to ignore certain things so for\ninstance since I don't know if you know\nthat app next door oh right I used to\nhave it but then I'd see all the the\npackages being stolen off my neighbor's\nporches in Oakland and then I started\nenjoying living in Oakland less and I\nlove the city of Oakland it's got its\nproblems it definely has its problems\nbut as an East Bay kid you know and went\nto school out there and you know like I\nhave deep love for the East Bay and it\nit's always had those problems but when\nyou see stuff being stolen on your phone\nin the middle of the night when you wake\nup it creates a sense that like they're\nout to get my stuff it's terrible right\nand so uh I have it in my spam filter\nbut I look at it and and every headline\nis people stealing somebody broke into\nsomebody's house this P dog bit me this\nthis rapid dog going around there's this\nhomeless person that's yelling and\nattacking people on and on and on I feel\nlike I'm living in this neighborhood\nit's like Beirut or something in the\n1980s I can't even walk out my door I\njust got I don't look at next door\nanymore I just ignore it I don't open it\never because I know that that they're\ndesigned algorithmically to put that in\nfront of you every single time so that\nyou click on it because that's we\nrespond to that kind of stuff naturally\nwe can't help it so you have to be able\nto shut that stuff up and look at what\nyou can actually control in your life so\nI have this visceral dislike of what's\ngoing on in Ukraine because I was in\nUkraine recently and I feel I've\nidentified very strongly with their\nstruggle right and it just I can't that\noutrage feeling it just every time I\nread an article about it it just drives\nme crazy so the only thing is I stop\nreading as much as I can I read things\nthat are kind of rational and\nintelligent and I send the money and I\nyou know I donate as much as I can and I\nhelp them practically but I don't allow\nmyself to get that kind of outraged\nfeeling all of the time so somebody has\nto write a book somebody has to instruct\nus and what to ignore and what to\nactually pay attention to so there are\nthings that you can control\ninjustices that are out there that you\ncould control by voting by certain by\namassing a movement by you know dealing\nwith climate change not by trying to\nrecycle every little thing in your house\nbut actually doing something really much\nmore macro in the world you know joining\na cause there are things you can do and\nthat's positive and that's a way of\nchanneling that kind of dark energy in\nyou for a positive purpose but it's\ntotally disruptive and it totally\ndistracts you and weakens you and drains\nyou of energy to fall into those rabbit\nholes and let them and let yourself fall\ninto them so you have to learn the art\nof what to ignore and what not to pay\nattention to and understand that you're\nwired to see those kind of red alert\nbuttons on Facebook or on next door\nwherever they are and it it's just it's\nit's it's negative it's like a candy\nrush and you have to avoid it and it's\ntaking us away from our purpose which we\neach have I mean I think to me that's\nthe the most um delerious aspect unless\nunless your purpose is to organize and\nbe an activist people ask me I wrote a\nlot about in my human nature book about\nthe shadow side of human nature right\nand we all have it we all have a dark\nside we all have hidden aggression we\nall have feelings of Envy we all have\nfeelings of grandiosity we all have\naggressive impulses how do you deal with\nit and I say the way to deal is to\nchannel it into something positive and\npro-social and that could be putting it\nin your artwork venting that anger and\nthat outrage and something that people\nkind of can identify with or it can be\nan organizing something that could be\nyour purpose in life and actually doing\nsomething positive so that's the only\nway that you could actually use that\nenergy for some kind of actual life's\ntask or purpose you've been discussing\ning lately a bit on some of your\nchannels about masculine and feminine um\nlet's say roles um and crisis of the\nmasculine feminine dance as well as the\ncrisis of masculinity per se the crisis\nof femininity per se um do you care to\nexpand on that a bit I think um we could\nprobably take three four hours to\nexplore all this in full um but I was\nstruck by some of the things that you\nsaid um because I agree completely that\num just as we are not given a road map\nWhen we arrive in the world as to how to\nfind our purpose I think there's also a\nvery conflicted road map that's thrown\nin front of us and indeed conflicting\nmultiple road maps about what it means\nto be masculine or feminine or some\ncombination of both which of course\neverybody is some combination of both\njust to varying degrees well um yeah so\nmen have a feminine side to them which\nif you try to repress it will come out\nin other ways and women have a masculine\nside to them I think Yung describe this\nvery well with the anima and the Animus\nwhich I think is is extremely\nreal um it's very very confusing times\nfor both men and for women right now we\ndon't know the roles that there there're\neverything is just so fluid and it's\nvery very difficult particularly if\nyou're young so young women are getting\nthis idea that everything should be\nequal and that women should have and of\ncourse it's right should have be paid\nthe same and should have the same career\nopportunities there should be no\nPrejudice or harassment or anything but\nat the same time on social media it's\nall about looking perfect and looks are\nare incredibly important and if you're\nnot hot you're in terrible trouble and a\nlot of young girls are extremely\nconfused by this they're getting mixed\nsignals right and boys are even in\nperhaps even worse circumstances where\nbeing masculine is seen as something\nnegative so we don't have any ideals out\nthere anymore of what what\nconstitutes a good positive form of\nfemininity and a good positive form of\nmasculinity in fact we even think that\nthere shouldn't be anything like that\nthere's no such thing as being masculine\nor feminine whatever it's very very\nconfusing and so you know I I think of\nof of masculine traits that I think are\nvery positive and that should be out\nthere to kind of counteract the sort of\nAndrew Tate seduction that a lot of\nyoung men are falling for and it's a\nkind of an inner strength where you're\nsort of in control of your emotions\nyou're not invulnerable etc etc but um\nyou can take\ncriticism you can take PE you you know\nyou can have moments of failure and\nyou'll bounce back but you have a kind\nof res inner resilience and a kind of\ninner strength a kind of a quiet calm\nthat I think used to be exemplified in\nmovie icons like a Gary Cooper type\nthing right and that kind of sense of\ninner calmness where you're not\nhysterical you're not getting upset\nabout everything that happens where you\nhave a kind of an inner strength and a\nconfidence and you can withstand kind of\nwhat Ryan holiday talks about a lot\nabout with stoicism you can withstand\nall of the hardships in life but you\nhave that Citadel Within you is a very\nvery powerful form of masculinity as\nopposed to it's all about sleeping with\na lot of women having really fast cars\nyou know being abusive and being a bully\netc etc these are signs of weakness of\ninsecurity and to be masculine should be\na sense of security and inner confidence\nand Inner Strength right and that's what\nwe should venerate in our culture and we\nshould have icons like that okay um it\ndoesn't mean that that there's no role\nfor men who are not masculine or have\nmore of the feminine virtues that's also\nthere's definitely a role for that and\nyou know we see a lot of that in all\nsorts of Arenas of life and then there\nshould be a positive model for women you\nknow where instead of their appearances\nbeing judged by their appearances and\nhaving to conform to ideals of what's\nhot or not it's about being incredibly\npowerful and comp ident and and have\nexpertise and being really successful in\nyour career and and as opposed to being\ncontinually judged by your appearances\nwhich is very damaging\nso these are terrible times I mean I I\nfeel fortunate that I grew up in a time\nwhere there were these kind of models\nfor me to go by and I think of my father\nwho who was a very quiet man and he was\nhe was just a middle class s salesman is\nbasically what he was he just sold for\nall his whole life he sold chemical\nsupplies for one company um but he was\nvery dignified he treated people well he\nwas very calm and very quiet but he also\nwas very empathetic that was my role\nmodel for what I think is a good\nmasculine energy and I think a lot of\npeople just don't have that and they're\nvery lost and so I don't know what the\nanswer is to that I can't really produce\nthat out of thin air but I wish I could\nwell certainly nowadays there are many\nmore um let's say examples and options\nof masculine and feminine qualities out\nthere for observation because of social\nmedia and because of the internet uh and\nas you point out before a key feature to\nbecoming a functional human being\nespecially nowadays is learning what to\nignore I mean there's an interesting\nidea in the circles around nutrition and\nhealth that you know never before in\nhuman history have human beings been\nable to access such a wide variety of\nfoods that are differ from what their\nancestors ate and I don't even mean\nancient ancestors I mean if you grew up\nin the Bay Area as I did in the 1970s\nand 80s there were few ethnic\nrestaurants but we ate the same you know\n15 or 20 Foods over and over again right\nand then eventually that exploded into\ndozens of options and more and fusion\nfoods and all sorts of things and so\nthere is this idea in the nutrition\ncommunities that we are not hardwired to\num think about and discern so many\ndifferent food options that you know\nthat's um and to taste so many distinct\nflavors whereas before people one\nportion of the planet or country ate\ngenerally one way in a given season if\nthere's seasonality etc etc in a similar\nvein um we are now and children too are\nnow um overwhelmed with a number of\ndifferent options of how to express\noneself both masculinity and femininity\nbut generally speaking and so the\nquestion is then how does one choose\nright how does one decide what's what's\nfunctional what works what's best what's\nme right everyone asking themselves who\nam I right I think all teenagers I find\nthis fascinating ask themselves who am I\nadults don't tend to ask themselves that\nquestion but who am I I still ask myself\nquestion okay well that's good maybe I\nshould ask myself that more often but um\nI think\nthat we clearly have gone over a cliff\nwith this stuff I don't think we're\nstill at the point where we're kind of\nveering towards the edge of of confusion\nI think young people are really confused\nbecause the moment one assumes uh one\nclear and let's say balanced Mas set of\nmasculine feminine attributes or maybe\nve a bit more masculine or a bit more\nfeminine it's like um there are a\nmillion examples telling you that that's\nwrong I know and then sometimes has the\ntendency to Anchor to well no no I'm\nright because this is this is who I am\nand then all of a sudden you're you're\nin a larger battle so uh you know Gary\nCooper's great love his movies um but\nwe're like we now have a million\nvariations on Gary Cooper um that don't\nlook anything like the Gary Cooper you\nand I are talking about and a lot of\npeople won't even know who we're talking\nabout but I know\nthey I'm a dinosaur but perhaps it\nillustrates the point no not that you're\na dinosaur but that um there is no\nsingle or even um set of masculine or\nfeminine ideals so picking Role Models\nis something that I really truly\ninternalized from your book Mastery yeah\nyou know I there were a lot of lonely\nyears for me and I won't get into the\nstories of just wondering like my what\nam I going to do you know I'm 13 my home\nwas completely broken no semblance of\nthe reality it was before you know who\nare the the males in my life I'm going\nto orient to and fortunately for me I\nassigned mentors to me whether or not\nthey knew it or not that really helped\nme along and I changed them up as you\nrecommend there wasn't one um I\nunderstood there was a breaking up\nprocess an integration process combined\nining and threading together different\nthings I think I truly believe that\nthat's what's required that um it\ndoesn't have to be 100% Gary Cooper it\ncan be 10% Robert Green 10% someone else\nyou know 5% this and creating a pie\nchart of sorts of you know who one\nwishes to be in a given context but that\ntakes work it takes a bit of work and\ndiscernment but gosh that's powerful um\nand really credit goes to you because I\nyou know you were a mentor of mine you\ndidn't even realize it in the way that\nyou forge and organize information and\nthere were others and but Mastery is\nwhere I learned to do that and this is\nnot a podcast it's a a sales pitch for\nMastery but gosh it really taught me\nokay I have a graduate adviser she was\nwonderful and Brilliant but she didn't\nknow how to explain a lot of things to\nme so I'd find someone else for that\nright and someone else for the other\nthing and someone else for the other\nthing and together create a patchwork of\nof really excellent mentors that made a\nlot of sense to me yeah yeah so I I\nthink there's a a role for that process\nthat you spell out in Mastery in the\nlarger context of like could have become\nas a person and that includes masculine\nand feminine ideals yeah and and it's an\nongoing process throughout your life so\nwho you glommed on to when you were 14\nor 15 will change when you're 19 I had a\nseries of people like you're talking\nabout my high school English teacher who\nhad an enormous impact on me who taught\nme basically how to write I internalized\nhis voice when went to Berkeley I had a\nprofessor there who became my kind of\nsurrogate father at Berkeley who I\ndeeply admired for his level of\nscholarship so he became kind of an\nintellectual role model later in life\nwhen I finally wrote my first book I met\na man steers who was a book packager who\nunderstood the business Etc he kind of\nsaved me he was sort of my mentor for\nthe next phase in my life so on and on\nand on I found people but they have\npositive qualities qualities they admire\nthey're not perfect everyone is\nflawed and so at some point maybe you\nsee too many of the flaws you go on I\nneed somebody new in my life but there's\nnothing wrong with that it's not like\nyou're you're you're violating any codes\nor hurting them you move on to somebody\nelse but the sense of finding people\nwhose qualities you admire we don't\nlearn from people just by following\ntheir ideas we pick up their energy\ntheir Spirit now you didn't necessarily\npick up my energy or Spirit from Reading\nMaster although maybe you did I don't\nknow but when you're interacting with\nthat professor at Stanford or whatever\nit's not just verbally there's kind of a\nnon-verbal communication going on you're\ninternalizing some of the positive\nqualities that you saw in them and\nfinding these series of mentors because\nI call it surrogate\nparents you can't choose your father and\nmother but you can choose these ideals\nfor you can choose these mentor towards\nin your life you can kind of rewrite\nyour family history and find that Father\nFigure You Never Had by glomming onto\nthis person but it has to be the right\nfit it has to be someone that you\nconnect to emotionally and\nintellectually and that has the positive\nqualities you wish for yourself well\nI'll embarrass you perhaps by saying\nthat um since I was a freshman in\ncollege which is really when I turned my\nacademic life around and really my life\naround I've maintained the same notebook\nwith a list of names of people that I\nadmire and who I'm um you know trying to\nemulate in some way not in every way\ncertainly and certain names have been\ncrossed off but um most of them have\nsurvived and and certainly after reading\nMastery your name made that list and um\nand I hope I'm not being crossed off at\nsome point no not at all not not at all\nand through Reading Mastery there were\nthere were additional names um you know\nI had the great the great Misfortune of\nhaving all three of my academic advisers\ndie suicide cancer cancer which sounds\ntragic the the joke in my field is you\ndon't want me to work for you that's\nwhat that's what everyone says but by\nbeing essentially scientifically\norphaned because there's a strong Mentor\nmentee relationship in science and\nprogression through the career uh track\nit forced me to go out and find other\npeople and also to learn how to quote\nunquote mother and father myself in the\ncontext of profession and I got a lot of\nhelp but um I I can't emphasize enough\nhow valuable that practice is and so\nwhen one looks out on the landscape of\nsocial media options I mean these are\nliterally just options of people to you\nknow we call it following but um you\nknow it probably should be called\nsomething else uh because following you\nknow it fall short of emulating or\nattempting to emulate but I think that\nin the context of masculine and feminine\nideals this is so critical but it's like\nthe buffet of food is so enormous now\nright I mean you've got every cuisine on\nthe table so we're we're not wired for\nthat no and I know personally I I get\nvery agitated and upset if I go to the\nmarket and I have to choose between 30\nitems and I have no idea what I want it\nmakes me really cranky and upset whereas\nif I know okay I can have this food I\ncan't have that I'm only looking for\nthis okay it's easy it doesn't take two\nhours and waste my time too much choice\nis very detrimental to the human being I\nthink and that's why going back to what\nI originally said when you have that\nsense of purpose about your life about\nwhat's important it does just infects\nyour career but it infects every\neverything you do so you know eating\nthis food is going to drain me of my\nenergy that I need to create this thing\nthat means so much to me and energy and\nfeeling my my brain active and alive is\nincredibly important value all right I'm\nnot going to eat all that Sugar because\nit's bad for me right it means I'm not\ngoing to get outraged by these things on\nthe internet because it's a waste of\ntime I can't do anything about it it's\njust feeding on my you know on my I\nforget the part of the brain that's\nthat's like the amydala or whatever\nright so no I don't want to go there\nright and on and on and on all these\nthings in social media some of it's good\nsome of it's interesting I can follow\nAndrew huberman's podcast and I enjoy\nthat and I learn a lot from it but a lot\nof these podcasts are useless they're\nthey're not helping me in any way so it\ngives you this kind of filter and this\nradar to cut out those hundred different\nchoices that drive us absolutely crazy\nand I know maybe I'm partially I maybe\nI'm a little bit I don't know I hate to\nsay that maybe I'm partially on the\nSpectrum or something but I can't trans\ncan't stand too many choices it\ncompletely drives me nuts so I always\nhave to kind of funnel my energy into\nsomething to things that are productive\nand having a sense of your purpose\nwhenever you discovered in your 20s\nhopefully gives you that ability to say\nthese are the positive role models I\nwant in my life these are the mentors\nand the thing about following people on\nsocial medas it's so easy it's just a\nclick it doesn't mean anything a mentor\nrelationship takes work it takes courage\nbecause you have to actually go up to\nsomebody and physically ask for their\nhelp and a lot of people write to me say\nI'm afraid of asking this important\npowerful person to be their mentee right\nso it involves a sense of social courage\nwhere you have to literally engage with\nanother human being who you admire and\nwho you think is powerful so it's\nbuilding your social skills Etc but it's\na skill you develop you can't just\nfollow someone you can't just watch\ntheir lectures you have to engage with\nthem and you have to get over some of\nyour fears and your anxieties in the\nprocess yeah and I might add to it uh I\nthink everything you say is absolutely\ntrue and I think um engaging in the the\nvarious um tools that they recommend is\nimmensely helpful like I think hear\nhearing about a book is great reading a\nbook is even better um thinking about a\nbook is even that you read is even\nbetter than that and then uh writing\ndown your own ideas and writing a book\nwell that's that's the big win right and\nthat's what the world I believe that's\nwhat the universe wants from us not\nnecessarily to write a book but you know\ntranslate what I just said to any number\nof different Endeavors yeah you want to\nbe able to think for yourself right so\nyou're not just absorbing ideas from\nother people and kind of mimicking them\nand kind of just learning the exteriors\nof their ideas you want to kind of\ndigest them and then have them slowly\nbecome your own ideas by interacting\nwith them by creating and like putting\nthem through your own lens so someday\nit's it's a book stirring in me is the\nart of thinking and how to use that kind\nof process and go deeper into it and I\ntalked a lot about it in one of my\npodcasts which might be the seed of a\nbook but it's it's the the difference\nbetween dead thinking and Alive thinking\nideas can be either alive or they can be\ndead and an alive idea is something that\nenters your brain from an external\nSource a philosopher an article somebody\nyou admire somebody you hate and then\nyou absorb it and you think about it and\nyou decide I'm going to turn it around\ninto this and I'm going to make it alive\nand it's going to make it something\nthat's part of me another part of an\nalive idea is um you have an idea that\ncomes to you about a book or a project\nor something about the world and you go\nmaybe that's not actually true maybe the\nopposite is true and you go through a\nprocess and you cycle through it on and\non and you reflect on it and you refine\nthis idea and maybe it turns into its\nopposite and through the process of\nreflecting and correcting and revising\nit you turn it into something living\nsomething alive within you right on and\non and on and what prevents people from\ngoing through that process which would\nbe the subject of my book is basically\nanxiety because I think how you handle\nanxiety is the most important kind of\nquality in life it'll determine whether\nyou will be successful whether you will\nfind your career path or whether you\nwon't be able to I don't know if you can\nfollow that idea at all but um anxiety\nis a signal to you that you don't\nunderstand something that that there's a\nproblem out there that that you can't\nresolve and so what happen Happ s to\nmost people if you're insecure is you\nglom onto something instant and easy to\nget rid of your feeling of anxiety I\ndon't understand this problem oh it must\nbe a must a must be the answer because\nthis person said that right and so you\ndon't develop the the ability to think\nyou don't Dev the ability to go to the\nnext level but if you take that anxiety\nand you go all right maybe a is an\nanswer and then you start going through\na and then you go no maybe a isn't the\nanswer maybe B is the answer you're able\nto surmount your anxiety and go past it\nfurther and further and further you\ndon't rush for the first available\nanswer that's out there right you're\nable to go through a process of refining\nthings and so in your\ncareer if you're anxious for Success if\nyou're anxious for money you're going to\nmake the wrong choices but if you're\nable to deal with that anxiety and say\nmaybe I'm I have to think more deeply\nabout where I'm going I have to come up\nwith other alternatives then you're\ngoing to make a much better choice on\nand on and on so how if you're deal if\nyou're a creative person it's very very\nchallenging to have that blank piece of\npaper before you that book that you\nhaven't written that film or whatever\nyou're filled with a lot of anxiety and\nyou have to deal with it and if you're\nable to turn into something creative and\nproductive then great things will happen\nyou'll create a masterpiece so the\nability to deal with anxiety and to not\ngive into the most instant gratification\nthat you can get is to me a marker of\nsomebody who will be creative and will\ninvent something as opposed to people\nwho just recycle old and dead\nideas Amen to that I uh was once told\nthat you know anxiety makes children of\nus all and not in the positive sense of\nbeing childlike you know it it regresses\nus to a mode where we feel a complete\nlack of control and I completely agree\nthat being able to manage anxiety and\nand work dance with it yeah since we\ncan't rid ourselves of it no perhaps nor\nshould we right because it's a signal as\nyou point out that we don't understand\nsomething that there's there's something\nto get curious about right a process or\nsomething out there or both I think uh\nthat really resonates yeah and I think a\nlot of people will benefit from from\nhearing that because I think we hear the\nword flow and we just all imagine I even\ncatch myself imagining that you know\nwhen Robert Green sits down to right\nit's like there's a blank sheet and then\nhe just kind of meditates and then boom\nout com these books um but I you know if\nI get realistic for a second I'm sure\nthat there's a lot of inner turmoil and\nanxiety my God you have no idea so um my\nprocess is is 95% pain and maybe 2 and a\nhalf% ecstasy and I don't know what the\nother two and a half% would be but um so\nI write a story because all in my new\nbook and most of my books I always begin\nwith the story from history\nEtc and it is so bad it I just I can't\nbelieve how bad how flat it is how it\nsucks I'm so embarrassed I hate myself\nthen I go and I go dig into and I start\nchanging the words in it I start making\na little bit better the second version\nIt's kind of palatable but it still\nsucks it's if I let it out the world it'\nbe very embarrassing I work I it's an\nanxious you know and my wife can tell\nyou I'm a miserable being when that\nhappens everything looks black to me at\nthat point and and I pushed through it\nso if I gave in to my anxiety and this\nhappens with a lot of books and writers\nI would just put out that second version\nwhich isn't very good it isn't very\nstrong it isn't thought through because\nmy ideas when I look at them the first\ntime I go that's not real that's not the\nactual thing that's going on here Robert\nyou've missed the mark you want to hit\nwhat's actually real in that story so\nyou have to go deeper and deeper and\nharder and harder and harder so I don't\njust give up and go here's the chapter I\ngo it's got to be better it's got to be\nbetter until\nfinally after two months of\nstruggling it seems like it's it's gone\nto the place that I want it to be in\nright but I I use that anxiety to keep\nimproving and making it better and then\nwhen I reach that point and the story is\ngood enough and I can let my wife read\nit and then my editor I feel great I\nhave that 2% moment of Joy but it came\nthrough all of that anxiety but I can\ncan tell you the feeling of fulfillment\nwhen I finish a chapter is pretty damn\ngreat when I finish a\nbook it's better than any kind of drug\nexperience anyone could ever have it's\nsuch a wonderful feeling of\naccomplishment and pushing past all the\nbarriers you know so my process involves\na lot of anxiety and dealing with that's\nwhy I'm talking about it why I want to\nwrite a book about it thank you for\nsharing that um I'm attempting to write\na book and have been for several years\nand now I feel a little bit better but\nclearly I need to ratchet down harder um\nbut in other domains of life I I am\nfamiliar with the experience of tons of\nanxiety and just okay I'm going to just\nget to this one Milestone and then I'll\nfigure out the next Milestone but even\nthat process of saying okay I'm going to\nbreak this down into Milestones itself\nis anxiety provoking it's just that but\nat some point it generates enough\ninertia that you just that you just sort\nof stumble forward into the process and\nthen keep going so try not to bloody\noneself that's right too much yeah I\nthink a lot of people will benefit from\nhearing about that in fact I'm certain\nthey will So speaking of anxiety you\nhave a clip on the internet that we will\nprovide a link to in the show note\ncaptions which I think is absolutely\nfabulous about how to find a romantic\npartner and or get more out of an\nexisting romantic partnership I don't\neven remember what I said you're gonna\nhave to remind me oh it's so good\num\none point in particular yeah that uh I\nremember um that I think is oh so true\nis that there needs to be at least one\nand probably several uh points of like\nreal convergence in terms of one's\ninterests or likes that go beyond like\nwhat food somebody likes or uh you know\nwhat type of house they want to live in\nbut that actually traces back to these\nearly form forms of delight and you\nmentioned uh that for you and therefore\npresumably your partner that you know a\nmutual love and respect for Animals\nhappens to be one of those things within\nthe context of your relationship right\nthat not that A Love For Animals is\nrequired for me it sure as hell is right\nexactly I could never go out with a\nwoman who didn't love animals right my\nsister used to tease me that um if a\nwoman gave me a birthday card or a card\nthat had a drawing of a particular\nanimal which I'm particularly fond of my\nsister used I have an older sister and\nshe used to say oh no it's over he's\ngone you know that it would you know um\nfortunately it's it's not that simple um\nbut uh there's some truth to what she\nwas saying um it's certainly uh it's\nnecessary but not sufficient but maybe\nyou could elaborate a little bit on this\nnotion of um convergent interest and\ncontrast it with a lot of what people\ntend to hear and say about what's\nimportant in Partnership\nbecause I think this is something that a\nlot of people grapple with both in terms\nof finding a partner and in terms of\nbuilding\npartnership well um you have to you know\nthere's you can there's different\nrelationships you can have I mean do you\nwant like a one week a one month\nrelationship or you looking for\nsomething longer more satisfying that\nwill entail you know maybe years of\nbeing\ntogether and um you know uh people can\nget very boring very quickly right\nparticularly if you can't have a\nconversation with them about subjects\nthat interest you and so you mention\nanimals animals is a very good example\nbecause it's not I'm not saying that you\nboth have to be Democrats or Republicans\nthat's too banal and superficial but the\nLove of Animals reaches into your\ncharacter reaches something deep inside\nof you or your dislike of animals if\nthat happens to be the case but it\nsignals something about it that's so\nPrimal that's so connected to a\nchild that there's going to be a deep\nconnection there and it's not like you\nhave to both love cats which is good if\nthat happens to be the case but just\nanimals in general you love their energy\nyou love the fact that they're that\nthey're innocent in their own way you\nlove the fact that they're not playing\ngames with you you love the kind of\ninstant love you can get from them kind\nof thing and you connect to them on that\nlevel is a very very positive sign\nbecause it goes beyond just intell ual\nthings into something emotional and\nvisceral so really the emotional\nconnections the values that you have\ntogether are very important money is\nanother one that's extremely important\nso if one of you is incredibly material\noriented and it's all about money is is\nis power and success and comfort and the\nother isn't really into it it's into\nspending money Etc a lot of people have\nendless fights or something like money\nright where there's no convergence there\nand money signals a deeper value about\nthe person so I'm not saying there's\nanything wrong if money motivates you\nI'm not moralizing about it because that\ncan signal a value that maybe you grew\nup without it and that feeling\ncomfortable and feeling like you don't\nhave to worry about something is very\nvery important to you and the not being\ninterested in money reveals something\nabout your character so I'm telling\npeople you want to look at the person's\ncharacter and see a kind of convergence\nthere and something that can last and I\nremember I was reading um for one of my\nbooks about Franklin delanor Roosevelt\nand Elanor Roosevelt and the thing of it\nwas Franklin delanor Roosevelt was his\nincredibly handsome vibrant young man\nbefore he got polio very active very\nathletic very handsome all the women\nwere after him he was like the perfect\nmatch he was wealthy and Elanor\nRoosevelt was like the ugly duckling she\nshe wasn't very pretty she was kind of\nsocially\nawkward but he saw into her character he\nsaw that intellectually she was a match\nfor him he saw that they had kind of\nsimilar interests on that level that I'm\ntalking about that go beneath just the\nsurfaces and he chose Elanor and\neveryone was shocked about it you know\nnobody was was trying to court Elanor\nI've WR her last name at the time I\nthink she might have even be a Roosevelt\num so it was very shocking you said I I\nlooked at somebody who I could last with\nwho had some qualities that were much\nmore important to me and it ended up\nbeing a very satisfying relationship of\ncourse later on he had his Dianes so it\nwasn't perfect but it was a very it was\na very positive relationship so seeing\nyour values in life you know when it\ncomes to like money when it comes to\nlike career when it comes to comfort or\nlack of comfort some people like like\nnot being comfortable they like being on\nthe edge they want challenges they want\nto move from City to City kind of thing\nand if you partner with somebody who\njust wants to live in the same house\nyou're going to have conflict after\nconflict after conflict the sex might be\ngreat and that might be good for a month\nor two months I have nothing against\nthat I'm not going to judge that either\nbut it won't lead to a longlasting\nrelationship you know Sports and\nAthletics are another thing is this\nsomeone that likes the outdoors or is it\nsomeone who's you know like zaha Gabor\nhas to be in in a Time Square in a\npenthouse in Manhattan you know kind of\nthing so values that reach inside of a\nper character that are deeply ingrained\nthat you can almost not change you can't\ncontrol and there's a convergence there\non several levels is a sign that you can\nhave a deep connection with that person\nand it's very important and if those\nconnections are good and there's a\nphysical attraction because if without\nthe physical attraction it will kind of\nfizzle out you've got a recipe for for\nincredible success for something that\ncan really last and having a lasting\nrelationship as I've\nhad is is such an anchor in your life\nyou know for me for someone who works as\nhard as I do and hopefully for her as\nwell it just grounds me and it makes\nlife so much simpler and easier and and\nit's not just simple and easy there's a\nlot of love and a great deal of of\nof deeper emotions involved but having a\nlong-term relationship if you can have\nit is something that pays off in so many\ndividends so being able to find that\nkind of convergence you know when I\nfirst met my now my wife um I had a cat\nat the time I'd always been a dog person\nbut this was a cat I had and I love that\ncat like hell I can't believe he was\nsuch a wonderful\ncat I brought her over to my apartment\non the first date I wanted to see her\nreaction to the cat you know cuz I\ngenerally and I don't know people\nmisjudge that women who don't like cats\nI I don't I can't get along with right\nbecause there's something feline in the\nfeminine nature that I love and she\nloved my cat boy that was the best sign\nof all and things just Bloss and she\nloved me for loving a cat so there was a\ngreat convergence right there that we\nsaw right away and there were other\nthings but that was the first one\nI love that story and everything you\njust said suggests I believe that in\norder to\nfind the right partner and to build an\nexisting partnership that hopefully\nfeels at least partially right to people\nthat it requires at least some knowing\nof self Because unless you know your\ncharacter one's own character then it's\nimpossible to really determine if\nsomebody else's character is going to\nmesh well with it or not self awareness\nis is actually the most important\nquality in life for all aspects but yeah\nI mean if we go by social pressures a\nman will choose a trophy wife who looks\nsexy and hot and will impress all of his\nmale friends etc etc you go by the\nthings that culture tells you that these\nare the right images for you right and\nthen there won't be any connection to\nyou because you're choosing for purposes\nthat don't connect to who you are and so\nyou have to know yourself you have to\nknow what you love you have to know what\nyou hate I think most people know that\nthey love animals or don't love animals\nI think most people know that they like\nstability or they like things to be kind\nof slightly chaotic I don't think you\nhave to go through deep levels of\nintrospection but what you have to do is\nwhen you're involved in a relationship\nyou have to think that those things\nmatter that's the problem you tend to\nthink that those things may you think\nthat sex matters more than anything\nphysical attraction matters or you think\nthat the person having a lot of money\nmatters etc etc you don't think that\nthis other aspect is important if you\nvalue what I'm talking about then your\nself-awareness will kick in because you\nreally basically know these essential\nbasic parts about your own character I\nthink people sometimes get um distracted\nby admiration of qualities that they\nmight\nfind\nadmirable but that don't mesh with their\nown character I've seen this many times\nbefore where well uh where someone will\nsay well there someone will start\nlisting off the positive attributes of\nthe person that they happen to be dating\nlike he does this blank blank and blank\nshe does this you know he volunteers Etc\nand that's all great I mean volunteering\nfor good causes I'm all in support of\nthat but then what they're overlooking\noften it seems is whether or not that's\na core value for them or whether or not\nit's just something that they admire I\nhear a lot of admiration in the early\ndays of relationships that later I hear\nabout failing and what you're talking\nabout is something deeper more uh\naligned with one's own sense of self and\nit almost um leads me to use the word\nyou know sort of a more about energetics\nit's like merging of people's energies\nwhich sounds very new Agy and that's not\nmy intention but but I think it relates\nto something that we do hear a lot about\nand I think is valid which is how it\nfeels to be around somebody in different\ncontext like do we feel at ease do we\nfeel lightness an ability to express\nourselves and to um and do we enjoy and\nadmire them in their expression as\nopposed to just admiring what they do\nthey've accomplished blank blank and\nblank I see right they uh manifest these\nqualities that I wish I had right you\nhear that and and aspire to have which\nis very different than a meshing of of\nenergies also there a couple other\nthings you have to understand their\ncharacter as well and people can be very\ndeceptive and very slippery and can wear\nmasks one telling sign that I've noticed\nin my own relationships in the\npast is that the woman would be a\ncertain way with me that I thought was\nvery good and I liked and then the\nmoment we were with other people she\nacted in a way that was very irritating\nit's like a different character and I\nreally kind of fell out of love with her\nwhen I saw her in social interactions\nshe revealed so with me she was almost\nwearing a mask and playing a game but\nthe moment she entered a different\ncircumstance I saw another aspect to her\ncharacter so you also have to be very\nattentive to their character what lies\nunderneath that they have some of these\nvalues that they're not just trying to\nwin you over for whatever and they're\nplaying along with you the other thing\nthat's very\nimportant is a sense of mystery so a\npartner can become boring very very\nquickly right after a year you know\nevery single thing about them right\nthey're going to say the same things the\nconversations go around in circles it's\njust you've reached an end there's no\nsurprises there's no mystery you want\nsomebody where they have corners that\nyou don't really see at first that they\nsurprise you sometimes suddenly there's\na quality that you hadn't suspected\nbefore so people who are too obvious who\nare too familiar who show everything\ninstantly they're going to end up boring\nyou right but people who have a bit of\nReserve I I know this is maybe I'm I'm\nprojecting my own values on the world\nbut people who who kind of intrigue you\nthat you don't fully understand that\nmake you want to know more and if they\ncan be like that after two years or\nthree years or five years wow that's\nfantastic but the sense of I know every\nsingle thing about this person they\nnever surprise me anymore is what kind\nof breaks the the the enchantment and\nleads to the end of the relationship\nwell the idea of more to learn about\nsomebody\num perhaps also suggests that they are\ncontinuing to evolve into forage in the\nlandscape of life you know that they're\nnot fully baked yeah right that which I\nthink is um an interesting idea in\nduring the four episode series that we\ndid on Mental Health Paul kti a\npsychiatrist said that um a matching of\ngenerative drives which he defined as\nthe desire to create something in the\nworld of One's Own expression is really\ncritical in relationship and he said you\nknow it matters less whether or not one\nperson likes classical music and the\nother person rock and roll provided that\ntheir relationship to music is similar\nor something of that sort like that it's\nabout a drive to of a certain sort to\nengage in the world so one person could\nlove music the other person's not into\nmusic but the way that they approach\nlife is one of perhaps Mutual curiosity\ndesire to find out Etc and that this\nexists on a Continuum uh I'm curious if\nuh it seems to jive with what you're\nwith what you're saying it does but the\nonly thing I would add is\nif you love classical music and they\nlove like heavy metal music you're going\nto be driven crazy pretty quickly it's\ngoing to you know it's not going to mesh\nwith you and I know I would have that\nproblem you'll both be in headphones a\nlot right so the fact that you both have\nbecause music is like animals in a way\nso I agree completely with what you're\nsaying but I would say maybe music isn't\nthe best example because music says\nsomething very deep about a person right\nthere and you know I'm not saying one is\nsuperior to the other but it reveals\nsomething that's nonverbal that that\nkind of gives you a window into who they\nare so if they like punk rock like you\ndo and I grew up on punk rock there's a\nrebellious thing this to there's an\nanti-authoritarian quality that's very\nstrong you get you get to see that\nthrough them if they like modart and\nsoft string quartets there's somebody\nthat kind of value softness and\ntranquility and peace and you're not\nlike that so the music kind of shows you\nsomething a quality about their\ncharacter that can be very telling and\nbe very eloquent and so it doesn't mean\nthat you both have to love The Clash or\nthe dead kennedies or whatever showing\nmy own Generation Um but that you both\nhave that rebellious streak and that\nrebellious streak could be you like\nthere's classical music composers who\ncould be pretty damn rebellious and\nangry you know and I actually kind of\nlike them so that convergence I think is\na positive one kind of thing but in\ngeneral I agree with that I'm curious\nabout the non-verbal communication\ncomponent of all types of relationships\nbut let's stay in the landscape of\nromantic relationships for the moment\nyeah maybe include professional\nrelationships too because what you just\ndescribed is really about a resonance\naround the non-verbal stuff I mean it\ncan be articulated with words yeah um I\nlove animals I love this music this is\nthe best song like did you see that like\notter are amazing right this kind of\nthing but language is just an attempt to\nplace you know words on a Feeling in\nthose instances so it it can be\nclassified as non-verbal\num with respect to non-verbal\ncommunication you've\nwritten fairly extensively about the\nfact that people often communicate with\ntheir body and facial\nexpressions um uh I'm certainly familiar\nwith the somewhat if not very eerie\nsensation of somebody um smiling like a\ntoothy smile and then it as they pivot\naway that smile just dissolving very\nquickly and um you know you don't have\nto be a neuroscientist or a psychologist\nto realize that like there was something\nquite false about that experience or\nthat this person experiences um emotions\nlike step functions on off on off which\nis not how most of us EXP experience\nemotions most of us experience emotions\nwith some pervasiveness like I was happy\nwalking in the door because of something\nhappened before and so I'm going to\nsmile while I'm walking in the door if I\nsee something shocking and dismaying of\ncourse I'm going to frown I'm going to\nwipe away that smile but those are rare\ninstances so um let's talk about the\nmouth the eyes the face the body in the\ncontext of communication what are what\nare some important things to pay\nattention that I I I I want to go back\non as far as convergence is sense of\nhumor is extremely important right so\nit's not like you both like the same\ncomedians but if one person likes ranchy\nhumor and the other person doesn't\nthat's that's a problem and also the\nfact that the person doesn't have a\nsense of humor or doesn't make you laugh\nis a very very bad sign so I wanted to\nadd that one component in there I'm so\nglad you did uh someone who can make me\nlaugh has uh you know necessary but not\nsufficient but boy it's uh approaching\nsufficient yeah I'd say so I'd say so um\nyou know when it comes to the Art of\nSeduction The Art of Seduction is a\nnonverbal language that you must Master\nit's a language of the gifts that you\ngive it's a ma it's a language of of how\nyou smell it's a language that you TR\nthat you communicate through the eyes\netc etc and the thing you have to\nunderstand about the human being is that\nwe evolved for much longer period of\ntime without words than the small 40\n35,000 years that we have symbolic\nlanguage so during that vast period of\nDarkness where we did not have words we\nwere non communicating non-verbally we\nwere picking up signals from people we\nwere watching every little detail of\ntheir behavior because we didn't have\nwords to decipher it so it's wired into\nour brains to have an amazing\nsensitivity to people's non-verbal\nCommunications we can almost be\ntelepathic that way if we learn that\nlanguage the problem is we have the\ncapacity but we don't develop it at all\nbecause we are so word oriented you're\njust listening to people if you're even\nlistening to them at all you're just\nhearing the words and you're so thinking\nthat the words mean something the words\nare sincere which they're often not at\nthe same time that you're listening so\nmuch to words people are shuffling in\ntheir chair they're kind of looking away\nthey're looking at other women or other\nmen their voice is kind of trembling\nwhen they say something that where it\nshouldn't tremble their eyes are dead\nthe smile is kind of fake you're not\nwatching any of it so the most important\nthing in non-verbal communication law\nnumber one is pay attention to it\ncontinually develop the practice of\nshutting off the words and watching\npeople almost as if you took the\ntelevision and muted it right and just\nwatched their behavior it's not easy and\nit's not natural because it's the words\nthe words were words we want to we want\nto focus on them right but your ability\nto turn that television off to mute it\nwill suddenly open up so many things\nabout people they reveal so much things\nSigman Freud said people are continually\noozing out all of their secrets through\ntheir non-verbal Behavior you can read\nthem like an open book if you master\nthis language and I have in the laws of\nhuman nature I describe the story of\nMilton Ericson I don't know if you're\nfamiliar with Milton ericsen perhaps the\ngreatest modern master of non-verbal\ncommunication he was a an amazing\npsychologist he sort of um is the\ninspiration behind um n what's it called\nn help me out here neuro linguistic oh\nthe NLP I it's kind of a bastardization\nof his ideas but he's he created\nhypnotherapy he's the person who created\nhypnotherapy certainly I uh hypnotherapy\nis is a valid psychiatric practice I\nmean it's excellent clinical data to\nsupport well Milton Ericson had Polio\nwhen he was 19\nand he was paralyzed his entire body was\nparalyzed he couldn't even move his\neyeballs right and he sat in bed and he\nhad a very active mind and he was going\nto just die from sheer boredom and what\nhe did during the two years of being\nparalyzed like that was just watching\nPeople's non-verbal communication and\nmaking notes in his brain and learning\nevery single he learned the 20 different\nforms of yes the 100 different forms of\nno right every intonation how somebody\nentered the room how they left the room\nyou know how they looked at him with the\npity or empathy or something he mastered\nit and then when he became a\npsychiatrist and he treated people they\nthought he was psychic he could see\neverything into them it's because for\ntwo years that's all he could do was\nObserve them he couldn't speak he\ncouldn't do anything he couldn't read a\nbook so you have that same power but you\ndon't have po obviously but you have to\nfirst pay attention to it right it's an\namazing thing once you do it's a lot of\nfun actually and I tell people go to a\ncafe one day in your city wherever you\nlive and just watch people because you\ncan't hear them they're a few tables\naway watch their non-verbal Behavior as\nthey interact and see if if you pick up\ncues from them and there are things that\nare signs of genuine emotions so for\ninstance an exercise you can do is you\ngo up to somebody from an angle where\nthey can't see you coming up to them and\nyou surprise them you go hey hey Mike\nwhatever they turn for that second their\nexpression reveals how they really think\nabout you you'll detect if you can pick\nup micro expressions and and you can\nthey're only like one 150th of a second\nbut they're there you can express a kind\nof and they smile you can see the little\ndisdain in their eyes right then the\nmask comes on right or you're talking to\nthem they're looking at you but their\nfeet are facing in an opposite direction\nthat means that they're dying to get\naway from you kind of thing these are\nsignals that you don't necessarily pay\nattention to their posture will tell you\neverything about their levels of\nconfidence right on and on and on the\nfake smile if you can just Master the\nability to detect the fake smile it will\ngo wonders for you because you're able\nto see what you really want to do is to\nsee the person with a genuine smile\nparticularly in romantic\nrelationships someone whose face lights\nup a real smile lights your whole face\nup it doesn't light your mouth that\nthese parts of your face go up your eyes\nget alive there's like a there's like a\na neuro thing going on in your brain\nthat's changing your whole facial\nexpression and it means that someone\ngenuinely likes you they're genuinely\ninterested in you they're genuinely\nlaughing or connecting to you man if you\ncan see that it'll help you so much in\nthe Romantic realm and that'll help you\nget away from those toxic people that\nare continually faking interest in you\nbecause a narcissist a toxic\nperson thrives by deceiving you with a\nCharming alluring front that makes you\ncome into their world then they can hurt\nyou then they can do something to you\nright then they have you in in in their\nin their you know in their trap right so\nbeing able to see that they're not\ngenuinely interested in you that they're\nfaking it will help you avoid very toxic\nrelationships and as I said to you I\ndon't know if we were on air or not but\ndeep narcissists have dead eyes they\nthey almost can't help it they can fake\nthe smile they can fake everything else\nbut the eyes you have to be able to read\nit because you say well what are dead\neyes you'll know it when you see it\nthere's no life in them they're like\nlooking through you they're not looking\nat you they're looking through you what\ncan I get out of you you're what they\ncall a selfobject they're an object for\nyou to use and that's how they're\nlooking at you like they would look at a\nhammer or something yeah the concept of\ndead eyes\nand also alive eyes is so fascinating\nbecause um as audience of this podcast\nwill know that because I've said it too\nmuch but I'll say it again that the eyes\nare the only two pieces of your brain\nthat are outside the cranial Vault I\nmean they're literally two pieces of\nbrain linning the back of your eyes and\nthe Dynamics of the pupils those changes\nof course reflect how bright or dim it\nis in the room but they also reflect\nlevels of arousal that are on the\nmillisecond time scale so as one\nexpresses you know words of um of Glee\nright the pupils constrict a little bit\nbelieve it or not or excuse me dilate a\nlittle bit I got it backwards there for\na moment um and vice versa you know as\none feels uh less less excited um sort\nof moments of Despair expressions of\nDespair that people should get a little\nbit smaller because arousal is going\ndown and so I think you know we pick up\non these things at a unconscious level\nwe do um the deadness of the eyes is is\nkind of the the um the the conclusion\nthat that pops out at us if we're paying\nattention but the problem is it love it\nregisters unconsciously but we don't\ngive it any value to it we trust our\nwords we trust our rationality as\nopposed to our intuitions about people\nso sometimes when you meet a person for\nthe first time signals go up in your\nmind brain something's wrong about them\nand then you forget it because you don't\ntrust those initial unconscious signals\nthat your brain is giving you right so\nyou have to you have to first kind of\ntrust that this that these intuitions\nare very valuable the other thing is pay\ndeep attention to the tone of voice The\nVoice as actors will tell you is like\nthe hardest thing to fake right it's\nvery hard to fake excitement your voice\neither has it or it doesn't it's very\nhard to fake confidence and you can I\nmean books have been written about that\nI'm not going to go into all the the\ndetails about it but the person will\nreveal so much of their emotional of the\nemotions that they're experiencing\nparticularly levels of confidence you\nknow like a trembling Voice or something\nor a booming confident voice which some\npeople can fake but often it's very\ndifficult you can still see through it\nand on the level of\nSeduction women men are very very\nattuned to the voice of a woman but\nwe're not aware of it because the voice\nof our mother had an incredible impact\non us in early early early childhood her\nsinging her the tone of her voice that\nwas probably the first seduction that we\never went through and a woman's voice\nhas tremendous power over us right and\nso hearing a voice that kind of great\nAtes or irritates you is is something\nthat's that's a bad sign and that goes\ndeeper than all the characteristics that\nwe were talking about but a woman's\nvoice that kind of reminds you of that\nmother that sing songy whatever feeling\nit was that's that's somebody that's\nthat can very easily seduce you yeah\nthere's a um there's a place for uh\nnaming this of it's like subcortical\ncourtship uh you know you know below the\ncortex as the geeky neuroscientists like\nmyself say you know you're getting down\nbelow the cortex with all of this stuff\nyou know convergence of of real uh loves\nand desires I mean we express with words\nwe sense the world using of course our\ncortex but we're really talking about\ngetting into the the subcortical stuff\nthat is the stuff of our history the\nstuff of our um hardwiring and our\nunique our uniqueness I couldn't help\nbut think about the fact that earlier we\nwere talking about the now you know\ninfinitely vast number of choices of\nthings to engage in people to engage\nwith Etc\nbut at the same time as you were now\ntalking about um these micro inflections\nand the subtleties of voice and bodily\ncommunication that whether or not it's\nemojis or people sending filtered images\nor the default to text message\ncommunication that is so prominent now\nit seems like we now have more choices\nso uh more input\nbut the sort of qualitative differences\nbetween the puts have been binned into a\ncouple of simple bins as if it's as if\nwe've um regressed to primary colors\nonly um but the canvas is huge or may I\ndon't know if that analogy works but you\nyou get the idea because ultimately in\norder to develop good choices about\nprofession romantic relationships\nfriendships you need a lot of examples\nand a lot of information that allows you\nto glean the subtlety um but as long as\nit's emojis and filtered pictures taken\nat a particular angle angle you know\nusually from above ask for the picture\nheadon and Below send me a picture of\nyour worst your worst expression um all\nof that um it seems that there's now\nincreased opportunity for deception and\nI don't just mean people misleading\nothers I also mean us misleading\nourselves like oh my goodness how could\nI be so disappointed yet again about\nparticular landscape of life it doesn't\njust have to be romantic interactions it\ncould be other Landscapes like how could\nI be fooled well you're fooled because\nthe the uh the inputs were deficient not\ngood data as we say well the thing is if\nthings are are you're immersed in the\nvirtual\nrealm it's very very hard to master the\nnon-verbal communication aspect which is\nso important so if you're dating from an\napp and you're flipping through and then\nyou find that person you've missed out\non the greatest experience of life which\nis actually having to to go out to a bar\nor go to a restaurant or go to a social\nevent and have to literally encounter\nanother person and deal with looking at\ntheir their behavior and kind of\nassessing who they are it's a muscle\nthat you have to pay attention to\nnon-verbal communication and if you're\njust you know going through the Emojis\nor going through the Tinder apps that\nmuscle completely atrophies you have no\npower you're not able to decipher\nanything and that's what's happening\nwith a lot of people who are using these\napps a social skills are like any skill\nat all they you have to develop them\nit's a muscle you have to develop and\nyou've all noticed this probably in your\nown life if you've gone through a period\nwhere you're kind of retreating you\ndon't want to be around people and you\nspend a month like that and then you go\nout you feel awkward it takes you like a\ncouple days to get used to being around\nother people you say stupid things your\nbody language is awkward but if you're\nin a situation for months where you're\nconstantly interacting people you're on\na film set and day in day out day out\nthat skill starts developing but you\nhave to be out there in the world you\nhave to be interacting you have to be\nlooking at people's emotions you have to\nbe gauging them in real time we're not\nbuilt for virtual encounters we're\ncreatures of human of Flesh and Blood\nand we need to be looking at each other\nin the eye and paying attention to all\nthese little details these new nuances\nthat you can only get in person along\nthose lines what are your thoughts about\nAi and how that's going to shape our um\nsense of self sense of others and\nrelationships as if that's a topic that\ncould be covered in uh a series of\nminutes but what what are your um what\nare your top Contour maybe even deeper\nthoughts about AI well I'm gonna I'm\ngoing to piss a lot of people off but\nI'm I'm kind of very concerned about it\num I mentioned before about anxiety the\nrole that anxiety plays in thinking you\ncome upon an\nidea and you go yeah that's all good\nthen you go to the next level and it\nbecomes better and you go oh maybe\nthat's not so good then you go to the\nnext level you go to level three and it\ngets better and better you have anxiety\nanother aspect of intelligence is\nself-awareness right the beity to look\nat yourself go I have biases I have\nconfirmation bias I have conviction bias\nI have recency bias I have to counteract\nthese things I also have a dark side I\nhave aggression I have to be aware of\nhow they color my thinking my emotions\nthe third quality that goes into int I'm\ntalking about now intelligence not\nartificial intelligence is the beity to\ndeal anxiety and go to a third level\nintelligence is the ability to look\ninside of yourself and see your own\nbiases and the third thing is the\nability to see a holistic picture the\nkind of aha moment that scientists have\nwhere you accumulate all kind of data\npoints and then out of nowhere an image\ncomes to your mind of yeah there's the\nanswer you see the whole thing you see\nthe whole Gestalt right Simone vile\ncompared it to a a um a square Cube you\ncan only see a cube from one side or you\ncan never see a a square Cube you can\nonly see a side of it if it's rotating\nyou're still only seeing sides of it\nonly in your mind can you picture the\nwhole thing so the mind has to go\nthrough a process to have holistic\nthinking if they can invent a machine\nmachine that can deal with anxiety and\nhas anxiety and can go to level three if\nthey can make a machine that can be\nself-aware that can go the people who\nprogram me have biases therefore I have\nbiases I also have a dark side because\npeople have program you have a dark side\nif this machine can also think\nholistically beyond all of the data\npoints and all the massive information\nit's combined it can have that aha\nmoment all right I can see a human\nconsciousness I can see creativity there\nthe other thing I would say is when I\nwas a student at Berkeley going way back\nI was 19 years old I decided One Summer\nthis is a big paradigm shift for me I'm\ngoing to take this class in ancient\nGreek in six weeks they teach you a year\nof ancient Greek that means every day\nyou have an exam every Friday you have a\nfinal exam eight hours every day of a\ndead language I thought this would be\nthe best discipline for me after someone\nwho didn't been doing too many drugs to\nbe honest with you okay and so finally\nat one point they give us this paragraph\nof the hardest ancient Greek writer of\nall to read this was near the end\nthiddies or thiddies as they\nsay I st so I had I had like the whole\nnight to try and translate one paragraph\nI couldn't figure it out you have to\nunderstand the the weirdness of ancient\nCreek all the endings the weird ways of\nthinking the whole picture that aha\nmoment was luding me at one point I\nthought I got it and I translated it and\nI gave it to the teacher next day I\nremember he was this kind of hippie that\nyou'd have it Berkeley Dennis classic\nProfessor but also hippie the fact that\nyou knew his first name is very tell I\ncan only remember his first name Dennis\nhe he's he said Robert I can see your\nthinking but you need to go to another\nlevel you missed you didn't have that\naha moment you didn't put the whole\nthing together you were close but you\ndidn't you have to try harder and that\nstuck in my mind forever like whenever I\nhave a problem I have to think harder I\nhave to go to that next level now what\nwould happen if I had pulled out my\ntranslation of through cities and just\ncopied that out right or what have\nhappened if I put it through chat GPT\nand it gave me the translation that\nmuscle in my brain that I have developed\nfor 40 years that allows me to write\nbooks would never have developed and\nthat muscle is I don't know the answer\nhere I have to go to another level I\nhave to try harder I have to think I\nhave have to think I have to have that\nengine worring around right but if I\njust grab for chat GPT it's deadened and\nthen we're going to have a whole\ngeneration of people who stop thinking\nwho don't go through that process you\nknow you've heard of Douglas Heder I\nthink he said people train to go to\nMount Everest it takes months physical\nexertion it's painful then they climb\nMount Everest they see the top whoow\nwhat a great moment he said Chad GPT be\nthe equivalent of taking a helicopter to\nthe top of Mount Everest without any of\nthat training and having the same moment\nit's not the same right you need to go\nthrough that process you need to go\nthrough that pain and if you just and\nthe thing of is Chad gbt we think we're\nso modern So Sophisticated but really\nwe're just seduced by Magic you put it\nin there and you see the scri\ngoing whoa It's like magic it's like a\nmagician but it's empty it's like not\nyour brain functioning right it's pay\nit's the Pagan part of us we like that\nkind of\nmagic as opposed to actually having to\ngo through the thought process itself so\nI'm not in FA against having tools I use\ntools I use the internet I use Google\nI'm searching for like some factoid from\nmy book I find it I use it I I like it\nbut I've also learned to develop my\nbrain to think to get that engine\nconstantly moving and I'm deeply\nconcerned about people who can't learn a\nforeign language who can't master\nanything who just immediately grab the\nfirst answer that it generates etc etc I\nhave\nconcerns I am too and I was thinking a\nmoment ago that you know like some\npeople might hear what you just said and\nsay oh well the same thing was probably\nsaid about the automobile like how many\namazing experiences of walking from one\nplace to another are going to be lost\nwhen people start driving from one place\nto another but I think a key difference\nand this certainly aligns with\neverything you just said is that what\nyou're talking about is not just\narriving at the same destination you're\nsaying the destination itself is\ndifferent when one exerts some effort\nand experiences some anxiety to get\nthere so it's not the same as automobile\nversus horse versus walking versus\nairplane yeah it's fundamentally\ndifferent because the the journey\ntransforms the outcome yeah yeah I I'm\nin agreement with you about many aspects\nof AI I'm also excited about it in the\ncontext of certain things I I I I agree\nwith you if could be a tool but are we\noperating the tool or is the tool\noperating us is what I'm talking about I\nam concerned a bit too especially in the\ncontext of what we've been talking about\nfor most of today's discussion about um\navatars replacing our online personas\ntoo much um you know the\nAvatar of ourselves is already taking\nplace through through filters through uh\nreduction of emotional expression to\nemojis through reduction of of language\nto a diminish number of words to explain\none's feelings you know a prior guest on\nthis podcast um Lisa Feldman Barrett\nwho's an expert in emotions talked about\nhow the moment that a culture has a word\nfor a particular subset of anxious\nfeelings so so for instance she taught\nme that in Japanese there's a word for\nthe sadness one experiences when they\nget a bad haircut yeah I know you know\nand so that normalizes the feeling and\nleads to feelings of less despair as\nopposed to what now many kids especially\ngrow up learning which I'm anxious I'm\nsad I'm depressed that you know in\nscience we say there are lumpers and\nthere are Splitters and they've been\narguing for years about like is that one\nbrain structure well if I name those two\nthings next to each other two different\nthings not only can I name one after\nmyself which is what tends to happen so\nto speak but when you have too many\nlumpers or too many Splitters things are\neither overly simple or overly complex\nthat of course the right answer the the\nthe best use of naming things arrive\nsomeplace in the middle right that's how\na field progresses because if you if you\nlump things together too much a field\ncan't progress you give yourself the\nillusion that it's progressing but it's\nnot progressing but if you split things\nup into a million different\nsubcategories like just even the word\nadrenaline is also called epinephrine\nand that's has to do with basically\npeople arguing over who got credit crazy\nand it's confused people for for decades\nyeah and there's a there's another story\nthere that and I know far too much about\nthe scientists involved and the there\nwas a love triangle about naming of\ncertain parts of the nervous system oh\nyeah people sleeping with other people's\npartners and love triangles have have\ncreated more drama of gnomen clature in\nscience I I could do a whole hour on\nthis um in any case I what I'm hearing\nfrom you is that we cannot afford to\nlose our sense of nuance and also\nbecause that sense of nuance Taps into\nwhat we're really experiencing and AI\nthreatens that that we can become\navatars of oursel well look at it this\nway we we worship technology it's our\nnew religion okay and we worship chap\nGPT as if it's a God I'm seriously\nthere's religious elements going on here\nwhat we really should worship is the\nhuman brain which is the greatest\ncreation in the known universe I'm\nafraid it is the most complex piece of\nmatter in the entire universe the number\nof neurons the number of synapses the\nnumber of possible connections between\nneurons is infinite practically infinite\nit is a wondrous instrument it is so\npowerful we've we've barely scratched\nthe surface of what we can use for it\nlet us worship that brain that's in your\nhead you only have so many years to use\nit you have so many years to develop it\nit is so wonderful and Powerful that can\nbring you such pleasure so much power in\nlife so tools are fine we all need tools\nwe all need we need hammers we need\nNails we need saws Etc but the real\nthing is the hand that uses it the brain\nthat connects the hand to the Hammers\nthat knows how to to hit things you know\nI think of the of the um the great\npainter Renoir in the 19 century he had\nlike a a stroke or something then the\nlast years he couldn't move his right\narm which with she painted with and it\nwas disastrous so what he did is he put\nthe brush in his mouth and he painted\nand he painted some beautiful paintings\nthat way because his brain had mastered\nthe art of painting not his hand but his\nbrain had mastered it so well that he\ncould actually paint well with the brush\nin his mouth because he could direct it\nand he could he had the knowledge of how\nto make something perfect the brain is\nabsolutely incredible the plasticity of\nthe brain which I'm discovering after my\nstroke is absolutely a miracle you know\nwhat I don't know is it Professor\nSchwarz at UCLA who was studying OCD and\nhow he was able to kind of cure people\nof OCD through certain plasticity\nexercises that he had making them aware\nof their kind of brain lock Etc and\ngetting them out of it the that\nplasticity of the brain is by far the\ngreatest Miracle of all and it goes on\nuntil your 60s and 70s and on onward\nlet's all get down on our hands and\nknees and worship the brain and if we\ndid it would create a complete shift in\nour values and we wouldn't be so\ninstantly seduced and enamored and\nworshiping the technology we would\nworship the brains that create the\ntechnology instead of you know the other\nway around we certainly got a fan of\nbrains and their uh potential for\nplasticity sitting over here uh I have\nthe benefit of having my scientific\ngreat-grandparents are hu weel who won\nthe Nobel Prize for neuroplasticity\nduring the critical period say that\nagain so my scientific great-\ngrandparents are David hubel and toron\nvisel David's dead Ton's still alive\nhe's 96 and they won the Nobel Prize for\nessentially discovering the critical\nwindow early in development where\nplasticity is especially robust they did\nother things too they should have won\ntwo nobels frankly uh for their other\nwork on Vision but um one thing that\nthey missed however was something that\nyou mentioned and is worth uh\nhighlighting again which is that the\nbrain maintains the capacity for immense\nplasticity throughout the entire\nlifespan that's absolutely clear the\nconditions change from early to later in\nlife but your specific situation really\nhighlights and it's something I'd really\nlike to um talk about for a few minutes\nif if you're willing um as you mentioned\nyou experienced a stroke um and perhaps\nuh it was aware to some but perhaps not\nto all especially the people just\nlistening to this podcast and who are\nnot watching on video that um your shirt\nwhile very nicely designed um in uh in\nits original state also includes some\nunique stitching so maybe you could\nshare with us uh what and for those\nlistening there's a there's a jagged\nline of stitching that um extends from\nRobert's uh left short sleeve to his\nmidline to where the buttons on his\nshirt are and from the from his right\nshort sleeve also to the midline offset\nfrom one another these um this is the\nsort of stitching that looks like\nperhaps I had been at the sewing machine\num and not somebody with uh skilled but\nthey did a good job basically of putting\nit back together why are those stitches\nin your shirt tell us about the stroke\nand let's let's talk about\nneuroplasticity it could also seem like\na fashion statement you know but it\nreally is isn't um well it was May of\n2018 it was my birthday and my wife gave\nme this shirt I have a love of plaids\nit's like I don't know why I just love\npatterns and plaids it must be like some\nScotch part of me some ancestor thing\nbut I love plaids can I interrupt you\njust briefly forgive me everyone's going\nto get upset that interrupt do you know\nthat there is a fundamental circuit in\nyour visual cortex designed to detect\nplaid patterns no I did not know yes and\nwe can talk about why that is it's\ntightly tightly linked to your ability\nto perceive motion really yeah and we\ncan go over it some other time but yeah\nso we'll talk about just as a Quee so\nokay yes back to your birthday okay so\nshe gave me a plaid shirt knowing how\nmuch I loved it and I love this shirt I\nlove the colors in it etc etc and then\ntwo months three months later August 17\n2018 I was driving my car she was with\nme I was pulling out into traffic I\nstarted driving and suddenly she's\nsaying pull up Robert pull over go why\nwhy I can drive I'm fine and then\nsuddenly everything started getting\nreally strange everything looked strange\nmy voice didn't sound the same and she\nwas like freaking out but she was\nactually fairly calm which was amazing I\nwas undergoing a stroke I had a blood\nclot that was blocking the bra blood\nflow to my brain I actually at one point\ngot out of the car like I was I don't\nknow what the hell I was thinking and\nand then she pulled me back in then the\nrest goes blank and I had some weird\nSensations that still remain with me\nbecause essentially I was on the verge\nof dying because blood not flowing to\nyour brain is basically the end of you\nright unless something happens very\nquickly and she either that or you're\ngoing to get severe brain damage so she\ncalled 911 right away she recognized\nsomething my whole face was looking\nfunny and they got there\nI was unconscious and essentially they\ntook this shirt and I just scissored the\nthing in half and took it off my head\nand then they intubated me I believe in\nmy hip area to get something the blood\nclot was in my neck and they were able\nto free it up and they rush me to the\nhospital\nand I'm unconscious and then um I wake\nup and I'm in a gurnie in the hospital\nand I don't for a moment I'm thinking\nmaybe I'm dead\nbecause I'm lying in a gurnie and I\nalmost feel like I'm in a coffin I don't\nknow what's going on and I have all of\nthese weird\nSensations and I I tell people we're so\ncurious about death we think about death\na lot and you know is it final what does\nit mean we really should pay attention\nto dying dying is actually much more\ninteresting in some ways than death and\npeople who have died go through a\nprocess if it if it's long enough and\npeople who have had near-death\nexperiences like I do have gone through\nthat process of dying and have come back\nto life and in the process of\ndying strange things happen to the brain\nright so particularly with a stroke or\nsomething like that where blood stops\nflowing to your oxygen stops flowing to\nyour brain you have kind of visions and\nthings that you might think are\nhallucinations but that later seem like\nactually you are actually glimpsing the\nreality as opposed to the illusion that\nthe brain creates so I've written about\nthis in my new book but um my idea of\nthe brain is that it creates endless\nseries of Illusions for you it creates\nthis seamless version of reality the\nsense of a self the sense of a\ncontinuous self Through Time right it\ncreates a linear sense of time\nprogressions it creates colors it\ncreates a world that visually you can\nseems familiar and etc etc but it's all\nillusion it's all a construction right\nimages come into your brain and they're\nnot organized in any way and the Brain\norganizes in a way that you can\nunderstand it well when you're dying all\nof that scrambles up and you actually\nare seeing something else so I saw for\ninstance that I really don't have a self\nthat it doesn't really actually exist\nthat I'm and the image that came to my\nmind mind cuz it was in sitting in that\ngurnie was a weird feeling\nof like I can almost not explain it but\nit's as if you took an image of\nsomething real in the world and you\ncompletely scrambled it up and it was\nall wavy and you couldn't see what\nexactly it was to me that was the image\nI had of the self there are like 50\ndifferent selves inside of you that are\nall competing and you think there's just\none and you think it's consistent but\nthere's not it's illusion the self is\nliterally an illusion that your brain\nconstructs when you're dying you see\nthese things when you're dying you see\nother things like that you see that time\nis something very weird so I had an\nexperience of when I got out of the car\nand I got pulled in I thought like 10\nseconds had passed my wife told me no\nthose this was like 10 minutes I had no\nsense of time everything was scrambled\nand so it was very very El it taught me\nso much things that I can I can barely\neven express now I'm always now thinking\nof strange things that come to me\nbecause my brain was damaged it made me\nrealize that the brain creates\neverything so I can't communicate with\nmy hand my fingers I can't communicate\nmy brain can't communicate with my leg\nright so you think that walking and\nwriting and handling things is just your\nyour body operating a certain way it's\nyour brain telling you how to move these\ndifferent things when that brain stops\nfunctioning you realize how much your\nbrain determines everything it all\nstarts there and when there's damage to\nyour brain your whole thinking Alters\nEtc not to mention how you look at life\nitself after something like that so it\nwas a terrible experience it's ruined so\nmany things that I loved in life but\nit's given me an awful lot as well in\nreturn that I I could go on for hours\nand talk about because it was the most\npowerful experience of my\nlife when you were going through your\nreemergence to Consciousness in the\nhospital did you feel as if you were\nobserving these multiple versions of\nyourself um maybe a different way to\nphrase it is did you feel you were sort\nof behind the circuit board that is your\nbrain observing how you normally\nfunction and you could see multiple\nversions of self or was it something\nelse where you sort of outside of your\nbody and brain I think it was more\noutside of my body and brain I also had\nthis other thing that happened\nwhere I you know sometimes you can't REM\nyour memory might be playing tricks on\nyou so I've also have to realize that\nmaybe I'm not remembering exactly what\nhappened or that I've since translated\nin a different way so that's a caveat\nhere and I'm aware of it but I had this\nVision that I was dead at first when I\nfirst became conscious and that I was up\nin the sky and I was looking down and my\nmother and my wife were talking and it's\nlike over my grave I suppose and I had\nthis feeling ah everything's okay I'm\ngone but life goes on they're they're\ndoing fine it's okay right so I don't\nknow about that sense of self whether it\nwas like I'm aware of it happening but I\nhave a feeling it was something from the\noutside I don't really know the answer\nto that because it's very confused the\nother feeling I had was life when I was\nhaving the stroke was life draining out\nof me and my bones getting softer and\nsofter and softer and I can't really\nlogically explain that the feeling of\nBones softening up and\ndissolving but for weeks and months\nafterwards I could access that feeling\nof my bones dissolving Etc it was a\nfeeling\nof all your energy draining out out of\nyou and you're dying literally so um\nreading books about near-death\nexperiences CU that's a lot of what I'm\nbig part of my next book God is it's\nfascinating there's so many interesting\nthings to go in because it teaches us so\nmuch I'm so glad a you survived your\nstroke B that your mental faculties he's\nnot more grateful than I am I tell I I\nprobably not but still very grateful so\nthere it just um illustrates how\ngrateful you must be um\nB that you've maintained if not grown\nyour mental faculties I mean you seem\nextremely sharp um I promise you you're\nnot missing a beat uh you know one\nalways wonders right actually one of the\nmost common fears people have is that\nsomehow they're losing their mind or\ntheir memory and people aren't and they\naren't aware of it you know you hear I\nhave family members who have asked that\nif they ever start to exhibit signs of\nsevere dementia that I um well put an\nend to them which I won't um that's not\nmy place in this world um but I think\nit's a common fear among among people\nbut you're still extremely sharp uh and\nthank goodness for it and you mentioned\nthat um while you've lost certain\nabilities that new appreciation and new\nabilities have surfaced um could you\nperhaps share what some of those are and\nand what they mean to you um because I\nthink that when one hears about somebody\nhaving a stroke we tend to focus on\nwhat's what's lacking but clearly this\nhas been a transformative experience\nalso in positive ways well uh I had to\nconfront some of my own demons I had to\nconfront the sense that um I expected\nthings out of life and here they're\ntaken away and I'm I'm I'm kind of\nungrateful for being alive and here I'm\npissed off that it takes me 10 minutes\nto time my shoes and I can't really\nbutton my shirt I had to learn what\nreally matters and to have patience and\nstuff the other thing\nwas I used to love hiking I was very\nphysically active and I'm sitting at my\nwindow in my office I'm see see people\nrunning up and down bicycling walking\ntheir dogs God I'm so envious if I had\nif I could walk a dog right now I'd be\nthe happiest person alive but then I go\nthrough a thought process which maybe\nisn't completely healthy which is\nthey're not aware of how wonderful it is\njust to walk a dog but I'm aware of it\nso when I go out in my backyard and I\ncan't walk and I'm seeing like I know\nthis is going to sound really Tria and\nsentimental but I see you know\nbutterflies or things in my garden I'm\nlike wow that's incredible you know\nthings like that that I I couldn't\nappreciate before because I'm I'm\nsedentary and I can't move I have to\nsuddenly pay attention to what's around\nme not take it for granted and find and\nsuck all the pleasure out of it that I\ncan so now when I sit at my desk to\nwrite my new book it's 4 hours because\nthat's all I can stand maybe three\nsometimes those four hours are like such\nBliss for me I truly appreciate it now\nbecause I know that my brain was almost\ngone right so it means so much for me\nand to just be alive you know is is is\nis just a wondrous experience I have a\nchapter in my new book called awaken to\nthe strangeness of being alive and it's\nabout the fact that if you think about\nit and how unlikely it is that we humans\nevolved at all even that we even exist\nall the bottlenecks and evolution that\nwe had to pass through including The\nDisappearance of the dinosaurs and the\nemergence of mammals but there are 20\nother huge bottlenecks throughout the\nhistory of evolution we had to pass\nthrough all of those we nearly went\nextinct 80,000 years ago from some virus\nthat infected there were only 8,000\npeople humans on the planet all these\ndifferent things and here we are with\nzoom meetings etc etc it's like the\nstrangest story you can ever it's beyond\nscience fiction but nobody thinks about\nit nobody sits down and goes God I'm\nalive if you went back did the chain of\npeople that had to connect and have\nchildren leading up to your parents the\nunlikeliness of you ever being born is\nastronomical I mean unless my science is\nall wrong you know 70,000 generations of\npeople meeting etc etc finally ending at\nyour DNA I mean unless I'm missing\nsomething it's it's pretty\nunlikely but nobody thinks about it well\nI certainly think about it now\nbecause I almost died I have nothing\nelse to think about that's I have to\nentertain my brain the way Milton\nEricson had to entertain himself by\nobserving people so it's taken a lot\naway from me I can't swim I'm riding my\nmy recumbent bike which I love\nand 80-year-old grandmothers are zipping\nby me and God damn it how awful I'm so\nenvious I'm so my insecurities is all\nwell up but then I realiz hey I'm I'm\nlike I'm I'm like on a boat I'm sailing\nit's wonderful I'm outside you know I\nhave to go through these processes but I\nthink it's developed me in some way\nthat's that's in the end very positive\nsounds like you've had to adjust to a\nnew frame rate on life like the the the\nold movie had a certain frame rate this\nmovie has a certain frame frame rate but\nthat within that frame rate there are\ngifts to be had that you certainly\nmissed in your prior version of self is\nthat is that a bur yeah but also like I\ntell people this I totally took my life\nfor granted I I was swimming all this\ntime I was fantastic I was bicycling I\nwas traveling but I never sat back and\nthought W this is wonderful how grateful\nit is could be taken away from you I\ntell people don't do that to yourself I\ntry and teach them it can be taken away\nfrom tomorrow when you're out walking\nthe dog think of me think of me that\ncan't walk the dog and appreciate those\nthings which I didn't appreciate so I\ntry and help people in that way when I\ncan you know I I think uh critical\nmessage is also to inspire a sense of\nurgency in people you know I think\npeople hear a sense of urgency and they\ngo oh God I'm already under so much\npressure life's so hard but we're not\ntalking about a sense of urgency to take\non more what life has to offer uh I\nthink we're talking about a sense of\nurgency to find one's purpose which\ntakes work and is an ongoing process but\nto really get out of modes of apathy\nlaziness um\nlanguishing and to start as you've\ndescribed it paying deeper attention I\nmean this is a a concept that was super\nimportant for me to hear about and I\nlearned about it from was how do you get\nyourself out of a rut you start paying\ndeeper attention to the things around\nyou and inside you and um perhaps not\ncoincidentally you referred to that as\nquote death ground yeah so um it's what\nit's a strategy from my book I wrote\nwrote a book on strategy my version of\nThe Art of War it's called 33 Strategies\nof War but it's really about strategy\nthe Strategic thinking it's inspired\nfrom sunu the great Chinese strategist\nbut it has vast philosophical\nimplications the idea\nis you can almost think of it like\nbarometric pressure when necessity is\npressing in on you like your back is\nagainst the wall like you have to get\nsomething done and there's like this\npressure around you you find energy in\nthere that you never believed before\nWilliam James talks about this when he\ntalks about getting a second wind\nexplains it very eloquently when you\nfeel like your life's in danger suddenly\nyou can you can leap over things that\nyou never could leap over before so\nsunsu says put an Army on death ground\nand it will fight and until it's it wins\nmeaning put an army with its back to the\nocean or a back to the mountain and it's\neither win or die they're going to fight\n10 times harder you're going to find the\nenergy in you that you normally lack\nwhen death is facing ing you in the face\nor urgency or deadlines or people\npressing in on you when that barometric\npressure loosens up and there's none of\nit you think you have all the time in\nthe world you get nothing\ndone wow man I'm\n23 I've got all these years ahead of me\nI'm going to figure it out right I'm not\ngoing to die I got 50 70 80 years ahead\nof me no you don't that pressure now is\ngone and you're wasting time you're\nyou're you're doing all sorts of things\nthat aren't leading to any kind of skill\nyou're not learning or anything you need\nto put yourself on death ground you need\nto feel that barometric pressure which\nis the actual reality the actual reality\nis you could die tomorrow you could have\na stroke tomorrow you you could be fired\ntomorrow everything could fall apart you\nneed to have that sense of urgency now\nbecause that's the reality you're\nfooling yourself by thinking you have\nall of this time and so when you feel\nthat\npressure suddenly you can move mountains\nyou you have energy your life you know\nyou just have Focus Etc neurologically\neverything Clicks in you know and people\nwho've had that experience where they've\nwhere they've felt like the the ship was\ngoing under and they better get their\nact together and survive they talk about\nall these physical processes I have a\nstory in my new book I I hope I'm not\nboring you with all no quite the\nopposite about a mountain\nclimber who\num he he he was climbing this mountain\nby himself and he was having a great\ntime but there was a storm coming and he\nhad to get down and he suddenly fell and\nhe cut his leg open massively and there\nwas like a branch sticking in it and he\nhe broke all these bones and he was he\nwas going to die he was on a Ledge he\ncould see that it was getting dark and\nand storm clouds were were massing there\nwas going to be this was in the Rocky\nMountain Mountain he was alone and\nsuddenly he managed to get up on his two\nfeet and he can't explain how but all of\nthis energy all this adrenaline started\nflowing in him and he said he was like a\nmountain goat he was like going down the\nledge he he jumped he was able to kind\nof get down to another ledge he he got\nhe got out of it and for the for the\nnext 20 years it was haunted by how did\nthat happen I want that feeling again\nbecause it was actually the most static\nfeeling I had energy that I never\nsuspected in myself and so he tries\neverything to get that feeling back he\ntries climbing other mounts he tries\ngoing to to Mount Everest he tries and\nit doesn't come back and finally he kind\nof figures out the formula for it and\nwhy it happened he studies a lot of\nNeuroscience it's a great book I'm using\nit in my new book it's called bone bone\ngames it's very interesting book a lot\nof Science in it um and he got the\nfeeling back in a smaller sense but it\nwas the feeling of your life is in\ndanger I better get my act together or\nit's the end and suddenly adrenaline\ndopamine all the other things were\noccurring in him and he got and and he\nfound that energy so um that's that's\nthe ultimate kind of death ground right\nthere the human will to live is truly\nincredible and so now I have
