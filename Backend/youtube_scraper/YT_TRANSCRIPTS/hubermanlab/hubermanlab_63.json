without further\nado, let's get\nto answering your questions.\nThe first question is\nabout colds and flus.\nAnd the question\nspecifically is,\nwhy is it that we get more colds\nand flus in the winter months?\nIs it the temperature outside?\nIs it the fact that people are\nspending more time indoors?\nOr is it a myth that we get more\ncolds and flus in the winter\nmonths?\nWell, the first thing is that\nthe research very clearly\nshows that in winter\nmonths there is a greater\nprevalence of colds and flus.\nNow, of course, the words,\n\"in the winter months\"\nmeans many things.\nFor instance, in most areas\nof the world unless you\nlive directly near the\nequator, in the winter\nmonths means that days\nare going to be shorter\nand nights are longer\nthan in the summer months.\nIn general, that's true.\nIt's of course,\nespecially true if you\nlive very far from the equator.\nSo imagine somebody living up\nin Tromsø, Norway, which is\nvery close to the North Pole.\nIn winter, days are very,\nvery short in Tromsø.\nAnd conversely in\nthe summer months,\ndays are very, very\nlong in Tromsø Norway.\nNow, Tromsø Norway represents an\nextreme of day length variation\naccording to time of year.\nThe closer you get\nto the equator,\nthe less variation there is in\nday length and therefore night\nlength across the year.\nHowever, in most\nlocations on Earth,\ndays will be significantly\nshorter by about an hour or two\nat least for certain\nparts of the year.\nAnd in general,\nshorter days correlate\nwith colder temperatures.\nThat's what's really\nimportant to know,\nwhich is that shorter days\ngenerally correlate with colder\ntemperatures regardless of where\nyou live on the planet Earth.\nOK.\nSo in the winter months\nas we're calling it,\ninvolves at least two things,\nshorter days, which means what?\nIt means less sunlight\nand either more artificial\nlight or more darkness depending\non how much artificial light\nyou rely on.\nIt also means, as we\nmentioned, colder temperatures.\nColder temperatures, of\ncourse, doesn't necessarily\nmean that you are exposed\nto those colder temperatures\nbecause what's the third thing?\nShorter days and\ncolder temperatures\noutside mean that people are\nspending more time indoors.\nSo what the research\nclearly shows\nis that one of the reasons,\nnot the only, but one\nof the reasons for the greater\nprevalence of colds and flus\nin the short days a.k.a.\nwinter months of the\nyear is that people\nare spending more time\nindoors and therefore\nat closer proximity, which\nraises a whole bunch of really\ninteresting questions\nthat have been explored\nin the peer reviewed research\nabout proximity cold and flu\ntransmission.\nThere have been\nstudies for instance\nwhere people come into the\nlaboratory who are suffering\nfrom cold and flu and are\nsneezing, having them sneeze\nat different proximity\nto other people,\nobviously people are\ndoing this under consent.\nThey're agreeing\nto participate in\nthese particular experiments.\nAnd there does seem to be\na very nice relationship\nbetween physical\ndistance between you,\nthe uninfected person,\nand the sneezing,\ncoughing, nose\nwiping, eye wiping,\nwe'll get into why I\nmentioned all of those things\nin a moment, person that\nis suffering from the flu.\nIn other words,\nthe closer you are\nto somebody who's\nsneezing or coughing,\nthe higher probability that you\nwill contract that cold or flu.\nOK.\nSo we've already\nestablished two things.\nFirst of all, physical\nproximity is a key variable\nin terms of transmission\nof cold and flu.\nAnd at some level that's a duh.\nI mean, if you think about\nit, if you're in the next room\nor down the hallway from\nor across the street\nfrom somebody with\na cold or flu,\nyou don't expect to contract\nthat cold or flu from them.\nWhereas if you're\nin the same vehicle\nwith them or you're sitting\nnext to them on an airplane\nor you are on the same bus or\nin the same classroom as them\nand they are sneezing\nand coughing,\nwell, then, the probability that\nyou would get that cold or flu\nfrom them is increased.\nThat's just obvious.\nBut the studies that have\nexplored the relationship\nbetween physical proximity and\ntransmission of cold and flu\nhave actually analyzed things\ndown to the range of well,\nif you're standing\none foot apart\nor you're standing three\nfeet apart or six feet apart,\nwhat's the probability that you\nwill contract that cold or flu?\nAnd it follows a very\ndirect relationship\nwhere the closer the\nproximity, the more likely\nthat you're going\nto contract the cold\nor flu from that person.\nAnd of course, anything like\nexchange of skin contact\nor exchange of saliva\nbecause obviously in cases\nof romantic relationships\nwhere people will kiss\nor in familial relationships or\nfriendships where people hug,\nany contact also further\nincreases the transmission\nof cold and flu.\nNot just from stuff emitted\nfrom the nasal passages\nand from the mouth when\npeople sneeze and cough,\nbut also when people\nwipe their eyes,\neven when people wipe their\nskin because oftentimes they\nhave cold or flu\nvirus on their skin.\nIt doesn't always survive\nterribly long on the skin.\nBut if they wipe their\nface or wipe their nose\nor are using tissues\nand then don't\nwash their hands\nthoroughly afterwards,\nindeed they can transmit\ncold and flu simply\nthrough handshake.\nOK.\nSo for all you\nhypochondriacs out there,\nI'm arming you with a\nlot of useful knowledge\nthat will justify\nstaying away from people\nwho perhaps have cold and flu.\nNow, this particular point\nabout proximity and people\nbeing indoors more\nduring the winter months,\nand that's why there's more\ncold and flu transmission,\nraises a whole bunch of\ninteresting questions,\nand, in fact, protocols that I\nplan to cover in a Huberman Lab\npodcast episode solely\ndevoted to colds and flus\nand how to avoid\ngetting colds and flus.\nBut one brief mention\nor telegraph of what\nI plan to cover\nin that episode is\nthat if people are telling\nyou that they are sneezing\nand coughing due to a cold or\nflu but that they are quote\nunquote \"not contagious\"\neither because they\nare early in the cold or flu\nor late in the cold or flu\nand they have these theories\nor claims that oh, I'm\nno longer contagious.\nKeep in mind that any time\nsomeone is sneezing or coughing\nthey are in fact contagious.\nSo I'll get back to\nthat in that full length\nepisode about colds and flus.\nBut I felt it was\ntoo important not\nto mention right now that\npeople's theories about when\nthey are quote\nunquote \"contagious\"\nor \"not contagious\" are\nrarely substantiated\nby the actual data.\nThe actual data\npoint to the fact\nthat when people are\nsneezing and coughing,\nif it's due to a cold or flu,\nthey are still contagious.\nOK.\nSo we've established that\ncold outside means people tend\nto be indoors more\nwhich increases\nphysical proximity, which\nis one of the reasons\nwhy there's more cold\nand flu transmission.\nOne of the other reasons\nwhy being indoors more\ntends to increase cold\nand flu transmission\nis that in the cold months of\nwinter when people are indoors,\nthey tend to be not\nunder air conditioning,\nnot at neutral temperatures,\nbut rather they\ntend to be in heated rooms.\nAnd depending on\nthe type of heating\nthat's used, but in general,\ndue to all forms of heating,\nthe heated air tends\nto be drier air.\nNow, this is a little\nbit counterintuitive\nbecause if you ever go outside\non a really cold winter day,\nyou will realize\nthat the cold weather\noutdoors is extremely dry.\nYou can almost quote unquote\n\"feel the dryness of the air.\"\nAnd if you can't quote unquote\n\"feel the dryness of the air\"\nor imagine what that's\nlike just imagine this,\nthink of yourself outdoors\non a very cold winter\nday taking a brisk walk.\nThen think about yourself\ntaking that same brisk walk\non a very humid summer day.\nHumidity is, of course,\nthe concentration\nof water in the ambient\nenvironment, the air,\nwhereas the dryness is\nthe lack of humidity.\nAnd just that little simple\nGedankenNet or thought\nexperiment will\nremind you just how\ndry the cold air is out of\ndoors during the winter months.\nWhereas indoors we're\nheating that air\nand indeed the heating\nof that air does\nhave the property of drying\nthe nasal and oral passages\nbut especially the\nnasal passages.\nSo another key\nreason why there's\nmore transmission of colds\nand flus in the winter months\nis because people are\nspending more time indoors.\nAnd oftentimes the way\nthose indoor environments\nare being heated is drying\nout the nasal passages.\nAnd the nasal passages\nrepresent a primary site\nof defense for viral\ninfections like colds and flus\nbut also bacterial infections\nand fungal infections\nfor that matter.\nNow, I've talked before on this\npodcast about the importance\nof using nasal breathing\nunder any conditions where\nyou don't have to breathe\nthrough your mouth.\nSo if you are not eating,\nif you're not speaking,\nor if you're not exercising\nhard which by the way\noftentimes requires that you\nbreathe through your mouth.\nThere's nothing wrong with\nbreathing through your mouth\nif you're exercising\nhard and you\nneed to breathe\nthrough your mouth\nin order to bring\nin enough oxygen.\nThere are conditions under which\nthat's entirely appropriate.\nYou can learn more about\nthat in the podcast episode\nI did all about breathing\nand breath work.\nBut for the most part it's\nbest to be a nasal breather\nexcept under the conditions\nI just mentioned.\nWhy?\nWell, the nasal passages contain\na number of physical barriers,\nincluding the hairs\nwithin your nose.\nI know that hairs in\nthe nose, especially\nif they are super\nnumerous are not\nconsidered aesthetically nice.\nPeople will trim\nthem, et cetera.\nBut those hairs in\nyour nose actually\nserve as a barrier\ntoward infection.\nThis is well established.\nThe lining of the nose, the\nmucosal lining of the nose\ncontains a lot of things.\nFirst of all, it acts as\nits own physical barrier\nand physical trap for incoming\nviruses, fungal infections,\nand bacterial infections.\nThey literally get trapped\nin the nasal passages.\nAnd therefore can't enter\ndeeper into your physiology.\nAnd right now is\nnot the time to go\ninto the whole\nanatomy and physiology\nof the nasal passages.\nBut keep in mind if\nyou saw the episode\nthat I did with Noam Sobel\nor you listen to the episode\nthat I did on olfaction,\nboth of those episodes\nhighlight the fact that\nyour brain sits not\nfar behind your nasal passages.\nThere's a bony barrier there\ncalled the cribriform plate,\nand there are some\nother things as well,\nbut it's not far from your\nnostrils to your brain.\nAnd it is not far\nfrom your nostrils\nto the rest of your\nrespiratory pathway, of course.\nAnd so the hairs of your\nnostrils, the mucus itself,\nand the microbiome,\nthe trillions\nof little micro\nbacteria that thrive\nin the mucosal lining of\nyour nasal passages actually\nserve to protect against many\nof the incoming infections.\nThis is why it's so\nimportant to keep\nthe mucosal lining of your nasal\npassages thriving and intact.\nHow do you do that?\nWell, one of the\nbest ways to do that\nis to make sure that the\nair that you're breathing\nis sufficiently humidified.\nSo while there are many\ndifferent claims out there\nabout how to avoid\ncolds and flus,\nas long as we're having a\ndiscussion about why there\nare more colds and flus\nin the winter months\nbecause indeed there\nare, it's worth\nmentioning that if you\nsuffer from colds and flus\nand you're going to\nspend a lot of time\nin particular\nindoor environment,\nyou might be wise to find a\nair humidifier, something that\nbrings more moisture\ninto the air\nthat you're breathing especially\nat night while you're sleeping.\nNow, that's not going to prevent\nthe person in your environment\nwho happens to\nhave a cold or flu\nand is sneezing actively from\ntransmitting that cold or flu.\nBut it will keep\nyour nasal passages\nand the rest of your\nrespiratory pathways\nas healthy as they can\nbe and as resistant\nas they can be to\nany colds or flues\nthat you might be fighting off.\nAnd this is another\nkey point, which\nis regardless of\nwhether or not it's\nthe winter months or the\nother months of the year,\nall day long you're combating\ndifferent types of infections.\nDifferent types\nof viral, fungal,\nand bacterial infections\nare bombarding your system\nand your immune\nsystem counters that\nboth through physical\nand through neurochemical\nand hormonal and pure\nimmune mechanisms.\nOK.\nThere's a whole discussion\nof this in the episode\nthat I did on the immune system.\nWe'll do more on this.\nBut keeping the air that\nyou breathe especially\nat night sufficiently\nhumidified is one great way\nto try and offset colds and\nflus that you might be combating\nbecause you brought\nthat cold or flu\nhome from work and your immune\nsystem needs to ward it off.\nOK.\nIf you are having a\nhard time grasping\nhow it is that you could\nbring home a cold or flu\nand then ward it\noff, do you have it?\nDo you not have?\nIt is it sitting there trying\nto get into your system?\nOr do you have it a little bit?\nWell, this is some\nof the gray area\naround cold and flu and\nviral transmission generally.\nI mean, we don't\nknow, for instance,\nif you got a mild\nsniffle as opposed\nto a really bad cold\nor flu whether or not\nit would have been a\nreally bad cold or flu,\nhad you slept less, had you\nnot humidified your air better,\net cetera.\nProbably it would be.\nAnd if you've ever not\nslept well for a little bit\nand you're sick, you\nexperienced just how much worse\nthat sickness feels.\nThe symptoms of that sickness\ngo from very mild to moderate\nor from mild to\nmoderate to very severe\nwhen you are sleep deprived.\nThat said, it's also clear that\nsome strains of the cold or flu\ncan be more mild than other\nstrains of the cold or flu.\nSo this can be pretty nuanced.\nAnd we'll go deeper\ninto this in the episode\nthat I do on cold and flu and\nhow to avoid cold and flu.\nBut nasal breathing whenever\npossible day and night time\nis extremely important for\nencouraging the overall health\nand resistance of\nyour respiratory\npathways to incoming cold and\nflu and other types of viruses.\nSimilarly, humidifying the air\nthat you breathe especially\nat night but perhaps also during\nthe day in your OFS environment\nor home environment can also be\nvery beneficial for warding off\ncolds and flus.\nAnd if you'd like to read more\nabout the nasal versus mouth\nbreathing components\nof colds or flus,\nI'll just mention one\npaper now and again, I'll\ngo into this in more depth in\nthe future episode on colds\nand flus.\nBut I want to mention that\nthis is a bidirectional effect,\nmeaning people who deliberately\nbreathe through their nose\ntend to get fewer\ncolds and flus.\nAlso people who tend to\nbreathe through their mouth\nmore tend to get\nmore colds and flus.\nNow, you might think that's\nthe same thing or just\ntwo sides of the same coin.\nBut actually it's not.\nThere's what we call a\ndouble dissociation whereby\nif people are mouth\nbreathers, they\nare far more susceptible\nto colds and flus\nand other types of\nrespiratory illnesses.\nI'll put a link to\none particular paper\nthat I like a lot in the\nshow note captions entitled\nassociation of oral breathing\nwith dental malocclusions\nand general health in children.\nThis paper explores a\nlot of different things\nabout nasal versus mouth\nbreathing all of which,\nby the way point\nto the fact that\nnasal breathing whenever\npossible is better for us\nhealth wise, aesthetically,\ndental health wise\nthan is mouth breathing.\nBut one of the key\ncomponents here and this is\nwhy I bring it up in the\ncontext of this discussion\nis quote \"oral breathing is\nrelated to a significantly\nhigher prevalence of allergies\nand a significantly more likely\ngetting sick and taking\nmedication for being sick.\"\nOK.\nSo lots in this study,\nlots in related studies.\nBut nonetheless, being a nasal\nbreather, humidifying your air,\npaying attention\nto whether or not\nyou're indoors with people\nwho are coughing and sneezing\nbecause it's cold outside,\nall of those things\nare going to be\nrelevant perhaps keeping\na little bit of distance,\nmaybe a lot of distance\nfrom those people or encouraging\nthem to wash their hands\nafter they wipe their nose.\nMaybe even sending them to a\nlittle bit of not necessarily\nisolation although\nthat might be necessary\nbut keeping them at a distance.\nI don't think it's too\nmuch to ask somebody\nwho's sick to not get you sick.\nPersonally I think that's the\npolite thing to try and do.\nAnd there's actually\nnot many things ruder\nthan someone who\nknows that they're\nsick showing up to something\nbecause they didn't want\nto miss that particular event\nand getting everybody else sick\nfrankly, that's my opinion.\nI think that opinion is\nshared with many of you\nout there as well.\nNow, as I mentioned earlier,\nwhen it's cold outside,\nthe air tends to be drier.\nNot always.\nI mean, you could live\nin an environment that's\nvery cold and very rainy,\nobviously very rainy\nis very humid.\nIt's maximum humidity\nif you think about it.\nBut if you are going\nto spend time out\nof doors in cold days of\nwinter, which by the way,\nis a really good thing\nfor other reasons,\nI'll get into those\nreasons in a moment\nbecause they relate\ndirectly to why there's\nsuch a prevalence\nof colds and flus\nbecause in general,\npeople are not doing what\nI'm about to tell you to do.\nBut there are two things\nto keep in mind if you're\ngoing to be out of doors.\nFirst of all, the things\nabout proximity still hold.\nThere have been\nstudies of people\nwho have colds and flus\nsneezing in indoor environments\nversus outdoor environments and\nhow much transmission there is.\nAgain, it boils\ndown to proximity.\nYes, you can get a cold or\nflu from somebody sneezing out\nof doors next to\nyou just as well\nas you can if they\nsneeze next to you\nindoors There's a slightly\nhigher probability that you'll\nget it from them if they're\nsneezing at that same distance\nbut you're indoors as opposed\nto outdoors obviously sneezers,\ncoughers-- sneeze and cough\nin the other direction,\ncover your mouth and nose.\nIf you don't have a tissue\nor something, we are told\nand I subscribe to the idea\nthat sneezing into your elbow\nor coughing into your elbow\nis probably the next best\nthing to not covering up at all,\nas opposed to into your hand,\nwhich then you touch\nother things and yourself.\nAnyway, without getting into\nthe mechanics of sneezing\nand coughing too\ndeeply, if you're\ngoing to be outside in\nthe cold winter months\nand you'd like to avoid getting\ncolds and flus, when you run,\nwhen you exercise,\nwhen you walk,\nwhen you're in conversation,\ntry to nasal breathe unless you\nhave to mouth breathe.\nAnd if you can sense your\nnasal passages or your mouth\ndrying out because of\nthat hard breathing,\nand by the way exercise\nduring the winter\nmonths is still important.\nSo I'm not discouraging people\nfrom exercising outdoors\nduring the winter months as\nlong as you can do it safely.\nBut if you feel those\nair passages drying out,\njust be aware that when\nyou take those dried out\nair passages in doors and\nyou're around other people that\nmight have colds\nand flus, you are\ngoing to be more susceptible.\nSo that's cause for taking a\nhot shower, perhaps if you have\naccess to a steam\nroom or humidifier,\nand rehydrating those\nnasal and oral passages.\nNow, if you're\noutside and running\nand you're breathing hard and\nyour nasal passages are drying\nout, does that mean that you're\nmore susceptible to colds\nand flus that are just\nout in that environment\nif no one else is around?\nChances are no.\nHowever, what we\nwere all told when\nwe were kids which is if you\ngo outside and you get a chill,\nit's a good idea when\nyou come back inside\nto take a hot\nshower or a hot bath\nor if you have access to\nit a sauna to heat back up.\nThat's also true, why?\nWell, it does seem that\nthere's a relationship\nbetween core body temperature\nand susceptibility\nto cold and flu.\nAnd this is something\nI'm going to go\ndeeply into in the\nepisode on colds and flus.\nKeep in mind that fevers that\nare the response to exposure\nto a cold or flu or being full\nblown sick with a cold and flu\nare an attempt of your immune\nsystem to heat up that virus\nand destroy it.\nKeep that in mind if\nyou're considering\ntaking any medication to\nlower your fever, of course,\nknow that highly elevated\nbody temperatures a.k.a. fever\ncan be very dangerous\nto the brain and body.\nThere's a fairly\nlimited upper range\nof temperatures that we\ncan go into before we\nstart damaging ourselves.\nBut also keep in mind that\nfever is an adaptation designed\nto destroy viruses.\nSo if you blunt the\nfever, you are actually\nletting a cold or\nvirus to proliferate\nmore readily than it\nwould if you allowed\na slight fever to combat that.\nOK.\nSo there's a whole discussion to\nbe had there because obviously\nyou don't want people\ncooking their brains\ndue to elevated fever and\nnot treating that fever.\nBut you also don't want\nto reduce your core body\ntemperature too much which\nraises the question of things\nlike cold plunges.\nShould you be\ntaking cold showers\nand doing cold plunges\nin the winter months\nwhen it's already cold and\nyou're susceptible to colds\nand maybe you're coming\ndown with a cold,\nshould you do that?\nWell, that segues\ninto the next question\nthat I'm going to answer\nfor this AMA, which relates\ndirectly to cold exposure\nand so-called cyclic\nhyperventilation breathing\nsometimes associated\nwith so-called Wim Hof breathing\nbut other forms of deliberate\nbreathing as well.\nAnd how specific forms of\ndeliberate breathing and how\ndeliberate cold\nexposure can indeed\nbe used to offset or even\nprevent entirely infection\ndue to bacterial or viruses.\nBut if you're\nalready coming down\nwith a bacterial\nor viral infection,\nwhy cyclic hyperventilation\nbreathing or why deliberate\ncold exposure may actually\nbe the worst thing\nif you are already contracting\nor have contracted,\nif you are contracting or\nhave already contracted\na cold or virus.\nSo we'll answer\nthat question next.\nIn the meantime, just know\nthat yes, indeed in the winter\nmonths you are more\nsusceptible to colds and flus\nbecause there's more\nof them going around.\nWe talked about some of\nthe reasons why they're\ngoing around, and\nsome of the things\nyou can do to protect yourself\nagainst those colds and flus.\nThere are a bunch\nof other things\nthat you can do that are very\nvaluable that will explore\nin the full length\nepisode on colds and flus\nand how to avoid getting them.\nAnd I'm hoping you all\nstay clear of colds\nand flus these winter months.\nAnd now you have some\ntools to try and reduce\nthe duration and severity\nof those colds and flus\nshould you get one.\nThank you for
