    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Zachary\nKnight Dr Zachary Knight is a professor\nof physiology at the University of\nCalifornia San Francisco and an\ninvestigator with the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute for those of you that\ndon't know Howard Hughes medical\ninvestigators are selected from an\nextremely competitive pool of applicants\nand have to renew in order to maintain\ntheir investigatorship with the Howard\nHughes Medical Institute every 5 years\nor so placing him in the most elite of\ncategories with respect to research\nscientists his laboratory focuses on\nhomeostasis in particular what drives\nour sense of hunger what drives our\nsense of thirst and what controls therm\nregulation which is the ability to\nmaintain body temperature within a\nspecific safe range today we mainly\nfocus on Hunger Dr Zachary Knight\nexplains the biological mechanisms for\ncraving food for consuming food and\nbelieve it or not you have brain\ncircuits that actually determine how\nmuch you're likely to eat even before\nyou take your very first bite and he\nexplains the biological mechanisms for\nsatiety that is the sense that one has\nhad enough of a particular food or food\ngroup Dr Knight also explains the role\nof dopamine in food craving and\nconsumption which I think every\neverybody will find very surprising\nbecause it runs countercurrent to most\npeople's understanding of what dopamine\ndoes in the context of eating and other\nCravings today's discussion also\nincludes a deep dive into glp1\nglucagonlike peptide and the novel class\nof drugs such as OIC and monjaro and\nother related compounds that are now\nwidespread in use for the reduction in\nbody weight Dr Knight explains how glp1\nwas first discovered and how these drugs\nwere developed how they work and\nimportantly why they work and how that\nis leading to the next generation of\nso-called diet drugs or drugs to treat\nobesity diabetes and related syndromes\nwe also discussed thirst and the\nintimate relationship between water\nconsumption and food consumption and we\nalso talk about the relationship between\nsodium intake water intake and food\nintake by the end of today's\nconversation you will have learned a\ntremendous amount about the modern\nunderstanding of hunger thirst and salt\nintake as well as this modern class of\ndrugs such as OIC and related compounds\nall from a truly world-class\ninvestigator in the subjects of\nresearching hunger thirst and thermal\nregulation before you begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is better help\nbetter help offers Professional Therapy\nwith a licensed therapist carried out\nentirely online I've been doing weekly\ntherapy for well over 30 years initially\nI didn't have a choice it was a\ncondition of being allowed to stay in\nhigh school but quickly I realized that\ntherapy is an extremely important\ncomponent to our overall health in fact\nI consider doing regular therapy as\nimportant as getting regular\ncardiovascular exercise and resistance\ntraining which of course I also do every\nweek now there are essentially three\nthings that great therapy provides first\nof all it requires that you have a\nreally good rapport with the therapist\nsomebody that you can trust and talk to\nabout what's really going on in your\nlife and of course an excellent\ntherapist will provide you support in\nmoving towards the things that are going\nto grow your life in the best ways and\nthird and this is the one that people\noften Overlook an expert therapist is\nsomebody who can really provide you\nuseful insights that would not otherwise\nbe obvious to you with better help they\nmake it very easy to find the therapist\nwith whom you can have those three\nessential and highly

brought\nTo Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes\nSmart mattress covers with cooling\nHeating and sleep tracking capacity now\nI've spoken many times before in this\npodcast about the critical need for us\nto get adequate amounts of quality sleep\neach night one of the best ways to\nensure a great night sleep is to control\nthe temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's because in order\nto fall and stay deeply asleep your body\ntemperature actually has to drop by\nabout 1 to 3° and in order to wake up\nfeeling refreshed and energized your\nbody temperature actually has to\nincrease by about 1 to 3° eight sleep\nmakes it incredibly easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nby allowing you to program the\ntemperature of your mattress cover at\nthe beginning middle and end of the\nnight I've been sleeping on an eight-\nSleep mattress cover for well over 3\nyears now and it has completely\ntransformed my sleep for the better\neight sleep recently launched their\nnewest generation pod cover the Pod 4\nUltra the Pod 4 ultra has improved\ncooling and heating capacity higher\nFidelity sleep tracking technology and\nit also has snoring detection that\nremarkably will automatically lift your\nhead a few degrees to improve your air\nflow and stop your snoring if you'd like\nto try an eight Sleep mattress cover you\ncan go to

also brought To Us by\nwaking up waking up is a meditation app\nthat offers hundreds of guided\nmeditation programs mindfulness\ntrainings yoga NRA sessions and more I\nstarted practicing meditation when I was\nabout 15 years old and it made a\nprofound impact on my life and by now\nthere are thousands of quality peer\nreviewed studies that emphasize how\nuseful mindfulness meditation can be for\nimproving our Focus managing stress and\nanxiety improving our mood and much more\nin recent years I started using the we\nwaking up app for my meditations because\nI find it to be a terrific resource for\nallowing me to really be consistent with\nmy meditation practice many people start\na meditation practice and experience\nsome benefits but many people also have\nchallenges keeping up with that practice\nwhat I and so many other people love\nabout the waking up app is that it has a\nlot of different meditations to choose\nfrom and those meditations are of\ndifferent durations so it makes it very\neasy to keep up with your meditation\npractice both from the perspective of\nnovelty you never get tired of those\nmeditations there's always something new\nto EXP explore and to learn about\nyourself and about the effectiveness of\nmeditation and you can always fit\nmeditation into your schedule even if\nyou only have two or 3 minutes per day\nin which to meditate I also really like\ndoing Yoga Nidra or what is sometimes\ncalled non-sleep deep rest for about 10\nor 20 minutes because it is a great way\nto restore mental and physical Vigor\nwithout the tiredness that some people\nexperience when they wake up from a\nconventional nap if you'd like to try\nthe waking up app please go to waking\nup.com huberman where you can access a\nfree 30-day trial again that's waking\nup.com huberman to access a free 30-day\ntrial and now for my discussion with Dr\nZachary Knight Dr Zachary Knight welcome\ngreat to be here today we're going to\ntalk about Hunger appetite thirst other\nmotivated behaviors the role of dopamine\nthe vagus nerve these are terms and\ntopics that a lot of people hear\nnowadays and for which there's a ton of\ninterest but just to March Us in\nsequentially\ncould you describe some of what's\nhappening in the brain and our body as\nwe get hungry decide what to eat and and\ndecide that we've had enough to eat you\nI think most people just assume that\nokay that my stomach's full is what we\nsay I've had enough um or we\nself-regulate it for some other reason\nyou know caloric restriction or or\nmonitoring in some\ncases what's happening in the brain in\nterms of the circuitry\num and what have you discovered about\nwhat that process looks like in terms of\nits um kind of universality across\npeople and then maybe how it sometimes\ndiffers between people okay there's a\nlot in that that I'll try to unpack and\nI can remind of some of the Nuance but\njust in other words as a biologist as a\nneuroscientist how do you think about\nthis thing that we call hunger and Fe\nabsolutely absolutely so I think a very\nhigh level a good way to think about the\nregulation of food intake by the brain\nis that there's two systems uh\nshort-term system and a long-term system\nthat are primarily localized to\ndifferent parts of the brain operate on\ndifferent time scales one on the time\nscale of a meal so 10 20 minutes uh and\nthe other on the time scale of sort of\nweeks to months to years and tracks\nlevels of body fat and these two systems\nsort of interact so that so that these\nshort-term behaviors we do eating are\nmatched to our long-term need for energy\nand so um uh uh I think one of the uh uh\none of the initial experiments that\nreally led to this idea is this great\nexperiment by Harvey Grill um about 50\nyears ago uh it's called the desate rat\nand so essentially what he did was he\nmade a a cut in the rat brain so he took\nthese rats in the lab made a cut so that\nhe separated the brain stem so the most\nposterior part of the brain from the\nentire forbrain basically got rid of you\nknow 80% of the rat's brain so this\nbasically creating these zombie rats\nright all they have is a brain stem and\nasked you know what can these rats still\ndo\nyou might imagine they can't do a lot of\nthings right because they basically have\nlost most of their brain um but he\ndiscovered that one thing they can still\ndo is regulate the size of a meal and so\num so very informative experiment and so\num and and you have to be careful how we\ntalk about this because the way this\nmeal works is you have to actually put\nfood into their mouth and then they'll\nswallow it as you put food into their\nmouth um but eventually at some point\nthey'll start spitting it out and that\nbasically is an indication that in some\nsense they're becoming saded uh and and\nthey're uh they're just using the brain\nstem that they have left they're able to\nsense those signals from the gut and uh\nDrive the termination of a meal and he\ndid other experiments showing that many\nof these signals that come from the gut\ngastric stretch hormones that come from\nyour intestine in response to food\nintake like cck these desate rats that\njust have a brain stem um if you inject\nthose or manipulate the gut in in those\nways it can in an appropriate way change\nhow much the rat\neats now what can't the rat do when it\ndoesn't have a forebrain and the thing\nit can't do is it can't respond to\nlonger term changes in energy need\nmeaning if you fast the rat for a couple\ndays this desate rat then start putting\nfood in its mouth the amount that it\neats doesn't change so basically it\ndoesn't eat a larger meal the way you\nwould if you were fasted for several\ndays and then re\nrefed and that experiment along with\nother Evans has led to the idea that in\nthe brain stem and in the most posterior\npart of your brain there are neural\ncircuits that control sort of a meal and\nthen the time scale of 10 minutes or 20\nminutes deciding when a meal should end\nand in the forbrain primarily in the\nhypothalamus there are neural circuits\nthat then track what is my overall level\nof energy reserves what is my level of\nbody fat things that would fluctuate on\ntime scale of say days when you're\nfasting and those forbrain centers\nfeedback to talk to the brain stem and\nmodulate those brain stem circuit that\nare controlling the size of a meal to\nsort of match these two time scales so\nthat's at the highest level how I think\nabout the neural circuitry that controls\nfeeding um there's obviously a lot more\ngoing on underneath that but f ating you\nmentioned body fat and that somehow the\nbrain is tracking the amount of body fat\num that caught my ear uh because while\nit makes total sense I'd like to know\nhow that happens if we happen to know\nthe mechanism and the second question is\nwhy body fat and not body fat and\nmuscular mass or body fat and overall\nbody\nweight what is being signaled between\nbody fat and the Brain that allows the\nbrain to track body fat and why do you\nthink body fat is the critical signal I\nrealize it represents an energy Reserve\nbut certainly there are other things\nabout the bodily state that are\nimportant yeah well there are certainly\nother things about the bodily state that\nare important and there are other things\nabout physiology definitely that are\nregulated other than body fat um but\nbody fat is is unique because it\nrepresents this energy Reserve so the\nneural circuitry that regulates eating\nbehavior is in some ways very unique\nbecause it has this reserve of energy so\nif you we also study thirst in my lab\nand drinking and you don't have a\nreserve of water in your body right um\nand that's true for basically everything\nelse but for fat we have this this this\nreserve of energy and so it's very\nimportant that uh the brain know uh how\nmuch remains and then adjust Behavior Uh\nuh uh in coordinance with that so that\nso that you know you know how urgent it\nis to get the next meal um and so the\nthought is that the major signal of the\nlevel of body fat that we have is leptin\nit's this hormone uh it was discovered\nit was cloned in 1994 actually by my\npost-doctoral adviser a scientist named\nJeff Friedman at Rockefeller University\nalthough its history goes back way\nbefore 1994 so the story behind leptin\nis that um there's a a facility called\nJackson Labs that you I'm sure familiar\nwith in Maine that um since the 1920s\nhas been raising mice and selling them\nto academics basically who study\nphysiology and\nbehavior and so they breed thousands of\nmice they sort of nonprofit organization\ndistributes mice to the scientific\ncommunity and at some point in the 1950s\num they spontaneously just because they\nwere breeding so many mice they came\nacross some spontaneous mutations um\nmutant mice that were extremely fat like\nthe fattest mice they had ever seen\nthese mice just eat constantly they're\njust enormous three times the size of of\na normal Mouse and um it's all body fats\nthey're just justu these huge uh uh uh\nuh fat mice and they came across several\ndifferent um mut Mutant strains that um\nall had the phenotype in the sense that\nthey were all extremely fat all\nextremely hyperphagic but they could\ntell even in the 1950s that these\nmutations were on different\nchromosomes they didn't know anything\nabout how to identify the genes at that\npoint that was just science fiction but\nthey knew they were chromosomes and they\nwere on different chromosomes and so\nthey labeled one obese one of these\nMouse trins obese and the other one\ndiabetes but they're basically the same\nand so people wonder for a long time\nwhat what what's going on in these mice\nthen there was a scientist at Jackson\nLabs Doug Coleman who had the idea what\nif we do an experiment where we connect\nthe circulations of these two different\nstrains of obese mice and test the\nhypothesis that maybe there's a\ncirculating factor a hormone that is\nproduced by one of these strains and\nthat controls\nappetite because at that point insulin\nwas known glucagon was known there were\nsome hormones that were known that were\ninvolved in metabolism so it was logical\nthat there could be a hormone that uh\nperhaps regulates body fat levels and\nwhat they found which was was remarkable\nwhen you attach the OB strain to the DB\nstrain so you basically connect their\ncirculation so hormones are are are\ntransmitted between the two um the OB\nmouse that strain dramatically loses\nweight in fact within a couple weeks it\nlooks like a normal Mouse it just stops\neating it loses almost all of its body\nfat and it essentially in all respects\nbecomes a normal Mouse the DB Mouse\nnothing really happens it Still Remains\nobese and Still Remains\nhyperphagic and based on just that piece\nof data Doug Coleman hypothesized that\nwhat was going on is these two mutations\nwere mutations in a hormone and a\nreceptor\nthe OB Mouse had a mutation in the\nrecept in the hormone that comes from\nfat so it couldn't produce this hormone\nthat comes from fat and signals to the\nbrain how much fat you have and the DB\nMouse has a mutation in the receptor so\nit can't sense the\nhormone um and that was just an idea it\nwas hypothesis um but you know in the\n1980s as technology advanced as it\nbecame you know there's molecular\nbiology had been invented it became\npossible to clone genes um a number of\npeople tried to identify what are the\ngenetic mutation\nthat are occurring in these mice that\nmake them so obese and Jeff basally\ncloned leptin and showed that in fact\nDoug was exactly right the the OB\nmutation is a mutation in this hormone\nleptin uh and later uh Millennium\nPharmaceuticals showed that the the DB\nmutation is in fact a receptor and it\nwas an important Discovery for a couple\nways for a couple reasons one because\nthis OB Gene is just expressed in fat\nit's exclusively impressed expressed in\nadapost tissue and uh how much it's\nexpressed is directly proportional to\nhow much body fat you have so as you\ngain weight the expression of this\nhormone increases in a linear manner and\nthen it's secreted into the blood so the\nlevel of leptin in your blood is a\ndirect readout of your body fat\nreserves this receptor for leptin leptin\nreceptor the the functional form of it\nis expressed almost exclusively in the\nbrain and it's expressed in all of the\nbrain regions that we knew from previous\nwork were important for appetite so\nbasically the expression of this\nreceptor gives you a map in the brain of\nthe neurons that control hunger and so\nwhat happens is basically when you lose\nweight uh the levels of leptin in your\nblood fall because basically you've lost\nadapost tissue the absence of that\nhormone sends a signal to all these\nneurons that have leap in receptors in\nthe brain they're not getting that\nsignal that uh I'm starving and it\nbasically that initiates this entire\nhomeostatic response to starvation so a\nbig part of that is um obviously\nincreased hunger but it's also decreased\nenergy expenditure decreased body\ntemperature um even decreased fertility\num because you don't want to reproduce\nif you're starving less spontaneous\nmovement less spontaneous movement all\nof this um and so um and so the thought\nis which I think is absolutely correct\nis that this this hormone leptin is is\npart of this negative feedback loop from\nthe fat to the brain that basically\ntells you about your level of body fat\nreserves and how urgent it is to find\nthe next meal fascinating as I recall um\nAmin Pharmaceuticals own the patent for\nleptin in hopes that it would become the\nBlockbuster diet drug the logic being\nthat if you were to take this hormone\nsomehow or activate this pathway that\nthe brain would be tricked into thinking\nthat there was more body fat more energy\nreserves than there was and then people\nwould uh basically be less hungry eat\nless and lose body fat yes what happened\nwith that do we know why it did not work\nyeah so that's a great question so um\nthere was a lot of excitement when\nleptin was Clon because it was thought\nbasically we've cured obesity um there\nwas an auction for the patent amen one I\nthink it was something like $20 million\nupfront Payment Plus royalties which at\nthe time was I mean still is a lot of\nmoney but even more money nowadays it\nwould it would be um a drop in the ocean\ncompared to what companies will invest\ninto potential diet drugs ex exactly so\nbut but you know at the time um and\nstill a lot of money today um and uh\nthey did a clinical trial gave obese\npeople leptin subcutaneous injections of\nthis hormone and they didn't lose a lot\nof\nweight um and the question was why and\nso what was subsequently field is that\nthe challenge with leptin is that\nindividuals who are obese um do not have\nlow levels of leptin for the most part\nthey actually have high levels of leptin\nand so what they have is a state of\nleptin resistance so it's analogous to\nsomeone who has type two diabetes it's\nnot because they lack insulin it's\nbecause they actually have over time a\nhigh level of insulin and so Target\ntissues stop responding to insulin and\nthe thought is that it's the same way in\nobesity and leptin now subsequently they\nwent back and did um an reanalysis of\nthat clinical trial\nand ask what if you take all of these\npeople and stratify them according to\ntheir starting leptin level so some\npeople have relatively low levels of\nleptin some have higher some have really\nhigh levels of leptin and then ask if we\nreanalyze the data um how uh how\neffective is leptin and as you might\nexpect the people with the lowest levels\nof leptin they lost the most weight when\nyou gave them this drug and the peop\nwith the highest levels of leptin lost\nthe least weight so there is a rationale\nthere for why um for for a scenario in\nwhich leptin could work either among the\nsubset of people who just have for some\nreason lower levels of leptin these\naren't people with mutations like the OB\nMouse they have some leptin they just\ndon't have unusually high levels or\nalternatively after weight loss so after\nyou've lost a lot of weight your leptin\nlevels plummet they become very low and\nthat part of the reason it's a big part\nof the reason it's so difficult to keep\nweight off is because those leptin\nlevels are so low and so it's been\nthought for a long time that that that\nis a scenario where treat treating\npeople with leptin uh uh could be really\nuseful to help them keep the weight off\nwhy it never made it as a drug for that\napplication I really don't understand it\nhas something to do I think with the\npharmaceutical industry with the\neconomics with a bunch of other issues\nthat aren't necessarily\nscientific um but I think there's still\nin the future is a possibility that it\ncould come back for that indication\nespecially now that we have these gp1\ndrugs and now there's just millions of\npeople losing so much weight and perhaps\nthey want to transition to a different\nkind of drug uh to keep the weight off\nwell we are definitely going to talk\nabout glp1 OIC and um some of the\nrelated compounds in a in a few minutes\nbut before we do that I'd love to get to\nthis issue of what's happening in the\nbrain as we get hungry approach a meal\ndecide what to eat and decide when we've\nhad enough are there separate\ncircuitries or at least separate neurons\nfor each of those steps and um if you\nwould uh could you walk us through what\nthat process looks like since we do it\nevery day most people do it every day\nunless they're fasting multiple times\nper day what's going on in our brain and\nbody as we think about and approach a\nmeal consume a meal and decide enough\nsure so um there are different neurons\nthat are preferentially involved in\ndifferent aspects of those processes so\nso I think people we often divide\nfeeding behavior and many other kinds of\nmotivated behaviors into repetitive and\nconsummatory phases so appetitive is the\nphase of the behavior where you're for\nexample searching for food it's foraging\nit's all the actions that lead up to the\nactual Behavior itself which then we\ncall the consum at Phase that's actually\nputting the food in your mouth and\neating it and the general thought is\nthat these four brain circuits in the\nhypothalamus are more important\nparticularly in hypothalamus but other\nparts of the forebrain as well are more\nimportant for the repetitive phase and\nthe brain stem circuits are more\nimportant for the consummatory phase the\nactual putting it in your mouth and\nlicking chewing swallowing and all that\nwithin the hypothalamus there's a\npopulation of neurons called agrp\nneurons so it's just an acronym agrp and\nstands for a gy related p but it doesn't\nreally matter um they're absolutely\ncritical for that repetitive phase for\nthe searching for food for the desire to\nfind food and consum it when you're\nhungry um May sorry just to um touch on\nthe agrp neurons and this repetitive\nphase are they known to connect to areas\nof the brain and body that stimulate the\ndesire to move because I think about um\nwhen I get hungry if I'm at my desk or\nsomething um I need to get up and find\nfood need to walk to lunch or go to the\nrefrigerator are they somehow linked to\nthe circuits that um promote Locomotion\nwell they have to promote those things\num but they're not directly linked to\nany of those circuits they're linked\ndirectly to other forbrain circuits\ninvolved in motivation so the way we\nthink we think about you know what these\nkinds of neurons like ARR pons are doing\nthey're not directly talking to the\nmotor circuits to tell you to move your\nlegs or arms to pick up the sandwich or\nwhatever they're rather creating this\nGeneral problem that the animal has to\nsolve which is that I'm hungry I need to\nget food it would be really if I could\nhave a sandwich and then the animal uses\nall of its mental capacities right to\nsolve that problem so they're just there\nto set the goal not so much to direct\nthe\nsolution and so uh but these hrp neurons\nthere are a few thousand neurons at the\nbase of the hypothalamus so basically\nthe the the most ventral the most bottom\npart of the\nforbrain um so tiny population of cells\nbut outsized importance for the control\nof feeding Behavior so if you stimulate\nthese cells in a mouse or a rat that's\nnot hungry um the animal will\nvoraciously eat like get starving uh if\nyou silence these cells U animals will\nstarve to death so you can basically\ngive them food they just won't eat it\nvoluntarily until basically they you\nhave to euthanize them because they're\nuh they've lost so much\nweight um and the activity of these\nthese agrp\nneurons uh um is thought to track the\nbody's need for energy one reason that's\nthought is that um uh they express these\nreceptors for leptin this hormone that I\nwas just talking about that that comes\nfrom fat and signals the level of body\nfat Reserves\nand leptin inhibits agrp neurons so as\nyou might expect if you have lots of\nbody fat um then uh a neuron that\nexpresses that controls hunger should be\nless active than if you have very little\nbody fat so that's one mechanism by\nwhich leptin controls\nhunger um we my lab have investigated\nthe role of these agrp neurons um uh\nfrom a slightly different perspective\nwhich is and this relates to your\nquestion about what happens when we\napproach food when we start a meal and\nto ask what are their activity patterns\nwhat is the natural sort of firing of\nthis population of neurons when an\nanimal eats a meal it's a very basic\nquestion uh something I think we wanted\nto know for a long time um was not\nreally addressable until about 10 years\nago because just the technology didn't\nexist because these are such a tiny\npopulation of cells so deep in the brain\num so one of the very first experiments\nwe did in my lab was to investigate that\nto ask for the first time what happens\nto these arrp neurons when an animal\neats and so uh one of my first graduate\nstudents yuming Chen he uh he used a\ntechnology called fiber fetometry which\nallows us to put a fiber optic into the\nmouse's brain so then then we could\nrecord fluoresence from these agrp\nneurons which we could use as a readout\nof their activity it's basically using a\ncalcium sensor so calcium is a surrogate\nfor neural\nactivity and very one of the very first\nexperiments he did we said let's make\nthe animal hungry these ARR pons will be\nvery active because the animal's hungry\nand then let's give it some food and see\nwhat happens during a meal and our\nexpectation was that these arrp Neons\nwould gradually decline in activity as\nthe animal eats and levels of hormones\nand the Blood start changing uh feeding\nback to inhibit these\nneurons what he found was really\nsurprising I remember that when he made\nthis discovery basically him running\ninto my office and saying Zack I I I\ngave the mouse the piece of food but the\nweirdest thing happened the neurons shut\noff almost immediately and I said you\nman you've made a mistake it's okay\nyou're just starting off in graduate\nschool this happens go back and repeat\nthe experiment and then we'll discuss it\nbut he did it several times he said you\nknow is that every single time I do this\nhappens I give a Hungry Mouse food and\nthe ARR panun within just a few seconds\nuh their activity has uh greatly\ndiminished back to the level it would be\nin a Fed Mouse even before they take the\nfirst bite of food and so yuming then\nwent to do a series of experiments to\ntry to understand what was going on and\nwhat he basically showed by changing the\nkind of food he gave them or the\naccessibility of the food or how hungry\nthe mouse was and measuring the response\nof these arrp neurons was that what the\nneurons were doing was\npredicting the mouse looks at at the at\nthe food it looks at how palatable it is\nimagines how hungry the mouse is how\naccessible it is and then within a few\nseconds these neurons predict how much\nfood the mouse is going to eat in the\nforthcoming meal and so essentially\nthese neurons know how much the mouse is\ngoing to eat before the mouse even takes\nthe first bite and uh you can show this\nin very simple by very simple analysis\nin which you you give the mouse\ndifferent foods and you look at how much\nthese arrp neurons drop when the mouse\nsees and smells the food and then you\nplot that again so this this drop\nhappens in 3 seconds 4 seconds something\nlike that then you look at how much does\nthe mouse go on to eat in the next 30\nminutes and you can just draw a straight\nline this was one of the first results\nfrom my lab and it was really surprising\nto all of us and I think everyone um but\nit Illustrated a theme that we've now\nseen again and again which is that these\ncircuits that control internal State\ncontrol things like hunger and thirst\nwhat they're constantly doing is\npredicting the future they can sense\nthese signals from the body that tell\nyou about what's happened but those\nsignals are slow and and you don't want\nto wait 20 minutes from the food that\nyou ingested to reach your stomach and\nthen slowly start entering your\nintestine to figure out what was the\nnutrient content of the meal you want to\ntry to figure that out as soon as you\ncan right and so the animals learn\npresumably through just experience that\nokay something that smells like this and\nlooks like this that has about this many\ncalories and I know I'm this hungry so\nI'm going to eat about this much and\nthen that information is all transmitted\nto these circuits to start the process\nof satiation before the meal begins is\nit satiation or it's um ceasing of\nforaging so that the animal or if I\ntranslate to a person decides okay now\nI'm going to consume this sandwich this\npackage of food yeah that's a great\nquestion so um we don't fully know the\nanswer so one interpretation of the data\nI just showed you is what you exactly\nwhat you said is that what these neurons\ndo is they control foraging alone they\ndon't control eating and so this is\nperfect you see the food you know it's\ngot enough calories the neurons shut off\nand then you stay there and eat it you\ntransition from this repetitive to this\nconsummatory phase but that doesn't seem\nto be the whole explanation because if\nyou artificially stimulate these neurons\nso prevent that drop from ever happening\njust stimulate them continually the\nmuscle just sit there and eat so you\ncan't fully separate although we like to\nmake this distinction between repetitive\nand consummatory and we know that that\nthat in different parts of the brain\nthere's more important for one versus\nthe other the reality is the entire\nbehavior is linked and you can't fully\nseparate them so there's a number of\nideas about what what this means so one\nidea that I just mentioned is that\nstarting the process of satiety before\nthe meal begins another idea which which\nyou mentioned which could have could be\npart of the answer is that it is\nreducing this repetitive drive and\nallowing the transition to consummatory\nbehavior um another idea is that and I\ncall these ideas because we don't really\nfully know the answer yet for exactly\nwhat the the purpose in biology it's\nalways hard to answer why something\nhappens you can figure out what this\nhappens but then you can the reason why\nit evolved that way is challenging um\nanother idea is is it's involved in\nthese what we call spol phase responses\nthat are necessary to prepare you for a\nmeal right so this the famous example of\nthis is Pavlov right basically uh trains\nthe dog to associate the Ring of the\nbell with the uh uh uh presentation of\nfood and then eventually The Ring Of The\nBell alone causes the dog to salivate in\nthe absence of any food and salivation\nis one example of a stolic phas response\nthe purpose of that is to have enzymes\nin your mouth that basically are going\nto digest the food and get them there\nright before you need them but there's\nall sorts of other things like basically\nthe secretion of insulin occurs in\nresponse to food cues changes in gastric\nacid gut motility all these things are\ngetting ready for the for the meal to\nhappen and so another idea is is it\ncould be part of that but probably it's\ndoing all of these things as many of you\nknow I've been taking age G1 for more\nthan 10 years now so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring this podcast to be\nclear I don't take ag1 because they're a\nsponsor rather they are a sponsor\nbecause I take ag1 in fact I take ag1\nonce and often twice every single day\nand I've done that since starting way\nback in 2012 there is so much\nconflicting information out there\nnowadays about what proper nutrition is\nbut here's what there seems to be a\ngeneral consensus on whether you're an\nomnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a\nvegan I think it's generally agreed that\nyou should get most of your food from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources which allows you to eat enough\nbut not overeat get plenty of vitamins\nand minerals probiotics and\nmicronutrients that we all need for\nphysical and mental health now I\npersonally am an omnivore and I strive\nto get most of my food from unprocessed\nor minimally processed sources but the\nreason I still take ag1 once and often\ntwice every day is that it ensures I get\nall of those vitamins minerals\nprobiotics Etc but it also has\nadaptogens to help me cope with with\nstress it's basically a nutritional\ninsurance policy meant to augment not\nreplace quality food so by drinking a\nserving of ag1 in the morning and again\nin the afternoon or evening I cover all\nof my foundational nutritional needs and\nI like so many other people that take\nag1 report feeling much better in a\nnumber of important ways such as energy\nlevels digestion sleep and more so while\nmany supplements out there are really\ndirected towards obtaining one specific\noutcome ag1 is foundational nutrition\ndesigned to support all aspects of\nwellbeing related to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink a1.com huberman to\nclaim a special offer they'll give you\nfive free travel packs with your order\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2\nagain that's drink a1.com slh huberman\nit's so interesting I have a number of\nquestions but I think the one that I'll\nuh put at the top of the list is the\nother night we were out to dinner in New\nYork and um I was very hungry I hadn't\neaten much that day and I was looking\nforward to a nice steak uh they brought\nout bread french bread it was French\nrestaurant I took one bite I realized it\nwas absolutely delicious French bread\nthe butter was fantastic and so I had\nsome bread and butter which I love yes\nthen they brought more and then they\nstarted bringing out I don't know who\nordered them cuz I didn't appetizers and\nI realized that this was going to be a\nmuch\nmore extensive calorically dense meal\nand suddenly my appetite for the\nappetizers I it sort of went down\nbecause I I knew knew there was more\nfood coming right yes had I not known\nthat there was more food coming I think\nI would have consumed more of the\nappetizers which also looked great so\nclearly there's something going on with\nthese agrp neurons the moment you're\nsort of um integrating based on new\ninformation exactly um on the other end\nof the spectrum um I did a solo episode\nabout eating disorders in anorexia\nnervosa in particular and one of the\nthings that I learned from experts in\nthat field the psychiatrist who work on\nthis and the scientists who work on this\nis that um people with\nanorexia are unbelievably tuned to the\ncaloric content of food huh that their\nvisual system and presumably other\nsystems um have become like almost um uh\nhyper accurate calculators of the amount\nof calories in food they've devoted a\nlot of cognition to it it sometimes can\nyou know border on or or be placed\nwithin the obsessive realm but that they\nsee food and they they they can tell you\na tremendous amount about the caloric\namounts with these Foods even food\ncombinations to uh you know with a in a\nvery small margin of error okay um so\nand and that drives in in that condition\nobviously uh food avoidance yeah um so I\nhave to assume that these agrp neurons\nare involved in this kind of thing one\nrepresents a regulation in the case of\nthe example I gave and in the other case\na let's just call it what it is because\nanorexia nervosa is the most deadly of\nthe psychiatric conditions sadly\na pathologic disregulation a maladaptive\ndisregulation so what is known about\nthese AGP neurons in humans meaning do\nthey exist in humans um presumably they\nexpress the leptin receptor um sounds\nlike they are able to integrate\ninformation both\ncognitive um based on immediate\nexperience visual or factory but also a\nlot of Prior experience um you know a\nhamburger patty I don't can't tell you\nhow many calories it has all know that\nit's mostly protein and some fat um you\nknow what are these neurons doing what\ndo they have access to they sound like\nyou know when anytime I hear about\nhypothalamus I think very basic drives\nbut you're talking about a pretty\nsophisticated analysis of a\nrealtime event yeah that is driving\nfairly nuanced behavioral decisions and\nupdating that which is which is a big\ndeal yeah you know we're both\nneuroscientists but for everyone\nlistening and watching this is a big\ndeal this is as nuances deciding whether\nor not somebody is Friend or Foe or\ndeciding whether or not you you you like\na movie or you don't I mean this is this\nis some um some pretty sophisticated\nprocessing this isn't eat don't eat or\neat less eat more these aren't switches\nexactly um these are dials exactly yeah\nso there's there's a lot there I'll try\nto unpack that um so the first thing I'd\nsay is they are present in humans and\nhumans uh do humans have hrp neurons\nhuman arrp neurons Express the leptin\nreceptor and we think the functions are\nvery similar um so one of the nice\nthings actually about studying these\nkinds of things like basic mechanisms of\nhunger thirst because these things are\nso important for survival they've been\nunder really strong selection right and\nso many of the components of these\nsystems are genetically hardwired\nmeaning these are cell types that have a\nsingle purpose in this case to control\nhunger they're labeled by specific genes\nand those are conserved through\nEvolution um we also know that this\npathway this AGR Pam pathway um is\nimportant in humans due to human\ngenetics so uh just to add a little bit\nmore information here there's a\ncompanion set of neurons called palc\nneurons that promote satiety so there\nsort of the yin and yangang of hunger\narrp neurons promote hunger pomc neurons\npromote\nsatiety they're intermingled in the same\npart of the\nhypothalamus they they're axons that\nproject to the exact same Downstream\nbrain regions then it's thought that\nthese two neurons compete with each\nother uh to control appetite and that\ncompetition occurs through neuropeptides\nthat they release one of which is a an\nAgonist for a downstream receptor and\nthe other one of which is an\nantagonist um we know from Human\ngenetics that the these um that among\nseverely obese people mutations in this\npathway agrp palc neurons and their\ndirect Downstream targets are quite\ncommon so so and so is it fair to say\nthat that some amount of obesity is\ngenetic in in nature at the level of\nneuronal\nfiring or circuitry I think a lot of\nbody weight regulation is genetic it's\nhighly heritable um there's a question\nof how much of it is due to single genes\nand the number of people quote and this\nis among people who are severely obese\nso not just people who you've seen\nsomeone who's overweight but people have\nsort of syndromes where they're very\nobese from a very young age um among\nthose people something on the order of\n10% have mutations in this\npathway and it can either be this this\nhormone\npalc um or an enzyme within those cells\nthat processes pomy into the right form\nor in the down this is the most common\nmutation in the downstream receptor for\npomy it's called the melanocortin 4\nreceptor and so um so among the severely\nobese people have sort of genetically\ninherited severe obesity from childhood\nuh something on the earth 10% have\nmutations in this pathway so it's very\nclear that this uh that this this\npathway is involved in body weight\nregulation in humans most obesity\nalthough there is a very strong genetic\ncomponent\num uh is not associated with single gene\nmutations like this Associated effects\nof many mutations um but we know that\neven in in that sort of polygenic\nobesity that has many different uh\ngenetic causes um that uh uh the brain\nis important and one of the reasons we\nknow that is if you look at the genes\nthrough genetic Association studies that\nhave been associated with body weight\nand there's been lots of genetic\nAssociation studies try to find\nmutations that are associated with\nwhether you're lean or\nobese something on the order of a\nthousand genes have been linked to body\nweight\nregulation um and the vast majority of\nthose are expressed in the brain and\nthey're highly enriched for brain\nprocesses which makes sense because body\nweight is controlled by food intake\nright and the brain controls behavior\nand also the brain controls energy\nexpenditure so so maybe it's not so\nsurprising but it's clear that um that\nthat mutations in in in genes in the\nbrain uh are important for body weight\nand which is consistent with the results\nof you know twin studies so if you look\nat monozygotic versus diotic twins the\nestimates for the heritability of body\nweight is something on the order of 80%\nwe should explain monozygotic dizygotic\nwhich I've talked about before on the\npodcast just to brush people just\nidentical versus fraternal twins\nbasically and so um uh and by comparing\ntheir uh basically their um their body\nweight when they become adults you can\nget a sense for how much of this is\ngenetic versus\nenvironmental and um something on the\norder of uh 80% is thought to the\nvariation between individuals is thought\nto be have a genetic component wow um so\nI I don't think most people appreciate\nthat and a lot of the debate we hear\nnowadays is um because there are things\nthat people can do to lose body fat\nexercise eat differently Etc maybe\nEmbrace pharmacology if if that's um\nappropriate um there seems to be this to\nme silly debate as to whether or not\npeople should be eating better and\nexercising or um assuming that all of\nthe Obesity they might have um arises\nthrough genetic causes um and therefore\ntake a prescription drug I mean why\nwouldn't it be a combination of things\nyeah like to me it just seems like why\nwouldn't people um Embrace some are all\nof the tools that they could afford and\nthat are safe for them so I just want to\nget that out there because the moment\nthis comes up people start thinking oh\nwell uh the moment we assign a genetic\nsource to something we're removing um\npersonal responsibility but of course\nthere are people I know people who have\nstruggled with their weight their entire\nlives for whom some of these new\nPharmaceuticals like OIC have provided\nthem the opport\nto finally be able to uh lose weight and\nfeel better and exercise safely yeah for\ninstance I I completely agree with that\num I think there is a misconception out\nthere about this about what it means for\nsomething to be genetically heritable\nand I think this gets to the root of why\nso many people find this sort of hard to\nbelieve that there's such a strong\ngenetic component of body weight that's\nthe idea that you know if you look at\npeople say 75 years ago right they were\nmuch leaner right and you look at people\ntoday and there's been this starting\nsometime around you know the 1970s\nthere's this explosion in body an\nincrease in obesity is that when that's\nwhen it started mid 7s sort of 1970s is\na lot start snacking so there's lots of\nthere's lots of explanation oil snack by\nthe way I don't think that's the reason\nfolks I I think there are a lot of\nreasons but the theories that that\nabound right now on social media are I\nhave a list of the theories as to why\nthe OB obesity is increased you get\neverything from seed oils to snacking to\nuh smartphones to uh conspiracies to\nit's wild it's wild the range of of\nhypothesis is wild yeah I mean the the\nchalleng is I mean some of them could be\ntrue but it's just very hard to test\nthose things experimentally because\nthey're happening in the whole\npopulation right but so I think the\nthing that people find hard to wrap\ntheir heads around because it is a\nlittle bit of a confusing idea is that\nhow can it be that in say 50 or 75 years\nthere's been this explosion in obesity\nwhich is the environment has changed but\nhuman genetics has not changed in that\namount of time it's just not fast enough\nfor people to evolve so it can't be due\nto mutations in humans what about\ndevolve my understanding is that within\na species um evolving new traits is very\nslow yes but mutations arise like the\nObi Obi mutation and then you can get\nvery fat versions of a of an animal very\nquickly right all you need is a you know\nif if it's a um if it's a recessive alal\nyou need two copies and then next thing\nyou know you've got a mouse that's four\ntimes larger than a typical Mouse and\nand it's all explained by increased body\nweight so that happen can happen very\nquickly within a species what's rare to\nfind uh is an entire new branch of a\nspecies that has a a very uh a new\nadaptive function that seems more rare\nso so that's true so definitely there's\nsome things that take longer to evolve\nthan others but with humans we're\ntalking about just two generations there\njust isn't enough time for any evolution\nof any signific baby baby boomers\nright that's me right and then whatever\nis YZ Millennial I lose track after\nexactly so so I think the thing that\npeople find hard to WRA their heads\naround is how can it be that this is how\nthis is that that that increase in body\nweight is clearly environmental right\nbecause that's all that's changed the\nenvironment it's nothing has changed\ngenetically yet it's also true what I\nsaid that body weight is extremely\nheritable it's one of the most heritable\nfeatures and something on the order of\n80% the only thing one of the only\nthings we know about that's actually\nmore heritable than body weight is\nheight right most diseases are not as\nheritable as body weight how can you\nexplain that the idea is this there's a\ndistribution of body weights among\npeople so in any given so Society at any\npoint in time some people are going to\nbe leaner some people are going to be\nmore obese that distribution where you\nlie on that distribution is determined\nprimar by genetics so you may be the\nperson who has the Thrifty genes so that\nbasically cause you to save energy and\nso you would be more on the obese side\nor you may be may be a person who has\ndifferent genes that cause you to be a\nlittle bit less hungry so you would be\non the leaner\nside what environment does is then it\nshifts that whole distribution so that\nbasically the mean shifts so that\neveryone becomes or most people become\nheavier and so sort of phrase that\npeople sometimes use is that is that um\ngenetics loads the gun and environment\npulls the trigger so basically genetics\ns your sets your propensity and then\nenvironment can can basically unmask\nthat and so as we've had this change in\nenvironment where there's all this and\nwe don't know exactly what the things\nare that have changed they're important\nbut there's all this Ultra processed\nfood highly palatable food uh just\nvarious other things that you mentioned\nseed oils who knows if that's important\num uh uh certain people had these latent\nmutations that made them say very sens\nsensitive to palatable food and in an\nearlier time they may have been lean but\nnow because they have that latent\ncapacity to be sensitive to to ultr\nprocessed food they now gain tons of\nweight in in the environment that we're\nin it's still because of genetics but it\nalso requires the environmental\ncomponent I mean you just take a step\nback right you can make anyone lean but\njust putting them putting them you know\nin prison and just only feeding them\n1500 calories I mean we've done those\nkinds of experiment this this famous\nexperiment the Minnesota starvation\nexperiment right they basically this is\ndidn't put people in prison but this is\nin World War II they took a bunch of\nhealthy volunteers fed them 1600\ncalories a day just asked what would\nhappen if you basically semi- starved\npeople and unsurprisingly they lose an\nincredible amount of weight all they\nthink about is food they basically their\nbody temperature goes down their heart\nrate goes down they just become obsessed\nwith food and you you could always do\nthat for anyone right but but um in a\ngiven environment where you're not in\nthat kind of situation then your\npropensity to gain weight will be\ndetermined by genetics so that's the\nidea I very much appreciate that\ndescription and I know great number of\nother people will as well because the\nexplanation for the increase in obesity\num has not been described with that\nlevel of accuracy in detail with respect\nto the interactions between genetics and\nthe environment is it fair to say that\nwhat's changed in our environment is the\nfree availability of food you know I was\nwalking through an airport yesterday and\nevery 20 meters or so there's a vending\nmachine or a restaurant um the cost of\ncalories yeah is fairly low right\ngetting high quality nutritious food\nthat tastes great is expensive yeah I\nwould argue but getting calories is\nfairly inexpensive yeah I think that's a\nplausible hypothesis um it's one of\nseveral plausible hypothesis and it\nwould be surprising to me if it didn't\ncontribute but the reality is these\npopulation level questions it's just so\nhard to actually know because you can't\ndo an experiment right we can't create a\nparallel so Society where we manipulate\none of these variables and see if the\npeople become obese so I think probably\nthe availability of food of the free\navailability the low cost is one part of\nit another part of it is probably\nalthough again it's it's it's it's not\nproven is that these ultr processed\nfoods have a number of features that um\nmake them make people prone to gain\nweight and this's really beautiful work\nI if you know about this from Kevin Hall\nat the NIH who's investigated this he's\nreally in my opinion the best person\ndoing this kind of human obesity\nresearch today and he does these\nexperiments where he takes people into\nthe NH into the hospital hospitalizes\nthem for several weeks so he can exactly\ncontrol what they eat and he did this\nthis beautiful experiment where\nbasically he had chef prepare two kinds\nof food one Ultra processed and the\nother not ultr processed sort of more\nWhole Foods more healthier foods but had\nthem take a lot of care so that when\nthey gave the foods to Independent\nRaiders to people to test they would say\nthis is about equally palatable so I\nlike the this Ultra processed Dish as\nmuch as as this non Ultra processed dish\nwhat's an example of an ultra processed\ndish like a outof package macaroni and\ncheese exactly that kind of stuff with\nbacon kind of thing exact versus um some\npasta sitting next to a vegetable and\nsome exactly a nice piece of salmon or\nsomething exactly exactly um and uh um\ntook people into the into the hospital\nbasically allowed them to eat just as\nmuch as they would like first of the\nultra processed meals so they had the\nselection of ultra processed meals for a\ncouple weeks and then switch them to the\nto the non-ultra processed meals and\nthen also did it in the reverse order so\nthe other half of the people they got\nthe regular food first then they got the\nultra processed food and what he found\nis that even though um uh uh people\nrated the foods as equally palatable\nthey ate more of the ultr processed food\nand they actually gained weight when\nduring that two we period when they were\nbeing given the ultra processed foods\nand then when you switch them they lost\nweight so the idea being that you can\nhave two sets of food that you sort of\nequal pref equal preferences for but\nsomething about the ultra processed food\nis making you eat more of it when you\nactually consume it and there's a number\nof ideas about why that could be so one\nidea is that these Ultra processed foods\nhave been optimized to have the right\npercentage of fat and sugar and protein\nto sort of promote more consumption once\nyou start eating it so could be part of\nit another idea is that you know a big\nthing about Whole Foods is that they\ntake more energy to digest and they have\nmore volume so one of the Striking\nthings from that study is if you just\nlook at the pictures of the meals\nthey're the same number of calories but\nthere's so much more food seemingly on\nthe nonprocessed food versus the ultr\nprocessed food and that's just because\nWhole Foods are bigger because they're\nnot so energy dense so and we know that\nfor example volume is a major signal on\nthe short term for regulating food\nintake so if you just eat more volume\nthat could be valuable and there's lots\nof things like that so so I think that\nthat's another H plausible hypothesis\nbut the truth is we don't really know I\nhave a hypothesis and I don't want to\nforce you into speculation but given\nthat you've studied and discovered that\nthe neurons and circuits involved in\nappetitive and consummatory behaviors\ncan learn based on experience and\nexpectation I think it's fair game to at\nleast ask your thoughts on this so I've\nbeen paying a lot of attention to the\nlandscape of what the general public\nthink about um let's call them\nelimination diets where people will just\neat meat yes or will go onto a vegan\ndiet or do some time restricted feeding\nor do any number of different things\nthat have been shown to promote weight\nloss provided people obey the laws of\nthermodynamics and consume fewer\ncalories than they um than they burn\nyeah right I do believe in calories in\ncalories out and there are a number of\ndifferent routes to get there and some\nare more painful some are less painful\nand it depends on the individual\nlifestyle exercise and on and on but\nlet's just suppose for a moment based on\nKevin's work on highly processed foods\nversus Whole Foods that there's a\nlearning that takes place when we eat\nyes and that this learning takes place\nover time such that our brain and\nappetite start to link the variables of\ntaste macronutrients proteins fats and\ncarbohydrates sort of knowledge about\nmacronutrients a piece of fish is mostly\nprotein has some\nfat a bowl of rice is mostly\ncarbohydrate has some protein yeah put a\npat of butter on it has some fat also\nright it's sort of obvious\nbut taste macronutrient content calories\nwhich we already know people with\nanorexia are exquisitely good at\ncounting with their eyes so it's\npossible they represent again a\npathologic stream of this and\nmicronutrient content maybe even amino\nacid content like how much Lucine is\nthere now most people aren't thinking\nabout how much Lucine is in a meal but\nwe know that Lucine is important for\ncertain aspects of muscle metabolism\nit's um present in certain proteins and\nnot others you're going to find less of\nit in a vegetable typically than you\nwould in a piece of chicken and and so\non and that when people eat mostly\nnonprocessed or minimally processed\nfoods and not in combination so we're\nnot talking about stewing all this\ntogether or blending all of it together\nwhich G sounds disgusting right broccoli\nrice and a chicken breast blend together\njust sounds horrible but eating them\nseparately if there's some olive oil and\na little Pat of butter involved like\nthat sounds pretty good but a highly\nprocessed food in some ways is a\nblending together of macronutrients\nmicronutrients if there are any um and\nother features of the food that neurons\nin the brain seem to pay attention to\nand then giving it a unified taste a\nDorito right yes um a candy bar that we\nattach to the product we attached to the\nname of the processed food to the\npackaging but I could imagine and here's\nthe hypothesis that that is quote\nunquote confusing to our neural circuits\nin a way that doesn't match up well with\nour thermodynamic requirements of how\nmuch we're burning versus how much we\nneed to eat whereas when I eat a piece\nof steak and a vegetable\nI actually want less carbohydrate\nafterwards if I eat the carbohydrate\nfirst for me it's difficult because I\nlove the taste of carbohydrates\nespecially when they're combined with\nfat but there's seems to be an easier\ntime regulating food intake when people\nstep back and say I'm going to consume\nminimally processed Whole Foods and I'm\nguessing it's not just because um\nthey're trying to be healthier that\nmight be what stimulates the the shift\nbut that the brain starts to learn the\nrelationship between food volume smell\ntaste um what these things look like and\nsatiation at the level of oh that's\nenough amino acids because I had a piece\nof fish so maybe I don't need to consume\nas much of some other things or the\nvegetables provide volume and fiber and\noften vegetables can taste really\ndelicious too so that there's a there's\na linking of nutrients calories and\ntaste in a way that's more appropriately\nmatched to the energetic demands of the\norganism this case us humans that highly\nprocessed foods bypass yeah okay now I\nrealized that was long-winded and\nforgive me but my audience is used to\nthat whenever I'm trying to table\nsomething for no pun intended for a\ndiscussion that I would like to think\ncan at least stimulate some additional\nthinking about a landscape in this case\nnutrition and and feeding behavior that\nfor a lot of people is just really\nconfusing and here's why and this is the\nlast thing I'll say I have several\nfriends who have been very overweight\ntheir entire lives for whom the\nfollowing diet has worked exceptionally\nwell I'm not a diet coach I'm not a\nnutritionist I don't pretend to be one I\nsay eat proteins like meat fish\neggs vegetables and\nfruit and do that for a couple of months\nand then add back in starches as you um\nsee fit based on your food intake and\nwithout fail they all lose a ton of\nweight they're very happy with that they\nadd back in a minimum of\nstarches they keep the weight off and\nthey they're also exercising but not\nmore than they were before in most cases\nand I don't think that it's meat or fish\nor vegetables per se I think it's that\nthey finally develop an appreciation for\nwhat different foods have in in terms of\nwhat they actually need and without fail\nthey all say oh you know on I went to\nthis party and I had a piece of cake and\nit didn't taste good to me after three\nor four bites so that's interesting too\nso I just would like your thoughts on\nthis we're not defining any new diets I\ndon't sell any diets I don't do any of\nthat but I find it amazing that when\npeople start eating minimally processed\nWhole Foods I have to assume that their\nbrain changes as it relates to appetite\ncraving and just kind of a an\nunconscious understanding about what\nfood is providing them or not and that\nhighly processed foods basically bypass\nall of this and just get you to consume\nmore perhaps in hopes of getting\nsomething that you probably aren't\ngetting at all or that you need to\nconsume a lot of this food in order to\nget yeah there's several interesting\nideas there so there's two that come to\nmind just thinking about what you just\nsaid\nso the one is the idea of what's going\non when these people uh consume simpler\ndiets more of of Whole Foods and and one\none thing I think that's very likely\ngoing on is this phenomenon of sensory\nspecific satiety is being engaged and so\num uh sensory specific satiety is just\nthe idea that as you expose yourself\nrepeatedly to a certain flavor or taste\nyou um you basically lose appetite for\nthat you get specific loss of appetite\nfor that flavor or taste this is why as\nyou said basically if you start off\neating the protein after a while I don't\nwant any more salmon but I would like\nsome carbohydrates now because you have\nthe sensory specific satiety and so um\nit's well known actually that if you\nsimplify your diet make your diet really\nsimple so there's just a few things then\nsensory specific satiety alone can cause\nyou to eat less basically because\nthere's just less Variety in your diet\nand you don't want to eat more of that\nsame thing and so and so I think a lot\nof diets actually it's not about the\nspecific macronutrient or the specific\nfood it's just that they're reducing the\nvariable the the variety in the diet\neventually you just get sick of eating\nthe same thing and you know this is the\nthought behind that idea is that it's\nit's important evolutionarily so that\nyou eat a diverse diet it's the reason\nprobably that you want sweets after\nyou've eaten a Savory meal and so on a\nsecond idea though that comes to mind is\njust as you mentioned this idea of\nlearning and and so much about our our\npreferences for food are they're not an\na they're driven by learning right and\nso so you know there are some things\nthat are a so if you put sugar on a\nbaby's T tongue you know it'll smile\nindicating that it likes it and if you\nuh put something bitter it'll frown and\na rat will do the same thing a neonate\nrat but most of flavor and the\nperception of food is not just sweet or\nbitter it's this much more complex\nSensation that involves smells it\ninvolves tastes and then it involves how\nthose tastes and smells interact with\nthe post-ingestive effects of the\nnutrients so the sensing of those\nnutrients in your stomach and in your\nintestine primarily in your intestine\nare thought to then feed back and then\nchange your preference for these foods\nand so you know there's lots of examples\nof this that you can just imagine from\neveryday experience most people the\nfirst time they had a beer or the first\ntime they had a glass of coffee found it\nrepulsive right because it's extremely\nbitter but then we come to Crave these\nthings because we know what they do to\nour body we like what they do to our\nbody and that doesn't just make us take\nthem like they're medicine we actually\nsomehow change our very perception of\nhow that flavor is we actually come to\nsavor that flavor we previously found\ndisgusting and it's because our\nsensation of what is what is whether\nsomething's good or bad depends on an\ninternal State and so it's an\ninteresting idea you know perhaps if\nthese Ultra processed foods that have so\nmany different ingredients and such an\nunnatural combination perhaps this\nprocess of learning about the nutrient\ncontent of different foods and flavors\nbecomes impaired because it's just the\nbrain is not used the brain's used to\nsaying you know this is a piece of\nchicken and this is primarily protein\nand so I can gauge you know from this\nFlav I can connect this flavor to an\namino acid content but something that's\nso diverse it might be harder to do and\nisn't it the case that the neurons in\nthe gut and the hormones that are\nproduced by the gut as we digest food\nand that the neurons in the brain that\ncan control appetite and\nfeeding have to be tuned to\nmacronutrient content because those are\nthe U primary colors of of nutrients and\nnutrients are uh the way in which we can\npersist um on a day-to-day basis right I\nmean I'm not trying to sound more\nsophisticated where simpler terms would\nsuffice what basically saying is that\nthe neurons in our brains that control\nthese behaviors both eating and\ncessation of of eating an ingredient or\nan entire meal can't be tuned to a\nparticular food product or to chicken or\nto an egg or to a steak uh or to lentils\num but rather to amino acid content\nessential amino acid content in\nparticular essential fatty acids and in\nthe case of carbohydrate whatever is\ngoing to replace whatever glycogen we\nmight have depleted right I mean like if\nwe really break it down into biology\neating is for a purpose and my\nunderstanding is that the purpose of\neating is to uh replace those things as\nneeded um rather than to uh you know\ntaste Savory or taste um absolutely\nabsolutely absolutely those are just\nthose those things those sensory cues\nare just markers that tell the brain\nwhat might be in that substance I think\nif you if you look at broadly at this\ndifference between calories and\nmacronutrients and micronutrients I\nwould say what you see is that most of\nthe circuits that are controlling hunger\nare primarily calorie specific so they\nthey can like for example an arrp neuron\nI can put sugar fat or protein into the\nstomach of a mouse and to an equal\nextent inhibit an agrp as long as they\nhave equal calories really yeah so a\nlittle drop of olive oil into the belly\nthat has of an animal that has um let's\ndrop let's say a little bit more let's\nsay um 120 calories of olive\noil is equipotent to 120 calories of\nchicken breast at the level of these\nagrp neurons it is so we they don't care\nabout they don't care about no they're\nreally concerned about they're really\nconcerned about energy um there are\ncircuitries that are more concerned with\nmacronutrients individually although I\ndon't think we know nearly as much about\nhow that works and I think the evidence\nis clear that the the strongest offended\nMac macronutrient by far is protein so\nprotein um you know I don't think really\nsugar and fat intake are strong strongly\ndefended in the sense that you can you\nyou're fine if you go without eating\nsugar right basically you can synthesize\nsugar from other from amino acids for\nexample um and you don't\ndevelop an a specific sugar appetite in\nthe same way you do for example if you\ndeprive yourself of hunger you develop a\nprotein hunger or essential I think the\ndifference is that you know proteins\nconsist of essential amino acids there's\nthis I forget if it's nine I think amino\nacids that um uh your body cannot\nsynthesize you absolutely need them or\nyou will die and so um whereas sugar and\nfat can be interchanged with other\nmacronutrients so um and then there's\nother things also that you absolutely\nneed to ingest like sodium chloride\nright so sodium so uh uh there's very if\nyou deprive an animal of of sodium they\nwill develop this salt appetite that's\nincredible basically and that's\ncompletely innate um uh but that's I\nthink salt appetite and and and protein\nappetite are the things that are\nprobably the most strongly regulated at\nthe level of the macro\nmicronutrients I'd like to take a brief\nbreak and acknowledge one of our\nsponsors element element is an\nelectrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need that means the electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium in the\ncorrect amounts and ratios and nothing\nyou don't which means no sugar now I and\nothers on this podcast have talked about\nthe critical importance of hydration for\nproper brain and body functioning even a\nslight degree of dehydration can\ndiminish cognitive and physical\nperformance it's also important that you\nget adequate electrolytes the\nelectrolytes sodium magnesium and\npotassium are critical for the\nfunctioning of all the cells in your\nbody especially your neurons your nerve\ncells drinking element dissolved in\nwater makes it very easy to ensure that\nyou're getting adequate hydration and\nadequate electrolytes to make sure I'm\ngetting proper amounts of hydration and\nelectrolytes I dissolve one packet of\nelement in about 16 to 32 ounces of\nwater when I wake up in the morning and\nI drink that basically first thing in\nthe morning I'll also drink element\ndissolved in water during any kind of\nphysical exercise I'm doing especially\nin hot days when I'm sweating a lot\nlosing water and electrolytes they have\na bunch of different great tasting\nflavors of element my favorite is the\nwatermelon although I confess I also\nlike the raspberry and the Citrus\nbasically I like all the flavors and\nelement has also just released a new\nline of canned sparkling element so\nthese aren't the packets you dissolve in\nwater these are cans of element that you\ncrack open like any other canned drink\nlike a soda but you're getting your\nhydration and your electrolytes with no\nsugar if you'd like to try element you\ncan go to drink element spelled l\nmn.com huberman to claim a free element\nsample pack with the purchase of any\nelement drink mix again that's drink\nelement.com / huberman to claim a free\nsample pack if we could talk\nabout body weight homeostasis for a\nmoment that I think that would be useful\nso let's say somebody decides they want\nto lose some weight they caloric\nrestricts slightly either by exercising\nmore or eating less or both their body\nweight drops by a bit let's say they\nlose 10 pounds eight of which are body\nfat they lose a little bit of lean mass\nalso they're now at a new lower body\nweight are the arrp neurons motivated to\nhave them seek out more food in other\nwords are they hungrier and more\nmotivated to find and eat food or do\nthese agrp neurons learn hey body weight\nis lower and I don't need to push to\nfind so much food so often no I mean the\nidea is that the hrp neurons are more\nactive when you lose weight and that\nthat chronic activation of those neurons\nin part because leptin levels are lower\nin the blood because you've lost weight\nis that drive that that that\ncounterregulatory drive that drives you\nto then consume more food but then how\ndo people ever keep weight off well so\npart of the answer is they don't I mean\nso so there's so really I I I I would\nargue like I have these friends who were\nvery heavy most of the excess weight was\nbody body fat for a long time they seem\nto be doing great yeah uh eating the way\nthat I described before and by the way\nI'm not a proponent of any one\nparticular diet I have vegan friends\ncarnivore friends Etc but but that\npattern of eating I described before has\nbeen enormously successful for them I\nhaven't run a you know a randomized\ncontrol trial that's not my job to do\nthat in the realm of nutrition but\nthey're doing great they claim to be sad\nthey are so happy with the way things\nare going and um I I don't hear that\nthey're constantly hungry I hear that\nthey're constantly saded well so I would\nsay that that you\nknow there have been efforts for a long\ntime to develop diets that would help\npeople consistently lose weight and it\nhas been very unsuccessful um there are\nsome people who for various reasons\ncan't can successfully lose weight and\nkeep it off and I don't know that I have\na good answer for what's going on in\nthose individual cases how they are the\nexceptions to the rule what about them\nis different that makes sense some also\nquit drinking alcohol yeah so there's\nother things so you know I think so\nbehavioral regulation is better when\nyou're sober as opposed to environment\nbut you know so what this is sort of\ngetting at is what is the\ncounterregulatory response to weight\nloss and so this has been studied um it\nwas first studied um uh in the context\nof energy expenditure and um because\nenergy expenditure is actually\nsurprisingly easier to measure in humans\nthan food intake because people don't\ntell you accurately what food they eat\nif they're free living humans they have\nto fill out a questionaire but um and\nthe idea is that um for every uh\nkilogram of weight you lose so it's\nabout 2.2 pounds I think um your energy\nexpenditure decreases by about 30 kilo\ncalories a\nday now so not a ton but that is\nsignificant right 30 calories and then\nif you lose as you said 10 lb then\nthat's 100 50 calories and that adds up\nover\ntime one interesting thing about that is\nthat if you take people who were obese\nand then they've lost a ton of weight so\nthere's a study by Rudy liell about 25\nyears ago that did this um take people\nlost like 100 pounds and then take a\ncontrol group that has the same height\nweight basically the same body\ncomposition as those people who've now\nlost 100 pounds compare their energy\nexpenditure the energy expenditure in\nthe in the people that lost all the way\nis about 25% lower than the people\npeople who never were obese and so those\npeople who lost the weight we call them\nthe reduced obese or that's what they\nwere called in those studies and the\nidea is that that there's this now this\nchronic deficit they have to eat 25%\nless than someone who looks the same as\nthem is the same height as them the same\nweight as them in order to maintain that\nbody weight what's unclear is whether\nthat's because those people simply\nalways had a solow metabolism they were\nalways destined to be obese and then you\njust basically you're comparing two\ndifferent groups or whether something\nabout the process of gaining weight and\nbeing in a higher weight for a longer\nperiod of time changes the brain so that\nthen once you lose the weight it's\nirreversible um but there have been\nstudies looking at at least a year and\nit doesn't seem to come back within a\nyear that difference in energy\nexpenditure now the question is is that\nreally the big effect is that why it's\nso hard to lose weight energy\nexpenditure or is it because you're\nhungrier and that's actually much harder\nto measure um but there was another\nreally nice study Again by Kevin Hall\ninvestigating this um used a really\nclever approach this drug so basically\nwhat he wanted to do was is um he\nreasoned that um you can meure people's\nbody weight and you can measure people's\nenergy\nexpenditure and because calories in\ncalories out if we can measure body\nweight and energy expenditure accurately\nwe can then back calculate how much that\nperson was actually\neating um so let's see what happens when\nyou have people lose weight how does\ntheir food intake change but the trick\nto this is you need to do it in such a\nway that you don't just tell them to go\nrun on a treadmill because if you tell\nsomeone to go around a treadmill and\nlose way then basically there's all\nthese they're thinking about the fact\nthat they're doing this you need to do\nit in some way overtly so you increase\ntheir energy expenditure cause them to\nlose weight but without them realizing\nthat's what's happening so they gave\nthem these uh drugs these sglt2\nInhibitors and it's a pill you can take\nthey're used for diabetes they block\nthis this this protein sglt2 in the\nkidney that is necessary for glucose to\nbe reabsorbed into the blood and so\nbasically what happens you pee out about\nlike 90 grams of glucose a day but you\ndon't know that you're doing that and\nthat causes you to lose energy and these\npeople would lose some weight and then\nmeasure how their food intake changes\nand what that showed is that for every\ntwo pounds or so of weight you lose your\nhunger goes up by 100 calories per day\nso basically you've got a 30 kilo\ncalorie decrease in energy expenditure\n100 kilo calorie decrease in appetite\nfor every two pounds you lose on average\nsome people will be exceptions right\nthey won't experience that at all for\naspects of their physiology we don't\nunderstand um and so increased hunger\nseems to be the main reason people find\nit so difficult to keep weight off that\nseems the perfect segue to talk about\ngp1 glucagon like pep TI one OIC monjaro\nand similar drugs um my understanding of\nthe back history on these is that a\nbiologist obsessed with hila\nMonsters uh a reptile that doesn't need\nto eat very often discovered a peptide\nwithin their bloodstream called extendin\nyeah that um allowed them to eat very\nseldom a curbed appetite in the hila\nmonster of all things and and it has a\nanalog homologue you know we don't know\nuh I don't know the sequence homology\nexactly but there's a similar peptide\nmade in mice and in humans that\nsuppresses appetite um if you would\ncould you tell us uh what is known about\nhow glp1 Works to suppress appetite\nwhere in the body indor brain sure and\nuh your sort of read of um these drugs\nand what's happening there um good bad\nexciting sure ugly sure um be happy to\nanything else so um the story of glp1 so\nthe he monster is an important turn and\nI'll talk about that it actually goes\nback before that quite a ways so so I\nshould take a step back and say you know\nthese were developed as drugs for\ndiabetes right and so and know diabetes\nis a condition where basically have\nelevated blood glucose either because\nyou don't produce enough insulin or\nbecause your insulin is is not\neffective and so back in in sort of the\n1920s right around the time insulin was\ndiscovered um there was this phenomenon\ndiscovered known as the incretin effect\num and uh what it was intin intin not\nthe effect not the effect\nyou can observe the effect in\nnumerous places in daily life and online\njust kidding so it's it's called the\nincretin effect you can think of it as\nincrease insulin because that's what the\neffect is um and the idea was that if\nyou take glucose by mouth if you consume\nglucose orally um versus if you have the\nsame amount of glucose injected\nintravenously more insulin is produced\nwhen you take the glucose orally versus\nif it's delivered intravenously\nsuggesting something about the process\nof ingesting uh the glucose causes more\ninsulin to be released and causes you to\nto lower your body sugar more accurately\nmore more more strongly interesting um\nwhich is a little bit counterintuitive\nbecause in the pancreas right so insulin\nis released from the pancreas from the\nbeta cell the pancreas senses the\nglucose concentration in the blood\ndirectly and so it suggest that that\ninsulin is being released not just in\nresponse to changes in blood glucose but\nin response to a second factor and so\nthey call that an incretin\nand through various experiments it was\nit was uh shown that this incretin\neffect comes from the intestine that\nthere's some substance being produced by\nthe intestine that when you eat a meal\nuh sugar goes through your intestine\nthat boosts this insulin response to\nglucose in the blood and people\nimmediately realize this could\npotentially be very valuable and the\nreason is that you know you can treat\ndiabetes with insulin injections but\ninsulin is dangerous right because if\nyou inject too much insulin you can kill\nyourself by making yourself hypoglycemic\nright so this have to be very careful\nbut the thing about the incretin effect\nis it's not causing insulin release\ndirectly but it's rather boosting the\nnatural insulin release that comes when\nglucose is higher in your blood so it's\nsort of an amplifier on the natural\ninsul insulin release so basically in\nthe years that followed whenever someone\nwould find a new hormone they would test\nit is it this incretin and there's lots\nof failures they weren't the incretin um\nbut then so there's this other hormone\nthat comes from from the the um pancreas\ncalled glucagon right and so glucagon\nwhich also discovered in the 1920s\nglucagon is kind of the anti-insulin so\num when blood sugar goes low glucagon is\nreleased in order to cause your liver to\nrelease glucose into the blood so\nglucose glucagon and insulins are these\ntwo opposing hormones glucagon was known\nfor a long time but but people\ndiscovered in s of the 1980s that the\nglucagon Gene is expressed in other\ntissues other than the pancreas and it's\ndifferentially processed the protein is\ndifferentially processed to produce\ndifferent hormones hormones other than\nglucagon and they discovered there was\none in the intestine and so they called\nit glucagon like peptide because it came\nfrom the same gene but it's just\nslightly different it's cut up slightly\ndifferently and this hormone was an in\ncreedon so basically if you uh put it on\nbeta cells um you get this increased\nresponse of insulin in response to\nglucose and so there was the idea okay\nthis could be a great diabetes drug\nright and there I should say there was\none other increte that's that's been\nfound it's it's called jip Gip and that\nwill be important talking about some of\nthese other drugs also a hormone that\ncomes from the intestine and so um the\nchallenge with making\nglp1 into a drug is that it has an\nextremely short halflife so it has a\nhalf life about 2 minutes in the blood\num and so even if you inject people with\nglp1 it won't really be useful for\nanything you don't decrease appetite you\ndon't affect blood sugar because just\ndegraded too fast and the reason it's\ndegrade is because there's an enzyme\ndpp4 is what it's called that degrades\ngp1 so the first thing people tried was\nlet's make Inhibitors of that enzyme so\nwe can boost this natural gp1 signal and\nthose are improved uh uh uh diabetes\ndrugs they're called gliptin you've\nprobably heard about them Genovia is the\nmost common one and those boost the\nlevel of gp1 the natural glp1 in the in\nthe produced from the intestine by about\nthreefold and they're effective in\ntreating diabetes not people lose weight\npeople do not lose weight and that's one\nof the key reasons that we know that the\nnatural function of gp1 is not really to\ncontrol body weight because you can\nboost the level three-fold with these\ndpp4 drugs millions of people have taken\nthem they do not lose weight that's a\ngreat question\nso but you know a three-fold is great\nbut like you'd like to increase it even\nmore right and to do that you can't\nblock this enzyme you have to actually\nproduce a glp1 that uh uh is more stable\nin the blood and that's where this this\nlizard that you're talk you mentioned\ncomes into play it produces a stabilized\nform of glp1 and its venom no one knows\nwhy one hypothesis is that it's\nsomething to do with the lizard uh as\nyou said basically having this long time\nperiod between meals and it needs to\nregulate its blood glucose who knows if\nthat is true but it turned out to be\nfortuitous because then this glp1 from\nthis lizard it has a half life of like 2\nhours and so the first glp1 drug that\nwas approved was just this molecule from\nthis lizard basically and it um it's\ncalled exenatide and it's approved in\n2005 for works well for diabetes um has\na half life of two hours you inject it\nand um uh doesn't cause a ton of weight\nloss but two hours is good but it's not\nso great so then pharmaceutical industry\ntries to can we you know basically\nimprove this even further and so they\nstart engineering this hormone making\nmutations attaching lipid tails to make\nit binds to proteins in the blood that\nwould stabilize it chemistry jockey\nstuff yeah exactly and I think the next\nbig Advance was this Compound L glutide\num and liraglutide was appr proof for\ndiabetes in 2010 and for and then for\nweight loss in 2014 and so lug glutide\nhas a half life of about 13 hours in the\nblood no now you're getting up to\nsomething serious we've gone from 2\nminutes 2 hours 1 hours and you get\nbetter effects on on on aspects of blood\nglucose and diabetes control and they\nstarted to see that some people were\nlosing weight very variable responses\nnot everyone loses weight on L\nglutide and one of the things they\nnotice that I think is just is\nfascinating to sort of example of how\ndrug Discovery works in the real world\num you know a lot of these people who\ntake log glutide now it has this longer\nhalflife they start to get nauseous and\nthat would limit how much of the LI\nglutide they could take and it's a known\nside effect of these gp1 drugs it causes\nnausea and sort of this gastrointestinal\ndistress\nbut they noticed that over time the\nnausea would just sort of go away and so\nthey would start dose escalating sort of\nraising the dose that the person would\ntake so you would go you know a month at\nthis dose and then a month at a slightly\nhigher dose and then a month at a\nslightly higher dose and you could work\nyour way up and these side effects would\nreappear but then they go away and then\nonce you got up to the highest doses\nthen people really started losing weight\nand so there's a couple things that are\npharmaceutical industry realized wow\nthese are potentially really effective\nweight loss drugs and also this nausea\nwhich we thought was a was you know a\nkiller people are able to just get used\nto it and then it just goes away it\nunder goes the word is Tac aaxis so the\nidea is that the receptor uh that's\naffecting the the in the gut that's\ncausing this these effects undergo some\nsort of down regulation with with\nchronic chronic exposure so L glutide\nyou know was it's been around it's been\non the market for 14 years now um was\nused but still you're only getting sort\nof like 7 to 10% weight loss which is\ngood but not like you know amazing Rive\num but then semaglutide came along um\nand that that was approved for diabetes\nin 2017 and semaglutide is OIC or also\nAl also uh marketed as uh wig oie for\nweight loss and semaglutide now has a\nhalf life of seven days so now we've\ngone from two 2 minutes 2 hours 13 hours\n7 days and you can really jack up the\nconcentration with a 7-Day uh uh\nhalflife and then they saw people\nstarted really losing weight and so and\nsome of those trials people lost you\nknow 16% of their body weight which\npreviously had been unattainable with in\nwhat time frame uh typically takes about\na year okay and most of the loss and\nbody weights from body fat or from other\nother compartments the typical number is\nthat if you um if you lose weight either\nthrough dieting or through taking one of\nthese drugs and you don't do anything\nlike eat a high protein diet or do\nresistance training somewhere between 25\nand 33% of what you lose is going to be\nmuscle the rest is going to be fat but\nas you said some of that could be be\noffset by resistance training Andor\nconsuming a higher protein diet yeah you\ncan almost completely eliminate that if\nyou eat enough protein and do serious\nweightlifting um obviously not the whole\npopulation is interested in doing that\nand there's been a lot of discussion of\nhow serious a side effect this is um you\namong elderly people you don't want to\nbe losing muscle mass because you're\nalready losing so much muscle mass on\nthe other hand the counterargument that\nhas been made which I think is also kind\nof convincing is that true you're losing\nsome muscle\nbut you're also losing all this fat and\nyou no longer need as much muscle when\nyou're not carrying around as much body\nfat so people who are heavier naturally\nhave more muscle because they need to to\nmove their body right and so yeah the\nthe calves on very um obese people are\noften enormous exactly and then they\nlose weight and exactly the and I\nmentioned the calves in particular\nbecause um they're carrying a lot of the\nbody load exactly exactly so it's still\nan open question as to whether as to how\nserious a problem this this musan muscle\nmass loss is although the pharmaceutical\nindustry is all in now on making drugs\nthat basically are going to prevent that\nso that's that's something that will be\nwill be happening probably in the future\nis it a sorry to interrupt it is the um\nweight loss on these drugs the\nconsequence of reduced appetite um or\nsome other aspect of metabolism and if\nit's the consequence of reduced appetite\num is that occurring at the level of the\nbrain and gut um or culmination so it's\nalmost entirely reduced appetite and\nit's almost entirely incurring at the\nlevel of the the brain which neurons\nit's thought that the key targets of of\nuh these drugs are neurons in these two\nregions one's called the nucleus of the\nsolitary tract and the other one's\ncalled the area Posta so where back in\nthe brain stem back in the brain stem so\nthese are actually the neurons in that\ndesate rat story I was telling earlier\nthese are the brain regions that are\npreserved in the deser rat the deser rat\nstill has these very coddle brain stem\nstructures um they're two very special\nbrain regions because they get direct\ninput from the vagus nerve so the vagus\nnerve is the nerve that inates your\nstomach and intestines and heart and\nlungs and it's sort of the major pathway\nfrom gut to brain and provides most of\nthe sensor of the neural input from gut\nthe brain telling you about things like\nthis your stomach distension how many\nnutrients are in your intestine\nbreathing all that stuff and almost all\nof those vagal nerves terminate on these\ntwo structures in the brain stem when I\nhear Posta I think about nausea because\nI was taught that Posta contains neurons\nthat can stimulate vomiting um and this\nseems to link up well at least in The\nLogical sense with the idea that\nstimulating activating receptors in\nthese neurons within postma might\nexplain part of the transient nausea\nside effect do of OIC and and related\ndrugs yeah so the current thought is\nthat a lot of the nausea is coming from\nactivating the neurons in the area Posta\nand that a lot of the sort of\nphysiologic satiety is coming from\nactivating the neurons in the nucleus of\nthe solitary tract now the whole brain\nis connected to each other and so if you\nreally turn on these neurons in the NTS\nand the AP they're going to talk to the\nhypothalamus and all these other brain\nregions that's going to change the whole\nbrain so it's not just those regions but\nyou know these drugs don't have great\naccess to the brain they can penetrate a\nlittle bit into the brain but they don't\npenetrate into the whole brain and it's\nthought that if you take fluorescently\nlabeled versions of these drugs and see\nwhere they so you can visualize where do\nthey actually go they're enriched in\nthese structures in the brain stem so\nthat's why people think that this is\nprobably where they're acting and is\nthat because they're um there's an\nabundance of The receptors for the these\ncompounds in Posta and um NTS or is it\nbecause the bloodb brain barrier is\nsomehow weaker at that location uh it's\nbecause the blood brain barrier is\nweaker so basically it's a region uh so\nwhat's known as a circumventricular\norgan meaning it's a one of these rare\nplaces in the brain where the blood\nbrain barrier is weakened and so\nsubstances can come from the outside\ninto the brain um and that's important\nfor these big peptides because these are\nnot small molecules these are Big\npeptides with lipid chains on them and\nother things and so they can really get\nonly get into areas of the brain where\nthe blood brain barrier is weakened\nI really appreciate that you mentioned\nthe half-life issue with glp1 and the\nfact that these um\ndpp4 antagonist did not lead to weight\nloss despite increasing circulating glp\nby three-fold um this is relevant um to\na number of different claims that people\nmake that a given food or a given drink\num increases glp one um I've actually\nsaid before you know I'm a big consumer\nof Y brate my uh father's side is\nArgentine and it's a known appetite\nsuppressant but it contains caffeine and\nother stimulants that might explain some\nof that and it's not a robust appetite\nsuppressant to the point where most\npeople would you know rely on it as a\nweight loss compound it's but anyway\nit's my preferred source of caffeine but\nI've um said before um you know there's\nsome evidence that it can increase glp1\nbut based on what you've said the\nincreases in glp1 that it creates are\nvery unlikely to produce the kind of\nappetite suppressive effect that would\nlead to any significant weight loss in\nsomebody that's obese presumably that\nare separate from any caffeine\nstimulatory effect right so you can't\nseparate because it's it's a complex\ncompound this year thing it's got lots\nof things in it but also um you know\nI've uh observed you being vocal on\nsocial media uh when people have said\nhey this thing increases uh gop1 um you\nquite appropriately I think um said wait\nyou know OIC and drugs like that\nincrease glp 1,000 fold\nwhen you talk about a food or drink or\nmaybe a supplement increasing gp1 it's\nvery unlikely to increases gp1 to that\nlevel meaning unless you're getting into\nthe hundredfold OR thousandfold\nincreases um probably uh not right to\ntalk about glp1 being the source of any\nappetite suppressive effect yeah that's\nthat's all correct so I mean I think\nit's important sometimes to distinguish\nbetween pharmacologic and physiologic\neffects so physiologic is what the\nhormone naturally does in your body and\nwhat can be modulated by natural things\nlike eating a different food and you\nmight get a twofold change in your glp1\nby eating a different food you know one\nfood versus the other but as we know\nfrom those dpp4 Inhibitors it's not\ngoing to really change your appetite\nbecause the drugs increase it three-fold\num these These gp1 agonists are really a\npharmacologic effect effect that only\nhappens with drugs so you get a thousand\nto 10,000 fold higher concentrations of\nthese drugs in your blood than uh the\nnatural hormone and so it's just there's\nno diet is ever going to give you that\nand there's no precedent for it either\nso should we be at all concerned about\nthat I mean they run clinical trials and\naddress safety but when you're talking\nabout a thousandfold increase in a\nessentially a peptide hormone yeah um if\nwe were talking about different peptide\nhormone you know pick one um you know\noxytocin or uh estrogen testosterone\nthey're not really you know broadly\nspeaking um most people would be\nconcerned about thousandfold dosing of\nsomething like that and obviously there\nare clinical indications where that's\nimportant however my observation of the\never expanding literature on gp1\nagonis um is that there seems to be\nimprovements in like reduction in um\nalcohol consumption um and by the way\nwhy would uh increasing gop1 reduce um\nuh craving for alcohol that it seems\nlike there's an ever expanding list of\nthings that glp1 agonism is good for\nyeah um but we are talking about Su I\nwould say superphysiological levels when\none takes it and again I'm not um\nagainst it nor for it I'm just paying\nattention to the literature so I would\nsay that that's absolutely right when\nyou're increasing the level of hormone a\nthousandfold you need to be careful see\nwhat's happening um but at the end it's\nan empirical question what what what\ndoes it actually do to a person and it\ncan only be answered through experiments\nand I think the nice thing about these\ngp1 drugs that a lot of people don't\nrealize is they've been around approved\nsince 2005 the earliest ones and even\nsomething like OIC which maybe only\nentered the public Consciousness in the\nlast year or two right it's been around\nfor sevenish years I think so so and big\nclinical trials with these drugs and so\num and the evidence so far is that they\nseem to be incredibly safe and as you\nsaid not just incredibly safe but um\nthey seem to have all these unexpected\nhealth benefits that that were seems to\nbe in some cases even unrelated to\nweight loss and so so you know because\nof the reasons you mentioned one of the\nthings the FDA requires from these\npharmaceutical companies for diabetes\ndrugs is um these large cardiac uh\noutcome trials so basically where you\nmeasure stroke and where you measure uh\nuh heart attacks and and death from from\nany cardiac cause um big trials like\n20,000 people four years cost like a\nbillion dollars to run and the data from\nthe semaglutide the OIC trial came out\nlast year and as expected reduced the\nrate of heart attacks Strokes all cause\nmortality according to cardiac uh uh for\nfor cardiac reasons but was really\nsurprising was a lot of that seemed to\nhappen before the people even lose\nweight lost weight so there was already\na difference between the placebo group\nand the semag glte group before the\npeople on the drug had lost a\nsignificant amount of weight and there\nwas no correlation between the amount of\nweight they lost and how well they were\nprotected from heart disease and that's\nled many people to think that some of\nthese effects actually could be due to\nother things the gp1s are doing that we\ndidn't expect and so one thing is\nthere's an idea emerging that that they\nare\nanti-inflammatory so um these brain\nregions the area postre and the NTS are\nalso really important for this this\nreflex known as the inflammatory reflex\nthat basically acts starts with the\nvagus nerve goes to these brain regions\nof the brain stem and then goes back\ndown to the body to basically suppress\nto prevent outof control inflammation\nand so it's thought that these drugs\nperhaps have an anti-inflammatory effect\nthat explains some of that um sounds\nlike the patent on these drugs just got\nextended by another hundred years that's\na that's a that's a bio uh Pharma joke I\nmean just to put context on it um drugs\ncan be patented and sold as a commercial\nversion and not as generic versions\nuntil the patent runs out unless\ncompanies are able to find another um\napproved clinical use in which case it\ncan be remarketed only as a um brand\nname not generic version so a lot of\ncompanies once they do the uh safety\ntesting and uh and all given everything\nthey put into the R&D into the research\nand development there's a very big\nincentive to not necessarily find new\ndrugs but finding new uses for the same\ndrugs and not allowing generic versions\ninto uh into the picture and that's why\nit's likely to be based on these um uh\nwhat sounds like additional uses of um\nOIC related compounds a long time before\nthere's generic OIC available I I think\nit will be a while I don't know the\nexact status of the patents but I'm\nguessing it's going to be a while before\nthere are generic versions but there's a\nlot of competition coming so every major\npharmaceutical company almost every\nmajor pharmaceutical company now has a\ngp1 program really and uh some of them\nare really exciting actually um so so I\nmean the general Trend in this area is\nwhat people call glp1 plus which means\nyou take The glp1 Agonist which is\nalready giving you 15% weight loss or so\nand then you add additional things to\nthat to give it additional\nproperties so one compound is from Eli\nLily which makes this other so there's\nthis other drug on the market that we\nhaven't talked about but tepati which is\nknow as mojarro for diabetes and zap\nBound for obesity which is even better\nreally in almost every respect a better\ndrug than than OIC um so people lose\nmore weight so it's about 21% weight\nloss at a year um fewer side effects um\nat least at comparable doses that seems\nto be because this this other drug uh\ntepati um it has two Targets not one so\nso whereas whereas OIC is just um gp1\nreceptor Agonist tepati is a dual\nAgonist of glp1 and this other in\nthat we talked about Gip Gip and it\nseems like having that Gip agonism\nactually EXs as an anti nausea effect\nthat sort of counteracts some of the\nnausea caused by the gop1 in the area\nPosta there are Gip receptor neurons in\nthe area Posta this nausea Center to\nsort of allows you to crank up the dose\nof the gp1 agonism even further while\nyou're suppressing the nausea and just\nget even more weight\nloss so now talking about the future\nthings that aren't available yet but\nwill be in the next couple years so Eli\nLily the company that makes this drug\nchatid muaro um they have a triple\nAgonist that's in phase three clinical\ntrials now so this is now three hormones\nin one it's the glp1 which all these\ndrugs have the Gip which is the anti\nnausea component and then glucagon\nitself and so these these three hormones\nall combined in one pill and what the\nglucagon does is it increases energy\nexpenditure this is a well-known effect\nof\nglucagon and um so you're basically\neating less your nausea is as bad and\nnow you're just burning more calories at\nBaseline the results from this strug are\nincredible so basically um there's been\none phase 2 trial published and people\nlost 25% of their body weight at the end\nof the of the uh uh uh I think it was 48\nwe period and they were still losing\nweight so we don't know where the end\npoint we don't know what the what the\nmaximum is so there are bigger Longer\ntrials going on now to figure that out\nbut but at that point when you get\nBeyond 25% body weight you're talking\nabout basically bariatric surgery right\nwhich is currently the best thing we\nhave you know like these these surgeries\npeople people do qu stomach staple\nremoving a portion of the stomach\nremoving a portion of the gut so really\nit's a pharmacologic version of\nbariatric surgery the other one that I\nthink is really exciting there's this\ncompound from Amgen it's called just\nright now it's just a code it's like AMG\n133 but um it's like tepati in the sense\nthat targets both glp1 and Gip so it's a\ndual dual dual uh targeted but unlike\ntepati which activates the Gip receptor\nthis amen compound inhibits it\nand for reasons that people don't\nunderstand either activating or\ninhibiting this receptor causes you to\nlose weight so still a mystery lot of\ndebate about what's going on there but\nthe way this Amgen compound activates um\nthe uh Gip receptor or inhibits the Gip\nreceptor rather is that uh it's an\nantibody so all these other things were\npeptides but this is a much bigger\nsexual protein this is an antibody and\nbecause it's an antibody it has a much\nlonger lifetime even than something like\nsemaglutide which is 7 days so it last a\nmonth in the blood or something and so\nyou can give people monthly injections\nof this and they lose dramatic amounts\nof weight and then at least in this\ninitial trial um at the end of this they\nstopped and people maintained the weight\nloss for 6 months that's impressive\npotentially because of the long-lasting\neffects of this antibody or potentially\nbecause of other things that we don't\nunderstand so and those are just two\nthere's all sorts of other crazy things\nhappening so really I think it's just\nit's just created this explosion of of\ninterest in Pharma um once basically\nit's one of these things you know it's\nyou know once you see that something can\nbe done all of a sudden that changes\neveryone's perspective and so now\nobesity drug Discovery has gone from\nsomething that 10 years ago everyone\nwanted to stay away from because there\nwere so many nightmare stories about\ndrugs that turn out to be not safe till\nnow everybody's sort of Allin on this\nyeah I remember in college the fenfen\ndebacle where a diet drug was released\nand people had cardiac issues start\ndying so it was pulled from market and\nthen it was essentially a quiet field\nfor a long time in part to bring us back\ninto the brain and in part because it's\ndirectly relev to what we've been\ndiscussing um about OIC and\nglp1 um there are other neurons in the\nbrain that regulate feeding um and there\nare other peptides involved in appetite\ncontrol for which I would say Niche\ncommunities have started to indulge in\num and by the way people were taking\nglp1 analoges long before they were FDA\napproved in kind of Niche communities\nthese aren't communities I'm a part of\nbut every once in a while I'll stick an\near into one of these communities and\nhear what people taking and a big thing\nright now um in these communities is the\nuse of other peptides um that are in the\nmelanocyte simulating hormone pathway\nand you mentioned\nmelanocortin um receptor containing\nneurons um could you tell us a little\nbit about what these neurons do um in\nthe absence of any pharmacologic\nstimulation and then why it would be\nthat uh people would uh perhaps um\nstimulate these Pathways um with these\ndrugs not that we're recommending that\nbut I do think that um given that some\nof these neurons are also involved in\nsexual behavior and FDA approved for the\ntreatment of um hyposexual function in\nwomen um things like that you know there\nis FDA approval for for some of these\ncompounds that they're interesting\nhypothalamic neurons that are starting\nto gain more attention and that I\npredict based on their potential\ninvolvement in uh feeding appetite and\nweight control are likely to enter the\npicture uh with more prominence um in\nthe not too distant future so Alpha msh\nas scientists call it the hormone you\nwere just referring to is um is a\nproduct of uh Palm the Palm C Gene so in\nthe same way that we just talked about\nhow glucagon can be processed into\ndifferent things in some Gene in some in\nsome cells it's made into the glucagon\nhormone and other cells is made into gp1\npal C that that Gene can be processed to\nproduce different hormones and one is\nAlpha msh which is very important for\nfeeding control and so these these Palm\nC neurons they're in the aru nucleus of\nthe hypothalamus same region where these\nagrp neurons I talked about earlier are\nlocated and there's sort of these these\nthese two uh uh uh these two sets of\nneurons that have opposing effects on\nbody weight regulation and so Alpha msh\ninhibits food intake and arrp neurons\npromote food intake um and where they\nconverge is is at this receptor the\nmelanocortin 4 receptor um which is uh\nuh important for body weight regulation\nand so Alpha msh is an Agonist it turns\non that receptor and the arrp peptide is\nan antagonist it turns it\noff um and so you know there's a lot of\nhuman genetics as I as I mentioned\nearlier implicating this pathway in uh\nbody weight regulation there have been a\nlot of efforts um over many years to\nturn Alpha msh into a drug um and it's\nbeen very difficult um there is one drug\nthat's now approved it's called I think\nI'm going to get the name wrong it's\nlike set MTI or something like this um\nit's an mc4 receptor\nAgonist um it's mainly used relatively\nsmall populations of people that for\nexample have mutations in this pathway\nit's not used as a widespread as as as a\ndrug and the challenge has been um\nreally side effects so um there's an\nincrease in blood pressure that happens\nsometimes with these medicines partly\nbecause the this pathway controls not\nonly appetite but also autonomic tone\nand sympathetic nervous system\nactivation um uh\nso you know it's just taking a step back\nfrom everything we've talked about today\num I talked about this the short-term\nsystem and the long-term system that\ncontrols energy balance and body weight\nthe long short-term system in the brain\nstem the long-term system in the\nhypothalamus the long-term system being\nleptin and Alpha msh and arrp when I was\ncoming up learning about this stuff 15\nyears ago 20 years ago um you know it\nwas uh the Dogma was you could only\naffect body weight through the long-term\nsystem by manipulating the long-term\nsystem because any manipulation you did\nof the short-term system in the brain\nstem the animal would would just\ncompensate and there were these famous\nexperiments where they would take cck\nwhich is a hormone just like gp1 inject\nit into rats inject it several times a\nday and cck is known to decrease the\nsize of meals and it would decrease the\nsize of meals but the rats would never\nlose any weight because they just eat\nmore meals to compensate and they would\njust perfectly compensate by eating more\nmeals and so the lore was it's just\nimpossible the animal will always\ncompensate unless you hit this body\nweight set point regulating area which\nis the hypothalamus the long-term\nsystem um but then what the\npharmaceutical industry discovered which\nI guess maybe shouldn't be so surprising\nbut I guess it was to some people is\nthat if you just hit that receptor that\nshort-term system 24 hours a day 7 days\na week and never let it stop then you\nwill lose weight right and so the\nshort-term system alone is enough to\ncause body weight regulation on the\nother hand the long-term system with\nAlpha msh and and arrp neurons and pomy\nand all this stuff has been a challenge\nto pharmaceutically Target um because\nyou know leptin we discussed didn't\nreally work um and so I think there's\ngoing to be as as you mentioned a\nreemergence of interest in considering\nthis other pathway now that we've seen\nthe the the success of the of the gp1s\nand I think one area where it may emerge\nis um in considering their combination\nperhaps at different stages of weight\nloss so perhaps you know what would make\na lot of sense scientifically I don't\nknow if it'll work in practice is that\nyou would take a gp1 drug to lose the\nweight and then at some point you might\nstop that drug and switch to a a more\nhypothalamus Center leptin based drug to\nkeep the weight off so basically use the\ngp1 drug to force yourself to lose the\nweight and then use the leptin\nhypothalamus based drug to sort of say\nokay this is our new body weight set\npoint let's not resist this weight loss\nthat's happened whether that will\nactually make sense practically it's\nhard to say because you know the gp1\ndrugs have just a lot of benefits even\nBeyond weight loss so people might not\nwant to stop taking them um but that's\none idea very\ninteresting I'd love to talk about\ndopamine sure we hear so much about\ndopamine being involved in pleasure I\nlike to think I've had at least a small\nlevel of impact act in convincing people\nthat it's also involved in perhaps\nmostly involved in things like\nmotivation different forms of learning\nand lots of other things too folks\ndopamine does lots of things it's even\nexpressed in the eye and controls\nadaptation to light so does lots of\nthings but it certainly is believed that\ndopamine is involved in our either\ncraving for food or pleasure from food\nwhat's the real story on dopamine as it\nrelates to food and eating Behavior you\nhad a beautiful paper publish in nature\nentitled and we'll put a link to this in\nthe show note captions uh dopamine\nsubsystems that track internal States um\nand I love this paper for a variety of\nreasons but if you could give us the\nhigh points of of your discoveries on\ndopamine as it relates to feeding I\nthink um I know in fact that people\nwould find it very Illuminating sure\nfantastic um so uh yeah the question of\nwhat dopamine does with respect to\nfeeding is a great question and a\ndifficult question I think to answer\nthere's a lot of miscon conceptions I\nthink um the evidence is dopamine\nprobably isn't so much involved in the\npleasure of food that taste that's some\nThe honic\nExperience um one reason we think this\nis because you can make mice the Richard\npaler did this decades ago that don't\nhave any dopamine and they still show\nthe same sort of effective responses to\nfood so you put something sweet in their\nmouth they kind of they like it right um\nwhat dopamine seems to be important for\nwith respect to food is two things um\none is the motivation to engage in work\nto get food particularly when it's high\nlevels of effort so um if you ask a\nmouse to press a lever to get a pallet\nof food uh if it doesn't have any\ndopamine it won't do it and if it has\nlow levels of dopamine it'll just work a\nlittle bit so you dopamine is important\nfor sort of energizing action and and\nmotivating you to engage in hard tasks\nthe other thing that dopamine is really\nimportant for is learning and it's\nimportant for learning about which cues\npredict something useful for the body\nand feeding is a Central example of that\nand and what that paper of ours is about\nis the idea that this learning actually\nhappens on two different time scales for\ntwo different kinds of cues so what we\nalmost always talk about with dopamine\nand learning which is important is\nlearning about how external qes in the\nenvironment predict something like food\navailability right so you see a\nMcDonald's sign and you know that uh\nthat means there's some tasty food in in\nin there and so dopamine is is is\ninvolved in that process of sort of\nlearning what what that external Q means\nand that's a very fast time scale\nprocess so in the laboratory um for\nexample we will play a tone and then\ngive an animal a sip of a of a solution\nthat has calories in it for example and\nand it can learn the association between\nthat tone and that food is going to be\navailable if they're separated by a few\nseconds but that's all and that that's a\ndopamine dependent\nprocess um but there's a second sort of\nmuch slower time scale learning about\nfood which isn't about where I go to get\na hamburger but rather about what the\nexperience of eating the food the Oro\nsensory experience its taste its flavor\nits texture how that relates to the\npost-ingestive effects and I should say\nthat this seems extremely relevant to\nthe McDonald's example because um in\nyour experimental situation the tone is\nanalogous to the golden arches of the\nMcDonald's sign but in my experience uh\nand forgive me but most of the food that\nI've consumed from McDonald's does not\ntaste good um relative to other like\nreally delicious hamburgers or french\nfries or something like that I mean it's\num so you're saying dopamine is required\nto link the signal the golden arches or\nthe tone to the presence of food at a\nparticular location exactly but not to\nthe experience of pleasure from that\nfood exactly which squares very well\nwith my experience of McDonald's and I\nprobably haven't had a bite of\nMcDonald's in 20 plus years I would have\nto be pretty hungry I haven't either and\nI it's funny the Golden Archers thing is\njust something that people in\nNeuroscience talks about dopamine use\nand so now I've started subconsciously\njust talking about golden arches even\nthough I also haven't eaten McDonald's\nin decades in and out burger better\ntasting from what I understand probably\nbetter sourcing we're not going to get\ninto all this in detail but everyone has\ntheir preferences but um but I do think\nit's interesting because what we're\ntalking about here is related I think to\nthis notion of Highly processed food\npackaging the commodation of food just\nthe idea that we are drawn to food for\nthings other than the taste that we\nexpect for\nthere's all this context that's right so\nI think an an important distinction that\npeople make is the distinction between\nwanting and liking I don't know if\nyou've talked about this previously on\nthe podcast an lmy my colleague at\nStanford came on the podcast talked\nabout dopamine is about wanting as\nopposed to enjoying exactly so in most\ncases yeah so liking is this the\nsubjective honic pleasure in the moment\nof eating it but wanting is just what\nwhat you want and these can be uncoupled\nall the time you could want things that\nat the end of the day you don't actually\nenjoy it when you get it I feel like a\nlot of life is like that indeed\nand and so uh and so um and so dopamine\nis very powerful making you want\nsomething but not necessarily like it so\nthat's one element but then there's this\nother element that that that is\nimportant but very much less studied but\nI find much more interesting which is\nhow you connect this this the sensory\ncues associated with food its taste its\nflavor um its smell uh with the\nconsequences for the body and this is so\nimportant because um so much of whether\nwe like or dislike a particular food or\ndrink is related to its post-ingestive\neffects you come to like things for\nexample that have calories so this is\none of the reasons that adults will eat\nvegetables and other Savory Foods that\nchildren find disgusting even though\nthey're a little bit bitter you learn\nthrough experience this makes me feel\ngood to eat this and even maybe at a\ncompletely subconscious level there's\nalso a level of learning that occurs um\nand this of course happens with other\nthings like coffee and beer and other\nthings like that and so there's been an\nidea that this this other much slower\nlearning occurs and the reason I say\nit's slower is because because the time\nbetween when you taste the food and when\nit actually gets into your intestine and\nreleases the the hormones that might\ndrive this is quite slow separated by\ntens of minutes um but how that works\nhasn't been clear there's been an idea\nthat dopamine might be involved um but\nit hadn't really received a lot of\nattention and so we set out to\ninvestigate what is the role of dopamine\nin these postingestive responses and\nsort of map out for the dopamine system\nhow does the dopamine system respond not\nwhen you see the golden arches which is\nusually the kinds of experiments that\nhave been performed but rather when you\ndeliver nutrients directly to your\nstomach or when you deliver water\ndirectly to your stomach if you're\nthirsty and so on and what we saw was\nthat there are these different\npopulations of dopamine neurons that are\ntuned to respond to signals from inside\nthe body and so there are some that\nrespond when nutrients are in the\nstomach and\nintestine um there are others that\nrespond when in a thirsty Mouse when the\nblood is rehydrated when you basically\nsatiate your\nthirst and we showed that the um the\npurpose or at least at least a purpose\nof that activation is to cause you to\nlearn about the effects of what you just\nate basically to create this connection\nbetween the flavor of something and its\npost-ingestive effects so that sort of\nthat that delayed dopamine signal uh\nafter ingested food and fluids is sort\nof reinforcing this connection between\nthe flavor of what I just ate and that\nit was something good for me one of the\nsort of interesting things about that\npaper that was not the direction we\ninitially expected to go in is that um\nfor food I think it's kind of intuitive\nthere are lots of flavors to food you\nhave to learn you know what all these\ndifferent flavors mean for thirst people\nfind it a little less obvious because\nthirst is just water aren't you just\nborn knowing what water is like how do\nyou have to learn anything to do with\ndrinking a glass of\nwater but it actually is a learning a\nlearning question in part because for\nmany animals probably most animals\nthirst is something that's associated\nwith eating not drinking there's this\nstudy I love um of rabbits in New\nZealand so so you there's not a lot of\npeople studying what animals how they\nget their fluids in the wild cuz who\ncares but it's kind of interesting and\nso in New Zealand uh uh this huge rabbit\nproblem because they're invasive P\nspecies that that that was introduced in\n1800s and they just eating all the all\nthe land and so there's lots of money to\nstudy rabbits just understand their\necology and so um group of researchers\ndid this experiment where they made this\nbig pen outside where they put a bunch\nof rabbits in the rabbits couldn't\nescape but they had all their natural\nfood it was like an outdoor area and\nthey also put a trough of water so the\nrabits always had access to water just\nlike clean water then they could measure\nhow much water the rabbits drank and\nwhat they basically found is that nine\nmonths out of a year Rabbids drink Zero\nWater they drink absolutely zero because\nthey get all of their water from food\nthe only time they drink is during the\nwinter when all of the greenery has sort\nof become shriveled and then they can't\nget water from that\nanymore and so it's just kind of\ninteresting aspect of of how many\nanimals are very different from the way\nwe think about ingestive Behavior but\nbut that fact that animals have to get\nwater from food raises this question how\ndo they know which foods are rehydrating\nthat's presumably they have to learn\nthat because you can't just look at a\nfood and say if you've never had any\nexperience oh yeah this is something\nthat's very water rich and this will\nrehydrate me when I'm thirsty and this\none is not and so James the graduate\nstudent who led this project uh\nbasically investigated this by uh giving\nmice different fluids and then measuring\nhow the dopamine response and he showed\nthere was this delayed dopamine response\nafter the mice had drank the\nfluids uh uh that correlated with\nrehydration of the blood so a whole\nbunch of dopam neurons get strongly\nactivated when the blood is rehydrated\nand he hypothesized this might be a\nsignal this delayed this delayed\nactivation of dopam neurons that allows\nanimals in the wild to learn uh uh uh\nthat food I just ate is is is\nrehydrating and so he did an experiment\nwhere he basically gave them two\ndifferent flavors mimicking sort of the\nflavors of two different foods one of\nwhich was hydrating and one of which was\nnot and the Animals couldn't tell\nbecause he infused the water directly\ninto their stomach and uh he showed that\nbasically uh uh these dopamine neurons\nare critical for them learning that\nAssociation so so that's the story of\nthat I love it and I'll tell you why um\nwhen I was in college for reasons that I\ndon't recall I decided to run an\nexperiment on\nmyself where I would eat one meal that\nwas fairly low water content like a\npiece of meat or something with some\ncheese you know what some people call a\nketo meal but I wasn't ketogenic I don't\neven think I knew what a ketogenic diet\nwas at that point and then the next meal\nI would have like a salad and some\nfruits and then I would back and forth\nand I generally would only eat two or\nthree times a day you know anyway\nthere's only so many hours in the day um\nand I found it to be incredibly\nsatiating um and I found that I felt\ngreat and I can imagine any number of\ndifferent reasons for that and there are\nthese theories that you probably recall\nthat the the diet that was being um\npromoted in the 90s where people would\neither eat carbohydrates or proteins\nseparately like there was some wackiness\nout there and as I say that I'm sure\nI'll get assaulted in the comments\nprobably not wacky I'm sure there's some\nenzymatic basis for why that would be\nuseful if you enjoy it go for it um you\nknow um I I don't have a feeling about\nit one way or the other but one thing I\nnoticed was that\num low water content containing meals um\neither by virtue of the foods that they\ninclude or by virtue of the fact that\nthey're not diluted so to speak\num it's a different taste experience to\neat those Foods than it is to eat like a\nbig salad or something of that sort um\nin any event I don't do that any longer\nI just sort of stopped but it was a fun\nexperiment um and I think it was\nefficient because at the time I had very\nlow money as a student so you know\ngenerally fruits and vegetables were\nless costly than meats and things of\nthat sort but um in all seriousness um\nto what extent do you think humans uh\novereat or undereat depending on the\nwater content of the food it's an\ninteresting question so you know there\nis this advice that you should um if\nyou're hungry first drink something\ndrink some water and see if you're still\nhungry and the idea is that um perhaps\nuh uh humans can't always I mean we our\nour interceptive sense our ability to\nsense what our body needs is not perfect\nand sometimes we could be confused and\nwe could really be thirsty when we're\nhungry and hungry when we're thirsty and\nthere's some evidence that that could\nhelp um I would say it's probably not a\nhuge effect in most of modern day life\nbut but uh it's an interesting idea mhm\nyeah um this brings us to the topic of\nthirst something that your laboratory\nhas worked on extensively and the topic\nof osmolarity yeah of um salt\nconsumption and things of that sort\num in Broad terms how do these things\nlink up\nmeaning are there instances in which\nwhat we really need is salt and we end\nup eating a bunch of Parmesan cheese I\ngot teased Yesterday by my team because\noccasionally when I'm on the road I I\ndon't like most of the foods available\nin most airports and stuff so I'll bring\na a chunk of really nice parmesan cheese\nI just break off a piece and eat it I'll\nhave half a cucumber and I'll have a can\nof um not a can of tuna but they're\nthese wonderful a Jarred filet of Tunas\nthat are available that are in olive oil\nthey taste really good this is not\ncanned tuna it's really good um and I'd\nrather eat that in most cases until I\ncan get to a decent um meal than like\nwhat's put in front of me on an airplane\nmost of the time um so I get teased\nabout this but I notice that for\ninstance sometimes I'll eat the cheese\nand I think oh actually what I really\njust want is the salt yeah really want\nthe salt I've been drinking a lot of\ncoffee today i' had a couple extra\nglasses of water maybe I'm just craving\nsalt and I'm confused and I'm over\nconsuming this cheese yes when in fact\nwhat I'm going for is the salt as you\npoint out um our understanding of\nexactly what we need is fairly crude and\noftentimes we overshoot the margin\nespecially when foods are in combination\nso um\nsalt water\nand let's just say calories how how do\nwe um accurately or inaccurately um\npursue those at the level of biology\nokay so I was drawing tough questions I\nknow but you're your feels like my\nqualifying exam so um so uh well there\nare separate system this thought to be\nseparate systems that control salt\nappetite thirst for water and hunger for\ncalories and so they involve different\nbrain regions for the most part\ndifferent neurons different signals from\nthe body\num in general hunger and thirst are\npretty separable the I would say the the\nthe instance where they interact is in\nphenomenon such as dehydration anorexia\nthis is the idea that if I give you some\ndry food but I don't give you any water\num you're going to eat less food because\nbasically you're going to get dehydrated\nand you're going to decide I need to\npreserve my my fluid balance even if I\neat less\ncalories um so we prioritize hydration\nyes you will\nat some point you will prioritize uh\nhydration that's related also to the\nconcept of prandial drinking so many\nanimals including humans drink most of\ntheir water during meals because you\nbasically want to counteract the\nosmolites that are in your\nfood um salt balance though and and\nthirst so the The Thirst for water and\nthe desire for salt are much more\ntightly linked because um the purpose of\nboth systems is to maintain the\ncomposition of the blood At Its Right\nconcentration so you you want to have\nthe right osmolality the blood which you\ncan just think of in simple terms as\nsort of the the total concentration of\nall the salts um uh it's a little more\ncomplicated than that but it doesn't\nreally matter and uh uh uh you also\nspecifically need to maintain the sodium\nconcentration at the right level and so\num uh and there are really powerful\ninnate mechanisms that drive both I\nthink thirst is very intuitive to people\nyou get dehydrated uh you lose water you\nbecome thirsty um and uh we know now\nthat that that there are very small set\nof neurons in a few brain regions that\ncontrol that um and uh they they the way\nthey they're thought to work is they\ncontain Osmos sensors so they contain\nsame basically these neurons are sensors\nfor the osmolality of the blood and\nthey're activated when the blood\nosmolality gets too high and it's\nincredibly sensitive system so so you\ncan perceive an increase in your blood\nosmolality of 1% as the sensation of\nthirst so remarkable wow um yeah that's\nhow critical it is to maintain salt\nbalance exactly exactly and so you know\nyou get to 10% increase in Blood\nosmolality and you're in extreme\ndiscomfort and 20% you're like in the\nhospital so if I took a let's just say a\num half an ounce sip of sea water\ninadvertently yes it's extremely\naversive it is it's like like you just\nyou you want to drink some nons salty\nwater some nice clean water yes exactly\nimmediately yeah so I should I should\nemphasize that there's two components to\nthe fluid homeostasis system to the\nwater homeostasis system one is this\ndesire to drink but the other is of\ncourse the kidney and so the reason that\ndrinking the salt water won't put you in\na really bad situation is your kidney\nwould then filter out a lot of that salt\nand cause you just to pee it out and\nthen you'll be fine um and so those two\nwork in Balance the kidney is\ncontrolling how much of the salt gets\nreabsorbed into the blood and then this\ndesire for thirst this desire to drink\nuh allowing you to replenish the blood\nwith water at various\nintervals um and so um yeah I mean the\nexperiments led to the discovery of this\nthird circuitry are amazing it was this\nguy B Anderson working in the 1950s and\nhe just had this hypothesis that there\nwas an Osmos sensor in the brain right\nwhich is very I think you know there was\nsome evidence to suggested but it was\nnot really really a strongly supported\nat the time by the data and so he took\nthese goats and he just started um\ninfusing small amounts of salt into\nvarious places in their brain reasoning\nthat if there was an Osmos sensor sorry\nto I was wild I mean I I wasn't\nchuckling at in justest like it like I\nyou know I feel for the goats I I feel\nfor everyone involved in that experiment\nbut what a wild experiment just to put\nsalt directly into the brain\nconcentrated saline solution yeah good\nand he found this tiny region in and\naround the hypothalamus that if you um\nif you infuse salt in this region the\ngoats will they'll drink like eight\nliters of water in five minutes just\ncrazy right and then he and so he read\nokay this must be the osmo sensor and\nthen he went back and uh stimulated\nthose neurons and just same thing go\njust drinks like crazy and so now we\nknow there's this couple small regions\nin around the hypothalamus one's called\nthe sub fornical organ another one's\ncalled well it doesn't really matter\nwhat they called but basically uh uh uh\nthat have these Osmos sensors one of the\ninteresting things about the regulation\nof fluid balance is you face some of the\nsame challenges we just talked about\nwith the regulation of food consumption\nwhich is that you have this Behavior\nthis ingestive behavior that uh uh leads\nto replenishment of the body but there\nare these delays right so if you're\nthirsty and you drink a glass of water\nit can take on the order of sort of 20\nto 30 minutes for the water to be\nabsorbed absorbed into your blood for\nthe blood to be rehydrated and then for\nthese Osmos sensors that Bank Anderson\ndiscovered in your brain to be uh uh to\nbe sort of sense that and return to\nnormal activity but of course if you had\nthe experience of drinking a glass of\nwater you know that you can quench your\nthirst within minutes right and so how\ndoes that work within seconds even so\none of the other sort of experiments we\ndid early in my lab was to to ask that\nquestion um by basically recording for\nthe first time the activity of these\nneurons that bank had discovered by\nputting the salt in the ghost we went\nback to them now in mice mice have the\nsame neurons you have the same neurons\nand recording their activity when a\nthirsty mice drinks and asks what\nhappens and um what we saw was that the\nneurons don't wait until the blood is is\nrehydrated um they also don't do what\nthe arrp neurons do is meaning they\ndon't look at the water and predict how\nmuch water they're going to drink but\ninstead they get a signal from the mouth\nwhich every time the mouse takes a lick\nof water their activity goes down a\nlittle bit and basically they track in\nthat way the volume of water that's\npassed through the mouth um they also\nget the signal from the blood relaying\nthe osmolarity of the blood and they\ncompare these two and basically when the\nmouse is drank enough in order to in\norder for the animal to predict that the\nblood osmolality is going to return to\nnormal then the animal stops drinking\nbeautiful yes is beautiful right like\nthe brain is essentially predicting with\nit sounds like a high degree of accuracy\nhow much water one needs to drink\nlinking it to the the pleasure and uh of\ningesting good clean water under\nconditions where we're thirsty in\nanticip PA of adjusting blood osmolarity\nin 20 minutes exactly I mean it's um\nyeah I mean this is the kind of thing\nthat just it Delights me because it just\nmeans the brain as a predictive organ is\njust is\nso accurate it also explains some uh\nsome sort of funny aspects of thirst\nthat you may have noticed from everyday\nexperience so so you know one one idea\nis that just cooling your mouth can sort\nof quench your thirst right so if you're\nin the hospital and you're not allowed\nto drink any fluids they'll give you ice\nchips to suck on to sort of quench your\nthirst so why is that and so one idea is\nthat perhaps because water is usually\ncooler than your body that sensation of\nwater pass it always cools your mouth\nand so you learn or maybe it's a Nate\nthat just cooling of my mouth means that\nbasically I'm going to be\nrehydrated so Chris this was experiment\ndone by grum Chris Zimmerman Chris um\ndid the same thing where he was\nrecording these thirst neurons just put\na cold piece of metal on the mouse's\ntongue and you can see when you do that\nthese thir go down in activity and then\nyou remove the cold piece of metal and\nthey go back up amazing so a lot of\nthese these sort of oddities of everyday\nexperience have to do with how the\nsystem is evolved to make the prediction\nuh about what's going to happen to the\nbody I mean few things are as rewarding\nas the sensation of drinking really nice\nclean cold water when one is very\nthirsty when my lab was in San Diego I\nused to take my dog um hiking in Palomar\nMountain and one day you know I really\nscrewed up he was a Bulldog Mastiff they\noverheat easily and it was a lot warmer\nthan we thought we ran out of water it\nwas a actually dangerous situation for\nhim we got down to the bottom of the\nhill thankfully with him still alive and\nthere's this pump that pumps what is I\nwas told with spring water and it came\nout you know really cold and you could\njust see him fill back up with life yes\nI filled back up with life knowing he\nwas filling back up with life and it was\nit was unlike the the kind of reward\nthat one experiences with food when\nyou're hungry absolutely it's like that\nthat basic critical need for water\nabsolutely um under conditions where\nyou're clearly hydrated is like nothing\nelse it's it's delicious in a way that\nno food is delicious I would like to\nactually say something about this so so\nthat distinction you made is really\ninteresting between hunger and thirst so\nwhen you stimulate these neurons that\nmake an animal thirsty the mice hate it\nthey will do anything to avoid something\nthat artificially makes them thirsty so\nwe can artificially stimulate these\nthirst neurons create a state of virtual\nthirst um they'll lever press hundreds\nof times to make it stop the same\nneurons that the neurons I talked about\nthat control hunger the arrp neurons\nthey actually don't so much um they\nwon't really do much of anything to shut\nthem off that raises the question why do\nthe animals eat then when you stimulate\nthe hunger neurons and we think the\nprimary thing that the hunger neuron\nstimulation does is it make food itself\nmore attractive it makes the food more\ndelicious more of an attractive\nmotivational magnet it makes the\nexperience of eating more pleasurable\nbut it is not itself the most unpleasant\nState at least the mice aren't willing\nto do that much whereas for thirst I\nthink you know dehydration and thirst is\nreally just unpleasant and animals just\nwant to avoid that and so I think that\ndistinction is is is very real I think\nthere are two different motivational\nmechanisms for hunger and thirst hunger\nis mostly about the reward of food\nthirst is mostly about this is just\nreally unpleasant and removing that\nunpleasant exactly and you had a paper\nwhich I was going to ask you about so I\nwill entitled The forbrain Thirst\ncircuit drives drinking through negative\nreinforcement yes um and I'm guessing\nthat paper illustrates exactly the point\nyou just made so it's a forbrain circuit\num so does that mean that there's some\nelements of learning and cognition\naround this or are we broadly speaking\nabout the for brain for instance the\nhypothalamus being in the in the for\nbrain so yeah it's interesting um so so\nThe Thirst circuit for whatever reason\nis mostly in the forbrain so um the\nneurons that so we talked about the NTS\nand the area Posta being important for\nhunger and sign signals from the\ngut those are the a arosta is a\ncircumventricular organ meaning it's\noutside the blood brain barrier there's\nonly a couple of these in the brain the\nneurons that control thirst are located\nin the two circumventricular organs in\nthe forbrain one is called the sub\nfornical organ the other one is called\nthe ovlt but they're just acronyms but\num so why it evolved to have The Thirst\nneurons more in the forbrain and the the\nneurons that sense nutrients more in the\nhind brain is a little bit unclear and\nso there is definitely an element of\nlearning but um a lot of this is those\nneurons are also just directly sensing\nthe blood and sensing changes in in both\nthe concentration of salt in the blood\nand then also hormones like Angiotensin\nthe drive thirst I was going to ask you\nthis earlier but it seems appropriate to\nask now a colleague of mine at Stanford\nin the psych ology Department uh Dr Ali\ncrumb who studies mindsets um has done\nsome interesting experiments where\npeople are told that a given milkshake\nis calorically dense other people are\ntold that a milkshake is calorically\nsparse um both groups independently\nconsume the milkshake um and then they\nmeasure things like um hormone responses\nin the bloodstream that are associated\nwith satiety and and what she finds is\nthat um even hormone responses\num to the\nsame Shake meaning the same amount of\ncalories fat sugar Etc can be\nsignificantly modulated based on what\nwe're told mhm um and it extends into\nsome other perhaps even more interesting\nareas in my opinion whereby if people\nare told that let's say a given meal\nthat has a small piece of fish uh\nserving a vegetables and a a\ncarbohydrate is yes perhaps a little bit\ncalorically sparse compared to what one\nwould normally eat at a given meal but\nthey're told this is a highly nutritious\nmeal this is good for you yes then just\nthat mere\nknowledge can drive more satiety better\nfeelings about the meal even I believe I\nhave to double check on this but as I\nrecall a heightened sense of of it\ntasting really good so humans are very\num susceptible to the in this case the\neither inaccurate in the case of the\nmilkshake experiment or accurate\ndescriptions of food meaning they shape\nour our perception of whether or not\nsomething is good for us tastes good or\nnot and whether or not it leads to more\nor less\nsatiety um and I think this is important\ngiven the Obesity crisis you to say\nnothing of these drugs that are coming\nout uh whereby people often associate\ndieting with deprivation and pain but if\nthey understand that certain foods are\nnutritious that can at least partially\noffset some of the um pain of caloric\nrestriction what are your thoughts on on\nthat yeah um well I one thing I've been\ntalking about is how a lot of these\ncircuits are anticipatory they're making\npredictions they're trying to estimate\nwhat's happening in the future and I\ntalked about how these arrp hunger\nneurons how they can sort of see the\nfood or get input about the sight smell\nof food and in that way predict how many\ncalories the mouse is going to eat but I\nmean this is a mouse right this is all\nbased on a mouse and a mouse has you\nknow a thousand times fewer n than you\ndo as a person right so the\ncomputational capacity that the human\nbrain has to make these predictions um\nis just vast compared to these and these\nmice are already doing amazing things\nright so when you think about then what\nis the human brain able to do in terms\nof anticipating changes in nutritional\nState and how information that you're\ngiven can change uh uh uh the expected\nphysiologic outcomes I mean you're right\nI mean there's there's there's just this\nwhole other element that it's very hard\nto study because it's happening in the\nbrains of humans and we can't do these\nkinds of experiments um but I'm sure\nthat's very important I mean so I talked\na little bit about about these flavor\nnutrient conditioning experiments these\nare the experiments where essentially an\nanimal learns to uh uh uh consume a\ncertain flavor because it learns it's\ngoing to be associated with nutrients\nlater sort of the Paradigm for how you\nlearn to consume bitter vegetables\nbecause they're good for you and you get\nnutrients so people have also done those\nexperiments in humans and that does work\nbut what they've discovered is it's very\nsensitive to what you tell the humans\nabout the thing that they're going to\nconsume so if you put nutritional labels\nwhere you show the different numbers of\ncalories then basically they sort of\nadjust their expectations and nothing\nhappens so it really has to be that sort\nof it's very sensitive to to what what\ninformation you give them before the the\nexperiment happens so uh uh I think\nthat's an example of that kind of thing\nwithout any pressure for it to be\nprescriptive um how do you approach\neating um given the knowledge that you\nhave about food I like to assume that\nyou can sit down to a meal and not think\nabout your agrp neurons too much or any\nof that but given that you have deep\nknowledge in this um has it shaped um\nkind of how you think about food\ncravings your own you don't have to\nreveal what those are even if they exist\num how you uh observe the eating\nbehavior of others um and yeah what how\nhas knowledge uh shaped your your\nfeeding Behavior well I try not to think\ntoo much about my agrp Neons when I'm\neating I would hope I would hope I think\nit gets it gets um I think you know the\ncircuitry is so complex and we're just\nbeginning to see what's happening so I\nwouldn't I wouldn't use that kind of\ninformation at this stage in we're just\nbeginning too prescriptively but I think\nI think there is a set of you know basic\nrecommendations from physiology and\nNeuroscience very simple things you've\nprobably talked about with people on\nyour podcast before um for sort of\nshaping your diet to be healthier to\nlimit food intake so um one we've\nalready talked about is limiting\nconsumption of ultra processed food\neating more Whole Foods for lots of\ndifferent reasons um because it's\nthey're more satiating because they're\ndon't have this sort of engineered\npalatability that causes you to\novereat another big one which I'm sure\nyou've talked about with some of your\nguests is is protein consumption making\nsure you get adequate protein\nconsumption both because there's this\nconcept of protein leveraging so if you\ndon't eat a minimum amount of protein\nthat's going to cause you to eat more\ncalories just to try to achieve that\nminimum amount of protein also just\nbecause protein's more satiating and\nalso because there's this idea ofer\neffect of food and so you basically burn\nmore calories metabolizing protein than\nsugar or fat how about consumption of\nfluids um during meals you know you I've\nheard it said before that um you know\nwe're not supposed to consume too many\nfluids because it's going to dilute the\nenzymes that that allow us to digest our\nfood I've heard other people say that's\ncomplete um I think that's I've never\nthat's a myth I think I mean I think um\ndrinking water I mean so humans don't\nhave a perfect capacity to determine\nwhether they're hungry or thirsty and so\ndrinking water will ensure your you're\nnot eating because you're hung uh\nbecause you're thirsty um and uh so and\nthere's there's no idea of diluting it I\ndon't think that and you distension\nitself even even though water provides a\nvery limited distension signal the\nexpansion of your stomach and intestines\nis one important way that you that you\nuh terminate feeding and so um and so\nthere is some component of that where\nyou can get distension just from\ndrinking water I say sorry I blured it\nout interesting because I didn't realize\nthat a fluid consumption um only\nprovides a limited signal for dis it's\nnot fluids it's water and so the idea is\nthat that you can fill your stomach up\nwith fluids but the rate at which fluids\nempty out of your stomach depends on\ntheir calorie content so basically if\nyou drink water it empties very rapidly\ninto your intestine and then goes\nthrough your intestine is gradually\nabsorbed if you drink something like a\nglass of orange juice it will empty much\nmore slowly and if you drinking\nsomething that's really high in fat\nreally high in calories it'll empty\nextremely slowly over hours and that's\nbecause there's a negative feedback loop\nfrom the intestine that controls gastric\nemptying so as those first nutrients\nleave your um uh stomach and enter your\nintestine that produces hormones that go\nback and then slow down the rate of\ngastric emptying and the purpose for\nthis is that you don't want nutrients\nentering the intestine too fast that's\nreally unsafe it feels very unpleasant\nand uh it's just your your intestine can\nonly metabolize nutrients so fast and so\nif there's calories then it slows down\ngasping a lot but water just kind of\ngoes through what a beautiful system\nlike there's regulation at at every\npoint right hypothalamus brain\nstem got a rate of emptying based on the\ndifference between water and orange\njuice it's just awesome yeah and that's\npart of the reason I think it's so hard\nto outsmart the system right because you\nknow these you know these neurons are\nmaking predictions based on the sight\nand smell of food but then the gut is\ndoing its own thing it's calculating it\nseparately and relaying that information\nso at every step there are these checks\nbasically they are just confirming that\nwhat you thought happened the first time\nis actually what's really going on and\nso and it's which makes sense because\nit's so important for survival these\nhomeostatic systems are the product of\nyou know so much natural selection which\nI think at least partially explains why\nthousandfold increases in peptide\nhormones like glp1 are required to see\nsignificant long- lasting changes in\nweight exactly um because the system is\nso strongly regulated exactly exactly\nit's hard to beat\nhomeostasis and hard to beat it safely\nbut it sounds like you're more or less\noptimistic about where that whole field\nof of um let's call it anti-obesity\ndrugs is headed I'm very optimistic I\nmean I think look I me I think that it's\nyou couldn't have asked for more so far\nat this stage with these with these glp1\ndrugs um incredible uh weight loss\nunexpected health\nbenefits really safe as far as we can\ntell I mean there it's always possible\nthat some new uh some new side effect\nwill emerge but these drugs are millions\nof people and they've been in a lot of\npeople for a long time now and nothing\nseems to have shown up so um I'm very\noptimistic and I think even beyond that\njust now that the pharmaceutical\nindustry is reinvigorated to investigate\nthis question there's so many different\npeople are going in five years people\nhave so many different options it won't\njust be OIC or mro there will be five\ndifferent 10 different drugs that they\ncan choose from um that have slightly\ndifferent side effect profile slightly\ndifferent efficacy perhaps used for\npeople with slightly different metabolic\nconditions um and so it'll really be a\nwhole pallet of of medicines you can\ntake that will adjust your physiology\nand hunger and it's amazing how well it\num squares with the understanding of the\nbasic biology you know and um and that's\na perfect opportunity for me to uh\nreally just say what uh is in my mind\nand clearly in the minds of everyone\nlistening and and watching which is\nthank you so much for this absolutely\nencyclopedic and exceptionally clear\nexplanation of feeding and thirst and\nsalt regulation and these new drugs that\nare you know in
