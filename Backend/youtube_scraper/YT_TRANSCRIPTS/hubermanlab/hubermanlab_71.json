without further\nado, let's get\nto answering your questions.\nThe first question\nis about resveratrol.\nThe question\nspecifically is, and I\nquote, \"there seems to be a lot\nof conjecture about resveratrol\nand whether or not it\ncan extend lifespan.\nCould you please tell us your\nthoughts on this subject?\"\nOK, well, I will indeed tell\nyou my thoughts on this subject.\nAnd I'll use it\nas an opportunity\nto also give you my thoughts\nabout supplementation\nfor sake of longevity, that\nis, for extending lifespan,\nmore generally.\nSo resveratrol got\na lot of attention\nsome years back\nbecause, at the time,\nit was believed that\nsupplementing with resveratrol\ncould impact certain cellular\npathways that would extend not\njust the lifespan of\nthose individual cells\nbut perhaps the lifespan of the\nentire organism, meaning us,\nhumans.\nAnd as a consequence,\nsupplements\nsuch as resveratrol supplements\nbut also grape seed extracts,\nwhich we know contain a\nfair amount of resveratrol\nor can be converted\ninto resveratrol, also\nreceived a lot of attention\nfor their potential\nto increase lifespan.\nI think by now, 2023,\nit's fair to say\nthat most of that thinking has\nbeen, let's just say, debunked.\nI think that most\npeople understand\nthat while indeed\nresveratrol might\nhave some positive effects on\nthe functioning of our cells\nthat there is very\nlittle, if any,\ndirect evidence that resveratrol\ncan increase lifespan.\nIf you are aware of any data\nto the contrary that is modern,\nis highly controlled,\nand even better,\nwas carried out in human\nstudies or non-human primate\nstudies or even\nmouse studies, please\nput links to those in\nthe comments on YouTube,\nbecause I'd love to see\nthose studies, especially\nrecent studies.\nBut my current\nline of thinking is\nthat resveratrol while it may\nhave certain health benefits\ndoes not seem to\nincrease lifespan.\nNow, with that\nsaid, that doesn't\nmean that things like\nresveratrol or grape seed\nextract are of zero utility.\nIn fact, I take 400 to 800\nmilligrams of grape seed\nextract, usually with a meal.\nIt's just part of my\nstandard supplementation\nstack every single day.\nBut I do that mainly for its\neffects on vascular function\nand blood flow and\na few other effects\nthat grape seed extract\nhas been related to.\nThe data there, I would say,\nare reasonably strong, strong\nenough certainly\nthat when weighed\nagainst the potential downsides\nof taking grape seed extract,\nincluding the cost of\ngrape seed extract,\nlead me to take 400\nto 800 milligrams\ngrape seed extract per day.\nI just do that as a kind\nof general insurance policy\nagainst a number of things.\nAnd it's part of a\nsmall kit of supplements\nthat I take that fall\ninto that category,\nmeaning supplements that appear\nto be very safe, certainly\nat the dosages that\nI just referred to,\nsupplements that\npotentially are having\npositive effects on\nour cells, and that are\nfairly if not very low cost.\nSo that's why I take\ngrape seed extract.\nI do not take it for\nits potential impact\non resveratrol and\nresveratrol-related pathways\nper se and certainly not\nto extend my lifespan.\nSo that basically answers the\nquestion that I was asked,\nwhich is what are your\nthoughts on resveratrol\nfor extending lifespan.\nMy answer was I don't\nthink it extends lifespan.\nBut I take something related\nto resveratrol for other health\npurposes.\nAnd by the way, I\ncertainly wouldn't\nplace grape seed extract\nin my list of top five\nor even top 10 supplements\nif somebody, for instance,\nsaid I want to take anywhere\nfrom one to 10 supplements,\nand I have x amount of budget\nto devote to supplementation.\nAnd I'm thinking about\ntaking grape seed extract.\nWould that be one of\nthe top 10 supplements\nyou would recommend?\nI certainly wouldn't\nput it in the top 10.\nAnd by the way, at some point\nin the not too distant future,\nI will put online--\nso I'll probably do a\npodcast episode-- listing\nout all the supplements that\nI take and the rationale\nbehind those and how long I've\ntaken them and the effects\nthat I've observed both\nsubjectively and in my blood\nwork and what I recommend to\nother people, what I don't\nrecommend to other people,\nwhat's specific to me,\nand so on and so forth.\nBut meanwhile, that's my\nanswer to the question.\nI don't think resveratrol\nincreases longevity.\nAt least, I'm not aware\nof any direct evidence\nfor that in humans.\nNow, with that said, let's\nuse this as an opportunity\nto talk about some of the\nother so-called longevity\nsupplements and drugs that\nare often discussed online\nand elsewhere in terms of their\nefficacy to increase lifespan.\nAbout four or five\nyears ago, there\nwas a sudden and\nincreased attention\non NAD-related pathways\nfor increasing longevity.\nSo the NAD pathway, as some\nof you may already know,\nis a pathway within\nall of our cells.\nThis is a pathway that is\nhighly active in young animals\nand humans.\nBut all animals and humans\nacross the entire lifespan\nmake NAD in their cells.\nIt's related to\ncellular energetics.\nThat is the production\nof energy in cells.\nIt has direct relevance\nto mitochondrial\nfunction and mitochondrial\nfunction to it.\nAnd that's a\ndiscussion unto itself.\nBut suffice it to say that\nthe pathway leading to NAD\nincludes things\nsuch as NR and NMN.\nNR and NMN are considered by\nmany to be precursors to NAD.\nOK, so why am I telling\nyou all these acronyms?\nHere's the deal.\nThe argument was made, in\nfact, by some prior guests\non the Huberman Lab podcast and\nelsewhere that by increasing\nNAD levels in our cells\nthat one could potentially\nextend lifespan.\nAnd there are generally\nthree ways in which people\nhave attempted to do that.\nOK, we'll talk about whether or\nnot increasing NAD in our cells\nactually increases\nlifespan in a moment.\nBut for the time being,\nlet's just talk about some\nof the ways that people\nhave tried to increase NAD\nwithin their brain and body.\nThe most typical ways\nthat people have done that\nis through, until very\nrecently, supplementation.\nAnd so there are supplements\nout there such as NR which we\nknow can increase NAD levels.\nSo this is taken as\na pill or a powder,\ntypically as a\ncapsule or a powder.\nOr by taking NMN which,\nand here there's been some,\nlet's just say,\ndebate as to whether\nor not taking NMN actually\nleads to increases\nin NAD within our\ncells, whether or not\nit can get into our\ncells, whether or not\nit's converted into NAD,\nand so on and so on.\nBut there again, the idea\nwas by taking NAD either\nin capsule form, or\nit's sometimes taken\nas a sublingual powder, that\none could increase NAD levels\nand thereby potentially\nincrease lifespan.\nAnd then there's a third\nway that's commonly\nused to try and\nincrease NAD levels,\nand that's by infusing\nby intravenous infusion,\nor in some cases, by oral\nadministration, either liquid\nor pill form, NAD itself.\nNow, I confess that I have tried\nall three of these approaches.\nOK, so I do indeed take an\nNR supplement every day.\nI take 500 milligrams of NR.\nI also and have separately\ntaken an NMN supplement.\nI take sublingual NMN.\nSo I'll take anywhere\nfrom 1 to 2 grams of NMN\nas a sublingual powder,\nwhich as the name suggests,\nyou put it under your tongue,\nand it dissolves there.\nIt's got this kind\nof tangy flavor.\nAnd the goal for me in taking\nan NR and NMN each day--\nand I should mention that\nsometimes I have just\ntaken NMN or just NR to do the\ncomparison between NR and NMN\nfor me in a subjective way, just\ncomparing what are my energy\nlevels, how do I\nfeel, whether or not\nthere are any side effects.\nAnd then I've also\ntaken them together.\nAnd I've arrived at a\nprotocol where I take\nNR and NMN every single day.\nAnd the goal of that is\nindeed to increase NAD levels\nwithin my system.\nHowever, and I really\nwant to emphasize this,\nI do not take NR and NMN in\norder to increase my lifespan.\nIn fact, at this\npoint in history,\nit's unclear and seems somewhat\nunlikely that increasing NAD is\ngoing to increase lifespan.\nBut I think we should\nalways keep our minds open.\nThere may be data to\narrive in the future that\nshows that actually\ndoes happen in humans.\nNow, there are some animal data\nsuggesting that increasing NAD\neither by taking NR and/or\nNMN can increase lifespan.\nBut frankly, that is not\nwhy I take NR and NMN.\nI take NR and NMN in an\neffort to increase NAD.\nAnd now I realize what I'm about\nto say is entirely subjective.\nAnd I really want\nto highlight that.\nWhat I'm about to\ndescribe is my experience.\nIt is not based on any\npeer-reviewed studies.\nWhen I take NR and\nNMN at the dosages\nI talked about a\nlittle bit earlier,\nit gives me a lot of sustained\nmental and physical energy\nthroughout the day.\nNow, I've always had a lot of\nmental and physical energy.\nBut I'm 48 years old now.\nAnd I'm interested\nin doing anything\nthat I safely can to keep\nthose levels of energy\nas high as is reasonable, right?\nI don't want to\nhave so much energy\nthat I can't sit still\nor so much energy\nthat I can't sleep at night.\nBut I find that when I take\nNR and NMN in the morning--\nso typically, I'll do\nthis before my first meal.\nI don't really regulate how\nclose it is to that first meal.\nSo I'll wake up,\nuse the bathroom,\nhydrate, get my sunlight,\ndo all the things I've\ntalked about on other podcasts.\nBut I'll take my\nNR and NMN sometime\nusually within\nabout an hour or two\nof waking up and typically\nat least 30 minutes\nto two hours before my first\nmeal, which for me usually\narrives around 11:00 a.m.\nSo sometimes I'll take it\nlong before my first meal.\nIn any event, it gives\nme a lot of energy.\nAnd I seem to have that\nenergy throughout the day.\nI have gone periods\nof time where\nI stopped taking NR and/or NMN.\nAnd while I didn't feel\nas if I was completely\ndepleted of energy, I did\nnotice a decrement in energy\ncompared to when\nI took NR and NMN.\nNow, I want to be\nvery, very clear.\nI have no, zero,\nfinancial relationship\nto any company that\nmanufactures NR.\nAnd while I used to have a\nrelationship to a company that\nmade NMN, as of\nrecently, there's\nan FDA ruling that has made NMN\nnot available as a supplement\nin the wider world.\nSo earlier this year--\nthat is in 2023--\nthere was a filing for\nNMN as a experimental drug\nin a clinical trial.\nAnd as a consequence, NMN\nwas listed as a banned or not\nallowed to be commercially\nsold supplement.\nAnd that has to do with\nsome of the legality\naround clinical trials.\nAnd when something is listed\nas an experimental drug,\nit can't be listed\nas a supplement.\nNonetheless, you can still\nfind NMN on the open market.\nYou can find it on Amazon.\nI can't really\nspeak to the purity\nof one source versus another.\nYou'll have to explore\nthat on your own.\nBut I will say this, even\nthough I said it before.\nI have zero financial\nrelationship\nto any company that manufactures\nand sells NMN at this time\nor NR at this time.\nSo the short summary to\nthis whole discussion\nabout NR and NMN is\nthat I take NR and NMN,\nbut I take it because I\nlike how it makes me feel.\nIt increases my energy\nlevels in the morning\nand throughout the day.\nAnd it does so in\na way that tapers\noff nicely in the\nevening, and I can still\nfall asleep, et cetera.\nI do not take it\nwith any expectation\nthat it's going to\nincrease my lifespan,\nsimply because I don't think\nthe data substantiating\nthe extension and\nlifespan are here yet.\nThey may arrive at some point.\nBut I don't think that\nthey are here yet.\nSo there are a good\nnumber of people out there\nthat still take NR and/or NMN\nand are doing so in efforts\nto increase NAD.\nAnd so let's take a moment\nand talk about increasing NAD\ndirectly, because\nthat's something\nthat I have some recent\nexperience with, and that's\nbecoming more common and\nis, yes, still FDA approved,\nat least as far as I know.\nThere are companies that\ncan come to your house,\nor you can go to a\nfacility, and they\nwill give you an NAD infusion.\nSo they will infuse you\ndirectly with NAD into the vein.\nI've done this twice now.\nAnd I will say, as\nmost people experience\nwhen they do an NAD infusion,\nit's pretty darn uncomfortable.\nIn fact, so much so\nthat a lot of people\nhave to take anti-nausea meds in\norder to get the NAD infusion.\nI opted to not take\nthe anti-nausea meds,\nnot because I'm\nparticularly tough,\nbut because I don't like taking\nadditional medication if I can.\nBut I've taken anywhere from\n500 to 1,000 milligrams of NAD\nby infusion.\nI did that at times when\nI was feeling particularly\nrundown or post-illness.\nAnd I did indeed find that after\nthe NAD infusion was complete,\nI felt much, much better in\na number of different ways--\nimproved sleep, improved vigor,\ncoming off those illnesses.\nI felt much better.\nBut again, there is\nno clinical trial\nexploring NAD infusion\nfor sake of vigor,\net cetera, that I am aware of.\nI just happen to\nbe somebody who is\ninterested in exploring these\ntools and techniques from time\nto time.\nAnd I deemed this as safe.\nWhether or not\nit's safe for you,\nyou have to explore\nwith your physician.\nAlso, I do want to reemphasize\nwhat I said a moment ago.\nThose NAD infusions are\npretty darn uncomfortable.\nYou can have the\nperson administering\nthe infusion adjust the\nrate of the infusion\nso that the drip\nis slower, which\nmakes it more tolerable\nas opposed to trying\nto get the whole infusion bag\nin there in 45 minutes or less.\nI just wanted to get the\nwhole thing over with.\nSo I just said, put it in\nas quickly as you reasonably\nand safely can.\nIt took about an hour,\nmaybe 45 minutes to an hour.\nInitially, I felt nauseous.\nI felt like someone was\nstepping on my chest.\nI felt like someone was\nstepping on my legs.\nI felt like, well,\nI just felt lousy.\nI felt so awful.\nAnd then after about\n10 minutes, it passed.\nAnd I felt fine.\nAnd then after the infusion was\ndone, as I mentioned before,\nI felt terrific.\nI was still able to fall\nasleep that night just fine,\nalthough I did make it a point\nto do this earlier in the day.\nI have heard of some people\ndoing NAD infusions later\nin the day and having\nchallenges with sleep.\nBut again, that's\njust anecdotal.\nOr we could call it anecdata,\nif you want, but it's anecdotal.\nIt's generally assumed\nfor obvious reasons\nthat NAD infusions are more\neffective at increasing\ncellular levels of NAD\nthan NR or NMN or both\ntogether, although the direct\ncomparison has not been made,\nas far as I know.\nAnd there's still this\ngeneral question as to\nwhether or not any of this stuff\nis getting into cells directly\nand impacting NAD levels\nin specific cells,\nalthough I think most\npeople assume that the NAD\ninfusions certainly are.\nNow, there are a number of\ndifferent experts out there\nwho debate all the fine points\nof everything that I just said,\npeople like Dr. Charles\nBrenner and people\nlike Dr. David Sinclair,\npeople like Matt Kaeberlein.\nThere are people\nwho really actively,\nand let's just say, heatedly\ndebate all the issues\nthat I just talked about.\nI think the greatest debate\nis around whether or not\nincreasing NAD levels in cells\nactually increases lifespan.\nBut there's also a debate\naround whether or not\nNR is more advantageous than\nNMN, whether or not all of this\nis too premature to\nexplore yet already.\nAgain, I just want to\nrestate for the third time.\nI don't do any of this\nstuff in these NAD pathways\nfor sake of increasing lifespan.\nI do it for sake of the\nvitality and energy effects\nthat I subjectively experience.\nI must say that the NAD\ninfusions are expensive enough,\ninconvenient enough, and let's\njust say uncomfortable enough\nthat I don't see myself\ndoing them very often,\nalthough perhaps maybe doing\nthem a couple of times a year\nor more makes sense\nshould I find myself\nfeeling run down or post-illness\nfatigue or things of that sort.\nI would be very curious\nto learn from any of you,\nthe audience, what\nsorts of things\nyou've experienced\nif perhaps you've\nexplored NR supplementation,\nNMN supplementation, or NAD\ninfusions.\nAnd as I mentioned\nearlier, there's\nnow a growing number\nof different products\nthat claim that you\ncan take NAD orally,\nso either in pill,\ntincture or other forms,\nso no requirement\nfor an infusion.\nBut I'm not aware of any\nstudies that have directly\nlinked oral NAD to\nNAD levels in cells\nand how those two things relate.\nSo lots more important science\nto be done in this area, lots\nmore debate surely to\nbe had, and any time we\ntalk about supplements,\nI just want\nto emphasize several times that\nI do see supplements as indeed\nsupplements.\nI think only by getting your\nlight exposure, sunshine,\nmovement, nutrition,\nstress modulation,\nsocial relationships, et\ncetera, correct should you even\nbegin to consider\nsupplementation,\nbecause supplementation\nis just not\nat the foundation of mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nIt is indeed something\nthat, provided\nit fits within your safety\nand economic frameworks,\ncould potentially\nenhance mental health,\nphysical health,\nperformance in certain ways.\nBut it's certainly\nnot the foundation\nfrom which you build mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nSo now we've talked about\nresveratrol, a little bit\nabout grape seed extract.\nWe've talked about NR and NMN\nand NAD and the NAD pathway.\nThere are a few other\nthings that are commonly\ndiscussed in the longevity\nsphere, let's call\nit, things such as metformin.\nI'll just be very direct and\nsay I do not take metformin.\nAnd I also don't\ntake what some people\ncall the poor man's version of\nmetformin, which is berberine.\nBerberine gives me\nbrutal headaches.\nBerberine lowers blood glucose.\nThat's why I think it's\ngiving me brutal headaches.\nA lot of people\nhave explored or are\nthinking about exploring taking\nmetformin or berberine for sake\nof lowering blood glucose and\nlowering a particular cellular,\nlet's just say, pathway or\na set of molecules, mTOR\nbeing the most common of them.\nmTOR, mammalian\nTarget of Rapamycin,\nis abundant in developing cells.\nIt's responsible for the\ngrowth of individual cells.\nAnd the amount of\nmTOR in our cells\ntapers off across our lifespan.\nmTOR and its\npathways is something\nthat I've actually worked\non fairly extensively\nin my laboratory in the\ncontext of the regeneration\nof the visual system.\nSo I'm very familiar with it.\nAnd for sake of convenience\nand ease in this conversation,\nwe can just think\nof mTOR as something\nthat's abundant in\ncells during development\nand any time cells\nare growing, including\nthe growth of tumor\ncells, and cellular growth\nat any stage of the lifespan.\nSo the logic that\npeople have waged\nis that drugs like metformin\nor compounds like berberine\nthat reduce mTOR levels or\nimpact the mTOR pathway in ways\nthat lead to net\ndecreases in mTOR,\nthe logic is that could\nsomehow increase lifespan.\nThere's also the logic that\nfasting can reduce mTOR\nwhich can increase lifespan.\nI don't think there's any\ndirect evidence for that\nyet, however, at\nleast not in humans.\nSo I'll tell you.\nI don't take berberine for the\nreasons I mentioned before.\nIt makes me feel uncomfortable.\nNot psychologically\nuncomfortable,\nit makes me feel\nphysically uncomfortable.\nI don't take metformin because\nexpert colleagues of mine,\nincluding Dr. Peter Attia,\nhave come on this podcast.\nIn fact, we did a collaboration\njournal club podcast\nthat we'll provide a\nlink to in the show\nnote captions during which\nwe, meaning mainly Peter,\nreviewed the peer-reviewed\ndata on metformin and lifespan.\nAnd at least to\nmy understanding,\nat present, there\nisn't sufficient data\nto support taking metformin\nfor increasing lifespan.\nSo that's why I don't take it.\nI may in the future if more\ndata come out and things change.\nBut right now, I see no\nreason to take metformin\nto increase my lifespan.\nSo I don't take metformin.\nSimilarly, there's\na lot of discussion\nout there about rapamycin.\nRemember mTOR, mammalian\nTarget of Rapamycin,\nis so named because it's a\ntarget of this drug, which\nis used largely as\nan anticancer drug\nbut has other purposes as well.\nRapamycin is actively\nunder investigation,\nwhich makes it sound like\nthere was a crime committed.\nBut as far as I\nknow, there wasn't.\nUnder active\nscientific exploration\nwould be the more\naccurate way to say it,\nby excellent researchers such\nas Dr. Matt Kaeberlein up\nat the University of\nWashington in Seattle.\nHe's been looking at\nrapamycin for its ability\nto extend lifespan, focusing\non many different species,\nincluding dogs.\nSo he has a dog\nlongevity project.\nSo that's really interesting.\nDr. Peter Attia has talked\na lot about rapamycin\nand did a recent\npodcast about rapamycin\nwith not only Matt\nKaeberlein but one\nof the experts in\nthe world on mTOR.\nSo I invite you to check\nout that podcast if you\nwant to learn about rapamycin.\nSo there is a fair\namount of understanding\nabout the biological pathways\nof rapamycin and mTOR and so on.\nAnd there are\nclinician physicians,\nlike Peter as well\nas others, who\nare quite excited about\nthe potential for rapamycin\nto extend lifespan, although\nyou have to go directly\nto Peter to find out\nexactly what he's doing,\nwhether or not he's\ntaking rapamycin or not.\nI certainly can't speak for him.\nBut at present, I\ndon't take rapamycin.\nWhy don't I take rapamycin?\nWell, I don't take rapamycin\nbecause at least to my eye,\nthe data at present\ndon't justify\nthat for sake of\nincreasing lifespan.\nThat is not to\nsay that rapamycin\nisn't an effective drug for the\ntreatment of various cancers\nand for other purposes.\nBut for me, at\nthis point in time,\nI just don't see a\ngood reason for me\nto take rapamycin relative to\nsome of the, let's just say,\nsubstantiated potential\nside effects of rapamycin.\nIt is a drug that I\nthink can be taken safely\nunder certain conditions but has\nenough of a side effect profile\nthat I'm not\ninterested in taking it\nfor sake of increasing\nlifespan at this time.\nSo no metformin, no\nrapamycin for me right now,\nperhaps in the future.\nI've listed out\nthe things that I'm\nperfectly willing and happy\nto do, grape seed extract, NR\nand NMN, the\noccasional NAD infusion\nto increase NAD directly,\nand for the time being,\nI've decided to stay away\nfrom metformin and rapamycin.\nBut of course, any\nand all of that\ncould change going\nforward depending\non the data that are published\nand my own experiences.\nAs a final point on this,\nI want to again emphasize\nthat the foundation of a\nquality life and a long life\nis most certainly going to\ncome from the basics, perhaps\nthe most fundamental\nand important of which\nis to get sufficient amounts\nof quality sleep each night.\nWe know that not\ndoing that can indeed\nreduce your lifespan if not\ndirectly, then certainly\nindirectly by increased\nnumber of accidents\nand certainly being far\nless happy and energetic\nduring the day.\nSo that's fundamental.\nAlso, and this is very\nimportant to emphasize--\nand here I'm essentially\nborrowing the words straight\nout of Dr. Peter Attia's mouth.\nSo forgive me, Peter.\nThis won't be nearly\nas eloquent or succinct\nas Peter would make it.\nBut it is very, very clear\nthat at present there\nis no supplement or drug\nfor increasing longevity\nthat even comes close to the\nknown improvements in health\nmetrics that relate to longevity\nthat come from getting quality\nsleep and especially from\ngetting sufficient amounts\nof quality exercise.\nSo that means both a combination\nof cardiovascular exercise,\na minimum of 180 to 220 minutes\nof so-called zone 2 cardio\nper week.\nSo that's cardio that\nyou can carry out\nwhile still maintaining\na conversation\nbut should you increase\nthe intensity any more,\nyou would have a hard time\ncompleting your sentences.\nBut in addition to that also\ndoing some VO2 max work,\nso getting your heart rate way,\nway up at least once per week,\nand also, of course, doing\nresistance training either\nwith weights, machines\nor bodyweight,\ndoing that at\nsufficient intensity,\nsix sets minimum per\nbody part per week\nto maintain not just\nmuscular size and strength\nbut equally important,\nperhaps even more important,\nmaintaining nerve to\nmuscle connectivity,\nwhich correlates with\ncognitive function\nand a number of other\nimportant longevity metrics.\nSo again exercise, sleep,\nquality nutrition, quality\nsocial connection,\nwhich means eliminating\nas best you can toxic\nsocial connection\nand increasing quality social\nconnection, people that you\nlike and enjoy spending time\nwith and feel enriched by,\nstress modulation, all of\nthese things are so key.\nAnd of course, getting morning\nsunlight, all of those things\ncombine to have a huge out-sized\neffect compared to anything\nthat you could take in\npill, capsule or infusion.\nSo before even considering\ntaking any supplement or drug\nto increase your longevity or\neven for increasing vitality\nfor that matter, get those\nbasics of sleep, sunlight,\nnutrition, movement, stress\nmodulation, or stress control,\nI should say, and\nrelationships down.\nGet those right.\nAnd get that morning sunlight\nto set your circadian rhythm,\nbecause of course,\nyour circadian rhythm\nis what anchors it all.\nAnd I'd be completely\nremiss if I didn't emphasize\nyet again that any time you're\nthinking of adding a supplement\nor removing a supplement\nfrom your regimen\nor adding a prescription drug\nor removing a prescription drug,\nyou absolutely\nshould consult you're\nboard-certified physician.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nAsk Me Anything sessions plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast premium channel,\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's to raise\nsupport for the standard\nHuberman Lab podcast\nchannel, which of course,\nwill still be continued to be\nreleased every Monday in full\nlength-- we are not going to\nchange the format or anything\nabout the standard\nHuberman Lab podcast--\nand to fund research, in\nparticular research done\non human beings, so not animal\nmodels but on human beings,\nwhich I think we all\nagree is a species\nthat we are most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically fund\nresearch that is aimed\ntoward developing\nfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel,\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcast\nand other media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the kind\nof research that\nprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow, an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generously\noffered to do a\ndollar-for-dollar match\non all funds raised for research\nthrough the premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science-related tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMAs.\nYou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions.\nAnd you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent such as transcripts\nof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.\nAnd again, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\npremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
