    "video_title": "Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: How to Understand Emotions | Huberman Lab Podcast",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Lisa\nFeldman Barrett Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett\nis a distinguished professor of\npsychology at Northeastern University\nshe also holds appointments at Harvard\nMedical School and Massachusetts General\nHospital where she is the chief\nscientific officer of the center of law\nbrain and behavior Dr Barett is\nconsidered one of the top World experts\nin the study of emotions and her\nlaboratory has studied emotions using\napproaches both from the fields of\nPsychology and Neuroscience indeed today\nyou will learn about the neural circuits\nand the psychological underpinnings of\nwhat we call emotions you will learn\nwhat emotions truly are and how to\ninterpret different emotional states you\nalso learn how emotions relate to things\nlike motivation Consciousness and affect\naffect is a term that refers to a more\nGeneral State of brain and body that\nincreases or decreases the probability\nthat you will experience certain\nemotions during today's discussion Dr\nFeldman Barrett also teaches us how to\nregulate our emotions effectively as\nwell as how to better interpret the\nemotional states of others you'll also\nlearn about the powerful relationship\nthat exists between our emotional states\nand the movement of our body in fact\nmuch of today's discussion is both\npractical and will be highly informative\nin terms of the mechanisms underlying\nemotions and it is likely to also be\nsurprising to you in a number of ways it\ncertainly was surprising to me I've been\na close follower of Dr Feldman Barrett's\nwork over many years now and have always\nfound it to be tremendously informative\nand when I say her work I mean both her\nacademic published papers as well as her\npublic lectures that she's given and her\ntwo fabulous books on emotions in the\nbrain the first one entitled how\nemotions are made and the second book\nwhich includes information about\nemotions but extends beyond that\nentitled s and a half lessons about the\nbrain as you'll see from today's\ndiscussion Dr Feldman Barrett is not\nonly extremely informed about the\nneuroscience and psychology of emotion\nshe's also fabulously good at teaching\nus that information in clear terms and\nin actionable ways you'll also notice\nseveral times she pushes back on my\nquestions in some cases even telling me\nthat my questions are ill posed and I\nhave to tell you that I was absolutely\ndelighted that she did that because\nyou'll see that every time she did that\nit was with the clear purpose of putting\nmore specificity on the question and\nthereby more specificity and Clarity on\nthe answer which of course she delivers\nby the end of today's discussion you\nwill have both a broad and a deep\nunderstanding of what emotions are and\ntheir origins in our brain and body you\nwill also have many practical tools with\nwhich to better understand and navigate\nemotional states and moreover you'll\nhave many practical Tools in order to\nincrease your levels of motivation and\nbetter understand your various States of\nConsciousness before we begin I'd like\nto emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is eight sleep\neight sleep makes Smart mattress covers\nwith cooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\non this podcast about the fact that\nsleep is the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance one of\nthe key things to getting a great\nnight's sleep is to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nand that's because in order to fall and\nstay deeply asleep your body temperature\nhas to drop by 1 to 3° and in order to\nwake up in the morning feeling refreshed\nyour body temperature actually has to\nincrease by 1 to 3° with eight sleep\nit's very easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nit's a mattress cover that allows you to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment at the beginning middle and\nend of your night and in doing so allow\nyou to fall and stay stay deeply asleep\nthroughout the night and wake up feeling\nextremely refreshed I started sleeping\non an eight- sleep mattress cover well\nover 2 years ago and it has greatly\nimprove the quality of my sleep if you'd\nlike to try eight sleep you can go to\n8sleep.com\nhuberman to save up to $150 off their\npod 3 cover eight sleep currently ships\nin the USA Canada UK select countries in\nthe EU and Australia again that's\n8sleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by levels levels is a program that\nlets you see how different foods and\nbehaviors affect your health by giving\nyou real-time feedback using a\ncontinuous glucose monitor one of the\nmost important factors impacting your\nimmediate and long-term health is the\nway that your body manages its blood\nglucose or sometimes referred to as\nblood sugar levels to maintain energy\nand focus throughout the day you want to\nkeep your blood glucose steady without\nbig spikes or dips using levels you can\nmonitor how different types of foods and\ndifferent food combinations as well as\nfood timing and things like exercise\ncombined to impact your blood glucose\nlevels I started using levels a little\nover a year ago and it gave me a lot of\ninsight into how specific Foods were\nspiking my blood sugar and then leaving\nme feeling tired for several hours\nafterwards as well as how the spacing of\nexercise and my meals was impacting my\noverall energy and in doing so it really\nallowed me to optimize how I eat what I\neat when I exercise and so on such that\nmy blood glucose levels and energy\nlevels are stable throughout the day if\nyou're interested in learning more about\nlevels and trying a continuous UC Co\nmonitor yourself go to levels. l/\nhuberman right now levels is

Feldman Barrett\nwelcome wow it's my pleasure to be here\nI've wanted to talk to you for a very\nlong\ntime I'd like to talk about emotions I\nthink every everyone has a sense somehow\nof what an emotion is feeling happy\nfeeling sad\nfeeling excited\nfeeling uh Curious perhaps is even an\nemotion I don't know you'll tell us what\nare the core components what are the\nsort of\nmacronutrients of a of an emotion uh\nbecause I know there's a debate about\nwhether or not we should be talking\nabout emotions versus States but what is\nan\nemotion we all are familiar with what\none feels like to us but from a\nscientific perspective how do you define\nan emotion well SCI this is a scientist\ndebate about this um nobody in the last\n150 years has ever been able to agree on\nwhat an emotion is um and I think from\nmy perspective the interesting but\ntricky bit is that anytime you want to\ntalk about what the basic building\nblocks are of emotion none of those\nbasic building blocks are specific to\nemotion so for example there are a group\nof scientists who will tell you well an\nemotion is a coordinated response where\nyou have a change in um some physical\nstate a change in the brain a change in\nthe physical state um which um leads you\nto make a particular facial expression\nso you've got physiological changes in\nthe body changes in the brain changes in\nthe face or in motor movements\nokay but that describes basically every\nmoment of your life um your face is\nalways moving in some way if it wasn't\nyou would look like an avatar basically\nso we're we're constantly engaged in in\nmovements and those movements have to be\ncoordinated with the physiological\nchanges in the body because whether\nwe're whether we're in a state that we\nwould conventionally call emotion or not\nbecause the physiology is supporting\nthose it's supporting the you know the\nglut glucose and the oxygen and all the\nthings that you need to make uh\nmovements of your body and of course all\nthese movements are being coordinated by\nyour brain so of course there's a\ncoordinated set of um features that\ndoesn't really describe how emotions are\ndistinct from any other experience that\nyou have but the the claim was for a\nreally long time that there would be\ndiagnostic patterns okay so when\nsomething triggered fear\nyou would have an increase in heart rate\nand you would have um a propensity to\nrun away or to freeze or um not just to\nfall asleep although that is something\nanimals do when they are faced with a\npredator but that's not part of the\nwestern stereotype for fear so that\nwasn't what scientists were looking for\nand um and also that you would make a a\nparticular facial expression which was\npresumed to be the universal expression\nof fear where you widen your eyes and\nyou get gasp\nlike um that facial set of facial\nmovements in other cultures like in\nmelanesian culture for example is um is\na symbol of threat where you are\nthreatening someone you are threatening\nthem with aggression basically is a war\nface but in Western cultures that's the\nthe face that Western scientists\nbelieved was the you know the the\ndistinctive part of that distinctive\npattern for fear and so the way that\nscientists defined emotion for a long\ntime was these kind of um states where\nyou'd see this diagnostic Ensemble of\nsignals and that would mean that anytime\nsomeone showed one of those signals they\nmay move their face in a particular way\nor their heart increased at a particular\ntime you'd be able to diagnose them as\nbeing in a state of fear as opposed to a\nstate of anger or sadness or whatever\nthe empirical evidence um just doesn't\nbear that out and so it was kind of a\nmystery the mystery is how is it that\nyou feel angry or sad or happy or you\nknow full of gratitude or awe how is it\nthat you experience these moments but\nscientists can't find a single set of\nphysical\nmarkers that correspond with each state\ndistinctively right that in a way that\nyou could tell them apart that's a that\nwas a really big puzzle for a really\nlong\ntime I have to ask you about this\nperhaps myth perhaps truth about facial\nexpressions and\nemotions because as you were explaining\nthe core components of\nemotions I had to think back to to the\nclassic textbook images of the different\nfaces associated with fear with delight\nwith confusion on and on we we will get\nto that and your opinions on that\nscientifically informed opinions of\ncourse but there is a bit of a myth that\nthe emotion system and the facial\nexpression system run in both directions\nfor\ninstance people will say if you smile\nit's harder to feel sad or\nanxious I can't say that's been my\nexperience but I very well could be\nwrong so we know that when people's\nemotional states change their facial\nexpressions often will change right if\nyou see someone crying on the street um\nversus somebody smiling really big you\nwe can make some assumptions about what\nmight be going on at uh internally for\nthem but put simply is it true that\nchanging one's facial expression\ncan direct shifts in the brain and body\nperhaps that change our emotional states\nif you'll permit me what I would say is\nthat your question is ill\nposed so first of all it presumes that\nthere's an emotion\nsystem and that there's a facial\nexpression system now clearly there's a\nsystem for moving facial muscles okay\nbut a movement is not the same as an\nexpression a movement is a movement an\nexpression is an interpretation of the\nmeaning of a movement not all movements\nof the face are\nexpressions um and this is a you know a\nproblem it's a problem in science um in\nit's often the case uh I think in my\nexperience in the science of emotion but\nelsewhere to that scientists in their\nefforts to make their work\num meaningful to people will try to\ninterpret their findings in in ways that\nuh the average person would um find\ninteresting or the way that a physician\nwould find interesting or a teacher or\nwhat have you to be able to use this\ninformation but then they forget that\nthey're actually making an\ninterpretation and they start to refer\nto their observations with the labels of\ninterpretation so facial movements are\nfacial movements people move their faces\nand that those movements have meaning\nbut they're not always to express an\ninternal state in fact one might think\nthat they're very rarely to um Express\nan internal state so I don't know that\nthere's a facial expression system\neither so that's there is certainly like\nI said um there there's circuitry for\nmoving a face but um but what those\nmovements mean um is highly variable and\nso that would be my second point that\nwhere I would say when you see someone\ncrying on the street you are not looking\nonly at their face you might be\naware um that you're focusing on their\nface that might be the part of the\nentire sensory Ensemble that you are\nfocusing your attention on but your\nbrain is taking in an entire ensemble of\nsignals as you know it's taking in not\njust the you know movements of the face\nthat tears or whatever it's taking in\nall of the the entire sensory array The\nSounds the smells what's going on inside\nyour own body your brain is being um\nbombarded with signals from from all of\nthose sources and when it's making an\nmeaning out of any signal it's doing it\nin an ensemble of signals so research\nshows that baby's\ncries aren't acoustically specific to\nwhen they're tired or hungry or right um\nthe you can I can show you a video\nwithout context and show you someone\ncrying and um you might make a judgment\nyou might think make the stereotypic\njudgment in the west oh that person is\nsad and then we pan out and really you\nknow it's a little girl whose dad just\ncame home from Iraq or something right\nso brains are always interpreting faces\nin context they're making guesses this\nis something that I've talked about\nquite a bit that we don't read movements\nin people we don't read emotions in\nfacial Expressions we make inferences\nabout the emotional meaning of facial\nmovements and we do it in an ensemble of\nother signals the the context uh as you\nif you will and that's really what's\nwhat's happening so um do I think that\num that there is feedback from the face\nto the brain sure I mean there's\nfeedback from every muscle but there's\nthis constant conversation between the\nbrain and the body um the brain is\nsending motor commands the body is you\nknow has sensory surfaces which are\nsending signals back to the brain so if\nthe face is influencing the brain it's\ndoing so in a way that's not special it\nit's doing it in a way that that works\nfor all other parts of your body too and\nI\nguess what I would say this kind of\nlong-winded answer\nbut over time your brain has\nlearned that certain patterns of signal\nover\ntime um recur and so if you're smiling\nif your brain is you know telling your\nyour facial muscles to move in a\nparticular way that looks like smiling\num it's happening in a larger Ensemble\nof signals and then the brain is\npredicting what's going to happen next\nbecause it's learned over time\nwhat happens next so probabilistically\nso if you think about that as cause then\nsure but it's not as it's not this\nsimplistic kind of idea that an emotion\nis triggered um uh it\ncauses facial muscles to move in a\nparticular way and therefore if you just\npose your face in in those in that\nparticular Arrangement it that will\nsomehow feed back to the emotion system\nand change that system because there are\nno there is no emotion system in your\nbrain and the the causation just isn't\nthat it's not that simplistically\nmechanistic that makes sense to me I I\nuh frankly never bought the idea that\njust smiling would make me feel happy um\nespecially if my internal state was not\none of Happiness like fighting the\ninternal state also um in the early\n2000s I think it was there was a lot of\ndiscussion about how positioning the\nbody in certain ways you know taking up\nmore space would allow people to feel\nmore powerful and they some of these\nstudies um and uh argued that there were\neven hormonal shifts associated with um\ntaking up more space that were\nassociated with feelings of empowerment\nand then when shrinking of oneself was\nin associated with elevated cortisol\nStates and as I say all this I'm I I\nwant to be clear that um do not take a\nsimplistic view of the nervous system or\nendocrine system and I I didn't um I\ndon't think that you were implying that\neither so want to make sure that anyone\nlistening or watching isn't thinking\nthat uh for instance that cortisol is\nbad cortisol is wonderful and essential\nyou just need it regulate properly or\nthat um the idea that the body and\nemotional states are are inextricably\nlinked makes a ton of sense to me but\nthe idea that you could just you know\ngrab onto one of the nodes in the EM now\nI have to be careful not say emotion\nsystem um like position of the body like\nbeing hunched over makes you depressed\nno that never made sense to me taking up\nmore space makes you feel more uh\npowerful that doesn't it it can't be\nthat way and yet we were told for about\na decade through especially through\npopular press that this stuff was true\num and so what I love about your work is\nthat it includes a neuroanatomical a\npsychological a Network perspective that\nthat there isn't one seat of emotions\nand and so on um so if we could go a\nlittle bit further into the facial\nexpression piece for a moment\nsure I was taught in my Psychology and\nNeuroscience textbooks because it was\nright there in front of me that there\nwere some core categories of facial\nexpression that were Universal cross\ncultures that conveyed something about\nthe internal state of the person that\nthe downward you know lips in the corner\nand and some and maybe even a furrowing\nof the brow was associated with negative\nveent States like sadness perhaps even\ndepression that the opposite of upward\nturn corners of the mouth and widening\nof the eyes was delight and excitement\nsome of that feels pretty true to my\nexperience but how do you and other\nserious scientists of emotions view that\nsomewhat classic literature now yeah so\nI'll just say that my um\nmy journey here my scientific Journey\nwas not one of um attempting to\noverturn um a Century's worth\nof are we alled to swear\nbasically I mean it's just it's like\nit's it's stereotyp it's basically\nWestern stereotypes enshrined as\nscientific uh fact and that sounds like\na pretty harsh thing to say but I think\nI pretty much stand by that at this\npoint\num but for me when I was a graduate\nstudent When I Was An undergraduate in\nuh in Psychology and in physiology and\nin anthropology you know I also had read\nthat Darwin said that there were these\ndistinctive facial expressions that um\nwere coordinated with specific emotional\nstates specific states of the nervous\nsystem this was Darwin's View and I\nassumed it was correct\num until I started to try to use that\ninformation um in the lab and everything\nfell apart you know so when you show\nsomeone in uh a laboratory like a\nstudent or um somebody from the\ncommunity a face a disembodied face\nwhere their the person's eyes are\nwidened in the face and they're gasping\nlike a stereotypic fear\nexpression most of the time they don't\nknow what it\nis and so I would try to use these faces\nand um as stimuli and experiments and\nthey W they weren't working the way that\nthey were supposed to work and there\nwere really going all the way back to\nthe beginning of psychology there were\nalways debates about whether or not this\nwas actually accurate and there's a\nreally interesting story about how\nDarwin came to this idea um which I can\ntell you about but it it's not because\nhe cared about emotion and he was\nbasically taking his own very Western\nviews about emotion to make some claims\nabout Evolution actually so um I have\nmore to say about that and\nabout why it's a problem to take\nanything that anybody said even Darwin\nfrom you know 150 or so years ago or\nwhatever it is and treat it like it's a\nmodern text you know he was writing at a\nparticular time for a particular purpose\num and that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat whatever he wrote is\ntrue um but I'll just tell you what the\nevidence\nsays um that there has been in\nPsychology a debate really vicious\ndebate actually for probably 50 years\nabout the nature of facial expressions\nand whether they are Universal and\nwhether there's this onetoone\ncorrespondence between a particular face\nand like a facial configuration in a\nparticular emotional state smiling in\nhappiness scowling in Anger wrinkling\nyour nose and disgust and so in\n2016 I think the association for\npsychological\nscience um tasked me and some other\nsenior\nscientists uh with attempting to write a\nwhite paper a consensus paper on what\nthe literature actually show so what\ndoes the research actually show if you\nread all the research you know can you\nfind a pattern there does it actually\nreveal anything about whether or not\nfacial expressions are Universal\nparticularly for emotion um and the way\nthey do this they have a journal for\nthis purpose for taking a widely held\nbelief that is highly debated and\nbringing together a panel of experts who\ndisagree with each other at the outset\nand they have to work together to see if\nthey can come to consensus over\nthe\ndata and this is something that you know\npeople have tried in the past and I mean\nthey're really vicious people have been\nvicious with each other over this\nquestion so when we brought together a a\ngroup of people so me several people\nrefused to serve senior scientists\nrefused to serve on this panel but out\nof fear of losing their funding or\nsomething um you know that's a whole\nother conversation about\nwhy SC certain scientists would not want\nto engage W uh with um people who\ndisagree with them um that's an\ninteresting conversation to have but um\nI don't think it's as simple actually as\njust they their careerist or they they\ncare about you know their money or or\nfunding or whatever that would be an\neasy answer but I don't actually think\nthat's what's going on but that's\nanother sort of but anyway so uh there\nwere five of us who got together um all\nsenior scientists all from different\nfields some of us hadn't met each other\nbefore we all knew of each other of\ncourse and we met over Zoom for two and\na half years this is preco because\npeople were all over the world right and\nwe we read over a thousand papers so so\nI was the only one in this group of the\nfive of us who my starting hypothesis\nwas that facial movements are meaningful\nbut they're not there's no one-o-one\ncorrespondence between a particular\nfacial configuration like a\nscowl and anger not not just that it\nwould vary across cultures but that it\nvaries AC for you across situations I\nmean do you scowl every time you're\nangry I don't scowl every time I'm angry\nin fact and I also scowl at times when\nI'm not angry\nso and there are scientific reasons to\nthink that that the that a the\ncollection of facial expressions that\npeople make when they're angry or when\nthey're sad or whatever would be highly\nvariable so that was my starting\nposition and then the there were varying\nfour guys so there was I just refer to\nthem as the guys because it was me and\nfour guys and the guys they all to some\nextent thought that facial expressions\nwere Universal but they had differing\nreasons and all for for for\nhypothesizing that and they\nalso had different commitments degrees\nof commitment to\nthat position but we right off the bat\nsort of agreed that we it didn't matter\nwho was right that was just not relevant\nthe only thing that mattered was that we\ncould come to the consensus over the\ndata and if we couldn't we had to really\npinpoint why like so what would be the\ncritical experiments that would have to\nbe done in order for us to come to\nconsensus over the data and we also\nagreed that um we had all kinds of\ncontingency set up so you know you've\ngot five senior people who are all\nrunning big labs and they're investing\nyou know upwards of three years working\non a paper so if we can't come to\nconsensus what are we going to do are we\ngoing to write one paper and sort of\nwrite about the process or are we going\nto write separate papers or you know but\nwe we had all these contingencies laid\nout but the key here I think is that we\nagreed that we were not going to be\nadversarial about it because it didn't\nmatter who was right and in fact if\nsomebody had to admit they were wrong\nand someone was going to have to admit\nthey were wrong I mean it turns out all\nof us were wrong about something but it\nwe were going to be like supportive of\neach other and and really encourage each\nother um because you know being wrong is\nno one likes to be wrong but for\nscientists to admit they're wrong is\nhard and it's something that we should\nencourage each other to do I think more\nand and more\npublicly and I think the people who do\nthat are really Brave and so that was my\nposition and they all agreed and the\nlong story short here is\nthat two and a half years a thousand\npapers later we all very reasonably came\nto consensus that there was no evidence\nfor facial expressions of emotion being\nUniversal and that instead what is what\nthere's clear evidence of is um that\nfacial expressions the way that people\nmove their faces in in in moments of\nexpression is highly variable\nmeaning sometimes in Anger you scowl\nmeta analyses so statistical summaries\nof many many many studies even in the\nwest show that people\nscowl about 35% of the time when they're\nangry which is more than chance so it\nget you a good publication in you know\nthe proceedings of the National\nAcademy but that means 65 % of the\ntime people are moving their faces in\nother meaningful ways that's not\nscowling so if you actually used a\nscowl um or even you know a scowl in\nblood pressure or you know just maybe\nnot one signal but like a couple signals\nbut you would be wrong more than half\nthe time you would miss more than half\nthe cases and even more\nimportantly I think that that's the\nreliability question so there's low\nreliability for um the the\ncorrespondence between a scowl and anger\nit's above chance so scowling is one\nexpression of anger but it's certainly\nnot the dominant one and there is no\ndominant one it's just highly variable\ndepending on the situation that you're\nin so sometimes when I'm angry I sit\nquietly and plot the demise of my enemy\nyou know sometimes I smile in Anger\nSometimes I Cry in Anger it really\ndepends on the\nsituation um but more importantly half\nof the scowls that people make are not\nrelated to\nanger that means that the\nspecificity is\nagain higher than\nchance but not that much higher than\nchance so if you see someone\nscowling the chances are that they might\nnot be angry they might be concentrating\nreally hard or they might have gas I\nmean there are a lot of reasons why\npeople make a SC owl um and we found\nthis for every emotion category that had\never been studied and I want you to\nnotice what I just did there I'm not I'm\nno longer referring to an emotion as if\nit's an entity or a thing so anger isn't\none thing it's a category of things a\ngrouping of things and if I'm not\nmistaken it includes verbs right that\nlike anger as a set of verb actions in\nthe in the brain and body yes it's a\nprocess it's not an event process\nexactly it's not a noun it's a verb and\nit's a and it's a process but the point\nis that um it's it's a highly variable\ngrouping of\ninstances if you're if you are talking\nabout all instances of anger all\ninstances of anger that you have ever\nexperienced or witnessed um is a highly\nvariable grouping of instances That Vary\nthat they that doesn't mean they're\nrandom but what the body does in Anger\ndepends on what the physical movements\nwill be in anger and that depends on the\nsituation that you're in and what your\ngoal is and um and there are ways to\ntalk about that in Neuroscience terms\nwhich are a little more precise but the\nimportant thing to understand here I\nthink is that we're only talking about\nWestern cultures now the minute that you\ngo outside of the West to or even to the\neast I mean so you know there are other\ncultures you know that have been studied\num like uh China and cultures in China\nin Japan in Korea they they all have\naccess to knowledge about Western\ncultural practices a norm so what\nhappens when you go to you know to\nremote cultures which um have much less\naccess so they it's not like they have\nno access because we live in a\nglobalized world so even hunter\ngatherers in Tanzania the hza have\naccess to Western practices and Norms\nbut much less much less and we did do\nthat and and um and all bets are off\nthere I mean most of the time they don't\neven they don't even understand or\nexperience facial movements as having\nanything to do with emotion so if they\nsaw an emoji of a smiley face would they\njust assume it was a couple they might\nthink it's a face there because as we\nboth know there's some fairly hardwired\nbrain circuitry for the the two eyes and\na and a line beneath it and something in\nthe middle that's pseudo nose that\norganization of just spatial features\ncues up face for both for most prates\nit's really interesting that you say\nthat because yes of course that's true\nbut it's not there at Birth what's there\nat Birth is a preference for that\nconfiguration right so it's it's like\nthere's some and we could talk about why\nthat's there it's actually very\ncontroversial but um but what babies\nwhat newborns Orient to they Orient to\nthat or they Orient to that\nconfiguration but it doesn't have to be\na face and then very quickly they start\nlearning faces because they're exposed\nto fa I mean really the first three\nmonths of life is almost like a massive\ncontinuous tutorial on what faces are\nbecause they're you know being fed and\nand everyone's in your face saw a baby\nlast night and you see the baby friends\nof have a unbelievably cute baby with\nthe big cheeks and you want and there's\nthis desire to see the baby smile right\nso you do the things that and if that\nthe baby shows some sort of facial\nexpression that makes it seem like it's\na little bit um like resist in what\nyou're doing you you stop doing it you\nchange up your strategy and then when\nbaby cracks a smile like now I'm going\nto assume that the baby may or may not\nhave been happy inside um that little\nbaby head um but when they do there's a\nreciprocity then we smile there's a\ntemplate that that's very robust right\nbut I want you to notice though that so\nfirst of all I'm not saying that um that\nrecognizing faces a face as a face is\nnot hardwired it is but it's hardwired\nby not by genes alone right and in fact\nthere's a really wonderful book called\nnot by genes alone basically there's\ncultural inheritance we have the kind of\nnature that requires nurture we have the\nkind of genes that require Early\nLearning we have we need wiring\ninstructions from the world to get the\nrest of the information that we need to\nbe competent culturally competent in our\nin our in our lives and that starts at\nBirth it probably starts before birth\neven um but um in the third trimester\nthere's some evidence of learning fetal\nlearning even in the third trimester so\num the point is not that people aren't\nhardwired for viewing faces or\nrecognizing faces it's just where does\nthat hard wirring come from it's not by\ngenes alone genes aren't the blueprint\nthe brain is expecting certain inputs\nfrom the world and it needs that because\ninfant brains are wiring themselves to\ntheir world and part of that world is\npeople making faces at them and smiling\nand those people happen to also be the\nones who are maintaining who are\nmaintaining that baby's nervous system I\nmean there is reward learning right or\nreinforcement learning right off the bat\nbecause these are the people who keep\nyou comfortable they are the ones who\nfeed you they're the ones who help you\nget to sleep and so on and so forth and\nso you're going to be very very\nsensitive to changes in the\ncontingencies of their behavior your\nbrain as a pattern learner is just going\nto learn those patterns if we know that\nsmiling is more you know smiling is a\ncue for happiness it's because we've\nlearned it and that doesn't mean that\nthat learning isn't hardwired it just\nmeans that it that information got into\nyour brain by cultural inheritance which\nis a part of evolutionary\ntheory in the extended evolutionary\nsynthesis not in the original you know\nnot in the original uh formulation that\nsome people still kind of stick\nto as many of you know I've been taking\nag1 daily since 20 2 so I'm delighted\nthat they're sponsoring the podcast ag1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat's designed to meet all of your\nfoundational nutrition needs now of\ncourse I try to get enough servings of\nvitamins and minerals through whole food\nsources that include vegetables and\nfruits every day but often times I\nsimply can't get enough servings but\nwith ag1 I'm sure to get enough vitamins\nand minerals and the probiotics that I\nneed and it also contains adaptogens to\nhelp buffer stress simply put I always\nfeel better when I take ag1 I have more\nfocus and energy and I sleep better and\nit also happens to taste great for all\nthese reasons whenever I'm asked if you\ncould take Just One supplement what\nwould it be I answer ag1 if you'd like\nto try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman\nto claim a special offer they'll give\nyou five free travel packs plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's\ndrink a1.com\nhuberman so it's far more nuanced uh\nthan it was presented to me in those\ntextbooks and and it sounds like it was\noutright wrong on many dimensions well\ncan I just mention one thing though\nplease this is really serious stuff like\nsometimes people think well you know\nwhat's the big deal this is such a big\ndeal I'll tell you why it's a big deal\nbecause in our culture people believe\nthat they can\nread mental states of other people by\ntheir\nface and they believe it so much that\nit's enshrined in the legal\nsystem and there are people who lose\ntheir lives because juries\nbelieve that they can read remorse or or\nthe lack of it and in fact there was\njust a case um you know last year I\nbelieve where um you know the Innocence\nProject uh got involved because there\nwas a woman who was on death row and\nwhat put her on death row was um a\npolice officer's claim that he could\nread her emotions by her the comportment\nof her face and her\nbody and um and you know uh it was\npossible to get a stay of execution so\nthat she could be retried and you know\num so I'm not saying she was guilty or\nnot guilty I'm just\nsaying what put her on death row was\nevidence that would not be admissible in\na\nscientific um way now um and there are\nthere are lots of cases where judgments\nare made that end up impacting people's\nlives in pretty serious ways so this is\na really serious thing and it's um it's\npuzzling to\nme why it's so it's got such traction\nthis idea that there are these\nUniversal um Expressions that we can use\nto read each other you know um it's it's\njust not true I mean the science just\nit's so overwhelmingly I feel like you\nknow scientists I don't like to use the\nt word you know the FW fact you know\nit's a scary word t word truth but I\nthink in this case I feel like I can I\ncan really at least with a little te I\ncan I can use it you probably have\nparticular facial movements that you\nmake on a regular basis that are tells\nfor you I know I do you know my husband\ncan look at my actions and he can make\nreally decent guesses about what's going\non for me upstairs right but that's\nbecause he's known me for 30 years\nactually 30 years today I should just\nmet each other 30 years ago today but\nhe's you know brains are pattern\nLearners so I'm not saying that\neverything is random and like there's no\nit's all noise I'm saying that there\njust aren't\nthese you know Universal templates they\njust it's not like that and we really\nhave to stop assuming that that that\nthere are well I'm so glad that you're\ngetting that message out there and I'm\nvery thankful that you highlighted the\nseriousness of this um these myths that\nhave propagated and that's a perfect\nsegue into what I was already going to\nask which is um it's based on something\nthat I think is in very much agreement\nwith what you're saying a previous guest\non this podcast I think it was our first\nguest episode Dr Carl di Roth colleague\nof mine at Stanford incredible\nbioengineer um really you know\n0.01% in his you know category of\nscience as well as a practicing uh\npsychiatrist said something which really\nstuck with me over the years which I\nonce heard him say you know we don't\nreally know how other people feel at all\nin fact most of the time we don't even\nknow how we feel and that prompted the\nquestion for me about how good or poor\nare we at gauging our own emotional\nstates and in particular at labeling\nthem both to others and for ourselves\nand and so here's the the direct\nquestion is language sufficient to\ncapture this incredibly complex thing\nthat we're calling emotions so for\ninstance the other day I was in New York\nwith my sister then she left I went out\nfor a bit I was having a pretty good day\nand then I returned to the place where I\nwas staying and I was hit with this\nfeeling of intense loneliness and I\ndon't know why and then I had a bunch of\nideas about how that related to growing\nup and but I was going to see friends\nthe next day and I'm an adult and so I\ncould use some top down regulation and\nsay oh you know maybe I'm a little tired\nor I didn't because I hadn't slept as\nwell the night before I've been pretty\nrested recently and then I actually\nwrote in my journal I I said you know\nmaybe most of feeling good is being\npretty well rested and not in any\nphysical pain that's a big part of\nfeeling good is the absence of fatigue\nand the absence of physical\npain and and then I thought wow that's\njust so basic that's like two bill buing\nblocks is clearly insufficient but then\nI couldn't think of a word to adequately\ndescribe the emotion that came about an\nhour later when I was feeling a little\nbit better but not completely better so\nwas I lonely not really not anymore was\nI sad not really but you know as I had\nheaded out into the city I was thinking\nI don't really have a word for how I\nfeel I'm sort of okay not great not low\nyou know and so I think that we have\nemotional labels I certainly do for Peak\nyou know these Peak emotional states\nsuper happy I loved the time with my\nsister we do this every year this was a\nparticularly good year for us um to do\nthis and and it went really well we were\ntexting back and forth how great it was\nI certainly know what it feels like to\nbe really down in the in the pits I've\ngot language for that but then there's\nthis huge range in between and so I\nguess the simple question is should we\neven trust language as a way\nto understand how we're feeling or are\nthere additional if not better signals\nthat we should perhaps learn to\nelaborate um our understanding of\nemotions\nwith so I'm going to give you a a simple\nanswer and then I'm going to give you a\nmore complicated answer right so the\nsimple answer is no language is not\nsufficient period I think the way that\nyou have well I should say one language\nis not sufficient so English is not\nsufficient and probably French on its\nown is not sufficient and probably\nSwahili on its own is not sufficient\nalthough it's very interesting that the\nthe states that we Mark with words in\neach culture some of them overlap but a\nlot of them don't and it's very very\nuseful to have labels of emotion\nConcepts from other cultures that that\ncapture configurations or a state that\nwe we don't really Mark we don't Mark\nthose and and sort of distinctively pull\nthem out as as different from other\nstates I'd love to know what some of\nthose are oh there there um I should\nhave brought them with me I mean there\nthere are some like there's one there's\na German word which I can't remember the\nname of the word but it's like um the\nexperience of someone having a face that\ndeserves a punch I'm sure someone will\ntell us in the comments someone someone\nwho knows German or spend time there\nplease put that word in in the comments\nbut don't don't punch any another one\nthat's my favorite is um um liot which\nis is um it's a Polynesian um head\nhunting um uh emotion word and it\nmeans um exuberant aggression in a\ngroup like soccer or or head\nhunting right where you're basically um\nor I should say also um in the military\nso when I was listening to m one day A\ncouple of years ago must have been more\nthan that because it's in my book so it\nwas probably more than seven years ago\nI was listening to these guys talk these\nformer um um military uh Personnel talk\nabout being um deployed in a war where\nthey're with their buddies and\nthey're they're basically hunting the\nenemy and they\nfeel exuberant like they're you know and\nand they're it's not that they're happy\nbut they're it's Pleasant and it's very\nintense very high arousal you know and\nin the moment it it seemed right and\nthen they come back um you know and they\nask themselves like they come back and\nso they're now you know their\ndeployments ended now they're back home\nand they're like am I a psychopath like\nI enjoy killing people what is this\nabout and I was thinking no no you just\nexperienced liot and if you had a word\nfor it you would understand that it's a\ngroupy feeling where you're all in it\ntogether and it's really intense and you\nknow they were experiencing the um the\nintensity of of um having their life on\nthe line and and being responsible for\ntheir for their brothers you know and\nsisters in in in their troop you know so\num the the what they would realize is\nit's a perfectly it's perfectly within\nthe range of normal human variation it's\njust that in English we don't have a\nword for it really but there are words\nthere are Concepts in other languages\nright or the other one that I like is\ncalled gigle which is where when you see\na baby who's really cute and you just\nwant to like oh you yesterday evening\nsquee oh my God that kid was so cute\nthose little cheeks are just like\njumping at you and and the parents are\ndelightful people too and they was just\nfacing out cuz they had one of those\noutward facing baby things and it's just\nsort of like yeah it's and I thinkle\nit's called it's gigle gigle oh keigle\nis from the other episode that we did on\nwell it also has to do with babies but\nyeah in a different way um or there's\none in I think there's a Japanese\nword for the despair that you feel when\nyou got a bad\nhaircut really yeah cuz it's I mean it's\nreally is a different kind of feeling\nthan you know because you got to like\nwait for it to grow up you know whatever\nanyways the point being that amazing\nwords for us Mark particular States and\nthey're not all the they're not always\nthe states that other people in other\ncultures care about but I there's a but\nthe even again the phrasing of your\nquestion I just want to come back to and\nI'm not trying to pick at you but feel\nfree what I love is that what what you\nsaid before when you said my question\nwas illposed in your in the answer that\nfollowed it made it very clear why and I\nlearned something about how the the the\nthe not emotion system but the things\nplural that that create emotions work so\nuh feel free I I I grew up in the same\nculture that you did I'm not Canadian by\nbirth but but in the academic culture\nyeah you know I mean the the stuff that\nwe take online by the way folks is\nnothing compared to the kind of hazing\nthat I experienced growing up in uh in\nacademic culture as it was done then I\ndon't know if it's still that way now so\nuh feel free yeah I'm tougher than I\nlook well no I think my point is that\nI'm trying to get at here is that when\nwe ask questions any of us me too\nanybody ask a question there are certain\nassumptions that we're making in order\nto allow us to pose the question and\nsometimes what I'm taking issue with is\nnot the question itself but it's the\nassumptions behind the question right\nand this is a very classic thing in\nphilosophy of science which I know I\njust said the p word philosophy which\nscientists you know usually they roll\ntheir eyes back in their head and fall\nover when you talk about that but I\nthink it's really important so you know\ncan language is language sufficient to\nlabel or to to to gauge emotional states\nkind of sounds like and this is the\nassumption that people make that there's\na state in here called an emotion and\nnow I have to label it I have to\nidentify it\nthat is not how it works like that is\nnot what your brain is doing at all and\nin order to explain what I think is\nhappening and what I my best available\nguess you know like based on what I\nunderstand it's like not even remotely\nthat that is just not a meaningful\nquestion at all um I do think words are\nimportant I just don't think that they\nhave to be insufficient by virtue of\nwhat the brain is actually doing and the\nway that I come at this is just really\ndifferent from a lot of my colleagues so\nreally for a hundred years at least I\nhate when people say things like that\nlike for a hundred years but it really\nis like for for a hundred years at least\nwhat psychologists and neuroscientists\ndo have did and are still doing is they\nstart with a folk experience a folk\ncategory a common sense experience I\nfeel angry uh I'm making a decision um\nhaving a memory I'm remembering\nsomething they start with their\nexperience and then they go looking for\nthe physical basis of that experience in\nthe brain or in you know in the\nbody I think that's really problematic\nbecause not everybody in the world\nactually uses those categories or has\nthose experiences a lot of that has to\ndo with the scientific publication\nprocess one of the most important\nstatements I ever heard is from the late\nTed Jones one of the greatest neur\nanatomists of probably the last 500\nyears\num which was the following he said a\ndrug is a substance that when injected\ninto an animal or a person produces a\nscientific\npaper and in many way foot yeah yeah you\nkind of catch catch you square in the\nface can you go oh right yeah I mean\nbasically every drug disrupts if taken\nan hour or two before sleep changes the\namount of REM sleep that you get so so I\ncould imagine that almost any\nperturbation of the language system the\nbody the facial movements system could\ngive you a quote unquote effect that you\ncould write a paper about yeah but that\ndoesn't mean it has any semblance\nwhatsoever to what's happening in the\nworld when we or other people experience\nemotions and here's the here you know\nthere's so much in what you said that I\nI just want to it's very it's very\nexciting to talk to you so the first\nthing I'll say is that\num you know we often will identify we we\nas in the you know people but also\nscientists\nidentify biological\num signals um by what we believe them to\nmean psychologically so serotonin is is\na happiness chemical no serotonin\nevolved as a metabolic\nregulator it is a metabolic regulator\nand whatever it's doing it's allowing an\nanimal to\nspend\nresources when the animal the animal's\nbrain isn't sure there's a a reward at\nthe end of that right so you were saying\nbefore you know the absence of fatigue\nthe absence of discomfort that's a\nthat's a pleasant feeling right well\nyeah so maybe serotonin has something to\ndo with pleasantness because it has\nsomething to do with energetics right\ncortisol cortisol is not a stress\nhormone it's not a stress hormone I mean\nit's a hormone that is secreted more\nwhen the brain believes that there is a\nbig metabolic outlay that's\nrequired that's what stress is basically\nit's the brain believes there's a big\nmetabolic outl that's about to be\nrequired and it matters these kind of\nlike little semantic tweaks like they\nmatter a lot because of how we do\nbecause of how we do research so I would\nsay I don't start with the categories\nthat derive from English and my own\nexperience um I start with the nervous\nsystem I try to learn what is the best\navailable evidence for for how that\nnervous system evolved how it developed\nhow it structured right Anatomy to me is\nvery important some of my best\nhypotheses come from just learning the\nanatomy and realizing oh well there's a\nconnection there that's direct that mean\nthat should mean something you know I\nmean um I could give you lots of\nexamples of um uh where we've had we've\nmade discoveries solely because we\nnoticed an an a set of anatomical\nconnections and were're really curious\nabout what they might be involved with\nbut if you start with that premise then\nyou think about the brain in I think\nabout the brain a really different way\nright so I don't think about the brain\nas a stimulus driven\norgan um I think about it more like this\nthat the the brain is\num first of all the brain is not running\na model or or making inferences about\nthe world\nall the brain knows is are signals from\nthe sensory surfaces of its body so your\nbrain is modeling your retina and it's\nmodeling your ca and it's modeling the\nsensory surfaces of the\nskin and sure signals you know are you\nknow hit those surfaces and those\nsurfaces transduce those signals and\nsend them up to the\nbrain but the brain only knows the body\nand anything it knows about the world it\nknows about the world through the body\nthrough the sensory surfaces of the body\nso that's the first for me really big\nimportant point the second important\npoint is that I think about the brain as\nbeing trapped in a dark silent\nbox called your skull you know and it's\nso weird saying these things to you\nyou're so much you know you're like\nyou're this really esteemed like\nneuroscientist in here I am explaining\nto you how I think the brain works it's\njust very you know what's important for\nour audience but it's also important for\nme even though yes I know I know these\nfacts but it's I believe it's always uh\ninformative to go back to the\nfundamentals because we forget you know\nactually I would say that the uh someone\nonce described um the I'll call him the\ngreat because he's a great visual\nneuroscientist uh visual neuroscientist\nTony maavin who founded the department\nof of neuroscience at NYU once said you\nknow a real intellectual is somebody\nthat can appreciate and work with a\ntopic at multiple levels\nit's not and oftentimes the more experti\nis associated with more focus on detail\nso I love returning to the core Basics\nso I I think it's wonderful please\nplease continue so I think about the\nbrains being trapped in this box and um\nit's receiving signals continuously from\nthe sensory surfaces of the body but\nthose signals are the outcomes of some\nset of changes and the brain doesn't\nknow what the changes are it doesn't\nknow the causes of those signals it just\nknows the outcomes it knows the signals\nthat's what it's receiving\nand so it has to guess at what the\ncauses of those signals are in order to\nstay\nalive\num and so that's in philosophy called an\ninverse problem so the brain just has a\nmassive continuous inverse problem that\nit has to deal with all the time like it\ncan't have it doesn't have access to all\nthe information no it's just a guessing\nmachine it's a guessing machine so for\nexample um you know if you hear a loud\nbang what is that loud bang could be a\ncar door slamming it could be thunder it\ncould be a car backfiring it could be a\ngunshot the brain doesn't know it has to\nguess and it's not making a guess like\nuh intellectual guess the Guess is a\nmotor plan it's a plan for changing the\ninternal state of the body in order to\nsupport motor skeletal motor movements\ndo I do I need to run do I need to shut\nthe window do I need to get an umbrella\ndo I you know do I need to hold my\nbreath because the car is backfired you\nknow what do I need to do so where does\nthat plan come\nfrom well it comes from past experience\nthe experience that's been wired into\nthe\nbrain um what the I think that the\nevidence suggests that what the brain is\ndoing is\nbasically reinstating\nbits and pieces of past experience so\nremembering although we don't experience\nourselves as remembering but basically\nit's reimplementing ensembles of\nsignals from the past that are similar\nto the present in some\nway now a bunch of things which are\nsimilar to each\nother in Psychology is a\ncategory so what the brain is doing is\nit's creating a it's constructing a\ncategory and in fact we think about the\nbrain as a continuous category\nConstructor it's constructing a category\nof possible Futures possible outcomes\npossible motor\nplans\nand how does it know which is the right\none because it's not just picking one\nthere's going to be some sample that\nit's re it's re-implementing but how\ndoes it know which one which is the\nright one because there can only be one\nwell I feel like in the example of a\nloud noise\nwhat I immediately thought of as you\nwere describing that is that my system\nwould become aware of it I would become\naware of it but then it's a question of\nis there another loud noise how closely\nare those loud noises spaced is it\ngetting louder or less loud and then and\nso a bunch of categories it it's like a\nbookshelf with an infinite number of\nbooks but then with the second loud\nnoise now it's just you know one uh wing\nof the library and then with the the\nnext thing that happens and the context\nit starts narrowing and then pretty soon\nyou get presented with the book that\nsays you know the roof is about to cave\nin sure and and I think your your PO\nyour your analogy there is pointing out\ntwo things one is that um really why why\nthe what the brain is attempting to do\nis to reduce\nuncertainty because uncertainty is super\nexpensive now sometimes we like\ndeliberately you know cultivate\nuncertainty right like we do not you\nknow we deliberately try to learn things\nwe don't you know that we don't know we\nwe you know put ourselves novel\nsituations you know we seek novelty and\nbecause it's fun and interesting and\nwhatever sure but imagine every single\nwaking moment of your life was like that\nwhere you didn't know you couldn't\nnarrow things down from the library to\nthe wing to the Bookshelf to the you\nknow the to the the particular shelf on\nthat bookshelf to yeah you terrifying\nyeah it would be that's the label I\nwould give it it would be terrifying cuz\nI couldn't plan anything or do anything\nbecause all possibility are open right\nit's and it's just actually\nmetabolically\nunsustainable and you know there are\nsome there are some brains that are\nwired in a way that they don't predict\nvery well they don't create these\ncategories very well and so they're\nthey're dealing\nwith in really unbelievable amounts of\nuncertainty so that's one thing I is but\nthat part of what's the goal here if you\ncould say there's a goal is to reduce\nuncertainty and I'm going to get why\nthis has anything to do with emotion in\na minute but I I just need to set up the\nground rules or the assumptions uh you\nknow of what I'm what I'm working with\nhere so the other thing though that you\npointed out which I think is really\nimportant is that the um none of this is\nstatic it's all evolving over time right\nthe signals are evolving over time so\nboth the signals that are constantly\nhitting the sensory surfaces of the body\nand making their way to the brain but\nalso the intrinsic signals in the brain\nit's all changing over time so when we\ntalk about context that's important how\nis the brain making a decision about\nsimilarity like what are the features\nthat are similar it's it's not just at a\nsingle snapshot in time it's always\nhappening dynamically over time right\nand most of the time\nthough you don't ask your you don't wait\nto hear a second sound you don't you're\nnot deliberately attempting to figure\nout what the sound is your brain is just\nsorting it out right and it's sorting It\nOut by narrowing down the possibilities\nand there are some selection mechanisms\nin the brain that help it guess better\nbut also the signals coming from the\nworld um are are also helping to select\nwhich\npossibility um is the right one I'd like\nto take a quick break and acknowledge\nour sponsor inside track

that are about to hit the ground on\nD-Day are flinching with every crack of\ngunfire like they're just everything's a\nstimulus to move and to end and then\nsome of the more\nseasoned soldiers are literally having\nbullets whizzing by their head and\npeople are dropping Dead all around them\nand they're moving forward steeli and\nstable and upright and in part we look\nat that and and say okay they're\ncourageous they're seasoned maybe\nthey're desensitized in certain ways but\nactually it fits much better with the\nidea based on what you're saying it fits\nmuch better with the idea that um they\nhave intimate knowledge both conscious\nand unconscious knowledge that something\nright next to them is a threat but not a\nthreat worth responding to right exactly\nbut if it were headed straight for them\nthey would quite quite understand what I\nwould say it's is that it's um it's not\nuh you know I keep referring to things\nas signals and really I'm just I'm\nthat's like my generic word for a\nquantity of energy of some sort you know\nbut your brain my brain every brain is\nconstantly making signal noise distinct\nyou know like distinctions do I need to\ncare about this do I do I not need to\ncare about this right and we have ways\nof learning and we also have ways of\nqueuing each other so um you know humans\nuse eye gaze to cue each other about\nwhat is signal and what is noise right\nso if you and I were sitting or let's\nsay we were at a coffee shop and we were\nin a part of town that i' had never been\nto before and we were sitting having\ncoffee and you know a loud siren went by\nif you turned and looked i' would\nprobably turn and look because you just\ncued me that that was something I need\nto care about if you ignored it I'd\nprobably ignore it because you just cued\nme that I I didn't need to worry about\nit I didn't need to care and we're\nconstantly doing that with each other\nand we also do it with little babies and\nwith kids and that's how we teach\nchildren this is signal this is noise\nthis you need to worry about this you\ncan ignore and so yeah your your\ndescription is perfect so what does this\nhave to do any of this have to do with\nemotion in order to answer that part of\nthe question I I I want to\nsay so okay you've got these signals the\nbrain is like has these electrical\nsignals going on we'll just ignore the\nhormonal signals for the moment because\nthat's complic you know one is\ncomplicated so it's got all these\nelectrical signals going on it's when\nit's remembering something it's just\nbasically reinstating a pattern of\nsignals and it's got these signals\ncoming in um from the sensory servfaces\nokay so what's so what is the brain\ndoing it's a signal processor so what is\nit I don't mean a computer I mean a\nsignal processor in the engineering\nsense so what's it what is it doing\nwithout getting into all the Dynamics\nof prediction and you know whatever what\nthe brain is doing is it's um it's\nassembling a set of\nfeatures it's some of the features that\nit's assembling are very close in detail\nto the sensory surfaces of the body so\nin primary visual cortex there's a\nretinotopic map the details there are\nvery very low level like a line an edge\nyou know same thing in primary auditory\ncortex right it's tonotopic so there are\ntones\nbut it's very very very lowlevel details\nand we might there are many many many\nmany of these little features so we\nwould say there there's a it's a high\ndimensional array lots and lots and lots\nand lots of features and then and let's\njust talk about one structure just the\ncerebral cortex let's not worry about\njust but what I'm about to say is\nbasically true of really the rest of the\nbrain as well if you take the cortex off\nthe surface uh the cortical sheet off\nthe that wavy you know cortical sheet\nyou take it off the rest of the brain\nthe subcortical parts and you stretch it\nout like a napkin you can see there's a\ncompression gradient there in the\narchitecture of the neurons so at the\nprimary sensory areas there are these\ntiny little paramal neurons that are\nrepresenting these little these very\nlow-level features and they feed into\nbigger neurons which feed into bigger\nneurons which feed into more bigger\nneurons so what's happening is you've\ngot this very detailed array\nbeing compressed in its dimensionality\nuntil you get to the middle of the brain\nat the front where there are many fewer\nneurons but they're bigger and they have\nmany more connections so it's a\ndimensionality reduction that's\nhappening so just to make sure I\nunderstand um correctly and that the\naudience understands the physical world\nobviously is um transformed by our\nsensory apparati the retina the ca the\nthe sensing neurons in our skin\numal things mechan pressure phon sound\nwaves okay that's translated into neural\ncode which is chemical and electrical\nyeah and and those sensory inputs are\nare fairly vast and you call high\ndimension high dimensionality so lots of\ndifferent orientations of lines lot even\nyou know even though it originates with\njust three uh cone photop pigments lots\nof opportunity for encoding different\nshades of color contrast okay and all of\nthat so you have lots of little neurons\nto represent all the possibilities of\nthe physical world that are occurring MH\nbut as that information is passed\nfurther up along EXC I have to be\ncareful with the use of hierarchies\nbecause that's controversial nowadays\nnot for political reasons but for\naccuracy reasons um as that information\nis passed along there's more um\nconvergence onto a smaller number of\nlarger neurons so these are neurons that\nhave access to a lot of information but\nin coarser form right so there are low\nyou know it's like like compressing an\nMP3 like how an MP3 compresses\ninformation for example so the cortex is\nrepresenting\nfeatures so and I represent I'm just\nusing that in a generic way because\nthat's also controversial about exactly\nhow is the okay but yeah but it works\nbut for now I'm using it just in a\ngeneric way so you go from lines and\nedges to a shape like a round shape to a\nface to a right so you're you're\nbasically you're you're um you're going\nwhat's happening is there are\nsummaries of summaries of summaries of\nsummies I love that I hope everyone\nhears that because I've been in this\nfield of Neuroscience a long time as you\nmove along the neur axis from the\nsensory epithelium now it sounds very\nvery Gomen clish but from the surface of\nthe skin inward you're getting summaries\nyeah they send more and more summaries I\nthink that's so important I that's a\nthat's a like a gazillion dollar\nstatement for understanding of the\nnervous system so but each of those\npoints correspond to some mental feature\nlike a line or an edge or a circle or a\nsquare or a face or right but but now\nthen you when you when you're in the\nmidline at the front what are those\nfeatures well those features are things\nlike they are they are multimodal\nsummaries meaning they are summaries of\nthe sights and sounds and smells and\nright but they and they are lower\ndimensional meaning they are they're\ncoarser so there are things like threat\nreward\npleasure I mean really abstract that's\nwhat abstract means it doesn't mean that\nthose representations have no sensory or\nmotor meaning it means that threat for\nexample a\nsummary can have many different patterns\nassociated with it and the brain is\ntreating them all as equivalent this\nthis to me again feels so so important\nfor people to understand because um as\nI'm hearing this and this word summaries\nis just ringing in my mind it's so\nimportant because one of the core\ncomponents of my experience of my\nemotions because that's all I can really\nsay for sure my\nsubjective interpretation and labeling\nof my own emotions is that they are\npretty broad bins like I described ear\npretty broad bins and so that that's\nwhere I was exactly where I was going\nso what about the word anger where is\nthat represented like well that's a\nthat's a one of these multimodal\nabstractions in fact anger is just a\ncouple of phones it's a couple of sounds\nbut those sounds the sound of anger\ncorresponds over thousands of instances\nthat you've learned in your life to very\ndifferent patterns of sensory motor\nfeatures that's right because what's\ngoing on in your\nbody during anger can vary what the way\nyou move your face in Anger can vary\ndepending on the situation what you see\nsomeone else doing in Anger can vary and\nso the word anger or any word is\nactually just a multi Al summary of many\nmany many many instances which are in\ntheir sensory and motor features the\nsensory and motor meaning very different\nand and it seems to me are highly\nconstrained by Developmental and\ncultural experience absolutely because\njust today I learned that there's a word\nin Japan for the feeling that one has of\nhaving gotten a haircut they don't like\nthere's a word in Germany\nthat pertains to the feeling of wanting\nto punch someone specifically because of\nthe look on their face well really it's\nmore like you like you they to you it\nfeels like they're asking to be punched\nin the face even so you added yet more\ndimensionality to it so upon learning\njust those things just today there is\nadditional dimensionality brought in\nsuch that if I were to ever um want to\npunch somebody in the face simply\nbecause of the look on their\nface that I wouldn't NE necessarily\nlabel that as anger alone it now has\nanother dimension to it and so I I think\nI'm finally I think I'm finally starting\nto understand how the Developmental and\nthe cultural influences plus the fact\nthat language is a pretty crude\ndescriptor for this neural process that\nyou're describing oh absolutely\nabsolutely but okay so but but before\nyou use the word granularity and so I'm\ngoing to use that word too in fact I've\nyou I've coined that phrase emotional\ngranularity\num just as an aside you know I coined\nthat phrase almost 30 years ago and now\npeople study it like it's a phenomenon\nwhich is cool in a sense but also I kind\nof want to keep reminding them like\nthat's a word that refers to a process\nit's not a thing it's a process and the\nbut the process\nis so when the brain is a category\nConstructor\nhow fine grained are the categories how\nsize of the categories right like if\nyou're using if your feature of\nequivalence that your brain is using is\nthreat you're in really big trouble\nbecause there are like a gazillion\ndifferent sensory motor patterns that\ncould go with threat so your category is\ngoing to be massive so how does the\nbrain figure out which of those massive\nnumber of options is the one to use in\nthis in in this instance if on the the\nother hand you don't just want to use\nsensory motor patterns as the features\nof equivalence or the features that\nyou're using to say this instance right\nnow is similar to these past instances\nif I had to search like right now what\nis similar to right now it would be me\nsitting across the table from somebody\nwho has a beard and is um dressed in\nblack and you know there there are a lot\nof details there that probably don't\nmatter right so you you'd be searching\nfor a specific match from the past\nthat's not very efficient either so you\nneed something in the\nmiddle and that that is to say you need\nto have C your brain has to be able to\nmake categories that are more fine\ngrained but not super fine grained but\nthey have to be more fine grained than\njust threat yeah you want to keep the in\nthe library analogy that I made earlier\nyou want to keep the rest of the library\naccessible at some level yeah so you're\nnot just staring at that one book but if\nyou use the\ncategory bad this feels bad\nthen your brain is\nbasically um going to\nbe partially constructing an entire Wing\nfull of books like a entire Wing full of\noptions if you use the word\nangry um then maybe it's a bookcase it's\nconstructing a bookcase full of options\nand a category that's the size of a\nbookcase and if you were using the word\nfrustrated then maybe it's a shelf the\nbrain can learn to construct categories\nat different scales of gen\ngeneralizability so if I'm in an\ninstance and um my brain is making a\nguess is it drawing from past instances\nthat were associated with the word\nanger uh were associated with the word\nfear maybe it's some combination it's\nthe words are just features they're just\nsounds there are also all sorts of other\nfeatures like what was my heart doing\nwhat what what kind of motor actions did\nI make what did I see next so the point\nbeing what I'm trying to bring here is\nthat it's not like your brain creates an\nemotional state and then labels it what\nyour brain is doing is creating a\ncategory of possible futures of what's\ngoing to H what it's going to do next\nand that state is largely determined by\nthe what the brain is remembering and\nit's drawing from that huge population\nthat huge library of options which books\nis it sampling I love this so much\nbecause it explains so much that frankly\nhas been perplexing to me and also\nsomewhat troubling to me like for\ninstance I um we hear about emotional\nintelligence you know and and sometimes\nI wonder whether or not um true\nemotional intelligence would be what you\njust described the understanding of how\nthis process works so that you can work\nwith it and I definitely want to talk\nabout how one can work with this\nknowledge because I think it's\nincredibly powerful in its um\nexplanatory power but also um it's\nactionable power um the other thing is\nthat it's clear to me just based on my\nexperience today of hearing these words\nfrom other cultures that relate to\ndifferent emotional states that this\nsystem unlike a lot of systems in the\nbrain I like to think is fairly plastic\nyeah like the moment that you know that\nthere are additional Dimensions to\nsadness Etc there's something comforting\nabout that what's really unsettling is\nthe idea that we have such broad bends\nthat we are we would Define you know a\nnear infinite number of situations as\njust fear that would suck that's not a\ngood existence and yet I have to ask\nwhether or not you think that as a\nspecies not as a culture but our entire\nspecies whether or not we are taking the\nexact opposite approach that we're sort\nof moving into the Emoji\nisation is that a word I'll make it a\nword and people can assault me in the\ncomments um the\nemojiz of this very rich and complex\nsystem we're starting to get into this\nmode of like I'm going to post an angry\nface and therefore like this is a bad\nI'm angry at you this is a bad\ninteraction we're going to it's it's um\ncombat potentially combative or and you\nknow maybe um Twitter X or Instagram or\nother social media sites are kind of the\nthe epitome of this where you reduce\nthis High dimensional space in you you\nkeep the the sensory stimulation very\nhigh it's movie after movie after movie\nand color and sound and people doing\ncrazy parkour stuff and bears eating\ngiraffes or whatever it is probably not\nbears eating giraffes but you know what\nI mean and you can see stuff that's\nsexual and violent and political and\nemotional and sweet and then the cats\nare kissing the monkey and you're like\nor the monkey's kissing the cat and so\nit's high dimensionality in terms of\nsensory space but then what do we call\nit we're like oh this is an emoji you\nass sign an emoji you're heting\nsomething you're giving a thumbs up or a\nthumbs down so I almost feel like we\nwe're trying to uh we we're regressing\nto a state where we're kind of like an\ninfant trying to figure out like what\nthe hell is going on and we're saying\nyou know what you get like six\ncategories of response when in reality\num we should probably be expanding the\nnumber of different responses that we\ncan have in order to accurately match\nthe way that our nervous system actually\nworks yes exactly there are many\ndifferent things we could talk about\nwith respect to the summary that you\njust gave which I I think is completely\naccurate so what I would say is that if\nyou look through even just the last I\ndon't know hundred or so years like the\n19th you know 19th 20th centuries maybe\nyou can see that the complexity of the\nof people's\nresponses expands and contracts right so\nfor example this is something that I've\nwritten really speculatively about\num but one of the things that I found\nreally interesting um is that you know\nauthoritarianism authoritarian thinking\nis the reduction of complexity to some\nthings that are really really simple\nlike you're getting rid of all the\ncomplexity to you know basically these\nvery very coarse low dimensional\njudgments and Things become black and\nwhite um it's the avoid of\ncomplexity um so that there can be\nsimple single answers to things and it\nhappens in human culture at times and\nthen then there's an expansion of\ncomplexity at times too so what predicts\nthat like what is it in the human\nnervous system or our Collective human\nnervous you know like we're we're just a\nbunch of brains attached to bodies\ninteracting with other brains and bodies\nright so like what is it that causes\nthese um ripples of and and I have some\nthoughts about that that are really\nreally really\nspeculative um but I think the other\nthing that's that's really important is\nthat we've talked about we'll go back to\nour our cortical sheet that we've and by\nthe way this is just one compression\ngradient in the brain there are others\ntoo right um there are at least four\nothers that I can think of um so this is\njust one but all compression gradients\nwork the same way which is that now\nwe've talked about going from the\nlow-level details um compressing to\nthese multimodal summaries these really\nlike simple um features that are right\nbut that\ncompression is what Engineers would call\nlossy meaning you lose the\ninformation you lose the\ninformation so when you go from lines\nand edges to a face those neurons they\njust know the face they don't have they\nlose what they've thrown away the\ndetails they've thrown away those\ndetails are gone for those neurons that\nare representing a face they don't have\naccess to that they don't have access to\nit you know so we said well the brain is\nmaking a guess it's making a guess about\nwhat these what this big very very\nhigh-dimensional you know soup of\nsignals in the world and in the body\nlike what do they mean\nright when the brain makes a guess it\nstarts with the compressed low\ndimensional sign it starts with the\nfeatures like anger or like threat or it\nstarts with these summaries and then it\nhas to infer or guess at every synapse\nthere's a guess that's being made about\nwhat the details are at the next level\nbecause what's happening is the guess is\nbasically the brain going from these\nreally General things to these very\nspecific sensory motor patterns it\nhappens along the cortical sheet it\nhappens also down the Nur axis down the\nner you know from the cortex to the\nmidbrain to the brain stem to the spinal\ncord you have to go from a\nrepresentation of you know run to the\nactual physical movements of muscles\nspindles and you know angles of joints\nand things like that so what you're\ndoing is you're going in the other\ndirection you're adding detail you're\nparticularizing and the brain is\nguessing it's guessing well if it's\nusing anger as the general feature well\nwhich which instance of anger is it and\nwhat are the specifics that are going to\nhappen and and what are the WT and\nforgive me but and what are the Adaptive\nsteps that I might take or not take\nbecause um I'm quoting a lot today so\nforgive me but in the words of the great\nsharington Nobel prize winning\nphysiologist the final common pathway is\nmovement is movement and that's and and\nmovement is nuanced right humans I I\nsuppose have among the greatest variety\nof different speeds and types of\nmovement I think about parkour or\ngymnastics think about then what like a\na cheetah can do cheetah are impressive\na gymnist is truly impressive in terms\nof the range of movements and speeds Etc\nin any event the ultimate choice of the\nnervous system has to make is whether or\nnot to\nmove which direction how fast or stay\nstill move move back and and I just I'll\njust add because I'm I'm hoping that\nyou'll expand on this um it's been said\nbefore that ultimately the nervous\nsystem is trying to make decisions about\nyum yuck or me like like am I going to\nmove towards something am I going to\nmove away from it or am I just going to\nstay put well that's only that's only at\nthe that that's a very I would say that\nthose are very low dimensional features\nthose are those compressed features but\nthat's not the only thing the brain has\nto decide that's just a misnomer well\ngood that I can get out of this little\npickle that I just put myself in by\nsaying that I didn't say that now I\nwon't quote who did because he's a very\nfamous neuroscientist but he tried to\nreduce it all he's at Caltech it um he's\nnot somebody who studies emotion he\nstudies the visual system but he said\nthat you know that that there's a that\nthe the neural circuits maybe it's\nbecause he studies mice are are\nessentially bended into um yum yuck and\nmeh outputs and and i' I've always liked\nit on the one hand cuz threes work and\nit's simple but rarely is the way that\nwe describe things the way it actually\nworks so we would you know in in\nstudying humans we would say well that's\naffect affect that's mood or you know\nit's just like is it is it um should I\nmove towards it is it Pleasant should I\nmove away from it is it unpleasant or\nyou know is it irrelevant basically I\ndon't care okay think about when you're\nfeeling horrible you just feel you feel\nyou just feel you feel bad what do you\ndo you don't know what you don't know\nbecause you don't have a plan of action\nand that's ultimately that is what those\nthose compressed like summary features\nthose very low coarse features they have\nto be decompressed into details\notherwise you don't know what to do so\nultimately what the brain is doing is\nit's sampling from the\npast based\non similarity to the present to plan an\naction and when I say action I don't\njust mean skeletal motor action like\nmoving a limb it you the first actions\nthat are planned are the actions of\ncoordinating the heart and the lungs and\nyou know all of the internal actions\nthat are required to support the motor\nthe skeletal motor movements so your\nbrain is making uh is categorizing and\nit's making a it's it's creating a\ncategory and it's there are options\nthere those options the motor plans\nbegin with should the heart beat faster\nshould it beat slower does blood\npressure need to go up should the you\nknow should the blood vessels constrict\nor should they dilate um should the\nbreathing be deeper or more shallow I\nmean those are the first plans that get\nmade and then milliseconds later there\nare the skeletal motor plans and then\nyour experience of the world derives\nfrom those motor plants those viscero\nmotor that is the plans for the viscera\nfor the internal organs and the skeletal\nmotor so I'm just going to refer to them\nas motor those motor plans actually give\nrise to your experience of the world\nthere's not some state that exists as an\nemotional state which then you apply a\nlabel to the\nlabel is a just a set of\nfeatures that are useful for\ngeneralizing from the past to the\npresent and the bin size or the the you\nknow of of what a word refers to can\nchange it can change it's different for\ndifferent people and it can change in\nyour lifetime and you can add new Bins\nthat is you can so for example there's a\nthere's a concept gusin look which I\nprobably just butchered so if you speak\nTurkish I'm sorry but it's like um it\nhas features of it of like loss and um\nlike people blocking your goals so we\nwould say it's anger and sadness\ntogether that's gusin look when you lose\nsomething and you're pissed off about it\num that's a but that's a category on its\nown right it's just a different way of\nparsing that that that really detailed\nsoup and the more words you know the\nmore words are just useful\nfor pointing to a set of features that\nare similar to each other so what I mean\nby that is if I say to you Andrew I had\npizza last night for dinner pizza two\nsounds two\nsyllables that those two syllables s\nthey stand in for like 50 different\nsensory and motor\nfeatures because I don't have to say to\nyou I had a food I didn't have pizza L\nthing but let's say I did I had a food\nthat was round and flat and had sauce\nand also cheese and it it had mozzarella\ncheese and also a little parmesan cheese\nand it had mushrooms on it and a little\nbit of uh Olive and you know um that's\nlike really really uh detailed and\ncomplicated but instead I can just say I\nhad pizza two features two sounds two\nsyllables\nphones and with those two\nphones I have just communicated to you\nin your brain my brain had 50 features\nit was representing of details and now I\nhave just communicated those to you or\nsome number of them with two sounds very\nefficient now of course you might think\nthat I was from Chicago and had deep\ndish pizza and I'll just resist I don't\nI don't want to like offend anybody from\nChicago it's not pizza that's not real\npizza that's not real Pizza um right so\nyou could then ask me uh was it but\nyou're from Chicago is that deep dish\npizza and then I would say no no I'm\nactually from Toronto which is just like\nNew York and so no it was thin crust\npizza which is really the only kind of\npizza there is just saying but you know\nbut my point is that words are just\nstand in for they're just low these low\ndimensional features these these s of\ngross features that stand in for many\nmany many many little detailed features\nand that's how we communicate with each\nother and and we are constrained by you\nknow what we know and our yes so and\nwhat we can say and the extent of our\nvocabulary and I'll just say that little\nbabies three months old they don't speak\nyet and they don't understand language\nbut they can use words to learn abstract\ncategories so abstract just means that\nthe the word refers to many different\npatterns of sensory motor features so\nthe word is um or the category the\nthings that make the instances similar\num are a function um or goal not like\nthe sensory motor features so you say to\na\nbaby very explicitly like because if\nwe're talking about three four-month-old\nbabies right babies can also do this\nimplicitly too um but in experim exp you\nsay to a baby look\nsweetie this is a bling and you put the\nbling down and it makes a beeping noise\nand then you say now this looks\ndifferent feels different right smells\ndifferent look sweetie this is a\nbling it\nbeeps now you take something\nelse which also is different and you say\nlook sweet this is a\nbling now the baby expects this to beep\nby the way folks just listening Lisa\njust gave three examples first with a\npen then a coffee mug and then her very\nown watch uh three very distinct objects\nbut all of which make uh that are told\nuh the baby is told make uh a bling\nsound and they will bend those three\nyeah visual distinct objects\nfunctionally distinct objects into one\nsingle bin because they make a because\nthey are sharing a function which is to\nbeep I think this is so so important and\nI um and if I may I I I want to ask\nwhether or not we can take this\nincredible understanding of emotions\nbecause that's really what we're talking\nabout well we're really talking about\nhow the brain my my version of how the\nbrain works and how emotions emerge out\nof this system basically and and\nabsolutely um you described it far\nbetter than I could and and and anchor\nthat to this concept of movement like\nthe movement is the final common path\nwith the understanding that the movement\nsystem and forgive me but that we have\nsystems in the brain and body that allow\nus to move that's for sure systems\nplural that they run in both directions\nin other words how we feel what we\nfeel our emotions has some bearing on\nthe movements that are more or less\nlikely for us in a given context and our\nmovements clearly can also influence the\nway that we feel internally well it's\nwell I mean so if um if we just look at\nhow things are happening here's here's\nwhat the anatomy tells us that when the\nbrain makes a guess that guess starts as\na motor plan starts as a visceral motor\nplan and a skeletal motor plan so heart\nrate changes breathing changes blood\npressure changes and potentially\nskeletal muscle movement right and\nliteral copy\nliteral copies efferent copies of those\nsignals are sent to they propagate to\nthe sensory areas telling the brain\ntelling those neurons this is the last\ntime we made this in this context when\nthis other stuff just happened the like\nthis temporal context right the and we\nmade these movements here is what we saw\nnext here is what we felt next here's\nwhat we smelled next so yeah I think of\nthis so the image that Pops in my mind\nand we should explain to people what\nefference copy is um in neuroscience and\nneuro Anatomy uh the connection to a\nstructure is called an aarant with an A\nand the connections out from a structure\nare called the eer but the way I was say\nit doesn't even matter it's just\nbasically the point here is that in our\nexperience in our in the way the brain\nyour brain conjures an experience okay\nand and that experience is that you feel\nsomething first you see something you\nfeel something you act that's not what's\nhappening what's happening is your brain\nis preparing the action first and the\nfeeling what and your experience comes\nfrom that action preparation so it's a\ncopy it's like literally you have axons\nthat are sending motor signals down the\nthe you know brain stem to the spinal\ncord and literal copies of those axons\nlike those axons have branches that\ncollateral branches that just send axons\nother places the same signal that is\nbeing sent to your spinal cord to move\nstuff in your body that same signal is\nbeing sent to other neurons in the brain\nas predictions of the sensations that\nare going to happen in a second from now\na moment from now probably faster than a\nsecond but you know in a couple\nmilliseconds if you move and so yes it\nis the case that what you feel is linked\nto what you do and what you do is linked\nto what you feel but not in this simple\nmechanistic way that that\nneuroscientists and psychologists have\nbeen using\nforever you it's not like you are you\nare you you're probed by a stimulus you\nyou see something you hear something and\nthen you process it and evaluate it and\nthen you react to it no that's not\nwhat's happening what's actually\nhappening under the hood is that based\non how things are right now your brain\nmakes a guess or some guesses and those\nguesses start as motor\nplans and the consequence of those motor\nplans are predicted Sensations and then\nof course sensory signals are coming\nfrom the sensory surfaces and they s and\nhere's the really here's to me the\nreally the most mind-boggling thing\nabout this whole\nexplanation if your Sensory neurons in\nyour sensory areas are already so\nthey're firing the the the the action\npotentials the spiking has changed based\non these prepared motor movements these\nare sensory\npredictions and you know when I give\ntalks and on my website I have some cool\nexamples of of how this works you can\nexperience it yourself you you know\nstart to experience uh you know you hear\nthings that aren't there you you feel\nvibrations in your chest that aren't\nthere because your brain is predicting\nit's predicting these\nSensations so let's say the sensations\ncome the the sensory signals I should\nsay let me so the sensory signals from\nthe sensory surfaces of the body make it\nto the\nbrain if you have if your neurons are\nalready firing in a way to anticipate\nthose signals those signals just confirm\nthe firing and then they're done they\ndon't make it any further into the\nbrain so when you're predicting\nwell your experience is constructed\ncompletely by your brain the signals\nfrom the sensory surfaces are there just\nto confirm irm\nor to change the signals so if there's\nthings you didn't\nanticipate then those um errors of\nprediction those are the signals that\nare propagated and become compressed and\nstuff and we have a special name for\nthat in science we call it learning you\nknow Andy Clark is a philosopher who\nwrites a lot about prediction predicting\nbrain and and so on and he talks about\nnormal uh everyday experience as being a\ncontrolled\nhallucination I think that's true yeah I\nsubscribe to that um it's a fairly\nadaptive in most circumstances\ncontrolled hallucination but but it has\nits limitations and it I mean what we\nwere talking about um if I could be a\nsomewhat of a summary neuron you can\ntell me if my summary is too coarse um\nis that first of all that the neural\nsystems and the Brain let's just call it\nthe nervous system because we're talking\nabout brain and body are incredibly\nDynamic there's a bunch of inputs those\ninputs gets are incredibly elaborate\nthey get summarized the summary prepares\nthe body for a certain action that's a\nmotor commands preo commands and then\nsome action may or may not be taken but\nalready as soon as an action is taken or\nnot taken the whole state of the neural\nsystem is different it's changed as a\nconsequence of just of what just\nhappened now of course when people hear\nthat and when I hear that indeed I I\nfeel like wow it's a tough system to\nstudy because these are dynamical neural\nsystems and and we have the technology\nto put people in functional scanners and\nlook at what lights up so to speak we\nhave the capacity to ask people how they\nfeel based on questionnaires but you can\nimagine that's incredibly crude so then\nyou give them liyer scales of you know\nrate from 1 to 10 how happy or sad you\nare and so you're adding some some depth\nand dimensionality to it but it's\nincredibly crude it's nothing like real\nexperience and if somebody's more verbal\nless verbal maybe they somaticize more\nor less I mean an example comes to mind\nthat you know occasionally you learn\nfrom social media which often I learn\nfrom social media and someone once said\nI don't think in thoughts I think in\nfeels and I thought okay great you're\nprobably also from Northern California\nand I said wait Andrew stop being so\njudgmental what do you mean and I asked\nand they said I experience emotions in\ntheir mind first as a as a bodily State\nthen the label comes much later that's\nnot how it works for me it feels fairly\nmore integrated brain and body for me\nbut other people started chiming in no I\nthink of emotion I experience emotions\nclearly as a verbal label it's all in\ntheir head and so you start to realize\nthat we might all be encoding The World\nSlightly differently or very differently\nand it's changing in time so then the\nquestion becomes you know how what are\nthe anchor points in terms of our\nunderstanding of emotions that we can\nwork with and and and the following\nquestions come to mind um neither you\nnor I are clinicians as far as I know\nI'm certainly not I was actually trained\nas a clinician oh there you go I'm wrong\nagain but I haven't no no no but I mean\nI haven't I haven't practiced in like\nreally gazillions of years okay well\nyou're you're well you're more than\nqualified to answer the question I'm\nabout to ask which is to me there is a\ngreat conflict of information in the\npsychology Psychiatry and let's just\ncall it wellness and mental health space\nwhich is when we are feeling lousy like\nnot good let's put veilance on it just\nlousy I don't want in a state that we\nwe're having an emotion that we don't\nwant to\nhave there's an entire category of\ninformation that says you need to feel\nyour feelings you need to feel your\nfeelings you need to acknowledge that\nthey're there you need to go into the\nfeeling maybe even full catharsis you\nneed to amplify the feelings until they\nquote unquote leave your body after all\nSteve Job was into scream therapy and\nhelped himun his anger who knows you get\nthese examples he's probably the worst\nexample because it seemed like he was\nangry a lot from what I hear but then\nthere's another category of thought\nwhich is no you need to use your ability\nto top down control inhibition of the\ncortex on Lower structures again I'm\ndeliberately using crude language here\nto say wait you know this is an emotion\nemotions pass this is not real this is\njust a limited set of uh High\ndimensionality stuff that's been\nsummarized and you know what like I\ndon't need to feel this way I can make\nmyself feel differently maybe I'll go\nfor a run in fact I always feel better\nafter I go for a run so even this\nquestion as simple as should we feel our\nour\nfeelings or should we not feel our\nfeelings and of course you would hope\nthat this would be answered\nappropriately such that people don't go\nharm other people or themselves but but\nbut assuming that they're not going to\nharm other people eles verbally or\nphysically then you really get yourself\ninto a bit of a pickle like we don't\nunderstand what to do with\nemotions ours or other people's because\nclearly we don't understand emotions per\nse so I would say I'm going to answer\nyour question and then I want to also\npick it the word the I want to pick it\nan\nassumption um because it it's come up\nactually a couple of times and there's\nsomething super important in your\ndescriptions that I just want to pull\nout for for the listeners because I\nthink it's really important and you're\ndoing it very naturally but I think some\npeople it would be it just Bears\ncommenting on so let me just deal with\nthe question of should we feel our\nfeelings or use our words you know we\nsay to little kids use your words like\ndon't throw a tantrum right um but then\nthere was also this other feeling oh\njust feel it's important to feel and you\ndon't want to get it have it be pent up\nand you or use your body and like and\nlike hit a pillow I mean there's scream\ntherapy bite the pillow SC pill tear the\npillow's you can p $5,000 for a week\nofing this and they'll tell you you're\ngoing to feel better at the end so the\nanswer there is it's the wrong question\nlike flexibility is important for\neverything always right so um first of\nall you don't have you don't have\nemotions in your body your body doesn't\nkeep the score you know yeah great book\ntitle because it's super catchy but with\nall due respect to I think the important\nwork of Vander I think it oversimplified\nand led people to believe that their\nback pain was\ntrauma and that all trauma is somatized\nand it's not no it's not but I I would\ngo further and say like first of all\nyour body does keep the score your brain\nkeeps the score your body is the\nscorecard that's super important and he\nhas done really important work but his\nexplanations for why things work is\nscientific ific Al\nincorrect it just is because we don't\nfeel things in our bodies we everything\nwe feel we feel in our brains we don't\nsee in our eyes we see in our brains of\ncourse we need our eyes but we don't see\nin our eyes just like if you you know\npinch your your hand with you know take\nskin and pinch between you know two two\nfingers the skin you don't feel that\nactually in your hand you feel it in\nyour brain that's the magic of the brain\nin a sense so what I would say is it\num uh it depends on the situation and\nwhat your goal\nis um sometimes it is useful to use your\nwords and sometimes it is useful to go\nfor a\nrun it just depends on what your goal is\nwell in both those cases you're you're\nuh that you gave both those examples\nexcuse me you're um it's a way of\nShifting off the emotion I guess what\nI'm asking is well sometimes you don't\nwant to shift off the emotion sometimes\nthe mo sometimes the wisest thing to do\nis live in the emotion that is you know\nsometimes uh\ndiscomfort sometimes when something\nfeels bad it doesn't mean something is\nwrong it just might mean that you're\ndoing something hard well earlier I\nwrote when you talking about the the\nbroad categorization of emotions I I\nwrote down you know simple as good when\nit feels good you're like I just feel\nreally great but then when things feel\nlousy that's where Nuance could be\nbeneficial yeah AB absolutely because\nwe're because emotions are recipes for\nAction when you go from be feeling bad\nto feeling angery or sad it's a recipe\nfor action and I would also say and this\njust this is an analogy but I I sort of\nI stand by it um you know uh when I was\num I had major back surgery a couple\nyears ago and I know something about\nchronic pain it's not my area of study\nbut I know something about it because\nI've I've and reanalyze some some data\nsets and I've read a lot so I'm not an\nexpert but you know I have ideas and I\nthought to myself well I just I don't\nwant to end up with chronic back pain so\nwhat I did was I made sure after I got\nthrough the first couple of weeks where\nI really needed oxycodone so that I\ncould walk you know I was up and walking\nthe same day I had surgery if you could\ncall it walking it sort of a euphemism\nfor like hobbling around on a with a\nwalker but um I made sure that I felt\nthe\npain that is I dosed myself with\ndiscomfort quite deliberately because I\nwanted to make sure that I'm I'm I'm\nsorry for using you know cartisian\nlanguage I don't know how else to say\nthis I I wanted my brain to be taking in\nthe prediction error I wanted my brain\nto to feel the to to I wanted to focus\nattention on the changing dis you know s\nthe the changing discomfort over time\nbecause it meant that my body was\nhealing as the discomfort got less but\nmy brain would never feel that\ndiscomfort changing if I uh took\npainkillers\nand because the prediction error the\nthings that the brain doesn't predict\nare teaching signals and I think it's\ntrue also in your life like sometimes\nyou want to feel it because you you want\nto feel the discomfort because it's\ninstructive about something and\nsometimes it's not and that's maybe\nthat's not really an answer but the only\nway that you can figure that out for\nyourself is to do it sometimes if you're\nalways getting rid of discomfort you\nnever know when it's useful and it is\nuseful sometimes but now I want to get\nto this point that I was making before\nlike we are talking about feeling and\nemotion interchange like they're\ninterchangeable and they're not right so\nhere's how I would say it your brain is\nalways regulating your body\n247 and your body is always sending\nsensory signals back to the brain about\nthe sensory state of the\nbody and our nervous systems aren't\nwired for us to experience those sensory\nchanges that are happening in the body\nin any degree of\ndetail we're just not and it's a good\nthing like right now as we talk here our\nhearts are beating and our you know pain\npancreas is squishing stuff out you know\nliver is you know filtering and like you\nknow oxygen concentrations are changing\nlike a there's a whole drama going on\ninside each of us and our listeners and\nwe're largely not aware and I hope our\nlisteners aren't aware because if they\nwere they would not be listening to\nanything we were saying they'd be\ncompletely you know in enraptured or or\nin discomfort at what's going on inside\nthem instead the brain creates a\nlow-dimensional summary this gross kind\nof like barometer which is feeling\naffective feeling we call it or you\ncould call it mood but scientists call\nit affect with an A Feeling Pleasant\nfeeling unpleasant feeling worked up\nfeeling calm feeling comfortable feeling\nuncomfortable it's kind of a general\nbarometer of the state of the body and\nit's not emotion that those feelings\nthose features of feeling are features\nof consciousness because your brain is\nalways regulating your body your body's\nalways sending signals back to the brain\nthe brain is always representing them in\nthis low-dimensional way whether you're\npaying attention or not like whether the\nbrain is focusing it's you know applying\nattention to those neurons or not the\nthose signals are\nthere and even when we're not\nemotional you know like if you're\ndriving on the highway and somebody cuts\nyou off and you think what an\nthe assholeness of that person that\nintensity of that negative affect is you\nexperience it as a property of that\nperson but really it's coming from you\nit's it's not a property of that person\nit's that's a feature of your experience\nin that\nmoment and affect is always there\nsometimes it's in the foreground\nsometimes it's in the background but\nit's always there and it's a summary of\nphysical things which is why it helps to\nif you take ibuprofen or Tylenol it will\nredu I mean study show it reduces\nnegative feeling if you go for a run if\nyou go for a walk if you shift your\nattention to the outside\nworld then the features that of\nexperience that are derived from the\ninside World diminish that's why going\nfor a run helps or going for a walk\nhelps or you know getting sleep helps\nright these are all things where you're\nchanging the state of your body and so\nthe sensory state of your body is\nchanging and so your affect changes but\nemotions are the story that the brain\ntells about what caused the sensory\nsignals that affect derives from so what\ncaused those changes what do I need to\ndo about those changes that's that's\nlike it's a it's a much\nbigger event than just these features of\nexperience which are all features of\nConsciousness which are always there\nthey're always there and in in\nfact in our\nculture we we pathologize people when\nthey just experience their bodies as\nphysical Sensations and not as emotions\nlike we say oh that person is Som\nsomatizing or somatizing they're not\nthey should they're really they're they\nshould be experiencing emotion but\nreally they're you know experiencing a\nstomach ache and that's bad but that's\nactually a judgment call that is\nprobably sometimes wrong sometimes it's\nprobably better to experience a stomach\nache sometimes it's more productive part\nof being emotionally intelligent is\nknowing when not to construct an\nemotion you know like uh right before Co\nthe coid pandemic was announced\nofficially I was in New Zealand giving\ntalks and my\ndaughter who was who was in college at\nthat time was\nflying uh literally like\nI think less than a week before the\npandemic was announced she got on a\nplane and she flew to New Zealand to\nmeet me because it was spring break and\nI always would bring her with me on\nspring\nbreak and in that and I remember really\nvividly I was in New Zealand there was\nonly one case one case of coid in New\nZealand at that point and I I got on the\nphone to my husband and I\nsaid I'm experiencing a very high level\nof arousal and it's it's very very\nunpleasant now my husband knows me very\nwell and he said yeah there's a lot of\nuncertainty and I said I know now he\ndidn't say to me well you're anxious and\nyou just don't really know it I because\nI wasn't anxious I was feeling\nuncertain and as you know or maybe\npeople are know that when there's a lot\nof uncertainty there's also a lot of\narousal because the brain is attempting\nto learn and the neurom modulators that\nare important for learning new things\nhappen to also cause uh a subjective\nsense of arousal and some they actually\nalso modulate your autonomic nervous\nsystem so your heart can beat faster and\nwhatever and our go-to explanation for\nwhat that is is to experience that\narousal as anxiety but I was uncertain\nand remember that how your brain the\nstory it's telling itself the category\nit's making is a plan for action well\nwhat do you do in anxiety and fear you\nfreeze or you run away what do you do in\nuncertainty you forage for information\nyou tolerate the discomfort and you\nforage for information which is what I\nwas doing when I called and said what\nshould we do should I meet her at the\nairport and turn around and come back or\nshould we have a vacation like I don't\nreally know um and you know what I ended\nup doing was foraging for information\nfor another couple days and then made a\nSplit Second decision in the air when we\nwere flying from one Island to the other\nand we just re-rooted us and we went\nhome and then the borders closed like\ntwo days later you know but my point is\nthat it this is not just you\nknow\nuh psychological mumbo jumbo you can\ntrain yourself to\nexperience your heart pounding in your\nchest as determination what when my\ndaughter this is all in how emotions are\nmade these examples but they're true I\nmean my daughter this is the this book I\nwrote a couple years ago when my\ndaughter was 12 years old she was\ntesting for a black belt in karate she\nwas 5 feet tall not even and she was\ntesting against these like massively\nlarge adolescent boys okay who were like\na foot taller than her and her Sensei\nwho was a 10th degree black belt didn't\nsay to her don't be afraid\nhe said get your butterflies flying in\nformation and I was like in raptured I\nwas like oh my God this guy is totally\nbrilliant that is the\nbest you know meaning to give to\narousal that changes the meaning of it\nwhat you do when you create an emotion\nis you're giving meaning to those\naffective\nfeelings and you have have more\ncontrol than you might think in how you\ndo that you can do it by changing the\nphysical state that gives rise to those\nfeelings but you can also change it by\nlearning more how to make more\ncategories and how to make them more\nfluidly um so that you do something\ndifferent\nand the it's not that things will\nnecessarily feel any more unpleasant or\nany less or or any more pleasant it's\nthat\nthe feeling becomes a source of wisdom\nit's a cue to do something\ndifferent this is a case uh where I\nabsolutely believe that uh knowledge\nabout how emotions and affect and states\nof the brain and body work which is what\nyou're beautifully describing for people\ntoday is extremely useful in and of\nitself and I think um and I it's a\nfrankly it's a it's a refreshing and\nwelcome departure from a lot of the\nconversations that we normally have on\nthis podcast where you know we talk a\nlot about protocols we talk about tools\nright things that people can do ways\nthey can implement the knowledge and\nhere this is certainly one of those\ncases as well but um it's a beautiful\none and a very um important one\nwhere the knowledge itself just the\nknowledge of additional words for\ndifferent states uh I love the example\nexample of butter putting butterflies\ninto formation because it it inherent to\nthat is that you're not trying to get\nrid of the Butterflies quite the\nopposite yeah um you're deploying them\nin certain ways and there's an action\nstep and a psychological step there of\ncourse that's required but that it isn't\num you know view morning sunlight for an\naverage of 10 minutes to set your\ncircadian rhythm which is something that\nI say over and over again I'll go into\nthe grave saying that they'll probably\nput a window over my grave so sunlight\ncan get in at this point but which would\nbe fine with me but in any case um\nknowledge is power is something that we\nhear but it's not always true often it's\nknowledge is power but you need to do X\nY and Z in a certain order but here what\nyou've provided and you you're\ncontinuing to provide is knowledge that\npeople can use\nthat real estate within their brain I'm\ndeliberately not giving it a name um\nbecause it's it's distributed real\nestate that allows them to take an\nunpleasant feeling and work with it um\nthat it has more dimensionality than we\nprobably\nrealize um that's becoming clear to me\nthat rarely if ever is there less\ndimensionality um you can always give it\nmore dimensionality by just shifting\nyour attention and you can practice this\nreally so you know like there's a story\nthat I tell about when I the brief uh\nmoment when I tried to learn how to\npaint you know and so uh there's an\nobject like a cup and you have this\nthree-dimensional object and you want to\nrender it on a two-dimensional canvas so\nyou could just try to draw the cup and\nthen what you get is a pretty shitty\nlooking you know cup um but what what a\nrealist painter will teach you to do is\nto take the cup and to break it apart\ninto pieces of light and then what you\ntry to paint are the pieces of light so\nyou're transferring your first what\nyou're doing is you're taking this very\nlow dimensional coarse object called a\ncup and you're breaking it into tiny\nlittle pieces of light which is what the\nvisual system does which is what the\nvisual system does and so what you're\ndoing is you're categorizing it\ndifferently in order to emphasize the\nfeatures that are more High dimensional\nthat are in there right they're in there\nin in the brain but you can but what\nyou're doing essentially is you're\nyou're having the brain your brain is\napplying attention to basically um focus\nmore on those details and then you\ntransfer the details on to the\ntwo-dimensional canvas and what you get\nis a pretty decent looking\nthree-dimensional Cup on a\ntwo-dimensional canvas aming un unless\nyou're me and and then it still looks\nshitty uh you know and so maybe I'll\nI'll take it up again sometime uh in the\nfuture but my point is that you can do\nthat with your own sensory condition of\nyour body in Emotion you can\ndeliberately focus on what your heart is\ndoing to the to your the best of your\nability that you can sense it right or\nyou can deliberately Focus on your\nbreathing or you could deliberately\nfocus on what your muscles are how they\nhow tense they feel you can you can\nchange the dimensionality of your\nexperience by the shifting of your\nattention I love it and uh forgive me\nfor giving another example but I think\nit's one that will resonate with both of\nus and hopefully with our listeners as\nwell which is um the great Oliver Sachs\nneurologist and author um talked about\nand wrote about you know he'd work with\nthese patients that were either had\nlocked in syndrome or severe autism or\nsevere tourettes or Parkinson's and you\nknow most people would even clinicians\nwho specialize in those areas would look\nat those people and say that they're\nliving in a diminished world it's it's\nthey lack capacities that other people\nhave and um and it's all about the a the\nabsence of certain abilities and uh and\nthen what he did eventually was\nincredible he loved animals so he would\nspend time thinking about what would be\nlike for instance to be a bat hanging in\nthe corner of a room and experience the\nroom not through vision but mainly\nthrough echolocation and he would spend\na lot of time thinking about that he\nalso did a lot of drugs at one point in\nhis career and then stopped because they\nwere very destructive drugs not just\npsychedelics but also methamphetamine so\nyes he has that but he eventually\nchanged his practice to trying to\nexperience human emotion but first think\nabout animal sensory experience MH and\nand he would do that for lots of\ndifferent types of animals octopus and\nbats and all these different things and\nthen it allowed him in his words it\nallowed him to then interact with\npatients in a way where he could feel\nmaybe even empathize a little bit with\nhow they experienced life and then he\nwould write books about it in a way and\nhere I'm borrowing someone else's words\nthat storied these people into almost\ngreater Larger than Life characters and\nnow of course he wasn't trying to\ndetract from their suffering but he was\ntrying to give people an understanding\nof what that suffering was like through\ntheir actual experience and he did it in\nmy opinion and the opinion of many other\npeople a masterful job in doing and and\nit but it came through much in the same\nway that your art teacher said you know\npay attention to the way the the the\nchanges in light across the the the\nobject as opposed to trying to draw draw\nthe object themselves that when we so\nthe the takeaway here that I I think\nwe're arriving at is that that you've\nprovided is that\nif we take a if we add dimensionality to\nour description of or experience of the\nsensory inputs and there's a ton of it\nto reach to and we maybe even come up\nwith some new internal labels or\nlanguage based labels that we can\nexperience the world in much richer and\nmuch more adaptive ways absolutely and I\nI love I love your stories and I love\nthis story in particular about Oliver\nsax because um it resonates with my\nexperience when I was reading um Ed\nyong's new book oh um first he wrote We\ncontain multitudes which I think one\naiter and then um uh what is the recent\none with animals an immense World an\nimmense world and what I what I was\nthinking was you\nknow it's a first of all it's a\nmasterful masterful masterful book I I\nwish I had written that book I I wrote\nhim a fan letter I was like this is such\nan amazing book it's an amazing book um\nbut because he help helps\nyou\nexperience so what what I want to say is\nthis that there are all these animals\nthat have different sensory surfaces\nthan we do and they can detect signals\nin the world that are that we that are\nnot relevant to us because we don't have\nsensory surfaces for\nthem and it reminds you first of all\nthat what you experience as reality is\nreally not in the world alone and it's\nnot in your head alone it is in the\ntrans action between the two you know\nyour the neurons in your brain in in\nyour nervous system are also part of the\nreality and so reality is the\ntransaction reality are the are the\nfeatures that are the transaction\nbetween signals in the world and signals\nin your brain\nand the parts of the world that some\nother animals experience that we will\nnever experience they're not really part\nof our reality because they don't\ninteract with any of the anything that\nwe have but for those animals it's part\nof their Niche it's part of their you\nknow Niche is just the word for the\nparts of the world that matter to you\nbasically and I was thinking that if\npeople read this book and you know maybe\nit will help them have empathy for other\npeople who don't have Minds like theirs\nand who don't experience the world in\nthe way that they do your description of\nwhat what um Oliver sax his what his um\nhis actions were and his schools it did\noccur to me that this book by Edy would\nbe a great\ntool for helping people to understand\nthat the way that they experience the\nworld it might be different than how\nother people experience the world and\neven a little bit of a window on that it\nwould be a good thing so I'd like to ask\nyou more about this word\naffect and then I'd like to discuss how\nthings that we do or don't do might be\nuseful for putting us in Broad\ncategories of affect so that we might\nexperience particular arrays of emotions\num so this is my attempt to understand\naffect in an effort to think about some\nactionable items\nabsolutely I love the word affect the\nway you described it setting up a\npotential or a series of potentialities\nfor different emotions to occur you know\nI make it a point to get sunlight in my\neye in the morning to try and wake up my\nbrain and body because indeed it does\nthat um uh broadly speaking I make an\neffort to get good sleep at night\nbecause that makes everything better\nabsolutely and when I'm not sleeping\nwell or enough it makes everything worse\nthis is non-clinical non- nuanced\nlanguage but I think most people when\nthey hear affect and if they think about\nthe examples I just gave kind of\nunderstand like yeah like when a kid is\ntired young kid they get cranky when\nwe're sleep deprived we get cranky\nindeed there are times when I'm sleep\ndeprived and Little Things Great on me\nthey like a splinter just feels super\nannoying and maybe even painful but when\nI'm well rested things are going better\nit's not that bad so tell tell us more\nabout affect because I think it's a\nreally important Anchor Point for us to\nunderstand emotions in ourselves and\nother people\nneuroscientists\nthink\nabout the sensory systems for touch and\nproception which we call somata\nsensation as being in the service of\nmotor move skeletal motor movements you\nreally the our sense of touch and even\nVision actually also works this way um\nand he and actually audition does too\nthese senses actually serve in um the\nbrain's ability to um control the\nmovements of the body and the same thing\nis\ntrue uh for the um regulating the\nsystems of the body so brains one of\ntheir fundamental jobs are to coordinate\nand um regulate the systems inside your\nbody your heart your lungs your gut you\nknow all the moving parts and the\ninformation the the sensory signals that\nthat those um organs and and tissues and\nso on send back to the\nbrain\num as I said before those sensory\nsignals are important to the brain's\nability to regulate the body but we\ndon't feel them\ndirectly we usually experience them as\naffective feelings these very simple\nphysical sorts of feelings and then we\nelaborate them in various ways they they\nreally when they get very intense that\nthose are the moments when the brain\ncreates a creates a motion out of\nthem\nso the brain's regulation of the body\nthe predictive regulation of the body is\nthe technical term is allostasis but\nwhen I'm explaining this to the public I\nuse a metaphor and you know all\nmetaphors are wrong but some metaphors\nare less wrong and useful so the\nmetaphor that I use is um your brain is\nrunning a budget for your body and it's\nnot budgeting money it's budgeting\nglucose and salt and oxygen and water\nand all the nutrients that you need to\nstay alive and well and so you can think\nabout withdrawals from that budget like\nburning glucose or using up oxygen um\nyou can think about deposits like\nsleeping and eating um you can think\nabout you know\nsavings um so when you're with a friend\nwho you trust and you know everything\nyou do actually is just slightly less\nmetabolically expensive right and you\ncan also think about taxes um like if\nyou are stressed socially stressed\nwithin two hours of eating a meal that\nsame meal will cost\nyou aund the equivalent of 104 more\ncalories in the inefficiency that you\nwill metabolize it because of that\nstress um meaning you'll burn more\nenergy you'll be more\ninefficient in metabolizing the food so\nit's as if you had eaten 104 more\ncalories oh so I had exactly backwards\nand so over the course of a year that's\n11 pounds so when we say that people are\ntaxing on us yeah we like it's literally\ntrue their language Works their language\nworks so the way I describe it is that\nyou can think about affect as a quick\nand dirty summary of the state of your\nbody but\nbudget if things are going reasonably\nwell then you'll feel okay you might\neven feel\nPleasant if you're running a deficit in\nyour body budget then you're going to\nfeel fatigued or or\ndistressed and that doesn't mean\nsomething is necessarily wrong like for\nexample when you exercise you get to a\ncertain point where you've reached your\nventilatory load usually it's like you\nknow 20 minutes in or 10 minutes in or\nwhatever depending on how hard you're\nworking and you start to feel unpleasant\nand fatigued but that doesn't mean that\nsomething's wrong that just means that\nyou're working really hard and you have\nto push through it and then you know\nwhen you you know drink water and you\nknow you eat afterwards and replenish\nand then you're fine right in fact\nyou're better it's it's a a way of um\nbuilding a better stronger future\nyou so affect is basically you know when\nwhen things when you're feeling really\nworked up it probably means that\nsomething's uncertain\nsomewhere so I just think about these as\nlike quick and dirty ways of thinking\nabout your your what your what Your\naffect means and um and then oftentimes\nas we've said before emotion regulation\nthat is controlling emotion really\nactually is not so much about changing\nthe meaning of affect it's changing the\naffect um and um so it's useful to\nunderstand that affect is tied to the\nstate of your body or actually what it's\ntied to is your brain's beliefs about\nthe state of your body your brain is\nmodeling the state of the body and\nthat's interception that's the technical\nword interception is not your awareness\nof your body it's your brain's modeling\nof your body what your brain believes to\nbe true about the metabolic state of\nyour body and that's how I think about\naffect that's how I think about my own\naffect that's and my daughter actually\nwho um you know was depressed for so I\nshould say depression is like a bankrupt\nbody budget like you just can't move you\nyou feel fatigued so fatigued that you\ncan't move and you're very distressed\nit's like bankruptcy and actually if you\nI mean depression is a metabolic illness\nand if you look at the symptoms of\ndepression they really are about\nmetabolic\num uh having metabolic deficits\nbasically and it's interesting that one\nof the Hallmark features of depression\nsubjectively speaking is lack of\npositive anticipation about the future\nwhich makes perfect sense from the\nperspective of a depleted brain body\nbudget yes exactly you're and you're\nbasically think about the fact that\nprediction error right so if you're\nfeeling unpleasant you're not going to\nbe anticipating Pleasant things and even\nif those things that are in the world\ncould give you pleasure you won't notice\nthem because learn learning from\nprediction error things that you didn't\npredict is expensive and if you don't\nhave the resources you're not going to\nright so it's but anyways my daughter\ncame up with this um after we had this\nvery interesting thing that happened to\nus on another trip um we were in Sweden\nbecause I was giving a a keynote at The\nkolinska Institute and we went I took\nher to Sweden and this is when she was\nrecovering from depression and like you\nknow she is just one of the millions of\nyoung\nadults who you know adolesence young\nadults who were experiencing depression\nand uh we got to Sweden and she was very\nvery jet lagged we both were it was like\none of these like you know we had to\nlike you know Planes Trains and\nAutomobiles like it was just you know\ngetting there and she woke up the next\nmorning and\nshe she looked horrible she felt\nhorrible it actually seemed to me like\nshe was about to enter another\ndepressive episode and I said to her I\nbasically got her out of bed I fed her a\nmeal I gave her four ibuprofen and I put\nher back to sleep and she got up five\nhours later and she was absolutely fine\nher mood was fine now I'm not telling\nyou that Ibuprofen is the an\nanti-depressant that you should take if\nyou're depressed but what I'm telling\nyou is that you know you said something\nAndrew that was so interesting at the\nbeginning you said am I fatigued does my\nbody do I have pain somewhere is my body\nhurt you know these are well right when\nbasically what she was having was she\nwas fatigued and she was having what I\nwould call um it's called the technical\nword is visceral notion which means her\nstomach hurt her you know everything\nhurt and sure you know her muscles\nprobably hurt too but it was really her\ninnards really she just was distressed\nand the um the ibuprofen helped her get\nback to sleep and then she slept and she\ngot up and she was completely fine and\nthen we walked around Stockholm for the\nrest of the day talking about this\nexperience which for her was like\nflipping on a light switch you know how\nemotions are made this book that I\nreferred to I wrote that book for her I\nwrote that book for her but also for me\nbecause it was a way of putting down on\npaper all the things that I wanted her\nto know that and that I thought other\npeople should know about their kids you\nknow and maybe even their kids could\nread it but what she did with that was\nshe came up with a New\nConcept called the emotional flu and the\nemotional flu is when you're having a\nbad body budgeting day and you're just\nlike you didn't get enough sleep maybe\nor you know there's some stress at at at\nwork or at school that you can't get rid\nof otherwise you know my husband likes\nto say well uh you know other people's\nopinions of you are just electrical\nactivity in somebody's head which I love\nlike that's just another way of\ncategorizing it it's sort of like taking\napart the taking apart the cup into\npieces of light right and so whatever\nthere are just these moments where you\nfeel depleted and you could use that I\nmean the we usually we often use affect\nto as a as a indicator of how the world\nis you know if I feel bad something must\nbe bad wrong in the world but you have\nto resist that sometimes because\nsometimes there's nothing wrong in the\nworld it's just that you didn't get\nenough sleep or you know you need to\nhave a little bit more you know protein\nor maybe you haven't gone for a walk and\nyou're stiff or whatever you need to do\nsome stretching are those sorry to\ninterrupt but I think people are going\nto want to Anchor to a few of these um\nyou positive steps that they can take to\nto I don't want to say replenish but to\nshift affect in Positive Directions\nsleep movement nutrition yes and I've\nheard you say before that we are\nessentially amino acid forging machines\nso I noticed you said protein you didn't\nsay you need a bagel you said protein um\nwe could go down that rabbit hole maybe\nmaybe we do maybe we don't but I want to\nuse this also just as a quick\nopportunity to say as you're saying all\nthis one can immediately understand why\nalcohol and drugs of abuse are both so\ncompelling yeah right you're not feeling\nwell so take a you're feeling tired take\na stimulant that releases dopamine and\nepinephrine but you're taxing your\nalready taxed body budget yes in a way\nthat then puts you in a more depleted\nState later or alcohol like you feel\nlousy alcohol never did this for me but\nfriends I have who are recovered\nalcoholics will tell me that it was like\na magic Elixir it made them feel right\nthat's their language but then of course\nthere's a price to pay later because\nthen it drops your Baseline below where\nit was initially absolutely\n100% but I just also want to say that so\nis serotonin like so are so is so are\nssris\nmaybe and when I say maybe what I mean\nby that is if you you really have a\nmetabolic problem like say something's\nwrong with your mitochondria or you're\nrecovering from an illness and you know\nthat or or there's just some metabolic\nproblem in your\nbody that metabolic problem is\nreal if you start to feel unpleasant you\nwill I mean feel unpleasant it will feel\nyour mood will be\nnegative if you start taking serot if\nyou start taking ssris which will leave\nmore serotonin in the synapses your uh\nneurons before it's re it's taken up\nagain that will juice the system you\nwill be able to spend you'll be able to\nmove you'll feel like you have more\nenergy for a while but your nervous\nsystem is is a complex system and so\nit's going to make adjustments\nelsewhere to try to deal with that\nbudgeting problem so exactly what\nhappens when you take drugs of abuse and\nwhat happens on the short term can\nhappen for some people with ssris on the\nlonger term where at first it starts to\nwork and then it stops stops working and\nyou start to gain weight and you know\nand your because your metabolism is\nslowing because your brain is attempting\nto deal with that with that budgeting\nproblem so it really matters what the\nyou know what the source is it could be\nthat your brain believes you have a\nbudgeting problem but there really isn't\none it could be that there really is one\nthese things matter to how you treat it\none thing uh to um just mentioned about\nssris and I unfortunately for reasons of\nconfidentiality I can't cite The Source\non this but let me just say that\nsomebody who's highly informed in the in\nthe landscape of of pharmaceutical\ntreatments for um psychiatric challenges\nhas told me that there's an emerging\nTheory among psychiatrists is kind of a\ncollective emerging theory that um one\nof the reasons why nowadays you hear\nabout so-called treatment resistant\ndepression but you did not hear about\nso-called treatment resistant depression\nprior to the Advent of ssris is that\nthere's a growing body of thought in the\npsychiatric community that SSR eyes may\nover time as you're pointing out deplete\nthe very neural systems that subserve\nenhanced mood so it's it's different\nthan a drug of abuse that gives you a\nvery acute effect like methamphetamine\nor cocaine or alcohol but that over time\nyou may actually be pulling the very\nneural circuits and neurochemicals that\nwould allow for positive affect deeper\nand deeper into the trenches um so to\nspeak and so there's a growing number of\npeople who simply don't respond to the\ndrugs any longer or other treatments\nright so I wasn't trying to say the\nmechanism is the same I was basically\nsaying the theme is the same and I'm\nagreeing with you what happens over the\nshort term with drugs of abuse happens\nover the longer term with for some\npeople with ssris because it hasn't been\nrecognized yet that the that at the\nbasis depression is a metabolic problem\nand when you have a metabolic problem\nlike diabetes or obesity or like uh or\num heart disease it's not that that\ncauses depression it's that there's a\ncommon problem which is that somewhere\nin this very complex system of your\nmetabolism there's there there's a drag\nand it produces negative mood and that's\nhow you experience it sometimes it's\ngood not to turn it's productive not to\nturn uh that negative affect into to an\nemotion sometimes you know sometimes a\ncigar is just a cigar sometimes you just\nneed to deal with the affec of Problem\nby dealing with the physical your\nphysical state and that's the tricky bit\nis knowing when is affect telling you\nsomething is wrong with the world and\nwhen is it telling you that there's\nsomething wrong with your physical state\nthat you need to attend to I think\neverything to me at least starts with a\ngood night's sleep on a consistent basis\nand and every psychiatric Challenge and\nindeed suicide itself um is seems to be\nassociated with and often preceded by\nchallenges in sleeping changes in in in\ncircadian rhythm so I think um that's\nwhy to me sleep is the foundation of\nmental health and physical health yep\nabsolutely and so when I tell people\nwhen they say well what can I do I was\nlike well if there's only if there's\nonly one thing that you could pick I\nwould say get get a good night's sleep\non a regular basis if you could pick two\nmore I would say eat healthfully like\nstop eating pseudo food don't get me\nwrong like I love french fries I love\nfrench fries they're like that's like\nGod's most perfect food I mean really\nbut eat healthfully like eat real food\nand get exercise and if you do those\nthree things I know I sound like a\nmother and so feel free to roll your\neyes at me but as a neuroscientist those\nare the actually before you start with\nall the you know mentalizing Jedi tricks\nyou could just start with this and that\nwould actually take you pretty far and\nand um and that will resonate very well\nwith our audience um the basics of sleep\nexercise food sunlight and social\nconnection are the ones that we just\nanchor those five are the ones that that\nwe just keep returning to over and over\nagain and I think people will say oh\nit's just simple uh motherly advice but\nI would I think that those five things\neven just the one thing around sleep\nthere's some work that's required to get\nthat done so it's not as simple the\ncategories are simple but the work\nthat's required to get great sleep as\noften as one can on a consistent basis\nif you're raising kids have a career\nlive in the world um there's a lot there\nand so that's where I think there's\nthere's a there's an elaboration of of\nthings and one needs to learn to be be\nflexible like when you're traveling how\ndo you do that when you know friends are\nvisiting how do you do that when\nweather's off and so on the the\nrelationship piece is something I was\njust going to I was just going to say\nI'm so glad you mentioned that I'm so\nglad you mentioned that because You'\nsaid before and and this was another one\nof those moments I listen to you I've\nlistened to as many of your podcasts as\nI possibly can but I think it was the\nfirst or the second one with Lex fredman\num where you said you know we are\nregulating each other's nervous systems\nI will never forget that and you\nknow I imagine that you married your\nhusband for a number of different\nreasons but um when people pair up with\nromantic partners with friends with\nco-workers the ideal situation is one in\nwhich we are not tacked\nwhere maybe even people and just being\naround them or just knowing that they\nare in our lives provides a sort of\ndeposit to yeah it's a savings it\nprovides a saing for sure and and I\nthink that's a lot of what emotional\nresonance to put kind of Pop language on\nit is is all about who who feels good to\nbe around who doesn't feel good to be\naround I would say the best thing for a\nhuman nervous system is another human\nand the worst thing for a human nervous\nsystem\nis also another human and so you really\nwant to be around the people who make\nyou the best the best version of\nyourself that you could be and that\ndoesn't mean that you always get a\nsavings like sometimes you're sometimes\nyou're taking care of that person and so\nyou're you're absorbing some of the\ntheir burden right and vice versa but I\nwould\nsay the research on you know social\nisolation and loneliness and so on shows\nus that that you know well along with\nresearch on synchrony and there's just a\nwhole bunch of research to to suggest\nthat um we are the caretakers of each\nother's nervous systems and it doesn't\nmatter what your opinion is like it\ndoesn't you know it just but we just\nthat's how we evolved as a species and\nso you get to\ndecide what kind of a person are you\ngoing to be you know are you going to be\nuh are you going to be a savings or are\nyou going to be a tax and in general it\nseems that people who decide that\nthey're going to be a savings\num tend to because people gravitate\ntowards that and want more of that yeah\nand hopefully would provide that also I\nmean I think the reciprocity piece here\nfeels really really strong well that's a\nreally interesting thing about um about\nthe synchrony work right so there's work\nthat if you research that if you put\npeople together who don't even know each\nother but if they if they like each\nother and they they have a sense of\ntrust even after a couple of minutes\nthey start to synchronize their physical\nsignals their heart rate starts to\nsynchronize their movements start to syn\ntheir heart rate probably synchronizes\nbecause their breathing starts to\nsynchronize right and it's really\ninteresting to see what you what you\ntypically see is that who is pacing and\nwho is leading like one person is the\nleader and then the other person is the\nPacer um and I got that language from\nwhen I learned hypnosis by the way and\num but it switches back and forth like\nwho's the leader like in a in a good in\na in a what would we say good like in a\nin an interaction that looks productive\nit it's switching all the time who is\nwho who is pacing and who is leading\nit's not that always one person is is um\nis in charge so to speak physiologically\nspeaking we did a series recently on\nMental Health with Paul kti who's a um\npsychiatrist and the word narcissism\ncame up a few times because people have\na lot of questions about that you know\nand he um emphasized that narcissists\nare not confident they they operate from\na place of of a deficit of pleasure It's\nnever enough and an intense Envy\nalthough that's not how they present and\nthey're often usually not aware of it\nthemselves but it's what leads healthy\npeople to feel as if the interactions\nwith those people narcissists often can\nbe very compelling in the moment but\nthey feel very taxed afterwards and kind\nof confused by what happened and it\nsounds like it uh ties back to this lack\nof synchrony um on the positive side of\nthings um it's also clear from what you\njust said that when people regulate each\nother's nervous systems in a way where\npeople are making little deposits and\nproviding savings for each other or\nmaybe things are just neutral that um\nthose nervous systems are then in a\nposition to like pay attention to other\nthings too and and and not just try and\nwork out the Dynamics oh for sure oh and\nthat's very true at work so there's\nresearch showing that um especially in\nthe creativity you know sector\nInnovation sector of the economy the\nbest predictor of performance on the job\nis the extent to which people feel I\nmean after you account for sleep and and\nyou know watering and sleeping and\nfeeding right like the that um the best\npredictor is the amount of trust that\nyou have in your team and in your\nmanagers because if the world is\npredictable it could still be things\ncould be hard even when things are\nunpredictable you have people you know\nwho have your back and so basically what\nyou're doing is you're you're um they're\nmaking you know deposits or savings\nthey're causing Savings in each other's\nbody budgets so their their resources\ncan be spent on the harder things which\nis you know failing and you know call\nhaving to pick yourself back up and try\nagain which is you know partly what you\ndo when you're an innovator so I think\nthat there's also research to show that\nin your personal life when you do random\nacts of kindness for people or when\nyou're kind in general you derive also a\nbody budgeting benefit from that um you\nknow so for a while had a friend who um\nwe would meet each other for lunch once\na month and you know we would take turns\npaying I mean we could both pay for\nourselves but we kind of got a double\nhit you know he paid for me one month\nand then I would pay for him one month\nand then you know so we get the double\nhit of uh you know being kind to someone\nelse and uh you know and also they got\nthe you know benefit of someone being\nkind to them and I'll just say I think\nkindness is a I don't know that we have\nso many conversations about that in our\nculture right now but I think kindness\nis very very underrated and should be\nyou know like when I'm when my when I\nfeel like\n I bake bread for my\nneighbor who's in his 70s him and his\nwife that's what I do when I you know\nwhen I'm not feeling good and you know\nif I I mean after I've taken care of the\nphysical the possible uh physical cause\nis I and then I feel great because he's\nalways\nso he's always so grateful and and then\nI felt like I made his day better and\nthen also he helps me in other ways like\nwith my garden and stuff because he's\njust like a Master Gardener and so I\nfeel like we have this relationship\nwhere we help each other and I know it\nsounds really sappy\nbut and even though all the research\nbacks up what I'm saying I it doesn't\nquite describe the feeling of when\nsomeone is just really happy because you\njust gave them a little surprise and\nthey're you know like that's that's\nthere's just some juice in that I\nthink in some culture out there there's\na word for that and someone will tell us\nI'm sure there is I'm sure there is well\nI have to say um I've thoroughly enjoyed\nthis conversation oh me too I I've been\nlooking forward to it for a long time\nand you've provided us with a really\nBroad\nArc but also a deep dive into not just\nhow emotions are made not just about\naffect but as you mentioned earlier you\nknow really how the nervous system works\nand I I'm certain in fact that our\naudience is taking this in and realizing\nthat that knowledge is incredibly\npowerful the the addition of nuance both\nto language and to sort of\nself-reflection States um as extremely\nvaluable often times when one gets into\ninto a conversation that has some level\nof reductionism and you get into gnomen\nclature and things like that it can\nreally pull away from the the real life\nexperience of something but this is\nexactly the opposite what you've done\nfor us today is you've provided such a\nrich array of information that adds\nrichness and depth to the real life\nexperience and um and that is really\ninvaluable so on behalf of myself and\nall the listeners and the people\nwatching this I want to say thank you\nfor for today's discussion thank you for\nthe books you've written which we've\nprovided links to in the show note\ncaptions thanks for showing up on social\nmedia despite the um the the the\nchallenges that exist there sometimes\nyou always handle yourself uh so well\nthere and we'll refer people to your uh\nexcellent social media accounts as well\nand and just for all the work that\nyou're doing and that your laboratory\nand you're now director of various\nthings and related to Ai and more and\nwe'll talk about this hopefully in\nfuture episodes but uh just a really\nenormous thank you thank you thank you\nfor joining me for today's discussion\nabout the Psychology and Neuroscience of\nemotions
