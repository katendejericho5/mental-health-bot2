    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today my guest is Dr vivc\nMurthy Dr vivc Murthy is a medical\ndoctor and acting Surgeon General of the\nUnited States as Surgeon General of the\nUnited States Dr Murthy oversees more\nthan 6,000 dedicated Public Health\nofficers whose job is to protect protect\npromote and Advance our nation's Public\nHealth Dr Murthy received his bachelor's\ndegree from Harvard University and his\nmedical degree from the Yale University\nSchool of Medicine today's discussion\ncovers some of the most important issues\nin public health not just within the\nUnited States but worldwide including\nnutrition and the Obesity crisis as well\nas food additives and why certain food\nchemicals and additives are allowed in\nthe United States versus in other\ncountries we also discuss mental health\nthe youth mental Mental Health crisis\nthe adult Mental Health crisis and the\nglobal crisis of loneliness and\nisolation we also talk about corporate\ninterests that is whether or not big\nfood and big Pharma Industries actually\nimpact the research Andor decisions that\nthe US Surgeon General takes in his\ndirectives toward public health and of\ncourse we discussed some of the major\npublic health events that occurred over\nthe last 5 years and the current and\nfuture landscape of how to restore Faith\nboth in public health officials in\npublic health policy and science more\ngenerally by the end of today's episode\nyou not only will have learned a\ntremendous amount about public health\nand why you hear the particular Public\nHealth directives that you do but also\nhow to better interpret future Public\nHealth directives you will also come to\nlearn that as Surgeon General Dr Murthy\nhas both an extremely challenging job\nbut one that he meets with a tremendous\namount of both rigor and compassion\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is how however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is Maui Nei venison\nMaui Nei venison is the most\nnutrient-dense and delicious red meat\navailable I've spoken before on this\npodcast in Solo episodes and with guests\nabout the need to get approximately 1\ngram of high quality protein per pound\nof body weight each day for optimal\nnutrition now there are many different\nways that one can do that but a key\nthing is to make sure that you're not\ndoing that by ingesting excessive\ncalories Maui Nei venison has the\nhighest density of quality protein per\ncalorie and it achieves that in\ndelicious things like ground Meats\nvenison steaks jerky and bone broth I\nparticularly like the ground venison I\nmake those into venison burgers probably\nfive times a week or more I also like\nthe jerky for its convenience especially\nwhen I'm traveling or I'm especially\nbusy with work and know that I'm getting\nan extremely nutrient-dense high quality\nsource of protein if you'd like to try\nMaui Nei venison you can go to mauii\nVenison dcom huberman and get 20% off\nyour first order again that's Maui\nvenison\ndocomond to get 20% off today's episode\nis also brought To Us by Roka Roa makes\neyeglasses and sunglasses that are of\nthe absolute highest quality I've spent\na life time working on the biology the\nvisual system and I can tell you that\nyour visual system has to contend with\nan enormous number of challenges order\nfor you to be able to see clearly in\ndifferent environments Roa understands\nthe biology of the visual system and has\ndesigned their eyeglasses and sunglasses\nso that you always see with Crystal\nClarity originally their glasses were\ndesigned for performance that is for\nrunning and cycling and for sport and\nindeed they can still be used for\nperformance they won't slip off your\nface if you get sweaty they're extremely\nlightweight but I should mention that\nRoa eyeglasses and sunglasses come in\nsome of the Aesthetics more typically\nassociated with performance glasses like\nthose cyborg style glasses but they also\nhave a number of styles that you would\nbe perfectly comfortable wearing out to\ndinner or to work I wear readers at\nnight or when I drive and I wear\nsunglasses during the day if I happen to\nbe driving into bright light or outside\nand it's just overwhelmingly bright I do\nnot wear sunglasses when I do my morning\nsunlight viewing to set my circadian\nrhythm and I suggest that you do the\nsame if you'd like to try Roa eyeglasses\nor sunglasses you can go to Roka r.com\nand enter the code hubman to save 20%\noff your first order again that's Roa r\nand enter the code huberman at checkout\nand now for my discussion with Dr vivc\nMurthy Dr vivec Murthy welcome thanks so\nmuch Andrew and please call me vi I'm\ninformal okay VI my understanding based\non my internet search is that the role\nof the US Surgeon General is to provide\nscientific information on how to improve\nhealth and reduce risk of illness and\ninjury do I have that correct that is\ncorrect what are some other roles that\nyou play that perhaps would not come up\nin a a top uh top hit uh Google search\nthat that I ought to be aware of and\nthat our audience ought to be aware of\nwell here's how I I generally explain to\npeople there there two primary roles the\nSurgeon General has one is to engage\nwith the public and make sure that\npeople know about critical public health\nissues that they so they know what they\nare how to protect themselves and their\nfamilies this second role of the General\nis lesser known but it's equally as\nimportant which is to oversee one of the\neight Uniformed Services in the US\ngovernment and that is the United States\nPublic Health Service many people are\nfamiliar with the Army the Navy the Air\nForce we also have the US Public Health\nService which is 6,000 officers they\ninclude doctors nurses physical\ntherapists pharmacists Public Health\nEngineers a whole range of of healthcare\nfolks and their job is to protect our\nnation from public health threats so\nwhen Ebola came on the scene in\n2014 in a major way in West Africa we\nsent hundreds of officers to West Africa\nto set up the Monrovia medical unit in\nLiberia to treat people with li with uh\nwith ebola domestically when there are\nhurricanes or tornadoes we dispatch\nofficers and deploy them to go help\nstrengthen the social the public health\ninfrastructure but also to provide\nDirect Care we deployed thousands of\nofficers during coid so these officers\nuh I'm incredibly proud of them uh they\ncould be doing lots of stuff you know\noutside government in the private sector\nprobably making a whole lot more money\nand getting a you know working a lot\nless hard but they're really committed\nto protecting the public health of the\nnation so I have the privilege of\noverseeing that service as Surgeon\nGeneral and those those are those are\nthe jobs that I've signed up for in this\nrole got it I was not aware of that role\nand if I understood correctly these\npeople um these Public Health officers\num that presumably are made up of\nphysician\nand licensed psychologists and nurses\nand so forth um you said they could be\nmaking uh substantially higher incomes\nin the private sector but the work that\nthey're doing with you is their sole\ncareer at this point they're completely\ndevoted to that or they're doing this as\na side Hustle No they are full-time uh\ngovernment employees and and members of\nthe Public Health Service their day job\nis often in public health agencies where\nthey're embedded in communities helping\nday-to-day to advance public health and\nduring times of emergency uh we deploy\nthem uh you know and and they're they're\nextraordinarily well trained uh they're\nexperienced at dealing with adversity\nbut they bring a combination of skill\nand heart to their work and you really\nneed both to be effective at public\nhealth I'm glad that you mention the\nword emergency because in preparing for\nour discussion today it occurred to me\nthat in this uh list of roles that uh\nyour title assumes that scientific\ninformation on how to improve health\ncomes first then you mentioned emergency\nso what I'd like to talk about first is\nHealth not lack of Health but Health you\nknow so often we hear about um the\nMental Health crisis but what we're\nreally talking about is the lack of\nMental Health crisis AKA mental illness\nand rarely do we hear for instance what\nconstitutes mental health we hear what\nconstitutes mental illness whereas in\nthe domain of physical health there's a\nlot of information out there about how\nto be more physically healthy\ncardiovascular exercise resistance\nexercise yoga typee exercise Mobility\nEtc and of course some people have\nphysical health ailments and there's a\nlot of information in terms of how to\ndeal with that as well but what I would\nlike to know before we get into the long\nlist of issues that uh our nation\nconfronts um everything from obesity to\nfood additives to mental health\nissues what is going well in other words\nin the last let's say five 5 to 10 years\nhave there been any areas of physical\nhealth and mental health Improvement in\nthe US at large that we can attribute to\nsome of the public health initiatives uh\ndirectly so that's a really good\nquestion and let me just also say about\nthe very first point you raised that\nyou're absolutely right that we have\noperated primarily through an illness\nframe when we look at health and in my\nmind that's only one half of the\nequation right so when we are talking\nabout physical illness for example uh\nyou know as a doctor I learned how to\ndiagnose and treat someone with diabetes\nor with high blood pressure or with\ncoronary heart disease but we also know\nthat even if I don't have diabetes or\ncoronary heart disease uh or high blood\npressure even if I don't have any\ndiagnosable medical condition I may not\nbe at an optimal level of physical\nhealth right I may not be able to for\nexample walk around the block without\ngetting shorter breath I may not be able\nto play with my kids because my physical\nfitness and stamina is is insufficient I\nmay not be able to lift my luggage when\nI go to the airport because I don't have\nenough strength in my body yet I\nwouldn't have a diagnosable mental\nillness so I think it's easier to\nunderstand there with physical health\nthat we're not just aiming for lack of\nillness we're aiming to optimize our\nphysical health the same is true with\nmental health and I think when we talk\nabout mental health people think we're\njust the sole goal here is to prevent\ndiagnosable mental illness that is one\ngoal to both prevent and to manage uh\nmental illness when it arises but we\nalso need to recognize there's a whole\nother half of the spectrum where there\npeople who may not have diagnosable\nmental illness but are not operating\noptimally in their lives and that's\ndetracting from their fulfillment from\ntheir functionality like in not just at\nwork but also in their communities and\nin their families and so I think part of\nthe conversation that that I want us to\nhave as a country is about how to\noptimize mental health and well-being\nand that is includes preventing Mental\nIllness but it is much broader and\nbigger uh than that alone great yeah I\nthink it's so important that we\nrecognize that um treating disease is\ncritical obviously but that there's a\nlot that can be done to improve one's\nHealth even in the absence of any known\ndisease and um and you've got all these\nofficers these incredible Physicians and\nuh nurses and uh people at uh your\ndisposal I My Hope Is that they would\nalso be accessible for and currently\ncarrying out um efforts to transmit\ninformation to people about hey here are\nthe things that you can do every day\nevery week every month in order to make\nyour life as as healthy as possible um\nas well as you know rushing in under\nconditions of you know Public Health\ncrisis yeah it's a good good point and\nit's certainly you know many of our\nofficers do focus on this broader rubric\naround well-being but it's part of how\nwe need I think the the broader health\nsystem and public health system to\noperate even outside of government\nand this I think will require\nsignificant change and shift in how we\nthink about our jobs like when I went to\nmedical school the vast majority of the\nfocus was on diagnosing and treating\nillness it was much much less focused on\nthinking about how to enhance\nwell-being and when you ask talk to\npeople in their lives it becomes clear\nthat they want to do more than just\nprevent diagnosable illness they they\nwant to be able to walk their their\nchild down the aisle they want and have\nthe endurance to do that they want to be\nable to uh be independent often and\ncarry their groceries or carry their\nluggage um this is why I think we've got\nto broaden our focus in in public health\nand look when I came into this role um\nby the way I was not expecting to serve\nin government this was not part of some\n5 10 30 year plan uh when I was a a kid\nI was interested in medicine but I\nalways thought I was going to practice\nmedicine you know like my dad did and\nlike my like the clinic my mom ran you\nknow set up put up a shing sing Le see\npatients and uh be a primary care doctor\nand and feel good about the work I was\ndoing but what happened to me along the\nway is uh you know I I trained in\nmedicine I got interested in technology\nspent seven years building a technology\ncompany uh that was focused on health I\ngot I was I became increasingly worried\nabout the way we were delivering\nHealthcare and it felt like our\nhealthare system was broken people who\nneeded care couldn't get it it was often\ntoo expensive to get care we were\nfocusing on treatment solely and not\nenough on prevention so I started\ngetting involved in in advocating for a\nBetter Health Care system with doctors\naround the country when despite all that\nI still never thought I would work in\ngovernment but in 2013 uh is when\nPresident Obama's team had reached out\nto me and asked if I'd be interested in\nconsidering the position of Surgeon\nGeneral and what was interesting to me\nabout this position is it's actually\nvery different from most positions uh\nthat are appointed by President and\ngovernment and that it's supposed to be\nan independent position so my agenda the\nissues I choose to take on are not\ndetermined by a president or a party\nthey're determined by science and the\npublic interest uh and that's what's\nwhat guides me you know and that's what\nthat's what guided me in that first term\nwhen I served and when President Biden\nasked me to come back and serve as\nSurgeon General a second time that's\nwhat's guided me here too um so Biden um\nis not sending you notes saying hey\ncould you put some effort into uh you\nknow getting messages out about you know\nCo or could you put more effort into um\ngetting your team over to Maui to deal\nwith the you know the you know the\ntragedy there and which is a long Arc\ntragedy right we get the news in a in a\nin a blast of this happened and then the\nnext blast comes in about something else\nand we forget that there are physical\nand mental health crises that are\nongoing um and and then I have to\nimagine then start to overlap with one\nanother or is it so is it your decision\num where and how to deploy the financial\nand and Human Resources like okay we're\ngoing to put 10 people on Maui yeah\nwe're going to um put uh you know five\npeople in the Central States you know\ngoing around talking to um major\norganizations about what they need to do\nto prepare for this winter is that how\nit works or are you getting memos and um\nin other words who's your boss everyone\nhas a boss at some level mine are is are\nthe listeners of of this podcast at some\nlevel I work for them it used to also be\nmy bulldog\num but my my boss my wife and my two\nkids who are five and seven they I do\nwhat they tell me to got it got it so um\nbut how we make our decisions in the\noffice actually it's a bit different uh\nwith those two roles so on with with the\nsecond one with overseeing the\ncommission Corp our 6,000 officers they\nthe the decisions about how and when we\ndeploy officers are collaborative right\nso I you know we work with other\ncolleagues throughout the Department of\nHealth and Human Services we work with\npeople in FEMA across the administration\nbut we also work with States so\nsometimes states often often States will\nput in a request and say hey we need\nsupport here uh can you help so we'll\nwork with colleagues across our\ndepartment to say okay well we can\nmobilize our commission core officers\nwhat assets can you mobilize and then\ncollectively we will send a team out\nthere so for example we have officers\nhelping in Maui right now uh\nparticularly with mental health needs uh\nwhich are I worry only going to continue\nto grow over the weeks and months ahead\non the other side of the house when when\nit comes to deciding which issues we\nengage with the public on like in this\ncase mental health has been a big Focus\nuh area for me on on that front well we\ncertainly you know are open to\nsuggestions from the public members of\nCongress sometimes say hey can you help\nthe public understand about this issue\nyou know a lot of people have ideas and\nopinions but the decision about which\nissues to focus on those are our offices\nuh and to me that's important because\npart of the reason over time I believe\nthe public came to have some degree of\nfaith and trust in the office office is\nbecause they hope that the office was\nfunctioning the way you hope your doctor\nis functioning which is being an\nindependent source of information for\nyou uh and a source that has your best\ninterest at heart that's not being\npulled aside by political interests or\nby other agendas but the primary agenda\nis how can I help your health and so for\nme like we have to make an independent\nassessment there and say okay where is\nthe need uh the greatest tier where can\nwe make the biggest difference sometimes\nwe may not build an initiative on an\nissue and that doesn't mean that that\nISU is not important or that it's not\naffecting a lot of people but we have to\nmake hard decisions about where to put\nlimited resources and so when I was a\nSurgeon General the the first time one\nof the big areas I focused on was the\nopioid crisis uh that we were dealing\nwith as well as the E ecigarette use\namong youth because we were seeing a\ndramatic increase uh among kids in\necigarette use that was can I just ask\nyou sorry to interrupt but I think it's\nrelevant here um has that increase\ncontinued or ecigarette use AKA vaping\nyeah yeah so we still see unfortunately\nthere there's been some improvements but\nwe still see way too many kids who are\nusing uh vaping devices early on and\npart of what we did from our office is\nrecognizing that we actually issued the\nfirst Federal report on ecigarettes and\nyouth uh we call the country's attention\nto the fact that this is a crisis we\nworked with members of Congress uh to\ntalk about the kind of action we needed\nuh from a legislative and Regulatory\nperspective and worked with colleagues\nat the FDA and in government as well but\nthere are two things that are really\nmost important in guiding our choice\nabout priorities uh one is data we look\nat what the numbers actually tell us\nabout the impact these issues are having\non the population as well as the\ntrajectory of Rise if something's\ngetting dramatically worse and people\ndon't realize it might be an area for us\nto focus but the other critical factor\nis what I hear from people on the road\nso I try to spend as much time as I can\nvisiting communities across the country\ndoing Town Halls meeting with uh\ncommunity members and just trying to\nfrankly just listen to what's on their\nmind and that's where I actually get a\nlot of information as well that tell\nlike that's actually how I came to focus\non the issue of loneliness and isolation\nit wasn't because it popped up in a\nreport uh as being uh the the leading\npublic health issue in the country it\nwas because everywhere I was going in\n2014\n2015 whether I was talking to college\nstudents talking to retired Americans\ntalking to parents in rural areas and\nurban areas I kept hearing these stories\nabout people who felt like they were on\ntheir own or they felt invisible or they\nfelt if they disappeared tomorrow no one\nwould even care or they felt like they\njust didn't belong and it's\nheartbreaking to hear that from anyone\nit's particularly heartbreaking to hear\nit from kids uh who you hope are\nentering life and looking forward to\nwhat comes uh but many kids weren't\nfeeling that\nway that is very useful context and we\nwill get back to the isolation um crisis\num such an important initiative that\nthat um I just will thank you now for\nhaving put out the the message on social\nmedia and elsewhere um about that um\nbecause I think one of the questions I\nhave in light of what you just said is\nit's clear that you got your ear to the\nground you're talking to different\npeople um it's also critically important\nthat people hear from you and know um\nnot just what's happening but that you\nperhaps want to know what uh you know\nwhere the issues lie and what the um\nwhat the actionable steps are that\npeople can take right and I think that\nwe now live in a hyperconnected world um\nso you know in fact I'll just say that\none of the reasons I launched this\npodcast is in 2020 I was going on\npodcast talking about things like\nmaintaining sleep and circadian rhythm\nand stuff from my lab related to trying\nto um adjust anxiety under under\nconditions where I think everyone was\nanxious and sleep rhythms were disrupted\nEtc um and I was somewhat surprised that\nthat I didn't get a warning on my phone\nhey make sure you're getting morning\nsunlight you know like I I'll get a\nflood warning uh you know I'll get a\nwarning that I might get a warning but\nit's only a test warning I'll get three\nof those yesterday living here near the\ncoast but um I don't think once during\nthe pandemic did I get a email or a\npublic service announcement saying hey\nyou know if you are going to be indoors\na lot you're going to have to be mindful\nof maintaining your circadian rhythm\nbecause if you're not I we know based on\nhundreds of studies now that drifts and\ncircadian rhythmicity are a precursor to\nmental health issues I mean in fact\nthere's a new idea that many not all\nsuicides um are preceded by a period of\ndisrupted sleep which is you know kind\nof makes sense in in um and it's not uh\ncausal of course but how come during the\npandemic we each and all as US citizens\ndid not get\nan email or a text message saying hey\nthese are five things that you need to\ndo every day to try and stay as stable\nas possible in this very uncertain\nlandscape that we're in well it's a\nreally good question and and I think\nit's a it's a\nreasonable and a very good suggestion to\nsay that hey look there should be a\nclear and comprehensive way that we can\nget messages out to everyone um like if\nwe were working in a hospital system and\nthere was a safety issue that came up\nthere would be an email sent to all the\nhospital staff members saying hey this\nis something you need to be aware of\nright so I think it's a reasonable\nexpectation uh practically if you go\nback though over the last 20 30 years\nfor on a on health issues there hasn't\nbeen sort of an agency or an entity that\nhas sent emails out to everyone first of\nall how to send an email out to everyone\nin America is not a simple proposition\neither technically it's challenging\nthere's some legal issues you'd have to\ndeal with as well but you could do a\nnight where you go CNN Fox NBC ABC New\nYork Times Wall Street like you could\nhit the right the the right wi the left\nwing and everything yeah that's a really\ninteresting suggest like one but one one\nvideo just where they all agree like hey\nthis is important information so a\napolitical like no yeah so I would say\nthat that kind of messaging I would say\nthrough traditional media certainly has\nhappened you know and it happened during\ncoid uh it happened for example when um\nyou know during the first year of coid I\nwas a private citizen you know in the\nprivate private Administration but I you\nknow I watched both then and at the\nbeginning of the the Biden\nAdministration um many officials would\ngo out in front of cameras and say here\nare three things you need to do to keep\nyourself safe uh you know from from coid\nas and that was a big question people\nhad how do I keep myself safe okay here\nare three things you can do a couple of\nchallenges I would say here is that\nnumber one even if you hit all the major\nNetwork and cable news shows\nyou're still not reaching everyone right\nbecause we're living in a in a society\nwhere increasingly people are not\nwatching TV right they're getting their\nnews from other sources um the other\nthing uh that's important to know is\nthat attention shifts quickly you know\nin traditional media also from issue to\nissue and so you might get a clip you\nknow out at a certain uh day or you\nmight get on all the Sunday shows for\nexample but the next day you know that\nmessage isn't necessarily there you know\nit's it's gone and people's attention\nhas also switched off too so there were\nI mean I can count and you know we've\nlogged probably thousands of interviews\nat this point that we've done with\nmainstream media with sort of you know\nconcise messages about three things you\ncan do to protect yourself Etc and you\nknow I'm glad we did those we got to do\nthem but I think one of the things we\nthey don't we don't have right now in\nthe country and this is an I think a bit\nof an Health infrastructure challenge is\nwe actually don't have a quick efficient\nway to reach everyone in the country\nwith a health message just like what you\nyou said you know what if you wanted to\nget that message about three things to\nprotect yourself from let's say coid or\nthree things to do to you know support\nyour health and well-being during a time\nof Crisis or during a time of Health I\nmean again like not just the flood\nwarning but the the the daily because I\nI do think that most of mental and\nphysical health is the result of daily\npractices that are you know that build\non themselves sort of like compounding\ncompounded Investments and then of\ncourse there are acute challenges and\nchronic challenges that people face but\nthings of that sort too I I I think\nthose kind of messages in time of Health\nare are absolutely important as well and\nuh you know I think I think in the sort\nof I think fast-paced crisis-driven\nenvironment that we live in uh\nunfortunately people are often less are\npaying less attention to those\nmaintenance and Improvement messages\nthan they are to managing the crisis\nmessages but I think that they're\nequally as important but I do think that\nwhat you're pointing out is an\ninfrastructure piece that that needs to\nbe built which is a way for uh you know\nHealth authorities to reach people you\nknow with information quickly and\ncomprehensively uh I'll just tell you\nthat in the 1980s when C ever coup was\nSurgeon General one thing that he had\ndone done which was interesting is he\nhad actually sent a letter a physical\nletter uh to all households in America\nabout HIV a physical letter a physical\nletter some of our listeners won't know\nwhat that is yeah so thing you read\nabout in the history books or something\nshows up in your mailbox and you open it\nand um hopefully something you want to\nread this Cas this case he was worried\nabout HIV about the fact that people\ndidn't know about it so he worked\nthrough\nan with as I understand it with a member\nof Congress found you know a way to do\nthis from a funding perspective but it\nwas a very unusual move uh and one that\nwas never replicated since and there was\nnever infrastructure or funding to do\nthat again um when I was Surge General\nlast time you know you know some years\nago and then this time around one of the\nthings I did do is I was able ble to\nsend a physical letter to the medical\ncommunity uh the first time it was about\nthe opioid use crisis and about changing\nour prescribing practices in medicine so\nthat we expose fewer patients to the\nharm of opioids while making sure people\nwho needed them actually got them and\nthe second time it was about coid\nTherapeutics it was about making sure\nthat when we had data about medicines\nthat actually work like paid that we may\nactually offered them to patients made\nthem available to patients because we\nwere realizing that many people weren't\ngetting offered life-saving medic\niations even though they were in high\nrisk groups um so we were able to find\nyou know and we had to again there two\nhad to sort of creatively Cobble\ntogether resources funding this is all\nsort of you know sort of behind the\nscenes government stuff but the the\nbottom line is in in what you want in an\nemergency uh and what you want I think\nin the long term is a simple clear\ncomprehensive way that public health\nmessages can get out to people and to\nthis day what we still have to rely on\nare one traditional channels like you\nknow traditional media to cover the\ninitiatives we put out whether it's on\nsocial media and youth mental health or\non loneliness or on youth mental health\nmore broadly uh we will have to rely on\nonline channels uh which which we do as\nwell or we have to look to creative\nPartnerships that we build with people\nwho reach different audiences and then\ntogether uh we try to get out messages\nour office does all three uh of these\nbut uh it's a patchwork uh and and you\nknow and it's not always ideal but it's\nwhat we do now I think part of what this\nreflects is a broader challenge like in\ngovernment but also in society more\nbroadly which is that we have valued\nhistorically prevention and health\ncommunication very little we put the\nmass majority of our resources into\ntreatment strategies into getting\nmedications to people into diagnosis and\nthat's very important don't get me wrong\nbut we are now seeing with mental health\njust as one example that if we only\nfocus on expanding treatment and\ndeepening our well of knowledge there\nand we don't do anything to help people\nstay well that we just can't keep up\nright and right because one problem\nfeeds the other the kids that are stay\nlisten I if I would grown up in today's\nera I'd be on my phone and tablet late\nat night because I was up reading\nmagazines and talking to friends on the\nphone late at night right so it's not a\ncriticism but but you know disruptions\nin sleep disruptions in circadian rhythm\ndisruptions lack of physical activity\npoor nutrition social social isolation I\nmean these are all piling the sand much\nhigher on this in this other side of\nwhat you do in terms of and here I'm\nobviously stating the\nobvious you know so it's just going to\ncreate a mountain of issues on the other\nside which presumably has a larger\nbudget is what I'm sensing but doesn't\num but there's no way that budget is\nlarge enough to deal with that I mean if\nsomebody's kid for instance is um trying\nto address the issue of whether or not\nto go on prescription\nmedications and or by the way folks and\nor change their dietary intake because\nthey feel they might have ADHD for\ninstance I mean what are they going to\ndo they're going to Google they're going\nto listen to podcast that they they\nshould be able to write first to your\norganization and say you know what is\nthe highest level\nstringency data say about these issues\nand AI should be able to tell them\naccurately yeah and maybe you have\nsomebody chime in for them I mean we all\npay taxes\nI pay federal and state taxes um me too\nand and and to some extent happily so\nright um because it pays for public\nworks and and many many important things\npolice officers firefighters Etc but if\nyou don't have a channel to communicate\nwith people about what they and their\nkids and their relatives can do\nthen like to some extent it feels like\nit it's um it's a culde saac it's like\nhow how how how in the world can we get\nhealthy again or healthier as a as a\ncountry the part that keeps me up at\nnight is and one of some of the hardest\ndecisions I have to make in the office\nare putting aside issues that we know\ndeserve a lot more time and attention uh\nbut we just really don't have the\nresources to deal with you know the\nissues that we have dealt with I'm\ncertainly proud of my team that we\nworked hard to try to raise awareness of\nthe issues we have taken on whether it's\naround you know social media and youth\nand mental health or whether around\nisolation or clinical clinician burnout\nor other issues like that but the truth\nis that that there's more that needs to\nbe done more issues that need to be\ntackled and we have to get to a place\nwhere we can uh you know talk about what\nI think of as the core pillars of a\nhealthy life right which are sleep our\nnutrition our physical activity our\nsocial relationships like these are all\nvital elements to living a healthy life\nright now we're not teaching kids about\nthis in school right but if you think\nabout education uh and school\nas a place and a force that should PR\nprep kids for the rest of their lives\nthey should lay a foundation for a\nhealthy life going forward these\nabsolutely are important elements for\nkids to learn about I I think it's as\nimportant for kids to learn about how to\nbuild and maintain healthy relationships\nin their life as it is frankly for them\nto learn how to read and write and I\nknow that's a strong statement to make\nbut it is true in terms of its\ncontribution to their their happiness\ntheir fulfillment their health and their\nsuccess yeah I I I could not agree more\nuh we have a series that's out now with\na psychiatrist Paul kti about mental\nhealth not mental illness about\nself-inquiry and how to use self-inquiry\nand practices that do not require uh a\ntherapist in order to bolster mental\nmental health um of course therapists\ncan be very useful but not everyone has\naccess right and not everyone feels\ncomfortable doing that um but we are but\none channel I mean you are the governing\nbody for this um you're the Army uh Navy\nand Marine so to speak of of Health as\nmany of you know I've been taking ag1\ndaily since 2012 so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that's\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutrition needs now of\ncourse I try to get enough servings of\nvitamins and minerals through whole food\nsources that include vegetables and\nfruits every day but often times I\nsimply can't get enough servings but\nwith ag1 I'm sure to get enough vitamins\nand minerals and the probiotics that I\nneed and it also contains adaptogens to\nhelp buffer stress simply put I always\nfeel better when I take ag1 I have more\nfocus and energy and I sleep better and\nit also happens to taste great for all\nthese reasons whenever I'm asked if you\ncould take Just One supplement what\nwould it be I answer ag1 if you'd like\nto try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman\nto claim a special offer they'll give\nyou five free travel packs plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 to again that's\ndrink a1.com\nhuberman there's lots more to explore\nthere um we may have to do several uh of\nthese together but um to touch on all of\nthem but maybe we could um talk about a\nfew of the things that um our\nlisteners asked about when I solicited\nfor questions I got more than 10,000\nresponses across social media in a very\nshort amount of time but there was some\nredundancy um one of the things that I'm\nvery curious can I just say on that\npoint though and one I'm really glad\nthat you asked uh folks to submit\nquestions and it was really excited to\nsee how many people actually wrote in uh\nbut I think it's also just a testament\nto how you've done such an incredible\njob building a channel to the public to\nlet people know about these topics that\nyou know that are so vital to our health\nand well-being whether it's sleep or\nphysical activity or mental health uh\nand so I just want to thank you for all\nthe work you're doing trying to help\npeople understand more about health and\nclearly the fact that that folks are\nengaging they're sending questions and\nthey're sending comments to you means\nthat you're building a relationship\nthere with a lot of folks so just kudos\nto you for doing that well thank you the\nthe audience of the huberman Lab podcast\nis is the only reason we do it I mean I\nlove learning and teaching but um that's\nthe truth so they are the podcast um the\npodcast is them um so thank you for that\nuh there were a lot of questions and I\nalso wonder about why is it\nthat many food\nadditives and preservatives and dyes and\nthings of that sort that are not allowed\nin Europe are allowed in US Food\nProducts it's a really good question and\ndecisions around food and food safety in\nparticular are made by the Food and Drug\nAdministration so that's the FDA uh it's\nnot it's a separate agent independent\nagency it's not one that our office uh\nis involved in then sort of directing in\nany way uh and so we're not involved in\nthose decisions and don't have insight\ninto how they're making their drawing\ntheir conclusions but uh they do it in a\nprocess just that's you know Guided by\nscience just like they do with\nmedications with devices Etc with that\nsaid you know I am concerned\nthat dietary practices the food that\nmany Americans are consuming are in fact\nnot supporting their health and\nwell-being and in many ways are\ndetracting from it uh when we look at\nhighly processed foods one of the\nconcerns I have there is we often see\nsodium content is very high we see the\nsugar content uh is very high and you\nknow there are certainly additives in\nthere as well U that I think we I would\nlove to have more data on the actual\nHealth impacts of those but the bottom\nline is that a significant portion of\nour diet uh is comprised of Highly\nprocessed foods in America and and that\nworries me the AL other piece of this\nthat worries me are just how much you\nknow refined sugars are being added to\nso much of our foods and most people\nthink that sugars are only added to\nthings like desserts Etc but you look at\nspaghetti sauces salad dressing salad\ndressings a lot of these things which we\nthink of as Savory products have have\nsugar added to them as well and so we\nare\nconsuming I think unhealthy levels of\nsugar in our diet we're consuming a fair\namount of additives given the processed\nfood composition in our diet and I think\npart of the reason this is happening and\nI want to be very clear I don't fault\nindividuals out there for the\ncomposition of their diet necessarily\nbecause we have also made certain\ndecisions in our country about uh what\nwe subsidize about what's cheaper and\nmore expensive for people and the\ncheapest Foods unfortunately are often\nthe most unhealthy Foods the most highly\nprocessed foods uh if you are somebody\nwho lives in a low-income neighborhood\nnumber of these neighborhoods don't even\nhave grocery stores in them which is a\nyou know a tragedy because you can't get\nfresh produce Etc a lot of times your\nshopping your grocery shopping may be\ndone at a local convenience store uh at\na 7-Eleven or at you know or somewhere\nelse that may not have like the array of\nof fresh fruits and vegetables that you\nand your family need I don't even think\nthey have vegetables I think they have\nthey'll occasionally have some lemons or\napples or oranges and bananas but when I\nwalk into a convenience store what I see\nas a pharmacy I really do I see alcohol\ncaffeine energy drinks that have a\nnumber of different things in them\ndesigned to stimulate different\nneuromodulators like dopamine and\nserotonin I see nicotine products I see\nhigh sugar high highly processed foods\nand keep in mind I was a teenager I mean\nI drank my Slurpees I had my butter\nfingers you know I wasn't you know Bart\nSimpson like in my lovely butter fingers\nbut I liked them but but it was it was a\nsmaller fraction of of what we ate and\nwhen we were at home those Foods were\neither not available or we weren't we\ncertainly weren't allowed to eat them\nand um at libum you know um okay so\nwhat's clear to me is that the FDA makes\ndecisions about what is safe what's not\nsafe but for\ninstance okay this last year there were\nseveral papers published in highquality\njournals showing that if people\neat just High just Sweet and Savory\nFoods combined that neural in the brain\nrewire through process of\nneuroplasticity that drives increased\nappetite and changes the response to\nhealthier food so that they don't taste\nas as satiating okay that's sort of a\nduh to a lot of people but I think it\nwas an important set of findings because\nit said the brain actually changes in\nresponse to the um the very uh Rich\nflavorful foods that are associated with\nwith highly processed or even moderately\nprocessed foods okay I mean\num that's just a couple of studies um\nthere was nothing in those studies that\nsaid if you eat these Foods you're going\nto develop cancer but you know at some\npoint one has to as a citizen a\ntaxpaying citizen speaking on behalf of\nmany other taxpaying citizens I have to\nsort of take a step back and say how\nlong do we wait right do we have to get\na randomized clinical trial about the\nyou know the you know the five 100,000\nsick kids that grow into sick\nadults um and then run a trial where\nthey go on a an Elimination Diet where\nthey're eating only unprocessed vegan or\nunprocessed meat and vegetable or\nunprocessed you know starch and\nvegetable but I mean I mean then we're\ntalking about a 30-year Health crisis\nbefore we intervene why not I mean if I\nwere in charge which I'm not and clearly\nI wouldn't survive in a government\norganization because um well I've got\nthe uniform down um I always wear the\nsame thing but um a uniform but I\nwouldn't because I would want to say\nwait you know why not a on the side of\ncaution why not send out this AI\ngenerated text message that tells\neverybody in all the languages that\nAmericans speak and can understand hey\nyou get to make choices about what you\neat but you should be aware that um\nmaking your diet comprised of more than\n15 to 20% of these Foods is potentially\ngoing to lead to serious issues down the\nroad and those serious issues are\nextremely serious I mean the Obesity\ncrisis is really a crisis of both body\nand brain metabolic challenge um that we\ncan talk about so you know who sets the\nthresholds you know in other words why\nis it that in this country we have to\nwait until people start to get really\nsick and dying and really struggling\nbefore something is done in the\ndirection of their health and I'm not\nblaming you I just want to understand\nbecause um good question the the wealthy\npeople I know care a lot about their\nfood sources and they pay a lot of\nattention to it and why aren't we\nallowing everyone the opportunity to\nmake better choices so this is the right\nquestion and this is something I I think\nabout a lot because I'm conscious about\nwhat I eat but I also talk to folks\naround the country and realize a lot of\npeople don't have either the information\nuh or the resources to actually purchase\nhealthy food right and to know like\nwhat's going to be good for them and for\ntheir families this is why you know I\nmentioned we have a list of issues that\nyou know we would work on you know if we\nhad more more more resources this is\nactually one of them because to me one\nof the most common questions people ask\nis what should I eat\nthat's simple but it's it's vexing it's\ncomplicated it's incredibly confusing if\nyou go online and just try to search for\ninformation and it's a classic example\nof where it's important to have an\nobjective\nscientific Authority that can come and\nthen speak on Broad principles around\ndiet that can talk about what we know\nand don't know so here's important thing\nI think a lot of times people may see\nsomething as uh you know on the market\nthey might read list of ingredients they\ndon't recognize how of them because\nthey're additives but they figure well\nif it's there then it must have been\nstudied for 30 40 years and there must\nbe no harmful consequences right but\nsometimes things are are put out there\nbecause we have short-term data that\nsays that they're okay and there might\nbe uh but there may be a need for more\nlong-term data helping people understand\nwhat do we know what do we not know is\nimportant so that people can make\ndecisions for themselves based on how\nmuch risk they want to take the other\nthing that that concerns me here Andrew\nis I look I I have I'll tell you I have\na bias here and my bias is that I am\nworried about the you know additives and\nother products we have in food that\ndon't have long-term data uh that's\nclear in terms of health risk and so\nbecause of that like my bias is\ngenerally to think how can we get people\nuh you know minimally or less processed\nfoods and how can we get them more\nfruits and vegetables how can we make\nsure that they have that more available\nto them but we've got to not only make\nthe information available but we have to\nmake it accessible from a cost\nperspective if you don't have a grocery\nstore in your community if vegetables\nand fruits cost 3x what other foods do\nthat's going to be a problem right to\nchange diet the other thing we have to\nkeep in mind is that you know food\ncompanies you know a lot of them do a\ngreat job of actually trying to get\nhealthy nutritious food out to people\nyou know and kudos to them but I worry\nalso that there's an incentive also to\njust try to sell more and more and more\nof your product and one of the ways to\ndo that is to try to hack uh the body to\nkind of figure out okay well what kind\nof synthetic additives could I put\ntogether here or what kind of uh\ncombination of nutrients could I put\ntogether that will get people coming\nback for more and more and more and we\nsaw this in the nicotine industry you\nsaw the Nick industry you also I would\nsay another parallels you see it in\nsocial media as well where the business\nmodel of the social media platforms is\nbuilt on volume of use right how much\ntime am I spending on the platforms it's\nnot quality of time it's quantity of\ntime right so if that's the business\nmodel then you're going to design your\nplatform to Max maximize how much time\nsomeone spends on them regardless of\nwhether it's detracting from sleep\ndetracting from inperson interaction\ndetracting from anything else it's\nhealthy regardless of whether that may\nbe causing certain harms right like the\nbusiness model dictates you know in many\nways how these things are designed and\nthat applies I think to food as well so\nwhich is why I think it's incumbent upon\nus to be particularly cautious uh with\nhighly processed foods foods that foods\nthat have additives and to understand\nhow is this impacting our brain how is\nthat impacting our satiety\nhow is it um leading potentially to\nGreater ingestion that is healthy and\nleading to things like obesity which\nhave a whole host of other medical\nconditions from cancer to arthritis to\ndiabetes and heart disease associated\nwith it those are the questions as a as\na citizen as a father of two young kids\nwho's trying to bring them up at with a\nhealthy lifestyle those are the\nquestions that I would want to know the\nanswers to and it's one of the reasons I\nthink these kind of objective reports\nare so important for the\npublic I'm starting to see the the scope\nof the problem and the mechanics\ninvolved in trying to alleviate these\nissues are complex I I I I see that they\nare also one other thing that is\nimportant to do that so is you need to\nhave\nauthorities that can speak to these\nissues that are insulated from political\nretribution right so and to explain this\nlike Amen to that yeah I mean listen as\nsomebody forgive me for interrupting but\nsomebody who from time to time will um\nmake not recommendations but we'll offer\ninformation about potential actionable\nitems you know things that people could\ndo or not do according to a couple of\nstudies that come have come out I mean\nhave come under intense scrutiny from my\ncolleagues um who are like wait that's\nnot a randomized control trial how can\nyou do that and yet I know from being in\nthis field for a long time that for\ninstance the emerging therapies for for\nPTSD and depression that are now based\non federal funding for things like um\nand I'm not recommending this by the way\nfor children or for everybody but for\ninstance the um macro do psilocybin\ntherapeutically supported uh legal use\nof psilocybin for for uh major\ndepression the data there are they're\nnot perfect but they're pretty darn good\ncompared to the major\nssris um but for years if if an academic\nsaid the the words I just said they'd\nlose their job almost instantaneously\nbecause they're Controlled Substances um\nthat's a that's a Todo but then there\nare a number of things that we're\ntalking about here that are just about\nmaking better choices about things to\navoid right if people understood I think\nthat um is sugar poison well some of my\naudience will say sugar is poison it's\nas addictive as cocaine look it is not\nas addictive as cocaine or heroin it is\nnot however if a child or adult is\neating very sweet or very Savory Foods\nof any kind consistently if those are\nnot um healthy foods or if they are if\nthey contain unhealthy additives over\ntime the brain will rewire so that\nhealthy foods don't taste is good they\nwon't be the choices that people make\nand you're going to end up with a sick\nindividual period And I don't think we\nneed one more clinical trial funded by\nfederal tax dollars to support that\nstatement what I'm starting to gather is\nthat you're a very rational grounded\nbroad thinkinking individual I'm not\njust saying that because you're sitting\nhere and you're trained in medicine and\nyou understand the science uh but that\nyou don't have the means at your\ndisposal to put out a call that says hey\nfolks having some sugar every once in a\nwhile treating the kids to ice cream\ngreat but if 80% or more of the diet it\nof our kids isn't made up of minimally\nor non-processed Foods their brains are\ngoing to be rewired in unhealthy ways\nand you can almost expect that they're\ngoing to have some Health Challenge in\nthe future that may not be um you know\nautism or schizophrenia but is going to\nbe a major Health Challenge of a and\nthat is serious and Now's the Time to\nintervene by avoiding certain things and\nif you don't want to do it look it's a\nfree country at that level you're\nwelcome to do it but you'd be better off\nspending X number of dollars on these\nhealthier foods yeah because there's\nalso and we know this from my colleague\nAli crum's laboratory at Stanford that\neven the mere knowledge that certain\nfoods are nutritious can lead to more\nsatiety from eating those Foods at the\nlevel of hormone release not just\npsychologically you're telling yourself\nthe Orange is as tasty and and filling\nas a candy bar but the understanding of\nof the fact that it is nutritious\nactually leads to shifts in patterns of\nof you know grillin secretion Etc that\nthat change so people can be feel better\non a healthier slightly lower calorie\nnutrient enrich diet of healthy proteins\nand fruits and vegetables and it's not a\nmind trick it's it's physiology anyway I\nI I think um I I feel your pain frankly\nand I'll tell you look sometimes people\nask hey why don't you just go out and\nsay a couple of statements that you just\nsaid would that be fine like why why is\ntime needed to prep something like that\nwhy are resources needed Etc here's\nactually why like I know in today's day\nand age it's easy to just go and like\nrattle off off you know off the cff\nstatements or shoot from the Welcome on\nmy social media channels anytime and\nreally to get the word out to millions\nof people I appreciate that and I may\ntake you up on that but I'll tell you\nthat one of the reason one of the things\nwe always do recognizing that when we\nput out statements that people people\none they they trust it's coming from a\nscientific Authority and that it's been\nvetted right so we put the effort and\ntime into vetting this thoroughly we\ncheck sources we look at the data we\ntalk to experts we think about how to\ncommunicate this in the right way that's\nthe work the behind the scenes work sure\nuh that we do before we put out sort of\nreports and and initiatives because we\nwant people to have confidence you know\nin in what they're hearing we also know\nthat when we put out initiatives that\nother people build on them\nphilanthropists you know and and\nfoundations will then think about should\nI fund work in this area uh you know\nschools and workplaces will think about\nshifting some of their practice policy\nmakers will also think about legislation\nuh that they may uh want to design based\non that so we want to make sure it it's\nreally solid but the point I was making\nwhen I said also that we have to make\nsure that not just our office but folks\nwho are you know in public health and\nwho are in medicine who are trying to\nspeak to the public about their health\nthat they're protected from retribution\nand taxes this is what I meant which is\nthat saying things about diet saying\nthings about\ntobacco these can be challenging for\nsome folks because there are Industries\nbuilt around these right which may not\nalways like what you have to say uh if\nit hurts their business model or their\nbottom line and they may then lean on um\npolitical leaders elected leaders others\nto then try to silence you or or shut\nyou up and I'll tell you I've\nexperienced this in the past you know\nwhen I was Surgeon General during my\nfirst term I had issued two uh key\nreports one was on alcohol drugs and\nhealth about the addiction crisis uh and\nthe other was about the ecigarette\ncrisis among youth I will tell you that\nthere were plenty of people who were\nvery unhappy that I was issuing the\nFirst Federal report on ecigarettes um\nfolks who felt that hey um this is going\nto make folks unhappy it's going to\ncreate political pressure uh it's going\nto create a lot of problems uh similarly\nwith alcohol drugs and health there are\nmany folks who said hey if you do this\nyou're really going to upset the AL alol\nindustry do you really need to have\nalcohol in the report why don't you just\nfocus on other drugs um why don't you\ntake alcohol out of the title you know\nall of these sort of you know concerns\ntelling you this who so these are people\nwho get paid by the alcohol industry no\nthese are people in government who are\nreading the te leaves and who who are\nsupportive of the work we're doing but\nare saying hey like you're going to\nreally upset a lot of people in industry\nand you're also going to help a lot of\npeople yeah well this is what it comes\ndown to they say well and if you upset\nfolks then they're going to try to fire\nyou they're going to try to do all these\nthings to which honestly like my my\nresponse to a lot of these and the\nreason we just put them out anyway was\nbecause I said well the worst thing that\ncan happen is I get fired and that's\nokay you know if I if I go out knowing I\ndid the right thing here then I'm fine\nwith that I'm not looking to build a\nlifelong career in government I'm not\ndoing this job to like you know get to\nthe next thing on the ladder like this\nis about serving for the time I can I\nwant to be able to go to sleep at night\nlook myself in the mirror and know I did\nso with Integrity um so that was an easy\ndecision for me but but my point is that\nlike we have to be thoughtful that in\nthese issues that there are going to be\nheadwinds right I'm sure in your case\nfor example you've probably gotten push\nback from folks about talking about\ncertain things that may have rankled\nfolks who may have had an interest in\nthose issues and that's okay you keep\ntalking about them as as you should and\nI'm grateful for that um but this is\nespecially important at a time where I\nthink public trust in our institutions\nmore broadly and in science and in\nmedicine medicine have taken a hit over\nthe last few years and I think it's a\ntime where we have to be even more\nVigilant those of us in medicine and\npublic health to make sure that what we\ndo is based on data that we're\ntransparent about why we're saying what\nwe're saying that we're also clear about\nwhat we know and what we don't know so\nthat if recommendations change over time\npeople recognize that this isn't\nnecessarily flip-flopping you should\nchange your recommendations if the data\nchanges uh if the circumstances change\nso uh anyway this is all part of the\nwork that we've got to do but to me this\nis a really important part of the work\nthe Integrity behind our work in public\nhealth is not just about the issue we're\ntaking on today it's about the trust\nthat we need to rebuild uh in the field\nmore\nbroadly so if I understand\ncorrectly if you were to for instance uh\nput out a call that says look you know\nthere are food additives that are\nallowed in the US that are not allowed\nin Europe that may be of risk we don't\nhave enough data at present to say to\navoid these things but here's a kind of\na yellow zone you know you Green known\nto be safe red clearly known to be\nunsafe yellow we just don't know yet not\nenough data um so here's what my\nrecommendation would be for my children\nyeah it's free country you know um there\nare people that argue it's not but at\nleast at the level of which foods you\nwant to buy with your own budget um it's\nit's a free country so you're saying\nthat um you get messages that warnings\nabout certain things could lead to push\nback but if I have to imagine that\nthere's something and I'm not a\nconspiracy theorist but there has to be\neither the people that are saying look\nthere could be problems are just\nfriction averse they're just don't like\nanyone to be angry at anyone or um there\nthere must be some incentive for things\nto remain quiet I mean I mean certainly\nthe government has not had problems\nsaying uh to do things or to not do\nthings that had uh that upset companies\nor shut down companies or or elevated\ncompanies and their success so I I'm\nconf I'd like to know more about the\nback Contour of this well look I think\nand this is not too dissimilar for I\nthink what happens in in other\nIndustries but it's you know whenever\nyou you do something in whether it's in\nthe private sector or in government\npeople we what what are the pros cons\nwhat's the push back I'm going to get\nhow do I deal with that push back right\nuh and push back isn't always a bad\nthing right if you get push back from\nthe public people hey that doesn't make\nsense to makees that's you should listen\nto that and and use it to inform your\napproach but that's the public whose\nyour job is to serve I'm talking about\npush back from companies is is different\nright so when push back comes from\npeople who have a financial interest uh\nin the product that you may be\ncommenting on then you you've got to be\nyou need to know about that number one\nso that you know how to how to mitigate\nit and while people may take different\napproaches to this my Approach as a\npublic official as Surgeon General has\nbeen to say at the end of the day like\nI'm happy to to hear from anyone and in\nterms of their concerns or push back but\nat the end of the day what's going to\nguide my decisions about what we issues\nwe take on what decisions we make and\nwhat we say to the public is going to be\nwhat is in driven by science in the\npublic interest and if that means it's\npolitically inconvenient that's okay if\nthat means that you know something\nhappens you know to my job that's okay\ntoo you know like we look the bottom\nline is life is short we don't know how\nmuch time we have here we may as well\nmake the time we have count we as to do\nthe things uh that are right and that\nare going to serve people that's my\nsimple philosophy my parents taught me\nwhen I was growing up so that's the\napproach I I bring to this and that's\nwhy if we were to do let's say an\ninitiative on diet I have no doubt that\nsome of the things that we would say\nwould be perturbing uh to folks who had\na financial interest in the industry\nbecause I don't think that the current\nsetup in the industry is serving the\npublic well uh I I think we have made\nunhealthy Foods cheap that's a problem\nwe've made healthy foods expensive\nthat's a problem we put Health from a\ndietary perspective Out Of Reach for\nmillions of Americans that is a\nfundamental problem and we've also\ndisempowered people with by not giving\nthem the information that they need to\nmake decisions so even if you have\nresources I guarantee there are people\nlistening to this podcast and many more\npeople out there who go to the grocery\nstore and just feel confused like what\non Earth should I buy what's healthy\nwhat's okay anymore um it's just hard to\nknow and so I think we've done a\ndisservice by not doing more to help the\npublic understand and access healthy\nfoods and again it's why it's an issue\nthat\nyou know that that was on our list of\nissues that we would want to work on\nbecause I think that the public health\nneed here is is\nimmense I'd like to just take a brief\nbreak and thank one of our sponsors\nwhich is element element is an\nelectrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans plenty of salt sodium magnesium\nand potassium the so-called electrolytes\nand no sugar now salt magnesium and\npotassium are critical to the function\nof all the cells in your body in\nparticular to the function of your nerve\ncells also called neurons now people of\ncourse have varying levels of\nrequirements for sodium so people with\nhypertension or prehypertension probably\nshouldn't increase their sodium however\nmany people are surprised to find that\nby increasing their sodium intake they\nare able to function better cognitively\nand physically and that's because a lot\nof people especially people who are\nfollowing low carbohydrate or even\nmoderate carbohydrate and really clean\ndiets often times they're excreting a\nlot of water and electrolytes along with\nit and simply by increasing their\nelectrolyte intake using element they\njust feel better and function better I\ntypically drink element first thing in\nthe morning when I wake up in order to\nhydrate my body and make sure I have\nenough electrolytes and while I do any\nkind of physical training and certainly\nI drink element in my water when I'm in\nthe sauna and after going in the sauna\nbecause that causes quite a lot of\nsweating if you'd like to try element\nyou can go to drink element that's LM\nnt.com huberman to claim a free element\nsample pack with your purchase again\nthat's drink element LM nt.com\nhuberman I have a question about trust\nin big institutions and public health\ninitiatives in general um the question\nis about masks um early in the pandemic\nas I recall we were told that masks were\nnot necessary then we were told they are\nnecessary and I think for a lot of\npeople that flip in messaging um landed\nlike a parent telling their teenage kid\nto always wear a seat belt but then you\nlook into the front seat and Mom and Dad\naren't wearing seat belts and as anyone\nwho's been around teenagers there has\nbeen one you make that mistake once\nyou're not making it again and you may\nnever recover from that particular\nexample in other words the public felt\nlike there was a switch of messaging but\nwhat I don't recall happening was a like\na hey we got that one wrong so sorry on\nus MH you know what the new data say\nblank what I recall was a message of\ndon't and then do but there wasn't a lot\nof um kind of acknowledgment of of how\nchallenging the situation was it was\njust a lot of top down\nmandates and in my opinion and this is\njust my opinion I think that led to a\npretty rapid distrust of subsequent\nmessages from which we still haven't\nreally recovered um and\nso why do you think it's so challenging\nfor public facing officials to just say\nlook doing the best we can at the moment\nscrewed up\nbefore changing the message now may\nchange again we're navigating this in in\nreal time it's Dynamic yeah please stay\nwith us because you know goes without\nsaying there's been a huge Chasm around\nthis and related issues yeah look this\nit's an important question and look I\nI'm always I want to be thoughtful about\num you know how I comment on what was\ndone in the first year of the pandemic I\nwas I was a citizen I was outside\ngovernment and I don't know what was\nhappening inside government in terms of\nthe the decisions that were made made\nthere but I do know sometimes from my\nexperience in Ebola and in zika during\nthose uh experiences we had as a country\nthat in the you know in the fog of War\nwhen everything's coming at you\nsometimes it's hard to make the right\ndecision all the time right so I I want\nto give some of those folks who were\nthere uh you know in the first year of\nthe pandemic you know some benefit of\nthe doubt but I do think that the\nimportant thing uh the principle I I\ncertainly try to follow but one I think\nthat uh and you know we can all do\nbetter I Can Do Better certainly too uh\nbut I think an important principle for\nus in public health communication has to\nbe that we're\nclear that we're transparent about what\nwe know and what we don't know uh and\nthat we explain the why to people so if\nwe're telling someone to do something\nwhy is it because there's a lot of data\nbehind it is it because it's a sort of\nexpert agreement best practice because\nsometimes as you know in in medicine\nsometimes when we don't have enough data\nto guide us on on a therapeutic approach\nbut when the problem is imminent then\nsometimes experts will get together and\nput together expert inform formed\nguidelines to say okay look based on our\nbest judgment and the limited data we\nhave here's what we would recommend and\nas the data evolves we will change you\nknow and and modify those\nrecommendations we do that with\nhypertension right you evolve and update\nrecommendations we do that with lipids\num here too I think that has to be like\na key part of the approach I think one\nof the challenges that I saw many public\nhealth officials encounter was even when\nthey went out with Comprehensive\nmessages like that uh which are hard to\nfit into a sound bite or into simple\nposts on social media um often a lot of\nthat wasn't covered what gets covered is\nthe Top Line you know this is what's\nbeing recommended that's what's being\nrequired Etc all the explanation is lost\nit's missing right and I think we also\nare living in a time where people are\nreading headlines like they're living\nbusy lives right they're not\nnecessarily you know always hearing all\nof the Nuance you know that's being\nexplained um but I think that that's a\nchallenge right is like I know many\npublic officials struggled with how do\nyou deliver nuanced information uh at a\ntime when there isn't a clear black and\nwhite answer to things but I think the\nlast piece around this is um I think\nsomething I was taught early in medical\nschool is to approach your patients with\nhumility recognizing that even though\nyou have more training than they do uh\nyou don't aren't living their life you\ndon't necessarily know what they're\ngoing through and you shouldn't assume\num things about them right and so\napproaching with humility means that um\nyou've got to recognize that not\neveryone's going to be able to follow\nyour guidance and if they aren't able to\nthat doesn't mean you criticize them it\nalso means recognizing that people may\nhave ideas or suggestions for you that\nmay actually improve your\nrecommendations or how you communicate\nand so I these are the principles I\nthink that are important in public\ncommunication but I think that both the\nchallenge of translating nuanced\narguments into what's actually covered\nthat was tough for many public health\nofficials I think the other thing\nhonestly just on a human level that\nbecame hard for many of them and I I'm\nthinking particularly about local and\nstate public health officials who are on\nthe front lines that I talked to a lot\nwas they ended up getting attacked a lot\nand abused a lot during the pandemic and\nI don't just mean like attacked online I\nmean people showing up at their houses\npeople harassing their children uh\npeople threatening their safety um and\nand this was often people who were upset\nabout some of the requirements that were\nbeing put down from local Departments of\nhealth and you can understand Co was as\nstressful a time as we've seen recently\npeople lost their jobs people were\nlosing loved ones I mean talk about a\nstressful time but I think at a human\nlevel Public Health officials who were\nexposed to that kind of abuse and who\nstarted to worry about their children's\nsafety um many of them stepped out of\nthe arena and said is this really worth\nit to put my family at risk um and that\nwas hard because we lost a lot of good\nPublic Health people in that respect so\nI think I think in addition to having\nsort of these core principles of public\nhealth communication in place I think\nwhat we also need to restore is an\nenvironment where we of frankly of\nhumility and civility where where we\ndon't attack people you know who maybe\nhave different views or are coming out\nwith recommendations that um you know\nare not palatable uh to us and uh and I\nthink it's also incumbent upon our\nleaders in society to not Stoke that\nkind of resentment and violence as well\nCU that happened during the pandemic as\nCo got increasingly politicized and you\nknow while that may have been at times\ndone for political reasons here or there\nthe people who suffered were both the\npublic health leaders who were trying to\ndo the right thing for their communities\nand the public themselves who weren't\nable to have a clear direct channel uh\nto and a dialogue with their Public\nHealth officials uh because a lot of\nthat ended up getting closed off yeah I\nfeel like there was a lot of talking\ndown to the dissenters in the general\npublic yeah uh and I totally agree that\num you know getting violent or harassing\npeople with whom you disagree is is\ntotally inappropriate Andrew the one\nthing just to say about the humility\npiece and I'll give you an example here\nof where I think this could have and\nshould have been done better is it an\neffort for example around masks uh to\nrecommend that people wear masks and one\nimportant thing just to know is that\nwhen it comes to like schools requiring\nmasks like those are decisions that are\nmade on local levels right the federal\ngovernment doesn't mandate masks in\nschools uh doesn't have the authority to\ndo that so those are local local\ndecisions but at the end of the day\nthere were people who did not want their\nchildren to wear masks right for a\nvariety of reasons uh some worried about\ntheir develop Social Development some\nworried that it was adding stress to\ntheir kids like people had met different\nreasons why they may or may not have\nwanted their children to wear masks and\none of the things I think that was not\nhelpful was that when there were parents\nwho made the decision they didn't want\ntheir kids to wear masks um I think some\nof them received a lot of critic iism uh\nwithout people necessarily stopping to\nunderstand why they may have been making\nthat decision because I'll say as a\nparent whose children were in school you\nknow my kids are five and seven and um\nin the first year of the pandemic they\nwere doing preschool virtually which was\na nightmare it was incredibly hard for\nus even when they got back to school in\nthe fall of 2021 um it was a really\ntough like adjustment for them and I\ncould understand like some of the\nconcerns that parents uh were having\nwondering about hey how are these\nprecautions affecting my child's\nexperience and Social Development so on\nthe whole this the recommendation may\nstill be uh Hey improve ventilation your\nclassrooms recommend masking recommend\ntesting Etc but those recommendations I\nthink have to be made in a way that\nacknowledges like the humanity of people\nwho are may have a different point of\nview or may make a different decision uh\nfor their child and I know that when loc\nlocalities made the decision in many\ncases to require uh schools in their you\nknow kids in their District to wear a\nmask that put some parents who didn't\nwant that they put them in a hard place\nright and but I think that our failure\nto actually have an open honest\nrespectful conversation about this where\nwe didn't feel like we were uh each\nbeing attacked you know as parents for\nour decisions or as community members\nfor the decisions we were making I think\nthat not only hindered I think the\nresponse but I think it actually\ncontributed to this division the sense\nof black and whiteness that hey it's us\nagainst them and then suddenly if I was\nagainst one measure then I was against\nall of them you know or if I was for one\nmeasure I was for all of them because we\njust started segregating into sites uh\nand this became a polarized uh you know\nexperience at a time where really it\nshould have been a crisis that brought\nus together as messy as it was um and\nthat honestly Andrew is what I worry\nabout most for the next pandemic right\nlike I think we've learned a lot from\nthis pandemic about uh how to\nmanufacture vaccines and de and how to\ndevelop them quickly uh how to\ndistribute them uh efficiently uh and\nyou know we had one one was one of the I\nthink most historic and and effective\nvaccine distribution efforts in this\ncountry even though certainly could have\nbeen better but it was historic by by\nall measures um we've learned a lot\nabout how to do vaccines Therapeutics uh\na lot of the nuts and bolts of a\npandemic response well but I worry what\nwe are still struggling with is how we\nbuild trust how we communicate with the\npublic and how we stay together as a\ncountry in the face of adversity because\nif we're going to if we're divided the\nway we were during coid during the next\npandemic or the next you know for a\nthreat that may come from a foreign\nadversary that's a huge national\nsecurity issue for us and so that that's\nwhat keeps me up at night when I think\nabout the next pandemic that may come\ntwo questions relate to what you just\nsaid first of all um as it relates to\nvaccines in my opinion um and I think\nthe opinion of many people out there\nthat the response to the next pandemic\num will be heavily contingent\non at least some sort of acknowledgment\nthat there are people who at least feel\nthat there have been vaccine injuries\nright to Simply say um okay the previous\ntime round with coid went this way and\nnow there's now virus X right let's hope\nnot God forbid but sounds like it's\ncoming at some point and people are\ngoing to think to the last time and\nthey're going\nto immediately say well the last time we\nwere told to you know uh take a vaccine\nsome people had a good experience with\nthat other people didn't and it in this\nempathy model of acknowledging and you\nknow you know letting your moral compass\nguide and understanding the why behind\nwhat people are are are doing and how\nthey're reacting it seems to me that now\nwould be the time to at least try and\nunderstand where they're coming from\neven if one disagrees maybe even\nespecially if one disagrees and try and\nget people aligned now before the next\npandemic it and um so what efforts are\nbeing made if any to try and acknowledge\num that some people really do feel as if\nthey were harmed I'm not saying if they\nwere or not but clearly there are people\nwho feel that they were people they know\nwere harmed is there an effort to\npresent them with data to have\ndiscussions with them to try and get\npeople aligned so that the next time\naround uh we can be more of a unified\nfront whatever the necessary response\nhappens to be yeah no it's a really\nimportant question and and to me I\nalways go back to sort of first\nprinciples from practicing medicine\nright which is if there is a medicine\nyou give a patient and even if it helps\n99.99% of patients but this one\nparticular patient happen to be harmed\nby it you go in you acknowledge it you\ntalk about it and you together TR out a\npath for how you want to move forward\nand the path forward might be yes let's\nget rid of that medication but let's use\nan alternative let's try it or we can't\nuse that medication anymore here are the\nrisks you may sustain but we'll find\nother ways to protect you right so\nthat's what we would do in medicine\nright that's what I've done with\npatients over the years I think here too\nsimilarly when I think when it comes to\ntracking Adverse Events from vaccines\nthis is an area where the CDC and the\nFDA track and collaborate uh and\ntracking means not just not only\ncollecting reports from the public and\nfrom clinicians when they see uh an\neffect that may be related to a vaccine\nbut it also involves analyzing those to\nsee were they correlated or were there's\nactual causation there right because um\nyou know if I if today for example uh I\nfelt unwell uh and I trace back what\nhappened yesterday and it turns out hey\nI ate this burrito that was out in the\nthe Sun for way too long um the question\nis am I feeling sick because the burrito\nor did the burrito just happen to be you\nknow a you know something that happened\nbut it's independent of how I'm feeling\num maybe it turns out somebody was\nactually sick uh with a GI bug you know\naround me and that's the reason uh that\nI'm feeling the way I am today so the\nanalysis that needs to be done on cases\nthat are reported uh is important and\nit's something that the CDC and the FDA\ndo together now that analysis I think is\nessential to communicate clearly to the\npublic um and whenever I engage with\nfolks in the public which we do often\nand people will talk to me about their\nexperiences with vaccines I do think\nit's important to acknowledge what\npeople have gone through um like some\npeople for example like when I got uh\nvaccinated for Co for example I I felt\nlike I had mild flu like symptoms for a\ncouple of days you know it wasn't great\nI would have preferred I didn't you know\nhave those feelings like you know and uh\nthen I felt better a couple of days\nlater and then I moved on but you know I\nacknowledge it didn't feel good you know\nto to feel that way there are other\npeople who may have had U experiences\nwhere they felt that they had more\nserious uh you know side effects and\nthere may be a question was that related\nto the vaccine or not so I think we have\nto both hear and acknowledge those I\ncertainly try to do that I know I think\nit's important to keep doing that across\nall of government but I also think it's\nimportant for us to to help people\nunderstand the process that we have to\ngo through to understand whether those\nare related or not if you go online and\nthe cdc's uh site where they collect a\nlot of this information and you just\npurely look at reports that are given of\npotential adverse effects\nthat you can't sort of take that and say\nah those are all related to the vaccine\nlook at this rate of harm it's\nextraordinarily High because we don't\nactually do that with any other vaccine\nor medicine right sure we we start there\nwe do the analysis and we try to\nunderstand what's actually related or\nnot so I think that's that's what we've\ngot to do here too one last thing I'll\nsay is that it's important I think also\nfor us to to help put this in context of\nother vaccines and medicines and\ninterventions that we use so for example\njust take Tylenol for example like most\npeople think oh well Tylenol it's safe\nthere's nothing bad happens if you take\nTylenol Etc but people who track the\ndata know that Tylenol by and large is a\ngenerally speaking a safe medication but\nthere are people who experience adverse\neffects from Tylenol liver damage you\nknow and and other adverse effects uh\nand you know that data is available but\nwhat has happened in the case of that\nmedication is that the risks and\nbenefits are both analyzed and then a\nrecommendation is put forward about a\ngenerally safe way to use it and then\nthere's data put out about the the side\neffects common or rare right but I think\nsometimes we also forget that a lot of\nthe medicines that we have come to take\nand just see as normal part of our life\njust like any other vaccine like there's\nsome rate of rare side effects that will\nhappen I say that because what I worry\nabout in the black and white environment\nthat we're living in is sometimes people\nwill take an anecdote about a potential\nadverse effect and we'll portray that as\nthe rule right and we'll say well look I\nknow somebody who had this side effect\nso nobody should take this because this\nis what's going to happen to you if we\ndid that nobody would ever take Tylenol\nno one would ever take Ibuprofen no one\nwould take NyQuil like no one would take\nany of the common medications that we\npick up at the drugstore and that we\ncommonly use so uh that's how I think we\nhave to approach this with a combination\nof of clear communication empathic\nlistening and and data and cont text um\nagain that doesn't fit neatly in a in a\nin a social media post per se but I\nthink part of what we're we need to do\nas a country is rebuild the relationship\nhonestly between the medical and public\nhealth establishment and the public and\nI think it's starts with this kind of\ncommunication uh the other question I\nhad about the next pandemic and the one\nwe just had is uh why not have\nCommittees of people of diverse\nbackgrounds socioeconomic diversity\nracial diversity\nuh every aspect of diversity rather than\nindividuals standing there telling us\nwhat to do for several reasons one is um\nwe are a country of many different\npeople yeah I think we um there are\ndozens if not hundreds of scientific\npapers showing that patients follow the\nadvice of doctors that look like them\nand sound like them or to whom they\nwould aspire to be like yeah we know\nthis and yet Public Health officials\ntypically are unitary one person telling\nus do this don't do that this is a good\nidea that's a bad idea I I'm but one\ncitizen but I'm putting up both hands\nboth feet and all toes and saying that\ncommittees small but diverse committees\nthat people can relate to and feel as if\num the messages that they're getting are\nvetted through a common understanding\nyeah so it's a really good suggestion\nand and I could agree with you more that\nA diversity of voices is really\nimportant to to get a message out out\nand during Co actually that's one of the\nthings that our office actually was was\nhelping to build was something called\nthe community core right where we\nactually we recognize so very clearly\nthis is something I you know I came to\nsee as a doctor sometimes I was the\nright person to message to a patient\nsometimes I wasn't right sometimes it\nwas the nurse sometimes it was uh the\nmedical student sometimes it was an\nadministrator or the the social worker\nwith different background different life\nexperiences so part of this work is\nknowing when to step up when to step\nback right but the community Corp that\nwe were building was a really diverse uh\nyou know group of people um and a lot of\nthem had Public Health backgrounds but a\nlot of them were Community leaders who\nunderstood Health even though they\ndidn't have formal training um but\nthey're people who knew their\ncommunities right and they had the trust\nof their communities and they understood\nwhat was going on they wanted to be\nhelpful so we brought them together to\nsay okay look here's what the science is\ntelling us here the general\nrecommendations um here's what we would\nprovide uh you ask us any questions you\nhave like if there's something we don't\nknow we'll go back and look it up um but\nyou're the leaders in your community\nthey should be hearing from you you know\nabout about these messages and then that\nthose folks went out and actually we\nworked closely with them collaborated\nwith them uh they would design the\nmessages for their community based on\nwhat they thought made sense they\nweren't taking what we said word for\nword and we didn't want them to um but\nto me like that kind of diverse approach\nis what we need more of now you know\nI'll tell you what I would I would have\nliked I would have liked if more media\nnetworks put those folks on TV and got\nthem on the radio right because it's\nimportant that many of them were showing\nup in their communities were knocking on\ndoors were uh doing local you know\npodcasts Etc and that was great but I\nwould have liked more of their faces I\ncarried on TV right so that's a place\nwhere when when we talk to media and\nwhen I talk to folks in media one of the\nthings I encourage them and push them to\ndo also is to say look if you can take\nmore of these diverse faces and voices\nand put them out there that's actually\ngood for the community and it also helps\npeople see that it's not like one or two\npeople who are sort of pushing an agenda\nhere this is like the Public Health\nCommunity is Big it's broad it's diverse\nit has a lot of voices and and as the\nmore voices we can hear from as public I\nthink the better off we are yeah here\nhere I I you know again I\ngenuinely hope and pray that we don't\nhave another pandemic but if and when we\ndo I hope there will be committees\nrather than individuals I know we you\nknow this is a thing in this country we\nlike the idea that one person's going to\nsave the climate one person's going to\nsave transportation one person you know\nthe covers the person of the year type\napproach um but we but then we get\nfrustrated when that person does things\nor makes decisions that we don't like in\ntheir public or personal life and then\nit all seems to fall into Division and I\njust feel like we not talking about\ngroups of hundreds of people but small\ngroups so I think we're aligned in that\nway yeah and and look there there's I\nthink a notion that um I think sometimes\nwe do want like the one person who can\nnot only necessarily have all our trust\nand we can look to but also who we can\nhold accountable you know if something\nuh doesn't quite work out if we don't\nlike something um and and while I get\nthat sort of mentality I think that in\nthis moment especially when we're trying\nto rebuild trust I think it's important\nfor people to know that what they may be\nhearing in terms of medical or SC Public\nHealth recommendations it's important\nfor them to know how broad an audience\nthat's coming from or broad a group of\nexperts right and we there was a lot\nmore broad agreement for example during\ncoid and uh during Ebola during zika on\nPublic Health recommendations but you\nwouldn't always know it if you turn on\nthe TV because you were seeing the same\ncouple of faces so I think we have to to\ncertainly diversify that um one other\nthing I think I'll tell you that's\nimportant here is I think we have to\nalso think about how we fund groups on\nthe ground that are doing the the hard\nwork of getting Public Health messages\nout because one of the things that those\ngroups often would tell me and these are\nI might say the groups I'm I'm talking\nabout the community organization that\nspent years in a neighborhood getting to\nknow families where folks recognize them\nwhen they're walking down the street\nthey're like oh yeah that's a person\nfrom organization X they understand us\nthey get us they're looking out for us a\nlot of those organizations had spent\ntheir resources helping the community\ngetting to know the community but they\ndidn't have sophisticated mechanisms to\napply for grants for example they didn't\nhave grant writers who had done this a\nthousand times so\nhistorically those groups have a hard\ntime getting support and funding so I'll\ntell you one interesting thing my my\nwife did which I certainly was very of\nis she was helping to to build an effort\nand to build a nonprofit organization\nwith a couple of colleagues that\norganization of people who knew how to\nget money how to apply for Grants how to\nget Foundation support but who also had\nthe wisdom to know that the most\nimportant they could do was to give\nportions of that money to groups on the\nground so they saw themselves as an\norganization that channeled money to\ngroups that had trust and they executed\ntheir their their mission that way and\nthat was very effective and I think we\nneed more of that when it comes to\ndisseminating funding one thing I think\nmany people may not uh may or may not\nappreciate is that when you it's\nactually hard from government to put out\na lot of money uh at once and to do so\nquickly right um like when you've got a\nlot of funds that you need to get into\ncommunities what happens is the federal\ngovernment often will give it to States\nstates will then give it to local\ncommunities uh to like the local\nDepartment of Public Health part\npotentially and then they will look to\ndistribute it to others that takes time\nbut also means if you're not connected\nto that network if you don't know your\nlocal Department of Health or you're not\nconnected to the State Department of\nHealth sometimes it can be challenging\nto figure out how to get the money and\nso I think we need more operations like\nyou know like what my wife and others\nhave been building to try to get those\nfunds directly to the folks who not you\ndon't necessarily have the most fancy\nyou know grant writing operation but\nthey have their relationships because at\nthe end of the day it's those\nrelationships that create the trust it's\na trust that allows in life-saving\ninformation\nto get to people and that's the link\nthat's missing very\ninteresting Pharma big Pharma I got a\nlot of questions\nabout whether or not big Pharma is on\nthe take for every Public Health\nInitiative now as uh somebody\nwho understands a bit about and\ncertainly believes in the use of certain\nprescription medications I find most um\nquestions about quote unquote big Pharma\nto overlook fact that there are\nthousands if not hundreds of thousands\nof medications that save lives and\nenrich people's lives that are\nprescription drugs um I also believe my\naudience knows I say it over and over\nagain that Better Living Through\nChemistry still requires Better Living\nwe still have to get our sunlight get\nour sleep social connection good\nnutrition exercise and all those things\nthere's just no pill that's going to\nreplace those yeah okay but I think it's\na valid question that people are\nasking is there a direct relationship\nbetween between big Pharma and public\nhealth initiatives in a way that should\nhave us concerned about the messaging\nthat we're getting and at times and the\nfact that the United States consumes the\nvast majority of drugs for mental health\nfor instance as compared to other\ncountries so that's one question and\nthen um I want to dovetail into that\nquestion what are your thoughts on the\nfact that you know there's a history of\nsay the tobacco industry being you know\nuh very uh interdigitated shall we say\nwith um government policies in ways that\nhad us basically injure if not kill\nmillions of Americans and then\neventually say you can't smoke on near a\nhospital you can't smoke anywhere\nthere's very few places where you can\nconsume tobacco products you know that\nthat kind of um relationship and\nfinancial incentives and then a lot of\nbackpedaling later um I think wore on\npeople's um trust MH so how should we\nframe the relationship\nbetween the pharmaceutical industry\ngovernment and public health initiatives\nin a way that is you know at least\nhalfway functional it look I I\nunderstand where the concern and\nsuspicion comes from right and look I I\nthink it's important that public health\ninitiatives and medical advice is\nindependent of the influence of\nindustries that may seek to profit uh\nfrom what's being recommended or from\nmedications that are being prescribed\nand we look we have a history in\nmedicine right of doctors who were you\nknow given gifts and vacations and all\nkinds of fancy things by Pharma\ncompanies in an effort to influence what\nthey prescribed that was really\nproblematic and now we're seeing a lot\nless of that which is good a lot of\nrules are being put in place by medical\nsocieties and professional societies and\nby academic institutions to say this is\nan unacceptable way to practice and\nthat's really important because I do\nthink that human psychology is that\nsometimes we underestimate how much\nwe're influenced by incentives we think\nah yeah I'm getting that but I know how\nto make independent decisions but at the\nend of the day we're human and and we\ninfluenced or it's a great drug it could\nbe wow this is a drug that's really\nhelping my patients I'm happy to\nrecommend it to them yeah so the this so\nI want to separate one thing though like\ntaking money from Pharma companies as a\nphysician I think is highly problematic\nright I think it's hard to say that it\ndoesn't influence practice maybe it\ndoesn't for some people but it's just\nit's really hard to know who those\npeople are um I do think that separate\nfrom that you can be a physician who\nprescribes medications because you\nbelieve they work look as a doctor I\nhave prescribed many antibiotics during\ncases of infection that have helped my\npatients and I would prescribe those\nagain I am glad that those exist um in\nmany cases they've saved the lives you\nknow of patients I was caring for in the\nhospital so that's what what should\ndrive us is is does the data show that\nthey work and does our patient need them\nright that's what should drive our\ndecisions when it comes to Public Health\nrecommendations here too I think a\nsimilar principle holds which is that I\ndon't think that Pharma money uh should\nbe influencing our Public Health\ndecisions which means that it shouldn't\nbe funding our public health\norganizations that are making\nrecommendations certainly I'll you know\nI know this is obvious to you but I'll\nsay just to be clear for everyone who's\nlistening like our office uh doesn't\ntake any money from industry not just\nPharma industry from any industry like\nour the money that we get is allocated\nby Congress at the end of the day it's\ntaxpayer money and that's all we get and\nand that's important we don't want money\nfrom the you know from pharmaceutical\ncompanies um but that's important\nbecause people need to know that these\ndecisions are not being made for for\nfinancial gain um with that being said I\nthere's a broader concern I have Andrew\nwhich is I think that we have become a\npill for every problem Society where we\nlook for a quick fix of a medicine for\nevery challenge uh that we may incur and\nsometimes yes I'm I'm a believer that if\nscience you know helps us create uh\nmedications that can help solve disease\nwe should use them appropriately but I\nthink we discount heavily the behavioral\nchanges that we need to make the more\nbroader societal and environmental\nchanges that we need to make that\ninfluence our health like our food\nenvironment matters for our health our\ndecisions about\nhow Physically Active we are matter for\nour health whether or not we sleep\nmatters for our health and all of these\nimpact our mental health and well-being\nas well and so I I when when I think\nabout the that bias that that to me is\nnot always you know stemming from money\nthat came from a pharmaceutical company\nalthough I think it the ads that we see\nall the time uh from Pharma companies I\nthink try to convince us that hey just\ntake this pill once a day and all your\nproblems will go away but I think it's\nmore complex than that and and I think\nthat even for you know in the health\ncare setting like if you're uh if you're\nseeing a patient who has pain uh who's\nhaving intense pain it feels easier\nsometimes to prescribe a medication for\nthat pain rather than trying to to deal\nwith non-medication based you know\napproaches or try to get the deeper\norigins of the pain I'm not saying\nthat's what doctors do all the time but\nI'm saying that we're living in an\nenvironment and a broader culture where\nwe I think increase ly reach for\nsomething that we see as a quick\nimmediate fix uh and again don't blame\npeople for that we rather take a quick\nfix over something that's going to take\na long time but I think it is selling us\nI think sometimes a false hope which is\nthat that's all we need to solve our\nproblems and I think a lot of times you\nneed more you need the behavioral\nchanges you need the environmental\nchanges um that's one of my big concerns\nin terms of how we communicate about\nhealth would a potential solution be\nthis idea of small committees so let's\nsay uh somebody is experiencing chronic\npain localized or general that they\nwould go to their general practitioner\nbut in the room would also be somebody\nwho understands sematic medicine uh a\ntrained clinical psychologists who\nunderstand sematics that the body and\nthe brain are linked through the nervous\nsystem um and could also assess um you\nknow possible psychological Roots uh of\nthe issue and then somebody in the room\nwho can make um Behavior\nnutritional um maybe even\nsupplementation based safe\nsupplementation based recommendations\nand then the physician who can say you\nknow and in addition to that I think the\nperson should have on hand you know a 5\nmilligram dosage of a prescription drug\nthat if they need it they could take and\nI think it would provide a lot of\nprotections against you know uh\npotential adverse effects of any one of\nthose things in isolation um there are\ngreat Protections in having people meet\nin groups um for lots of reasons and the\nperson would feel very well cared for um\nso again small Committees of people with\ndiverse expertise pooling together to\ntreat people from a for lack of a better\nword a more holistic perspective why not\nI mean you're describing the dream I\nthink that's exactly what we need\ninterdisciplinary teams that can provide\nintegrative care recognizing that in\nthis day and age there's not one person\nwho has all the expertise to help us\nfigure out how to best manage our health\nchallenges\num I think what we have not figured out\nare a couple of things number one who\nare all the right people who need to be\nin the room uh or the sort of virtual\nroom if you will the second is how do we\ncreate a a structure a Health Care\nSystem where that can actually happen\nwith efficiency where it can be\nreimbursed appropriately but that's what\nwe should be doing and then the Third\nLeg of that is the the group experience\nfor patients right and there's\nincreasingly in more clinics and healthc\nCare Systems around the country that are\nworking on creating group experiences\nwhere patients who all let's say are\nworking on diabet on their diabetes uh\ncome together let's say once a week and\nthey meet uh with the healthcare\npractitioner that might be an addition\nto their individual appointments but\nthere is so much power in groups coming\ntogether uh groups of patients who can\nfind Community who can help each other\nlearn from each other's experiences uh\nthat's highly underutilized right now in\nmedicine um but to really do this well\nAndrew I think means that we have to we\nhave to pull back from the model we have\nhad for years in medicine which has been\na very a highly individual type model\nwhich says okay you go to your doctor\nyou see your doctor oneon-one you get\neverything you need maybe you need to go\nsee a specialist okay then you wait a\nfew weeks get another appointment Drive\n30 miles go see somebody else maybe\nthey're connected to the electronic\nhealth system maybe they're not maybe\nthey know what was discussed maybe they\nthey don't maybe they'll call and talk\nto their primary care doctor but maybe\nthey won't because they're too busy and\nthen you as a patient are stuck trying\nto piece all this together while often\nin pain well yeah in in physical and\nemotional anguish I'm not referring to\nmy own experience although I've had you\nknow mild examples compared to what\nother people have dealt with but you\nknow people with chronic pain are\nirritable for understandable reasons I\nmean it it it's or maybe somebody's\nclose veering towards suicidal\ndepression then there's the\ninterpersonal effects I mean I feel like\nthe the crisis is is one of a lack of\nefficiency and thoroughness and um and\nagain I'm not throwing stones at the\nmedical profession I I like you believe\nthat it's a collection of mostly um\nwell-meaning people trying to do their\nbest but the specialist model and the\nreferral model is incredibly cumbersome\nit really is cumbersome and and like you\nlook I having worked with many medical\nprofessions over the years like these\nare colleagues who I deeply admire I\nmean like they're there for the right\nreasons they want to help people\nalleviate suffering but they too are\nfeeling burned out and frustrated by the\ninefficiencies of the system because\nI'll tell you one of the greatest\ncontributors to burnout for doctors and\nnurses is a lack of self-efficacy it's\nseeing a patient who has a problem in\nfront of you and feeling like you can't\nget them the help uh that they need that\nis a the greatest paper cut if you will\nuh to the sort of spirit of clinicians\nand many find themselves in that\ncircumstance where they either find that\nthey know what's needed but the system\nis throwing up prior authorizations or\nother insurance hurdles and prev their\npatient from getting that care or they\nare kind of at the edge of their\nexpertise right this happens to\npediatricians and primary care doctors\nmore broadly all the time with mental\nhealth right most of the mental health\ncare that's delivered in this country is\ndelivered in primary care offices right\nnow Primary Care offers didn't\nnecessarily train specifically and only\nin mental health yet they find\nthemselves having to manage a lot of\nthat including increasingly complex\nsubstance use disorders uh and you\ntreatment resistant depression and they\nneed help figuring that out but if you\ndon't have a lot of resources to get\nthat referral to collaborate with the\nmental health professionals then you're\nstuck on your own figuring that out and\nso you look I think the pain is being\nexperienced mostly by patients and but\nalso very much so by clinicians and\nthat's why that overhaul is needed and I\nI think look a lot of this is you know\nI'm not a healthcare Economist per se\nbut I will say that a lot of this I\nthink is tied into the business model\nthat we built around medicine uh the\nnotion that um you know we're paying\nindividual people for IND idual services\nand individual procedures that are done\nuh while that has some Merit in some\ncases what we really care about is that\nthe person is getting efficient\nintegrated multi-disciplinary care\noverall and so when health systems for\nexample come together and say okay\nrather than um sort of focusing on the\namount I'm getting reimbursed for every\nprocedure we're going to take more of a\nvalue based approach here where we say\nokay we've got a certain amount of money\nto care for certain people what's the\nmost efficient way for us to provide\nthem care\nrecognizing if we don't do that it's not\nonly bad for them but our costs in the\nlong term will go up because we're not\ngetting reimbursed for every procedure\nwe're getting reimbursed for the the\ncare overall care that we're taking for\na patient so there are more of these\nvalue-based models that are are being\nadopted uh certainly in 2010 when the\nAffordable Care Act was passed and when\nuh other measures were taken in the\nObama Administration in Medicare like\nthat really pushed value based payment\nmodels forward um and again they're not\nperfect they've got they need their own\ntweaks but I don't think that the\nexisting Financial structure that we had\nin medicine was serving Us in terms of\ndelivering the kind of\nmulti-disciplinary integrated efficient\ncare that we increasingly need tough\nproblem but through recognition of tough\nproblems comes good Solutions that's my\nbelief I'm an optimist at the end of the\nday you mentioned mental health uh\nlately you've been increasingly vocal\nabout the crisis of isolation just one\nsecond Andrew before we go there just\none thing I about the tough problems\nright you're exactly right and the\nproblem is the longer we take to\nacknowledge and address these tough\nproblems the more entrenched the\ninterests become that profit from the\nstatus quo right so if you look at um\nthe private insurance industry uh right\nnow there are so many challenges we have\nright now with patients and clinicians\nsaying that they know what care is\nneeded but it gets denied they know what\ncare is needed but prior authorizations\nyou know get grown up there and required\nuh even for a medicine that clearly your\npatient needs urgently you know I've had\nthe experience\nmyself of having a family member who's\nneeded a medication for an urgent\nsituation and then being told that the\npharmacy will not fill it because it\nrequires a prior authorization but that\ncan't be processed uh until the weekend\nis over because no one's in the office\nto approve the prior authorization and\nyou're thinking to yourself does this\nmake any sense like this is an urgent\nsituation my family member needs his\nmedication I've also had the experience\nas a doctor of fighting for my patients\nwho have been denied Care by an\ninsurance company being on the phone\nsaying I'm sitting here in front of my\npatient I know that they are sick I know\nthey can't go home I know they need to\nbe in rehab there's nobody literally to\nhelp them at home but then not having\nlike the the rehab bed approved by\nsomebody who's not even there right and\nthere's also just a a practice that\nwe've seen time and time again where\ninsurance companies will also just\nburden clinicians with more and more\nrequests for information before they\nwill agree to reimburse for services\nthat have already been delivered for a\npatient who needs them which is just\ncreating more and more barriers hoping\nthat if you're a small time doc out\nthere who's got you know your shingle\nthat you put up you don't have a lot of\nresources how are you going to keep\nfighting all of this and sending more\nand more paperwork and So eventually\nyou'll just give up um we have a lot of\nproblems right there in an industry that\nshould be delivering\ncare often is doing good things but too\noften I think is allowing barriers to be\nput up uh to the care that's needed and\nthis is particularly true with mental\nhealth I know we're going to talk about\nthat but Mental Health Care is just been\nsuch a difficult thing for people to get\nin our country and part of the reason\nthere are many reasons but one of them\nis that insurance companies historically\ndid not reimburse adequately or in the\nsame level for mental health care as\nthey did for physical healthare or if\nthey did they would only reimbursed for\na limited number of sessions that you\ncould have uh but how if if you're a mom\nout there who sees her child struggling\nuh with depression you're really worried\num you don't want to be told you know\nwhat uh you can only get three sessions\nthat's it what are you supposed to do\nafter three sessions right uh and so\nwhat has happened is that even though in\n2008 there was a law p called the\naddiction uh equity and mental health\nparity law even though that was passed\nto try to close that Gap there were many\nways that insurance companies were\nskirting it right so one the law wasn't\neven being adequately were enforced for\nmany years but two insurance companies\nsometimes would say okay you know we're\nreimbursing adequately but when you look\nin the network they had very few\nprovider so you really couldn't access\nsomebody right so that was a problem for\npatients and then the other challenge is\nthat they would say okay you can see\nsomebody but you've got to complete this\nprior authorization have that completed\nby your primary care doctor Etc again\nthrowing up more and more barriers so\nvery recently in fact just a few weeks\nago um President Biden just announced\nthat we are from as an Administration\nputting out a proposed rule to actually\nstrengthen uh the mental health parody\nlaw to prevent some of these what I\nthink of as abusive practices because\nthey're preventing people who need care\nfrom getting it and if you've ever been\nas I know many people have been who are\nlistening to this if you've ever been in\na situation where you or somebody you\nlove has struggled with a mental health\nconcern what you need in that circum\ncumstance is help you don't need to be\nfilling out paperwork you don't need to\nbe waiting 3 months to actually get care\nyou don't need to show up and be told\nonly you only have two more appointments\nyou need to know that help is there when\nyou need it and a lot of these uh\ndenials are are being issued to people\nwho have done their their part of the\nbargain they' paid their premiums\nthey've held up their end of the bargain\nand Care should be there for them when\nthey need it so anyway this is something\nthat upsets me a lot because I just I\nhave seen too many patients over the\nyears struggle without the care that\nthey deserve and should get because the\nbarriers that are being thrown up uh by\nindustry but I say all that just to say\nthat when you take on big problems you\nwill run up against entrenched interests\nand that's a fight we have to take on we\ncan't shy away from it we can't say you\nknow this is politically too difficult\nlike one of the things I'm very proud of\nis that we're finally negotiating on\ndrug prices through the Medicare program\nsomething that should have been done\ndecades ago but it's finally happening\nnow um you know the administration just\ndecided this has got to happen it was\npassed by Congress this is good uh\nand it just it makes no sense that we\nwould pay more than we need to and pass\nthe cost on to taxpayers uh when we can\nnegotiate and we got to get look you got\nto if you're collecting taxes as\nGovernment you should be doing your best\nto make sure every one of those dollars\nis being spent well right cuz somebody\ntook money out of their paycheck uh\ndidn't use it for their family didn't\nuse it for their kids and they gave to\nthe government for good reason because\nthat supports First Responders police\nofficers a whole bunch of services that\nwe need but the responsibil in\ngovernment is to make sure that money is\nbeing used well and to pay more for\nmedications than we should makes no\nsense at all especially for patients and\ntaxpayers so clearly some steps in the\nright direction are occurring while on\nthe topic of mental health um let's talk\nabout the isolation crisis um what is\nthe isolation crisis what aspects of\nmental and physical health is is it\nimpacting and then um perhaps most\nimportantly what can we each and all do\nabout it\nmhm well this is one of those issues\nthat I if you had told me Andrew 10\nyears ago hey you and I are going to be\nsitting here talking about loneliness\nand isolation I would have said I don't\nthink so but I was really educated by\npeople I met across the country about\nthe fact that this was a real problem\nand the truth is it was familiar to me\nbecause of my own personal experiences\nyou know as as a child I struggled a lot\nwith a sense of loneliness and isolation\nI was really shy as a kid I was pretty\nintroverted and I wanted to to make\nfriends and hang out with other kids but\nit took me a while to actually build\nthose relationships so um I spent a lot\nof time feeling left out you know there\nwere times when I I I I would like when\nin elementary school and there were days\nwhere I pretended I had a stomach ache\nand so that my mom wouldn't make me go\nto school and it wasn't cuz I was scared\nof a test or a teacher cuz I didn't want\nto like walk into the cafeteria one more\ntime\nand be scared that there was nobody to\nsit next to or that no one would want me\nto uh to be at their bench um I as I\nknow what it feels like and I also know\nwhat the shame is like because I never\ntold my parents about this well I never\ntold anyone about that um because even\nthough I knew my parents loved me I just\nfelt like hey if I'm feeling this lonely\nit means something's wrong with me I'm\nnot likable I'm not lovable I'm\nsomething's got to be it's got to be my\nfault in some way it was only years\nlater Andrew when I talked to friends\nfrom grade school that I realized that a\nlot of them were feeling the same thing\nwe were all struggling by ourselves uh\nno one really knew it and I came to see\na lot of this as a doctor when I was\ntaking care of patients and I never took\na class on loneliness in medical school\nit wasn't part of our residency\ncurriculum yet when I showed up in the\nhospital I found that the patient who\nhad come in with a diabetic wound\ninfection or who had come in um you know\nbecause they had had a heart attack when\nI sat down and talked to them often in\nthe background they would talk about how\nlonely they were sometimes I would ask\nthem hey you know I need to have a\ndifficult conversation about uh your\ndiagnosis is there somebody you'd want\nme to call to be with you during this\ntime and too often the answer was you\nknow I wish there was but there's nobody\nI'll just have the conversation by\nmyself so but it was when I was Surgeon\nGeneral I realized that those\nexperiences weren't limited to me and my\npatients but they were incredibly common\nand two things I learned when I dug into\nthe data Andrew was number one that\nloneliness is exceedingly common with\none in two adults in America reporting\nmeasurable levels of loneliness but the\nnumbers are actually even higher among\nyoung adults and adolescents the numbers\nand among uh youth actually depending on\nthe surveys you look at are between 70\nto 80% uh who say that they are\nstruggling with loneliness so that's the\nfirst thing that I learned but the\nsecond thing was how consequential\nloneliness was I used to think\nloneliness was just a bad feeling what I\ncame to see in digging into the\nscientific lit literature was that\nfeeling socially disconnected being\nlonely and isolated was actually\nassociated with increased risk of\ndepression anxiety suicide but also an\nincreased risk of cardiovascular disease\nof dementia and these are not small\nrisks we're talking about 29% increase\nin the risk of coronary heart disease\n31% risk and the increased risk of\nstroke 50% increased risk of dementia\namong older people increased risk of\npremature death and the mortality impact\nof of loneliness by the way and\nloneliness and isolation uh is\ncomparable uh you know to the mortality\nimpact of many other illnesses in fact\nit's even greater than the mortality\nimpact we see associated with obesity\nwhich is something we clearly recognize\nas a public health issue so you put all\nthis together and for me one of the key\ntakeaways is that loneliness and\nisolation are critical public health\nchallenges that are hiding behind the\ncurtain behind this wall of stigma and\nshame and unless we talk about it and\naddress it unless we reconcile what's\nbeen happening to us over the last 50\nyears where fewer and fewer people are\nparticipating in community organizations\nwhere more and more people are feeling\nisolated then we're not going to be able\nto repair the fraying foundations of\nsociety which are grounded fundamentally\nin our connection to one\nanother you mentioned Community\norganizations um could you elaborate on\nuh you know growing up in the 70s and\n80s\nI was exposed to like Community soccer\nteams swim team there was a community\npool these were all public uh things uh\nthere were um churches synagogues and\nmosques are we not seeing as much\nparticipation in those those types of\norganizations anymore and what other\ntypes of organizations are are out there\nthat um you know come to mind when you\nthink about the isolation crisis yeah so\nthere there are several factors that\nhave led to us being as isolated as we\nare one of them as you mentioned is the\ndecline in participation in community\norganizations and this isn't a recent\nphenomenon this has been happening over\nthe last half century in America we've\nseen lower participation in faith\norganizations in recreational leagues in\nservice organizations and other\ncommunity groups that used to bring us\ntogether and I think you know we can\ntalk about the reasons why that has been\nthe case U but one of the key\nconsequences of that is that\npeople don't have places where they can\ncome together and get to know one\nanother especially across differences so\nwe actually associate more and more with\npeople who are like us but this has also\nbeen fueled by a few other factors uh\nthat are going on at the same time one\nis that just from a cultural perspective\nas modernity has arrived not just in the\nUS but in other other countries we've\nseen that people are more mobile right\nthey move around more we don't always\nstay in the community that we grew up in\nuh we tend to even if we move somewhere\nelse for a school we may go somewhere\nelse for a job we may change jobs and\nmove somewhere else we are leaving\nbehind communities that we grew up with\nthat we went to school with that we\nworked with and I'm not saying that's\nall a bad thing right we're having more\nopportunities and that's a really good\nthing but I think one thing that we have\nnot accounted for is the cost of these\nchanges right if we know what the costs\nare of certain actions we may still take\nthose actions but we may find ways to\nmitigate the the costs we may in this\ncase invest more in our relationships be\nmore conscious about reaching out to\nother people going to visit at them uh\nbut that has been a a quiet but but\ndevastating Consequence the other piece\nwith modernity is that we have more\nconvenience in our life which means that\nwe also don't need to see other people\nto get certain things done like buying\ngroceries or mailing an item out or\ngetting something from the store I can\nsit in the comfort of my home and have\neverything just come to me now on the\none hand that's incredibly efficient\nright but I think efficiency is an\ninteresting thing because it's only one\nfactor we should be considering in our\nlives there too we have to ask the cost\nand one interesting thing about Co is\nmany people in the first year of Co when\nwe were all separated from one another\nyou know when we finally came back\ntogether again I had so many people who\nsaid to me you know what I expected to\nmiss my parents and my siblings and my\nfriends not being able to see them what\nI didn't\nexpect was missing the strangers that I\nsaw at the coffee shop or the folks who\nI ran into the grocery store or seeing\nneighbors as I walked down the street\nlike I actually missed that more than I\nthought I would so we have lost out on\nsome of those interactions and those\nloose ties but the final thing to keep\nin mind also is about what is happening\nwith how we are using social media\ntechnology which I think is\nfundamentally transformed how we\ninteract with one another and how we see\nourselves and each other and this is\nparticularly true for young people uh\nwho are growing up as digital natives\nbut what has happened there I worry is\nthat and and it's not that social media\nis all bad just to be clear you know\ntechnology look I'm I'm a believer that\nin technology broadly speaking you know\nI'm a user of technology I spent seven\nyears building a tech company I'm a\nBeliever in Tech but I think whether\ntechnology helps or hurts us is about\nhow it's designed and ultimately about\nhow it ends up being used and what we've\nseen with social media as well is that\nuh for many people it ended up leading\nto in-person connections being replaced\nwith online connections um we came to\nsomehow value and\num almost seek out more and more\nfollowers and friends on social media\nfeeling like somehow that made us more\nconnected but the nature of dialogue\nalso changed like as human beings we\nevolved over thousands of years to not\njust understand the words someone is\nsaying but to hear the tone of their\nvoice to see their facial expression\nlike you and I are sitting across and\nand we're both processing like our body\nlanguage right and I'm seeing you nod\nyour head and I'm seeing your eyes\nfocused like all of that matters to how\nwe communicate um but also like you and\nI are less likely to say something\nhurtful right now to one another because\nwe can see each other if I said\nsomething to hurtful to you like i'\nprobably see the the pain or\nconsternation on your face and that\nmight give me pause right when you're\ncommunicating online with other people\nwithout any of that information or with\nany of the uh sort of barriers if you\nwill that make you pause before you hurt\nsomeone it leads to a very different\nkind of communication uh one that can be\nquite hurtful at times and I also think\nthat one thing people many people don't\nrecognize is that to communicate with\nsomebody else and reach out and build a\nrelationship with someone it actually\ntakes a certain amount of self-esteem to\ndo that you have to believe the other\nperson's going to want to hang out with\nyou they're going to see something\nvaluable in you and for many young\npeople what has happened uh and I think\nfrankly for many older people too is\ntheir experience on social media has\nshredded their self-esteem as they\nconstantly comparing themselves to other\npeople like when you and I were growing\nup uh you know in the ' 80s we we\ncompared ourselves to other people too\nright people have from Millennia but\nwhat's fundamentally different now is\nthat in a given day you can compare\nyourself to thousands of images that you\nsee online that's actually literally\nwhat people young people tell me I do\nroundtables with college students and\nhigh school students all the time around\nthe country and the three things they\ntell me most consistently about their\nexperience of social media is it makes\nthem feel worse about themselves worse\nabout their friendships but they can't\nget off it because the platforms are\ndesigned to maximize the amount of time\nthey spend on them so you put all of\nthis together and I think what has\nhappened is that we're talking more but\nwe understand each other less we have a\nlot of\ninformation but we're lacking in the\nwisdom that comes from Human\nRelationships uh and I think that that's\nreally hurt us you know we see it\ncertainly in the data that tells us\nabout mental and physical health\noutcomes but there's also the human\nsuffering component Andrew like it's\nreally heartbreaking for me to travel\naround the country to hear hear from\npeople of all ages often in quiet\nwhispers about their struggles with\nisolation about how they feel like they\njust don't matter at all about how they\nfeel like they just don't have a place\nwhere they belong and it's these are\npeople on the outside look perfectly\nfine right they're posting happy things\nonline to Folks at work they're seeming\nlike everything's going great this is\nwhy I always tell people like you\nloneliness is a great masquerader it can\nlook like withdrawal and sadness it can\nlook like anger and irritability\nit can look like aloofness as well and\nso it's only when we stop to ask someone\nhow they're doing when we take pause for\na moment to maybe reflect on what's\nhappening in their life that we realize\nthat wow the majority of people in our\ncountry are actually struggling with\nloneliness yeah I'm a firm believer that\nour nervous system evolved under\nconditions of close interpersonal and\ndirect connection and um to suddenly\nthrow a technology in front of ourselves\nthat deprives our nervous system of its\nnormal development is it's clearly going\nto lead bad places it's also um clear to\nme as based on what you just described\nthat you know when we go on social media\nwe see something but they don't really\nsee us you know hence perhaps why people\nget um aggressive in the comment section\num you know they they want to be heard\nyeah um we want to be seen I think all\nof us want to be seen and see other\npeople yeah and uh social media doesn't\nallow for it so easily um I also so know\nthat a lot of young people will\ncongregate with their friends to play\nvideo games online but that's different\nyou're you're essentially showing up as\nan avatar MH and when you when we were\nkids we also played different characters\nin our in our games um but oh so\ndifferent now um do you think that there\nwill be a youth Rebellion movement\nagainst um these kinds of Technologies I\nmean there's a long history of of young\npeople rebelling against the the stuff\nthat's been put in front of them and\nthey're like nope no more we're going to\nRebel in fact that was the way that\nyouth overcame the um the nicotine e\nepidemic if you recall it was the\nadvertising pitching them against or\npitting them excuse me against um\nwealthy cackling older men in chair in\nrooms counting their money that was what\nactually was successful in getting kids\nto not smoke because kids have a\nrebellious streak as opposed to when\nthey were told hey smoking is terrible\nfor you your lungs are going to fill\nwith cancer kids didn't stop smoking\nteens stop smoking it was you know\nRebellion has been um baked into our\nnervous system uh in the Adolescent and\nteen years so do you see a rebellion\nagainst this um social isolation our\nkids going to start putting away their\nphones and hanging out together again\nand that's going to rescue us and that's\na way of saying what can we do for them\nwhat can they do for themselves and what\ncan we do as adults because there are a\nlot of um the silent suffering is the\nthing I also really worry about yeah so\nit's a good question and I think there\nis already uh a movement that's building\namong young people\nto create distance between them\nthemselves and their devices and\nparticularly social media and it it's\nit's cropping up in different ways I'm\nmeeting more and more some of these are\norganized efforts but I'm also meeting\nmore uh families uh where the parents\nand kids together have decided that\nthey're going to delay using social\nmedia and you know till past middle\nschool or in some cases even later or\nwhere they're deciding that they're\ngoing to draw boundaries around social\nmedia use or they're going to replace\ntheir smartphone with a dumb phone that\nallows them to do things like text and\nmake phone calls and use maps and and\nall that stuff but doesn't necessarily\nhave social media apps on it now this is\nstill a small minority and and we're\ndealing with a bit of a network effect\nhere right because if you're the only\none who's not on social media uh in your\nmiddle school class then you might feel\nleft out which is why it's so important\nfor parents to and and kids actually do\nthis together but I do think that to use\nyour analogy with smoking\nthat one thing that I I think many young\npeople bristle against is this notion of\nbeing manipulated and used for the\nprofit you know of a social media\nplatform and the reality is that the\nagain we've talked about how the\nfundamental business model is for most\nsocial media platforms is built on how\nmuch time you spend on those platforms\nthat translates to ad revenue and that\ntranslates to the bottom line whereas\nwhat I care about as a parent as search\nin general is about how well that time\nis being spent is it actually\ncontributing to the health and\nwell-being of a young person or or is it\nnot is it actually harming them and this\nis where I think when I go out and talk\nto young people about this number one\nI'm so impressed by a lot of young\npeople because they they already have a\nlot of these insights they're the ones\nliving it right they're not thinking\nthat this is all you know perfect and\nand it's all a pure benefit here they're\nthe ones telling me that it makes them\nfeel worse about themselves and and\ntheir friendships but they also having a\nhard time getting off of it uh because\nagain of how these platforms are\ndesigned so about a third of adolescence\nare saying that they're staying up till\nmidnight or later on week nights using\ntheir devices and a lot of that is\nsocial media use and this takes away\nfrom sleep which we know and you know\nbetter than anyone is so critical to the\nmental health and well-being of all of\nus but of young people in particular who\nare at a critical phase uh you know of\ndevelopment um the other thing that is\nvery concerning to me is nearly half of\nadolescents say that using social media\nhas made them feel worse about their\nbody image as they're constantly\ncomparing themselves to others online\nand we used to think that this is just\ngirls who are experiencing this and yes\nit is uh a lot of young girls who are\nexperiencing these body image issues but\nnow it's increasingly uh boys as well so\nthis is happening across the board but\nthe other piece I think that concerns me\nthinking about mental health symptoms is\nthat you look at how much time uh kids\nare using social media on average\nadolescent are using it for three and a\nhalf hours a day on average so just\nsocial media just social media and that\nmeans many you're using it for far more\nthan that and what you're finding though\nis that for adolescence who use it 3\nhours or more in a given day their risk\nof anxiety or depression symptoms double\nright so and if they average uses three\nand a half days that means that millions\nof kids all across our country the\nmajority of our kids are are at risk\nhere and so you know you put all this\ntogether and and it paints a very\nconcerning picture whatever benefits\nthere may be for some kids of using\nsocial media and there's some and we lay\nout some of this in our advisory on\nsocial media some kids find social media\nis a great way to express themselves to\nreach other people to find support\nespecially if they're from a community\nthat doesn't have a lot of folks who\nlike them around uh it can be really\nreassuring to connect with others but we\ncan't say that just you know that to get\nthose benefits we have to subject our\nchildren to all of these other harms\nright like kids are experiencing\nexposure to harmful content to\nharassment and bullying online six out\nof 10 uh adolescent girls are saying\nthey've been approached by strangers on\nsocial media and ways that made them\nfeel very uncomfortable um our kids are\nalso finding that Health promoting\nactivities in their lives are being\ncannibalized by their use of social\nmedia that it's detracting from time for\nSleep inperson interaction physical\nactivity and the erosion of self-esteem\nreally concerns me as well because you\nknow you need that not just for social\ninteraction but like look as a as a\nfather I want my children to grow up\nbeing confident about who they are being\nconfident enough to be authentic as they\nup in the world to not feel like they\nneed to create some brand that's\ndifferent from who they fundamentally\nare just to sell that to the world I\nwant them to know who they are and to be\ncomfortable being who they are and to\nencourage other people to do the same to\nsupport them in their efforts to be\nauthentic that's what I want my kids to\ndo that's not what's happening to a lot\nof kids on social media so I think we\nnot only need more kids to understand\nthis and to support them in their\nefforts to create space and sacred\nspaces away from social media but we\nneed to support parents here too cuz\nAndrew my big concern with parents is\nlook we've taken this technology which\nis rapidly\nevolving which we didn't grow up with as\nkids and we've told parents you manage\nit all on your own we put the entire\nburden on parents and kids to manage\nthis um you know when we were growing up\nyou remember the motor vehicle\nfatalities were really high uh in\nAmerica and we didn't say okay you know\nwhat that's just the price of Modern\nLife we just have to accept it and keep\nmoving on with our lives we said hold on\nwe don't have to go back to horses and\nBuggies but we also don't need to accept\nthis death rate we need to make this\nexperience safer and so we put in place\nwith the advocacy and support of\nincredible groups like Matt and others\nacross the country that me Mothers\nAgainst Drunk Driving ultimately the\ngovernment put in place safety standards\nthat got us seat belts airbags crash\ntesting to make sure the frame of cars\nwere robust in the setting of an\naccident and that help helped us reduce\nmotor vehicle accidents and deaths and\nthat's what we need here too like we\nneed to have the backs of parents and\nkids and that means from a policy\nperspective putting in place safety\nstandards to protect kids from exposure\nto harmful content from from the\nexperience of bullying and harassment\nand that also protect them from features\nthat would seek to manipulate them into\nexcessive use uh which is happening far\ntoo often right now we also need a\npolicy that requires data transparency\nfrom the company you know researchers\ntell us all the time that they these are\nindependent researchers they tell us\nthey are having a hard time getting full\naccess to the data from the social media\nplatforms about the full impact of the\nplatforms on the mental health of kids\nand as a parent look I I don't when we\nbought car seats for my children when\nwhen they were born we looked up the\nsafety data like many parents we wanted\nto make sure the car seats were safe but\nif you had told me that hey you know the\nmanufacturers of these car seats are\nactually not disclosing some of the the\ndata on the impact on children uh but go\nahead and buy it anyway you know I'm\nsure other people are buying these car\nseats you should be fine I would have\nbeen very disturbed by that right no\nparent wants to feel that information is\nbeing hidden from them about the health\nimpact of products on their kids that's\nwhat we have right now so this is a\nplace where I think while yes uh and we\nwe'll we should we'll talk about some\nsteps parents can take because I want to\nget to practical steps of people who are\nhere as parents or people have kids in\ntheir lives can\ntake but we we we need policy makers to\nstep up and step into the void here and\nto fill the Gap because this is too much\nagain to just ask parents to manage\nentirely on their own and this isn't\nagain about telling parents what to do\nand restricting them this is about\ngiving them the support they need so\nthey have confidence uh when they see uh\nyou know a technology out there a device\nout there a product out there for kids\nthat they know it's been tested that\nit's been studied and that it's actually\nsafe for their children my understanding\nis that in uh countries like China there\nare limit\nas to how many hours kids can be on\nscreens period And when I was a kid we\nwere allowed to watch TV for a certain\nnumber of I think it was a half an hour\nor an hour my mom was constantly kicking\nus out of the house like literally you\ngot to leave the house you got to go\ndown the street and play un fortunately\nI liked outdoor activities um nowadays\nwe also have the issue that a lot of\nparents are on their phones at soccer\ngames and at kids events and so the kids\nare modeling their parents yeah um\nparents are distracted as well so\nthere's a lack of social connection\npeople even an immediate family people\nare screened in um you know TV there's\nlaptops there's multiple phones iPads\npeople are you more engaged in the\nscreen portals than often than their own\nportals you go to a concert and people\nare watching the concert through their\nscreen so that they can send the same\nimage that everyone around them is\nsending out to the world if you think\nabout it's kind of crazy um but I guess\nthey want to capture that unique\nexperience but uh it's not unique at all\nthat's the that's the myth that's the\nillusion there's nothing unique about\nthe your post of something that you went\nto go see what would be truly unique is\nto just experience that in real time\nright it's so wild to think about like\nwhat we think of as our unique portal is\nactually not unique at all it's what we\ndo with it learn on my my stance is\nglean and learn information online then\ngo use it in real life come back from\ntime to time you know maybe an hour a\nday maximum or so can I just underscore\nthe two words you said real life because\nthat I think is a really important key\nhere which is that all of real life\nisn't happening on social media there's\na whole world out there which I think is\nreal life which is happening offline and\nwhat's happening online too often is\ndistorted right it's giving us like like\neven just take\num you know just take the images that\nthat we see of people their uh you know\ntheir summer beach images their like\ngreat vacation images that's not\nrepresentative of their entire life of\nhow they're living their life but we see\nthat we see people's anger we and their\nvital and we come to believe over time\nthat that's how people feel that's what\npeople are dealing with and experiencing\ntheir life and and we've just got to get\nyou your mom I love what your mom did\ngetting you guys outside um my parents\ndid the same thing too like we I was\nvery blessed to have two parents who\ndidn't come you know they didn't have a\nlot of resources growing up they didn't\ncome to this country with a lot of\nresources but the one of the greatest\ngifts they G gave us is that they loved\nus uncondition Al the other great gift\nthat they gave us is they pushed us to\njust explore to meet people to learn\nabout the world uh they wanted us\noutside playing you know experimenting\njust discovering the world you know\nriding our bike around the neighborhood\nand and that's what we did but right now\ntwo critical things that kids need for\ntheir mental health and development or\ntwo important forces I should say that\nare impacting their mental health and\ndevelopment one is social media but the\nsecond also is the lack of unstructured\nplate time uh that kids have like\nunstructured playtime is time when we as\nkids learn how to negotiate situations\nwith other kids how to resolve conflict\nhow to recognize what's going on in\nsomeone else's you know eyes before they\nsay something we learn how to\ncollaborate and play with other kids\nthis a lot you learn on the playground\nas it turns out but I worry that right\nnow that we've almost somehow made that\nkind of unstructured time seem\ninefficient you know we've set these\nstandards uh for our kids that they need\nto be uh you know getting fancy jobs and\ninto fancy colleges and making an x\namount of money and the path to doing\nthat is you know to be enrolled in X\nnumber of activities after school and to\ndo all this stuff in school and their\nlives are so hyper structured um that I\nworry that the time to just play to be\ncreative to reflect and think to just\nhave unstructured time with other kids\nhas evaporated and I think that that\nalso is hurting the mental health and\nwellbeing of our children I love the\nidea that that unstructured play time\ncould be framed in the accurate context\nof the nervous system developing the way\nit was supposed to develop I mean I\nwould argue that um success is going to\nbe easiest for children that engage in\nthe real world more in fact there's\ngreat risk to posting everything that\nyou do online we've seen some examples\nof that preventing people from getting\ninto or staying in college based on\nthings they said or did previously that\nthey shouldn't have said or done um\nthat's those are kind of you know\nnegative highlighted cases but in\ngeneral um we know that the the nervous\nsystem thrives on diversity of types of\ninteractions and social interactions in\nparticular I'm just restating what you\njust said so if ever there was a call\nfor kids to get out into non-screen life\nlet's call it um and engage uh their\nnervous system that way it without\nquestion is going to benefit them in\nterms of their ability to learn and\nretain information perform well in\nschool which is not everything life's\nabout but let's face it we still live in\na society where hitting those milestones\non a consistent basis are the best is\nthe best predictor of people being able\nto you know live self-sustained lives\nbuild families and that sort of thing so\num you mentioned a few actionable M uh\nitems for parents as it relates to kids\nmaybe well not maybe limits their screen\ntime force them outside in the safe\nweather and safe conditions of course\nbut uh what about adults as well I what\nwhat can we all do um should we be\nrestricting our screen time to X number\nof hours per today I mean you're the\nSurgeon General if you had a magic wand\nwhich I realize you don't um and you\ncould make a uh a highly informed\nrecommendation about what the thresholds\nfor too much uh time on social media are\num what would it be two hours three\nhours yeah it's it's a good question and\nlet me actually go through some of these\nthings that parents can can do for kids\nand that we can all do for ourselves\nwith kids in particular um what I would\ndo specifically with social media is and\nthis is this is frankly what I'm\nplanning to do with my wife for our kids\nas they grow up number one I would seek\nto delay the use of social media past\nMiddle School uh at at minimum and I\nknow that that is hard to do at a time\nwhere all kids are on social media and\nyou don't want your child to be the only\none left out and to be lonely as a\nresult so that means no account of their\nown means no account of their own okay\nand I would make see to the best of your\nability see if there are other parents\nthat you can partner with to do this\nbecause it's hard to do alone as a\nparent but it's also if there are other\nparents you're partnering with that\nmeans there other kids who are also\ndelaying you so that means your child is\nnot alone and I think if you start the\nconversation with other parents you'll\nrealize a lot of them are worried about\nthe same things you are they may have\nthought about delaying you but they also\ndon't want their kid to be the only one\nso this becomes a numbers challenge but\npartnership can help us if your child's\nalready on social media what I'd\nrecommend is to create sacred spaces in\ntheir lives that are technology free and\nspecifically I would think about the\nhour before bedtime and throughout the\nnight as time that you want to protect\nbecause kids are losing not just sleep\nbecause they're going to sleep later\nbecause they're on their devices but\nthey're also waking up in the middle of\nthe night maybe to use a bathroom maybe\nto get some water and then they get back\non their devices again so the quality of\ntheir sleep is being significantly\nimpacted by access to those devices\nduring the night so I would protect that\ntime hour before bed throughout the\nnight I would also create make sure meal\ntimes uh were Tech free zone so that\npeople actually that you talk to one\nanother you see one another and time\nwith friends and family members when\nyou're out you know at a birthday party\nEtc make that Tech free time let them\nfocus on their time with other people\nthose three Tech free zones can do a\nworld of good uh to help your child and\nthen the last thing I'd recommend here\nthe many things I think parents could do\nis to start a dialogue with your child\nabout their use of social media um we\ndon't always know how social media is\nmaking our kids feel uh from the and we\nmay realize when we talk to them that\nthey actually have their own concerns\nthey might say yeah it's not making me\nfeel really good but it's just like hard\nnot to be on it everyone's like texting\non this or everyone is uh you know\neveryone's you know sharing information\nand posting pictures on it I feel like I\nneed to be on it you can only help them\nstart to manage that if you know that\nthat's a challenge that they're having\nso opening a conversation so your child\nknows that you're not judging them but\nyou're trying to understand their\nexperience is important also so you can\nhelp them understand what is not\nacceptable for them to experience on\nsocial media if they're being harassed\nor bullied by strangers uh that is a\nproblem you want your child to to tell\nyou about that to report that um if they\nsee something posted online that's\nreally concerning to them let's say they\nsee a friend post that they're thinking\nof taking their own life or harming\nthemsel in another way you want them to\nknow that that's important to flag and\nto get help you know that they shouldn't\njust you know scroll past that so that\nconversation is really important and\nfinally as parents we can lead by\nexample right and this is hard because\nthe truth is we've been talking about\nsocial media and youth and that's what\nthe subject of my search and General's\nadvisory was on but I have concerns\nabout adults too I said as somebody\nwho's had challenges in my own use you\nknow of social media finding sometimes\nit bleeds you know past my bedtime and\nI'm realized you know I think m&a\nchecked something for 5 minutes an hour\nlater I'm still there you know scrolling\nthrough something uh and sometimes I you\nknow you know I find myself over the\nyears I found myself comparing myself\nalso to posts I see online and unhealthy\nways sometimes I find myself um sort of\npulled into uh content uh that uh you\nknow ends up being angry and vitriolic\nand leaves me feeling worse you know at\nthe end so I've experienced this as well\nand I think as parents one of the\nhardest things to do is to follow this\nadvice we're giving our kids to draw\nthose boundaries as well and to put our\ndevices away when we're around our kids\nuh one experience I had which sort of I\nstill feel bad about but which really\nhelped kind of knock some sense into me\nwas after my my son was born uh my older\nchild I was actually I was search in\ngeneral at that time you know I had you\nknow it was lot going on it was busy job\nEtc but I wanted to make sure that I\nprotected bed times uh and meal times\nfor us to be together as a family yet\none day when I came home you know after\ndinner when we were doing the bathtime\nand bedtime routine getting my son ready\nuh for the night uh my wife was changing\ning his diaper and instead of helping I\nwas just standing at the side scrolling\nthrough my inbox and my wife who has\ninfinite patience and is like one of the\nmost well adjusted people that I know\njust paused and she turned to me and\nAlice said do you really need to be\ndoing that right\nnow and she said just very quietly but I\nfelt this like such a sense of Shame\nwhen she did that because I was like\nwhat am I doing like this is my infant\nchild you know and the rare few hours I\nhave with them during the day and I'm\njust scrolling through my inbox in my\nphone like like this is terrible and\nlook I know that all of us do this it\nmaybe in different contexts but it was a\nwake up moment for me because I realized\nlike one like as you know well as a\nneuroscientist we can't really multitask\nright we're rapidly task switching right\nand that was time in my when I head was\nin my inbox and my head wasn't with him\nyou know and my heart wasn't with him\nright and I was just distracted and so\nas parents if we can honor those sacred\ntimes you know when we're with our\nchildren to keep our devices away meal\ntimes sleep time as well it's not easy\nto do but it really sets a good example\nfor our kids um all Behavior change that\nwe're talking about here the kind of\nbehavior change I've worked with with\npatients over the years are physical\nactivity and diet all of this is harder\nto do when we're doing it by ourself\nit's a lot easier to do do when we're we\nhave a couple of friends or family\nmembers who we agree to do this with we\nhold each other accountable we encourage\nand support each other um it's how I've\nbeen able to make the most successful\nBehavior changes I've made in my life\nhave come about because I have two good\nbuddies uh Dave and sunny who are my my\npart of my brotherhood and the three of\nus as brothers talk about health we talk\nabout our finances we talk about our\nfamily and our friendships and our\nfailings and we help keep each other\naccountable and so I would just\nencourage parents like is this sounds\ndaunting or overwhelming you don't have\nto do this alone think about one or two\npeople other parents who you might want\nto do this with and I guarantee you\nthere a lot of us are struggling with\nthe same stuff and they would probably\nwelcome an opportunity to do this in\ncollaboration with another parent such\nspectacular advice that I hope everyone\nwill follow not just for their kids but\nfor themselves I think that whether or\nnot social media is addictive in the in\nthe true sense of the word is is kind of\nmeaningless debate at this point it's at\nthe very least a compulsive behavior for\nmany of us and as you described it in\nexample you gave it becomes reflexive\nyes we're just you know we're not\nnecessarily seeking pleasure or looking\nto to engage in online battles it's just\nit's become reflexive sort of like\nfinding yourself with your hand in the\nrefrigerator just you even think about\nit you're just doing it so becoming more\nconscious of the use uh and thereby more\nconscious of the value of putting away\nthe screens and social media for\nextended periods of time each day and\ncertainly in the middle of the night\nfolks neuroplasticity brain rewiring\nhappens in the middle of the night while\nyou're asleep and I this when you\nmentioned kids awake in the middle of\nthe night looking at their phone I just\nI saw you Flinch oh my goodness it pains\nme and I've looked at my phone in the\nmiddle of the night I try not to but um\nbut I'm certainly not in the window of\nMaximum plasticity either it's terrible\nfor everybody but especially terrible\nfor kids um what you just provided is an\nincredible\nlet's just call it a I'll call it a\nmandate you didn't say it but a\nsuggestion of of teaming up with people\num to become more like-minded around\nthese issues and to really promote\nhealth I along those lines I I really\nwant to thank you um first of all for\nthe conversation today you're incredibly\nbusy you're responsible for uh an entire\ncountry is worth of um people so to take\ntime to sit down with me and to discuss\nthese topics for our audience is it\nincredible\nappreciated by me and and and by them I\nI feel comfortable extending their\ngratitude here and uh it's also clear\nbased on today's conversation that you\nface an enormous number of challenges at\nthe level of budgetary challenges by the\nway I'm going to work on that um it's\nhard to shut me up um as well as the the\nhuge array of of issues that you\nconfront and um and it's clear that it's\na challenge that you've embraced for\nmany years now under difficult\nconditions and that you're clearly\nwilling to get out and talk to people\nand hear their criticism hear their\nconcerns hear um and learn from them and\nso it's been of great benefit to us to\nhear and learn from you and I hope this\nwon't be the the last of our\nconversations there's many more topics\nto cover but I just really want to thank\nyou thanks ever so much for the the the\nintellectual power uh and the emotional\npower that you put into what you do cuz\nthat is very clear you're a physician\nfirst and you care about your patients\nand your patients are all of us so thank\nyou so much Andrew that's for me just\nincredibly kind of you I thank you I\nappreciate that and I've loved our\nconversation and you know for me what\nwhat I hope most of all\nfor my kids for our country more broadly\nis\nthat is that we can go deeper like\nbeneath this these surface issues I I\nworry that we find\nourselves disagreeing about and fighting\nabout online and recognize that there is\na deeper challenge that we are facing\nthat I think underlies a lot of uh\nthese the anger and the vitrio and this\nissue around how disconnected we become\nfrom one another I think is at the heart\nof that I don't think that there's any\npolicy or program we can Implement\nthat's going to ultimately fix what Al\nSociety without fundamentally realizing\nthat a lot of this is a\nmanifestation of a society that has\nbecome more disconnected and More\ndisinvested in one another like over\ntime and that's just not who we are it's\nnot how we evolved over thousands of\nyears it's not how we're going to thrive\nin the future so I know that sometimes\nwhen you look at these big intractable\nproblems uh like widespread loneliness\nin the United States that it can seem\nlike hard to address these but I do want\nto encourage everyone to to recognize\nthat when it comes to human connection\nthat it is small steps that can make a\nbig difference because we are hardwired\nto connect as human beings and if you if\nyou just pause for a moment and if you\njust think for a moment in your own life\nabout someone who has been there for you\nduring a time of great need somebody who\nhas stood up for you and you couldn't\nstand up for yourself someone who's\nhelped to remind you of why you're still\na good person why you still have worth\nand value to add to the world even when\nyou had lost faith in\nyourself you think about their faith in\nyou about their support for you about\ntheir love for you think about how\nhealing that\nwas that's the power that we have to\nhelp each other\nheal we are going through an identity\ncrisis in many ways as a country where I\nthink we need to ask ourselves who are\nwe like what defines who we are what are\nthe set of values that we want to guide\nus in our life to guide our\ncountry and I know that it feels like\nWe're a nation of people who are mean\nwho only care about ourselves who are\nthrowing blame and anger at each other\nall the time who are pessimistic about\nthe future but I actually don't think\nthat's really who we are I think at our\nheart we are hopeful and optimistic\npeople I think in our true nature we are\nkind and generous to one another\num in our hearts we we we're\ninterdependent creatures who recognize\nthat if someone else is suffering we\nwant to be out there to support them uh\nand who want to want people to be there\nto support us as well that's who who we\nreally are but we have to to make a\nClear Choice here about our identity you\nknow as as individuals and as a country\nand recognize that that choice has real\nimplications for everything else that\nwe're talking about here that's the\nfoundation and when I think about my own\nkids growing up like like many parents I\nworry about the world uh that that\nthey're coming into um I I worry that\nthey're going to use the wrong word even\nthough their intentions are right and\npeople are going to blame them or cast\nthem out you know I worry that they're\ngoing to stumble and fall down and\npeople are just going to keep walking by\nnot caring you know because everyone's\nliving their own life I worried that\nthey might become someone who does the\nsame thing to other people right none of\nwhich I want but I want for all of our\nkids is for them to grow up in a society\nwhere we care about one another we have\neach other's backs we recognize as that\nold African proverb goes that we can go\nfast if we go alone but if we really\nwant to go far we go together and that's\nwhat I want for my kids in our country\nbut that's what we each have the power\nto create in our own lives it starts\nwith the decisions we make but how we\ntreat one another do we for example\nreach out for 5 minutes a day to someone\nthat we care about do we pick up the\nphone and call them to say hey I'm\nthinking about you we can all do that\ntoday do we give people the benefit of\nour full attention recognizing that\nwhile time is scarce our attention has\nthe ability to stretch time it can make\nfive minutes feel like half an hour but\nit's a hard thing for people to get\nbecause they're distracted by their\ndevices but do we give people the\nbenefit of our full attention and do we\nlook for ways to serve one another\nrecognizing that it's through our acts\nof service that we actually Forge\npowerful con actions but we also remind\nourselves how much value we have to\nbring to the world and this is important\nin a time when the self-esteem of so\nmany of us and our young people in\nparticular is being eroded uh\nparticularly by their use of social\nmedia so these are the steps that we can\ntake to build Connection in our life but\nthe core values I believe that have to\nbe at the heart of our identity these\nvalues around kindness and generosity\naround courage and\nservice these also have to animate the\ndecision decisions that we make in our\nlife about programs we advocate for the\npolicies we support the leaders we\nchoose they should all be reflections of\nthe values that we want to see in our\nchildren and in society more broadly\nbecause I'll tell you that 90% plus of\nthe decisions leaders make they make\nbehind closed doors and what's guiding\nthem in those moments are their values\nthat's true whether you're the leader of\na company uh or a nonprofit organization\nuh or a leader in government so those\nvalues matter and I want us as a country\nto speak more about the values that we\nchoose about the identity uh that we\nwant to Anchor ourselves to um that's\nthe way in which I feel like America can\nbe an even greater Beacon uh of Hope for\nthe world because the world is\nstruggling with this too we're not the\nonly ones who are dealing with\nloneliness and isolation who are seeing\nanger uh and resentment and vitri all\nbubble up uh at extraordinary levels\nwe're seeing mistrust in institutions\nsoore\nU many countries are experiencing this I\nwould love America to lead the way in\nsome ways in showing what it's like to\nembrace a more human identity that's\ncentered around kindness and service and\nfriendship uh and generosity like to me\nall of these values ultimately Andrew\nstem from love right love is our\ngreatest source of power it's our\ngreatest source of healing uh I say that\nas a Doctor Who's prescribed many\nmedicines over the years but there few\nthings more powerful\nuh then love and its ability to help us\nthrough difficult times and help mend\nthe wounds seen and unseen uh that we\nall carry with us and I think if we\nrecognize that we recognize that you\nknow we don't have to have an MD after\nour name uh or have gone to nursing\nschool to be healers we all have the\npower to help each other heal like\nAndrew we are not fundamentally a nation\nof bystanders who just stand by while\nother people suffer like We're a nation\nof of healers and hop makers who can\nrestore hope that the future can be\nbetter who can create a better life for\nourselves and the people around us right\nnow it's what we're capable of it's what\nwe're built for that's the identity that\nI think we now more than ever need to\nembrace\namen and thank you for that um I agree\nlove is definitely the verb that can get\nus where we need to go thank you so much\nfor your words for your um
