    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: [Music Playing] Welcome to the Huberman Lab\nGuest Series, where I and an expert\nguest discuss  science and science\nbased tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor\nof Neurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday marks the third episode\nin our four episode series\nabout mental health with Dr.\nPaul Conti.\nToday's episode deals with the topic\nof healthy relationships, how to\ndefine what a healthy relationship\nis, and how to achieve healthy\nrelationships of all kinds, including\nromantic relationships, interpersonal\nrelationships at work, friendships with\nfamily, and of course, with oneself.\nThis episode builds on the framework\nof the psychology of self and mental\nhealth that was established in the first\nand second episodes of this series.\nHowever, even if you didn't listen to\nthe first or second episode in this\nseries, today's episode will still\ncontain a lot of information and\nprotocols that you will find valuable\nfor improving your relationships.\nThat said, if you have the opportunity to\nlisten to the first and second episodes in\nthis series, I think you'll find those to\nbe tremendously beneficial at any point.\nDuring today's episode, Dr.\nConti discusses what makes for\na successful relationship of\nany kind, as well as tools to\nimprove those relationships.\nHe discusses various types of bonds,\nincluding healthy bonds and trauma\nbonds, not just in the context of\nromantic relationship, but in the\ncontext of all types of relationships.\nWe also discuss different challenges\nthat people face in relationships,\nincluding abusive relationships, and\nwe discuss the role of power dynamics,\nanxiety, and boundaries in relationships,\nboth from the perspective of unhealthy\nrelationships, but more importantly\nfrom the understanding and protocols\nto cultivate healthy relationships.\nWhile there is an abundance of opinions\nand information out there on the Internet\nthese days about relationships both\nhealthy and unhealthy, today's discussion\napproaches the topic of relationships\nthrough an entirely different lens, which\nis the lens of the self in terms of one's\nconscious and subconscious mind, and how\nmultiple conscious and subconscious minds\nthrough different individuals, interact\nwith one another in ways that we can see\nand ways that we can't see, and all of\nthat framed within the actionable steps\nthat any of us can take to improve our\nrelationship to ourself and to others.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is BetterHelp.\nBetterHelp offers professional\ntherapy with a licensed\ntherapist, carried out all online.\nI've been doing therapy\nfor more than 30 years.\nWhile I confess that initially I was\nforced to do that therapy as a condition\nfor being let back into high school,\nover time I learned that therapy is\na tremendously valuable practice.\nIn fact, I consider doing regular\nweekly therapy just as important\nas doing regular physical exercise\nin order to improve one's health.\nThe beauty of BetterHelp is that it\nmakes it extremely easy to find a\ntherapist that's excellent for you.\nAnd we can define an excellent\ntherapist as somebody who's going to\ngive you a lot of support, but in an\nobjective way as well as somebody with\nwhom you can have excellent rapport,\na nd that can help you arrive at\npositively transformative insights\nthat you wouldn't have otherwise had.\nAnd with BetterHelp, they make\nit convenient so that it's\nmatched to your schedule and\nthe other aspects of your life.\nIf you'd like to try BetterHelp,\ngo to betterhelp.com/huberman,\nto get 10% off your first month.\nAgain, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Waking Up.\nWaking Up is a meditation app that\noffers dozens of guided meditation\nsessions, mindfulness trainings,\nYoga Nidra sessions, and more.\nBy now, there's an abundance of data\nshowing that even short daily meditations\ncan greatly improve our mood, reduce\nanxiety, improve our ability to\nfocus, and can improve our memory.\nAnd while there are many different\nforms of meditation, most people\nfind it difficult to find and stick\nto a meditation practice in a way\nthat is most beneficial for them.\nThe Waking Up app makes it extremely\neasy to learn how to meditate and\nto carry out your daily meditation\npractice in a way that's going to be\nmost effective and efficient for you.\nIt includes a variety of different types\nof meditations of different duration,\nas well as things like Yoga Nidra, which\nplace the brain and body into a sort of\npseudosleep that allows you to emerge\nfeeling incredibly mentally refreshed.\nIn fact, the science around Yoga Nidra is\nreally impressive, showing that after a\nYoga Nidra session, levels of dopamine in\ncertain areas of the brain are enhanced\nby up to 60%, which places the brain and\nbody into a state of enhanced readiness\nfor mental work and for physical work.\nAnother thing I really like about\nthe Waking Up app is that it provides\na 30 day introduction course.\nSo for those of you that have not\nmeditated before or getting back to a\nmeditation practice, that's fantastic.\nOr, if you're somebody who's already a\nskilled and regular meditator, Waking\nUp has more advanced meditations and\nYoga Nidra sessions for you as well.\nIf you'd like to try the Waking Up app,\nyou can go to wakingup.com/huberman\nand access a free 30 day trial.\nAgain, that's wakingup.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nabout mental health with Dr.\nPaul Conti.\nDr.\nConti, welcome back.\nPaul Conti: Thank you.\nHappy to be here.\nAndrew Huberman: Today we're going to\ndiscuss relationships, and that will\noften focus on romantic relationships,\nbut also relationships between friends,\nbetween family members, and inevitably,\nthe relationship to self, which is what\nwe really focused on in episodes one\nand two of this series, episode one\nbeing all the things that go into a\nhealthy self and how to understand what\nis unhealthy and healthy in all of us\nand make adjustments to the unhealthy\naspects of our unconscious and conscious\nthrough really specific proactive\nbehaviors and patterns of thought.\nSo really a roadmap to these\nideals that we call mental health\nand understanding of the self.\nToday we want to talk about\nrelationships from the perspective\nof, of course, how people relate.\nBut I have a feeling it's going to have\nsomething to do with, or perhaps almost\neverything to do with our relationship,\nto understanding ourselves first.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: So, just to make\nsure that we're all on the same page,\nregardless of whether or not people\nhave seen episodes one and two, and\ncertainly people do not need to have\nseen or listened to episodes one and two\nof this series in order to understand\ntoday's discussion, could you please\ntell us what is a healthy person?\nAnd how can we ask ourselves the sorts\nof questions that allow us to determine\nwhether or not we are healthy and where\nto look in terms of making adjustments\nif we want to be healthier than we\nalready are, which I have to believe\nalmost everybody, if not everybody,\ncertainly wants to be the healthiest\nand best expression of themselves\nso that they can do the most for\nthemselves and for others in the world?\nPaul Conti: So, the linchpin of it all,\nis the agency and gratitude as verbs.\nThat's the top of the mountain.\nThere's a lot of climbing we do\nto get to the top of the mountain.\nOnce we're over the top of the mountain,\nthen things are in a better place.\nAnd even though there are two words,\nagency is, of course, a word, g\nratitude is a word, b ut it doesn't\nmean that they're separate concepts.\nApproaching the world through the lens\nof agency and gratitude, thought of as\none thing because they come together\nand they come together as verbs.\nThat's what we're aiming for, because\nthat's the thing that we can work towards.\nIf you think about what comes\nunderneath that, it takes us back to\nthe two pillars and the 10 cupboards.\nAnd if we're looking in there enough,\nwe're mInding, like what is in my\nunconscious mind I might not be aware of.\nLet me generate some curiosity\nabout my defense mechanisms and\nmy character structure and think\nabout what's salient inside of me.\nIf we're doing all of that, then\nwhat we're doing, we're building\nempowerment, we're building humility.\nAnd then ultimately, the expression\nof all of that is the agency and\ngratitude, and it's something\nthat we can't have enough of.\nLike I say, what's the\nbest amount of that?\nThe most that's possible, right?\nBecause we're going to engage in\nthe world in the healthiest way.\nBecause agency and gratitude doesn't mean\nlike, we're happy about everything, right?\nIf there's something negative\nand we can change that, then\nwe don't feel happy about that.\nThe sense of gratitude in me\nmakes me more likely to feel\nthat I can change that, right?\nOr to take the chance of\ntrying to change that.\nAnd then the agency part of that\nconcept can come more to the\nfore and I can make the change.\nSo it's not about bliss, it's not\nabout forgiving self and others\nfor all sorts of things and not\nworking to make things better.\nIt's about being in the world and\nbeing as aware as I can possibly\nbe, including being aware that\nthere are things I'm not aware of.\nSo sort of having a healthy respect and an\norientation to the world that values truth\nand values understanding and exploration.\nIf we do all of that, then we\nreach the top of the mountain\nthrough the agency and gratitude.\nAnd then what builds upon that or\nwhat comes from that is the peace,\nthe contentment, the delight, the\ngenerative drive being strengthened\nlike that all comes together.\nAnd then the aggressive, or we\nsay aggressive because that's\nthe traditional term, b ut the\naggressive or the assertive.\nThe assertiveness or assertion drive,\nhowever, whatever word we want to put\nto that, that drive exists in us in a\nway that subserves the generative drive.\nThe same thing with the\npleasure drive in us.\nIt exists in us, but it's\nsubserving the generative drive.\nAnd then all those good things come\ntogether and they come together\nto help us be as healthy as we can\nand to stay healthy, including when\ntribulation or difficulties come our\nway, so that we stay as best we can\nin the agency and gratitude as verbs.\nAnd again, there's nothing\ntheoretical about this.\nIt's a way to live, and there are a lot\nof people who live some of their lives,\nor parts of their lives through that.\nAnd we can aspire to it and we can work\ntowards it, and if we're the best that\nwe can be, then we're going to be in\nour relationships the best we can be.\nThink about it, like, you and I\nhave a relationship, we know each\nother, w e're working together.\nIf I can bring my best self to\nyou, to thinking about you, to\nunderstanding you, if I can bring\nthe agency and the gratitude,\nthen I'm going to do right by you.\nI'm going to mentalize this\nidea of thinking about what's\ngoing on inside of you.\nI'm going to bring the\nbest o f all of that.\nAnd then, because we have a\nrelationship, t here's also an \"us.\"\nThere's a me, there's a you, there's\nsomething that happens between us.\nThat's the relationship, that's the \"us.\"\nAnd I will also bring my best self\nto that thing that is no longer just\nme or just you, but that is an us.\nAnd that applies to all relationships.\nYou can apply that to seeking health in\nevery single relationship in our lives.\nAndrew Huberman: What you're saying\nreally speaks to the importance of\npeople taking a real look at themselves,\nwhich is not necessarily an inventory\nof self in the typical sense that we're\nused to hearing it, but rather through\nthis lens or map of the self that was\nspelled out in episodes one and two.\nAnd again, for those that are\njust joining the series now, the\nmap, as we're referring to it,\nis available as a downloadable\nPDF in the show note captions.\nIf people want to get that,\nit's completely zero cost.\nYou can just go there and access\nit, or just view it on a screen,\nprint it out, whatever you like.\nYou certainly don't need to do that,\nbecause here again, we're talking about\nthe core elements of that map, which,\nif I understand correctly, arrive\neventually at a set of verb states that\nwe're calling agency and gratitude.\nThose are not separate, as you\npointed out, they work together.\nPaul Conti: You described it as\non top of the geyser, r ight?\nAnd I really like that there's a\nlot of things going on, but then\nit all uplifts to something, right?\nAnd if we're doing it in the right way,\nin the diligent way, then i t is like\na geyser, a nd what it's lifting up on\ntop of it is the agency and gratitude.\nI love that you put those\nwords to i t, and I think it\ncaptures it really profoundly.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, the stuff that\ngeysers up perhaps deserves a bit of\nour attention just for a few moments.\nYou describe these two pillars\nthat I described as geysering up\ninto agency and gratitude in the\nbest circumstances, but in the best\ncircumstances, we want to remind\nourselves and everybody, are attainable\nby looking at what's in those pillars.\nThose two pillars are\nthe structure of self.\nSo really understanding something\nabout the structure of self.\nSo that includes some understanding of\nthe unconscious mind, some understanding\nof the conscious mind, defense\nmechanisms, character structure and self.\nThat was all reviewed and described\nin episodes one and two, as well\nas the functions of self, which\nare more of the verb states, the\nexpressions of the structure of self.\nSelf-awareness being the first of\nthose defense mechanisms in action.\nAnd here I'd be remiss if I didn't tell\nmyself and everybody else again that\ndefense mechanisms are not always bad.\nThere can be healthy defense mechanisms.\nPaul Conti: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: They can\nprotect us in very valuable ways.\nAnd then this notion of salience,\nwhat we pay attention to, what\nsorts of scripts are going on in\nour head about ourselves and others,\nwhat are we paying attention to?\nHow are we interpreting those in our\nhead and to others, and then most\nimportantly, perhaps to ourselves?\nAnd then our actual behaviors, like what\nwe are doing from the time we wake up\nuntil the time we go to sleep at night,\nand then our strivings, our sense of\nhopefulness, or perhaps lack of strivings.\nAnd there I am reminded also\nthat nobody does all of these\nthings perfectly all the time.\nWe all have elements within us that\nperhaps are not serving to geyser up\ninto agency and gratitude as well as\nthey could, but that all of us have the\ncapacity to look at these two pillars\nand these 10 things that were just listed\noff, as you describe them, as cupboards\nthat we look into and examine and think\nabout, and that if we can do that with a\nskilled clinician like yourself or another\npsychiatrist or psychologist, terrific.\nBut even if we don't have access\nto that, we can examine within\nus what is and is not serving to\ngeyser up into agency and gratitude.\nPaul Conti: We can bring any issue\nof self to those two pillars and\nthe 10 cupboards within them.\nAny issue of self.\nWhy?\nBecause that's what it is, in\nthe s ense that it is the \"us.\"\nWhat's inside of me.\nI have an unconscious mind, I have a\nconscious mind, I have a defensive s\ntructure, I have a character structure,\nI h ave a self, that's what it is.\nAnd all the functions that you\nmentioned, they're all going on\nwithin that structure of self.\nThey're manifesting themselves.\nThat's what it is w hen we're being,\nin the active way of the verb being.\nThat's what it is, which is why\nw e can bring to it any issue\nof self, even though, of course,\nthere's tremendous complexity there.\nThe million things that go on in a\nsecond underneath the surface in the\nunconscious mind and our defensive\nstructures and how to see them.\nBut we're human beings.\nWe're complicated, right?\nThat's okay, because we have methods\nof understanding, we have methods\nof inquiry, and we can use those\nmethods to make things better.\nAnd that's how we make the\ngeyser as strong as it can be.\nWhere maybe some of the water is\nrunning countercurrent in the...\nokay, well, let's try and have\nthings go all in the same direction.\nBut we don't need things to be perfect\nfor the geyser to spring up and the agency\nand gratitude to then be uplifted upon it.\nAndrew Huberman: So everybody has\none of these maps, as I understand\nit, and therefore anytime we're\ntalking about relationships, romantic\nrelationships or otherwise, we're\ntalking about the intersection or\noverlap of those maps in some way,\nmaybe even the synergy and the outgrowth\nof those maps becomes its own map.\nI think we'll get to\nthis a little bit later.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: When I and most\npeople hear the word relationships, in\nparticular romantic relationships, I\nmake a couple of automatic assumptions.\nFirst of all, I have to assume\nthat people are either in a\nrelationship or out of a relationship.\nThere's probably a third category out\nthere of plurals and other things,\nbut we'll keep it relatively simple.\nAnd most people, I assume, when they\nsearch for or enter, or entered a\nrelationship, they thought about whether\nor not they had resonance with the\nperson, whether or not there was an\nintellectual or mutual interest resonance\nor a physical resonance, maybe something\nabout family history, common goals, etc.\nThat's typically what people think about.\nAnd then perhaps if people will have a bit\nmore of a psychological understanding, or\nthey're reading some pop psychology books\nthese days, some of which are pretty good,\nthey might understand something about\nthemselves or the other person being a\nbit more anxious or a bit more relaxed.\nSo you'll hear things like\nanxious, attached, secure,\nattached, things of that sort.\nIf we could just step back from all\nof that for a moment and examine it\nthrough the lens of the maps as you're\ndescribing them, which exist in all of us.\nAnd that really are the map to\nbeing the best version of ourselves.\nIf we look at relationships in terms\nof lists of where people went to\nschool, if they went to school, are\ntheir parents married or divorced?\nDo they have trauma that they're aware of\nor not aware of these kinds of things, I\nguess we could call those, and here I'm\nborrowing language that you used earlier\noff-camera, so I want to acknowledge that.\nPoints of compatibility,\nI think that seems like a\nreasonable place to start, right?\nDo people want the same thing?\nSo if you could, could you talk a\nlittle bit about points of compatibility\nin a relationship and how those\nshow up, for better or for worse?\nWhen you encounter people in the clinical\nsetting, when you see somebody who's in\na relationship that's really working for\nthem and is healthy versus if they're in a\nrelationship where it's really unhealthy,\npresumably there's some knowledge about\npoints of compatibility, but I'm guessing\nthat's not always intuitive, right?\nPaul Conti: I think the place we\nstart there is acknowledging what\nwe can know and what we can't know.\nSo this idea that there are levels o\nf emergence where things at a lower\nlevel come together and create something\nthat's new, we see this throughout\nscience, from subatomic particles\nall the way through to culture.\nSo someone could know theoretically,\nlots and lots and lots about you\nand lots and lots and lots about me,\nbut they don't know about us, right?\nThey don't know how we interact.\nThey don't know if we have shared\ninterests, what we talk about.\nThey don't know that.\nNo one knows that.\nWe don't know that about\nthe combination of people.\nWe can't know it in advance, but\nwe often believe that we can, which\nthen leads to a lot of false metrics\nof trying to figure things out.\nSo when we're looking for compatibility,\nthe thought will be just very basic,\ntangible things, like in romance,\nfor example, if there's someone who\nabsolutely wants to have a family\nand there's someone who absolutely\ndoes not want to have a family, okay,\nthat would be a reason for those two\npeople to not choose one another.\nSo there are these factors, but\nthe factors are all, in a sense,\nvery evident and very concrete.\nIf we go beyond that, we say,\nokay, we can see the obvious.\nThen what we're looking for is really\na compatibility of generative drives.\nAnd then that tells you, can\nthese people then get along?\nMaybe one of them is from one s ide of\nthe world and the other i s from the\nother side of the world, or one's an\naccountant and the other is a musician.\nAnd it doesn't mean that they're built not\nto get along or that if they're doing the\nsame thing they're built to get along, or\nif they went to college in the same place,\nor they went to college versus not going\nto college, there's so much there that we\ntry to build a story on, and then what we\ndo is we miss the forest for the trees.\nAnd the trees, I think, are\nthe factors that don't matter.\nSo again, let's think about\nthe factors that do matter.\nPerson wants to have a family,\nthe other person doesn't.\nThat's relevant.\nBut the trees that mislead us might be,\ndo they have the same level of education?\nDo they have the same\nfamily structure growing up?\nAre parents still together?\nWhat do they enjoy?\nAre they creative or\nscientific or whatever?\nOr creatively scientific.\nWe could look at all of that,\nbut I think then we're making a\nbunch of trees that mislead us.\nIf you say, look, do these people come\nat the world through how much agency\nand gratitude is there guiding them?\nHow high is the top of that geyser?\nHow high is it uplifting that?\nHow strong is the generative drive?\nIf we match people upon that,\nthen we see, oh, those people got\nalong and those people didn't.\nAnd then there are all the other factors,\nlike pheromones, a nd things that we can't\nunderstand or reflexive first impressions.\nWe could let things develop, honoring\nthe truth of what we can't know.\nThat when you put two people\ntogether, you get something that's\ndifferent from the sum of both people.\nIt's not an overlap of maps, i t's a\nnew map, a nd the map is informed by\nthings that are on each individual's map.\nBut what we're looking for are maps that\ndon't have very significant differences\naround just clear, concrete things.\nBut once we get beyond that, the maps can\nsynergize in all sorts of beautiful and\nunpredictable ways, and if both are coming\nfrom the perspective of a generative\ndrive that is at the forefront, great.\nYou put those maps together\nand see what happens.\nMaybe nothing happens.\nOkay.\nThose people don't go\nout on a second date.\nMaybe something happens, but it\ndoesn't develop in certain ways.\nOkay, those people dated\nand stopped dating.\nLike, this happens all the time, r ight?\nBut we set the odds in our favor that\nthe generative drive in each that is\nat the forefront means that their maps\ncan synergize in ways that can then be\nbeautiful and ways that can maybe bring\nto both people that which they want.\nAnd I think there's a simplicity\nto that, that I think if we honor\nit can be very, very helpful.\nWhether it's romance, it's friendships,\nof looking at what the truth of it\nis instead of the factors that we try\nand gain a false sense of security\nif we're using them to select upon.\nAndrew Huberman: You mentioned several\ntimes the generative drive, and I\ndefinitely would like to learn more\nabout that and spend some time there\nin the context of relationships.\nBut just to drill a little bit\nfurther into what we've all heard\nso often, and you touched upon a\nfew of these themes around points of\ncompatibility, but also where sometimes\nwe can respond to the wrong things\nwhen thinking about compatibility.\nAgain, we're framing this mainly\nin the context of hypothetical\nromantic relationships, but certainly\nit pertains to other sorts of\nrelationships, things like, is one\nperson educated with an advanced\ndegree, and is the other person also?\nWe tend to assume that people\nwho are, are somehow a better\nmatch than people who aren't.\nThat's sort of an implicit assumption\nthat's often made, not always.\nOr that if two people really love music,\nthat they will enjoy music together,\nand therefore the sum of the whole\nis greater than either of its parts.\nPaul Conti: And I think those\nthings are utterly irrelevant.\nAndrew Huberman: Interesting, and I want\nto hear more about this because I think\nthat if you think about, which I'm sure\nyou don't, but, like dating apps, for\ninstance, like what's listed out there\nor first or second dates, which consists\nof learning a little bit about somebody\nand what they're doing and maybe even a\nlittle bit about their history and maybe\nan activity and certainly an intentional\nawareness to how the other person is\nbehaving in the context of different\nthings, like a waiter or a waitress and\nhow they're treating people, and you.\nAnd then you hear about things like...\nthis is not something I'm familiar with...\noh, right, the love languages.\nPeople are like, oh,\nwhat's their love language?\nIt's like gifts or, like acts of physical\ntouch or acts of service or something.\nI met someone recently, and she told me\nmy love language is all of them, which I\nthink is the most honest answer, right?\nBecause, sure, there's probably some\nweighting around what people value\nmore or less, and in the absence\nof the things they value the most,\nit would probably feel a bit like\ndeprivation in any relationship.\nBut as I'm describing all\nthis, I'm realizing more and\nmore, yes, all of that matters.\nAnxious, attached, secure,\nattached, love languages, etc.\nBut it really doesn't get\nto the heart of the matter.\nIt really doesn't get to this, as\nyou're describing it, this generative\ndrive in individuals, and whether\nor not those match up well along\nthe points of compatibility with\nthe other person's generative drive.\nAnd I haven't run a controlled study\nfor this, but the best evidence I have\nis that there, fortunately, are many\npeople out there who are in happy,\nhealthy relationships, but there\nare many, many people who are not,\neither because they can't find them,\nor they're in them and they're not\nhealthy, or they're not happy, etc.\nSo if you could elaborate a bit\nmore on the generative drive, again\nreminding us what the nature of that is.\nWe covered this a bit in episodes\none and two, but what the nature\nof that is and some different ways\nthat that's expressed and how that\nshows up in healthy relationship.\nPaul Conti: Yeah, I think we really\ndisprove the idea that some of\nthese factors that I think are\nsuperficial in the context o f whether\npeople are going to be compatible.\nThey're not superficial things,\nbut they're not germane.\nSo let's say you think about music,\nand say two people are contemplating\nromance, and they both really like music.\nW ell, that could go very, very well.\nLet's say they both have\na strong generative drive.\nThose pillars are pretty healthy,\nand the geyser of the agency and\ngratitude is riding upon it, and\nthey can find peace in themselves.\nThey're strongly generative, then\nthey could become interested in\nthe music the other person likes.\nThere's not going to\nbe a complete overlap.\nEven if people generally\nlike the same thing.\nBut let's say they like different things,\nlike just liking music, or even liking\nthe same music, there's still difference.\nSo the person has to go beyond themselves,\nand say, okay, I'm interested in what you\nthink, even about the music we both like.\nWhat factors do you like?\nThere are places of learning\nand of growth for both.\nAnd you could see how both liking music,\nwhether it's the same or different\nmusic, that sounds great, right?\nBut you could also see how\nthat could not be great.\nIf the generative drive is too low\nand the aggression drive is too\nhigh, then I'm going to think, I like\nmusic, my music is better than yours.\nPeople then start, they'll fragment,\neven though they have the same interest.\nOr if the pleasure drive is too high,\nthen they think, I want to listen to\nmy music, not yours, I'm familiar with\nit, instead of, hey, I'm interested in\nthat music because you're interested\nin it, and I'm interested in you.\nWhich leads us to the second part.\nLet's say you have someone who really has\nno interest in music and someone who does.\nWell, there can be an openness of saying,\nif I'm interested in this person and\nthis person is really interested in\nmusic, I have some interest in it, right?\nI want to learn something about it.\nI want to experience some\nof it with the other person.\nAnd let's say that person then\nfinds, hey, that's not my thing.\nIt's not the thing we connect\non, then, why would that be\nthe end o f the world, right?\nP lenty of people, one person goes\nto concerts, the other doesn't.\nSo we try to find these points of\ncommonality, because I think we\nget over reductionist, and then\nwe think, oh, here's a bunch of\nfactors that we will identify.\nAnd what they do is they obscure us\nfrom the primary factor, which is the\ngenerative drive, which, of course, will\nthen induce open mindedness mentalization.\nIf I don't like music and you do, instead\nof saying, what do you like music for?\nI need a friendship with\nsomebody who likes music.\nYou think, hey, that's interesting.\nIf I'm interested in you as a friend\nand I have respect for you and what you\nthink, then why would I not have some\ninterest in what you're interested in?\nSo this idea of compatibility revolves\naround the health in each person.\nIt doesn't revolve around factors\nthat are anything but the concrete\nlogistical factors that would\njust keep two people apart.\nAndrew Huberman: I love the idea that\nhealthy relationships center around the\nfactors that really matter within the\nself, in particular the generative drive.\nAnd I love the example of someone being\nable to be curious about somebody's\ninterests, about their partner's\ninterests, even though they might\nnot share those from the standpoint\nof agency and gratitude, because the\nagency component there is really key.\nI think that a lot of people feel\nas if they aren't really good at\nsomething or really knowledgeable about\nsomething, then it's not for them.\nWhich is the opposite of\nhaving agency and gratitude.\nBecause gratitude is\nclosely tied to humility.\nHow could we know everything?\nIt can be good, certain\nthings, and not others.\nSo the way you describe it includes\naspects of openness, of humility, but\nalso the agency side, the empowerment.\nLike, if I'm going to learn\nmore, then perhaps we could\nenjoy more of that together.\nPerhaps not, right?\nI think this is what I'm sensing, and I'm\nalso sensing that the words like-minded,\nlike-minded people has so much more to do\nwith their generative drives and how those\nmatch up as opposed to the activities\nthat they prefer engaging in and the sorts\nof foods they like or the movies they\nlike, which makes sense at some level.\nBut I think it is still counterintuitive\nfor a lot of us who just kind of\nreflexively think, oh, they like the same\nthings, or maybe even they met at work\nbecause they like the same type of work.\nThey like to live in a certain\narea of the country, and\ntherefore, by proximity, they met.\nAnd this raises all sorts of\ninteresting ideas, perhaps, about\nthe statistics of what we see.\nLike two musicians together, we\ntherefore assume that musicians belong\ntogether or two scientists together.\nI know loads of scientist-scientist\ncouples or scientist-physician\ncouples, but of course, the numbers\nare skewed because they were working\nin environments where it increased\nthe probability they would interact.\nSo this is actually a vote for online\ndating in some sense, because it breaks\nthrough all those, sometimes even\ngeographical barriers, but certainly\nthe traditional barriers of culture.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nAnd if you think about it, we're\ntalking about relationships, so\nI would like my relationships to\nlast as long as possible, right?\nThat means now we're talking about\nmy lifespan and my health span.\nThat then becomes part of that discussion.\nAnd of course, we're very interested\nin lifespan and health span.\nAnd we see people do much, much\nbetter when they're interconnected\nin the world around them, when\nthey're still learning new things.\nWe know that's true, that people often\nwill tail, they sort of trail off of what\nthey're learning, whether it's music,\nit's literature, it's the world around\nus relatively early in our lifespan.\nBut the person who's interconnected\nlearning new things has a much\ngreater probability of living\nlonger and living healthier.\nRight?\nSo think, what's that about?\nIt's about a generative drive.\nIt's about, you know what, I've learned\na lot of things over the course of my\nlife, and I'm 80 years old now, and\ngreat, that there's more to learn, right?\nAnd that's what you see.\nIt makes me think of a woman who's\naround 90 years old in my practice.\nShe's always learning new things, she's\nsuper interested in things and I'm always\nstruck by how she seems so much younger.\nAnd there, that's not just a selection\nbias, like, oh, I just happen to\nsee that in that person, she has the\nfactors that predispose to aging in\nthe way that's healthiest and happiest.\nSo it really comes down to, the root\nof all of it, in ourselves, in our\nrelationships, in the quality of them\nover time and how long we get to have them\nreally arises from a generative drive.\nAnd that's the thing that makes us\nthen undefended, and lets us find\ninterest in things about other people\nthat are different from the things in\nus, which also comes about naturally.\nI think it's interesting that we\nhave this sort of bias, like I said,\nthat musicians belong together.\nWell, why?\nThey're familiar with\nthe same things, right.\nI guess they have the same interest,\nsame thing with scientists.\nBut then a lot of people\nlike different foods, right?\nI love different ethnic foods.\nWhy?\nBecause it's different, right?\nIt's an appreciation of difference.\nI don't want to eat just like I\ndid growing up and many, many,\nmany people are like that.\nThat's an appreciation of\ndifference, of diversity.\nSo sometimes we'll kind of harness that\nand we'll look at it and we'll say, oh,\nthat's present in us, but for whatever\nreason we become very reductionist\nabout relationships and now we're\ntrying to match based upon sameness,\nand sameness is not the point of it.\nI mean there are even thoughts\nabout people then in some way\nseeking difference, and maybe\npheromones are telling us that.\nI actually know very little about\nthat, but I certainly know that\nstriving for sameness doesn't make\ngood things happen in relationships.\nI've been doing this for over 20\nyears and I don't see that the\nalleged factors of sameness matter\nagain unless they're so concrete.\nLike if this person is absolutely going to\nlive in North America and that person is\nabsolutely going to live in South America,\nlet's not potentially put them together.\nBut once we get away from almost that\nlevel of concreteness, let's look\nfor something different, and then\nlike everything else, it simplifies.\nThe higher we go up the ladder,\nthe more simple things get.\nIf you're looking at the pillars,\nstructure of self, function of\nself, you're creating the agency and\ngratitude, then what are you looking\nfor when you're looking for a partner...\na match in generative drive.\nI want mine to be strong and I see\nthat it's strong in this person.\nThey create in a way, you know what,\nI do science, they grow a garden.\nWe're generative together.\nLike that could be super compatible\nbecause we're looking at the\none factor that really matters.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd like to take\na brief break and acknowledge\none of our sponsors, AG1.\nAG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that meets all of your\nfoundational nutrition needs.\nI started taking AG1 way back\nin 2012, so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking AG1, a nd the\nreason I still take AG1 once or generally\ntwice per day, is that it's the easiest\nway for me to ensure that I'm getting all\nof the vitamins, minerals, probiotics,\nand fiber that I need in my diet.\nNow, of course, it's essential to get\nproper nutrition from whole foods,\nbut most people, including myself,\nfind it hard to get enough servings\nof fruits and vegetables each day, and\nespecially to get enough prebiotics\nand probiotics to ensure gut health.\nAs you may know, your gut contains\ntrillions of little microbiota,\nthe so-called gut microbiome, which\nestablishes critical connections with\nother organs of your body to enhance\nbrain health, as well as to support your\nimmune system and other aspects that\nrelate to mental and physical health.\nOne of the most common questions I get is,\nif you were to take just one supplement,\nwhich supplement would that be?\nAnd my answer is always AG1, because\nby taking AG1, I'm able to ensure\nthat I'm getting all of the vitamins,\nminerals, and probiotics that I\nneed to enhance my mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nIf you'd like to try AG1,\ngo to drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel\npacks, and they'll give you a\nyear's supply of Vitamin D3K2.\nAgain, that's drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim this special offer.\nI'm realizing that most of what I\nand everyone else has heard about\nrelationships is complete nonsense.\nI really mean that.\nI mean, it has occurred to me before\nbecause I've experienced both that\nthe phrases 'absence makes the\nheart grow fonder' and 'out of\nsight, out of mind,' are in direct\ncontradiction with one another.\nSo they're both true, it depends\non the circumstances and who\nthe hell knows why, right?\nYou also hear opposites attract,\nbut they don't stay together.\nThe important thing is to find\nsomeone similar to you or that\nthere's like one person that's right?\nI mean, these are, if we really\nthink about it, crazy notions--\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: --but they\ndrive a lot of what people think\nabout relationships, right?\nPaul Conti: They drive angst.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: They drive bad choices.\nThey drive situations that then create a\nsense of guilt and shame and inadequacy.\nWe mislead ourselves by not going to\nthe basics of what is actually true.\nLet me look at myself, make myself\nas healthy as I can be, right?\nBecause if I'm healthy, I'll recognize a\nlack of health in the other, s o it also\nprotects us against bad relationships.\nAnd then if I'm going to make myself\nhealthy, which we're describing, how\nthat looks, wouldn't I want someone who\nalso wants to make themselves healthier?\nAt least if we're going to\nally, let's ally around making\nboth of ourselves healthier.\nAndrew Huberman: Absolutely.\nAnd we're going to go deeper into how\nto look into the map of self and how\nthat relates to relationship, certainly\nmore as we go along this discussion.\nYou've mentioned several times,\nhowever, about generative drive and\nthat it really is the definition\nof like-minded in some sense.\nAnd you also mentioned aggressive\ndrives and pleasure drives, themes\nthat we touched on again in episodes\none and two, but listening to those\nepisodes is certainly not necessary to\ndigest what we're talking about today.\nCould you go a little bit deeper\ninto the generative drive,\nflesh out for us what that is?\nI think generative, I think\ngenerator, I think energy.\nI hear aggression or aggressive drive.\nI think, as I think most people do,\nfriction, maybe even conflict, maybe\nphysical conflict, maybe verbal conflict.\nBut I know it's some of that\nperhaps, but a whole lot more.\nAnd then pleasure drive and pleasure.\nSome people think bliss,\nsome people think delight.\nSome people probably have all\nsorts of specific things they\nthink of with respect to pleasure.\nSo if you could just flesh those out\nfor us a little bit more, because\nI think those are going to serve as\ncornerstones of today's discussion.\nPaul Conti: Sure.\nSo drives, in this case the generative\ndrive, sort of exist within us.\nAnd what they do is\nthey're defining potential.\nSo right now, one could argue, if\nw e just pause for a couple of s\neconds, we're not doing anything\ngenerative in those seconds.\nBut then we resume doing something\nthat we believe is generative.\nSo at the time we're pausing, that's\nwhen we can sort of look at that as a\ndrive within us to make new learning, to\nunderstand things we didn't understand\nbefore, to spread a sense of goodness.\nSo it resides in us in a way\nthat is determined by a whole\nbunch of different factors.\nLike everything else that's\ndetermined within us, there's a\nnature and a nurture component.\nSo some aspects of it are what are\nthe genetics that came down to us?\nWhat are formative experiences?\nBut we can go in and alter that.\nSo if we see the drive as a set of\npotentials, like in that moment, we pause.\nThere's a set of potentials within us,\nlike potential of where we can take our\nthoughts, our actions, our reflections,\nour decisions, that's the drive within us.\nAnd it exists within us in a\nway that we could localize now.\nLike, if we think enough about, okay,\nhow much of a generative drive is there\nin a person, how much is that person\nlooking to make a better life for\nthemselves or a better world around them?\nAnd how do they feel about themselves\nand their ability to do that?\nHow generative are they?\nOr how shut down or\ndemoralized or envious?\nSo we can, in a sense, localize that.\nAnd again, the localization has these\ngenetic and nurture components to it,\nbut we can then go and influence that.\nAnd that's the importance.\nIf the drive is a set of potentials,\na set of possibilities, then that\ndrive is one and the same pervaded\nwith, however we want to describe\nthat, with the agency and gratitude,\nbecause the agency and gratitude is\nsort of the operative form of that.\nThat's the verb.\nIt's the drive, actually\ndriving something.\nSo if you have a strong generative\ndrive, then agency and gratitude\nare leading the decisions.\nThe reflections are coming through\nthat, the aggression within us,\nor again, that's the historical\nword, but so we can say aggression,\nassertion, proactiveness, right?\nAll of this inside of us and our\ndrive for pleasure, for gratification,\nthat all is, then it's in us, but\nit's subserving the generative drive,\nmeaning the generative drive, that\nset of potentials and possibilities\nis dominant, which of course makes\nsense with agency and gratitude, those\nactive verbs being what is most active.\nAnd then we're also going to feel at\ntimes, and hopefully at a lot of times,\nthat set of peacefulness, that sense of\ncontentment, the sense of delight, what\nyou're describing when you're doing the\npodcast and you're in it and all these\ngood things are happening to you, right?\nThere's a strong generative drive in you.\nThat set of potentials are\nbeing actualized through the\nverbs of agency and gratitude.\nLike you're doing it all right then,\nand as you're doing it, you have\na sense of peace and contentment\nas you're enacting all of it.\nAnd then that makes you healthier.\nIt reinforces the generative drive.\nIt protects you against the next\nsling or arrow of outrageous\nfortune that will come your way.\nYou become more self knowledgeable,\nmore, you become stronger.\nAnd ultimately, that's\nwhat we're looking for.\nThat's the state of goodness.\nAnd I believe that if you\nlook h istorically, what\nis it that we're seeking?\nWe can put so many words to it, and\nwe're choosing to put these words to it.\nI mean, I think that this is the\nstructure, because I think the\nscience, the history, the clinical\nexperience, the phenomenology,\nI think it all tells us this.\nWe can put different words to it, but what\nwe're looking at when we're looking at\ntruth and how to get to the \"happiness\"\nthat people have sought through the\nages, I think we know enough now.\nWe've learned enough that we can say,\noh, this is what it looks like, and\nit fits the arbiter of all truth,\nwhich is, as you get further u p\nthe hierarchy, it gets simpler.\nThat's true about humans.\nWhat's going on in my unconscious\nis very, very complicated.\nBut if that's summing to, as we\nget higher up to, I'm approaching\nthe world with a lot of agency and\ngratitude, that's a lot simpler.\nAnd that's what can be common among\nus, which is why if my pillars are very\ndifferent from your pillars and what\nwe've struggled against, each is very\ndifferent, and what we may still have to\nwork against is very different, well, we\ncan be extremely compatible as friends,\nbecause are we working on ourselves?\nAre we fostering the generative drive so\nwe're coming at the world in that way?\nAnd agency and gratitude, that's the\nsimilarity between us that matters.\nAnd ultimately, we're looking at the\npotential that every moment we're building\nthe potential in us for what comes at the\nnext moment, which is why we're describing\nthe overlap, the point of commonality\nthat really matters, that matters.\nWe're putting a label to it.\nWe're saying it's the generative drive,\nbut i t is also that, okay, we both c ome\nat the world through agency and gratitude.\nIf two people are assessing compatibility,\nbut if we're looking at something to nest\nthat under, and what seems most logical is\nthe set of potentials within us that we're\nbuilding and altering each moment, and\nthen as I alter it in this moment, it's\naltered and then affects my next moment.\nIf I do something that's just kind of\nthoughtless to somebody because I'm\nin a bad mood, then what am I doing?\nI'm projecting out my aggression.\nI'm doing something that\nbasically makes me less than.\nAnd then I'm going to feel\nless in the next moment.\nWhether that moment is about me or\nis about someone else, the drives\nare the potentials in us, but we are\nactively working on them, determining\nthem, changing them each moment.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm well on board the\nidea that the typical pairings, let's\ncall them the idiosyncratic pairings of\nmusician with musician, in many cases, but\nsometimes very verbal person with quieter\nperson, introvert with extrovert, or\nintrovert with introvert all of that takes\nbackseat or perhaps even back backseat.\nPerhaps it even is out of the\nvehicle compared to the critical\nimportance of generative drive.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: When we think about\ngenerative drives in individuals, you\nbeautifully described what a generative\ndrive is and how it shows up in\nindividuals when thinking about generative\ndrives in romantic relationships, however,\nbecause generative drive can be expressed\nto varying degrees, does one often see\nthat, or do you think that, a matching\nof sort of levels of generative drives\nis what fosters the best relationships?\nIn other words, let's say somebody\nhas a pretty high pleasure drive,\nbut not a very strong, aggressive,\nalso called, proactiveness drive.\nAnd so maybe they watch a lot of\nNetflix, like a lot of Netflix, but\nthey're not even the sort of person\nthat's really excited about the shows\nand telling you about them, because\nthere's a version of watching a lot\nof Netflix where the person is really\ninterested in learning and in knowing.\nMaybe even they're thinking about\nwriting something, you know,\nsome poetry or book, or they're\nbringing some of that to their life.\nI mention it that way because\nwatching Netflix isn't bad, per se.\nIt's not anti-generative.\nPaul Conti: Is it an\nescape, or is it generative?\nIs a person thinking about what they're\ngoing to do, they're going to write\nthat book, or are they just trying\nto numb out, and at the end of five\nhours in front of the television, they\ndon't know what those five hours were?\nThere's no intrinsic value judgment\nbased upon a lot of things that\nwe make value judgments about.\nYou have to look at, who is the person?\nWhat is the context?\nAre they being generative or not?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nSome of the movies and shows that\nI've watched in relationships became\nthe points of connection around, at\nleast to me, tremendously interesting\ndiscussions on hikes that we took\nthe next day and reflections on our\nown relationship and work and life.\nAnd so I'm so glad that you point out that\nthere's nothing intrinsically valuable\nor invaluable about something like\nNetflix, or even intrinsically passive\nabout doing something like sitting around\nor even reading books, for that matter.\nThere's a passive version of reading\ngreat books also, people forget that.\nIt's hard to read a great\nbook and not learn something.\nI guess that's why they're\ncalled great books.\nBut there is a version of\nthat, and I know many people.\nPaul Conti: People want\nto possess the book.\nI read the book and I'm going t o check\nit off and I don't know what was in it.\nLike people do that.\nThat is not generative.\nAndrew Huberman: So should we consider\nmatching of level or expression of\ngenerative drives as perhaps what we\nare all seeking in seeking relationship?\nAnd do you think that people tend to pair\nup naturally, pair up with people that\nhave a similar level of generative drive?\nOr if they don't, do you\nthink it leads to problems?\nPaul Conti: Yeah, I think that by and\nlarge people don't, that it's not the\nthing that we're thinking about and\nlooking for in ourselves or others,\nand I absolutely believe that it\nmakes problems and let's take a look--\nAndrew Huberman: To not look.\nIt makes problems to not look.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nIt makes sense.\nThe fact that we're not basing\nit upon generative drive does\nindeed, I think, make many, many\nand in fact, countless problems.\nAnd I would take as an example, think\nabout the idea of a trauma bond, right.\nA trauma bond is not a bad thing.\nThat sounds like a strong statement,\nbecause the way that I hear a\ntrauma bond used is it's a bad\nthing, b ut it doesn't have to be.\nSo let's take a look at it.\nImagine that you have what\npeople call a trauma bond.\nYou have two people who will\nmake up a situation, right.\nThey're functioning in the world\naround them, b ut they each have\nhad some very s ignificant trauma\nthat is creating issues in them.\nSo let's say they're avoidance issues.\nA person doesn't feel safe or\ncomfortable in the world around them.\nThey get invited to places that\nthey'd like to go, but they don't go.\nThey want to go to the museum and see\nsomething really new and cool there.\nBut there might be a crowd.\nI mean, this happens.\nAnd let's say you have two people\nwho both have this in them.\nIt could be because the trauma is similar.\nThe trauma could be night and day.\nBut they each have this in them.\nThey could bond around that trauma\nin a way that worsens the trauma.\nThat's why people think\nnegatively of a trauma bond.\nSo if the case is that the trauma\nbond is not a good thing f or these\ntwo people, you say, why is that?\nIt's not because both of them have h\nad trauma and both of them are impacted\nby trauma, and both of them a re\nimpacted by trauma in similar ways.\nIt's not that.\nIt's that the drives are not in a\nhealthy place and the gratification\nof the generative drive and the\npleasure drives are not high enough.\nSo let's imagine the generative\ndrive could be relatively low in\neach of these people in one or the\nother, or they could have a naturally\nhigh drive that's being thwarted.\nSo there's something that's out\nof balance where the drive is,\nthe ability to express the drive.\nIs there enough agency?\nIf there's not, like, let's say one\nperson is really, really shut down.\nThat person can't stand their job, right?\nOkay.\nSomething is shutting that person down.\nThe generative drive wishes\nfor greater expression.\nThey go back and look at themselves.\nYou can bring that into line.\nBut something is out\nof balance at the time.\nThe pleasure drive may be low or it may\nbe high, but it may not be gratified.\nIt may be that that person loves\nmuseums and wants to go to the museum,\nbut can't find that gratification.\nThat's a possibility.\nThe aggression or assertion drive would\nbe on the low end, but it could be higher.\nMaybe if that person felt safer, that\ndrive within them has a lot of latitude\nin it, and maybe it could move higher.\nBut something is out of balance in\nthe drives and in their expression.\nThat's the problem.\nBecause let's look at the\nother side, where a trauma\nbond is a great thing, right?\nSo each of the people in the example\nhas trauma, and they recognize it in\nthemselves, and they understand how\nit makes things harder for them, and\nthen they're communicating about how\nit makes it hard in the other, right?\nSo maybe there's a lot of overlap\nin social avoidance and sense of\nvulnerability, but maybe there\nare things that are different\nin one person versus the other.\nSo then they can come together and\nsay, look, what's the goal of life?\nI would like to be as\nhealthy a s I can be.\nI'm working on myself.\nYou want to be as healthy as you can be?\nWe want to be as healthy as we can be.\nAnd if we're healthy, we also\nhelp e ach of us be healthy.\nSo maybe those two people, neither\nof w hich they would ever go to the\nm useum on their own, because the\ntrauma inside of them is at a point i\nt hasn't been worked through, or it's\na t a place where they just simply feel\ntoo vulnerable, but together they can\ngo to the museum, and then the bond\naround trauma helps them be healthy.\nThe drives are in a better place\nbecause they're able to recognize, hey,\nthere are things going on in me that\nI'd like to be different and better,\nand you recognize that, too, and we\ncan talk about it with one another.\nRight?\nSo they're in a healthier place,\nand then from that healthier\nplace, they build greater health.\nAndrew Huberman: So much of what we\nhear about in terms of friction points\nin relationship centers around it seems\ncommunication or lack of communication.\nAnd as you're describing the role\nof the generative drive in healthy\nrelationship, it seems to me that\nit ties back in every way to agency\nand gratitude and agency being such\na critical element of communication,\nbecause wherever you've identified that,\nokay, there's a potential problem here.\nPeople with high generative drive in these\nexamples seem to be capable of, like,\nself inquiry, asking the other person\nquestions that bring them closer together\nand to a deeper understanding of the self.\nI raise this because one thing that's\noften overheard, or that I've overheard,\nI of course have siblings and friends,\nand I'll place this in the way that I've\nmost typically heard it, but I'm sure it\nexists in other ways too, which is the\nconversation in my head is one where a\nwoman is saying they're with somebody or\ndating somebody, and he's so clueless.\nI wish that he would just do this thing.\nSometimes these are acts of chivalry,\nlike, maybe it's flowers or vacations, but\nmore often than not, it's a request or a\ncomplaint about a lack of proactiveness.\nThis is also what ratchets up to\nthese very pan statements that you\nhear, like, oh, there's no real men\nthese days, or like, there are no\nreal men left, or this kind of thing.\nYou also hear it in the reverse, right?\nYou hear men making pan\nstatements about women.\nAnd here we're doing this in the\ncontext of heterosexual pairings.\nPaul Conti: But of course it\ncould all work just as well.\nAndrew Huberman: It could all work in\nthe context of homosexual pairings too.\nSo you hear those sorts of things, and\nit sounds like a lack of communication.\nOkay, maybe one person needs to be better\nat asking for their needs to be met.\nMaybe the other person needs\nto develop more of an awareness\nof what the other person needs.\nOf course, we all seem to kind of\nintrinsically wish that things would\njust happen for us without the need\nto request them or ask for them.\nBut I'm realizing again that all of\nthat is distracting commotion, because\nthat's not really what's going on.\nWhat's really going on, it seems, is\nthat the engine behind communication, the\nengine behind curiosity, a desire to learn\nand know and create something from that\nlearning and knowing in the relationship,\nthe generative drive, is really what's\nthe issue, or the lack of generative\ndrive in any of those conversations.\nIt seems one could circle back to that and\ngo, okay, well, someone's not asking the\nright questions and therefore not doing\nthe right things because they don't either\nhave a sense of agency, or they don't have\ngratitude for the situation they're in,\nincluding their own ability to do that.\nRight?\nSo when you hear people aren't showing\nup for the relationship, they're not\nshowing up, or she's not showing up.\nOr again, let's make the pan statement\ngo in the other direction, that\nsomebody just wants a lot of attention.\nThey just need an excess amount\nof attention, won't let me do\nmy own thing, but also want\nme to work and be successful.\nAgain, these are stereotypes, but\nall of that seems very distracting.\nHowever, all of it seems far simpler\nif we push it through this filter\nof generative drives and whether\nor not it's being expressed.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nI think maybe the best example of t\nhis, because it's so highly charged,\nis, i magine that the pleasure drive is\nthrough the lens of sex and sexuality.\nSo imagine that people are in a pairing,\nthey're in a relationship, regardless\nof h ow they got there, w e're taking...\npeople are in a relationship.\nAnd one h as say, a sex drive, which means\na n interest in sex and maybe proclivities\nfor diversity of sexual experience.\nLet's say if we just for sake of\nthis example, we put on a one to\n10 scale, that person is a two.\nOkay, now let's say the other\nperson in the relationship--\nAndrew Huberman: 10 being the greatest?\nPaul Conti: Yeah, sorry.\n10 being the greatest.\nThat person is a two.\nNow let's say the partner is an eight.\nOkay, so there's a big mismatch there,\nyou think, how does that normally go?\nThe two stays a two, the eight stays\nan eight, and things don't go well.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: It creates\nfriction in the relationship.\nAt a minimum, it blows\nthe relationship apart.\nAt a maximum, the person who's\na two feels inadequate often.\nI mean, it's not always right,\nbut this is how this often goes.\nPerson who's a two feels inadequate\nbecause the person who's an eight\nwants either more or different and\nthe person who's a two doesn't.\nNow that person feels bad, and they may\nfeel bad about themselves or resentful\nof the person with a higher sex drive.\nThe person on the higher level\nfeels now resentful of the\nperson at the lower level.\nOr maybe they feel like there's something\nwrong with them because their sex drive\ni s too high, or they have an i nterest\nthat the other person doesn't have.\nAnd now they start labeling themselves.\nThis happens all the time and it\ndoesn't change most of the time.\nAnd the problems are enormous.\nOkay, let's see.\nHow would that look with really\nhigh generative drives and\ntherefore the ability to think\nabout self, to think about others,\nand to think about the \"us\" of the\nsituation, t he two people together.\nSo they would be able to talk\nabout it in ways that wouldn't be\nfaulting of the other and would\nacknowledge what's inside of them.\nLike, the person with the lower drive\ncould say things like, it doesn't\nstrike me as more interesting.\nI don't think about it more.\nThey could talk about all of that.\nThe person who wishes more\nor wishes different could\ntalk about that too, right.\nAnd could talk about what they feel\ninside, if there's a frustration of that.\nJust like the person with the lower\nsex drive could talk about how\nfrustrating i t feels to feel pressured.\nRight?\nSo what are they developing?\nThey're mentalizing.\nThey're thinking about each other's\nemotional states, and they're coming at\neach other through agency and gratitude.\nLike, I'm so grateful for you.\nRemember, see, the example is these\npeople are partners and they're\nhappy with their partnership.\nLike, oh, my God, I'm\nso grateful I found you.\nThey would each feel that way.\nI'm so grateful you're in my life.\nLike, this happens too, right?\nAnd then from that lens, the two\nisn't going to become an eight.\nThe eight isn't going to become a two.\nBut in general, in situations\nlike this, there can be\nsomewhere in the middle, right?\nLet's say the two says,\nlike, okay, you know what?\nI can get out of my\ncomfort zone a little bit.\nWhy don't most people try that?\nBecause they feel embarrassed,\nthey feel self conscious.\nThey don't want to try\nnew things or try more.\nPeople get closed down because\nthere's such shame around sexuality.\nYou could take people on any spectrum\nof sexuality and you will find shame\nnot in every person, but across\nwhatever population we're looking at,\nbecause it's so emotionally charged.\nSo let's say in a loving, caring\nrelationship, you're like, that\nperson feels the freedom inside.\nSay, you know what?\nMaybe I could enjoy sex a\nlittle more, a little more\noften, a little more innovative.\nThat person thinks about it like somebody\nwho's at a two can then move t hat to\na different place a little b it more,\nor maybe even a lot more, depending.\nAnd then the person who's at the\nh igher level, the eight doesn't\nneed another eight in order to stay\nin the relationship, but something\nmaybe more than a two, right?\nAnd then let's say they come into\nthe middle, and then the person who's\nan eight realizes like, look, I love\nyou and you love me and you're out of\nyour comfort zone in order to do this.\nAnd wow, a nd it's like\nmore fun for both of us.\nSo you know what?\nIt's okay.\nMy higher sex drive, I'll deal with that.\nThat maybe just making it up, l ike, I\nwould like to do it t hree times a week.\nWe're doing it, two.\nOkay, you know what?\nThat's fine.\nBoth sides can live with it.\nBut it is not threadbear.\nIt's not like, well,\nthey can live with it.\nIt's like, no.\nNumber one, they can live with it.\nNumber two, it's better.\nIt's better, right?\nThe two at one point was\nthinking, hey, anything more\nthan a two is, I can't do that.\nThey shut down.\nThe eight doesn't want\nanything less than an eight.\nNow they're in the middle and\ntheir relationship is closer.\nThat's real.\nThat happens.\nWhat is it relying upon?\nIt's relying upon the generative\ndrive to h ave the openness,\nthe ability to communicate.\nMaybe the person who's an eight,\nsay, has a sexual proclivity\nthey're embarrassed about.\nThat happens all the time, too.\nBut in the sense of acceptance of self\nand the belief in the strength of the\nrelationship and the acceptance of t\nhe other, people can broach things.\nMost people who feel like, oh,\nI c ould never broach that.\nIt's not something bizarre or dangerous.\nIt's not something that in a relationship\nthat's defined by the generative drive,\nthe o ther person is likely to reject.\nSo let's define our relationships\nthrough the g enerative drive,\nand let's cultivate in self a nd\nothers the most generative drive.\nIf somehow, let's say, person A and\np erson B here, because it doesn't\nmatter who's the eight and who's\nthe two, h as cultivated more of a\ngenerative drive, then maybe that person\ncould give more t o the other before\nthat person can give back to them.\nWe have these, I think, just completely\nnonsensical ideas about mutuality.\nThe idea that even in a situation that's\nsupposed to be defined by love, a nd\nfriendship is a form of love, right?\nSo friendship, a collaborative endeavor,\nthey have some affection in them, right?\nFriendship can have love and often does.\nAnd let's say the love of\nromance, that there's supposed\nto be some equality, right?\nThe idea that, well, if I'm going t\no give something, I want you to give\nsomething, too, it is not good if one\nperson is always doing the giving.\nThings are out of balance, but it\nis very healthy to be able to s ay,\nif I can give something and y ou're\nnot in a place to give something.\nLet me just give something to you.\nPeople don't always, or maybe don't often\ndepend on how we want to look at it,\ngive to others with a sense of freedom.\nAnd you don't owe me anything either.\nWhy?\nBecause it comes from love.\nIt comes from the abundance, the excess of\ngoodness in me coming through the agency\nthat I feel, the gratitude that I feel.\nAnd then what's more likely, you're much\nmore likely the other person, to sort of\nfeel like, hey, I can go a little more.\nYou feel stronger, you feel empowered\nmaking someone feel worse or saying,\nyou know what, I can give you something,\nbut you owe me something back.\nEven if that's tacit, I\ncan give you this now.\nBut you kind of know that the other\nperson is going to end up doing the\nlaundry for two months or something\nlike that, this is not okay.\nWhy don't I just give something?\nYou're giving goodness, and then the\nother person actually gets the goodness,\nand they're more likely to find it within\nthemselves to then come a little out of\ntheir comfort zone, develop, move their\ngenerative drive a little bit forward.\nGifts given to others with no expectation\nof return are gifts of abundance.\nThey're gifts that arise from\nthe generative d rive, and\nthey make us more generative.\nThink about the opposite.\nW hat often happens, each person\nmakes the other feel guilty, right?\nOh, this person wants you, wants so much.\nAnd look, there you are again.\nLike, people feel terrible\nabout that, or t he're you don't\nwant any sex, or this or that.\nThe other person feels terrible.\nThat's why the two stays the two\nand the eight stays the eight.\nBut it doesn't have to be that way, a\nnd it's also not that if both end up\nin the middle, say both a re a five,\nthat that's some compromised position.\nThat implies less.\nNo, that's the compromised\nposition that makes more.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd like to take\na brief break and acknowledge\nour sponsor, Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've spoken many times before on this\npodcast and elsewhere about the fact\nthat getting a quality night's sleep on a\nregular basis is the foundation of mental\nhealth, physical health, and performance.\nWhen we're sleeping well,\neverything goes better.\nAnd when we are not sleeping well\nor enough, everything in terms of\nmental health, physical health, and\nperformance gets far worse very quickly.\nOne of the key things to getting a\ngreat night's sleep is to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment.\nAnd that's because in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep, you\nneed your core body temperature to\ndrop by about one to three degrees.\nAnd in order to wake up feeling refreshed,\nyou need your core body temperature to\nincrease by about one to three degrees.\nThat all becomes very easy when using\nan Eight Sleep mattress cover because\nit allows you to program the temperature\nof your sleeping environment at the\nbeginning, middle, and towards the\nend of your night when you wake up.\nI started sleeping on an Eight Sleep\nmattress cover over two years ago, and\nit immediately and persistently improved\nthe quality and depth of my sleep.\nAnd as a consequence, I wake\nup feeling far more refreshed.\nI have enhanced mood, focus and\nalertness throughout the day.\nIf you'd like to try Eight Slee p, you\ncan go to eightsleep.com/huberman to\nsave up to $150 off their Pod 3 Cover.\nEight Sleep currently ships\nin the USA, Canada, UK, select\ncountries in the EU and Australia.\nAgain, that's eightsleep.com/huberman\n.\n Based on my understanding of the\ngenerative drive, the aggressive also,\nwe're calling it proactiveness drive, and\nthe pleasure drive, and the importance\nof the generative drive being greater\nthan the aggressive or pleasure drives,\nI can also see the potential problem of\nhaving, like, two eights along the sexual\ndesire scale, or two nines, or two tens.\nAnd actually, I've observed\na lot of examples of this.\nFor instance, if there are, let's say,\ntwo nines, put both people nine out of\n10 on the joy and sort of proclivity\nfor sex, adventurous sex, etc., they're\nvery high on the pleasure scale, perhaps\neven so much so that they don't pay\nattention to, or one person doesn't\npay attention to the critical need for\npoints of compatibility to be met, like\nthe desire to someday have a family.\nI've known couples like this.\nThey're together for a long time.\nThey seem to really enjoy one another.\nI know nothing of their sex lives, but\nthere just seems to be a very strong\nattachment around certain forms of\npleasure that they both enjoy engaging in.\nSo this could be activities or travel.\nI mean, here we're saying nine\nout of 10 on the sex scale.\nBut in many of those cases, there's one\nperson saying, but I want to have a family\nsomeday, and they're just not into that.\nOr perhaps even like, but\nhe won't leave his wife.\nThey're involved in something\nthat feels really good.\nThey're matching along some pleasure\ndrive, but completely overlooking the\nlarger goals of one or both people.\nRight here I pointed to an instance of\ninfidelity that's its own issues with\nmorals, etc., but you see this a lot.\nPeople really orienting towards what\nfeels good and who feels good to be with.\nAnd that, of course, is healthy,\nbut that's not the entire picture.\nSo would you say that what I'm describing\nis an example of where the pleasure\ndrive has overcome the generative drive?\nBecause in the case of somebody wanting\na family and the other person already\nhaving one and being unwilling to leave\nthat one or the other person not wanting\na family, that the generative drive of\nthe person who wants a family is not\nbeing respected or it's being undermined\nby this excess desire for pleasure.\nLike they're just drawn into the\nmoment and the amazing weekends,\nbut this person's incredible\nand they're charismatic.\nAnd I can't tell you how many times\nI've had friends say that they admire\nthe person they're with, but they know\nthe relationship can't work because\nof all these other underlying issues.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nIt's interesting.\nWe both overestimate and\nunderestimate what, say, love can do.\nRight?\nPeople say, oh, love can do anything.\nNo, if I spill that glass, love's not\ngoing to put the water back in it.\nIf I must live in North America a nd\nmy partner must live in South America,\nwe're not going to be okay, r ight?\nSo we say these things\nin a very wishful way.\nLove will overcome everything.\nIt doesn't overcome that, o r maybe\nit does in the right circumstances.\nSo think about if the generative\ndrive i s very high in both people,\ns o both people have, say, a strong\nn eed to live in a certain place, t\nhey can find a compromise position.\nMaybe they live half the year in North\nAmerica and half in South America.\nBut why?\nBecause in that situation, the\nlove between them, which is the\ngenerative drive in the relationship.\nSo what does that mean?\nThe first person has to have a strong\ngenerative drive, be healthy, understand\nthat even though I n eed to live in North\nAmerica, does it actually mean that?\nThat I really need to\nlive in North America?\nI have to be able to see beyond\nmyself, a nd what does that mean to\nthe p erson I love who needs to live\no n the other side of the world?\nIf the other person can do that\nt oo, then in the relationship,\nwhich is a new entity, i t emerges\nfrom one person and the other.\nYou can know everything about one\nperson, everything about the other.\nYou don't know about the\ntwo of them together.\nSo the two of them together are an \"us\".\nAnd if that us has a strong generative\ndrive, which it can If each person\nhas a strong generative drive, they\ncan bring to the state of emergence\nof the us the generative drive.\nAnd we're talking about a relationship,\nso say the love between them\nand they can find a way through.\nSo the idea that love cures\nall things, we have to define,\nwhat does that actually mean?\nIt doesn't mean we have a lot\nof pleasure together, right?\nOr we like a lot of the same things.\nThat's not what that means, a nd people\ncan very much love one another but not be\naware of the limitations inside of them.\nBecause maybe there are other things going\non in them, like, say, childhood trauma.\nThey love one another, but they can't\ng et out of their comfort zone enough.\nSo the point is, if we make ourselves\nas healthy as we can be a nd then two\nselves come together that a re making\nthemselves as healthy as they c an be,\nthen the us between them really can fit\nthat definition of love and do anything.\nBut we have to define that in the\nright way, in a way that honors\nthe truth, which, again, is not\na higher degree of complexity.\nIt's actually more simple.\nAndrew Huberman: So you gave an\nexample of a romantic relationship\nwhere one person has a strong sex\ndrive and the other a weaker drive.\nAnd then we talked about an example where\nboth people have an essentially high sex\ndrive and where that could potentially be\nbeneficial, assuming that the generative\ndrive is also high in both of them.\nAnd we also explored a little bit of\nhow it can be bad for relationship\nif it exceeds the generative drive.\nWhat about the aggressive\nproactiveness drive?\nHow does that show up\nin romantic pairings?\nIf one person has a high proactiveness,\naka aggressive drive, and the other\nperson does not, what does that look like?\nDo you see that often in\nyour clinical practice?\nPaul Conti: Sure.\nIf this makes sense, maybe we look\na t that example of the person\nwho's a two and the person who's an\neight on the sex drive scale, right?\nYou'd say, okay, the person who's\na t wo, who's trying to raise that\nright, has a strong generative drive.\nWhat does that mean?\nThe person thinks, you know what?\nI think I can do this.\nI can set myself about this.\nI see it will make my relationship\nbetter, I'm going to give it a try.\nThat's a generative drive in\naction, the pleasure drive.\nThe person may look at that and say, look,\nmaybe this can be more fun for me, right?\nIt hasn't been that fun for me.\nIf I have a low pleasure drive,\ncould I start enjoying this more?\nAnd then maybe that moves up, right?\nOr maybe I have a higher pleasure drive,\nbut it's not been gratified because I\nhaven't been able to be open and honest.\nLet me see if I can make that better.\nThen what's active, what the person is d\noing, is then going to be the aggressive\nor assertive, proactive to that drive\nand going to the potential in that\ndrive and mining some of what's in it.\nLike, yeah, how am I going to do that?\nI'm going to bring myself to bear,\na nd that's not an easy thing.\nIt's not like that person then all of\na sudden decides to be more sexual.\nThere has to be a lot of communication\nbetween the two people, a lot of\ndiscussion of what setting might be best\nfor that, what helps the person feel\nunderstood or feel more comfortable.\nThere's a lot then, to do there.\nAnd the person may even need to\ng o back to the pillars because\nthe p erson may feel like, whoa,\nI don't think I can do that.\nAnd then it is...\nthat's not good.\nI want to do that.\nWhat is it that I can't do?\nThere's a realization there.\nAnd then maybe the person who's an eight\nbecause they're so well connected gets it.\nOkay.\nYou can't do that.\nLet me support you in whatever way\nwhile you're figuring that out.\nBecause they're both generative,\nthey want to figure that out.\nAndrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt.\nWhen you say, go back to the pillars,\nyou mean go back to exploring\nthe structure of themselves and\ntheir function of themselves--\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: --so that they can, for\ninstance, get some insight into what sorts\nof defense mechanisms might be in place--\nPaul Conti: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: --what they're paying\nattention to or their behaviors,\nlike maybe even health related\nbehaviors that could be impacting\ntheir sex drive, but maybe even\nthings that reside at a deeper level.\nThe unconscious mind, talking to somebody\ntill they make a connection around shame\nor some story that they've integrated into\ntheir thinking at a subconscious level.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nJust an example that I see a l ot is\navoidance, where, again, not always,\nbut let's say the person who's the\ntwo on the sex drive scale who f inds\nlike, I can't do it, r ight, wow,\nI just can't bring myself to do it.\nAnd then they go back and they explore.\nThis happens a lot\nwhere there's avoidance.\nAnd then we get curious about the\navoidance because the person's\nlike, there's something that\njust, I don't want to do that.\nSo there's avoidance.\nWe identify avoidance.\nWe also identify that it's not healthy,\nb ecause the person does actually\nwant to do that because it's good\nfor the relationship and it could be\ngood for them, too, a nd then maybe\nwe start looking at u nconscious\nmind, right, or conscious mind.\nAnd maybe we don't find\nit, because it's easy.\nNow, if I said, oh, there was a major\ntrauma that the person hasn't processed.\nSometimes it's that, but a\nlot of times it's not that.\nMaybe that person just never learned\nto feel comfortable with sexuality.\nOr maybe the way that they experience\no r are attracted to sexuality\nwas disparaged or denigrated.\nOr they had some bad feeling\nabout it because the society\nand the culture told them that.\nOr maybe they had a couple\nof bad experiences where they\nwere treated in a certain way.\nAnd then it's like, okay, that\nperson comes by that honestly,\nthere's not a major trauma there.\nIn fact, unfortunately, there's a trauma\nthat's almost predictable from the\nway our society has been structured.\nSo person can go, look at that.\nI'm like, right, I never\nlearned how t o do this or how\nto be comfortable with this.\nOr you know what I learned that\nI'm not good at it, or I learned\nthat no one will enjoy it with me.\nBut that's not true.\nThese are situations not on the\nside o f a loving relationship.\nNow t hat person is able to bring that\nknowledge to bear, whether it came from t\nhe unconscious mind or the conscious mind.\nAnd then that's how you work\nto start shifting things.\nLike, that was then, this is now.\nIt is not then.\nwhen, say, the person, say in\nhigh s chool, had a sexuality that\nothers didn't a pprove of and made\nthem feel bad, well, guess what?\nIt's not then.\nAnd that's unfortunate.\nIt's wrong.\nIt's unjust.\nWe're going to honor and\nvalidate all that that is.\nBut we're also going to look at that.\nThat was then, this is now.\nAnd you get to behave differently now.\nYou're an adult now, and adults\nget to choose their relationships,\nand you chose a good relationship.\nSo this is the kind of thing that can\nget that person to the p oint where\nthey can go back up through now.\nWhat happens at the end of it?\nThe geyser is stronger.\nThere's more agency, there's\nmore of a sense of gratitude.\nWhy?\nBecause the person can attach themselves\nmore to, I'm so lucky to have this person,\nas opposed to, damn it, I wish that person\ndidn't have a higher sex drive, right?\nAnd they feel better about themselves\ninstead o f, what's wrong with me\nthat I d on't have a higher sex drive?\nOr I said they wish the other person\nhad a lower sex drive or wish they had\na higher sex drive that's not grateful.\nLike I'm grateful I am who I a m and\nthat I have any sex drive at all.\nAnd I'm grateful for this other person.\nNow, through that, that change, they can\ngo back and better access the assertion,\nt he proactive drive, the aggressive\ndrive, whatever w e want to call it,\nbecause they've taken away, they've gone\nand worked through the barrier to it.\nThen they're able to be a little m\nore out of their comfort zone, and the\nother person meets them there, right?\nAnd they start having this healthy thing\nb etween them where the us that is them,\nthe love between them, gets better, right?\nAnd then where do they find themselves?\nThat's how they get to the five,\nwhich is not a compromise between\neight a nd two that satisfies neither.\nIt is a compromise between eight\nand t wo that is way better for\nboth and for the relationship.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm curious about\ncommon pairings that you observe in\nthe clinical setting, and not to focus\non the bad, but if there are common\npairings that rarely lead to a good\noutcome, I think it's worth us learning\nabout those, simply because they're\ncommon and they lead to a bad outcome.\nAnd a discussion of this sort could\npotentially help people avoid such\npairings, or at least recognize\nthat they're in such pairings.\nAnd I realize, of course, because\nof the way that we're framing things\nduring this series, that anytime we\ntalk about a pairing, we're really\ntalking about two maps coming together,\nforming a new and somewhat independent\nmap that represents the relationship.\nI have to assume that many people in\nthe world have maps that are very,\nvery healthy, and they're probably\neven those rare individuals that don't\nneed to go into those cupboards that\nreside within structure of self and\nfunction of self and do any work.\nBut for those of you that are just\nlistening and not watching this,\nI'm sort of smiling as I'm saying\nthat, because I don't actually\nbelieve any such person exists.\nI think all of us, even the healthiest\namong us, could be even healthier\nand express more generative drive and\nmore positivity for ourselves and for\nthe world were we to do that work.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAbsolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: So it's a lifelong--\nPaul Conti: There's no endpoint to that.\nThat's beautiful.\nWe can do that forever\nas long as we're here.\nAndrew Huberman: And you\nshould, I do believe.\nWhich is one of the reasons\nfor having this discussion.\nExactly.\nNonetheless, I have to imagine that\nthere are also a lot of people out\nthere, perhaps most people, who\nstill have a lot of work to do.\nAnd those words, a lot, perhaps,\nare in bold faced capital\nunderlined, highlighted letters.\nAnd as a consequence, we see relationships\nin the world that are not healthy.\nWhat are some of those\ncommon unhealthy pairings?\nI think it's worth spending at\nleast a little bit of time on this.\nPaul Conti: Yeah, sure.\nAs we talk about this, I think that we\nshould make a sort of somewhat simplified\nbut hopefully helpful distinction.\nSo there are people who are coming a t\ncoupling from primarily health, right?\nAnd again, this isn't to criticize\npeople who aren't coming at\nit from primarily health.\nWe all want to get to where\nwe're coming at anything and\neverything from primarily health.\nAnd there a lot of the problems are\nthose simple things like, wow, I\ncan't believe it didn't work out.\nI play the trumpet and\nhe plays the clarinet.\nIt's like, no, that wasn't\na real set of factors.\nThat's why it didn't work out.\nIt's more in that realm.\nIt's not always just that, but that\nk ind of stuff is a big factor.\nWhen we look in the other realm, where\nthere are significantly problematic\nmental health issues, which people\ncome by honestly but need to face if\nlife is going to get better, there\nare two common paradigms there.\nNow, again, there are way more than\nt wo ways this can happen, but I'm\ngoing to highlight two that we see\na lot and maybe more than anything\nelse in the clinical setting.\nSo the first gets called\nrepetition compulsion.\nBut I want to be very clear, I do\nnot believe that there is any such\nthing as a repetition compulsion.\nA compulsion is something\nthat one cannot control.\nWhat's going on inside the person is\nvery, very complicated when they're making\ndecisions that lead to repeating a cycle.\nAnd those are things that can change\nand do not have to be compulsive.\nSo people are often struck by why a person\nis in the same bad relationship, seemingly\nthat they have always been in, but with\na different name on the other person.\nI mean, people will say this like i t's\nthat person's fourth abusive relationship\nin a row, and it seems to be, it's just\nthe same person with a different name.\nPeople say that a lot.\nThey say that about themselves,\nthey say that about others,\nand it's very, very baffling.\nI mean, people have often been in my\noffice very upset about that, like\nrealizing they're repeating and they\ndon't know and it's frightening.\nAnd you can get a lot of fear\nand vulnerability from that.\nBut there's a way of understanding it\nthat, because the limbic system, the\nemotional parts of our minds don't\ncare about the clock and the calendar.\nSo trauma impacts, it impacts\nthe whole brain, but trauma\nimpacts the limbic system.\nIt creates strong negative emotion that\nthen stays with us regardless of time.\nIt doesn't care about time.\nSo imagine now a person gets in a\nrelationship and the relationship\nstarts to become abusive.\nI mean, it's easy to say that and\nthen move on to something else.\nWhat's that like for that person?\nWhat does that feel like when\nthat person, who they may have\nseen as a protector, a friend, is\nnow cursing at them, denigrating\nthem, pushing them, hitting them?\nI mean, it's terrifying.\nIt's horrible, right?\nSo it is a deep impact, a t\nraumatic impact on the person.\nAnd a lot of the time, most of the time,\nlike all trauma, it triggers shame.\nSo trauma triggers shame in us.\nIf the trauma is strong enough, it changes\nus as we move forward in the world.\nAnd then we are different\nin a way that makes the past\nvery immediate in the present.\nSo what the person then is trying to\ndo, and there's been a lot of thought\nabout this over the years in the\nfields, trying to understand this,\nand I think in many ways doing a good\njob of understanding this, that the\n\"repetition compulsion\" is the drive,\nand I don't mean drive like we're saying.\nThere's a push inside the person to\nt ry and make that right with the i\ndea that if that person can be in that\nsituation again, and I don't mean in\nthe exact situation when someone raises\na hand to them, but they can navigate\na relationship because they thought\nit was a good idea the first time.\nSo they don't want to feel\nlike that was a very bad idea.\nSo I'm going to make it right, a nd\nthen I'm going to be okay and I'm\ngoing to be whole because the person\nis driven by fear and v ulnerability\nand the shame of the trauma.\nSo then they're trying to make it\nright because the limbic system doesn't\ncare about the clock or the calendar.\nIf you can make it right now.\nYou make it right in the past, b ecause\nthat system doesn't care about the past.\nIt's driven by trauma, s o then\nthe person's trying to figure\nout something that is different.\nThey're trying to choose that person,\nbehave in the relationship, they're trying\nto make t hings different, but they've\nselected for a d ramatically high pretest\nprobability of the same t hing happening\nagain, which is why if I could count the\nnumber of times t hat someone has said\nto me, oh, you're not going to help me,\nespecially a t the beginning of therapy.\nThere's no way you can help me.\nFive relationships were totally terrible.\nThere's no way.\nThere's no hope, right?\nPeople have said that to me so many times.\nThe last three, the last\nfive, the last nine.\nAnd I will say back, if you t ell me\nseven different stories of relationships\nwith seven pretty different people,\nseveral different relationships as\nthey evolved, and the same really\nbad outcome, I'll agree with you,\nbut you're not going to tell me that.\nAnd that's why there's hope.\nAnd no one has ever told me s even\ndifferent stories where I feel like,\nwow, you just can't do it, right?\nNo.\nAnd again, even if there were seven,\nI'm saying things for exaggeration.\nBut there aren't.\nWhat is it?\nIt's the same thing seven times.\nThat's what it is.\nBecause the person is repeating.\nAnd if they can understand the what\nand the why, why are they selecting?\nHow are they selecting someone?\nWhat's going on inside of them?\nWe go back to the structure\nof self, the function of self.\nWe address what is there then\nthat absolutely can change.\nAnd then what we will talk about\nis that person then goes out\nto find another relationship.\nEven if they said they\nnever, never would again.\nLike now they're making the\ndecision to go out, as to say, what\nrelationship a re you looking for?\nYour second.\nYou're the first one seven times.\nNo harm, no foul.\nBut you can navigate the second\nbecause they're in a different place.\nThey're coming through\nagency and gratitude instead\nof denigrating themselves.\nIf you're what's wrong with me, what's\nwrong with everybody else, I'm here.\nEven though some bad things\nhave happened to me, look at\nwhat I can bring myself to bear.\nI can go out there and try and find\nsomeone I can see with clear vision now.\nThere's agency, there's gratitude,\nand then that p erson can go\nout and find relationship number\ntwo that's a really good one.\nAndrew Huberman: In the example you gave,\nit's very powerful and also very extreme.\nAn abusive relationship where someone\nis sadly getting hit or screamed at.\nOftentimes, it seems people end up in\nrepeated unsuccessful pairings, meaning\nunhappy pairings of maybe someone who's\nvery strongly assertive, maybe we would\nsay has a strong aggressive drive.\nSome people might even\ncall them a narcissist.\nThat phrase is thrown\naround a lot these days.\nI mean, narcissists,\ngaslighting, like projection.\nThese phrases are thrown around all\nthe time, I think, with frankly,\nvery little understanding of what\nthey actually mean, unless they're\ncoming from a qualified clinician.\nIs it the case that somewhat\npassive or submissive people\nare drawn to narcissists?\nAre narcissists drawn\nto submissive people?\nI think these questions ring\nin a lot of people's minds.\nPaul Conti: If I could clarify\nsomething that I think I maybe\ncould have said in a clearer way.\nYou pointed out that the example\nI gave was a very strong one\nor an extreme one, right?\nSo as a physician, I think I\nnaturally gravitate to the extreme\ncircumstances because they're the\nones that bring the greatest risk.\nBut we are talking to people in those\nsettings, but most people are not\nin those extreme settings, but that\nextreme serves as a model for how\nthings that are less extreme can happen.\nSo when I think, we're sitting here\ntalking to everyone across the spectrum,\nand most relationships that are not\ngoing well, thank goodness, are not\ngoing to be that extreme, or the repeated\npatterns aren't going to be that extreme.\nBut it's just as important to pay\nattention to a pattern where one person\nreally is sort of more deferential than\nthey would like to be to the other,\nthan is comfortable to them, and they're\nseeking someone, ultimately, who's just\na little bit more assertive, and that's\nnot s ome disaster, but it cannot go well\nover time, where that person slowly gives\nup, say, more and more of themselves.\nAnd there can be that repeated pattern.\nYou hear people say, yeah, it was\npretty good or pretty equal at the\nbeginning, but then I just had l ess and\nless of a say, or t hen more and more.\nI just became the whole relationship.\nSo it's no less important\nwhen it's less dramatic.\nBecause the relationship still goes in\na wrong way when it's more dramatic.\nThere's more risk, of course, but most\np eople are going to be in the less\ndramatic but super important category.\nAnd I think it's important\nto point that out, too.\nAndrew Huberman: How much of what we're\ntalking about is nested on people's deep,\nperhaps understandable desire to just make\nsure that the other person doesn't leave?\nI can't tell you how many times I've heard\nabout or observed relationships that from\nthe outside that seemed really unhealthy.\nBut it also occurred to me that people\nare doing things on both sides of\nthe relationship that ensure that\nthe other person doesn't leave.\nSo I'm not talking about a physical\ntrapping of someone in the environment.\nI'm actually talking about the opposite.\nI'm talking about somebody going against\ntheir better judgment and doing things\nfor the other person or against themselves\nor both, perhaps even in the context\nof what looks like healthy family, like\ndoing an excessive amount of raising\nof children or excessive amount of work\nto support the family, simply to ensure\nthat the other person doesn't leave.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nHere, again, we can look\nacross the spectrum.\nSo before this, you had talked\nabout relationships that can be very\nunhealthy, like a narcissistic person.\nAnd how can those relationships develop?\nIt's important that we touch on\nthat in the context of this because\nthat's sort of the extreme example.\nSo people who are narcissistic, meaning\na narcissistic character structure.\nNow we're getting into the realm of\nsignificant psychiatric problems.\nAnd people who are\nnarcissistic are exploitative.\nThey're a bottomless pit of\nneed arising from vulnerability,\nand yes, they can be helped.\nAnd if someone out there thinks I'm\nnarcissistic, then not trying to\nbe negative or mean like you can\nget help and you can be better.\nThat's the whole point of what\nyou and I are talking about here.\nSo people can change, but someone\nwho's coming at the world through a\nnarcissistic character structure is\nexploitive of the other and then can\nsay, survey a room and find that person\nwho's had trauma such that that person\nis going to be desperate not to leave a\nrelationship, and then they can exploit\nthat person and often behave in awful\nways and the other person won't leave.\nNow I'm giving an example.\nIt's not the case that\nway every single time.\nBut that's the dominant picture.\nIf you have a narcissistic person and who\nis that person more likely to pair with,\nand then you sense the vulnerability, the\ndesire for the other person not to leave,\nand that person would have to have then\nsignificant problems in themselves, like\npotentially, instead of a pathological\nlevel of narcissism, a pathological\nlevel of dependence, for example.\nSo we're in the realm\nthen, of real problems.\nAnd again, real problems can be treated\nand real problems can be improved,\nand that's why we have clinical care,\nbut it can also serve as a model for\nseeing the ways that are less dramatic.\nSo there are many people who,\nthrough the desire for the other\nperson not to leave, and we could\ncall that attachment insecurity.\nAnd maybe if we leave away the stereotype\nversion of it, the person doesn't feel\nsecurely attached to the other person.\nAnd somewhere inside of them, they've\nlearned that if they're more pleasing, if\nthey give up little parts of themselves,\nthat person won't leave, right?\nIt might be because that's why their\nm other didn't leave their father,\nwhen they think about it, it might\nbe that's why their father left\ntheir mother, because their mother\nwouldn't do that, whatever it may be.\nOr it may be their own prior\nlife experience or who knows,\nsomething they read but forgot?\nI mean, usually it's something\nmore salient, not always, but\nthey've internalized something that\nleads to a compromise of the self.\nNow, again, that's not what\nattachment insecurity is.\nAttachment insecurity is just feeling\nsome insecurity about the attachment.\nSo, for example, I feel attachment\ninsecurity about just about everything.\nI've had the experience of sudden,\nvery painful losses happening,\nso I have attachment insecurity\nin the sense that I'm worried.\nI get anxious about people going\naway, and I can want to over control,\nbut I recognize this inside myself.\nI try and do my best to say, look, I\ndon't want that to make me unhealthy.\nI want to recognize it.\nI want to find some happy medium\nwhere I honor that in me, but don't\nget carried away with it to the point\nwhere I try and over control and then\nI push my relationships away, right?\nSo I say that because there's such\na contrast between that kind of\nattachment insecurity, which can\ninvolve over control, and the kind\nof attachment insecurity that can\ninvolve compromise of the self.\nAnd we want to be very, very careful.\nWe want to be careful.\nWhat is a trauma bond\nand what does it mean?\nWe want to be careful.\nWhat is attachment insecurity\nand what does it mean?\nA certain kind of attachment\ninsecurity can lead a person to make\nprogressive compromises of self that\nare not good and healthy for them.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm curious about some\nof these unhealthy relationships from\nthe other side, meaning from the side of\nthe person who is, let's hope not, but\nin some cases exploited or who's being\ntaken advantage of, or in this scenario\nof a narcissistic person or an abusive\nperson is the one who's taking the abuse.\nOften, it seems the victim in\nthat scenario will be truly\nstuck in that situation.\nThey can't leave for financial reasons\nor kids or their own internal workings.\nTheir psychological machinery has\nthem locked into that in some way.\nAnd it's that locked in by psychological\nmachinery that I'm interested in.\nAnd I think a lot of people are\ninterested in, because from the\noutside we just look at that and\nsay, why doesn't the person leave?\nWhy don't they just leave?\nBut clearly there's something about\nthat \"situation\" that works for them.\nAnd by works for them, I don't mean\nthat it's adaptive, clearly it's\nmaladaptive, but that works for them.\nThe possibility I raised earlier\nperhaps is relevant here.\nMaybe it works for them because they know\nthat the narcissist gets some sort of\ninternal reward for engaging in this kind\nof dynamic and therefore won't leave.\nAnd the other person not leaving is of\nmore value to them than feeling safe.\nEven so, it's trading one\nform of safety for another.\nOr perhaps the victim, as we're calling\nthem in this scenario, is somebody\nwho feels a great sense of reward by\nserving somebody more powerful than them.\nThis raises all sorts of interesting\nquestions, perhaps about power\ndynamics as well, which I\ncertainly have questions about.\nBut what are some examples of the internal\nworkings of such a person that reside\nwithin those bins of structure of self or\nfunction of self that would put someone\ninto that sort of situation and lead\nthem to stay in that kind of situation?\nPaul Conti: Well, any situation like\nthat, if it's, as you say, working for a\nperson, which at times we see that from\nt he outside because things continue\nto go along and things continue to go\nforward, b ut that only works for someone\nif t hey don't have the understanding,\nthe empowerment, t hat we would wish\nfor anyone and everyone to have.\nSo what is going on inside leads that\nperson to feel a sense of an inability\nto change, whether they can't see their\nway out of it or they kind of could, but\ncould never navigate to it, and there's\na problem there if that's working for\nsomeone, b ecause we're talking about\nsomething that's exploitive, right?\nThat's abusive regardless\nof how it's abusive.\nAnd I think, I believe, that can\nonly happen in the context of being\ndemoralized or the circumstances\nof being so disempowered.\nIf someone just can't go 10 feet\nfrom home, like there are situations\nof outrageous amounts of oppression\nof a person where the person\njust cannot choose differently.\nAnd there are situations where we,\nas stewards of all of us, where\nthe government may intervene, for\nexample, ideally, right, as someone\nwould come in and help that person.\nBut barring that kind of outlier, a\nperson would only be in that situation\nin the context of being demoralized.\nAnd that demoralization would come\nfrom too low a drive for assertion,\nbeing proactive aggression, right?\nThat that drive, its\nrealization, is too low.\nAnd if we give people the understanding\nand we give them the help, the means, they\ndon't have to stay in abusive situations.\nLike we see this, in situations where our\nsociety will intervene or someone helpful\nwill intervene, some person or entity\nwill intervene and help a person, help\nthat person to understand what's going on\ninside of them, that leads them to feel\nthat things can't be better, they can't\ndo better, or that they're not worth\nbetter, or whatever that may be, and help\nthem to find the empowerment, to then\nnavigate themselves out of the situation.\nAnd here again, I think it's\nnot just agency, but it's\nagency plus gratitude, right?\nIncluding gratitude for having a\nself that could leave a situation.\nWhen people are in situations like that,\nwe talk about people as beaten down.\nIt's a way to kind of capture what I think\nthat feels like and how much suffering\nthere is in those situations to be in\nthat place and to not have the agency\nto get out of it, then the person is not\nfeeling a sense of gratitude for self.\nThey feel so bad about self that\nthere's nothing to be grateful for.\nAnd there is so much to be grateful for.\nWe could go through any person in a\nsituation like that, and we could list\nwonderful things about that person,\nadaptive things about that person, kind\nthings about that person, diligent things.\nThere are things like\nthat in every person.\nBut if the person can't see that, they\ncan't attach to that, they can't have the\nagency and gratitude, then they stay in\na situation that is really defined by the\nagency and gratitude, and therefore that\naggressive assertion, proactive drive\nbeing expressed at such a low level.\nAndrew Huberman: I can see how a healthy\nrelationship could exist in relative\nisolation, not complete isolation.\nAnd here again, I'm referring to or\nthinking about a romantic relationship.\nI can see how a healthy romantic\nrelationship could exist in relative\nisolation, a few friends, some contact\nwith family members, or in great\nconnectivity with friends and family\nand neighbors, etc., and still be a\nreally great romantic relationship.\nPaul Conti: Sure.\nAndrew Huberman: I can also see how\nthe sorts of relationships that we\nhappen to be focusing on at this\nmoment, which are these unhealthy\ndynamics, are made far worse by\nlack of connectivity to outsiders.\nIn fact, a previous guest on this\npodcast was David Buss, who's a\nprofessor of evolutionary psychology\ndown at the University of Texas,\nAustin, and he talked about some of\nhis research into the dark triad.\nThese are narcissistic, machiavellian,\nsometimes also sociopathic\nindividuals, and how that plays\nout in romantic relationships.\nAnd it's a terrible thing, but an\nimportant thing to understand given the\nunfortunate frequency that that occurs.\nBut one of the things that I remember\nso clearly from that discussion with\nDavid Buss was that even when there\nisn't sociopathy or a strong desire to\ndestroy the other, that in these sorts\nof relationships, there's often an\nattempt to isolate the person, first by\nisolating them from their family, also\nfrom friends and coworkers, but all\nwith the goal of convincing that person\nthat no one else would want them as a\nway to make them \"voluntarily\" stay.\nIn other words, to undermine\ntheir sense of safety, to ramp up\ntheir sense of anxiety, except in\nthe presence of that individual.\nAnd I'm remembering that now\nbecause as we're talking about,\nwhy wouldn't somebody just leave?\nWhy wouldn't they just tap\ninto that agency and gratitude?\nIt's clear that the oppressor in this kind\nof relationship has a real incentive to\ntry and undermine agency and gratitude,\nbecause, of course, with those, they\nwould be revealed for what they are and\nthe person would feel unable to leave.\nTaking us back once again to the\ncritical need to cultivate agency and\ngratitude, not just in unhealthy, but\ncertainly in healthy relationships.\nPaul Conti: Right, and I think the\nprinciple here is that darkness\nalways favors the oppressor.\nSo the oppressor wishes for darkness.\nSo you want to isolate that person\nbecause when people see that things\nare better for someone else, they\nrealize things can be better.\nWhen people are told by someone\nthat they're worthwhile or they're\nfunny or they're pretty or they're\nsmart, or whatever the case may\nbe, they may take that inside.\nThey may take inside, oh, maybe I\nam, I'm handsome and smart, maybe.\nOr they start thinking about that.\nThey're very basic concepts that\nallow a person to entertain new\nways to look at themselves, right?\nSo the person who's oppressing wants\nthat person to live in darkness.\nThey don't want them to see\nthat there can be better.\nThey don't want them to be directly told\nthat they're better than how things are.\nAnd that same darkness on the\noutside, say the lights are out\naround the relationship is the goal\nof the oppressor on the inside.\nNow, again, the oppressor may know this\nand be doing it consciously, but often\nthis gets played out in unconscious ways,\nlike the constant denigration of someone.\nA person isn't saying inside, gosh, I'm\ntrying to reduce their agency, their\naggressive drive, really down to zero.\nBut that's what they're doing.\nSomewhere inside, there's a knowing of\nthat, even if it's an unconscious knowing.\nAnd then the impact of that kind of\nabuse over time is a lower and lower and\nlower ability to bring oneself to bear,\nless proactive, aggressive, assertive,\nlower sense of agency and gratitude.\nThat's really the definition\nof being demoralized.\nAnd that kind of abuse is always promoting\ndemoralization, because demoralization\nis the darkness on the inside.\nJust as envy is too, demoralization\nis a form of darkness on the inside.\nEnvy is no less dark.\nEnvy may be a lot more active,\nbut in both cases, there's no\nknowledge, there's no growth, there's\nno wisdom, there's no learning.\nSo they're the states of darkness.\nAnd what can happen in a way that's\nreally so tragic to think about is you\noften can have an abuser, an oppressor,\nwho is living in total darkness inside,\nliving through the lens of envy.\nAnd then you can have a person who is\nbeing oppressed, who is being exploited,\nwho is living in darkness, but they're\nliving in the darkness of demoralization.\nAnd that's a very sad thing to\nsay, to imagine, and it's been a\nvery, very sad thing to see, right?\nIf you do clinical psychiatry for\nlong enough, you see a lot of this,\nand it doesn't have to be this way.\nEven the people who are oppressing\nhave it within them the majority\nof time to make things better.\nAnd we do see that.\nI took care of a man a long time ago\nwho had been terribly abusive to his\nfamily and it was always unclear to\nme, it had happened years before that\nhe just understood, and again, I never\nunderstood what happened, that he got\nit and the man really made change again.\nI don't know what the circumstance was\nthat made that motivation to him, but he\nwent back and looked at himself, and he\nwent back and looked at how his father\noppressed and terrorized the family\nand how he just did it automatically.\nBecause what was rooted in his own\nfear of vulnerability, and he's going\nto lose his family and not be a man\nanymore unless he oppresses them.\nHe recognized all of it in him, and\nhe had changed it so dramatically.\nHe had removed himself\nfrom the family system.\nAnd when I got to know him, it was\nyears later and he was reintegrating\nback into the system because there\nhad been such prolonged change.\nAnd he had communicated to the\nfamily his understanding of self.\nSo, it's not impossible.\nEven someone who is abusing,\noppressing, coming through a\nnarcissistic character structure.\nThere's no therapeutic nihilism here.\nThings can change and things can\nchange in the oppressor, which\nisn't excusing that, right?\nI mean, a person who's doing\nthings is morally culpable.\nThey often are criminally,\nlegally culpable.\nSo that is all true, just as t\nhe ability to change is true.\nAnd then the person we think about more\ncommonly in this situation, of course,\nis the person who's being oppressed.\nAnd there can be change there, too.\nBut a problem is how hard it can be.\nThe impact of the isolation, and also the\ndearth of resources to really help people.\nIt's an actual true story of a woman\nwho I believed with all my heart could\nget out of the cyclic abusive situation\nshe was in if she had a carburetor.\nA carburetor, right.\nShe had a car.\nThe car didn't function.\nShe had a place to go where others\nwouldn't know that she was there.\nAnd the problem was just a few hundred\ndollars to change the carburetor.\nBut it's like there's no place to go.\nThere's no resources.\nWe as a society don't help people.\nNow, it may be that someone helped\nthat woman and got her a carburetor\nand she drove away, right?\nBut it shows how we can bring\nourselves to bear as a society to\noffer people help, which sometimes is\nlike the lifeline the person needs.\nAnd maybe that person really needs\na safe house or something very\ndramatic, or they need a carburetor\nto get away from being terrorized.\nBut a lot of times it's just community\nsupport structures, good structures\naround people in communities that can\noffer them support in situations that\nmay be less dramatic, opportunities\nfor interconnection, which sometimes\npeople can find through social venues or\nthrough religiously affiliated venues.\nBut the idea that community\nsupport systems on all levels\nmake a huge difference.\nThere's another level, right,\nbeyond the relationship, right?\nIt's the society, it's the culture.\nAnd that's how we, on that next level\nof emergence, beyond the individual\nrelationships, can foster goodness, can\nfoster health in each and every one of us.\nAndrew Huberman: How do some\nof these same dynamics play out\nin non-romantic relationships?\nSo, for instance, in the workplace, I\nwas weaned in academic laboratories, so\nwhat's most familiar to me are, gosh,\nunfortunately, numerous examples where\npeople working in laboratories, not the\nsame as mine, because I've been very\nfortunate to have amazing benevolent\nmentors, quirky and outrageous at\ntimes, but benevolent nonetheless.\nBut others around me have been in\nlaboratories where, for instance, the\nworkload was just ridiculously high.\nLike the demand far exceeded\nwhat any person could do.\nAnd if somebody had, God forbid,\na cold or children, it was near\nimpossible to impossible that they\ncould meet the standard there.\nOr stress dynamics, so pressure\ncooker dynamics, that made it what\nanyone would call a toxic environment.\nYou see this also in law firms.\nYou see it in companies.\nYou see it in families.\nYou see it in friendship circles, right?\nI mean, how many movies are about\nteens oppressing one another through\nbullying and ridicule and practical\njokes that are anything but funny, right,\nthat are downright destructive, okay?\nAnd on and on.\nAnd so often the victims in these\ncases, if it's not a Hollywood movie,\nfeel as if that's their only choice.\nBecause to leave is to essentially\nhave no other options, right?\nIt's not that the only option is to stay.\nIt's that to leave is\nessentially to leave science.\nBecause these people in positions\nof power have the louder\nvoice, they have the megaphone.\nThey write the letters of\nrecommendation, the law firms.\nPeople talk.\nAs I kind of spool this out in a\nlong form question, I'm realizing I\ncan't think of a single exception.\nLike, as long as there are going to be\npeople interacting and people talking\nabout their interactions and people\nin positions of power, this sort of\ndynamic is going to take place, right?\nPaul Conti: Absolutely.\nAnytime you have a closed system without\naccountability, you're just rolling\nthe dice for that kind of oppression.\nWe need accountability.\nThink about theoretically what\nshould have happened there.\nThere should be higher order\naccountability, whether it's in a company\nor a university or wherever it may be.\nThere should be higher\norder accountability that\nis reasonable and rational.\nSo it's not then acting in a top down\nway that would be over controlling,\ntelling exactly what you can and can't\nsay or what you can and can't do.\nAnd sometimes there's too much\nrigidity that c an be enacted top down.\nBut the problem runs both ways.\nIf there's no accountability from\nthe bottom up, then that person\nis just simply stuck, right?\nWhy?\nBecause the system we've\nput into place has failed.\nAnd this is where we're talking\nnow about not just individual\nrelationships, two people relationships.\nBut now we start talking\nabout systems of people.\nAnd systems of people are another level\nof emergence with a personality, so to\nspeak, an environment all their own.\nYou can know everything there is to\nknow about each person in the system.\nYou don't know about the system,\nbut what you do know is that\naccountability is necessary.\nI mean, probably if we added up all\nthe examples in history, we'd have\nto talk about them over 1000 years.\nHow many examples do we have that\nclosed systems without accountability\nare just rolling the dice?\nThey breed oppression.\nThis is true.\nAnd I've been at several different places.\nSo I'm not trying to implicate this\nany one place versus another, but I\nwas part of a medical treatment team.\nSo this is a hierarchical medical\ntreatment team of maybe seven people,\ngive or take one, depending upon the\ncircumstances, where there was physical\nabuse going on in the treatment team.\nIt's true, and I'm not saying this in some\nexaggerated manner where somebody brushed\nup too close to someone and they slipped.\nNo, hurting someone on the treatment team.\nTwo different people who are being\nhurt by someone, seniors at a major\nuniversity in a clinical setting.\nAgain, it's not like that's the be all and\nend all, but you think about the alleged.\nThe sophistication of the people in\nthe system, the alleged empowerment\nof the people in the situation,\nwhich did not put a stop to that.\nSo we need to have accountability.\nThe accountability has to be reasonable.\nIt doesn't mean over control, but it\ndoesn't mean under control either.\nAnd if that person is being overworked,\nas you described, with no way of\nwinning, or harmed on a medical team,\nand there's no way that that person can\nchange that, the system has failed that\nperson and failed them dramatically.\nAnd guess who suffers?\nEveryone does, right?\nThat person suffers.\nAnd the science that's being done\nor the medical care that's being\nprovided is important to all of us.\nAnyone could be the patient who is being\ntaken care of by the team, where one\nperson is hurting a couple of the others.\nYou think that medical care is\ngoing to be optimized, right?\nIs the science going to be optimized, that\nwe're utilizing to try and make our lives\nbetter, live longer, be in less pain?\nWhat's happening there is envy.\nThat person who's oppressing other\npeople is driven by envy, whether\nit's a narcissistic character\nstructure that acts almost exclusively\nthrough envy, or it's envy that is\nin this person's life, in this way\nor not another way, does it matter?\nWhat's going on there is envy.\nAnd envy is nothing but destructive.\nThe generative drive is\nnothing but productive.\nEnvy is nothing but destructive.\nAndrew Huberman: Could you remind,\nfor people that perhaps may not\nhave heard episodes one and two\nyet, that envy is perhaps not just\na desire to be like somebody else?\nThat envy, in the context\nthat we're discussing here, is\nsomething quite possibly different?\nPaul Conti: Right, and there's a\nvarying lexicon, which is why it is\nimportant to define it, because I think\npeople learn it in different ways.\nI've heard it talked\nabout in different ways.\nSo, to define that, there's a\ndifference between jealousy and envy.\nAnd again, we could choose\ndifferent words, but this is the\nway I learned it that's been most\nimpactful, where jealousy is benign.\nIt's the idea that if I see t hat\nyou have something that I don't,\nthen I think, oh, well, maybe I\ncould work harder and get that thing.\nOr if I can't have that thing,\nlike maybe a person is younger.\nOkay, I can't make myself\nyounger, then I can think.\nOkay, through a lens of gratitude.\nIs that the only thing about me?\nI can't think of anything\ngood about myself, right?\nOther than maybe I could be younger.\nI mean, if you come at that through the\nlens of health, it's like, it's okay.\nIt can serve to motivate people to try\nharder, work harder, take a look at\nthemselves and be more accepting of who\nthey are and what their circumstances\nin life are, and what kind of control\nthey can enact and what kind they can't.\nIt's okay.\nEnvy is different.\nEnvy comes at that problem from\nthe perspective that bringing\ndown the other person is just as\neffective as bringing up the self.\nThat's why envy is destructive.\nSo someone who might see another person\nand they envy them their youth, right?\nThey envy.\nThey want that, and they want to\nbring that person down because\nI can't make myself younger.\nBut then they realize I can't\nmake that person older either.\nBut they can do other\nthings to them, right?\nThey can sexually harass them.\nMaybe they can make terrible\njokes that are really insulting\nand humiliating, maybe.\nThere are all sorts of things a person\ncan do to bring down someone else.\nThe inaction of envy is destructive.\nAnd I truly believe this, that\npeople who come at the world very\nstrongly through envy, by and large,\na narcissistic character structure.\nThis is a small percentage of the\npopulation, but that small percentage\ndoes most of the damage on Earth.\nIt's a strong thing to say, but when I\nthink about studying political science\nand thinking about history and learning\nmedicine and learning about psychiatry\nand sociology and really trying to look\nat the world and thinking, what drives\na person on a medical team who's gotten\nto be a senior physician to physically\nhurt doctors lower on the hierarchy?\nEnvy.\nThat person feels terrible about\nthemselves and then is being\ndestructive to those people.\nSame thing.\nThat same thing is at work in the lab.\nThe same thing is at work when\npeople start wars of destruction\nthat just simply harm other people.\nAnd we can see no other sense of it.\nThat from the individual setting\nall the way up to the world setting,\nwe see the destruction of envy.\nAnd we also see it inside of us,\nbecause a person who's enacting envy in\nthe world around them is never happy.\nThere's no chance of happiness.\nHence the idea of a bottomless pit.\nWhatever you get, let's say an\nenvious person who wants more money.\nI want to have more money than anybody.\nI want everyone to have less money\nthan me/ So then they come at the\nworld t hrough the lens of greed.\nWhen they get more money, how\nlong does that make them happy?\nRight?\nThis doesn't mean money is\nbad or having money is bad.\nIt just means if you're coming at\nthe world through the lens of envy,\nand that lens is specifically focused\non money, then you will be a greedy\nperson who is never satisfied, even\nif you have 10 trillion dollars.\nSo it's never good.\nIt takes away from that person\nany possibility of happiness.\nAnd if you see people work with\npeople with a narcissistic character\nstructure, there can be a sense of a\nvery brief happiness in the moment.\nLike, I'm happy because I realize I\nhave something someone else doesn't.\nI'm happy because I'm thinking of myself.\nAnd even though I feel very insecure\nand vulnerable inside, I have a\nwhole set of defense mechanisms\nthat let me turn those tables around\nand then feel good about myself in\na way that places me above others.\nWhatever's going on in that person, it\nmay bring some very brief gratification\nin the moment, but that's not happiness.\nHence the need for the gratification\nover and over and over again.\nNarcissistic people are the least\nsecure, most definite people on Earth.\nThey just have a phenomenally healthy\ndefensive structure that comes about\nin order to try and protect them.\nThat leads them to go to the opposite,\nsome of what's called a reaction\nformation, going to the very opposite,\ndenial, avoidance, rationalization,\nprojection, very unhealthy defenses\nthat then leads that person to protect\nthemselves from any help while they are\nfrantically trying to gain some goodness\nthat makes them feel good for a split\nsecond and then disappears forever.\nHence the tremendous\npredilection for destruction.\nAndrew Huberman: How do you,\nand how should we, think about\npower dynamics in relationships?\nAnd perhaps starting with\nromantic relationships?\nI've heard it said before that\nthere's always power dynamics\nin relationships of all kinds.\nI don't know if that's true or\nnot, but I've heard that, and I've\nalso heard that that's particularly\nsalient in romantic relationships,\nindependent of whether or not it's a\nhomosexual or heterosexual relationship.\nThat there's always, to some extent or\nanother, one leader and one follower.\nThis is an interesting, perhaps\na controversial idea, but I've\nheard it enough times that I\nwant to know more about it.\nPaul Conti: Sure.\nPower dynamics, of course, are very\nimportant, but also something we tend\nto be so over reductionist about.\nI mean, this idea, think about\nthat, that there's always a leader\nand there's always a follower.\nEvery single relationship, right?\nThat's true o n balance, we tend\nto be so reductionist, and then\nwhat we do is we miss the real\npower dynamics that are going on.\nJust like I had said in a previous\nepisode, that I think my math minor\nhas helped me the most for all of life.\nI think a power dynamics course\nthat I took as an undergraduate\nin political science has helped\nme the most as a psychiatrist.\nTook it long before medical\nschool, because that class taught\nme so much about power dynamics.\nI thought it was going to be about\novert power, who has power over\nwhom and tells whom to do what.\nRight?\nBut what I learned is that so\nmuch of power dynamics are covert.\nThey're under the surface, for example,\nthey're the things that are not said.\nSomething that was called at the time,\nat least, the issue of the non issue,\nwhere there's an issue between two people.\nLike, this person never\ntakes out the garbage.\nThat person always takes out the garbage.\nThat person is resentful about it.\nBoth of them know.\nBut the person who always does it can't\nsay so, because if they say so, the\nfirst person will punish them in some\nother way by not taking out the garbage.\nThen the place smells, that person\ngoes to work, and the person\nwho's at home has to take it out.\nRight.\nThat's one example of the\nissue of the non issue.\nOther examples are where someone is\nlooking and smiling and being really\nnice to someone who they know is going\nto physically harm them if they bring\nto light that they're actually not happy\nand don't feel good about that person.\nSo, from the dramatic to the\nnondramatic, unstated power dynamics\nare going on all over the place.\nAnd they're in every single relationship.\nI mean, less a person is in a\nrelationship with someone else\nand they're both comatose.\nI guess only one of\nthem has to be comatose.\nThere are power dynamics going\non, but again, it doesn't mean\nthat they're unhealthy, because\nthere are always power dynamics.\nSo then what are we looking for?\nAnd again, there are a lot of things\nwe could look for, but we could talk\nabout, really two primary things.\nOne is, look for the nonobvious,\nand t wo is the give and take.\nSo the first is even in\nour own relationships.\nBecause it's interesting how many\npeople will, say, talk about the\npower dynamics in their relationship.\nThey're not always saying, here are\nthe power dynamics in my relationship,\nbut they're telling me about them.\nAnd they're telling me about\nthe things that are overt.\nRight now, somewhere inside of them,\nthey know that they can't really raise\nissue A, B, or C, or there'll be some\nretribution, whether it's small or large.\nOr they might even know everything's\nokay and that person is happy.\nBut they know I'm not giving them\nroom to say that they're not happy.\nAnd that could just mean if they say\nthey're not happy, then I'll come home\na couple of hours late the next day.\nAnd that person will feel some\nattachment insecurity because of that.\nAnd there are all sorts of\nways t his can play out.\nBut since so much of power dynamics are\nunstated or covert, kind of like the\niceberg of conscious and unconscious,\nthere's an iceberg of power dynamics.\nSo, to think about including in one's own\nrelationships, whether it's a neighbor,\nit's a friend, it's a work relationship,\nor most charged, it's romance.\nWhat's really going on between us?\nWhat's really going on between us?\nI'm not looking to tell myself lies.\nI know that I may not be able\nto understand all of it, but\nlet me stop and think about it.\nAnd if you ask people to stop\nand do that, they can say,\nyeah, that's really not okay.\nBecause sometimes they don't know\nthat it's there, or they don't\nwant to know that it's there.\nAnd the therapy work is\ntrying to guide them to.\nThere's an immense power disparity,\nmaybe in the relationship when they're\npresenting, no, everything is equal.\nIt's a good, supportive relationship.\nHear that a lot?\nAnd of course, it's not always that\nthere's something bad under the\nsurface, but a lot of times there is.\nAnd even something mildly bad is\nnot okay and can cause problems.\nAnd sometimes there's something very bad.\nSo look for the nonobvious.\nAnd then the second is that give and\ntake is a very good sign of health.\nIs a very good sign of health.\nSo if a person can kind of see that\nthere's give and take, and it might\nbe about something as simple as.\nLike, who chooses where we go to dinner?\nOkay, sometimes one, sometimes the other.\nIt depends who has a stronger feeling.\nOr it may be that person always\ndecides where we go to dinner.\nBut the other person's okay with it,\nand that person always decides what\nmovie they want, the other person.\nSo the idea that there's give and\ntake, and then in periods of time where\none person may be in a more difficult\nplace, one person has a significant\nloss or an injury or an illness, then\nyou see that that shifts a little bit.\nOne person is giving more, right?\nBut then, ultimately the idea\nis that's from the outside.\nIf one person is giving more to the\nother, there's a generosity of spirit in\nboth the giving and the accepting that\nleads them to then be stronger together.\nSo even when people say, well,\nthey're imbalances in some way.\nIf you just look at what's going on day\nto day, but in a healthy relationship\nwith high generative drive, the periods\nof imbalance strengthen the relationship.\nYou see this with friends, where\ntwo p eople have a pretty equal\nfriendship, and t hen one person\nhas something difficult happen and\nthe other person is there for them.\nWhat's true on the other side of that?\nThey're better friends.\nAnd it's also why we often want to\nbe interconnected when we're healthy.\nWhat if something bad\nhappens to both of them?\nIt's good to be interconnected,\nand friends a nd family\ncan be supportive to us.\nThe idea that give and take is\nhealthy, I think, is very central.\nSo just looking for evidence, it's often,\nif I don't understand what's going on\nin the relationship, maybe it's early\nin t he therapy or it's just been kind\no f opaque, or I can't figure it out.\nI'm looking for, is there a give and take?\nBecause then I'm going to think, okay,\nmore likely than not, things are healthy.\nIf I see an imbalance, whether the\nperson knows it or not, I'm thinking,\nmore likely than not, it's unhealthy.\nAnd then they're just clues along the\npathway of my efforts to understand.\nAndrew Huberman: The non-obvious\npiece is really intriguing,\nas is the give and take.\nAnd I really appreciate that you brought\nup the give and take, because that's a\nvery concrete place that we can all look\nand ask ourselves, even if people aren't\nin romantic relationships, like, what is\nthe give and take in a given friendship?\nAnd as you mentioned earlier,\nit doesn't have to be scripted.\nOne for one.\nOne for one.\nMaybe it balances out over\ntime, or maybe it doesn't.\nI mean, I've had friendships that have\nlasted many decades, even where I can\nhonestly say I'm always the person\nto reach out to the other person but\nwhen they connect, they connect with\nsuch a depth of attention that I\ndon't feel any deprivation whatsoever.\nIn fact, I don't think\nI've ever considered that.\nI'm the person that always\nreaches out until today, and so\nit doesn't bother me whatsoever.\nI feel infinitely rewarded\nin the relationship.\nLike, it's generative, it\nfeels generative, right?\nPaul Conti: It doesn't have to be\nequal, however one wants to define\nequal, but it has to be mutual.\nYou're feeling goodness\nfrom the relationship.\nSo is the other person.\nOkay.\nThat's coming from that\nhigh generative place.\nAnd when we really, let's say\nwe push that concept forward\nto where we want to be living.\nNot some pie in the sky, but\nagency and gratitude as verbs.\nThe generative drive is very strongly\nexpressed, and the other drives are\nsubserving the generative drive.\nThen we get to the place where we\nreally see it is true that it is\nbetter to give than to receive.\nThe happiest people I see are\nthe people who are giving.\nNow, of course, it feels great to\nreceive, but it feels better to\ngive because there's a goodness\nin the self, in the giving.\nAnd I remember seeing this as a child and\nbeing too young to understand it, b ut I\nwas a little kid, I liked getting things.\nAnd as a little kid, I liked getting\nthings more than I liked giving.\nLike, that's okay when\nyou're a little kid.\nBut what I did observe is that my maternal\ngrandmother, who is very sweet and loving\nand caring, she loved giving, right?\nYou give her presents.\nAnd we did.\nAnd she really liked getting presents.\nShe loved giving.\nThere was an excess of goodness.\nAnd then as I got older and I learned\nmore, like who she had been in the\ncommunity and how she had been to people.\nAnd I could see, and now, through\nthe lens that there was such goodness\nin her, I think she's, for me, she's\nthe shining model of goodness that I\ninternalize as I aspire to be better.\nSo then I think I want to be like that.\nI am more generative as I try and\nthink more about giving than receiving.\nI'm not trying to say I'm some\nnoble person or I'm being ascetic.\nI'm thinking that's a good\nway for u s all to feel right.\nOr someone, a very, very successful person\nthat I consult to that is in my life,\nwho talked about how he always makes\ninside of himself the best understanding\nof what's going on between him and\nanother person, whether it's a very big\nfinancial deal or it's about power or\nit's personal and then gives a little bit.\nAlways, where have we ended up?\nLet me give a little bit, right.\nAnd there's a person who's very,\nvery s uccessful, very, very happy.\nBut I would argue the goodness in\nhim is why he's successful and happy.\nIt's not that he's successful\nand therefore he's happy.\nRight.\nIt's what's inside of him that\nfosters both of those good things.\nAnd he could be just as happy\nwithout the big success.\nMaybe he wouldn't.\nMaybe he wasn't minded to do that.\nAnd he grows a nice garden.\nHe could be equally happy.\nBut the point is the goodness\nin self, to be able to do that,\nto feel good about doing that.\nI feel better about giving that\nthan I would have receiving that.\nThat's pretty stark, right?\nIt's something given to the other\nthat I would have gotten right now,\nand we're in maybe a negotiation to\ngive it feels better than to have it.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm sure there\nare many people thinking about\nindividuals who are highly successful,\nwho are not givers, who are takers.\nI do think those examples of takers, as\nI'm calling them, grab a lot of attention.\nBut I know, at least within science\nand the other domains of life I've\nbeen in, that there are far more\nsuccessful people who are also\ngivers, even to a great extent.\nAnd of course, that doesn't mean\nthat they're giving to the point\nof an inability to give further\nor to take care of themselves.\nThe giving is part of taking\ncare of themselves, but it's\npart of this generative cycle.\nIt's not one thing.\nIt's not a tit for tat.\nIt's part of something that makes them\nfeel good, makes others feel good.\nIt's sort of anti transactional.\nAnd as we're talking about the self\nand interrelations between selves\nin these different relationship\ncontexts today, this word\ntransactional keeps coming to mind.\nAnd what I'm so aware of as you're\ndescribing what healthy selves and\nhealthy relationships look like, is\nthat it runs counter to pretty much\neverything that I've heard and that we\nhear in the world about relationships\nand about the relationship to self,\nmeaning it's not transactional.\nIt's really about a cycle.\nAnd we're using this word generative over\nand over in its specific context today.\nSo I don't want to rob that word for\na different purpose, but I'm imagining\na sort of upward spiral in my mind,\nor perhaps something that's really\nlike a circle of life that just keeps\ngrowing bigger and bigger and bigger.\nMaybe we could talk a little\nbit about this notion of\nrelationships being transactional.\nI mean, it's such a loaded word, but\nI have a close friend who's married\nwith more than a few children who\ntold me the other day, I realized\nthat it's all kind of transactional.\nLike they're extracting from me and\nI'm extracting from them, and it's\nbenevolent because it's all good.\nAnd I thought, wow,\nthis is really dreadful.\nNo one wants to think that\nthe closest relationships in\ntheir lives are transactional.\nAnd he was coming to that conclusion.\nI disagreed with him, and I don't know\nwhere that all sits for him right now.\nBut maybe we could talk about the\ntransactional versus non-transactional\naspects of relationship,\nbecause we all want things.\nThat's perfectly healthy.\nI believe we all experience\ndisappointment and pleasure and relief,\nand sometimes major disappointment,\npleasure, relief, et cetera.\nBut what is the role of\ntransaction in relationships?\nAnd how does psychiatry, how do you,\nand how should we think about that?\nPaul Conti: Well, we often get confused\nbecause there are transactions in every\nrelationship, but that does not mean\nthat every relationship is transactional.\nSo if we think about what\ntransactions are, we can think of\nin kind of the stereotypical way.\nSo it can also be like,\nhere's the transaction.\nI'll do the dishes, and you\nwash the clothes, right?\nAndrew Huberman: Or, for instance,\nI'll make the money, and the other\nperson will raise the children.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nSo there are transactions.\nBut that does not mean that the be\nall and end all of it are sort of\nhard hearted, calculated transactions.\nAnd transactions also occur in less\nobvious but equally important ways.\nSo another way that transactions occur is\nright now I'm putting something out there.\nBecause I'm saying something, right?\nAnd then at a point, I stop\nand I'm waiting for you to\nput something out there.\nAnd then I take in what you said,\nand we're doing something that\nin that sense is transactional.\nI'm waiting for you to give me something.\nI take it in, I process it, I\ngive something back out to you.\nBut that's not the be\nall and end all of it.\nSo there are transactions, whether it's\nwho's going to wash the dishes, who's\ngoing to do the clothes, or it's what d\no I put out there that you take in, a nd\nwhat do you put out there that I take in?\nThat there is something greater than\nsomething beyond the transactional.\nAnd there is some controversy to\nthis, a thought that there really is\na historical thought in the field.\nThat there are just aggressive\nand pleasure drives in us, and\nthat everything is transactional.\nNow, again, we don't really\nhave a way of disproving that.\nI mean, there's not going to be\nsome equation that disproves that.\nBut I think it's entirely\ndisproven by human experience.\nAnd there's so many, we could talk\nabout an infinite number of resources\nto consider this, but just imagine\nthe writings of Viktor Frankl and\nthe writings and the theories around\nhuman interactions and psychological\ntheories that have come of it.\nTo think that everything is just\ntransactional, it's a denial of the\nhumanness in all of us that I think he\njust brought to the fore so strongly.\nBut again, there could be nearly\ninfinite resources throughout\nhuman history that say, hey,\nwe're not entirely transactional.\nIt's not just aggression and pleasure,\nbut there's something more going on here.\nThere's learning that feels\ngood for the sake of learning.\nThere's kindness that feels\ngood for the sake of kindness.\nThere's giving that feels good,\nbecause giving feels good.\nThis is going on in us.\nIt's going on when we're, like, loving\nchildren, for example, or loving animals.\nThere's something inside of us\nthat's not just transactional.\nAnd that's why I think what we're\ntalking about is, if it's truth,\nit should all hang together, right?\nIt must all hang together.\nAnd this is why there's an us over top of\neach individual that's in a relationship.\nThis is why you can know\neverything about me.\nYou can know everything about you, and\nyou can know nothing about our friendship.\nAbsolutely nothing, right?\nBecause it's something different.\nAnd if it were all just transactional,\nthere would be nothing different, right?\nAnd I think our experience as human\nbeings, I know that to be true,\nbecause I just know that I don't\nalways feel selfish about things.\nLike, maybe sometimes I do,\nand I do something nice because\nit'll make me look good.\nLike, okay, we're all human, right?\nBut I know that there's good\nfeeling from others towards me.\nAt times, that's just\nabout the good feeling.\nI know that there's that\nfrom me towards others.\nSo that tells us, yes, there is\nsomething other than just the I.\nThere is the we of dyads, right, of\nrelationships, no matter whether they're\nwork, family, friendship, relationship.\nAnd then there are the levels\nbeyond that that are larger \"we\"s.\nThe we of groups.\nAndrew Huberman: So if I understand\ncorrectly, it can be the case that\none person makes the majority or all\nof the income for a family, the other\nperson raises the children, takes\ncare of the majority of the home.\nAnd of course, there is a transaction\nthere, a set of transactions, but that\nit's in service to something larger\nthat really isn't transactional.\nI'm just stealing your words here,\nbut if I were to expand on that,\njust to make sure I understand that\nthe non-transactional thing that\nemerges from that is generative,\nbecause it's a family, right?\nIt's a family that everyone can extract\ngrowth and pleasure and meaning from.\nAnd just because the roles are divided\nas such, it doesn't necessarily mean\nthat the relationship is defined\nas transactional in the sense\nthat it's less than it could be.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nIf you think about what's\nreally being transacted.\nSo, say one person is out in the\nworld and is making an income.\nThe other person is, say, taking care of\nthe family and taking care of the home.\nWhat's being transacted?\nWell, the person who's making the\nmoney is sharing the money, right?\nIn that sense, transacting some\nof the money to the other person.\nLike, you get to have some of it, too.\nYou get to have some\nof the benefit from it.\nAnd the person who is at home,\nwho's taking care of the family\nin the home, saying, you get to\nhave some of that too, right?\nYou get to come home, the\nchildren are taken care of, right?\nThe home is taken care of.\nSo both are transacting\nsomething to the other.\nI mean, that's the truth of it.\nIf you look at what's really going\non there, one person's getting the\nbenefit of money they didn't earn,\nthe other person's getting benefits.\nThey have childcare they\ndidn't do or pay for.\nThey're not paying for childcare,\nthey're sharing resources.\nSo, yes, that's true.\nBut is that it?\nAre these two robots?\nOne is the money making robot, and\nthe other is the childcare robot.\nThat's not what's going on.\nThe way we want to envision that,\ni f we have two healthy people with\ng enerative drives is they love one\nanother, they're creating something better\nthan they could create on their own.\nIn fact, they've created children,\nthey've created a home together, and\nthey're nurturing that family together.\nThat is generative.\nAnd because it's generative,\nit can also be flexible.\nSo let's say the person who's\nat home says, I need to do some\nthings outside of the house, right?\nOr let's say the person who's out working\nthinks, oh, my God, I feel overwhelmed.\nAnd I like to switch to a better\njob, but that job's halftime.\nI could be half in the house, right?\nThis is where people can come\ntogether in the same way.\nWe talked about the two and an eight on\nthe sex drive or sexuality scale, where\npeople then can find compromises, right?\nAnd if one really wants to stay out of\nthe home all the time, but the person in\nthe home wants to leave the home, well,\nthey find a way that that works, right?\nBecause their care for one another,\nthe generative spirit that is\nin them individually and as a\ncouple, lets them nurture that.\nAnd one isn't interested\nin oppressing the other.\nI'm not going to leave my job.\nYou stay at home or I'm staying at home.\nYou stay out there.\nIt's like, okay, let's think about things.\nLet's communicate, right?\nThat's how the generative drive not\nonly makes that awesome, like the\nfive isn't the compromised position\nbetween the eight and the two.\nThe five is awesome right here.\nThe transactional aspects are awesome\nbecause of the generative aspects of\nwhat comes of it far more than either\nof those people could make on their own.\nI mean, one would say it's not so obvious.\nMaybe if one makes X amount of\ndollars, each could make half X.\nThat's not what we're talking about.\nNeither of them can create\nthat family on their own.\nAndrew Huberman: It seems that so\nmuch of what we're talking about\nrelies on the hallmarks that we always\nhear make up good relationships of\nall kinds, romantic and otherwise.\nThings like communication, listening,\ngenerosity, all the stuff that we all know\nthat we should bring to relationship and\nhopefully are getting from relationships.\nAnd that if we're not, that\nwe should probably request\nfrom others in polite ways.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nI have one word for that.\nKindergarten.\nRight?\nThink about that.\nWe learned that in kindergarten.\nWhat you're describing is so simple.\nThat's why it's so high up on the,\nthis is what the geyser is pushing up.\nIt's high up from the two pillars,\nbecause what you're talking about is\nsimple generosity of spirit, giving\nrather than taking, being kind to\nothers, letting things go, feeling good\nabout yourself, even if you fall down.\nWe learn this in kindergarten.\nSo we must, somewhere inside of us,\nreally value it, but then we let it go.\nWe make things overly complex.\nAnd this idea that in many ways\nwe should go back to kindergarten\nbecause there's a purity there.\nChildren at an age where they can\nlearn, and then we bring a nice kind\nof learning to them and a nurturing\nto them and we can bring it to\nourselves, too, so that we simplify\nthat which has become overly complex.\nWe simplify because\ntrauma makes complexity.\nHaving to just make one's way in\nthe world is complicated, right?\nSo things get more and more complicated\nand we lose the simple roots of\ngoodness or the goodness of simplicity,\nand we can come back to that.\nSo I couldn't resist when you said,\noh, these simple, these basic things.\nThat's the point of it, because\nthat's where agency and gratitude\nand the generative drive, that's\nwhere they live in the simplicity.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm glad\nyou mentioned kindergarten.\nIt brought me back to images of\nkindergarten where, yeah, as far\nas I can remember now, there were\nall the critical components of\na great generative environment,\nadults who really cared about us.\nFortunately, there were snack time\nwith oranges, so nourishing food,\nthere was nap time in the afternoon.\nLike, these things are all things--\nPaul Conti: You got\nsome exercise, explore.\nAndrew Huberman: You could take a\nguinea pig home on the weekends.\nThey had this guinea pig.\nI think there were several guinea\npigs, but they kept trying to convince\nus it was the same guinea pig because\nthey would allow one family to take\nhome the guinea pig each weekend.\nAnd sometimes I think it\ndidn't work out quite so well.\nBut anyway, the guinea pig\nwas a pervasive feature.\nSo you learned to take care of things.\nAnd in all seriousness, now that I\nstep back from it, there's nothing\nmore generative, it seems, than a\nkindergarten classroom environment,\nor we should say a healthy\nkindergarten classroom environment.\nIt's all about support of others.\nAnd if we go to the pillars, the structure\nof self and the function of self, surely\nthere's a lot going on at home, too.\nBut think about what's salient.\nIt's learning messages of self\nconfidence, like instilling those.\nIt's behaviors that are based\non strivings and hopefulness.\nIt's all the good things.\nYes, all the good things.\nAnd so, as I was thinking about\ncommunication and all these good things,\nthat clearly kindergarten is a wonderful\ntemplate for, in all seriousness\nI think, is an amazing template.\nI'm thinking about what gets in the way,\nand of course, trauma can get in the\nway, and we should talk about that more.\nBut it seems to me that one of the things\nthat gets in the way of asking for what\nwe want, of hearing requests of us in\nthe way that is going to bring about the\nmost generative goodness, is anxiety.\nIt's like you're tired from a\nlong day and someone mentions,\nwe have to take the trash out.\nI was at work all day.\nThat kind of thing or earlier you\nwere talking about the issue of the\nnon issue in terms of power dynamics.\nWell, let's just say I've had the\nexperience before in relationship of\nfeeling like if I make a request or I\nhave a quote unquote complaint about\nsomething, that the other person is\ngoing to be so upset about the fact\nthat they didn't do something well,\nthat it's going to be three days of\njust diminished happiness for everybody.\nSo I just assume, not deal with it, right?\nSo when we hear the word anxiety, I\nthink we often think about the person,\nlike quaking about public speaking\nor like getting the circuits in\ntheir brain hijacked that were only\ndesigned for saber toothed tigers.\nBut anxiety seems to serve both\na very important functional role\nin modern life that has nothing\nto do with physical threat.\nBut it also seems to be the feature\nthat if not kept in check, if we can't\nregulate our own anxiety, I'm realizing\nthere's no way that we're going to\nbe in a position to ask for what we\nneed and what we want, to hear what's\nneeded of us and what others want.\nIn other words, anxiety seems like a\nmajor barrier to the generative drive.\nPaul Conti: I think the place to start\nis i f you show me a person who has\nno anxiety, I'll show you a mannequin.\nWe all have anxiety in us.\nRemember, it's just a word, right?\nWhat are we getting at?\nWe're getting at a sense of tension\nor a sense of disquiet inside of\nus that we would like to solve, we\nwould like to ease, if we could.\nIt is not helpful or healthy if\nwe have very, very low levels of\nthat, because then our strivings\nare certainly going to suffer.\nThere's not a lot of motivation\nto go make change in the\nworld, a change in our lives.\nSo if we have too little of that\ntension, that doesn't go well.\nAnd of course, that maps\nto a low assertiveness,\naggression, proactive drive.\nThere are other ways that could\nshow i tself, but it maps very\nclearly, I think, to that.\nAnd that's not good for us on\nthe other end of the spectrum.\nWe're much more concerned with the\nother end of the spectrum because a\nlot of anxiety feels very, very bad\nand it feels very bad right now, right?\nSo our high levels of anxiety,\nthey narrow our cognitive spectrum.\nThey narrow our ability to think\nabout what's going on around\nus, to think about ourselves.\nSo the idea with anxiety is\nto recognize, hey, we all have\nit, and we can call it anxiety.\nWe can call it tension.\nWe can call it whatever we\nwant t o, but we want that to\nbe i n a healthy place, right?\nWhich comes, of course, back to the self,\nthat if my levels of anxiety are very\nhigh and therefore it's causing problems\nin my relationship, like maybe I'm\nalways asking my partner if we're okay.\nThat happens a lot.\nLike, are we okay?\nAre you happy?\nBecause there's a lot of anxiety in me.\nThe first place to go\nis to look at myself.\nSo we could say, oh, I\nhave attachment insecurity.\nThat's just stating the obvious, right?\nAndrew Huberman: Or, sorry to\ninterrupt, but a very common one\nnowadays that I think is new in\nthe course of human history is\nthe tugging the line phenomenon.\nYou text somebody, you're thinking\nabout them, you don't hear back,\nand then tension starts to mount.\nAnd then depending on the context,\nyou may either be concerned about\nthe person or even suspicious\nabout what the person is up to.\nI mean, here it's very contextual, right?\nAnd it depends on the history of both\nindividuals and that relationship.\nBut then the person will reach\nback eventually and it either\nwill bring relief or relief with\nsome resent, like, where were you?\nWhat happened?\nThis is very, very common.\nSo much so, in fact, that I've\ncome to learn in talking to\nothers, and this is the classic...\nI have a friend who, but really\nothers who are in the landscape\nof looking for a relationship.\nAnd there are people I know well who\ngo through a lot of effort to set an\nintermittent schedule of response.\nLike to not give the other\nperson the sense that they always\nrespond with short latency.\nBecause, indeed, sometimes they will be\nable to do that and sometimes they won't.\nWhat they're basically trying to do is\nmake sure that the person doesn't, they're\nactually trying to take care of the\nother person in addition to themselves.\nBecause I think we come to expect\na certain latency of response\nwith certain individuals.\nAnd if we don't hear back with that\nparticular latency of response,\nour own anxiety starts to pick up.\nAnd it can be quite damaging to a\nrelationship, in particular to the\ngenerative drives within us, because\nin that time that we're stressed,\nwe're not tending to other things,\nincluding things that we could do for the\nrelationship that we're so worried about.\nPaul Conti: The famous scene in Swingers,\nright, where t he person leaves a message\nand then lives the whole relationship\nin his own m ind and breaks up with the\nperson and they never actually spoke.\nThere's the anxiety run wild.\nAnd of course, I remember that\nwas very popular when it came out.\nWhy?\nBecause it resonated with the\ninsecurities we feel and now with the\nability to feel those insecurities\nin a much more immediate way.\nThat person didn't text me back.\nThere's a lot more of that inside o f\nus, which really points to if you're able\nto identify that you're anxious, too.\nAnxious for comfort, which, again,\nif one looks inside or even listens,\nmaybe to what others have said or\nreflected, like, there's a lot of\ndata, especially introspection, t\no be able to identify that, right?\nThe next question is always, why?\nLet's go look at that.\nMaybe that person has been\nanxious their whole life.\nMaybe they just have\nrun tense all the time.\nYou know what?\nSometimes a little bit of medicine\nthat kind of just pulls that down.\nP erson can take that for 50 years, life\nis better, t here's no side effects, s o\nsometimes that might be the case, right?\nSometimes the person's anxiety kind of\ngrew throughout childhood, and maybe\nthat's because there were difficult\nthings or traumatic things that happened.\nMaybe there was nothing like that,\nbut maybe the person was very good at\nengaging in the world and then felt\nmore and more pressures upon themselves.\nAnd no one ever did anything wrong,\nand they've only been rewarded.\nBut regardless, look at\nthe anxiety in yourself.\nGo back to those pillars, right?\nAnd one might discover, for example,\nmaybe the anxiety I'm feeling is\nattributable to the other person.\nAm I feeling anxious\nbecause I'm intimidated?\nAm I feeling anxious because I\nknow that if I don't behave in a\ncertain way, the next time there's\na group meeting, there'll be\nsome snarky joke made about me.\nSo, anxiety, sometimes it's the self.\nSometimes it's got a lot\nof biological components.\nSometimes it's got a lot of\npsychological components.\nSometimes both.\nSometimes it's the environment.\nSometimes it's the other.\nThe other person.\nSo look at why.\nBecause that's how we learn.\nLike, what is going on inside of me?\nWhere is that level of anxiety?\nHow does it not feel comfortable?\nWhat actually is it?\nHow is it changing, how I'm behaving?\nHow might it be changing?\nHow am I responding to it?\nSo, what are we doing?\nWe're going back to this, look in those\n10 cabinets and figure out why, which we\ncan do the vast majority of times between\nourselves and the use of others, either\nprofessionally or non professionally.\nWe can go understand the\nanxiety or the lack of anxiety.\nWhy am I not so motivated?\nRight?\nI mean, that's the case with a lot\nof people who feel demoralized.\nThey don't feel they can\nget anywhere in the world.\nThe world's a bad place, and how are\nyou going to make your way in the world?\nAnd they start feeling nihilistic, or\nthey feel like the eight ball is against\nthem, even in a generational capacity.\nAnd now they feel demoralized, and the\ntension inside is soothed by things.\nSo maybe that's the person who's\noverusing the thing that soothes, right.\nSo they could go look at, hey, I\nwas kind of motivated and did well\nin sports or did well in this, was\ninterested in that, what's going on?\nThat's how a person could identify,\nfor example, being demoralized.\nSo that process of inquiry gives\nus the information that we can\nuse in the service of change.\nAnd the change, while not achieved\n100% of the time, the change for\nthe better is predictable if it's\narising from a place of understanding.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm very curious\nabout frames of mind in relationship.\nIn particular, how being in our own\nexperience, say, anxious because someone\nhasn't responded to us and really paying\nattention to the anxiety and drilling into\nit and asking ourselves, why am I anxious?\nAnd do I deserve to be anxious?\nIs it about me or is it about them?\nWhether or not that's a valid pursuit,\nor whether or not focusing on the\nother person and trying to imagine\nwhat's going on in their head, that\nthey might be doing this or that\nthey seem to do something repeatedly.\nThis, of course, relates to much more\nthan just the scenario of waiting for\na text message and feeling anxious.\nI think so much of how we come into\nrelationships of all kinds, romantic\ncertainly, but family relationships\nare in and around the tendency to\nswitch back and forth, sometimes\nseemingly at random, between our own\nexperience and what am I feeling?\nWhat am I experiencing?\nAnd then thinking about the other.\nLike, what are they thinking?\nWhat are they experiencing?\nI mean, this has everything\nto do with human dynamics.\nI would think that it's near impossible\nfor the typical person to just live\nlife through their own frame and\nlens and never pay attention at all\nto what others might be thinking.\nEven, for instance, the most exploitive,\nextractive narcissist sociopath presumably\nis thinking about who in the room\nis going to be their target because\nof how that person might be feeling.\nAnd of course, on the benevolent side,\npeople who want to do positive, generative\nthings in the world are probably thinking\nabout who to align with, who has common\ngoals that they might want to work with\nor be with romantically that could help\nthem and the other person generate.\nSo what is this thing that we do?\nWhat is it called, and how does it work\nto place ourselves in the mind of others?\nAnd what roles does it serve and what\ngoals does it undercut when we do this?\nPaul Conti: Well, I think the first\nthing to say is that everything\nfollows the same simple pattern.\nSo I start with thinking about me, right?\nIf I'm anxious, why am I anxious?\nWhat's going on inside of me?\nThen I think about you.\nAre you anxious too?\nOr maybe I'm not anxious,\nbut I notice that you are.\nSo there's the thought about the\nI, because I can't think in a\nclear headed way about you unless\nI've thought about me, right?\nBecause if I'm really, really\nanxious, then how am I supposed\nto understand and try and get an\nidea of where you're at, right?\nSo then where do we arrive?\nWe arrive at the magic bridge of the us.\nThat's what connects us.\nWhether the us is a friendship, it's a\nprofessional relationship, it's romance.\nThere's the bridge of the us.\nBecause it's not just\nhow or when am I anxious.\nHow or when are you anxious?\nWhat are things like when we're together?\nMaybe that.\nMaybe I'm anxious when we're together.\nAnd what's that tension about?\nOr you're anxious when we're together.\nAnd maybe that's for reasons we\ncould talk about and make less.\nMaybe there's some insecurity in one\nof us, or maybe the other person is\nbehaving in a certain way that's not\nmaking the second person feel good.\nWe can then come together and see\nhow does the us impact the level\nof anxiety, and how do we then take\naway from the us being stronger?\nSo think about, w e talked\nabout the trauma bond.\nTrauma bond can be\nenacted in a negative way.\nIt can be enacted in a positive way.\nAnd those two people who can go to\nthe museum together, who can't go\nto the museum separately, they're\nliving in the magic bridge of the us.\nThey're both at the museum, but\nneither can go to the museum.\nNeither can go to the museum,\nbut both can go to the museum.\nAnd then they take away\nstronger selves from that.\nThat's a reinforcing experience.\nIt's positive.\nIt builds the generative drive.\nIt builds confidence.\nThe person went, they were assertive,\nand that was gratified in a good\nway, and they felt pleasure.\nSo when we look at the us, it is about\nthe us in the moment, but it is also\nabout how two people are impacting one\nanother in the rest of their lives.\nAnd of course, this is more important\nthe closer the relationship, like this\nis very important, for example, in close\nfriendships or family relationships.\nAnd I think this is of extreme\nimportance in relationships.\nThese are the two people who presumably\nare the closest to one another on Earth.\nSo a shared us that promotes understanding\nand bolsters a sense of agency and\ngratitude and bolsters the generative\ndrive that's great for both people\nwhen they're not in the us, when\none goes one way and one goes the\nother, because that happens all the\ntime in relationships, too, right?\nGo to work at different places or\nwe bolster ourselves outside of\nrelationships if we see what the magic\nbridge of the relationship can be.\nSo, we can look there for\nproblems like, why am I anxious?\nWhy are you anxious?\nWhy are we anxious?\nWhy are you only anxious\nwhen we're we and not...?\nWe can look for all that,\nand we should, right?\nBut we can also even more\npowerfully look for the good there.\nHow can our shared bond, whatever\nit may be, be better for both of us?\nAnd what stronger incentive could there\nbe than to do that in relationships?\nRomantic relationships, the ones that\nare closest to us, if they're not\nromantic, they could be friendships.\nWhatever our closest relationships are,\nthey're the most important vehicles,\nso to speak, to better health and\nhappiness, to getting to that place\nof peace and contentment and delight.\nThe us is very, very powerful.\nIn fact, even more powerful\nthan the I and the you.\nAndrew Huberman: When thinking about\nthe us and trying to understand why\nsomebody that we know and are in\nrelationship with is behaving the way\nthey are or might be feeling or claiming\nthey feel the way that they are.\nHow useful do you think it is for\nus to put ourselves in their shoes?\nI can think of all sorts of ways\nin which this could be beneficial.\nI can also think of all sorts of ways\nin which it would be focusing off the\nself and our own experience in ways that\nmight be defensive avoidance or denial.\nYeah, I'll come clean.\nI mean, there have been plenty of times\nin relationship where I get fixated on\nwhy someone is the way they are, behaved\nthe way they did, and more often than not,\nby taking a step back and thinking about\nwhy my reaction to that is the way it is.\nI don't solve the \"problem,\" but I get a\nlot further along in terms of quelling my\nown anxiety and finding a path forward.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nWell, mentalization, which is the\nability to discern feeling states,\nintention states in self and others.\nBut now we're looking for others, right?\nSo the ability to understand feeling\nstates, what's going on inside of you?\nIntention.\nWhat are your intentions?\nThat should only be good, because if\nwe're seeing it through a clear lens,\nmeaning a lens that's not biased by\nsome problem, like a defense mechanism\nof rationalization, for example, or of\nprojection, if we're seeing clearly,\nwe're learning about the other.\nAnd the learning is never bad.\nKnowledge, truth is good.\nSo if we learn about the other by,\nin that sense, putting ourselves in\ntheir shoes, then we gain information.\nBut it's the health in us that\nis so crucial to what we do\nwith that information, right?\nSo one person could say, put themselves\nin the other person's shoes and\nthey can say, okay, that person, I\ncan see that person's responding.\nAnd they say, pretty calm,\npretty calm about something.\nAnd maybe that's just a good thing.\nMaybe there's some contention going\non and that person's maintaining\ntheir cool and that person is going\nto be really helpful in navigating\nan argument or a disagreement to\nsome really positive endpoint.\nSo, if a person sees clearly,\nokay, I can see that you're calm.\nAnd I also see that you're trying to\nfigure things out and the things that\nyou're saying are sort of positive.\nYou're disagreeing with me,\nbut you don't seem to mean ill.\nThen I can see, you know what?\nI think your calm is good, because I'm\ngetting a little bit upset and you're not.\nAnd I see that there's\na benevolence in you.\nSo maybe you'll guide us to the\np lace that maybe I can't, right?\nBut think about if there's\nnot a clear lens inside of me.\nIf I have a defense system that leads\nme to externalize, responsibility that\nleads me to project or leads me to do\nall sorts of things that are not healthy.\nNow I might think, well, you're calm\nbecause you just don't care about me.\nI mean, so think of the same exact thing.\nNow in the example we're giving the person\nin your position is like being really\nbenign and benevolent, but it happens\nall the time where that is misconstrued.\nSo it's not that the insight,\nthat person is calm, I see that\nthey're calm, it's that there's\na deficit in the mentalization.\nThe person is not fully\nunderstanding their intention.\nWhat's coming through then gets distorted.\nSo, we think about defense mechanisms.\nThey can be clear, they can let light\nthrough in this beautiful way that has\nfidelity, or they can be very distorting.\nSo the thought that, if I'm discerning\nthat you are benevolent and you seem to be\ntrying to solve the problem for us, but I\ntake in and you just don't care about me\nand you're trying to put one over on me.\nIf I've assessed it accurately,\nbut it comes on the other\nend in a way that's changed.\nThat's because there's a lack of\nclarity , there's distortion inside of me.\nRight?\nSo then if I'm really working on\nmyself, I'm in the best place I\ncan be, I'm going to be better\nat mentalizing about you and me.\nEven if I say, well, we're having a\ndisagreement, I know I tend to get\na little defensive, so I'm going t\no be a little biased to see w hat's\nin you in a kind of negative way.\nSo what am I seeing like, okay, you're\npretty calm, maybe you don't care.\nI know I can think that, right?\nBut come on, you're trying.\nYou want to solve our problem.\nImagine when that goes on inside\nof a person, which sometimes\ngoes on consciously or goes on\nunconsciously or some mixture.\nIt's so powerful.\nThe person is aware of their own state,\nwhich helps them to be aware of the\nstate of the others, of the other.\nAnd then the information they're\ngetting comes through with fidelity.\nAnd now all of a sudden, instead of\nmaybe I'm going to blow things up now\nI'm allying with you in solving our\nproblem because I see clearly about you\nand me and that's going on all the time.\nIt might sound, well, it's complicated.\nThere's a lot of back and forth, right?\nThere are millions of things\ngoing on every split second in our\nunconscious mind that is throwing\nall this up to the conscious mind.\nIt's doing things rapidly that's\ngoing on all the time in us, whether\nwe want to acknowledge it or not.\nAnd we choose not to acknowledge it at our\nown peril because then we're not going to\nthose two pillars and their 10 cupboards.\nWe're not going to the structure of\nself, the function of self, and what\ncomprises those two pillars to look for.\nHey, what's going on?\nRight, let me understand better.\nAnd even if things are going well, we\ncan always, as you said not that long\nago, we can understand ourselves better.\nThe stronger I am, the more generative\ndrive there is in me, the less\ndefensiveness, the more the agency and\nthe gratitude, the more I'm armed for\nwhatever difficult thing comes my way.\nSo if there's a conflict with\nsomeone, w hether there should be or\nthere shouldn't b e, maybe someone's\nbeing really aggressive and I've\ngot to kind of say some things\nand try and counter that, right?\nI'm going to be able to\ndiscern one from another.\nI'm going to be more effective in both.\nI just set myself up for success,\nand if I'm setting me up for success,\nthen I'm also setting you up for\nsuccess if you're someone I have a\nrelationship with, no matter what it is.\nAnd then ultimately I'm setting the\nwe right, the magical bridge of us.\nI'm setting that up for success too.\nAnd that's how you see in these\nlevels of emergence, that if you\nunderstand everything about you and\nunderstand everything about me, and\nlet's say a person understands we\nhave a generative drive, you don't\nreally know what our relationship is\ngoing to be like, but you think, I bet\nit's going to be a good one, right?\nAnd then what would we then\ncontribute, s ay, to a broader culture?\nSo a group of people, maybe there's\n10 people, a bunch of friends getting\ntogether, we would contribute goodness\nat that next level, which is then\nthe culture o f the larger group.\nAndrew Huberman: In hearing your\ndescription of mentalization, this\nability for all of us to get into\nthe mind of another and to try\nand imagine motivations and states\nthat would explain their behavior--\nPaul Conti: And the self, right?\nThe mind of self and other.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, that seems\nlike a natural reflex that's healthy.\nAnd it seems to surface most\noften as the consequence of\nnegative interactions, right?\nSomething didn't go right.\nAnd so we kind of explore\nlike, was it them?\nWas it me?\nWas it something that happened before?\nWhat else is going on with this person\nas a way to try and arrive at some sort\nof hopefully generative understanding.\nBut it seems to me that there's also\ngreat value in mentalizing about others\nunder conditions in which things are\ngoing well, so that one can potentially\nmake things or encourage things to go\neven better in future interactions.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nWell, the first thing I would\nsay i s, I think the reflex\nis most often not mentalizing.\nThat the reflex is most often\nnot mentalizing, r ight?\nBecause the reflexes often come\nfrom a position of not feeling safe.\nThere's some conflict.\nI don't feel good.\nIf there's some conflict, people, we\noften get very defensive very quickly,\nwhether we show it on the outside\nor we start partitioning inside.\nAnd the problems come not from\nmentalizing, but they come from\nnot mentalizing and not being\naware of the difference, because\nthen I conclude, I know what's\ngoing on in you and I don't right.\nBecause I don't know\nwhat's going on in me.\nRight.\nAnd I think you're being aggressive.\nReally.\nI'm feeling kind of defensive.\nI'm feeling vulnerable, and\nthen I'm getting aggressive.\nBut I can't handle that because\nI don't want to be aggressive.\nSo you're aggressive.\nSo there's such a difference between, say,\ncoming at a self other conflict from the\nperspective of, say, not mentalizing, but\nthinking that you are versus mentalizing.\nThere's a difference between, is it me?\nI know it can't be.\nIs it you?\nIt must be.\nRight?\nAnd that's how a lot of that goes.\nAnd then, of course, what's the\ndata t hat's gathered, the data\nthat's gathered supports that.\nI mean, I think there's wars I\nthink have happened based upon\nthis, let alone conflicts in\nfriendships and in relationships.\nThe key about mentalizing\nis that's not what it is.\nMentalizing.\nIt goes like this.\nIs it me?\nIs it you?\nIs it us?\nLet's figure that out.\nLet's figure it out together.\nIt's not defensive, it's not aggressive.\nIt's not projecting.\nIt's really actually seeing.\nAnd look, if it's me, I want to be\naware of it and say, yeah, like, whoa,\nI got up on the wrong side of the bed.\nLet me just say I'm sorry, right?\nOr if I might say, look, I know\nthat you're being aggressive and\nyou normally wouldn't be, and say,\nlook, let me just get away from it?\nLet the person I care about\ncalm down, come back later.\nOr if it's us, is really something\nb etween us, then let's sort it out.\nThe information that allows the healthy,\nthe agency and gratitude decisions\nis always there through mentalizing.\nThe danger is when we're not\nmentalizing, but we think we are.\nAndrew Huberman: Got it.\nIn keeping with thinking about\nothers and what's going on with them.\nMentalizing, that is, and in thinking\nabout what's going on with ourselves and\nthe exploration of the cupboards under\nthe pillars of structure of self, function\nof self and our desire for all of that\nto geyser up into agency and gratitude.\nOne thing that we hear about so\nmuch these days, and generally I\nthink it's good that people are\ntalking about them, are boundaries.\nYou've crossed my boundary,\nor I'm setting a boundary.\nAnd I've certainly embedded the\nmessage in my head that in order\nfor certain relationships to be\nat their most loving in my life,\nsometimes the boundaries require very\nlittle frequency of communication.\nBut that doesn't mean the\nrelationships aren't ongoing.\nSo what are your thoughts on boundaries?\nAnd how should we think about boundaries\nfor the sake of healthy relationships?\nPaul Conti: Well, healthy\nboundaries always start inside.\nAnd then once we have them squared away\ninside, we can project them outward.\nThe same as everything works, right?\nIt starts with the self, and\nthen it includes the other.\nSo let's say you took an\nexample of a friend who's just\na little too presumptuous.\nLike the kind of person you'd rather k\nnock on your door, but who just opens the\ndoor and comes in, that kind of thing.\nAnd you like the person a lot, and\nthere's a lot of resonance, and you\ndon't want to lose the friendship.\nLet's imagine what could happen here.\nIt's not the only thing that can\nhappen, but a thought experiment, right?\nSo the person may then question\nthemselves, like, is there\nsomething wrong with me?\nBecause I don't really like this\nperson coming in my front door.\nIs that just me?\nAm I being weird about that?\nOr the person can kind of stop\nand think about that, and they can\ntake stock of self, and they can\narrive at an answer for themselves.\nLike, look, that person may\nconclude that, you know what?\nPeople I'm as close to as this\nperson come in my front door.\nYou know what?\nThat's okay, right?\nYou know what?\nI don't need to set a boundary there.\nThat's possible, right?\nMore often, what the person concludes\nis, no, I don't really want that.\nI do actually want this\nperson to knock on the door.\nAnd that's okay.\nThere's not something wrong with me.\nIt's not that I'm being a jerk.\nIt's not that I'm being\na bad friend, right?\nBecause what are they saying?\nYou might say, oh, they're preparing\nfor what the other person could\nsay, but no, they're countering what\nthey're testing out to themselves.\nDoes that mean I'm a bad friend?\nNo, right?\nThat kind of thing.\nSo they know, and then they\nunderstand, and they have the\nright to set the boundary, right?\nLike, okay, it's my house.\nI try to be generous, but I still\ndon't want people coming in the door.\nLike, you come to some conclusion\nthat setting the boundary is okay and\nyou're squared away with it inside.\nThen you communicate the boundary\noutward, and you decide, how\ndo I want to communicate that?\nLike saying, hey, man, don't\ncome in the front door anymore.\nThat's not so good right now, the\nfriendship is really on the rocks, right?\nBut to say to someone something like,\nyeah, look, I care about you, and I trust\nyou, and I know you feel the same way\nabout me, but it just makes me nervous\nwhen people just come in the door.\nDo you mind?\nIs it okay if you just\nplease knock on the door now?\nThink about how that's been done.\nIt's so accurate to what's going on inside\nthe person, to how the person wants to\ncommunicate with the other, then you have\nthe highest likelihood of effectiveness.\nAnd the person also, in that sense, has\nsort of the clean conscience, so to speak,\nthat lets them take in information back.\nSo let's say the other person hopefully\nhas a high generative drive and\nall the good things we're talking\nabout could say, oh, I'm sorry.\nI didn't mean to make\nyou feel uncomfortable.\nI kind of just automatically do that,\nor I always do that at my brother's\nhouse when it's close by or whatever.\nThe person is saying, no worries,\nokay, everything is fine.\nRight?\nBut let's say that\nperson does get mad now.\nYou know, like, whoa, what's\ngoing on in this person?\nBecause what you're doing is you're seeing\nsigns of unhealth in the other person.\nAnd it may be that, whoa, that's\nnot so healthy with the person.\nBut I like other aspects of the\nfriendship, and that seems like\nkind of a strange idiosyncrasy.\nThen you might decide, you know what?\nI want to keep this friendship.\nSo I'll start locking the door, and the\nperson has to knock, or you might think,\nokay, am I seeing something here that's\nabout lack of consideration, right?\nThat's about selfishness.\nThat ultimately may be about envy.\nI'm going to walk into your\nhouse and ruin your privacy.\nI'm going to walk into your\nhouse and make you feel anxious.\nI feel entitled to do that.\nThe kind of thing that's really\ncoming through the lens of envy.\nSo then you start thinking about\nthat, and maybe not always.\nOf course, sometimes you find a\nfriend who can do the right thing.\nSometimes you find a friend who can't, and\nyou can still make the friendship work.\nSometimes you find a person who's not\na friend, and you see, like, oh, that's\nhow e verything is with this person.\nYou realize, like, there's no us.\nThere's no us, right.\nAnd that's how people can leave\nrelationships that ultimately are\nexploitive in one way or another.\nWhether it's a friendship, it's a romance,\nif a person really understands, there's\nthe me, the you, the magical bridge of us.\nAnd then, wait, there's\nno magical bridge of us.\nI feel that there's a magical bridge\nof us, but the other person doesn't.\nThere's immense power of\nunderstanding and then of appropriate\nself care and self protection.\nAndrew Huberman: Over and over again.\nNot just during today's episode,\nbut in the previous two episodes.\nIt seems that getting squared away\nwith oneself, or at least one's own\ninternal processes to some degree,\ngaining some insight as to where the\nnegative or even positive emotion\nwithin us is arising when we're in\nrelationship to anyone or anything.\nIt just seems so key.\nIt's like the foundation of it.\nYou said getting to the maximum amount of\nagency and gratitude is the goal, really.\nAnd that's done by cycling back\nthrough the cupboards that reside under\nstructure of self and function of self.\nAnd asking questions about oneself.\nAnd really, unless we are trained\npsychiatrists like you, none of\nus really should be doing that\nfor the other person, it seems.\nThis is really each and all of\nour own responsibility to do for\nourselves, but that it serves\nothers in so many positive ways.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nRight.\nSo mentalization greases the\nprogress of all things good.\nBecause it is about actual understanding,\nfeeling states, intentions.\nBut I have to first mentalize about\nme before I mentalize about you.\nA way of putting this would be, if I'm\nthinking about you before I'm thinking\nabout me, I'm on a fool's errand.\nYou have to start with the self.\nAnd to try and attain clarity of self.\nOr to realize that you can't.\nIt's a very important nuance.\nIf I know that, say there's trauma\nin me about a certain thing.\nAnd I know that I respond in ways\nwhere sometimes my emotions get high.\nAnd I can't quite think through it\nall, which can happen to me with\nreferences or something that's\nencompassing a certain kind of trauma.\nI want to be aware of that, right?\nSo this idea of not only being aware\nof what you know about yourself, but\nbeing aware that there are things\nyou don't know about yourself.\nSo if I know enough to know that\na certain kind of interaction\nabout a certain kind of trauma.\nReally sets me to a place where I'm\nnot able to mentalize like I normally\nwould be, I'm sort of flying blind.\nThen, good for me to know that, because\nI don't know what that's doing to me.\nSo it's the last time to make conclusions.\nSo let's say I'm in that state.\nLet's say I'm in that state because of\nsomething that just happened, and now\nwe have some sort of conflict, right?\nThen for me to realize, like,\nwell, what's going on in me?\nI'm bringing to this a lack of clarity\nbecause I'm really activated, right.\nIn that sense, the anxiety, the\ntension in me has been raised.\nThe negative emotion, that\nreflexive, negative affect, feeling\nemotion has been raised in me.\nAnd then I realize, like, I don't know\nhow it's going to go if we interact\nabout it now because I can't rely on me.\nSo, like, hey, can we\ntalk about this later?\nThe same way if you recognize\nin the other that person who's\nusually rational is all worked up,\nrecognize that in the other, right?\nA nd maybe that person doesn't realize\nthat they still want to interact.\nAnd you say, let's revisit this.\nWe're both kind of calm,\ncool and collected, right?\nSo mentalization greases the wheels of\nall progress, but like anything else\nhas to be deployed in a way that works.\nAnd the way that works is I start with\nme, then I go to you, and then I go to us.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm fully on\nboard the start with me, then to\nthe other, and then to us model.\nIt makes total sense.\nIn fact, so much so that I'm starting to\nbuild an image of my mind, where first\nis kind of a rule, which is it starts\nwith self understanding, thoughtful,\nstructured inquiry along the lines of\nthe map that was laid out in episodes\none and two of this series and that we've\nbeen alluding to numerous times today.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: And then there's a\nsecond line or rule that I've got written\non this imaginary piece of paper in my\nmind, where anytime I default to thinking\nabout another without first going to\nmy own map and exploring what's going\non with me, that my own map starts to\nbecome blurry, like I'm losing access to\nit and it potentially could disappear.\nI'm just creating this in my own\nmind as a way to create a little\nbit of, I think, healthy anxiety.\nPaul Conti: I like it.\nAndrew Huberman: To really go\nthere first, paints the picture.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: And the purpose in having\nsuch an image in my mind, that access\nto the self and understanding of self is\npotentially drifting away, is because I\nthink, for me, there's a third line in\nthis rule set that I'm imagining, which\nis that the less understanding we have\nof our own map and internal process,\nthe more likely I am, or we all are,\nto just latch on to an unhealthy map.\nAnother unhealthy map.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nI have to even follow the directions\no f our own unhealthy map.\nWhich leads us to someone else's\nunhealthy map, and then we\nlatch onto it, like you said.\nYeah, absolutely.\nYes.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, that's right.\nBecause it's still active, even\nif it's blurry or if it's obscured\nfrom my awareness and drifting away.\nPaul Conti: So if I'm trying to guide\nmyself with my broken compass, I run\ninto someone else with a broken compass.\nNow we're both wandering, so be aware.\nIf the compass isn't working the way\nwe want it to, can we go look at that?\nCan we make the map healthy, make\nthe map accurate, make the map\nguide us towards what we want?\nBecause then we will find other people\nwho've worked on their own maps that way.\nAndrew Huberman: Absolutely.\nAnd so often I hear about, and\nfrankly, I've experienced this\nfeeling like, oh, it's just a matter\nof finding somebody who is healthy.\nRight?\nAnd then things will be\nmuch easier and much better.\nAnd surely that has to be the case.\nAnd surely there have to be instances\nwhere people have an interaction\nwith somebody that leads to a\nrelationship with somebody and the\nother person is much healthier.\nAnd whatever trauma we come to the\nrelationship with is best supported\nor better supported than it would be\nif we were with somebody exploitative\nor who was truly damaged in some\nway, who basically had a map that was\nreally, I don't want to say screwed\nup, but that they had not explored.\nPaul Conti: They need a lot of work.\nAndrew Huberman: They need a lot of\nwork, but I don't see that very often.\nI definitely see people who, at least\nfrom my outside read, seem to have healthy\nmaps or are doing regular exploration\nof their maps and therefore healthy.\nWho knows?\nI don't know what they do with\ntheir time in every domain of life.\nBut once again, we come back to this\nimportance of understanding what's\nin those cupboards, what's in those\npillars, as a not just important but\ncritical step in understanding and\nbuilding ourselves in positive ways.\nAnd as I said once or twice before in this\nseries, but I'm going to say it again,\nand I'm sure again and again before we\nconclude this series, is that what's\nso attractive about this map is that\nit sets a very clear and simple set of\nideals, not necessarily simple to attain.\nAnd as you've said, it takes time,\nbut agency, concept and gratitude,\nempowerment, humility, leading up\nto peace, contentment and delight,\nall as action states, not as passive\nstates to just bask in and disappear.\nAnd this notion of the generative drive.\nAnd by now, in this episode, I'm sure\npeople are well on board the understanding\nthat the generative drive is not just\nabout going out and doing things.\nIt's about doing things in service to\nand in a way that supports learning,\nknowing, creating, not just of\nothers and in the world, but inside.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nI love the map imagery because you can\nalmost see the map changing, right?\nAs the person, I imagine the person\nis busying away in the cupboards.\nOh, there's a lot to\nwork on in this cupboard.\nAnd they're busying away and they're doing\nthe work, and we can see the map changing.\nThat path that looked like a really\ngood path actually goes through a swamp.\nWe didn't see the swamp on the map.\nNow it appears on the map.\nThat other path that looked\nlike it's a little circuitous.\nThat's a good path.\nIt might be a harder path.\nIt is a little circuitous, but\nlook where it leads, right?\nThe map becomes clear as we\ndo the work on ourselves.\nAndrew Huberman: Yes.\nAnd also the understanding that you've\nlaid out for us here really helps\navoid a lot of the common pitfalls that\nare associated with sticky language.\nAnd sticky for good reason.\nI mean, what's stickier and more\ninteresting for people that are interested\nin themselves, in relationship than\nthings like boundaries or labels like\nanxious, attached, or secure, attached.\nAnd I'm not being disparaging of\nthose labels, but I'm realizing\nthose are just labels, right?\nThey don't define action items and\nspecific lines of inquiry to get us back\ninto our self understanding over and over.\nNot as a full time job, right?\nWe all have to live our lives, but\nas a way actually to be more leaned\ninto life in the outside world.\nPaul Conti: Those labels define people no\nbetter than the numerical diagnoses in the\npsychiatric taxonomy book that we glorify.\nLabels are not understanding.\nNumbers are not understanding.\nThey can help.\nTaxonomies are good.\nSometimes labels let us categorize\nthings, but labels are not a\nsubstitute for understanding.\nNumbers are not a substitute\nfor understanding.\nIf we look at ourselves, we get\nreal understanding, and that's\nwhat makes the difference.\nThat's what bolsters agency,\ngratitude, all those good things.\nClear mentalization, greasing\nthe wheels of progress more, the\ngenerative drive getting stronger.\nWe really can find goodness, and often do.\nAnd that's why I think everything\nwe're t alking about is very hopeful.\nIt acknowledges there's complexity.\nThere are pitfalls.\nThere are all sorts of things to it that\nwe need to be aware of and to beware of.\nBut that doesn't mean that ultimately\nit isn't positive that we're not\nspeaking to, hey, whatever it is that's\nailing you, that thing can be better.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, I'm so grateful\nthat you're sharing your knowledge and\nexperience around all of this with us\nand that you've laid out such a clear\nand logical and deep and tractable,\nreally actionable understanding\nof all this that we can engage in.\nIt's tremendously powerful.\nPaul Conti: Thank
