    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine\ntoday we are discussing music and your\nbrain however this episode could have\njust as easily been entitled music is\nyour brain or your brain is music and\nthat's because music believe it or not\nis a neurological phenomenon most of us\nthink of music as something that happens\noutside of us the sounds we hear the\nlyrics we hear their meaning how they\nanchor us to pieces of our history both\nemotional or social\nit turns out that when we listen to\nmusic it activates nearly every piece of\nour brain moreover when we listen to\nmusic it activates our brain in ways\nthat our brain itself and indeed our\nbody as well helped to create that music\nat the level of so-called neural\nensembles that is the firing of neurons\nin other words when we listen to music\nour brain and our body become part of\nthe instrument that contributes to our\nperception of that music today I'm going\nto make clear how all of that happens we\nwill also discuss how music can be\nleveraged towards shifting our brain\nStates and our bodily States for\ninstance what sorts of music to listen\nto in order to make ourselves happy yes\nStudies have been done on that as well\nas how long to listen to music in order\nto shift our mood or our overall bodily\nState including how to process feelings\nof sadness many of you are probably\nfamiliar with particular songs that\nanchor us to particular times in our\nhistory or people in our history and\nthere's an age-old question really as to\nwhether or not listening to sad music\ncan help us process our feelings of\nsadness or whether or not they drive us\nfurther down the spiral of sadness and\ndespair and indeed Studies have explored\nthis as well so today I will explain how\nmusic indeed how different types of\nmusic activate different neural circuits\nin your brain to create different brain\nand bodily States how we can leverage\nmusic toward things like emotional\nprocessing shifting our emotions as well\nas to enhance learning and memory and we\nwill also talk about the use of music to\nenhance brain plasticity that is your\nbrain's ability to change in response to\nexperience not just in response to that\nmusic but rather using music as a tool\nto expand our capacity for\nneuroplasticity giving us the ability to\nlearn far more in other contexts and\nareas of life I confess that in\nresearching this episode I found myself\ncontinually delighted as to first of all\nhow impressive the science of the study\nof Music in the brain is and secondly\nhow fundamental music is to all of our\nlives and this is true whether or not\nyou're somebody who listens to music\noften or you're somebody that really for\nsilence indeed we will talk about\nwhether or not it's better to listen to\nmusic or remain in silence when you\nperform certain kinds of work it turns\nout that there's a very clear answer to\nthat if you want a little bit of a Hint\nit is best to listen to music in between\nbouts of work or during brief rest\nperiods as opposed to listening to music\nwhile you work and for those of you that\nlisten to music while you work and\nthoroughly enjoy listening to music\nwhile you work we will also discuss what\nthat means about your brain in\nparticular because it's likely that it\ngot wired up that way at a particular\nphase of development and each and all of\nyou can learn today how to best leverage\nmusic toward productivity but perhaps\nequally important how to leverage music\nfor enrichment and enjoyment of life I'm\npleased to announce that we will be\nhosting three live events in Australia\nall three events will cover science and\nscience related tools for mental health\nphysical health and performance there\nwill also be a Live question and answer\nsession the first live event will take\nplace on February 10th in Melbourne at\nthe plenary theater\nthe second live event will take place on\nFebruary 17th in Sydney at the Sydney\nOpera House and the third event will\ntake place on February 23rd in Brisbane\nat the Great Hall to access tickets to\nany of these events simply go to\nhubermanlab.com tour and use the code\nhuberman I hope to see you there and\nlast but certainly not least thank you\nfor your interest in science before we\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\neight sleep eight sleep makes Smart\nmattress covers with cooling Heating and\nsleep tracking capacity\nspoken many times before on this podcast\nabout the fact that sleep that is\ngetting enough quality sleep each night\nis the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance one of\nthe key things to getting a great\nnight's sleep is to make sure that your\nbody temperature drops by about one to\nthree degrees at the beginning of the\nnight indeed that is how your body falls\nand stays deeply asleep as well in order\nto wake up in the morning feeling\nrefreshed your bodily temperature needs\nto increase by about one to three\ndegrees eight Sleep mattress covers make\nit extremely easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nallowing you to fall and stay deeply\nasleep throughout the night and to wake\nup feeling refreshed I started sleeping\non an eight-sleep mattress cover well\nover two years ago and it has completely\ntransformed my sleep it's allowed me to\nfall asleep more quickly it's allowed me\nto sleep more deeply throughout the\nnight and if I happen to wake up during\nthe middle of the night something that's\nperfectly normal to do once or even\ntwice I fall back asleep far more\nquickly and I wake up feeling refreshed\nas a consequence my mood focus and\nalertness throughout the day is greatly\nelevated as compared to prior to\nsleeping on my eight Sleep mattress\ncover if you'd like to try an\neight-sleep mattress cover you can go

today's\nepisode is also brought To Us by Roca\nRoca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are the absolute highest quality\nI've spent a lifetime working on the\nbiology the visual system and I can tell\nyou that your visual system has to\ncontend with an enormous number of\nchallenges in order for you to be able\nto see clearly in different environments\nRoka understands the biology of the\nvisual system and has designed their\neyeglasses and sunglasses so that you\nalways see with Crystal Clarity\noriginally their glasses were designed\nfor performance that is for running and\ncycling and for sport and indeed they\ncan still be used for performance they\nwon't slip off your face if you get\nsweaty they're extremely lightweight but\nI should mention that Roca eyeglasses\nand sunglasses come in some of the\nAesthetics more typically associated\nwith performance glasses like those\ncyborg Style I have glasses but they\nalso have a number of styles that you\nwould be perfectly comfortable wearing\nout to dinner or to work I wear readers\nat night or when I drive and I wear\nsunglasses during the day if I happen to\nbe driving into bright light or outside\nand it's just overwhelmingly bright I do\nnot wear sunglasses when I do my morning\nsunlight viewing to set my circadian\nrhythm and I suggest that you do the\nsame if you'd like to try

let's\ntalk about music and your brain and to\nstart off I just want to take a step\nback and acknowledge something that is\nabsolutely remarkable about music which\nis\nif you think about language\nI could describe to you a glass I could\ndescribe to you an apple I could\ndescribe to you a story I could describe\nto you a face I could describe to you\nany number of different things and you\ncould do the same for me language is\nessentially infinite in the number of\nthings that it can explain and the ways\nthat it can explain it\nand yet if you think about music music\nprovided there are no lyrics in that\nmusic can't explain how a glass is\nshaped it can't even tell you that\nthere's a glass present in the room or\non a table it can't tell you what a face\nlooks like it can't tell you what that\nperson who owns that face did or is\ndoing so in some ways you might think\nwow music is fairly diminished in terms\nof its qualitative depth compared to\nlanguage\nand yet if you take a step back and\nthink about what music can do it's\nastonishing and it actually overwhelms\nWhat language can do what can music do\nwell even in the absence of any lyrics\nany words put to music music can\ndescribe an emotion in fact music can\ndescribe numerous types of emotions and\nthey can do it with a lot of nuance so\nnot just displaying for us happy or sad\nbut rather different degrees of\nHappiness different degrees of Sadness\nmusic can be used to convey a sense of\nlonging a sense of nostalgia a sense of\ndelight a sense of awe and on and on so\nwhereas music can't describe nouns very\nwell it can beautifully describe\nemotions\nand not only can music describe emotions\nwith a tremendous degree of nuance music\ncan evoke emotions with a tremendous\ndegree of nuance\nnow this is spectacular and it's not\nonly spectacular it is important because\nas we move through today's episode\nyou'll soon come to realize that it's\nvery likely\nand indeed we have a lot of scientific\nevidence to support the fact that music\nevolved prior to spoken language\nmoreover it's very likely that singing\nevolved prior to spoken language and\nthat music singing and dance together\nevolved prior to language making music\nas well as singing and dance but really\njust music even on its own in the\nabsence of any lyrics or any bodily\nmovement as the fundamental form of\nhuman communication indeed music can\nevoke empathy again we're talking about\nmusic in the absence of any lyrics When\nI Say music can evoke empathy I'm not\ntalking about the sort of empathy where\nyou look at somebody and Nod and\nunderstand so-called cognitive empathy\nwhich is important by the way in\nrelational Dynamics or emotional empathy\nwhere you're actually feeling what the\nother person is feeling but of course\nyou never really know what somebody else\nis feeling how could you you can only\nhave a sense of what they might be\nfeeling\nand you have a sense of what you're\nfeeling but let's be honest um as one of\nour prior guests on the huberman Lab\npodcast Dr Carl dyseroff so aptly noted\nrarely do we ever understand how anyone\nelse truly feels because indeed rarely\ndo we ever understand how we ourselves\ntruly feel and certainly with language\nit's very hard to explain our feelings\nwith words in a way that can convey the\nway that we feel with the kind of nuance\nthat represents our own reality even in\na state of extreme happiness or extreme\nsadness words fall short of explaining\nhow we feel inside and yet as I\nmentioned earlier music not only can\ndescribe emotions it can evoke emotions\nwithin us and in doing so it can evoke\nemotions that give us a sense of empathy\nfor the person playing the music or\nsimply for others in the world and music\ncan do that so powerfully because not\nonly does music come in through our ears\nand we'll talk about the process of how\nsound is converted into what we perceive\nas music in a little bit because indeed\nit comes in through our ears and we can\nhear that music of course but the nerve\ncells the neurons in your brain as well\nas the nerve cells in your body\ncan become activated by music in a way\nthat the firing of those neurons\nliterally the frequency of those neural\nimpulses comes to match the frequency of\nthe sounds that you're hearing in your\noutside environment in other words when\nyou listen to music not only is that\nmusic coming into your body through your\nsense organs your your hearing but your\nbody itself is an instrument playing\nthat music from within so for instance\nif you listen to a piece of music that\nhas a lightness to it that evokes a\nsense in you of the Turning of the\nseasons from Winter to Spring and\nsomething that's common in certain\nclassical music but other forms of music\nas well\nwhen you hear that music indeed it's\ncoming in through your ears but also the\nfiring of the neurons in your brain and\nbody responding to those particular\nfrequencies of sound is such that your\nbody itself is an instrument playing\nthat sense of the Turning of the seasons\nfrom Winter to Spring within you which\nis why your body starts to feel lifted\nin some cases or it starts to feel a\nlightness in some cases and an entire\nset of emotions starts to be recruited\nthat at least for you resemble the\nTurning of the seasons from Winter to\nspring now that may sound rather complex\nbut we're going to break that process\ndown into its component parts but what I\nessentially just said is that when you\nlisten to music not only are you hearing\nthat music but your body that is your\nneurons and indeed your hormones as well\nthings like oxytocin and some other\nhormones in your brain and body that\nwe'll discuss are contributing to a\nsymphony of emotion from within your\nbody and brain okay so while music can't\nexplain objects it can't describe them\nit can explain in a very nuanced ways\nemotions and it can evoke emotions\nwithin us now if that's not amazing\nenough music can not only describe and\nevoke emotions it can also imply intent\nthink for instance about drumming that\nyou would hear off in the distance and\nwe're not talking about\nwe're talking drumming of this sort\nand perhaps the Cadence of that drumming\nchanges such that as it's approaching it\ngets more and more frequent\nwhat is the intent being implied well we\nknow from numerous studies and you know\nfrom numerous movies that you've seen\nand heard that that sort of low\nfrequency drumming of increasing Cadence\nas it approaches is implying the intent\nof aggression or War\nor at least is implying that something\nserious is going to happen now contrast\nthat with a different frequency of sound\nplayed at a higher case done\nnow\nthe second set of tones\nare far less clear in terms of what they\nmean what their intent is but if we\ncontrast them with let's just call them\nwhat they're typically called the war\ndrums or the drums that that convey a\nsense of aggressive intent\nwhat we create then is a juxtaposition\nof two different emotional states in you\nperhaps or maybe you don't respond to\nthose with any robust emotional shift\nbut we are conveying two separate or\ndistinct sets of intent\nnow of course spoken language can convey\nintent I could say for instance you know\nI'm going to help you how can I help you\ntoday or I could say I'm gonna hurt you\nright of course with spoken language you\ncould do that and you could change the\nintonation of that language you change\nthe frequency so if I were to say I'm\ngoing to hurt you it's very different\nthan if I say I'm gonna hurt you okay or\nif I put it as a question I'm gonna hurt\nyou okay so with language of course\nthere's also the opportunity for a lot\nof nuance depending on where the\ninflections where the accents are on a\nparticular phrase even a particular word\nbut with music as you recall\nwhen we convey a sense of intent we are\nalso conveying that sense of intent\nthrough the body of The Listener not\njust bringing it in through their ears\nand so when we do that what we do is we\nstart to recruit a huge number of neural\ncircuits that are involved not just in\nunderstanding or a sense of empathy for\nan emotion but rather that can recruit\nmovement or what we call pre-motor\ncircuits in the body pre-motor circuits\nare the neurons that start to fire\nbefore a particular pattern of action is\ngenerated and so when we hear music that\nconveys emotion that evokes emotion and\nespecially when we hear music that\nconveys a sense of intent from the\noutside we too start to feel as if we\nneed to move or respond to that music in\na particular way now what I just\ndescribed to you is not something that's\nlearned in fact it is innate how do we\nknow that well there are some beautiful\nstudies that have explored how babies\nrespond to music indeed how babies\nrespond to specific types of music\nspecific frequencies of sound spacing\nbetween particular notes and on and on\nit's been demonstrated for instance that\nbabies as young as three months old\nrespond to music very differently than\nthey respond to just other forms of\nsound scrambled in time now of course\nbabies that are three months old aren't\nspeaking so you could ask them does that\nsound like music how does it make you\nfeel Etc they're not going to answer at\nleast not with any coherence because\nthey don't have spoken language yet but\ndespite their absence of language we\nknow that babies as young as three\nmonths old respond to music because they\ndo so with rhythmic movements of their\nbodily Limbs and actually their torso as\nwell now a little bit later we will\ntouch on this issue of what types of\nmusic evoke movement of the Torso versus\nmovement of the limbs versus movement of\nthe Torso and limbs no I'm not going to\ndance for you during this podcast\nhowever there's a really interesting\nstory there that relates to how\nprimitive or evolved the motor neurons\nthe neurons that actually move the\nmusculature are and how primitive or\nevolved the music that one listens to is\nbut just to give you a sense of where\nthat's headed\nin this study where they examined the\nresponses of very young babies to music\nwhat they found is that certain\nfrequencies of sound evoked movements in\nthose babies that were rhythmic where it\nwas mostly their torso moving back and\nforth and maybe their head a little bit\nwhereas other patterns of sound\ndifferent frequencies in different\nArrangements\nevoked movement of their limbs more than\ntheir torso and still other patterns of\nsounds evoked movement of their torso\nLimbs and head in other words babies\ndancing and if you've ever been to a\nwedding or a party or been out dancing\nyou will see people who include more\ntorso versus limb versus limb and torso\nmovement when they dance and yes of\ncourse some of this relates to\nProficiency in dancing Comfort on the\nDance Floor\nEtc but there are some Universal rules\nout there about how certain frequencies\nand patterns of sound AKA music\nevokes different types of bodily\nmovements so starting from a very young\nage prior to any instruction in terms of\nhow to dance\nor what music is babies are dancing to\nmusic and that highlights an important\npoint that we will return to again and\nagain throughout today's episode which\nis that the systems of the brain that\nrespond specifically to movement not\njust sound but specifically to musical\nsounds are intimately tied to the neural\ncircuits of the body that generate\nmovement and this is especially\nimportant to understand when we get into\nour discussion about music and our sense\nof motivation okay so the list of\nincredible things that music can evoke\nwithin us by way of how it activates our\nnervous system and body is starting to\ngrow we've talked about how music can\nconvey emotion how music can evoke\nemotion and how music can convey a sense\nof intent as well now as how music can\ngenerate action within us this is a\npretty spectacular list if you think\nabout it\nin addition\nmusic causes changes within our bodily\nphysiology that extends beyond the\nnervous system although it has a\nrelationship to the nervous system\nin particular there's been a lot of\nstudies that have explored how music\nchanges things like our blood pressure\nor how fast our heart is beating our\nso-called resting heart rate\nand here we've made some important\ndiscoveries in recent years and when I\nsay we I don't mean my laboratory I mean\nLaboratories that focus on the\nrelationship between music and our\nbodily physiology because we've long\nknown that music can change various\nHealth metrics there are some really\nnice studies and I'll link to one or two\nof the meta-analyzes of these studies in\nthe show note captions that have showed\nthat if people listen to anywhere from\n10 to 30 minutes of Music per day and by\nthe way the selection of Music in these\nstudies ranged everything from Rock and\nRoll to classical music to country music\ntypically these studies would ask\nsubjects what their favorite music is\nand then they would have them listen to\nthat particular genre of music for\nanywhere from 10 to 30 minutes per day\nand if you look at the meta-analyzes of\nthose studies what you find is that\nalmost all of them see some sort of\nsignificant effect that is some\nstatistically significant shift in the\nbodily physiology of people that\ndeliberately listen to music for 10 to\n30 minutes per day\nnot while doing anything else but just\nlistening to that music they find for\ninstance that their resting heart rate\nis reduced if not during the period in\nwhich you're listening to the music then\nafter the time in which they're\nlistening to the music they find that\ntheir so-called heart rate variability\ntends to increase for those of you that\naren't familiar with heart rate\nvariability having increased heart rate\nvariability is a good thing and that's\nbecause heart rate variability reflects\nthe sort of push and pull or the balance\nrather of the activation of a so-called\nsympathetic nervous system which is the\none sometimes called the fight or flight\nsystem although I don't really like that\nnomenclature the sympathetic nervous\nsystem by the way is not about emotional\nsympathy it's what drives your heart\nrate higher it tends to put us into\nactivated states where we favor movement\nand motion and makes us alert whereas\nthe parasympathetic aspect of our\nnervous system is the portion of our\nautonomic nervous system sometimes\ncalled the rest and digest system the\nparasympathetic nervous system Drive\nstates of deeper relaxation of calm in\nany event heart rate variability\nreflects a periodic breaking a slowing\ndown of heart rate and breathing and\nother aspects of our neural system\nfunction that\nWorks alongside with sympathetic\nactivation think of sympathetic\nactivation as an accelerator\nparasympathetic activation is a break\nand when heart rate variability is\nhigher it reflects the fact that our\nparasympathetic nervous system is\nperiodically engaging it's getting\nactivated and slowing our heart rate\nslowing our breathing down music seems\nto have the effect of activating that\nparasympathetic aspect of our nervous\nsystem and so we are pumping the break\nevery once in a while slowing down our\nheart rate slowing down our breathing in\nother words when people listen to music\nfor a dedicated period of time each day\nof about 10 to 30 minutes some studies\nlooked at as much as 60 minutes but\ntypically 10 to 30 minutes what one\nfinds is that heart rate variability\nincreases not just during the period\nwhen they're listening to the music this\nis very important but also heart rate\nvariabilities increased Around the Clock\nin those subjects even during sleep\nmaking listening to 10 to 30 minutes of\nyour favorite music each day not just\nwhat I would think to be a enjoyable\nprotocol if you could even call it a\nprotocol it's so enjoyable to listen to\nyour favorite music that it feels almost\ninappropriate to call it a protocol\nbecause protocol sounds kind of rigid\nlike you're imposing that on yourself\nbut if you need an excuse to listen to\nyour favorite music for 10 to 30 maybe\n60 minutes per day and just attending to\nthat music not while doing anything else\nwhich is what these studies had subjects\ndo well indeed that's been shown to\nincrease heart rate variability Around\nthe Clock which we know is beneficial\nfor your mental and physical health more\ngenerally okay so there are dozens if\nnot hundreds of studies that have\nexplored how music impacts our\nphysiology and as I just mentioned it\nseems that if we listen to music that we\nlike for 10 to 30 maybe 60 minutes a day\nour physiology certain Health metrics\nheart rate variability in particular\nimprove now in light of the positive\neffects of listening to music on one's\nHealth there's a recent meta-analysis\nthat I found particularly interesting\nthe title of this meta-analysis is\neffects of Music on the cardiovascular\nsystem and it was published in Trends in\ncardiovascular medicine now from the\ntitle of this paper for effects of Music\non the cardiovascular system you might\nthink that it's just yet another\nmeta-analysis exploring how music\nimpacts heart rate variability and\nthings of that sort but what's\ninteresting about this study is that it\nidentifies that the way in which\nlistening to one's favorite music\npositively impacts the cardiovascular\nsystem and other aspects of our\nphysiology is very likely not through\ndirect changes on our heart rate simply\nby listening to music but rather through\nchanges in our breathing and this is\ntrue even if people were not singing\nalong with the music by the way now the\nrelationship between breathing and heart\nrate is something that I've touched on\nbefore but if you haven't heard me\ndiscuss this I'm just going to briefly\ntell you the relationship in two or\nthree sentences and then I'll explain\nthe mechanism also in about two to three\nsentences so if you have a background in\nbiology or even if you don't this will\nall be very simple and very clear\nwhen you deliberately inhale\nwith a lot of vigor or you deliberately\nmake your inhale longer than you\nnaturally would so for instance if I\nbreathe in very vigorously through my\nnose\nsomething very specific happens to your\nheart rate\nit increases whereas when you\ndeliberately exhale\nmeaning when you exhale and deliberately\nmake that exhale longer or you\ndeliberately add Vigor to that exhale\nor even a shorter deliberate more\nvigorous exhale\nyou slow down your heart rate and that's\nbecause of a phenomenon called\nrespiratory sinus arrhythmia which\nbecause it includes the word arrhythmia\nsounds like a bad thing but it's\nactually a wonderful thing it has to do\nwith the relationship between a\nparticular muscle in your body called\nthe diaphragm which when you inhale our\nlungs fill with air our diaphragm moves\ndown and our heart therefore has a\nlittle bit more space it actually gets\nbigger temporarily bigger but bigger and\nwhen it does that whatever volume of\nblood is in the Heart Is Now moving\nthrough a larger space so it's the same\namount of blood moving through a larger\nspace and the nervous system registers\nthat as the blood moving more slowly\nthrough that temporarily enlarged heart\nand as a consequence there's a signal\nsent through various Stations of the\nnervous system to the heart to speed the\nheart up in other words just as I said\nbefore when we inhale our heart rate\nspeeds up\nconversely when we exhale our lungs\nempty out some air our diaphragm moves\nup and as a consequence of that there's\nless space for the heart and so our\nheart temporarily becomes smaller and\nwhen that happens the volume of blood\nwithin that smaller heart moves more\nquickly and that's detected by the\nnervous system which then triggers a\nneural signal from the parasympathetic\narm of the autonomic nervous system\nwhich is just fancy nerd speak for a\nneural signal is sent to your heart\nevery time you exhale to slow your heart\ndown so the well-established effects of\nlistening to your favorite music\nincreasing your heart rate variability\nis not a direct interaction between the\nsounds coming in through your ears and\nchanges in your heart rate while you're\nlistening to the music that's actually\nwhat I would have thought happened but\nthis more recent meta-analysis pulls\napart the variables in these different\nstudies it really illustrates that when\nwe are listening to music We Are\nsubconsciously most of the times\nsubconsciously changing our patterns of\nbreathing we are inhaling in\nanticipation of certain things happening\nin the music we're exhaling when we feel\na relief of tension we get excited we\nmay get sad we may get happy we may even\njust be listening to music that we don't\nthink is impacting our physiology at\nsuch a core level but indeed it is music\nis able to Route into our nervous system\nat levels below our conscious awareness\nand literally turn the various knobs if\nyou will of our cardiovascular system of\nour breathing apparatus the diaphragm\nthe lungs it can evoke respiratory sinus\narrhythmia which again sounds like a\nterrible thing but is actually the\nreflection of a healthy nervous system\nin heart and in doing so yes it\nincreases heart rate variability\nsomething that is beneficial to all of\nus but it's doing so by changing our\npatterns of breathing so if you've ever\nwondered why music can change how you\nfeel so robustly well it's doing that at\na deep foundational level of your\nnervous system indeed at the levels of\nyour your nervous system that typically\nare not in your conscious awareness\nbecause I have to imagine that most of\nyou are probably not listening to music\nand thinking oh here comes that one\nchorus or here comes that one Melody and\nthis is where I always exhale or this is\nwhere I always hold my breath this sort\nof thing no most people are just\nlistening to music it's coming in\nthrough their ears they're experiencing\nsome bodily Sensations maybe they're\nmoving their torso arms maybe arms and\ntorso maybe you're not moving at all no\ndancing maybe just listening within your\nhead or maybe it's just dropped into the\nbackground below your conscious\nawareness at all and yet that music is\ncommunicating emotion it's evoking\nemotion it's communicating intent it's\nactivating those pre-motor circuits that\nwould have you move if it could and\nwe'll talk about dance a little bit\nlater but even if you're not dancing\neven if you're not swaying the tiniest\nbit your patterns of breathing are\nchanging and through respiratory sinus\narrhythmia your heart rate is changing\nand through changes in your heart rate\nyour heart rate variability is\nincreasing so if ever you want wanted a\ntooler protocol that was easy to use but\ncould positively impact your mental and\nphysical health well listening to your\nfavorite music for 10 to 30 maybe 60\nminutes maybe more per day is that\nprotocol as many of you know I've been\ntaking ag-1 daily since 2012. so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast ag1 is a vitamin mineral\nprobiotic drink that's designed to meet\nall of your foundational nutrition needs\nnow of course I try to get enough\nservings of vitamins and minerals\nthrough whole food sources that include\nvegetables and fruits every day but\noftentimes I simply can't get enough\nservings but with ag1 I'm sure to get\nenough vitamins and minerals and the\nprobiotics that I need and it also\ncontains adaptogens to help buffer\nstress simply put I always feel better\nwhen I take ag1 I have more focus and\nenergy and I sleep better and it also\nhappens to taste great for all these\nreasons whenever I'm asked if you could\ntake Just One supplement what would it\nbe I answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1\ngo to drinkag1.com huberman to claim a\nspecial offer they'll give you five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drinkag1.com\nhuberman so hopefully it's becoming\nclear just how absolutely powerful music\nis at evoking different physiological\nresponses within you that is within your\nbrain and body but there's an additional\none that I find particularly interesting\nbecause it addresses and indeed answers\none of the most common questions that I\nreceive all the time which is how can I\nget more motivated not how I Andrew can\nget more motivated although of course I\nask myself that question from time to\ntime although admittedly most of the\ntime I'm wondering how I'm just going to\nget everything I need to get done done\nbut\nI often get the question how can I feel\nmore motivated or what can I do to\nsustain my motivation over time and you\nknow we hear a lot of different\nstrategies about how to do that we hear\nabout the quote unquote just do it\nstrategy the incredible slogan that Nike\ncreated and that persists to this day\nhas become commonplace in culture and\nindeed the just do it form of advice can\nbe a good one but for a lot of people\nuh just hearing just do it or telling\nthemselves just do it is not something\nthat can evoke action in them uh other\npeople will listen to motivational\nspeeches they'll look at motivational\nvideos they'll read motivational books\num they may even hire coaches in other\nwords people invest a ton of time energy\nand money into trying to be more\nmotivated and indeed a number of\nepisodes of The huberman Lab podcast\nhave focused on the relationship between\nsay motivation drive and the\nneuromodulator dopamine we have several\nepisodes about that as well as a toolkit\nall of which are available zero cost at\nhubermanlab.com you can access those\neasily by putting motivation into the\nsearch function at hubermanlab.com all\nof that will come up time stamped Etc\nbut perhaps surprisingly today's\nconversation about music offers us a\nparticularly potent tool to increase\nmotivation and that's because one of the\nfundamental properties of listening to\nmusic is that it evokes activation of\nthese pre-motor and motor circuits\nwithin our brain and body that is the\nneural circuits whose specific job is to\nmobilize our body from its current\nposition and state to a new position in\nstate\nso for those of you that listen to music\nwhile you work out or prior to when you\nwork out you are definitely on to\nsomething for those of you that don't\nthat's fine too what I'm going to\ndescribe now are the specific sets of\nneural circuits that listening to music\nactivates as I mentioned earlier\nlistening to music activates so many\ncircuits throughout the brain and body\nthat really one can take a step back\nfrom the scientific literature on this\nand say anytime someone has done a study\nwhere human beings listen to music and\npeople record from a particular brain\narea believe it or not even from the\nolfactory system from the system and the\nbrain responsible for smell there seems\nto be some significant shift in terms of\nthe neural firing there or the release\nof neural chemicals\nwhich on the one hand might lead you to\nconclude that listening to music is just\nsort of a non-specific generalized\nactivator of nervous system function\nit's just kind of like turning all the\nlights on but\nthat's not the case music in fact is\nactivating different neural circuits\ndifferently in time and space to evoke a\nwhole set of specific reactions in your\nbrain and body but not the least of\nwhich is the propensity for you to move\nand this is something that you can\nleverage and indeed I'll describe a\nprotocol by which you can leverage music\nin order to greatly increase your state\nof motivation okay so this is the\nportion of today's episode where we're\ngoing to discuss some specific neural\ncircuits but I want to assure you that\nif you're a neurobiologist you can\nunderstand this if you are not a\nneurobiologist in fact if you took no\nbiology ever in your life I'm going to\nmake it clear and easy for you to\nunderstand as I mentioned before when we\nhear music it activates many many\ncircuits throughout the brain and body\nwhen I say circuits I mean neurons nerve\ncells that communicate with one another\nsort of chains of reactions when I say\nrespond to one another what I mean is\nwhen neurons are quote unquote activated\nthey release chemicals those chemicals\nare called neurotransmitters things like\nglutamate Gaba\nthey're also called neuromodulators\nthings like dopamine serotonin the names\ndon't really matter for sake of today's\ndiscussion but what those things do is\nthey influence the likelihood that the\nnext neuron will be active or less\nactive Okay so neurons speak the\nlanguage if you will of electricity\nbecause that's how they evoke release of\nthese chemicals and chemistry they vomit\nout these chemicals those chemicals then\nbind to little parking spots on the next\nneuron called receptors and then the\nnext neuron gets activated electrically\nand then to the next neuron and next\nneuron and so on it's a chain of\nelectrochemical reactions okay so\nthere's your Neuroscience 101 lesson for\ntoday\nwhen people listen to music there is\nheightened activation of the so-called\nfrontal cortex the area of your brain\nwhich is on the surface below your skull\nbut just behind your forehead more or\nless and that area of your brain is\ninvolved in a lot of different things\nit's involved in understanding context\nyou know what sorts of behaviors and\nthoughts and actions are appropriate for\na given environment by the way if any of\nyou have ever been in an environment\nwhere everyone was really quiet and you\nthought oh my gosh what's keeping me\nfrom just blurting out my name right now\nor saying something totally\ninappropriate\nyour frontal cortex is the one providing\nthe sh the so-called top-down inhibition\non that impulse to blurt something\ninappropriate out and by the way your\nthoughts about that impulse are\nperfectly normal they actually reflect a\nheightened sense of normalcy\num because it means that your brain is\nthinking about how it's not going to do\nthat and so therefore you're not going\nto do that likewise if you are ever at\nthe edge of a high bridge please stay on\nthe safe side of the railing but if you\nthink oh my goodness what's keeping me\nfrom just jumping off the bridge right\nnow what's keeping you from doing that\nis your frontal cortex it's suppressing\ncertain actions in a context-dependent\nway in particular actions that are\ndangerous to you socially physically\ndangerous to others socially physically\nEtc\nnow the frontal cortex in order to do\nthat also has an incredible ability to\nmake predictions so this is the function\nof the frontal cortex that I want to\nfocus on for the moment your frontal\ncortex is great at doing the if this\nthen that type of analysis if I say this\neveryone will be offended or if I say\nthis maybe they'll laugh or if I don't\nsay this I'll be safe if I do say that I\nwon't be safe this kind of thing\nfrontal cortex is activated when we\nlisten to music because within music\nthere are some regularities\nsometimes these are described as motifs\nor melodies or choruses again this is\nthe entire landscape of discussion that\nwe could have and we will have with an\nexpert guest about how the mathematics\nof Music impacts the electrochemical\nsignaling within the brain and the\ncoding that is the mathematics of brain\nfunction which leads us to predict that\ncertain things because they just happen\nare likely to happen again or not happen\nagain but let's set all that aside for\nthe moment and just State the simple\nfact which is that when you listen to\nmusic your frontal cortex increases\ninactivation because it is predicting\nwhat you're going to hear next based on\nwhat you're currently hearing and what\nyou heard before now I am from the\ngeneration that we didn't have iPods\nwhen I was a kid we did have CDs we did\nhave tapes but you had to fast forward\nor rewind a cassette tape or you had to\nskip on the CD in order to move about\nthe album in time\nnowadays you can queue up different\nsongs in different order really easily\nbut if you are somebody who listens to\nalbums start to finish or if you're like\nme and you grew up listening to albums\nstart to finish maybe occasionally\nskipping a song but\nyou will be very familiar with this\nphenomenon which is that right is a\ngiven song ends if you're familiar with\nthat album you already anticipate the\nstart of the next song in your head and\nthat just speaks to the predictive\nfunction that the frontal cortex plays\nso if you have a mixtape with a bunch of\ndifferent songs sure you don't expect\none song of a given artist to lead into\nthe next but if you're somebody who's\nlistened to that mixtape a lot so you're\nfamiliar with What song comes next or if\nyou're listening to a given album start\nto finish and you're very familiar with\nit well then you'll immediately resonate\nwith what I'm saying here which is that\nyour frontal cortex is always\nanticipating what sound is likely to\ncome next and this is very important\nbecause one of the key things about\nmusic and its ability to evoke our sense\nof surprise or Delight\nthrough the release of a neuromodulator\ncalled dopamine we'll get to this a bit\nmore later is because that prediction\nMachinery is thinking oh I heard that\nset of chords a moment ago I'm going to\nhear it again and then when it changes\nup your brain goes oh whoa hold on that\nwasn't what I expected and it sometimes\ndoes that with a sense of delight like\noh yes and sometimes it hears that and\nit goes oh wait what's this I don't\nreally like this that much I like the\nopener of that song but I don't really\nlike the rest I think of that as um you\nknow there's certain pastries muffins in\nparticular where I really like the top\nit's got the little crumbs it's got the\nberries and stuff and then you like get\ndown past the top and then you get to\nthe middle then you're like oh well this\nthing's not that good okay there's\ncertain songs like that for me so I\nalways thought of those as muffin songs\nbecause the top of the muffin is always\nthe best whereas a donut is great the\nwhole way through and now I'm going on a\ntangent because I'm thinking about\nmuffins and donuts so I'm going to take\nus back to music but the point is\nrelevant nonetheless which is that your\nfrontal cortex is making predictions and\nwhen those predictions are broken\nthat's a sense of novelty and when that\nnovelty is something that you like okay\nso it evokes a sense of yes I like that\nwell then dopamine is deployed and when\nthat novelty is something you don't like\ntypically there's a reduction in the\namount of dopamine released in a\nseparate set of brain circuits below\nwhatever level of dopamine happened to\nbe there prior your so-called Baseline\nlevel of dopamine okay so when you\nlisten to music there's a strong\nactivation of the prediction Machinery\nin your brain there's also activation of\nthe circuits in your brain that register\nnovelty what are those circuits these\nare things like the ventral tegmental\narea and the nucleus accumbens I've\ntalked about these before on the podcast\nagain you don't need to know those names\nthose are the names given to certain\nbrain areas that control the release of\ndopamine in time according to whatever\nyou happen to be experiencing in that\nmoment okay so the mesolympic reward\npathway could perhaps better be called\nthe mesolimic reinforcement pathway so\nfor those of you out there shouting wait\nthe mesolimic pathway does a bunch of\nother things it's not just dopamine I\nagree it's all serotonin it's a bunch of\nother things but for today's discussion\nwe're thinking about the mesolimic\npathway as deploying dopamine which it\ndoes when we hear something novel\nmeaning not what we predicted and we\nlike what we hear and then there are a\nbunch of other brain centers and\ncircuits that listening to music\nactivates I'll just list off a few again\nthis isn't intended to confuse anybody\nor add a lot of useless nomenclature but\nsince I am a neuroscientist and this is\na science and science informed tools\npodcast I'd be remiss if I didn't\nmention that we get strong activation of\na brain structure you actually have two\nof them one on each side of the brain\ncalled the amygdala this is a brain area\nthat's part of a larger set of circuits\nthat's associated with arousal okay\nmeaning becoming more alert becoming\nmore aware of our surroundings and the\nparticular sensory stimuli that are\ncoming in at particular time such as the\nnotes of the music or a particular set\nof lyrics and music also activates areas\nof the brain such as the para\nhippocampal formation the cortex and the\nhippocampus itself brain areas that\nencode and store memories and this is\nsomething that I think everyone will be\nfamiliar with when you hear certain\nsongs or even songs that sound like\ncertain songs or even songs that you\nswear you've never heard before it can\nevoke a sense of nostalgia of longing\nfor something of missing somebody of\nsadness or of delight and happiness and\npositive memories of somebody or\nsomething indeed I think it's fair to\nsay that hearing particular pieces of\nmusic particular songs more than any\nother experience can activate a whole\nlibrary of memory and emotions within us\nand that's because of its ability to\nactivate the para hippocampal regions of\nthe brain the cortex and the hippocampus\nitself again several different brain\nareas all which communicate with one\nanother and other areas of the brain in\norder to encode our memories\nour sense of self our sense of others\nour sense of history with those people\nand on and on now\nrather than just make this a catalog of\ndifferent brain areas that music evokes\nwhat I'm trying to do is spell out how\nmusic activating these different brain\nareas is creating different components\nof what we are familiar with as our\nexperience of music so frontal cortex\nprediction mesolimbic reward pathway\nnovelty amygdala a sense of emotion and\narousal\npara hippocampal cortex and cortex and\nhippocampus our memories in particular\nour emotional memories and our location\nMemories associated with a particular\npiece of music right haven't you ever\nheard a song from let's say a summer\ncamp that you went to when you were a\nkid and all of a sudden you're\nremembering the smell of the grasses at\nthat summer camp you're remembering how\nsome of the kids were really great and\nhow some of the kids were really\nobnoxious you're remembering some things\nthat you did remember your counselors I\nmean there's just a whole landscape of\nneural information there life\ninformation stored in your head that\nhearing a particular song that was sung\nwhen you were what eight years old 10\nyears old I can't just flips the lid on\nand it comes geysering out remarkable\nnow there are two other sets of brain\ncircuits that are activated by music\nthat deserve specific attention and\ndeserve that specific attention now in\nthe context of discussing motivation and\nmusic's ability to motivate Us in\nparticular ways and those brain circuits\nare the basal ganglia okay so this is a\nset of circuits within the brain they're\nassociated with action initiation\nso-called go circuits and withholding\naction so-called no-go circuits but\nbasically the basal ganglia are involved\nin regulating movement\nand\nthe cerebellum the cerebellum is\nsometimes referred to as the mini brain\nit looks like a little mini brain in the\nbottom back of the human brain\nand some species the cerebellum is much\nlarger relative to the rest of the brain\nbut in humans it's like this little\npiece in the back that looks like a\nlittle mini brain like you're carrying a\nsecond brain back there that's why I\ncall it mini brain cerebellum it's\ninvolved in a lot of things but one of\nits primary functions is to encode\nrhythmic timing and processing and along\nwith its outputs to some deeper brain\nstem areas things like the vestibular\nand cochlear nuclei we'll talk about\nthis the parabrachial nucleus again you\ndon't need to know these names it\nmeaning the cerebellum along with the\nbasal ganglia creates patterns of\nactivity in our brain that Cascade down\nto particular circuits in our body\nso these are so-called pre-motor\ncircuits and motor circuits that\ngenerate the sense that we not only can\nmove but that we want to move and that\nwe want to move in particular ways so if\nyou internalize nothing from the last\nfive minutes or so in which I've been\ndescribing how music impacts different\nneural circuits in the brain please do\ntake away this important point which is\nthat when we listen to music we think of\nthat as an auditory experience but now\nyou know that it's also an emotional\nexperience\nand\nand this is a very important and when we\nlisten to music it is programming a\nspecific set of motor actions that are\nmore likely to occur put differently\nwhen we listen to music we are more\nlikely to move our body and not just\ndance not just move our torso our limbs\nor our Limbs and torso together in\nconcert with the music but rather move\nour body from its current position to\nanother position and this is one of the\nmost important things to understand\nabout music music despite being an\nauditory stimulus coming in through our\nears evokes the activation of neural\ncircuits in our brain that creates a\nsort of inertia it creates a propensity\nfor Action across our entire body so now\nthat you understand that listening to\nmusic activates lots of different brain\ncircuits of course the circuits that\nrespond to auditory stimuli so-called\nprimary auditory cortex is powerfully\nactivated by listening to music but also\ncircuits associated with novelty\nanticipation we talked about circuits in\nthe brain associated with memory but\nalso circuits in the brain that are\nassociated with generating movement and\nnot just movement that is in sync with\nor corresponds to the music that we're\nlistening to but all forms of movement\nbut when we listen to music that has a\nrelatively fast Cadence and we can\nactually Define what that Cadence needs\nto be and we'll do that in a moment\nwhen we do that so-called pre-motor\ncircuitry the circuitry that's going to\ninitiate that kind of inertia where that\npressure for movement within the neural\ncircuits that actually evoke movement\nare all activated so for those of you\nthat like to listen to music while you\nexercise you're familiar with the fact\nthat listening to great songs with a\ngreat beat with particular lyrics or\nthat associate you with a particular\ntime or place in your life can be very\nmotivating but there are data showing\nthat when people listen to music that's\nfaster than about 140 to 150 beats per\nminute that it creates a heightened\nstate of motivation in the body to move\nand the way that it does that is by way\nof Shifting the balance between those\nghost circuits and no go circuits of the\nbasal ganglia there's some other ways\nthat it does it as well for instance\nmusic can evoke the release of certain\nneurochemicals called the catecholamines\nthese include dopamine but also\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine from\ncenters in the brain and body glands in\nthe body like the adrenal gland that\nshift the body toward a predic position\nof being more likely to move so if we\nwant to distill all this out to a simple\nactionable takeaway\nsimply know this listening to music\nrelatively faster music predisposes you\nto be more motivated to move and that is\nindependent this is what I find so cool\nit's independent of whether or not\nyou're familiar with the song\nindependent of whether or not the lyrics\nof the song are motivating lyrics if\nthey are that's just going to layer on\ntop of the faster Cadence which is going\nto predispose you to move but what's\nremarkable is that just listening to\nthat faster Cadence Music is creating a\nneuronal resonance if you will a pattern\nof neuronal firing within you that is\ngoing to essentially take your and here\nI'm using metaphor is going to put your\nstate of motivation from either back on\nyour heels to being flat-footed or let's\nsay you're mildly motivated so I'll call\nthat flat-footed to being forward Center\nof mass so for any of you that are\nsuffering from lack of motivation in\nparticular to exercise but believe it or\nnot also to do cognitive work where\nyou're going to be still and you're\ngoing to sit down and you're going to\nread or learn or practice something\nlistening to music for 10 to 15 minutes\nprior to doing that work prior to doing\nthat exercise is one of the best ways to\nget motivated in order to engage in that\nwork or engage in that exercise that's\nbeen demonstrated in the data very\nconclusively using a variety of\ndifferent types of music and again there\nare multiple mechanisms that converge to\ncreate that heightened state of\nmotivation some of those mechanisms are\nneurochemical like the release of the\nso-called catecholamine dopamine\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine some of\nthem are strictly neural circuit based\nso activation of premotor circuitry and\nthose are going to combine with neural\ncircuits that are going to narrow your\nfield of vision this is a good thing\nwhenever you want to be motivated\nthey're going to literally constrict\nyour field of vision to more of a tunnel\ntype of vision as opposed to more\npanoramic vision and that I described it\nas placing you into a forward Center of\nmass I don't necessarily mean literally\na forward Center of mass\nunless perhaps you're exercising like\nrunning leaning slightly forward what\nI'm talking about is using music as a\nway to deliberately shift your state of\nmind and body from one that is a\nmotivated not motivated to more\nmotivated and it's a very simple\nprotocol extracted from the\npeer-reviewed literature you simply find\nsome faster music hopefully music that\nyou like it would be even better if it\nwas music that had lyrics that you find\nmotivating and listening to that for 10\nto 15 minutes prior to engaging in\nwhatever that work may be physical or\ncognitive on the topic of cognitive work\none of the most common questions I get\nis what sorts of sounds or music should\nI listen to in order to increase my\nstate of productivity motivation\nconcentration Etc on previous podcasts\nrelated to focus and motivation I\ntouched on the use of so-called binaural\nbeats which are different frequencies of\nBeats presented to one or the other ear\nthis is best accomplished with\nheadphones and there are a lot of\ndifferent frequencies of binaural beats\nthat you can get out there\num if you want to get detailed about\nthis binaural beats also involve the\ndifferential between the frequency of\nBeats between the two presented to the\ntwo ears and then that difference then\nis heard by higher order processing\ncenters in the brain in any event we\ndon't have to get too technical about it\nwe can simply say that yes there are\nsome decent peer-reviewed studies\ndemonstrating that when people listen to\nso-called 40 Hertz it's a particular\nfrequency of sound 40 Hertz binaural\nbeats that it can enhance concentration\nand focus however this is important\nthere are some recent studies that show\nthat binaural beats sometimes can impede\nconcentration and focus and thereby can\nimpede cognitive performance on various\ntasks however the studies that show that\nbinaural beats can be detrimental to\nperformance on various cognitive tasks\ndid not use 40 Hertz binaural beats\nspecifically so we are still awaiting\nmore studies on binaural beats meanwhile\nI'll just restate what I said before is\nthat there is some evidence that\nlistening to 40 Hertz binaural beats can\nenhance concentration and focus there\nare also data showing that other\nfrequencies of binaural beats might be\ndetrimental to concentration and\ncognitive performance and previously\nI've also discussed studies showing that\nfor instance if people listen to White\nNoise in the background you could do\nthis on your computer or speakers in the\nroom or headphones or so-called Brown\nnoise which is essentially like white\nnoise all frequencies of sound or most\nfrequency of sound combined but with\nparticular frequencies of sounds that\nare accentuated and others are notched\nout as it's called so-called Brown noise\nrather than understand all of this at a\ntechnical level because I've covered\nthat before in previous podcasts suffice\nto say if you go to YouTube and you just\nput in White Noise background for\ncognitive Focus or brown noise\nbackground for cognitive Focus you can\njust try those if you like during a\nsession in which you're trying to read\nor learn or do mathematics or music or\nany kind of cognitive work\nif you don't like them if they don't\nwork for you then\num you know there's certainly no\nobligation to use them likewise with 40\nHertz binaural beats and for binaural\nbeats you can also find those as zero\ncost YouTube scripts there are a number\nof zero cost apps that will allow you to\nlisten to binaural beats I've used the\napp brainwave for some period of time\nnow to be honest I've never done this\nstrict control experiment on myself of\nlistening to the 40 Hertz binaural beats\nor not listening to 40 Hertz binaural\nbeats doing the equivalent types of\ntasks I can be fairly regimented with my\nwork and behavior but I haven't run a\ndetailed controlled study on myself\naround this rather if I want to heighten\nmy level of focus or rule out\ndistractions what I will do is I will\nlisten to either white noise or brown\nnoise while I'll do work or I will\nlisten to 40 Hertz binaural beats while\nI do certain types of work or sometimes\nfrankly I just work in silence other\ntimes I will listen to classical music\nin the background I'm a big fan of\nlistening to classical piano I\nparticularly like Glenn Gould the bach\nvery those are very pleasant to me but\nand this is really important in\nresearching this episode about music in\nthe brain what I discovered was in the\ncontrolled studies that have been\ncarried out as to whether or not people\nperform better on cognitive tasks that\nrequire a lot of focus especially\nlearning tasks that compared silence in\nthe background to purely instrumental\nmusic in the background to music with\nlyrics in the background to one's\nfavorite music with or without lyrics\nthe data are very clear it's very clear\nthat most people that means\nstatistically on average people perform\nbest on cognitive tasks or tasks that\nrequire a lot of focus to perform\nagain these are mental tasks not\nphysical tasks when they are doing those\ntasks in complete silence so that was\nsomewhat surprising to me\nsecond best conditions are to do those\ntasks in the presence of instrumental\nmusic only and in that case there was a\nlot of variation as to whether or not\npeople referred faster Cadence Music so\n140 to 150 beats per minute or faster or\nslower music 60 beats per minute or\nslower I'll get back to those specific\nnumbers later because they represent\nthresholds for inducing different types\nof emotional states either happy or sad\nbut meanwhile\nit's very clear when people work in\nsilence they perform better than when\nthey work with music instrumentals in\nthe background and they perform even\nless well when they listen to music with\nlyrics in the background we'll talk\nabout why that is the case in a moment\nand then people perform especially\npoorly relative to their performance in\nsilence or any of the other conditions I\nmentioned when they listen to their\nfavorite music while doing cognitive\nwork and that to me was a bit surprising\nespecially since I spent a lot of my\nUniversity years studying while\nlistening to my favorite music in\ndifferent forms I'd listen to slower\nmusic then faster music and go back and\nforth and then sometimes turn it off\naltogether and work in silence but the\ncenter of mass of the literature around\nthis issue of whether or not to listen\nto music while one studies or tries to\nlearn something the data are pretty\nclear the data show that it's best to\nstudy and learn either in silence or\nwith quiet instrumentals in the\nbackground now I mentioned before that\nprevious studies compared the effects of\nworking in silence versus working with\n40 Hertz binaural beats or white noise\nor brown noise in the background and in\nthose studies it was found that the\nwhite noise Brown noise and 40 Hertz\nbinaural beats background produced\nbetter levels of focus I should say\nheightened levels of focus and cognitive\nperformance and learning then working in\nsilence\nbut I've not yet seen a study that\ncompared 40 Hertz binaural beats\nBrown Noise White Noise to music\ndirectly and perhaps there's one out\nthere if there is please send it to me\nI'd be very curious to learn what the\nresults of those are now that might seem\nlike a lot of information but the\ntakeaways from it are very clear and\nit's always nice when things are clear\nright\nit's clear that if we want to focus and\nlearn that working in silence or with\nwhite noise or brown noise or 40 Hertz\nbinaural beats is going to be preferable\nto working while listening to music but\nif you're going to listen to music while\nyou work that is do cognitive work then\nyou're going to want to listen to music\nthat is purely instrumental and ideally\nthe music would be somewhat faster than\n140 to 150 beats per minute now I do not\nexpect you to go and measure the\nfrequency of beats per minute in the\nmusic that you listen to and of course\nthe beats per minute are going to change\nright that's an average 140 to 150 beats\nper minute\nI don't expect you to get super\ntechnical break down the music that\nyou're listening to that is not my goal\nnor is that really what this podcast is\nabout I think occasionally people think\nthat you know the the goal of a science\nand science-based protocols podcast is\nto optimize everything in fact I not\nsuch a fan of the word optimize because\noptimal really depends on the situation\nthat you happen to be in the point here\nis simply this that many people out\nthere including myself have been\nlistening to some of our favorite music\nwhile working but it's very clear as to\nwhy that degrades cognitive performance\nwe know for instance that when we read\nwe are creating a semantic narrative in\nour own head and when we listen to music\nwith lyrics especially music with lyrics\nthat we recognize the semantic content\nof the song the lyrics\ncompetes with our comprehension of the\nnarrative within our head from the\nmaterial that we're supposed to be\nlearning so now it should be sort of\nobvious why listening to your favorite\nmusic that includes lyrics while trying\nto learn something else is going to\nimpede learning it's because you've got\nmultiple scripts multiple dialogues\nhappening in your head and in fact this\nis an opportunity for me to take a\nslight tangent but a relevant one which\nis to say a lot of times people will ask\nme how I can retain a lot of information\nI confess I never use a teleprompter for\npodcasting I do have a usually a short\nstack of notes you know anywhere from\none to you know six or seven pages of\njust\num bullet pointed notes that cue up\nthings that I want to talk about and\nthat I have researched in the literature\nand then of course I'll refer to papers\nfrom time to time but one of the things\nthat's been very useful for me which was\ntaught to me by the way by a professor\nwhen I was in university to read and\nretain information that I've read by\nmemory is that when I read I'm trying to\nlisten to the words being spoken in my\nhead typically my own voice although\nsometimes in someone else's voice\ndoesn't really matter I find so when I'm\nreading yes it's a process of visual\nscanning but I'm also listening to the\nwords within my head as if they're being\nspoken some of you may be familiar with\nthis because you do it others of you\nperhaps might find this a bit more\nforeign I'd be curious to know what your\nprocess of reading and retaining that\ninformation is whether or not it\nincludes an internal dialogue but\nnonetheless\nit should be very straightforward now to\nsee why if you're listening to words\nthat you're reading on a page maybe even\nmumbling them you know a little bit\nmoving your lips a little bit while you\nread which by the way if you heard our\nepisode on language and auditory\nprocessing with Dr Eddie Chang who's\nchair of neurosurgery at UCSF he talked\nabout the fact that when we read\nany material that the brain is\ngenerating pre-motor activity you now\nknow what pre-motor activity is\npre-motor activity down to the muscles\nof the throat larynx pharynx\nwhich would speak those words were those\nsignals to get above a certain level but\nthat when we read typically the signals\nthat are getting sent through those\npre-motor circuits are just below the\nthreshold of what would have us actually\nspeak those words put simply when we\nread we are just shy of saying what we\nare reading and so when I say that when\nI read I'm listening to the words in my\nhead that's what I'm referring to so\nwe're starting to funnel in on some\ngeneral principles of music and how it\nimpacts the brain and how that can be\nleveraged toward Better Learning and\nbetter motivation both in the context of\nphysical and cognitive Endeavors okay so\nif you want to get motivated listening\nto music prior to doing something that\nyou're trying to motivate to do\nis a good idea that's what the data say\nif you're trying to learn something\nthat's cognitive then requires reading\nfocus and concentration silence 40 Hertz\nbinaural beats white noise or brown\nnoise is probably best and if you are\ngoing to listen to music listening to\nmusic\nthat includes instrumentals but not\nlyrics would be best and listening to\nmusic that includes lyrics that you're\nvery familiar with would be the worst\ncondition now with that said there are\nnice studies and by the way I'm going to\nlink to a number of reviews and primary\nstudies in the show note captions that\nrefer back to this point I'm about to\ntell you which is that listening to\nmusic while trying to do cognitive tasks\ncan be detrimental toward learning that\nmaterial\nturns out that if you listen to music in\nthe breaks between trying to learn\ncertain material you can actually\nheighten your level of cognition and\nfocus and your ability to learn so I\nfind this particularly cool it's not\nthat music is bad for focus and\ncognition and learning it's that\nlistening to music especially music that\nyou're familiar with that includes\nlyrics at the same time as trying to\nlearn something else is not a good idea\nbut listening to music with lyrics\nespecially music with lyrics that you're\nfamiliar with that you find particularly\nuplifting and motivating is a cognitive\nand performance enhancer when you go\nback to doing that work in silence or\nperhaps while listening to White Noise\nBrown noise or 40 Hertz binaural beats\nso like so many things the answer is not\nblack and white it's not that silence is\nbetter than music or that music is bad\nfor learning it turns out that listening\nto music even music with lyrics you're\nvery familiar with can be highly\nbeneficial for learning but that you\nwant to listen to that music in the\nbreaks be between these bouts of\ncognitive work now I've done previous\npodcasts that talk about how long about\nof cognitive work can or should be\ntypically 90 minutes is going to be the\nupper limit before you take a break some\npeople can't work for 90 minutes without\na break\nby the way folks when I say without a\nbreak I don't mean remaining in a deep\ntrench of focus for 90 minutes nobody\ndoes that actually I suppose there are a\nfew folks that with neurochemical\nAssistance or just by way of training\ncan get themselves into a deep deep\ntrench of focus for 90 minutes or more\nbut most people are going to focus on\nsomething and then have their attention\nflit out of focus and then they're going\nto have to draw their focus back to\nwhatever it is they're doing that's not\njust typical that's absolutely normal\nand you shouldn't be concerned at all if\nyou try and focus for three minutes and\nfind your attention jumping around two\nor three times during\nthat attempt but if you're somebody who\nis going to do say a 90 minute or even\n60 Minute or even 30 minute bout of work\nand you are going to get up for a moment\nand use the restroom or you're going to\ntake a break in between bouts of work so\nmaybe you work for 30 minutes take 10\nminutes or five minutes off or 90\nminutes take 30 minutes off listening to\nmusic in those breaks\nit seems can increase our ability to\nfocus and to learn new material once we\nreturn to those bouts of cognitive Focus\nnow when it comes to physical exertion\ncardiovascular exercise resistance\ntraining of any kind many people\nincluding myself like to listen to music\nwhile performing\nthat physical exercise or that physical\nexertion the data on whether or not\nmusic improve physical performance is a\nbit mixed\ncertainly you can find studies that show\nthat it improves physical output other\nstudies will say that it doesn't make a\ndifference other studies will say that\nit reduces\nphysical output however this is a very\nimportant however the type of physical\nexercise is not very well matched\nbetween those different studies so this\nis something that I believe is going to\nbe highly individual in accordance with\nthe published data I mix it up there are\ntimes when I will head out for a run or\nI will do a resistance training session\nand I will listen to music usually an\nalbum all the way through or a playlist\nall the way through that's because I\ndon't want to be going onto my phone\nvery often in fact these days I use an\nolder separate phone that doesn't have\nany text messaging or communication to\nthe outside world but it has music\nloaded into it\nor onto it that allows me to just listen\nto music so that I I don't run the risk\nof getting distracted texting and doing\nthings like that I just want to focus on\nmy physical exercise I should say that\nphone also has audio books podcasts\nthings I've downloaded to it\nso it's a place where I can listen to\nthings but not communicate with the\noutside world at least while exercising\nsome people do very well to listen to\nmusic literally in between and during\ntheir sets of resistance training\nthroughout their entire runs\nit's going to be individual you have to\nfigure out what's best for you however\none of the most interesting things about\nthe scientific literature on this shows\nthat if people listen to music in\nparticular music that tends to be faster\nmore upbeat typically it's going to be\nin these studies rock and roll music as\nopposed to classical although there are\nsome studies that have explored\nclassical and other forms of music as it\nrelates to exercise listening to that\nmusic in between bouts of exertion so in\nthe rest between sets of resistance\ntraining or periodically during say a\nrun\nor about a cycling\ncan indeed enhance performance in a way\nthat at least by my read of the data\nexceeds that which is observed when\npeople just listen to music throughout\nin other words if you find it useful to\nlisten to music before during and after\nyour workouts great be my guest however\nwhat the data say is that switching up\nbetween silence and listening to music\nand in this case it would be listening\nto music that you're very familiar with\nand that can evoke a sense of motivation\nand desired action in you for whatever\nreason the music the beat the memories\nthat it draws you to\nEtc\nwell then that's going to be useful so\nthere really isn't one protocol for how\nto get the most out of music for sake of\nphysical exertion but if you're\ninterested in playing with some of these\nvariables as they've been examined\nwithin the peer-reviewed literature I\nfind it interesting and indeed I found\nit useful to for instance do a workout\nwhere I only listen to music in between\nsets of resistance training or to listen\nto music prior to going out for a run\nand then oftentimes when I do that the\nsong will or songs will be sort of on\nLoop in my head although I confess that\na lot of times nowadays I listen to\npodcasts while I run or while I hike and\nwhen I'm in the gym and I'm doing\nresistance training I like to listen to\nmusic as opposed to content that\nrequires that I really focus very\nheavily on that content such as a\npodcast such as a book I'd like to take\na quick break and acknowledge our\nsponsor inside tracker inside tracker is\na personalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you meet your health goals I'm a\nbig

plans again that's\ninsidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off\nnow I'd like to talk about the use of\nmusic to shift our mood and indeed to\nget us out of states of anxiety this is\na really interesting scientific\nliterature with some very specific\nactionable takeaways that I think\neveryone will find beneficial I\ncertainly did\nhowever I want to point out that we\ndon't need a scientific study to\nillustrate for us the way that music can\nshift our mood and you already know why\nit is that listening to a sad song can\nsometimes make us feel sad listening to\nhappy music can make us feel happy it's\nbecause when we listen to music there\nare some fundamental components of that\nmusic literally the mathematical\nstructure of that music including the\nfrequency of sounds the Cadence of those\nsounds as well as the lyrics but even in\nthe absence of lyrics that are\nactivating brain circuits within us such\nthat the frequencies of sound that we're\nhearing are evoking firing of neurons in\nthe brain of the same frequency in other\nwords your brain becomes a bit of a\npiano playing the same\nsong that you're hearing inside your\nhead now that's sort of a duh right you\nhear music in your head even if you're\nlistening to it from outside in the room\nbut when you understand that neurons\nspeak the language of electrochemical\ncommunication what we're talking about\nhere is particular music evoking the\nrelease of neurochemicals in your brain\nat a particular frequency so just think\nabout that for a second we know that\nneurochemicals such as dopamine\nserotonin some of the so-called\nendogenous opioids right these aren't\nopioids that people take this isn't\nrelated to the opioid crisis we're\ntalking about endogenous opioids that\nare released in response to music things\nlike exercise different types of social\ninteractions those and other chemicals\nare released according to the firing of\nspecific neurons and we know that when\nyou listen to music at particular\nfrequencies arranged in particular\nmotifs\nEtc that the neurons that release those\nneurochemicals are firing at those same\nfrequencies in other words that the\nsound is causing a\nsound-dependent pharmacologic concert\nwithin your brain so that fact should\nmake it incredibly clear as to why\ncertain music even in the absence of\nlyrics can evoke certain emotional\nstates certain sound frequencies are\ntransformed into the neural language\nwithin your brain that releases certain\nneurochemicals that create certain\nemotional states of brain and body just\nto drill in how incredible that really\nis a little bit further\nif you see a beautiful painting or the\npicture or presence of somebody's face\nin real life that evokes a particularly\nstrong positive or negative emotion\nyou can imagine that of course it\ncreates the release of certain\nneurochemicals or perhaps in the case of\na negative face suppresses the release\nof certain neurochemicals but we can't\nsay that a particular frequency of color\nsay Reds against oranges or the presence\nof a rainbow evokes a sort of\nrainbow-like cascade of neurochemicals\nwhereas with sound that's exactly what's\nhappening and this isn't to diminish the\nvalue of vision in terms of its ability\nto evoke emotional states within us\nafter all I'm foremost a neuroscientist\nbut under the umbrella of\nneuroscientists I started off as and I\ncontinue to be a vision neuroscientist\nstudying the visual system and its\nability to evoke emotional states within\nus but I have to acknowledge that the\nauditory system and in particular the\ncircuits in the brain that respond to\nmusic have a remarkably potent ability\nto evoke these emotional states which is\nwhy when surveys have been done asking\npeople why they listen to music the\nresponses that have come back generally\nresemble the following statistics\napproximately 90 of people say they\nlisten to music to relax approximately\n82 percent of people self-report that\nthey listen to music in order to make\nthemselves happy\napproximately 46.5 percent of people say\nthat they listen to music in order to\nprocess particular states of emotion\nwe'll get back to what process means in\na moment but more often than not when\nthese Studies have asked specific\nquestions about what particular types of\nemotions people are listening to in\norder to process their emotions better\nit is the emotion of sadness\nand 32.5 percent of people\nreport that they listen to music in\norder to increase their sense of\nconcentration and we already talked\nabout the role of Music in concentration\nor its ability in some cases to inhibit\nconcentration a few minutes ago now you\nmight be asking yourself how can 90 of\npeople listen to music for one thing and\n82 percent of people for another thing\nand so on and so forth were well over\n100 of people ah well in this survey and\nother surveys like it people have the\noption to give multiple reasons for\nlistening to music because of course\nmost people have multiple reasons for\nlistening to music\nnow with that said if we are to examine\nthis one particular category nearly half\nof people who report listening to music\non a regular basis listen to music in\norder to process their emotions\nwe can ask what does the scientific\nliterature tell us about how certain\ntypes of music evoke certain types of\nemotions or help us process certain\nemotions and we'll get back to what we\nmean by process in a moment but\na number of Studies have been done on\nthis there's some meta-analyzes that\nConverge on some general themes what I\nrefer to as the center of mass of data\nright when there are a lot of studies in\na given area the outcomes of some of\nthose studies conflict with one another\ngenerally in a good meta-analysis what\nhappens is different studies are\nconsidered more powerful or less\npowerful than others depending on how\nmany subjects were involved the\ndifferent control conditions or lack of\ncontrol conditions and so on and so\nforth this is one of the great values of\nmeta-analyzes\nis that they don't treat all studies\nequally they separate it out studies\nbased on their level of rigor and\nthoroughness well what we can say with\nconfidence is that\nmusic that makes us quote unquote happy\nor tends to shift People's State from\nless happy to happier regardless of how\nthey enter the experiment tend to be\nfaster music meaning music that on\naverage contains\n140 to 150 beats per minute or faster\nokay and there's some other features to\nquote unquote happy music if you will\nthat it tends to be in a major key that\nif there are lyrics to that music that\nthe lyrics tend to report things that\nare happy or get this total nonsense in\nfact when the type of lyrics in this\nhappy music's I guess singing about\num great events in life and positive\nthings falling in love being in love\npositive memories birth of children\nconnection to friends Great Adventures\nthose lyrics or I should say that music\ncontaining those lyrics was no more\neffective in creating states of\nhappiness than was music of equivalent\nCadence so again music that was 140 to\n150 beats per minute or faster on\naverage\nwell even if the lyrics were complete\nnonsense even if the vocalizations\nweren't actual words\nit still evoke the same increase in the\nlevel of happiness in the subjects than\nwhen compared to the music containing\ncoherent lyrics around happy events what\nthis means is that the Cadence of music\nis no doubt the critical variable when\none is trying to shift one's mood from a\nstate of whatever could be depressed or\nsad to non-depressed nonsad or neutral\nto positive and so on and so forth\nbut what this also explains is one hit\nwonders\nrarely if ever by the way are one hit\nwonders sad and depressing songs\nsometimes almost always these one-hit\nwonders are songs that are very\neffective in shifting people's mood from\nnot so happy to happier or we could just\nsay happier regardless of where they\nstarted out before listening to the song\nthey feel better while and after\nlistening to the song\nand indeed more often than not the\nlyrical content of those songs\nis not particularly meaningful it's not\naddressing a particularly meaningful\nstate or issue it's just what some\npeople call a party song or something\nthat's just uplifting not just to them\nto but to many other people which\nactually brings up an interesting and\nfuture looking point which is that\nnowadays we are seeing the emergence of\nAI Artificial Intelligence being used to\ngenerate new songs by capturing these\nwell-established rules gleaned from\nNeuroscience of how music impacts the\nbrain such that in the future artificial\nintelligence is going to be generating\nhit songs for us as opposed to having\npeople generating hit songs I know this\nevokes a state of concern and fear in\nmany people I think that um this is uh\nfear that needs to be matched with\num I don't know perhaps a cautious\noptimism I mean who knows maybe there\nare patterns of music including lyrics\nthat human beings in their current\nunderstanding of themselves and of Music\nhave not yet been able to tap into and\nwho knows maybe AI will be generating\nthe best music that we've ever heard or\nperhaps music that can shift our States\nfrom more depressed or sad to heightened\nlevels of happiness in ways that humans\nhave just not been able to accomplish so\nI think it's important to balance any\npessimism about Ai and its ability to\ngenerate music based on these rules of\nhow music impacts the brain with an\nopen-mindedness after all neuroscience\nneuroimaging and neural recordings\ndirectly with electrodes in the brain\nwhile people are listening to music is\nteaching us how the brain responds to\nthat music and is giving us information\nthat indeed human beings but also\ncomputers can use in order to generate\nstimuli music that can shift our brain\ninto more positive States and if that's\nthe case wouldn't that be wonderful\nanother established feature of happy\nmusic is get this its ability to get\npeople to relax the furrow of their brow\nand need to raise their eyebrows and to\nbe a bit wide-eyed and not just through\nautonomic arousal but rather through\nactivation of the muscles in the face\nconversely we know that sad music and\nhere we can Define sad music this has\nactually been done in the literature sad\nmusic tends to be slower than average\nslower than 60 beats per minute or so\nagain on average and this again is\nindependent of the lyrics that might not\neven be present in the song\nsad music tends to activate the\ncorrugator muscles\nof the forehead which are the muscles\nthat Furrow the brow and that lead to a\nkind of serious look it's in an it's a\nfolding in of the face as opposed to a\nwidening up of the eyes and a relaxation\nof the brow now given where we are in\nthe course of this discussion that\nshouldn't be surprising we already\ntalked about how listening to particular\nsounds evokes the release of particular\nneurochemicals but in a more direct\nfashion\nlistening to particular sounds activate\ncertain pre-motor and motor circuits\nwithin the brain and body not just the\ndesire to move one's torso limbs or both\nBob one's head or move ahead side to\nside but also the micro structures of\nthe face which because one of the main\nroles of the face is to communicate\nemotion\nis going to cause either a relaxation of\nthe brow and a lifting of the eyebrows\nor a furrowing or a activation of the\ncorrugator muscles of the eyebrow and if\nthat's not obvious and yet interesting\nenough well get this\nthere seems to be a direct relationship\nI'm chuckling because this still just\nblows my mind because it's a total duh\nobvious when you hear it but it's still\njust so cool that there's a direct\nrelationship of the frequency of the\nsound that you hear either low pitched\nor high pitched and the Cadence of that\nsound and here I realize I'm not using\ntechnical music theory language but\nwhether or not the that particular tone\nis played over and over close in time or\nmore spaced out in time and facial\nexpressions and indeed\nwhen we listen to\nbass tones low frequency tones set apart\nfrom one another with some distance so\nthat they're not overlapping we get the\nall too familiar\nbass face so what I'm referring to here\nis what neuroscientists would call a\nlabeled line literally a circuit of\nneurons that goes from the periphery in\nthis case our ears into our brain\nthrough several different stations and\nthen\nWicks out to impact all sorts of things\nwithin US states of emotion states of\nmotivation our propensity to move but\nalso a labeled line circuit coming from\nhearing low frequency sounds played\nspaced apart from one another that\nevokes a particular facial expression\nand again this takes us back to the\nearlier statement that I made which is\nnot an original statement frankly there\nare people within the field\nof auditory processing and understanding\nhow the brain processes music in fact\none of the world experts in this Dr Eric\nJarvis at the Rockefeller University was\na guest on this podcast where we talked\nabout the relationship between music\nmovement and singing and the fact that\nmusic movement in particular dance and\nsinging likely preceded the evolution of\nmodern spoken language\nwell Eric Jarvis and others have argued\nquite convincingly that these circuits\nthat I'm calling labeled lines to\nparticular facial expressions and states\nof emotion are the most fundamental\ncomponents of communication and the ways\nthat humans have communicated about\ntheir emotional state and literally\ninduced that same emotional state in\nother members of our species dating back\ntens of thousands if not more years one\nof the fun things about researching this\nepisode on music in the brain is that\nthere are a lot of quality studies\nexploring how music impacts the brain\nneuroimaging neural recording data from\nexcellent Laboratories as well as a lot\nof studies in fact a surprising number\nof studies exploring how particular\ntypes of music impacts mood States and\nfortunately that allowed me to glean\nsome very specific recommendations as to\nthe minimum amounts of say happy music\nthat you need to listen to in order to\nshift your mood into a happier State and\nindeed the numbers exist in the\nliterature and it has been shown that\nthe threshold for significantly shifting\none's mood into a happier state by\nlistening to the sorts of Music we\ntalked about before that faster Cadence\nMusic even with nonsense lyrics although\nit could include other lyrics instead is\nnine minutes not ten not eight but nine\nand I'm sort of joking when I say not\nten not eight but nine because of course\nyou could listen to music for 10 minutes\nor 15 minutes or longer in fact earlier\nwe talked about the benefits of doing\nthat but\nwhen one examines the various studies\nthat looked at how long subjects need to\nlisten to music in order to shift their\nmood into a happier State the threshold\nseems to be nine minutes so if you want\nto feel happier than you currently feel\nit seems that listening to happy music\nfor nine minutes or more is going to be\nthe effective approach okay so nine\nminutes or more to shift one state to\nhappier what about to process somber or\nsad feelings feelings of loss\nwell this raises an even bigger question\nand it's a question that I also get very\noften so you're noticing I get a lot of\nquestions often in any event\none of the common questions that I get\nis when we are feeling sad\nor experiencing a loss you know grieving\nthat the loss of a relationship by you\nknow by death or decision or by somebody\nmoving away or the loss of a pet Etc\nis it better to go into that state in\nother words to quote unquote feel one's\nfeelings or to counter those feelings\nnow historically that's been a very\ndifficult question for me to answer\nbecause who am I to say whether or not\nyou should feel your feelings or whether\nor not feeling those feelings will take\nyou down a trench of feeling much worse\nor much better in fact there's an\nemerging literature exactly about that\nissue that is whether or not the\ncatharsis model is really vascotharsis\nbeing the expression and feeling of\none's emotions as a way to extrude or\nget rid of those emotions or whether or\nnot that simply drives us further down\nthe trench of those emotions that's\nreally something that we should address\nin a separate podcast episode and I will\nhave experts from the fields of\nPsychiatry and psychology to help us\naddress that question directly but\nsince we're talking about music in the\nbrain and the fact that music has a\ntremendous capacity to evoke emotional\nStates including sad States\nwhat has been shown in the peer-reviewed\nliterature is that when people who are\nfeeling sad for whatever reason\nloss of relationship death who knows\ndoesn't really matter why they're\nfeeling sad after all\nit's that they're feeling sad listening\nto 13 minutes or more of sad music\nthat music can contain lyrics they are\nfamiliar with or no lyrics regardless of\nwhether or not it contains lyrics it's\ngoing to be on average 50 or 60 beats\nper minute or less we established that\nalready\nlistening to that for 13 minutes or more\nhas been shown to be effective in\nallowing people to quote unquote process\ntheir somber feelings and to some extent\nto move past their feelings of sadness\nso\nthose studies support the idea that when\nfeeling sad feeling one's feelings and\nperhaps even amplifying those feelings\nof Sadness by listening to sad music for\n13 minutes or more can help people\nprocess those sad feelings and while\nthat point might seem overly\nreductionist I actually think it's a\nreal value I'm certainly familiar with\nfeelings of loss feelings of grief and\nI've often struggled with this question\nof you know gosh do I try and just push\nit aside or do I deal with those\nfeelings\nagain this is something that you really\nneed to determine for yourself but what\nthese studies show pretty conclusively\nis that when we're feeling sad matching\nthat sadness or amplifying that Sadness\nby listening to sad music for 13 minutes\nor more can help us move through that\nstate of sadness and one could argue\nthis is more or less the use of\ncatharsis of amplifying emotional\nexpression or feeling\nin order to try and move that feeling\nout is a classic idea of originating in\nFreudian psychology but probably before\nthen as well but in any event I think\nthese data support the idea that even\nwhen feeling sad perhaps especially when\nfeeling sad\namplifying or matching those feelings\nthrough the use of sad music for 13\nminutes or more\nagain you don't need to set a timer for\n13 minutes but giving yourself a period\nof time to just listen to that music is\none way that can help you move through\nthat state of sadness and then be able\nto lean back into other areas of life so\nwe've talked about the role of Music in\nevoking or shifting states of happiness\nand sadness\nthere are also interesting data that\nsupport the use of music for shifting\none out of a state of heightened anxiety\nand I find this especially interesting\nbecause my laboratory for a long time\nhas worked on behavioral interventions\nto reduce anxiety things like the\nphysiological Psy which if you're not\nfamiliar with you can put physiological\nPSI in my last name into YouTube and\nthere's a demonstration of that it's a\nbreathing technique of two inhales\nthrough the nose and a long exhale\nthrough the mouth the lungs empty that\nat this point in time we understand to\nbe the fastest and most effective way to\nreduce one's levels of anxiety in real\ntime so it's two inhales through the\nnose long to lungs empty exhale through\nthe mouth\nthat's the physiological PSI\nearlier we talked about the fact that\none of the main ways in which listening\nto music shifts heart rate and increases\nheart rate variability and thereby\npositively shifts a number of different\nHealth metrics is through shifts in\nbreathing so I justify that brief\nvignette about the physiological PSI as\nwithin the general context of what we're\ntalking about today\nin any event\nthere are data that have explored\nwhether or not specific musical stimuli\ncan be used to significantly reduce\nanxiety in particular one published out\nof the University of Pennsylvania and\nI'll provide a link to the study in the\nshow note captions which shows that\npeople that listen to a particular song\nthat I'll describe in a moment\nexperience up to 65 percent reductions\nin their anxiety and that's a\nsignificant reduction in anxiety and I\nshould point out that\n65 reduction in anxiety in this case was\naccomplished with just three minutes of\nlistening to this one particular song\nand get this that particular song was as\neffective in reducing anxiety as one of\nthe most commonly prescribed\nbenzodiazepines so what is this magical\nanxiety reducing song the title of the\nsong is weightless by Marconi Union\nI hadn't heard of the song prior to\nresearching this episode I did indeed\nlook up the song on YouTube and listen\nto the song I will provide a link to the\nsong in the show note captions I confess\nthat it is a very relaxing song I also\nconfessed that I was not experiencing\nanxiety when I listened to the song but\nit was successful in reducing my level\nof overall autonomic arousal I found\nmyself more relaxed Etc now of course\nwhat I'm describing in terms of my own\nexperience is not a peer-reviewed study\nit's what I would call anik data meaning\nI'm just describing my experience but\nagain there are peer-reviewed studies\nexploring how this particular song\nshifts one's autonomic State and I think\nthis three minutes of listening to this\none song should at least be Tried by\nanyone that's trying to reduce their\nanxiety Because unless you're listening\nto the song in some way that I'm not\naware of like excessively loud or\nsomething of that sort I can't imagine\nhow listening to the song would be\ndetrimental in any way and if you are\nanything like the subjects in the study\nthat they explored it could very well be\nbeneficial and help you reduce your\nanxiety it's also something that you\ncould keep queued up in your phone or on\nany device such that if you think you\nmay experience anxiety you just put your\nheadphones in and listen to it you might\nbe wondering whether or not Marconi\nUnion's weightless is only three minutes\nlong well I don't know the answer to\nthat because when you go on YouTube what\nyou'll see is that clearly a number of\npeople are benefiting from listening to\nthe song to reduce their anxiety or at\nleast that a number of people have\nlistened to this song Because if you put\nMarconi Union weightless into the search\nfunction on YouTube what you'll quickly\ndiscover is that the top video has get\nthis 47 million views and it's 10 hours\nlong now across today's episode it's\nbeen in the back of my mind that some of\nyou out there perhaps are trained\nmusicians that you grew up playing an\ninstrument perhaps sang in choir or at\nschool perhaps you played multiple\ninstruments perhaps you even know music\ntheory whereas others such as myself\nwere encouraged to play an instrument\nwhen we were younger but then abandoned\nthat instrument in fact I'll just tell\nyou a brief story when I was a kid every\nkid in school was required to pick an\ninstrument my parents for whatever\nreason clearly they didn't ask me what I\nwant to do they asked me to play the\nviolin in school and I got the violin\nstarted playing the violin I took the\nSuzuki method lessons this is where you\ndon't learn to read music directly you\nthere's a number assignment to the\ndifferent notes and that's initially how\nyou learn I was also supposed to listen\nto the songs while I slept this idea\nthat some of the music and musical\nlearning could be encoded during sleep\nan interesting topic because there's\nactually some emerging evidence for that\nnow but at the time as far as I know\nthere were no peer-reviewed studies but\nnonetheless it was thought that this\nworks and perhaps it does well I can\ntell you one thing for sure it did not\nwork for me because I have one photo and\ntruly just one from a concert that I\nplayed I must have been about eight or\nnine years old and within this photo\nwhat you'll notice is there's a gallery\nof children all with violins all of\nwhom's bows are up\nand my bow is down that in addition to\nthe fact that my fly was open in the\npicture and the fact that every time I\nplayed the violin either by practice or\nwith the teacher present when we would\ngo to these once a week\nsessions with a individual teacher\npeople would cringe animals would cringe\nliterally dogs would howl such that my\nparents\ndid not encourage me to continue playing\nin fact they and many others encouraged\nme to quit playing so I quit playing I\nconfess I don't know how to play any\ninstrument I've attempted a few other\ninstruments in my lifetime yes I believe\nin neuroplasticity it is a Hallmark\nfeature of our brain our brain can learn\nthings even as adults but the point I've\ntried to make here is that I am not of\nthe category of kids that played an\ninstrument\nand understands music theory or how to\nread music I simply don't and I realize\nthat those of you that are listening to\nthis or watching this out there are\nprobably in a mixed category of\nproficiency all the way down to what I\nwould consider my own relationship to\nmusic which is deficiency although I\ngreatly enjoy listening to music and I\ndo have a pretty good ability to\nmemorize lyrics\nin any event\nthe reason I raise this is that there\nare now dozens if not hundreds of\nquality peer-reviewed studies using a\nvariety of technical approaches that\nshow that when children especially\nchildren younger than eight\nlearn to play an instrument and even\nbetter learn to play multiple\ninstruments\nregardless of whether or not they learn\nto read music that it leads to greatly\nenhanced connectivity within their brain\nthat persists into adulthood and that it\nfacilitates other forms of\nneuroplasticity and learning which is\nbasically to say that my brain very\nlikely does not include these enhanced\ncircuits which circuits am I referring\nto well there are a number of different\ncircuits in the brain that have been\nshown to expand when children learn how\nto play an instrument as a child eight\nor younger and again eight isn't a\nstrict cut off and I always have to\nhighlight this forgive the tangent but\nwhen we say eight or younger I don't\nwant people with nine-year-old children\nor a 10 year old kid or even 16 year old\nkid listening or even adult listening to\nthink oh you know the window is shut for\nme because when one designs a study you\nhave to have some thresholds who you\ninclude and who you don't include and\nsome sometimes that leads to these kind\nof artificial perceptions about where\nthe cutoffs are but in any event it's\nvery clear that if you did learn an\ninstrument when you were young or\nideally even multiple instruments and\neven better would be to learn multiple\ninstruments and how to sing along with\ninstrumentals especially in an\nimprovised manner\nwell your brain has expanded\nconnectivity on average relative to\nchildren that did not have that\nexperience now the good news is that\nlearning how to play an instrument or\neven thankfully for me\nlistening to novel forms of music music\nthat you don't typically listen to for\n30 to 60 minutes per day and it doesn't\nhave to be every day in fact it can even\nbe just three days a week for 30 to 60\nMinutes has been shown to expand brain\nconnectivity in ways that of course\nlends itself to better musical\ncomprehension and even performance but\nlearning how to play a musical\ninstrument at any age as well as singing\nand singing especially with others in a\ngroup has been shown to enhance learning\nand the acquisition of new skills\nseparate from musical learning and\nsinging in other words it seems that\nlearning how to play an instrument and\nsinging are a gateway to neuroplasticity\nand this is again supported by\nneuroimaging data some of the more\nstriking of those data are that you know\nchildren that learn how to play one to\nthree instruments when they were a kid\nor that sang in a choir or a group or\nthat we're taught to sing solo for that\nmatter show up to 30 percent greater\nconnectivity within this particular\ntheir brain Network that links the two\nhemispheres of the brain now as soon as\nI say two hemispheres of the brain it\nstarts drawing up a lot of ideas in\npeople's heads mainly derived from pop\npsychology that you know there are\nleft-brained people and right brain\npeople\nI've touched on this before but I want\nto make this abundantly clear again now\nmost of what you've heard about\nso-called left-brained People Are\nright-brained People is complete and\ntotal nonsense it's myth there are some\nfunctions in the brain that are\nlateralized to the left or the right\nhemisphere in particular porosity they\nstart lilting and falling of speech and\nin singing is highly lateralized in the\nbrain other aspects of language can be\nlateralized in the brain but really if\nyou hear that certain people are more\nemotional or certain people are more\nlogical based on right brain left brain\nstuff that stuff is completely false\nit's complete garbage in fact it's not\nbased in any real solid data so when I\nsay that learning an instrument or\nlearning how to sing young or even as an\nadult is beneficial for increasing the\nconnectivity between the two sides of\nthe brain what that increased\nconnectivity between the two sides of\nthe brain which is by the way mediated\nthrough a structure called the corpus\ncallosum\nis not about enhancing one's emotional\ncapacity or logical capacity it's really\nabout increasing the capacity of all\nbrain circuits or at least the brain\ncircuits that are connected up directly\nwith the corpus callosum which includes\nmany brain circuits for things like\ncognition language learning speech\nmathematics a lot of people don't\nrealize this but a lot of musicians are\nalso especially Adept at mathematics and\nfor you musicians you're probably\nnodding of course right because the\nmusic is grounded in theory that has\nbasis in math and in physics something\nthat we will address in a future episode\nabout harmonics Etc\nwhen children or adults learn how to\nplay a musical instrument or several or\nhow to sing and play musical instruments\nthat increase connectivity in the corpus\ncallosum is essentially providing\nmultiple highways of option for learning\nall sorts of things so it's something\nthat I highly encourage so much so that\nI intend to finally finally learn how to\nplay an instrument I've got a particular\ninstrument in mind that I've wanted to\nlearn how to play for a very long time\nbut based on my prior experience with\ntrying to learn an instrument and\nbecause I like to consider myself a\nconsiderate person I intend to do this\nmore or less in isolation from people\nand indeed from animals as well and for\nthose of you that don't have the time or\nenergy or desire to learn new forms of\nMusic you'll be perhaps delighted to\nknow that just listening to novel forms\nof music and in particular when you\nlisten to novel forms of music and you\npay attention to that music not just\nletting it play in the background that\ntoo has been demonstrated to expand the\nbrain's capacity for neuroplasticity its\nability to modify itself and make it\nbetter at learning other sorts of things\nboth cognitive and physical so I highly\nencourage you to listen to the music you\nlove I certainly love to listen to the\nmusic that I Delight in and have for so\nmany years but there's also strong\nscientific support to encourage\nlistening to new forms of music that\nhopefully you will like but nonetheless\nthe mere foraging for and listening to\nnovel forms of Music itself seems to\nactivate brain circuitry in a way that\nallows for Better Learning and\ncomprehension of all sorts of things so\ntoday we've been talking about music in\nthe brain and I confess this is an\nenormous topic so much so that I had to\ndiscard with entire sets of data and\ndiscussion around for instance the\nmathematical structure of music and how\nthat relates to the mathematical\nstructure of firing of neurons we\ntouched on this a little bit however in\nthe context of certain frequencies of\nsounds that we hear creating certain\nfrequencies of neuronal firing and\nactivation in the brain I mean just\nthink about that how amazing that is\nit's literally like the brain playing\nyour neurons like a piano this is not\nwhat happens when you smell a particular\nodor or taste a particular taste or see\na particular face or visual stimulus\nincredible things happen within those\nsenses as well but there is something oh\nso fundamental and incredible about\nmusic and its ability to tap into our\nneural circuitry and our neural\nchemistry in ways that shift our\nemotional states and our motivational\nStates so we talked about ways that\nmusic can be leveraged to shift our\nemotional and motivational States again\nnot as a way to reduce music to its\nreductionist parts but rather to help us\ngain understanding into how the brain\nresponds to music and how we can\nleverage music of all kinds with and\nwithout lyrics how we can balance the\ncontrast between music and silence to\nincrease motivation and so on and so on\nfor those of you that are interested in\nthe more formal structure of music and\nhow it relates to brain function and\nvice versa as well as for those of you\nthat are interested in singing and\nsongwriting and more along the lines of\nlyrical content and how singing in\ngroups and how improvisation of singing\nand musical playing can impact brain\nfunction and plasticity I promise you\nthere's going to be both an expert guest\ncoming on the podcast to discuss that as\nwell as a solo episode on those topics\nagain the topic of music and the Brain\nbeing far too vast to cover in just one\nconversation with that said I hope that\ntoday's discussion allowed for you to\nthink about music differently hopefully\nit will lead you to listen to music a\nbit differently perhaps even leverage\nmusic for different purposes in your\nlife and above all to think about music\nand to enjoy music either listening to\nit or playing it or both because as you\nnow know music isn't just able to\nactivate your brain but rather your\nbrain contains vast amounts of real\nestate that are literally there to\nlisten to music if you're learning from\nand or enjoying this podcast
