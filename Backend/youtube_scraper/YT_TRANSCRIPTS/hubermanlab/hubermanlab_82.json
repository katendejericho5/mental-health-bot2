    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: [Opening theme music]\nWelcome to the Huberman Lab Guest\nseries, where I and an expert\nguest discuss s cience and science\nbased tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday's episode marks the second episode\nin our four episode series with Dr.\nPaul Conti about mental health.\nThe first episode in the series\ndealt with how to understand and\nassess your level of mental health.\nToday's episode is about how\nto improve your mental health.\nI do want to emphasize that you do not\nneed to have heard or seen the first\nepisode in order to understand or glean\nimportant information from today's episode\nabout how to improve your mental health.\nBut I do encourage you to go and\nlisten to the first episode at\nsome point if you have not already.\nToday's episode deals with several\ntopics important to all of us, as well as\nprotocols to improve one's mental health.\nFor instance, you will learn how to\nguide yourself through a process of self\ninquiry in which you address certain key\nquestions about your drives, your level\nof aggressive drive, pleasure drive,\nand the so called generative drive.\nThese are essential things to understand\nabout oneself if you want to guide\nyourself toward your aspirations, and\nif you want to understand how your\nsubconscious processing is influencing\nyour thoughts and your behaviors and\nyour feelings in ways that sometimes\nserve your aspirations, and in other\nways that can hinder your aspirations.\nDr.\nConti shares with us a way of assessing\nour internal narratives, as well as\na way of creating a constructive self\nawareness and an understanding of\nwhere those narratives and that self\nawareness stem from in our childhood,\nso that we can navigate forward\nwith the greatest sense of agency.\nWe also talk about how to move\npast common hindrances to improving\none's mental health, such as\novercoming intrusive thoughts.\nAnd perhaps most importantly, today's\nepisode provides information and\nprotocols that anyone can use to\ncultivate their generative drive,\nwhich is a hallmark of mental health.\nJust a reminder that Dr.\nPaul Conti has generously provided\na few diagrams that we include as\nPDFs in the show note captions.\nThey are completely zero cost to access,\nand they can help you understand some\nof the material that was discussed\nin t he first episode of this series,\nas well as the current episode about\nhow to improve your mental health.\nAnd while those simple PDF diagrams\nare certainly not necessary in order\nto understand the material in today's\ndiscussion or in the other discussions\nof this series, many people find them\nuseful, so I encourage you to check out\nthose links in the show note captions.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Betterhelp\n. Betterhelp offers professional\ntherapy with a licensed\ntherapist carried out online.\nI personally have been doing weekly\ntherapy for more than 30 years,\nand while that weekly therapy was\ninitiated not by my own request,\nit was in fact a requirement\nfor me to remain in high school.\nOver time, I really came to\nappreciate just how valuable\ndoing quality therapy is.\nIn fact, I look at doing quality\ntherapy much in the same way that\nI look at going to the gym or doing\ncardiovascular training such as running,\nas ways to enhance my physical health.\nI see therapy as a vital way\nto enhance one's mental health.\nThe beauty of Betterhelp is\nthat they make it very easy to\nfind an excellent therapist.\nAn excellent therapist can be defined\nas somebody who is going to be very\nsupportive of you in an objective way,\nwith whom you have excellent rapport\nwith, and who can help you arrive\nat key insights that you wouldn't\nhave otherwise been able to find.\nAnd because Betterhelp therapy is\nconducted entirely online, it's\nextremely convenient and easy to\nincorporate into the rest of your life.\nSo if you're interested in Betterhelp,\ngo to betterhelp.com/huberman\nto get 10% off your first month.\nThat's Betterhelp, spelled\nhe help.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Waking up.\nWaking up is a meditation app that\noffers dozens of guided meditation\nsessions, mindfulness trainings,\nYoga Nidra sessions and more.\nBy now, there's an abundance of data\nshowing that even short daily meditations\ncan greatly improve our mood, reduce\nanxiety, improve our ability to\nfocus, and can improve our memory.\nAnd while there are many different\nforms of meditation, most people\nfind it difficult to find and stick\nto a meditation practice in a way\nthat is most beneficial for them.\nThe Waking up app makes it extremely\neasy to learn how to meditate and\nto carry out your daily meditation\npractice in a way that's going to be\nmost effective and efficient for you.\nIt includes a variety of different types\nof meditations of different duration,\nas well as things like Yoga Nidra, which\nplace the brain and body into a sort of\npseudosleep that allows you to emerge\nfeeling incredibly mentally refreshed.\nIn fact, the science around Yoga Nidra is\nreally impressive, showing that after a\nYoga Nidra session, levels of dopamine in\ncertain areas of the brain are enhanced\nby up to 60%, which places the brain and\nbody into a state of enhanced readiness\nfor mental work and for physical work.\nAnother thing I really like about\nthe Waking up app is that it provides\na 30 day introduction course.\nSo for those of you that have not\nmeditated before or getting back to a\nmeditation practice, that's fantastic.\nOr if you're somebody who's already a\nskilled and regular meditator, waking\nup has more advanced meditations and\nYoga Nidra sessions for you as well.\nIf you'd like to try the Waking up app,\nyou can go to wakingup.com/huberman\nand access a free 30 day trial.\nAgain, that's wakingup.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nabout mental health with Dr.\nPaul Conti.\nDr.\nConti, welcome back.\nPaul Conti: Thank you.\nAndrew Huberman: In the first episode\nof this series, you laid out for us\nin a very structured way what true\nmental health looks like, essentially\nwhat we should all be aspiring to.\nAnd you touched on these themes of\nagency and gratitude as verb states,\nreally, ways of being in the world\nthat allow everybody to have some sense\nof well being, to have some sense of\nthemselves in a way that is kind to\nthemselves and to others, and really\nto feel good and do good in their life.\nWithout question, this is\nwhat people want, right?\nYou also spelled out for us these two\npillars, the structure of self and\nthe function of self, that consist\nof a number of different things that\nfrom which geyser up or kind of give\nrise to these feelings of empowerment,\nhumility, agency, and gratitude.\nAnd reminded us several times that when\nwe are challenged, when we're not doing\nas well as we would like, that we need\nto look back to the structure of self\nand the function of self and ask specific\nquestions in order to arrive or re arrive\nat this sense of agency and gratitude.\nYes, I think it would be wonderful for\nus if you could just recap the overall\nmodel because it has the components that\nI just mentioned, but some subtlety and\nsome really key aspects of these pillars\nof structure of self and function of self.\nI think if people keep in mind for\ntoday's episode, which is about\nchallenges that people commonly face,\nand even, if you will, phenotypes\nthat we see commonly out there.\nFor people that haven't heard of\nphenotypes, phenotypes are the\ntypical appearance of something.\nSo there is the phenotype of the anxious\nperson, the phenotype of the person who\njust can't seem to get out of a rut.\nThere's the phenotype of the traumatized\nperson and these things play out\ndifferently in different individuals,\nmen and women, boys and girls.\nBut we're going to visit many of the most\ncommon phenotypes out there and think\nabout how to do better, be better, feel\nbetter through the lens of the model\nthat we spelled out in episode one.\nAnd of course, if people have not seen\nor heard episode one, today's discussion\nwill still be entirely accessible to them.\nSo in keeping with that, if you could just\ngive us an overview of what this structure\nof the healthy self looks like as a\nroadmap for where we're all headed today.\nPaul Conti: Thank you.\nThanks very much.\nRevisiting the pillars is, I think,\nthe best place to start, because\nthere really are routes to understand.\nAnd if we understand, then we can\nstrategize, we can make change, right?\nWe can make things better.\nSo the first pillar, the structure of\nself, starts with the unconscious mind.\nThis incredibly complicated biological\nsupercomputer that's firing a mile a\nminute underneath the surface in us and\nis throwing up to the surface all sorts\nof thoughts and ideas and states that\nthen the conscious mind apprehends.\nThen our awareness comes into play, and\nthen we have defense mechanisms that\nsort of rise up from the unconscious\nmind, and they circle and sort of gird\nthemselves around the conscious mind,\nwhich they can do in an unhealthy way or\nin a healthy way or anything in between.\nAnd then the character structure is\nsort of the nest around all of that.\nAnd it's from the character structure\nthat we are engaging in the world\nin the ways that we're engaging.\nIt's our active engagement\nwith the world around us.\nAnd the idea is that the\nself grows out of that.\nIt grows out of that nest sitting on\ntop of the unconscious mind to the\nconscious mind rising above the defense\nmechanisms and the character structure.\nAnd if we go back to that, when\nwe're trying to understand ourselves,\ntrying to understand states of health\nas well as states of unhappiness or\nstates that aren't healthy, by going\nback and looking at the structure,\nwe can learn a tremendous amount.\nAnd the other side, the other\npillar, is the function of self.\nAnd it really starts\nwith a self awareness.\nThe awareness that, hey, there\nis an I, I am in the world.\nThis is 24 hours in the day are\ngoing to pass today, and I'm going\nto be doing one thing or another.\nI'm to some very significant extent\ndeciding how am I going to engage in\nthe world around me during that time.\nSo on top of that are the\ndefense mechanisms in action.\nSo defense mechanisms,\nremember, are unconscious.\nSo there's a lot then going on\ninside of us that's determining\nsort of the field set of options.\nThere may be a lot of automaticity\nthat narrows down the set of options\nof what we may entertain, what we\nmay be aware of, what we may decide.\nAnd that could happen for better\nor for worse, depending upon the\nhealth of the defense mechanisms.\nBut on top of that lies salient.\nSo the idea then we would next visit,\nokay, what are we paying attention to.\nWhat's coming from inside,\nwhat's coming from outside.\nAnd we have to not pay attention to\nmany, many things in order to pay\nattention to whatever our attention\nhas alighted on at the moment.\nSo it's a complex process, and it's\nworth looking at very closely if\nwe want to understand ourselves.\nSo after thinking about the defense\nmechanisms in action, the unconscious\naspects of how we're engaging with\nthe world, then next to consider\nis salience, which is sort of\nwhere does the mind arrive at rest?\nWhere does the mind trend towards?\nIs it something internal?\nIs it something external?\nWhat are all the things we're\nnot paying attention to in order\nto pay attention to something?\nAnd is that thing healthy?\nIs it not healthy?\nIs it serving us well?\nSo there's so much to\nunderstand about salience.\nAnd then the next step beyond\nthat is understanding behavior.\nHow are we engaging with\nthe world around us?\nWhat are our behavioral choices?\nWhat are our automatic behaviors?\nAnd then sitting on top of\nall of that are our strivings.\nSo we have a sense of wanting something\nin the world around us, and what is\nthat, and how are we trying to get\nto it, and how does it make us feel?\nSo if we look at the ten elements, the\nfive under the structure of self and\nthe five under the function of self,\nthen what we're really looking at is\nsort of like looking at ten cabinets.\nAnd if we're trying to understand\nourselves, whether we're trying to just\ngenerally understand ourselves or we're\ntrying to get at a problem, then looking\nin all ten of those cabinets makes sense.\nSome of them will be bare, meaning that\nthey may seem to have very little to\ndo with the problem we're bringing.\nAnd we kind of maintain an open mind.\nWe may be led back to that cabinet,\nand there may be something there.\nBut what usually happens is if we look\nin all ten places, we find a couple\nwhere there's some rich material to\nexplore, sort of the X marks the spot,\nand then we go and we dig there to sort\nof mix metaphors we dig in the cabinet\nwhere we're going to find something.\nAnd then it leads forward\na process of understanding.\nAnd if we're bringing those things into\nline, where we have a healthy structure\nof self and a healthy function of self,\nand we're aware of all of this and we're\nworking on it, we're self aware, and\nwe're paying attention to everything\nbuilt on top of that, then what we end\nup with is a sense of humility, because\none cannot be anything but respectful,\ncompassionate understanding the complexity\nof all of this and understanding,\nhow does it manifest itself in us?\nAnd just the very fact that\nwe can make our ways in the\nworld, right, is so impressive.\nAnd in a way, I think it brings to\nus a respect, just a respect for\nbeing here, navigating the world.\nAnd I think of that\nrespect is born humility.\nThe complexity of us, the fact that\nmillions of things are going on underneath\nthe surface, millions of neurotransmission\nand endocrinological function.\nAll of this is going on under the surface.\nI'm not even aware of it.\nAnd then it kicks up to the surface,\ngenerates a tremendous amount of\nrespect for the complexity and also\nthe diligence and perseverance it\ntakes us to navigate through the world.\nAnd I think built upon that\nunderstanding is a sense of\nhumility and a sense of empowerment.\nAnd the humility and\nempowerment in action, right?\nSo expressed, become agency and gratitude.\nAnd agency and gratitude, as you said\nat the beginning, we're seeing as verbs.\nThat's how we're living life.\nIt's through the lens, so to\nspeak, of agency and gratitude\nthat we're actively living.\nAnd again, I would put forth that\nwhen we look at measures of human\nhappiness across disciplines and across\ntime, this is always what we see is\nsome way of describing how agency\nand gratitude, together, as verbs,\nmanifest and then create happiness.\nIt's the state that we're seeking\nto be in, because from that state of\nactive agency and active gratitude,\nwe achieve what it is that I\nthink we're really searching for.\nAnd there are infinite words throughout\nhuman history to describe what that is.\nWe might choose to use words like\npeacefulness, a sense of peace, a sense\nof contentment, being delighted by things,\nlike just being amazed and impressed\nby things in the world around us.\nLike, this is a state\nthat we're striving for.\nAnd I think when people talk about\nhappiness and what we're really\ntrying to get to, it's this.\nBut it's not that these\nthings are passive.\nThese things are coming from the\nactive agency, the active gratitude.\nAnd they're then interacting with\na generative drive within us.\nWe have an aggressive drive.\nWe have a pleasure drive like this\nhas been thought about now for a\nlong, long time within mental health\nand validated in a lot of ways.\nBut what hasn't been validated is\nthat they're the only things, right?\nWe see human beings striving.\nWe see human beings wanting better for\nthemselves and for the world around them.\nWe see acts of kindness that\nseem to be rooted to nothing\nother than the act of kindness.\nWe have within us a drive to know, to\nunderstand, to learn, to make better.\nAnd that has been described as many,\nmany things across human history.\nBut I think the words we might\nchoose are a generative drive, a\ndrive to create and to make better.\nAnd it's the generative drive as something\nactive within us that is then aligning\nwith agency and gratitude, the active\nways in which we express ourselves.\nAnd then that altogether brings\nus the peace, the contentment,\nthe sense of delight.\nSometimes that may exist\nin us in a state of rest.\nBut very often it's existing\nin us in a state of activity.\nAnd that's why people find the quote\nunquote happiness, like what people\nare seeking, not just in meditation.\nSometimes we can find it there, but\npeople also find it in action, right?\nThey find it in doing that thing that\nthey love to do, or in taking care\nof someone and learning something.\nSo when we look at all of this, we\ncan then have a route of understanding\nwhat is going on inside of us and\nhow we can make the changes that\nlet us be in this state, which is\nreally the state that we are seeking.\nAndrew Huberman: I really appreciate\nthat you highlight that agency and\ngratitude are verb states from which\npeace, contentment and delight emerge.\nAnd also the way that you explain\nthe generative drive that is distinct\nfrom aggressive drives and pleasure\ndrives that exist in all of us.\nI'm smiling because a number of\nexamples of peace, contentment, and\ndelight while in action come to mind.\nI mean, for me, podcasting, and in\nparticular, preparing for a podcast,\ntrying to mine the literature and\nfigure out where the gems reside and\nwhere the confusion could emerge.\nAnd all of that brings about such\npeace, contentment and delight for\nme, but it's anything but passive.\nLikewise, yesterday had the\nexperience of running into a puppy.\nIt's been a while since I've owned\na dog, and dogs are delightful.\nPuppies are particularly delightful.\nPaul Conti: I had the experience of seeing\nyou light up when you ran into the puppy.\nAndrew Huberman: You did, and\nI'm still buzzing from that\nshort interaction with the puppy.\nDownstairs the way Mariner puppy.\nI don't know why, but I just delight\nin animals of most all kinds.\nNot a fan of reptiles, sorry, reptile fans\nso much, but I just drive so much energy\nfrom it, and it felt like life energy.\nAnd the way the animal is sort of\nattentionally scattered is amusing\nto me as compared to the dog that he\nwill eventually be, which is going\nto be more linear in his thinking.\nIt encapsulates so much of\nthe other things I love, like\nbrain development, et cetera.\nAnyway, I highlight those examples\nbecause there's nothing passive about it.\nIt's pure delight and joy for me, and it\nintersects with other delights and joys.\nAnd I think that as you describe agency\nand gratitude, peace, contentment and\ndelight in these generative forces as\nwell as other forces that exist in us,\nI think it's really critical that people\nunderstand that these are not states\nthat you sit down and place yourself\ninto, although perhaps one could through\nreflection or meditation or waking\nup from a really great night's sleep,\nthings of that sort, but that these are\nthings that we can find ourselves awash\nin if we are doing the right things.\nAnd those things can\noftentimes be very challenging.\nSo assuming I understand the way the\nmodel is spelled out correctly, I'm\nmore and more delighted at the fact\nthat this is not just accessible in\none domain, but is accessible in many,\nmany different domains for everybody.\nThis is not something unique to my\nexperience, even though I give examples\nfrom my own life, but that we really all\ndo have access to this if we're looking\nin those cupboards, those ten cupboards,\nand asking the right questions and.\nPaul Conti: To maybe comment\neven a little further on the\nexperience of you and the dog.\nSo it was an experience of delight.\nAnd you enjoyed it, and it brought\na sense of peace and contentment,\nlike, all of that happens.\nBut think about what that's linked to.\nI believe there's a strong sense of\nagency in you that you are enacting.\nThere's a strong gratitude\nin you that you're enacting.\nYou're handling your life in a way.\nAnd also for all of us, good things always\ncome with good fortune, but it comes with\nour strivings and our achievements that\nyou're in a place to delight in that.\nIf you are unhappy, like, I don't\nlike what I'm doing, I'm angry,\nI'm frustrated, then there's no\nroom in you to find the delight.\nAnd the delight that you find is also\nvery much linked to the generative drive.\nIt makes me think of how you\nloved and nurtured Costello.\nSo you have it in you to love and\nnurture a dog, and you have done\nthat in a really wonderful way.\nAnd that generative drive is part\nand parcel of the delight you\nfeel when you see a dog, because\nyou love dogs and you think about\nnurturing, and it all comes together.\nThe agency and the gratitude expressed\nas verbs puts you in a position to\nhave that sense of delight which is\nso intertwined with your generative\ndrive, with a sense of caretaking,\na sense of creating the beyond self.\nBecause although you enjoyed\nand loved Casello, you enjoyed\nand loved his happiness, right?\nSo it all comes together.\nAnd I think it's interesting\nbecause in some ways it's a\nsimple example, but that's life.\nLife has its big moments, but so\nmuch of our lives are the smaller\nmoments that link together.\nAnd I think that smaller\nmoment becomes a big example.\nAndrew Huberman: I appreciate\nthat you mentioned Costello.\nFor listeners of this podcast that have\ntuned into early episodes, Costello was\nthe source of the background snoring.\nFor those of you that\nhaven't, you can go check.\nHe was a 90 pound English bulldog\nmastiff who had many skills,\nthe best of which was snoring.\nSo in addition to the generative\ndrive, which is something that we\ncertainly want to talk more about\ntoday, you mentioned these other drives,\naggressive drives and pleasure drives.\nAnd much of what we're talking about\ntoday is going to be where people can\ngo wrong or where people struggle.\nWe are also, of course, going to go\ndeeply into where people succeed and\nin particular where people can ask\nquestions of themselves, in particular\nwhat is working for them and why, as\na route to understanding how to sift\nthrough those cupboards and understand\nwhat's not working and why, and come\nup with real actionable answers and\nthen the ability to move forward.\nSo if you would, could you tell\nus a little bit more about drives?\nGenerally, when I hear drives, I\ncan't help as a neuroscientist,\nbut default to, okay, the dopamine\ncircuit, or the endogenous opioid\ncircuit, or the serotonergic circuit.\nBut how do you conceptualize\ndrives within us?\nAnd then perhaps you could tell us what\nthe nature of aggressive drives and\npleasure drives and generative drives.\nPaul Conti: So the concept of a\ndrive, the definition of a drive, is\nsomething that's intrinsic to humans.\nSo we could look at it as a motivation.\nI mean, we don't just lie on the ground\nand do nothing until we passively die.\nSo something is going on inside\nof us that is driving us to\ndo something other than that.\nAnd historically, the thinking in the\nfield arising from early psychodynamic\nprinciples, the theory in the field that\nhas really dominated the field, either\ndirectly or indirectly, in so many ways,\nhas been that there are two drives within\nus, that there's aggression and pleasure.\nAnd again, these are just words, right?\nSo we could apply many, many\nwords, which is why, of course,\nwe want to define what that means.\nSo aggression, even though we're using\nthat word for it, because the word\nfor it is commonly used, but it means\nsort of forward active engagement.\nSo a good, healthy amount of aggression\nusing that word for the drive\nwould be a strong sense of agency.\nToo little aggression can be a\nproblem, then the person isn't\nbringing themselves to bear.\nSo there's too little in the way\nof self determination, forward\nmovement, empowerment, agency, right.\nAnd in the same way, too much of\nthis drive becomes actual aggression.\nSo the idea that I want more,\nand if I can't get it in certain\nways, I'll just take it, right.\nSo it starts to become what we more\nmap to the word aggression, which would\nbe something negative in most cases.\nAndrew Huberman: Like a\ndesire or a tendency to harm.\nPaul Conti: Sure.\nAs aggressive drives get higher,\nwhich you see why they're in us,\nbecause let's say we're defending\nourselves, or you're defending a\nfamily member or like an entire family.\nThen it makes sense to have high levels of\naggression if your family is threatened.\nSo those drives are in us at potentially\nthose high levels for a reason.\nBut we certainly access very high\nlevels of aggression without the\nindication of preservation of\nlife or preservation of safety.\nThe thought is, that's a drive\nin us, and that gets us up and\noff the ground, so to speak.\nAnd that the other drive, then, is\npleasure, which, again, doesn't just\nmean that we all want to be hedonists.\nSo pleasure could be even the\npleasure of relief and safety.\nWe're all back in the cave together, and\nwe roll the stone in front of the door.\nWe're safe.\nThroughout human development,\npleasure comes in a lot of ways.\nIt can come through the pleasure of food\nor other people, friendship, romance, sex.\nThere are a lot of ways\nwe can achieve pleasure.\nIt can be relief of things that\nare unpleasant, relief of pain.\nBut there's a drive towards\nthis in humans, which, again,\nreally does make sense.\nAnd too little of it, again, can be\nproblematic because the person, then isn't\nmotivated to sort of seek things because\nthey're not anticipating or don't receive\ngratification and too much of a drive\nfor pleasure can also create problems.\nWe can kind of see how these two\ndrives, like, okay, they get us up\nand off the ground, so to speak.\nBut the question is, do\nthey explain everything?\nAnd it's a very important question,\nbecause if they explain everything,\nthen there's not room for behaviors\nand choices that are beyond the self.\nRight?\nThere's not an explanation\nfor the person who.\nI'll give you an example of a person\nI've taken care of, who's just a very\nstrong swimmer, knows how to swim,\nhas swimmed throughout his life, who\nwas in a place, I saw video of it,\nwhere there had been a hurricane,\nand the waves were so frightening.\nThey were just this huge surf, and there\nwere people who had gotten dragged out.\nAnd you just see him,\nhe runs into the water.\nHe runs in and he goes.\nAnd he was really at risk.\nHe needed to be saved\nhimself, but he saved them.\nAnd I do not believe you can\nexplain that through these drives.\nI don't think you can say,\nwell, he was aggressive.\nHe wanted to go and do something that\nwas imposing himself on the world,\nor he got pleasure in thinking,\nI'm strong enough to go do this.\nI mean, I think we're really gyrating,\nwe're contorting ourselves, right,\nin order to explain it that way.\nIf we think there's a goodness\nin that man's heart, like, I\nknow there's a goodness in that\nman's heart, I know him, right?\nAnd that goodness sees him in the\nmoment, and he knows that maybe\nhe can save them, maybe he can.\nHe's not sure, but maybe he can.\nSo the next thing you\nknow, he's in the water.\nAnd I think things like the love and\nnurturing of other people, of children,\nlove and nurturing of animals, of plants.\nThere are things inside of us that we\ncan't explain with those two drives.\nAnd I think they have led to\na very sort of darker way of\njust conceiving of humans.\nI think it's a reason why now you look\nat us in the modern day and age, we come\nat humans through the lens of pathology.\nI mean, there's a very, very thick\nbook that if a person is assessing,\nanother person is thinking about, like,\nokay, what numbers in that book apply.\nWhich is like, that's not the way\nto go about understanding humans.\nAnd I think if we just think\nthere are those two drives, we're\nnot doing justice to humans.\nOne, I think it's not true.\nI think it's evident that it's not true.\nAnd then if we're framing\nit in a way that's not true.\nWe are not appropriately\nrespectful of humans.\nAnd if we come from what I believe\nto be the truth, that there is a\ngenerative drive in us, a drive for\nthe beyond self, a drive to make\nthings better, whether it has anything\nreally directly to do with me or not.\nAnd as with the other drives, there\ncan be more or less, in people, a\ncombination of nature and nurture what\ngenetically is in us, a predisposition\nbased upon the genetic lineage that\ncomes down to us and the recombination.\nAnd now we're a unique person with\na unique set of drives, but they are\nimpacted by the genetics and then they're\nimpacted by life experience, a more\nstrongly formative life experience.\nSo the younger the person, the\nsort of deeper the impact of events\nthey have, nurturing versus abuse\non the array, on the relative\nweighting of drives within people.\nBut ultimately, we get to these\nthree drives and how they're\nfunctioning in a person, being a way\nof understanding and assessing how\nhealthy or not healthy the person is.\nAnd then we look back to those\nten cupboards for the answers.\nIf we're finding things that we don't\nlike, those drives are out of balance.\nAnd here are the problems they're causing.\nSo very, very concrete issues\nof problems in people's lives.\nWe can look and see where\nis that out of balance.\nAnd if it's out of balance,\nthere's something in those pillars\nthat are not in the right place.\nWe can then go back and look in\nall those cupboards for, like, oh,\nwhere do we dig to find the answer?\nWe learn things, we bring\nthings more into balance.\nSo the pillars are in a healthier place.\nAnd then what sits on top of\nit, as you use the word geyser.\nThe geyser that then comes up\nand floats everything on top of\nit can do that in a healthy way.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nDuring episode one, we touched on\nsome of the similarities between\nunderstanding the self and building\ntowards a healthy or healthiest version\nof self, where agency and gratitude are\nthese states that are being expressed.\nAnd one of the themes there was this\nidea, you know, people perhaps want to be\nhealthy so that they live a long time, but\npresumably they also want to be healthy\nso that they can walk up flights of\nstairs, pick up their kids, move objects,\nnot get injured, perhaps even do sport.\nAnd of course, some people want to be\nhealthy for aesthetic reasons as well.\nAnd if we were having a discussion about\nphysical health, we could address the\nmajor pillars there, which were items\nwithin the covered, like most people\nwant some ability to have endurance\nor stamina to walk some distance\nor maybe even run some distance.\nAs I mentioned before, walk up a flight\nof stairs, have some strength, some degree\nof flexibility, certainly some mobility,\nmaybe even dynamic mobility, et cetera.\nAnd in order to address those or improve\nupon those, they could look in those\ncovers and say, well, how much running,\nswimming, long form cardiovascular\nexercise am I doing per week?\nHow many steps am I taking per day?\nHow many times a week do I lift objects\nthat are slightly heavier than is\ncomfortable for me to lift, et cetera?\nIt's very tangible, very concrete.\nHere you're making the psyche and the\nself and mental health very much concrete\nin some of the same way, saying, there\nare ten cupboards that one can look in,\nand these drives, as you refer to them as\ngenerative drive, aggressive drive, and\npleasure drive, you'll probably tell us in\na few minutes, can be expressed to varying\ndegrees in different people and how\nthat shows up and what that looks like.\nAnd I just want to frame this in\npeople's minds as very similar to\naddressing whether or not, okay, if\nsomebody can run very long distances,\nbut they're always having aches and\npains, or they feel weak, or they are\nweak, there are good reasons for that.\nThey're overemphasizing\none form of exercise.\nThe expression is more along the\nlines of endurance and stamina,\nnot strength, or vice versa.\nThe power lifter who can lift 750\npounds from the floor in a deadlift,\nbut walks up two flights of stairs\nand is belly breathing and has\nto stop at the top of the stairs.\nIt's obvious in the physical realm,\nit's slightly more cryptic, or more\ncryptic in the psychological realm,\nbut here it's becoming concrete for us.\nPaul Conti: I think it's very\ninteresting and very ironic.\nRight?\nSo the field that I'm in, the field\nof psychiatry, has historically wanted\nto be sort of part of the rest of\nmedicine, or like the rest of medicine.\nAnd what I believe it's ended up\ndoing is glorifying a taxonomy,\nglorifying a category, mechanism\nof understanding human beings.\nSo in the way that if I'm practicing\ngeneral medicine and you come in and\nyou're congested, and I determine,\nlike, oh, you have bacterial sinusitis.\nSo now I've made a diagnosis,\nand now I know what I'm going to\ndo about that, okay, I'm going\nto prescribe an antibiotic.\nNow, the thought comes\nin of what antibiotic.\nBut the identify sinusitis, now\nyou need an antibiotic, is like\nkind of how medicine works.\nSo the thought was psychiatry is\ngoing to categorize everything.\nSo we'd say, okay, I've listened to you\nlike, I know your number or your numbers.\nAnd then once I've given you the\nnumbers, now I know what to do.\nI prescribe this medicine, that\nmedicine, these many sessions of\na certain kind of psychotherapy.\nAnd that doesn't work.\nIt doesn't work in mental health.\nIt may.\nIt's not that it never works,\nbut if you're going to try and\nunderstand people, it's different.\nA problem of self.\nIf I have a lack of confidence\nin one area of life and not in\nothers, that's a significant issue.\nIt is not like bacterial\nsinusitis, where then, okay, arrow\ngoes to prescribe antibiotic.\nAnd I think what is ironic is that this\nroute of approach actually does bring\npsychiatry or mental health into line\nwith the rest of medicine, r ight.\nWhich is why you can make that\nparallel and it fits well, right.\nWhen you're making the\nparallel to physical health\nand to I want to be healthy.\nOkay, what are the components of that?\nWhat am I doing to achieve that\nif something's not the way I want?\nLet me go back and look\nat those components.\nIt may be because it's more\ntangible, sort of essentially\neasier to comprehend, right.\nBecause it's more concrete.\nBut I don't, in a sense, see it\nas cryptic, just less obvious.\nBut if we go and we look at it and\nwe say, oh, that really makes sense.\nIn a sense, it makes sense\nthat it makes sense, right?\nIf there's a mechanism of understanding\nthat applies to lots and lots of things\nthat are more concrete, why would\na similar kind of mechanism, like\nunderstand what the components are,\nunderstand what's built on top of them?\nThis, I believe, is how psychiatry\nactually fits with the rest of medicine,\nnot by glorifying a taxonomy, but by\ncoming through the lens of understanding.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah,\nI couldn't agree more.\nAnd I think that what's so reassuring is\nthat both in terms of creating physical\nhealth across the various domains of\nheart health, lung health, endurance,\nstrength, et cetera, cognitive health,\nas well as mental health is verbs.\nIt comes back to action items that\nwe each and all should engage in, in\norder to arrive at the states and ways\nof being that we all want to be in.\nRight.\nWe want to feel healthy,\nlook healthy, et cetera.\nWe want to be happy.\nI know very few people who\ndon't want to be happy.\nI mean, certainly there are people\nwho give up, but we'll talk about\nthat today and routes out of that.\nBut at the end of the day, it's all\nabout looking in those bins, asking\nspecific questions, and then moving\nforward in specific actions to get to\nthe place of empowerment, humility,\nagency, gratitude, peace, contentment,\ndelight, et cetera, as opposed to simply\nusing words and understanding to arrive\nat insight and then stopping there\nand expecting everything to change.\nAnd I think that's where a lot\nof people are confused about\npsychology, therapy and psychiatry.\nAnd as you mentioned, psychiatry has\nits own shadows, if you will, within it,\nwhere the use of drugs, which certainly\ncan be very useful, even life saving.\nPaul Conti: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: Oftentimes is seen as\na fix all that somehow could reorder\neverything within the cupboards and\nmake the recipe just right, when\nin fact, we'll talk about today.\nThat is generally not the best route,\nbut again, with the understanding\nthat drugs can be very powerful, tools\nPaul Conti: Play a role.\nYeah, right.\nBut it's important we understand\nwhat role is appropriate for them,\nand that's where we often go astray.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd like to take a\nbrief break and acknowledge one of\nour sponsors, AG1 . AG1 is a vitamin,\nmineral probiotic drink that meets all\nof your foundational nutrition needs.\nI started taking AG1 way back\nin 2012, so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking AG1, and the\nreason I still take AG1 once, or generally\ntwice per day, is that it's the easiest\nway for me to ensure that I'm getting\nall of the vitamins, minerals, probiotics\nand fiber that I need in my diet.\nNow, of course, it's essential to get\nproper nutrition from whole foods,\nbut most people, including myself,\nfind it hard to get enough servings\nof fruits and vegetables each day, and\nespecially to get enough prebiotics\nand probiotics to ensure gut health.\nAs you may know, your gut contains\ntrillions of little microbiota,\nthe so called gut microbiome, which\nestablishes critical connections with\nother organs of your body to enhance\nbrain health, as well as to support your\nimmune system and other aspects that\nrelate to mental and physical health.\nOne of the most common questions I get is,\nif you were to take just one supplement,\nwhich supplement would that be?\nAnd my answer is always AG1, because\nby taking AG1, I'm able to ensure\nthat I'm getting all of the vitamins,\nminerals and probiotics that I\nneed to enhance my mental health,\nphysical health and performance.\nIf you'd like to try AG1,\ngo to drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel\npacks, and they'll give you a\nyear supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain, that's drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim this special offer.\nSo as we move forward here in defining\nand helping people gain, for lack of\na better word, agency over their own\nmental health and self understanding, and\ndefining for them what action items to\ntake, I'd like to ask you about some of\nthe things that I observe in the world\nand hear a lot about, in particular\nfrom the audience of this podcast.\nIt's obvious to me that people\nvary in terms of their level of\naggressive drive, pleasure drive, and\npresumably generative drive as well.\nOne common question is, how\ndo I become more motivated?\nRight?\nAnd of course, that opens up a\nbunch of other questions, like,\nare people afraid of failure?\nAnd that's why they're not motivated?\nAre people afraid of success?\nIs that why they're not motivated?\nIs there some underlying childhood\ntrauma or unconscious process\nthat's driving that fear?\nAnd so on?\nBut if we were to take the psychiatrist's\nperspective, your perspective, if\nsomeone comes to you and says, I\njust don't really feel like trying.\nSchool is hard, school loans are\nexcessive, which is true, by the way.\nIt's not even clear that with a degree I\ncan do much, or I had a series of failures\nin the work domain or in the relationship\ndomain, and they're just feeling weighed\ndown as if it's not worth trying.\nWhat does that tell you\nin terms of where to look?\nAnd what does that tell you\nin terms of their drives?\nI mean, do we conclude something\nabout their innate level of\naggressive drive or their pleasure\ndrive or their generative drive?\nI think there are many such people out\nthere, and then we'll consider some\nother kind of phenotypic examples.\nPaul Conti: So it's a great example\nbecause any good clinician could hear\nthat story and have thoughts about it\nthat could and would hopefully be helpful\nwithout necessarily referring to drives.\nI think you can anchor any set of\nassessments, any evaluation, any\nattempted understanding to drives,\nbut it doesn't have to be that way.\nSo, for example, you might ask that\nperson more questions about what\nthey're doing, how they spend their\ntime, because you're telling me about\nsomeone who's not getting enjoyment\nor gratification out of anything.\nAnd that then becomes of interest to me.\nIs there something this person does enjoy\nor something they'd rather be doing?\nDid they go to college and take on\na bunch of loans because they felt\nthat was better, because they thought\nthey were going to do something\nthat now they actually don't want\nto do ? Or that opportunity isn't\nthere, and now they're frustrated?\nWhat is inside this person that\nmight seem different than that.\nAnd again, the answers\ncould be complicated.\nIt could be.\nMaybe that person enjoys what\nthey're doing, but the cost of\nliving where they are is so high\nthat they still feel miserable.\nThere's a sense of privation, and then\nthat gets backmapped to like, I'm not\ngetting any pleasure out of anything.\nSo the answer could be as simple as\nyou strategize with the person of,\nfor example, does a person like that\nmove or move to a different area?\nThere's so many ways of looking at this\nand so many ways of understanding this.\nBut you're describing someone to me\nwho is kind of really complaining\nthat nothing is feeling good, right?\nNothing's providing a sense of\nenjoyment or of pleasure, right?\nSo I would probably be interested in that\nfirst and think maybe the pleasure drive\nis higher than what's being fulfilled.\nMaybe the pleasure drive is low, and\nthat's an issue in and of itself.\nWe sort of learn those things.\nMaybe the aggressive drive is\nlow, and if that person just put a\nlittle more energy into it, right.\nLike they could be in a different place.\nSo you try and help the person understand\nthemselves so that you can make change.\nAnd again, that understanding doesn't\nhave to be anchored to the drives.\nBut I do believe the drives are at the\nroot of all understanding, because if\nyou sit with that person and you talk to\nthat person, then you're going to be able\nto understand what is out of balance,\neither in the actual array of the drives\nor in how they're being experienced.\nBecause again, if you have a\nhigh pleasure drive, for example,\nand it's not gratified, right.\nThat represents a problem.\nAndrew Huberman: What about people who\ncan experience some pleasure or can keep\nbusy, say, for instance, on social media\nor playing video games and I should\nalso say perhaps it's bringing them to a\nplace of peace, contentment and delight.\nBut in some sense, it's\nnot really generative.\nI'm not going to cast judgment and\nsay that video games and social\nmedia are all a waste of time.\nI mean, I'm on social media trying\nto provide value to people and\nlearnings, and I derive value and\nlearnings from other accounts as well.\nBut there are these milestones,\nif you will, in life.\nI mean, not that everyone has to go to\ncollege and get married and have a family.\nThere are a lot of different paths through\nlife that I would consider successful.\nBut in some sense, there are milestones,\nlike we want to move forward.\nThere's this phenomenon nowadays of a\nlot of young people so called failure\nto launch, like they're not leaving\nhome or they're not finding a vocation.\nThey're not feeling as if\nthey're good at anything.\nOr they have the sense that unless\nyou're going to be top 1% in\nsomething, it's not worth trying.\nBut they can still find what most\npeople would describe as pleasures.\nLike they might enjoy food\nmaybe a little too much.\nThey enjoy alcohol\nmaybe a little too much.\nThey enjoy social media or video\ngames, maybe a little too much.\nAnd I say a little too much because\nit's providing more or less a\nsink or a reservoir for their\naggressive and pleasure drives.\nThat's not moving them forward in\nthe standard milestones of life.\nI hear about that a lot.\nI see that a lot.\nSo it's a slightly more complex phenotype\nthan described before as just simply\nthe a motivated or non motivated person.\nBut what do you think of the\nphenotype I just described?\nPaul Conti: Because we're unique.\nEach person is unique,\nalthough we fit categories.\nSo there are categories a person\nthere could fit that could be\ndifferent from what I'm saying.\nBut I think most people,\nthey say on balance.\nWhat is most prominent?\nI think what is most prominent in that\nsituation is there's something out\nof balance in the generative drive\n.\n And what you see a lot of times is\nthe person has a generative drive\nin them that's higher than their\nability to realize that drive.\nThe generative drive then is frustrated.\nSo I'll give an example.\nAnd it's a real true story of a person\nwho had worked very, very hard, gone\nto school for a long time, and had\nachieved a very high paying job.\nAnd that was the goal.\nIt's a prestigious job,\nit's a high paying job.\nAnd the person for a while was doing quite\nwell at it, and things went relatively\nrapidly in a negative direction.\nSo maybe for a little while,\nthe person's doing okay.\nThen the person becomes very negligent\nof themselves and their environment\nwhen they're not at the job.\nSo the house is a mess, things are dirty,\nthe person is wasting time with things.\nSo this is a person who enjoys\nit wasn't exactly video games.\nLet's say it could have been.\nWell, it enjoys them to a certain\ndegree and can really gain pleasure\nand feel good about the time spent\n.\n But starts spending too much time.\nNow what was pleasurable starts\nbecoming a distraction mechanism.\nAnd then what that transitioned\nto was overuse of alcohol.\nSo now you have either something that\nis actually destructive and was negative\nto job performance towards the person.\nThis wasn't a person who was drinking\na lot before, and this is a person who\nwas miserable when they were drinking\nor they were sort of wasting their time.\nAnd we're aware of all of this.\nWell, there was a very clear problem,\nwhich is that that person had no\ninterest in what they were doing.\nNone whatsoever.\nIt felt like the majority of waking\nhours were spent in an automaton like\nway, but being awake and aware of the\ntedium of it, the frustration of it.\nAndrew Huberman: The professional side.\nSo they essentially had very little\nintrinsic curiosity or desire to do the\njob that they were successfully doing.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nWhich comes out only after exploration,\nbecause it seems like, well,\nwhat's going on with this person?\nThis person has a good job and\ntheir life was going really well,\nand they're doing well financially.\nAnd is this person trying to\nnow overly indulge themselves?\nIs that why they're drinking?\nWhat's going on?\nAnd what you feel is that this person\nhad a strong, generative drive, and it\nwasn't met one little bit by what he was\ndoing, which was creating such frustration\ninside that the person was either\ntaking himself online or doing something\nthat was punitive and self injurious.\nAnd this is a real story.\nThe person exchanged that job\nfor a job that paid a 10th of\nwhat the job they had paid.\nAnd the change in the\nperson's life was amazing.\nLike, I didn't know this guy could smile.\nHe became happy.\nHe loved what he was doing.\nHe sold the larger house,\nbought a smaller house, kept it\nbeautifully, like he was happy.\nThat's what he needed to be happy.\nBecause then the generative drive in\nhim, he loved what he was doing, gets\nenacted, it gets expressed, and then\nother things can come then into line.\nHe's not being over aggressive towards\nhimself and drinking too much because\nhe's saying, oh, to help with you, to\nthe world around him and to himself.\nHe's not taking something that\nserves a purpose in his life.\nLike, again, if the example had been video\ngames, it would be like, yeah, great.\nYou enjoy doing that X amount of time and\ngo do that and get gratification from it,\nas opposed to then over relying on it.\nAnd then it's not providing gratification.\nIt becomes a distraction.\nSo those things came back into\nbalance in his life, but there\nhad to be the understanding.\nAnd I think there's a lot of that in\npeople who have a generative drive in\nthem that they feel is frustrated by a\nworld around them that isn't cooperating.\nNow, do I think we can understand that\nand change that in the vast majority\nof people who are in that place.\nYes, but it has to be\nlooked at first, right.\nBecause it's not always that.\nIt's just that a lot of the time.\nSo it has to be understood\nwhat is it in that person?\nAnd then how do you go back to those\npillars and look at what's going on,\nthat the person is in that place?\nBecause the world can bring us\na lot of difficulties, right?\nAnd that person who now is saddled\nwith a lot more loans than they expect.\nI have tremendous compassion\nfor that and sympathy for that.\nThat's real.\nRight?\nSo people can be up against a lot of\nthings and that's just one of them, right?\nBut it doesn't mean\nthat life can't be okay.\nIt doesn't mean that, but the person has\nto feel that there's some way, they have\nto understand enough about themselves\nto say, okay, this is what this is.\nAnd I kind of see what this\nis and why and how I'm here.\nAnd from there I can start to plot\na route to something that is better\nbecause, yes, we have our difficulties\nand we can have a lot of them, right?\nBut for the vast majority of us, it's\nnot like they're not surmountable.\nWe have to just understand them.\nAnd let's say if that person goes and\nsays, I'm going to get some help, and\nthey go and someone says, okay, you get\nten sessions of cognitive behavioral\ntherapy and you try and like, how\ncan that person think differently?\nThen they'll feel differently.\nAnd look, cognitive behavioral\ntherapy has its place, right?\nBut it's not going to solve that.\nThat person needs to understand\nsomething about themselves, not redirect\ntheir thoughts to better places.\nSo if the person gets a reflex, because\nthat reflex works well for the system,\na reflex works well for the system\nthat's treating that person, for the\nmedical system, the insurance system,\nthat person isn't helped one bit, right?\nAnd maybe a medicine can help.\nMaybe a medicine helps to just take down\nthe anxiety and the tension in the person.\nThen the person can sort\nof think more about it.\nAnd truly medicine did help this person\nbecause the idea of leaving the job.\nI'm leaving the prestige, I'm leaving\nthe money, is that okay to do like?\nIt generated a lot of anxiety and\nit helped to kind of bring the\ntemperature down a little bit of\nthat so that he could think about\nit, engage in therapy, ultimately\nnavigate to where he wanted to be.\nThen we could back away from the medicine.\nSo medicine has a role.\nBut if he just got medicine, what\nare the odds of that helping?\nLike, zero, right?\nBecause it's not going to make\nthe answers unless somehow the\nperson feels a little bit better\nand figures it out on their own.\nIt's not how it works, right?\nSo medicine has its place, but a kind of\ntherapy that recognizes the limitations\nof medicine in most situations and\nis designed to really help the person\nunderstand, like, that's what we need.\nAndrew Huberman: The example you gave\nis a spectacular one because, as you\nmentioned, medication had its place.\nPerhaps even redirection of thought in\nsome sense had its place, because, as I\nrecall, under the pillar of function of\nself, one of the key items is salience.\nWhat we pay attention to\ninternally or externally, what\nour internal narratives are.\nBut in staying with the example of this\nindividual, again as a phenotypic example\nfor everybody to learn something from, the\nasking of better questions about oneself\nis really what leads to the understanding.\nSo, like, better forms of inquiry,\nto me, these better forms of\ninquiry, better questions are really\nthe cardiovascular exercise, the\nstrength training, the flexibility\ntraining, the mobility training,\ncoordination training of physical\nhealth just translate to mental health.\nPaul Conti: It's so interesting, right?\nBecause if you think about it,\nin the example I gave, both the\ntherapy part through the system.\nThe CBT has a place.\nAnd the medicine part also had a place.\nSo both of those things have their role.\nBut if we build the whole story of, like,\nthis is what this is, and this is how\nyou're going to be helped around those\nthings, we don't help that person at all.\nIn fact, we ultimately, if you\ntake on balance, you take all\ncomers, we end up doing harm.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, in some ways,\nif we stay with the analogy of physical\nhealth, it would be like the person\nwho wants to get in shape and then they\nget a, i'm not picking on peloton as\na brand, but just a stationary bike.\nAnd they pedal every morning and they\nlose weight, their blood pressure\ngoes down, they're doing better.\nBut then at some point, we know\nwith certainty that if you just do\nthe same form of exercise over and\nover again, sooner or later you're\ngoing to get overuse injuries.\nSo then there's like the lower\nback piece and another piece\nand you become out of balance.\nBut I guess this is stealing\nfrom the Lance Armstrong book.\nBut it's not about the bike, right?\nIt's not about the bike.\nIt's about the elevation of heart rate.\nIt's about whatever other healthy\nactivities go along with exercising\nfirst thing in the morning and all\nthe things that you're not doing as a\nconsequence of exercising in the morning.\nSo it seems to me that these better\nlines of inquiry as the path to better\nmental health, a better life, that sit\nunder these pillars of structure of self,\nfunction of self, are really the key.\nPaul Conti: But in this\nexample, the parallel that you\nmade is even more dramatic.\nIt wouldn't be the stationary bike, right?\nBecause a stationary bike is\nachieving a lot of ends, right.\nIt would be more like telling\nthe person, you should walk more\nbriskly when you're going upstairs.\nThat's a good idea, but that's\nnot going to make the change.\nSo the idea that some CBT, some medicine\nmakes sense, it's more like that.\nIt's not that walking more briskly up the\nstairs isn't a good thing, it's that we\ncan't build the story around your whole\nhealth is going to change based upon that.\nAnd then that's a problem.\nThen if the person thinks, just\nwalk more briskly up the stairs and\nyou'll be healthier, because when\nit doesn't work now they've failed.\nAnd this gets used a lot in mental health.\nThat person failed this\ntherapy, failed that medicine.\nI think it's so also ironic because\nthat's often what the person internalizes.\nWell, they failed because we set\nthem up 100% for failure, right?\nBecause we took things that have their\nrole, at least potentially have their\nrole, and we built the whole story around\nthem because that story is convenient for\nthe systems that are providing the care.\nIt's convenient for the healthcare\nsystems, it's convenient for the insurers.\nCBT packages very nicely.\nAnd you could see how if you start\nchanging thoughts and how they\nmake you feel like you can get some\nmovement on the surface, even if\nthere's no movement underneath.\nAnd again, I'm not saying CBT is bad,\nbut to see it as the whole answer\nguarantees failure in so many situations.\nSame thing with the medicine.\nIf you build the whole story\njust because it's convenient.\nAnd by and large, medicines\nare cheaper than people, right?\nSo you can prescribe\nmedicines very reflexively.\nPsychiatrists with 15 minutes with\na patient that they can't then\nsee back for a couple of months.\nLike, how does that go well?\nThe answer is it only goes well\nthe way a broken clock is right a\ncouple of times, twice a day, right?\nI mean, look, sometimes it goes well\nwhere it just somehow it works out.\nAnd that person can do a little bit of\ntherapy in 15 minutes and choose the right\nmedicines, but by and large, we do those\nthings because they're convenient for the\nsystems, even though that's why people\ndon't get better like we think they would.\nThat's why they stay in systems.\nThat's why they come in\nand out of emergency rooms.\nThat's why they're not able to\nstop the drugs that end up only\nbeing stopped when the person dies.\nThis happens all the time, and we\ndon't stop it because we're coming\nfrom a perspective that is so limited.\nThat's not saying, let's take a step back\nand look, can we really help someone?\nCan we really help that person understand?\nCan we help that person make change?\nWhich ultimately would be, of course,\nso much better for the person and\nso much better for society, but\nis also better if we just look at,\nbottom line, dollars and cents.\nBecause the short term view of\nit is cheaper today to have a\npsychiatrist at a 15 minutes\nappointment reflexively prescribe\na medicine that is cheaper today.\nIs that cheaper across time when that\nperson is utilizing more resources or\nthey're in and out of emergency rooms?\nIt's so short sighted, which fits with\nmany ways in how our society works, right.\nThat we want gratification and\nwe want gratification rapidly.\nThat's why a person would accept\nthat their problems could be\nchanged by medicine, right?\nWe're kind of conditioned that way.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, of course there's\nthe cost we don't see, which is that\nperson doesn't get the opportunity to\nexpress their generative drive, and the\nconsequence of that is incalculable.\nPaul Conti: Right?\nYes.\nAnd if we take a step back and we look\nat that, I think that what we will see is\nthat we have, it's not quite like painted\nourselves into a corner, but it's like the\nidea that if there's a beautiful tapestry\nthat's the size of the wall, that you\ncan see that only standing back from it.\nI mean, this goes back, I think,\na couple of thousand years,\nthis sort of thought and idea.\nBut if you come up too close to it, then\nyou can't see what it means anymore.\nAnd we're up so close to it\nthat we're thinking, well, okay,\nhow could one parameter change?\nAnd can this person get a 15 minutes\nvisit sooner rather than later?\nOr how about this\nmedicine instead of that?\nAnd then it's like our noses are right up\nagainst the tapestry and we don't see that\nwe're not doing right by individual people\na lot of the time, and we're not doing\nright by society, which then, if you stop\nand think about it, we're not doing right\nby us because any one of us could be in\nthat position, and many of us have been in\nthat position being on the other side of\nthings and really needing help and needing\nto understand so any of us can be there.\nSo if we're failing a lot of individual\npeople and we're failing the society, it\ndoesn't matter who we are listening to\nthis, ultimately we're failing ourselves.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd like to take\na brief break and acknowledge\nour sponsor, Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've spoken many times before on this\npodcast and elsewhere about the fact\nthat getting a quality night's sleep on a\nregular basis is the foundation of mental\nhealth, physical health and performance.\nWhen we're sleeping well,\neverything goes better.\nAnd when we are not sleeping well\nor enough, everything in terms of\nmental health, physical health and\nperformance gets far worse very quickly.\nOne of the key things to getting a\ngreat night's sleep is to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment.\nAnd that's because in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep, you\nneed your core body temperature to\ndrop by about one to three degrees.\nAnd in order to wake up feeling refreshed,\nyou need your core body temperature to\nincrease by about one to three degrees.\nThat all becomes very easy when using\nan Eight Sleep mattress cover because\nit allows you to program the temperature\nof your sleeping environment at the\nbeginning, middle and towards the\nend of your night when you wake up.\nI started sleeping on an Eight Sleep\nmattress cover over two years ago\nand it immediately and persistently\nimproved the quality and depth of\nmy sleep and as a consequence, I\nwake up feeling far more refreshed.\nI have enhanced mood, focus and\nalertness throughout the day.\nIf you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you\ncan go to eightsleep.com/huberman to\nsave up to $150 off their pod 3 cover.\nEight sleep currently ships\nin the USA, Canada, UK, select\ncountries in the EU and Australia.\nAgain, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.\nLets therefore talk about what does\nknow, and again, placing on the shelf\nthe fact that medications can help\nand CBT cognitive behavioral therapy\ncan help, but they are just but two\ncomponents of a much larger picture.\nThe map that we described briefly\nat the beginning of today's episode,\nand that is, by the way, available as\na downloadable PDF in the show note\ncaptions if people want to look at it\nvisually and that was described in a\nlot of detail in episode one, which I\nhope people will take the time to listen\nto because it's so rich with depth of\nunderstanding and I'm certain everyone\nwill learn a ton about themselves and\nothers simply by listening to your\nwords, I'm absolutely certain of that.\nThat map provides essentially\na description of the bins, the\ncupboards to look in to arrive at\nbetter answers and even the sorts\nof questions that one might ask.\nIf we could just talk about that in\nthe context of the example that you\ngave of this person who made this\nreally incredible choice to move\naway from this higher paying job.\nThey were overindulging in\ncertain maladaptive behaviors.\nAnd again, we will use this example.\nBut this example is but one of an\ninfinite number of examples that we could\nuse of a person who's in a struggle.\nThey're doing something that's\nnot working for them, and they're\nalso not doing things that they\nknow they ought to be doing.\nOkay, this is important for people\nto understand, because there are\ngoing to be people out there that\nare thinking, oh, like this poor\nguy, he's making tons of money.\nPoor him.\nBut he was experiencing deep\nmisery, lack of satisfaction.\nSo it could have been the reverse example.\nLike, the person isn't in a\njob that brings about enough\nwealth for them to thrive.\nRight.\nBecause there are financial\nrealities to life.\nPaul Conti: It's just one example , right.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: But it's a good one, I\nthink, because the person left the money.\nRight.\nSo it's like, well, what\nwould make you leave that?\nRight.\nWell, what would make you leave\nthat is if you're miserable in the\nsituation with that, and you're\nhappy in the situation without it.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nSo it's about leaving misery\nand finding happiness.\nSo if you'd be willing to share with us\na little bit of your mindset during those\nsessions, meaning the sorts of questions\nyou asked him about the structure of his\nself or to reveal the structure of his\nself and the function of his self that\nallowed the both of you to eventually\nset him down this far better course.\nWhat's better than moving away from\nfrustration and overindulgence and\nmaladaptive behavior to deep satisfaction,\npeace, contentment and delight, and\nto become a generative human being.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nSo we can look in each\nof those ten cabinets.\nRight?\nSo let's say we look in the\nunconscious mind cabinet.\nThere's not much there.\nWhen the person was growing up,\nit was very clear that having more\nmoney and having a job that impressed\npeople was an important thing.\nHe internalizes some of it, so\nsome of it's unconscious, but\nby and large, he's aware of it.\nAndrew Huberman: And then\nthat was revealed to you how?\nYou would ask him a question about,\ntell me about your upbringing.\nAnd he would say, yeah, money\nwas important to my family but I\nalways felt like we had enough.\nHe wasn't super wealthy,\nbut it had enough.\nWhen you say there wasn't a lot there, do\nyou mean that there was no kind of like,\nX marks the spot or blinking red light?\nLike, whoa, there's something really in\nhis unconscious mind that's in his way.\nDo I have that right?\nPaul Conti: Well, more\nbecause it was conscious.\nSo he was aware that it was\nvery much like beat into him.\nRight?\nLike, this is the only way to be okay\nis to have a prestigious job that makes\na lot of money but he's aware of it.\nIf he weren't aware of it, we\nhave to bring that to light.\nRight?\nBut he was aware.\nHe's like, look, it\nhas a big impact on me.\nIt makes it hard to step away.\nLike, I know I don't really care that much\nabout the money, but I also kind of do.\nAndrew Huberman: Sure, I always say money\ncan't buy happiness, but it certainly\ncan buffer certain stressors in life.\nSometimes you hear people who have\na lot of money saying, like, money\ncan't buy happiness because there\nare a lot of miserable rich people.\nBut it's very different to have two night\nnurses to take care of a baby than to be\nthe person who has to stay up all night\ntaking care of a kid, especially, or a\nsingle mother versus a mother that has\na partner who's willing to pitch in.\nYou just can't compare\nPaul Conti: That's absolutely true.\nIn this case, we're just looking at\nmoney as money as an endpoint, right?\nThe idea that no matter what, how\nsecure and safe is more money better?\nAnd he had an intrinsic overvalue of that.\nSo it made it harder to step away\nfrom it because he was overvaluing it.\nHe knew he was overvaluing\nit just in and of itself.\nNot even for what it gets you, right?\nBut for the psychological meaning of it.\nThen we look at his defensive structures.\nIf we look in that cupboard, you see\nthat they've really shifted, right?\nThey shifted from healthy places.\nNow they're sort of twisted and distorted.\nAnd he's doing a lot of denial, a lot\nof avoidance, a lot of rationalization.\nHe's enacting a lot of\naggression towards himself.\nAnd he's doing a lot of projecting.\nHe's harming himself with the alcohol.\nHe's punishing himself.\nSo his defensive structure,\nit can be healthy.\nWe know that because it\nwas healthier, right?\nBut then we see that it is so twisted.\nSo we learn a lot from that, right.\nA lot is conscious in this person,\nthe defensive structure, can be\nhealthy because it was healthy...\nAndrew Huberman:\nEventually it was healthy.\nPaul Conti: Well, it was healthy before.\nAndrew Huberman: I see.\nPaul Conti: It was healthy before.\nSo you know that it can be healthy again.\nHe has it in him to have healthy defenses.\nThey just started getting away from him\nas he felt less and less satisfied with\nhis job and more and more angry with\nhimself and more and more miserable.\nAndrew Huberman: This is a\nreally key point for me and\neveryone else to understand.\nThroughout the years of high school and\ncollege and friends and things of that\nsort, I would hear this like, \"I used to\nbe really good at fitness, or if I had\na dollar for every time someone said,\nyou should have seen me in high school\".\nLike, the person who lets themselves\ngo and arguably is very busy with\nprofessional duties and family\nduties, and you can understand why\ntheir time is more compressed than\nit was when they were in high school.\nBut nonetheless, you hear these\nsorts of things all the time.\nI used to have this sense of I could\ndo things or that things could work\nout, and then it's as if there was a\nprevious version of themselves that\nis completely atrophied and the new\nversion of themselves or the later\nversion of themselves rather just simply\ndoesn't have access to that anymore.\nPaul Conti: That's the impact of trauma.\nWhether it's big trauma or it's\na big event or it's multiple\nthings, like, oh, the world just\nisn't rewarding me, I'm trying.\nThe world's not rewarding me.\nI'm trying.\nThe world's not rewarding me.\nThen people become\ndispirited, demoralized.\nIt's the trauma of that that takes away\nthe sense of self, the sense of agency.\nLike, I thought I could do things before,\nnow I don't think I can do things, right.\nBut nothing has really changed in me.\nThat's a problem and it's a problem.\nThe vast majority of\ntimes it's born of trauma.\nAndrew Huberman: Does that necessarily\nmean early childhood trauma?\nOr I suppose it could\nbe later life trauma.\nI mean, one of the things that I like\nabout what you're saying so much is that\nyou, the psychiatrist, hears, I used to\nbe able to do something well or feel well.\nAnd that's like, it\nsounds like is a signal.\nIt's really a beacon of health that\nstill exists in the person, but\nthat they're out of touch with.\nI think for most people, when they think\nabout themselves or people who talk\nabout how they used to be functional\nin some domain, and they're no longer\nfunctional in that domain any longer.\nIt sounds as if things\nare fundamentally broken.\nIt's as if a piece of them\nthat was functioning drifted\nout of their body and left.\nBut I love the optimism, because\nI think so much of what we're\ninterested in covering today is not\njust what's not working and why,\nbut also what's working and why.\nAnd what used to work and why.\nAnd the idea that within these cupboards\nthere can be the discovery of problems.\nClearly, that's why one goes to the\ncupboards as we're defining it, but\nthat there are a lot of answers.\nThe ingredients for success\nalready exist within us.\nPaul Conti: Especially if we know\nwe've had that ability before, right?\nBecause we know that we had it before.\nSo think about in this man.\nHe felt that he couldn't make change.\nLike now he's stuck.\nI got a lot of things done.\nI was able to get myself into this school\nand achieve this and then get this job.\nHe could do all of those things.\nBut now he feels like he can't do\nanything to make himself happy.\nSo we know he could do that.\nHe had a strong sense of agency.\nHe does it now, right?\nAnd like people often do,\nthey feel a sense of loss.\nLike, naturally, I've had\nthis happen in myself.\nIt feels like something's cut out\nof you and there's something hollow.\nI had that thing, and now I don't.\nHence the I'm broken, I'm hopeless.\nThe things that we hear over\nand over and over again.\nSo think about the shift in this\nperson to what's actually going on,\nwhich isn't that hard to discern.\nWe just pay attention to it.\nSo then if we run up the structure of\nself, we say, okay, not a lot of it is\nrooted in the unconscious mind, right?\nThere are problems of overvaluing certain\nthings, but they're in the conscious mind.\nAndrew Huberman: He knows.\nLike in his household, over dinner,\nit was dad or mom being proud of some\ndollar amount that they had achieved.\nSo that narrative exists.\nAnd he's like, yeah, money was a\nbig deal in my family kind of thing.\nBy the way, I'm not\nspeaking about my family.\nRarely were their discussions about money.\nThere were discussions about\nother things, of course.\nBut in this hypothetical.Sorry.\nPaul Conti: He knows.\nHe overvalues it, right?\nHe knows that independent of what money\nbuys and what he needs and all that, he\njust puts too much importance in money.\nAnd he knows that.\nRight?\nSo, okay, they're conscious mind issues.\nHe's pretty aware of them, and\nthey're pretty kind of set in him.\nLike those are the\nissues, and they're there.\nOkay, we learned that.\nThen we go look at his\ndefensive structure.\nBoy, that's very, very\nhelpful to talk about.\nWow, you had a very healthy\ndefensive structure.\nWhat were you doing before?\nA lot of sublimation.\nRight?\nAndrew Huberman: Could\nyou explain sublimation?\nPaul Conti: Yeah.\nTake anxiety or tension or something\nnegative in the self, or that\ncould be negative, and you channel\nit towards something positive.\nHe channeled that energy towards learning.\nHe channeled some of the\naggressive drive into a sense\nof agency that got achievement.\nSo he looked and he said, right, that\nnetwork of defense mechanisms that\ncomes up out of the unconscious mind\nwas like looking pretty good, right.\nIt was pretty clear.\nLight was coming through it in\na way that wasn't distorted.\nAnd now we could look at, wow, things\nare pretty different now, right?\nAs he's saying, no, it's\nokay what do you mean?\nI spent 10 hours of my\nweekend utterly wasting time.\nAnd what's wrong with that.\nOr he's rationalizing even that\nhe likes to drink when he doesn't\nbecause he's so mad at himself.\nLike the defensive\nstructure now is twisted.\nSo we can say, okay, that's\na big observation, right?\nAnd then the character structure,\nwhen we look at that, we find a\nperson who's pretty good at figuring\nout and understanding things and\ncoming right up to the precipice of\nchange, but has a long history of\nthen difficulty making the change.\nI know it, and I'm on the verge of\nit, but I can't bring myself to do it.\nThat's in his character structure.\nAndrew Huberman: By the\nway, s uch a common thing.\nI mean, people that know\nbetter know they know better.\nSometimes you almost have to\nwonder whether or not it's like\na medication in the pocket.\nLike, they could take\nit if they wanted to.\nThat might even give them some comfort.\nBut they just don't do it.\nThey just don't engage in the\nproper actions to move their\nlife from one place to the next.\nPaul Conti: And if we look\nthen at the level of strivings,\nhe does know what he wants.\nHe wants a feeling of contentment.\nIt's really what he wanted was a\nfeeling of contentment, a feeling of\nlike, I'm taking good care of myself.\nI'm doing something that's of value.\nI'm enjoying doing it.\nHe wanted those things.\nAnd even when we talked more, he had\nideas of what jobs would do that in\nthe beginning, he said he had no ideas.\nWhat he really meant that he said to\nme, but was also saying to himself,\nis, I have no ideas of jobs that would\nmeet these requirements for me that\npay as much as the one I have, right?\nBut within him, which we got to\nwhere he knew that there were\njobs that would make him happy.\nHe just had to get over\nthat they were lower paying.\nSo think of what we learn about that.\nThere's nothing lost in this man.\nThere's nothing cut out of him.\nHe's not damaged, he's not hopeless.\nAnd now he can understand that.\nHe understands himself\nactually pretty well, right?\nAnd his conscious mind is\napprehending pretty well what's\ngoing on and where he wants to go.\nBut, boy, as he hasn't taken good\ncare of himself, the defensive\nstructure gets sort of warped.\nAnd then it makes it a lot\nharder to take care of yourself.\nIt starts making other problems in life.\nAnd he starts feeling lousy about himself.\nLike, maybe I can't do\nmuch of anything right.\nWhy?\nBecause work isn't going as well.\nBecause he's drinking too much\nand role performance goes down.\nSo we can see that.\nAnd then what's of most interest there\nis that there's a character structure\nthat can come right up to the precipice\nbut not pull the trigger, so to speak,\non what the thing the person wants to do.\nBecause now we start getting,\nokay, an understanding of\nwhat's actually going on, right?\nAnd then if we look at function of self,\nlet's look in those cabinets too, right?\nTo help him be more aware of.\nThere's an I here which he was\npretty well aware of, but not enough.\nLike, there's a person here\nI'm shepherding through 24\nhours in the day, right?\nLike, I am an I and I'm aware\nof what's going on inside of me.\nAnd it can make me happy or\nit can make me miserable.\nLet's be more aware of that.\nAndrew Huberman: How did\nhe go about doing that?\nBecause I find this first step within\naddressing the function of self\nawareness and really understanding\nthat there's an I, there's a me,\nand I'm moving myself through life.\nI find this to be so interesting and\non the one hand, kind of obvious.\nLike, okay, there's a\nme, like, tangible thing.\nYou look in the mirror, you see yourself.\nBut at the same time, it's a\nbit abstract, I think to me\nand to many people out there.\nHow does one go about building up a\nsense of self in a way that provides\npositive agency in the world?\nIs it to tell?\nWe hear all the time\nabout these affirmations.\nAnd I'm sure there are people\nwho look at themselves in the\nmirror and say, you are enough.\nAnd I'm not making fun of these people.\nRight?\nI actually have my own internal\nlist that I tell myself on waking\nevery morning, which has nothing\nto do with positive affirmation.\nIt's just actually defining the\ndifferent roles that I play.\nI don't know why this is useful to me,\nbut I find it incredibly useful to me.\nIt reminds me who I am.\nIt also reminds or reassures me\nthat I don't have any dementia yet.\nSo we'll see going\nforward, but hopefully not.\nBut yeah.\nLet's talk about this line of\ninquiry within the category of\nself awareness that people can do\nregardless of whatever challenges\nthey might be having or not having.\nWhat does that look like and what\ndo you think that accomplishes at\nthe level of self understanding\nand agency in the world?\nPaul Conti: So one way of looking\nat that is, and it's not the words\nI would use, but what's pervading a\nperson and sort of setting the stage?\nWhich you can discern by inquiry.\nFor example, in this case, the person.\nSo there's a person who would\nreally not think, this is okay.\nThis person taking a job at\n10% of the previous pay and\nthe job has less prestige.\nWho's a person who would be very unhappy\nabout that and very faulting of that.\nAnd talk to this person, my\npatient, through the lens of that,\nhe should feel shame for that.\nThat person's not alive.\nThe person is not alive.\nSo one way of looking at is\nwhat master are you serving.\nAnd a lot of the givens.\nThe automaticity in him was as if that\nperson was alive inside of him, really\ntelling him how this wasn't okay.\nHe was fighting that he wasn't aware that,\nhey, that's some other person's voice.\nHe's like, no, I'm very,\nvery conflicted about this.\nActually, he wasn't very\nconflicted about this.\nWhen he starts focusing on the\nI, what do I actually think?\nWhat do I actually think?\nI don't care if I make 90% less.\nLike, I don't care.\nMy needs are met.\nI put some money away.\nI want to be happy.\nI'm not conflicted.\nBut in order to get there,\nwe have to look at the I.\nHow much is the I at center stage?\nI don't mean in some way of paying\ntoo much attention to the self, but\nwe're all acting through the lens of\nthe I, no matter what we're choosing.\nSo to be aware of that and do\nI want to be impacted by the\nopinions of this other person?\nBecause I can let someone\nelse's opinions very much.\nI mean, we all do, right?\nVery much impact my thoughts.\nBut I want to kind of decide that, do\nI really value that person's opinions?\nI don't want them automatically inside my\nhead telling me how I feel about myself.\nAndrew Huberman: I can't tell you how many\npeople I know come to me in a place of\nstruggle, even though I'm not a clinician.\nAnd as I listen to what they're struggling\nwith, it's so clear that they know the\nbest answer and route forward, but that\nthey're dealing with some internal,\noppressive voice about whether or not\nthey are a good person or a bad person,\nwhether or not the choice they want to\nmake is really a good choice at all.\nSometimes those voices are the\nvoices of parents in these particular\nexamples, or the voices of peers.\nAnd so I think, if I understand correctly,\nwhat you're talking about is getting\nreally firmly rooted in who a person\nis for themselves and what they really\nvalue and what they really know to be\ntrue for themselves and really trying to\nnot necessarily quiet those voices, but\nsee those voices truly as other, even\nthough they come from within their head.\nIs that right?\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nTo stop and think, what\nvoices do I want inside?\nSo maybe I want the voice of a\nkind mentor who still held me to\naccount for a very high standard.\nIt's a good voice to have inside of me.\nAndrew Huberman: A few of those.\nPaul Conti: But what might not be\na good voice is like, say, a not\nso kind mentor for whom you could\nnever do anything good enough.\nThat's not so good.\nOr maybe you take part of that\nand you leave part of that.\nBut the earlier and more formative\nthe voices are, the more they're\nin our head automatically.\nLike, think about that man thought\nthat he was deeply conflicted.\nAbsolutely, 100%.\nAnd he was right.\nLike, his experience was\nto be deeply conflicted.\nBut when you go in and dig, if\nyou just dig and you get to like,\nokay, the I is going to assess\nthis, he's not conflicted at all.\nWhich is why then if you're coming up\nthe function of self ladder and you look\nat defense mechanisms in action, and\nwhat's on top of that salience right\nnow is when it creates an immediacy.\nSo defense mechanisms in action\nsort of inform the process\nand say, hey, the defenses are\nshifting to denial, acting out.\nAnd that's what sort of gives us\na time horizon, like this thing.\nThis is not going to be okay.\nThat if he kept down this path, what\nwas very clearly going to happen.\nYou don't have to roll the tape\nforward that much to see that\nhe's going to lose his job.\nHe's going to feel very ashamed of that.\nLike a bunch of negative\nthings are going to happen.\nSo it helps the person apprehend\nthat there's something going on here.\nI'm changing, right.\nBecause in some way I'm thinking now\nthat it's okay that I'm wasting 10\nhours on something that I could really\nenjoy if I spent 90 minutes on it.\nWhoa, I'm kind of losing a\nlittle bit perspective there.\nSo it adds a sense like\nit frames the situation.\nAnd the salience of it.\nAndrew Huberman: Could you elaborate\na little bit on this defense\nmechanism in action of acting out?\nI think we covered in episode\none, and I'm sure we'll come up\nseveral times more during today's\ndiscussion about things like denial,\nprojection, displacement, et cetera.\nThose defense mechanisms seem to\nhave their own intrinsic definition.\nBut acting out is something that we\nhear more and more about these days.\nLike, they're acting out.\nWhat is acting out?\nIs it acting out of some conflict?\nIs it trying to demolish a struggle\nby going and doing something else?\nPaul Conti: We can think of it as, by\nand large, an unhealthy manifestation\nof a lot of aggression, which could\nbe a very high aggressive drive or an\naggressive drive that's not too high,\nbut is then furthered, its power is\nfurthered by a negative situation.\nSay, like this one.\nBecause the acting out, what\nwas going on here inside of this\nperson is he was very, very mad.\nAnd this isn't a person who expressed\na lot of anger or had outlets for.\nHe wasn't going and running 10\nmiles or this was all inside of him.\nHe wasn't getting it out\nin one way or another.\nSo what he starts doing is he\nstarts acting out the anger.\nNow, he's angry at the world around\nhim because he's unhappy in it, and\nit's not giving him more choices.\nNow, of course, this is about\nhim and not the world around him.\nBut he's feeling an anger towards\nthe world that won't cooperate.\nRight.\nAnd he's angry towards himself.\nBecause he can't make himself happy.\nLook at all of this.\nLook at all that he did, and\nlook how miserable he is.\nSo a way of acting out\nthen is the drinking.\nBecause the drinking is to\nhell with the world, right?\nYou think I shouldn't be drinking at\nnight and coming to work hungover?\nI'll do it anyway, right?\nTo hell with the world.\nIt's a way of snubbing\nhis nose at the world.\nHe's also snubbing his nose at him, right?\nTo hell with me, right?\nThe guy who now doesn't come across\nthe way he did before, because\nI'm showing up at work, not in the\nresponsible way I showed up before, but\nin a way that's a little disheveled.\nFunction is lower.\nTo hell with me.\nIt's a form of self denigration.\nLike, let people think worse of me.\nWhy?\nBecause I'm so mad at myself that\nI think it's justified, right?\nAnd then there's also the inviting\nof, hey, if I really have an\naddiction problem here, I lose my job.\nIt's like, fine, I\ndeserve that too, right?\nThere's an acting out against the self\nthat if the person doesn't stop and look\nat that, that can become true, right?\nBecause that person didn't really wasn't\nbuilt to say to hell with the world and\nwith me, or to not even understand that,\nwhat's the hell with the world mean?\nIt also means to hell with me.\nAnd it's not good for the or me.\nBut he was able to understand\nthat because we would look at,\nlike, wow, what shifted in you?\nThis is a person who did a lot of\nsublimation before, who now all\nof that's going into acting out.\nSo they're not taking negative energy\nand doing something good with it.\nThey're taking negative energy and\ndoing things that are bad with it.\nWhy?\nBecause there's too much.\nThere's a lot of negative energy.\nIt's overwhelming everything else.\nAnd then it's going down these\npathways where the unhealthy\ndefenses are always beckoning us.\nSend the energy down here.\nIt's easier to avoid than it is to\nface something and figure it out.\nIt's easier to just act out than it\nis to hold what's inside of us and\nthen think about why it's there.\nSo the unhealthy defenses\nare beckoning us.\nAnd for him to see you have had\na healthy defensive structure,\nlike, you can be healthy again.\nYou're not broken, right?\nBut to also see the way these defenses\nare going is bringing real risk to\nyour ability to even be happier.\nYou get further down the shame and\nloss path, it can be hard, sometimes\nimpossible for the person to get back.\nSo it sets the stage.\nLike, this is very, very important,\nwhat these defenses are, how they're\nbeing enacted, and for him to be\nable to see that, like, oh, this\ncould be healthy, but it's not now.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nThese slow, degrading forms of acting\nout and self sabotage and sabotage of\nothers, I think, are the particularly\ndangerous ones because they're slow.\nAnd sometimes the change\nis imperceptibly slow.\nAnd then one day somebody arrives\nat a place where, as you said, they\nunfortunately can't get back, or it\nrequires going into residential treatment\nor things that really big departures\nin order to get back into life.\nAnd I would never wish for\nsomebody to choose to act out\nby driving off a cliff instead.\nBut there are other forms of acting\nout that immediately wake people up.\nBut it seems like people\ndon't often select those.\nThey select these more subtle forms\nof acting out where they don't get\ncaught or no one's calling them out on\nit because plenty of people have five\nor six drinks at happy hour, right?\nAs opposed to 50, right?\nSo it's slow self sabotage as opposed\nto immediate self destruction.\nAnd again, we're talking about alcohol,\nbut we talk about food, video games,\nsocial media, arguing with spouse.\nI mean, all of these kinds of things that\nbuild up over time to eventually deliver\npeople to a place of real problems.\nI'm curious, for this particular\nindividual you worked with, sounds\nlike that's not what happened.\nThey started this process of self\ninquiry around self awareness.\nAnd did you see that the salience\nthat is what they paid attention to\ninternally and externally immediately\nshifted and the defense mechanism\nof acting out immediately dissolved.\nI mean, what was the kind\nof contour and time course.\nPaul Conti: There was less.\nIf we're looking in the cabinets, there's\na lot in the defence mechanisms in action\ncabinet, there's not as much in the\nsalience cabinet because this is the major\nthing on his mind right above all else.\nAnd he was having intrusive thoughts\nabout it and his self talk was about it.\nBut we kind of already knew that, just\nlike we knew it was in the conscious mind.\nSo if you think, where's the money at?\nIt's not as much in that realm\nbecause he's aware of it.\nIf he thought, oh, this\nisn't bothering me very much.\nAnd then he said, well, all his internal\ndialogue is about it, right then,\nokay, there's a lot to achieve there.\nBut just as he brought a lot that\nwas unconscious into the conscious\nmind, was aware of it, it was salient.\nThere's less to do there because\nthe things to understand and change\nare not residing so much there.\nAndrew Huberman: For people that are, no\ndoubt everyone is thinking about their\nown internal processes and where they\ncould ask better questions and arrive at\nbetter answers to help themselves along.\nPerhaps you could elaborate a\nlittle bit more on this salience\ncupboard under function of self.\nTo me, salience is what's most apparent.\nAs you talked about yesterday and\nagain today, there's this internal\nnarrative, like what's on my mind\noften or what kind of jumps to mind.\nI've started doing this recently based\non our discussions here, and I've noticed\nthat under different states of arousal.\nAnd here I'm talking specifically about\nsleepiness versus alertness type arousal\nwhen I wake up in the morning or when\nI'm tired in the evening, where my mind\nis at, where it defaults to and what I'm\npaying attention to throughout the day\nis that just asking myself to notice,\nand I've certainly noticed some patterns.\nFor instance, I've noticed that anytime my\noverall state is elevated, more alertness,\nor in the middle of exercise, my mind\ngoes to some not so pleasant thoughts.\nAnd it's interesting to me,\nit's like, wow, this is strongly\ncorrelated with states of\ninternal arousal that are healthy.\nExercise within a limited frame\nor exercise in general, if done\nin a healthy way, is healthy.\nAnd when I'm sleepy, those\nthoughts never come about.\nWhen I wake up in the morning,\ncertain thoughts tend to leap to mind.\nOther thoughts know.\nSo sort of categorization of\ndifferent types of thoughts\ndepending on my internal state.\nIs that the sort of line of inquiry that\nyou're suggesting or describing here?\nPaul Conti: Yeah, I think it's quite\nhalf the picture, because half the\npicture would be what's going on in your\nmind when your mind is sort of at rest.\nWhat then starts playing\nitself right in your mind.\nThe other side of it is what\ncomes to the fore when there's a\nlot of competition for attention.\nSo I'm making this up, but the idea\nthat if he stubbed his toe really badly,\nhe'd still be thinking about this.\nBecause it's so much power.\nNow, again, maybe if, God forbid, he has a\nbadly broken bone, there's a lot of pain,\nlike he's going to think of that first.\nBut it takes a lot of other stimulus\nto be more salient than this.\nSo you can look at what's coming\nin your mind when your mind is\nsort of free and open, that's\nvery, very important and relevant.\nAnd then what's winning out when\nthere's maybe a high arousal state and\na lot of competition for attention.\nAndrew Huberman: That's very helpful.\nAgain, I think that along with this self\nawareness piece, the asking of oneself\nwhat is happening in my mind when I'm\nin different states or throughout the\nday, and as you're describing now,\nalso including when there are other\nthings available to think about.\nDoes that include how often I'm\ndistracted by a particular thought?\nLike how many times throughout the\nday my mind goes from the conversation\nI might be in to something else?\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nDoes it hijack your attention?\nIs one way of putting that.\nAndrew Huberman: A lot of people mention\nto me challenges with intrusive thoughts.\nWhat can be done about\nthose intrusive thoughts?\nOr is it simply a matter of paying\nattention to the fact that they're\nthere and then thinking about\nthe origins of those thoughts?\nPaul Conti: Right.\nAbsolutely.\nOne example, you could have intrusive\nthoughts because there's trauma in\nyour background, maybe very clear\ntrauma that you're not facing and\naddressing, and then you have intrusive\nthoughts that say, I'm not safe.\nOkay, go look for what's\nstill in the unconscious mind.\nOr when it comes out a little bit, you\npush back into the unconscious mind.\nThat's a very different scenario\nthan, like, in this case.\nThis man was having intrusive thoughts\nabout his job situation, his overall\nsituation, and it made sense that\nhe was having those intrusive.\nThey were markers of the acuity of it, of,\nlike, you have to do something about this\nor something very bad is going to happen.\nSo the intrusive thoughts there.\nAnd this made sense, right.\nThis is not going well, and your\nmind is sort of forcing you to\npay attention to this because time\nreally kind of is of the essence.\nYou're at real risk now.\nSo intrusive thoughts can be anything\nfrom, as they often are, they can be\nmarkers of something that is traumatic,\nsomething that's underneath the surface,\nsomething that is really bothering us,\nthat we've shoved down, that's making\nguilt, shame, distress, vulnerability.\nThat's very often the case.\nBut sometimes intrusive thoughts\nare a marker of like, oh, right.\nThat's the thing to pay attention to.\nAndrew Huberman: And once we identify the\nintrusive thought, how do we eradicate it?\nI mean, how do we work with it?\nTalking about trauma now, of course, it\nmight map back to a childhood experience,\nsome internal narrative, but is there\nsome roadmap for moving intrusive thoughts\nfrom a place of intrusive and disturbing\nto simply there and kind of, meh.\nI mean, it'd be wonderful to hit\na delete switch, but obviously,\nwe don't work like that.\nPaul Conti: Well, let's take a look,\nif we could, at this example, right,\nwhich is a little bit different if we\nrun through this example of the person\nin the job, because then we should talk\nabout trauma driven intrusive thoughts,\nwhich is, I think, in many ways, the\nbiggest topic about intrusive thoughts.\nBut think of this person here.\nIf we go up from salience,\nwe look at behaviors, right?\nAnd behavior actually now is\nvery, very important, right.\nThis person is drinking.\nThey're still going to\nthat job they don't want.\nThey haven't gone and interviewed\nfor the jobs they want.\nSo we start looking at the behaviors\nthat are making problems, the changes in\nbehaviors that could make things better.\nAnd then on top of that,\nwe arrive at strivings.\nAnd I think when I was talking about\nstructure of self, I think at least one\ntime I misspoke and said striving instead\nof self at the top of these pyramids, self\nand striving have a lot of overlap, right.\nBecause if you're growing a healthy self\nout of the sort of top of the structure\nof self pyramid, then that self is\ngoing to be aware of strivings and it's\ngoing to be better able to enact them.\nSo his sense of self was shaken\nhere, but he was aware of the\nstrivings for a better life.\nSo now let's see the roadmap.\nIt's interesting, right?\nBecause the roadmap is his roadmap.\nIf we look in those ten cupboards,\nwe come up with a roadmap, and the\nroadmap doesn't have us spending very\nmuch time in unconscious land, right.\nBecause he doesn't really need that.\nIf we look at what makes the\ndifference for him, what did we do?\nWe really cultivated the self awareness,\nthe I that is making decisions for him.\nWe looked at how his defensive structure\nhad changed and the things he didn't\nwant to be there now and the good\nthings that were there before, and\nhow could he get back some of that?\nHow could he trend back towards\nwhat was working before?\nSo we start to really look at\nthat and then we go from there\nreally to changing behaviors.\nLike it requires a behavioral\nchange, which is not to walk up to\nthe precipice of doing this each\nday, but to actually do it, right.\nBecause it was very clear all the\nvectors, so to speak, inside of\nhim were pointing towards doing it.\nAnd that that was consistent with\nthe self being healthier, that garden\ngrowing on top of the structure and\nthe strivings then being realized.\nSo for him, that was the roadmap and\nthe salience, it wasn't really part\nof it, because the intrusiveness, the\nsalience bias inside of him made sense.\nAnd then, of course, it went away\nonce he made the decisions, right.\nBecause the intrusive thoughts of,\nlike, you have to figure this out.\nYou have to figure this out.\nWeren't there anymore, along\nwith the intrusive thoughts of,\nyou'll never figure this out.\nIt goes away because he made the\nchange, but he made the change\nbecause we looked at self awareness\nand we strengthened self awareness.\nWe looked at defense mechanisms, how\nthey could be versus how they are.\nWe looked at the behavioral\nchange, which was really necessary.\nAnd then also referencing a character\nstructure that has difficulty.\nComing across the precipice.\nSo we say, okay, that's a\nbaseline characteristic of him.\nWe kind of understand that.\nBut how do we help him\nchange the behaviors anyway?\nWhen he does that, the self is in\na better, happier, healthier place.\nThe strivings are realized.\nThis person stops drinking\nin the way they were.\nThey start doing the enjoyment\naspects of their life.\nThey start doing them within\nreasonable bounds again, they're\ntaking care of themselves.\nPerson's smiling and now think the\ngenerative drive is much more fulfilled.\nWhat comes on top of those pillars, right.\nIs that person has a sense of humility.\nEnough humility to say, I'm\ngoing to walk away from this job.\nIt's okay that people in the\njob will think I'm crazy.\nHow could you leave that?\nAnd it triggers something\nin me in some way.\nBut it's okay.\nI'm not out there for that.\nI'm not out there for the big\nthing that everybody is guiding.\nI can have the humility to go\nto the job that I know makes a\ndifference and feels good to me.\nHe's empowered to make change.\nHe's moving away from the disempowerment\nof the alcohol and the avoidance.\nSo there's empowerment and humility\nand absolutely, if you talk to that\nperson on the other side of it, like\nshortly as he was enacting it, right.\nGetting just to the other side of\nit, there was so much empowerment\nand so much humility, which were\nthen brought to bear through a sense\nof agency that made the changes.\nThat changed the job, that stopped\ndrinking, that dealt with the people\nwho thought negatively of it through a\nsense of gratitude of, it's not awful\nthat I'm going to go make less money.\nA lot of people said that to him.\nLike, how could you do it?\nIt was so terrible.\nIt's not terrible.\nI'm grateful.\nYou know what I'm going to do?\nI'm going to go make an amount of money.\nThat's all that I need.\nSo it was like, that's what\nhelps a person do that thing.\nAnd that's actually true.\nThat's what mattered to him.\nSo an activated, an active, a verb,\nsense of agency and gratitude, then\nleads him to the place where there\nwas at peace, contentment, delight.\nHe was delighting in the job\nthat he chose, and his generative\ndrive was in accord with it.\nThen eventually, we stopped at\nsome point, working together.\nHe didn't need me anymore.\nHe could always come back,\nbut we didn't need me anymore.\nThen you look at.\nHow are those last sessions?\nA lot of the last sessions were\nhim in an excited way, telling\nme what he was doing, right.\nLike, oh, and then we\ndid this, and I did this.\nI figured this out.\nHe was so happy about it.\nAnd you can see that man's generative\ndrive, which naturally is quite high\nin him, but was being squelched.\nThat brings him out of balance.\nNow, the generative drive was in quite a\ngood place, and he had enough aggression\nor assertion to go and do that job and\nto do that well, and even enough to\ncounter anybody who would still kind of\nrise up and say, that wasn't a good idea.\nHe could counter all that.\nHe was getting pleasure from it.\nHe didn't need to seek pleasure.\nBy what?\nNot even pleasure?\nBecause alcohol was pleasurable?\nNo, pleasure.\nBecause harming himself and\nsaying, to hell with you, to the\nworld, and to him was pleasurable.\nHe's not getting pleasure that way.\nHe's getting pleasure in healthier ways,\ntaking care of himself, doing the job\nhe loves, doing his leisure activities.\nLike, the man comes into\nbalance, and then life is good.\nAnd when you say, yeah, okay, come back\nin a couple of months, comes back in a\ncouple of months, maybe in six months.\nComes back one more time,\nI don't see him again.\nThat's great.\nHe totally doesn't need me again.\nAnd I atrophied from his life.\nGreat.\nThat's the success state of it.\nAndrew Huberman: He eventually\narrived at being truly wealthy with\nall the components of mental health\nand peace, contentment, delight.\nAs you describe his story, which is\na remarkable one, it occurs to me\nthat the narratives that we hear as\nchildren end up being so powerful.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: And I'm sure there are\npeople out there that receive such direct\nmessages from their mother and or father.\nLike, you have to do this.\nYou cannot do that.\nBut often we get messages through\nobserving and overhearing.\nRight.\nThe way that our mother talks about\nour father when he's out of the room.\nThe way that our father talks about\nour mother when she's out of the room.\nAnd some of this could be nonverbal,\nlike a rolling of the eyes or somebody\nsaying, yes, yes, agreeing, and\nthen they walk out and they just.\nAnd kind of blowing them off.\nI mean, kids are, we are all so aware\nand integrating all of that all the time.\nAnd I do think those messages get\nwoven into us at a very deep level.\nPaul Conti: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: And then, of course,\nthere are the conscious narratives\nthat we build up as we go through\nin particular, I think, elementary\nand middle school and high school.\nI mean, I can still remember a\nnegative comment somebody made about\na jacket that I was wearing in,\nlike, the third or the fourth grade.\nI forget everything else\nthat happened that year.\nRemember that?\nYeah.\nAnd I'm not insecure about\nthe clothing that I pick.\nI mean, obviously it's a\nblack button down shirt.\nI've had similar shirts\nsince the first grade.\nJust kidding.\nBut the fact that that's embedded\nin my memory systems is, like,\njust speaks to the salience of\nnegative, of insults basically.\nIt was an insult.\nAnd I'm sure I've insulted plenty\nof kids coming up as a teenager\nand back and forth, but these\nnarratives get so deeply embedded.\nAnd the idea that one could pick a\ndifferent path of vocation or, like, you\nmiss the opportunity to be truly happy at\na deep level based on these narratives.\nI mean, on the one hand, it's obvious.\nOn the other hand, you just go\nlike, whoa, this is not good.\nThis is a flaw in the design.\nAnd yet you're giving us a roadmap to\nunderstanding and to overcoming it.\nPaul Conti: Right?\nLet's say we take your\nexamples and we really look.\nThey're great examples and\nwe look at them, right?\nThe person making fun of\nthe coat in third grade.\nWe're assuming it hasn't harmed you, it\nhasn't changed the course of your life.\nWhat does it tell us?\nIt shows that negative\nstimuli are very salient.\nI'm sure you got a lot of compliments\nin third grade too, right?\nBut it's the negative that stands\nout, which just shows that there's a\nsalience bias in us towards the negative.\nAnd that's probably about\nsurvival and threat sensing.\nLike, in some ways it makes sense\naround human survival, but it doesn't\nmake sense around human trauma.\nSo you had given the example of what\ngets communicated to the child when,\nsay, mother says something negative about\nfather when father's out of the room.\nFather says something negative about\nmother when mother's out of the room.\nJust to give an example.\nSo, children, because the\ncomplex cognitive mechanisms\nhaven't been formed yet, right?\nThen the natural way that the brain\nfunctions is in a self referential way.\nSo the child generally doesn't\nhave the capacity to say, like, oh,\nmom and Dad aren't really getting\nalong well in this certain way.\nSo when Dad's not here, mom vents a little\nbit about something about him by saying.\nThe child isn't thinking\nabout that, right?\nThen what the child will often\ninternalize is, okay, there's\nme and there's mom and dad.\nAnd mom says dad is bad,\nand dad says mom is bad.\nAnd I must be bad too, right?\nBecause in general, if your\nparents are bad, then the\nchild takes that on themselves.\nNow, again, I'm giving a simple example,\nbut I'm very much extrapolating it.\nI mean, imagine if that were very,\nvery aggressive where the mother,\nwhen this happens, just tells\nthe child how awful the father\nis and the father does the same.\nSomeone's not going to come out the other\nside of that being like, you know what?\nMaybe they're both awful, but I'm not.\nThat's not how that goes.\nSo the lessons, the traumatic lessons\nof childhood get internalized.\nAnd they don't even always\nhave a solution state.\nSo you think about the man who knew,\nlike, okay, you have to go get this job.\nAnd all those things he internalized.\nYou might say, well, I mean,\nhe got to a good place for him.\nSo for better or for worse, at\nleast there was a place to go.\nTo go work hard, go succeed.\nGo check this box you've been\ntold you're supposed to check, but\noftentimes there is no solution state.\nSo how many children, I mean, it's\nterrible that this is such a high\npercentage of the work adult practitioners\ndo is helping people who, as children\nwere told one way or another that\nthey were worthless, incapable, bad.\nThat gets put into the child.\nUnfortunately, far, far...\nI mean, one time on the\nplanet is too frequent, let\nalone how often this happens.\nAndrew Huberman: That example\nmakes really good sense.\nAnd this is a question.\nCould we add to that the example\nwhereby the child overhears examples\nof what say, men should be like or\nwomen should be like these things.\nIt's not so much like, you did wrong\nAndrew or you did wrong Paul, or\ntelling the daughter you screwed up.\nBut it's more, again, narratives that\nwe overhear, or even a parent showing\ndelight or excitement about a certain\nphenotype in the world, like, oh, wow,\nlook at that person, or look at them.\nIsn't she beautiful, right?\nThat the young child thinks like,\nokay, well, then that's the epitome of\nbeauty through the lens of the parent.\nOr, gosh, like this person.\nThen that child internalizes\nthat this is the epitome of\ndisgust with another human being.\nAnd I think children are so savvy without\nrealizing it, it's like, okay, well,\nthen I guess you move toward that and you\naspire to that and you deflect from that.\nAnd you can see how these\ntrajectories can be set very early on.\nI mean, these are the four lane\nhighways that we were talking about\nin episode one, where just routes of\nneural processing that can bring us\nto choices in life and places in life\nthat oftentimes you go like, I don't\nwant to go down this path anymore.\nThe exploration of early narratives,\nboth direct and indirect, first person\nand third person, seem so critical.\nHow does one go about that?\nI mean, clearly, with a trained\nclinician like you, you would\nguide somebody through the process.\nBut if somebody were to try and\ndo this in some sort of structured\nway for themselves, what do\nthose lines of inquiry look like?\nBecause we have vast number of experiences\nfrom childhood, but some messages are\ngoing to be more salient than others.\nPaul Conti: Sure.\nYeah.\nThe idea that reflective self scrutiny can\nhelp us, I think, is just a great idea.\nIt's a great concept.\nAnd we do a lot of different things\nsort of inside, and we're guided\nto do a lot of things inside.\nBut this, I think, should overshadow many,\nif not most of all those other things\nof what's really going on inside of me.\nBecause if you think about\nit, a lot of people will come\nthrough that and they'll learn.\nSo the person is told like, this is what\nbeautiful is, this is what successful\nis, this is what good enough looks like.\nAnd that person may, through all sorts\nof experiences, maybe other people in\ntheir lives who are more balanced, be\nable to arrive on the other side of\nthat even still sometimes going through\nthe midst of it, depending upon age\nand situation, and know, like, okay, my\nfather and mother thinks like, this is\nwhat beauty is, this is what success is.\nBut it's one set of opinions,\nand there's not a set of opinions\nthat are going to define me.\nSometimes people get to that place,\nbut a lot of times they don't.\nAnd they carry that lesson forward\nand they're not aware of it, right?\nSo they think that they're very\nunattractive, even though other people\nare giving them different signals.\nThey think that they're very\ndumb, even though other people\nare giving them different signals.\nAnd their own grades and their own success\nmay be giving them different signals.\nBut they're not putting\nthe two things together.\nAnd that's going to generate tension.\nThat might be why that person doesn't\nfollow up on potential relationships.\nThey just don't think they're\ngood enough and the person's\neventually going to reject them\nbecause of what they look like.\nThey're taking that with them\nin this example from childhood.\nOr they're not satisfied with the job\nthat in other ways is really great.\nThey enjoy the work.\nThey enjoy everything,\nbut doesn't pay enough.\nWhy?\nBecause they have some false idea\ninside of what it's supposed to pay.\nBecause it's what the parent\nsaid by self scrutiny.\nWhat are the givens?\nI always think it goes\nback to the math minor.\nIf you can't solve the problem,\ngo back and look at the givens.\nWhat are you taking for granted?\nLike, oh, I know that every time\nI see an X, that X equals four.\nReally?\nMaybe you wrote down four somehow\nbecause you were thinking of four at\nthe time and X actually is a three.\nRight.\nJust go back and look at what\nyou're taking for granted.\nAnd a lot of times this is what we're\ndoing in the therapy process, and then\nthat's when the person can realize.\nSo I'm simplifying, but for the\nperson to realize, like, oh, there's\na voice in my head, so to speak.\nIt's a natural voice.\nThat is the voice of this person who\nmay not even be around anymore, whose\nopinion doesn't mean to me what it\ndid before, but that voice is saying,\nyou're unattractive, you're not making\nenough money, you're not good enough.\nAnd you know what?\nI don't believe that\nthey can identify that.\nAnd then it doesn't happen all at once.\nBut you can get it out of you.\nGenerally, you don't get it out of you\nunless you realize that it's there.\nAndrew Huberman: What is the\nprocess of getting it out?\nBecause I think that we all have the\ncapacity to remember certain things and to\narrive at a place where we can understand.\nOkay, I'm taking for granted\nthe fact that there's a voice\nin my head that says blank.\nActually, I have a brief anecdote\nto say about this, and this\nisn't I have a friend thing.\nI literally have a female friend\nwho the other day called me\nlaughing and crying because she was\nbeing evicted from her apartment.\nAnd she told her mother\nabout this over the phone.\nAnd her mother's response was,\nwell, at least you're thin.\nPaul Conti: Wow.\nAndrew Huberman: And she was laughing\nand crying about it because it reflected\nso much of her childhood that no other\naccomplishment of having a job, having\nan apartment, et cetera, mattered.\nIt was about one thing.\nIt was about a certain form of\naesthetic beauty that I'm not even\nsure she subscribes to, even though\nshe happens to be thin, right?\nSo the fact that her mother would\nlift that from the conversation,\nthere's such a deprivation of so\nmany things in that interaction.\nBut it really wasn't\nabout that interaction.\nShe was calling me because it was really\nabout her entire childhood, right.\nAnd obviously, I'm not\nequipped to solve the problem.\nAnd it wasn't a request for\nmoney or anything of that sort.\nIt was almost like the hilarity and the\nsadness of the whole picture, right?\nBut again, it speaks to these\nnarratives that we internalize\nand that sometimes show up in very\nglaring ways in the real world.\nIt's like to hear that, I\nthink, was shocking to her.\nI think she needed to\ntell me to, is this real?\nBut then it was clear that\nthat message had existed in her\nhead for a long time anyway.\nPaul Conti: That could be very\npivotal if she realizes that, right?\nAnd even the power of the humor of\nit is like, this is absurd, right.\nThat can be very powerful in creating\nchange, because if there's some vestige\nof that inside of her where she still\nbelieves, like, oh, I'm not good enough\nbecause I achieved A, B and C, but I\ndon't look like X or whatever, it can\nvery much help because there's a lot of\npower behind realizing that absurdity\nof, like, oh, my, that's bizarre.\nBut wait, is any of that inside of me?\nAm I carrying some of that with me?\nI mean, there's an incentive for\nself scrutiny through what you're\ndescribing, because what's the ideal\namount of that to still be in her?\nZero.\nAndrew Huberman: So as one comes to\nrealize, the messages they've heard,\nor perhaps, like, in this case,\nthat they're still hearing, is the\nprocess of overcoming those messages\nand really arriving at the self.\nIt sounds to me like it's a two part\nprocess, at least two part process.\nIt's to look in the bin\nof what are the givens?\nWhat am I taking for granted\nabout the internal narratives and\nthinking about their origins in\nchildhood or elsewhere, but then also\ncultivating the self awareness piece\nthat's under the function of self.\nLike, wait, what's really true\nfor me at the level of me?\nAnd this is really, I think, about\nseparating out the voices in one's\nhead, these internalized narratives from\nthe person that we really truly are.\nPaul Conti: Because the idea is\nthat those two pillars encompass\neverything we need to look at.\nThose ten cupboards encompass everything.\nSo it's all that.\nThe person who's going and looking\nat the givens, they're trying to\nunderstand what might be in my\nunconscious mind that I'm not aware of.\nAnd, wow.\nThe last time I got this big award\nat work, I had this reflexive thought\nof like, but you're not thin enough.\nWow.\nWhoa.\nRight?\nThere could be a process, like,\nthat's going on inside of me.\nI don't want that going on inside of me.\nSo the process of trying what is\nunconscious in us that may be causing\nus harm, which is often where,\nthat's where the trauma goes, right.\nIt's where the childhood trauma\nseats itself, which brings us back\naround to the intrusive thoughts.\nIntrusive, negative thoughts.\nA negative self dialogue usually\ndoes not mean what it meant to the\nman who need to change jobs, right.\nBecause they were there for a good reason.\nThen he needed to make change more often.\nThe vestiges, the hangover, the\nlingering badness of some prior trauma.\nSo oftentimes when you think, we\ntalked a little bit yesterday about\nthe person who was driving in the\ncar and just telling themselves over\nand over that they're a loser, right?\nAnd then they can't achieve\nthe things that they achieved\nwhen they stopped doing that.\nI'm simplifying a little,\nbut that's the basics of it.\nBecause the intrusive thoughts, the\nself narrative, all the negativity in\nus is often coming from places that\nare in the unconscious mind, right?\nNot always.\nBut this idea that I don't think\nI'm good enough, I'm saying it to\nmyself over and over again, like,\nwow, let's go back and look at why.\nBecause the answer to that,\nagain, lies in a different place.\nThere's just a different roadmap, right?\nThe man who needed to change jobs\nhad a roadmap that spent a little\nbit of time in the I, self awareness.\nAnd then it went through self defense\nmechanisms in action land, and it\nspent a lot of time with behavior,\nand then it got up to the strivings.\nThat's his roadmap.\nWhereas for someone who's laboring under\nthe intrusive thoughts, the negative self\ntalk, the automaticity, the givens of\nchildhood trauma then needs to go to a\ndifferent place where now we're spending\ntime in the unconscious mind thinking\nabout what's there, figuring out what's\nthere, bringing things to consciousness.\nThat person, say, realizing\nmaybe your friend, you had this\nrealization of, like, oh, my goodness.\nWe say, wow, did that bring something\nto the conscious mind in her.\nIf so, great, let's look at that and\nlet's look a lot at it and let's look.\nAre there other things there too?\nAre there other givens?\nLet's bring them to conscious, to\nconsciousness so that we can talk about\nthem, we can identify them, and then\nlook at how does that relate to defense\nmechanisms and character structure?\nAnd now what are we doing?\nA process of interested inquiry\nlike this is really interesting.\nI mean, it should be interesting\nto the person doing it.\nIt's them, right?\nAnd it should be interesting to the\nperson doing it with them, right?\nBecause if you're a therapist\nand it's not interesting to you,\nyou need another job, right?\nOr you're talking to a friend.\nLike if it's a friend is\ngoing to be interested.\nSo there's an interested, honest,\nopen inquiry with the idea of holiday\n.\n Let's learn things so that we\ncan make change for the better.\nAnd even though, as we talked about\nyesterday, the intrusive thoughts and\nthe self dialogue that's gone on over\nand over and over again, it doesn't go\naway easily, but that doesn't mean it\ndoesn't atrophy over time and go away.\nOr that the person can have that\nreflexive thought like, oh, there's\nthe thought again that I'm a loser\nor that I should cut myself or I\nshould drink or whatever it is.\nI know that thought appears in me\nautomatically at times because it\nwas in my head for so long, but\nit does not telling me anything,\nit's just an automatic thought.\nIt's not telling me I should drink,\nit's not telling me anything, right?\nOther than the fact that, oh,\nthat's what happens in human beings.\nThat's how the self understanding\nbrings change in us and gets us\nover the barriers of why i've been\ntrying this for what modern mental\nhealth would often have us think.\nI took the Silexan, I did\nthe ten sessions of CBT.\nI'm a failure.\nNothing will ever get better.\nA different framing that says,\nhey, this can get better over time.\nAnd my understanding and my efforts\nand my thought redirection, my\nbehavioral changes all makes it better.\nAnd then those things I don't want\nin my head, they're going away.\nIt's taken time, but they're going away.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm relieved to hear\nyou say that one can have intrusive\nthoughts and that one approach to dealing\nwith those is to acknowledge them and\nlook at them and not try and push them\nback deeper, not try and eradicate them.\nI'm familiar with having intrusive\nthoughts, not all the time, but at\nvarious periods throughout my life.\nAnd the idea that one can just\nextinguish them is a great idea,\nbut that's simply not the way\nit's worked, at least not for me.\nBut I have found that if I just say, okay,\nthis is spontaneously coming up through\nthe neural circuits of my subconscious,\nand they're intrusive, and I don't like\nthem, but I eventually arrive at exactly\nthe place that you describe, which is\nthat there's nothing actionable here.\nThey go from being intrusive and\ntroubling to intrusive and just kind\nof mildly irritating to intrusive.\nAnd like, okay.\nAnd yes, I go through some redirect,\nlike, try and redirect my attention from\ntime to time when they're happening,\nbut I eventually just get to a place\nwhere it's like, okay, it's just\na boring story or boring imagery.\nThere's nothing there.\nThere's nothing there.\nAnd then they eventually\nbreak up like clouds.\nThat process could take a while because...\nPaul Conti: You took the energy\nout of them, you made them go\naway, which happened over time.\nAnd then the energy that was so\npowerful becomes less and less and less.\nAnd what happens?\nThey dissipate, they atrophy.\nThat's how they go away,\nbecause there's no more power.\nThere's no more power in them.\nAnd that really is the\nway that we make change.\nAnd I think your emphasis upon the\nfact that it takes time, the fact\nthat it takes effort, the fact\nthat it only goes away slowly.\nOver 20 years of, at times, being a\ntherapist, what I've seen the most\ndaunting, the thing that makes people\njust give up and go away and go back\nto the things that hurt bad, give up\non themselves, are that it takes time.\nAnd if you think it's supposed to take\ntwo weeks, and the world around you\nis kind of leading you to think that,\nand then you go for help, and the\nhelp kind of leads you to think that\nwhether it's two weeks or it's ten\nweeks, if it's going to take two years,\nyou're going to go away disheartened.\nOr maybe more angry at\nyourself or maybe demoralized.\nSo we have to look at the truth of\nall of this, parallel to your story.\nIn my own life, for years and years\nand years, I carried a negative\nvoice inside that was always waiting\nfor me to do something wrong.\nSo if I say something that's a little\nbit off or not exactly what I want to say\nnow, it would say, like, that wasn't good.\nIt says something negative inside to me,\nor it's waiting for me to drop something\nand say that I'm stupid and clumsy, right.\nWith me all the time.\nBut over time, through self reflection,\nthrough therapy, like, through a\nlot of hard work, but a desire for\nthings to be better and a desire to\nunderstand it, it's not there anymore.\nI mean, every now and then,\nit'll raise its head, right?\nI'll do something.\nReally?\nI dropped a cup of coffee.\nI haven't done it in ten years,\nand it made a mess, and now people\nare coming to clean it up, and,\nman, the voice came back, right?\nBut I could recognize it.\nI really feel bad about this.\nAnd now it gives that voice\na chance to come out, but it\ndoesn't come out much anymore.\nWhereas I lived with it for years,\nit doesn't come out much anymore.\nAnd when it came out not that\nlong ago, I could recognize it.\nI'm not happy I did this and\nlet me help clean it up, but it\ndoesn't mean I'm an idiot, right?\nSo the voice in my head can just\ngo away, as I've been helping it\nto do for a bunch of years now.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nI think also important for people to\nunderstand is that it takes time, but\nthat we can all potentially engage in,\nright, actions, moving towards strivings\nand hopefulness as we cope with those\nand try and diminish those internal\nnarratives, those intrusive thoughts.\nIt's not as if during the entire\nprocess, you can't function.\nI mean, I think that it's cognitively and\nsometimes even physically demanding to do,\nbut we can still engage in healthy ways in\nthe world, and we can still try and avoid\nacting out and avoid forms of denial.\nAs I say this, I'm realizing that the\nwish for or the impulse to really just\nsuppress intrusive thought born of\ntrauma or whatever else is really futile.\nThat's not going to work.\nIt's not going to work.\nWe have to embrace these narratives and\nnot expect them to disappear in a finger\nsnap, but embrace them and see them and\nlook at them and be unafraid to look\nat them and discount where they are.\nAbsolutely not true.\nPaul Conti: I would say\nunafraid to understand, right?\nBecause we must understand means we must\nlook at what's going on inside of us.\nWhen I didn't like that voice\nbut was afraid of it, like,\nwhat is going on inside of me?\nWhat does this say about me?\nAnd I'm directing away from it.\nWell, that's why it was with\nme for, like, several decades.\nBut when I start to go look at\nit, I can find an answer to it.\nAnd again, you have to look at what's\ngoing on in that person because one\nmight presume, and maybe people listening\nare presuming this or maybe not, but\na reasonable presumption that might\njust reflexively happen in a person\nwould be to think that, oh, when I was\nyounger, the messaging I was getting\nwas that you're not good enough.\nRight?\nYou're not good enough.\nThat's why I carry with\nme, you're not good enough.\nBut it's not that sometimes it's the\nopposite, that I was rewarded a lot\nwhen I was younger for doing things\nin a way everyone thought was great.\nLike getting great grades and being well\nbehaved, doing all sorts of things that\nbrought a lot of positive reinforcement\nto me, but I never handled well things\nthat fell even a little bit short of that.\nAnd then it would evoke a lot of shame.\nSo the oppression inside is not\ncoming from denigration, it's\ncoming from something different.\nWhich is also why this is not\na search to blame someone.\nBecause sometimes the people\nwho are giving the message,\nthey're doing the best they can.\nI mean, someone who's saying to a child,\nyou're a loser, like, that's not okay.\nNo matter what, that's not okay.\nBut that's often not how it happens.\nThe parent, like you says, communicating,\nthey don't realize that every time\nthey're admiring a certain level of\nwealth or a certain kind of beauty,\nthey're giving that message that the\nchild that doesn't meet that or ends\nup not meeting that isn't good enough.\nBut they don't know that.\nOr my parents tried to nurture me\nand they did a good job of it in many\nways, and teachers did a good job.\nSo they're not realizing, hey,\nthis person's going to end up\na bunch of years from now not\nthinking anything's good enough.\nThey don't know that.\nSo it's not a search for blame.\nAnd I think that's very, very important.\nVery important.\nBecause often people don't want to look\ninside because they think either I'm\ngoing to find something dramatically\nwrong with me, and the answer I would\ngive is there's almost surely not\nsomething dramatically wrong with\nyou if you're having that thought.\nAnd if somehow there is, you're better\noff looking at it now than later.\nSo that's part of it.\nThe other part is that people\nbecome worried that they're\ngoing to ruin something.\nI like my parents and if I go look\nat this, I'm going to hate them.\nPeople say things or\nthink things like that.\nAnd the idea that we may get down\nto something that really involves\nsomeone being responsible for something\nbad, now, if that's the truth, the\nperson already knows that inside.\nThe vast majority of times, they know\nthat they're just not facing that.\nBut most of the time also, it's not that.\nIt's just like, okay,\nthat's how life evolved.\nAnd what's the predisposition?\nLike, I was smart enough to get good\ngrades, and I have a low threshold\nfor shame, and people reinforced me\nand like, oh, I can kind of understand\nthat, so then I can get control over it.\nIt's not a search for anger,\nfrustration, blame of self or others.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nOftentimes I hear that people are afraid\nof dealing with these deeper issues or\naddressing these deeper issues for fear\nthat they'll lose, say, their drive.\nRight.\nThe thing that makes them\nsuccessful in the first place.\nAnd that allows them perhaps even to\nafford therapy or afford the time to\nthink about these sorts of questions.\nSo it seems to me that the drives that you\nreferred to earlier, the generative drive,\nthe aggressive drive, and the pleasure\ndrive, are such critical nodes or areas\nto look for all of us in terms of figuring\nout whether or not we're doing well or\nless well according to some features\nthat are pretty much universal in people.\nEssentially what I'm saying is, at\nleast by my understanding, we all\nhave drives to some extent or another.\nAnd to the extent that our aggressive\ndrive is very high and pleasure\ndrive is very high, and whether\nor not it's pointed in the right\ndirection, it can be generative.\nIf it's not, perhaps it can\nundermine our generative drive.\nI'm very curious to know how you've\nobserved the different ranges of\nthese drives in people and how that\npredicts whether or not people will\ndo more or less well in different\nareas of life, essentially how\nthe different drives play out.\nPaul Conti: I think that the first\nthing to say is where the drives are\nat, so to speak, in any of us is a\ncombination of nature and nurture.\nSo the nature part tells us the range,\nsort of that the drive is going to be.\nBut because nurture means so much\nto humans, as we understand from\nepigenetics, from the advancement\nof science, we see more and more\nand more how much nurture matters.\nSo the range that's denoted by\nnature is probably pretty broad.\nWe see the manifestation of that, and then\nthe nurture lets us then move that drive.\nNow, sometimes nurture, that's not\ngone in the right place can move\nthe drive in the wrong direction.\nBut as adults, as people who can\ntake care of ourselves, who can\nlearn about ourselves, we can\nchange where the drives are seated.\nIt's not an easy thing to do because\nit requires a lot of changes of\nself knowledge and hard work.\nBut we can do it.\nWe can change the sort of\narray of how those drives are\nmanifesting themselves within us.\nAnd we see that, I mean, that's\npart of the hopefulness of\nmental health treatment, right?\nThat we see not just surface changes,\nbut we can see changes on a deeper level.\nSo I think it's important that\nthese things are not fixed.\nAlthough there are some natural elements.\nSomeone who may have a natural sort of\nlow aggression or low self assertion,\nokay, it's going to be in the lower\nrange, but it doesn't mean that it's\nlocked in at any one particular point.\nAnd that the place that we want to be,\nwhat is the place that's consistent\nwith the things that we want, the\nagency and gratitude as verbs, and the\nsense of well being and all of that.\nSo the idea is the state of health\nhas the generative drive as prominent.\nIt's the dominant drive, and then\naggression and pleasure, which are\nstill active in us, but they're\nsubserving the generative drive, and\nthat's the state that we wish to be in.\nSo when we're assessing, okay, why is\nthere something that doesn't feel okay\nor something that's not going okay, then?\nOne way to start is to look at,\nokay, what's going on in the person,\nwhat may be off in the drives.\nThat gives us a very strong\nidea of, okay, what's going on.\nA way of understanding what's going on as\nwe then go and look in the ten cupboards\nto figure out the specifics, okay, what\nis actually going on here that we can then\nchange, but the framing of what's going\non can come through the lens of looking at\nthe drives and how they're manifest in us.\nAndrew Huberman: What does it look like\nwhen the aggressive drive is very high\nand the pleasure drive is also very high?\nPaul Conti: So if these drives are\nrunning too high, where we end up\nat is in a place of envy and envy.\nI'm always sort of on the soapbox\nabout envy, because I think envy\nis just so wildly destructive.\nAnd if the aggressive drive is\nvery high, so the person say, in\none way this can manifest itself,\njust wants more and more and more.\nThey're not getting satisfaction\nfrom anything, but they want more.\nThat may be because of a strong\nvulnerability inside of them.\nSo something that might map\nto narcissism, for example.\nThere could be a strong aggressive\ndrive to get more, and that leads\nto something that's very unhealthy.\nSo the idea that I want more, I need more,\nI don't have enough, I can't get enough,\nthen fosters envy, which is not the desire\nto be better or to have more, but it's\njust the desire to feel better about the\nself, whether that involves raising the\nself up or bringing someone else down.\nThat's why envy is destructive.\nSo very high levels of aggression that\nare not tempered, for example, by a\ngenerative drive that would also be\nhigh, then create a circumstance of\nenvy, and the envy is destructive.\nAnd the same happens if the\npleasure drive is very, very strong.\nSo if one continues to want more pleasure.\nSo I can't find any satisfaction.\nI don't feel good about myself.\nI feel bereft inside.\nAnd I see that pleasure can make me\nfeel better, but just for a little bit.\nThen it fades away and I want\nmore of it, and I want more of it.\nThat also can lead to the place of envy.\nLike that's the outcome.\nSo if the aggressive drive is running\nvery high, or the pleasure drive is\nrunning very high, or if both are running\nvery high, but it only takes one in\norder to end up in a place of envy.\nSo if the generative drive is not high\nenough to overcome how high the aggressive\ndrive is, which would mean then the\naggressive drive would be sublimated\ntowards good, productive things.\nSo take the energy and put it\ntowards something that is goodness.\nBut if the aggressive drive was way\nout there ahead of the generative\ndrive, that ends up in a place of\nenvy, as does the pleasure drive.\nIf I want more and more and more,\nbut I never get satisfaction from\nanything, it never brings me any sense\nof goodness that where it ends is in a\nplace of vulnerability and resentment.\nBecause envy involves wanting more.\nIf we look at what's really\ngoing on, envy under the surface\ninvolves wanting everything, right?\nIf a person is at the outer limits of\nenvy, which is why envy is so destructive.\nBecause if I can't get enough pleasure\nand there's so much aggression in me, then\nI'm not going to make myself feel better.\nBut what I can do is make\nother people feel worse.\nAndrew Huberman: I want to\nask you more about envy.\nBut first I want to ask is one way to\ncharacterize the generative drive and\nto distinguish it from the other drives\nis to say that generative drives are pro\nsocial, meaning they tend to bring about\nbenevolent interactions between people in.\nPaul Conti: The sense that pro\nsocial as constructive, right?\nIn a sense, building goodness, then yes,\nbecause it's the drive in us that makes\nus want to love and nurture things.\nThat makes us want to learn and\nsometimes learn to make better in the\nworld or learn for learning's sake.\nThe drive is a drive of goodness.\nSo if the drive is then going to\nenact itself in the world around\nus, it's going to be pro social,\nbecause we exist as social units.\nI\nmean, if we decide, oh, I want\nto be an island off somewhere,\nthat's not healthy, right?\nWe exist in social units from small, like\na nuclear family to a neighborhood, all\nthe way up to nations and to the planet.\nSo if we perceive the truth of that,\nthat, hey, there's an interdependence\nbetween me and others, and I see that\nthen the drive will lead to choices and\nbehaviors that are socially constructive.\nAndrew Huberman: Earlier, you talked\nabout aggression, and you were clear\nto make sure that we all understood\nthat aggression does not necessarily\nmean violent aggression, that there\nare different forms of aggression.\nI'm curious if you could give us\nsome examples of how you've observed\npeople with high levels of aggression\nand high levels of pleasure drive as\nwell, both male and female, and here,\nwithout defaulting to stereotypes.\nI think a lot of people just despite\nthe fact that you've clarified\nwhat aggression is and isn't in\nthe context of this conversation,\nwe hear the word aggression and we\nthink verbal attack, physical attack.\nHowever, the way you're describing\naggression and the aggressive drive, I\nhave a feeling that you're referring to\nother expressions of aggression as well.\nPaul Conti: So if the aggressive drive\nis running too high, and that could have\nfactors of nature, factors of nurture,\nfactors of the situation the person is\nin, factors of their whole life, but it\nends up at the moment in a place that\nis too high, then what that person is\ndoing in one way or another is to try\nand exert an unhealthy level of control.\nAnd that can be done in\nso many different ways.\nIt can be done in that overt\nway of just intimidating people.\nOf using harsh language towards people.\nIt can be done by manipulating people.\nIt can be done through passive aggression.\nThere are all sorts of ways that the\nperson can try and exert unhealthy\ncontrol, but that's where we end up.\nIf there's too much expression\nof the aggressive drive in us,\nAndrew Huberman: That makes sense.\nAnd it reminds me of an example from\nmy own life, where, first off, I\nshould say I've had almost exclusively\npositive collaborations among my\ncolleagues at Stanford and elsewhere.\nEvery one of those collaborations\nhas ended in a paper that\nwe were all happy with.\nBut more importantly, the relationships\ngrew and were not diminished.\nBut I had one collaboration with\nsomeone, not to be named, where it\nwas going very well, but I had the\nneed to reschedule an appointment.\nSo I sent ahead a note about the\nfact that my car dealing with.\nI had some other things.\nI explained why I need to reschedule the\nappointment and didn't receive a reply,\nwhich was a little unusual, but then\neventually received a reply that said,\nwell, it's clear that you don't want to\npursue this collaboration, which is like\nthe furthest thing from the truth, right?\nAnd so I expressed that, and then\nthe collaboration was reinstated.\nBut it brought to mind some concern for\nme because it was sort of an extreme\nreaction to something that happens among\nacademics or anyone we get busy with.\nThings come up.\nIt was important to tend\nto the car, that is.\nAnd then at some point later, they\nwere late to a number of meetings.\nOkay, no big deal.\nWe're academics, we tend to run late.\nThat's typical of many academics.\nBut then I was late once to a meeting,\nand they essentially left and wrote\nan email that said something of the\nsort, like, I've got my own great\nideas, so I'm no longer interested\nin pursuing the collaboration.\nAnd I was pretty shocked, because there\nwas nothing really outside the ordinary\nin terms of busyness and prefaceorial\nschedules, and there were other people\ninvolved, postdocs and things like that.\nAnd there was a great\nproject to be worked out.\nSo I remember being disappointed,\nbut also really kind of surprised.\nBut then when I mapped it back to the\nearlier example of the car incident,\nI thought, well, there's a real sort\nof lack of ability of this person to\nhandle disappointment, and yet they're\nexerting or demonstrating rather some\nof the same behavior, of occasionally\nrunning tardy and these kinds of things.\nAnd I remember feeling like\nit was pretty aggressive.\nIt's a pretty aggressive reaction\nto something that could have\nbeen handled with a conversation.\nNow, I must say I'm very grateful that\nthe collaboration didn't proceed and it\nwent elsewhere and it worked out great,\nand they're doing great and we're doing\ngreat, and so, no hard feelings, but\nit stands out to me as a pretty salient\nexample of aggression, but not played\nout at the level of yelling or anything.\nThere's a passivity in there,\nbut then there's also kind\nof a kind of entitlement.\nAnd here, of course, I'm only looking\nat the other person's behavior.\nAnd I should acknowledge, I\nrealize canceling, not good.\nBeing late, not good.\nBut listen, I'm a human being, and I...\nPaul Conti: You canceled once.\nYou were late once.\nThis isn't habitual.\nThis is human stuff.\nRight?\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nAnd a lot of good work had gone\ninto the project, and there was a\ncost where, most importantly, the\npostdoc suffered because they weren't\ninvolved in these interactions at all.\nAnd yet the project halted at that point.\nSo to me, that seems like an\nexample of somebody who has a,\nwell, strong, aggressive drive.\nAnd that's clear from that\nthey are incredibly successful\nin the academic domain.\nAnd when disappointed, lashes back\nor is passive, one or the other.\nIs that what we're getting at here?\nNot surprisingly, perhaps, the person\nrarely publishes with other people.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: Probably that doesn't\nmake a very good collaborative partner.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nAnd it totally makes sense.\nThink about what you're describing here,\nwhich is some vulnerability in the person.\nThere's some way in which the person\ndoesn't feel good enough, no matter\nwhat this person has achieved.\nSo then there's a sense of the\nneed and the right to over control.\nSo when you agree to work together,\nyou didn't agree that I'll\nnever have to cancel anything.\nRight?\nSure.\nBut the thought was different, the\nframing is different on the other end,\nthat now we're going to work together.\nSo I'm exerting significant\ncontrol over you.\nAnd again, you're not aware of it.\nAnd maybe that he's not aware of it.\nAndrew Huberman: In\nthis case, it was a she.\nPaul Conti: Okay, so I was thinking of\nsomeone different, but she has to have\nsome deficit of self that results then\nin the reflexive need to over control.\nAnd think about the first\nresponse is a non response.\nWhich is, that's aggression.\nBut it's just passive aggression.\nThe thought would be, well, you're\nworried something doesn't feel good in you\nbecause I didn't respond, which was true..\nYou're expecting a response,\nmaybe you don't know.\nDid you get the email?\nWhat's happening?\nIs she mad?\nSo it's sort of effective.\nIt creates some consternation\nand some dissonance in you.\nThen on top of that, the person\nis willing to potentially, at that\npoint, sacrifice the relationship.\nSo you think about\naggression now is not good.\nThis excess aggression\nis not good for you.\nIt also is clearly eclipsing\nthe generative drive.\nBecause it's not good for this\nperson and their research.\nIt's not good for this person\nand the postdocs in their lab.\nBut the person is willing to\naccept that in the service of\ngratifying the excess in aggression.\nNow, so then you said something\nthat then sort of made it okay.\nFor the short term.\nOkay.\nThen the person feels gratified, like,\nwhether you apologize or not, they\ntook it as you've, to some degree,\nbowed down before me now, like, it'll\nbe okay, at least for the short term.\nBut then the next thing that happens\nactually does end the collaboration.\nSo that's not good.\nAnd you say, even from a self\nserving perspective, that person was\ncollaborating with you for a reason.\nShe saw a benefit to the science\nthat she's very, very interested in\nthrough the collaboration with you.\nBut then let that all go\nin the service of what?\nIn the service of the ego.\nOf, I don't feel good enough about myself.\nThe response to that then,\nis a response of envy.\nThat I don't like that you\nhave the freedom to behave\ndifferently than I want you to.\nI don't like any of it.\nI don't like that I don't control\nyou as much as I would like to.\nAnd ultimately, it's that\nenvy that becomes destructive.\nSo it's a setback for that person.\nIt's destructive of the\nscience that person was doing.\nIt's destructive of the\nscience that you were doing.\nSo envy is destructive.\nAnd here, the high level of\naggression, the aggressive\ndrive, is at a very high place.\nIt's exceeding the generative drive.\nThe pleasure drive isn't high enough\neither, because there's not enough\npleasure coming from the great\nscience that's being done, right?\nSo then the person is approaching the\nworld through the lens of envy, right?\nThey don't feel good enough.\nThey want to exert that\naggression through over control.\nAnd what they end up doing\nis destructive, right?\nAnd it's very clearly destructive.\nIt's a great example because\nit's destructive of the science,\nwhich is ostensibly the reason\nthat you're there, right?\nIt's the reason you were there.\nBut someone who needs to\nexert over control is there,\nnot just for that reason.\nAnd then the other reasons can trump the\ngenerative reason that they're there.\nAnd that's how envy, when it is the\nproduct of aggression or pleasure\nseeking, being too high, always\nunfailingly creates destruction.\nAnd how different is that from\nagency and gratitude as active verbs.\nThere's a sense of agency, but the agency\nisn't being exactly enacted, because if\nthe agency is being enacted in the service\nof science or career or whatever it may\nbe, that's not going so well, right.\nAnd the gratitude part isn't active.\nLike, my goodness, I'm here,\nI have this great career.\nI'm discovering things.\nI get to spend my life in science.\nI get to collaborate with you.\nThere's so many things to feel good about.\nI have postdocs in my lab, right?\nI get to nurture them because\nI know more and I can guide.\nThat's not leading.\nEnvy is not those things, which is why\npeople who are doing that, at least in\nthis realm of life, although this often\nthis bleeds into other realms of life,\nthe vast majority of times you see, is\nsomeone who does not have happiness in\nthe way that happiness with the quotes.\nThat happiness is the sense of peace,\nthe sense of well being, right?\nBeing able to delight\nin things, contentment.\nThe person doesn't have that.\nAnd here it's interesting, right?\nThis person gets to the highest\nlevels of academia, and they're very\nsuccessful, and they have a lab of\ntheir own, and they're collaborating.\nYou think that's all great, right?\nBut not inside of them.\nIt's not bringing them those things, as\nevidenced by how this person is behaving.\nAnd I would bet almost 100% if you say,\nwhat's that person like in other aspects\nof life, at least in the professional\nrealm, probably in others, too.\nNo one's going to describe a happy person.\nAndrew Huberman: So much of\nwhat you just said captures\nthis individual extremely well.\nAnd it also reminds me that so much\nof the way that you're describing this\naggressive drive can also be observed,\nperhaps in the way that people show up\nto social interactions, not necessarily\nbig interactions, maybe even just\ninteractions between two people.\nWhat I'm thinking of here is the\nperson, male or female, who shows up\nand just kind of takes over, talks\nthe whole time and tells stories.\nI went to a meal when I graduated\nuniversity, and someone showed up\nfor the first time at this meal,\nmeaning we had never met them before,\nand just sat down and just started\ntelling stories for like an hour.\nAnd it was interesting.\nPortions of it were captivating.\nAnd then at some point I realized\nthis is either total pathology.\nLike, this person is crazy, but they\nweren't crazy, or they have no recognition\nthat they're absorbing all the oxygen in\nthe room, as it's sometimes described.\nBut it seemed like they had this need to\njust control the whole environment by way\nof speech, just like fire hose stories.\nAnd I've seen this definitely\nin the academic realm.\nI've seen this in the non academic\nrealm, in social settings.\nWhat's interesting is perhaps why this\nperson does this or these people do this.\nBut what's also interesting\nis how people react to it.\nOn the one hand, I think most people find\nthat kind of obnoxious, but there also\nseem to be people who see this as like,\noh, that person has a lot of agency.\nLike they're a leader.\nThey actually grab a lot of the\nattention that they're seeking.\nAnd we tend to view those\npeople as kind of empowered.\nI don't actually think that they're\nnecessarily empowered, but perhaps it\nstems from the feeling that the rest\nof us, I like to think, have, which\nis some sense of social etiquette,\nwhere there's some give and take.\nYou walk into a room, you kind of\nassess what's the context here.\nThere's some listening as well\nas some speaking and so on.\nWhen someone shows up and kind of violates\nall those rules, on the one hand, it can\nbe obnoxious and overtake everything.\nBut as it said before, there's also the\nsense of like, oh, that must be nice\nto just be able to be as one feels.\nAnd so I'm describing this not because\nI think people should mimic this type\nof behavior either way, be really\nmeek and not say anything that's\non their mind or just overtake, but\nbecause I feel like it might be an\nexploration of this aggressive drive.\nAnd if someone's doing that, are\nthey trying to mask something else?\nAnd why do people react to these\nseemingly powerful people in this way?\nPaul Conti: These things happen\nin the world around us, right?\nThey're independent of the\nspectrum of gender, the spectrum\nof intelligence, achievement.\nThey're human problems.\nSo a person you're describing,\nwhether that person has character\nstructure, problems that are present\nwith them across time, or whether\nthey're in a certain place, whether\nit's in life or today, we don't know\nfor sure what the underpinnings.\nBut what you're describing is\nit's a presentation of narcissism.\nAnd narcissism is rooted not in\nconfidence, not in arrogance.\nIt's rooted in vulnerability.\nIt's rooted in I don't feel good enough.\nAnd narcissism then engages with\nthe world through the lens of envy.\nSo no one else gets to have any time.\nNo one else gets to say anything funny.\nNo one else maybe gets\nto say anything at all.\nThere's a dominance of the room, right?\nThere's a dominance of the room\nthat comes through an inability to\ntolerate the back and forth of human\ninteractions, human engagement.\nSo then that person becomes very dominant.\nAnd why is that?\nBecause when they tell a story and they\nget a laugh or even if it's not that funny\nand it's a 15 minute story, but somebody\nsmiles a little bit or nobody smiles.\nThey can perceive inside that.\nLike, I just did that, I said that.\nAnd maybe somebody responded positively.\nI feel good about that for a split second.\nNow that's gone.\nAnd then the next thing comes, and\nthe next thing comes, because people\nwho are coming at the world through\nthe lens of narcissism, whether it's\njust in that particular event or it's\nacross life, are never satisfied.\nAnd nothing ever brings enough\ngoodness, nothing ever brings\nenough feeling of pleasure.\nSo the person then wants more, and\nthat's how the person dominates the room.\nNow that can be very seductive.\nNarcissistic people, not always, but\nare often very seductive because of\nthat appearance of mastery, of control.\nSo that person did have, we could\nlook at it in the short term and say\nthat person had mastery over the room.\nNo one said anything for an hour but them.\nSo they had mastery over the room.\nThey had control over the room.\nBut what they're doing\nis exerting over control.\nIt's like Pennywise and\nPound Foolish, right?\nThat borrow a dollar today\nto pay back 100 tomorrow.\nBecause they got to control that room.\nBut a lot of people, not everyone,\nsome people are seduced by it.\nBut a lot of people will take away\nfrom that something that's not a good\nfeeling, something that wasn't mutual,\nthat doesn't make a person want to\ncollaborate with that person, even\nbe in the same space as that person.\nSo it's counterproductive\nbecause the people who might come\nunder the spell, so to speak.\nThey're the people who were\nbrought under the spell, right.\nThey're less observant, dynamic,\nintuitive, introspective.\nThey're not the people that you\nwant, in a sense, on your side.\nThe people that would be most valuable\nto collaborate with, even as thought\npartners have conversations with\nthose people are going to be put off\nbecause even if they don't know exactly\nwhat's wrong, they know, like, that\ndidn't feel good and they map, do I\nwant that feeling more in my life?\nNo.\nSo that's the counterproductive aspects.\nThat's why narcissism is destructive,\nbecause you might say, well,\nthere's nothing destructive in that\ninteraction, but again, you have to\nbe standing so up close to it that\nyou don't see the bigger picture.\nBecause when you stand back from that,\nthat's not a person who's, by and\nlarge, you see that's not a person\nwho's interconnected in the world around\nthem, has a group of good, supportive\nfriends, has a bunch of colleagues where\nthey can sort of exchange information,\nbecause all that social dynamic\nhas to happen in the rest of life.\nSo you're seeing a situation that is\ncounterproductive, that is destructive.\nAnd you always see that when people are\nenacting narcissism, whether it's okay,\na bunch of bad things have happened,\nand for whatever reason, like, I'm in an\nunhealthy place and I'm enacting it right\nnow, or if I'm enacting it every day of\nmy life, because it's in my character\nstructure and I haven't recognized and\nchanged it, it's always destructive.\nAndrew Huberman: The narcissists that\nI've known and observed almost always\nseem to have a partner who clearly\nsupports their narcissism, or at least\ndoesn't speak up very much against\nit, at least not publicly, and not\nmuch else except a professional role.\nIn fact, there's one scientist who I did\nnot work with who comes to mind, and the\njoke about him was always that this person\nwould talk about themselves endlessly\nfor the first half hour that you run into\nthem and say, okay, well, enough about me.\nWhy don't you tell me about me?\nThis person, moved to a different country\nwith their partner, comes back every\nonce in a while, has essentially done\nnothing over the last decade or so,\nkind of left the field, and it's kind of\nsecretly the laughingstock of the field.\nThere was one other\nanecdote about this person.\nI'm not picking on them.\nI'm just trying to explore these\ndimensions of aggression and\nlow pleasure drive and envy.\nAt lab meetings, it was well known\nthat they would host a basketball game,\nbut it was well known that you did not\nwant to score on this person because\nyou would be asked to leave the lab.\nAnd Indeed, several people were\nasked to leave the laboratory\nfor having embarrassed the lab\nhead at one of these lab events.\nPaul Conti: By participating in\nexactly the event that was described\nin the way it was described and\ndoing something competent, right?\nAndrew Huberman: So the game was\nessentially a way for the person to\nbuild themselves up, and they were a\nmediocre, at best, basketball player.\nSo here's this game where everyone's\nexpected to pretend, right?\nAnd I have to pretend that the\nperson is actually better at\nwhat they do than they are.\nAnd in some ways, it feels like\na replica of how narcissism shows\nup in so many other areas of life.\nLike you said, these people are rarely\nsurrounded by people who are actually\nvery bright, self effacing, et cetera.\nThey tend to gather people that\njust support them or no one at all.\nBecause no reasonably healthy person\nwould choose to be around that.\nPaul Conti: Because that game is a\nmetaphor for all of life for that person.\nIt's sending that message, like,\nsee this message and extrapolate\nit out to everything else.\nWhat's the metaphor?\nWhat's it communicating?\nIt's communicating that you don't\ndo anything better than I do.\nYou don't rise above me\ninterestingly, right?\nYou don't arise above me in any way.\nYou don't get to know things I don't know.\nYou don't get to do anything better than\nI do or I will be destructive towards you.\nIt's fascinating because\nit's not about the game.\nThe game is a way of\ncommunicating that message.\nInteresting.\nThe person's not even\nthat good at the game.\nLike why not choose something\nyou're really good at.\nBecause then the message is\nnot communicated as clearly.\nAnd a lot of this is unconscious.\nLet's choose something I'm kind\nof fair to middling at, right?\nAnd then make it very clear that\nno one gets to be better or I do\nsomething destructive to them.\nThat's exactly what that is.\nAnd imagine someone is\nthrown out of the lab.\nI mean, this is in many ways\nthe biggest thing in their life\nor one of the biggest things.\nAndrew Huberman: Antigenerative.\nI mean, the cost of that in the\nlarger world is one less potentially\nfantastic scientist, right?\nPaul Conti: And that's always the broader\npicture because the narcissist is standing\nvery, very close to the tapestry, right?\nSo the interaction there is you have\nsquared a basket when I have not.\nSo you don't understand the message\nthat you're not supposed to exceed me.\nAnd now I will get rid of you because\nyou're dangerous to have around.\nBecause you don't get the message\nand you may exceed me in other ways.\nAnd also I'm going to feel better\nbecause I have the power to be punitive,\neven though it's wantonly punitive.\nAnd completely unjustified.\nBut I have the power to do that and it'll\nmake me feel good than to push you away.\nAnd I know that's not going to be good\nfor you and I'll feel good about that.\nBut that doesn't last, of course.\nThat's why the person continues to do it.\nAnd it also doesn't understand at all\nthat that's not good for science or most\nimportantly, that's not good for me.\nThere's a graduate student in that\nlab because you didn't say fire the\ngraduate student, make the graduate\nstudent leave if the person wasn't good.\nNo, it's make the graduate\nstudent leave no matter what.\nSo the person is doing things that are\ninjurious to the society around us,\nobviously to the specific person they're\ntargeting, and also to themselves.\nAnd that's where, if you follow\nenvy and you see high levels of it\nin situations that are unbounded.\nIt's like this situation is unbounded in\nthe sense that the person can do that.\nThere's no higher authority.\nAndrew Huberman: This is changing.\nAnd by the way, I should back up a second\nand say that I do believe, and it's\nbeen my experience, that most scientists\nand lab heads are not narcissists,\nare quite kind, are benevolent.\nI mean, they'd be a little quirky.\nWe're scientists, after all, but\nnot narcissists at the same time.\nIt is true that for a long time,\nless so now, laboratories were\nsort of like little fiefdoms.\nThere was very little oversight\nfrom the universities.\nAnd so the lab you joined became\nyour entire world and landscape.\nAnd there was some exploitation by\nnarcissistic lab heads for sure.\nAs you said, it was unbounded, right?\nLike there was no oversight.\nWhereas this would be much harder to\nrecreate today if someone wanted to.\nPaul Conti: And I think that's why\nby almost everyone listening to\nthis, it will resonate with them.\nThey'll find some familiarity,\nbecause you see this, or you\ncan see this in situations where\nthere's a bounded group of people.\nThere's just a certain group of\npeople in a certain situation,\nand that's who they are.\nBut the authority of the person\nleading the group is unbounded.\nSo there's a situation where if that\nperson has narcissistic tendencies,\naggressive drive is too high, pleasure\ndrive is high, but not being met.\nIf all of those things are happening,\nthat's when you see this come to light.\nWhich is why the destruction varies\nbased upon the destruction that's\npermissible within the framework.\nSo here that this person wasn't\ngoing to fire everyone in their lab.\nSo in a sense, they could\nonly damage their lab so much.\nAlthough maybe if you damage your\nlab so much, you don't get funding,\nyou inadvertently sink yourself.\nSo even there, that person could\nbring about their own destruction.\nBut when you see the other end,\nwhere it's truly unbounded in\nthe sense of war, someone who can\ncontrol a machine of war, who then\nhas everything, what do they need?\nWell, they need something they\ndon't have and never will get.\nSo now they start enacting war,\nand war is destructive, right?\nAnd you think, oh, that\nperson wants something.\nHow many times does someone start a war?\nThere's clearly an unjustified war, right?\nIt's a war because they want\nsomething, then they get\nsomething and they're satisfied.\nThat's not how it goes, right?\nThen they get something and they're\nnot satisfied, and they want more.\nSo in discussions at times about\nnarcissism and envy and how that\ncan play out on the world stage.\nSo sometimes huge events in human\nhistory will come up and people, for\nexample, will bring up Adolf Hitler\nand the idea that Hitler wanted things.\nWanted things.\nNo, the unbound narcissism, the\nunbound envy wanted destruction.\nThis is a person who, if things\nhad continued to go as this person\nintended, there would have been no\none left on earth but him, because the\nprocess is nothing but destructive,\nwhich is why, after the fact, there's\nincalculable human carnage, right?\nAnd he himself was among the\nincalculable human carnage, because\nthat's the endpoint of narcissism.\nOf narcissism on a broad stage.\nThat's the endpoint of envy\nat its highest magnitude.\nAnd we see that as examples.\nWhether we see on the smaller stage of\nthe lab head that you're describing or\non the larger stage of unbounded war, we\nend up with destruction, like 100% time.\nThat's the final common\npathway for all of that.\nAndrew Huberman: Are there some\nconsistent themes of childhood that\nlead somebody to become a narcissist?\nAnd in addition to that, I'm curious\nwhether or not narcissists ever have\ninsight, whether or not, if offered the\nopportunity to explore the ten cupboards\nunder the structure of self and function\nof self, whether or not they eventually\nsee inside those cupboards and go,\noh, my goodness, I've got this self\nthat's clearly overinflated, and I've\ngot these defence mechanisms, and I'm\nso envious and modify their behavior,\nor whether or not the narcissists are\nimmune from constructive self reflection.\nPaul Conti: To answer the first part\nis the vast majority of narcissism.\nIt may be all of it, we don't know for\nsure, is rooted in the childhood trauma\nof not feeling good enough, which is not\nan excuse for people doing awful things.\nThat's not what we're saying.\nWe're trying to have an\nexplanatory mechanism, right?\nWhich goes back to formative life\nexperiences and not feeling good enough,\nwhether it was because that person was\ndirectly denigrated, or that person\nwasn't denigrated, but could never\nwork hard enough, never could be enough\nto get approval right again, it's not\n100%, and human beings are complicated,\nbut if you go and look, you see that,\nthat there was never a state of like,\noh, I feel good enough about myself.\nAnd if there's never a state of, I feel\ngood enough about myself because someone\nhas told me that and given me the pat\non the head or given me the positive\ncomment, you can see how in a certain sort\nof natural lay of the land, genetically\nand in concert with other experiences,\nthat person can get to adulthood\nwith a lot of aggression in them.\nAnd never having experienced\nI'm good enough, it's still\nrunning along inside of them.\nAnd then they're enacting that\naggression in the world around them.\nThat's most commonly what we see.\nAnd because there's such deep\nvulnerability and such deep insecurity,\nthen people say, people who suffer from\nfull blown narcissism, narcissistic\npersonality disorder, so inaction of\nenvy on the highest levels, that is,\nthey're so defended, they're so strongly\ndefended in an unhealthy manner from\nseeing their own vulnerability that it\nis extremely difficult to get that person\nto come around and say, okay, let's look\nin those ten cupboards within the field.\nPeople often talk about\ntreating narcissistic people.\nThey talk about it in a nihilistic way.\nAnd some, you'll see, very experienced\npeople say, oh, that's impossible, right?\nThat never gets better.\nNow, I'm not a believer\nin therapeutic nihilism.\nI think that, yes, it is the norm\nthat that person just can't get it\ntogether to go look at that thing.\nThey're so defended against\nit, they're so afraid of it.\nThey won't look anywhere near it.\nSo they're looking in the other direction\nand they're furthering all that unhealth.\nIt's not the case that\nit's always that way.\nAnd on a couple of occasions I\nhave worked with, seen, witnessed\nnarcissistic people who can make changes.\nNow, it's usually in the context\nof something very extreme\nthat causes them to do that.\nSo someone who will no longer have\naccess to family members they want to\nsee or to financial resources that they\nneed to keep themselves afloat, it's\nthings that often are that dramatic.\nIt's not always that.\nBut we can see, though, in those kind\nof extenuating situations where the\nproblem is so big, the envy is so high.\nBut the motivation for change is\nvery, very high, because since on\nthe carrot and stick model, the stick\nhere is very, very strong, that if\na person then goes and does that,\nyou can see change inside of them.\nSo we're never in a place of therapeutic\nnihilism, but the barriers to that\nare very, very high because the self\nis so wounded that the person is\nprotecting that self so strongly.\nThat's why the narcissism\nand envy are so full blown.\nAnd it's hard to get that\nperson to go back and look.\nBut not impossible.\nAndrew Huberman: Based on what you're\ntelling me, it seems that it's a\nvery low probability that a non\nclinician could change a narcissist.\nIn other words, if one is engaging in\nthe world with a narcissist because\nthey have to, presumably, or they\njust find themselves in that place,\nwould you say to that person, there's\nvery little, if anything, that you\ncan do to change the narcissist's\nbehavior or psychological framework?\nBecause, of course, if the narcissist\ncan't often do it for themselves with the\nhelp of a skilled clinician, why would\nanyone else be able to achieve that?\nPaul Conti: We're coming at what\nwe're doing here from a perspective\nof truth about human beings, right?\nAnd that truth brings with it hopefulness.\nIt brings with it hopefulness that people\ncan change and how people can change.\nAnd I am 100% all for that.\nIt's the way to look at ourselves.\nBut it is also true that there are\naspects of pathology that require\nclinical treatment in order to improve.\nS\no now we're looking from the other\nside and saying, hey, there's a\nproblem here and there's a deep\nproblem here, and that we have to\ncome at from a different perspective\nof how can you help that problem?\nAnd there's a science behind this,\ntoo, of what level of clinical\ncare, for example, is most likely\nto be helpful to someone like this?\nAnd it's not an individual clinician even.\nIt's a team of people who work\nthrough different modalities who\ncan sort of wrap around that person.\nSo it's not just a level of clinical\ncare is needed, but it's a relatively\nhigh level of clinical care.\nAnd that, in general, is the only\nway that we get at narcissism.\nThat's not 100%, but that's\nthe vast majority of time.\nSo what can then, the person do?\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: A person cannot be\na team of clinicians, right.\nWhat that person can do,\none choice is to disengage.\nBut disengagement can come with\nthe promise of reengagement.\nMany, many times I've worked with\npeople and practiced and rehearsed with\nthem, like, okay, what might you say\nto someone along the lines of, I've\nknown you for a long time, or, I care\nabout you, or, I love you, whatever\nthey may say to lead in, but I can't\nbe with you, or I can't be around you.\nThere's something going on\nthat makes it not okay for me.\nIt doesn't feel okay in person.\nMaybe says things like, you're aggressive\nor demeaning or whatever it is.\nOr maybe they just say, it just\ndoesn't feel okay, I can't have it.\nAnd then the need to step\naway from the person.\nBut, look, if you got some help, right,\nif you took better care of yourself\nin ways that would be better for you\nand for the people around you, then\nof course I'd want to be in your life.\nSomething like that.\nSo disengagement can come with that\nencouragement, right, to the person.\nBut one way or another, you have to\nset boundaries, which is okay, I have\nto deal with this person, so I'll deal\nwith them a little bit, or I don't have\nto deal with this person, so I won't.\nOr I can't get away from this person,\nso I have to take with a grain of\nsalt what they're saying to me.\nBut ultimately, some form of\nstrong boundaries or disengagement\nis like, that's the response.\nThat's the self care response.\nFor the person who's with the narcissist.\nAndrew Huberman: What are some\nother ways that the aggressive drive\nand pleasure drive and generative\ndrive, for that matter, play out?\nFor instance, we talked about the former\npatient of yours who eventually switched\njobs, clearly had a generative drive\nwithin him, but it was being blocked by\na number of choices rooted in narratives\nthat originated in childhood, et cetera.\nWe talked about individuals with\nhigh aggressive drive, high degree of\npleasure drive, but a very diminished\ncapacity to experience pleasure\nand therefore a lot of envy and the\ndestruction that comes with envy.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: What are some of the\nother variations on these drives as you\nobserve them in your clinical practice?\nPaul Conti: Well, our overall framing\nis we want the generative drive to be\nthe one that's deterministic . It's\nthe one with the strongest influence.\nSo we want to nurture the generative\ndrive in us and in others, and it\nmakes sense for us to talk about that.\nBut we've looked at how do\nthings get out of balance.\nAnd from the perspective of,\nwell, what if the aggressive\ndrive or the pleasure drive.\nWhat if they're too high?\nRight?\nAnd then it makes sense that often, not\nalways, what can be driving them to be so\nhigh are things that aren't healthy in us.\nThen the higher they get, the\nharder it is to gratify them.\nSo we end up with that problem of envy.\nBut we can be out of balance in the\nother direction too, where the person\ndoes not experience an ability to\nengage with the world around them.\nThey don't think they can do anything\nto change anything for the better,\ninside or outside of themselves.\nAnd they're not doing much.\nThey don't feel that they can do much and\nalso not receiving pleasure from things.\nThere's no gratification from\nthe things a person is doing.\nLike, we see situations like this\ntoo, with the aggressive drive,\nthe pleasure drive, or both.\nAnd then we end up not at envy, because\nenvy is the side of excess, but we end\nup at demoralization on the lower side.\nNow, demoralization is not a\nspecific psychiatric diagnosis.\nIt can predispose to psychiatric\nproblems like the biochemical\nabnormality of depression.\nBut what we're talking about here is\nnot a psychiatric diagnosis, right?\nLike envy is not a psychiatric diagnosis.\nIt's a thing that can be experienced,\nthat can lead to diagnoses.\nThe same thing with demoralization.\nIf you don't feel that you can make\na difference to anything and you're\nnot enjoying anything or feeling\ngratification from anything, then\nthat pool is going to win out.\nThat's going to be a demoralized person.\nThe same way, of course, we know in\nexperiments, when you have a rat going\nfor food, if you do it enough, when\nthe rat goes for the food and you take\nthe food away, the rat stops trying.\nAndrew Huberman: And they\nlearned helplessness, right?\nPaul Conti: That exists in us too.\nAnd it comes along with\nall sorts of other things.\nBecause being not rats, we have\na whole bunch of thoughts about\nthat, of, oh my God, I'm not good\nenough and nothing will ever be.\nOkay.\nSo demoralization then can be very strong\nin taking a person away from the other\nthings we're trying to seek, either\nbecause that person has essentially the\nlearned helplessness and all the things,\nthe complicated things inside of us that\ncan come along with that, or the person\nisn't gaining pleasure from anything.\nSo when we're considering the ways\nin which we can be out of balance, we\nthink, okay, aggression and pleasure\ndrive, if one or the other or both\nis too high, we end up at envy.\nAnd if one or the other or both are\ntoo low, we end up with demoralization.\nAnd you can take almost any scenario.\nIt could be a scenario of\nsomething that's just not really\nnot going well for a person.\nIt's not a clinical scenario,\nit's a thing in a person's life.\nOr we can take clinical scenarios\nand the vast majority outside of\noutliers, like a head injury, for\nexample, we can take those scenarios\nand we can look at it in that way,\nand we can understand what's going on.\nAt least we can understand enough\nthat when we go back and look in the\nten cupboards of the two pillars,\nwe can then have some understanding\nof, okay, what is going on.\nWe know the basic picture and how things\nare not in the balance we want them in\nnow, we can understand that enough to go\nback and then look in those ten cupboards.\nAnd I believe that just about everything\nexcept those biological outliers,\nlike a head injury, fits into that\nheuristic, which is why we can use it\nto understand, we can use it to help.\nWe can use it to make change.\nAndrew Huberman: What a powerful lens\nto think about and explore the self and\nwhere things are working for us and where\nthings are possibly not working for us.\nIf I or anyone else out there wanted\nto get some read on, assess their\nlevel of aggressive drive and their\nlevel of pleasure drive and their\nability to experience pleasure, what\nsorts of questions would one ask?\nFor instance, is it a\nquestion of how driven am I?\nHow much get up and go do I have?\nHow much pleasure do I experience\nfrom an interaction with a\npuppy, an interaction with food?\nIs it too much?\nDoes it draw me off course?\nAre those the sorts of very\nsimple, but perhaps also very\ninformative questions that we could\nstart to use to probe our psyche?\nPaul Conti: Yeah, I think yes,\nbut I would come top down.\nSo if the goal of health is that\naggression and pleasure, those\ndrives are subserving the generative\ndrive, then start to look there.\nIf a person can take an honest inventory\nof self, like, what kind of force\nam I being in the world around me?\nAnd that could mean, for example, what\nkind of force am I being in my family?\nAm I denigrating to the people around me?\nAre the other people in\nthe home afraid of me?\nWhat kind of force am I\nbeing a force for good?\nAm I bolstering?\nPeople can't always see that in\nthemselves and take stock of themselves.\nBut what we're talking about is\nsituation where we think a person\ncan like they can bring to bear.\nWho am I being in the world in other ways?\nThink of the example of the person\nwho needed to leave the job.\nWho could look at that and say,\nno, I'm not being generative in\nthe world in the way I want to.\nI'm certainly not doing my job\nas well as I would want to.\nI'm making my own life worse.\nSo that person could then see that's out\nof balance or in another way, a person\nmight see a lot of what I'm doing is sort\nof self serving or maybe destructive.\nPeople can realize that, right?\nSo you can realize by taking an\ninventory of self, is the generative\ndrive what's deterministic in me?\nAnd again, not always, but we're\ntalking about a process of exploration.\nIf the answer to that is yes, if you\nsay, I'm trying to be the best person\nthat I can, and I think about the\npeople over whom I have any authority.\nAnd I try to be reasonable, and I try to\nbe fair, and I try and be circumspect, and\nI try and think in someone else's shoes.\nSometimes I have to set boundaries or\nexpectations or even punishment, right?\nBut I'm careful about how I'm doing that.\nAnd I'm certainly not perfect, and I\nget things wrong at times, but I do\nthink I'm contributing to the world.\nI'm doing whatever I take\non as well as I can do it.\nI'm productive at work.\nMy kids are doing okay or my\nfriends are doing all right.\nWhatever it is that if we can come\nup with that, then we can say,\nokay, exhale a little bit, like\nyou're in a good place, right.\nIt doesn't mean everything\nis optimal, of course.\nSo then go look at the level\nof the aggressive drive, which\nmight mean how assertive am I?\nRight?\nAm I the kind of person who\ncomes up to the precipice but\ndoesn't make the decision?\nAm I the kind of person\nwho's a little too assertive?\nAnd sometimes I'm sort of\nwalking on people a little bit.\nLike a person can go look at\nthe aggressive drive within\nthem or pleasure seeking.\nAm I doing things that\nbring me gratification?\nAm I engaging with the people around me\nin a way that brings the gratification\nthat one might wish for, right?\nSo if it's in a romantic\nrelationship, is there romance?\nLike, are we being nice to one another?\nSo you can go and look at that and\nsay, am I getting gratification\nfrom the things I'm doing?\nAm I taking wherever this drive\nis within me and trying to satisfy\nit in reasonable, healthy ways\nthat are also good for others?\nAnd we're back to the generative drive.\nSo that's one way of coming at it, and\nit's the way that we would like to,\nbecause now what are we trying to do next?\nAnd what can we make things better?\nCan we optimize things?\nOkay, things are okay, but\ncan we make them better?\nBut let's say we see that the generative\ndrive is not winning the day, right?\nAnd people can see that.\nLook, I'm seeking pleasure, right?\nIt's why I got, for example, I\nhear over and over, that's why I\ngot addicted to this substance.\nIt now is not providing any pleasure\nto me and is now making me miserable.\nBut I wanted what it was giving me.\nAgain, this doesn't mean that the person\njust wants to have the world's best time.\nRight?\nIt may mean that they're\nreally suffering a lot.\nAnd the pleasure that that drug\ngave them was some relief from pain.\nThis is how many, many people\ntragically ended up becoming addicted\nto and dying from opiates, right?\nBecause, say, the opiate after the\nsurgery or the opiate after the\ninjury, then is soothing something.\nAnd it's soothing something\nbecause that person feels less bad\nabout something inside of them.\nYou hear this all the time.\nThat.\nThat then fosters addiction.\nSo that person looking for pleasure,\nthis isn't something where we would\nsay in some light hearted manner, that\nperson took chances with their life.\nI mean, sometimes we'll see that.\nBut more and more, what people are looking\nfor then is relief from suffering, right?\nBut we can get to that point where we\ncan ascertain, for whatever reason,\nthat the pleasure seeking is too much.\nAnd if pleasure seeking and\naggression are too much, we\nbecome aware of dissatisfaction.\nIf you're relying too much on\naggression, I always want my way.\nIt's not always going to happen.\nOr I always want that pleasurable thing.\nI always want to feel better.\nThat also doesn't happen.\nRight?\nSo then that can guide us towards\nbeing aware of where are those drives?\nAnd if the drives are high, how\nmuch dissonance is created by\nwhat's actually coming of the drive\nversus the level the drive is at.\nI guess it's a long way of saying yes to\nyour question, but I would sort of come\ntop down because the generative drive is\nso important and it does gate forward.\nLike, kind of, where are we at in\nthe spectrum of how healthy am I?\nOr are there elements of unhealth I want\nto kind of go after, or am I seeing things\nin myself that really say things that\nare unhealthy are really dominating my\nlife are deterministic, like addiction.\nJust one example.\nAddiction.\nThings that are self destructive.\nBecause then that's a place to then look\nat it more through the clinical lens.\nAnd maybe I won't just talk to a\ntrusted other and go get a book, but\nmaybe I should have clinical care.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah the example of\naddiction is very potent, and it also\nbrings to mind the perhaps less apparently\ndangerous situation, but one that I\nthink is really common, where people\nhave a certain amount of aggressive\ndrive, they have a certain amount of\npleasure drive, but there's a kind\nof passivity and draining out of the\ngenerative drive or competing out of the\ngenerative drive because of social media.\nAnd the reason I bring this up is, again,\nnot because I dislike social media.\nI rely on and use social media for\nteaching and learning extensively.\nReally.\nBut in going back to the pillars that\nunderlie whether or not we achieve\nand experience agency, gratitude,\npeace, contentment, and delight\nwithin the pillar of function of self.\nThere's this thing, salience,\nand what we're paying attention\nto, internal and external.\nAnd social media does seem to me a\nunique circumstance, never before\nobserved in human evolution, where\nyou have a near infinite number\nof environments available to you.\nAnd we know that a picture is\nworth 1000 words and a movie\nis worth a billion pictures.\nWhen it comes to drawing our attention.\nI mean, you give a young child,\neven an infant, an iPad, I\nmean, that kid is in the tunnel.\nI don't necessarily\nthink that's a bad thing.\nAnd computers and computer screens\nare going to be a part of their\nlives now and forever, presumably.\nBut it is the case that there are a lot\nof people who perhaps have the propensity\nfor a strong generative drive, but\nbecause they also have a propensity for\na pleasure drive, they wake up, they pick\nup the phone, they look at the phone,\nsomething captivates their attention,\nthen they're thinking about that.\nIt might be something that brings\nthem delight, but more often than\nnot, it's something that brings\nthem either mild irritation or mild\nentertainment, maybe even intense\nentertainment for a short while.\nBut very quickly, minutes and hours go by\nin which we are not engaging in the world\nunless we are posting valuable content.\nAnd so social media is a bit\nof a drain on these drives.\nI mean, it taps into these\ndrives in very strong ways.\nAnd all one has to do is observe\nthe behavior of people in public\nspaces, now, in airports, on\ntrains, even in their cars.\nAnd people are essentially\nwatching TV all day long.\nAnd it does concern me, and I raise\nit because I feel like it can distract\nfrom our generative drive in a way that\ndoesn't necessarily speak to any kind of,\nlike, deep character flaw or any kind of\nsubconscious narrative, but just that.\nThat salience cupboard, clearly\nsomething within that salience\ncupboard is happening that's\nunprecedented and very, very powerful\nand potentially quite destructive.\nPaul Conti: Yeah.\nI think to understand this,\nI would cite this belief.\nI believe this to be true,\nthat human beings have a long\nhistory of underappreciating the\npower of the discoveries that\nare then in their own hands.\nSo we discover gunpowder.\nHow long until we're shooting each other?\nWe discover nuclear fission.\nNow, are we going to destroy the planet?\nSo social media, in a\nsense, it's a discovery.\nIt's a thing that comes from what we've\nfigured out as humans that now is there in\nfront of us, and big, powerful discoveries\ndeserve to be treated with respect.\nGunpowder is very powerful, and if\npeople need to hunt in order to survive,\ngunpowder can help them hunt without\ngetting hurt, and we'd be more successful.\nNuclear fission has provided\nsome good things to humanity,\nbut it can also destroy humanity.\nSo I think the same is true here,\nthat what you're talking about is\nsomething of immense power, and you\ncan see how, if it gets out of balance.\nSo let's use the salient.\nSo let's say the social\nmedia is too salient.\nThat's going to make a problem.\nIf it's too salient in the sense that\nthe person is always looking at things\nthat don't make them feel good enough.\nWell, that's not going to go well,\nand that's going to affect what's\nin those other ten cupboards.\nAnd what is built on top of it.\nSo then it gets into the unconscious\nmind, like, oh, I thought I\nwas good enough until now.\nI'm looking at all this social\nmedia, and I realize I'm not.\nI mean, this is.\nPeople who treat teens often talk about\nthis, that you see something that you\ndidn't often see before, where a person\nwho might have gotten through a lot\nof formative years thinking like, oh,\nhow I look is okay, for example, then\nis bombarding themselves with social\nmedia that tells them how they look\nis not okay, and then that changes.\nAndrew Huberman: Absolutely.\nOr perhaps social media is just\nsimply absorbing a ton of time and\nenergy, but mostly time that could\nbe devoted to a generative force.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nThat's the other side of it.\nSo think about the example of\nthe person who, I know it wasn't\nsocial media, but we were saying,\nwell, what if it were social media?\nThat instead of 90 minutes a day, it's\n8 hours because there's an analog there\nand we see a lot of this, then it's\ntaking something that can be good in\nsense, you could say even should be good.\nThere's enough out there in\nterms of learning and bolstering\nthat why should it not be good.\nBut it's not good because\nthe defenses then shift.\nLike if you're relying on it 10 hours a\nday, there has to be some denial, right?\nBecause there are other\nthings to do in the world.\nThere has to be some avoidance.\nThere has to be some rationalization,\nlike something is going on\nthere that's not healthy.\nSo if you tell me this person is utilizing\nsocial media 10 hours a day, they're not\nlooking at things that make them feel bad\nabout themselves, they're just doing it.\nThen I think, okay,\nsomething is out of balance.\nNow it may be that that person's\ndefenses are out of balance.\nSo think about the example of the\nperson with the job they didn't like.\nThen their defensive structure changes.\nThen the thing that was good\nfor them, they rely on too much.\nAnd now it becomes something\nthat's not good for them, right?\nSo then you go and look at what\nelse is out of balance here.\nWhat else is driving this now?\nMaybe it's being driven by the change\nin defense mechanisms, et cetera.\nMaybe it's the other way around that this\nperson just kind of habituated to doing\nmore and more and more and more of it.\nAnd then you would come at it in a\ndifferent way of, okay, can you slowly\nbut surely do less, replace the time\nwith things that were good before?\nBecause you could then back that person\nout to where they were before, but\nyou're not going to back the person\nout to where they were before if\nit's being driven by something else.\nSo we again come to the curiosity.\nYou tell me that person is on\nsocial media 14 hours a day.\nI'm curious.\nI want to understand what is\nthe balance of those drives.\nYou've just told me a very\npowerful point about salience that\ndoesn't sound like a good one.\nSo already you're giving me clues\nabout where the drives are, which\nmeans, where's that person at?\nWhat's going on in all those cabinets?\nThen you give more information.\nNow sit and talk with the person.\nNow you're going to understand what\nis the lay of the land here and how\ndo we go about making it better.\nAndrew Huberman: I love the\nconcept of the generative drive.\nFirst of all, because it's pro social.\nIt brings about great things\nfor us and for the world.\nAnd what is better than peace,\ncontentment and delight.\nEspecially when we remind ourselves that\nthose are active phrases or those can be\nachieved and experienced inside of action.\nIt's not just sitting, levitating,\nnavel gazing, that sort of thing.\nSo it's not enlightenment, right.\nIt's peace, contentment and delight.\nPaul Conti: Very big difference.\nAndrew Huberman: Very big difference.\nYes.\nOne of the other reasons I love this\nconcept of the generative drive so much\nis also because it is a verb state.\nIt has to do with creating things in\nus and in the world, in cultivating\nour experience of things and what\nwe do and what we say and how we\nrespond to what others do and say.\nAnd I also like it because it's distinct\nfrom the way that we're normally taught\nto think about psychological well being\nor being a healthy individual, which\nusually centers around a discussion of\ngoals and values and what am I trying\nto focus on, and what sorts of people\ndo I want to engage with in the world?\nAnd certainly all of that is really\nimportant goals and who you engage with.\nBut I think for many people out there,\nmuch of their time is spent thinking\nabout other people, like how healthier\nor unhealthy are the people they're\ndating or their friends, or what's going\non between two family members, which,\nof course, is fine to think about.\nBut a lot of emphasis is placed\non our assessments of others\nand how those are impacting us.\nAnd in some cases, people default to\njust thinking about others and their\nproblems and seeing their problems.\nAnd what we're really talking about\nhere is a process of introspection\nand inquiry that's very structured.\nAnd as it's been laid out by\nyou, these two pillars, structure\nof self, function of self.\nWith these ten cupboards, that might\nsound like a lot of cupboards, but\nas we talked about in the first\nepisode, all of that flows up to these\nvery simple ideals and concepts and\naction, states and ways of being.\nAnd to me, there's nothing more\npowerful than the statement\nthat what we are all seeking are\nstates of agency and gratitude.\nBecause, again, to go back to\nthe analogy of physical fitness,\nthere are not an infinite number\nof different physical states or\nstates of fitness that one can seek.\nThere's endurance, there's\nstrength, there's flexibility,\nthere's dynamic movement, there's\nexplosiveness, there's speed.\nThere are a bunch of subtleties to it.\nBut here it really seems that the\npsyche, ourselves and our mental\nhealth is really tractable if we\nturn the lens and we look inward.\nPaul Conti: Yes, I think that hits\nupon a very, very important point\nas we talk about understanding\noneself and the process of change.\nAnd I would describe that\nas rational aspiration.\nSo let's use the physical health example.\nIf I think, okay, I want to be healthier,\nI want to have more strength, I want\nto have more endurance, and I might\neven have ideas of what that would be.\nI want to be able to run a certain\ndistance in a certain time, lift\na certain amount of weight, I\nhave an idea of what that is it.\nBut rational aspiration\nis rooted in our present.\nI'm aware that there's a me\nnow that isn't in that state.\nAnd I'm aware that there are things\nthat I'm going to do to get to that\nstate and I'm not that dreading them,\nlike, okay, they'll be difficult, right?\nBut that's okay, I can do\ndifficult things, I can take\npride in doing difficult things.\nAnd that's how we all achieve things.\nSo I see myself in the present\nbecause of course goals are good,\nand that's true as long as we're\nstill living our lives in the present\nbecause otherwise goals just become\nfantasies or things we want to possess.\nSo if I'm aware of the state of physical\nhealth I'm in right now, and I'm aware\nof the state of physical health I want\nto be in, and I know there's a bunch\nof pathways I could take to get there,\nbut I have to think about it, figure\nit out, do those things, and then\nI'm going to navigate myself there.\nThat's how the whole process is good.\nI don't feel bad about myself now.\nI recognize something\nI would like to change.\nI'm not saying, oh, you're\na loser, because you don't\nhave those things, right?\nI feel good about myself now.\nI recognize there's something I want\nand there's going to be a process,\na process across time, across effort\nthat's going to navigate me there.\nThen when I get there, I\nfeel good about being there.\nIt's very, very different\nif I think I want that.\nI want to possess in a sense.\nI want to possess the ability to run\na certain distance in a certain time.\nI just want the thing.\nI'm covetous of the thing.\nThat is not good, right?\nBecause a person then often\nis denigrating to the self.\nNot always, but that's a motivation to\ngo out and get that thing that's better.\nAnd they're really lamenting\nthe process of getting.\nThey just want something as an endpoint.\nAnd that doesn't make for happiness,\nit doesn't make for even the\nhumility and humility in action,\nthe gratitude, the humility is,\nI can't just do that overnight.\nI'm going to have to work hard.\nPeople have to work hard.\nI'm no different than anybody else.\nI'm not special.\nI got to get in there and work and use the\nelbow grease, and then I'll get healthier.\nLike all of that is good.\nThat I just want to possess\nsomething is not good.\nAnd that's why people in scenarios like\nthis, they might go through maybe in\nan unthinking way or they're gutting\nit out or wherever they go, and they\nget that thing, right, but then that t\nhing is not enough and they want more.\nNow, there's nothing wrong with wanting\nmore if it's the healthy inaction of self.\nI'm going to now map my way.\nThis feels better.\nI want to map myself from here to the\nnext level of better physical fitness.\nThat's different than\nI just want that thing.\nBecause then if I get it,\nit won't be good enough.\nIt doesn't make me happy.\nIt doesn't satisfy me.\nAnd that's the unhealthy state of\njust wanting things to possess them.\nAnd then we don't feel good\nabout them, which is the\nthought of if you give people.\nIf you give a person something,\nthey'll resent you for it.\nAgain, we're painting it in a sort\nof certain way, the context of that\nstatement, which I used to hear\na lot, even when I was younger,\npeople would say that, right.\nAnd what were they trying to get at?\nWhat they were getting at is it\ndoesn't feel good if you didn't\nwork for something, right?\nLike if you didn't work very hard\nand you got a C, but I give you\nan A or somebody gives me an A.\nI know that that's not good.\nI know that I got the thing.\nI got the A.\nAnd I might feel happy in the moment\nbecause I wanted that thing, but\nthere's no real pleasure in it.\nThere's no satisfaction, there's\nno contentment, there's no sense of\nself, there's nothing generative.\nI didn't work hard enough\nto go from a C to an A.\nAnd that really brings us back\nto the self that we're growing\non top of the structure.\nRight.\nAnd how that self is functioning.\nHow it's striving.\nBecause now we're really\ntalking about strivings.\nAnd if I'm going to strive for something\nand work hard to get it, will I get the\ngood feeling on the other side of it.\nAnd now we're living in\nthe generative space.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, I love the\nstructure of what you've laid out.\nAgain...\nPaul Conti: Thank you.\nAndrew Huberman: The pillars of\nstructure of self and function of\nself, with ten cupboards between\nthe two of them that, when explored,\ncan seem a little bit complex.\nBut they're really some very\nstraightforward types of inquiry that\nanyone can go about, about self awareness\nand address potential defense mechanisms.\nWhat we're conscious of, maybe\nwhat we're not conscious of.\nLook at our behaviors and our strivings\nand how that flows up to these simple\nideals again, of empowerment, humility,\nagency and gratitude as verbs.\nAnd then from that, peace,\ncontentment and delight.\nAnd the generative drive, which, gosh,\nif there ever was a more powerful\nconcept and something to strive for,\nI don't think it exists, because the\ngenerative drive is extraordinary in the\nnumber of different ways it plays out,\nand it seems always positively right.\nAnd of course, the aggressive drive,\nthe pleasure drive, exists to varying\nextents in all of us, but cannot be\nallowed to overcome the generative\ndrive if we're going to really thrive.\nSo thank you again so\nmuch for this framework.\nAnd again, to remind people listening\nand watching that this framework is\nmapped out in a downloadable PDF.\nIf people want to see it visually,\neven though we've touched on it several\ntimes before, I really appreciate\nhow logical, clear and actionable\nthis framework is, and also that in\nproviding a framework for us, it gives\nus something to hold our mind to.\nI think I, and so many people out\nthere are familiar with being in a\nstruggle and not being able to orient.\nWhere am I in the struggle?\nNot knowing what to do?\nAnd you've provided some incredible points\nof reference for us to really focus on.\nStart asking questions about I and\nhow I see myself, what am I paying\nattention to, and so on and so forth,\nto really first anchor and orient, and\nthen be able to move forward in this\nprocess as many times as is required to\nget where we each and all want to go.\nSo thank you so much for this.\nI know in our next discussion we're\ngoing to touch on the relational\naspects of human existence, not just\nselves, but interactions between selves,\nincluding some of the, let's call\nit, darker and unfortunate aspects of\nhuman existence, like narcissists, and\nsome of the challenges of different\nfull blown personality disorders.\nBut also just in terms of building healthy\nrelationships between friends, romantic\npartners, parents and children and\nsiblings and coworkers and all the rest.\nSo thank you again for this\nincredibly rich knowledge that you\nprovided us, and a map forward.\nPaul Conti: You're very\nwelcome
