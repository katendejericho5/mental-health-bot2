    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday is an Ask Me\nAnything episode, or AMA.\nThis is part of our\npremium subscriber channel.\nOur premium subscriber\nchannel was started in order\nto provide support for\nthe standard Huberman Lab\npodcast, which comes\nout every Monday\nand is available at\nzero cost to everybody\non all standard feeds--\nYouTube, Apple,\nSpotify, and elsewhere.\nWe also started the\npremium channel as a way\nto generate support for exciting\nresearch being done at Stanford\nand elsewhere, research\non human beings that\nleads to important\ndiscoveries that\nassist mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nI'm also pleased to inform\nyou that for every dollar\nthe Huberman Lab Premium channel\ngenerates for research studies,\nthe Tiny Foundation has\nagreed to match that amount.\nSo now we are able to double\nthe total amount of funding\ngiven to studies of mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand human performance.\nIf you'd like to subscribe\nto the Huberman Lab podcast\npremium channel, please go\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nIt is $10 a month to subscribe\nor you can pay $100 all at once\nto get an entire 12-month\nsubscription for a year.\nWe also have a lifetime\nsubscription model\nthat is a one-time payment.\nAnd again, you can\nfind that option\nat hubermanlab.com/premium.\nFor those of you that\nare already subscribers\nto the premium channel, please\ngo to hubermanlab.com/premium\nand download the premium\nsubscription feed.\nAnd for those of you that\nare not Huberman Lab podcast\npremium subscribers,\nyou can still\nhear the first 20 minutes\nof today's episode\nand determine whether or not\nbecoming a premium subscriber\nis for you.\nSo without further\nado, let's get\nto answering your questions.\nThe first question\nis about nature,\nin particular about the\nscientifically-supported\nbenefits of getting\noutdoors into nature.\nThe person asks about\nthe role of sunlight,\nthe role of calming\nsounds, the role\nof observing wildlife, of\nobserving green colors,\nand, quote, \"other stuff.\"\nAnd in fact, I'm glad that\nthey asked about \"other stuff\"\nbecause I get the question about\nthe scientifically-supported\nbenefits of nature a lot.\nI often also get the\nquestion about grounding.\nFor those of you that aren't\nfamiliar with what grounding\nis, grounding is a practice of\nputting your feet on the Earth\ndirectly with bare\nfeet, oftentimes\ninto soil or on a lawn.\nAnd it's a question that I\nseem to get more and more.\nIn fact, every week for quite a\nlong while now, on social media\nor elsewhere, somebody asks me\nabout the scientific support\nfor this practice of grounding.\nSo obviously there's\na lot of interest\nin what the scientific research\nsays about getting into nature\nand putting one's\nfeet on the ground,\na.k.a. grounding, and so on.\nOK, so if I'm going to\nanswer this question,\nI first have to be\nvery direct with you.\nThere is excellent,\nmeaning dozens, if not\nhundreds, of quality\npeer-reviewed studies which\nsupport the value of getting\nsunlight in one's eyes,\nin particular early in the day\nto set your circadian rhythm.\nThis is something that I've\ntalked about extensively\non the Huberman Lab podcast and\nas a guest on other podcasts.\nIt's one of the first and,\nfrankly, most important\nitems on the toolkit for sleep,\nwhich is a zero-cost toolkit\nthat you can access by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com,\ngoing to the menu,\ngoing to Newsletter.\nYou can see it as a PDF there.\nYou don't have to sign\nup for the newsletter.\nYou can just access\nthat toolkit for sleep.\nAnd you'll notice that very\nclose to the top of that list,\nif not top of that list, is\nto get sunlight in your eyes\nearly in the day.\nYou don't have to see the\nsun cross the horizon.\nIf you can, that's great.\nBut if you wake up after\nthe sun has already\nrisen, go outside,\nface the sun, blink\nas necessary to\nprotect your eyes,\nbut get some sunlight\ninto your eyes\nevery single day or as\noften as you possibly can,\nespecially on overcast days.\nThat's an absolutely\nunequivocally\nscience-supported tool that will\nincrease daytime mood, focus,\nand alertness and will\nimprove your nighttime sleep.\nViewing morning sunlight also\nhas profoundly positive effects\non metabolism.\nNow, those effects\non metabolism could\nbe the direct effect of viewing\nsunlight or, more likely,\nthey are the\nindirect consequence\nof getting better\nsleep at night.\nSo getting sunlight in\nyour eyes early in the day\nand ideally in the\nevening or late afternoon\nbefore the sun sets is a\nvery well supported protocol\nthat we know is beneficial\nfor numerous aspects\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nAnd of course, sunlight and\ngetting sunlight in one's eyes\ndoes require that\nyou get outside.\nYou simply will not\nderive the same benefits\nfrom viewing sunlight\nif you try and do it\nthrough a window or\nwindshield or if you\nlook at a picture of\na sun on a screen.\nForget it.\nYou are not going to set\nyour circadian rhythm.\nYou are not going to derive\nall the positive effects\nof sunlight by trying\nto get it from screens\nor from looking at pictures of\nsuns or something of that sort.\nNow, if you are somebody\nthat, for whatever reason--\nseasonality, where you live on\nthe planet, work schedule, et\ncetera--\nwho cannot get sunlight in\nyour eyes early in the day\non a consistent basis, well,\nthen you might consider\npurchasing a so-called SAD lamp,\nwhich is for seasonal affective\ndisorder, which is very\nbright light that you can look\nat in the morning for usually\nabout 5 to 10 minutes.\nPeople will put it\non their counter\nwhile they make their morning\ncoffee, eat their breakfast.\nAnd that has also been shown\nto improve mood, focus,\nand alertness and set\none's circadian rhythm.\nBut it is not nearly as\neffective as getting sunlight\nin your eyes.\nNow, why am I talking\nabout this practice\nthat I've already\ntalked about extensively\non numerous podcasts before?\nWell, because the\nquestion is about nature,\nand sunlight is a key feature\nof our natural environment.\nBut the person is also\nasking about other features\nof nature-- seeing green\ncolors, or blue colors,\nor running streams\nfor that matter.\nWell, here, too, we can ask,\nwhat does the scientific data\nreally say about\nthings like going\nnear a waterfall, or a running\nstream, or being near an ocean?\nAnd actually, this\nis quite interesting.\nThere is actually a\npeer-reviewed literature\non negative ionization,\nas it's called,\nwhich is a pattern\nof ionization that's\npresent close to bodies of water\nand particular types of bodies\nof water, such as waterfalls,\nrunning streams, et cetera.\nThere's actually a laboratory\nat Columbia University School\nof Medicine that has\npublished fairly extensively\non the health benefits\nof negative ionization\nas it relates to\nsetting circadian\nrhythm and some other aspects\nof mental and physical health.\nI intend to host the\nhead of that laboratory\non the Huberman Lab podcast\nin the not too distant future.\nFor now, we can\nsafely say this--\nthere does seem to be\nsome positive health\nbenefits to placing oneself\nnear bodies of water,\nin particular moving\nbodies of water.\nAnd of course, as is always\nthe case when there's\na discovery about how the\nnatural world can impact\nhealth, there have been\nsome technologies developed\nto create negative\npatterns of ionization\nwithin a home environment.\nBut as with viewing\nsunlight exposure\nand comparing it\nto, say, SAD lamps,\nthe negative ionization machines\nthat one can purchase and put\nin their home environment have\nbeen shown in a few studies\nto produce some positive\nhealth benefits.\nBut those positive\neffects in no way\nreach the level of\npositive effects\nthat have been demonstrated\nin studies where people\nare actually\nspending a dedicated\nperiod of time outdoors as\nnear a moving body of water.\nSo in thinking about nature,\nnatural environments,\nthere's strong evidence for\ngetting sunlight in one's eyes.\nThere is some evidence for being\nnear moving bodies of water,\nperhaps--\nagain, I really want\nto highlight perhaps--\nbecause of negative ionization\ncreated by those moving\nbodies of water.\nThere is far less evidence\nfor sunlight simulators\nor negative ionization\nmachines used indoors.\nAnd then the asker of this\nquestion also, quite correctly,\nasked about things\nlike calming sounds,\nwatching wildlife,\ngreen colors, et cetera.\nAnd herein lies a really\nimportant point for everyone\nto digest.\nWhile, of course,\nanswering a question\nabout the natural\nworld or about health\nrequires that we first pose a\nhypothesis-- for those of you\nthat aren't familiar\nwhat a hypothesis is,\na hypothesis is a\nstated prediction.\nSo it's not a question.\nA question would\nbe something like,\nis getting out into nature\ngood for our health?\nA scientific hypothesis is where\none actually takes a stance.\nFor instance, you\ncould take the stance\nand make the hypothesis\nthat getting out\ninto nature for 30 minutes\nper day, three days per week,\nimproves mood and\nnighttime sleep.\nSo that's a hypothesis\nthat then one would go on\nto design an experiment\nto test and then evaluate\nthe data from that\nexperiment and compare it\nto the hypothesis, either\nvalidating or negating\nthat hypothesis.\nThat's essentially\nhow science is done.\nThere's a lot more to it,\nbut that's essentially\nthe scientific method.\nAnd while, of course,\nthe scientific method\nis a fabulously powerful\ntool, for some questions,\nit is a less potent tool.\nAnd the question of is\ngetting out into nature\nhelpful for enhancing our\nmental and physical health is\nthe sort of question\nthat while ideally you\ncould design a really well\ncontrolled study to address,\nit's actually quite difficult\nto design such a study.\nAnd here's why.\nIn order to perform a study\nthat's very well controlled,\nmeaning where you can isolate\nindividual variables--\nlike sunlight, like the sorts\nof color contrast that one sees\nin a natural scene outdoors\nin a forest or near a river--\nin order to address\nwhether or not\nthe calming sounds or the\npresence of squirrels running\nthrough your environment\nare the relevant factors,\nit becomes incredibly\ndifficult to try and isolate\nindividual variables, meaning\nas soon as you bring people\ninto the laboratory, yes, you\nhave more control over which\nvariables, as they're\ncalled, you present them,\nby bringing them into a\nroom that essentially has\nno art on the walls and\nthen having them look\nat a picture of a sun\nor looking at sunlight\nor listening to soothing\nsounds or looking\nat a picture of a\nforest, of course,\nyou're controlling the\nindividual variables.\nHowever, there is\na sort of gestalt,\nmeaning a collective\npicture of being\nin nature that\nbrings together lots\nof different elements--\nthe element of surprise,\nfor instance.\nThe other day I was\nout for a Sunday hike,\nand that morning I\nsaw a squirrel running\nacross my path, and\nit was interesting\nbecause the squirrel had\na pinecone in its mouth.\nIt had been chewed\ndown to the cob.\nAnd the squirrel was probably\nonly about 7 or 8 inches long,\nand the pine cone was probably\nabout 9 or 10 inches long--\nthe cob of the\npine cone, that is.\nAnd the interesting thing\nis that the squirrel\nwas carrying it long ways\nfrom the tip of the cob.\nAnd so I delighted in the\nfact that this little squirrel\nwas working so hard to carry\nthis object through the woods.\nAnd this object was literally\nlonger than its own body\nlength, and it looked so\ndedicated in its running\nacross the path in\norder to do whatever it\nwould with that pine cone cob.\nSo something like that\nobviously stuck in my memory.\nIt delighted me.\nAnd at the very same\ntime, there were a number\nof other things happening\nbesides the presence\nof that novel\nwildlife experience.\nThere was the sound of a stream.\nThere's the sunlight.\nThere's the color\ncontrast everywhere.\nI'm breathing\nfresh air because I\nwas far away from any cars\nor any civilization, in fact.\nAnd so here's what we know.\nThere are dozens,\nif not hundreds,\nof studies that show\nthat if people get out\nof doors into nature--\nthis could be parks.\nThis could be near a stream.\nThis could be an\nocean, any number\nof different natural\nenvironments.\nAnd if they do that for\nanywhere from 10 to 30 minutes,\nthree to seven days\nper week, indeed there\nare demonstrated\nsignificant reductions\nin things like blood\npressure, resting heart\nrate, improvements in\nsleep, improvements in mood.\nAnd so I think we can very\nreliably say that, yes,\nor perhaps even absolutely yes,\ngetting outside into nature\ncan enhance various aspects of\nmental health, physical health,\nand thereby performance in\ndifferent aspects of life.\nHowever, when talking\nabout the benefits\nof getting into nature, we are\ntalking about hundreds, if not\nthousands, of variables, some\nof which we are aware of,\nsuch as the presence of wildlife\nor sunlight or color contrast.\nAnd then, of course,\nthere are going\nto be dozens, if not\nhundreds, maybe even\nthousands of other variables\nthat we're not even aware of.\nPerhaps it's\nnegative ionization.\nMost people aren't measuring\nthe ionization of the air\nwhen they go out into nature.\nBut perhaps it's\nalso the presence\nof certain smells from the\nsoils that are being broken down\nand then they're changing the\noxygenation state of the air\naround you, the\nplants, et cetera.\nAgain, so many\nvariables, that, frankly,\nto try and isolate any\none of those variables\nin the laboratory seems\nnot just artificial,\nbut I think that it\nactually would just\nlead to a diminished sense of\njust how valuable nature is.\nSo while, of course,\nthe Huberman Lab podcast\nis a podcast where\nwe always center\non science and\nscience-related tools,\nmeaning protocols\nthat are grounded\nin quality peer-reviewed\nstudies that have been subjected\nto control conditions where\nsome people are getting,\nsay, the drug treatment\nor taking the supplement\nor doing a particular behavioral\npractice and other people\nare not or doing some variant of\nthose and dose response curves,\nall of that stuff, when it\ncomes to the question of\nwhether or not it's valuable\nto get out into nature,\nI think it's a very\nstraightforward yes.\nAbsolutely yes.\nGet out into nature as often\nas you can and safely can,\nof course.\nI realize some of this\nis weather permitting.\nPeople live in different areas.\nSome people are in cities.\nSome people are in deserts.\nSome people are near the ocean.\nBut getting out into nature has\nbeen shown over and over again\nto have numerous\npositive health effects.\nAnd yet, unless we're talking\nabout sunlight exposure\nand isolating the variable\nof setting one's circadian\nrhythm by viewing sunlight\nearly in the day, all\nof the other features of\ngetting out into nature,\nthings like forest bathing--\nthis is a term coined from some,\nfrankly, pretty nice studies\nthat were done in Japan in\nwhich people placed themselves\ninto forest-like environments\nfor a certain period of time.\nThere were control groups\nwhere people were not\nplaced into those\nenvironments, and the people\nthat did this so-called\nforest bathing experienced\nenhanced mental and\nphysical health.\nThat brought on a practice of\npeople who could not get out\nof doors into forests\nbringing plants\ninto their home environment,\nwhich I think all of us\nwould agree look nice.\nThey often will add\npleasant odors to the air,\nand perhaps they do actually\nshift our mental and physical\nhealth in significant ways.\nI suppose it depends on\nhow much you like plants,\nhow much you pay attention\nto them, and, of course,\nhow many plants there are.\nBut-- and I think this\nis a really important\n\"but\" to emphasize--\nwhile most all questions\nabout tools and protocols\nfor enhancing health\nimmediately lead me to say, ah,\nthis study or that\nstudy or, yes,\nthere's evidence or, no, there\nisn't evidence, when it comes\nto questions about nature\nand grounding in particular,\nI take the stance that this\nis a unique instance where\nwe know there are just so\nmany benefits of getting out\ninto nature that\ntrying to isolate\nany one of those\nvariables in a quality,\nrigorous way within\nthe laboratory\nalmost seems too artificial\nto really justify\nthe conclusions that arrive.\nNow, I'm sure there are some of\nyou out there who are aware--\nand if you're not,\nI'll tell you-- there\nare studies that have\nexplored this practice\nof so-called grounding.\nThey've had people come\ninto the laboratory\nand place their feet on soil\nthat is contained within a box\nor there are other studies\nwhere they actually\nhave people go out of\ndoors and place their feet\nonto the grass or the ground.\nAnd there are a\nbunch of theories\nas to how grounding\ncould improve\none's mental and physical health\nthat aren't just about getting\noutside.\nSo the theories go\nthat this has to do\nwith the exchange of\nelectrons with the Earth\nand the Earth's\nsurface in particular.\nThere's been the\nargument made that shoes,\nin particular shoes\nthat have rubber soles,\nmay block some of\nthis electron exchange\nwith the surface of the Earth.\nThere have been theories\nabout the tactile--\nthat is, the touch sensation--\nwith the Earth being important.\nNot a lot of science\npublished in, let's just say,\nblue ribbon journals,\nwhich is not\nto diminish some of the journals\nthat these have been published\nin, but just to say that, again,\nthere are so many variables\nassociated with a practice such\nas grounding that I'll simply\nsay, yes, please do get\nout of doors into nature.\nI try every Sunday to do my zone\n2 cardio by rucking or jogging\nor hiking, often\nwith other people\nif I'm trying to be social\nwith family or others.\nBut the point is\ngetting out of doors\nhas myriad positive\neffects on mental health\nand physical health.\nAnd of course, when you're\nmoving out of doors,\nyou're also getting that\nzone 2 cardio or other forms\nof physical benefit by\nelevating your heart rate\nor perhaps you could even do\nyour resistance training out\nof doors on other days.\nNow, I also try to get out of\ndoors other days of the week.\nBut oftentimes, I'm,\nby way of weather\nor by way of other commitments,\nforced to be indoors,\non planes, here at\nthe podcast studio\nwhere certainly I'm indoors.\nBut I try and get out of\ndoors at least a few minutes\neach day for a morning stroll,\nlooking at sunlight, et cetera.\nSo the long and short\nof this is, yes, there's\nsome evidence for grounding.\nIs it super strong evidence?\nNo, it's not.\nWe don't really know what it\nis about placing one's feet\nonto the Earth that is producing\nthe positive effects that\nwere observed in those studies.\nAnd those studies made\nsome reasonable attempt\nto isolate the variables and\nfigure out whether or not\nit was ion exchange with\nthe Earth or the tactile,\nmeaning the touch\nsensation, of having\none's feet on the ground.\nFrankly, I don't think\nthere's enough quality science\nto really draw any firm\nconclusions about that.\nHowever, if you like the idea of\ngrounding, by all means, do it.\nIn fact, if it\nfeels good to you,\nI recommend getting your\nmorning sunlight out\nof doors with your bare\nfeet on the ground.\nOr if you're like me,\nyou put on your shoes,\nand you take a walk most days.\nAlthough, I've tried this\npractice of grounding,\nand it feels pretty\ngood, meaning\nit feels nice to have\nmy feet on the Earth,\nprovided I'm on clean\nsoil or clean lawn.\nDefinitely don't do\nthis at the dog park.\nHookworm is a real\nthing, by the way, folks.\nSo pay attention to\nthe sorts of surfaces\nthat you're putting\nyour feet onto.\nBut the question about\nwhether or not nature\nis valuable for our mental and\nphysical health is an easy one.\nIt's an absolute yes.\nBut isolating the particular\nvariables about nature\nthat are most beneficial, well,\nthat's a much tougher question,\nand it's one that, frankly,\nthe scientific method is not\nand, to be honest,\nI don't think ever\nwill be in a position\nto isolate and really\nnail down specifically, because\nas soon as you get specific\nabout that question,\nyou start to diminish\nthe value of the study itself.\nSo the long and short of\nthis is get out into nature\nas often as you safely can.\nIf you can exercise out\nof doors, even better.\nIf you want to make\nit social, great.\nIf you don't want to\nmake it social, fine.\nIt's your life.\nIt's up to you.\nBut there certainly is value\nin getting out into nature.\nIt's also just beautiful\nfrom a visual perspective,\nfrom an auditory perspective.\nAnd I myself try and take at\nleast a few trips each year.\nNone of these are\nparticularly expensive trips\nwhere I try and get\nout hiking, camping.\nThe weekly walks in nature\nare an absolute must for me.\nIf I miss one because of\nweather conditions or travel,\nI make it a point to\ntry and get into nature\nmore during the following\nweek or whenever I can.\nAnd frankly, I don't have\na scientific explanation\nfor why nature is\noh-so beneficial,\nexcept for the sunlight piece\nand perhaps this grounding\npiece and the negative\nionization piece.\nAnd frankly, I\ndon't worry so much\nabout the lack of\nvariable-isolating, quality,\npeer-reviewed studies that\nsupport the benefits of getting\nout into nature.\nI simply like getting\nout into nature\nand into different\nnatural environments\nas much as I possibly can,\nbecause, for whatever reason,\nimagine those reasons have\nsomething to do with serotonin,\ndopamine, hormones,\noxytocin, probably\na bunch of different\nthings that are\nrooted in how our\nnervous system evolved\nin natural environments.\nWell, it just feels really good.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nAsk Me Anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast premium channel,\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which,\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to\nchange the format\nor anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd to fund research--\nin particular, research\ndone on human beings,\nso not animal models,\nbut on human beings,\nwhich I think we all agree\nis a species that we\nare most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically one research that\nis aimed toward developing\nfurther protocols\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel,\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcast\nand other media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the kind\nof research that\nprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow, an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generously\noffered to do dollar-for-dollar\nmatch on all funds raised\nfor research through\nthe premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science-related tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab Premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMAs.\nYou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions.\nAnd you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent, such as transcripts\nof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.\nAnd again, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\npremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
