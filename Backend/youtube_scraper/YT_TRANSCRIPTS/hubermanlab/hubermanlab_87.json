    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are talking about goal\nsetting and achieving goals now we've\ndone three full episodes about this\ntopic previously I did a solo episode\nabout this topic where I described the\nNeuroscience of the circuitry in the\nbrain and body that underlies goal\nsetting and pursuit I also hosted two\nexpert guests who have done extensive\nresearch on these topics those guests\nwere Dr Emily baltis from New York\nUniversity and Dr MAA Shankar so today's\nepisode is going to focus on the key\ntakeaways from those three previous\nepisodes as well as incorporate new\ninformation that has been published in\nthe scientific literature since those\nepisodes aired so that by the end of\ntoday's episode you will have a potent\ntool kit for setting and pursuing goals\nwe will talk about how to select which\ngoals to pursue and when we will talk\nabout how to measure your progress we\nwill talk about how to initiate and\nsustain motivation as you pursue your\ngoals we are also going to dispel some\nprominent myths about goal setting in\nPursuit given that this is a toolkit\nepisode I will talk about some of the\nunderlying biological mechanisms for the\nprotocols that I describe but most of\nwhat I will cover are the protocols\nthemselves the how to identify a goal\nselect the best goal for you to pursue\nhow to initiate goal Pursuit how to\nmaintain goal Pursuit how to evaluate\nprogress and how to do the post Hawk\nanalysis after you achieve a goal or as\nthe case may be not achieve a goal\nalthough I'm confident that if you\nimplement even a subset of the protocols\nthat we cover today that you stand the\ngreatest possible chance of both setting\nthe proper goal and achieving that goal\nand I can say that both with confidence\nEnce and humility because the protocols\nI describe were not created by me they\nare gleaned from the scientific\npeer-reviewed literature and they have\nbeen shown to work before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is eight sleep\neight sleep makes Smart match covers\nwith cooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity sleep is the foundation of\nmental health physical health and\nperformance when we're sleeping well and\nenough everything in life goes much\nbetter and when we aren't sleeping well\nor long enough things in life get worse\nwe know that from data we all know that\nfrom our own experience one of the\nessential things to getting a great\nnight's sleep is that the temperature of\nyour sleeping environment needs to be\nsuch that your core body temperature\ndrops by about 1 to 3° in order to fall\nand stay deeply asleep and then in\nincrease by 1 to 3° in order to wake up\nfeeling refreshed in the morning with\neights sleep smart mattress covers you\ncan program the temperature of your\nsleeping environment so that it's\nideally matched to your temperature\nneeds I started sleeping on an eight-\nSleep mattress cover a few years ago and\nit has completely transformed the\nquality of the sleep that I get so much\nso that I actually loathe traveling\nbecause I don't have my eights Sleep\nmattress cover when I travel if you'd\nlike to try eight sleep you can go

8sleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by Maui Nei venison Maui Nei\nvenison is the most nutrient-dense and\ndelicious red meat available I've spoken\nbefore on this podcast in Solo episodes\nand with guests about the need to get\napproximately one gram of highquality\nprotein per pound of body weight each\nday for optimal nutrition now there are\nmany different ways that one can do that\nbut a key thing is to make sure that\nyou're not doing that by ingesting\nexcessive calories Maui Nei venison has\nthe highest density of quality protein\nper calorie and it achieves that in\ndelicious things like ground Meats\nvenison steaks jerky and bone broth I\nparticularly like the ground venison I\nmake those into venison burgers probably\nfive times a week or more I also like\nthe jerky for its convenience especially\nwhen I'm traveling or I'm especially\nbusy with work and know that I'm getting\nan extremely nutrient-dense high quality\nsource of protein if you'd like to try\nMaui neui venison you can go to mauii\nVenison\ndocomo and get 20% off your first order\nagain that's Maui venison\ndocomond to get 20% off okay let's talk\nabout goal setting and pursuit and as I\nmentioned a few minutes ago this is a\ntoolkit episode so I'm not going to talk\ntoo much about the mechanistic\nunderpinnings of the protocols for goal\nsetting and pursuit I'm mostly just\ngoing to give you those protocols but\nbefore I do that I want to take just\nthree minutes I promise just 3 minutes\nor less and describe the neural\ncircuitry involved in goal setting and\npursuit and there are two reasons to do\nthat first of all the biology of goal\nsetting and pursuit is absolutely\nbeautiful it's incredible that we and\nmany other animals in fact have this\nneural circuitry and that it works in\nthe way that it does but equally\nimportant is that when we have a\nmechanistic understanding or framework\nfor how a protocol or set of protocols\nwork it makes it much easier to tweak\nthose protocols and customize them to\nour unique needs okay so with that said\nthe goal setting and pursuit circuitry\nessentially consists of four major\nstations in the brain although it's\nimportant to point out that each of\nthose stations has a number of other\nconnections that are important for the\nwhole goal setting and pursuit process\nbut we can distill things down to four\nmajor hubs or stations within the brain\nand those are the basil ganglia the\nlateral prefrontal cortex and the\norbital frontal cortex so going through\nthose one by one the amydala is a\nstructure within the brain you actually\nhave two of them one on each side of the\nbrain that is involved in circuits\nassociated with arousal in driving\nlevels of alertness it's also involved\nin fear you've probably heard that many\ntimes before but also things like\nanxiety and actually the amydala can be\ninvolved in what we call positive\nveilance experiences not just the bad\nstuff like fear and anxiety but also\npositive forms of arousal and even\nlearning the basil ganglia include a lot\nof different brain structures but for\nsake of today's discussion what you need\nto know is that the basil ganglia\nincludes two major Pathways one is the\nso-called go pathway which is the\npathway involved in generating actions\nand the other is the so-called no-go\npathway or the pathway involved in\nwithholding or ceasing action and this\nis really important to understand\nbecause with all goals we have to ask\nourselves are we trying to learn how to\ndo something new or are we trying to\nwithhold a certain set of actions and of\ncourse any time we learn anything it's a\nprocess of both generating and\nwithholding certain actions so we've got\nthe amydala and we have the basil\nganglia which has this go action\ninitiating and no go action withholding\ncircuitry within it and then there's the\nlateral prefrontal cortex which is\ninvolved in immediate and long-term\nplanning and this is going to be a key\ncomponent of today's discussion because\nwe aren't going to be talking about\nlateral prefrontal cortex per se but we\nare going to be talking about time\nperception in the context of setting and\nachieving our goals because setting and\nachieving our goals is all about being\nable to orient both in space knowing\nwhere we are and what we're doing but\nalso in time know where we are in that\nroad of progress toward achieving our\ngoal or crossing that finish line and\nrepeatedly updating those Finish Lines\nin many cases and the fourth structure\nis the orbital frontal cortex which like\nall brain areas tends to be a\nmultitasker it does a bunch of different\nthings but for sake of today's\ndiscussion it's important to understand\nthat the orbital frontal cortex is\ninvolved in evaluation of our current\nemotional state and arousal state\nas it relates to our goal Pursuit for\ninstance are we happy because we are\nsensing progress or are we unhappy and\nfeeling frustrated or sad or angry\nbecause we are feeling that we are not\nachieving progress or that somehow we\ncan't get into the sorts of actions that\nare going to allow us to eventually\nreach our goals okay so I described four\nmajor structures all of which\ncommunicate with each other and of\ncourse a lot of other brain areas and\nthose four structures were the amydala\nthe basil ganglia the go and no-o\ncircuitry the lateral prefrontal cortex\nand the orbital frontal cortex and those\nrepresent the core components of the\nneural circuitry involved in goal\nsetting and pursuit now I realize I\ndidn't time that section so I don't know\nwhether or not it was 3 minutes or less\nbut if it was shorter than 3 minutes\ngreat and if it was longer than 3\nminutes well I promise to shave a couple\nminutes off the end of this episode okay\nso now you have the understanding that\nwe all have the same neural circuitry\nfor goal setting and pursuit I find that\namazing regardless of whether or not you\nwant to achieve a fit Fitness goal or an\nacademic goal or a work goal monetary\ngoal relationship goal maybe you want to\njust get better at relaxing I've been\ntold I should perhaps pursue that goal\nwell you're going to use the same neural\ncircuits for each and any of those I\nfind that incredible I also find that\nvery reassuring because what it means is\nthat if we can focus on the tools and\nprotocols that are anchored in the\nbiology of goal setting and pursuit as\nwe understand them to exist in all\nhumans and indeed in other animals as\nwell well then we should have the\ngreatest possible confidence that we\nwill in fact achieve our goals so how do\nwe go about doing that well the first\nquestion you need to ask yourself is\nwhat goal do I want to pursue and the\nfirst protocol for deciding what goal\nyou want to pursue is actually a quite\nsimple one in terms of How It's stated\nbut it's fairly complex for a lot of\npeople to answer and that is which\nspecific goal are you going to try and\npursue because guess what folks most\npeople who trying to achieve many goals\nsimultaneously fail at all of them this\nis what I call the overhaul approach\nwhen people think okay you know in\nJanuary 1 or next month or next week or\nperhaps even today I'm going to start\nexercising I'm going to start meditating\nI'm going to learn a language I'm going\nto learn to dance I'm going to do all\nthese different things and that's just\ntoo many goals I think here is an\nappropriate place to highlight the word\npriority a priority literally means one\nthing that you place ahead of all others\nthese days we hear a lot about\npriorities plural but we really should\nbe thinking about priority and defining\nour priority for learning in a given\nphase so if you are somebody who wants\nto get more physically fit or you want\nto learn something cognitively that's\nterrific you are allowed to have\nmultiple goals but I highly recommend\nthat you first select just one goal of\ncourse you don't let go of other aspects\nof your mental health and physical\nhealth that you don't throw your life\naway in service to this one goal goal\nwe've all seen how that goes and it's\nnot a britty picture but rather that you\ncontinue to engage in healthy ways with\nthe other aspects of your life that\nyou're proficient at or mostly\nproficient at but that you select one\ngoal that you're going to try and attain\nhow you select that one goal of course\nit's going to reflect your values your\nmotivation your resources but it's very\nimportant that you spend some serious\ntime defining that one priority that one\ngoal for this initial goal setting and\nPursuit period and in a moment I'll tell\nyou how long that goal Pursuit period\nought to be but for some people the best\nway to define which goal they're going\nto pursue is to write out the different\nthings that they want and then\nessentially cross off the various things\nthat they're willing to put on hold for\nthe time being and circle the thing that\nthey're really going to focus on and\nonly that thing and again this is highly\nindividual it's going to depend on you\nyour past your present your future your\nresources all of that but having that\none priority is is going to really\nincrease the probability that you're\ngoing to achieve your goal now we also\nknow from the scientific literature that\nhow lofty that goal is will impact\nwhether or not you are able to achieve\nit and I think most people mistakenly\nbelieve that if a goal is easy to\nachieve it's more likely that they will\nachieve that goal sort of a duh but in\nfact the opposite has been shown to be\ntrue if a goal is too easy to achieve it\nseems that it doesn't recruit sufficient\namounts of the arousal Network that\ninvolves the amydala but a bunch of\nother brain structures as well that get\npeople into the necessary actions to\ncontinually pursue that goal this\nperhaps should not be surprising in\norder to learn something we have to\nshift our nervous system into states\nthat are somewhat uncomfortable these\nshould be safely uncomfortable States\nbut they should be uncomfortable States\nand we're going to talk more about this\nas the episode continues but any kind of\nsuccessful learning or goal Pursuit is\ngoing to involve errors it's it's going\nto involve failures it's going to\ninvolve frustration it's going to\ninvolve anxiety all of those states of\nMind and Body in fact shift the brain\ninto modes of so-called neuroplasticity\nthey give it the ability to change and\nthat should make perfect sense because\nif you can complete what you need to do\neasily there's absolutely no reason for\nthe neural circuitry in your brain or\nbody to shift in any way why would it\nrather those states of discomfort\nfrustration anxiety Etc\nrepresent shifts in neurochemical states\nthat literally open the opportunity for\nneuroplasticity to occur the changes\nbetween neurons that allow those neurons\nand their Associated neural circuits to\nperform differently in the future when\nwe learn something so the key here is\ntwofold first Define the specific\npriority goal that you're going to\npursue and set aside all other goal\nPursuits and in doing that it makes\nsense to pursue a somewhat loftier goal\nthan perhaps a more mundane goal or if\nyou know exactly what goal you're going\nto prioritize that you try and Achieve\nperhaps more than you think you ought to\nbe able to achieve within that given\ngoal and within the goal that you decide\nto prioritize you want to set a level of\nprogress a level of performance that\nyou're striving to attain that's a bit\nabove what you actually believe at this\ntime you can accomplish now in doing so\nyou are inevitably going to encounter\nsome frustration and anxiety but\nremember the component of the neural\ncircuitry that we talked about at the\nbeginning of the episode the orbital\nfrontal cortex that orbital frontal\ncortex is not just part of a neural\ncircuitry that assesses how we feel in a\ngiven moment as we are trying to pursue\na goal but it also understands context\nit has the capacity to for instance see\nthat you are experiencing anxiety know\nthat you are frustrated but now that you\nunderstand that anxiety and frustration\nthat comes with making errors is\nactually the Gateway it's a necessary\ngateway to achieving neural circuit\nchanges so-call\nneuroplasticity well the orbital frontal\ncortex understands that context it\nliterally can take information about\nneuroplasticity it can take information\nabout frustration which you now have and\nit can combine those such that when you\nexperience that frustration you\nexperience those errors and you\npreviously would have wanted to quit now\nyou know that you are literally making\nprogress you're literally shifting those\nneural circuits in the direction of\nimproved learning now it's also\nimportant to remind that neuroplasticity\nthe changes in neural circuits that\nallow for improved performance in the\nfuture does not occur instantaneously\nthat frustration that occurs during our\nattempts to learn or to pursue a goal is\nthe trigger for neuroplasticity the\nactual rewiring of neural circuits that\nallows for proficient correct\nperformance occurs during deep sleep and\nother forms of deep rest this is\nsomething I've covered extensively in\nepisodes on neuroplasticity and learning\nand if you you'd like to learn more\nabout neuroplasticity in fact if you'd\nlike a zeroc cost toolkit that defines\nthe so-called super protocol for\nneuroplasticity and learning that is not\njust nested within the context of goal\nPursuit and learning we have that you\ncan go to hubman lab.com you go to the\nmenu go scroll down to newsletter and\nyou can sign up it's completely zero\ncost and you'll get that as a brief I\nbelieve it's a two or maybe three page\nPDF okay so returning to goal setting\nand pursuit first you need to set your\ngoal you really should take the time\nrequired to Define your priority what\nare you going to try and learn and then\nyou're going to pick a goal that really\nfeels challenging that feels like it\nmight even be Out Of Reach because that\nwill recruit the neural circuits\nassociated with arousal they're\nmotivating enough to get you into action\nnow I want to be very clear I'm not\nsuggesting that you pick a goal that's\nimpossible to achieve or that you\nbelieve is impossible to achieve that's\nnot going to serve you well rather I'm\nsaying pick a goal that feels just a bit\nOut Of Reach and don't obsess too much\nabout whether or not it's a lot out of\nreach or a little bit Out Of Reach pick\nsomething you're excited to pursue that\nyou would really like to accomplish set\nthat goal and then just set aside all\nother goals still of course maintain or\nimprove other aspects of your life that\nare necessary for daily living for\nmental health physical health Etc but\nreally just focus on one goal I promise\nthat you will be far more satisfied with\nthe results if you can truly set a\npriority so once you've defined the\nspecific goal that you are going to\nprioritize there are two more things\nthings that you need to do before you\nstart to pursue that goal the first one\nis that you need to define the specific\nverbs the actions that are involved in\npursuing that goal this is absolutely\ncritical a lot of people will set a sort\nof title goal or a goal State they'll\nsay oh you know I want to be rich or I\nwant to be smart or they will say I want\nto be fit or proficient in a given\nlanguage it's really important that you\nput additional specificity on your goal\nin fact it's important that you put a\nlot of specificity on your goal and that\nyou focus mainly on verbs when defining\nthat specificity now there are a lot of\nreasons for this that have to do both\nwith increasing the probability that you\nwill achieve your goal as well as\nmaintaining motivation as you pursue\nthat goal so for instance rather than\nsaying you want to be fit or you want to\nbe a better Runner or swimmer you would\nwant to get very specific about the verb\nthat you're going to engage in order to\nachieve that goal now it's somewhat\nobvious in the case of running or\nswimming I think everyone understands\nthat if you want to be a better Runner\nthere is going to be some running\ninvolved if you want to be a better\nswimmer there's going to be some\nswimming involved of course but\npresumably there will be some other\nbehaviors as well everything from\ndriving to the pool or lacing up your\nshoes I mean there's an essentially near\ninfinite number of verbs involved in any\ntype of goal Pursuit so what we are\ntalking about here is really defining\nthe goal on a piece of paper and I do\nthink that's important you should write\nthis down and I think the process of\nselecting your goal that priority as\nwell as defining the specificity of the\nverb action that you're going to pursue\nshould be done on paper you of course\nare going to think but then you should\nwrite it out seeing things on paper and\nwriting them out by hand with pen or\npencil really has been shown to engage\nneural circuitry in a way that is\ndifferent than typing with your thumbs\ninto your phone which by the way is a\nnew feature of human evolution I do\nbelieve this is the first time in human\nevolution that we have written with our\nthumbs I don't know I don't have a time\nmachine I can't go back and check but\nI'm willing to place a bet that that\nstatement is correct so the point is\nthat writing things out is not only\nimportant it's also the most effective\nway to embed knowledge in our nervous\nsystem so I highly recommend that you\nwrite things out on a piece of paper in\nyour process of goal setting so when we\nare talking about generating verb\nspecificity about your goal it would\nlook like the following so let's say I\nwant to to quote unquote get more fit or\nlearn conversational French or anything\nfor that matter gardening maybe I want\nto build a gazebo in the backyard or a\ndeck in the backyard the key thing to\nanswer is what is the major block of\naction that's going to be involved in\npursuing that goal so for instance if\nyou want to get more fit and you're\ngoing to do that primarily through\nrunning and weight training or swimming\nand weight training you would want to\nget very specific in defining that\npriority goal as I'm going to run X\nnumber of miles per week or I'm going to\ngo to the gym three times per week to\nlift weights although I would recommend\ngetting even more specific than that I\nwould recommend that you literally write\ndown I'm going to go to the gym three\ntimes per week for a minimum of 60\nminutes where 50 minutes of that are\ncarrying out hard work okay with of\ncourse rest between sets Etc or I'm\ngoing to attend three classes per week\nor perhaps even just one class per week\nof learning conversational French plus\nI'm going to spend two hours per week of\npracticing say word problems or\nmathematical problems whatever it is you\nwant to Define first the priority then\nyou want to define the verb action that\nrepresents the bulk of effort towards\nthat priority so running in the case of\nthe person who wants to get fit by\nrunning weightlifting in the case of the\nperson that wants to get fit by\nweightlifting though of course I highly\nrecommend people do both resistance\ntraining and uh cardiovascular training\nif indeed they want to be truly fit or\nin the case of language learning or\nlearning how to code or gardening or\nsomething of that sort to really Define\nthe verb actions involved and then to\nplace specificity in terms of the amount\nof time that one is going to try to\nachieve each week in pursuit of that\nspecific priority goal now I realize\nthat that process itself takes a bit of\ntime but when you look back on the\n100-year plus scientific literature of\nwhat leads to success uccessful goal\nsetting and pursuit you find over and\nover again that those two components\nwe've been talking about specificity and\nmeasurability are Paramount you just\nsimply cannot discard those from the\nprocess if you expect yourself to\nachieve your goals so whether or not\nit's the ABC method or it's the smart\nmethod or the smarter method again all\nacronyms coined not by me but by others\nprevious to this conversation you're\ngoing to find elements of specificity\nand measurability showing up again and\nagain so these are key features of any\nprotocol that you are going to use in\norder to try and set and achieve your\ngoals and I should mention that setting\nspecific goals and clearly defining the\nverbs that you're are going to engage in\nto pursue those goals and defining how\nlong you are going to try and engage in\nthose verbs each week to achieve those\ngoals has significant impact on the\nprobability of success we're not talking\nabout a minor effect in fact in the\noriginal episode I did about goal\nsetting and pursuit I talked about the\nso-called recycling study I'm not going\nto describe it in a lot of detail right\nnow but essentially this study looked at\nmotivating people to recycle more\nrecyclable products in the workplace and\nwhat they found was that when people\nwere told what the specific goal was and\nwhat specific actions they needed to\nengage in were and how much of a given\nbatch of refu so say you know after\nlunch there's some boxes or some Forks\nEtc some napkins how much of that refu\nthey were going to try to put into the\nrecycle versus the trash it led to a\ngreater than doubling of successful\nachievement of that goal now that's a\nperhaps trivial goal to some of you\nalthough let's face it recycling is\nimportant but that result has been shown\nagain and again and again for different\ndomains of goal setting and pursuit so\nthis thing of setting specificity really\nspending time with it on paper setting\nspecificity of actions of which specific\nactions and then setting specificity of\nhow long you are going to engage in each\nof those actions each week greatly\nincreases the probability that you will\nachieve that what previously seemed to\nbe a all too lofty goal earlier I\nmentioned that during the course of\ntoday's episode we were going to dispel\nsome common myths about goal setting and\npursuit so now I'd like to mention two\npopular myths about goal setting and\npursuit the first one is that if we set\na Post-It you know a little Post-it\nsticky where you write down what you're\ntrying to achieve and you put that on\nthe refrigerator or you put that on your\nmirror that it increases the probability\nthat you are going to stick to your goal\nturns out that is not the case and the\nreason for that is that your visual\nsystem adapts to whatever is regular in\nyour environment doesn't matter whether\nor not that environment is sparse so it\nonly has a few things in it or whether\nor not it is dense like a forest\nanything that shows up regularly in our\nvisual environment gets canceled out\nthis is actually a basic feature of the\nway your visual system is wired so for\nthose of you that are taking a sticky\nnote or a magnet or a sign and putting\nit on your mirror and leaving it there\nfrom day to day maybe that says you know\nrun 60 minutes today or study French 20\nminutes or whatever the goal happens to\nbe if you leave it there day today today\nit actually diminishes the likelihood of\nprogress I know that seems kind of hard\nto believe but it's true instead a\nbetter approach is is to continually\nwrite that thing out each day and put up\na new sticky put it in a new place\nperhaps on the refrigerator sometimes in\nthe kitchen maybe on the windshield of\nyour car although of course remove that\nwhile you're driving Etc if you are\ngoing to incorporate visual reminders in\nyour goal setting and goal Pursuit\nprocess you want to change those each\nand every day this is actually something\nthat uh perhaps app developers will\nstart to incorporate because I think the\nnotifications that come through on\nvarious apps designed to remind us to do\ncertain things can be helpful but there\ntoo we tend to attenuate to them and we\nsimply either do not notice them or we\nstart to swipe them away over time so\nvisual reminders can be very effective\nif you want to use them great you\ncertainly don't have to but if you're\ngoing to use them you want to update\nthem every single day otherwise your\nvisual system and certainly the areas of\nyour brain that are associated with\nassessing novelty and emotionality will\nsimply start to cancel those away so the\nfirst common myth that we're dispelling\nis what I call the poit fallacy the the\nidea that if you write something down on\na Post-It and you post it in an area\nthat you frequent every morning or every\nday or every night that you stand a\nhigher probability of adhering to what\nis on that Post-it that is simply not\ntrue you would want to replace it every\nday and you would also be wise to move\nthat Post-it to different locations the\nsecond myth is that if you want to\nincrease your motivation toward pursuing\na goal and you want to increase the\nprobability that you will achieve that\ngoal that you should engage in so-called\naccountability meaning that you should\ntell people you are going to achieve\nthat goal now I realize that there are\nsome prominent examples in pop culture\nof people posting something on social\nmedia and saying you know in three years\nI'm going to be you know playing in\nWembley Stadium or in two years watch\nI'm going to be at the top level of my\ngame whatever that game happens to be\nsure there are examples of that and\nthose are beautiful and inspiring\nexamples however the scientific data\ntell us that if we inform people around\nus that for instance we are going to\nwrite a book or that we're going to\nstart a podcast or that we are going to\nrun a marathon or whatever it happens to\nbe more often than not we get feedback\nthat is generally positive inform I\nthink that's good and to be expected\nfrankly you know if a friend tells us\nhey I'm going to write a book or I'm\ngoing to pursue a new fitness goal or\nI'm going to learn a language we say\ngreat go for it you can totally do it\nyou're very likely to succeed go for it\nhow do you want me to support you as a\nthere anything I can do to support you\nthose all are frankly healthy exchanges\nand yet the data tell us that the\npositive feedback that we get from\nothers when we announce that we're going\nafter a goal activate certain reward\nsystems and motivation systems within\nour brain that then quickly dissipate\nand then diminish the probability that\nwe'll engage in the type of behaviors\nthat actually lead us to achieve that\ngoal so we have the posit fallacy and we\nhave the myth of accountability fallacy\nwithin the context of goal Pursuit I of\ncourse am not saying that accountability\nis bad to the contrary accountability is\na great thing both to ourselves and to\nothers it's something that we should all\ncultivate throughout life I'm merely\ntalking about the myth of accountability\nin the context of goal Pursuit and I'm\nactually being more specific than that\nI'm saying don't tell people that you're\ngoing to go out and Achieve something\nprior to initiating action toward that\ngoal because in fact the positive\nfeedback that we get will diminish the\nprobability that we will continually\npursue that goal in a way that allows us\nto achieve it so you could interpret the\ninformation I just gave you as meaning\nthat perhaps it's better to tell someone\nwho doubts us that we are going to\nachieve a goal and then of course\nthey're not going to give us the\npositive feedback we're not going to get\nall that reward circuitry activated\nrather we're going to get the uh\nfriction circuitry activated of us\nwanting to prove ourselves and overcome\nthe uh let's just say the lack of faith\nin our ability to achieve a goal and\nindeed that can work there is evidence\nthat can work but then of course you\nhave to find someone who doesn't believe\nin you you have to get them to tell you\nthey don't believe in you and that could\nhave all sorts of delerious\npsychological effects that might\nundermine the goal Pursuit process and\nother things as well so if you are lucky\nenough to know somebody who doubts you\ngo ahead tell them that you want to\npursue your specific priority goal but\nmore likely than not the best thing to\ndo is to Simply keep that goal to\nyourself you may need to inform a family\nmember or others of you know where you\nwill be between the hours of say 8:00\na.m. and 9:00 a.m. if you're going to be\nexercising or learning language or\nmeditating whatever it is during that\nperiod of time but what I'm referring to\nhere is what I will call the don't tell\nthe world rule don't tell the world that\nyou're going to achieve X Y or Z just\nsimply tell yourself in fact I would\nsuggest that the more time you can spend\nwith that one or two or three sheets of\npaper where you defined the goal the\nspecific actions that you're going to\ntake how you're going to measure\nprogress which we'll talk about bit more\nlater the more time that you can spend\nwith that goal in your mind and on that\npaper the higher the probability that\nyou will achieve that goal that stands\nin start contrast to telling everyone\naround you that you're going to achieve\na certain goal the so-called\naccountability myth or the myth of\naccountability within the context of\ngoal Pursuit would be the more specific\nway uh to describe that myth now it\nturns out there is some utility to\nhaving one person that is a so-called\naccountability buddy if that person is\nreally just L addressing accountability\nthey are reminding you to do what you\nneed to do or they are asking you did\nyou do what you said you were going to\ndo but that's a bit more of a tough love\naccountability model what the don't tell\nthe world rule is really about is not\ngetting the kind of dopamine and other\nforms of neurochemical reward that come\nfrom just simply saying that you're\ngoing to pursue a goal because as you'll\nsoon learn that dopamine and other\nmolecules too of course are going to be\ncritically important not just for\ninitiating the sorts of actions re IR\nired to achieve your goals but for\nre-engaging and constantly updating your\nstrategy to ensure that you reach your\ngoals it's worth mentioning that the\nfriction model of achieving your goals\ndoes work I mean I for instance am\nsomebody that if you know I were to say\nto a family member or friend hey I'm\ngoing to achieve a particular goal and\nthey said no there's no way you can do\nit that would recruit a certain set of\nneural circuits and uh hormones and\nneurochemicals in me that would make me\nmuch more likely to lean into the\nrequired set of efforts to achieve that\ngoal but there's a danger in approaching\na given goal that way especially if the\ngoal is something that you already want\nto pursue which is that then a lot of\nyour effort becomes framed in the\ncontext of making someone else wrong as\nopposed to achieving the goal and of\ncourse you can do two things in parallel\nyou can achieve your goal and prove\nsomebody else wrong but as we've talked\nabout in various episodes on motivation\nand pursuit and the dopamine system and\nas we'll talk about a bit more in a few\nminutes the there something tremendously\npowerful about learning how to derive\npleasure from the effort process itself\nthat is learning to enjoy the process of\npursuing a goal for sake of that goal\nfor yourself rather than trying to\npursue a goal simply to prove somebody\nelse wrong I'll just tell you right now\nthat intrinsic motivation motivation\nthat is directly attached to the thing\nthat you are doing and root to a goal is\nthe most powerful and sustainable source\nof motivation\nas many of you know I've been taking ag1\ndaily since 2012 so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that's\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutrition needs now of\ncourse I try to get enough servings of\nvitamins and minerals through whole food\nsources that include vegetables and\nfruits every day but often times I\nsimply can't get enough servings but\nwith ag1 I'm sure to get enough vitamins\nand minerals and the probiotics that I\nneed and it also contains adaptogens to\nhelp buffer stress simply put always\nfeel better when I take ag1 I have more\nfocus and energy and I sleep better and\nit also happens to taste great for all\nthese reasons whenever I'm asked if you\ncould take Just One supplement what\nwould it be I answer ag1 if you'd like\nto try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman\nto claim a special offer they'll give\nyou five free travel packs plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's\ndrink a1.com\nhuberman the final protocol related to\ngoal setting because because really up\nuntil now we've been talking only about\ngoal setting we haven't yet talked about\ngoal Pursuit is that you want your goal\nto be measurable and when we say\nmeasurable you really have to Define two\nthings first of all you are going to\nhave to Define how long you are going to\npursue this goal overall in other words\nhow long you think it will take before\nyou achieve your goal and in addition to\nthat you are going to have to Define how\nmuch time you are going to spend\npursuing that goal each week or each day\nnow there are an infinite number of time\nblocks that one could use to answer\nthese questions so for instance you\ncould set an overall yearly goal and you\ncould break it down into monthly goals\nwhere you spend x amount of time on that\ngoal each week and x amount of time on\nthat goal each day and essentially\nladder up from the shortest time frame\nto the longest time frame required to\nachieve that goal and certainly all of\nthat is doable but that I believe is\ngoing to be an overwhelming amount of\nwork and indeed is going to be\ncounterproductive toward achieving your\ngoal what I recommend which of course is\ngleaned from the scientific literature\nat least the consistencies or the center\nof mass that is the major findings that\nshow up again and again in the\nscientific literature on goal setting a\nPursuit is that you establish a roughly\n12 week period of time to focus on your\nspecific goal now of course achieving\nthe entire goal might take longer than\n12 weeks but chances are it's not going\nto take shorter than 12 weeks although\nif it does you could simply close out\nthat goal Pursuit and then pursue\nanother goal there's no reason you\ncouldn't do that but there's nothing\nmagical about this 12-week period but it\nseems to adhere to a number of things in\nsociety and culture in work schedules in\nseasonality meaning the holidays and the\nshifts in the overall Seasons that works\nfor most goals and most people so a\n12-week cycle or roughly a thre month\ncycle sometimes called the quarterly\ncycle of goal Pursuit toward your\nparticular goal I think is a good macro\ntime to focus on and then within that\n12we cycle to Define very clearly how\nmany hours each week and each day and on\nwhich days you will pursue that goal\nokay so it's 12-week cycle to pursue\nyour goal that goal might be achieved by\nthe end of that 12 weeks or even prior\nit might not be but you said a 12we\ncycle or quarterly cycle or if you\nprefer to think about it a 3 month cycle\nand then you define how many hours per\nweek you are going to spend pursuing\nthat goal and then you define how many\nhours per day you are going to spend\npursuing that goal and then you define\nwhich days of the week you are going to\npursue that particular goal I think\nthose three numbers the 12-week\nquarterly AKA 3-mth cycle the number of\nhours per week and the number of hours\nper day and particular days that you're\ngoing to spend working on a goal is\ngoing to be effective for 90% if not\nmore of different types of goals out\nthere and as with defining the specific\ngoal itself I highly recommend that you\nwrite this down with a pen or pencil\nthere's just oh so much data to support\nthe fact that writing things down\nideally in complete sentences on a piece\nof paper with a pen or pencil serves to\nreinforce the goal setting and pursuit\nprocess greatly increasing the\nprobability that you will achieve those\ngoals so what you're really defining in\nthat process are the specific verb\naction that you are going to take and\nthe specific quantifiable amount of time\nthat you are engaging in those verb\nactions in order to achieve your goal\nwhat we haven't discussed yet however is\nhow to define or quantify the goal\nitself now of course in different\nEndeavors you're going to have the\nopportunity to quantify and Define goal\nachievement in different ways so for\ninstance if you want to be able to run a\nsub six-minute mile or a sub five minute\nmile\nor if you're really impressive a sub\nfour minute mile well that's a highly\nquantifiable goal that you can break\ndown into a series of training steps or\nMilestones meaning that you could\nquantify at the beginning of your goal\nPursuit how long it takes you to run a\nmile you could then set out to achieve a\nfaster time within two weeks or three\nweeks and then do the appropriate\ntraining to achieve those numbers and\nsimply keep updating that in order to\neventually reach your quantifiable goal\nat 12 weeks again you might not complete\nyour goal of running a sub five minute\nmile or sub six minute mile at the end\nof 12 weeks but perhaps if your goal is\nto be able to run a sub five minute mile\nby the end of the calendar year and\nyou're initiating this whole goal\nPursuit thing on the first of the year\nwell then you have 12 months broken into\nfour 3month cycles and you would\nessentially set the quantifiable goal at\nthe end of the year December 31st\nperhaps is when you actually do that run\num where you hopefully would achieve\nthat sub 6 minute or 5 minute mile or\nmaybe even 4 minute mile and then you\nbacktrack from that date and you set\nMilestones of goals that you're trying\nto achieve that's a highly quantifiable\nset of goals because it is literally\ndistance Over time however in a lot of\nPursuits in fact I would argue in most\nPursuits you don't have that very clear\nquantifiable result you might have for\ninstance the achievement of a doctoral\ndegree or a bachelor's degree or an AA\ndegree or a professional degree of some\nsort which represents a Finish Line um\nyou could perhaps even attach a gray\npoint average or a publication goal to\nthat but in most Endeavors that aren't\nathletic or aren't within the realm of\nFinance it becomes much harder to very\nclearly Define your goal in purely\nquantitative terms so that is the reason\nwhy we spent so much time talking about\nthe measurability of the specific amount\nof time that you're going to engage in\nthe verb actions that each day which\ndays each week over the course of these\n12we Cycles because ultimately what's\ngoing to allow you to arrive at\nsuccessful achievement of your goal\nregardless of whether or not that goal\nis highly quantifiable X number of\ndollars X number of minutes to complete\na mile run or Swim\nEtc or it's something that's a bit more\nnebulous in terms of quantifiability\nlike conversational French right there's\nconversational French that you can learn\nthere's also conversational French that\nincorporates humor or that incorporates\nGood Humor or um perhaps you want to get\nbetter at writing poetry or simply spend\ntime writing poetry can you quantify the\nquality of that poetry well perhaps uh\nyou know if you could win a particular\nprize for poetry but I think for most\nEndeavors they are more Loosely defined\nin terms of their quantifiability now we\ncan always attach quantifiability to the\nultimate end goal if we choose so for\ninstance\nI could decide that I'm going to learn\nconversational French and I could decide\nthat the ultimate goal at the end of\nthis 12we period is to be able to have a\n10-minute conversation with somebody who\nis fluent in French they're native born\nin France and that I'm going to make\nzero mistakes that's a pretty lofty goal\nbut the point being that if you are\npicking a goal that is not easily\nquantifiable you want to be\nexceptionally precise about the amount\nof time that you are going to spend in\nengaging in the specific verb actions\nthat are going to allow you to make\nprogress toward your goal because\nultimately whether or not it's a highly\nquantifiable goal or it's a more Loosely\nquantifiable goal in terms of the end\ngoal the process of achieving goals is\nalways going to be in the form of\nactions and actions themselves are\nalways quantifiable it's number of hours\nof dedicated work toward that particular\ngoal a common example of an end goal\nthat's very hard to quantify in terms of\nthe end goal itself is the writing of a\nbook book for instance now you could set\nout to write an 800 page book but most\npeople agree that the length of the book\nshould have something more or less to do\nwith the content and not the other way\naround in other words that you don't\njust want to add words in order to\nachieve a certain number of pages that\nsaid most all experienced writers will\ntell you at least two things they'll\ntell you first don't wait for\ninspiration simply set a period of time\neach day that you're going to write and\nwrite X number of words or for x amount\nof time each each day or perhaps even\njust three days a week but most of the\nexperienced writers that I've spoken to\nwrite every single day and they write\n800 words per day or 2,000 words per day\nor 500 words per day whatever they can\ndo consistently they may do it for time\nthey may do it for words but they are\nwriting during that time they are not\nwaiting for inspiration to land on them\nthey're not trying to get optimally\ncaffeinated and perhaps they didn't even\nsleep that well the night before in\nother words they are dedicated to\nengaging in a particular number of hours\nof word generating action rather than\ntrying to focus on getting the number\none best seller at the end after the\nbook is published of course they can\nwish for that number one position on the\nbestseller chart But ultimately the\ngreatest probability of achieving that\ngoal is going to come from engaging in a\nparticular number of hours generating a\nparticular number of words each day so\nagain the highest probability of\nachieving our goals of achieving any\nkind of goal is going to be by\nunderstanding the specific verb actions\nthat we need to engage in and then\nquantifying the amount of time that we\nengage in those specific word actions\nand then simply doing those verbs so up\nuntil now we've been talking about goal\nsetting and we really haven't talked\nabout goal Pursuit itself so now I'd\nlike to talk about what the scientific\nliterature says is the best protocol for\ninitiating our goal Pursuit for starting\ntoward our goal and to do so we have to\naddress a set of key questions the\nquestions you have to ask yourself are\ndo I do I want to pursue this goal\nmeaning am I highly motivated to pursue\nthis goal or even mildly motivated to\npursue this goal do I want to do the\nthings involved to get this thing to\naccomplish this thing or am I feeling\nresistance do I not want to pursue this\ngoal or perhaps this is a daytoday shift\nthat occurs where some days you're\nreally motivated and other days you are\nnot now the reason to ask yourself the\nset of questions is that the data say\nthat there are two different strategies\nin fact two markedly different\nstrategies that you'll want to\nincorporate depending on whether or not\nyou're motivated or you are unmotivated\nto pursue that particular goal for\nwhatever reason and of course there's an\nentire psychology to motivation and you\ncould get a therapist or a coach to work\nwith in order to address that underlying\npsychology yes it might ladder back to\nChildhood issues it might ladder back to\nesteem things none of that can be\ncovered here in any sort of meaningful\ndepth because frankly we each have\ndifferent circumstances different pasts\ndifferent psychologies there are however\nsome universals that we can all apply in\norder to help us get started toward our\ngoal and this is nested in this whole\nconcept of whether or not we should\nvisualize the end and successful\ncompletion of our goal so keep the end\nin mind as we start off toward a goal or\nwhether or not we should incorporate a\ndifferent strategy here's how it goes so\nif you ask\nyourself do I want to achieve this goal\nand I would hope the answer is yes\nbecause the overall goal should be\nsomething that you want to pursue it\nshould be something that you are deeply\nDesiring to accomplish then you have to\nask yourself next do I want to do the\nthings required to achieve that goal now\nmaybe you don't want to do all of them\nyou only want to do some of them but\ngiven that you've now carefully\nQuantified which specific actions you're\ngoing to be doing on which days and for\nhow many hours and how many weeks for\nthese 12we blocks you could simply ask\nyourself you do I want to do this thing\ntoday and if the answer is yes well then\nit turns out that spending just one to\nthree maybe five minutes but even just\none minute visualizing the outcome the\npositive outcome of course and the\nfeeling state that you may have because\nof course you don't know you don't have\na uh time machine you can't feel\nyourself into the future but you can\nmake a good guess as to how you might\nfeel in the future if you accomplish\nthat goal spending one to three maybe\nfive minutes in a sort of meditation\nalthough sort of a visualiz a is perhaps\nthe better way to describe it thinking\nabout that feeling State and the outcome\nand some of the things that are going to\nbe associated with that outcome turns\nout to be a great practice to engage in\njust prior to initiating that day's work\ntoward that goal however if you arrive\nto your practice meaning you show up to\nthe piano to learn piano or you're\nsitting down to the table or maybe you\nhaven't even gotten enough motivation to\ngo toward the piano or toward your\nnotebook or computer or whatever\nlandscape it is that you are going to be\nuh pursuing your goal with in and you\nare having quote unquote a hard time\ngetting motivated toward that goal well\nthen it turns out what the scientific\nliterature tells us is that visualizing\nthe end keeping the end in mind positive\nvisualization of all the good things\nthat you'll experience when you achieve\nthat goal is not going to be an\neffective strategy to motivate you\nrather if you are not feeling motivated\nthen what the scientific literature\ntells us is that you actually want to\nspend one to three maybe 5 minutes\nvisualizing failure visualizing how\nterrible you will feel if you do not\nachieve your goal visualizing severe\nconsequences perhaps mostly of the sort\nlike telling yourself gosh I set a goal\nI set a 12we block I quantify it I know\nI want to do this here I have the time\nto do it and I'm simply just not doing\nit and in that case you would think okay\nwell you should kind of build yourself\nup maybe call a friend text a friend get\nsome encouragement no the scientific\nliterat tells us that when we are not\nmotivated and it is a goal that we\nactually want to pursue and of course\nhere I'm talking about adaptive goal\nPursuit meaning things that are going to\nenrich your mental health physical\nhealth Etc not things that are going to\nbe detrimental to us well then if you're\nnot feeling motivated you want to spend\none to three perhaps five minutes\nmeditating concentrating on what it's\ngoing to feel like to fail and the fact\nthat you are not succeeding but indeed\nthat you are failing and I I know this\nsounds like rather harsh advice that\nthis protocol uh sounds like kind of a\nself- flatulating protocol it's not\nintended to be self flatulation in fact\nit should not be self flatulation but\nrather what you want to do when you are\nnot motivated is to think about failure\nand what that failure at the end of 12\nweeks will feel like and the reason for\nthat is that the data tell us that when\nwe visualize positive outcomes yes it\ndeploys certain neurochemicals in our\nbrain and body that make us feel good\nalthough frankly if you've heard that\nimagining something creates the same\nneurochemical and neuros circuit states\nin the brain as actually experiencing\nthat thing that is simply not true\nthat's a myth we've talked about this in\nprevious episodes that's simply not true\nbut if you are having a hard time\ngetting motivated toward a goal that you\nactually want to achieve then spending\nthat short amount of time thinking about\nhow lousy you'll feel when you don't\nachieve it recruits certain elements of\nyour so-called autonomic nervous system\nit creates shifts in the release of\nthings like epinephrine norepinephrine\neven release of the so-called reward\nmolecule dopamine which in fact is not\nthe molecule of reward it is the\nmolecule of motivation and it's\nassociated with pain It's associated\nwith negative thoughts and of course\nit's associated with positive thoughts\nand outcomes but basically what I'm\nsaying is if you're highly motivated to\ndo something you're ready to go spend\none to three minutes maybe five\nvisualizing the positive outcomes that\nyou're going to EXP experience when you\nultimately finish out that 12 we cycle\nas a consequence of all the great work\nthat you've done if however you are not\nmotivated you're feeling like I don't\nwant to do this thing I'm\nprocrastinating I'm just not feeling\nlike doing it yes I want to achieve the\ngoal but I just don't feel like doing it\nwell then your task is to take one to\nthree maybe five minutes and think about\nhow much more lousy you will feel when\nyou do not achieve that goal at the end\nof 12 weeks and that the data tell us\nrecruit certain elements of your nervous\nsystem your hormonal system that are\nmore successful in getting you into\naction into starting toward your goal\nthan were you to try and build yourself\nup towards all that positivity so yes\nindeed there is a place for negative\nthinking I'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge our sponsor inside\ntracker inside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and

Pursuit process we need to\nthink about the specific time domain or\nthe amount of time that we're trying to\ndo that within so for instance there are\ntools that you can use to stay motivated\nwithin the 1hour learning block that you\nhappen to be doing on Monday morning for\ninstance and there are other tools and\nprotocols that you can incorporate\ntowards staying motivated from one day\nto the next or from one week to the next\nbut I think the most useful of those\ntools are going to be the tools that you\nincorporate to stay motivated within a\ngiven training block or practice block\ntoward your goal because what I just\ndescribed a few minutes ago was the\nprocess of how to initiate your daily\nwork right you ask yourself that\nquestion am I motivated the answer could\nbe yes could be no if you really want to\nget you know uh quantitative about it\nyou could give yourself a 1 to 10 score\n10 being the most motivated frankly I'm\nnot that quantitative about that sort of\nthing I'm more subjective about it but I\nknow some of you are real um number\njunkies and you really like to quantify\neverything keep a journal and look back\nsee how that relates to your sleep you\nknow some people are of that orientation\nother people like myself are simply\ngoing to you know sit down and say okay\nit's time it's time to train or it's\ntime to practice whatever the thing may\nbe how motivated am I am I a I don't\nknow like a six out of 10 or a seven out\nof 10 okay I'm ready to go I'm going to\nvisualize the end in mind in a positive\nway or if I'm a two out of 10 or\nanything less than a four out of 10 I'm\nthinking I'm not that motivated so then\nI'm going to basically scare myself into\ndoing the work that day so that's how\nyou initiate the work each day and I\njust gave you a couple of quick examples\nof how you could quantify that took me\nabout 30 seconds to do that example out\nloud take you about 30 seconds to do but\nagain if you want to quantify it in more\ndetail and write it down and relate it\nto other things be my guest so now you\nalready have a science based protocol\nfor how to get started each day toward\nyour goal now what about within the one\nor twoh hour block or perhaps 90-minute\nblock that you're going to use to pursue\nyour goal and here it's very important\nthat you have a number of tools that\nwill allow you to both set the optimal\namount of focus so that you're really\nconcentrating on pursuing that goal\nyou're concentrated on the verb actions\nthat will deliver you to that goal is\nperhaps the best way to state that and\nthat you can constantly update or renew\nyour level of focus should it start to\ndissipate now I want to be clear I've\ndone entire episodes about focus and how\nto increase focus with behavioral tools\neverything related to meditation which\nindeed can increase your ability to\nfocus I've talked about nutritional\ntools supplementation tools prescription\ndrug related tools there's a lot of\ninformation on that you can simply go to\nhubman lab.com put focus into the search\nfunction and it will take you to not\nonly those episodes and the toolkit for\nthat but the specific timestamps for\nthat but what we are going to talk about\nnow is not about how to increase Focus\nper se rather it's about how to use\nfocus in particular visual focus in\norder to increase your or maintain your\nlevel of motivation within a given\nlearning block within a given batch of\ntime on a given day where you are\npursuing your goal you're engaging in\nthat practice which of course will\ninclude frustration anxiety it has to if\nyou're going to get any better and how\nto set that motivation and keep that\nmotivation throughout that hour or 90\nminutes or two hours is critical so how\ndo you do that well it turns out it's\nfairly straightforward so it's anchored\nin the fact that your cognitive Focus\nyour ability to maintain a narrow cone\nof attention as well as your bodily\nstate of Readiness and your mental state\nof Readiness to perform work is\npowerfully anchored to your visual\nsystem as many of you have heard me say\nbefore your eyes are actually two pieces\nof brain I mean to be more specific the\nneural retinas that line the back of\nyour eyes like py crust are literally\ntwo pieces of your central nervous\nsystem of your brain that were extruded\nfrom the cranial Vault during\ndevelopment so yes these two bits and\nfor those listening I'm just pointing to\nmy eyes your eyes are two pieces of\nbrain outside of your skull and your\neyes can view things broadly so so you\ncan uh so-called soften your gaze and\nview the entire Horizon you can see the\nperiphery of the room by relaxing your\neyes you can actually do this now in\nfact when you drive most of the time\nyou're doing this you're not looking at\na particular focal point you're viewing\nthings in so-call panoramic vision and\nof course you can draw your visual Focus\nto a particular location what we call a\nvirgin eye movement that is you're\nbringing your eyes in toward the center\ntoward your nose a little bit and you're\nfocusing them in a more narrow cone of\nvisual attention this is something you\ncan do almost imperceptibly to others\nalthough if we were to measure your eye\nmovements what we would see is that your\neyes are actually moving inward a little\nbit toward your nose when you do this\nvirgin eye movement and narrowing that\ncone of visual attention and then\nthey're you relaxing into a state of um\nbeing slightly further out from your\nnose not the eyes themselves of course\nthey can't move within the sockets but\nyou know the pupils of your eyes are\nmoving out a bit from your nose and\nyou're in so-called panoramic Vision so\nessentially what I'm saying is that you\ncan narrow or broaden your visual\nattention and that's something that can\ntake a little bit of practice I highly\nrecommend that you try this and that you\npractice it a little bit but indeed\neveryone has the neural Machinery to do\nthis from birth this is not something\nthat requires neuroplasticity to be able\nto do you can do this right now you can\nnarrow your visual attention you can\nexpand or relax your visual attention\nand thereby narrow or relax your visual\nfield from being smaller or larger there\nare data that show that when we narrow\nour visual attention and we hold that\nnarrow visual tension on a spot several\nthings happen first of all there's\nrecruitment of circuitry within the\nso-called brain stem that then deploys\nneurochemicals that increase our level\nof alertness and arousal that's right\nwhen you focus your visual attension on\na more narrow location or one location\nin front of you and you hold that\nFocus you are causing the release of\nneurochemicals that increase your\noverall level of alertness in the brain\nbrain and body conversely when you relax\nyour visual Focus so-called panoramic\nVision you are turning off that\nrecruitment you're not actively\nrecruiting molecules for relaxation\nwithin the brain but you are turning off\nthis release of the neurochemicals\nassociated with increasing focus and\narousal so why am I talking about this\nin the context of goal Pursuit well if\nyou are feeling lack of motivation at\nany point within a given training block\nor bism calling it this could be at the\nbeginning this could be 5 minutes in\nthis could be half an hour in you would\nbe wise to pick a visual Target ideally\na visual Target that is within the\ngeneral range of the work that you're\ntrying to perform in other words if\nyou're doing desk work with a piece of\npaper you would draw that visual Target\non a piece of paper approximately the\nsame distance that you were reading or\nthat you were looking at music um you\ncan tell how little uh playing of piano\nI've done in my life but the point being\nthat you set the visual Target at a\napproximately the same distance that you\nwould be performing your particular work\nso if you're doing a sport the distance\nmight be some many meters off in the\ndistance whereas if you're doing desk\nwork of some kind then it might be much\ncloser and then you focus your eyes on\nthat location and you actively work to\nmaintain that Focus just like I'm doing\nnow into the camera for a given period\nof time and I recommend that you set a\ntimer and that you of course allow\nyourself to Blink like I just did there\nand that you try and Achieve at least 30\nseconds but even better would be 60\nseconds even better would be 90 seconds\nof that Focus virgin eye movement during\nwhich several things happen including\nthe deployment of those neurochemicals\nfrom the brain stem that I talked about\nbefore which are going to increase your\nlevel of autonomic arousal and also\nincrease your level of focus further and\nthere I'm not just talking about visual\nFocus I'm talking about cognitive focus\nit has also been shown that when we\nfocus on a particular point in the way\nthat I'm describing here that it\nincreases our so-called systolic blood\npressure as many of you know blood\npressure is always described to us as a\ngiven number over another number and the\nfirst number is the so-called systo or\nsystolic pressure which is the amount of\npressure your vascular system when the\nheart beats as the fluid of your blood\nis pumping through the arteries veins\nand capillaries of your system and then\nthe bottom number is the amount of\npressure within those arteries veins and\ncapillar iies in between heartbeat so\nit's the systolic over the diastolic and\nwhat we know is that visual focus and\nhere I'm still holding mine now on the\ncamera so for those of you listening I\nprobably blinked once or twice but I'm\nreally trying hard to maintain my focus\ndirectly within the camera this visual\nFocus increases the systolic blood\npressure it increases the deployment of\nthose neurochemicals from the brain stem\nand we know it also can recruit The\nLiberation of molecules such as dopamine\nand some Associated molecules elsewhere\nin the brain that together act in a\nsynergistic way to increase our level of\nfocus and motivation this is based again\non work describing the neural circuitry\nof what I'm describing here and work\nfrom Emily bis's lab which has shown\nthat if people focus on a Target on a\ngoal line literally a physical location\nwithin their environment and then they\ninitiate some work it could be physical\nwork or cognitive work not only do they\nexperience significantly decreased\nlevels of perceived effort while\nengaging in that work but they also\ncomplete that work in a significantly\nreduced amount of time meaning that\nwithin a given training bout or training\nblock you are able to get significantly\nmore work done and you perceive that as\nless effortful or requiring less effort\nthan had you not done this visual Focus\nnow I've been doing this for quite some\ntime now into the camera this is\nactually a practice that I've been doing\nfor well over a decade and it's actually\na practice that I use when I podcast or\nwhen I post on social media it's part of\nthe reason why I'm accused of being a\nnon- blinker quite often but I want to\nremind people that you are allowed to\nBlink don't let your eyes dry out it's\nperfectly fine to Blink it's not going\nto inhibit the effectiveness of this\nprotocol but I don't think I can really\noverstate how valuable this sort of\nprotocol is first of all it's completely\nbehavioral it costs nothing it's\ncompletely safe as long as you remember\nto Blink and it allows you to increase\nyour level of focus your level of\nmotivation and the sustainability of\nyour focus and motivation while in goal\nPursuit so it's a quite valuable\nprotocol to incorporate and it's\nsomething that you can do once for 30\nseconds and then lean into whatever it\nis your writing process your running\nprocess it's something that you could do\nrepeatedly throughout that learning bout\nand it's something that you can practice\noffline a little bit away from that\ntraining bout as a means to sort of\nlearn and get familiar with so that then\nyou can incorporate it very quickly and\nrepeatedly and with much more\nEffectiveness during these different\nlearning doubts again it's a highly\nvaluable tool that's ground grounded in\nneural circuitry grounded in\nneurochemistry and that Emily bis's lab\nhas shown in numerous domains physical\nPursuits cognitive Pursuits can really\nhelp people achieve their goals and to\nachieve them more easily or at least\nwith less perceived effort and more\nquickly now we can get a bit more\ngranular about the incorporation of this\ntool this protocol but before we do we\nshould acknowledge that all of the\nthings that lend themselves to improved\ncognitive focus and physical ability\nstill hold true right you still need to\nget good sleep as many nights of your\nlife as you possibly can you still need\nto eat properly you still need to try\nand limit your stress we have podcast\nepisodes related to all of those topics\nwe have toolkits available at zero cost\nrelated to all of those topics I'm not\nsaying that this visual Focus or visual\nTarget Training is the only tool that\nyou should incorporate it's a tool that\nyou want to superimpose on the\nfoundation of all the things that bring\nyou to your practice with the best\npossible cognition the best possible\nphysical Readiness and that when added\nto that Foundation of excellent sleep\nexcellent nutrition social connection\nsunlight in the morning Etc is going to\nincrease the probability that you're\ngoing to make those learning bouts as\neffective as possible now some of you\nmay be thinking elevating your blood\npressure is bad why would I want to\nelevate my blood pressure ah well it\nturns out that these increases in\nsystolic blood pressure achieved with\nthis visual Target Training or focusing\non a Finish Line for some period of time\nare transient and they are perfect ly\nsafe so essentially what it does is it\nboosts or bolsters the activity of the\nautonomic nervous system it kickstarts\nthe deployment of those chemicals and\nthose neural circuits that then allow\nyou to be motivated for some period of\ntime but then that is a transient\nincrease in autonomic rousel which is\nwhy perhaps every 20 minutes or perhaps\non the hour you might stop do a 30\nsecond or 60-second visual Target\nTraining and then lean back into your\nprocess of however you it is that you\nare pursuing your goal I should also\nmention that if your eyes are getting\ntired doing whatever goal Pursuit you\nhappen to be engaged in it's also a good\nidea to go into that panoramic Vision\nmode the easiest way to do that is to go\noutside or to be outside and to view a\nhorizon and not look at any one\nparticular point on the horizon but if\nyou're indoors as I am now you can also\njust relax your eyes you know you know\nblinking a few times and getting rid of\nthat virgin's eye movement and try and\nvisualize the corners of the room or the\nsides of the room rather the floor and\nthe ceiling all at once that's a good\nway to expl expl how to so-call relax\nyour eyes and take you out of that\nvirgin's eye movement and I say this\nbecause a lot of people will feel when\nthey're pursuing their goal that it's\nkind of fatiguing so you have to\nremember to Breathe Right you still want\nto breathe as you're pursuing your goal\nand you certainly want to be visually\nfocused on your goal so you're\ncognitively focused on your goal and\nyou're motivated but that from time to\ntime you also relax take a moment shake\nthings off look into your panoramic\nVision mode and then go back to your\nmode of goal Pursuit now there are a few\nother protocols that might seem Oho\nsimple but frankly are oh so effective\nthat I'd be remiss if I didn't mention\nthem the first of those is actually\nsomething that I'm borrowing from Tim\nFerris who did a post on Instagram which\nwe will link to which I think is just\nspectacular which is 30 things that he\nwished he had known when he was 20 and\nwhile the internet is choca block full\nof such lists that particular list is\ntruly impressive those are things that I\ntoo wish I had known when I was 20 but\nalso when I was 30 and 40 and so on but\none particular thing on that list of 30\nis particularly relevant now which is\nthat the best productivity app is\nalready on your phone which is to put\nyour phone into airplane mode or more\nideally and this is the one that I try\nmy best to incorporate to Simply turn\nthe phone off and remove it from my\nworkouts or my attempts to learn\nlanguage or my attempts to learn\nanything I realize that some people need\nto keep their phone with them for\nreasons related to communicating with\nfamily or uh co-workers Etc that's fine\nif you need your phone but to the extent\nthat you can remove yourself from\ndistractions that's certainly going to\nen enhance your ability to focus on what\nyou need to focus on in pursuing your\ngoals that sort of stands without saying\nit's kind of a duh and yet I think a lot\nof people are searching far and wide for\nthe productivity app for the secret hack\nfor the thing that's going to allow them\nto be Pro productive and oftentimes\nthere are DOs actions that we can take\nin order to become more productive we're\ntalking about some of those today we've\ntalked about those in other episodes but\nthere are of course important don't so\ndon't have your phone facing up with\nWi-Fi and Celler service on if you want\nto be productive at something that\ndoesn't evolve your phone ideally you'll\nturn it over you'll turn it off you'll\nget rid of it you'll put it in the Next\nRoom if you're like me you'll sometimes\nlock it in the car I think the most\nextreme that I've ever gone to ensure\nthat I didn't um engage with my phone\nduring goal Pursuit was during the early\ndays of having my laboratory and I was\nwriting multiple grants in parallel\nwhich is an immense amount of work I\nwould walk into the lab labatory in the\nmorning and I would hand a student or\npostto my phone and I'd say don't give\nthis back to me until 5:00 p.m. and if I\nask for it back if I even ask for it\nonce everyone in the lab gets\n$500 there were quite a few people in my\nlab and so it's a significant cost to\nthat and I must tell you there were\nnumerous times throughout the day when I\nimpulsively just thought okay I'm going\nneed my phone damn it I don't want to\nhave to do it and I also wanted to\ndemonstrate to them that I could create\nan incentive system whereby I could\nbasically Scruff myself into getting the\nwork done and indeed um much to their\ndismay I never once had to pay them out\nalthough when we got the grants and\nindeed even when we didn't get the\ngrants I did take them all to dinner now\nanother key protocol for maintaining\nmotivation while pursuing your goals\nstems from our understanding of the\ndopamine reward and motivation Pathways\ntopics for which I have done multiple\nindeed three podcast episodes previously\nand we can provide a link to all three\nof those as well as the toolkit that\nwe've published and that's available to\nyou at zero cost on our website about\nhow to regulate dopamine both Baseline\ndopamine stores and peaks in dopamine\nthere's a lot there to be understood and\nIncorporated because it has to do with\nvarious things not just in the realm of\ngoal Pursuit but also feelings of\nwell-being um staving off depression\nthings of that sort the dopamine system\nis linked to oh so many important\naspects of Life far too many than we\ncould discuss right now and we have\nthose previous episodes in which we do\ndiscuss all of that material nonetheless\nit is important to understand that\ndopamine is the molecule of motivation\nand to some extent reward but really\nmotivation and that if you want to\nmaintain consistent motivation during\nsay your individual bouts of work toward\nyour goals and from one bout to the next\nso not just within a session but from\nday to day across sessions and from week\nto week and indeed from 12we cycle to\n12we cycle if that's required and from\none goal that you set to the next goal\nthat you define and decide to pursue you\nwant to understand this particular\nfeature of dopamine which is that yes\ndopamine and its release is highly\nvaluable toward getting more motivated\nand feeling more motivated but that it\nhas certain properties related to things\nlike dopamine reward prediction error\nbaselines of dopamine\nEtc that make it the case that if you\nreward yourself every time you reach a\nmilestone say you finish out an hour or\ntwo hours of work so you treat yourself\nto something you reward yourself that\nyou are going to diminish both the\npotency of that reward and you are going\nto reduce your motivation over time that\nmight be surprising to you but if you\nwere to watch those episodes it would\nall become clear as to why that is the\ncase it is also true that if you were to\nonly reward yourself when you accomplish\nyour goal or perhaps more commonly if\nyou look at the accomplishment of your\ngoal as the only reward in the whole\nprocess of goal Pursuit and achievement\nthat is going to undermine your\nprobability of success as well rather\nthe best way to incorporate the\nmechanics of the dopamine system such\nthat you can achieve not just immediate\nmotivation but ongoing motivation is to\nincorporate what is referred to as\nrandom intermittent reinforcement which\nis what the casinos use to keep people\nplaying it simply\nmeans randomly reward yourself and\nrandomly don't reward yourself for\nsuccessful completion of Milestones\nthose Milestones could be within a bout\nof effort or it could be across bouts of\neffort so let's say you set out at the\nbeginning on your piece of paper to\nbasically let's say run or practice at\nsome cognitive Endeavor four hours total\nper week and you're going to do that\nMonday Wednesday Friday and Saturday\nshould you reward yourself at the end of\neach session should you reward yourself\nat the end of each week the answer is it\ndepends and it should depend in a random\nintermittent way so the simplest way to\ndo this is whenever you complete a\nmilestone could be at the end of a day\nyou did your one hour whatever it was\nthat you designated you were going to do\non that particular day should you reward\nyourself cognitively or with some\nphysical thing I don't know what that\nphysical thing might be but it I don't\nknow could be a meal could be a movie\ncould be something that you enjoy well\nthe answer is you should flip a coin and\nif it's heads yes reward yourself and if\nit's Tails don't it's that simple it is\nthat simple it should be 50/50\nprobability and it's random as to\nwhether or not you reward yourself now\nwith physical rewards like monetary\nRewards or food rewards or a movie or\nparticipating in something else that you\nenjoy it's a bit easier to define the\ncognitive rewarding of One's Own efforts\nis something that people really struggle\nto comprehend but what I'm not referring\nto when I say cognitive rewards is I'm\nnot referring to saying yes I'm the best\nand really trying to shower yourself\nwith internal praise and tell yourself\nthat you're the greatest thing that ever\nhappened simply because you performed\nthis learning bout what I'm simply\nreferring to is the kind of\ninternal dopamine reward that comes from\ntelling yourself like yes I'm making\nprogress I'm making progress I'm on the\npath I'm able to set a goal and achieve\na goal which might seem like a healthy\nthing to do psychologically and in fact\nit is it's great I think it's really\nimportant that people be able to\nself-reward themselves especially\nself-reward for verbs that put them in a\nmore adaptive stance in life that\nenhance their mental health physical\nhealth and performance and that of\ncourse also includes relationships we're\nnot just talking about solitary Pursuits\nhere we're talking about Pursuits that\nbring us into the world that allow us to\nlean into life with more Vigor and with\nmore Effectiveness not just to help\nourselves but to help others so what I'm\nreferring to is completing something and\ninternally patting yourself on the back\nfor having completed that thing thing\nthat is a good thing to do but if you\nwant to maintain ongoing motivation\nyou're not going to do that every time\nyou're not going to punish yourself but\nrather you finish out a bout of learning\nyou flip the coin let's say it lands\ntails on that day you simply shift into\nthe next thing you need to do that day\nnow it is not easy to suppress thoughts\nwe know this it's very hard to suppress\nnegative thoughts but it's still hard to\nsuppress positive thoughts so internally\nif you're glowing from the fact that you\nperformed well don't try and suppress\nthat that's okay but if you flip a Tails\nthen you don't want to actively engage\nin a self-reward process however if you\nflip the coin and it's heads well then\nyou should absolutely engage in a\nself-reward process and that process\nshould consist of 30 to 60 seconds of\nclosing your eyes well you don't have to\nit works better if you close your eyes\nand simply thinking about the fact that\nyes you can set a goal you can engage in\nthe specific set of questions do I want\nto do this practice today do I not want\nto do this practice today and then the\nspecific set of actions maybe they\ninvolve visual focus and the other tools\nwe talked about turning off of your\nphone Etc and you are somebody who can\nget things done you are somebody that is\nmoving forward toward your particular\ngoal and so you just sort of create a\nlittle bit of a positive cognitive loop\naround that ability that you are in fact\nbuilding up and that's something that\npeople often Overlook which is that not\nonly is moving toward a goal great\nbecause it establishes more robustness\nin the neural circuits that allow us to\nperform that thing right I mean after\nall that's what learning is eventually\nyou don't achieve the same frustration\nand errors that you do when trying to\nperform that thing eventually you learn\nhow to play the piano you learn how to\nspeak conversational French you run that\nsub six-minute mile but also the neural\ncircuits associated with self-generated\nmotivation and with the tools that we're\ntalking about themselves are subject to\nneuroplasticity so those become more\nrobust and that's fantastic because when\nyou eventually reach one goal I would\nhope that you would then update and set\nout to achieve another goal and you will\nfind that over time you will be more\neffective in achieving other goals by\nvirtue of the work that you did in\npursuing a previous goal because\nultimately it's really about defining\ngoals and then learning how to quantify\nthe actions required and then engaging\nin those actions so there's the specific\ncircuits involved in generating those\nactions which are very goal specific and\nthen there are the circuits which\ncircuits are we talking about we're\ntalking about that amydala the lateral\nprefrontal cortex the orbital frontal\ncortex and the basil ganglia we talked\nabout earlier that have been built up\nthat have been reinforced because as I\nmentioned there is one universal circuit\nfor goal Pursuit and achievement So\nRandom intermittent reinforcement is the\nkey and while I spent a good amount of\ntime talking about self-generated\ncognitive reinforcement this also\napplies to any kind of physical rewards\nthe movie that you're going to reward\nyourself with the ice cream cone the\nwhatever that you're going to reward\nyourself with perhaps it's monetary\nperhaps it's food perhaps it's social\nrandom intermittent rewards are the ones\nthat are going to keep you motivated and\nare going to best increase the\nprobability of success not just within a\ngiven bout of learning not just dayto\nday not just week to week not just\nquarter to quarter but across the\nlifetime an important protocol to\nincorporate in your goal Pursuits is one\nthat I learned from Dr Maya Shankar when\nshe was a guest on the huban Lab podcast\nand she talked about the so-called\nmiddle problem the middle problem is the\nfact that people tend to have a lot of\nmotivation at the outset of pursuing a\ngoal although you now know that\nsometimes or some people don't have a\nlot of motivation when pursuing their\ngoal at the start so they need to think\nabout failures and how terrible\neverything will be and then they will\ncertainly have motivation it's going to\nbe a fear-based motivation but in\ngeneral people tend to have more\nmotivation at the start of pursuing a\ngoal and at the end when they get close\nto or they start start to perceive the\nfinish line but that most people\nexperience the so-called middle problem\nwhere in the middle of a learning bout\nor in the middle of the week or in the\nmiddle of a 12-week cycle they are less\nmotivated and this has actually been\nQuantified in numerous studies and there\nare several ways to overcome the middle\nproblem the simplest one is to\nacknowledge it to recognize that it's\ncoming and so when it does come and\nyou're experiencing lower levels of\nmotivation perhaps\neven increased failure rates and you're\nnot performing as well you're getting\nfrustrated to know that that's a natural\nprocess that everybody experiences and\njust knowing that can sometimes allow\npeople to move through that to the place\nwhere then they can sense the end of the\nlearning bout or they can sense that\nthey're making some progress the finish\nline is there and then they get that\nincrease in motivation again however\nsometimes the middle problem is such a\nproblem that people need some tools to\nmove through it and and the best way to\nmove through the middle problem or in\nfact to eliminate it is actually to make\nthe middle of a learning bout its own\nseparate thing that you acknowledge the\npresence of and that you break up into\nthree separate bouts so here we're\ntalking about carving up the 1 hour\nlearning bout or the two-hour learning\nbout into an initial phase where you\neither have naturally occurring\nmotivation or you use fear-based\nvisualization to increase your\nmotivation you lean into that and then\nlet's assume it's a 1H hour learning\nbout and then at about the 25 minute\nMark you start to experience lower\nlevels of focus perhaps then you use the\nvisual Target protocol but then you go\nback into your bout of learning and\nyou're not feeling very motivated it's\nhard your mind is drifting you want to\npick up your phone you want to do other\nthings you find yourself doing other\nthings that's the period of time to take\nSay the 25 minute to 45 minute period\nwithin the session and divide it into\nperhaps three or even four smaller\nchunks of time and you perhaps have\nheard of chunking before chunking is\nsimply breaking something down into\nsmaller chunks that are more achievable\nthat's simply what we're talking about\nhere but really chunking up that middle\nsection of a learning bout can be very\neffective at essentially eliminating the\nmiddle problem now for those of you that\nare going to be really nitpicky you'll\nsay wait you take that 20 minutes from\nthe 25 minute Mark to the 45 minute Mark\nwithin your hour learning bout and you\ndivide it up into four little uh chunks\nand in those two middle chunks I'm going\nto feel the middle problem for those two\nmiddle chunks ah well that's not not\nactually the way it pans out fortunately\nwhen you break things down into small\nenough chunks you eliminate the middle\nproblem and you experience sustained\nmotivation now the extreme\ninterpretation of that would have you\nmeasuring every minute or even every\nsecond of a learning bout and having\nconsistent motivation throughout that\nbecause for instance if you can\nconcentrate for 10 seconds why wouldn't\nyou simply be able to just mark off\n10-second increments well at some point\nthe marking off or the monitoring of\nthose increments is going to be\ndistracting to toward the thing that you\nactually want to do so the simple thing\nto do is to acknowledge the middle\nproblem right the fact that we have more\nmotivation at the start and at the end\nof our goal Pursuit sessions than we do\nwithin the middle and then to Simply\nchunk that middle section into three\nmaybe four smaller chunks and if you\nneed to incorporate things like the\nvisual Target protocol one or three or\nperhaps even eight times within that\nmiddle section so be it it's going to\nhelp you move through with better focus\nand better motivation and what I just\ndescribed can of course be applied to\nthe longer bouts of effort that don't\noccur just during one learning bout but\nperhaps across the week so for instance\nif you are doing four days a week of\nlanguage learning or Fitness training so\nmaybe it's a Monday Wednesday Friday\nSaturday type of Schedule H you may\nnotice that in the middle of the week\nthe Wednesday training session tends to\nbe the one that you're less motivated to\ndo for whatever reason there could be\nany reason at all for which the\nmotivation is lower in the middle of the\nweek it doesn't matter well in that case\nyou would want to First acknowledge the\npresence of the middle problem so you\nwould want to acknowledge that that\nWednesday training bout is prone to the\nmiddle problem because it is indeed the\nmiddle problem it's in the middle of the\nMonday and the Friday training bouts so\nthen you would want to approach it with\nthe understanding that it's going to be\nthere and that you are going to need\ntools and protocols that will allow you\nto overcome it by for instance taking\nthat one or two hour session on\nWednesdays and putting a bit more time\ntoward a visual Target protocol at the\nbeginning to increase your focus a bit\nmore more visualizing failure if you are\nfeeling amotivated that means not\nmotivated in nerd speak amotivated\ntoward doing that Wednesday session and\nyou would want to break up that\nWednesday session into smaller chunks so\ninstead of looking at that 2hour session\nyou might break it up into a series of\n15 minute smaller learning bouts done\nconsecutively back toback and then in\ndoing so you have essentially taken that\nWednesday session and I'll bet that it\nbecomes at least among your most\nmotivated sessions so the middle problem\nexists it's important to acknowledge and\nthere are tools to overcome the middle\nproblem on any time scale you simply\nhave to Chunk Up the middle and approach\nthings with deliberate increased Vigor\njust as you would you know if you're\nrunning and there's always a tough Hill\nyou have to really or gear up for\nattacking that hill and then to do that\nrepeatedly in those smaller chunks until\nyou've completed that session so today\nI've been talking about how to approach\ngoal setting and pursuit at and in\naround the specific times that one is\nengaged in goal setting and pursuit the\nwriting down of goals defining of goals\nthe timing and then the actual training\nsessions or the practice sessions toward\nachieving that goal what I haven't\ntalked about is how to show up to all of\nthat in the best possible State of Mind\nand Body in order to achieve the best\npossible results and of course there are\nnumerous things that we need to do in\norder to quote unquote show up at our\nbest where we would stand the best\npossibility of Performing our best and\nlearning the best in those learning\nbouts things like getting adequate sleep\ngetting sunlight in our eyes early in\nthe day adequate and proper nutrition\nsocial connection and so on we talked\nabout all of that on previous podcast\nepisodes so I'm not going to talk about\nthose again now but it is important to\nrecognize that the backdrop of Our Lives\nhow well we've slept what's going on in\nour personal lives will all Impact\nthings like motivation and frankly our\nability to even identify what's\nimportant because you know if we're\ndealing with a Health crisis or someone\nclose to us is dealing with a Health\ncrisis we tend to have our attention\ndiverted toward that but I do want to\nacknowledge all of that because it is\ncritically important in defining how\nyou're going to show up to these\nEndeavors and for that matter all\nEndeavors now with that said there are a\nfew things that you can do in order to\ntry and optimize your ability to focus\nand your level of motivation during your\ngoal Pursuits and there are some really\ninteresting data and protocols that I\nhaven't talked so much about on this\npodcast ever that are relevant to\ntoday's discussion and this relates to\nour so-called circadian rhythms in\nattention we have robust rhythms in our\nability to focus and our level of\nmotivation that vary across the 24-hour\nAKA circadian cycle with a regular\nrhythmicity that is independent of how\nbadly we want a goal or how afraid we\nare of failure right all the stuff about\nmotivation and fear of failure and\ndesire Etc all of that is still true but\nwe all have a naturally occurring rhythm\nof rise and fall and return to rise and\nfall of our levels of attention and\nmotivation and this is something that's\nbeen described beautifully in the\nscientific literature in fact I'll\nprovide a link to what I consider a\nreally nice review on this topic this is\na review that was published by Pablo\nValdes in the Yale Journal biology and\nMedicine in 2019 entitled circadian\nrhythms in attention and there's a lot\nof information within this review but we\ncan distill out of a couple of useful\ngems from it so if you are somebody who\nis embarking on the pursuit of a goal\nwhich is particularly hard that's going\nto require a really high level of\nmotivation and focus know that there are\nthree times during the day when you\nstand to have the greatest level of\nfocus and attention and of course this\nwill vary depending on when you went to\nsleep at night and when you wake up\nthere's natural variation in circadian\nrhythms but it's worth knowing that most\npeople find that their level of\nattention and motivation is going to be\nhighest 30 minutes 3 hours and 11 hours\nafter waking up okay so 30 minutes 3\nhours and 11 hours after waking up and\nthis relates to a number of important\nbiological principles related to\ncircadian shifts in body temperature\nwhich are also related to circadian\nshifts that means changes around the\n24-hour cycle in the release of\nparticular neurochemicals so the amount\nof dopamine available to be released by\nany sort of goal pursuit or reward the\namount of Serotonin available lots of\nneurochemistry in there lots of neural\ncircuitry but these heighten levels of\nfocus and motivation that just occur\nnaturally regardless of what goal one is\ntrying to pursue in fact regardless of\nwhether or not you're trying to pursue\nany goal 30 minutes 3 hours and 11 hours\nafter waking your focus and motivation\nare going to be their greatest relative\nto other times in that 24-hour cycle now\nas I tell you this I can imagine that\nsome of you are thinking great I'm going\nto schedule one bout of goal Pursuits 3\nhours after waking and another one 11\nhours after waking great if you can do\nthat and that fits with your work and\nother demands of Life your relationships\nEtc terrific however I don't want this\n30 minute 3-hour and 11-hour protocol to\nbe considered a rule and here's why most\npeople don't have a tremendous degree of\ncontrol over their schedule things like\nwork and family and other demands\nconstrain them in terms of when they can\nget the work in and while I do think\nit's extremely valuable to schedule the\nspecific time or roughly the specific\ntime even though know that's an oxymoron\nmeaning a period of time during the day\nsay before 9:00 a.m. or between 9:00 and\nnoon that you are going to carry out\nyour goal Pursuit Endeavors I've talked\nabout this in previous podcasts some\npeople do very well by scheduling an\nexact time from noon to 2 I'm writing\nother people like myself do a little\nbetter if I set a constraint but it's a\nlittle bit broader such as I'm going to\nexercise before 9 a.m. that could be\nanytime before 9:00 a.m. or I'm going to\nengage in language learning some time\nbetween say 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. as\nopposed to setting a specific time\nthat's just what works best for me\npeople vary in terms of whether or not\nthey respond best to setting a specific\ntime or a Time block and setting up\nthese kind of barriers after which you\nare essentially telling yourself you\nwon't do it but and this is a very\nimportant\nbut it is most important that you\nactually engage in the goal Pursuit and\nI experienced this recently I'm trying\nto run more these days uh I still enjoy\ndoing resistance training I still run\nthree days a week but I'm trying to run\na little bit longer as opposed to just\ndoing the one long run per week and then\ntwo shorter runs later in the week I've\ntalked about this in my optimal Fitness\nprotocol episode if you want to check\nthat out or check out the PDF where it's\nall distilled down to one or two pages\nif you like but in any event these days\nI'm trying to extend the amount of time\nthat I'm running I'm just enjoying that\nit's kind of a throwback for me to when\nI ran across country as a senior in high\nschool and this was the time of year\nwhen I would start getting ready for the\nfall season so I'm enjoying running more\nand just this last week I had the\nexperience of having a very full Sunday\nand that's usually the day when I run in\nthe morning or hike during the middle of\nthe day and I simply did not get around\nto it because I had a lot of other\nimportant things to do and what I found\nwas 9 p.m. rolled around 10 p.m. rolled\naround and I started thinking ah like I\nwish I had gone running my Monday was\ngoing to be busy so what did I do I\nlaced up my shoes and I went for a run\nat 1000 p.m. something I haven't done\nsince college or maybe even high school\nand I ended up running for 90 minutes\nfrom 10: p.m. until 11:30 p.m.\ndefinitely not the optimal time for me\nto go running in fact I was thinking oh\nthis might disrupt my sleep but in fact\nit didn't I came back I showered had a\nlittle bit of food which normally I\ndon't eat that late and I slept like a\nbaby and I felt great the next day\nwaking up at my normal time which cues\nme to another important scientific fact\nthat relates to protocol and protocol\nflexibility which is something that I\ngleaned from a colleague of mine at\nStanford School of Medicine who works in\nthe Sleep laboratory and I intend to\nhave him as a guest on this podcast\nwhich is that much of our subjective\nfeelings of energy and well-being during\nthe day have to do not just with how\nwell and how much we slept the night\nbefore but how positively we view our\nprevious days experiences and how\npositively we view our next day and in\nfact that same day Pursuits and\nexperiences so in other words how we\nfeel about our previous day performance\nand how we feel about what we're about\nto embark on during our day can increase\nour energy and that might seem obvious\nto a number of you but these days as I\nand many others out there are talking so\nmuch about the importance of sleep which\nis of course essential you do want to\nget great sleep as many nights of your\nlife as you possibly can and if you\ndon't sleep much for a given night\nhopefully it's for reasons that you\nenjoy and positive things like a party\nor a wedding or you know use your\nimagination but it's also the case that\nwhen we successfully complete something\nthat we told ourselves that we are going\nto do we feel great about it and that if\nit means that we sleep a little bit less\nor that we have to do our practice bout\nyou know at 3: p.m. or 2 p.m. a time of\nday when we're really ordinarily in the\ntrough of attention and we have to use\n20 different tools or one tool 20\ndifferent times in order to get through\nthat bout of learning the fact that we\ncomplete it leaves us with a feeling of\naccomplishment and I'm certain although\nI don't know exactly which that there\nare neurochemicals and hormones that\nreflect that it's almost with certainty\ngoing to involve dopamine and other\nneurochemicals but the point is not to\nget reductionist about it the point is\nthat yes heightened attention and focus\noccur naturally 30 minutes 3 hours and\n11 hours after waking but the really\nimportant thing about all of this goal\nsetting and pursuit is to do it to get\nit done to set the goal to do it\nspecifically make it quantifiable when\nyou're going to do it make it about verb\nStates and then simply do it thank
