    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today my\nguest is Tony Hawk Tony Hawk is one of\nthe most celebrated and accomplished\nprofessional skateboarders of all time\nfor more than 40 years he has been at\nthe Forefront of the sport and I don't\nmean just doing a sport for more than 40\nyears I truly mean he has been at the\nForefront of skateboarding developing\nnew Maneuvers AKA tricks that include\nincredible Feats like the 900 and 900\ndegree spin in the air as well as\nnumerous other Maneuvers that have\nreally pushed the entire sport forward\nhe's also completely popularized the\nsport through his video game and through\nhis ambassadorship for skateboarding in\nfact few if any names are synonymous\nwith skateboarding in the general public\nas Tony Hawk and he is oh so deserved of\nthat title because for more than 40\nyears he has shown up as the consummate\nprofessional he is kind he is respectful\nand he is completely committed to his\ncraft and that shows up in every aspect\nof his life he still to this day\nskateboards daily and as you'll soon\nlearn he recently suffered a major\ninjury a complete break of his femur\nthat is the bone in his upper leg and\nthis is what many people would consider\na career-ending injury not only did Tony\ncome back from that injury but he went\nback to the very trick on which he broke\nhis femur and recently completed that\ntrick that is a 540 or so-called mitt\ntwist I mentioned this because at every\nlevel of his life Tony has demonstrated\nhimself to be somebody with Incredible\nDrive incredible vision and incredible\npersistence and today we talk about that\ndry vision and persistence and we talk\nabout what it takes to set a goal and to\ncontinually evolve one's goal and to\ncontinually progress as a basically\nyoung pre-teen as a teenager as a young\nadult as an adult and well let's face it\nas a 55 year old man he is now heading a\nlittle bit past middle age although we\ndo hope that he lives forever\nTony Hawk AKA The Birdman really does\nseem to be superhuman but as you learned\ntoday he is oh so human in the way that\nhe shares his own experience and shares\nwith you the ways in which we can each\nand all look at what we do and think\nabout what we want to achieve and put\nour minds and our bodies to those goals\nand Achieve them I confess that today's\ndiscussion with Tony Hawk was a\nparticularly thrilling one for me to\nhave\nI grew up in the sport of skateboarding\nso I had met Tony previously although he\ndoesn't remember it that was many years\nago in fact I met his parents you'll\nlearn more about that story during\ntoday's episode but I was aware of\ncourse of Tony's accomplishments I was\nalso aware of his philanthropy so he has\na skatepark Foundation I also listened\nto his podcast with another professional\nskateboarder Jason Ellis called Hawk vs\nwolf we provided a link to that podcast\nin the show note captions as well but\nnever before have I had the opportunity\nto sit down and talk to the Tony Hawk\nand learn from him so I was absolutely\ndelighted to have this conversation and\nit far exceeded my already lofty\nexpectations before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is element\nelement is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you\ndon't that means plenty of electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium but no\nsugar the electrolytes and hydration are\nabsolutely key for mental health\nphysical health and performance even a\nslight degree of dehydration can impair\nour ability to think our energy levels\nand our physical performance element\nmakes it very easy to achieve proper\nhydration and it does so by including\nthe three electrolytes in the exact\nratios they need to be present I drink\nelement first thing in the morning when\nI wake up I usually mix it with about 16\nto 32 ounces of water if I'm exercising\nI'll drink one while I'm exercising and\nI tend to drink one after exercising as\nwell\nmany people are scared off by the idea\nof ingesting sodium because obviously we\ndon't want to consume sodium in excess\nhowever for people that have normal\nblood pressure and especially for people\nthat are consuming very clean diets that\nis consuming not so many processed foods\nor highly processed foods oftentimes we\nare not getting enough sodium magnesium\nand potassium and we can suffer as a\nconsequence and with element simply by\nmixing in water it tastes delicious it's\nvery easy to get that proper hydration\nif you'd like to try element you can go\nto drink element that's lmnt.com\nhuberman to claim a free element sample\npack with your

because\nI've tracked your career for a very long\ntime grew up in the skateboard thing I I\nknow had your poster on my wall oh thank\nyou your name is synonymous with\nskateboarding as you know I think a\nquestion that probably get asked from\ntime to time but let's just clarify the\ndata from the outset Tony Hawk is your\nreal name right yes Anthony Frank Hawk\nbut I never went by Anthony I mean my\nparents call me Tony since I could\nremember so it's a fitting name given\nthe sport and what you do and we will\nget into this a little bit later when we\ntalk about family and parenting and\nparents\num but I'll allude to the story now that\nuh\nwhen I was 14 years old your parents\ntook me in yeah I slept in your bed in\nyour home so wild not with you in it but\nsurrounded by your a near infinite\nnumber of trophies and and\num it must have been right after I moved\nout\nso this would be I was 14 years old\nmaybe I'll just tell the story now very\nbriefly I was 14 years old I was at a\ncontest at Linda Vista Boys Club\neveryone left me and another kid named\nBilly Waldman\nuh we're still there your dad said\nwhere where are you going\num it was clear that I didn't know where\nI was going my life was I was a wayward\nyouth at that time and so they took me\nin for uh a night maybe even two nights\nyour mom uh Nancy and your dad Frank\nwere so gracious brought me in into your\nhome took me to dinner\num I mean that tracks that would\ndefinitely my dad and my mom together\nwould be doing that yes incredible\npeople\num and we'll get back to that story\nlater because you and I actually met uh\nthe next day in Fallbrook at your ramp\nbut so it had been 88 89 that's right\nI'm gonna say I'm gonna say 89. okay and\nit must have been one of the either NSA\nor Castle contests yeah that your dad\nwas very active in well we'll get back\nto that but uh I have so many questions\nthat relate to skateboarding to you and\nreally as a neuroscientist to the whole\nconcept of a life of continual\nprogression because\nbut they're not people listening to this\nand watching this are skateboarders or\nnot and I imagine that most of them are\nnot\nit's absolutely clear that you've been\nin this game a very long time and that\nyou've somehow managed to continue to\nprogress over and over to come back from\nvery severe injuries and somehow keep\ngetting better and better so the first\nquestion I have is about the younger\nversion of you um\ndid you have any sort of self-concept\nlike you know I want to be a pro athlete\nor I want to be a skateboarder or I want\nto have a video game named after me\nright right exactly\num you know but if you can think back to\nmaybe even pre-skateboarding do you\nremember what your self-concept was you\nknow this notion of like\num I have a self and I'm either similar\nor different to other kids in some way\nwhen I was young\nI was put in a lot of advanced classes\nand not that that felt like a badge of\nhonor it felt more like I was just\nclassified as a nerd\nbut then I thought okay well that's my\nstrength so I'll lean into that and I\nthought that maybe I would be a teacher\nbecause I thought well I I get all these\nConcepts and I think I could relate them\nto kids or to my peers because I helped\na lot of my classmates\nthrough some of some classes so\nthat's all I really had I didn't know\nand then when I would play sports I\nwould I would be okay you know I wasn't\nI wasn't terrible but I wasn't the VIP\nor the MVP and so I was just kind of\nplaying basketball playing uh baseball\num and then when I found skateboarding\nI mean it was it was pretty obvious that\nthat was what I wanted to do it was once\nonce I got on a skateboard and realized\nthat I could maneuver it and do things\nthat were unique\nand now they're moving the needle or\nanyone cared but they were unique in the\nsense of like I didn't I've never seen\nanyone do this and this feels awesome\nand so I just want to do this and so I\ndidn't think that this is my career I\nwas 10. so I just thought this is this\nis my phone this is my hobby this is\nthis is my thing\num and I don't want to play these other\nsports anymore\ndid you stop playing all the others yes\nI I quit I quit little league in the\nmiddle of the season when my dad had\nbeen appointed president of that chapter\nof Little League\nbecause he was the coach he was always\nvery involved in all of his kids I have\nthree siblings so he was always very\nsupportive whatever they were doing and\nthen when I was playing baseball he\nbecame a coach because he had time and\nhe was doing that he was he was you know\nalmost retired\num and then he was such a prominent\nfigure in the Little League they said oh\nyou're president now and so then someone\nelse was coach and then I was skating\nand I was over it\ndid you immediately start skateboarding\nin the parks on transition as we say or\nwere you pushing around in the driveway\nlike most kids it was I was\ntransportation\nand skating was kind of a fad so I\nstarted in 78 roughly maybe 77 even and\nit was kind of a fad so\nkids just had skateboards and they would\nthey would all cruise around you know\nlike it was the 70s so everyone had a\nbike right and you knew wherever all the\nkids were because the bikes were in the\nfront lawn and then at some point that\nkind of turned into skating\nso everyone had skateboards they're all\nlike\nshitty\nyou know uh JCPenney or Big Box store\nskateboards no one had really good ones\nnot in my area\num but then at some point we were just\nlooking at these magazines of people\nskating and everyone's skating in pools\nbecause that was the Dogtown and Z-Boys\nera and it was like these guys are\nflying I wanna like where do we do that\nand then the skate park opened up in San\nDiego that was Del Mar's Cooper uh okay\nOasis Oasis skatepark was the first one\nin our area actually I take that back\nSpring Valley was the first skate park I\ntried to go there and I was nine and you\nhad to be 10.\nand I remember like sitting in the\nparking lot looking over the fence and\nmy dad didn't realize what they ate\nbecause my dad would have easily lied\nfor me but he didn't realize there was\nan age limit and he said how old is he\nnine oh sorry he can't come\nand then they closed\nnot long after so when I never got to\nSpring Valley\num because I I think of you as\nsynonymous with Del Mar skate Ranch sure\nwell that was that came later because\nOasis skate park was opened up so this\nwas when I first went was like 78.\nuh a friend of mine was going and he\nsaid I want to go to the skate park so I\nhad to go get\nyou know this is such a hassle like I\nhad to go get the authorization form I\nhad to get it notarized by the bank for\nmy parents like to go there and then I\nwent and it was that was my Epiphany\nwhen I first saw people flying around in\nperson I was like this is what I'm doing\nfor as long as I could possibly do it\nbecause it looked it looked like magic\nit really did it looked like they were\nflying on magic carpets and and it spoke\nto me in the sense of being a daredevil\nbut also\ndoing it individually not relying on my\nteam not\num getting\nhassled by a coach it was just like oh I\ncan be part of the scene but do it my\nown way and then uh\nI skated Oasis as much as I could\nwhenever I get your rides there and\num then my parents moved to North County\nSan Diego when I was in high school\num mostly because they were just chasing\nkind of real estate deals and uh and so\nI got lucky that Dome our skate Ranch\nwas right there\nevery other Park closed but Del Mar\nskate Ranch remained open so I mean\nthere was a bit of luck to all that and\nit was based on geography\nyour dad's involvement is interesting\nbecause\nI got into skateboarding because you\nknow my dad wasn't around that much at\nthat time a lot of kids getting\nskateboarding because it doesn't require\nparent involvement was it unusual to\nhave parental involvement at that stage\nyeah I mean I remember Frank and by the\nway I remember Frank and Nancy your\nparents with was with such fondness not\njust because they took me in but I\nremember thinking like there they were\nat times the only point of stability in\na landscape of like 200 people where as\nyou know there could be potential chaos\nof any kind and your dad had this way of\nmoving about like he wasn't afraid I\nrecall that he wasn't afraid to say what\nhe thought like hey don't do that like\nimpose some regulation at this contest\nand at the same time it seemed me also\nunderstood that this was a sport unlike\nother sports like you're not gonna\nregulate\nkids like me at the time or you're not\ngoing to try and control people so what\nwas it like to have your dad involved\nand the reason I ask is that you're a\nparent we'll talk more about parenting\nbut also it seems that he went from\nsaying okay you know little league other\nsports which is more typical to okay\nthis kind of unusual sport skateboarding\nbut your mere interest in it was enough\nto get him excited or motivated enough\nto take you around to these places\num that's pretty special I mean that's\npretty it was I mean and in that respect\nit was great to have his support and and\nto rely on him for that the fact that he\nwas always around and he was in charge\nof a lot of the events that that sucked\nbecause\nbecause it just marked me\num as one being favorited\num and spoiled\num and and most of my friends their\nparents didn't want them skating so even\nthough they were stoked that my dad had\nwas was doing this kind of thing and\ngiving that kind of support they still\nwere like your Dad's here like this is\nour thing this is our scene this is our\ngetaway from our parents\nwell I I didn't really have a choice in\nthe matter I did I did at some point\ntell him my my concerns and my\nfrustrations with it but he didn't\nreally want to hear it you know he was\nhe was very much steadfast like well I'm\nI'm been coming this far like you can we\ncan keep our distance at these events\nbut people are relying on me to organize\nthem and so I just had to suck it up for\na while did it push you harder like you\nknow if you could prove yourself with a\nskateboarding that you didn't have to\nworry about any claims of favoritism\nbecause ultimately you can't fake you\ncan't fake Escape right right I mean\nthere's no deep fake version of\nskateboarding you know you either can do\nit or you can't do it and it's shown in\nreal time\nso\num\nand I suppose back then I recall you\nwere quite a bit\nskinny or skinnier oh yeah I had I had\nall kinds of things going against me at\nthe time yeah I mean I don't think\npeople will realize this unless they've\nmet you in person but nowadays there are\na few taller skateboarders out there\nbecause the Sports grown so much\num but you're pretty tall you're like\nsix six three but okay I was not when I\nwas growing when I was that age I was\nvery small\num and kind of\nconcerningly small Because by the time I\ngot to be 16\nI was still I looked like I was 13. I\nused to get pulled over\nI literally like I had a car that I\nbought with my earnings I had a Honda\nCivic 1977 cvcc and I would get pulled\nover and then the cops would be like how\nold are you again 16. like well you look\nlike you were 13 back there\num and then I shot up around age 17.\nokay so that's interesting and we can\nget back to this when we talk about your\nalmost remarkable levels of ability to\nrecover from physical injuries because\num well I'll just share a little bit of\na biological Theory here which is that\nyou know there are a lot of people that\nstudy longevity and perhaps the fastest\nrate of Aging that we ever undergo is\npuberty right if you think about a kid\nbefore puberty kid after abuse different\nhuman being psychologically often\nphysically as well some people have a\nlonger Arc of puberty than others and\nthat does seem to correlate with a\nlonger life\nand so it's kind of interesting you know\nsome kids hit puberty and they go\nthrough all the markers of puberty in\nlike one summer right other kids it's\nvery very long and it sounds like we\ndon't have to talk about when you hit\npuberty and the other markers but it\nsounds like your growth spurt occurred\nlate oh yeah that's a terrific marker of\na long life by the way because what it\nreflects is the onset of a big burst of\ngrowth hormone out of the pituitary in\nthe brain and\nif you continue to grow for a long\nperiod of time that indicates you know\nit gives you a little bit of the slope\nof the line does that make sense oh yeah\nso um this this may um have important\nand fortunate consequences so at 17 you\nshot up am I correct in Remembering uh\nmaybe you said it maybe somebody else\ndid that you were\num forgive me but so skinny when you\nwere a kid that you actually wore elbow\npads as knee pads yeah yeah that's a\ntrue that's a true story for sure and\nand\nI took inspiration from others that that\nI identified with namely Steve Caballero\nbecause he was already an established\nPro when I started to come up in the\nranks or even get noticed at all and he\nwas wearing elbow pads on his knees in\nthis full-page picture of him and\nWinchester doing a back sitter and I was\nlike that I want to do that and he's\nsmall\nand I feel like that's my goal yeah like\nif he can do that I can do it it was\njust more like oh this I identify with\nthat and and that gives me hope\num and as I recall Stevie also has a\npretty severe scoliosis right like at\none point Julius what he has at one\npoint he was turned turned pretty pretty\ntight to the to the right or left I\ndon't recall which I mean still\nincredible skateboarder loves TV he's a\nNorCal guy so yeah I grew up I know\nwhatever he had is from birth but um but\nit was more that his size and I didn't\neven know he was he many not many but\nyou know he's like four years older than\nme\num so I just was like oh there's small\nguys doing that I can do it maybe but\nwhen I got tall when I went through\npuberty suddenly I had all these tricks\nand then suddenly I had the strength and\nthe the height that gave me confidence\nand so all of a sudden it was like oh I\ncan go way higher now\nand I'm comfortable with these tricks\nthese intricate board Maneuvers and\nstuff so that was a huge advantage to me\num the the smaller Stuff felt different\nafter that which was harder\num but being able to blast AFI in the\nair as opposed to four feet in the air\nwas a huge Advantage yeah isn't that\nwild when the nervous system knows how\nto do something and then your body\nchanges and you can do the same thing\nbut with so much more Force even the\nbowls look smaller\nwhen I would stand on top I was like\nwait this isn't that big\nit's wild well the reason I ask about\nthis I think you know people listening\ngenerally seem to assume that you know\nif you become a Stanford Professor or\nbecome a professional skateboarder or\nyou a professional soccer player that\nthat you were just fated to become that\nright and it's clear that it's the\nConfluence of so many different factors\num but one of the consistent factors for\nsure is a sense that you just really\nlove doing it right I mean I can't\nimagine getting\nyou know proficient or excellent at\nanything without loving doing it right\nand so still at this time when you were\nlet's say um 14 15\num did you have any concept of you know\nwhatever pro model I'm gonna none of\nthat well there was there was none of\nthat to be had\nso we didn't have these great\naspirations because no one had really\ndone that before there were you could\nhave some success yes you could have\nmaybe a signature model but even the top\nsales of skateboarding then wasn't a\ncareer\nthe prize money was 150 for first place\n100 for second 50 for third\ncouple tanks of gas some food yeah so\nlet's put it this way\nI turned Pro when I was 14. by the time\nI was\n15 and a half and I had a learner's\npermit and I could drive a scooter you\nknow I had 600 in my bank account and I\nused that to buy a Honda Express uh\nmoped for a year and a half that was my\nearnings\nwas six hundred dollars so clearly money\nwasn't the uh the dopamine hit it was\nthe it was the actual skateboard sure\nand that's what I mean though there\nwasn't there was no goal of that because\nit just didn't exist so I didn't care\nlike getting I I have my own vehicle\nat age 15 like I was living large\nI can get to the skate park on my own\nthat was amazing\nto be 14\nand be a professional at anything must\nbe\num a trip so to speak\num but what I'm wondering about because\nI came up when\num your early cohort with Paul Peralta\nso for those that don't know so-called\nBones Brigade right\nI guess it was a total what like six\nseven guys there were someone that were\na little more peripheral than others\num they're about six seven core guys\num in the various videos I mean you guys\nwere famous right you had posters\num on kids walls who skateboarded there\nwas a second or maybe it was a third\nsurge of popularity and skateboarding\num because it would sort of surge in\ngeneral popularity than disappear and\ncome back as it has over decades it\nkeeps coming and going\num to some extent\ndid you have a conscious awareness of\njust how you know how much attention was\nbeing placed on you know photos of you\nvideos of you and I'm just wondering\nabout the younger version of you whether\nor not you know you realize what was\nhappening and the reason I ask is\nbecause you've always seemed to me\nsomebody who through interviews through\nvideos through our interactions and for\nthose who have known you much longer\nthan I have\num just very grounded like not caught up\nin it\num you know we've never seen headlines\nabout you kind of just you know blowing\nall your money or you know wrecking cars\nand you know destroying your life I mean\nI'm sure you've made mistakes like any\nof us but but you seem to have avoided a\nlot of the pitfalls of quote unquote\nfamous people and celebrities and yet\nyou were a famous person from a very\nyoung age\nI\nwell I think it was that I didn't never\nI never\nthat was never a goal and then when I\nhad a sense of it I was very\nuncomfortable\nI mean I was happy I was happy to be\nsuccessful I was happy that people\nrecognized me that that was amazing just\nbecause I was good at skateboarding I\nnever imagined something like that\num and but I was always very\nI mean some people thought that I was\nsort of almost like pompous or arrogant\nbecause I wasn't interacting because I\nwas just I was walled up I was like I\ndon't know what to do I don't know this\nis the last words I would ever use to\ndescribe you I think it was just more\nthat that that people would see me like\nI go to a ramp I didn't know anybody and\nI would just start skating and I'd do\nall my stuff and they were like oh he\ndoesn't even talk to anyone\nand I was like I don't know I don't know\nwhat to do I don't know how to act also\nyou were 14 years old so Stacy broke me\nout of that because I remember one time\nthere was a kid that was just staring at\nme like hold my skateboard he had my\nsignature model and he said go say hi to\nthat guy\nwhat are you sure like he wants he wants\nto interact with you you know just go\nhigh five of them or anything and and I\nlearned to sort of break out of my\ncomfort zone by doing that enough\num but my first go around I mean that\nwas that was sort of my first\nuh wave of Fame I'd say the Bones\nBrigade years\nand we are so young that we thought this\nis forever\nand so we were definitely careless with\nour our money with our actions and\num and at some point my dad saw that he\ndidn't think it was going to be long\nterm\nbecause no one had had a long-term\ncareer right so he he uh encouraged me\nto to invest to get property like to buy\na house\nthat was the that was my Saving Grace\nbecause I definitely was\nspending on cars and things like that uh\nyeah car like kind of a little bit\nbeyond my means I wasn't really\nconsidering all my money was was 10.99\nincome so it wasn't we weren't paying\ntaxes on anything and at the end of the\nyear it would be like oh you owe this\nmuch like wait what are you talking\nabout so\num for instance\nhey do you want to go to Hawaii yeah\nokay invite everyone\nwe're all going to Hawaii\nI got well let's rent a place okay you\nknow and it was on me because I had the\nmeans you mentioned Stacy we should\nprobably clarify for people\num Tony's referring to the great Stacy\nPeralta yeah he was he was the one who\nput me on the Bones Brigade when I was\nstill considered sort of a circus act\nlike a you know my my skating was not\nreally established\nthe stuff that I was doing was largely\nmade fun of because people thought that\nwhat I was doing was just more like a\nfree show\ncan you explain more so my and let me\njust tell you that my recollection first\nrecollection of you that I still have\nthat image in my mind would um is the\nfinger flip error right you know so for\nfolks that aren't familiar with\nskateboarding you know people ride\naround on transition or in the street\nhandrails stairs you know people\nprobably familiar with all those things\nbut um skateboards will Riot up toward\nthe top of the pool of the ramp and\nthey'll do something on the so-called\nlip or the coping that's to ride at the\nthe edge of it or they'll go above it\nlike in the air but I recall seeing you\ndo the finger flip error I've never seen\nanyone flip a board in the air I've seen\npeople do varial so right move it it's\ngoing to be complicated for people just\nlistening but just flip it upside down\nand then catch it in and finger flip\nerror yeah that was I remember that was\na jaw drop right it was like so if that\nwas considered circus era or circus uh\nlike then I don't know I don't know what\nit was being compared to because at the\ntime we we probably watched that it was\nin slow motion as I recall and we\nprobably watched it\nthree thousand times you know that\nsummer there's a big group of us that\nall starts skateboarding that summer\num I would say kind of just before that\nin that window is when people were\nwere more\num\ngiving me Flack for what I was doing\nbecause I was mostly doing board\nvariation stuff but I still didn't have\nthe height the height in terms of the\nheight in terms of in terms of getting\nin the air yeah so I was doing all this\nstuff kind of right at coping level and\nso people weren't taking it into\nconsideration or giving it much Merit\nbecause it was just like oh he's doing a\nlittle board twist or a bar turn and\nthen when I started to get some height\naround the time you saw and started\ndoing those tricks like visibly way up\nhigh that's when the the the shift\nhappened in terms of more acceptance\nbut I was still labeled as a as like a\ntrick skater robot skater and then you\nhad Christian osoy who was all Style\nair is higher than anyone anytime he did\na trick it was going to be so flashy and\nso amazing and Rockstar personality and\nRockstar personality and so\nin that era you I mean it was very\ndivided it was like no one liked us both\nyou know what I mean\nit was just so strange to be of that age\nand of doing something that had never\nreally been established\nand then suddenly I'm pitted against\nanother skater and we're just trying to\nmake our way through\n15 years and and skateboarding and and\num it got it was it was hard I mean it\nwas like I got I got bullied\nyou know yes I was successful yes I was\nyou but but I would get I would get\nuh Thrasher magazine would talk\nabout my performance when I would win\nyeah I remember that because I was from\nNorthern California and Thrasher\nmagazine was a Skateboard Magazine from\nNorthern California actually wrote for\nthem for a while when I was a postdoc to\nmake some extra money uh under a\ndifferent name folks but you can try and\nfind those articles they're out there\num and then in Southern California it\nwas skateboarder mag Transworld mostly\nTransworld skateboarding yeah it was a\ntrans World transport skateboarding and\nThrasher magazine were there were the\ntwo the rivals right yeah um so yeah I\nrecall um some of those things that were\nsaid\num it just is amazing to me um but it\nbrings about a really important lesson\nwhich is you know that kid that gets\nmade fun of if they're determined and\nthey love what they're doing that's\ngoing to be the kid that blows everyone\naway later and I know this for sure\nbecause I'll never forget there do you\nremember the back to the city contest\nthat were called in San Francisco so I\nwent to those they were in the drain\nfountains in front of City Hall I\nremember getting there one day and there\nwas this guy with kind of like afro-like\nhair pushing around he was doing what\nare called daffies he had two\nskateboards he was kind of like weaving\naround and I remember thinking you know\nSan Francisco's other its issues now but\nback then it was rough also for\ndifferent reasons I remember thinking\nlike this guy is going to get beat up I\nhung out with the Embarcadero crew I was\nlike this guy's gonna get beat down yeah\nthat guy was Mark Gonzalez oh yeah so\none of the greatest\nperhaps the greatest Street skateboarder\nif you can't really Define these things\ngreatest and whatnot in skateboarding\num\nbut you know I remember thinking this\nguy's just he's a kook and then I\nrealized who it was and then I realized\nhe was just like any other kid there at\nsome level and then a lot of the kids\nthat got teased early on they stuck with\nit five years later I'm singing them in\nthe magazines and I think about this\nwith podcasting too there have been some\npodcasters they've reached out early on\nand had questions and you know look at\ntheir stuff and you know one's initial\nimpression can be like what are they\nlike what are they doing here and then\nyou just see them two years later three\nyears later and they're doing amazingly\nwell and you're like this guy or gal is\nhere for good they're gonna they're\nprobably gonna be top of the game in a\nfew years so you never count anybody out\nwhen you would go to sleep at night in\nthat era were you like laying on the\npillow going like oh my God people hate\nme there's stuff in the magazines I\ngotta push harder this is hard did you\ntalk to your dad about it I mean again\nit's a lot to Bear even as an adult I\ncan only imagine what it's like to bear\nas a 15 year old kid\nI didn't really have a support group you\nknow or any resource to to\nvoice those concerns\num\nI just knew I wanted to keep getting\nbetter that was it and so if anything if\nI was worried about those voices if I\nwas worried about the\nwhatever take people had on me\nI knew I was going to go back to the\nskate park and learn more tricks\num and at some point\nI had so much of that as a foundation\nthat it was sort of undeniable that like\nwell he can do all this stuff and he\ndoesn't just do it at his home park\num and I think that's probably when the\ntide turned for me is when when I\nstarted to do well at other events\num namely Upland pipeline which was\nfor the most part the most frightening\npool that we could ride the thing was\nbig but I also recall like the the hips\nas they're called like the transitions\nthe way they match up super tight\na lot of her giant coping super rough\nlike if you fell in Upland you're\ngetting shoot up it's pulling your knee\npads down but I didn't know that because\nfrom the photos I wouldn't know that oh\nit was it was treacherous it really was\nlike it was and and I wanted to do well\nat the event and I would drive up there\nevery weekend like my friend uh Greg\nSmith was a freestyler but he lived near\nUpland and so I would go drive Friday\nafter school straight to Upland skate at\nnight skate Saturday all day skate\nSunday uh early and then drive home\num because I live in San Diego\nand I just made it my mission to to\nfigure that thing out because\nthat was The Proving Ground for me\num Emma and so if I could skate that I\ncould go get anything\nas many of you know I've been taking ag1\ndaily since 2012. so I'm

English\nanxiety associated with it did you did\nyou and do you have a sort of systematic\nprocess was it you know I'm going to\nlearn the basics first like did you say\nthat do you say I'm okay I'm going to\nlearn how to do stuff you know at coping\nlevel then I'm gonna do a little error\nthen I'm gonna go bigger I'm gonna do\nthis or um did you\njust sort of um try what you wanted to\ntry and you obviously weren't haphazard\nabout it like how it seems you're pretty\nsystematic about exploring what's\npossible and then pushing forward little\nby little but um yeah maybe you could\ntalk a little bit about how you have\nconceptualized okay tomorrow I want to\ntry this\num it comes in different forms but for\nthe most part I think about how I could\ncombine existing tricks\nand would this trick work going into\nthis trick and could your body position\nshift or would it all work in unison and\nwhen I approach a new trick I'm saying\nI'm saying more in the last 20 years\nmy thought process is I have all the\npieces to this I've done every bit of it\nI've done that I've done the first part\nof the trick in another form I've done\nthe second part or the grinding of it or\nwhatever\nusually in some other basic way and then\nthe landing is well the landing is from\nwhatever that is and if you can throw\nall those things together and make the\ntiming work it's gonna work and I I\nnever I never went at something with\nsome Hazard approach or throwing caution\nto the wind like hope this see what\nhappens it's always very much like I\nknow I have all these things and so I\njust have to put them together and I\nmean now\nthings are so technical that my same\napproach that I'm doing hundreds of\ntimes one of them just works and it's\nnot because I didn't it's not because I\ncommitted to that one it's because\nof some tiny fractional adjustment that\nhappened that I didn't even know happen\nand it just worked and I mean that kind\nof is the curse of what tricks are now\nbecause\nthere are plenty of moves that I've done\nover the last 10 years even that I I\nonly did once because it was too\nhard to get to and I didn't learn from\nthat one make\nand that that is that's hard to accept\nbecause in the past I was learning\ntricks to have them in my Arsenal that I\ncould just throw them down at a\ncompetition or a demo I've got that in\nmy pocket\nthese days like that trick for instance\nI did a I did a 360 shove it five out of\nfakie all right let's let's break that\ndown for real 360 shove it so who's\ngonna take this on I'll let you take\nthis on I can try it from my knowledge\nand perspective but whatever 360 shove\nit is pushing the board with your feet\nand letting it spin a full 360 rotation\nunder your feet in the landing back on\nit it's it's a trick that people do on\nusually on flat ground\nI've learned I've learned to do it up on\nthe vert walls like I could do 360 shove\nits kind of in the air\nbut I'm doing that I'm doing a 360 job\nand then I'm landing on my truck\nright like the axle Between the Wheels\non one axle in a what we call a 5-0\nposition which is basically a wheelie on\nthe truck so everything is so precise I\ngot to do 367 at exactly a certain spot\non the wall I've got to catch it so that\nmy truck lands when my foot hits it I\ncan't push it into the truck because\nthat that screws up my balance so it has\nto land on the truck I have to land with\nmy weight perfectly\nset back enough that I can come in\nbackwards because I'm doing this trick\nand and I'm I'm gonna come in fakie\nright 360 show 50 to coming in forward\nis is a whole different Beast that that\nI could probably do that just in a few\ntries but the idea that I have to land\non this thing balance on it like a\nteeter-totter and then reverse my energy\nand come in fakie\nbackwards it's so hard it's so hard to\nto get into the right position so like\nany time I try it\nthere's like a one in ten chance I'm\neven gonna get into the position I need\nand that's the one I have to commit to\nso every time I do it it's so intense\nand it takes so much\nso much commitment and so much\nmind\nI don't even know how to explain it like\nthe the\nthat you have shut everything else out\nexcept this one moment and this one\nfractional\npiece that you have to make work\nand it\nI've done it once and I like I would\nlove to do it again but I know what it's\ngonna it's gonna take the same amount of\neffort I didn't learn from that one that\nI made some trick that makes it happen\nevery time it's all so Technical and\nthere's so many things that can go wrong\nthat all is accepted okay I did it once\nin thinking about the 360 show at 50\nfakie uh\nwas that something that you thought of\nthe night before you decide that day do\nyou ever use visualization have you ever\nhad learning come to you in a dream or\nfind that you try try something went to\nsleep that night next day made it\nanything like that yes sometimes I'll\nwake up the middle of night and I'll\nwrite down something because it was like\noh there's this trick oh I think I could\ndo that yeah okay let me write it down\nso you dream about skateboarding from\ntime to time yeah well yeah that shifted\na bit after I got hurt but yeah I used\nto dream that I can't skate like I'm\ntrying and that it feels like the ramps\nmade of carpet I can't get the speed I\ncan't get the timing and then as I went\nthrough this traumatic injury my dreams\nshifted to wow I can skate I can do all\nmy tricks again oh interesting yeah a\nlittle uh piece of science around the\ncan't uh can't skate piece or when\npeople feel like they're bolted down in\na dream or they can't run away yeah\nthere's this one phase of sleep called\nrapid eye movement sleep where the brain\nis very active the dreams associated\nwith it tend to be very Vivid and at the\nsame time we are completely paralyzed\nand the idea is that no one really knows\nwhy but that it's the case that we're\nparalyzed to prevent us from acting out\nour dreams it's also an interesting\nneurochemical phenomenon because during\nthese rapid eye movement dreams they\ntend to be very intense but the body\ncan't release adrenaline so it's almost\nlike its own form of trauma therapy it's\nlike you're experiencing this intense\nthing in your mind but your body can't\nreact and so oftentimes people uh have\nargued that that's why you feel like you\nwant to move and you can't because\nactually can't yeah some people have\nwoken up while still a bit paralyzed and\nREM have you ever had that happen we\nwake up but actually a couple of my kids\nhave have struggled with that a couple\ntimes yeah REM interference is called\nit's not dangerous and usually people\ncan jolt themselves out but it's kind of\nterrifying so that's interesting so\nwe'll get to a discussion about the the\nrecent injury and thankfully recovery\nfrom the injury not miraculous because\nthat makes it seem as if it's surprising\nfrankly I'm not surprised that you've\nrecovered but it is um spectacular uh\nthe way you have but\nyou're saying that in your dreams before\nthe injury you would think about\nskateboarding but you felt like there\nwas a kind of can't do it when I was\ndoing it in my dream there was always\nsome roadblock that I just cut like why\ncan't I get any speed why can't I why\ncan't I snap or do this trick um it's\nmore in the moments where it's Twilight\nmoments where I'm kind of awake and I'm\nthinking about tricks that everything\nelse Falls away and I can actually focus\non\nwhat kind of new moves to come up with\num\nan example of that was uh\nrecently\nI went to the X Games in Japan a few\nweeks ago and\nI was thinking I was going to go more to\nshow my support and because they had a\nVerge event there's not a lot of bird\nevents anymore so if there's a vert\nevent it's kind of like if you build it\nI will come because I want to show my\nsupport that's that's kind of where my\nheart is\nand they had a best trick event and I\nthought man maybe I could get in the\nbest trick is there anything new though\nyou know and I'm still recovering from\nmy leg and then at some point I was\nfalling asleep and I thought oh I could\ndo that trick and come in 180.\nI know I could do that with with my\ncurrent state and not getting that much\nspeed so\nto explain what I was doing is is a half\ncab body rail to Backside blunt okay we\ncan walk through this half cab has come\nup backwards come with 360. right so\nhalf an hour ago as I approach the top\nof the ramp I body rail that means I\njump around\nand then I jump around on my board and\nthen I make sure that it lands with my\ntwo trucks out and my tail on the coping\nwhich is very precarious\nand I've done that and come in fakey\nbeef that's the blunt piece that's the\nblunt so I've done that right where you\nand then you have to you have to use\nyour B to lift up the board come in\nfakie right I've done that I've done\nthat twice\nand I thought well I wonder if there's\nsomething I could do like that and then\nI realized that if I just keep coming\naround and I come in\nbackside direction that keeps my body\nspinning and that might actually be\neasier\nit wasn't but I figured it out\nI think I saw a clip of this honest I\ndid it yeah I mean I did it I did it X\nGames and I was like it was my last run\nI was it was I mean it didn't move the\nneedle I got seven plays but for me it\nwas a huge moment it felt amazing I bet\noh yeah for sure I mean and it was I\nmean it was like weeks of\npreparation and trying to figure this\nthing out I made it twice before the\nevent\num on my own alone on my ramp but um\nthat's just an example of of you know I\nwas I was literally falling asleep and\nthen all of a sudden I was like\nhalf cup body well back to blunt\nI love it that liminal State between\nwakefulness and sleep is such a\nbeautiful state that if one is open to\nideas showing up there yeah they almost\nalways do I try to start trying it the\nnext morning\ndo you ever find that when you're taking\nwalks or in the shower or not thinking\nabout skateboarding yeah it's usually in\nthe in the sort of mundane moments that\nthat I get inspiration yeah do you have\npractices for Pure relaxation aside from\nsocialization I know I was never\nI think that's something I've been\nlacking I I never was good at warming up\nstretching\npost-warm up\num\nor or or relaxing you know meditation\nnothing I just I I go skate and it's on\num\nand as I've gotten older I realize\nthat's not the best technique but it's\nworked so far it has worked\num so for you it's Go Hopefully a little\nbit of warm up if you I have more of a\nsort of OCD warm-up run\nthat I use to gauge how I'm feeling but\nI kind of have to get through that like\na surgeon when a surgeon's about to do a\nsurgery\num they don't warm up they just check\noff the various boxes of you know this\nis here that's there make sure that\nthey're comfortable in their environment\nand then they do they do the life-saving\nwork yeah yeah I'd say my warm-up run is\nis kind of basic tricks but they give me\na sense of how how stiff or how I what I\nneed to adjust for it for the rest of\nthe day\nso I guess it's not so OCD but it but I\ndefinitely feel like I gotta go through\nthat routine\nwhat feels the best like I I know that\nmaking a new trick\nfeels incredible especially if you've\nbeen at it a long time dialing it in so\nthat you can do it again and again is\nits own form of reward yeah um but what\nis the maybe list of two or three things\nthat just feels so good well that for\nsure learning new tricks not even that\nit's something that I created but just\ndoing something that I've never done\nbefore\nwhen I first learned varials backside\nburials no one had done backside barrels\nbefore they'd only done on the front\nside\num and a variable is where you you reach\ndown grab your board jump in the air and\nthen turn at 180 under your feet it's\nit's like a shove it but you're guiding\nwith your hand\nI learned that halfway up the pool the\nmain pool in a way at oasis with no one\naround and the feeling I got when I rode\naway was something that I had never\nexperienced and then it is it is\nliterally the buzz that I've been\nchasing ever since because it was like I\ncreated something various below coping\nwas that was the button that was it it\nreally was and if you saw a video of it\nyou'd be like that thing like what can I\nsay it was it was the first time that I\nthought\nI thought of it\num I I went through all the Motions of\nit I did the work and I figured it out\nand you know no one no one cared but at\nsome point I was able to do it six feet\nin the air and do a full 360 variable\nand so that was the building block but\nbut that feeling was like no other\num I'd say that and then just even to to\nstrip everything else away like the most\nbasic tricks\nlike a backside Ollie is is an a\nno-handed aerial that used to be what it\nwas called backside no handed Ariel\nit feels so good because even to this\nday people people say how does the boys\nstay on your feet and I can't even tell\nyou how the board sits on my feet I just\nknow\nI know how to maneuver it\nand I know how to keep the pressure on\nit and the friction going and backside\nalways is like\nI think it's like a Marvel of physics\nand and a clean back say to me it feels\ngood as anything yeah it's a beautiful\nthing to behold I confess I've never\ndone a legitimate backside at all I ever\non a mini ramp sure but not on vert so I\ncan't relate to the feeling but I love\nlove love the fact that\nyou brought us back to that early\nvariable below coping feeling and that\nthat marks the essence of what feels so\ngood when you do something else right\nit's sort of like a it's a as a\nneuroscientist I see it as a chemical\nstamp it's like a chemical fingerprint\nof progress right\num\nand I'm also delighted to hear that it\nstill feels that good to do these things\nbecause I don't think anyone can have\nthe kind of lifelong progression that\nyou've had and it's still going uh\nwithout a not just love of the thing but\nlove of the feeling that it brings when\nno one's around because you said Skating\nyour ramp by yourself so how often are\nyou on your ramp with you know no one's\nfilming for Instagram no nothing for a\nvideo nothing for a video game none of\nthat maybe there's you know maybe other\nguys are around gals around we'll talk\nabout gals too because one of the big\nshifts in skateboarding since I started\nis that there's some amazing female\nskateboarders now\num there's a young lady in fact that's\nbeen skateboarding at your ramp forgive\nme I can't remember her name is it Reese\nReese Nelson goodness goodness gracious\nI know she is so yeah good so good so\ngood uh so we'll get back to that but I\nthink that you know people starting any\nkind of sport or academic career or\nbusiness or anything I think people\nassume that you go from zero to a\nhundred somehow and that there are these\npeople that are just selected by\ngenetics or by Locker by some\ncombination of things to just like get\nit and be better than everybody else but\nit's clear that you've spent a lot of\ntime alone driving someplace to skate\nthe next day or alone at the ramp yeah\nor um so do you ever reflect on that\nkind of Drive\num and you know what what what that's\nall about or is it just so intrinsic to\nwho you are innate I don't I don't think\nabout it I just know I have to do it\nit's like\nI mean I I we can get into it with my\ninjury but um\nuh but but to go back to what you're\nsaying is you're saying that people\nthink that oh you were chosen for this\nor genetics whatever have you saw your\nlast names\nyeah when I first started skating there\nwas no way you'd think that I was\nnatural or that I had any future in it I\nwas all gangly I was all over the place\nI was eating left and right like it\njust it wasn't I wasn't good I wasn't\nI wasn't a natural\num I've seen people that are Naturals\nand I've seen that how they don't have\nthat drive they don't have the\ndiscipline and\nit's not wasted but\nthey just don't they don't utilize they\ndon't take advantage of what they have\nnaturally and and for whatever reason I\ndon't I don't fault anyone for it\num but I've seen both sides of it and\nI've also seen other skaters who are\njust driven and who are not really good\nkind of sloppy and become the best\nAndrew Reynolds\noh yeah when we put him on our team\nhe was just like me super gangling his\nboards bouncing around but he's trying\nevery single trick and every time he\nsend me a video you know some new\ntechnique that he's figured out and he\ndidn't really\nby the untrained eye he didn't have the\nskill set for\nand then he became the boss\nyou know what I mean so I think it's\njust you you have to you have to give\nthat as much weight as natural tone\nif not more I'd say more yeah I would\ncertainly say more for Science and you\nknow that people were in the lab late at\nnight and early in the morning and\ndrilling away not not always the\nsmartest certainly not the um dumbest\nbut smart enough to show up when other\npeople are leaving and continue and I\nthink there has to be a little bit of\nfriction internally I mean you know\nmaybe maybe externally also but just\nsome friction some I'm gonna show you\nyeah yes\nokay my best example of that and I\nhaven't talked about this yet\num because I did it privately but\nI I broke my leg doing a mixed with\nsomething that I've done thousands of\ntimes in my 40. 540. yeah so it's it's a\none and a half spin in the backside\nDirection but that particular grab that\nyou do makes it a Twist because it makes\nyou kind of flip upside down so it's\nkind of a one and a half somersault\nI it's not my tricks Mike McGill's trick\nI learned it not long after he created\nit in 1984. been doing it ever since\nI mean I'm talking about 40 Years of me\ntwist right I've gotten hurt once or\ntwice but not bad\nanyway I around and found out\ndid one with no speed\nlast year thinking I could do it like I\nwas still 20 and got tangled up and\nbroke my femur\nI had a super long recovery I had a\nfalse start I had a non-union fracture\nwhich means my bone never connected back\nto itself and it kept pushing itself\nfurther away\num and that's all uh in the past I've\ngot a second surgery in November and all\nalong in the back of my head is I got to\nget back to 540s I have to\nand I can't explain why I have to I hate\nthat it means that much to me\nbut it it's in here\nyou know I mean it's not it's not a\nsense of Pride it's not like I have to\nprove this to anyone I just have to do\nit\nand last week I did it\nit was\nso scary\nand I prepped for it I\nI mean even down to like my diet and I I\nstopped drinking altogether and I was\nlike every time I go to the ramp I'm\njust trying 540s like to get the spin to\nget the to get the landing Zone with no\nintention to make yet just that I had to\nget there and then I had to have this\nheart to heart with my wife that\nyou know she doesn't want to see me get\nhurt she doesn't see me risking myself\nat this age anymore she doesn't want to\nlive through another traumatic injury\nwith me\nand\nI had to tell her like I have to do this\nshe was gracious and accepting and\nthat's all I could ask for\nit wasn't like she was like yeah you got\nto go do it it was like okay\nthat's who you are\nand so she was there she was my only\nspectator\nso good I confess I've seen a video of\nthis and my first response was\num f yes\nand my second response was that was\nreally high like this is no you know\njust above coping 540. this isn't even\nyou know this is a head high 540. I'm\nnot gonna make the same mistake I did\nlast time where I tried it low thinking\nI just get away with it anymore so the\ngoing high was more of a safety measure\nwhich is ironic\nthe the bigger the ramps for me the\nsafer it is because I have a better\nLanding Zoom I have more time in the air\nto adjust\nand even though it looks spectacular and\nMusic Experience it's just like no I\nneed that\nI can't skate some eight foot pool I\nhave no Landing zone I'm Too Tall I'm\ntoo I move too slowly now to do that\nkind of stuff\nso that's why you don't see me like in\nthe Park events and stuff like that you\nknow you're going to see me on this\n14-foot boat ramp because that's my\nhappy place and that's where I'm safe\num but also having my wife there I just\nknew I wasn't gonna get hurt in front of\nher\nbecause I would have been such trouble\nthe the emotional support and pressure\nis uh is a real thing and in the best\nways uh not to focus on the bad aspects\nof the injury because there are planning\nyeah that I recall you and I\ncommunicated not long after the let's\nsay let's call it what it was the first\nbreak\nand I remember you said to me over text\nyou said how long before I'm\nskateboarding again and I said\num skateboarding as in pushing or\nskateboarding as in\num what you do on vert you know and you\nsaid uh what I do on vert and I said\nwell it seems you are doing a lot of\nthings you were doing deliberate cold\ndelivery heat pressure you do a number\nof things I mean you're not haphazard\nabout your career and your body and your\nhealth we'll get into that a little bit\nlater some of the things that you've\nenjoyed as beneficial for you but\num you said I'm calling it at two months\nand I said okay\num I believe it and then I recall that\nyou was it the Oscars or some other\naward event where you came out about a\nweek later you came out there uh you\nwalked out this broken femur and you\nweren't using any support to walk out so\nyou clearly ditched whatever support you\nmight have been using uh which I think\nis Awesome by the way\num and then pretty soon I was seeing\nvideos of you dropping in I'm seeing\nvideos of you doing kick turns below\ncoping I'm seeing videos of you at\ncoping and you know we have a friend in\ncommon the skateboard and generally\nphotographer Mike blaback and I remember\ntexting Mike I was like Tony's back\nalready this is this is superhuman rates\nof healing and I think it is super human\nrates of healing\nthen you mentioned that you\ndamaged broke broke the femur again so\ndid you allow more rest the second time\nwhat was driving you to get back in it\nso quickly the first go-around I just\ndidn't listen to any\nof the professional advice because I\nthought well I've done I've come this\nfar and I've always been able to push\nthrough\nbroken pelvis broken elbow\num knee surgeries and I've always been\nthe timeline is always very shortened\nfor me because I just get back out there\nand I and I get the healing started but\nI also am comfortable with what people\nthink is extremely risky but\nin this instance\nI want to get back out there right away\nand not long after the Academy Awards\nuh I was actually walking with a cane at\nthat time and I ditched the cane just to\nwalk out on stage to present the award\nso that was my big\nmy big coming out moment but it was kind\nof forced and as soon as I walked out to\nstay they grabbed my cane and I was\nhobbling in the backstage\num but I was\nI was skating kind of a mini ramp and\nand I was already\nstruggling because I couldn't put my\nweight on my front foot because my bones\nstill had not connected to itself so\nthere's a gap in the bone but there's a\nthere's a nail what they call a nail or\nyou know big piece of metal that's\nholding them in place but I didn't\nrealize how careful I needed to be with\nthat because it was so precarious\nand I decided I'm going to drop in on\nthe mini ram like I think I'm ready and\nand it wasn't the drop in on the main\nramp it was me getting to the top of the\nmini ramp and stepping off my board\nthat's always that kind of stuff but but\nI just stepped off my board like I would\ndo any other day but I didn't think I\nled with my front foot and I felt the\nbone move in that moment\nI I really I felt it I felt it either\ntwist or get out of place\nand I was in total denial\nfor months\nbecause I just said oh I just it just\nhurts now like I you know I I got a\nminor setback\nand then I finally\neight months into my recovery seven\nmonths into my recovery I was always in\npain my skating wasn't progressing I\ncouldn't get speed\nand by all measures I should be back at\nleast I'd be back to a level that I feel\ngood about\nand I went and got x-rays and they said\nyour bone never connected you have a\nnon-union fracture and and and and every\ntime I skated so my bones like this\nevery time I skated I was pushing it\nfurther away\nand so my bone was like this on the last\nX-ray and and that was the hard truth so\nfor those listening just laterally\ndisplaced think about a pipe that's\nbroken in the middle and just one's\noffset to the other and and as I keep\nskating and I I could force my skin like\nI kind of learned this hack where I can\nput 75 of my weight on my back foot and\n25 of my front foot and do what I wanted\nto do but it wasn't where I thought I'd\nbe\nand it just hurt all the time I mean it\nreally was like that was my trigger\nbecause I I have a pretty\nhigh tolerance to pain and\nit was always her like I I would dread\ngoing to the airport knowing I had to\nwalk to a gate\nso I knew something was wrong there I\nwent to a specialist\num that deals in non-union fractures and\nhe had a very pragmatic factual approach\nand it was like oh I would do this I'm\ntaking that nail out and take the other\nHardware out and put it together and you\ncannot move for two months\ndid you obey that at work I did really\nyeah so what what is chilling I was not\ngoing to risk that again did you um and\ndo you prioritize things like sleep\num nutrition\num just you know generally and did you\nemphasize those things while you were\nrecovering from the injury yeah I I was\nvery disciplined in my diet in my\nschedule and my sleep\num surprisingly I I was very busy\nbecause\num I do speaking engagements and\nsuddenly my speaking engagements were\ngetting booked left and right\nI mean to the point where I did a tour\nthrough Europe Last Summer\nof speaking engagement so that was that\nwas a silver lining I guess to my my\nidle time\num and I leaned into it you know I made\nmyself available and\nand uh it you know it's good money and\nit was it's fun to to interact and\num but all through all through that of\ncourse in the back of my head I was like\nwhen when can I skate when can I skate\nand then when I finally started skating\nit was night and day with my leg I felt\nlike I could lean forward\nsuddenly I was learning tricks every\nevery session relearning tricks\num so I just I'm just lucky that I got\nto live in this time of modern medicine\nwas that two months the longest you've\never gone without skateboarding vert\nyeah\nyeah without skating at all\nnot even just pushing around\nyeah good for you for obeying doctor's\norders and also finally and also good\nfor you for deciding that your rate of\nrecovery is going to be whatever it is\nfor you because I feel like I'm hearing\nboth things on the one hand you listen\nto the medical professionals on the\nother hand I'm not hearing oh you know I\nlooked at the average rate of recovery\nfrom this kind of fracture this and that\nit's it's like it's as if you decided\ntwo things at once that there are\nexperts who have something to offer me\nhere I'll follow their advice and yet\nI'm the expert at myself here I'm\nputting myself in your first person uh\nTony's the expert in Tony and\nI'm going to make sure that I come back\n100 yeah or better\nyeah not better but um and I've and I\nhave come to terms with that\nbecause I know that I'm not going to be\npushing myself the way that I did before\nI got hurt anymore\nthere are some tricks now that are way\nmore difficult just because whatever\nsomething changed in my body and for\ninstance I can't grab slob like I can't\nI I can't do it consistently that used\nto be my go-to grab you could do that\nanytime over 60 foot gaps whatever like\nI could I just grab I knew where my\nboard was I knew that was going to hold\non to my feet and half the time I try to\ngrab that way now I don't reach it or I\ngrab my foot instead and I I don't know\nI can't make the adjustment to fix it\nand so I've just sort of come to terms\nwith well that's not the go-to grab\nanymore\nand that's okay I had a good run yeah\nyour kid's pretty pretty uh vast so\nthere's a lot of other things to reach\ntoo aside from the 540 which by the way\ncongratulations not only is it a 540 but\nuh done at least head high I've seen it\nwith my own eyes and um and under really\ngreat circumstances your wife there just\nthe two of you and after and the trick\nthat broke the femur in the first place\nyeah so um congratulations on that thank\nyou I'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge our sponsor inside tracker\ninside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that

are\nthere other things that you you're\nthinking you know can't wait to get back\nto that let's set aside slaw bears for\nnow yeah\num\nyeah I I want to get my hand plants back\nthe way I used to do them yeah I have\nyet yeah it's so invert like it's\none-handed handstand\num I can do them now but I've seen you\ndo them recently yeah but but I used\nthey used to be my signature it was a\ntucking Amber and flopped all the way\nback and and I can't get a hold of my\nboard to pull it all the way back like I\nused to\num if I can get that I'll feel like\nthat's it that's that's that was the\nlast Milestone I'm not here to uh\ndiagnose and treat these uh specific uh\nskateboard trick isms but between your\nwhat you said about the slob air and\nwhat you're saying about this seems like\nthey're same thing about about getting\nyour your your front hand around and\naround pulling it back back in uh behind\nyou so maybe this is like the way that\nthe femur is lining up with your pelvis\nand maybe some off-ramp something or\nother Physical Therapy could do I'm\nactually working with um at best core he\nis a he is a doctor of physical therapy\nand he has helped me immensely through\nmy recovery and when I'm frustrated with\nthis motion or that's the same grab\nactually as in the twist\nhe worked on me before it and was just\ncontorting my body and my leg into these\npositions that\nI don't really even get to when I'm\nskating just to prepare me for that and\nhe did but that's what it took\nit's interesting that we're talking\nabout skateboarding and we're also\ntalking about physical therapists we're\ntalking about nutrition we're talking\nabout sleep so growing up means like\nnone of that none of that never imagined\nany of this and I'm chuckling because\nyou know growing up in skateboarding\num early on for me uh not quite as early\nas you but pretty early 12\num and got out of it and back and yes I\ncan still do a thing or two uh here and\nthere um but that's not the point the\npoint is that you know the nutrition\nconsisted largely of you know fast food\nor whatever was around\ncigarettes and beer were sort of the the\nenergy drinks and uh uh and um\nsupplements of of the times this is\nfortunately changed but there there was\nessentially no\nHealth promoting tools or aspects to it\nat all but that was back then but then\nover time it seems It's evolved like now\nI see um I saw a couple posts from\nStevie Williams like he's in the gym\nsure um I think I saw Danny Way early on\nworking with Paul check and doing some\nbalance work neck work because he had\nbroken his neck surfing and things of\nthat sort so there seems to have been a\nbig shift over the last 15 20 years\nwhere skateboarders are taking good care\nof their bodies like other athletes\nthinking about the resilience of their\nbodies and also generally taking better\ncare like a lot of them opt not to drink\nand do drugs and all those sorts of\nthings so I mean how does it strike you\nto see the way that skateboarding has\nevolved towards the option to be much\nhealthier and treat it like a like a\nserious sport where you're a serious\nathlete a word that you know even 15\nyears ago 20 years ago if you called a\nskip order an athlete some people might\neven be offended by oh yeah people in\nskateboarding right absolutely yeah\num\nwell to answer your question in the\nearly days\nthat was part of the the scene and the\nculture just because the the it was the\nantithesis to organize team sports\nand mainstream culture and so it was\njust like yeah this is what we do\nit who cares like we drank and we skate\nand everyone it was it was Wild West\nright\nbut as I never fell into that deeply\nbecause I saw how it affected people's\nperformances and the skating itself was\nParamount to me that is what I want to\nfocus on that's what I want to be good\nat and I saw people partying and\npartying their skills away so I had at\nleast that forethought\num and then as scanning got more\nestablished popular\nmore of a career option than people\nstarted taking it more seriously\nespecially competitors I mean and and\nbut there's such a wide swath of of what\nskateboarding is and it's a big tent so\nto say that it's more organized yes it's\nmore organized over here there's still\nall these skaters over here partying\nhopping fences\ndon't care about contests don't want\nsponsors oh like GX 1000 like those kids\nat bomb Hills in San Francisco like like\nbut that that's what I love about it is\nthe diversity of it all and that that's\nwe're all part of this scene so\nI I was a competitor that was that was\nmy path to success and so I appreciate\nthat people take it more seriously now\nand that they do have trainer they have\nresources I mean they have sponsors that\nwill pay for this kind of stuff\nthere was no such thing I mean like at\nour biggest skate contest we were all\nstaying at Stacy Peralta's parents house\nthe night before and he would take us\nout to get spaghetti because he thought\ncarbohydrates was going to give us\nenergy the next day that was the extent\nof training in 1983.\nright but nowadays it we're treated like\nHigh Elite athletes because they are\nlike if you really look at people that\nare at the top of their field people\nlike Niger Houston\nyou know what I mean like the dude is a\nmachine he is\nhe is one of the most precise skaters\nthat we've ever seen or precise athletes\nthis side of Nadia coming each\nyou know yes I'm I'm I'm aging myself\nbut\nwhat I'm saying is like this is this is\ntakes hardcore dedication Precision\nathleticism and\ndevotion and so now they have the\nresources to back that up and to keep it\ngoing longer I mean yeah would I be able\nto do this now especially after getting\nhurt without the help of a doctor of\nphysical training\nprobably not\nI'd do it on some level but I wouldn't\nget to where I am now\num and so hey I think it's awesome I you\nknow I I never I never wanted to covet\nskateboarding as this thing that no one\nelse could like a gatekeeper to it no\none else can touch it I always thought\nthere was something to skateboarding\nthat was magical and that was good for\nmental health and that was\nthat was required such\num\nrequired such passion\nand I didn't I never understood why I\ndidn't get bigger through those those\nleaning years it was always like kids\nthis speaks to kids like it's Daredevil\nand it's active and it's exciting and\nyou can do it as a group but you can do\nit your own way and I don't know all\nthose things it took a long time for\neveryone else to figure it out they\ndefinitely figured it out I mean\nnowadays skaters are the cool kids in\nschool yeah it's in the Olympics like\nthere was always discussion would it be\nit was an exhibition sport in the\nOlympics at one point no uh no no oh I\nthought it was it for maybe it had a run\nit potentially being an exhibition there\nwere there was talk about it got it um\nbut it never did and and not that I mean\nat some point especially in the late 90s\nor 2000s\nskating\nwas getting appreciated and and kind of\nreached that threshold of of is it\nmainstream well it's in it's all\nMcDonald's commercials so I guess that's\npretty mainstream and so we already had\ncome of age and it was like we don't\nneed the Olympics\nwe're already more popular than\na lot of Olympic sports right so why do\nwe need their validation and then at\nsome point it became like the the power\nDynamic shifted and it was like oh they\nneed our cool Factor\nwe don't need their validation\nand I was like yeah okay you guys want\nit sure\ngo ahead but hold the events hold the\nqualifiers\nwe'll participate\nbut\nwe don't need this\nwell you've been an amazing Ambassador\nfor the sport that's driven so much of\nthat wider acceptance and progression\nand invitation into different domains\none of the um things that I definitely\nwant to talk about is the video game\nright because I think that the video\ngame changed a lot of things for the\ngeneral public in terms of their\nperception of skateboarding I mean what\nit allowed of course is this is obvious\nbut it allowed kids that weren't going\nto you know um bang up their shins or\nwalk in with a broken wrist or you know\nall skinned up too to do incredible\ntricks but in silico on a screen right\nand to\nand pretend that they are the the pro\nskateboarder that's essentially what\nwhat video games are about And yet when\nyou can see something just like you can\nimagine it in a dream or while you're\nfalling asleep and you can see something\nand and hear an air quotes do something\nin a video game it also is going to\ninspire a number of kids to go outside\nand grab a real skateboard and try that\nor try something like that so clearly\nthe video game was a catalyst for what I\nconsider now the the wide acceptance of\nskateboarding as a sport in all its\nvarious forms\num could you just talk for a little bit\nabout the Genesis of the video game were\nyou into video games prior to the video\ngame\num were you into technology generally\nand and what sort of motivated the\ninterest in the video game because it\ncertainly has changed the face of actual\nskateboarding and the perception of\nskateboarding\num well I've been into video games since\nthe gecko I mean I was a kid you know\nplaying pong Pac-Man Missile Command\nQbert you name it and then getting the\nhome systems in television Super NES\nCommodore 64.\num\nSega yeah but but I um and I always love\ntechnology so when I when I finally\nstarted making money in the 80s my first\nkind of big purchase in terms of that\nuh in in terms of electronics was uh\nCommodore Amiga\nwhich was considered one of the highest\nend uh home computers you know alongside\nMac but but more graphic oriented and\nand more game-oriented\num and so I was always into that idea\nthat you could do this kind of stuff at\nhome not just in arcades\nand then I gotta I got a call from a PC\nprogrammer that wanted to pitch a skate\ngame and had a crude engine of um a\nskater that would cruise around go in\nbowls and stuff like that and it was all\nkeyboard controlled it was clunky but it\nwas something and the last thing that we\nhad as skating was\n720 in the arcade or a skate or die for\nhome systems for Commodore 64. that was\nlike the last thing that had happened\nfor skateboarding\num in video games and so I went with him\nI was excited to get like I got to\nwe got to go to Nintendo and Pitch it\num we went to Midway you know we went to\nall these different uh console and\nsoftware manufacturers\nand were just told that this is a bad\nidea skateboarding is not popular\nhome video games are barely a thing why\nwould anyone want to buy a video game\nabout skateboarding\nsomeone said those exact words to me\num at Midway\nand so he got frustrated and he needed\nto find a job and I was I was just kind\nof free-floating so I said okay he goes\nwell I'm gonna I'm not going to do this\nbut I feel like you've established\nyourself at least in the Video Game\nWorld uh industry that you're interested\nin doing something so maybe if someone\ndoes something they'll call you and I\nwas like yeah right sure sure enough\nlike a year later Activision called me\nand they said hey we heard you want to\ndo a video game I said well yes I would\nlove to work on a video game I'm not a\nprogrammer or anything so we have\nsomething we're working on and we'd like\nto show it to you and so I went up to\nActivision\num they were working on a skate game but\nit was based on an engine of a game that\nwas already released called apocalypse\nstarring Bruce Willis so the first\nversion of my game was Bruce Willis on a\nskateboard\nwith a gun shot to his back\nin a desert Wasteland doing kickflips\nand it was awesome it was it was truly\nlike I picked it up and I got past that\nVisual and then I started playing it and\nand it was intuitive it the motion felt\nright the engine was right and I was\nlike this is\nthis is the Baseline of something\nspecial\nI didn't think it was going to be some\nbig hit I just thought this is this is\ngoing to be appreciated by skateboarders\nand that was my goal the entire uh\ndevelopment process which was about a\nyear and a half after I signed on we\nthrough that year and a half we were\ngoing back and forth with they would\nthey would FedEx me builds on CDs I had\na modified PlayStation and I would play\nit make notes and I thought man skater\nwas going to dig this and that was it\nand skating wasn't even that popular it\nwas coming to you know it was starting\nto get some traction what year was this\nagain like 98 so it was like X Games\nwere starting to come into the fold\npeople were taking note of what\nskateboarding had become at that point\nand then I thought this is going to be\ncool skater's gonna like it and then\num\nnot long before the release\nthey called me and they said hey we want\nto um we want to offer you a buyout of\nfuture royalties for this game\num because I think you know there's I\nthink people are going to like it I was\nlike what does that mean they go we'll\ngive you a half a million dollars and\nthen you don't get royalties going\nforward but you get that money up front\nand\nat that time my life like to hear\nsomeone say half a million dollars\nseriously sounded like a half a billion\ndollars\nlike no one had ever\ntalked about numbers that big to me well\nalso 98 was a little bit of a of a quiet\ntime for verts skateboarding too right\nsure yeah but yeah for yeah\nluckily vert skating\nstill was a thing because of inline\nskating\nbecause inline skating was huge right\nlate 90s and they were all vert and so\nwe as skaters got to sort of ride those\ncoattails because it was like Hey There\nare boat ramps because everyone's\nrollerblading I forgot about that that\ndid like and I have honestly like I was\nthe special guest at a couple of inline\nrollerblade shows where it was like this\nis what team rollerblade live and\nspecial guest Tony Hawk the skateboarder\nand I was like hey all right dropping in\nbut it paid the bills yeah\num so to answer to like to to\nperform what you're saying bird skating\nwas\nit was a thing at least established in\nthe X Games\nwhich was something and enough for us to\nmake a living\num so when they offer me this money\nI actually was in a pretty good place\num in terms of\nmy I don't know my options my my\ntrajectory and I felt like and I I had\njust bought a new home and I thought I'm\ngonna take a chance and to see what\nhappens\nand like that was the best financial\ndecision I ever met took the equity\nyeah I just let it ride I was like no I\nwant to see what happens with this and\nas soon as the game was released it was\ngetting\nStellar reviews and then I remember like\nthe very next week after it was released\nnever stopped saying okay we're working\non number two what do you want to do\nlike what do you mean\nwell yeah we're doing SQL which what\nawesome and then we ended up doing like\n10.\namazing crazy amazing\nI'm thinking about your decision to not\ntake the cash and to see how it would go\nI'm thinking about your decision to buy\na car at 16 and yet as a consequence get\npulled over because you look younger\num I'm thinking about the time when\nthrough the graciousness of your parents\nwho took me in because I had no money to\nget back up to Northern California and\nthey couldn't get a hold of my mom\num they took me to your home but then\nthey took me to where you were living\nthe next day which was in Fallbrook you\ndon't remember this but I do and I know\nyou've heard this story before so\nforgive me because most people listening\nhaven't but I remember getting driven up\nto Fallbrook you had the ramps in your\nbackyard\nI walked in got introduced to you you\nwere very gracious said hello what's up\nI said feel free to push around on the\nramps outside it was the mini it was a\nspine ramp yeah\num two ramps back to back folks it's\nfine uh sorry nomenclature\num I think Ray Underhill was there\nyeah he lived there for a while yeah and\nas I recall you had\num pretty vast music collection and\nwe'll talk about music\num but it also seemed there was a couple\ncars in the driveway and whatnot but\nit's clear to me based on a number of\nthings and that interaction and what I\nobserved there that either you had\nsomeone in your ear either your dad or\nyour mom or both or maybe it had been\nStacy or maybe it was somebody else who\nwas advising you to make very good\nfinancial decisions like not spend all\nyour money or continue to spend all your\nmoney\num to invest in things you know or maybe\nit was just instilled in you at a young\nage who knows\nI'm asking because I think so many\npeople burn their early success you know\nwhat represents a lot of wealth for them\nearly on they burn that where they start\nmaking just bad decisions you explained\nbefore why you tended to avoid drugs and\nalcohol and certainly um any severe\nrelationship to drugs or alcohol that\nwould keep you from progressing and\nskateboarding but you know the ability\nto make really good decisions as a young\nfamous athlete\nis more rare than it is common\neven when people have coaches so I'm\ncurious you know where did that um\nshrewdness and that Prudence come from\nand was Frank your dad and maybe Nancy\nalso you know advising you all along\nlike hey you know\num think smart be smart because clearly\nyou've made some some very smart\ndecisions um he was definitely\na guide in it he he was the first one\nwho said you should probably\nbuy real estate I was 17 so I didn't\neven know that was possible but he\nco-signed made it possible\num but then after that I ended up buying\nthat home that you went to and it was\nfour acre property and we built these\nramps on it and that was amazing and\ndefinitely helped Propel my skating to a\ndifferent level than I ever imagined but\nat some point that was just a drain and\nit was a drain financially and I was\nliving beyond my means and my income\nkept dropping because we're talking\nabout not long after that was 91 92 the\nslowest days of skating and I've got\nthis giant mortgage\nand I've got this property and these\nramps that I can't afford to upkeep I\ncan barely afford my water bill at one\npoint you know and so\nwhat you saw might have seemed stable\nbut behind the scenes it was it was\nstarting to unravel birdhouse hadn't\nbeen started birdhouse was started in 92\nand when I started birdhouse I took the\nequity from that house to start it\nbecause I didn't I burned through my\nsavings from trying to keep this place\ngoing\num so I took a second mortgage out on\nthat house right I took my Equity out\nstarted birdhouse sold the house for\nwhat I had taken out and then moved to\nmy original place that I had when I was\nin high school and just\npulled back on expenses I think that was\nthat was when I really became shrewd\nbecause I had to I had I had a first\nchild\nI had an income that was very uncertain\nvery fluctuating and I was just eating\nTaco Bell and Top Ramen and peanut\nbutter jelly sandwiches and and\nnot spending anything and and taking\nevery job\nlike the most random demo requests or we\nwant you to be a consultant on this\ncommercial because I'm too old I'm 24.\nI'm too old to be the guy skating\nbecause it has to be youth right but\nthey're like well we want to see what's\npossible so can you come up the day\nbefore and show us the ropes and so I\nwould be the stunt skater\nthat's filling in to show them the\nAngles and stuff and then they would go\nhigher Chet Thomas\nas the young kid\nand then I would stand around I was\ngetting paid I didn't care I think I\nremember those commercials It Was a\nSerial commercial something like that uh\nthe serial commercial was uh Chris\nMiller Frosted Flakes right and I was\nTony the Tiger\nguys you chat uh yes\num I throughout the birdhouse which is\nyour company but without telling people\nwhat is a skateboard company I remember\nuh Willie Santos was early on I remember\nhis super nice kid I used to see him at\nthe contest I remember thinking well\nTony Hawk has his own company for\nskateboarders we had a team you know\nlike willy willy was a maestro\num Jeremy Klein legendary Street Pioneer\nuh Steve Berra who's kind of a we called\nit ATV but Street and vert\num we had uh ocean Howell it was like\nour number one amateur we had Andrew\nReynolds Matt Beach\num we had a team it was full on was it\nfun to move from Ryder to also Ryder but\nteam manager owner was it fun it just it\nwas just necessary\nI can't say it was fun I mean yeah it\nwas it was fun because we were still\njust\nkind of Reckless and\ndriving you know six of us in a van\ndriving to skate shops across the\ncountry and\nbegging them for 300 bucks so that we\ncould get gas and food in the hotel room\nand\nget on our way\num\nI don't know it just it but for me it\njust felt like a necessity to keep to to\nthat was what I had to do to make a\nbrand happen\nand so I was willing to do it\num and but\nit was exhausting\nyeah because I had to be the\nhad to be the the coach\nand the tour manager\nand the skater\nyou know I was putting myself out there\non like the worst conditions\nand just rolling my ankle left and right\nand it was and it was all Street and it\nwas just wasn't my thing it was it was\nhard but I just I loved it it made it\nhappen in my mind I'm thinking you had\nto be Tony Hawk the skateboarder Frank\nHawk the organizer yeah and Stacy\nPeralta the yeah because Stacy had been\na pro skateboarder I still think of him\nas a skateboarder yeah even though he's\nfilmmaker right skateboard just like I\nstill think of Spike Jones's\nskateboarder bmxer filmmaker\num seems like you had to integrate all\nof those\nand I mentioned that because\nI am curious I think a lot of people are\nprobably curious like are you the type\nof person like sit back in a chair at\nnight and think like okay like how I'm\ngonna do this I mean are you\ncontemplative or is it really you just\nidentify what needs to be done this year\nand over the next three years and you\nknow set your Milestones kind of short\nin I guess so now we're back then back\nthen\noh no everything was just in the moment\nwe got to get here\nwe got to get to Dallas by tomorrow\nlike as soon as this Demo's over getting\nthe van we're going\num we gotta get a hotel room\nyou know it was just stuff like that it\nwas it was very much but but I I\nrespected I think I learned to respect\num\npunctuality\nbecause I travel with playing at skaters\nthat were not and didn't care and show\nup late and was like dude and like I\ndon't know these guys and then when I\nwas in charge it was like we're going to\nbe on time because we have to respect\nother people's time\nand we said we're going to be here at\nthree o'clock we're going to be there\nthree o'clock\num and\nthat's not easy with a skate crew\nMike blaback who as you know is it's a\ngirl to the Hebrew and Lab podcast I\ntalk about that we've got some other\num guys that came over from DC to as\nfilmers and editors for us and you know\nthey're so punctual and they're so on it\nand I notice you showed up early today\nright right on timer early\num early by five minutes\num and that is a distinguishing factor I\nthink in any occupation but especially\nin skateboarding where there's this kind\nof looseness sure and so if you do show\nup on time it really means a lot\num the professionalism that you know was\ninstilled in you it's it's clear that\ndifferent places where that's showing up\nmentioned the shrewdness about the\nbusiness decisions I'm curious about\nanother aspect of that which is maybe a\nlittle more cryptic which is you know\nwhether or not it was the CD collection\nthat I saw or your mentioned of the car\nyou're just in video games it seems that\none thing that you've done that a lot of\nguys that I knew because back then by\nthe way it was mostly guys now so we\nsaid they're women doing it too\num women and girls\nit seems like you have a lot of other\nhobbies and interests music and Etc but\nthat we never heard about you getting\nlike distracted or pulled down those\nlines like we didn't hear about you\ngoing and surfing and getting hurt hurt\nsurfing so that you couldn't skate we're\ngetting really into motorcycles or race\nracing cars right you know um some\npeople went hard left out of\nskateboarding into that like Ken Block\nthe late great Ken Block but that became\nhis main thing seems like you you knew\nthat skateboarding was the main frame\nand stayed with that\num and yet you have a lot of other\ninterests yeah I think I I well\nwith other sports especially\nlike Motocross I I have this huge\nrespect for Motocross I think it's super\nexciting I would love to do it and I\nknow that I would not Escape unscathed\nlike I would definitely want to learn\nthe tricks\ndo whips and flips and whatever and I'm\ngonna get hurt and I I don't want to\nrisk my skate career for that so I I\npurposely pulled away from that type of\nthing\num the last knee surgery I had is\nbecause I overshot a jump in Mammoth on\nmy snowboard so that was a lesson I was\nlike don't what are you doing just\nCruise why yeah stay on the ground right\nhit the powder right you know free ride\nwith your Bros because I learned my\nlesson and so so yeah you're right but\nat the same time like I still I still\nlove going surfing and snowboarding I\ndon't do them as much obviously\num but but those are part of of what I\ndid all growing up\num and they're important to me\num I did you know do a couple of\ncelebrity car races like a NASCAR race\nand\num I totaled a car in the Long Beach\nGrand Prix\nbecause this dude ramming to the wall\nand it was like well that was fun but\nI'm not\nI don't I don't have the bandwidth to\nget that serious about it and now you\nhave a family of course too so of course\nyeah I mean and and those things as fun\nas they are and as as\nI don't know\num\nas sort of auxiliary as as they are they\nrequire a lot of time\nI mean just for instance that Long Beach\nGrand Prix they want you to go stay in\nPalmdale for like a week and a half and\ntrain\nand and figure out how to truly know how\nto drive and be safe and it's like I\ndon't know I ain't got time for that\nyeah that's time you're not\nskateboarding or with your family right\nyeah right now I feel the same way if I\nget pulled away from Reading papers and\nprepping podcasts and\nreading the latest research and thinking\nabout experiments we could do then I for\nmore than a couple of days I started\nfeeling the itch I have a feeling this\nstuff is programmed into one's nervous\nsystem after a while like you've been\nskateboarding for so long that if you go\na few days\nit probably just your system is is\nwater or something oh yeah for sure I\nmean\num well just for instance uh our ramp is\nuh being torn down on Sunday today is\nFriday our Ram is being turned on on\nSunday at 10 A.M to be moved to Salt\nLake City for our big bird event\nI'm going there at 8 30.\nso I can get a session before I can\nstart down I love it on Father's Day\nthat's my father's day I'm going to work\nat 8 30 a.m on Sunday I love it\nspeaking of family and lineage uh tell\nus about your kids you've got some\ntalented skateboarders in your family\nbesides yourself I do um well I have\nfour of my own and I have two step kids\nand um they all skate my daughter not so\nmuch anymore but all the boys five boys\nuh are all really into it\num my oldest son is the most uh\nhe's the most prominent because he\nturned Pro\num and has I mean\nyou know has his own following has a\nname for himself uh Riley and he's 30.\nyeah he kills it on Street he's a big\nstreet skateboarder he does yeah um but\nthat you know they're they're all good\nthey're all good skaters in their own\nways and uh\nit's so fun I mean I I I didn't of\ncourse they're surrounded by it their\nwhole life especially Riley because when\nhe was young I I didn't really have the\nmeans to have child care whatever so I\njust said take him with me on tourism\nand whatnot so he was always around it\nso he got good at it by default but at\nsome point started to shy away from him\nbecause he felt the pressure and My\nShadow and it was like I don't this\nisn't fun I don't people expect me to be\nsuper good or I have to do this stuff\nand so he went shied away from it but\nthen found\na bunch of his friends in high school\nthey love skating he's still good at us\nso he that he found his crew and they've\nall found their Crews\nuh completely independent of me and so\nwhen we go on vacation\nfor instance we we were last year we\nwere in uh or two years ago we were on\nthe big on Hawaii they want to go to Ski\nparks\nI don't want to go to the skate parks\nI'm on vacation it's also a little harsh\nstuff it's a great way to get hurt right\nwhat's that over in Hawaii it's all\nweather worn oh yeah and it's not even\nmy scene but but then so I go I'm I'm so\nI'm their chauffeur and I'm their Filmer\nI love it that's my vacation but but\nbecause they all love it so much you\nknow what I mean and it just it's so\ncool like I mean how could I ever ask\nfor more it's amazing\nlet's talk about Frank and Nancy a\nlittle bit just because I have this kind\nof odd connection to your family through\nthose uh it's really two or three day\ninteraction changed my life forever\nmeeting you was spectacular as a young\nskateboarding kid but also just the idea\nthat someone would literally take me\ninto their home I mean they had every\nreason to not trust me first of all I\nwas hanging out with Billy Waldman no\nexplanation needed the people who knew\nBilly I hope he's doing well I haven't\nheard anything about him but hope he's\ndoing well\num but we were wild but he basically\ntook me into your home he and Nancy took\nme in\num you know fed us\num or fed me\num I had another friend with me\num and you know it I just have to\nsay as you're describing your family I\ncan only imagine what it must have been\nlike for Frank and Nancy to see you have\nyour kids did they get to\num live long enough to see uh that Riley\nand your other kids were skateboarders\nmy dad met Riley uh but my dad passed\naway when Riley was two\nso he's the only one of my kids that\nthat he met yeah\num my older sibling uh had kids so he\nmet\ntwo of his other grandkids besides Riley\num my mom got to see some of Riley's\nsuccess but uh she suffered from\nAlzheimer's dementia and so things\nslipped away but um\nI I think that uh\nmy dad would not believe that\nskateboarding is in the Olympics\nto him that's that is the top of the\nmountain because he was really into\nother sport he loved Sports he loved the\nOlympics he loves he loved watching\nfootball he loved watching baseball he\nloves when the Olympics were on he just\nhe loved the competition element and the\nhype of it and and I think there was\npart of him that felt like why isn't\nskateboarding in this you know but he\nknew that there were so many hurdles to\nget through and so much more acceptance\nthat needed to happen and\nI don't think he imagined would ever\nhappen\nyeah he was a special guy I can still\nhear his voice he was a very large guy\ntoo I don't know if he I was just\nsmaller then I definitely was smaller oh\nyeah no I mean he had like a big\npresence and um and I know I've told you\nthis many times before this is actually\nhow we got reconnected I sent you a\ndirect message and said hey I met your\nparents in fact they took me into your\nhome and I'm telling the truth and\nyou'll know I'm telling the truth\nbecause they took me to dinner and they\nordered black coffee after dinner and\nyou know for years I would order black\ncoffee after dinner you know as a kid\nyou're just so impressionable these\nreally nice people took me in I was like\nwow this is what a really healthy family\nlooks like I'm grateful to have loving\nparents I always did but yeah I didn't\nhave the healthy family structure so for\nme it was like oh my goodness these\npeople drink black coffee after this\nmust be what healthy families do so by\nthe way folks don't drink caffeine\nwithin eight hours of going to sleep but\num but I still do that but well you it\ndoesn't seem to be holding you back\num individualized but\num yeah it's spectacular that this\nlineage of you know Frank to you and and\nI I mentioned and Nancy because it seems\nlike while she might not have been at\nthe contest and run around setting up\ntables and doing all that like she\nclearly was supportive as well oh oh she\nwas I did a lot of the events too I mean\nthey needed all hands on deck when it\nstarted getting big and no one was\ntaking salaries you know that's the\nthing is that people thought like oh\nyour dad's like cashing on he never took\nup money for any of that\nand he took so much you know what I\nmean he just he just loved it it was for\nyou well\nit was for me and it was also for the\nMisfits that I surrounded myself with\nand even though he was he was Brash and\nhe was like you know he was uh I don't\nknow what's the word\nhe was foreboding and intimidating and\nwhatever else he did it for all those\nkids that were kind of lost like you I\nmean really like he he loved that it\nbrought them together that he gave them\na sense of self it gave them a sense of\npurpose he saw that because he he was\nthat he he really had a rough childhood\nand he did everything he could through\nhis adult life to make up for it with\nhis own kids and with the kids that they\nsurrounded themselves with so that's\nthat's what he loved about it of course\nhe loved seeing me Thrive too but he\nloved that he created the safe space and\nthis this sense of community and so my\nmom my mom was that was her thing was\ngetting people together\ngatherings\nyou know oh we should all get together\nlike\neven even my siblings and I as much as\nwe want to emulate our parents we don't\ndo it as much that as they did and we\nregret that\nwell there's still time no we I mean we\ndo but yeah um It's Tricky we're all\ndifferent areas sure yeah the the person\nthat comes to mind when I think about\nyour dad I'm forgetting the movie but\nthere's this one Clint Eastwood movie\nwhere he lives in a neighborhood where I\nthink it's a bunch of young Hmong oh is\nthat gangsters El Camino El Camino yeah\nand I just remember like there's that\nscene of like Clint coming out on his\nporch and just standing really upright\nyeah everything in his front his front\nlawn is everything's super manicured and\njust standing there like this immense\npresence and that's how I remember Frank\nHawk yeah but he was a total softy\nthat's the thing that's that's the you\nknow there there was a it was it was all\na front\nwell he was certainly very precious like\nyou you know you you got you got to see\nthat side of him where it's just like oh\nyeah come on we'll we'll take you out\nyou want to go see Tony's Place let's go\nlike that's not some hard ass\nwell there's a tail end of the story too\nwhere he actually called my mom\nand I think there may have been a\nstatement or two about hey this kid's 14\nlike he can't be in Linda Vista Boys\nClub taking the bus back to Lancaster et\ncetera et cetera may have been some\ndiscussion like that but then they also\npaid for me to go home oh yeah they flew\nme home yeah so I think I owe you a\ncouple hundred bucks for a Southwest\nflight or whatever Airline it was well\nit's it's fun and I think important to\nreminisce about these people because\num they aren't just your parents but\nthey've done so much and through you you\nknow I I really think that\num emotions and stories are really like\nthe equivalent of energy in humans you\nknow when people talk about energy\nbecause that gets carried forward\num\nspeaking of which we share a common love\nof some particular music are you\nsomebody who listens to music to sort of\num to inspire you to get amped up to go\nskateboard it's music an important part\nof your life yeah let's put it this way\nI had I had a playlist for my 540 the\nother day okay\nfine tune to that trick and what would\nget me motivated in the Hypes\nto to do it uh you don't have to share\nwith us what's on the playlist unless\nyou choose to oh man but was it high\nenergy low energy high energy well and\nand some meaningful songs like um New\nOrder ceremony and uh\nsee nice nails getting smaller because\nthat was a song we used in one of our\nbig skate tours and it was one of the\nmost high energy sections of the show\num\nuh gosh they were so I I can't go\nthrough all of them I forget\num\nuh gang of four\num\nuh wait what's going for it is uh I\nforgot what is it\num oh I find that Essence rare\nfires up so I had I had like 10 that\nwere just gonna if any of those played\nit's I'm gonna make it and and I knew\nthat it was about an hour and a half\nand that's as long as I'm gonna try it\nbefore I'm too tired so you're listening\nin the warehouse or you're listening in\nthe warehouse on random\nand then uh the song that I made it to\nwas uh off of that Prodigy album fat of\nthe Lamb uh and it's called clamatize\nit's instrumental I use it for a\nbirdhouse edit when 4-1-1 was the thing\nwell remember these little like video\nnewsletter type things yeah anyway so\nwhen that song came on\nI I was feeling it I made it\nfantastic I love this because you know\nthe neuroscientist In Me Is immediately\ngonna say you know we have this brain\nthat loves to take an information and\ndiscard other information but paired\nAssociation is so strong yeah and when\nyou couple that with some sense of\nreward like the making of the variable\nbelow coping as a as as early in life or\nmaking the 540fs as a comeback to you\nknow the injury\nafter the injury it was almost like I\nloved all that music but I was\nindoctrinated by it through the skate\nparks because that was the soundtrack to\nThis it was it was punk music it was Sex\nPistols and and 999 and black flag and\nDevo and X\nBuzzcocks and you know that that was\nthat's what I kept hearing and that's\nwhat I associate with my best of times\nit's in your nervous system yeah yeah\nthere's a few voices you know rancid and\nTim Armstrong and and the Operation Ivy\nOperation Ivy sound system sound system\nwas on that playlist was on the 540\nplaylist all right you know Tim will be\nso happy to hear that and Matt Freeman\nthe bass player and Jesse Michaels is\nnow playing again with Tim the lead\nsinger of Operation Ivy yeah with their\nnew um their new gig what's it called\nthey had a name and then they they uh\nthey changed it oh okay initially it was\nuh well I don't want to say because they\nchanged it for a reason but we know I\nknow they're making new music yeah which\nis amazing operation Hive is incredible\nmy yearbook photo for I think two years\nrunning was the cover of Operation Ivy\nbecause I didn't show up for the\nyearbook photo speaking of which did you\nshow up for yearbook photos or did you\ngraduate high school I graduated high\nschool but I didn't go to any of the\nevents\nprom or any of the auxiliary I didn't\nknow I mean I was I was an outcast like\nI was not\neven though I had success in skating\nskating wasn't cool and I was not homies\nwith anyone at school except for two\nother skaters\nand we felt very ostracized\nso nah yeah I did show up for the\ngraduation because because my mom and\ndad wanted to see it yeah likewise I\ngraduated but I could tell you more\nabout the curbs in the parking lot of my\nhigh school than I could about anything\nthat happened in the class man I broke\nso many sprinkler heads because the\nsprinkler heads were right next to the\ncurb and there was a double-sided curb\nand so if you board slide because I'd go\nthere early and board slide and then I'd\njust like lean too far in and break the\nsprinkler head and never got caught what\nhigh school uh well I went to a couple I\nwent to Sarah High School originally\num then I went to San Diego High School\nwhich is in North County and then I\nended up at Torrey Pines I got so\nbullied at San Diego that I requested to\nbe transferred\nbecause I I couldn't go I couldn't\nsurvive there as a skater\nI would have to hide my skateboard in\nthe bushes before class and then go find\nit after school so that people wouldn't\nTarget me\nthe 80s were rough it was like it was\nlike a John Hughes film well for sure it\nwas jocks versus nerds and then skaters\nwere like\nnot even considered in that realm\nbecause they're just gonna get they're\ngoing to get hammered\nbecause there were so few of us\nwell things have changed and not only\nhave things have changed such that\nskateboarding is far more popular and\nrespected and\nyou know at least one mark of that is in\nthe Olympics although there are other\nmarks of respect certainly\nbut a huge Evolution that I've observed\nis when I was\nskateboarding as a 14 year old and you\nknow into my uh close to my 20s and then\ntook some time off\nfor sure\num hardly any girls hardly any women\nthere were a few like carabeth Burnside\nthey got\nteased ridiculed it was hard on them\nsuper hard yeah super hard now largely\nthrough Instagram\num but some other channels as well you\ncan see this young girl Rhys onvert\nskateboarding better than a lot of grown\nmen who have been skateboarding for\ndecades I mean um and then there are a\nnumber of other ones in the um in Street\nskateboarding\num and also taking really hard slams\nlike you know so this this is a complete\nrevision of the recent history of\nskateboarding thoughts on that and um on\nReese and there are a few others was it\nis it um Lizzy who uh took a really bad\nfall that was filmed right there broke\nthe\num Knack offer femur yeah yeah these are\ntough ladies yeah yeah I'm doing it and\nfor coming back Lizzy Lizzy did the loop\nshe did the full 360 Loop first woman to\never do it\nso what do you think changed like that\nthat paved the way is it just you know a\ncritical mass of uh females doing it is\nit that\num you know Sky Brown you know for sure\nfor sure there were there were the\nPioneers people like care about the\nBurnside\num and uh uh there's so many others um\nPatty Hoffman was one of the one of the\nfirst verse skaters to who were they\nplanted the seed and and then there were\nother women that took inspiration like\noh girls can do this\neven though they're largely outnumbered\nand they get hassled for sure and then\nthrough the street era\num people like Alyssa Steamer who who\npaid the way for legit Street skating\num but then\nthrough the years it started to become\nmore common\nmore accepted which is dumb to say\nbecause it's just always been it should\nhave always been accepted but the thing\nthat that really tipped the scale was\nwhen everything was leading up to the\nOlympics\nthere had to be equal divisions in equal\ndisciplines\nfor men and women\nand suddenly there was no question of\nshould we have a should we have a\nwomen's event like no we have to have a\nmanagement because that's how we that's\nthe road to qualifying for this the\nOlympic stage\nand Vance Park series to their credit\nthey were holding events simultaneously\nnot that we're Olympic qualifiers but\njust their own and they said these\nevents are equal across the board equal\nprize money equal attention I mean it\nwas just like that that was just a\nmatter of fact and that shifted a lot\nit really did now if you go to a\nskatepark\nyou see plenty of them there yeah it's\nawesome like literal women like moms you\nknow there's there are\nolder women that are learning how to\nskate it's awesome\nnot that it matters so much but does\nanyone claim to be the first female do\n540 on vert is that sort of a known that\nwould be Lindsay Adams\nfantastic\num and she did that I'll tell you how\nshe did that\nshe was trying it\num so she's trying she's trying to make\ntwists uh she's married to Travis\nPastrana it's like the you know\nit's like the the Elite action sports\ncouple\num and she was trying them she was she\nwas getting pretty close and then we did\na big exhibition in Paris at the uh\nGrand Palais on behalf of quicksilver it\nwas a huge event\num they put a half pipe up and we did\nthis giant show\nthere were thousands of people there and\nit was very much\num\nunspoken but expected that I was going\nto do 900 at this event\num I think it was I want to say it was\n2010 Maybe\nand uh or no like 2009\nand\nand the organizers were kind of like\nokay so we're gonna do this and then you\nknow at some point\nyou do a 900 and I was like I I can't\nguarantee that ever like every time I've\never made it it's been pretty\nspontaneous I've you know I've set out\nto do it and not I've come up short I\ncan't guarantee it I'll try I'll try\nand they they're like yeah yeah okay and\nso I knew the whole time when they were\nskating I was like okay everyone's\nexpecting this so I kind of went through\nthe motions of of uh\ndoing my exhibition tricks you know\nplaying the hits and then started trying\n900s and at the same time Lindsay\nstarted trying 540s because she was\nfeeling that energy\nand so it was this sort of not battle\nbut definitely we were we were trading\nhits it was like all right here goes\nTony no he missed it and here goes\nLindsay oh she missed it and then\nI uh\nshe almost made one like was riding down\nyou know and and then fell at the flat\nbottom\nit was like oh and then I made 900 and\nit was kind of the show stopper\nbecause like that's what they expected\nand everyone's going crazy and whatever\npeople are coming down off the ramp knee\nsliding down and we're saying goodbye to\nthe crowd and I look up and Lindsay puts\nher tail out\nthere's still people standing on the\nramp\nand she puts her tail out and I was like\nI think Lindsay wants to try it again\nhere we go I'm on the mic now\nshe made it\nlove it she stole the show\nlike without question it was huge you\ncan look it up on on YouTube like it's\nthere Lindsay Adams first first 540. it\nwas awesome and then she made it and we\nall grabbed her and put her on her\nshoulders\nthat is awesome it was pretty cool that\nwas awesome because these things are\nlike the four minute mile\nas a barrier then people break that\nbarrier and then other people break that\nbarrier it's I mean I I watched enough\nof skateboarding recent years see you\nknow like the sky Brown thing she's\nphenomenal and I actually saw her family\nout to dinner\nhere in Los Angeles and um with her\nbrother and her folks are really\ngracious really nice and there again you\nknow parents going to the skate park\nafter all she's couldn't drive herself I\nthink she's at that time she was\nprobably like nine you know probably one\nof the biggest shifts too is that\nparents encourage their kids to skate\nnow could you imagine that when we were\nyoung\nnever no there were so many factors\ntelling us not to it's just made us want\nto do it more sure but yeah now now kids\nare like parents are pushing them into\nit get out there learn tricks it's like\nwait that's not what we're supposed to\nbe doing but\nit's cool that that I think it I think\nwith the the really cool factor of all\nthat is there are definitely people our\nage\nI'm grouping you into my age category\n47. all right yeah plus enough\num but but that have kids and and\nskateboarding was such a special time in\nour life and then they're rediscovering\nit through their kids and they're\nskating together and I think that's just\nso amazing\nthat someone of our age would be like\nyou know what I used to do that you're\ninto that like let's go and then you\ncould show your kid how to do a sweeper\nI could probably do that I don't have\nkids yet but when I do I'll show I\nintend on being healthy enough and yeah\nto do a sweeper people can look up\nsweeper we don't have to explain it for\nhim but a little laid back grind or a\nsweeper yep oh yeah because they won't\nthey wouldn't think to do it no and they\nare doing all these difficult flip\ntricks and that's not my it's not my\nscene oh yeah what's your go-to on a\ngame escape if you're gonna really like\ntake out the younger generation\num I can do Impossibles pretty uh\npretty regularly on transition\nconsistently I knew I'm flat so this is\nwhere basically you scrape the back of\nthe it's an ollie really but it wraps\naround the back of it over your foot\nyeah um that's kind of my my sneak\nattack on game's Escape does Rodney\nMullen get credit for that trick still\noh yes that's yeah it's a Rodney are you\nstill in touch with Rodney absolutely\nyeah yeah he's somebody that um\ncertainly deserves deserves mention in\nthe pioneering of tricks I think if he's\nthe Godfather of modern skateboarding I\nthink of Rodney you and Mark Gonzalez\ngons as like the the guys that I'm\nhonored drove the\num the progression in different\npartially overlapping directions that\nset the template for us I learned\nfingertips because of Rodney like the\nfirst trick you saw me do I learned that\nbecause I saw Rodney do it on the ground\nand I thought well\nI can't do it on the ground but I have\nplenty of time in the air to do it\nit's awesome it's awesome that Stacy put\nyou guys together we we mentioned Bones\nBrigade but we didn't really talk about\nthe architecture of it from the\nperspective of skateboard progression\nbut it was\num kind of like any good band it seemed\nlike there was really good chemistry\nyeah um interpersonally but also\num that there was each person had\nsomething unique you skated the way you\ndid Mike skate the way he did Stevie the\nway he did and you know Rodney and you\nknow and we respected each other but we\nalso fed off each other Tommy Guerrero\nyep right because growing up in the Bay\nArea like yeah in fact Tommy's getting\nthe hills of San Francisco in those\nvideos makes it look easy yeah but those\nHills are are rough they're dangerous\nand they have real life obstacles like\nmoving buses you'll notice he wasn't\nstopping his top signs so that's\nfantastic uh we could reminisce about\nall these angles but the the point being\nthat um\nspending time with people who do similar\nthings or the same thing but do it\ndifferently is one of the best ways to\nprogress that's why I routinely fly to\nTexas and hang out with Peter attia\nanother podcaster Lex Friedman just\nbecause they do things differently than\nI do\num where do you draw sort of peripheral\ninspiration from now like I know you I\nsee Jimmy Wilkins at your ramp quite a\nlot the Phenom Jimmy Wilkins it's kind\nof eerie how good that kid is\num who else are you spending time with\nbesides Rhys and one of the reasons I\nasked this is that skateboarding is\nunique among many sports in that\na given session a gathering uh to\nskateboard will include an enormous\nfive-year-old man and 10 year old girls\nexactly yes which is which is incredible\nyou don't think about soccer you know a\nserious game of soccer between\nprofessional soccer but also it's not\neven that we're skating together is that\nwe are\ncommunicating and influencing each other\nI mean that is like\nthe last conversation I have with Rhys\nwas she's talking about like are you\ngonna try to do 540 stand I go yeah I'm\nkind of working on it she goes well I\nthink because she saw me try one she\ngoes I think you need to pull out a\nlittle more and she was right\nand she's how old again she's 10.\nand I and I didn't even consider that\nbecause I'm just back in my mode and I'm\nnot taking into consideration that I\ndon't have the snap that I had before I\ngot hurt and she was I mean that was one\nkey to me making it\nand you know did that that's but it but\nto me that's just\nthat's representative skateboarding and\nthe inclusivity of it and the diversity\nof it where it's me I'm 55 there's 30\nyear old uh\nPros that are at the top of the game\nthere are 17 year old\nup and comers men women 10 year old girl\nthat is doing tricks that we've never\neven thought of\nor want to do\nand it's all part of the\nthe whole mix that's really beautiful I\nwant to ask you about\nmemorabilia\nnot a topic that I think about much but\nI think in a prior conversation of ours\nyou mentioned something about this so\nyou know there are skateboard collectors\nthere are people that collect stickers\nskateboards there's a whole market and\nworld for this and um in addition to\npeople wanting selfies with you when\nthey see you I imagine\num there's a long history and continued\ntradition of people taking a pen putting\nyour hand and saying can you sign this\nright because um you are in this uh very\nuh small but very\num clearly esteemed group of people\nwhere your signature increases the value\nof things so how does that work uh and\nhow does that feel like if a\nskateboarder who you know there are the\ntelltale signs of who is and who isn't\nright\num\num if they walk up to you and they're\nlike hey will you sign this do you feel\ngood about signing it or is that\nsomething that you refrain from and if\nsomebody's just merely a collector a\nTrader and they're trying to\num build their portfolio so to speak\num you can probably also sense that so\nI'm not trying to put you uh in the hot\nseat here\num well to answer your question\nthrough the years\nI was always open to that and and I'm\nhappy to\num especially when people are skaters or\nEscape fans and whatnot in the last\nthree years there has been this new\nelement of resellers of people that just\ngo buy signature stuff they have nothing\nto do with skating they don't care about\nskateboarding at all they just want to\nget my signature on an item and sell it\nand they usually do it on eBay or\nthrough their own channels\num that's fine at some point like a few\nyears ago I respected the hustle these\nguys are they knew that I was going to\nbe at this event okay they're outside\nwaiting they've been waiting for hours\nI'll sign a couple things\nbut in recent months even they have\nfigured out how to get my flight info\nlike some hacked into my my actual\nAirline accounts\nsome have sources at certain airports\nthat get the Manifest and they sell the\ninformation I found all this out because\nI've actually held a couple of them\naccountable because I said look I'm not\ngoing to sign this until you tell me how\nyou knew I was going to be here I have\nno business here I'm here to visit\nfamily no one knows I'm coming here oh\nwell we saw a friend said they saw you\nat the uh Detroit airport like no they\ndidn't\nthey wouldn't know where I'm going to\nanyway like why I saw it on Twitter you\ndidn't see it on Twitter I'm on Twitter\ntell me the truth\nthere's a guy from TMZ that gets flight\ninfo and he sells it to us\nokay thank you but that has increased to\na point where it's not it's not\nsustainable I can't I can't please\neveryone the last time I flew out of\nChicago there were about 15 people one\nguy had a shopping cart full of\nskateboards\nand they all they all bum rushed me at\nsecurity before I went through security\nthinking that I'm going to sign stuff\nI'm like you guys I can't I can't do\nthat I might miss my flight and I can't\ndelineate who like I I I'm sorry you\nguys have like sabotaged yourselves I\ndon't know what to say and then I went\nthrough security\nand there were four D's waiting at the\ngate they had bought tickets airline\ntickets so that it could be past\nsecurity that they airline tickets\nthey're not going to use\nto chase this\nwow so\nI mean when people want My Autograph but\nit's weird and it's intrusive and it's\nkind of creepy\nyeah just tell them that a\nneuroscientist told you that you got to\nget that slob air right and if you sign\ntoo many autographs that uh\nyou're not going to get the tuck knee\nyou're not just not going to be do the\nflat knee invert you're just not going\nto get anyway it is it's just a really\nweird new thing that is weird it has\npopped up and\num other than that and and so the tricky\npart is when there is a public thing or\na public exhibition or whatever to try\nto figure out who is the true skate fans\nand who aren't\num usually they're pretty identifiable\nbut it it just it has ruined the\nexperience for people who truly are the\ngrew up skating\nuh well thanks for sharing that and um\nwe won't tell everyone what the telltale\nsigns are so that these people don't\nexploit them the skateboarders the real\nfans will know\num uh they won't have to worry about\nwhether or not they represent accurately\nbecause you just will\num on the positive side something I've\nbeen wanting to learn more about from\nyou is your philanthropic efforts\num I think\nKevin Rose\num who's in the tech sector was the\nfirst to mention to me that you have you\nguys have done some philanthropy\ntogether\num and maybe you've done some with Jim\nthibo as well the great Jim thibo yeah\nuh well both both Jim and Kevin were\nboard members uh Jim is the current\nboard member of the skateboard project\nbut tell us about the skateboard project\num it's it's it's my non-profit and we\ntry to develop public skate parks in our\ncertain underserved areas but more so by\nby supporting the community and giving\nthem the resources to do so so groups\nthat are trying to get skate parks in\nthe area we are the resource center for\nthem\num we'll give them advice we'll give\nthem funding we'll give them uh our\nstamp of approval and that can go a long\nway and uh to date we've helped to fund\nover almost a thousand skate parks now\nand seven or eight hundred of which are\nopen\num I mean it's my proudest word for sure\nand and it's because\nI never\nI I never took for granted the fact that\nI grew up near a skatepark and that was\nmy home away from home that was where I\nfound my sense of community my sense of\nidentity my my crew and so many kids\nchoose the skateboard but have no\nsupport in doing so and so those skate\nparks are a lifeline yeah I can attest\nthey they absolutely save lives there's\nno question where can people find out\nmore about your foundation we can\nprovide a link but where dot org so\nwhere does the funding for these Parks\nactually come from\num it comes from donations from\nsupporters it comes from fundraisers\nsome corporate uh sometimes funding is\nis funneled through us for specific\nregions\num like the uh uh we have a built to\nplay project that's in Michigan and New\nYork and that's funded by the Ralph C\nWilson Junior Foundation\num so they they give us the funding and\nthen we have to\ngive it to that area but but it's easy\nbecause there's plenty of projects and\nnow there's an abundance of skate parks\nin those areas I love it thank you for\ndoing that for organizing around that\nand I get to get more places to skate\n[Laughter]\nI'm curious what's in the immediate\nHorizon right\num these days you probably have the\noption to say yes to things and no to\nthings\num you know you have a family you have\nyour skateboard career\num\nwhere do you place your priorities in\nterms of how to carve up your day or\nyour week I mean what would you like to\nmake sure that you do\nor as much of the hours of your waking\nday for the next let's just say five\nyears because and if you want to extend\nthat out you can but um well I I want to\nbe available to my kids first and\nforemost\num and we still have one at home for the\nnext four years so uh I will make sure\nthat I'm available to her and\nin terms of career I never had great\naspirations like I never thought okay\nthese are this is what I want to\naccomplish it was always just very\nmore you know trick specific oriented so\nit's always like I want to try this and\nthis and this I would like to continue\nskating I don't know if I'll be able to\nskate at the level I'm skating right now\nin five years but I know that I'll still\nbe on the ramp I may not be doing it in\npublic\num\ntrying to advocate for public skate\nparks doing more with the foundation\num and whatever I think I think the way\nI prioritize My Time is what will\nresonate the furthest and have the best\nimpact on skateboarding in general I do\nfeel\nthat I've come to a point where yes I'm\nsome\num unofficial ambassador to\nskateboarding and I want to represent it\nwell I want I want to\nbe fair in that skateboarding has all\nkinds of different things it's not just\nX Games or Olympics or or whatnot it\nrepresents\n[Music]\num\na true culture\nand\nI want to\nproject that as much as I can and make\nsure that people understand that that's\nalso positive\num and\nI mean it really everything that I'm\ndoing now is just kind of fun\nokay it's for the I would say in the\nlast five to ten years is the first time\nI've truly enjoyed what skateboarding\nhas provided me in terms of opportunity\nand what it brings to me and and what it\nmeans to my family like I have a much\nbetter appreciation understanding for it\nand these days it's just like\neverything's kind of just gravy it's\njust so fun I can't believe I can still\ndo it for a living it's crazy I'm 55\nyears old\nand I truly ride my skateboard as a\ncareer like that's nuts and I won't have\nit in any other way\nwell it certainly is earned and um I\njust want to say thank you for a number\nof things first of all\num\nthank you for going to the skate park\nthank you for picking this trajectory\nthank you for inspiring me and so many\nother young people and old people older\npeople over so many decades now both\nwith what you did on a skateboard and\noff the skateboard and including your\nresilience and determination to push and\ncontinue to progress to the point where\nyou were badly injured and then to push\nthrough that come back at least match\nwhat you did previously and I I would\nwager that you will exceed your prior\nskill level going forward so I want to\nthank you for your resilience I know it\ncomes from an intrinsic Drive\num Your Love of skateboarding it just\nabsolutely comes through I share in some\nof that um of course having grown up in\nit but not nearly as much as you but\nalso just your willingness to stretch\nout into these different areas like the\nvideo game thing or talk about X Games\num uh the Olympics because that did\nallow for a lot of growth and lateral\nmovement of skateboarding\nand at the same time just as you said to\nbring it right back to the fact that\nskateboarding isn't one thing it is not\nlike other sports it's its own Sport and\nit's its own lifestyle it's its own\nthing\num and we do consider you the Ambassador\nfor skateboarding and appreciate it um I\nspeak for many people and I say that uh\nwe're very grateful that you are because\nyou bring that that shrewdness and that\nPrudence to it but also that get after\nit punk rock Spirit and the goodness\nthat your parents you know instilled in\nyou clearly comes through everything\nfrom the philanthropy and onward so I\ncan't say enough positive things and or\nexpress enough gratitude for your what\nyou've gone in for your time here your\nlegacy in skateboarding but also just in\nthe Game of Life is clearly cemented so\nthank you oh thank you well hey I and I\nappreciate that the ethos of\nskateboarding shines through on your\nshow and just your crew here it's\nclearly a lot of them come from the\nskateboard world so you're you're still\nsupporting it whether you know it or not\nthanks so much and uh hopefully you'll\ncome back and we'll do it again all\nright\nsounds good\nthank you for joining me for today's\ndiscussion with Tony Hawk if you're\nlearning from and
