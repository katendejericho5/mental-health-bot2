    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today we're\ndiscussing growth mindset growth mindset\nis one of the most interesting and\nPowerful Concepts in all of psychology\ngrowth mindset is essentially a way of\nembracing Challenge and thinking about\nyour bodily and brain's response to\nchallenge in a way that allows you to\noptimize your performance growth mindset\nconsists of many things which we will\ndiscuss today and of course we will\ndiscuss how to implement growth mindset\nbut some of the key features of growth\nmindset are developing an ability to\ndistance your identity from The\nChallenge you happen to be embracing now\nthat might come as a bit of a surprise\nto many of you for instance we grow up\nhearing we hope from time to time that\nwe are smart that we are talented that\nwe are a good athlete that we are a good\nartist you know we like to think that we\nare good at something or perhaps many\nthings but it turns out that the kind of\nPraise or feedback that we receive that\nattaches our identity to Performance can\nactually undermine our performance and\nbelieve it or not this is especially\nproblematic for people that perform well\nin their Endeavors that's right if you\nare somebody who performs well in school\nor Athletics or music and you are told\nthat you are very smart that you're an\nexcellent student that you're an\nexcellent athlete or that you're an\nexcellent musician you have much to lose\nif you at any moment do not perform well\nand that's because your identity has\nbeen integrated with your performance\nsomewhat counter-intuitively growth\nmindset is the process of distancing\nyour identity from performance and\nrather attaching your identity and your\nefforts and your sense of motivation to\neffort itself and to the process of\nenjoying learning and getting better at\nlearning anything so today we are going\nto discuss what growth mindset is and\nwhat it isn't because it's often\ndiscussed in terms that frankly are not\naccurate to the science we will also\ntalk about another mindset which is the\nstress is enhancing mindset that it\nturns out can act synergistically with\ngrowth mindset such that when you\ncombine growth mindset with the stresses\nenhancing mindset you and anyone it's\nbeen shown can vastly improve your\nperformance in essentially anything so\ntoday's discussion will of course\nexplore the classic work of Carol dweck\nwho was really the founder of the growth\nmindset field as well as some of the\nnewer research from people like David\nYeager Ali Crum and others who have\nexplored how growth mindset and stress\nas enhancing mindsets can be applied\nboth in and out of the classroom in\nchildren and adults and really in people\nof all backgrounds by the end of today's\nepisode you will have a rich\nunderstanding of the science as well as\nmany tools that you can apply in\neveryday life in essentially any\nEndeavor before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is eight sleep\neight sleep makes Smart mattress covers\nwith cooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity there's absolutely no question\nthat sleep is the foundation of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nwhen we're sleeping well and we're\nsleeping long enough everything in our\ndaily life goes that much better now a\nkey component to getting a great night's\nsleep is the temperature of your\nsleeping environment and that's because\nin order to fall and stay deeply asleep\nyour core body temperature actually has\nto drop by about one to three degrees\ncon conversely in order to wake up\nfeeling refreshed your core body\ntemperature has to increase by about one\nto three degrees with eight sleep\nmattress covers you can cool or heat\nyour mattress at the beginning middle\nand end of your night in order to\noptimize your night's sleep I started\nsleeping on an eight-sleep mattress\ncover about two years ago and it has\ndramatically improved the sleep that I\nget each and every night if you'd like\nto try eight sleep you can go

huberman\ntoday's episode is also brought To Us by\nRoca Rocco makes eyeglasses and\nsunglasses that are the absolute highest\nquality I've spent a lifetime working on\nthe biology of the visual system and I\ncan tell you that your visual system has\nto contend with an enormous number of\ndifferent challenges in order for you to\nbe able to see clearly Roca understands\nall of those challenges at the level of\nthe eye and the visual system within the\nbrain and they've designed their\neyeglasses and sunglasses so that no\nmatter what environment you're in you\ncan always see with Crystal Clarity\noriginally their glasses were designed\nfor sports and as a consequence all of\ntheir glasses are extremely lightweight\nand as well they won't slip off your\nface even if you get sweaty however\ndespite being designed initially for\nperformance Roca eyeglasses and\nsunglasses include a lot of different\nstyles that are designed for you to wear\nto work or out to dinner as well as the\nwhat I call the cyborg style they're\ndesigned for cycling Etc if you'd like\nto try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses go\nto Roka that's roka.com and enter the\ncode huberman to save 20 off your

that is\nthat our abilities are not fixed but\nrather that our abilities are malleable\nand at the core of growth mindset is the\nidea that our brains can change and\nindeed they can we refer to that ability\nas neuroplasticity or the the nervous\nsystem's ability to change in response\nto experience now I've done several\nepisodes about neuroplasticity so that's\na topic unto itself but suffice to say\nthat neuroplasticity Brain Change can\noccur throughout the entire lifespan it\nis far more robust early in life from\nbirth until about age 25\nneuroplasticity is sort of the default\nprocess our brain is being shaped by our\neveryday experiences but certainly from\nage 25 and onward and certainly well\ninto people's 90s even it's been shown\nthe brain can change if we want it to it\ncan change for the worse of course\nthrough injury or disease things of that\nsort but it also can change for the\nbetter through deliberate focused bouts\nof learning we can learn new languages\nwe can learn art we can learn music we\ncan get smarter we can get better at\nessentially anything if we devote our\nattentional resources to learning those\nthings so really any discussion about\ngrowth mindset has as a subtext a\ndiscussion about neural elasticity\nalthough today we aren't going to focus\nso much on neuroplasticity meaning we\naren't going to focus so much on the\nneural circuit and neurochemical changes\nthat underlie neuroplasticity because\nI've covered those on previous episodes\nwe'll talk about them a little bit today\nbut we are mainly going to talk about\nthe data the studies from the field of\npsychology applying growth mindset in\nand out of the classroom in children and\nadults and we are going to talk about\ntools everyday tools that you can use to\nenhance growth mindset for yourself and\nperhaps for those around you if you care\nto teach growth mindset which is you'll\nlearn later turns out to be an excellent\nway to reinforce your own growth mindset\nand we're going to talk about how to\napply those tools in a bunch of\ndifferent domains musical athletic\nintellectual and on and on no discussion\nof growth mindset would be complete\nwithout mentioning that growth mindset\nis the brainchild of my colleague Carol\ndweck in the department of psychology at\nStanford University\ntoday you'll learn how she discovered\ngrowth mindset and you will learn how\nothers have taken that Discovery and\nexpanded upon it and especially its\napplication in and out of the classroom\nto start off our discussion about growth\nmindset however we need to Define what a\nmindset is I think most of us think we\nknow what a mindset is we think oh it's\nkind of a a mental stance where you know\nwe are positive or we are negative or we\nbelieve something or we don't believe\nsomething but a mindset actually has a\nvery specific definition and here I'm\nreferring to the definition provided by\nDr Ali Crum Ali Crum is also a professor\nof psychology at Stanford she runs her\nown laboratory working on stress-related\nmindsets and other mindsets she's\nactually been a guest on this podcast\npreviously highly recommend you listen\nto that episode if you haven't already\nDr Crum defines a mindset as quote a\nmental frame or lens that selectively\norganizes and encodes information\nand I think the key thing to highlight\nthere is organizes information because\nas you all well know we are constantly\nbeing bombarded with information from\nthe outside world sensory information\nabout what's going on with our visual\nsystem what we're hearing what we're\nseeing what we're feeling we are also\nbombarded with internal sensations of\nhow full or empty our gut feels are we\nhungry are we tired are we anxious are\nwe calm Etc so tons and tons of\ninformation funneling into our brain and\nmindsets really help us organize that\ninformation such that we pay attention\nto certain things and not others and we\nrespond to certain things and not others\nokay so here I'm not trying to put\nadditional language on something simple\nin order to make it complex I'm trying\nto put a little bit of language that is\nthat a mindset does many things but it\nmainly organizes information I'll add to\nthat for specific actions or inactions\nin a way that allows us to simplify our\nworld in a way that allows us to make\ncertain choices and do away with\nthinking about and acting on other types\nof information the other thing about\nmindsets is that they include entire\nnarratives and most of the time we\naren't even aware of how those\nnarratives are operating\nmeaning we don't walk around looking at\nopportunities in the world like the\nopportunity to get better at Fitness or\na sport or music or arithmetic or\nlanguages or anything for that matter\nthinking okay what is my mental frame or\nlens that selectively organizes and\nencodes information we don't do that\ninstead what we have are stories and\nthose stories are usually attached to\nour sense of identity like I'll just use\nmyself for instance I do not think of\nmyself as a good musician in fact I\ncan't read music I'm terrible at playing\ninstruments I like listening to music\nbut I consider myself a terrible\nmusician right I've really assigned a\nvalue or I've assigned my value to music\nand my relationship to music right we\ntend to do that we can also do it in the\nopposite direction right I'm running a\nlaboratory for a long time been in\nscience for you know close to three\ndecades so if you ask me you know do I\nfeel proficient at science I'd say yeah\nI'm proficient at science I know how to\ndo experiment setup experiments write\nresearch papers write grants Etc I'm\npretty good at it right we tend to\ndecide if we are good or bad at things\nand we tend to integrate those with our\nidentity somewhat or a lot to depending\non whether or not you know we're a\nprofessional or amateur how much we\nengage in an activity the point being\nthat mindsets include all of these\nnarratives and often those narratives\nare visible to us if we think about them\nbut most of the time we are moving\nthrough the world meaning school work\nrelationships and all our endeavors\nwithout a lot of careful thought about\nthe narratives we carry and the beauty\nof growth mindset is that it forces us\nto step back and ask ourselves some\nsimple questions these are questions\nthat you could ask yourself right now\nand in fact I highly recommend you do\nyou could ask yourself for instance what\nhave I been told I'm really good at you\nshould also ask yourself what have I\nbeen told I'm really poor at that I'm\njust not good at what have I told myself\nI'm really good at and what have I told\nmyself I'm really bad at and then a\nsecond set of questions is what am I\ngood at and why did it come naturally to\nme did I apply myself for many years\nmeaning did I apply a lot of effort to\nlearning that thing or perhaps both\nright and then it's also important to\nask yourself why am I not good at other\nthings is it simply because you've never\napplied yourself with those things or is\nit because you tried and had an early\nfailure or perhaps you tried and tried\nand tried for many years and you\ncontinue to fail at that thing or you\njust didn't reach a level of proficiency\nthat made you want to pursue it further\nin asking yourselves those questions you\nare asking yourself not just what you're\ngood at and bad at and why you should\nalso be thinking about where the\nmessages of being good at something or\nbeing bad at something arrived from did\nthey arrive from outside you meaning\nfrom your parents from your coaches from\nyour teachers or was it the case that\ndespite a lot of positive feedback you\njust sort of decided you weren't good at\nsomething or conversely was it the case\nthat despite a lot of negative feedback\nthat you would never be good at\nsomething or that you weren't good at\nsomething that you continue to persist\nbecause there are certainly people like\nthat the more negative feedback they get\nthe more they dig their heels in to\nprove themselves as capable of becoming\ngood at something so I do recommend as\nwe March forward in this conversation\nyou think about those questions what am\nI good at what am I bad at why am I good\nat those things why am I bad at those\nthings and ask yourself to what extent\nyour labels that is your identity is\nattached to the things that you are good\nat or bad at and the reason I'd like you\nto ask yourself those questions is that\nnext we're going to talk about some\nresearch from Dr Carol dweck's\nlaboratory that was really the seed of\nthe entire field of growth mindset it\nrelates to a specific set of experiments\nthat really show that the specific\nfeedback we get meaning whether or not\nwe get feedback that is attached to our\nidentity like a label like smart or\ngreat athlete or talented sends us down\na very different path of performance in\nthe short and long run\nas compared to whether or not we receive\nfeedback that's based on effort meaning\nyou tried really hard or you really seem\nto apply yourself under conditions where\nyou're getting the right answer over\ntime because you simply refuse to quit\nthose are two very Divergent sets of\nfeedback and as you'll learn in a moment\nthe sorts of feedback that we get\nespecially early in life or early in an\nEndeavor so this doesn't just apply to\nyoung kids this applies to adults too\nwho are taking on a new skill or trying\nto expand on an existing skill those two\nDivergent forms of feedback get\nintegrated into our core beliefs about\nwhat we think is possible for us in a\ngiven Endeavor and the great news is we\ncan also modify those core beliefs\nsimply by changing the feedback that we\ngive ourselves the research paper I'd\nlike to discuss briefly that beautifully\nembodies the runway that led to the\ndiscovery of growth mindset is paper\nfrom Dr Carol dweck as well as her\ncolleague Claudia Mueller and the title\nof the paper essentially says it all the\ntitle is praise for intelligence can\nundermine children's motivation and\nperformance\nright that should be surprising that\npraise for intelligence can undermine\nmotivation and performance I would have\nthought and I think many people probably\nbelieve that if you tell a child or an\nadult that they're really good at\nsomething and you're genuine about that\nfeedback meaning they're performing well\nand you say great you're doing really\nwell you're so smart you're so talented\nthat their performance would continue to\nimprove that it would bolster their\nmotivation to engage in that activity\nwhich hopefully they enjoy but\nregardless provided that it's a safe\nactivity it's educational or what have\nyou that it would serve to encourage\nthem right the kid thinks not only am I\nengaging in this activity but I'm\ngetting positive feedback presumably\nfrom people that I care about or whose\nopinion I care about wouldn't that serve\nto elevate performance\nit does not in fact the exact opposite\nhappens so I'll just give you a few of\nthe key takeaways from this study\nthe way it was done is very interesting\nthey essentially gave feedback about\nperformance that was linked up with a\nchild's intelligence telling kid they're\nsmart they're talented that they can\nlearn things really easily or that\nthey're very good at learning this sort\nof thing and they call that intelligence\nfeedback\nor they gave them what was called effort\nfeedback the simple way to think about\neffort feedback is that it's more\nattached to verbs as opposed to labels\nso effort feedback consists of things\nlike\nyou tried really hard on that problem it\nwas great the way that you applied\neffort it was great the way that you\npersisted it was great the way that even\nwhen you got the wrong answer you spent\n10 minutes thinking about it and then\nyou tried again and again or in some\ncases even if they didn't get the right\nanswer telling them well even though you\ndidn't get the right answer it's really\nterrific that you continue to try Okay\nso intelligence feedback was the sort of\nfeedback that was tied to labels of\nidentity things like smart talented Etc\nwhereas effort feedback was tied to\nverbs choices behavioral and cognitive\nchoices that children made in an effort\nto learn or get better at something so\nin this study which included over 100\nchildren they either got the\nintelligence type feedback or the effort\ntype feedback or there was a control\ngroup that didn't get either the\nintelligence or the effort type feedback\nand then they looked at a number of\ndifferent outcomes so I'll just\nhighlight a few examples of what they\nfound first of all the kids that got the\nintelligence-based feedback when they\nwere then later offered problem sets\nthat were either challenging or were of\nthe sort that they knew they could\nperform well on they tended to select\nproblems that they knew they could\nperform well on these are what were\nreferred to as performance goals in\nother words they picked problems that\nallowed them to continue to get the\npraise that they had received previously\nabout being smart or talented whereas\nthe kids that got feedback about their\nstrong effort when later presented with\nproblems that were either easy or hard\nmore often than not they picked the\nharder problems that stood to teach them\nmore so that's striking it says that if\nyou tell a kid that they're smart or\ntalented and that's the reason why they\nperform well\nwhen they encounter challenges they are\nlikely to go with the least amount of\nchallenge so that they can continue to\nreceive that praise or feedback whereas\nif you receive praise and feedback for\nyour strong effort then later you tend\nto pick environments problem sets Etc\nthat allow you to exert the very effort\nthat got you the praise in the first\nplace so in both cases these children\nare essentially attached to the praise\nright in some sense I mean we like to\nthink that they enjoy these activities\nand they're benefiting from them as well\nbut in both cases the praise really\nserves to reinforce a certain pattern of\nbehavior but in the case of giving\nintelligence feedback the kids are\nreally just trying to reinforce being\ntold that they're smarter talented as\nopposed to reinforcing the engagement in\nthe activity that got them the praise in\nthe first place\nand the converse is also true when kids\nare told hey you really tried hard and\nthat's great or I like how you persisted\nor you're so persistent I can really see\nhow persistent you are in trying to get\nthe right answer even if you don't get\nthe right answer well then when you\npresent those kids with additional\nchallenges they work very hard to stay\nin Challenge and guess what no surprise\nthe kids that are rewarded for effort\nand that continue to pick harder\nproblems outperform the kids that are\ngiven the intelligence praise and\nfeedback by a large margin so what does\nthis tell us this tells us that the\nnarratives that we hear from others of\ncourse reinforce certain patterns of\nbehavior what else does this tell us\nthis tells us that if you're a parent or\nteacher you have to be very careful\nabout giving feedback to a child that is\nattached to their identity around an\nendeavor\nespecially if they're performing well at\nthat endeavor right now of course if a\nchild is not performing well at\nsomething you also don't want to tell\nthem that they're stupid right you don't\nwant to tell them that they're deficient\nright but that's a rare occurrence in\nthe classroom one would hope that's a\nrare occurrence on the field one would\nhope but what's very common very very\ncommon is that when we see children or\nadults performing well we tend to give\nthem identity labels as a way to try and\nreinforce whatever Behavior we observe\nand we like now the other thing they\nlooked at in the study besides whether\nor not these kids would pick hard or\neasier challenges down the line where\nthe actual raw performance on cognitive\nproblems and these data I must say are\njust so interesting\nthey took the kids and they gave them\nall the same problem sets and all the\nkids across the board whether or not\nthey were getting intelligence praise or\neffort praise or they were in the\ncontrol group we're performing more or\nless the same way they were getting some\nof these questions right some of these\nquestions wrong\nthen they gave them praise after\nthey completed those problems they\neither got intelligence praise you're so\nsmart you're so talented or they got\neffort praise you tried so hard you\nreally persisted that's fantastic then\nlater they gave them another set of\nproblems and they looked at performance\nnow remember the first time around all\nthe kids got some of the questions right\nand some of the questions wrong so\nthere's room for improvement for\neverybody\nwhat they found was absolutely striking\nthe kids that were in the control group\nso they didn't get any specific form of\nPraise they perform more or less the\nsame way as they did before so if they\nwere getting 75 percent of the answers\nright the first time they got 75 percent\nof the answers right the second time 25\nwrong in both cases\nthe kids that were in the intelligence\npraise group that you're so smart you're\nso talented praise group their\nperformance went down significantly\nwhereas the kids that were in the effort\npraise group their performance increased\nsignificantly okay so this is a\nbi-directional effect where giving\nintelligence praise reduces performance\nand giving effort praise improves\nperformance which is absolutely striking\nand tells you everything you need to\nknow which is if you're a parent you're\na teacher and of course as we all give\nourselves feedback\nrewarding yourself for effort is the\nbest way to improve performance\nrewarding yourself based on identity\nlabels so smart so talented you're a\ngreat athlete Etc all that stare in the\nmirror and do self-affirmation stuff can\nactually undermine performance and in\nfact it does undermine performance it\nmay not do it right away but eventually\nit does and in a moment I'll explain why\nthe other thing this study looked at\nthat I just have to mention is this\nnotion of persistence so remember\nearlier I said that the kids that got\nintelligence praise tended to pick\neasier problems down the line whereas\nthe kids that got effort praise tended\nto pick harder problems it turns out\nthat the kids that got intelligence\npraise also tended to take on fewer\nproblems overall they tended to limit\nthe total number of challenges that they\nengaged in whereas the kids that got the\neffort praise that you worked so hard\nyou're so determined that was so\nimpressive how you just kept going even\nwhen you got some answers wrong those\nkids not only opted for harder\nchallenges they not only performed\nbetter but they also took on many more\nchallenges so these data really made\nclear that the effort praise is the way\nto go now I know many people have heard\nthis whole thing about don't reward the\nperson reward the effort reward the\nverbs as I'm referring to it but it's\nactually pretty rare that we hear effort\nrewarded in everyday settings and it is\nvery common for us to overhear\nintelligence praise or Talent praise you\nknow a kid comes home with a trophy and\nwe tell them you're a great athlete\nright a kid comes home with a great\nreport card you know you're so smart\ncongratulations a kid comes home with\nsome sort of win in their world and we\ntend to give them a label because we\nlike to think that that label will get\ninternalized and they'll start to view\nthemselves as a winner we tell them you\ncan do anything you're a winner you're a\nwinner and of course you don't want to\ntell children or yourself or any other\nadult you're a loser right we do not\nwant to do that you don't want to\nundermine performance that way but it's\nvery clear based on This research and a\nlot of other papers similar to it that\nwe all have a giant blind spot sitting\nin our psychological field when we are\ngetting and receiving praise that really\nit is the sort of praise that's attached\nto the very efforts that led to the\nresults that will lead to even improved\nresults over time okay so this paper is\nreally truly important it's a landmark\npaper in the field of psychology\nmotivation learning and performance and\nthat's why I'm discussing it in such\ndetail here but it actually includes one\nadditional piece of information that I\nalso think everyone should know about\nand that is the tendency for children\nwho get intelligence praise\nto misrepresent their performance on\nsubsequent efforts\nwhat do I mean by that basically what\nI'm saying is in this paper they had the\nchildren perform on a given task and\nthen they either got intelligence praise\nyou're so smart you're so talented or\neffort praise you worked so hard you're\nso diligent you kept going even when you\nwere faced with results you didn't like\nand then they had them do a series of\nother tasks and then report their\nresults to other kids and what they\nfound is that children who get\nintelligence praise when they need to\nreport their scores either by walking up\nto the board and putting a little Mark\nwhere their particular score is or\ntelling another student what their score\nwas or even writing it down on a piece\nof paper covertly so that's not visibly\nbeing compared to all the other scores\nthe kids that got intelligence praise\ntend to lie about their score\nand as you could imagine they tend to\nlie in the direction of making\nthemselves appear as having performed\nbetter than they actually did so this is\na pretty Sinister aspect of intelligence\npraise that we don't often hear about\neven if you've heard telling a person\nthat they are smart or talented can\nultimately undermine performance rarely\nif ever do we hear that telling someone\nthat they're smart or talented\ncan increase the probability that that\nperson is going to misrepresent their\nperformance in the future and that's\ntrue regardless of whether or not they\nperform pretty well or not in the past I\nmean you could imagine that the kids\nthat were told that they were\nintelligent that they're talented that\nthose kids you know if they were doing\nwell and then suddenly did poorly that\nthey Slide the score up a little bit we\ndon't want anyone to do that but you can\nimagine how a young kid might do that to\nkind of preserve their ego but no in\nsome cases these kids are already\nperforming pretty well they're not\ngetting 100 but they're performing in\nthe top bracket and yet if they received\nintelligence praise they're still more\nlikely to lie about their performance\nincreasing it further still whereas the\nkids that receive the effort praise do\nno such thing they Faithfully represent\ntheir performance and as I mentioned\nbefore for many reasons that we'll talk\nabout in a few minutes meaning the\nmechanisms and what's really going on in\nthe heads of these kids that get effort\npraise they're performing better than\neverybody else so just to illustrate how\nimportant the findings in the study\nreally are the paper was Paul published\nin 1998 but just two years prior in 1996\nthere was a survey of parents asking to\nwhat extent do you believe that\nintelligence is fixed and 85 percent\nanswered that they thought that\nintelligence was fixed that means they\nbelieve that the brain was sort of a\nvessel of fixed size that of course when\nwe're born into the world it's kind of\nempty we don't have any knowledge but\nthat the job of schooling was to teach\nkids things and reveal an intelligence\ncapacity that was innate and that\ncouldn't be increased upon whereas\nnowadays we really understand mainly\nthrough our deeper understanding of\nneuroplasticity and how the brain learns\nthat indeed the brain can learn and that\nintelligence is not fixed however in\n1998 when these studies were done most\npeople were of the core belief that\nintelligence is fixed that it cannot be\nimproved upon and these results really\ndrive home the fact that the type of\nfeedback we get about our performance\neven when our performance is good can\nundermine our future performance or if\nwe receive feedback of the effort praise\ntype the you tried so hard you're so\npersistent type that our abilities can\nindeed improve and when you look at any\nintelligence test if you look at\nstandard IQ test or you you know go way\nout onto the other end of the Continuum\nin terms of intelligence testing you\nlook at emotional intelligence it is\nvery clear that anyone and everyone can\nimprove their scores on those exams and\nin fact can improve the various aspects\nof intelligence because in fact there\nare many different forms of intelligence\nthrough dedicated effort so this paper\nwas really ahead of its time and it's\nreally what seeded the entire field of\ngrowth mindset and the understanding of\nwhat that is so now I'd like to shift\nour attention to not just how getting\none form of Praise or another form of\nPraise can diminish or enhance\nperformance but really to ask why that\nwould be how that is because in that\nunderstanding there's a very simple set\nof tools of narratives that you can tell\nyourself or that you can tell a child as\nthey are attempting to learn that can\ngreatly enhance your or their ability to\nlearn before we go any further however I\nknow many of you are listening to this\nwith an eye toward the tools meaning you\nwant to know what the tools are that you\ncan Implement well earlier I had you ask\nsome questions what are you good at what\nhave you been told you're good at and\nhow did you arrive at being good at\nthose things I also encourage you to\nthink about what you've been told you're\nbad at\nor less good at and what you tell\nyourself you're bad at and less good at\nand how you arrived at that conclusion\nright now I'd like you to ask yourself\nwhat is your typical narrative when you\nare engaging in things that you believe\nyou are good at and what is your typical\nnarrative meaning your internal dialogue\nin your head when you're engaging in\nthings that you are not good at or if\nyou're not engaging in those things when\nyou think about engaging in those things\nand the tool that's very effective to\napply even just in your own mind is to\nstart shifting your narrative from those\nperformance narratives of being really\ngood at something or bad at something\nwhich are In fairness are the labels I'm\nusing here but that's for sake of\ndiscussion and Clarity and to start to\nshift those narratives towards effort\nrelated narratives so I'll use myself as\nan example I'm pretty good at learning\nand remembering things cognitive\ninformation\nI'm pretty terrible at playing music in\nfact I'm downright terrible if I were to\nstep back from those two statements\nI could take an intelligence type praise\nnarrative and tell myself okay I'm\num I have a great memory right that's\nthat's a intelligence praise type\nnarrative or I could tell myself the\ntruth which is I tend to spend a lot of\ntime with information in different forms\nI listen to it I read it I write it down\nI highlight it I put it up on a\nwhiteboard I tell myself that\ninformation again in my head I think\nabout it in different contexts I tell\nother people about it that's how I\ndeveloped a good memory for certain\ntypes of information and that's still\nhow I continue to build my memory and my\ninformation Bank in my head to this day\nit's not because I have a quote unquote\ngreat memory it's because I engage in\ncertain verb processes to build up that\nmemory okay I can also take a look at\nthe let's call it the negative statement\nI am abysmal at music which frankly is a\nfair statement and I could say okay I'm\njust a terrible musician I have no\nmusical sense I have no musical ability\nthose are labels of the intelligence\ntype labels\nor I could look at the verbs\nthis is also true\nI have never really spent a lot of time\ntrying to learn an instrument I failed\nearly on at least in my mind I failed to\nget the results I wanted and so I\nstopped playing\nI made the dog next door Howell which by\nthe way I did so I stopped playing\nI ceased the effort process and so in\nlooking at it through that lens yes I'm\na terrible musician but I'm a terrible\nmusician as a consequence of having\nnever really engaged in the types of\nbehaviors and effort over time that\nwould have allowed me to be anything but\na terrible musician now I'm not asking\nyou to do this exercise simply as a way\nto Puff yourself up about the things\nyou're good at and reward yourself for\nall the effort that went into it nor am\nI asking you to look at the things that\nyou're not good at and trying to take\naway some of the shame and blame\nalthough that would be a good thing as\nwell\nthat led to the fact that you're not\ngood at these things the reason I'm\nrequesting that you ask those questions\nof yourself is that they can start to\ngive you a sense of the actual tools and\nhow those tools are implemented in order\nto get better at the things that you\nwant to get better at and and this is a\nvery important and to not set yourself\nup for getting worse at the things that\nyou already think you're good at because\nas we'll soon talk about when we attach\nperformance labels to things that we are\nreally good at we internalize that sense\nof self oh I'm good at this particular\nthing in my case if I gave a performance\nlabel or an intelligence label it would\nbe of the sort okay I have a great\nmemory but what happens when someone\ngives themselves or hears a performance\nor intelligence label around something\nthat they're good at and then has an\nerror or has a period where they're not\nthat good at something well if you\ninternalized a sense of identity around\nperforming well at that thing and then\nat some point you don't perform well you\nwill also attach your identity to that\ndiminished performance whereas if you\nattach effort verbs to why you got good\nat something as well as why you are not\ngood at something well then there's only\nroom for improvement why do I say that\nwell when we're talking about effort\nwe're talking about verbs that is\ninherent to you if you did it in one\ncontext you can do it in another whereas\nability and performance it's not the\ncase that if you have a good memory You\nAre by default a good musician that\nmight be the case but in my case\ncertainly it's not the point being that\nwhen you think about the effort\nprocesses that you've engaged before and\nover and over again that allows you to\ncontinue to get better in a given domain\neven when or perhaps we should say\nespecially when you stop getting the\nresults you want or you start getting\npoor results and that effort process of\npracticing a lot many repetitions\nanalyzing why you didn't get something\nright that can be engaged in a lot of\ndifferent Endeavors across domains as we\nsay so when we talk about verbs like\neffort or persistence or practicing a\nlot or analyzing errors and why you did\nsomething incorrectly and then getting\nback to the drawing board as it's called\nwhen you start to think about your\nsuccesses and your failures through\nthose lenses through the lens of verbs\nthen you're really talking about\nsomething that's Central to who you are\nit's how you're wired it's Machinery\nthat exists in your brain and nervous\nsystem and body that you can engage that\ntime and anytime as many of you know\nI've been taking ag1 daily since 2012.\nso I'm delighted that they're sponsoring\nthe podcast eg1 is a vitamin mineral\nprobiotic drink that's designed to meet\nall of your foundational nutrition needs\nnow of course I try to get enough\nservings of vitamins and minerals\nthrough whole food sources that include\nvegetables and fruits every day but\noftentimes I simply can't get enough\nservings but with ag1 I'm sure to get\nenough vitamins and minerals and the\nprobiotics that I need and it also\ncontains adaptogens to help buffer\nstress simply put I always feel better\nwhen I take ag1 I have more focus and\nenergy and I sleep better and it also\nhappens to taste great for all these\nreasons whenever I'm asked if you could\ntake Just One supplement what would it\nbe I answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1\ngo to drinkag1.com huberman to claim a\nspecial offer from now until August 12\n2023 ag-1 is giving away 10 free travel\npacks plus a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 again if you go to drinkag1.com\nhuberman you can claim the special offer\nof 10 free travel packs plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 okay so I've\nbeen talking about cognitive or\npsychological processes and the basic\ntake home is that labels of intelligence\nlabels of identity undermine performance\nand a striking aspect of that by the way\nwhich I failed to mention earlier but I\nshould have is that if we receive those\nlabels of being a high performer smart\ntalented Etc either before or after\na given task or game or exam\nit still has a detrimental effect in\nboth cases meaning you tell someone\nheading into something you're a great\nathlete you are so smart you're going to\ndo so well on this exam you undermine\ntheir performance or if they take the\nexam and afterwards before you see their\nscores or even after they score let's\nsay they get an A plus they get\neverything perfect and you say you are\nso smart you are so talented you are\nundermining the performance on the next\nexam that's how striking these results\nare and again they've been shown again\nand again in different populations of\nstudents and adults conversely it's\nstriking how powerful the effort labels\ncan be at improving performance\nconversely and fortunately the same is\ntrue for effort-based praise so if\nbefore a kid or adult heads into a\ncompetition or exam or preparation for a\ncompetition and exam you say you know\nwhat I know you to be a really dedicated\nworker you really persist you know how\nto do hard things you really dig your\nheels when it gets hard and you overcome\nchallenges if you do that before that\nchild or adult heads into challenge they\nwill perform better and if after an exam\nor performance or practice whatever the\neffort happens to be you tell them you\nreally worked hard I love the way that\neven when you know you got kicked in the\nshin and you're limping along there and\nyou're hurt you continue to play or even\nwhen you know everyone else went to\nsleep and you continue to study although\nby the way I do encourage people to get\nenough sleep there are times in which\nlet's face it the person who stays up\nlatest studying provides they get enough\nsleep\nthey're getting the extra hours in right\nI might have been that kid in college or\ntried to be that kid in college\nif you reward effort after the effort\nyou also set the mind the brain of that\nchild or adult up to provide more effort\nto future endeavors so it's very clear\nit doesn't matter if the timing of the\npraise comes before or after a given\nbout of effort or performance you give\nidentity praise before performance\ndiminishes you give identity praise\nafter\nsubsequent performance diminishes you\ngive effort praise before performance\ngoes up you give effort praise after\nperformance goes up so I know I sound a\nlittle bit like a broken record but we\nhear so often about growth mindset about\ngiving the right form of Praise but it's\nnot often that we are told when to give\nthat praise and the short answer of\ncourse is doesn't matter in fact we\nshould always be striving to give others\nand ourselves praise that is correctly\nattached to genuine effort and that word\ncorrectly is important here I'm not\nsaying you know take a kid who performed\npoorly on an exam because they kind of\nloafed or the kid that was just\nshuffling their feet out on the soccer\nfield and say hey great you know you you\nworked so hard when they didn't you know\nwe know when we're being lied to or when\nwe're lying to ourselves\nbut that should give you a sense of\ncontrol not a sense of lack of control\nbecause ultimately effort is something\nthat we can control in fact whenever I\nhear the term control what you can\ncontrol I get a little bit nauseated and\na little bit irritated too because it's\nnever clear what people are referring to\nwhen they say control what you can\ncontrol focus on what you can control\nwhat's the thing that we all really can\ncontrol it's our level of persistence\nand our level of effort and of course we\nall have different circumstances such\nthat persistence and effort can be\nharder in certain circumstances and for\ncertain people certainly but at the end\nof the day at the end of the year and at\nthe end of our life really the only\nthing that you really truly can control\nis where you place your attention and\nwhere you place your effort those are\nthe two things that are really inherent\nto you and your nervous system no one\ncan do the effort for us no one can\ndirect our attention for us\nthings and people can try and divert or\ndistract our attention and our effort\nbut ultimately effort and attention that\nis intrinsic motivation come as the name\nsuggests directly from us okay so it's\nclear that we have a striking set of\nresults in the literature and again\nmajor hat tip to Carol dweck and her\ncolleagues for making this discovery\nright it is what eventually led to the\ndiscovery of growth mindset and it's\nwhat we're really building up to here\nokay so this early work from dweck and\ncolleagues and by early I mean late 90s\nright\nis really spectacular it really\ntransformed the way that we think about\neducation and learning in general and in\nfact neuroplasticity but what it didn't\nanswer is why you know why is it that\neffort praise leads to better\nperformance and intelligence praise\nidentity praise leads to diminished\nperformance and it turns out that the\nanswer resides in how people respond to\nerrors how they respond to feedback that\nthey did not want and there's a really\nnice study that looked at this\nmechanistically in the brain to ask\nwhat's going on under the hood meaning\nwithin the brain when people who have\none mindset or another\nadopt a growth mindset that is the idea\nthat if they engage in effort that they\ncan get better at things or if they have\nwhat's called a fixed mindset this idea\nthat if they're not performing well it\nmust be because they just simply can't\nperform well they don't have the\ncapacity or the ability to perform well\nso the study I'm referring to is a study\nfirst author mangles last author no\nsurprise Carol dweck and it's entitled\nwhy do beliefs about intelligence\ninfluence learning success a social\ncognitive Neuroscience model\nI'm not going to go into all the details\nof the study but the study used what's\ncalled erps event related potentials\nevent related potentials\nare measured by putting a cap on the\nskull that has a bunch of electrodes but\nthey don't penetrate the skull they're\npicking up electrical potentials that\ncorrelate with shifts in brain activity\nnow an advantage of erps is that it's\npretty non-invasive you can even do it\non babies you don't have to cut into the\nskull you don't have to remove any skin\nas you would if you were going to you\nknow put electrodes down into the brain\nwhich essentially is neurosurgery and\nit's not as disruptive as being put into\na functional magnetic Imaging machine\nwhere you're put into a tube and you\nhave to lie motionless for an hour or\nmore actually it was in an MRI machine\nnot for any clinical reason but just as\na diagnostic scan recently and nowadays\nthey allow you to watch Netflix in there\nor do something but you have to stay\nvery very still so it's hard for a lot\nof people to do that but it can be done\nif you need it to be done you do it but\nerps are great because people can come\ninto the laboratory put on this skull\ncap it's got this funny thing or it\nlooks funny with all these little wires\ncoming out of it and you can get a\nfairly good measure of\nGlobal levels of activity across the\nbrain you can't really pinpoint fine\nstructures and you can't look at brain\nactivity deep in the brain that's\nprobably the major drawback of looking\nat these erps but you can see global\nshifts in activity across the brain and\nthe other Advantage is you can do that\nwhile people are engaging a lot of\ndifferent types of tasks you can move\naround a lot whereas when you're in an\nMRI machine you're in that little tube\nyou can't really do much so this study\nhad people equipped with these skull\ncaps looks like a kind of like a hoodie\nwith a bunch of wires coming out of it\nand they had them\nplay a game basically what they did is\nthey were asked questions these are\ntrivia type questions like what's the\ncapital of Australia Australians you're\nnot allowed to answer that question but\neveryone else should try and then here\nI'm paraphrasing people indicate their\nconfidence in how accurate they were\nwith the response okay so they ask them\na question like what's the capital of\nAustralia the person would answer and\nthen they say how confident are you on a\nscale of say one to ten\nthat you got the answer correct and then\nthey were given two pieces of feedback\nand the first piece of feedback provided\ninformation only about their response\naccuracy were they right or were they\nnot right\nand then the second feedback was they\ngot the correct answer so this is a\npretty clever experimental design\nbecause it allowed the researchers to\nlook at people's thinking as they're\ntrying to get the right answer then\ncompare that to how confident they were\nthat they had the right answer right you\ncould imagine that if someone was really\nconfident like if you ask me what's your\nname and I say Andrew what's my\nconfidence that my name is Andrew 75\njust kidding 100 okay 100 whereas if you\nasked me\num I was confronted this the other day\nuh in your physics class when they\ntalked about the right hand rule which\nis if you're listening don't don't worry\nabout it it's just when you put out your\nindex finger your middle finger and your\nthumb with your right hand in the right\nhand rule is the magnetic field the the\nmiddle finger the index finger the thumb\nand I'm pretty sure that it's pretty\nsure that it's the the magnetic field is\nthe the middle finger that's the vector\nof the middle finger but how confident\nam I in this result I don't know maybe\n50 because it's been a while since I've\nlooked at this stuff and I should know\nthis but I haven't looked at so 50 when\nyou give people these kinds of questions\nwhile recording brain activity you're\ngetting a lot of information you're\nlooking at accuracy you're also looking\nat confidence you're looking at lack of\nconfidence and you can correlate that\nwith different patterns of brain\nactivity now they had essentially two\ngroups of people in the study one group\nhad an intelligence mindset they\nbelieved intelligence was more or less\nfixed the other had what we call a\ngrowth mindset they believed that\nthrough effort that intelligence was\nmalleable that people could learn new\ninformation including themselves they\ncould learn new information\nand you wouldn't necessarily think that\nthese two groups would show different\npatterns of brain activity in response\nto getting things right or wrong while\ntheir brain was being imaged but in fact\nthat's exactly what happened there's a\ncertain waveform of activity the name\nisn't really important you call it the\nP3 wave in these Erp experiments P3 wave\nis a certain pattern of activity that\nemerged during the presentation to the\nsubject that they gotten something wrong\nso the P3 wave it's just a little\nblippin neural activity in the brain\ncorrelated with when people were told\nnope you got that one wrong okay and\nwhat was really interesting is that the\nheight of the P3 this let's just call it\nan error signal because it correlated\nwith the error signal this nope you got\nit wrong signal in the brain that signal\nwas larger in people with a fixed\nmindset as opposed to in people with the\ngrowth mindset\nnow what was especially interesting is\nthat the location of that activity was\nabove a brain area called the interior\ncingulate cortex the ACC the anterior\ncingulate cortex is a structure involved\nin many different functions in the brain\nbut one of its primary functions is that\nin the front of the ACC what we call the\nrostral or anterior ACC\nivity there tends to correlate with\nemotional responses it tends to\ncorrelate with our internal sense\nso-called enteroception whereas in the\ndorsal ACC meaning the top of the ACC\nactivity there tends to correlate with\ncognitive information and cognitive\nappraisal meaning this structure has a\nlot of different functions but it's got\na little area within it that tends to be\nmore related to our emotional or somatic\nresponses to things and it's got another\narea inside of it the tends to be more\nrelated to our thinking our cognition\nand what was really interesting is that\nin the group that had the fixed mindset\nwhen they were told that they got\nsomething wrong there tended to be a\ngreater signal in that rostral or\nanterior ACC meaning they had a bigger\nemotional response to it or at least the\nneural activity suggested that whereas\npeople with a growth mindset when\npresented with ah you got something\nwrong the error signal the error signal\nwithin their brain tended to reside or\neven to shift toward areas that are\nassociated with cognitive appraisal and\nso the conclusion of this study as well\nas other studies using functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging that have\nlooked at similar tasks is that when\npeople have a growth mindset and they\nare presented with the information that\nthey got something wrong rather than\njust feel it as a somatic response or an\nemotional response they tend to appraise\nit they tend to direct their attentional\nresources toward trying to understand\nwhat the error was and why they got that\nerror and this I believe is absolutely\nfundamental to understanding the\ndistinction between a fixed mindset and\na growth mindset because perhaps you've\nseen these lists these you know\nside-by-side lists that you know a fixed\nmindset versus a growth mindset you know\na fixed mindset is one in which you're\ntrying to look smart that you're not so\nfocused on effort that your response to\nsetbacks is to give up you know and your\nacademic and other forms of performance\ntends to be low whereas in a growth\nmindset your goal tends to be to learn\nyou tend to Value effort more you tend\nto respond to setbacks by working harder\nand your performance is higher and I'm\nnot trying to make light of these lists\nthese lists are important because they\nhelp us organize our information and\ndifferentiate between a fixed versus\ngrowth mindset but they don't tell us\nwhy focusing on effort and engaging more\neffort would actually translate into\nhigher performance for instance you\ncould imagine a scenario where the exact\nopposite is true right we can make up a\njust so story where if your identity is\nso rigidly fixed to high performance\nyou're likely to outwork everybody right\nthat seems like a logical conclusion as\nwell but that's not the way it plays out\nit's when your identity is attached to\nyourself sense of ability to engage in\nongoing effort especially when you\nreceive signals that you're getting\nthings wrong or not performing well that\nis tied to elevated performance in the\nstudy using erps tells us that's likely\nto be the case because of how people who\nhave a growth mindset Focus their\nattention when they're told nope you got\nthat wrong or when people think they got\nsomething right right they give an\nanswer and they say what's your\nconfidence level and they say 90 maybe\n99 maybe even 100 percent it's wrong\npeople who have a fixed mindset\nfocus on the emotional response to that\nmore of their brain resources are\ndevoted to I got it wrong I thought I\ngot it right then the people who have a\ngrowth mindset who are thinking wait\nokay then what was that answer and how\ncould I possibly get that answer wrong\nI'm going to figure that out okay now as\nyou're hearing this you're probably\nthinking oh no I'm somebody who\nreflexively gets disappointed when I get\nsomething wrong well fortunately this is\nnot just about that 100 milliseconds to\nfive seconds after you're told something\nis wrong you can shift from a fixed\nmindset to a growth mindset response in\nfact that's an important tool that we\nall need to learn how to implement we\nall suffer from fixed mindset all suffer\nfrom fixed mindset in certain Endeavors\nand when we get things wrong especially\nwhen there's some embarrassment or shame\nwhich often accompanies when we think we\nwere very right we're convinced we're\nright that fixed mindset can really\nhijack our emotional response\nbut\nthere are a lot of data that point to\nthe fact that at those moments if we\nthink okay I'm going to step back from\nthat and I'm going to just think about\nthe error I'm going to think about what\nled to the error and I'm going to start\ndevoting my intentional resources to\nthat process\nthat process itself can be built up over\ntime such that we start to outweigh the\nfixed mindset with growth mindset simply\nby devoting our attentional resources to\nthe error acknowledging it happened\nmaybe feeling something about it maybe\nnot it's really hard to control our\nfeelings what we can control as I\nmentioned before is our effort and our\nattention so focusing our attention on\nwhy we got something wrong and really\ndigging into that that's growth mindset\nin action so you'll notice as we have\nthis discussion about the more\nmechanistic underpinnings of growth\nmindset is that we're not talking about\npsychological terms as much we're not\ntalking about ego protection we're not\ntalking about identity now all of those\nthings are extremely important but the\nproblem with things like ego protection\nand identity is that when we are faced\nwith results that we don't want and we\nare faced with those results in a real\nworld context like we're not getting the\nresults we want in school in work in\nathletics in relationships Etc\nwe hear these messages and we try to for\ninstance you know set our ego aside or\nyou know not attach our identity so much\nto what is happening but it's really\nreally hard and it's really really hard\nbecause\nstatements like set your ego aside or\ndon't attach yourself to it so much are\nwonderful aspirations but there's no\nactual process that one can go through\nby oneself that allows you to\nimmediately disentangle yourself from\nyour ego right I mean there's this whole\nprocess of ego dissolution that we\ntalked about in the episode with Robin\ncardard Harris but none of that was\ndirected at specific challenges that one\nis undertaking in real time right so\nwhen you're faced with results that you\ndon't like you can't simply step back\nnor should you expect yourself to be\nable to step back and say oh I'm not\ngoing to get upset about this error\nright it makes perfect sense why you\nwould get upset about not getting the\nresults that you want however once you\nstart to understand some of the\nmechanistic underpinnings of what will\nallow you to rescue your performance\nthat is to start focusing on those\nerrors from a more cognitive and a\nslightly less emotional stance or even a\ncombination of emotional and cognitive\nright because it's very hard to suppress\nour emotional response to something but\noftentimes we can enhance our\nattentional or cognitive response to\nSomething in parallel with that and in\ndoing so we can kind of Rob some of the\nemotional response\nand when we do that sort of thing it's\nhard and anytime we do hard things we\ngenerally want to know that the doing of\nthose hard things is working that it's\nin service to something and the study I\njust reviewed as well as what I'm going\nto talk about next really points to the\nfact that building up a practice a\ncapacity of focusing on one's effort on\nfocusing on the errors one made from a\ncognitive standpoint and really trying\nto understand what led to those errors\nis the basis it's the Cornerstone of\nbuilding up growth mindset it does\nhowever require that we don't just tell\nourselves to focus on effort and the\nerrors and analyzing those errors it\nalso requires an additional piece which\nis what we're going to talk about now\nI'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge our sponsor inside tracker\ninside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nmeet your health goals I'm a big\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term Health can only be\nanalyzed from a quality blood test\nhowever with a lot of blood tests out\nthere you get information back about\nblood lipids about hormones and so on\nbut you don't know what to do with that\ninformation with inside tracker they\nhave a personalized platform that makes\nit very easy to understand your data\nthat is to understand what those lipids\nwhat those hormone levels etc mean and\nbehavioral supplement nutrition and\nother protocols to adjust those numbers\nto bring them into the ranges that are\nideal for your immediate and long-term\nHealth inside tracker's ultimate plan\nnow includes measures of both apob and\nof insulin which are key

inside\ntracker.com huberman to get 20 off okay\nso by now I like to think that we all\nunderstand what growth mindset is and\nwhat differentiates it from a fixed\nmindset however just understanding what\ngrowth mindset is and how having a\ndesire to implement it and a bit of\nunderstanding of how to implement it\nturns out to be necessary but not\nsufficient there's an additional piece\nthat we need to accomplish the good news\nis that additional piece is very\nstraightforward to understand if we zoom\nout and we start to really understand\nthat growth mindset is really a way of\nconnecting motivation to cognition it's\ntaking this thing that we call\nmotivation which is of course what we\nall want we all want to be motivated we\nall want to be effort driven Etc\nand we take motivation and we tie it to\na set of specific thoughts or thought\nprocesses that we can control\nthat is Far and Away different than\nlooking at motivation simply as an\nemotional or an internal state of quote\nunquote feeling motivated and in fact\nthat's what most people including myself\ndefault to we want to feel motivated so\nfortunately we try and get good sleep\nwhich is essential that really helps for\ndaytime mood focus and alertness and\nthereby motivation we hydrate we\nexercise we might even drink caffeine as\na way to increase our level of alertness\nand motivation and all of that is\nfinding good in fact all of that is\nencouraged although I would say that the\ncaffeine part is optional but all those\nother things are encouraged toward\nmental health physical health and\nperformance and motivation but what\ngrowth mindset is really about is it's\ntaking this thing that we call\nmotivation and it's saying okay what are\nthe specific types of thoughts and\nactually the specific thoughts the\nspecific cognitive processes that will\nallow us to feel more motivated\nespecially under conditions where we\nfeel something is hard where we are not\ngetting the results we want and in order\nto master that process we need to\nembrace another mindset that's right in\norder to access growth mindset it's very\nclear that we need to be able to think\nabout errors and we need to overcome\nerrors and we need to devote our\nattention to errors and we need to\ndevote our attention to reframing what's\ngoing on in our head when we're feeling\nnot motivated Etc and all of that is\nreally hard to do from a purely\npsychological standpoint but there's\nthis additional mindset which has to do\nwith our mindset around stress and\nfrustration itself that can allow us to\naccess growth mindset far more easily\nand this mindset around stress actually\nhas a name it's called the stress is\nenhancing mindset and there's a very\nstraightforward way to increase your\nstress is enhancing mindset so first I\nwant to step back and acknowledge the\nperson who really made some of the key\nfundamental discoveries in this area\nthat we call stresses enhancing mindsets\nand that's Dr Alia sometimes referred to\nas Dr Ali Crum she's a tenured professor\nof psychology at Stanford she also is a\nformer division one athlete and a\nlicensed clinical psychologist she's an\nabsolute Phenom and I promise you that\nshe is so successful in all those\ncategories by way of immense amounts of\neffort in addition to that she also\nhappens to be an incredibly kind person\nand generous person she was a guest on\nthis podcast previously you can find\nthat episode in the show note captions\nor by going to hubermanlab.com and\nsimply searching for mindset crumb\nc-r-u-m\nher personal story and her work and the\ntool she offers are absolutely\nspectacular however you don't need to go\nto that episode just yet I'm going to\ntalk about some of those tools now and\nI'm going to talk about how using those\ntools can allow you to access growth\nmindset and then I'm going to talk about\nhow the combination of applying a stress\nis enhancing mindset with a growth\nmindset acts synergistically to even\nfurther improve performance in the short\nand long run the stresses enhancing\nmindset is the outgrowth of many\ndifferent studies and not just from Dr\nAli Crum but from others as well but for\nthe time being I want to focus on one\npaper in which Dr Crum was the first\nauthor so this work was done before she\narrived at Stanford the paper is\nentitled rethinking stress the role of\nmindsets in determining the stress\nresponse and the key takeaway from this\npaper is that how we think about stress\nimpacts how we react to stress so much\nso in fact that what this paper\nillustrates is that if people are given\neven just a short tutorial about some of\nthe negative consequences of stress on\nlearning and performance and their\nphysiology and their health they\nexperience a lot of negative\nconsequences of stress when they are put\ninto a stressful circumstance\nconversely if people are taught about\nthe performance enhancing aspects of\nstress then those people will experience\nperformance enhancement when they are\nconfronted with stress in a learning or\nother performance type environment so\nwhat we are talking about here is not\nthe placebo effect I want to be very\nclear about that\nwe are also not talking about lying to\npeople in order to shift their response\nto stress what we're talking about here\nis two different conditions one\ncondition where people are exposed to\ninformation that is true about how\nstress can diminish performance and\nanother condition in which people are\nexposed to information that is also true\nabout how stress can enhance performance\nnow you might be saying how can it be\ntrue that stress is both performance\ndiminishing and stress is performance\nenhancing and ah therein lies the key\ntakeaway from this paper it depends on\nwhat you believe about stress in fact a\ndifferent way to umbrella this whole\ndiscussion is to say that how you think\nabout stress impacts the stress response\nin profound ways so this paper\nrethinking stress the role of mindsets\nand determining stress\ndid a very simple set of manipulations\nthey had people in one group listen to a\nlecture that effectively was titled\nquote the effects of stress are negative\nand should be avoided and that lecture\nincluded information about how stress\ndiminishes performance and how it can\ndiminish health and vitality learning\nand performance productivity it\nincreases uncertainty Etc okay and all\nof that information is true\na separate group listened to a lecture\nentitled quote experiencing stress\nimproves health and vitality and again\nthat information is true now I realize\nthat some of you are probably still\nasking how can it be that stress\ndiminishes health and performance and\nstress also enhances health and\nperformance and the answer lies in two\nthings one the level of stress and\ntherefore the level of hormones that are\nreleased in response to that stress the\nduration over which the stress response\noccurs but the key variable here is that\nour cognitive understanding about what\nstress does impacts whether or not our\nphysiology goes down the direction of\ndebilitating or enhancing effects of\nstress Okay so we've got a condition\nhere where people are being informed\nvery differently about what stress does\nin one case it's the stresses bad\nmessage in the other case it's the\nstress is good message and there are\nmany different experiments within this\npaper but one of the more interesting\nones I believe\nis where they looked at work performance\nboth in terms of performance of what\nthey call soft tasks so these are\nsomewhat easier tasks as well as hard\ntasks and when you look at the group\nthat was given information about how\nstress diminishes performance in the\nsoft tasks okay so the somewhat easy\ntask You Don't See Much change in their\nperformance\nas you compare the before the learning\nabout stress is diminishing to after the\nlearning whereas the people who learn\nthat stress is enhancing actually\nexperience some improvement in work\nperformance even though the challenge\nthat they're facing isn't that great so\nagain what this means is that learning\nthat stress can enhance performance by\nproviding people true information about\nhow stress can enhance performance can\nincrease performance even in the context\nof stuff that's not that hard not that\nstressful even more interesting is that\nwhen you look at performance on tasks\nthat are considered hard and you compare\nthe stresses diminishing group meaning\nthe group that was taught that stress is\ndiminishing\nand compare that to the stresses\nenhancing group you see a really\nDivergent response the people that learn\nthat stress diminishes performance did\nnot improve at all whereas the people\nthat learn that stress can enhance\nperformance enhance their performance\nsignificantly now keep in mind all they\nare doing is learning that stress can\nenhance their performance and then\nthey're given the task and they're\nperforming better so that's pretty\nspectacular right there's no training\nsession that they went and did they\ndidn't practice these items that they\nwere being tested on in between they\nweren't given a bunch of you know drills\nto do and they didn't take a lot of time\nto do it they just heard a tutorial\nabout how stress can enhance performance\nand that I believe is remarkable because\nwhat it says is that our cognitive\nappraisal about stress which we all are\ngoing to experience in life right\nelevated heart rate narrowing a visual\nFocus you know shifting of blood away\nfrom the periphery all of these things\nare characteristic features of the\nstress response that we learn especially\nin this day and age because it's talked\nabout a lot in popular culture that oh\nyou know all of the these mechanisms\nwere put into us in order for us to get\naway from the saber-toothed tiger or the\nor the line that's trying to eat us\nlet's be fair the stress response is\nthere for a lot of reasons not just\nbecause of saber-toothed tigers and\nlions I mean that's kind of a story that\nwe make up the stress response is\ninherent not just to us but to other\nspecies as a way to mobilize us either\naway from things or toward things right\nwe need to have somewhat of a stress\nresponse in order to engage in adaptive\nchallenge yes it's true that hundreds\nand thousands of years ago those\nadaptive challenges probably involved\nhunting but they probably involved\nSocial Challenges as well do you think\nit was you know easy for cavemen and\nwomen to engage socially and you know\nkind of settle out their romantic\ninteractions Etc do you think it was\neasy for them to raise children no of\ncourse not the stress response is there\nfor a variety of reasons not just to get\naway from predators the really exciting\nthing that's been discovered in the\ncourse of Ali krum's work and other work\nin the last couple of decades is that\nthe stress response is neither good nor\nbad the stress response depends on\nwhether or not you believe the\nsensations that you're experiencing\nelevated heart rate narrowing a visual\nFocus Etc are serving to enhance your\nperformance or diminish your performance\nand this study really points to the fact\nthat just learning that it can enhance\nperformance\ncan enhance performance now I know a\nnumber of you are probably saying wait\nbut stress doesn't feel good right and\noftentimes we experience stress under\nconditions where we're trying to learn\nor get good at something or listen\nbetter or do something and it actually\nis diminishing performance I think it's\nimportant to acknowledge that\nthis study and studies like it are not\nsaying that stress becomes pleasant as a\nsensation in the body nor is it saying\nthat it always leads to improved\nperformance I don't want you to think\nthat's the take-home message sometimes\nit does it can as was demonstrated in\nthis research paper but oftentimes as we\nknow stress diminishes our performance\nit takes us away from the landmarks we\nwant to hit it takes us away from the\ngrades we want to get it takes us away\nfrom quote unquote showing up how we\nwant to right no one wants to have the\nblotchy skin and the sweating and the\nquaking of voice when we're trying to do\npublic speaking and things of that sort\nno one wants any of that what's\nimportant to understand is that learning\nthat stress is a way of mobilizing\nresources in the body does two things\nfirst of all it allows us to dampen or\nadjust the stress response in real time\nand it allows us to understand that that\nstress response heightens our level of\nfocus in a way that allows us to pay\nattention to the things that are going\nwrong in a way that allows us us to make\ncorrection to those errors in the future\nso if you think back to that study that\nErp study where they measured brain\nactivity and they looked at people who\nhad a fixed mindset versus people who\nhad a growth mindset and the people who\nhad a growth mindset were paying more\ncognitive attention to what was\nhappening during errors and after errors\nwell this stress is enhancing mindset is\nvery powerful because what it does is it\nshifts one's attention away from the\nkind of somatic experience of oh my\ngoodness my heart rate is elevated I'm\nsweating I'm quaking I'm just I sound\nterrible I feel terrible I look terrible\nEtc to a mode of allocating more of our\nthinking toward analyzing why things\nmight be going wrong and something else\npowerful happens when we Embrace a\nstresses-enhancing mindset as well when\nwe Embrace a stress is enhancing mindset\nit turns out that some of the very\nphysiological processes that we call\nquote unquote stress shift in important\nways some of those include the duration\nover which the stress hormone cortisol\nis released and in fact I don't even\nreally want to call it a stress hormone\nbecause cortisol does so many other\nthings as well and it's not bad you need\ncortisol believe me you want cortisol\nespecially released early in the day and\nin response to acute stressors what you\ndon't want is for cortisol to stay\nelevated for long long periods of time\nand you especially don't want it to\ninterfere with your sleep okay so much\nso that I think at times I wonder\nwhether or not our philosophy on stress\nshould be that stress is fantastic for\nus\nexcept when it interferes with our sleep\nright and when stress becomes terrible\nfor us is when it starts to be\nchronically elevated and especially when\nit starts to inhibit our ability to\nsleep well enough and long enough okay\nso the point here is that when we\nEmbrace a stressous enhancing mindset we\nare able to have shorter duration\nrelease of cortisol we are also able to\nengage what's called increased stroke\nvolume under conditions of stress this\ngets a little bit technical but the\namount of blood that your heart can pump\nwith each beat turns out to be a key\nmetric of stress when we are very\nstressed even though we need to mobilize\na lot of resources somewhat\nparadoxically our total stroke volume\ncan actually be reduced and we tend to\nshuttle blood and other resources\ntowards the core of our body and towards\nmajor Limbs and away from things like\nour brain and our periphery so one of\nthe key measures of how a stress\nresponse quote-unquote is going is how\nmuch peripheral blood flow there is and\nwhen we are more relaxed under\nconditions of stress there tends to be\nmore peripheral blood flow when we are\nmore anxious more panicked under\nconditions of stress peripheral blood\nflow is lower and in a remarkable set of\nexperiments\nAli Crum and colleagues have shown that\nwhen we are just taught that stress can\nbe enhancing and then we are placed into\na stressful environment either because\nwe are imagining stress or we are\nexperiencing real stress and then our\nphysiology is measured\nwhat is observed is that the total\namount of blood that the heart can pump\nwith each beat is actually increase\nperipheral blood flow increases and our\nability to maintain cognition to think\nclearly under conditions of stress\nincreases and again the only\nmanipulation here is a tutorial about\nhow stress can be enhancing which is\nessentially what I'm telling you right\nnow in fact for those of you that\nperhaps have heard stress reduces\ntestosterone levels stress reduces\nestrogen levels Etc that's true it is\nalso True by the way that when you are\ninformed about how stress can be\nenhancing of performance it becomes\nanabolic that's right it actually can\nlead to deployment of androgens and\nestrogens things that many not all\npeople desire to have increased or\ncertainly desire to not have diminished\nbelow their normal Baseline so there's a\nlot of false stories out there about\nstress not false because what you're\nhearing is wrong\nbecause indeed chronic stress\nchronically elevated cortisol can reduce\ntestosterone reduce estrogen diminish\nsleep diminish immunity Etc\nbut it is also true that stress under\nconditions where one believes that\nstress can be enhancing can be anabolic\nit can be pro-testosterone pro-estrogen\nit can be\npro-cortisol regulation in ways that\nallow you to focus your cognition and so\non and so forth now that's exciting but\nI do realize that for some people it\nmight be sufficiently vague to make you\nwonder well how do I know if I'm getting\nthe right response from stress or the\nwrong response and the simple answer\nthere is the more that you can learn\nabout how stress can enhance performance\nand the more that you place yourself\ninto safe I want to underscore it safe\nyet stressful adaptive circumstances\nthese are going to be circumstances\nwhere you stand to learn or grow in some\npositive way not circumstances where you\nstand to hurt yourself or others of\ncourse\nthe more that you can place yourself\ninto conditions of stress and then to\ncognitively just tell yourself ah this\nelevated heart rate this um quaking of\nmy hands this you know sweating Etc this\nis my body mobilizing resources and the\nmore that you can tell yourself that\nthat's actually affording you an\nadvantage in being able to allocate your\nattention to specific things maybe why\nyou made an error and analyzing that or\nmaybe why you succeeded at something and\nthinking about the steps that led to\nthat success the more that you can link\nthat back to the processes that are\ntaking you in the directions that you do\nand don't want to go and thinking about\nthem because indeed that's what stress\ncan allow you to do\nthe more that you are shifting your mind\naway from thinking about just the raw\nuncomfortable sensations of stress\nyou're putting a cognitive appraisal on\na physiological process you are thinking\nabout stress in a way that is changing\nwhat that stress is doing and you're\ntaking your brain and body from a\nnegative State just to put a little bit\nof subjective valence on it negative\nright nobody wants to have the bad\nstress response to a positive State and\nwhen you develop a stresses enhancing\nmindset you not only are going to feel\nmore comfortable under conditions of\nstress but you're also developing the\nperfect tool to plug into the whole\nprocess of building up your growth\nmindset in a way that allows those two\nthings growth mindset and stress is\nenhancing mindset to synergize and to\ndramatically improve performance in the\nshort and long term and that's not just\na statement that I'm making that's what\nthe research tells us so let's take a\nlook at that research so now I'd like to\nshift our discussion to some very recent\nfindings about growth mindset and how\ngrowth mindset combined with the\nstresses enhancing mindset can\npowerfully change outcomes for the\nbetter and can do so in a huge variety\nof real world contexts and the work that\nI'm referring to is the work of a person\nnamed David Yeager Dr David Yeager is a\nprofessor at the University of Texas\nAustin he did his graduate work with\nCarol dweck at Stanford and he now has\nhis own laboratory in Austin and both\nwhen he was a graduate student with\nCarol and in his own laboratory he's\nbeen doing very impressive large-scale\nstudies meaning many thousands of\nsubjects so that itself is important and\nusing subjects from diverse areas rural\nurban Etc different levels of affluence\nlack of affluence and finding\nessentially that when students are\ntaught about a growth mindset what it is\nhow it's different than a fixed mindset\nand when those same students are also\ntaught about what a stress is enhancing\nmindset is and cultivating that again\nsimply through information tutorial\nwatching a video about growth mindset\nwatching a video about stress is\nenhancing\nmindsets and then\nconfronted with stress\nconfronted with Tess confronted with\nopportunities to embrace hard challenges\nor easier paths across the board the\nresults show up again and again as\nstudents who are taught about a growth\nmindset and are taught that stress is\nenhancing perform better now jaegering\ncolleagues have shown that across a huge\nnumber of different experiments in fact\nthere's a paper published quite recently\nthis was about a year ago in July of\n2022 in the journal Nature so Apex\nJournal published as a full article in\nNature and Science and elsewhere they\nhave letters and shorter formats like\nreports and then there are the Articles\nwhich correspond to major major findings\nso they published The Following results\nas an article in nature in July of 2022\nthe title of the paper is a synergistic\nmindsets intervention protects\nadolescents from stress and what I\nabsolutely love about this paper is that\nit includes a lot of different kinds of\nexperiments so for instance\nthey looked at high school students who\nsimply anticipated a stressful event and\nhad been instructed on growth mindset or\nstress's enhancing mindset or both or\ncontrol\nconditions where they weren't informed\nof those mindsets right It's always\nimportant to have control experiments\nwhere you're getting the same amount of\ninformation but it's not the same\ninformation and what they found was that\nanticipatory stress right the stress\nthat we feel in anticipation of\nsomething that we think is going to\nhappen is reduced when we are educated\nabout growth mindset and we are educated\nabout a stress's enhancing mindset and\nthe basic takeaway from that experiment\nwas yes indeed being educated on what a\ngrowth mindset is and how it differs\nfrom a fixed mindset which you now have\nbeen educated on\ndefinitely buffers you against stress in\naddition being educated on how stress\ncan enhance performance can buffer you\nagainst anticipatory stress\nbut it is clearly the case that when one\nis educated on both of those things\ngrowth mindset and stresses enhancing\nmindsets that one observes the greatest\nbuffering or offset of the stress\nresponse in ways that can improve\nperformance now that is but one\nexperiment of the six yes six\nexperiments included in this single\nPaper now I'm not going to go through\neach of those six experiments in detail\nand just as a side note I've invited Dr\nDavid Yeager to be a guest on this\npodcast and he has agreed so when he's a\nguest on this podcast I'm sure he will\ndetail all the intricacies of those\nexperiments in order to inform us about\nexactly what was done and how so that we\ncan benefit from that information but\njust by way of example another\nexperiment in this paper\nuse what was called the trigger social\nstress test and the reason I'm going to\nhighlight this a little bit is because I\nthink it relates to a lot of things that\nmany of us have experienced and that\nwill experience that are considered\nstressful and of course we would all\nlike ways to buffer ourselves against\nstress and or leverage that stress to\nimprove our performance\nas well as adopt a growth mindset so the\ntry our social stress test is a kind of\nstandard mode of stressing people out in\nthe laboratory or in the classroom where\nbasically a subject comes in you tell\nthem to wait a little bit of time then\nyou measure their stress response at\nrest you're looking at their heart rate\ntheir blood pressure you might have them\nspit into a little tube and use that\nsaliva to measure cortisol because\nthat's how you measure cortisol\nthen you're going to tell them that\nthey're going to prepare a speech for\npresentation in front of a small group\nof actual people then they actually have\nto deliver that speech in front of that\naudience during that speech sometimes\nthe people who are observing it are\ngiving feedback like frowns crossed arms\nEtc\nthen there's a pop quiz where they get a\nhard arithmetic test in front of that\naudience and when they get answer is\nwrong they're told they're wrong in\nfront of that audience this all might\nseem kind of playful and silly to you\nbut most people do not experience this\nas playful and silly almost everybody\nwho goes into one of these experiments\nas a subject\nfeel some level of stress especially\nthose that don't like public speaking\nespecially those that don't see\nthemselves as very proficient in\narithmetic or that don't like to work\nout problems in real time in front of\npeople you can see how this would be\nstressful and all the while measures of\npsychological and physiological\nreactivity are being measured peripheral\nblood flow the thing we talked about\nearlier among those what I just\ndescribed is pretty extensive but I\nprovide all that as a backdrop\nso that you can understand what happened\nbefore which was people were simply\neducated on growth mindset how it\ndiffers from fixed mindset and or stress\nenhances performance mindset or not\nso basically what we have here is a\ncondition in which people are just\ngetting information right there's no\npill there's no treadmill there's no\ngoing home and doing a bunch of problem\nsets and what they observe in this\nexperiment and all the other experiments\ncontained within this quite massive\npaper\nis that the mere learning about growth\nmindset and stresses enhancing mindsets\nallows these students to shift their\nphysiology\nso enhance peripheral blood flow changes\nin hormone secretion like cortisol n\nshifts in their psychology such that\nwhen they feel stressed they start to\nsee that and experience that as an\nopportunity for Challenge and to lean\ninto that challenge and where they are\ntold that they got the wrong answer\nwhere they are told that they are not\nperforming well they are able to think\nabout that and to allocate their mental\nresources such that they do start to\nperform better and the major takeaway\nfrom the study is that across the board\nin all six experiments in Imagine stress\nin real stress laboratory stress actual\nclassroom stress and in embracing future\nchallenges\njust the learning about what stress can\nenhance your performance mindset is\nallowed students to do just that now\nanother really interesting feature of\nthis study put out by Jager and\ncolleagues was that the interventions\nwere one time and relatively brief or we\ncould even say extremely brief whereas a\nlot of previous experiments had looked\nat growth mindset interventions that\nwere on the order of you know four to\nsix to eight tutorials lasting anywhere\nfrom 30 minutes to an hour each this\nexperiment employed just one 30-minute\nintervention\nso when I heard about these results and\nread the paper I got very excited I\nwanted to know what is this magic\nintervention exactly and I'm sure you're\nthinking the same so I contacted Dr\nYeager and he was gracious enough to\nprovide me some examples of what's\ncontained within this tutorial so that I\ncould give you those examples in real\ntime during this episode so basically\nthe tutorial starts off with a question\nabout stress it actually has a little\nfield where you can fill in an answer to\nthe following question\ncan you recall a time when you\nexperienced stress and what was that\nstress related to and here I'm\nparaphrasing so what I put in response\nto this because I actually filled out\nthe form itself was when I was a postdoc\nwhich by the way is the four to six year\nperiod of time that comes after your PhD\ntraining\nI wrote when I was a postdoc\nI was under a lot of competitive\npressure to try and finish my projects I\nwas working under a diminished income\nmeaning I wasn't getting paid very much\nrelative to the cost of living in the\narea I lived at the time and I was also\nsocially isolated from a lot of my\nfriends that previously I had lived very\nclose to that was a stressful time that\nI could recall in fact no other time in\nmy life as I recall was as stressful as\nbeing a postdoc which is not to say that\nI didn't enjoy being a postdoc I\ndelighted in doing the science I did and\nbeing surrounded by the people I was\nsurrounded by but it was very very\nstressful for those and additional\nreasons so that's how this tutorial\nstarts off and I believe that the reason\nthat they asked that question at the\nbeginning of the tutorial is to kind of\ncue up cognitive mechanisms that\nsurround one's own understanding of\nstress and then as you click through the\ntutorial\nit starts to explain of all things\nneuroscience and neuroplasticity it says\nresearch from Neuroscience tells us that\nthrough effort our brain can change it\ncan form new connections that we call\nsynapses so of course I was delighted to\nsee all that information I'm very\nfamiliar with that type of information\nIt also says things like and here I'm\nreading directly from the tutorial\ndifficulty struggle and frustration when\nyou're learning something are not signs\nthat you've reached your limits they're\nsigns that you're expanding your limits\nokay then you go to the next field and\nit says\nlet's hear from a scientist Urie\ntriceman is one of the top calculus\nprofessors here's what he tells us\nstudents on the first day of class\nquote everyone in this class will\nstruggle no matter who you are questions\nare going to be flying at you that you\ncannot answer and when that happens\nyou're going to experience stress and if\nyou don't understand that stress you'll\nthink it means oh no I don't belong here\nbut in fact that stress is an indicator\nthat your understanding is deepening\nit's not a sign that you're not learning\nit's a sign that you are learning okay\nso I could read this entire tutorial for\nyou but that would take up far too much\nof our time but I think you get the\nessence of it which is that with each\nslide within the tutorial you're being\ntold that the thing that you're\nexperiencing that could potentially feel\nnegative because it means negative\nthings you're not learning you're\nsuffering you're suffering health-wise\nyou're suffering performance wise\nis reappraised it's telling you no the\nfrustration the agitation the thought\nthat you're not capable and you're not\ncapable of getting better it's actually\nthe opposite so what this tutorial\nreally is is it's an information based\ntutorial it tells you something about\nthe brain's capacity to change it gives\nyou some True by the way mechanistic\ninformation about how synapses can\nchange and brain circuits can change\nbecause indeed they can\nand it's telling you that the negative\nsomatic bodily and cognitive\nthought-based experiences of stress that\nthose represent you getting better\nthat's simply what it is and despite it\nbeing simple in its specific message\nthat message turns out to be incredibly\npowerful how can we say that it's truly\npowerful well we could turn to\nessentially any page in this study that\nJaeger and colleagues did and see that\nfor instance the intervention again this\nis the combination of learning about\ngrowth mindset and learning that stress\ncan be performance enhancing\nled to 40 Improvement in self-regard so\nself-regard is something that can be\nmeasured we can have very negative or\nvery positive self-regard 40\nimprovements in self-regard there was a\n14 Improvement in passing of courses\nthat were of the particularly\nchallenging type and there was also a\nsignificant Improvement in passing of\ncourses that were less challenging in\naddition to that people who watched and\nengaged in this 30 minute tutorial also\ntook on additional hard challenges in\nthe future long after the intervention\nhad ceased now there are a number of\nother features of the David Yeager work\nthat I think are especially important to\nconsider but rather than go into the\nspecifics of those experiments\nI'm going to frame them in the context\nof some very specific tools that I've\nspelled out for sake of this episode\nbased on the scientific literature that\nyou can use in order to build a growth\nmindset and in order to build the stress\nenhances performance mindset now in some\nsense all of our discussion during this\nepisode up until now has served as a\ntutorial about growth mindset and about\nstress enhances performance and how\nthose two things can be combined in\norder to get a synergistic positive\neffect nonetheless I do think that it's\nuseful especially when thinking about\ncognitive tools which are often less\nconcrete and clear to people how they\ncan Implement them compared to say\nexercise tools like you know get two 100\nminutes of Zone 2 cardio per week or get\nsix sets of resistance exercise per\nmajor muscle group per week Etc all of\nthat stuff in the physical domain is\nvery concrete whereas stuff that relates\nto tools in the cognitive domain\nsometimes can feel a little bit abstract\nso for that we reason I'm just going to\ntake a couple of minutes and list off\nsome of the key elements to building up\na growth mindset and a stress enhances\nperformance mindset that are gleaned\nfrom the literature that I've talked\nabout now and related literature the\nfirst tool is that whenever possible if\nboth the teacher and the student can\nadopt a growth mindset and a stress\nenhances performance mindset that's the\nbest case scenario this has been shown\nin the classroom and it's been shown in\nother contexts as well and again it\nsimply means learning about what growth\nmindset is and how it differs from fixed\nmindset it also ideally means learning\nhow stress can enhance performance now\nif that means\nspending some time with the discussion\nthat we had around Dr Alia crum's data\nthat would be great if it also means\njust thinking about the stress response\nand understanding that that stress\nresponse indeed is mobilizing resources\nit's focusing your vision more narrowly\nright you sort of lose the forest\nthrough the trees and yet that allows\nyou to really analyze carefully whatever\nit is that you choose to focus your\nattention on well then that's going to\nbe performance enhancing again these\ntools are purely cognitive but they are\nwell supported by the data and the data\nalso tell us that when teachers and\nstudents both adopt this mindset the\nteachers are viewing the students as\nless fixed in their abilities and the\nstudents are viewing themselves as less\nfixed in their abilities the next tool\nwhich is a really fundamental one to\neverything we're talking about was\nactually mentioned at the beginning of\nthe episode which is whenever giving\npraise or giving feedback of any kind to\nothers or to yourself perhaps even\nespecially to yourself\nmake the effort to make that feedback\nabout verbs not labels okay to really\nthink about\npraising or in some cases maybe giving\nfeedback about how effort could have\nbeen better but ideally you're saying\ngreat effort it was great that when you\nmissed that shot on goal that you ran\nback to your side of the field it was\ngreat that when you didn't perform well\non that math exam\nthat you went back to those problem sets\nand that you conversed with other\nstudents about why they had performed a\ncertain way and you really dug through\nit and figured out why you got things\nwrong now a key aspect of this tool of\nfocusing on verbs not labels is that it\nis especially important to do this when\nyou've performed well I talked about the\nreasons a little bit earlier but I\ncannot emphasize this enough when you've\nperformed well if you tell yourself or\nyou tell somebody else that they're just\na great athlete they're just a great\nstudent they're talented they're\nbrilliant I promise you you are\nundermining their future performance\nwhen they inevitably encounter challenge\nif however you give yourself or the\nother person feedback that's really\ngrounded in effort and persistence in\nproblem solving you are absolutely going\nthe right direction now if you are going\nto give feedback about errors either to\nyourself or to somebody else\nthe question really is do you paint that\nwith rose-colored glasses do you try and\nmake it seem like the errors weren't\nthat bad that's not actually what we're\ntalking about we're not talking about\nwhat do they say putting lipstick on a\npig what we're talking about is\nlooking at those errors and thinking\nabout what led up to those errors and\ntrying to put more of our cognitive\nattention on the verbs the things that\nled to those errors and less of our\nattention on the emotions related to\nthose errors we really need to be\nanalytic about those errors and\nadmittedly\nwe often need to take a day or two or\nmaybe even longer before we can do that\nprocess effectively right nothing that\nI've said thus far has said that we have\nto do all of this immediately after an\nerror or immediately after a poor\nperformance sometimes we are so caught\nup in the emotional experience of having\nperformed not as well as we would have\nliked that there's simply no way that we\ncan allocate our mental resources toward\nerror analysis ideally we can but\noftentimes we can so we have to be how\ndo they say gentle with ourselves and\nallow ourselves to move through that\nprocess and then get back to error\nanalysis that's absolutely key but we\nreally want to focus on the verbs\nleading to those errors not putting\nlabels on the stupid ridiculous silly\nfill in your blank with whatever\nnegative label you might happen to come\nup with okay so verbs verbs verbs for\nanalyzing why we did well and verbs\nverbs verbs for analyzing why we did\npoorly now you may have noticed that a\nfew minutes ago I mentioned that\noftentimes it's beneficial that when we\nmake errors that we seek out others who\neither performed well\nideally but also those who performed\npoorly in order to get some\nunderstanding as to why we did not\nperform as well as we wanted and that\nraises another key tool there are a lot\nof data now to support the fact that one\nof the key ways to analyze our errors is\nto get help and this is one of the\nthings that really differentiates the\nhigh performers from the low performers\nover time and yes there I just used a\nlabel well I guess I could have said the\nhigh effort which leads to Performance\npeople versus the low effort which leads\nto low performance people but in any\ncase you get the idea people who perform\nwell over time\nregardless of labels that we place on\nthem tend to be people who seek help in\norder to understand why they didn't\nperform well so this is a core component\nof not just trying and building a growth\nmindset but really solidifying a growth\nmindset and a stress can enhance\nperformance mindset so seek help from\nothers in understanding where you didn't\nperform as well as you like and I would\nsay Seek input from others as to what\nwere the verbs that you think might have\nled to your heightened performance\nbecause we like to think that we have\nreally good Optics on why we did well oh\nyeah it was because I spent X number of\nhours practicing but oftentimes those\naround us have additional perspectives\nthat we can't access and learning about\nthose perspectives of why we've\nperformed poorly but also why we\nperformed well\nin the context of these verbs not labels\nis also tremendously beneficial the\nother thing that's clear from the\nliterature on growth mindset and stress\ncan enhance performance mindset\nis that\nall of that stuff all those tutorials\nare most effective when both teachers\nand students Embrace those mindsets now\nthat's a wonderful situation if teachers\nand students are both available and\nwilling to learn those mindsets however\nfor many of us we don't have a teacher\nwe don't have a mentor we're doing all\nof this on our own\nand so what's fortunate is that there\nare also data in the literature showing\nthat under conditions where either the\nteacher or the mentor is not there or is\nnot embracing a growth mindset or stress\nenhances performance mindset we actually\ncan serve as our own teacher\nby using a simple tool and the simple\ntool that was actually the same tool\nthat was used in one of the Jaeger\nstudies is to take maybe a three by five\ncard or an eight and a half by eleven\nsheet of paper and write out a letter\nas if you're writing a letter to the\nnext person coming along trying to get\ngood at the thing that you're trying to\nget good at and explain to them what\ngrowth mindset is and how it differs\nfrom a fixed mindset explain to them\nwhat the stress enhances performance\nmindset is how to adopt it and how it\ncan amplify performance\nthat simple exercise of writing a letter\nwhich is essentially to oneself but\nyou're sort of pretending that the\nletter is for somebody else although I\nsuppose you could and perhaps should\ngive it to somebody else so they can\nbenefit that simple exercise has been\nshown to improve one's own performance\nand to do so in dramatic ways not just\nin the immediate term but also in the\nfuture now the final tool I'd like to\nshare is one that I've come up with but\nit's one that's really grounded in the\nNeuroscience of neuroplasticity\nand believe it or not that's grounded in\nour understanding of exercise physiology\nand that is to reframe this idea that\nthe mind is like a muscle I know we hear\nthat over and over again the mind is\nlike a muscle you know you exercise a\nmuscle it gets stronger\nyou exercise your mind you put it\nthrough some strain and you can learn\nthose statements are absolutely true but\nthis statement that the mind is like a\nmuscle that analogy falls short I\nbelieve in an important way that can\nlead a lot of people astray when they\ntry and embrace growth mindset and the\nstress enhances performance mindset and\nthe reason I say that is the following\nexercise with weights or resistance\ntraining of any kind whether or not it's\nbody weight or machines or free weights\nhas an incredible property to it in that\nit increases blood flow to the muscles\nthat we're training right this is\nsomething that really distinguishes\nresistance training from other forms of\ntraining like long distance running\nwhen we train our muscles with\nresistance the blood flow into that\nmuscle the so-called pump gives us a\nsort of a hint or a window of the growth\nof that muscle that is likely to occur\nif we allow that muscle to recover after\nthat resistance training in other words\nresistance training provides us a kind\nof hint of the results we are likely to\nget so when we hear the analogy that the\nmind is like a muscle I think it falls\nshort because when we strain to learn\nsomething with our mind we don't\nactually get to feel what it is to\nperform much better\nas we are trying to learn that thing\nactually quite the contrary in fact much\nof what we've been talking about today\nis the fact that the stress and strain\nand the disappointment that is so\nreflexively felt when we look at our\ndiminished performances we're trying to\nlearn is actually the trigger for\ninvoking the learning itself so what I'm\nsaying here is that it is not the case\nthat when we go in to learn a language\nor a new skill or\nmathematics or something new that for a\nmoment we are fluent or partially fluent\nand then we lose that ability when we\nwalk out of the classroom or the\ntutorial\nthat's what makes it different than the\ngym where you go and you lift weights or\nyou use a resistance training of any\nkind and you get this sort of window\ninto oh this is what the muscle will\nfeel like and look like when it's larger\nso the mind is like a muscle analogy\nsort of works in the sense that if you\nproperly stress a muscle using\nresistance training and then you give it\nan adequate amount of time to recover it\nindeed will get bigger and stronger\nand it is true that when you go in to\ntry and learn something if you provide\nthe adequate stress which is hitting\nthat point where you're not\nunderstanding the information it's not\nsinking in and you give yourself some\ntime to recover which requires sleep by\nthe way\nthen you'll learn that new information\nover time but where the mind is like a\nmuscle analogy really Falls away I\nbelieve is that the mind is not like a\nmuscle because you don't actually get to\nexperience the good growth that you're\nseeking as you're trying to learn it\nrather everything we've been talking\nabout today is about learning how to\nexperience the strain of trying to learn\nthe agitation of trying to learn as the\nlearning process itself and\nunderstanding that while you might feel\nback on your heels a little or a lot\nduring that process that you might and\nin fact very likely are going to\nexperience all the category of things\nthat go along with stress elevated heart\nrate frustration you know maybe even a\nlittle headache or strain difficulty\nmaintaining Focus Etc that if you\nunderstand that all of those things are\nactually creating the specific\nneurochemical and neural circuit\nconditions to invoke learning well then\nthat learning will occur so in some ways\na better analogy would be if it were the\ncase that when you do resistance\ntraining that your muscles actually got\nsmaller during the training and then\nrebounded to being even bigger than they\nwere prior to the training that would be\nthe appropriate analogy for the mind is\nlike a muscle I say all this because yes\nadopting a growth mindset is incredibly\nvaluable adopting a stress can enhance\nperformance mindset is incredibly\nvaluable and even more valuable is\ncombining those two mindsets because\nthey do indeed improve performance\nsynergistically however none of this\nprocess is expected to be reflexive for\nmost people perhaps for anybody and the\nprocess of building up these mindsets\ninvolves another mindset which is the\none that umbrellas them all or gathers\nthem all together and makes them really\nwork which is the idea that mindsets are\nindeed powerful that they can have a\nreal effect and that while they do take\ntime to cultivate they can be cultivated\nthank you for joining me today for our\ndiscussion about growth mindset what it\nis and how to cultivate a growth mindset\nas well as the
