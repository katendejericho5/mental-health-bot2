    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: [OPENING THEME\nMUSIC] Welcome to the Huberman Lab\npodcast, where we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof Neurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr.\nRobert Malenka.\nDr.\nRobert Malenka is a professor of\nPsychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at\nStanford University School of Medicine.\nHe is both medical doctor, an\nMD, and a researcher, a PhD.\nHis laboratory is famous for having\ndiscovered some of the key components\nallowing neuroplasticity, that is,\nthe nervous system's ability to\nchange in response to experience.\nIn addition, Dr.\nMalanka's research is considered\ncentral to the textbook knowledge\nabout how reward systems in the\nbrain are organized and function.\nIndeed, Dr.\nMelanca's research over the last ten or\n15 years has merged what was once two\ndisparate fields, the first being the\nstudy of neuroplasticity, again, the\nnervous system's ability to change in\nresponse to experience, and the other\nfield being the field of dopamine as\nit relates to pleasure and addiction.\nHis laboratory has shown, for instance,\nthat when we seek out particular forms\nof pleasure, regardless of whether or not\nthey are healthy for us, that changes the\nway that our reward circuitry works and\nactually changes the way that dopamine\nis released and how it impacts the brain.\nAnd his work has also informed how we\nseek out healthy pleasures, including\nhealthy food and social connection.\nToday's discussion explores all of\nthese topics, and by the end of today's\ndiscussion, you will have a rich\nunderstanding of how neurochemicals like\ndopamine and serotonin work in parallel,\nto reinforce that is, to increase the\nprobability that we will engage in\ncertain types of thinking and behaviors.\nSo if you are somebody interested\nin neuroplasticity, that is, how the\nnervous system can change in response\nto experience and or you are interested\nin reward systems, what motivates us,\nand what we are likely to pursue in\nthe future, given our choices of past,\nand if you are interested in things\nlike social connection and empathy,\nor lack thereof, today's discussion\nencompasses all of those topics.\nIt is worth mentioning that Dr.\nMalenka is a true luminary in all\nof the fields I just mentioned,\nas well as several other fields.\nIn fact, when you look out on the\nlandscape of modern neuroscience,\nwhat you'll discover is that a\nvery large percentage of the top\nlaboratories studying neuroplasticity\nand reward systems and so on, all\nstemmed from having trained in Dr.\nMalenka's laboratory.\nSo it's a real honor and pleasure to\nbe able to host him today, and I'm sure\nthat our discussion is going to greatly\nenrich the way that you think about brain\nfunction, neuroplasticity, and reward.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo all American swimmers from\nStanford, and everything about\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were\ndesigned with performance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime working on the\nbiology of the visual system, and I\ncan tell you that your visual system\nhas to contend with an enormous\nnumber of challenges in order for\nyou to be able to see clearly.\nROKA understands those challenges\nand the biology of the visual system\nsuch that they've designed sunglasses\nand eyeglasses that always allow\nyou to see with crystal clarity.\nNow, initially, ROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were designed for sports\nperformance, and as a consequence,\nall of their glasses are designed to\nbe very lightweight and to not slip\noff your face if you get sweaty.\nHowever, the design of the glasses\nincludes some that are specifically for\nsport and others whose aesthetic really\nallows you to use them for sport, as\nwell as out to dinner or to work, etc.\nAnd that's how I use them.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses, you can go to roka.com,\nthat's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code\nHUBERMAN to save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's roka.com, and enter\nthe code HUBERMAN at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Levels.\nLevels is a program that lets you\nsee how different foods and behaviors\naffect your health by giving you\nreal time feedback on your diet\nusing a continuous glucose monitor.\nOne of the most important factors\nimpacting your immediate and long\nterm health is the way that your\nbody manages its blood glucose, or\nsometimes referred to as blood sugar\nlevels, to maintain energy and focus.\nThroughout the day, you want to\nkeep your blood glucose steady\nwithout big spikes or dips.\nUsing Levels, you can monitor how\ndifferent types of foods and different\nfood combinations, as well as food\ntiming and things like exercise, combine\nto impact your blood glucose levels.\nI started using Levels a little over a\nyear ago, and it gave me a lot of insight\ninto how specific foods were spiking my\nblood sugar and then leaving me feeling\ntired for several hours afterwards, as\nwell as how the spacing of exercise and\nmy meals was impacting my overall energy.\nAnd in doing so, it really allowed\nme to optimize how I eat, what I eat,\nwhen I exercise, and so on, such that\nmy blood glucose levels and energy\nlevels are stable throughout the day.\nIf you're interested in learning more\nabout Levels and trying a continuous\nglucose monitor yourself, go to\nlevels.link/huberman right now,\nLevels is offering an additional\ntwo free months of membership.\nAgain, that's levels.link\nL-I-N-K /huberman to get two\nfree months of membership.\nAnd now for my discussion with Dr.\nRobert Malenka.\nDr.\nMelanka, Rob, welcome.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah,\nthanks for having me.\nAndrew Huberman: Delighted to have you\nhere, both for sake of your medical\nknowledge and training as a psychiatrist\nand of course as a luminary in the field\nof neuroplasticity, dopamine and reward\nsystems, social systems, your knowledge\nof autism and social interactions,\na newer interest in, or perhaps old\ninterest in psychedelics and what they're\ndoing and potential for mental health.\nThere are just so many things\nthat you've done in this field.\nI've been a long,\nlongtime fan of your work.\nSince your days as an assistant\nprofessor, I've tracked your career.\nI've learned a tremendous amount\nfrom you by observing you and\nfrom being your colleague.\nSo really delighted to have you here.\nRobert Malenka: You're making me\nblush, and I don't blush easily.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, it's all true.\nRobert Malenka: Thank you.\nAndrew Huberman: And I will say as\nwell, you've also trained an enormous\nnumber of incredible scientists.\nKarl Deisseroth, the Karl Deisseroth,\nAnna Lemke always speaks incredibly\nhighly of you as a mentor and somebody\nshe's learned a tremendous amount from\nand pretty much anyone that's worked on\nneuroplasticity, on dopamine and reward\nsystems, addiction, and now in the\nfields of autism and soon psychedelics\nas well, references you often, and you've\nbeen mentioned many times before on\nthis podcast, if not by name, by work.\nSo again, thank you for being here.\nI'd love to kick off the conversation\nby talking about something which is very\nfundamental to everything we're going\nto talk about, but certainly fundamental\nto our daily lives, which is dopamine.\nWe hear so much about dopamine.\nPeople talk about dopamine hits.\nPeople think about dopamine as pleasure,\ndopamine reward for the novice.\nHow would you frame the dopamine system?\nI mean, it does a bunch of different\nthings in different areas of\nthe brain and body, but to you\nwhat does dopamine represent as\nits major function in the brain?\nAnd could you give us a kind of\ngeneral contour of the neural circuits\nthat allow this chemical to more or\nless put value on our experiences?\nRobert Malenka: Yeah,\nthat's very well put.\nAs you point out, dopamine is one of\nthe major, what we term neuromodulators\nin the brain, a chemical signaling\nmessenger that the brain uses to\nmediate a complex array of actions.\nIts best well known function is in what\nwe call the brain's reward circuitry.\nSo this is a circuit in the brain.\nAnd when we use the term circuit,\nwhat we really mean is one\npart of the brain communicating\nwith another part of the brain.\nBecause the brain is this very\ncomplex, it's the most complex\norgan in the universe, with lots\nof different nerve cells talking\nto each other simultaneously.\nAnd as neuroscientists, we try to parse\nwhat different brain areas are doing and\nwhat different neuromodulators might be\ndoing, and dopamine was discovered, oh,\nI should know this, many decades ago.\nAnd it's, as I said, the major\nchemical messenger molecule in the\nso called brain's reward circuitry.\nAnd when you're talking about, so\nwhat is the brain's reward circuitry?\nThis is a part of the brain\nthat tells us something is\nreinforcing in our environment.\nSome stimuli is \"rewarding,\" makes\nus feel better or good, although\nthat's a gross oversimplification.\nBefore getting into the details of\ndopamine and its function in the reward\ncircuitry, I think it's useful to talk\nabout, why do we need a reward circuitry?\nWhy do we need something in our brain\nthat tells us, this feels good or this\nfeels bad, and it goes back to evolution.\nI am a biological scientist.\nThat means I believe in evolution.\nAnd if you think about the evolution\nof our species, everything is\ndriven by developing mechanisms\nthat increase our survival.\nAnd it's really useful, you need something\nin your nervous system that tells you\nsome stimuli in your environment is\nimportant for your survival, or some\nstimulus in your environment is dangerous.\nSo it's not magic that sugary,\nhigh fat laden foods are highly\nreinforcing and rewarding.\nIt's not an accident.\nThere has to be a mechanism in\nthe brain that tells us that.\nIt's not an accident, that most\nof the time, for most of us,\na sexual experience is pretty\nreinforcing, is pretty rewarding.\nIt's not an accident that warmth\nfeels really good when you're cold.\nThat water tastes much better\nwhen you're really thirsty.\nWhat evolved is a mechanism to tell\nour nervous systems and tell our\nbrains, this feels pretty good,\nI should repeat the behavior that\nleads to that rewarding experience.\nAnd similarly, it's really important when\nthere is an event in your life that's\nhighly dangerous for some mechanism in\nyour brain to say, whoa, I don't want\nto go back to where that lion was.\nAnd we can get into that.\nSo this was a long winded way of\nsaying what the reward circuitry\ntells us is this event, this stimulus.\nIt could be an external stimulus,\nlike I said, a Krispy Kreme\ndonut, which I happen to love.\nAnd I have to be very disciplined,\nso I don't eat too many of them.\nIt could be a drug of abuse, and maybe\nwe'll talk about that a little bit.\nAll of these stimuli seem to activate\nand cause the release of dopamine\nin this brain's reward circuitry.\nSo now we need to get into\na little bit of detail.\nNeuroscientists use these very unfriendly\nterms to describe different brain regions.\nSo the home of dopamine cells, or\nbrain cells, are called neurons.\nSo the home of dopamine neurons\nare in a part of the brain, sort\nof what we call the lower midbrain.\nThe dopamine neurons that are part of\nthe reward circuitry are found in this\narea called the ventral tegmental area,\nwhich, I'm sorry to have to use such\ntechnical jargon, we call it the VTA.\nThat's the acronym.\nAndrew Huberman: I think the roof o f\nthe midbrain is the tectum, it means\nroof, and the base of the midbrain, it\nmeans floor, which is the tegmentum.\nSo there's a rationale, but it doesn't\nhelp much at all to know the names.\nRobert Malenka: And, in fact,\nyou are absolutely correct,\nand I always forget that.\nSo thank you for pointing that out.\nAndrew Huberman: It's a side\neffect of teaching neuronatomy.\nRobert Malenka: Which I once did\nback in the early 80s, but I've\nforgotten everything I taught.\nAnyhow, so these dopamine neurons,\nand we can talk about other types of\ndopamine neurons, they send messages,\nwhat we call projections, using\ntelegraph wires that we call axons.\nThey send projections to many different\nbrain regions, the key one in the brain's\nreward circuitry being an area, again,\nwith a very complicated name called the\nnucleus accumbens, and maybe Andrew.\nYou know, I actually don't know how that\nname evolved, the nucleus accumbens.\nAnd I'm sure I should know, because I've\nbeen studying it for 30 years, but I have\nnever looked up the genesis of that name.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, the fortunate\nthing about this podcast is it's\nboth on audio platforms like Spotify\nand Apple, but also on YouTube.\nAnd so now we can be absolutely\nsure that somebody has put it into\nthe YouTube comments underneath\nthis episode, and therefore\neveryone will learn, including us.\nRobert Malenka: So I don't know the\norigins of t he word nucleus, and it's\na gross oversimplification, but it's\nthe activity of these dopamine neurons\nin the ventral tegmental area that\nthen cause the release of this powerful\nneuromodulator, dopamine, in the nucleus\naccumbens, which is part of another\nbrain structure with a tough to remember\nname called the ventral striatum.\nAnd then magic happens, and when I say\nmagic happens, even though we've been\nstudying how dopamine modifies the\nproperties of cells in this nucleus\naccumbens, the truth is, we don't\nhave a deep mechanistic understanding\nwhy, when dopamine is released in the\nnucleus accumbens, we experience that.\nAs I'm being very cautious here,\nthe simple way would be to say\nas highly rewarding, but it's a\nlittle more complicated than that.\nWhat it tells us is that there's\nsomething really important\nhappening in our environment.\nAndrew Huberman: So could we say\nthat it cues the arousal system?\nRobert Malenka: It gets\nthe arousal system going.\nThere're close ties to our memory systems,\nwhich hopefully, intuitively, makes\nsome sense if something really important\nis happening in your environment.\nBecause, again, I think what's helpful\nfor your audience is to always be\nthinking about how these systems evolved\nfrom an evolutionary perspective.\nAnd if dopamine is signaling something\nreally important and salient is happening\nin your environment, you want to remember\nthat it could be a highly rewarding\nexperience, like a source of food for me.\nI like all donuts, so I don't want\nto emphasize any one manufacturer\nof one donut versus the other.\nI like sugar laden, fat laden foods.\nThat's why I never eat them,\nbecause I like them so much.\nAnd I use that as an example,\nbut because that was an\nimportant event for my survival.\nThis reward circuitry, yes, it\nstimulates my arousal system.\nIt gets me to pay attention.\nIt also has very close\nties to memory systems.\nAnd to go off on a little bit of a\ntangent, I think the one, I don't want\nto say it's a mistake, I think perhaps\nsomewhat oversimplification of how\npeople conceptualize dopamine's role\nin the brain is, even though it's a\nmajor, important role, is for it to\nbe active and released during highly\nreinforcing experiences like sex, like\nreally good food, like drugs of abuse.\nIt also can get activated, subdivisions\nof this system, during painful\nstimuli and during aversive stimuli,\nwhich, again, are really important\nfor you to be aware of, to say, oh\nmy God, that's really bad for me.\nSo the dopamine system, this reward\ncircuitry and its subcomponents\nthat maybe, perhaps signal more\nsalience or aversion in the\nenvironment, are closely tied to\narousal systems and memory systems.\nAgain, hopefully, for somewhat obvious\nreasons, you want to remember powerfully\nreinforcing events in your life, as\nwell as powerfully emotionally or\nphysically painful events in your life.\nSo I hope I answered your\nquestion to a modest degree.\nAndrew Huberman: No, far\nbetter than a modest degree.\nThat's an excellent description of the\ndopamine system from a true expert.\nAnd the question I have is about\nsome of the context and nuance of\nthe system, but in sort of real world\nterms, how should I think about this?\nEven in my training as a neuroscientist,\nI know neurons can be a little active,\na lot active, everything in between.\nThey can be active over long periods\nof time or short periods of time.\nBut let's use the example of the donut.\nI like a glazed old fashioned donut.\nI actually don't have a craving for\nsweet thIngs, but donuts is an exception.\nI like the glazed old fashioned donut,\nbut if I were to see just a little piece\nof a glazed old fashioned donut versus a\nfull glazed old fashioned donut, could I\nexpect that more dopamine is released to\nthe anticipation of the complete donut?\nAnd then the other question is, how does\ncontext influence the dopamine system?\nFor instance, if I'm very\nfull, a glazed old fashioned\ndonut might be aversive to me.\nWhereas if I'm just a little bit hungry,\nor if I'm actually more on a schedule\nof rewarding myself for abstaining from\nsweet, fatty foods, then abstaining from\nthe food might be its own form of reward.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: And so, to me, the\ndopamine system seems incredibly\nsimple and yet incredibly prone to\nimmediate context and the kinds of\nnuance that we're constantly juggling.\nI'll interrupt myself to say that\nwe're constantly juggling a bunch\nof different reward contingencies.\nWe want to have good health\nmetrics and maybe have a certain\naesthetic qualities to our body,\nbut we also want the doughnut.\nAnd so how does a system as simple\nas one neuromodulator system and\nthe VTA to nucleus accumbens, and\nwith some connections to the memory\narea, how does it balance all of\nthat information in real time?\nTo me, that's just, like, staggeringly\ncomplex, but also incredibly interesting.\nRobert Malenka: I think you,,, beautifully\nput, very eloquent description.\nYou just said it.\nIt's staggeringly simple,\nsimultaneously staggeringly complex.\nAnd you asked several different questions.\nSo context makes an enormous importance.\nAnd that's one of the reasons I\nbecame interested in the dopamine\nreward circuitry is, as you know, as a\ncolleague in the academic neuroscience\nworld, but your listeners probably\ndon't, I started out my career studying\nvery basic mechanisms of plasticity.\nHow does the brain modify itself?\nAnd what makes the brain different\nthan the computer hardware is\nthe physical connections in the\nbrain are constantly changing the\nstrength of the communication.\nSimilarly for the dopamine reward\ncircuitry, it's highly plastic and\nit's highly contextually dependent.\nAnd so you gave the example of\ndonuts and feeding, and I'll answer\nyour question about the cues.\nYes, I used to give the example of\nThanksgiving, so let me give that example.\nIn the morning of Thanksgiving, all,\nfor most of us in the United States,\nthe morning of Thanksgiving, if you're\nat home visiting your parents, the\nsmells of the apple pie, the smells\nof the turkey cooking are highly\nrepetitive, highly reinforcing.\nYou're anticipating that fun event.\nYou're anticipating Uncle Joe coming\nto visit you for Thanksgiving.\nAnd that's all because these cues, the\nsmells, the anticipation of Uncle Joe,\nyour previous experiences, are part of\nyour memory system, sort of talking to,\nin a simple way, your reward circuitry.\nSo you're building up this\nanticipation, one could almost say\nthis craving, which maybe we'll talk\nabout in the context of addiction.\nAnd then, make a long story\nshort, think about that evening\nat the end of Thanksgiving.\nThose exact same cues, the exact\nsame smell of the apple pie,\nturkey, and Uncle Joe himself.\nAt the very least, they're no\nlonger repetitive, meaning they\nmight actually be aversive.\nThe last thing you want\nis a piece of apple pie.\nYou can't wait for Uncle Joe to\nleave your Thanksgiving dinner.\nAnd I always argue that\ndoes not happen magically.\nThat happens because your brain has been\nmodified by the context in which it sits.\nAnd this very important modulatory\nsystem, this reward circuitry, is\nresponding to the exact same stimuli\nwith a very different response.\nSo I'm just telling you, I'm repeating\nwhat you said, the phenomenology.\nAnd again, my other favorite example\nis any of us who have been in an\nintimate relationship knows that the\nlove of your life can turn to the\nbane of your existence in 20 seconds.\nAnd again, that doesn't happen magically.\nThis person who you crave, who you\nlove, does something, and two minutes\nlater, your brain is saying, oh, my\nGod, I may have to break up with this\nperson, or, this is an incredibly\npainful emotional experience, and what\nfascinates me about the brain is, how\ndoes the brain mediate that rapid change?\nSo now back to, so, yes, context\nis everything about how this\npowerful neuromodule choice\nsystem that uses dopamine works,\nand the truth is, we don't know.\nIt's because the inputs onto these\ndopamine neurons, the other nerve\ncells that are driving the activity\nof the dopamine neurons, and I've\nactually studied this in my lab at\nStanford University with a colleague\nyou know well, Lee Chun Luo, who's\na world class neuroscientist.\nWe've studied the complexity of the\nneuroanatomy of the dopamine system,\nand these dopamine neurons in the\nventral tegmental area, the source of\nthe reward circuitry, dopamine, are\nreceiving inputs from all over the brain.\nThey're receiving indirectly\nor directly inputs from visual\nareas, from somatosensory areas.\nAnd I'm not giving you a really good\nanswer because that's one of the goals\nof my research, to try to understand\nhow context, how the history that\nyou've had with these cues, which we're\ngoing to get back to of the donut or\nof a drug, how has that modified how\nthis neuromodulatory system responds?\nSimilarly, the nucleus accumbens, the\ntarget of this powerful modulator,\ndopamine, is receiving communications,\nwhat we call inputs from all sorts\nof brain regions that you know about.\nAndrew, your audience may not.\nIt receives inputs from an area called\nthe hippocampus, which you may have\ncovered in previous podcasts, which\nis very powerfully, very important for\nmemories, both establishing new memories\nand, again, remember, that makes sense.\nYou want this system, this\ndopamine reward circuitry, to be\nvery connected to memory systems.\nSo the activity in the nucleus\naccumbens is modulated by dopamine\nwhile it is receiving information from\nthe hippocampus, which helps encode\nnew memories, while it's receiving\ninformation from a brain area called the\namygdala, which is a part of the brain\ninvolved in our emotional experiences.\nThe accumbens also receives\ninputs from the prefrontal\ncortex, which is this brain area.\nAs you know better than me,\nAndrew, is important for decision\nmaking, for planning our activity,\nand I could go on and on.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, could we talk\nabout prefrontal cortex for a moment,\nbecause it always was surprising to me\nthat prefrontal cortex is talked about\nas this higher executive function area.\nBut then when you look at the\nneuroanatomy, it's, as we say,\nmonosynaptically, as you and I know,\none connection away from structures\nlike the amygdala, one connection\naway from structures like the nucleus\naccumbens . In other words, prefrontal\ncortex, to me, is every bit as ancient\nas some of these other structures\nthat we think of as more ancient,\nand really, the whole ancient evolved\nthing gets a little bit dicey because\ncertain areas aren't like the prefrontal\ncortex, are more elaborated in humans.\nBut to me, the prefrontal cortex seems\nto be especially important in the context\nof this thing of scaling the reward\nresponse, or context of the reward\nresponse, because it can set rules.\nIt seems to know, okay, we're recording\na podcast now, and there are certain\nrules, there are certain things\nthat we're going to do and not do.\nBut what's fascinating about the, and\nI'm so glad you gave a bunch of different\nexamples, because what's fascinating, for\ninstance, about the relationship example\nis that, yes, at one moment we can adore\nsomebody, and another moment later, if\nthey do something or don't do something,\nwe can be incredibly frustrated with them.\nThey can even become aversive to us.\nHopefully, that doesn't\nhappen too frequently.\nRobert Malenka: Hopefully.\nAndrew Huberman: But I think we've all\nhad the experience of a doughnut, an\nevent, or a person actually looking\ndifferent to us from one moment to\nthe next, hopefully not at random.\nAnd so, to me, it seems like the\nprefrontal cortex is uniquely positioned\nto really say, okay, right now we are\nin a mode of, for lack of a better word,\nlove and loving, like in the verb tense of\nloving, be in the verb tense of arguing.\nWe're now arguing.\nWe're in the verb tense of reconciliation,\nkind of somewhere in between or\nsomething of that sort, and how a\nstructure in a circuit as simple as\nthe dopamine system, one molecule\ncould suddenly say, oh, you know what?\nNow getting over my anger is rewarding.\nWhereas five minutes ago, being right\nand being the most angry was rewarding,\nand then five minutes before that,\nagain, we're accelerating this movie,\nbut five minutes or five days or five\nyears before that, this person could\ndo no wrong, and the dopamine system\nis just cranking out dopamine, saying,\nwhatever you do, I'm just delighted by it.\nIncredible.\nLike, to me, I can't think of a more\ninteresting system in neuroscience.\nRobert Malenka: Well, I mean,\nthat was eloquently put.\nI agree with pretty much\neverything you said.\nI don't have much to add, because what\nyou're pointing out is the challenges\nof studying these systems, the\nimportance of studying these systems,\nand the challenge of presenting how the\nbrain works to this podcast audience.\nBecause on the one hand, you have\ndone a fantastic job over the last\nfew years in your podcast of making\ncomplex subjects accessible to a lay\naudience and get them to be thinking\nabout how our modern view of how the\nbrain works could be used to enhance\nhealth, could enhance mental well being.\nBut as neuroscientists, academic\nneuroscientists ourselves, we know,\nyou know, you are oversimplifying\nthings, and the actual functioning\nof a system like the dopamine reward\ncircuitry, as you just eloquently\npointed out, is so much more complex.\nIt's modified by these prefrontal inputs,\nwhich are simultaneously telling our\nmemory systems, pay attention here.\nI'm repeating what you just said.\nThe context makes a big difference,\nthe history you have with the person or\nstimuli with whom you're interacting.\nLike to bring this back to your which\nI never - the initial question - does\na small piece of a doughnut activate\nthe cue that, that small piece of a\ndonut activate the reward circuitry\nand cause release of dopamine to\nthe same extent as the full donut?\nDepends on your experience with donuts.\nI think for you and me, because we seem\nto both like donuts, they're highly\nrepetitive for us, probably doesn't\nmatter, because we have learned even\na little piece of a doughnut activates\nall of our memory system, saying, man,\nthat's an old fashioned glazed donut.\nI want to eat that.\nI want to get one, or I want to\nhave the discipline not to eat it.\nSo I hope I'm answering your question,\nand I'm shifting topics completely.\nBut that's why addiction\nis so challenging.\nWell, let's talk about that.\nAndrew Huberman: Let's talk about\nthat, because you've done a ton of\nimportant work in this area of addiction.\nI mean, one of the basic questions\nI have about addiction know we hear\nthat certain drugs are more addicting\nthan other drugs or certain behaviors.\nWe also hear that we can\nbecome addicted to anything.\nWhen Anna Lemke was on this\npodcast, I said, what's the most\nunusual addiction you've ever seen?\nAnd she talked about a patient who sadly\ncommitted suicide at some point later\nthat she told us had been addicted to\nwater, to drinking of any kind, first\nalcohol, but then water eventually.\nSo my question about addiction\nin the dopamine system is,\nlet's pick a drug like cocaine.\nI've never done cocaine, but\npeople who have done cocaine\ntell me that it feels very good.\nAnd one of the more salient features of\nthe cocaine high is that it comes on very\nfast, and it ends pretty quickly, too.\nIs the rate of dopamine increase\nrelated to the addictive property\nof a drug or behavior as much as\nhow much dopamine is released?\nRobert Malenka: And that's a\nvery sophisticated question,\nand the answer is yes.\nAnd that's usually the lecture I give,\nthe way I think about addiction, and\nobviously my friend and colleague\nAnna Lemke is one of the world's\nexperts in terms of the understanding\nthe human experience of addiction.\nI have studied it as a cellular molecular\nneuroscientist trying to understand\nhow addictive substances modify reward\ncircuitry, modify the connections\nin the reward circuitry, modify how\ndopamine neurons act, and the way,\nlike any, what appears to be a simple\nterm, it's layered with complexity.\nAddiction is somewhat of a continuum.\nAnd I like to think about whether\nyou're talking about substances like\ncocaine, and I will explicitly answer\nyour question soon, or opioids.\nAs you know, we're going in this\ncountry, there is an opioid epidemic.\nI do like to think about addictive\nliability, and in my view, it is\npretty clear that when we're talking\nabout drugs, they have different\ndegrees of addictive liability.\nI mean, I had a cup of coffee this\nmorning, and many of us listening to this\npodcast, it's really hard to start our\nday without getting that hit of caffeine.\nBut are we addicted to caffeine?\nThat's a tricky question, because\nI've never heard of anybody robbing\na bank to get caffeine, destroying\ntheir personal life to get caffeine.\nSo I would say caffeine causes\ntolerance, but I would not say it has a\nparticularly high addictive liability,\nwhereas drugs like psychosimulants,\nlike cocaine or opioids, have a\nvery high addictive liability.\nSo, to answer your mechanistic question,\nthere have been some famous studies\ndone by the director of the National\nInstitute on Drug Abuse, Nora Volkow.\nSimultaneously, there have been\nstudies in animal models of\naddiction where you nailed it.\nIn a rough way, the addictive liability\nof a substance is directly correlated\nwith two aspects of dopamine.\nHow much dopamine is released in\nthe accumbens and the kinetics\nof the dopamine release.\nAs you said, how rapidly it's released.\nTo get a little technical, even with\na drug like cocaine or opioids, it's\nnot only the drug itself, it's the\nroute of administration, because the\nroot of administration influences the\nkinetics, meaning how fast that drug\ngets into your brain influences the\nreward circuitry and how fast it causes\na big, rapid release of dopamine.\nAnd some of your podcast listeners may\nbe old enough to remember the crack\ncocaine epidemic or free base cocaine.\nAnd cocaine does have, like\nmethamphetamine, a very\nhigh addictive liability.\nI give lectures to students at Stanford\nabout neurobiology of addiction\nas part of a team taught course.\nI have kids who I had to deal with,\nand what I always say is, it's not\nthat if you use this drug, you're\nautomatically going to become an\naddict, but you're taking that risk.\nAnd it is impossible to become\naddicted to a substance if you've\nnever used it, by definition, but\nback to the root of administration.\nSo I went off--\nAndrew Huberman: --That's actually\nan interesting statement, because I\nthink we may have heard that in high\nschool, although I, to be honest,\nwasn't the most attentive high\nschool student, and I regret that\nhigh school students, pay attention!\nRobert Malenka: You did okay for yourself.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: Eventually I came\naround, but it was an uphill battle.\nBut that you can't become addicted to\nsomething that you've never done, which\nI just want to earmark that because\nI think it's a profound statement,\nbecause it points to the importance of\nthe memory system, but also plasticity.\nAnd so I want to make sure that\neventually we get around to talking\nabout how the amount of dopamine\nreleased and the kinetics, how\nthat might influence plasticity.\nRobert Malenka: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: What I'm asking here,\nqueuing up in the back of your mind,\nis whether or not addiction is just\nrelated to the sensation that we have\nwhen we indulge in a behavior, or\nwhen we are under the influence of a\ndrug, or whether or not it actually\nmodifies neural circuitry in a way\nthat makes a broader range of drugs\nor experiences attractive to us.\nRobert Malenka: It's\nprobably the latter, but.\nSo let me get back, and I will answer that\nin a second to the point I was making.\nSo it's not only the substance,\nit's the route of administration.\nAs I said, you can't develop a problem\nwith a substance and develop a substance\nabuse problem if you never take it.\nBut snorting cocaine is a\ndifferent experience than\nsmoking it or injecting it.\nAnd one of the reasons the crack cocaine\nepidemic was so powerful, is it gets into\nwhen you're smoking it or injecting it.\nAnd people do this now with\nmethamphetamine, I mean,\nmeth addicts, most of them.\nAnd that is another\nepidemic in our country.\nMost of them smoke it.\nAnd the danger of that is the drug,\nwhether it's cocaine, methamphetamine,\ngets into your brain almost\ninstantaneously, causes a very rapid,\npowerful surge of dopamine in the\naccumbens in this reward circuitry.\nAnd that the feeling you get, which,\nand we're going to get into this, is\nnot necessarily a happy feeling, and\nit can last for tens of seconds or a\nfew minutes, and it's a feeling that\ngives you this overwhelming compulsion\nand urge, I want to do it again.\nEven though it may not actually feel\nall that good, and again, this gets\ninto we didn't have an addiction problem\nfor any substance other than alcohol,\nfor most of humanity's existence,\nbecause these substances like cocaine,\nmethamphetamine, synthetic opioids\nlike fentanyl, they didn't exist.\nAnd the truth is, our brains\nare not designed to handle those\nkinds of very powerful substances.\nAndrew Huberman: As many of you know,\nI've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nAG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that's designed to meet all of\nyour foundational nutrition needs.\nNow, of course, I try to get enough\nservings of vitamins and minerals\nthrough whole food sources that include\nvegetables and fruits every day.\nBut oftentimes I simply\ncan't get enough servings.\nBut with AG1 , I'm sure to get\nenough vitamins and minerals\nand the probiotics that I need.\nAnd it also contains adaptogens\nto help buffer stress.\nSimply put, I always feel better\nwhen I take AG1 . I have more focus\nand energy and I sleep better.\nAnd it also happens to taste great.\nFor all these reasons, whenever\nI'm asked if you could take just\none supplement, what would it be?\nI answer AG1.\nIf you'd like to try AG1 , go\nto drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nplus a year's supply of Vitamin D3K2\nagain, that's drinkag1.com/huberman\n.\n Robert Malenka: So, where\ndo you want to go from here?\nYou asked a question about the neural\nmechanisms of what we call addiction.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I'd\nlike to know about the role of\nneuroplasticity and addiction.\nI do want to highlight something\nyou said, and I apologize for\ninterrupting a moment ago.\nAnd then I refrained, but it was an\ninterruption based on real excitement\nbecause a person I know quite well, who\nis a recovered cocaine addict, told me.\nAnd that, by the way, folks,\nthis isn't, I have a friend\nand I'm actually, you know...\nI truly have never tried cocaine.\nAnd this person said that the first time\nthey did cocaine, his thought was, I hate\nthis, and I can't wait to do it again.\nAnd that's exactly how you described it.\nRobert Malenka: And I think that is a\nfairly common experience with people\nsuffering from an addiction disorder.\nWe're not supposed to use the\nword addicts anymore because\nthat's a little bit judgmental.\nAndrew Huberman: That's\nthe new nomenclature.\nRobert Malenka: Something\nalong those lines.\nAndrew Huberman: Got it.\nCalling someone an addict as\nopposed to being addicted.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah, being.\nAnd that is a beautiful description.\nI hate it, but I want to\ndo it again and again.\nIt just shows the power of this system,\nwhich, remember, evolved for our survival.\nSo a very simple way of thinking\nabout it is these drugs are tricking\nthe reward circuitry to say, this\nstimulus, this experience, is\nreally important for my survival.\nI have to go do it again\nand again and again.\nA side question is, the huge question\nis, why do some people develop an\naddiction problem and others who\nhave used this substance just don't?\nAnd again, as a world class neuroscientist\nyourself, you know the answer.\nIt's always a complex combination of\nunderlying genetics, the environment\nin which they find themselves, the\nenvironment in which they grew up, and\nhow that modified their reward circuitry.\nSo, to get at your question, one set\nof experiments my lab did, which other\nlabs did, too, I don't deserve the sole\ncredit for this, is showing that drugs\nof abuse cause powerful plasticity\nin the neurons that make up the cells\nthat make up the reward circuitry.\nAnd in fact, drugs of abuse, like\ncocaine, methamphetamine, opioids like\nmorphine, heroin, change the synapses.\nThe synapses are the connections from\nother nerve cells onto dopamine neurons,\nonto the nerve cells and the accumbens.\nAnd these connections,\nthese synapses, can change.\nAnd drugs of abuse cause powerful\nchanges in those connections, and\ntherefore, powerful changes in the\nactivity of the dopamine neurons and\nthe neurons in the nucleus accumbens.\nAnd, in fact, the types of changes that\noccur appear to be similar to the types\nof changes that have evolved for good uses\nfor adaptive forms of learning and memory.\nSo, again, this is an example that\nthis superficially simple dopamine\nreward circuitry is changing all\nthe time, and it's highly plastic\nand can become more sensitive to\ncertain experiences, etc, etc.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, could\nI ask a question about some\nof the general contours of the\nplasticity and the dopamine system?\nYou said before, and I love this\nstatement, even though it's very\nsimple, but in its simplicity, it's\nreally elegant that we can't become\naddicted to a substance or a behavior\nthat we haven't taken or partaken in.\nSo is there data to support the idea\nthat just one exposure to cocaine or one\nexposure to some sort of behavior can\nlead to a lasting change in the dopamine\nsystem, such that one's propensity to be\naddicted to that substance again, if one\nwere to indulge in the future, or behavior\nagain in the future, is increased?\nAnd I have a very particular\nreason for asking this, but I'm\nvery curious what the answer is.\nRobert Malenka: I mean, in the work my lab\nand other labs have done in preclinical\nrodent models, the answer is yes.\nA single administration of a drug of\nabuse, like cocaine, like morphine, can\ncause relatively several days, several\nweeks of changes in the connections onto\ndopamine neurons and onto the neurons\nin the nucleus accumbens those changes.\nThat does not mean these changes\nare permanent or irreversible,\nbut the changes last a long time.\nAnd again, the big question for\nunderstanding the neurobiology\nof addiction is, those changes\nare probably happening in\nmost people who take the drug.\nIn this case, and we can talk about\nother stimuli, non drug stimuli\nthat can become \"addictive.\"\nAgain, why in certain individuals?\nTo be honest, it's not a big deal.\nYeah, I did cocaine at this party.\nIt was nice, but I don't feel any\ncraving or urge to do it again.\nWhereas other individuals, it\nsets them down a very bad path and\nreally badly affects their life.\nAnd that's a huge question in the\nresearch field, because obviously,\nif we could make predictions on which\nindividuals are more susceptible, and\nnot to get too political here, but\nwhether you become, develop a problem\nwith addiction, or not is influenced\nby the other parts of your life.\nDo you have other ways of getting,\nreinforcing stimuli, getting\nsatisfaction, having an outlet,\nthat other ways of activating\nyour reward or dopamine circuitry?\nHealthy ways, right?\nLike, as you have articulated, I think,\nin your podcast, getting exercise.\nYou and I both like to get exercise.\nI feel really good.\nSometimes it's painful during the\nexercise, but afterwards I feel great.\nAndrew Huberman: Almost the\ninverse of the cocaine response.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah, the desire.\nAndrew Huberman: And then I hate\nthis, but I can't wait to do it again.\nIt seems like exercise\nis often the opposite.\nI hate this, I don't want to do this.\nAnd then afterwards, gosh, I always feel\nbetter and I'd be happy to do it again.\nRobert Malenka: Yes, I like to\nexercise chasing a ball, because\nthat gets me off thinking about this\nhurts anyhow, back to addiction.\nSo, yes, these drugs can cause, I don't\nwant to, definitely not permanent,\nchanges from a single exposure.\nAnd the types of studies I'm talking about\nwere all done in experimental animals.\nSo how that relates to what happens\nin our brains, in human subjects\nbrains is not completely clear,\nbut I think there are parallels.\nSo the changes might last a few days, a\nweek or two, but one can see if somebody,\nthere have been studies done where, in\nan animal model, if you give repeated\nadministration of a drug like cocaine, the\nchanges get stronger and they last longer,\nwhich is kind of intuitively obvious.\nBut again, the big question is why,\nin human subjects, there are people\nwho can use these substances and not\ndevelop a serious problem, and there\nare others where they're very damaging.\nAnd then that's why I\nstill make the point.\nIf you're a young person, do\nyou want to take that risk?\nIs it worth it to have that experience?\nAnd that's an individual decision.\nAndrew Huberman: We've done some podcast\nepisodes about alcohol, cannabis, etc.\n, and there just seem to be a pretty wide\nvariation in people's response to the\ninformation, I think because there are\npeople out there who, well, I've got\nfriends who are recovered alcoholics\nwho will tell me the first drink\nthey took, they use language like it\ncombined with the chemistry of my body\nin a way that nothing before ever had.\nAnd they felt like it was\nlike this magic elixir, right?\nThat has not been my experience.\nRobert Malenka: I have heard the\nsame stories, and it's hard for me\nto relate, because, like you, alcohol\ndoes not have that effect on me.\nAnd it's hard to believe that kind\nof immediate response to alcohol\nis due to the environment in which\nthey grew up, although that can\nhave an influence that just feels\nalmost more genetically encoded.\nAnd there is evidence that issues with\nthe use of alcohol and developing alcohol\nuse disorder does run in families.\nAnd obviously, if it runs in family,\nyou have to worry about how the\nenvironment of that family influences it.\nBut there's a lot of studies saying\nthere is a genetic component.\nMaybe, like you, if I have a drink or\ntwo in the afternoon, I just fall asleep,\nand it does not have that effect on me.\nAnd anyone can imagine similar\nthings for other drugs of abuse.\nThere are people who have used\ncocaine, have used methamphetamine,\nwho find it modestly enjoyable, but\nit's not the be all or end all, isn't\nthis incredibly powerful experience.\nAnd you just talked about, I think, a\nfriend or a colleague who said, I hate it.\nI hate that, but I want to do it again.\nAnd that's fascinating.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nThey're now a recovered alcoholic and\ncocaine addict, and they've abstained\nfor many years, but still get a little\nbit of a gleam in their eye when\nthey talk about alcohol or cocaine\nin a way that I just can't relate to.\nRobert Malenka: Can I tell you\na little vignette about me?\nWhich I love to tell.\nAndrew Huberman: Sure.\nRobert Malenka: And it gets into how the\nreward circuitry is so closely associated\nwith memory systems and how cues associate\nit with powerful experiences, develop\ntheir own reinforcing or aversive quality.\nSo, long story short, when I was a\nyoung kid, I can't remember in my\n20s, maybe 20, I spent a few weeks in\nParis, I started smoking cigarettes.\nI mean, this is a long time ago,\nand cigarettes are very interesting.\nNicotine is highly addictive, as the\ntobacco companies were fully aware of.\nAndrew Huberman: High addictive liability.\nRobert Malenka: Very\nhigh addictive liability.\nAndrew Huberman: People will rob\npeople for the money to buy cigarettes.\nRobert Malenka: They may not rob\nbecause, although my understanding\nis they've become quite expensive,\nbut counterfeit cigarettes are a\nhuge market for organized crime.\nThere are parts in the world,\nthird World countries, where\norganized crime produce counterfeit\ncigarettes and are making hundreds\nof millions or billions of dollars.\nI think nicotine as it is delivered in\ncigarettes, as you know, I mean, tobacco\ncompanies put in a lot of work to figure\nout the exact dose of nicotine that\nwill make you get that kind of feeling\nthat only lasts for a few minutes,\nso you want to do it again and again.\nSo we can talk about nicotine.\nWhat becomes a problem in a specific\nsociety with addiction is not only\nbased on the neurobiological actions.\nIf we're talking still about drugs\nor substances of that substance,\nit's heavily influenced by the\navailability of the substance.\nBut my little story is, I\nsmoked some cigarettes in Paris.\nI learned why people like to smoke.\nIt was very satisfying to have\na cigarette in a Parisian cafe.\nAnd it's very interesting\nbecause the first few times you\ninhale tobacco, you get dizzy.\nIt's kind of aversive, and it's\nexactly what you articulated.\nDespite that, you want to do it again.\nSo it was just a lot of fun for me.\nI enjoyed it, and I was disciplined.\nAt some point, whenever this was,\nI came back to the United States.\nI didn't smoke because I\nknew it was bad for you.\nBut to this day, 40 years later, every\ntime I go back to Paris, I get cravings.\nI actually just want to\nget a pack of cigarettes.\nI want to have that feeling\nagain of inhaling the smoke.\nBut the point is of how powerful\nthese rewarding experiences can\nbe, or reinforcing experiences.\nAnd for your audience, technically, what I\nhave been taught by some of my psychology\ncolleagues is we use the term reinforcing\nin a very behaviorally defined way.\nSomething is reinforcing is if the\nbehavior that led to that stimuli, it\nmakes you want to do that behavior.\nAgain, rewarding means\nit actually felt \"good.\"\nAndrew Huberman: That's\nan important distinction.\nRobert Malenka: They\nactually can be different.\nAgain, as you defined by your friend who\nhis, I forget, I think it was cocaine.\nCocaine was highly reinforcing, but it was\nnot necessarily enjoyable or rewarding.\nAnd isn't that fascinating?\nI have some colleagues\nin the addiction field.\nOne of them is retired now, Kent\nBarridge and Terry Robinson.\nThey distinguish between the\nterms wanting and liking.\nAnd think about that.\nLiking something means it's\nsomething you like, you enjoy.\nWanting means you want it, but you\ndon't necessarily like it or enjoy it.\nAnd that's a description of your\nfriend's experience with cocaine.\nSome of us have been in destructive\nrelationships where you want that\nindividual, but you're not sure you\nnecessarily like that individual.\nAndrew Huberman: Sometimes people\nwill be in relationships where they\nactively dislike the other person,\nwhich is a bit foreign of a concept\nto me, but, well, it's interesting.\nThis separation of reinforcing\nand rewarding wanting and liking,\nbecause one of the things that's\nvery prominent in twelve step\nprograms is to create rewards around\nabstaining from the drug or behavior.\nAnd I should mention that programs\nlike twelve step, when followed,\nseem to have very high success rates.\nAt least that's what Ana Lemke\ntells me, that in some ways they are\nmodifying the wanting and liking.\nThey're splitting the wanting and liking\nof alcohol, for instance, creating\na liking of sobriety more than the\nwanting of alcohol, for instance.\nRobert Malenka: That's beautifully put.\nAnd I think that's right.\nHow that plays out in the\nneural mechanisms that, as a\nneuroscientist, I'm interested.\nMan, that's a tough one,\nbut I think that's why those\nprograms are pretty successful.\nIt's helping the person\nmake those dissociations.\nAnd I don't know that much about\nthose programs because I have\nnot seen patients myself for\nwhatever it's been, 27, 28 years.\nBut I think part of them are to\nhelp that individual find, both\nother sources of liking and reward,\ngetting some satisfaction and reward\nfrom the actual abstinence, being\nable to cognitively teach themselves\nthat I deserve a pat on the back.\nI deserve credit.\nI feel good that I did not take\na drink at that party that I did\nnot use that substance again.\nAnd how that plays out in our\nbrains is a really tough one.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, the way\nyou described it is exactly right.\nThose programs are highly reinforcing for\nabstinence behaviors, everything from the\nsocial connection, which we're going to\nget to social connection, as you know, to\nthe way that people start to conceptualize\ntheir addict self versus other self.\nIt actually involves a splitting\nof the self in interesting ways.\nAs long as we're talking about\ndonuts, cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine.\nI'm curious, before we move to a bit\nmore on neuroplasticity, is there\nanything that people ought to know about\nhow different substances and behaviors\nthat are addicting might impact the\ndopamine reward circuitry differently?\nSo, for instance, we talked about\ncocaine as having this very rapid\nonset, big increase in dopamine, then\na crash, as we know, a certain pattern\nof kinetics, as you describe it, the\nopioid crisis is incredibly serious\nproblem right now, as is methamphetamine.\nBut it sounds like methamphetamine\nfunctions a bit like cocaine.\nAnd in terms of its kinetics, yes.\nSo an opioid is a very different\nchemical than cocaine, but it sounds\nlike it impacts the dopamine system.\nIs the dopaminergic activity caused\nby opioids responsible for the\naddictive properties of opioids?\nOr do people also like the\nfeeling of being under opioids?\nI personally hate it\ncoming out of surgery.\nLike, they gave me Vicodin\nonce and I hated it.\nI'd rather have the pain, the\npostoperative pain, than take\nsomething like Vicodin or a Valium\nor fentanyl or anything like that,\nto me, is just completely aversive.\nBut I realize that there are many millions\nof people that feel quite differently.\nRobert Malenka: It's a great question.\nSo I think all the studies, both in human\nbeings and preclinical animal models, yes,\nwould suggest that the addictive liability\nof opioids and psychostimulants, which\nare cocaine and methamphetamine, have the\ncommon final action of causing massive\nrelease of dopamine in this target of the\ndopamine neurons, the nucleus accumbens.\nThey do it, if we want to get a\nlittle scientifically technical\nhere, via very different mechanisms.\nSo cocaine and methamphetamine, what\nthe drugs known as psychostimulants,\nactually bind to a protein in the\nbrain, or a molecule in the brain\nthat is responsible for sucking up.\nIt's a vacuum cleaner sucking up the\ndopamine after it's been released.\nAnd cocaine prevents that\ndopamine from being vacuumed up.\nSo the cocaine hangs around longer.\nMeth not only prevents the\ndopamine from being vacuumed up,\nit actually causes the reverse.\nIt actually causes the direct\nrelease of dopamine from what we\ncall nerve terminals, from the\nsite where dopamine is released.\nOpioids work very differently.\nThey actually primarily, not solely\nwork where the dopamine neurons live.\nAnd it's a little complicated,\nit's not that critical, but they\nindirectly increase the activity\nwithin the dopamine neurons themselves,\ncausing a big, massive, bigger\nthan normal release of dopamine.\nSo that's one commonality.\nBut anybody who has used these\ndrugs or read about these drugs,\nthe subjective experience of the\ndrugs are dramatically different,\nand that's because of the actions\nthey're having, not only in the reward\ncircuitry, but throughout the brain.\nAnd it's interesting,\nyou talked about Vicodin.\nI've taken Vicodin because I've had\nseveral knee surgeries and things.\nLike you, I didn't like it.\nI've gotten other opioids for\npain relief that were great.\nI mean, they took away a lot of\npain after my ligament repair.\nAnd that's a different question, that\neven when you're talking about opioids,\nall drugs, they're not identical.\nFentanyl has a much big, larger addictive\nliability because of its molecular\nproperties and how it's interacting\nwith the opioid system in our brains\nand the receptors, the actual proteins\nin the brain that it interacts with.\nBut the subjective experience\nof opioids, it's interesting.\nSome people love it.\nIf we go back in history, as you know,\nthere were the opium dens throughout Asia.\nThere were wars about opioids, the\nfamous opioid wars between China\nand the United Kingdom, showing you\nhow powerful the availability of\na substance like an opioid can be.\nSo I'm going off on a tangent.\nAndrew Huberman: No, I\nthink these are important.\nRobert Malenka: But commonality is\ndopamine release in the, if you remember\nwhat a ven diagram is, these drugs have\nsome common actions, usually on, directly\nor indirectly, causing the massive\nrelease of dopamine in the accumbens.\nBut then they have their own\nindividual actions, because\nobviously, when you take cocaine or\nmethamphetamine, it's a stimulator.\nPeople are grinding their\nteeth, they're hyped up.\nFor most people, opioids are the\nexact opposite in opium dens.\nFrom the movies I watched and\nwatching narcos and all those TV\nshows, you're lying down, you're\nkind of in almost a dreamlike state.\nSo very different subjective experiences.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd like to just\ntake a brief break and thank one\nof our sponsors, which is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you don't.\nThat means plenty of salt, sodium,\nmagnesium and potassium, the so\ncalled electrolytes, and no sugar.\nNow, salt, magnesium and potassium\nare critical to the function of\nall the cells in your body, in\nparticular to the function of your\nnerve cells, also called neurons.\nAnd we now know that even\nslight reductions in electrolyte\nconcentrations or dehydration of\nthe body can lead to deficits in\ncognitive and physical performance.\nLMNT contains a science backed\nelectrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams.\nThat's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of\npotassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.\nI typically drink LMNT first thing\nin the morning when I wake up in\norder to hydrate my body and make\nsure I have enough electrolytes.\nAnd while I do any kind of physical\ntraining and after physical training\nas well, especially if I've been\nsweating a lot, and certainly I drink\nLMNT in my water when I'm in the sauna\nand after going in the sauna because\nthat causes quite a lot of sweating.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT , you can go\nto drinklmnt.com/huberman to claim a free\nelement sample pack with your purchase.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman.\nYeah, I had an experience with an\nopioid recently, not voluntarily.\nOver the Christmas holiday, we went\nto visit friends, and before going to\nsleep, I wanted some tea, and I asked\nif they had any non-caffeinated tea.\nSo they gave me this tea.\nAnd that night I had the most\nbizarre dreams I've ever had.\nAnd I slept for 14 hours.\nThe next morning, I was\nlike, what was that tea?\nAnd I felt off in the morning.\nAnd it was actually a blue lotus flower\ntea that is actually illegal in the\nUnited States, but it is sold and it\nhas morphine like compounds in it.\nAnd I am one of those people\nthat's very susceptible to even low\ndoses of any kind of novel drug.\nRobert Malenka: Interesting.\nHave you ever taken cough\nsyrup with dextromethorphan?\nAndrew Huberman: No, I avoid that stuff.\nRobert Malenka: Well, I have a tendency\nwhen I get a cold, it gets into my lungs.\nI cough a lot.\nAnd I think this has been reported.\nThis is my anecdotal experience.\nI'm confirming what you said.\nDextromethorphan is a\ndifferent sort of opioid.\nAnd actually, some people develop\na problem with it, for me, it\ngives me really bizarre dreams.\nReally similar to what\nyou were describing.\nAndrew Huberman: It was very unusual.\nRobert Malenka: And that's a whole\ndifferent conversation about what makes us\ndream and what are the meaning of dreams.\nFascinating.\nI hope you covered.\nMaybe you've covered that.\nAndrew Huberman: We have.\nNot yet, but we are intending to do\na whole series on sleep and dreaming,\nand we'll definitely get into it.\nRobert Malenka: I started out in sleep\nresearch, so I have a fondness for it.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, drug research\nand sleep research have a long history\nof overlap with Alan Hobson's work on--\nRobert Malenka: --I\nworked with Alan Hobson.\nAndrew Huberman: Okay, by the way,\nfolks, if you're interested in the\nrelationship between hallucinations\nand dreaming, Alan Hobson is a good\nname to start your rabbit hole.\nRobert Malenka: Oh, my God.\nI'm dating myself.\nI can't remember if it was\n'76 or '77, I worked with Alan\nHobson as an u ndergraduate--\n-- At Harvard Medical School--\n--No, as an undergraduate at Harvard.\nHe was at Harvard Medical School.\nYeah.\nAndrew Huberman: Amazing.\nI love his writing, and\nI learned a lot from it.\nHe was really ahead of his time.\nRobert Malenka: Yes, he was.\nAnybody who knows me won't believe\nthis, but back then, I was a\nvery shy, insecure 20 year old--\nAndrew Huberman: --I\nwould not have guessed--\nRobert Malenka: --who, even in\nmedical school, I literally was not\nconfident of my opinions at all.\nI was very shy, thought all of the\nideas I had must be obvious that\nI should never say them out loud.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you mind if\nI ask, since you raised this,\nI think it's really important.\nI mean, you have this\nincredible career track record.\nYou're adored by your colleagues,\nyou're highly respected, you've\nwon just about every award there\nis to winning neuroscience.\nSo was there something in particular\nthat, was it an overnight thing where\none day you woke up and thought,\nI actually believe in myself?\nBut if you wouldn't mind sharing\nthat, because I think before we\nget back into some of the science.\nScience is a human endeavor, and\nmost people listening are probably\nnot scientists, but I think\neverybody deals with these issues\nof self-doubt, and people appear to\nhave varying levels of confidence.\nBut what happened?\nRobert Malenka: Thank you for asking.\nFor me, it was a very gradual process.\nAnd as an undergraduate, as a medical\nstudent, even as a postdoc, yeah, I\nwas very unsure of my ideas, of my\nintellectual abilities, of whether what\nI was thinking was really worthwhile.\nSo it was a very gradual process, I think.\nThe increase in my confidence, I\nthink, began when I was a postdoc,\nwhich is a training period after\nyou've received a PhD or an MD, where\nyou get additional research training.\nAnd I worked with a guy named\nRoger Nicoll at UCSF, and\nRoger was a very intellectually\nintense, very forceful individual.\nAnd I got involved in a field where, I\nmean, people, a little bit of a tangent,\nyour listeners may think that scientists\nare these geeky individuals wearing white\ncoats with no passion or emotion, and\nnothing could be further from the truth.\nThe most successful scientists I know\nare pretty passionate and pretty intense\nabout what they're working on and driven.\nAnd this is a gross generalization.\nSo, anyhow, during my postdoc, I\nstarted getting involved in a topic\nwhere there were vigorous arguments\nabout phenomenology we were studying.\nSo I had to develop a\ntougher and thicker skin.\nI had to be able to argue my side of\nthe hypotheses we were generating.\nSo it started developing as a\npostdoc, and then it slowly evolved.\nAs an assistant professor, and for your\nlisteners who don't know, I don't like to\nadmit this, but I'm in my late sixties.\nI have been running my own\nlab for almost 40 years.\nSo gradually, as an assistant professor,\nI realized, hey, I can do this.\nI can do science.\nI can write papers that my\ncolleagues seem to be interested in.\nAnd then gradually, over then\nthe next 10, 20, 30 years, I\ngained more and more confidence.\nSo for me, it was this very gradual build\nup of many different experiences where\nI developed some confidence that not all\nof my ideas are great, of course they're\nnot, but it's okay to voice my opinion.\nIt's okay to state my ideas and why I\nbelieve this and why I don't believe that.\nSo that was my experience.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you for\nsharing that, because I think people\nstruggle with that very issue.\nAnd clearly, showing up again and again\nover a long period of time is helpful.\nBut as you said, learning to trust\none's ideas, just a brief anecdote\nwhen I was coming up in neuroscience,\na few years behind you, 20 years\nbehind me, not too many decades.\nBut I recall the incredible number of high\nprofile papers on neuroplasticity and long\nterm potentiation, long term depression.\nThese are terms related to the\nmodification of synapses that Rob\nMalenka and Roger Nicoll pioneered.\nA big segment of that work.\nAnd I remember seeing your\nnames on papers, and I\nthought Roger worked for you.\nSorry, Roger.\n[LAUGHS]\nRobert Malenka: I love to hear that.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: I was under the\nimpression he worked for you.\nAnd only later did I learn\nthat you were his postdoc.\nRobert Malenka: And then\nwe collaborated as equals.\nAndrew Huberman: You\nbecame peers very quickly.\nRobert Malenka: Very quickly.\nAndrew Huberman: Roger's wonderful.\nRobert Malenka: I did have the\nconfidence, even as a postdoc, actually,\neven as a grad student, even though I\nwas a little insecure about my ideas.\nI wanted to be treated as an equal.\nThat's the one thing I did have.\nI never felt that I was\nworking for somebody else.\nI always felt that I was working for\nmyself and that we were colleagues,\neven though my mentors had more\nexperience and I could learn from them.\nAndrew Huberman: I like that\nyou're working for yourself\neven though you have mentors.\nI think there's some real gems\nin what you just described.\nSo thank you for taking\nthe time to do that.\nRobert Malenka: Sure.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd like to discuss\none aspect of reward circuitry that I\ndon't think most people think about.\nIt's fairly straightforward nowadays.\nI like to think more people know what\ndopamine is and understand it, thanks\nto your work and Anna's work and some\ndiscussions that have taken place\non our podcast and other podcasts.\nBut all too often we think dopamine,\nreward, wanting, liking drugs.\nOkay, all of that is great, but what\nabout the truly adaptive stuff, right?\nBecause it's easy to fall into\na discussion around dopamine of\nthe things that are bad for us.\nBut what I'm thinking about\nhere is social interaction.\nClearly, we are a social species, and\na lot of your work in the last decade\nand a half or so has focused on the\nrelationship between the reward circuitry,\nwhich you beautifully described for us,\nand social interaction and connection.\nAnd where I'm going with this is\nultimately, this has huge implications\nfor autism and autism spectrum disorders.\nI don't know if, nowadays, is it okay?\nYou're not supposed to call\nautism a disease, is that right?\nYou hear about neurotypical and neuro\natypical, but I have friends who have\nchildren who are severely autistic.\nAnd I don't know many parents who would\nelect to have a severely autistic kid.\nAnd so those people often will talk about\nit as autism or a child having autism.\nSo first of all, before we get into\nthe social piece, maybe because I\njust tabled it, how are we supposed\nto talk about autism nowadays?\nRobert Malenka: I am very interested in\nthe pathophysiology of what the medical\nprofession terms autism spectrum disorder.\nAs you pointed out, individuals living\nwith an autism spectrum disorder\nare quite heterogeneous, and it can\nrange from individuals with severe\nintellectual impairment and quite severe\nimpairments in social interactions,\nimpairments in sensory processing,\nimpairments in lots of different aspects\nof our behaviors that are important.\nAnd I think nobody would say, would argue,\nthose individuals on the severe spectrum\ndo not have some sort of \"disorder.\"\nThe issue we have to be sensitive\nto is it's a heterogeneous disorder.\nLike many brain issues that psychiatrists\ndeal with, like depression, like\nobsessive compulsive disorder, like\nvarious anxiety disorders, it's\nalways on a continuum and a spectrum.\nSo for autism spectrum disorder, there\nare individuals who are high functioning\nwho, one could argue, have a different\nstyle of interacting socially, may have\na different way of processing sensory\ninformation, but who would prefer not\nto be viewed as having an illness,\nbut rather would be viewed as having a\ndifferent style of living and interaction.\nAnd I think we need to respect that.\nSo the challenge is, again, not\noversimplifying a complex heterogeneous\ndisorder and both being respectful\nof the people who don't want to be\ndefined as having a neuropsychiatric\nor brain disorder, while equally being\nrespectful of people like your friends\nwith severely impaired children who\ndeserve help, who deserve research.\nAnd it's a tough one, because my\nunderstanding from, to be honest, just\nreading articles in the lay press and\ngoing to websites from organizations that\nphilanthropically support research related\nto autism, within that community of\nindividuals who are not researchers, but\nwho have family members or are themselves\ndealing with some degree of autism\nspectrum disorder, there's disagreements\nabout what terminology to use, how to\ndeal with them, and it's complicated.\nI think we just have to respect everybody.\nAnd if you're interacting with\nindividuals, I think it's appropriate.\nWhat do you prefer?\nI do know as a medical professional,\nand especially when you're dealing\nwith children, there are children\nwho need help and we're not doing\nthem a service by saying they don't\nhave an issue that we should be\nhelping them with and working on.\nSo I hope that answers\nyour question beautifully.\nAndrew Huberman: I think it beautifully\nanswers it and encompasses all\nsides so that we can move forward.\nSo as we use the term autism or\nchildren or people with autism,\nthat's what we're referring to.\nRobert Malenka: I think people are very\nsensitive, especially those individuals\nwho are neuro atypical, who previously\nmight be diagnosed as autism spectrum\ndisorder, but would prefer to not be\nlabeled as having a brain illness.\nThat's fine.\nOnce you are an adult, you can\nmake that decision for yourself.\nAndrew Huberman: We certainly have\ncolleagues at Stanford and elsewhere who,\nat least by my non clinical assessment,\nseem to fall somewhere on that spectrum.\nRobert Malenka: And\nagain, it's a continuum.\nJust as the experience of\ndepression is a continuum.\nAndrew Huberman: As with depression, you\nwouldn't love a child or an adult any\nless because they have depression, nor\nwould you love a child or an adult any\nless because of expression of some autism.\nRobert Malenka: I know the point, we are\nbeing trained in the medical profession\nto be very, and our society is going\nthis way too, very careful with the terms\nwe use and the labeling of individuals.\nSo I've been taught you can\nsay individuals living with\nan autism spectrum disorder.\nSome people don't like using\nthe term, oh, that individual is\nautistic, because that can have\nsome, I don't want to say derogatory\nmeaning, but some labeling kind of.\nBut sometimes this gets out of\ncontrol, too, as we both know.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, for sake of\nfluid conversation, we will do our\nbest, but we will acknowledge from the\noutset that we are well meaning but far\nfrom perfect in how we'll handle this.\nRobert Malenka: Well put.\nWell put.\nAndrew Huberman: So, in thinking about\nsocial interactions and leaving aside\nanything related to autism, for the\nmoment, it appears that the circuits in\nthe brain that mediate the desire to spend\ntime with others of the same species,\nmaybe even with other species like a\ndog, are fairly hardwired but modifiable.\nWe were born with the capacity\nto build them up and that social\nbehavior is highly rewarded.\nIs it rewarded through\nthe dopamine system?\nAnd what, if any, involvement is\nthere of the serotonergic system?\nAnd we haven't talked about\nserotonin yet, but I'd love to\nbring up serotonin at this point.\nMaybe you could educate us a little\nbit about serotonin, because,\ngosh, if dopamine is fascinating,\nserotonin is at least as incredible.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah, great question.\nSo I think for me, the easiest way\nfor me to answer it is, actually\njust tell you, my research history\nand how a lab like mine at Stanford\nthat at one point was studying what\nyou and I would call fairly hardcore\nmolecular mechanisms of neuroplasticity.\nHow do connections between nerve cells\nchange and what molecules are changing?\nAnd pretty hardcore molecular stuff.\nHow did I end up studying\nsocial behaviors in mice?\nAnd what I hope we'll end up talking\nabout, even developing behavioral models\nof what I will define as empathy in mice.\nThe answer is very simple.\nMy lab was working on roles of classic\ndopamine reward circuitry and how\nit changes in models of addiction.\nWe haven't talked about depression\nmodels of depression, because just\nintuitively, hopefully, your listeners\ncan understand if one component of\ndepression is what we call anhedonia,\nthe inability to experience reward.\nEating a donut is no longer satisfying.\nHaving sex is no longer that much fun,\nwhich is a component of depression.\nIf there's a mechanism in the brain\nthat tells you something is rewarding,\nby definition, that's not functioning\nnormally in severe depression.\nSo we were doing models of\ndepression to figure out how the\ndopamine reward circuitry was\nchanging, as were many other labs.\nWe were studying addiction.\nThose were the obvious ones.\nAnd, I mean, it might be entertaining\nto your audience to learn how\nacademic scientists think.\nI was thinking, those\nare fascinating topics.\nThey're pretty competitive.\nLots of other labs were working on it.\nAnd I started thinking what\nother experiences might be\nmodifying the reward circuitry.\nI actually made some attempts to look at\nfeeding behavior, but we actually never\npursued that for a variety of reasons.\nAnd that's obviously important\nbecause there is an obesity\nepidemic in this country.\nAnd we can talk about how the reward\ncircuitry and some of the things we've\nlearned from our studies of addiction\nmay be helpful to understanding obesity.\nBut back to social interaction.\nI started thinking, well, for most\nof us, what I call a pro social, non\nsexual experience is highly reinforcing.\nAndrew, you're a pretty social guy.\nI'm a pretty social guy.\nMost of the time, I'd rather\ngo to a movie, a sporting\nevent, a dinner with friends.\nActually, for me, the most meaningful\ncomponent of my life, other than\nspending time with my children, is\nspending time with my close friends.\nAnd I started thinking, well, why is that?\nWhy do I have such a good time\ngoing to a ball game with my best\nfriend or going out to dinner with\nanother couple and interacting?\nIt's because, well,\nit's highly reinforcing.\nAnd if it's highly reinforcing, it\nmust involve the reward circuitry.\nAnd then I started thinking,\nevolutionarily, it makes a lot of\nsense, because if you are part of\na social species, there's a lot of\nadvantages for your survival to be\nhanging out with other members of\nyour species in a non aggressive way.\nIt can increase your likelihood\nto find a mate and reproduce.\nIt can protect you from predators.\nI mean, that's why any of your listeners\nwho ever watch wildlife shows or National\nGeographic shows, there's a reason\nall these animals hang out together.\nIt's for protection from predators.\nSo there are all these reasons.\nSo, about, whenever it was, 13 or 14 years\nago, my lab decided to start looking at\nhow the reward circuitry may play a role\nin what I am going to call positive,\npro social, nonaggressive interactions.\nAnother word we use is just sociability.\nAnd for a variety of reasons back\nthen, this is at least 13 years\nago, maybe 15 years ago, a postdoc\njoined my lab named Gul Dolen.\nShe's now a professor at Johns Hopkins,\nand she had an interest in oxytocin.\nAnd as your listeners know, oxytocin\nis this evolutionarily conserved\nneuropeptide that's very important\nfor parturition, having a baby\nborn for milk being produced.\nAnd it's gotten a lot of attention\nas a potential love neuropeptide, as\nsomething that is released in our brains\nduring a positive social interaction.\nThere's a well known researcher in\nsocial behavior and bonding research\ncalled Larry Young, and he did some\nvery important, now somewhat classic\nwork studying a species called the\nvole, in particular, the prairie vole.\nAnd prairie voles are a species\nwhere they mate for life.\nIt's called pair bonding.\nSo one vole will find another vole.\nThey basically get married, they\nhave kids, and they hang out\ntogether for the rest of their life.\nNo divorce, no 50% divorce rate.\nAnd what Larry elegantly showed in\nearly days, in collaboration with a\nguy named Tom Insel, who is a famous\nacademic psychiatrist, they showed\nthat oxytocin action within the nucleus\naccumbens, within this reward circuitry,\nwas required and really important\nfor this monogamous pair bonding.\nHaving said that, there was just a\npaper that called that into question.\nAndrew Huberman: But there's 30\nyears of research prior to that.\nI'm glad you brought that up,\nbecause we'll keep this contemporary.\nAnd the reality is that that recent\npaper got a lot of attention.\nRobert Malenka: You know\nthe paper I'm talking about.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nThat maybe oxytocin isn't\nplaying as prominent role in pair\nbonding as people had thought.\nAnd yet, folks, that could be true.\nWe have to be scientific\nabout this and be open minded.\nBut there's three decades of\nwork that speaks to the contrary.\nSo I think we want to weigh the evidence.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah, exactly.\nAnd again, the investigators\nwho presented the work saying\noxytocin may not be as important.\nThere are limitations to the manipulations\nthey did, which they would agree with.\nSo I'm just telling you.\nSo, Gul Dolen was a postdoc in my\nlab, and we formulated a project\nto look at the actions of oxytocin\nin the nucleus accumbens in mice.\nAnd the reason we study mice\nis they're what are known as\ngenetically tractable organisms.\nWe have all sorts of really cool\nand sophisticated tricks we can\ndo to probe brain circuitry.\nThe actions of neuromodulators like\ndopamine and serotonin and oxytocin in\nways that we can't do in other species.\nAnd I'm going to get back\nto dopamine in a second.\nAnd what we found was that oxytocin\naction in the nucleus accumbens was indeed\nimportant for promoting sociability,\nprobably for promoting the reinforcing\ncomponent of a social interaction.\nAnd that surprised us.\nIt was like, wow, oxytocin seems to\nbe causing, enhancing the release of\nserotonin in the nucleus accumbens,\nand that perhaps we'll get to this.\nThat led me off on a whole\nseries of experiments trying to\nfigure out how serotonin works.\nStudying this drug we may talk\nabout called MDMA, which is\nEcstasy, or Molly, which actually\ncauses release of serotonin.\nSo we did that work, and that got us\nworking in serotonin simultaneously.\nThere were some other papers reporting\nthat dopamine release in the accumbens.\nThat dopamine is released in the accumbens\nduring a social interaction, a positive,\nnon aggressive social interaction.\nTruth be told, it may also be released\nduring an aggressive interaction.\nAndrew Huberman: Some\npeople like to fight.\nRobert Malenka: Some people like to fight.\nAnd the difference here is\nthe dopamine release and its\nrole in social interactions.\nIt's not specific only for a social\ninteraction, as we have talked about,\nbut nevertheless, that led my lab and\nother labs to do a series of papers.\nI'm talking about the field now\nshowing that, and I'm giving\nyou a lot of information here.\nSo how might dopamine release happen\nduring a nonaggressive social interaction?\nIt turns out that oxytocin is\nnot only released in the nucleus\naccumbens, it's released in the home\nof the dopamine neurons in the VTA.\nSo, my lab and another lab from\nNorthwestern showed that oxytocin\ncan actually modulate dopamine neuron\nactivity in the ventral tegmental area.\nSo I hope I'm making sense here.\nI don't want to get too technical.\nAndrew Huberman: No, I think--\nRobert Malenka: --But it just\nshows how we discuss these\nneuromodulators like dopamine.\nI just brought in oxytocin.\nWe're going to talk about\nserotonin in a second.\nUnfortunately for your listeners,\nthey don't work in isolation.\nThey influence each other in ways\nthat I think it's important for\nus to understand and elucidate.\nAndrew Huberman: That is not\ntoo much technical detail, and\nI think it's wonderfully rich\nwith areas for us to discuss.\nAnd I'm so very glad that you brought\nup that neither dopamine or serotonin\nor oxytocin work in isolation,\nbecause all too often, and admittedly,\nsometimes even on my podcast, I'll talk\nabout these things in isolation as a\nway to try and simplify them a bit.\nBut there's just no way that\nthe brain works that way.\nFor instance, turning on dopamine and\nturning off serotonin, it's a weighting\nof inputs, and I think that serotonin,\nperhaps I should frame it this way.\nJust as often as dopamine is framed, as\nthis reward molecule and pleasure and\ndopamine hits, all too often, I think,\nin the popular press, serotonin is\ndiscussed, and oxytocin two, for that\nmatter, as this kind of warm, feel good,\neverything's mellow, not really associated\nwith a reward and reinforcement.\nAnd of course, it's not that simple.\nSo when it comes to social\ninteractions, it sounds like\noxytocin and serotonin are playing a\nprominent role also in the accumbens.\nAnd that dopamine is activated, too.\nDo I have that right?\nOkay, so I don't want to take us too\nfar down the rabbit hole of neural\ncircuit function, but that, to me, makes\nat least a brief discussion about the\nnucleus accumbens itself interesting.\nLike, okay, so I'm thinking\nnucleus, I know that means a pile of\nneurons, an aggregation of neurons.\nIt's talking to this ventral striatum.\nSo we got a bunch of--\nRobert Malenka: --Part o f the ventral\nstriatum, part of the subdivision.\nAndrew Huberman: Excuse me, I misspoke.\nYeah, it's part of the ventral striatum.\nAnd the neurons there can be\nactive and communicate with other\nbrain areas, but we're talking\nabout a lot of nuance of function.\nRobert Malenka: Oh, man, I'm smiling.\nI don't know if your audience can see\nme smiling, because I sometimes go\nto bed feeling it's so complicated.\nOh, my God, it is.\nAndrew Huberman: And yet, could\nwe say that within the nucleus\naccumbens, there are neurons that are\nacting as accelerators and brakes?\nIs there a simple analogy that perhaps,\nwhile not exhaustive, can still be true?\nBecause that's always\nthe goal on this podcast.\nSure, there's no way we can be exhaustive,\nbut we want to be as accurate as possible.\nRobert Malenka: So, a very influential\nhypothesis, which has guided my thinking.\nAnd again, the trick, you have done a\nwonderful job of communicating complex\nscientific topics to your podcast\naudience, and I congratulate you on\nthat, and it's a really important role.\nBut as you know, it's always more\ncomplicated than we want it to be as\nscientists, especially when you're dealing\nwith brain activity issues and how the\nbrain mediates all its amazing functions.\nSo, historically, we have thought about\nthe nucleus accumbens and other components\nof this ventral striatal brain area as\nprimarily being composed of two different\ncell types, and as you pointed out, one\nbeing sort of an accelerator, something\nthat promotes certain behaviors, and\nthe other cell type somewhat being a\nbreak saying, don't do that behavior,\ndon't perform that motor action.\nAnd it is true that there are\nthese different cell types.\nIt is true that they are modulated\nby these modulators like dopamine\nand serotonin in different ways.\nAnd that simplistic hypothesis, or\nheuristic we call it, has been very\nuseful in making models about how the\naccumbens does all its wonderful things.\nWhat I'm leading up to is, unfortunately,\nit's a little more complicated.\nBut yes, there are two\ndifferent cell types.\nAnd at least for your audience, we\ncan think about dopamine driving the\nactivity of one, promoting certain\nbehaviors and inhibiting the activity\nof the other cell type, and being a\nsort of break on certain behaviors.\nAs long as you and I, as scientists\nappreciate, it's not quite that simple.\nIt's a little more complicated.\nAndrew Huberman: So using that as a\nframework to think about social behavior,\nas you said, pro social, non aggressive,\nnon sexual interactions involve the\nchoice of a lot of behaviors, but also\nthe suppression of a lot of behaviors.\nMaybe you're starting to\nsense what I'm doing here.\nI think for people to understand how a\nsingle structure like the accumbens could\nmediate social interaction and reward\nit, what it sounds like it's doing is\nrewarding a certain category and catalog\nof behavioral options and punishing, or\nat least reducing the probability of the\noccurrence of other behavioral actions.\nBecause when I go to dinner\nwith friends, if I know them\nreally well, I might hug them.\nI might even say something\nmildly inappropriate if I know\nthe context to be safe, right?\nBut at a dinner interview or a discussion\nwith somebody I barely know, I might watch\nmy words a little bit more, for instance.\nRobert Malenka: And I think the\naccumbens and its associated circuit,\nI love the way you just put that...\nProbabilities.\nIt's my probability of\nhaving this behavior in a\ncertain context is increased.\nThe probabilities of not\ndoing certain behaviors.\nAnd I think there's little doubt that this\nbrain area called the nucleus accumbens\nand all of its associated circuitry play\na very important role in what behaviors\nyou choose to do, pursue, play a very\nimportant role in these, making the\ndecision and performing these pro social,\nnon aggressive, non sexual interactions.\nI actually also think it\nplays a role in empathy.\nI'm leading you there.\nI want to have a discussion about that--\nAndrew Huberman: --Please--\nRobert Malenka: --Again, as a\nmechanistically driven neuroscientist,\nwhat is frustrating for me is I know a\nlot of the connections it's making and the\nother brain areas it's communicating with.\nBut I can't give you a coherent hypothesis\nor diagram of how it all happens.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: You're still going.\n[LAUGHS]\nRobert Malenka: What I can say is, even\nat our current level of understanding,\nit is leading to novel hypotheses that\nare allowing the development, perhaps\nif we bring it back to autism, that are\nallowing the development of novel at\nthe moment, pharmacologic therapeutics\nthat might be helpful for people\nwho are not having normal pro social\ninteractions and would like to have\nthem, would like to be able to function\nin that domain in a more adaptive\nand productive and meaningful way.\nAnd that's the importance, in my\nview, of the kind of mechanistic\nwork my lab and many other labs\naround the country are doing.\nEven if we don't have a detailed\nunderstanding of how it's all\nhappening, we can identify drugs and\ndruggable targets, or even behavioral\ninterventions that might actually\nhelp people, for example, suffering\nfrom autism spectrum disorder of the\nsort that they actually want and need\ninteraction, need therapeutic help.\nAndrew Huberman: I think looking\nat the social connection circuitry\nthrough the lens of autism is going\nto be very interesting for us to do.\nI do have a question about what is\nbeing selected for in rewarding social\ninteractions, because obviously we are\nliving in a time where we don't have\nto aggregate in groups, necessarily\nto protect ourselves physically.\nIt helps in certain ways in certain\ncircumstances, but certainly to support\nourselves and each other emotionally.\nHaving people that we can call on\nwhen we're not feeling so well,\nthat we can look to for resources\nand that they can look to us.\nBut when we go out to dinner with\nfriends, or we go to a ball game with\nfriends, or we interact with friends,\nI'm very familiar with the feeling\nof like, well, that felt really good.\nIt just felt good.\nIt gives me energy.\nIt actually gives me energy to go\nback and do other things, like spend\nfour days alone with a bunch of\npapers and lectures, preparing for a\npodcast, which I also really enjoy.\nBut when I do that, when I go\nout to dinner with friends or see\nfriends, I'm not thinking about\nbuffering myself against loneliness.\nWhen I do it, I just like the interaction.\nSo what sorts of evolutionary\nhypotheses can we come up with as\nto why the human brain is so tuned\nfor these social interactions?\nWhy it's rewarded by not just one,\ndopamine, but also serotonin and oxytocin?\nThree prominent neuromodulatory chemicals\nin the brain are devoted at one site in\nthe brain and others that it's connected\nto, of course, but to making sure\nthat we do this as often as possible\nwithout giving up the rest of our lives.\nRobert Malenka: Well, again, I think\nthe answer I'm going to be able to give,\nI hope, it's not right, and it may be\na little bit obvious, is in some ways\nit's analogous to why drugs of abuse\nand addiction are also a problem, is\nthat the circuitry that is telling us\na pro social positive interaction is\nso highly reinforcing, evolved over\nmillions of years, or hundreds of\nthousands of years, whatever that is.\nAnd the only hypothesis I can come up\nwith, and Andrew, you may be able to come\nup with better ones, is what I alluded\nto earlier, is that it was very adaptive\nwhen we were more primitive organisms,\nnever mind non human primates, but when\nwe were whatever we were, to be a social\nspecies for basically primarily two\nreasons, for reproductive purposes, it\nincreased your likelihood of reproducing\nif you were hanging out with other members\nof your species in a non aggressive way\nand for protection against predators.\nAnd there may be other reasons, probably.\nAndrew Huberman: Child rearing\nin your absence, you want trusted\nfriends that can watch your offspring.\nRobert Malenka: Thank you.\nVery good point.\nSo the circuits, the modulators we use,\nthat evolved over millennia, and as\nyou pointed out, eventually, depending\non the society in which you live, you\ndidn't need those social interactions\nfor protection against predators.\nAlthough if we look at our world now,\none can make arguments both ways.\nIf you're in a war zone, is it\nbetter to be off by yourself?\nIs it better to be with a group of people?\nBut so the mechanisms evolved for one\npurpose, and they don't just disappear\nbecause there's no disadvantage to\nhaving this mechanism that tells us\na social interaction is reinforcing.\nAnd I would still argue there's\nbenefit for reproductive purposes.\nYou can't have kids if you're\nby yourself all the time.\nWell, this is actually, I think it's\nimpossible, at least currently, and\nyou can't find a partner with whom\nto have kids if you're socially\nisolated or it makes it much harder.\nSo I hope I'm answering your question.\nAnd then, as you pointed out, for\nmany of us, there's a lot of positive\naspects to having friendships and\nhanging out with your friends.\nEmotional support, emotional buffering--\nAndrew Huberman: --And feeling connected.\nThere's something about feeling connected,\nthis notion of feeling connected, and\nlater we'll talk about psychedelics.\nBut this notion of feeling connected has\na lot to do with buffering loneliness.\nWhen we are alone, the memories and\nthe energy, for lack of a better\nword, that we feel in recalling\nsocial experiences and anticipating\nsocial experiences is really powerful.\nYou mentioned that people\ncan't have children if they\nspend all their time alone.\nI realize you're not on social\nmedia and more power to you.\nBut there's actually a prominent\ndiscussion on social media.\nThere's an entire culture of young people,\nin particular young men these days,\nwho, at least from what I understand in\nthe research literature about this, are\nsocially isolated, spending all their time\nonline, maybe not even on social media,\nbut are spending a lot of time online.\nVideo games, hiding in\nelectronic landscapes, digital\nlandscapes, and concern about\nmental health issues there, etc.\n, concern about porn, overuse\nand addiction there, etc.\n. But social media itself is an incredible\nphenomenon to consider in light\nof everything we're talking about.\nEven though I am on all social media\nplatforms and I am quite active\nthere, I can't say that I've ever\nbeen on social media and experienced\nthe kind of delight and thrill and\npersistent energy increase that I\nexperience with in-person interaction.\nAnd yet social media, I have to\nassume, is capitalizing on some\nof these same reward mechanisms in\npresumably the nucleus accumbens.\nSo are there any data?\nI realize this is a hard experiment\nto do in mice, maybe impossible,\nbut are there any data that you're\naware of that shows that social\nmedia has a high addictive liability?\nOr do we even need an experiment?\nRobert Malenka: I'm not\nsure we need an experiment.\nI think it clearly does.\nI agree with the point you're making.\nAlthough your podcast audience\nprobably doesn't know who I am.\nI am in my late sixties.\nI grew up--\nAndrew Huberman: --Well,\nthey know who you are now--\nRobert Malenka: --I grew up before\ncomputers, before cell phones.\nSo I still am a believer,\nperhaps in an old fashioned\nway, that physical interpersonal\nreactions are really important.\nObviously there are advantages to\nbeing able to interact over social\nmedia for all sorts of reasons.\nThere's a lot of positive\nand good from that.\nBut back to your question.\nCan we get addicted?\nI can't speak to social media.\nI can speak, and Anna Lemki, I think,\nis much more able to eloquently\ndescribe the issues around this.\nI can just talk from my own experience\nthat my cell phone is and check, you know,\nthis isn't social media, but checking my\nemail messages, checking my texting, my\ntext messages for me has a compulsive,\naddictive quality, like a lever press.\nIt's like a lever press for a mouse.\nAnd part of that is my own personality.\nPart of that is the immediate feedback.\nSo you get from a social media post,\nfrom seeing your name mentioned, getting\na message from one of your friends.\nSure, I like getting\nmessages from my friends.\nIt means they're thinking about me.\nIt means I'm part of their world.\nI have no doubt it's activating my reward\ncircuitry, not nearly to the degree that\na hit of cocaine or an opioid would do.\nI don't know what else to say about it.\nI think as a society, we have to be\naware of these issues, and it's really\ncomplicated how we manage, especially\nonce you're an adult, you make your\nown decisions, for better or worse.\nBut it's a huge issue, obviously,\nfor anybody who has children or is\nplanning to have children and adults.\nAndrew Huberman: On social media, I see\nlots of accounts of people that are 18 and\nolder who spend a lot of time on there.\nAnd I'm not necessarily\nsaying that's a bad thing.\nA lot of people have entire\ncareers that exist on social media.\nIt just seems to me that Instagram,\nFacebook, LinkedIn, Twitter have\ncapitalized on this hardwired circuitry.\nI mean, to make it really reductionist,\nthe release of serotonin, dopamine, and\noxytocin by virtue of someone saying\nsomething to us, maybe not even a positive\nthing, maybe it's a negative thing.\nAs you said, they're thinking of us.\nThere's something about\nbeing recognized by others.\nAnd maybe this is a good segue.\nWe're heading towards empathy here.\nA discussion about empathy.\nRobert Malenka: I think\nthat's very well put.\nIt is capitalizing on these more primitive\nneurobiological mechanisms that evolved\nfor purposes of reproduction and survival.\nI think that certainly has to be the case.\nAnd I think it's important.\nI mean, thank you for bringing\nthat up for us as a society,\nto be at least aware of this.\nAnd it's like many things, it's\nnot all good, it's not all bad.\nThere are positive uses of social\nmedia, I can see, but mostly we\nread about the dangers of it.\nWe read about these kids who are socially\nisolated, who make bad decisions based\non what they're seeing with social media.\nBut anyhow, back to the neuroscience.\nYou're absolutely correct.\nIt's capitalizing on these mechanisms\nthat evolved for physical interpersonal\ninteractions because our evolution\ndidn't anticipate it, right?\nAndrew Huberman: Just as\npornography is capitalizing on\nthe sexual arousal reward circuit.\nAssociated reward--\nRobert Malenka: --No question about it.\nJust as the gambling industry does.\nI mean, as you know, the Vegas casinos\nhave full time people developing\nalgorithms for how frequently\nshould a slot machine pay off.\nYou know, what's the perfect\namount of payoff to keep\ncertain individuals coming back?\nAndrew Huberman: So pernicious.\nYou can tell I've been spending a lot of\ntime around addicts and former addicts.\nI've been researching some things\nfor the podcast and a gambling\naddict told me something interesting.\nThey said the real stinger with being\na gambling addict is that the next time\nreally could change everything, whereas no\nalcoholic says that, that the next drink\ncould change everything for the better.\nOr the cocaine addict doesn't think,\noh, the next line of cocaine could make\nall of life better now and forever,\nwhereas the gambling addict actually\nholds in mind the infinitesimally\nsmall and yet real potential that\nthe next time really could wipe out\ntheir debt and perhaps wipe out...\nAnd yet we know they would\nlose that, too, right?\nWhatever winnings they have.\nRobert Malenka: And casinos\nare fully aware of this.\nI have been told by friends who know\nthey employ full time quantitative,\nfor lack of a better term, I\nwas going to say computer geeks.\nI don't mean that to be derogative.\nAndrew Huberman: And\nprobably neuroscientists too.\nRobert Malenka: I would be amazed\nif they don't have neuroscientists\nwho have expertise in what's called\nneuroeconomics or behavioral economics.\nI'm 95% sure that has to be the case.\nAndrew Huberman: I occasionally sit\ndown to the roulette table because\nit’s just so passive and easy.\nAnd not long ago, actually, I had the\nexperience of winning, not a large\nsum, but a meaningful sum of money.\nRobert Malenka: It's fun.\nAndrew Huberman: And I'll tell you,\nmy sole mission at that point was\nto get up and go back to my room\nand not stop at another table.\nAnd I confess I pulled one brief stop\nat another table, played one hand and\nthen lost it, and then just got back to\nmy room as quickly as possible and then\nleft Las Vegas as quickly as possible.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah, gambling is--\nAndrew Huberman: --But they'll\nprobably get me the next time--\nRobert Malenka: --Yeah, gambling\nis, again, it all gets back to\nthis reward circuitry, and the\nintermittent rewards are very powerful.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, and you\nmentioned earlier that the reward\nsystem is powerfully tuned to remember\nwhat were the behaviors that led\nup to the rewarding experience.\nNobody ever won at the roulette\nor craps table or poker table\nby getting up and leaving.\nRobert Malenka: Right, exactly.\nAndrew Huberman: So I guess my brain\nwas just thinking, well, how did I win?\nI won by sitting down and putting chips on\nthe table, not by going back to my room.\nRobert Malenka: Exactly.\nAndrew Huberman: And yet I have a\nfair number of degrees, and I like to\nthink my prefrontal cortex is working.\nAnd yet it was still\nchallenging in that moment.\nRobert Malenka: Gambling is really another\nhuman activity that's quite complicated.\nIt can be enjoyable or it\ncan be incredibly damaging.\nAndrew Huberman: And now people are going\nto think I was that gambling addict that\nI was referred to, but I swear I'm not.\nFortunately, I feel very blessed\nthat that's not my addiction.\nI'd like to talk about empathy and\nuse that as a framework for eventually\nreturning to our discussion of autism.\nBut you have this perhaps\nlongstanding interest, but recent\nresearch interest in empathy.\nTell me about this work.\nI'm not familiar with it.\nRobert Malenka: Okay.\nSo I hope it's okay to drag in\nsome work I've done on this drug\ncalled MDMA because it is related.\nSo we were working on, in my lab, social\nbehaviors, positive pro social behaviors\nthat stimulated me to start thinking\nabout what are components of a positive\npro social, non aggressive interaction.\nA common key component of that is having\nsome empathy and compassion for the\nindividuals you're hanging out with.\nAnd it is a topic I've been\ninterested in for many, many decades.\nI was once a psychiatrist, and to get\non my, whatever the word is, hobby\nhorse, I look at the world today.\nI try to be optimistic again.\nI am a child of the '60s and '70s.\nWhen I look at the world, and I actually\njust did a trip to Israel to give a\nseries of lectures, and I look at the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, what\nalways enters my mind, and I've felt\nthis way for decades, is what is more\nimportant for the survival of the human\nspecies than empathy and compassion, than\nactually being able to look at another\nhuman being, even if they look different\nthan you, even if they have a different\nbelief system than you, what is more\nimportant than actually understanding\nthat 98% of your life is very similar?\nYou have some differences in how\nyou look and the beliefs you have,\nbut there's so much in common.\nSo what's more important than\nunderstanding that when another\nperson is suffering, their suffering\nis the same as your suffering and\nhaving compassion for somebody?\nSo I started thinking,\nwhat is more important?\nAnd I'm not a politician.\nAs you know, Andrew, I have\nno social media presence.\nI figured the only way I might be able\nto contribute to efforts that might\nhelp the human species enhance empathy\nand compassion is by studying the\nneurobiological underpinnings of it.\nAnd I didn't realize I might be able to do\nthat until I started studying sociability\nor prosocial behaviors in mice.\nAnd then I was able to have a\nyoung woman scientist, and I want\nto give her credit, Monique Smith.\nYou might want to have\nMonique on your podcast.\nShe's a dynamo.\nShe's now an assistant professor\nat UCSD, where you were.\nAnd Monique introduced me to a series\nof behavioral assays that I like to use\nthe phrase, they are measurements, they\nare behavioral antecedents of empathy.\nBecause in the world of psychologists\nand people who use the term\nempathy, it has a lot of different\nmeanings to different people.\nI'm using it basically to mean one member\nof a species manifests some behavior\nthat indicates it is being influenced\nby the emotional state, or what we\ncall the affective state, effective\nwith an “a” of another member of that\nspecies in its immediate environment.\nFor human interactions.\nI just think, we were talking about\nfriendships, any of us who watch\na close friend suffer, it's hard.\nYou want to do anything\nyou can to help them.\nThat's empathy.\nA mother with their child, a good\nmother, hopefully, when you have a kid\nwho is sick, there's nothing worse.\nAs a parent, you just want to\ntake that pain and suffering away.\nThat's how I'm defining empathy.\nSo it's my belief that like any\ncomplex human behavior, there are\nevolutionary reasons why that has been\nadaptive and important and maintained.\nAnd if it's evolutionarily evolved,\nthere are ways of studying it in\nmore primitive organisms, like mice.\nSo I'll tell you some of the\nbehavioral assays we're doing.\nOne is, and I get a kick out of this\nbecause it's pretty new for me, so\none assay, and we published a paper in\na journal called Science about this,\nwhich is if you take one mouse, and\nin an ethical way, you put it in pain,\nyou make its hind paw, one of its paws,\none of its feet hurt a modest amount,\nand you take another mouse and you let\nthat, what's known as the bystander\nmouse, just hang out with the mouse\nthat's in pain for 1 hour, just 1 hour.\nThe bystander mouse, who has\nexperienced no physical injury\nwhatsoever, will manifest behaviors\nindicating it is now in pain.\nAnd it lasts maybe four to 20 hours.\nbut think about that.\nA mouse that is normal hanging\nout with another mouse in pain\nstarts feeling pain itself.\nAndrew Huberman: And the mice are able\nto see one another and hear one another?\nRobert Malenka: Good point.\nSo you're getting to how is\nthat communication happening?\nAnd a lot more work\nneeds to be done on it.\nMonique and her previous\ncolleagues and others.\nOne component of it is\nprobably an olfactory cue,\nor what we call a pheromone.\nAndrew Huberman: So the mouse that's\nin pain is secreting an odor?.\nRobert Malenka: Probably, because you can\ntake bedding from mice in pain and expose\nthe bystander mice, so that's one thing.\nAnd I had never heard of\nthese behavioral assays.\nWe developed our, and this is pretty\ncool, and then I'll tell you two\nothers, and then I'll tell you how\nit connects to reward circuitry.\nWe developed a novel assay, which is\nthe social transfer of pain relief.\nPain relief is called analgesia.\nAnd I thought this was pretty cool.\nAnd this is in this paper that was\npublished in Science a year ago.\nYou take two mice and they're\nboth in pain, modest pain.\nI don't want your listeners to get upset.\nWe are not hurting these mice too\nbadly, and it is a tricky issue.\nIs it okay to put a mouse in\npain so you can, the goal is to\ndevelop better treatments for\nhuman beings in pain, obviously.\nSo you have two mice in modest pain.\nYou give one mouse morphine.\nSo it's now analgesic.\nIt is no longer experiencing pain.\nYou take another mouse that's in pain,\nand you just let it hang out with the\nmouse that is no longer in pain, and the\nmouse that is in pain will show behaviors\nindicating it is experiencing analgesia.\nIt is no longer in as much pain.\nNow think about that, and there's actually\nevidence from human studies that I can't\nspeak to in any comprehensive way where\nit's called social buffering of pain.\nTo be honest, I've been having some neck\npain just because I'm an old guy and I\nwoke up on the wrong side of the bed.\nAnd if I'm by myself, I focus on\nthat pain, and it bothers me more.\nIf I'm socially engaged, I think it's\nnot only that I'm not paying as much\nattention to the pain, but I think\nthere's actually some relief from what's\nknown as the social buffering of pain.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, I'm no hippie,\nbut I actually think that all species,\nincluding humans, are secreting molecules,\nmainly odorants, that are perhaps\neven acting directly as analgesics.\nAnd I can make that statement without\nworrying too much that people think I'm\ncompletely crazy because we had Noam\nSobel on the podcast from the Weisman\nwho shared with us not one, not two,\nbut at least a dozen ways in which\nhumans are making molecules, typically\nodors, and communicating those to one\nanother to powerfully impact their\ntestosterone levels, their vasopressin\nlevels, their immune molecules.\nAnd of course, Noam works on\nolfaction, so he's going to\nbe biased toward that system.\nBut that's just one slice\nof the sensory array.\nWhat about the way that somebody\ncan look at us in a way that makes\nus feel good on a normal day?\nWell, when we're in pain, just even\nthe touch to a shoulder can mean a lot.\nI remember going to meetings when I was an\nearly neuroscientist, and I would probably\nat that point, have not been the type to\njust walk up and say hello to you because\nI wasn't in your field, and you're this\nluminary and stuff, but I remember as\nI started, I'm a good guy, by the way.\nYou are very good.\nRobert Malenka: I always\nsay hi to everyone.\nAndrew Huberman: I know you are.\nAnd that statement was a reflection\non me, not a reflection on you.\nBut as I advanced through my career,\nwhat I found was you'd give a talk or\nsomething, and someone in your field\nmore senior to you, who you respected,\nwould give a nod or something.\nThose nods meant a lot.\nRobert Malenka: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: Those nods\ncould carry you a long distance.\nI mean, obviously, we want to be\nintrinsically driven to do the work we do,\nbut this social communication that we do--\nRobert Malenka: --We're a social species--\nAndrew Huberman: --I think there's\na whole landscape of things.\nSo what you're describing is incredible,\nbut I think makes a ton of sense.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah.\nSo we have this social transfer, pain\nof analgesia here we're working on, and\nthere's a little bit of evidence in the\nliterature suggesting this might work.\nAnd then I'll talk about reward\ncircuitry and maybe MDMA and is it an\nempathogen or not, and how that might\ninfluence therapeutic efforts for autism.\nWe're working on behavioral models.\nWe're asking the question, will one mouse\nbehave to give another mouse a reward?\nSo it's the mouse that's behaving\nthat has to press a bar or nose\npoke or even experience a shock.\nWill the mouse do that simply to\ngive one of its buddies a reward?\nAndrew Huberman: Pure altruism.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah.\nWe call it generosity, a generosity assay.\nAnd early days, it looks\nlike it might be working.\nAnd that's a generosity assay.\nWe can also ask the\nquestion, will a mouse work?\nSo another mouse doesn't get a shock,\ndoesn't get hurt, which is compassion.\nAnd I think these things\nare going to be working.\nAnd whether you want to call that\nempathy, I would call it that.\nThose are behaviors, I like to use\nthe term behavioral antecedents of how\nwe define empathy in human beings and\nthe connection to reward circuitry.\nAnd the little bit of work we have\ndone on this is we presented evidence\nthat these behaviors we call the\nsocial transfer of pain, one mouse\nexperiencing pain just because it's\nhanging out with another mouse.\nThe social transfer of analgesia.\nA mouse in pain getting some pain relief\nfrom hanging out with another mouse\nin pain, who has that pain relief.\nIt seems to involve one component of\nthe complex brain mechanisms, seems\nto involve a part of the brain called\nthe anterior cingulate cortex, which\nhuman brain imaging studies suggest is\nactivated during empathic human responses.\nAnd the projections of that\narea into the nucleus accumbens.\nThat's the connection.\nAnd we're interested in whether\nneuromodulators like dopamine and\nserotonin may influence this circuitry,\nthese connections that are involved\nin these \"empathic\" behaviors, etc.\n, etc . And we think drugs can be\nused as probes of those kinds\nof neuromodulatory mechanisms.\nI hope this is all making sense.\nAndrew Huberman: Makes excellent\nsense, and it's fascinating.\nI'm not one to suggest experiments\nto colleagues in areas where I\ndon't work, but I'm going to anyway.\nRobert Malenka: Yeah, please.\nAndrew Huberman: One,\nYou're a really smart guy.\nRobert Malenka: I will\nvalue your suggestions.\nAndrew Huberman: I love the motivational\nbackbone to what you're describing\nhere because I agree the world has a\nlot of issues, and what could be more\nimportant than to increase the amount\nof empathy and compassion in the world?\nBut one thing that we know inhibits\nempathy and compassion is one's\nown challenges and struggles.\nAnd so I'm wondering if there's a way to\nintroduce something to this behavioral\nparadigm such that the working to provide\nanother animal relief from pain, one\nanimal working to provide relief of\nanother animal in pain, or an animal\nworking to provide pleasure reward for\nanother animal if it could be scaled\nwith how inconvenient that work is.\nRobert Malenka: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: If I'm very hungry.\nI mean, we're all taught to put our own\noxygen mask on first in some way too,\nso that we don't all die, so to speak.\nBut I grew up, for\ninstance, with one parent.\nMy mother was the kind of person who\nwould see, at that time, there were far\nfewer homeless people on the street.\nMaybe they were all\ninstitutionalized, I don't know.\nBut if she saw a homeless person\non the street of the town we lived\nin, she would literally pull over,\ngive them money, find hotels.\nShe had homeless people living in\nhotels all over the town we lived in.\nRobert Malenka: Good for her.\nAndrew Huberman: It was crazy.\nI mean, we couldn't get anywhere.\nThat was the problem, is we would\nnever arrive anywhere on time.\nAnd that's my excuse\nfor always being late.\nI was positively\nreinforced for being late.\nI always run late, and I always run...\nIncredible, right?\nJust a very strong sense of social,\nfantastic connection, that kind of thing.\nBut in any case, some\npeople are like that.\nShe could not experience any even modicum\nof inconvenience for helping others.\nRobert Malenka: Good.\nAndrew Huberman: Whereas I think\nmost of us feel like if I'm rushing\nto catch a flight and I see someone\nwho's struggling, I'm probably going\nto help them if they're in acute pain\nor it seems like a dire circumstance.\nBut let's be honest, most people are\nprobably going to prioritize their\nown stress and priorities, for lack\nof a better word, when the situation\noften calls for us to set those aside\nand tend to people that are suffering.\nSo if there was a way to introduce\na probe of the interplay of\ncircuitries that involve how\nconvenient or inconvenient it is.\nRobert Malenka: Fantastic.\nAndrew Huberman: Like if we're well\nfed, it's pretty easy to go out and\ngather and distribute food for others.\nBut if we're hungry, we tend\nto focus on our own hunger.\nRobert Malenka: So first, in full\ndisclosure, even though I'm studying\nempathy and compassion, I can look in\nthe mirror and say, I probably don't\npractice it nearly as much as I should.\nI'm thinking of your example.\nIf I was late for a plane, I'm not\nsure I would stop and help somebody.\nAnd I'm not saying--\nAndrew Huberman: --I think it depends\non w hat sort of suffering exactly.\nIf they're hemorrhaging on the side--\nRobert Malenka: --Of course--\nAndrew Huberman: --we all would\nof course, but a flat tire, right?\nYou might think, oh goodness,\ndo I have time for this?\nRobert Malenka: Yeah, exactly.\nSo I'm not proud of that statement.\nBut back to your question.\nYes, I think absolutely, we can design\nexperiments where, after we've established\nthe basic phenomenology, then we can\ntake our subject animal or mouse and\nput it into certain circumstances.\nIf it's hungry itself, will it work\nas hard to give another animal food?\nI mean, it's a good question because\nI'm not sure what the outcome will be.\nOne could predict it might work harder\nbecause it understands the \"hunger\" more.\nAndrew Huberman: I love that.\nRobert Malenka: Or it could be, of\ncourse it's not going to work hard for\nanother animal to get a food reward\nbecause it's starving itself and it\nneeds to take care of itself first.\nIt's a great question.\nWe're also asking questions about, do\nyou have to know your buddy mouse, right?\nAre you more likely to behave in a\ngenerous or compassionate way if you\ngrew up with that mouse in the way our\nmice grow up in academic environments?\nAnd if it's a stranger,\nhow will you behave?\nHow will you behave if you had a\nfight with that mouse previously?\nAnd it also matters, did you win\nthe fight or did you lose the fight?\nIntuitively, as we probably would all\nguess, I'm more likely to help somebody\nI defeated in a fight previously, because\nin the hierarchy, I'm the dominant one.\nI'm probably less likely\nif that person beat me up.\nSo all these are great questions.\nI think we can study them.\nI also think there are ways\nwe can study these kinds of\ninteractions in human subjects.\nNot that I am going to do that myself.\nAndrew Huberman: Someone at Stanford will.\n[LAUGHS]\nRobert Malenka: Yeah.\nSo I think there's also an opportunity,\nand I'm happy to discuss how\nneuromodulators, like in particular\nserotonin, but also perhaps dopamine and\noxytocin, may influence the circuitry\nin the brain mechanisms that are\nmediating what I term empathic behaviors.\nAndrew Huberman: Let's return to autism.\nRobert Malenka: All right.\nAndrew Huberman: Does autism\ninvolve a lack of empathy?\nDoes autism involve a restructuring of the\nreward system around social interactions?\nRobert Malenka: Maybe.\nAndrew Huberman: Considering the second\nquestion first, I could imagine, for\ninstance, that there are variations in\nbrain wiring that would make it such\nthat a kid who then becomes an adult\ngets a tremendous amount of reward\nfrom, I don't know, math, designing\nmugs, any number of activities.\nBut that through some variation in\nbrain wiring social interaction,\nspending time with friends is\njust not as socially rewarding.\nIt just doesn't feel good in the\nmoment, doesn't necessarily feel\nbad, but it's not selected for.\nAnd is there any evidence that's the\ncase in children who are classified\nas autistic or having autism?\nI want to be clear.\nI am not a world expert on\npathophysiology of individuals\nwith autism spectrum disorder.\nI have read some of the literature.\nI do study mouse models of genetically\nbased autism spectrum disorder.\nRobert Malenka: So the answer is\nyes, there have been imaging studies,\nand again, so certain members\nof your audience don't get mad,\nremember our earlier conversation?\nWe made the point that autism spectrum\ndisorder is a highly heterogeneous\nset of behavioral symptoms with\nwide variation in how these symptoms\nmanifest in each individual.\nSo we cannot make blanket statements\nthat individuals with autism\nspectrum disorder are this or that.\nBut there are studies both in human beings\nand mice that suggest that the reinforcing\ncomponent of a social interaction is much\nless or lacking in our models of autism\nspectrum disorder and certain individuals.\nAn important point is, is\nthat just genetically wired?\nWas that because in their early\nexperiences, they weren't able to get\nthe sensory stimuli that tell them\nthis is a reinforcing social experience\nunknown, or at least those are topics\nthat I think are worthy of investigation.\nDo individuals or mice with\nautism spectrum disorder lack\nor do not have the capacity or\nthe same experience of empathy?\nAgain, a very complex topic in\nquestion, and it's very likely for\nsome individuals, the answer is yes,\nmeaning they do lack some of the\nneural mechanisms that allow them.\nBut that probably doesn't\napply to everybody.\nI can say in our mouse models of social\ninteractions and our mouse models of\n\"empathy,\" our mice show deficits and\nthose deficits can be rescued, meaning\nimproved upon by manipulations of certain\nneuromodulatory systems, in this case,\nthe serotonin system, by giving drugs,\nincluding a drug called MDMA or Ecstasy.\nSo I hope I'm answering your question.\nI think these are worthwhile\nsubjects for investigation.\nI think there's a lot of\nvalue in studying them.\nAndrew Huberman: Let's go back to\nserotonin in the nucleus accumbens.\nWe will get into this in a bit\nmore detail when we discuss MDMA.\nBut I've now spent a lot of time\nwith a recent paper of yours--\nRobert Malenka: --Really?\nWhich one?\nAndrew Huberman: The MDMA paper.\nRobert Malenka: The Boris Heifets one?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, that parsed\nthe relative roles of dopamine in the\nnucleus accumbens versus serotonin in\nthe nucleus accumbens . By the way,\nfolks, by the time this episode comes\nout, an episode all about MDMA itself\nand its modes of action will have already\naired, and you can find that, but even\nif you haven't heard that, MDMA is an\namazing molecule because it profoundly\nincreases dopamine, and that's why the\nword methamphetamine is actually in MDMA.\nStill a surprise to many people\nto hear that, but it also robustly\nincreases serotonin transmission.\nAnd what I love about the paper from\nyour lab that explored this is that, at\nleast by my read of the data, it showed\nvery convincingly that it's serotonin\nreleased in the nucleus accumbens that's\nresponsible for the prosocial effects\nof MDMA, whereas oxytocin, this thing\nwe talked about earlier that everyone\nassumes is the pair bonding molecule,\nthe molecule of love, both in humans,\nnow there's a study in humans and in\nthe mouse work that you've done, doesn't\nseem to play as prominent a role in the\nsocial enhancement that MDMA causes.\nAnd the reason I'm asking this in\nthe context of autism is that for\na long time, there was excitement\nabout the idea that oxytocin nasal\nsprays might make autistic kids more\nexcited about social interactions,\nmore tuned to social interactions.\nFirst question is, is there any\nevidence that increasing oxytocin\nin a child or adult with autism\nmakes them somehow more social or\ndesiring more social connections?\nI'm not aware of any.\nRobert Malenka: I think it is worthwhile.\nIt has been studied.\nI don't think we can close the door\non the potential therapeutic uses of\noxytocin from the people I know who\nare much more expert in this than I am.\nI think most of the clinical trials\nhave been pretty disappointing,\nwith a lot of hope that intranasal\noxytocin would promote more\npositive pro social experiences.\nI don't think the door is shut yet.\nThere may be different\nways of administering it.\nThere may be ways of making a different\ntype of oxytocin that might be beneficial.\nI have a colleague at Stanford who's\nactually looking at a related neuropeptide\ncalled vasopressin, and she's finding\nsome potential benefit from that.\nAnd vasopressin and oxytocin are\nclosely related to each other.\nThey can even activate some of the same,\nwhat we call receptors in the brain.\nSo I don't think the door is closed\non the possibility of oxytocin\nor related therapeutic agents\nhaving some therapeutic potential.\nThe evidence, as far as I'm aware,\nis not there yet in terms of\nMDMA, again, complicated story.\nAs you pointed out, MDMA, its major\nmolecular targets, don't want to get\ntoo technical here, are the serotonin\nvacuum cleaner, the molecule that vacuums\nup serotonin, and the dopamine vacuum\ncleaner, the molecule that vacuums up,\nand, excuse my language, sucks up dopamine\nwhen it's released, because it's an\namphetamine derivative, as you correctly\npointed out, it not only prevents these\nproteins, we call them, these molecules,\nthese vacuum cleaners, from vacuuming\nup the dopamine and serotonin when it's\nreleased, it actually causes it, how\ndo I, I don't want to use the terms\nto vomit out dopamine and serotonin--\nAndrew Huberman: --That's\nwhat I say on the podcast--\nRobert Malenka: --Am I allowed\nto say that?-- [LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: --when I talk about\nsynaptic release, I'm known for, on my\nsolo episodes, for when I talk about\nsynaptic release, I'll say that they\n[MAKES VOMITING SOUND] they vomit out.\n[LAUGHS]\nRobert Malenka: So what\namphetamine derivatives--\nAndrew Huberman: --But you\nwork on synaptic transmission.\nThat's almost an insult to a\n[inaudible] synaptic transmission.\nRobert Malenka: What MDMA does\nis it actually calls what's\nknown as a reverse transport.\nIt not only prevents the vacuum\ncleaners from sucking up the dopamine\nand serotonin, it causes it to\nspew out dopamine and serotonin.\nSo imagine if your vacuum cleaner\nstarted, the pressure in your vacuum\ncleaner reversed, and all the dirt you\ncollected started being spewed out.\nNow, the one difference for MDMA, and\nit's a fascinating topic, I hope we have\ntime to talk about, is why does MDMA,\nqualitatively, for most people, give\nhuman subjects a different experience\nthan cocaine or methamphetamine,\nor especially methamphetamine.\nAndrew Huberman: Presumably, it's the\nfact that there's so much serotonin.\nRobert Malenka: Exactly.\nAnd so if you actually get into, and\nthis is why, for your audiences, this\nis why hardcore molecular science\ncan actually teach us something about\ncomplex human behavioral phenomena,\nsuch as social interactions and\naddiction, at least the hypothesis\nwe propose and others in the field.\nIt's not just, science\nis not done in isolation.\nSo I want to give credit\nwhere creditors do.\nWe did not define the following,\nthat MDMA affects the serotonin\nsystem more than the dopamine system.\nSo it's not 50/50.\nMaybe it's 70/30, 80/20.\nAnd that's because the molecule itself\nof MDMA, again, I'm trying not to use\nlanguage, it binds to, has a higher\naffinity, it likes to bind to and\ninfluence the serotonin vacuum cleaner\nmore than the dopamine vacuum cleaner.\nIt's still affecting\nboth, but it's not 50/50.\nIt's more, whatever, 70%\nserotonin, 30% dopamine.\nAnd then it does influence oxytocin\nin very complex ways, which is\na further technical discussion.\nThere was just a nice paper that\ncame out that reported that serotonin\nreleases in a hypothalamic structure,\nwhich, again, the hypothalamus,\nyou can explain to your listeners.\nAndrew Huberman: A marble-ish size\nstructure above the roof of your\nmouth, responsible for sex, temperature\ncontrol, feeding and satiety, and\na bunch of other things critical.\nRobert Malenka: And it's a home\nof neurons that produce oxytocin.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you.\nRobert Malenka: So this paper\nreported that when serotonin is\nreleased in the hypothalamus, it\nactivates and causes the release of\noxytocin that's in the hypothalamus.\nOur work in the reward\ncircuitry suggested oxytocin.\nSo that's serotonin upstream of oxytocin\nin the hypothalamus, where we were looking\nin the accumbens, it was the opposite.\nOxytocin caused the release of serotonin.\nSo the point to your listeners is the\nbrain is unfortunately complicated.\nIt's tractable.\nWe like to come up with general\nhypotheses and principles, but\nsometimes the devil's in the details,\nand we really need to probe deeper.\nSo back to your question about our\nprevious paper and dopamine and serotonin.\nSo what we proposed, which is far from\nnailed down, is that MDMA, because it is\nan amphetamine derivative, does influence\ndopamine release and the dopamine system.\nAnd some of my colleagues in\nthe MDMA field, who I respect\nenormously, don't like me to say\nthis, but I'm going to say it anyhow.\nRemember earlier in the podcast, we\ntalked about different substances\nhaving addictive liabilities?\nDoesn't mean a substance is\nautomatically addictive, doesn't\nmean it's automatically not, it's a\ncontinuum, and I would argue that MDMA\ndoes have some addictive liability\nbecause it is an amphetamine derivative.\nAndrew Huberman: It feels good.\nRobert Malenka: And it feels good.\nAnd so there are individuals that,\nespecially as your listeners may know,\nMDMA has gotten a lot of attention\nbecause it's in a therapeutic\ntrial that looks very promising\nas an adjunct to psychotherapy for\npost traumatic stress disorder.\nAnd the FDA, the part of our government\nthat approves or disapproves the legal\ndistribution of therapeutic drugs, may\nend up approving MDMA for certain uses.\nThe point being is that if it gets\napproved, my personal feeling is it\nwill have some addictive liability.\nIt also has this very powerful,\nwhat you and I might term\nAndrew, a pro social effect.\nSome people even call it an empathogen.\nThat's a little controversial, meaning\nit enhances your capacity for empathy, to\nexperience the emotional state of another\nindividual, to want to understand that\nperson's experiences and emotional state.\nAnd what we've suggested is that\nthe addictive liability is mostly,\nalthough not solely, being, mediated\nby its actions on the dopamine system,\nwhereas its positive, more pro social\neffects and perhaps its empathogenic\neffects are more likely to be mediated\nby its interactions with the serotonin\nsystem in this reward circuitry.\nAnd we're actually doing a lot\nof work to test that hypothesis.\nWe're actually testing MDMA in\nthese behavioral models of empathy\nin mice, and it looks like our\nhypothesis is being supported.\nThe other thing to drive your\nlisteners crazy about, sorry,\nlisteners, how complex the brain is.\nIf you think it--\nAndrew Huberman: --Listen, neither\nyou nor I were consulted at the\ndesign phase, and so we don't have to\napologize for the brain's complexity\n.\n Robert Malenka: [LAUGHS] Because, trust\nme, as a scientist, I wish I could\nkeep things as simple as possible.\nThat's what good science is.\nIt turns out serotonin is produced\nby neurons in another part of the\nbrain with this wonderful name\ncalled the dorsal raphe nucleus.\nAnd it turns out the serotonin\nneurons talk to the dopamine neurons\nand influence the dopamine neurons.\nIt's, again, the point we made earlier\nin your podcast, even though it's fun\nand useful both for your listeners\nand as scientists to think about\nthese powerful chemical messengers\nin isolation, because that's how we\ncan make progress scientifically.\nIt's how your audience can understand\nsome of the concepts that have been\nelucidated from brain research over the\ndecades, but they don't work in isolation.\nThey influence each other.\nThey communicate with each other.\nWe're actually doing studies showing\nthat serotonin release in the accumbens\nactually modulates dopamine release.\nSo it gets crazy complicated.\nBut you can still develop simplistic\nhypotheses, like, as I was saying, about\nMDMA, where abuse, addictive liability,\nand some of its reinforcing qualities,\nwhich you just mentioned, MDMA, a lot of\npeople find it fun to take it, is probably\nmostly being mediated via the dopamine\nsystem, and some of its social effects are\nbeing mediated by the serotonin system.\nWe're actually doing studies to\nfigure out whether the reinforcing\ncomponent of a social experience\nrequires that dopamine release.\nProbably does.\nAndrew Huberman: That's\nwhat I'm most interested in,\nreally, in the context of MDMA.\nAnd we should just mention, because\nwe do like to mention these caveats.\nYes.\nAnd I can say this because I\nparticipated in a trial with MDMA.\nIt is a very pleasant experience.\nIt's certainly not for everybody.\nIt still is a schedule\none drug at this moment.\nRobert Malenka: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: So you can go to\njail for possessing or selling it.\nIn fact, there was a big bust recently\nin Canada and another one in Brussels.\nLarge amounts of MDMA collected.\nThose people are probably going to go\nto prison for a long period of time.\nSo you don't want to\ntake it or possess it.\nIt's illegal.\nWe're talking about clinical trials here.\nBut also the fentanyl issue.\nThere's a lot of fentanyl contamination.\nRobert Malenka: And I was just going\nto mention it to your listeners.\nAndrew Huberman: So we'd be\nremiss if we didn't mention.\nA lot of people are dying thinking\nthat they're taking one drug\nwhen they're taking another.\nSo we are not encouraging\nthe use of these.\nBut I will say that the subjective\nexperience of MDMA, provided it's done\nin the appropriate clinical setting,\nit's actually, MDMA doesn't contain\nother things dosed correctly, etc.\n, is a pleasant one, for sure.\nAnd my sense is that the dopamine release\nis reinforcing the experience, that the\ncontext that serotonin is providing with\na social context and the word context\nthere becomes important when we think\nabout back to the 90s when there were a\nlot of raves and people were also getting,\nI guess, positive feedback from the\ninteractions they were having, dancing\nall night, partying with friends, etc.\nI think that returning to the issue\nof autism and the role of serotonin,\nso in autism, there seems to be\nless of a reinforcement pathway for\ncertain kinds of social interactions\nin some individuals with autism.\nAnd I'm aware that there are some\nprescription treatments for autism\nthat capitalize on the serotonergic\nsystem and dopamine system.\nSo is it fentamine?\nRobert Malenka: To my knowledge,\nthe only FDA approved pharmacologic\ntherapeutic for individuals with autism\nspectrum disorder is actually, oh,\nGod, I'm just blanking, it's not a\nserotonergic drug, I have to look it up.\nI want to say risperidone for agitation.\nThere is no drug for, for lack of\na better term, the social deficits.\nThere's no FDA approved drug.\nIf you look at the literature,\npsychiatrists and individuals with\ngood intention have tested the\nutility of traditional serotonergic\ndrugs like Prozac, SSRIs.\nThere are drugs known as SNRIs, drugs\nthat influence serotonin release, and\nanother neuromodulator that you know\nwell, norepinephrine and at least well\ndone clinical trials, which in my view,\nas an academic, are very important.\nNone of them have shown efficacy.\nHaving said that, there are several\ncompanies, and full disclosure here,\nI am the founder of a small biotech\ncalled Maplite Therapeutics, and\nI'm not advertising for Maplite.\nI'm just doing a full disclosure.\nIt was founded with Karl Deisseroth,\nwho you've had on your podcast,\nand an entrepreneur in San\nFrancisco named Karoly Nikolich.\nAnd we have a phase two trial.\nPhase two trial means it's a safe drug.\nWe've done all the safety work,\nand it's a drug that targets a\nsubtype of receptor for serotonin.\nSerotonin works on many different,\nI don't know, what word can\nI use other than receptors?\nAndrew Huberman: No, listeners\nof this podcast will probably\nbe familiar with receptors, sort\nof parking spots for molecules.\nYes.\nThe paper I was referencing earlier from\nyour lab, it talked about serotonin 1B\nreceptors being particularly important.\nRobert Malenka: The point being\nis I do have an interest in this.\nCan you use the type of\ndiscoveries we've made in mice?\nMight it actually have any relevance\nto human beings, in particular\nthose who, some of which have\nsome sort of sociability deficits?\nOther companies are pursuing this, too.\nSo MDMA itself, there has been.\nI don't know if it's ongoing.\nThere's a well known organization.\nI don't know if you've ever had\nanybody from MAPS on this podcast.\nThe Multidisciplinary Association\nfor Psychedelic Studies.\nMAPS deserves a lot of credit for being\na pioneer in saying, in particular with\nMDMA, promoting the idea that this drug\ndeserves rigorous and ethical study.\nThat's at least my view and MAPS , which\nwas founded by an individual named Rick\nDoblin, deserves enormous credit for\ntheir 30 year effort to make it allowed\nand legal to actually study MDMA.\nThe point I'm making is I know\nMAPS, and perhaps others, have done\nsome small trials studying MDMA in\nindividuals, high functioning individuals\nwith some form of social anxiety.\nI'm saying this because this is public.\nThere's another company called\nMindMed, which is one of the publicly\ntraded psychedelic companies,\nand this is on their website.\nFull disclosure, I am on their\nscientific advisory board.\nThey are gearing up to do a trial\nof a, I don't want to get too\ntechnical, of a certain form of MDMA.\nThere are two different types of MDMA.\nThey have these horrible\nnames called enantiomers.\nSo the MDMA that is used for clinical\ntrials that MAPS, MDMA is a molecule, and\nit has mirror images of itself, and one\nhas the name RMDMA and one has the name\nSMDMA, and they're called the enantiomers\nbecause they're mirror images of each\nother and other labs over the years, not\nmy lab, I deserve no credit for this,\nhave done some studies to suggest that\nthe S enantiomer is the one that has\na higher interaction with the dopamine\nsystem, and the R enantiomer has a higher\ninteraction with the serotonin system.\nAndrew Huberman: Interesting.\nRobert Malenka: If you look at the\nliterature on autism spectrum disorder\nin human subjects, there's a bunch of\npapers suggesting serotonergic systems\nare malfunctioning in individuals\nwith autism spectrum disorder.\nAnd if you look at reviews I've\nwritten or any of my papers, we\nprobably cite some of the reviews.\nAndrew Huberman: It's clear that\nserotonin is playing some role in\nsocial interactions, at least in mice\nand almost certainly in humans as well.\nIt's hard to imagine, based on data\nfrom everything from SSRIs to neurotoxic\nlesions of the human brain, etc.\n, that it's not also playing at\nleast a similar role in humans.\nRobert Malenka: Right, and\nI fully agree with that.\nAnd as we were discussing, there's a\nmodestly extensive clinical literature,\nmeaning literature from human subjects,\nsuggesting that some aspects of brain\nsystems that utilize serotonin as one\nof their signaling molecules, one of\ntheir neuromodulatory mechanisms, may\nnot be functioning in some populations of\nindividuals with autism spectrum disorder.\nSo based on that, based on my lab's\nwork on the role of serotonin in\nmodifying reward circuitry, its role in\npro social behaviors, and the biggest\nclue, which I think you would agree\nwith, Andrew, is this drug, MDMA.\nI mean this is why, I am not a\ndruggie myself, I am a child of\nthe '60s and '70s, which means I'm\n20 years older than you, Andrew.\nI did experiment, like everybody\nof my generation, with psychoactive\nsubstances in the 70s, so I don't\nwant to lie about my experiences.\nI also will say, like many\nneuroscientists, my experiences with\npsychoactive substances stimulated\nmy interest in neuroscience.\nHow do these substances work?\nWhy, when I was a young kid,\nthe first time I got drunk on\nbeer, why is that happening?\nBut more seriously, I use drugs in my\nresearch as powerful probes of brain\nfunction with the advantage that, and now\nI'm talking scientist to scientist with\nyou, Andrew, they have molecular targets\nthat we can manipulate in rigorous ways.\nWe can figure out where in the\nbrain they act using the modern\ntools of neuroscience, which\nyour audience may not know about.\nI'm saying this to you, conditional\nknockout mice, rescue experiments.\nWe can do all this fancy stuff,\nand we can use drugs to study even\nthings as complicated as empathy.\nAnd I really do believe that it's\nwhy I've been interested in MDMA for\ndecades, is there's a clue there.\nHow does a drug that has molecular\ntargets in the dopamine neuromodulatory\nsystem, in the serotonin\nneuromodulatory system have such a\npowerful effect, which is relatively\nspecific on social interactions?\nIt doesn't make you want\nto go eat more donuts.\nI don't know, for me,\nthere's a clue there.\nThere's something really important from\nthat phenomenological observation in the\nhuman experiences that we can learn from.\nAndrew Huberman: I completely agree\nabout MDMA, and we've done a couple\nof podcasts about psilocybin and by\nextension, LSD, because even though\nthere are differences there, psilocybin,\nLSD, as far as we understand, largely\nwork through activation of the\nserotonin 2A receptor, broadening\nof a brain network connectivity.\nSo again, it's serotonin, serotonin,\nserotonin, but different receptors,\nvery different subjective experience.\nAnd I guess perhaps the best way to\ndescribe it is that LSD and Psilocybin\nare almost always considered mystical in\ntheir subjective effects, whereas MDMA\ncan be an empathogen, an actogen, and\nso serotonin acting through different\nreceptor systems, impacting and creating\nvery different subjective experiences.\nI also agree.\nI think MDMA is particularly interesting\nfor the neuroscientist, perhaps also\nbecause, at least to my knowledge,\nthere is no substance in nature,\nno plant, no mushroom, no ergot, no\nmold that creates this increase in\ndopamine and serotonin simultaneously.\nMDMA is a synthesized molecule,\nand so it may be one of the, again,\nhighlighting all the safety issues\nand things we talked about before.\nIt may be one of the great, at least\nexperimental probes of the brain\nthat humans have developed, and it\nmay be one of the great therapeutic\nprobes that folks like MAPS are\nnow doing such fantastic work on.\nSo I'm very excited about what's\nhappening with the research on MDMA,\nand I'm so glad that your laboratory\nhas parsed some of the relative roles\nof serotonin, the receptors involved.\nSince we mentioned serotonin 2A\nfor psilocybin and LSD, we'd be\nremiss if we didn't say that this\nwonderful paper that we will provide\na link to in the show note captions.\nBy the way, folks, that Rob Malenka\nhere's lab focused on the serotonin 1B\nreceptor, so even just differences in\nreceptor subtypes leading to profoundly\ndifferent subjective outcomes, I\nfind that to be just one of the\nmost important areas that one could\neven think about, let alone work on.\nRobert Malenka: Thank you.\nI appreciate the compliment.\nI will also say, like everything we're\nfinding, it's not all about only serotonin\n1B, but as you know, again, pointing to\nthe amazing and powerful complexity of\nthe human brain or the mammalian brain,\nthere are 16 different serotonin parking\nspots or receptors that are distributed\nin different brain areas in complex ways.\nAnd so that's daunting.\nBut it also offers possibilities for\ndeveloping very novel therapeutic agents\nthat activate or inhibit these in complex\nways, hopefully for therapeutic benefit.\nAndrew Huberman: So, before we\nconclude, I'm very curious to get\nyour opinion on what you see as the\nlandscape of the work on psychedelics\nand MDMA, which isn't really a classic\npsychedelic, but all these drugs that,\nas you pointed out during your youth,\nwere used recreationally and for mind\nexploration and expansion and are now\nbeing probed as potential therapeutics\nfor various mental health challenges,\nas well as potentially expanding\nconsciousness, empathy, and all of that.\nI mean, not getting into the details\nof the legal issues that have to be\novercome, not even necessarily talking\nabout the clinical trials or the\npeople doing the work in different\nlaboratories, but just, I have to imagine\nthis must amuse, tickle, surprise you.\nI mean, how do you feel\nabout what you're seeing now?\nBecause it is a very exciting\ntime for these compounds.\nRobert Malenka: It tickles me and\nexcites me with the appropriate caution.\nSo I do think drugs are very\npowerful probes of brain function.\nI think this class of drug, which, as\nyou correctly pointed out, people use\nthe term psychedelics scientifically.\nWhen pursuing their understanding,\ntheir therapeutic potential,\ntheir mechanism of action.\nIt's more useful to divide them\nup into different categories.\nThe classic hallucinogens, which are\nLSD and psilocybin, the intact or\nempathogens, which is MDMA, which is\nreally a qualitatively different drug.\nThere are other substances which\nwe don't have time to talk about,\nlike ibogaine and ayahuasca, which\nare very complex, and peyote.\nBut nevertheless, I am tickled and\nexcited as a child of the '60s and '70s.\nBut I am also not evangelical about their\nuse and their therapeutic potential.\nSo as you can imagine what I'm going\nto say, I think they should be the\nsubject of rigorous, sophisticated,\nand most importantly, ethical research.\nI think we could learn a lot about how the\nbrain works and its amazing capabilities.\nI think they may notice, I say may have\ntherapeutic potential, but I do not\nthink they're going to be miracle cures.\nAnd I do worry, as somebody who\nlived through the '60s and '70s and\nwatched, because of the history of\nTimothy Leary and his colleagues,\nand the political landscape of how\nthey were being used and promoted,\nI am cautious that these substances\nneed to be studied scientifically and\nrigorously, and I hope that's the case.\nAnd I want to caution your\naudience that not everybody\nshould take these substances.\nThey are not miracle cures.\nAnd while they certainly may be of benefit\nto certain individuals who are suffering,\nand they certainly may provide unusual\nand \"mystical\" experiences for certain\nindividuals, I am very concerned that\nthere are individuals out there that will\ngain access to these substances and have\nvery bad experiences, because anybody\nwho grew up in the '60s and '70s knows\nall about bad trips, and truth be told,\nI have had a bad trip or two in the '70s,\nand I'm glad I did, because it made me...\nI have no idea what a suicidal depression\nfeels like where you are experiencing such\na darkness, such a lack of hope that a\nrational decision is to end one's life.\nAnd I think the closest I ever came to\nthat experience is a bad trip on LSD.\nAnd I do have concerns that if you\nlook at the clinical trials that\nhave been done, the well done, not\nthe anecdotal, I went and saw some\npsychedelic therapist that a friend\nrecommended and it did wonders for me.\nBut the well controlled clinical trials\nthat are being done by certain biotechs,\nsome academic institutions, they have very\nstrict, what are known as inclusionary\nand exclusionary criteria about who is\nallowed to participate in the subject,\nand they rule out a lot of people.\nSo I don't mean to be overly cautious,\nbut I do worry that if some people take\nthese substances and bad things happen,\nit will slow down the excitement that's\ncurrently happening, and it will make\nit more difficult for serious human\nsubjects researchers, preclinical\nresearchers, to study these substances\nin the way they deserve to be studied.\nSo I hope that articulates my viewpoint.\nAndrew Huberman: I think it does,\nand thank you for that viewpoint.\nIt's an important counterbalance\non a lot of the excitement\nthat we hear about these days.\nI think the state of Kentucky just\nrecently decided to give $42 million from\nthe opioid lawsuit settlement with Purdue\npharmaceuticals to the study of ibogaine.\nSo there's a lot happening.\nRobert Malenka: Just to be clear, I\nthink there's no problem with that,\nand I actually would support that.\nAs long as the studies of ibogaine\nare done thoughtfully, carefully,\nand ethically, I see no problem\nwith testing its efficacy in certain\nmental illnesses and addiction.\nAnd it's actually a topic I know\na little bit about, but we'll\nsave that for another time.\nAndrew Huberman: Great.\nWell, first off, I want to thank\nyou for coming here and sharing\nyour knowledge with all of us.\nFor me, it's been a real thrill.\nAnd I also just want to thank you\nfor the incredible amount of work\nthat you've done over the years.\nI know it's still ongoing.\nYou're by no means retiring.\nI certainly hope not.\nBut I'm sure the listeners have now\ngotten a clear picture of the enormous\nnumber of contributions and areas you've\nworked on everywhere from, as I mentioned\nearlier, neuroplasticity at the cellular\nlevel, molecular level, addiction, work\nrelating to social cognition and social\ninteractions, rather as it pertains\nto autism models, and now psychedelics\nand empathy, and on and on and again,\ntrained so many prominent scientists in\nour field, and to take time out of your\nschedule to come sit here with us and\nshare some of that knowledge and stimulate\nour thinking and, as you mentioned,\nraise still more questions that need\nto be resolved is a real privilege.\nSo thank you ever so much.\nAnd indeed, as you just mentioned,\nwe'd love to have you back\nagain for another conversation.\nRobert Malenka: All I can say is\nI want to thank you for having me.\nI was a little hesitant or nervous about\ncoming here,
