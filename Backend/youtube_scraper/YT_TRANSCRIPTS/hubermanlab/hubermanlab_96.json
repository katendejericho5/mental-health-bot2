    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are discussing ways\nto improve your fitness.\nIn particular we are\ngoing to discuss tools\nthat you can incorporate\ninto your existing fitness\nroutine that will\nallow you to make\nsignificant improvement\nwithout having\nto invest a lot of extra time.\nMost all of the tools we\nare going to discuss today\nwere gleaned from the\n6 episodes that we\ndid with Dr. Andy Galpin.\nWe provide a link to those\nfull episodes in the show note\ncaptions, of course.\nNow, those episodes\nincluded a very large number\nof protocols, everything from\nhow to build a fitness, routine\nhow to enhance recovery,\nnutrition and supplementation,\nexercises and routines\naimed specifically\nat strength or\nhypertrophy or endurance\nor building anaerobic capacity.\nWhat I've done is to select key\nprotocols from those episodes\nthat I myself have\nstarted to incorporate\ninto my existing fitness\nroutine and that I\nthink will be especially\nbeneficial and frankly fun\nfor you to incorporate\ninto your fitness routine.\nNow, a little bit\nlater in this episode,\nI review the key components\nof any fitness program, that\nis the number and type of\ncardiovascular training\nsessions and resistance\ntraining sessions\nthat are essential for\neveryone to include\nas a template or a foundation\nfor their overall fitness\nprogram.\nNow, a little bit\nlater in the episode,\nI will be sure to\nreview what are\nthe essential components\nof any fitness program,\nso the number and type of\nresistance training sessions,\nthe number and type of\ncardiovascular training\nsessions, as well as\nsome of the elements\nof how those are\narranged to ensure\nproper and adequate\nrecovery between sessions\nso that you can continue\nto make ongoing progress.\nHowever, the bulk of\ntoday's discussion\nis going to focus on tools\nthat you can use again very\neasily, very quickly, in\nsome cases even saving you\ntime during your\nfitness regimen in order\nto improve all aspects of\nyour fitness, your endurance,\nyour muscular endurance,\nyour anaerobic capacity,\nyour recovery, your\nstrength, your hypertrophy.\nAnd in describing these tools\nto improve your fitness,\nit also provides an opportunity\nfor each and all of us\nto step back from our\nexisting fitness routine\nand ask whether or not\nit's really checking off\nall the boxes that\nare necessary,\nas well as where we can be\nmore economical with our time\nand our efforts\nin order to reach\nour specific goals related\nto exercise and performance.\nSo by the end of\ntoday's episode,\nyou can be sure that\nyou have at least one\nand as many as 12 tools\nthat you can incorporate\ninto your existing\nfitness routine,\nagain, without adding much\nadditional time or effort that\nare sure to accelerates\nyour progress.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand nothing you\ndon't, that means\nplenty of salt, sodium,\nmagnesium, and potassium,\nthe electrolytes, but no sugar.\nHaving adequate\nelectrolytes is absolutely\ncritical to cellular function,\nin particular the function\nof neurons.\nIn order for your neurons\nto function properly\nyou need electrolytes\nin your system,\nand you need to\nbe well hydrated.\nThere's a lot of research\nto support the fact\nthat if you are even mildly\ndehydrated, that your cognition\nsuffers, your physical\nperformance suffers,\nand your sleep can also suffer.\nSo getting adequate electrolytes\nand hydration is key,\nand element allows\nyou to do that.\nI typically mix LMNT into\n16 to 32 ounces of water\nand drink that first\nthing in the morning.\nI'll also drink another\none during exercise,\nand sometimes another one after\nexercise as well, especially\nif I've been sweating a lot,\nor it's a particularly hot day.\nIf you'd like to try\nelement, you can go\nto drinklmnt.com/huberman,\nand that's spelled\nL-M-N-T.com/huberman.\nAnd you can claim a free\nsample pack with your purchase.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt,\nL-M-N-T.com/huberman to claim\na free sample pack.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes\nmattresses and pillows\nthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.\nI've talked many times\nbefore on this podcast\nabout the fact that\nsleep is the foundation\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nAnd I say that because\nwhen we are not\nsleeping well or enough,\nall of those things suffer.\nConversely, when we are sleeping\nwell and we're sleeping enough,\nall of those things improve.\nOne of the key elements to\ngetting a great night's sleep\nis to have the proper mattress.\nHelix mattresses are different\nbecause they are customized\nto your unique sleep needs.\nSo if you go to their website\nand take a brief 2-minute quiz,\nthey will match you\nto a mattress that's\nideal for your sleep needs.\nThe quiz asks questions\nsuch as do you\nsleep on your back, your\nside, or your stomach?\nPerhaps you don't\nknow, that's fine too.\nOr do you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night?\nThings of that sort that\nallow them to match you\nto a mattress that will give\nyou the best possible night's\nsleep.\nI started sleeping on a Helix\nmattress a few years ago\nand it has vastly\nimproved my sleep.\nIf you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\nyou can go to\nhelixsleep.com/huberman to take\nthat 2-minute sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you\nto a customized mattress.\nYou can also get up to $350\noff any mattress order and two\nfree pillows.\nAgain if you're\ninterested, you can go\nto helixsleep.com/hurberman\nfor up to $350 off and two free\npillows.\nLet's talk about tools\nto improve your fitness.\nBefore we do that,\nhowever, I just\nwant to briefly\nremind everybody what\nconstitutes a core or a\nfoundational fitness program.\nNow, what I'm about\nto describe is not\nfor the athlete that's\ntrying to just improve\none aspect of fitness\nor sports performance.\nSo for instance, if\nyou are a powerlifter\nand your main goal is\nto move more weight\non the core\npowerlifting movements,\nor if you are somebody\ntraining for a marathon,\nit's likely that\nyour core fitness\nprogram will differ\nsubstantially from what\nI'm about to describe.\nHowever, the vast\nmajority of you\nare almost certainly\ntrying to have some level\nof cardiovascular fitness.\nSo the ability perhaps\nto run a mile or more,\ncertainly to be able to\nwalk up a flight of stairs\nwithout getting winded,\nyou almost certainly want\nsome degree of\nstrength, the ability\nto perhaps pick up a\nheavy load of groceries\nand carry it in one arm\nas you carry something\nelse in the other arm.\nYou want the ability\nto help move furniture.\nYou want the ability certainly\nto not injure yourself\nwhen performing daily\ntasks, and perhaps\nyou also want to be able\nto go out and play a pickup\ngame of basketball or\nsoccer, or to go out\non a long hike with a family\nwithout feeling so sore\nthat you have to rest\nin bed the next day.\nAn optimal fitness\nprogram of the sort\nthat was covered in the optimal\nfitness protocols episode\nthat I did is therefore one\nthat checks off the major boxes\nthat science tells us are\nimportant for health span\nand for lifespan,\nand that can also\nhelp us improve various\naspects of performance,\nand improve various\naspects of aesthetics,\nwhether it's fat loss or\nmuscle growth, if we choose.\nSo without going into that\nprogram in a lot of detail,\nthe core elements\nof it are that it\nincludes at least 150\nminutes and ideally\nmore like 200 minutes per week\nof so-called zone 2 cardio.\nI'll talk a little\nbit more about zone\n2 cardio a little bit\nlater in the episode.\nBut zone 2 cardio is for,\nthose of you that don't know,\na type of\ncardiovascular exercise\nthat you can do\nwhile maintaining\na conversation\nwithout getting winded\nbut that if you were to\npush a little bit harder,\nthat you would find it hard\nto complete your sentences.\nIn general, zone 2\ncardio is the sort\nthat you can do while purely\nnasal breathing, unless you\nneed to talk, of course,\nit's perfectly fine\nto talk while doing\nzone 2 cardio.\nAnd again the\nscientific research\ntells us that we should all be\ngetting at least 150 minutes\nand probably more like 200\nminutes of zone 2 cardio\nper week.\nNow, in addition to that, a\nfoundational or optimal fitness\nprogram for most people is\ngoing to include anywhere\nfrom 2-4 cardiovascular\ntraining sessions that\nare separate-- that's right--\nseparate from the zone 2\ncardio, as well as 2-4\nresistance or strength\ntraining, sometimes also aimed\nat hypertrophy or muscle growth\ntraining sessions.\nNow, we have to acknowledge\nthat most people are probably\nnot going to hit the upper\nthreshold of all of those three\nthings.\nMost people simply do not have\nthe time and/or discipline\nto get 200 minutes of zone\n2 cardio per week, plus four\nresistance training\nsessions, plus four\ncardiovascular training sessions\nthat are separate from the zone\n2 cardio.\nAs a consequence, the\noptimal fitness program\nthat I described in that\nepisode, and by the way,\nit's the program\nthat I've essentially\nfollowed for the last\n30 years or more,\nincludes three cardiovascular\ntraining sessions.\nSo one of longer duration\nsort of typical endurance type\ntraining.\nThis would be a long, slow\njog or a long hike one\nday per week, as well as a\nshorter cardiovascular training\nsession of about 25 to 30\nminutes moving a bit faster,\ngetting the heart\nrate up a bit more,\nbreathing a little\nbit harder, as well\nas one very short cardiovascular\ntraining session that\nwould fall under the category\nof high-intensity interval\ntraining, things like sprints,\nwhich don't necessarily\nhave to be done running.\nCould be done on a rower.\nIt could be done on\na bike, et cetera.\nSo three cardiovascular\ntraining sessions, as well as\nthree resistance\ntraining sessions.\nI want to acknowledge that\nresistance training can\nbe done with body weight.\nIt can be done with\nweights, with machines.\nI talked about the\ndiffering virtues\nof one approach versus\nanother, but nonetheless,\nthree resistance\ntraining sessions.\nOne focusing specifically\non leg training.\nOne focused specifically\non torso training.\nThat's right, chest,\nshoulders, and back altogether,\nas well as some neck training\nfor important reasons\nthat were mentioned\nin that episode.\nAnd then a third\nsession that was\naimed at somewhat smaller body\nparts, biceps, triceps, calves,\nand some other small body\nparts that tend to be neglected\nand that are important to\ntrain if one wants to encourage\nmuscular balance both\naesthetically and structurally\nto avoid injury and\nhave excellent posture.\nSo those were the core elements\nof that foundational fitness\nprogram.\nAnd I mentioned then\nand I'll mention\nagain now that that\nprogram is not a mandate.\nIt is not an absolute\nrequirement for anyone\nto follow.\nIt was simply meant as a\ntemplate from which people\ncould evaluate their own\nexisting fitness program,\nperhaps modify it\nsomewhat or a lot,\nor if you were interested in\ntrying that specific fitness\nprogram, that you could do that.\nAnd we have provided a link\nboth to that episode in the show\nnote captions, but we've\nalso provided a link\nto a table or chart\nthat describes\nthat foundational\nfitness program.\nIt provides examples of\ndifferent cardiovascular\ntraining and resistance\ntype training sessions.\nAnd it describes some potential\nexercises and the rationale\nfor those exercises,\nand the rationale\nfor selecting particular\nrepetition ranges\nand rest between sets.\nAll of that information is\navailable completely zero cost.\nYou don't even need to\nsign up for anything.\nYou simply go to the link that\nwe provided in the show note\ncaptions, and there's a\ndownloadable PDF there\nfor you to explore.\nNow, in addition\nto the solo episode\nthat I did about optimal\nfitness protocols,\nwe did a six-episode\nguest series\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin, who\nis a professor of physiology\nat Cal State Fullerton\nand a world expert\nin all aspects of exercise\nand muscle physiology.\nThat episode described\na lot of the science,\nand in particular\nscience-backed tools\nfor improving everything\nfrom long-distance endurance\nto anaerobic capacity, strength,\nhypertrophy, speed, power,\nrecovery, nutrition,\nsupplementation, and ways\nto develop a year-long\nprogram that will\nensure you ongoing progress.\nIn that series, Dr.\nAndy Galpin provided\nan enormous amount of valuable\ninformation, such that anyone\nand everyone, meaning\nthe person who's\njust interested in\nstarting a fitness program,\nor improving their\nexisting fitness program,\nor the elite athlete who\nis interested in improving\ntheir sprint times,\nor their jump\nheight, or their powerlifting,\nor their marathon time,\ncould clearly benefit from\nsome or all of the protocols\nthat he described.\nNow, because that series is so\nextensive in terms of its depth\nand breadth, again, providing\nso much value at 0 cost thanks\nto Dr. Andy Galpin's\nexpertise, but at the same time\nbecause it might be a little\nbit intimidating for many people\nout there to try and figure out\nwhich protocols to incorporate\ninto their existing\nfitness regimen,\nI thought it would be fun\nand very beneficial to talk\nabout some of the key\ntools that were described\nthroughout that\nseries that one could\nconsider incorporating into\ntheir existing fitness routine\nnow.\nSo that's what this\nepisode is really about.\nIt's about the tools\nthat I personally\ngleaned from those\ndiscussions and that I\nfound to be of tremendous\nvalue in improving\nboth my cardiovascular\nfitness, my strength\nand hypertrophy\ntraining, my recovery,\nand other aspects of my\noverall fitness protocols.\nAnd when I say\nbeneficial, I mean\nin terms of improving my\ncardiovascular fitness,\nimproving my strength\nand hypertrophy training,\nand that have improved\nthe various metrics\nof fitness lifespan\nand health span which\ninclude things like heart rate\nvariability, resting heart\nrate, blood pressure, VO2 max,\nas well as some of the fitness\nmetrics that were described\nduring that episode series\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,\nsuch as performance\nmetrics, the ability to\njump a certain distance,\nthe ability to run\na certain speed\nor to run a certain\ndistance at a given speed,\nthe ability to move\nweights in good form\nfor a certain number\nof repetitions.\nAgain, all of the metrics\nof performance and health\nare going to vary tremendously\nfrom person to person\ndepending on where\nyou're starting,\nhow long you've been\ntraining, and other aspects\nof your health.\nThe tools described\nin today's episode\nare designed for everybody.\nAgain, these are\nsimple tools that you\ncan put into your existing\nroutine that should really\nmove the needle forward\nin terms of improving\nyour overall levels\nof fitness and health.\nOK, let's talk about the\ntools to improve your fitness.\nThe first tool is to\nmesh your zone 2 cardio\nwith your daily activities.\nSo for those of you\nthat don't know,\nzone 2 cardio is\nthe type of movement\nthat we typically call\ncardio exercise that\nelevates your heart\nrate somewhat,\nincreases your\nbreathing somewhat,\nbut that still allows\nyou to carry out\na conversation without having\nto pause or to gasp in order\nto complete your sentences.\nOK.\nSo that's a general rule\nof thumb for zone 2 cardio.\nNow, for those of you that\nuse a fitness tracker,\nyou can monitor whether or not\nyou are in zone 2 cardio very\nprecisely.\nBut if you're like me and you\ndon't use a fitness tracker,\nit's very easy to know if\nyou're in zone 2 cardio\nbecause again, it's that\nlevel of output that puts you\nright below or somewhat\nbelow the threshold where\nif you were to exert yourself\nwith any more intensity,\nthat you wouldn't be able\nto complete your sentences.\nNow, this could, of\ncourse, be evaluated\nby jogging with someone or\nwalking with someone or hiking\nwith someone and carrying\nout a conversation.\nIf somebody isn't available,\nyou could, of course,\ndo this by trying\nto speak out loud\nand have a conversation\nwith yourself,\nor if you want another way\nto monitor whether or not\nyou're in zone 2 cardio\nwithout having to use a fitness\ntracker, you could simply\nask yourself whether or not\nyou are maintaining a level\nof output that increases\nyour heart rate\nand your breathing\nbut that allows you to\nmaintain purely nasal breathing\nthe entire time.\nAny of those approaches\nwill tell you more or less\nwhether or not you're\nin zone 2 cardio.\nNow, the scientific data\ntell us that we should all\nbe getting anywhere from 150\nminutes to 200 minutes per week\nminimum of zone 2 cardio for\nsake of cardiovascular health,\ncerebrovascular health, and\na number of other aspects\nof health that are important\nessentially to everybody\nfor health span and life span\nNow, many people\nincluding myself, schedule\nzone 2 cardio into their\nweekly fitness regimen.\nSo for me, I have\none day a week.\nFor me it falls\non a Sunday where\nI go out for a jog that lasts\nanywhere from 60 minutes\nto 90 minutes.\nIt's a slow jog.\nI can maintain nasal\nbreathing the entire time\nor have a conversation\nwith somebody else\nor myself the entire\ntime if I like.\nOr sometimes it\nconsists of a hike\nby myself or with other people,\nand sometimes those hikes\nextend anywhere from\nan hour to four hours\ndepending on the\ncircumstances, et cetera.\nI will mention that\nwhenever possible, I try\nand do that once a week zone\n2 cardio session out of doors\nbecause I like being in nature,\nand I like getting sunlight,\nand I like getting fresh air.\nNow, during the discussion\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,\nI explained how I\nget my zone 2 cardio.\nAnd I acknowledged that\nonce-a-week session doesn't\nalways allow me to\nreach that 150-minute\nto 200-minute minimum threshold\nof zone 2 cardio per week.\nSometimes it does,\nsometimes it doesn't.\nAnd his response to that\nwas very reassuring.\nWhat he said was, look, if you\nwant to schedule zone 2 cardio\nand head out for a long\nSunday jog or hike, terrific.\nIf you want to schedule a zone\n2 cardio as two or more sessions\non the treadmill or\non the bike, great.\nBut that he doesn't\nactually think of zone 2\ncardio as exercise at all.\nAnd to that I gasped, and then\nI was a little bit deflated.\nI thought, oh, great.\nI've been doing all\nthis zone 2 cardio,\nand you don't even\nconsider that exercise.\nAnd then what he said\nwas very reassuring,\nand I think it's going to be\nvery reassuring to all of you.\nHe said, first of\nall, zone 2 cardio\nis absolutely critical to our\nhealth for a number of reasons\nthat I already mentioned.\nBut in addition to that, zone\n2 cardio does not impede,\nand in fact, can enhance our\nother aspects of fitness.\nSo for example, our\nstrength training,\nour hypertrophy training,\nor any type of speed work,\nor other types of cardiovascular\ntraining one might do.\nAnd that the best\nway to get zone\n2 cardio is OK, if you want\nto schedule it, schedule it\nas a session.\nBut that to simply increase\nthe amount of walking\nand in particular, walking at\na rapid pace that one does,\nand to increase the\ntotal amount of movement\nthat one's getting\nthroughout the week.\nSo taking groceries in and\nout of the grocery store,\nrunning around with the kids,\ntaking a walk with a coworker\nwhile having a work discussion,\ntaking your calls for work\nwhile pacing in the\noffice or going outside,\nwhat he impressed on me\nis that zone 2 cardio\ncan be meshed throughout\nthe daily activities\nthat I and everybody else\ngenerally have to do.\nAnd this was of great relief\nto me because I as many of you\nare, I'm extremely busy.\nI don't have time to schedule\nin more cardio per week,\nor at least I don't see\nthe way I could do that\nwithout reducing the amount\nof sleep that I'm getting,\nor without reducing the\namount of social connection\nthat I'm getting with family\nand friends, both of which\nare extremely important to\nour mental health and physical\nhealth.\nSo the basic tool\nhere is yes, get\n200 minutes per week\nminimum of zone 2 cardio.\nAnd notice I said 200 minutes,\nnot 150 minutes to 200 minutes.\nI'm going to set\nthe higher threshold\nof 200 minutes per week\nminimum of zone 2 cardio.\nBut that you don't need\nto schedule that as time\non the treadmill.\nIf you want to, great.\nBut what was communicated to\nme from Dr. Andy Galpin is\nthat zone 2 cardio is\nimmensely beneficial,\nit's not going to\nimpede, and in fact, it's\ngoing to improve other\naspects of fitness,\nand that it does not have\nto impede and it in fact\ncan improve other\naspects of our daily life\nlike our ability to engage\nsocially, our ability\nto have a great output at\nwork in whatever type of work\nyou do.\nSo the message is very simple,\nget 200 minutes or more\nof zone 2 cardio per week.\nAnd the message is also\na very reassuring one\nwhich is that zone 2\ncardio can be spread\nthroughout your\ndaily activities,\nand that if you're\ndoing enough of it,\nyou probably don't even have to\ncount the total amount of zone\n2 cardio that you're getting.\nIf you simply make the\neffort to move around\na lot more during\nyour daily activities\nand to mesh that zone 2 cardio\nwith your daily activities,\nyou're going to hit\nthat threshold of 200\nminutes per week minimum.\nNow, that's a great\nmessage for me\nbecause I'm already doing\nthe three resistance training\nworkouts per week.\nI'm doing what now\nI can just call\nthe two other cardiovascular\ntraining workouts per week\nbecause now I don't even count\nthat long Sunday jog or Sunday\nhike as exercise.\nI just consider that movement\nout of doors on the weekend.\nAnd in doing so, it's also\nallowed me to really enjoy\nthat a lot more.\nThere's something about\nconsidering something\na fitness training program that\nshifts it from just recreation\nand enjoying life to training.\nAnd I, of course, love training.\nI love training in the gym, and\nI love training out of doors.\nI love running.\nI love lifting weights.\nI love all sorts of\nphysical training.\nI know many people do, I\nknow many people don't.\nBut if one looks\nat zone 2 cardio\nas just part of\ntheir daily life,\nyou're far more likely to get\nthat zone 2 cardio in and all\nthe benefits that come with it.\nAnd you're also opening up time\nfor work for social engagements\nand to do and pay attention\nto other aspects of fitness,\nwhich is what we're\ngoing to talk about next.\nThe second tool that I've\nincorporated into my fitness\nregimen and that I believe\ncan be of great benefit\nto frankly everybody is to\nstart including low repetition,\npure strength work.\nNow, some of you may already\nbe doing low repetition,\npure strength work.\nBut I believe that\nmost people don't.\nMost people who do\nresistance training\nare using either\nmachines, or free weights,\nor some combination of\nthose, or perhaps they're\nusing body weight.\nAnd they tend to focus on\nrepetition ranges from about 5\nand usually more like\n6 repetitions out\nto about 10 and\nperhaps 15 repetitions.\nNow, of course, doing resistance\ntraining and repetition\nranges of 5-15 reps\nper set, provided\nit's done at\nsufficient intensity,\nso either to failure or\nclose to failure, of course,\nin good form is\ntremendously beneficial.\nIt can help build strength.\nIt can enhance hypertrophy.\nThere is tremendous value to\ntraining in those repetition\nranges.\nBut when I sat down\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin\nto discuss resistance\ntraining, specifically, he\nmade it very clear that\nat least for some portion\nof one's yearly training cycle.\nSo perhaps eight weeks or\n10 weeks, or in the case\nthat I adopted 12 weeks,\nthere is tremendous benefit\nto training in the 3 to 5\nrepetition range and maybe even\nlower.\nSo the second tool of\ntraining specifically\nfor strength in the 3\nto 5 repetition range\nis something that I started to\nincorporate after I sat down\nto record that series.\nAnd I'll just tell you\na few of the benefits\nthat I've experienced,\nand then I'll\ntell you the specific\nprotocol that\nmakes it very easy to do this.\nThe most obvious benefit to me\nwas that I got much stronger.\nAnd that that strength\npersisted such that\nwhen I went back to using\nhigher repetition ranges,\nso typically I train\nwith weights or machines\nin the 6 to 10 repetition range,\nsometimes a little higher,\nsometimes a little lower.\nBut never before\nhad I specifically\ntrained in the 3 to\n5 repetition range\nexclusively for a period\nof 10 to 12 weeks.\nAnd when I did that, I, of\ncourse, gained strength.\nBut that strength\nstayed with me such\nthat when I returned to\nhigher repetition ranges,\nI could use more weight in\ngood form, and that, of course,\nenhanced strength and\nhypertrophy further.\nIn addition, there was another\neffect that was at least to me\nvery unexpected, which was\nthat my cardiovascular training\nimproved significantly.\nNow, why would this be?\nBecause typically a\n3 to 5 repetition set\ndoes not elevate the\nheart rate for long enough\nthat you would consider it\ncardiovascular training.\nAnd of course, the rest\nperiods between those sets\nis pretty long as well.\nSo even if heart rate goes\nup during those heavy sets,\nit's going to go down during\nthose long 3 to 5 minute rest\nperiods between those sets.\nBut what I noticed was that my\noverall posture and my ability\nto maintain\ncardiovascular output\nwhile using good running\nform or good rowing form\nwas also vastly improved.\nAnd the logical interpretation\nof why that would be\nis simply that the\nmuscles got stronger,\nand those same muscles\nare being incorporated\ninto the cardiovascular--\nlet's call it endurance work\nthat I'm doing on other days.\nAnd therefore, I can carry out\nthose cardiovascular training\nsessions in better form\nfor longer periods of time.\nI actually felt much stronger\nduring my cardiovascular\ntraining as I got much stronger\nmoving these heavier weight\nloads for low repetition sets.\nAnd then the third specific\nbenefit that I noticed\nis that when training heavy\nfor 3 to 5 repetitions per set,\nI didn't get sore.\nAnd this to me was\nan incredible benefit\nbecause typically when I\ntrain in the 6 repetition\nto 15 repetition\nrange and I take\nthose sets to failure\nor near failure,\nI do experience some\nsoreness the next day.\nOrdinarily that soreness\nisn't so intense\nthat it prevents\nme from doing any\nof the other sorts of\nworkouts that I do.\nAnd for those of you\nthat have visited\nthat foundational\nfitness protocol,\nyou know that I hit each major\nand minor muscle group once\nper week directly as well\nas once per week indirectly.\nThat's the overall\nstructure of that program\nin order to allow\nsufficient recovery\nbetween those resistance\ntraining workouts\nto be able to make\ncontinual progress.\nNow, by training in this\n3 to 5 repetition range\nthat Dr. Andy\nGalpin suggested, I\nwas able to improve\nmy strength, improve\nmy cardiovascular\noutput, reduce soreness.\nI also just felt better overall.\nI had a lot more energy after\nthose workouts than I typically\ndo after my resistance\ntraining sessions\nwhen I use higher\nrepetition ranges.\nThere are just a number\nof different things\nthat made me feel, wow, this\nis really a powerful protocol.\nAnd of course, moving\nheavier weights in the gym\nfeels good too.\nIt feels good to get stronger.\nAt least there's a positive\nfeedback loop there for me,\nand I think for most people.\nAnd I should also mention\nthat for those of you that\nare averse to doing heavier\nresistance training in the 3\nto 5 repetition range because\nyou fear that it will make you\ntoo big or too bulky, training\nin the low repetition ranges\nis actually more geared\ntowards increasing strength\nand is shifting away somewhat\nfrom increasing hypertrophy\nor muscle size.\nSo that's a great\nbenefit for those of you\nthat want to be\nstrong and also want\nto maintain\ncardiovascular fitness,\nbut you don't want\nto add muscular size.\nAnd of course, for all of you\nthat want to add muscular size,\nit's well established that\nincreasing your strength\nwill allow you then\nto return to patterns\nof hypertrophy\ntraining that will\nallow you to use\nheavier weights,\nand therefore induce\ngreater hypertrophy.\nSo there are oh, so many reasons\nto incorporate these strength\ntraining protocols.\nSo the way that Dr.\nAndy Galpin suggested\none do it and was the\nway that I did it is he\nused this 3 by 5 protocol.\nThe 3 by 5 protocol is\nvery straightforward.\nIt involves doing three to\nfive exercises per workout.\nOK.\nSo if it's a workout for legs,\nit's three to five exercises.\nIf it's a workout for\nsome upper body muscle,\nit's three to five exercises.\nThree to five exercises for\n3 to 5 sets per exercise,\n3 to 5 repetitions per\nset, and 3 to 5 minutes\nof rest between each set.\nIn addition, he\nemphasized that one\ncan do those workouts three\nto five times per week.\nAlthough, I'm going\nto put an asterisk\nnext to that last statement\nbecause I found that I couldn't\ndo the 3 by 5\nprotocol say for legs\nspecifically three to\nfive times per week.\nI realize that might be\npossible for some people,\nbut I'm somebody who like\nmany of you out there,\neither doesn't have the time\nor doesn't have the recovery\ncapacity to train my legs\nthree to five times per week.\nEven though I acknowledge\nthat there are probably\nways to do that would\nstill allow me to recover,\nit just simply starts to impede\ninto other areas of training.\nIt starts to impede other areas\nof life like work and family\nand sleep and all the rest.\nSo what I did and what\nI'm suggesting you try\nis for any existing resistance\ntraining that you're doing,\nto take a period of 8 or\n10 or ideally 12 weeks\nand do the vast majority, if not\nall of that resistance training\nin the lower repetition range\nthat's designed specifically\nto induce strength adaptations.\nAnd to not pay attention\nto whether or not\nyou're hitting that same muscle\ngroup three to five times\nper week, rather if you\ntrain your legs once or twice\nper week, to simply do all\nof the work for your legs\nin that 3 to 5 repetition range.\nIf you train an upper body\nmuscle or muscle groups,\nchest, shoulders, back\nonce per week or twice\nper week to just stay\nwithin that 3 to 5\nrepetition range\nfor those work sets.\nWarm-ups can include\na few more reps.\nAnd then to adhere\nto this three to five\nexercises, 3 to 5\nsets per exercise,\n3 to 5 repetitions per set, and\n3 to 5 minutes between sets.\nNow, the one exception to\nthis that I incorporated\nwas that for very\nsmall muscle groups.\nSo for instance, the rear\ndeltoids or for neck work,\nor for calf work to not rely\npurely on 3 to 5 repetitions\nbut maybe to work in\na range of anywhere\nfrom 5 to 8 repetitions.\nSo still fairly low\nrepetitions but not so low\nthat it restricts you\nto 3 to 5 repetitions.\nThe reason for that is that I\nand I think a lot of people out\nthere find it hard to\nfatigue those smaller muscle\ngroups adequately with good\nform when restricting oneself\nto those low repetitions.\nHowever, for big\ncompound movements\nlike presses and squats and\ndeadlifts and glute ham raises\nand things of that sort, maybe\neven leg extensions and leg\ncurls, which are isolation\nexercises, of course, to really\nrestrict oneself to those\n3 to 5 repetition ranges\nthat take you to\nfailure or near failure.\nI listed off the benefits of\ndoing that that I experienced,\nand I'm confident\nthat you will also\nexperience a lot of benefits.\nSo just to remind you what\nsome of those benefits are,\nyou get stronger,\nwhich feels great.\nThat occurs within\nyour weight workouts,\nbut it also carries over to your\nendurance training sessions.\nI also noticed\nthat when returning\nto higher repetitions\nfor resistance training,\nso after 12 weeks shifting away\nfrom 3 to 5 repetition ranges\nand going back to training\nin the 6 to 10 repetition\nranges mainly.\nOccasionally up to 12 or 15\nbut really mainly restricting\nto 6 to 10 repetitions that you\ncan move much heavier weights\nin good form, and thereby\ninduce more hypertrophy\nwhile still also continuing\nto gain some strength.\nAnd another benefit was\nagain reduced soreness\ncompared to when training\nwith higher repetition\nranges and more\nmental freshness,\nI guess the only\nway to describe it,\nwhen training in those\nlower repetition ranges.\nI don't know about\nyou, but when I\nfinish a really hard\nhour-long resistance training\nsession done in the 6\nto 12 repetition range,\nthere's a certain\ntype of mental fatigue\nthat even if I eat\nproperly afterwards,\neven if I hydrate\nproperly, that it\ntends to sap a bit of my\nmental energy later in the day.\nBut that the training at\nthe 3 to 5 repetition range\ndid just the opposite.\nIt actually enhanced my\nfocus and my cognition,\nmy overall levels\nof physical energy,\nwhich is great\nbecause it allows you\nto do all the other\nthings that we're required\nto do throughout the day.\nAnd by the way,\nit will also allow\nyou to get more of\nthat zone 2 cardio.\nSo if you want more details\non the 3 by 5 protocol,\nagain, that's time stamped\nin the relevant episode\non strength and hypertrophy that\nwe did with Dr. Andy Galpin.\nI'll also provide a link to that\nspecific time stamp in the show\nnote caption to this episode.\nI do want to point out that\nyou don't just jump right\ninto heavy sets of\n3 to 5 repetitions,\nyou need to warm up adequately.\nFor some people that warm-up\nwill be higher repetition sets,\nso say 10 to 12 repetitions\nwith just the empty bar\nor a lightweight.\nAnd then adding a\nlittle bit of weight\nand doing 8 repetitions\nand maybe 6 repetitions,\nand then your work\nsets as they're\ncalled of 3 to 5 repetitions.\nOr perhaps you're\nlike me and you\nprefer to do low\nrepetition warm-ups.\nSo this was also something\nthat I discussed with Dr. Andy\nGalpin and that for me has made\na tremendous positive impact\non all my resistance training,\nregardless of whether or not\nit is low repetition\nor high repetition.\nAnd that's to do a brief\nwarm set that is somewhere\nin the range of 6\nto 8 repetitions,\nvery light just to get\nfamiliar with the movement.\nThen to do a second\nwarm-up set that\nincludes some load on the bar or\nthe free weight or the machine.\nAnd then a second warm-up set--\nagain, this could be\nfree weights or machines\nthat incorporates\na bit more load\nbut still keeps the repetitions\nlow so in the 4 to 6\nrepetition range.\nAnd then maybe,\nespecially if it's\nat the beginning of the workout\nand my core body temperature\nisn't elevated yet,\nI'll do a third warm-up.\nBut that third warm up\nwhich, of course, is\ngoing to be progressively\na little bit heavier\nthan the first or\nsecond warm-up,\nis still going to fall within\nthe low repetition range\nso just 2 to 4 repetitions.\nFor me, including a\nfew more warm-up sets\nwith progressively heavier\nweight on each warm\nup but still keeping the\ntotal repetition count\nlow, so somewhere in the\nrange of 2 to 6 repetitions,\nhas been very beneficial\nfor improving my work\noutput during the so-called\nwork sets regardless of\nwhether or not I'm training\nin the 3 to 5 repetition range\nor whether or not I'm\ntraining in the 6 to 15\nrepetition range.\nI know for some people, this\nmight be kind of surprising,\nhow is it that my work sets\nare actually higher repetition\nthan my warm-up sets?\nOr put differently,\nhow and why is it\nthat my warm-up sets are lower\nrepetition than my work sets?\nAnd that's because I fall\ninto this category of people\nthat tends to fatigue\npretty quickly when\ndoing resistance training.\nSo for me, keeping\nthe repetition count\non any individual\nwarm up set pretty low\nhas allowed me to really\nimprove my strength output\nand really improve my\nstrength and hypertrophy\ntraining when I shift to\nthe so-called work sets.\nSo I already listed off a\nnumber of important documented\nbenefits and benefits\nthat I've certainly\nexperienced by incorporating\nlow repetition,\npure strength work into\nmy yearly training cycle\nfor periods of 8 to 12 weeks.\nIn addition to that, during\nmy conversation with Dr. Andy\nGalpin, he said\nsomething very important\nfor everyone to\nhear and understand.\nHe said, when you look at the\ndata on aging and performance,\nin particular\nmuscular performance,\nyou see some very interesting\npatterns within the data.\nHe said for instance, that\nfor every year after age 40,\nthere's a 1% drop in\nmuscle size that can be\noffset by resistance training.\nBut that if you don't\ndo resistance training,\nthat you won't offset.\nAnd during that\nseries, we also talked\nabout the minimum\nrequirement for 6\nand probably more\nlike 10 working sets\nper muscle group per week in\norder to at least maintain\nmuscle size, not just age\n40 and beyond but even\nat younger ages.\nOK.\nSo that's muscle size.\n1% decrease per year unless\nyou do the right thing.\nAnd the right thing is get 6\nto 10 working sets per week\nin order to offset\nthat decrease.\nAnd if you train\nproperly for hypertrophy,\nyes, you can still increase\nmuscle size past age 40.\nIn addition, he said\nthat there is a 3% to 5%\nreduction per year for every\nyear past age 40 in strength\nand power.\nNow, that's a very\nimportant metric\nbecause what it's telling us is\nthat the drop off in strength\nand power is significantly\ngreater per each year\nafter age 40 than is the\ndecrease in muscle size,\ntelling us that we\nhave to do something\nto offset that decrease\nin strength and power.\nIn addition, he mentioned that\nfor every year past age 40,\nthere is an 8% to 10% decrease\nin speed and in explosiveness.\nAnd so if one is interested\nin maintaining speed\nof muscular movement\nand explosiveness\nof muscular movement,\nsomething that's perhaps\nimportant to a number\nof you, one also\nhas to incorporate training\nspecifically geared\ntoward maintaining or improving\nspeed and explosiveness.\nNow, I like many people am\nnot so interested in speed\nand explosiveness, I know\nthey have their utility,\nbut I am interested in\nmaintaining muscle size\nover the course of my life,\nperhaps even adding some muscle\nto a particular muscle groups.\nI'm also very interested in at\nleast maintaining and ideally\neven gaining some strength\nin certain muscle groups\nthroughout my entire lifespan.\nAnd that's not just for\nperformance reasons.\nThat's also because we know\nthat maintaining or improving\nstrength of our muscles\nis very important\nacross the entire\nlifespan but especially\nin the years spanning\nfrom 40 until death,\nwhich I think for most people\nfalls somewhere between 50,\n60, 70, or ideally, out into\nthe 80s and 90s or 100, right?\nThat's what we're all seeking is\nto die later in better health.\nAnd in order to do that, we have\nto dedicate some very specific\ntraining protocols in order\nto maintain or build strength.\nSo to summarize, in addition to\nall the positive reasons to do\ndedicated strength\ntraining that I mentioned\nbefore, it's highly recommended\nthat you do some dedicated\nstrength training for the\npurposes of offsetting\nthe age-related decline in\nstrength that occurs again\n3% to 5% per year\npast age 40, which is\na pretty significant decline.\nBut the good news is\nif you do the 3 to 5\nprotocol for say\n12 weeks per year,\nand then you continue\nto resistance train\nusing other repetition ranges\ngeared towards hypertrophy\nand strength or perhaps\neven muscular endurance,\nthe good news is you'll\nmaintain your strength\nand perhaps even\nbuild your strength,\noffsetting that natural decrease\nthat would otherwise occur.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors,\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens now called AG1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day\nis that it gets\nme the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nand Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains\na number of adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met, and it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to try\nAthletic Greens you can go\nto athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you five free\ntravel packs that make it really\neasy to mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3K2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D3K2.\nThe next tool I'm\nabout to describe\nrelates to your\ncardiovascular training,\nand it's a tool that\ncan greatly improve\nyour cardiovascular fitness\nwith a limited amount of time\ncommitment.\nBut that is not\nto say it is easy.\nWhat I'm referring to is\nthe so-called Sugarcane.\nIf you listened to the\nseries with Dr. Andy Galpin,\nyou may recall our discussion\nabout the Sugarcane,\nwhich is so named after our\nfriend and expert trainer Kenny\nKane.\nAnd it is a very efficient\nyet somewhat brutal\nway to increase your\ncardiovascular output.\nSo the Sugarcane is\nthe type of protocol\nthat you would incorporate\nonce in the period of a week\nbut certainly not every week.\nIt's the kind of thing that you\nmight throw in once every two\nweeks or once every four\nweeks as a replacement\nfor your other high\nintensity interval training.\nThe Sugarcane involves\nselecting some form of exercise\nthat you can do at\nhigh intensity safely.\nThat, of course, will\ndiffer between individuals.\nFor some of you it will\nbe a stationary bike.\nFor others of you, it\nwill be a road bike.\nFor others of you,\nit will be running.\nAnd for others of you,\nit will be rowing.\nThe exact form of\nexercise is not important.\nWhat is important\nis that you can\ngenerate a lot of intensity.\nSo you're going to be doing some\nsprint like work, although not\nall out sprints except\non the final round.\nI'll explain where all\nthis is going in a moment.\nBut again, you need\nto select a movement\nthat you can do without injuring\nyourself while still performing\na movement at high intensity.\nSo for me that would\nbe running, for you\nit might be something else.\nThe Sugarcane is pretty\nstraightforward in structure.\nIt involves three rounds after\na brief warm-up, of course.\nSo you're going to do 3\nto 5 minutes of jogging\nor jumping jacks\nor skipping rope,\nsomething to get your\ncore body temperature\nup so that you're prepared to\ndo the high-intensity work.\nAnd then there are only three\nrounds of high-intensity work.\nAnd they go as the\nfollowing, in round 1,\nyou're going to take\n2 minutes-- so you'll\nneed to set a timer\nfor 2 minutes--\nand you're going to go the\nmaximum distance that you\ncan in that 2 minutes.\nSo run the maximum distance that\nyou can for 2 minutes, or cycle\nthe maximum distance that\nyou can for 2 minutes,\nor VersaClimber the\nmaximum distance\nthat you can for 2 minutes.\nWhatever you\nselect, you're going\nto do that as far and\nas fast as you can\nfor the duration of 2 minutes.\nSo depending on the\nmovement and depending\non your level of\nfitness, that distance\nmight be 400m, 600m,\n800m, et cetera.\nWhatever distance you\ntravel in that 2 minutes,\nyou are going to mark that\ndistance down in your mind,\nor in your phone, or\non a piece of paper.\nAnd then you're going\nto rest 2 minutes.\nSo 2 minutes of work\nthen rest 2 minutes.\nThen in round 2, you're going\nto go the same distance that you\ndid in round 1, and you're\ngoing to take as much time\nas you need to do that\ndistance as fast as you can.\nSo if you went 600m in 2\nminutes for round 1, in round 2\nyou're going to\ngo 600m, and it's\ngoing to take you however\nlong it takes you.\nChances are if you really did\nthe best you could in round 1,\nyou were at maximum output\nfor the first 2 minutes,\nthat in round 2 it's\ngoing to take you\nlonger than 2 minutes to travel\nthat equivalent distance.\nHowever, there is\nthe possibility\nthat it will take you less time.\nBut for most people, it's\ngoing to take you more time.\nSo staying with this example of\n600m in 2 minutes on round 1,\nin round 2, you're\ngoing to go 600m,\nlet's say it takes\nyou 2 minutes and 30s.\nYou then are going to mark\ndown how long round 2 took you.\nSo in this case, the example\nis 2 minutes and 30s.\nThen you're going to\nrest another 2 minutes.\nAnd then in round\n3, you're going\nto go all out again\nas fast and as safely\nas you can for the same duration\nthat you did in round 2.\nAnd your goal is to go at least\nas far as you went in round 1.\nAnd if there's still\ntime left, you're\ngoing to continue to go all out\nagain as fast as you safely can\nuntil the entire\nduration is completed.\nSo it's really just three\nrounds with two rest periods\nin between round 1 and round 3.\nAnd then I highly recommend\nthat after round 3,\nthat you do some sort\nof dedicated cooldown.\nSo instead of just flopping\non to the bench or the floor\nor the lawn, that you walk\naround slowly until you\nrecover your breathing.\nThe reason I like the\nsugarcane as a tool\nthat one implements once\nevery say two to four weeks\nas a replacement for one's\ntypical high-intensity interval\ntraining is several fold.\nFirst of all, if you\nprovide the right intensity\nin round 1 and\nround 2 and round 3,\nit is sure to elevate your\nheart rate substantially,\nand in doing so,\nimprove your VO2 max,\nwhich is correlated with all\nsorts of important metrics\nrelated to health span,\nperformance, and life span.\nSecond of all, it gamifies\nthings a little bit.\nIt pits you against\nyourself in the sense\nthat if you go out at\nmaximum speed, again,\nperforming a movement\nthat you can safely\nperform at maximum speed\nin round 1, well, then\nyou have something to compete\nagainst in round 2 and round 3.\nAnd that makes the\nhigh-intensity interval\ntraining, first of\nall, very intense,\nbut also it makes\nit fun in a way that\nlets you forget just how\npainful the whole thing is.\nThe next tool to\nimprove your fitness\nis called exercise\nsnacks and as the name\nsuggests this is a fun one\nand was suggested by Dr. Andy\nGalpin as a way to either\nenhance or maintain\nyour fitness depending on\nhow your core or foundational\nfitness program is going.\nSo when I say core I\ndon't mean your abs.\nI mean whether or not you're\ngetting your regular cardio\nand your regular\nresistance training\nif you were to add one or\nseveral of these exercise\nsnacks per week.\nIt can further improve\nthings like VO2 max,\nmuscular endurance, et cetera.\nI'll talk about\nthe specific snacks\nthat you will be\ndoing in a moment.\nHowever, as Dr. Andy\nGalpin also pointed out,\nthere are times in\nwhich we happen to not\nbe following our foundational\nfitness program either\nbecause work demands or family\ndemands or we're traveling.\nWe're simply not keeping\nup with our basic routine.\nAnd under those\nconditions, exercise snacks\nare a terrific way to maintain\nthe fitness that you've already\nbuilt and developed, and you\ndon't lose any ground in a week\nsay where you get\nparticularly busy.\nNow, exercise snacks can take\non a variety of different forms.\nBut for sake of\nsimplicity and clarity,\ntoday we're going to divide\nthem into two major categories.\nThe first category\nare exercise snacks\nthat are going to\nimprove or maintain\nyour cardiovascular fitness,\nso your ability to run\nor cycle or row some distance\nsay 12 minutes or longer.\nBut keep in mind these exercise\nsnacks are very, very brief.\nThey don't require that you do\nthem for 12 minutes or longer.\nWhat they are going to do is\neither maintain or enhance\nthe type of\nendurance that allows\nyou to continue in an activity\nfor 12 minutes or longer.\nThe second category\nof exercise snack\nrelates to muscular endurance.\nMuscular endurance is a very\nimportant aspect of fitness.\nAnd even though some\npeople are already\ntraining for muscular\nendurance, it's\nsomething that most people are\nnot doing enough training for.\nMuscular endurance\nis your ability\nsay to maintain a wall set\nor to maintain a plank,\nor to do the maximum\nnumber of push-ups\nthat you can do in one session.\nThe sort of drop to the floor\nand give me as many push-ups\nas you possibly can type of\nthing, or as many sit-ups\nas you can type of thing.\nMuscular endurance\ntranslates to a number\nof other aspects of\nfitness, and it's something\nthat we should\nall be working on.\nAnd again, many people just\ndon't make space for it\nin their regular routine.\nSo now we have these two\ncategories of exercise snacks.\nOne geared toward\nenhancing or maintaining\nyour cardiovascular\nfitness as it translates\nto longer duration endurance\nactivities, so 12 minutes\nor longer.\nAnd then the other category\nis purely muscular endurance,\nwhich is essentially some\nbout of exercise that's\ngoing to be fairly\nbrief, anywhere\nfrom a minute to 2 minutes but\ncertainly less than 12 minutes.\nOK, so let me give you\nan example of an exercise\nsnack for enhancing your\nlong-duration endurance,\n12 minutes or longer.\nAnd this is the sort\nof thing that if you\nare going to incorporate\ninto your routine,\nand I highly\nrecommend that you do,\ncan essentially be done\nany time with no warm-up.\nA good example of an\nexercise snack of this type\nwould be to suddenly\nstand up from your desk\nand to do 100 jumping jacks.\nNow, depending on\nhow fit you are\nand how fast you do\nthose jumping jacks\nand how wide and tall you\ndo those jumping jacks,\nmeaning are you doing\nthese little things where\nyour hands don't actually meet\nand your hands like parting\nyour legs just a\nlittle bit, or are you\ndoing full jumping jacks\nwhere you're really\njumping and setting\nyour feet out\nas wide as you\ncomfortably and safely can\nand then bring your\nhands together,\nit could take you anywhere\nfrom 30 seconds to 90 seconds.\nOK.\nSo in the case of\njumping jacks, you\nmay end up doing\nthis for 90 seconds.\nBut the point is to simply\ndo 100 jumping jacks.\nOr if that takes too\nlong, you could even\ndo just 25 or 50 jumping jacks.\nThe point is that it's going\nto get you moving your muscles.\nIt's going to get\nyour heart rate up.\nEven if you're very, very fit if\nyou're doing these fast enough\nand you're doing them\nwith proper form,\nit's going to get\nyour heart rate up.\nAnd then you're done.\nYou can sit back\ndown to your desk\nor you can continue to\nwalk through the airport.\nYes, I've done these\nin the airport.\nTypically not while walking\ntoward my gate but at the gate.\nBut occasionally I'm\nfeeling lethargic,\nor I haven't had the\nopportunity to train that day,\nand perhaps I won't get\nthe opportunity to train,\nso I'll do something\nlike 100 jumping jacks\nwhile facing the\nwindow so it feels\na little less awkward facing\npeople while you're doing them.\nAnd of course, you don't\nhave to do jumping jacks.\nAnd equally effective\ntype of exercise snack\nis to find a stairwell\nand to simply\ngo up that stairwell\nas fast as you safely\ncan for 20 to 30 seconds.\nSo perhaps just find the\nbottom of a stairwell\nand go up that stairwell\nas quickly as you can.\nAnd perhaps go down\nas quickly as you can.\nAnd just keep doing that\nfor about 20 to 40 seconds,\nand then you're\nessentially done.\nOK.\nYou could also opt to\npick some distance away\nfrom your car in\nthe parking lot,\nassuming you're not carrying\nany heavy bags or anything,\nand simply run to your car.\nSo 20 to 30 seconds of not\nnecessarily all out sprinting.\nYou don't want to\ninjure yourself.\nBecause again, this is\ndone without a warm-up.\nThese exercise\nsnacks are designed\nto be inserted into your\nday and into your week\nessentially at random.\nYou could plan them if you want.\nBut any time you feel inspired,\nor perhaps any time you're\nfeeling like you\ndon't want to do one,\nyou could simply do one\nof these exercise snacks.\nAnd of course, doing jumping\njacks, or running to your car,\nor taking the stairs\nvery quickly up and down,\nor just up and\nthen walking down,\nfor instance, and doing a\nfew jumping jacks, things\nof that sort, of course,\ncan take on a near infinite\nnumber of different variations.\nSo if you don't like\nany of the variations\nthat I just presented,\nyou can easily\ncome up with something else.\nAgain, the purpose of\nthese exercise snacks\nis to get your heart rate up.\nIt's of course, to do this\nwhile not getting injured,\nand it is entirely compatible\nwith an existing exercise\nprogram.\nIt in no way is going to impede\nyour performance in strength\nor hypertrophy or other\nforms of long-form endurance\nor high-intensity\ninterval training, quite\nto the contrary.\nEverything we know about\nthese exercise snacks\nis that they enhance various\naspects of your physiology\nin ways that promote\nboth recovery\nand performance in your\nother types of exercise\nand your other types\nof athletic endeavors.\nSo no reason to think\nthat they are going to be\nproblematic for your training.\nBut of course, don't\ntrip, don't fall,\ndon't undertake a\nmovement that puts you\ninto a range of motion that has\nhurting your back, your knee,\nor any other part of your body.\nStart off slowly\nand find something\nthat really works for you.\nSo these are very easy.\nThey take very little time.\nThey're fun to be honest.\nAnd as was discussed in the\nconversation with Dr. Andy\nGalpin, they're\nalso very effective.\nThe second category\nof exercise snack\nare the exercise snacks that\nenhance muscular endurance.\nSo muscular endurance\nis the type of endurance\nthat allows you to\nmaintain a fixed position\nfor some period of time usually\nsomewhere between 1 and 3\nminutes.\nBut these endurance\nbouts are never\ngoing to last 12 or\nmore minutes, unless you\nare exceptionally\nevolved in terms\nof your muscular\nendurance abilities.\nWhat I'm talking about here\nare things like planks,\nwall sits, maximum number of\npush-ups, things of that sort.\nAnd this is an aspect\nof fitness that\ntranslates to other\naspects of fitness\nin a very important way.\nAnd again, this was covered\nin the exercise series\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin.\nI don't want to go\ninto any of the details\nnow because it was\nall covered there.\nIt's very easy to look up\nbecause it's time stamped.\nBut just being brief,\nmuscular endurance\nallows the buildup of more\nmicrovascular supply to muscles\nand connective\ntissue in a way that\nallows delivery and removal\nof more nutrients and waste\nproducts.\nNow, I realize to the physios\nthings like nutrients and waste\nproducts is far too\nbroad a category,\nbut what we're\ntalking about here\nis the ability to deliver\nmore fuel and oxygen\nand to remove waste\nproducts of muscular effort,\nor to be more specific,\nneuromuscular effort.\nThis is a great\nthing because it can\nhelp you enhance your\nstrength training,\nenhance your\nhypertrophy training,\nenhance your long-distance\nendurance and your middle\ndistance and even your\nshort distance endurance.\nAnd these exercise snacks for\nbuilding muscular endurance\nare exceedingly easy to do.\nAnd you can even do them\nwhile talking on the phone,\nespecially if you're\nusing headphones,\nor if you have your\nphone on speaker.\nA good example of an exercise\nsnack for muscular endurance\nwould be a 30 to 60-second\nor perhaps longer wall sit.\nSo remember wall sits?\nWall sits are as\nthe name suggests\nwhere you put your feet out\nsome distance from a wall.\nYou squat down into\na seated position,\nbut there's no chair\nthere, and then\nyou maintain that\nseated position,\nand that is harder\nto do over time.\nYou could lean back against\nthe wall a little bit\nharder if you wanted to\ngain some extra support\nand continue.\nBut the idea here\nis that you're going\nto go not necessarily\nto muscular failure\nbut to the point where you\ncan't continue to sit in\nthat wall sit position.\nYou could also simply do\nthis as an air squat down\nto the bottom position\nwhere you're comfortable.\nAnd then you don't want\nto rest down there,\nand you want to maintain some\ntension in your quadriceps\nand other muscles\nof your lower body\nso that you're actively\ntrying to support yourself\nin the seated position but\nwithout a seat below you.\nThat can be done again while\non a speakerphone conversation,\nthat can be done at\nrandom throughout the day.\nYou can just decide, OK, I'm\ngoing to do a wall sit now,\nand I'm going to time myself.\nI'm going to see how\nlong I can do this for.\nOr you could decide\nto do a plank.\nI've done this while\non a phone call.\nSorry if it was that\nI was talking to,\nbut I've put the\nphone on speaker\nand just gotten into\na plank position,\nand then I'll just have the\nconversation in the plank\nposition.\nI don't fight to maintain that\nplank position past the point\nwhere I could continue\nto have a conversation.\nSo again, this is\na type of exercise\nthat one is trying\nto incorporate\ninto their daily routine.\nIf you wanted to dedicate\na specific amount of time\njust to doing these\nexercise snacks, you could.\nBut it's far more\nreasonable to assume\nthat people will incorporate\nthese into their daily routine\nmore regularly if\nyou can incorporate\nit truly into the other\naspects your routine like work.\nYou do this while watching\nTV, or listening to a podcast.\nOne form of muscular\nendurance exercise snack\nthat's really terrific and is a\nbit of a challenge, that's fun\nis to just simply see how\nmany push-ups you can do.\nAnd we talked about proper\npush-up form during the episode\nseries with Dr. Andy Galpin, but\nhere what we're talking about\nis chest all the\nway to the ground\nso it touches the ground, then\npushing up until your arms are\ncompletely straight.\nThat's one push-up.\nAnd then continuing in\npiston-like fashion,\nmeaning you're not\npausing at the top\nand taking a bunch of breaths.\nYou're not going into a\nplank position in other words\nbut continuing to\ndo as many push-ups\nas you can to see\nwhether or not you can\nenhance that number over time.\nAnd in any case, just\nto simply get your body\nworking to engage the muscles\nof your chest, your shoulders,\nyour triceps, and your\ncore, et cetera, and to\ndo that every once in a while.\nSo instead of needing somebody\nto say drop and give me 20,\njust see whether or not\nat some point, any point\nthroughout the day, you can\nget into a push-up position\nand do your maximum\nnumber of push-ups,\nand then just mentally note\nthat number to yourself.\nAgain, these exercise\nsnacks serve multiple roles.\nThey're designed\nto get you moving,\nto get your heart rate\ngoing, to maintain or enhance\nyour fitness in other\ndomains of fitness.\nAnd this is very important\nto not take too much time out\nof your schedule.\nIn fact, like zone\n2 cardio, right,\nbeing the type of\nmovement that you're just\ngoing to do a lot throughout\nthe week carrying groceries,\net cetera, as we\ndiscussed earlier,\nthese exercise\nsnacks are designed\nto be incorporated\ninto your daily life.\nAnd I must say that\nhaving started doing these\nafter recording the series\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,\nI've noticed two things.\nFirst of all, including\nthese exercise\nsnacks at least once a week and\nmore like three to five times\na week for me, so that's\none exercise snack\ndone three to five times\nper week has definitely\ncorrelated with\nimprovements in my fitness\nin other domains of fitness,\nstrength, hypertrophy,\nlong-distance\nendurance, et cetera.\nNow, I've changed a\nnumber of other things\nas well as a consequence of that\nseries with Dr. Andy Galpin.\nSo I can't say for sure that\nit's the exercise snacks per se\nthat are causing all\nthose positive shifts.\nI have to imagine that it's\nnot just the exercise snacks,\nbut they've become an\nimportant part of my routine\nand that relates to\nthe second point, which\nis that the exercise snacks\nare to be fun and easy.\nAnd so I really enjoy\nthem, so much so\nthat if I don't one\nfor couple of days,\nI start to crave\nthem a little bit\nlike the other kind of snack.\nThe next category of tool\nto improve your fitness\nrelates to breathing\nor respiration.\nNow breathing and respiration\nis an enormous topic\nin and of itself.\nIn fact, I did an entire episode\non breathing and respiration,\nand this is a topic that my\nlaboratory works on extensively\nas it relates to anxiety\ncontrol and some other aspects\nof mental health, as well\nas to physical performance.\nFor today's discussion, I want\nto just review a few tools\nthat one can incorporate\nboth into workouts\nand around workouts\nthat can greatly\nenhance fitness and recovery.\nThe first one is the\ntype of respiration tool\nthat you use between\nsets of exercise.\nAnd again here we're talking\nabout resistance training,\nbut we could just\nas easily be talking\nabout rest between rounds of\nsay high-intensity interval\ntraining.\nSo for instance, between\nbouts of sprinting\non the track or the bike or\nthe treadmill or the rower.\nA great pattern of breathing\nto incorporate during rest\nbetween sets is\nsomething that I've\ntalked about before in\nother contexts which\nis the physiological side.\nThe physiological side is a\ndeep Inhale through the nose\nto maximally or near\nmaximally inflate your lungs,\nand then a second\nvery brief inhale,\nand it's necessarily brief\nbecause your lungs are already\npretty full, to maximally\ninflate your lungs\nand to make sure that\nany of the little sacs\nor the little\nalveoli of your lungs\nthat have collapsed during\nthe exercise exertion\nwill reinflate.\nAnd then a long exhale\nuntil lungs empty.\nSo I'll demonstrate it right now\nas I've done many times before.\nBut if you haven't seen\nit or heard it before,\nit's two inhales followed\nby an extended exhale.\nAnd it goes like this.\n[INHALE, EXHALE]\nYou'll notice that the\ninhales were through the nose\nand the exhale was\nthrough the mouth.\nThat's the ideal way to do\nit for a number of reasons.\nCheck out the episode that I\ndid on respiration physiology\na.k.a. breathing if you want\nmore details on why that is.\nBut two inhales through the\nnose and a long extended exhale\nthrough the mouth, the so-called\nphysiological side not named\nby me but rather named by\nphysiologists in the 1930\nis as far as we know,\nthe fastest way to shift\nyour nervous system from\nso-called sympathetic drive\nto more parasympathetic\ndrive, from a state\nof greater alertness to\na state of greater calm.\nNow, the reason to do this\nbetween sets of resistance\ntraining is that the more\nthat you can shift yourself\nfrom sympathetic drive to\nparasympathetic drive, that\nis from alert to calm in\nbetween sets, the more energy\nand focus you can devote to\nexertion during your work sets.\nSo one way to do this that's\nvery convenient and very\neffective is to consider\nthe last repetition\nof your set, a physiological\nsigh, which is not\nto say, OK, I want\nto be very clear,\nwhich is not to\nsay that you should\ndo the physiological\nside during your set.\nIn fact, I recommend\nthat you do not do that.\nBut rather if you're doing\nsix repetitions of a given\nexercise and you, let's\nsay, fail on the sixth\nor you do that sixth repetition\nand you're just close\nto failure because again your\nwork set should be to failure\nor close to it most of the\ntime, then set down the weight,\nand then you're going to\ndo the next repetition\nas the physiological\nsigh, meaning you're not\ngoing to do the movement.\nYou're going to think of\ndoing a physiological sigh\nas the last repetition\nof every set,\nnot during the last repetition\nof the resistance training\nmovement, OK.\nSo the physiological\nsigh is something\nyou do at the beginning\nof the rest period\nimmediately following a set.\nIf you'd rather think\nabout it that way\nbecause it's more\nconvenient than thinking\nabout it as the last rep\nof a set, be my guest.\nWhatever works for you.\nBut what you'll quickly\nfind is that if you\ndo a physiological sigh\nright after completing\nyour last repetition, you'll\ncalm down much more quickly,\nyour heart rate will\ncome down more quickly,\nand you'll recover more\ncompletely in whatever\ndesignated rest period\nyou've allowed yourself,\nwhether or not it's\n30 seconds, which\nwould be very short frankly, or\nit's a 5-minute period of rest\nbetween sets.\nIf you do one truly, just\none physiological sigh\nat the beginning\nof the rest period,\nyou are going to effectively\nshift your nervous system\nin the direction you want it to\ngo during those rest periods.\nAnd of course, if you're\ntraining hard during your work\nsets you run zero\nrisk whatsoever\nof feeling so calm\nthat you don't feel\nmotivated to do your next set.\nI promise you that it will\nallow you to relax more\nat the beginning\nof the rest period\nthan you ordinarily would, to\nshift into a state of rest.\nThere are differing opinions\nabout whether or not\nyou should walk around or stay\nstill during your rest periods.\nI like to walk around a\nbit and stay standing.\nI'm not one of these\npeople that collapses\ninto a C-shape on the\nbench in between sets.\nI like to stand up and breathe\nnormally and walk around, drink\na little water, et cetera.\nIn any case, doing\na physiological side\nthe beginning of\neach rest interval\nbetween work sets of\nresistance training\nis a very effective\nway to enhance\nyour focus and your output\nduring your work sets.\nNow, the last respiration\ntool to improve your fitness\nis again a tool gleaned from\nthe discussion with Dr. Andy\nGalpin, and that's\nto include a 3 to 5\nminute period at the end\nof every single workout.\nSo it doesn't matter if\nit's high-intensity interval\ntraining, or it's\nresistance training,\nor it's a long run of some sort,\nat the end of every workout,\nto take 3 to 5 minutes, so\nyou'll want to set a timer,\nand to do some form of\nparasympathetic, that\nis calming promoting\nbreathing in order\nto shift your nervous system\nfrom a state of heightened\nalertness and output\ninto a state of recovery.\nBecause as you all\nwell know by now,\nyou get fitter not\nduring your workouts\nbut rather after your\nworkouts, in between workouts.\nSo you stimulate the\nadaptation during a workout,\nbut you get the adaptation,\nyou get the actual improvement\nin between workouts.\nAnd a common mistake that\nmany people make, and I\nmade this mistake for years,\nwas to finish a great workout,\nand then you're\ntexting on your phone,\nor you're talking on the\nphone, or you're driving home.\nIt's certainly not as intense as\nthe workout that you just did.\nMaybe you're even feeling really\ncalm from a nice long jog,\nor you had a particularly\ngood workout that day\nand you're feeling really happy.\nSo you're enjoying the\nhigh, so to speak, well,\nwhen you do 3 to 5 minutes\nof what's often called down\nregulation breathing\nafter a workout,\nit allows you to\nrecover and to induce\nthe adaptation that\nyou've been after, the one\nthat you actually trained\nfor much more quickly.\nI can't tell you\nhow many people I\nknow who start to incorporate\nthis into their workouts,\nfind that they recover far\nbetter from their workouts,\nwhich might seem a\nlittle bit surprising.\nWhy would it be that just 3\nto 5 minutes of some activity\nwould enhance recovery\nto such a great degree?\nAnd that's because\ntypically people\ndon't bookend their workouts.\nThey finish their workouts,\nand of course, they're\nnot continuing to\nlift weights or run.\nBut they move about\ntheir day in their life\neven if it's preparing a meal in\na way that the level of stress,\nand therefore, stress\nhormones, things like cortisol,\nadrenaline, things\nthat by the way\nare excellent to elevate\nduring a workout, things\nlike inflammatory\nmarkers, which by the way,\nare great to enhance\nduring a workout.\nThat actually happens\nduring a workout.\nYou have a massive increase\nin inflammatory markers, which\nmight seem bad, but\nall of those things\nare enhancing the adaptation\nthat you're seeking.\nBut as soon as\nthose workouts end,\nyou want to shift\ninto recovery mode.\nAnd this 3 to 5 minutes of\ndown regulation breathing\nis a terrific way to do that.\nThere are a couple of\ndifferent patterns of breathing\nthat will work best, but all\nof them emphasize exhales.\nOK.\nI want to repeat that, all\nof them emphasize exhales.\nSo for instance, you\ncould just choose\nslow, deliberate breathing.\nHow does that emphasize exhales?\nWell, ordinarily when we\nbreathe, we inhale actively\nand we exhale passively.\nWhenever we deliberately\nbreathe more slowly,\nwe are actively exhaling.\nOK, so active exhales really\npromote the calming response\nin brain and body.\nThe other thing you could do\nwhich many people are now doing\nis to do a repeated round\nof physiological sighs.\nSo the double inhale\nthrough the nose,\nlong exhale through the mouth\nbut repeated for say 3 minutes.\nThat's another version.\nThe other thing you could do is\nsimply to notice your exhales\nand to emphasize your exhales,\nmake them longer and more\nvigorous than your inhales.\nNow, you don't want to turn this\ninto a breathwork session where\nyou're--\n[INHALE,EXHALE]\n--you're doing it Pranayama\nor Kundalini breathing\nor something of that sort.\nThe idea is to calm down.\nSo any time you're\nextending your exhales,\nyou're actively\nexhaling, you're trying\nto slow your breathing\ndown overall,\nyou're going to shift yourself\nin the right direction.\nSo rather than complicate\nthis type of tool,\nthe best thing you can do is\njust focus on those exhales,\nslow your breathing overall,\nuse physiological sighs\nif you want, or simply\nsit in your vehicle,\nor if you have to\ndrive home while doing\nthis extended exhale\ntype of down regulation.\nIdeally you would take\na couple of minutes\nand just shift your whole\nsystem by not driving, closing\nyour eyes and just sitting in\nyour car stationary, of course,\ndon't drive with your eyes\nclosed, or bike with your eyes\nclosed.\nJust simply calm down,\nextend your exhales\nand shift from the\nworkout to the recovery\nmode, which is where the\nprogress is going to arrive.\nI'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge our sponsor\nInsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you meet\nyour health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that\nimpact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nHowever, with a lot of\nblood tests out there,\nyou get information back about\nblood lipids, about hormones,\nand so on, but you\ndon't know what\nto do with that information.\nWith InsideTracker they\nhave a personalized platform\nthat makes it very easy to\nunderstand your data, that\nis to understand\nwhat those lipids,\nwhat those hormone\nlevels, et cetera\nmean and behavioral supplement,\nnutrition and other protocols\nto adjust those\nnumbers to bring them\ninto the ranges that are\nideal for your immediate and\nlong-term health.\nInsideTracker's ultimate\nplan now includes measures\nof both ApoB and\nof insulin, which\nare key indicators of\ncardiovascular health\nand energy regulation.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can visit\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any

your\nfocus during your workout\nand separating or\nsegmenting your workouts\nfrom the other\nparts of your day.\nNow, of course,\nworkouts are naturally\nsegmented from the\nother parts of your day,\nunless you're running\naround all day long,\nor you're lifting weights or\nother heavy objects all day\nlong.\nBut one of the more\nattractive tools\nthat was presented during\nthe series with Dr. Galpin\nthat I adopted and found\nto be really effective\nis this concept of the line.\nThe line is this concept that\nyou have a physical location,\nsay at the entrance to a gym\nor at the start of your run\nor your bike or maybe it's\naround the stationary exercise\ndevice that you use for which\nonce you cross that line,\nyou are all about business.\nOK.\nYou're not socializing\nor at least not too much.\nYou don't want to\nbe rude to people,\nbut you're really\nfocused on your workout.\nSo this is especially\neffective on days\nwhen you're a little\nbit distracted,\nor you didn't sleep that\nwell the night before,\nor maybe you've got something\ngoing on in your mind,\nor you're in an\nargument, or you're\nexcited about something else.\nBut if you care about\nyour fitness, which\nI hope everyone does, and\nyour goal during any workout\nis to stimulate\na particular type\nof physiological adaptation\nstrength, hypertrophy,\nlong-distance\nendurance, et cetera,\nand you also don't want to\nget injured so that you can\ncontinue to train\nfor your entire life\nas regularly as possible,\nthe concept of the line\nis fantastic\nbecause what it does\nis it forces you\nto compartmentalize\nthe portion of your lesson\nthat comes before the workout\nand after the workout and also\nto really enjoy your workouts.\nThis is something that's\nnot often discussed,\nbut nowadays with the\nadvent of smartphones,\nthere's a lot of infiltration\nof other types of communication\nand information while one is\nsupposed to be exercising.\nAnd so our life has become\nfar less compartmentalized\nthan it used to be before\nthe advent of smartphones.\nNow, of course,\nsmartphones are wonderful.\nThey provide all sorts of\nwonderful tools and benefits,\nand of course, I use one.\nAnd I'll talk about\nhow to incorporate\nthe smartphone in\na very specific way\nto enhance your workouts\nin just a moment.\nBut the idea of a line\nis you pick a location.\nIt can change with each\nworkout, but ideally it\nwould be at the threshold of\nwhere the physical location\nto the workout begins.\nAnd once you cross that\nline, you are all business.\nYou are taking care of business.\nWhich is not to say that you\ncan't enjoy your workouts.\nIn fact, you absolutely should.\nOne of the best pieces of advice\nthat I ever got about fitness\nwas given to me when\nI was a teenager\nand I started lifting weights.\nAnd the person who was teaching\nme how to do that said,\none of the best\nthings that you can do\nand you absolutely should do\nfor your fitness now and forever\nis to learn to\nenjoy training hard.\nAnd that really stuck with me.\nI really do enjoy\ntraining hard, but that\nwas something that I\nlearned how to do over time.\nI took on the mentality\nthat I'm here by choice,\nI'm here for my own\ngood and my own fitness\nto enhance my life so I'm\ngoing to enjoy training hard,\nI'm going to enjoy\ntraining effectively.\nAnd of course, there are days\nwhen I train a little less hard\nor I back off quite a bit.\nI even take rest\nperiods of a week\nevery once in a while,\nevery say 12 to 16 weeks\nI'll take a week off and just\ndo some activities like hiking\nand things of that sort.\nI talk to all about\nextended layoffs,\nmeaning a layoff of more than\ntwo days during the episode\nthat I did by myself, which is\nthe Optimal Fitness protocols\nepisode.\nBut in any case, learning to\ntrain hard and enjoy training\nhard and really making\nthe workout something that\nis separate from the\nrest of your life\nis one of the most\ngratifying things\nthat you can do to enhance\nyour overall fitness because it\nreally teaches you\nhow to designate\nyour mind and your body toward\nthis one specific set of goals\nwhile you are there\nand to really enjoy\nthe process because\nfitness can be a truly\nenjoyable process even when\nyou are exerting yourself,\nespecially hard.\nAnd for you\nmasochists out there,\nit can be, especially\nbecause you're training hard\nthat it feels so good.\nIn any event, the key is to\nset some sort of boundary\nand know that when you\ncross into that boundary,\nyou're training.\nAnd when you cross\nout of that boundary,\nyou're done training,\nwhich also lends itself\nto more adequate recovery\nand the decompression type\nbreathing exercises that\nwe talked about before.\nI'm not going to tell\nyou whether or not\nyou need to do the\ndown regulation\nbreathing at the end of\nyour workout within the line\nor after you cross the line.\nThat's up to you.\nI don't think one needs\nto get that specific.\nNow, another tool that's\nwonderfully effective\nnot just for your workouts\nbut for all areas of your life\nis if you are going to bring\na smartphone to your workouts,\nto set some boundaries\naround what you're\ngoing to listen to and\ndo with that smartphone\nduring your workouts.\nI see people texting.\nI see people doing selfies.\nI see people having phone calls.\nI see people, I presume,\nlistening to music or podcasts.\nLook, I am not the smartphone\npolice nor are you,\nand everyone has a right to\nuse their smartphone in the way\nthat they choose\nas best for them\nin order to distract\nthemselves or focus themselves\nor enrich their life.\nLook, it's a free world,\nof course, more for some\nthan for others,\nbut you can do what\nyou want with your smartphone.\nHowever, if your goal is\nto improve your fitness,\none of the more powerful things\nyou can do with your smartphone\nis to decide before you cross\nthe line into your workout what\nyou're going to listen to or\ndo with that phone or not.\nSo for me, I like to\ndesignate a playlist of music\nfor that particular\nworkout, and then\nI just stick to that playlist.\nI might repeat songs\nthat I like a lot,\nor if someone talks to me\nwhile the music is playing,\nI might go back and restart\na song if they distracted me,\nthat sort of thing.\nAlthough, I do my best to not\nget into too much social chit\nchat during workouts,\nbut I'm friendly,\nand it's nice when people\ncome over and say hello.\nI sometimes work out with\nother people in which case\nI don't use headphones,\nI don't use a smartphone.\nBut setting a playlist or two,\ndesignating a podcast or two,\ndesignating an audiobook\nor two, whatever\nit is that you're going to\nlisten to really decide what\nthat's going to be before\nyou do your workout.\nAnd the reason I say this is\nthat I observe a lot of people,\nand frankly, I've observed\nmyself under conditions where\nI'm suddenly in a\ntext communication,\nor I'm bouncing between\nalbums or between podcasts\nor between whatever it is\non the phone to the point\nwhere rest intervals aren't\nbeing controlled well,\nto the point where\nfocus during sets\nbecomes harder to achieve\nat the beginning of a set\nbecause in between sets I was\nfocused on a conversation not\non training.\nI'm a big believer in\nmaking your exercise fun,\nmaking it accessible,\nmeaning not so\nexpensive or\ngeographically difficult\nto achieve that you don't do it\nor that it starts to interfere\nwith other areas of life.\nThis is really important.\nYou want fitness to be blended\nwith the rest of your life,\nbut you don't want it so blended\nwith the rest of your life\nthat the rest of your life\nstarts to impede your efforts.\nOr and this happens quite\noften for a lot of people\nthat workouts start to\ntake an hour and a half,\ntwo hours when they could easily\nbe completed in 45 minutes\nto an hour if you were just\nmore efficient with your time.\nAnd of course, you don't\nneed me to tell you this,\nbut smartphones can be one of\nthe major bleeds on our focus\nand efficiency.\nIn fact, it can cause\nyou to hemorrhage\nfocus and efficiency.\nSo what I'm\nsuggesting here is not\nthrowing away your smartphone,\nalthough, some people\ndo benefit from just\nleaving it in the car\nor at home when\nthey are training.\nBut rather to designate\npodcasts, books, music\nplaylists for that\nparticular workout\nand to just stick to those for\nthe duration of your workout.\nAnd once you cross\ninto the line,\nthat's what you're listening\nto and only that or nothing.\nAnd of course, once you\ncross back over the line\nas you finish your\nworkout, you can\ndecide to continue to\nlisten to the podcast,\nor continue to listen to the\naudiobook, or to the music.\nThat's up to you.\nAlthough, I highly\nrecommend that you do\nincorporate that\ndownregulation period\nof 3 to 5 minutes minimum.\nThe last category of tools\nto improve your fitness\ncome from the discussions about\nnutrition and supplementation\nand recovery in the series\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin.\nNow, the list of tools\nI'm about to describe\nis not exhaustive,\nmeaning it doesn't even\nbegin to come close to\nthe total number of tools\nthat one could glean from the\ndiscussion about nutrition\nand supplementation\nthat I had with Dr. Andy\nGalpin on this podcast, but\nthey are the major ones that\nare definitely worth knowing.\nAnd those include supplementing\nwith omega 3 fatty acids.\nNow, omega 3 fatty acids\nare found of course\nin foods, things like\nfatty fish and krill,\nof all things, certain\nforms of algae, et cetera.\nBut most people do not get\nenough of so-called EPA form\nof omega 3s.\nAnd for that reason, I\nand many other people\nchoose to supplement with\na minimum of 1 gram per day\nand in some cases as\nhigh as 2 grams per day\nof omega 3s in supplement form.\nSo typically one would\nget to 1 to 2 grams\nof EPA by supplementing\ntheir nutrition, their diet,\nthat is, with fish oil\ncapsules or liquid fish oil.\nThere are many different\nsources of these.\nThat was discussed\nin an episode that I\ndid with Dr. Rhonda Patrick.\nI find that it's\nmost cost efficient\nto get that 1 to 2 grams of\nEPAs from liquid fish oil\ndespite what you might\nsee on the internet.\nI don't have any\nrelationship whatsoever\nto a liquid fish oil company.\nYou just want to make sure that\nyou go with a reputable brand.\nI like the ones\nthat are flavored\nwith lemon so that it offsets\nthe taste of fish oil,\nand I'll take a tablespoon\nor two of that per day.\nAnd if I'm traveling\nand even if I'm not\nI will often use\nfish oil capsules,\nand there are a variety of\ndifferent sources of those\nas well.\nGetting sufficient\namounts of omega 3\nhas been shown to be\nimportant for mood.\nSo as a way to offset\ndepression but also\nfor enhancing overall\nmood that probably\nrelates to the omega 3s\neffect on neurotransmission,\nnot just for neuromodulators\nlike serotonin and dopamine\nbut for all neurotransmission.\nAnd neurotransmission,\nof course,\nis essential for\nneuromuscular performance.\nAnd the omega 3s\nhave been implicated\nin reducing the\ninflammation response,\ncardiovascular\nhealth, et cetera.\nI realized that there is\nsome debate about omega 3s,\nbut when I look at the bulk of\nliterature about the omega 3s,\nit's very clear\nto me that getting\n1 to 2 grams of EPA\nform of omega 3 per day\nis the right thing for me to do.\nAnd many others\nfind that as well.\nThe second tool to\nenhance your fitness\nunder this category of\nnutrition and supplementation\nis creatine.\nNow, again, creatine is not\njust found in supplement form.\nIt's also found, of course, in\nfoods, in particular red meat.\nHowever, the amount\nof red meat that one\nwould have to eat in order\nto get the amount of creatine\nthat one would start to see\na real performance enhancing\neffect is just far too high.\nYou'd be ingesting far too much\nof other things in red meat\nthat you wouldn't\nwant that much of.\nAnd for that reason, I\nand many other people\nwill take creatine daily.\nWe now know there's no need\nto so-called load creatinine\nin the old days as it were.\nSo old days, by the way,\nmeaning mid '90s and 2000s,\nwe were all told that\nwe had to load creatine,\nwe had to take high-dose\ncreatine for four or five days\nand then you could back\noff to a maintenance dose.\nNow it's very clear you can just\ntake a daily dose of creatine.\nAnd that it really\ndoesn't matter\nwhen you take that creatine.\nYou can take it post-workout\nas many people do.\nYou can take it preworkout.\nIt really doesn't\nseem to matter.\nI happen to take it postworkout\njust as a matter of habit.\nBut again, you can take\nit any time of day.\nNow, the point I want\nto make about creatine\nis one that's a bit different\nthan the other discussions\nout there.\nI have no issue\nwith the majority\nof what's discussed\nabout creatine out there,\nfor instance, that\ncreatine monohydrate\nis the most effective form.\nFortunately,\ncreatine monohydrate\nis also the least\nexpensive form of creatine\nthat's sold out there.\nI see no evidence whatsoever\nthat the other forms\nof creatine are superior\nto creatine monohydrate.\nBut what you'll usually\nhear is that taking\n5 grams of creatine monohydrate\nper day is ideal for everybody.\nAnd that advice is\nsimply not well-informed\nby the scientific literature.\nIf you are a larger person,\nso for instance I weigh 100kg\nso that's about 220\npounds, well, it\nturns out if you look\nat the literature\non creatine and\nathletic performance,\nand if you look\nat the literature\non creatine and\ncognitive performance,\nbecause as some of\nyou already know,\ncreatine is a fuel or the\nphosphocreatine system\nis a fuel system for\nthe brain as well.\nAnd if you look at the\nstudies on creatine,\nthey almost always gauge\nthe amount of creatine\nto give an individual\nbased on their body weight.\nSo you don't have to get\nreally specific about this,\nbut if you weigh, say,\n185 pounds to 250 pounds,\nyou can get away with\nand probably should\nbe taking 10 grams or\nso of creatine per day,\nwhich is what I do.\nWhereas if you weigh less\nthan that, 5 grams or maybe\neven 3 grams is sufficient.\nNow, I discussed this with Dr.\nAndy Galpin during that series,\nand one of the things\nthat I've started\nto do since the\nclosure of that series\nis to take more\ncreatine per day.\nSo now I'm taking\n10, sometimes even\nas much as 15 grams\nper day of creatine.\nAgain, this is powdered\ncreatine monohydrate.\nMy stomach tolerates\nit very well,\nbut frankly, I don't\ntend to get stomach aches\nor gastric distress from\npretty much anything,\nunless it's some form\nof food poisoning, which\nis exceedingly rare for me.\nSo some people out there\nfind that creatine really\ndisrupts their gut, and they\nneed to take it with food\nor they really need\nto slowly and increase\nthe amount of creatine that\nthey're taking each day.\nI find that I can put 10\neven 15 grams of creatine\ninto a whey protein\nshake or into some water\nwith a little bit\nof lemon juice,\njust to make it taste a little\nless chalky, drink that,\nand I don't have any\ngastric distress from that.\nSo you'll need to find\nwhat works for you.\nBut the point here is if\nyou're going to take creatine,\nyou don't just want\nto quote unquote,\n\"take creatine one\nscoop per day.\"\nYou really want to adjust\nthe amount of creatine\nthat you're ingesting\naccording to your body weight.\nAnd I would give you a very\nspecific formula of x grams\nof creatine per kilogram\nor pound of body weight,\nbut believe it or not, no\nsuch specific recommendation\nhas ever been published in\nthe scientific literature\nor at least I couldn't find\nit in a way that's consistent\nwith all the other\npapers, meaning\nyou see a lot of variation.\nSo what I'm talking about here\nis if you weigh 185 pounds\nor so, OK, plus or minus 5\npounds out to about 250 pounds,\n10 to 15g of creatine\nper day is probably\nmore appropriate for\nyou than is 5 grams,\nmeaning it's going to be\nmore effective for enhancing\nphysical performance.\nAnd perhaps again, perhaps even\ncognitive performance as well.\nAnd if you're somebody\nwho weighs 180 pounds down\nto say 130 pounds, 5\ngrams of creatine per day\nis probably sufficient.\nThe point here is if you\nare taking creatine, again,\nnot everyone has\nto take creatine.\nThere's no law that says that\nyou have to take creatine.\nSome people don't like it.\nI know some people\nfear it's going\nto make their hair fall out.\nWe already talked about\nthat in previous episodes\nand the lack of data\nto support that idea.\nBut I realize some\npeople steer away\nfrom creatine for\nwhatever reason.\nBut if you decide that taking\ncreatine is right for you,\nadjust the total\namount of creatine\nthat you take according\nto your body weight.\nThe next supplementation based\ntool for enhancing your fitness\nis a Rhodiola rosea.\nNow, this very esoteric\nsounding supplement\nis one that I learned about,\nboth from Dr. Lane Norton when\nhe was a guest on this\npodcast, expert in nutrition\nand frankly training as it\nrelates to resistance training,\nand from Dr. Andy Galpin.\nRhodiola rosea is\na supplement that's\ngaining increasing attention\nbecause it is what's\ncalled a cortisol modulator.\nIt does not necessarily\nsuppress cortisol.\nIt does not increase cortisol.\nIt's a cortisol modulator.\nAnd frankly, the\nmechanism by which\nRhodiola rosea\nmodulates cortisol\nis still under investigation.\nI hope to do an episode\nabout it in the future\nor at least make it\npart of an episode\nbecause the hypothesized\nmechanism that's\nstarting to emerge is really\ninteresting as it relates\nto neurons in the brain that\ncontrol the stress response\nand glands in the body\nlike the adrenals that\ncontrol the stress response\nand that secrete cortisol.\nRegardless, there's a\ngrowing body of research\nthat has explored Rhodiola\nrosea supplementation and one's\nsubjective perception\nof fatigue or output\nduring high-intensity\ntraining of various kinds,\nboth resistance training as well\nas running and endurance type\ntraining.\nSo I started taking Rhodiola\nrosea about six months ago\nin response to conversations\nthat I had again with Dr. Lane\nNorton and with Dr.\nAndy Galpin, and it's\na supplement that I take\nbefore high-intensity workouts.\nSo I don't take it before a\nrun because frankly my runs are\neither very long\nand slow, or they're\nvery brief like a high-intensity\ninterval training session.\nAnd I find those to be\npretty easy to recover from\neven though they\nare very intense.\nI might take a Rhodiola\nrosea supplement\nbefore doing a 30-minute\nhill run that's very intense.\nBut typically, I only take\nit about 10 to 15 minutes\nbefore any sort of\nhigh-intensity resistance\ntraining session,\nin particular my leg\nday which falls on day 2\nof my exercise protocol,\nor the torso day, or the\nsmall body parts day.\nAgain, here I'm\nreferencing the way\nthat I train across the week,\nand you can find that training\nprotocol as a downloadable\ncompletely zero-cost\nif you like.\nBut I realize other people\nare using different body\npart splits and different\ncombinations of resistance\ntraining and endurance training.\nThe reason I mentioned\nRhodiola rosea in this episode\nis that I realized that while\nsome people might not yet\nbe supplementing omega 3s,\nthey might not be supplementing\ncreatine, there are many\nof you who are already\ndoing those things, and you're\nlooking for additional tools\nto give you an edge.\nSo again, the Rhodiola\nrosea would not\nfall into the category of\nfoundational supplements.\nCertainly, get your nutrition\nright, get your sleep right,\nget your sunlight.\nAll the basics first\nplease before even\nthinking about any supplements.\nHowever, once you get into\nthe category of supplements\nthat can enhance\nfitness, Rhodiola rosea\ndoes seem to have\nsome good research\nto support it in\nthe context of lots\nof different forms of\nhigh-intensity exercise.\nNow, I can't tell you whether\nor not it's purely subjective\nor whether or not it's\nobjective and subjective,\nbut my experience has been\nthat when I take Rhodiola rosea\nI definitely notice\nthat I can exert myself\nharder without feeling\nlike I'm bringing myself\nto the brink of fatigue\neither during the exertion\nor afterwards.\nIn other words,\nI feel like I can\ndo more work without\nfeeling so exhausted,\nand I feel as if I'm\nrecovering from my workouts\nmore quickly, in\nparticular across the day\nafter my workouts.\nIn fact, if I had to cite one\nspecific subjective effect\nthat I've experienced\nfrom taking Rhodiola rosea\nbefore very high-intensity\nworkouts is that prior\nto taking it, I would\noften find that 3 or 4\nhours after the\nworkout having eaten\na good meal, taking a shower,\net cetera, and I was tired.\nI'd have a real dip in energy.\nBut now I notice that\nI have a lot of energy\nthroughout the day even after\nthese very high-intensity\nsessions in the early\npart of the day.\nAnd frankly, I haven't\nchanged anything else\nabout my supplementation\nor my nutrition, at least\nnothing major.\nSo I personally am\ngoing to continue\nto take Rhodiola rosea before\nthese high-intensity workouts.\nSo for me, that's about two\nor three times per week.\nHowever, if I forgot\nto take Rhodiola rosea\nbefore a workout,\nI have no reason\nto think that workout\nwould go much worse.\nThis is a supplement that is\ndesigned to give you an edge\nto be able to exert\nmore focus and intensity\nduring your workouts with\nless perceived exertion\nand to enhance your recovery.\nThe typical dosage\nof Rhodiola rosea\nthat you'll find\nin most supplements\nis 100 to 200 milligrams.\nAnd of course, any time you're\ngoing to take a new supplement,\nyou would be wise to figure\nout the lowest effective dose\nfrom that supplement.\nThat's just logic, right?\nWhy spend more money\ntaking more of something\nthat you don't need more\nof if you could get away\nwith taking less of it,\nand it's just as effective\nmaybe even more effective?\nSo I typically will take\n100 to 200 milligrams\nof Rhodiola rosea about 10 to\n20 minutes before a workout.\nHowever, I've taken as\nlittle as 100 milligrams\non a consistent basis, and\nfrankly, I don't really\nexperience much difference\nwhether I take 100mg\nor I take 200 milligrams\nbefore a workout,\nso lately I've just defaulted\nto taking 100 milligrams\nof Rhodiola rosea before\nany high-intensity workout.\nNow, the final tool\nthat I want to review\nfor improving your fitness comes\nfrom the category of nutrition.\nI've done lots of\nepisodes about nutrition\nalready on this podcast.\nWe've done episodes about\nintermittent fasting\nI did a long interview\nepisode with Dr. Lane Norton\nwhere we discussed all the\nins and outs of nutrition\nas it relates to fat\nloss, muscle gain, fitness\nin general,\nlifestyle in general.\nSo check out that episode where\nyou will learn his philosophy\non nutrition, which frankly\nis the one that I largely\nsubscribe to.\nAnd of course, obeys the laws\nof thermodynamics, calories\nin, calories out being\nfundamentally important.\nBut also gets into all sorts\nof details about which sources\nof protein are most\neffective and bioavailable,\nhow much protein you can\nincorporate into your muscles\nafter training, et\ncetera, all of that\nis included in that episode.\nWith that said, the series on\nexercise with Dr. Andy Galpin\nalso included an\nepisode on nutrition.\nAnd while having the\ndiscussion for that episode\nand then listening to\nthat episode again,\nI realized that while certainly\nI've gotten a number of things\nright about my nutrition\nacross the years,\nthere are a few areas where\nI could probably do better\nwithout much effort in\nways that could really\nenhance my fitness.\nAnd the thing that\nI'm referring to\nis that for me my first\nmeal of the day laying\nsomewhere around 11:00\nAM maybe 12:00 noon.\nSometimes I'll eat\nan earlier breakfast,\nbut most typically I hydrate,\ncaffeinate, and train in\nthe morning, and then I eat\nsome time around 11:00 or 12:00.\nAnd then I eat my\nlast meal of the day\nsometime around 8:30 or 9:00.\nAnd as some of you already know,\nI tend to organize my meals,\nsuch that meals during\nthe early part of the day\ntend to lean more toward protein\nand fibrous carbohydrates,\nso things like meat and salad,\nor chicken and salad, fish\nand salad, and maybe a\nlittle bit of starch.\nAnd the meals that I\neat later in the day\ntend to be more starch focused\nand more vegetable focused\nor things like pasta, rice,\net cetera, later in the day\nbecause it helps me sleep.\nAnd the architecture\nof all that is really\nabout energy and focus.\nI find I can focus a bit\nbetter and I have more energy\nthroughout the day when I have\nmy first meal at around 11:00\nor 12:00, and I keep the\ntotal amount of carbohydrates\nthat I ingest during\nthe day moderate.\nNot low but moderate.\nNow, there is an\nexception to that,\nwhich is if I do a\nhigh-intensity resistance\ntraining session\nearly in the morning\nsay train legs or train torso\nor even small body parts early\nin the morning, then I make\nsure to incorporate more starchy\ncarbohydrates and some\nfruit, some simple sugars\nas well into the\nfirst meal of the day\nso that I can\nreplenish the glycogen\nthat I depleted during those\nhigh-intensity resistance\ntraining sessions.\nHowever, after talking\nto Dr. Andy Galpin,\nI realized that I really\nshouldn't worry about or be\nafraid of eating\nsomething before training\nif I'm really hungry\nin the morning.\nSo what I'm\nreferring to here are\nthe times in which I wake\nup and I want to train,\nbut I personally like to\ntrain fasted and caffeinated.\nOK.\nYes, I do recommend that people\ndelay their caffeine intake\n90 to 120 minutes after\nwaking if and only\nif you have trouble\nwith an afternoon\ncrash, real fatigue\nin the afternoon, then\nit makes sense to\ndelay your caffeine 90\nto 120 minutes after waking.\nHowever, the\nexception to that is\nthat if I'm going to\ntrain early in the day,\nI do ingest water to hydrate\nas well as electrolytes\nand caffeine prior to training.\nAnd sometimes that means\nI'm drinking caffeine\nwithin 30 minutes or\n60 minutes of waking.\nI've tried to be clear about\nthis in previous episodes,\nbut I think a number\nof people have\ncome to think that I\nalways delay my caffeine\nintake 90 to 120\nminutes after waking,\nand that's simply not the case.\nIf I'm going to train,\nin particular if I'm\ngoing to do\nhigh-intensity resistance\ntraining or a long run, I will\ningest caffeine sooner than\n90 to 120 minutes after waking.\nAnd in addition to\nthat, yes, I tend\nto eat my first meal around\n11:00 AM maybe 12:00 noon.\nBut if I wake up\nand I'm very hungry,\nI will eat a small meal\nthat includes typically\nsome protein and some fat,\nso some Brazil nuts, maybe\na couple of scoops\nof whey protein\nwould be typical for\nme, or maybe even\na little bit of oatmeal,\nsome whey protein,\nnot a lot of food in my gut.\nBut after talking to\nDr. Andy Galpin, what\nI learned was for some people\ntraining fasted feels best.\nI would consider myself\none of those people.\nYou may be somebody in\nthat category as well,\nor you might be\nsomebody who really\nfeels as if you run\nbest, you resistance\ntrain best when you've eaten say\n90 minutes or a couple of hours\nbefore you do that.\nThere are basically\nno specific rules\nas it relates to whether or not\nyou train fasted or train fed\nexcept in what you can handle\nin terms of gastric distress.\nSo you want to make food\nchoices according to that\nand try and avoid, of\ncourse, gastric distress.\nBut basically the change that\nI've made is if I wake up\nand I'm hungry, I'll\neat a small meal,\nor if I want to work\nout in the afternoon\nor I have to work\nout in the afternoon\nand I have lunch at say,\n12:00 or 12:30 or 11:00 AM\nand the only opportunity\nthat I have to train\nis 1:00 PM or even 12:30,\nI will go ahead and train.\nAnd that's a new thing for me.\nTypically, I try\nto keep my meals\nat least three to four hours\nprior to any training bout.\nAnd of course, if you're\nsleeping all night,\nyou're not eating, and then if\nyou wake up and you don't eat\nand you train in the\nmorning, that's certainly\nlonger than three or four\nhours unless you're sleeping\nvery, very little frankly.\nSo essentially what I'm\nsaying is figure out\nwhat works best for you.\nDo you prefer to\ntrain fasted or fed?\nFor some of you, you might\nprefer fasted before cardio\nand fed before\nresistance training.\nFor some of you, it might\nbe fasted is always best.\nAgain, I put myself\nin that category.\nFor some of you, it might\nbe fed is always best.\nAgain, this is\nhighly individual.\nAnd that's another point\nthat I'm trying to make here,\nwhich is Dr. Galpin really\nimpressed upon me that there\nis no hard and fast rule\nabout training fasted or fed.\nAnd, this is the second point,\nthat having some flexibility\nin whether or not you\ncan train fasted or fed\nallows you to incorporate\nyour fitness training\nsessions more readily\ninto a shifting schedule.\nAnd that's a really\noverarching theme of everything\nwe've been discussing\ntoday, which is yes,\nit's wonderful and important\nto have a core fitness\nprogram, something that\nyou're really striving\nto do each and every week.\nAnd for me, that's three\nsessions of cardio,\nthree resistance\ntraining sessions,\nand a day where I'm doing\nthermal stress training, which\nis just fancy language for\ndeliberate cold and deliberate\nheat exposure.\nHowever, real life happens,\ntravel, work, illness,\nfamily, all those\nsorts of things\nthat can impinge on\nan exercise schedule\nand make it less likely that one\nwould complete their workouts.\nSo today we've been\ndiscussing tools\nto improve your fitness which\nare brief, easy to incorporate,\nscientifically\nsupported, and that\nare shown to improve the various\nsorts of exercise adaptations\nand recovery that will\nallow you to get the most\nprogress from your schedule.\nSo while the tools\nthat we discussed today\nrelate to breathing,\nthey relate to nutrition,\nthey relate to\nsupplementation, they\nrelate to specific set and\nrep patterns and cadences\nand rest periods,\net cetera, all of\nthose specific recommendations\nare within a larger container\nthat I hope has become clear,\nwhich is the best tools\nto improve your fitness are\nthe tools that are, of course,\nare going to be\neffective in improving\nyour cardiovascular and strength\nand hypertrophy training,\net cetera, whatever it\nis that your goals are,\nbut also tools that are going to\nmake it easier and more likely\nthat you are going to engage\nin your fitness program\nwith enthusiasm, with\neffort, and with focus.\nAnd as with any episode\nof this podcast,\nI covered a lot of\ninformation, and there\nare a lot of different tools\nthat one could incorporate.\nBy no means do you need\nto incorporate them all.\nAlthough, if you choose\nto, that's wonderful.\nJust even incorporating\none or two of them,\nsay incorporating this notion\nof the line and the exercise\nsnacks, or adjusting\nyour level of flexibility\nas to whether or not you train\nfasted or fed and the line,\nor trying a 12-week cycle of\npurely training for strength\nwhen you do your\nresistance training.\nBut whether or not you pick\none tool or all the tools\nor somewhere in\nbetween, the key thing\nis to actually implement them.\nAnd I like to think that\nduring today's discussion\nprovided a number\nof tools, again,\nlargely gleaned from the episode\nseries with Dr. Andy Galpin.\nAnd again, if you\nhaven't seen that series,\nthat's linked in the\nshow note captions.\nThose episodes are long.\nThere are six of them, but they\nare a wealth of information\nof every aspect of fitness.\nDuring today's episode,\nwe're really just talking\nabout the things\nthat you can and I\ndo believe should bring to your\nexisting fitness program that\ncan really make a\npositive
