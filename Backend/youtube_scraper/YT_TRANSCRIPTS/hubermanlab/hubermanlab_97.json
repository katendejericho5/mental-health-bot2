    "video_title": "Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg: How to Improve Your Eye Health & Offset Vision Loss",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine\ntoday my guest is Dr Jeffrey Goldberg Dr\nJeffrey Goldberg is the chair of the\nDepartment of Ophthalmology at Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine he is a\nclinician and MD or medical doctor who\nsees patients every week as well as a\nPhD meaning a laboratory scientist who\ndirects his own laboratory focused at\nunderstanding the mechanisms and cures\nfor diseases of the eye Envision such as\nglaucoma retinitis Pigmentosa and\nmacular degeneration indeed Dr Goldberg\nis one of the world leaders in\ndeveloping methods to cure blindness he\nis also intensely knowledgeable about\nall things related to Vision so during\ntoday's discussion we indeed cover most\nall of visual and Eye Health you will\nlearn for instance about the benefits as\nwell as drawbacks of wearing corrective\nlenses such as contact lenses or\neyeglasses for reading you will learn\nabout the benefits and detriments of\nsunlight meaning how it can help your\nvision in fact how it can help reverse\nor prevent my own Opia nearsightedness\nas well as the things to be cautious\nabout with respect to sunlight in terms\nof development of cataracts which are\nocclusions that prevent Vision we also\ndiscuss many tools for maintaining and\nimproving Vision across the lifespan\nranging from behavioral tools so\nspecific Vision tasks and exercises for\nthe eye that you can do that are known\nto improve or maintain your vision as\nwell as specific surgical procedures\nsuch as LASIK surgery we get into all\nthe details of for instance how often to\ndo these various eye exercises how long\nthe benefits are maintained as well as\nage-related considerations for things\nlike Lasik eye surgery we even get into\nhow to best clean your contact lenses\nwhether or not to use disposable contact\nlenses or other forms of contact lenses\nwe also discuss things like dry eye and\nthe best remedies for dry eye and we\ntalk about the scientific and clinical\ndata around nutritional approaches and\nsupplementation-based approaches for\nmaintaining and improving Vision so\nwhether or not you suffer from floaters\nor dry eye or you're considering\nchanging your eye prescription or you\nhave concerns about whether or not\nrelying on corrective lenses is\nimpairing your vision and you want to\nenhance your vision or if you're\nsomebody who has perfect vision today's\nepisode is going to include science and\nprotocols that will be highly relevant\nto you I should also add that if you are\nsomebody who suffers from or who has\nfamily members who suffer from diseases\nof the eye that can impact Vision such\nas glaucoma retinitis Pigmentosa and\nmacular degeneration we also delve deep\ninto the discussion about the most\nAdvanced Technologies for preventing and\noffsetting vision loss due to those\ndiseases as well thanks to Dr Goldberg's\nincredible knowledge his Clarity of\ncommunication and his generosity with\nthat knowledge by the end of today's\nepisode You Will Be armed with all of\nthe modern information you need in order\nto best maintain and improve your eye\nand vision health before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Maui Nui\nvenison Maui Nui venison is the most\nnutrient dense and delicious red meat\navailable I've talked before on this\npodcast about the key importance of\nstriving to get one gram of protein per\npound of body weight now when one\nstrives to do that it's also important\nto maximize the quality protein to\ncalorie ratio in other words you don't\nwant to consume a lot of extra calories\nin order to get your quality protein\nMaui Nui venison in having an extremely\nhigh quality protein and nutrient to\ncalorie ratio allows you to do that very\neasily and in addition to that Maui Nui\nvenison is delicious I particularly like\ntheir bone broth which has an unmatched\n25 grams of protein per 100 calories I\nalso love their ground venison and their\nvenison steaks all of them are\nabsolutely delicious if you'd like to\ntry Maui Nui venison go to\nmauinuyvenison.com\nSuperman and get 20 off your first order\nagain that's Maui News venison.com\nhuberman to get 20 off today's episode\nis also brought To Us by element element\nis an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need that is the\nelectrolytes sodium magnesium and\npotassium but nothing you don't which\nmeans no sugar it's critical that we get\nelectrolytes because every cell of our\nbody but in particular our nerve cells\nour neurons rely on electrolytes in\norder to function properly with element\nit's very easy to ingest the correct\nratios of electrolytes that come in\nthese little packets they're really\ndelicious you mix them up with anywhere\nfrom 8 to 16 to 32 ounces of fluid I\nlike mine pretty concentrated so I'll\ndrink a 16 ounce glass of water with\nelement in it when I first wake up I'll\nalso consume another one of those maybe\n32 ounces with one packet when I\nexercise and maybe another one if I\nhappen to sweat a lot during exercise or\nif I was in the sauna and sweating a lot\nif it's a very hot day Etc if you'd like\nto try element go to drink element\nthat's lmnt.com\ngovernment to

cooling Heating and\nsleep tracking capacity now there's\nabsolutely no question that sleep is the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance when we're\nsleeping well and we're sleeping long\nenough everything in our daily life goes\nthat much better now a key component to\ngetting a great night's sleep is the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nand that's because in order to fall and\nstay deeply asleep your core body\ntemperature actually has to drop by\nabout one to three degrees conversely in\norder to wake up feeling refreshed your\ncore body temperature has to increase by\nabout one to three degrees with eight\nSleep mattress covers you can cool or\nheat your mattress at the beginning\nmiddle and end of your night in order to\noptimize your night's sleep I started\nsleeping on an eight-sleep mattress\ncover about two years ago and it has\ndramatically improved the sleep that I\nget each and every night if you'd like\nto try Aid sleep you can go

and\nnow for my discussion with Dr Jeffrey\nGoldberg Dr Jeffrey Goldberg welcome\nthanks it's great to be here you and I\ngo way back\nwe will spare people the discussion\nabout all of that but\nI'm really excited for today's\ndiscussion because I get a tremendous\nnumber of questions about vision and Eye\nHealth and of course as a neuroscientist\nwho has worked on the visual system I\nsometimes have answers or partial\nanswers but more often than not I don't\nhave the answers\nand yet I'm confident that you do or\nthat if you don't you can direct us to\nthe proper place to get those answers so\nto kick things off I want to ask you\nwhat was one of the most commonly asked\nquestions when I solicited for questions\nin anticipation of this episode which is\nhow early should one do an eye exam on\ntheir child and how regularly should we\nall be doing eye exams\nalso\nis the fact that I think I can see\nnormally confirmation that I can see as\nwell as I think I can so that's really\nthree questions but baby comes out do\nthey check their eyes right away and if\nso how and how often should they check\nand what kind of information is there\nyeah it's as a great question it's\nobviously something that touches us all\nso the the answer that really differs a\nlittle bit uh at the different stages of\nLife first of all every every baby gets\nan eye exam or should be getting an eye\nexam and uh one of the main things that\nyou really just are screening for right\nwhen that baby is born right in the\nnursery right in those first few days is\nto just look for a red reflex you know\nwhen you take a camera picture a Flash\npicture and sometimes you get red eye\nthat's actually the light from the flash\nas you know reflecting against the\nretina coming back out of your eye it\nlooks red and\num and a red reflex is actually very\nnormal that's that that's great and if\nyou have a one of a number of\ndiseases in the eye that can present\neven in babies even in newborn babies\nincluding most concerning but thankfully\nleast common retinoblastoma which is the\nmost common pediatric eye cancer which\nagain thankfully is quite rare uh those\nbabies won't have a red reflex in that\neye it'll be kind of a whitish or gray\nreflex and so even just that first\nlittle you know doctor's taking the\nlittle pen light and even just flashing\nit in that's in the baby's eyes so\nthat's that's that's our first eye exam\nand hopefully we've all had that and\nhopefully every baby being born today is\ngetting that getting that first eye exam\nis really just looking for that red\nreflex\nuh it's not typical as long as that's\nlooking good\num to worry about getting an eye exam\nfrom there kind of through\num childhood like maybe early Elementary\nSchool unless they your baby is\npresenting with one of a number of\nfeatures that parents often pick up on\nfor example as the baby's aging through\nthose first couple of years you know\nthrough the first couple of years babies\nactually don't have great visual Acuity\nand so as they're aging over those first\ncouple years it's normal for them to\nhave you know roving eye movements for\nexample be searching their environment\nbut over those first couple of years if\nparents start noticing the baby isn't\nyou know isn't uh making eye contact or\nlooking where a sound is certainly if\nthey have what's called nystagmus like\nthese rapid flickering alternating eye\nmovements uh anything like that of\ncourse you're going to trigger trigger\nan eye exam but otherwise most babies\nother than their pediatrician doing that\nred reflex check when they're in for\ntheir regular well child checks uh\nthat's really all that's uh needed\nthrough that when most kids get to\nelementary school age there will often\nbe often done at the schools and\namblyopia screening exam if kids eyes\neither if one eye doesn't see that well\nlike maybe you're very nearsighted or\nfarsighted in one eye and pretty normal\nsighted in the other or the two\nrefractive errors are quite different\nfrom each other that can lead to a\ncondition you've talked about on the\npodcast before called amblyopia which is\nprobably one of the more common or most\ncommon eye diseases of children\nor if the eyes are in a line you know\nour eye muscles and the Brain behind\nthem are really responsible for keeping\nthe two eyes looking straight ahead and\nif that's not working properly and one\neye is is off kilter and therefore the\nimage of what we're looking at is\nfalling on different spots of the retina\nit's not sinking upright in the brain\nthat can lead to this disease condition\ncalled amblyopia where that eye is no\nlonger talking to the brain properly and\nthere's a pretty easy screening exam\nthat can be done for strabismus the\nmisalignment of the eyes that kids will\ndo in elementary school the other main\npresenting symptom of kids in elementary\nschool is when they admit to their\nparents I can't see the board or I can't\nsee the teacher up front and then they\nmight be quite nearsighted and so that\nwill also trigger an exam and so those\nare usually the parts for for babies for\ntoddlers for children school-aged\nchildren that might reasonably trigger\nan exam a couple of questions about\nearly eye exams and we'll um get on to\nuh eye exams in older visuals in a\nsecond but I want to interrupt you with\nthis question so you mentioned that um\nyou know there can be a misalignment of\nthe eyes I've seen many people's babies\nwhere there is one eyeball that seems to\nbe kind of drifting around and then it\nmight correct but sometimes they'll have\na we don't want to get technical here\nfor our listeners we'll keep it General\nbut either convergent eyes or one eye\nconverging cross eyes or walleyed you\nknow again using uh that non-technical\nlanguage here\num and my understanding is that the\nbrain is taking that information in and\nit's very plastic it's changing at these\nearly stages of development and that\nit's fairly critical to get that stuff\ncorrected early on because if you wait\ntoo long the brain can essentially\nbecome blind to the the um or rather the\nthe brain cannot learn to handle the\nproper alignment so in other words if a\nkid has cross eyes\ncrossed eyes excuse me and they're not\ncorrected uh until their 20s it's\npossible that they will never recover\nnormal vision whereas if you recover if\nyou align the eyes properly early in\ndevelopment they can indeed recover\nVision how early can and should one\nconsider getting those eye realignments\ndone yeah yeah pretty much right on what\nthey'll do is if they detect any eye\nmisalignment and sometimes parents are\nare good at noticing that and sometimes\nyou take a picture and one eye got the\nred eye reflex and the other one didn't\nand sometimes people notice that their\nkids eyes are sort of turning in it\nseems like too much\num sometimes there's what's called\npseudostrabismus which is where actually\ndepending on your Anatomy if you have a\nlittle extra skin sort of on the inside\ncorners of your eyes it makes your eyes\nlook turned in when actually they're\nstraight but if your eyes are actually\nturned in or slightly less common in\nchildren more common in adults\nmisalignment turned out\nit's really important to correct that\nearly and the reason is as you were\nsaying the brain starts ignoring it it\nfails to fully develop the straw wrong\nconnections from the for the data coming\nin from one of those two eyes into the\nbrain and if you pass certain sort of\nthresholds during development during\nchildhood without correcting that\nconnectivity getting those two eyes to\nwork together properly you can\npermanently lose that\num and so we use sort of we used to use\nvery sort of uh you know gross numbers\nlike it's fully correctable if you can\nintervene before age three it's partly\ncorrectable if you can intervene before\nage six you got a chance before age nine\nbut it turns out in follow-on studies\nthat even kids into their young teens\nhave a shot at correcting that I brain\nconnection that amblyopia that that loss\nof vision uh that that can occur during\nearly development so even if you're only\nyou know unfortunately detecting that\nlater on in childhood or even sort of\nthe tween years or early teen years it's\nstill worth a try to really push to\num retrain the weaker eye and then also\nrealign the muscles so that they can\nwork together to keep the eyes focused\nI'll tell you it's interesting and\nthere's a lot more to learn about brain\nplasticity and probably a lot of really\ncool new\ntherapies yet to discover that could\nreopen what's called critical period\nplasticity this this this plasticity\nthat we have during development that\nkind of goes away as we age and and that\ncritical period plasticity as you know\nhas been the best studied actually in\nthe visual system and the idea that we\ncould reopen that is really fantastic\nbut for different parts of that ibrain\nconnection there's different periods for\ncritical period plasticity for example\neven if you get the amblyopic eye to see\nwell again and then you realign the eyes\nand now they're working together a lot\nof kids will never recover full depth\nperception stereopsis the use of two\neyes to see depth for example so why\nthat part of the brain doesn't\ncorrect as well as the visual Acuity or\ncentral vision part of the brain I'm not\nsure if we understand that yet\nI'm going to ask for a curbside consult\nas sometimes called right now by telling\nyou a story when I was a kid I went\nswimming without goggles and I had one\neye closed and the other eye open and\nclosing as it went in and out of the\nwater because I'm a deficient swimmer\nand I only breathe to one side\nunless I really consciously forced\nmyself to breathe to both sides in a\nfreestyle swim got out of the pool and I\nwas seeing double\nit was pretty eerie and then it became\ndownright scary because I didn't recover\nmy double vision until they patched one\nof the eyes to forcing me to use the\nother eye that had been closed the\nentire time\nand fortunately this was done early\nenough and it I was young enough that\nwithin I think it was about a day or so\nI restored what normal vision however my\ndepth perception is terrible\num I'm the kid that you know Fly ball\nwas hit to me in the Outfield and it's\ncoming it's coming and then it hit me\nthis is why I've generally focused on\nfoot Sports throughout my entire life as\nopposed to you know precise hand-eye\ncoordination I'm better at throwing\ndarts and things with one eye closed\nthan I ever would be with both eyes\nmaybe that's true for most people\nquestion I have is\nis it true that even just a few hours of\nmisalignment of information to the two\neyes early in development can\npermanently rewire the brain unless\nthere are some corrective measures such\nas patching up one eye and the example I\ngave is just one but for instance if um\nuh you know someone injures you know\ngives a scratch on their cornea and they\nclose they patch the eye and the person\nhappens to be 10 years old is it\nimportant to then patch the other\nhealthy eye after the the um you know\nthe scratched eye is feeling better in\nother words how critical is it to ensure\nthe balance of information coming into\nthe two eyes even on the order of hours\nor days yeah your story is uh it has\nsome features of uh you know totally\nusual how we think about misaligned eyes\nleading to amblyopia where one eye is\nweaker patching the strong eye so the\nweak eye can recover but not necessarily\nfully regaining depth perception and so\nthat part of it is you know quite\nstereotypical the part of your story\nthat's atypical is that for most kids\num an hour to let alone minutes an hour\nto even an hour to a day if you were I\ndon't know if you were a young kid and\nyou just really were training up on\nthrowing darts and you were just keeping\none eye closed to throw the darts you\nknow really practicing for an hour a day\nit'd be very unusual for that to trigger\nthis kind of either strabismus\nmisalignment of the eyes let alone\namblyopia and the strabismus is what's\ngiving you the double vision because\nthey're misaligned let alone the\namblyopia of one eye turning out weaker\nif I had to guess of course not having\nyou know done your exam before that\nfateful day in the swimming pool if I\nhad to guess I would guess that you may\nhave had some intermittent business and\nyour brain was already getting kind of\nhit\nand and you neither you nor your parents\nmay have even noticed it it could be\nhappening you know at other times a day\nor you're not kind of really paying\nattention it doesn't kind of stand out\nin the way that that that day that you\ngot out of the swimming pool you really\nnoticed it and it may not have been that\nstrong it may have been quite\nintermittent but if you had had some\nyears of intermittent isotropia or\nturning in of the eyes or exotropia\nturning out of the eyes that just\nhappened here and there but was\naccumulating sort of uh damage or\nfailure to connect over years leading up\nto that day in the swimming pool and\nthat day just tipped you over the edge\nand you've got double vision you really\nnoticed it that led to an eye exam and\nan eye care provider and they said wait\na second this size stronger this size\nweaker you've got a little amblyopia\nwe're going to start patching your\nstrong eyes so you can get your weak eye\nback so for 99.9 percent of the kids who\nlike you know yeah they get a little\ncorneal scratch or they're patching one\neye closed or or uh you know anything\nthat's sort of a rare event like that\nnothing to worry about parents don't\nhave to worry kids can be kids they can\nplay they can do that kind of thing and\nuh and not have to worry and and it's\nunfortunate that we can't tell in\nadvance\nwhich kid's been having the intermittent\namblyopia because we don't do a standard\neye exam on every five-year-old who's\nnot complaining of anything but but yeah\nso that's a that's an unusual case in\nyours and if I had to guess I I would\nbet that you were having some sort of\nsubclinical untracked Uncharted\nunnoticed maybe strabismus leading up to\nthat point okay great thank you you can\nsend me a bill at the end\num\nalong those lines\nI'm 47 years old so I was part of the\ngeneration that grew up with some\ncomputers in the classroom but not a lot\nnowadays\nkids from a very young age are looking\nat iPads and\nphones and screens and things very close\nup and there is a wealth of experimental\nanimal data showing that if you limit\nVision to just close range that the\neyeball lengthens and therefore the\nvisual image Falls in front of and not\ndirectly onto the neural retina the\nessentially the light sensing portion of\nthe of the eye and those animals become\nmyopic or nearsighted\nwhat can we say about the environmental\nconditions in which kids are seeing\nfrom the time they're born through let's\nsay adolescents and their teen years in\nterms of\nhow their visual system wires up and are\nthere any recommendations that are\ncoming from the scientific literature\nclinical studies clinical trials excuse\nme or otherwise that indicate what a\nhealthy visual environment consists of\nyeah yeah that's a great question and\nactually it's really relevant these days\nbecause uh you know myopia is so common\nuh it's more common\num\nan Asian populations you know it's\ncalled an epidemic in China in\nCalifornia we have a lot of Asian\nHeritage or Asian Americans and so we\nsee a lot like at Stanford we see a lot\nof\num you know myopia in kids on adults and\nreally starting to get thoughtful on the\nscience of myopia control how do we how\ndo we provide the right environments now\nwhat's interesting is that for decades\nthe Assumption some of the data really\nled us to the path of thinking like gosh\nthe more you spend near activities and\nthese are Mouse model experiments like\nyou described but also well-designed\nhuman cohort studies you know figuring\nout like asking you know kids and\nfamilies like how long is your kid\nreading or in front of the computer how\nmyopic are they how nearsighted are they\nversus how much time is your kid in\nfront of the computer doing near work\nhow myopic or nearsighted are they and\nthese well-designed cohort studies did\nPoint tour words this concept that if\nyou do too much near work as a kid that\nyou're more likely to develop\nnearsightedness as you get through those\nthose sort of you know uh pre-teen and\neven into the teen years which is when\nmost of that myopia progression or\neyeball elongation is actually happening\nto cause nearsightedness\nit's only been in the last few years\nthat some really exciting Studies have\nactually pointed in a slightly different\ndirection\nand that's that maybe it's not all not\nto say it's not about near activity but\nmaybe it's not all about near activity\nmaybe it's actually a little more about\nthe kind of light we're getting into our\neyes and I think you've talked about\nthis before and it's really important\nwhen they've now studied and asked the\nkids instead of just how much near and\nhow much far are you doing how much time\nare you spending indoors in indoor\nlighting which doesn't have full\nspectrum light in a typical indoor\nenvironment versus how much time are you\nspending Outdoors\nplaying in the yard you could be reading\noutside but what are you just what kind\nof time are you spending outside and and\nof course when you're outside in\nsunlight even it's in direct sunlight\nyou're getting a different spectrum of\nkind of Full Spectrum Lighting from the\nsun and it looks like it's pretty clear\nnow actually that it has maybe more to\ndo with outdoor lighting time than just\nnear work and so I think that you know\nwe we've we've actually already seen the\nfirst couple randomized controlled\ntrials where they're having kids\nintentionally spending time Outdoors\nversus sort of Standard Life which you\nknow is going to be often much more\nindoor time and uh and seeing some\neffects you follow those kids over a\ncouple of years and the kids who spend\ntime Outdoors are are progressing in\ntheir nearsightedness less like they're\nthey're nearsighted prescription is not\ngetting as strong as the kid kids who\nare spending more time indoors and\nthere's some pretty good biology that's\ngetting worked out going back to animal\nmodels more about about how that might\nbe working in the retina in this inside\nthe eye but it's pretty compelling uh\nconcept and and so you know as a parent\nuh you you may want to be you may want\nto be telling your kid like okay yeah I\nwant you to read that book or you know\nif your kids plan on the phone or\nsomething like that or the iPad or\nsomething like that they're allowed that\ntime okay you can have that time but I\nwant you to spend some of the time that\nyou're doing that Outdoors are there any\nthresholds for the amount of time that\none would suggest their child be\noutdoors to get that full spectrum light\nit's a great question you know we talk\nabout cohort studies where we just ask\npeople what are they doing and there\nseems to be you know a little bit of\nwhat we would call a dose dependent\nresponse maybe the more time Outdoors\nmight be better we don't know if there's\nan upper limit like gosh if you go over\ntwo or three hours there's no additional\nbenefit talk about that cohort studies\nthe real gold standard for answering\nthese kinds of questions are randomized\ncontrolled trials and specifically\nplacebo-controlled or or a control group\nthat's not getting the intervention\nthat's our highest level of evidence for\nclinical evidence for for any of this\nkind of science when we're talking about\nhumans or pre-clinical models in the\nlaboratory and the study that hasn't\nbeen done yet to really answer that\nquestion is to randomize kids to telling\nthis group of kids you just do your\nnormal life tell this group of kids we\nwant you outside an hour this group of\nkids we want you outside two hours a day\nthis group occurred three hours a day\nand see between the groups is there a\nbig difference like we have pretty good\nevidence now from the studies that have\nbeen done that the difference between\nzero\nand one or two hours is clearly There is\nfive minutes enough is five hours better\nI don't think we know the answers to\nthose questions yet like what's the\nright dose but there's probably at least\nsome dose dependence to that and it I\ncan imagine it's a little bit hard to\ntease apart the near far viewing from\nthe indoor outdoor because yes of course\na child could be outside on an iPad up\nclose\nbut it's hard to imagine that at some\npoint they aren't seeing off into the\ndistance far viewing as it's called and\nthe reverse is also true if you're\nindoors unless you live in a very very\nlarge home or you're staring off a\nbalcony far viewing is much harder to\nachieve yeah so it's and perhaps it\nisn't important to isolate these\nvariables although I can see the\nchallenge in developing a really good\nclinical trial randomized clinical trial\nfor this meanwhile I I you know I'm con\nI'll go into the grave shouting you know\nor saying rather and suggesting that\npeople get some morning sunlight in\ntheir eyes to set their circadian rhythm\num but far viewing a few at least a few\nminutes and ideally hours per day or a\nmixture of near and far viewing by being\noutdoors just seems like a good thing to\ndo regardless of age so are there any\ndata in older people not necessarily\nelderly but older people so um people in\nthere from say 25 years of age into\ntheir 60s or 70s that getting outdoors\nand getting this full spectrum light is\nhealthy for the eye in ways that are\nseparate from the known healthy effects\nof doing that on circadian rhythm\nsetting yeah yeah the Circadian Parts\npretty clear the\nand most patients and most in most\npeople the new the development of\nnearsightedness happens a lot until age\n10 little more through age 20. a little\nmore than that into the in you know in\nthrough the 20s up to 30. tiny bit in\nthe 30s up to 40. but usually by those\nlater ages your prescription might be\nchanging a quarter of a diopter that's\nthe measurement that we use when we you\nknow give you your glasses prescription\na quarter of a diopter half a diopter it\ncould get a half after more nearsighted\nor less nearsighted you know once you're\naging into your 40s 50s and Beyond so\nmost of the action on nearsightedness\ndevelopment is actually really happening\nin the younger ages so again the the\npremise of intervening in an older\nperson and I'll just include you and me\nand older people for the sake of this\ndefinition as much as I'm reticent to do\nthat in general\num I think the the premise of Inc of of\nsort of light modulation from\nnearsightedness in older people is\nprobably probably not so strong I think\nthere are a lot of other benefits you've\ntalked a lot about circadian rhythm\nthere are so many health benefits to\nexercise and you know if you're getting\nOutdoors there's a good chance you're\ngoing to be walking or bicycling you\nknow so so exercise value for the health\nof our eyes and the rest of our body is\nclearly there\num but I don't know that there's really\na strong premise that you're going to\nchange your glasses prescription you\nknow in our 40s or 50s or Beyond I'd\nlike to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag-1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your foundational\nnutritional needs I've been taking\nathletic green since 2012 so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 it's\nprobably worth touching on some of the\ndo's and some of the don'ts for Eye\nHealth generally and then I promise I'm\ngoing to get us back to adult eye exams\nbecause I have a lot of questions about\nthat\nI can imagine that it's probably not a\ngreat idea to be exposed to extremely\nbright light and this is why people who\nweld wear eye Shields but of course most\npeople are not welding\num\nwhat other sorts of environmental\nconditions are detrimental to our vision\nhealth across the lifespan including\nbrightness of light we talked a little\nbit about near far obviously we want to\nkeep toxins and acids and solvents and\nthings out of the eye but what do you\nsee\nI'm not because hopefully not commonly\nbut what are some of the things that you\nfeel might not be discussed enough in\nterms of Eye Health yeah you know I\nthink at all ages eye safety is\nsomething that we don't talk about\nenough\num you know our eyes are delicate the\nfront surface of the eye the cornea the\nClear Window that lets the light go into\nyour eye that's a delicate very\nsensitive structure it's thin maybe a\nmillimeter at the thickest a half\nmillimeter in the center of our eye\nuh the retina is it it's neural tissue\nthis is like really an outgrowth of the\nbrain this is very sensitive it's\nsubject to degenerative disease and\ninjury our eyes even if they just get\nhit can get very inflamed our eyes can\nbe more inflammatory than a bruise on\nour skin on our shoulder might be so eye\nsafety is a big one and people who are\nworking in certain industries\num you know anyone who's doing any metal\ngrinding people who are even just\ngardening you know and if you're if\nyou're doing some significant gardening\nand cutting and you could you know Fleck\na little bit of dirt you know there's a\nlot of there's a lot of for example\nfungus that lives in the ground natural\nstuff it's all very normal in the in the\nEarth but you know our eyes aren't\nreally made to absorb that fungus and\nand have have a piece of dirt kind of\nstick in our eye like that and so people\nare at risk I think for you know for not\nand we see too much kind of\nreally unnecessary eye injury eye trauma\nthat if people wore either their glasses\nbecause they happen to wear prescription\nglasses or goggles or for more advanced\nwork you know safety goggles of course\num if you're sanding doing wood shop\nprojects anything like that sawing\nincluding you know again in the garden\ncutting things\num you know I think I think eye safety\nyou know eye trauma is a big one and you\nknow we probably see one or two\num what we call open Globes a week come\ninto the Opera into the emergency room\nand\num you know those are tough because you\nknow again the eyes delicate and it can\ndo a lot of healing but but not infinite\nright and so we really you know that's\nthat's one that I think is really\nan untapped opportunity is just a little\nmore education around\num around eye protection protecting\nagainst eye trauma what about eye\ncleanliness there's some pretty dramatic\nvideos also I've put some of these on my\nInstagram handle of these are MRIs of\npeople rubbing their eyeballs and people\nreally getting a sense of first of all\na restatement of what you said getting a\nreal sense of just how much the eyes are\nan outgrowth of the brain because of the\nop when you see with the optic nerves\nand all their beauty and the eyeballs\nmoving around as someone rubs their eyes\nI have to imagine that rubbing your\neyeballs a little bit isn't bad but I\nactually called you I don't know if you\nremember when I was a junior Professor I\nwoke up from a nap one day and I\ncouldn't see out of one eye I was\nfreaking out so of course I called you\nand I had pressure blinded Myself by\nfalling asleep on my hand or something\nlike that and you assured me that my\nvision would come back and indeed it did\nso you play dual role of ophthalmologist\nand psychiatrist thank you and indeed I\ncan see out both eyes\num now\num but\nrubbing our eyes getting gunk in our\neyes you know I think unless somebody\nhas lost their Vision temporarily\nit's hard to imagine this is like a big\ndeal but when it happens it is truly\nfrightening we're so dependent on Vision\nso um you know what are your\nrecommendations about rubbing or not\nrubbing eyeballs about\num hand washing and cleanliness and also\nhow do you wash an eye properly yeah do\nyou use soap and flush it with water or\ndo you just flush it with water or\nshould you not even do that should use\nsaline I didn't realize these might\nsound like low level questions but these\nare the things that people deal with on\nan all too frequent basis yeah you know\nfor most people most of the time\nactually the eyes are a very good clean\nenvironment and actually are tears are\nare contain enzymes that help break down\nbacteria and bacterial toxins and so for\nmost people regular eye washing doesn't\nhave to be any part of their standard\nroutine in terms of the surface of the\neye the part of your eye the conjunctiva\nuh over the whites of the eyes\nunderneath the eyelids anything\nunderneath the eyelids it's pretty\nself-cleaning and actually our tear\nproduction and blinking is very good at\nkeeping our eyes clean the eyelids\neyelashes can be another story and\nespecially as we age uh we can you know\nlike our skin is breaking down a little\ndifferently than when we were younger\nyou can develop what we sort of\nnicknamed scurf which is like kind of\nlittle dead skin bits that accumulate\naround the eyelashes a lot of people\ndevelop what we call blepharitis which\nis just just means inflammation of the\neyelashes yeah and for that doing some\neye scrubs is a good idea they actually\nsell little pads that you can buy kind\nof little that you rip open and you can\nuse to kind of lightly clean the\neyelashes but you can also just use like\na No More Tears baby shampoo just pump a\nlittle bit into the palm of your hand\nonce or twice a day let a little uh\ndilute it with a little water and under\nthe sink and either with your finger or\nan edge of a washcloth just very lightly\nrub the eyelashes what I like to do with\nthe eyes closed with the eyes closed and\ndon't scrunch them closed too tight\nbecause you're actually burying the\neyelashes when you do the roots of the\neyelashes when you really scrunch so\njust gently close your eyes just you\nknow real gentle closure and then just\nlightly scrub it shouldn't be abrasive\nyou're not trying to exfoliate the\neyelids or eyelashes in any way just\nlightly rub with that kind of dilute No\nMore Tears baby shampoo and that can\nreally help people with their eye\nComfort if you feel like you've got\nsomething in your eye your ideal eye\nwash is actually going to be a sterile\nSalient solution a saltwater solution\nthat you know they sell little bottles\nover the counter eye wash Solutions like\nthat a lot of people wear contacts will\nhave that kind of eye wash solution just\na sterile saline eye wash just pure salt\nwater doesn't have to have any other\nchemicals or preservatives in it you can\nof course use not actual uh seawater or\nsalt water not salt water thank you yeah\nnot salt water out of your salt pool not\nsalt water out of the ocean but like a\nsaline salt water that's available in a\nsterile now you can also just use\nartificial teardrops and some of those\ncommon non-preservatives some of those\ncome preserved versions those are all\nalso completely safe in the to use in\nthe eye and there you can you know you\ncan sort of Spritz into your eye you\nknow hold the lid open and give it a\nlittle Spritz if you feel like you've\ngot something in your eye a piece of\ndirt or A Lash that's not coming out\njust to rinse it but but having like a\nregular routine you know you're not\ngoing to hurt anything with the\noccasional eye rubbing we all do these\nthings just kind of as a you know even a\nnervous habit or just absent-mindedly\nyou know you might you know scratch your\narm or rub your eyes or things like that\nthat's fine you're not going to hurt\nanything there are conditions where\npeople sort of develop kind of a almost\nlike a psychological habit there are\ncertain conditions where people actually\ndo too much eye rubbing it can be\ndangerous if you're in that group but\nfor the regular run-of-the-mill every\nday occasional I rubbing fine if you\ncertainly if you get a lash in there and\nyou're trying to rub it and blink it and\ntear it out and again in that situation\nyou can use some artificial tears\nwedding drops saline drops those would\nbe the way to do it what an incredible\ntissue the way you describe it you know\nthe self-cleaning and yet so delicate\na piece of the brain literally lining\nthe back of each of our eyes like like a\npie crust I mean it's a really\nremarkable\num biological system of course I don't\nhave to tell you that it's just it it\nnever ceases to to amaze me\nlet's talk about eye exams in adults\nso\npeople are aware presumably that they're\noptometrists and ophthalmologists I\nthink it's important that we Define\ntheir different and also overlapping\nroles and\nfor those that you know are past High\nSchool age probably not getting eye\nexams unless they're sensing a problem\nperhaps not even with blurry vision or\ndifficulty seeing at a distance but\nsometimes just what feels like fatigue\nof the eyes or a hard time maintaining\nalignment of the eyes\num so how often do you recommend people\nget eye exams what is a true regular eye\nexam and is it important that people go\nto an ophthalmologist or will an\noptometrist suffice typically\noptometrists are a little bit easier for\nmost people to access because there's\nusually one someplace near an eyeglass\nstore so what are their roles how often\nshould we get our eyes checked yeah\num optometrists and ophthalmologists do\nhave very overlapping roles in being Eye\nCare Providers there are something over\n40 or 50 000 optometrists in the United\nStates or somewhere around 20 000\nophthalmologists in the United States\noptometrists get an optometry degree\nthey often have OD after their name\nophthalmologists usually went you know\nwent to medical school so they either\nhave an MD after their name or they kind\nof a do version of a medical degree and\nuh and then optometrists will have done\nadditional clinical training in that\narea in their area of Eye Care provision\nophthalmologist MD doctor\nophthalmologist Eye Care providers in\naddition to that training will have done\nsurgical training in Ophthalmology\num now there's a lot of overlap and\num in both scenarios uh you can be\ngetting your sort of General exam taken\ncare of maybe a screening exam I think\nthat there's been a traditional\ndifferentiation between optometrists and\nophthalmologists with optometrists\nproviding a little more of the primary\ncare eye screening maybe managing early\ndisease common diseases as well with\nmore advanced disease often sort of\nupgrading to perhaps specialist\nophthalmologists in those areas but that\ndistinction has been declining over time\nit's still true that in I think most if\nnot all states only the MD\nophthalmologists surgeons can do eye\nsurgeries but both both groups of eye\ncare providers can diagnose both can\nprescribe appropriate eye drop\ntreatments including prescription eye\ndrop treatments for for many of our\ndiseases eye diseases\nand um and in some states\noptometrists have successfully lobbied\nfor uh sort of expanded rights of\nproviding Air Care Eye Care and again\num access to care for you know the\nregular person wherever they may live is\nis the most important element and so\nbeing able to access eye care whether\nit's with an optometrist in your\ncommunity or an ophthalmologist that may\nbe in your community or maybe at a\ndistance I think that's the the really\nimportant thing is to access care now\nkind of like we were talking about with\nkids uh if you're in your teens 20s\nmaybe even 30s and not having any\nproblem you've got no complaints you can\nsee a distance you can see it near\num you know so you can read without\nclasses you can drive without classes\num you're not having any eye pains you\nknow pains around the eyes you know\nredness of the eyes you may never\npresent to an eye care provider through\nthe first four Decades of life\nand almost all the time it's going to be\nokay right if you're not symptomatic the\nchance you've got some terrible lurking\ndisease in there is low\nbut we do wish that we had a little more\nscreening going on because there are\nsome diseases glaucoma for example my\nspecialty the two main risk factors for\nglaucoma are increasing age and that\nusually presents you know in most cases\nactually after age 40 but also\nincreasing eye pressure and if your eye\npressure is too high you can't feel that\nthat won't feel funny to you if it sort\nof slowly is crept up over the years and\nso from a screening perspective it is\ngood to get some kind of screening exam\ncould be at a public health fair could\nbe that you go into the local\noptometrist just say hey I've never been\nchecked I'd like to be checked once make\nsure everything's good could you ask for\nsorry to interpret could somebody say\nI'd like my pressures checked as I\nrecall the optometrist they're going to\ndo a puff test so they're going to blast\nsome air get a sense of how how rigid or\nor soft again using non-clinical\nnon-technical language here the eyeball\nhappens to be\num not right now by the way I'm sure\nthere are are several hundreds of\nthousands of people who are with eyes\nclosed touching the sides of their\neyeballs and I'm only half joking please\ndon't do this folks I'm given the\nconversation we just had about eye\ncleanliness and eye rubbing but my\nunderstanding is that the old fat truly\nold-fashioned eye pressure exam was you\nwould close your eyes and the\nophthalmologist would gently press to\nsee whether or not your eyes were more\nrigid than last time yeah is that right\nyeah that's called ballot mint and you\ncan kind of you can you can kind of just\ntake one second if you're listening and\npress on your eyes just very lightly and\nyou there's a little give of course the\neyelids part of that give but but it's\nnot it's not like rock hard and if we\npress and it feels under the eyelid like\ngosh something under there is a rock\nhard then we know something is wrong\nthat is way too high pressure if it's\nraw card but I'll tell you our ability\nto differentiate the fine points of eye\npressure other than Rock Hard or not\nrock hard is pretty limited so yeah the\noptometrist office or the\nophthalmologist office office as part of\na comprehensive screening exam they'll\ncheck the eye pressure they'll look at\nthe surface of your eyes make sure\neverything's looking healthy there\nincluding the eyelids and lashes and\nthey'll look inside the eye and be able\nto screen for these diseases that way\ntoo in addition to checking if you're\ncomplaining of any you know blurriness\nat distance or at near now after age 40\nor so a lot of people will present to an\neye care provider because we all get\nwhat's called presbyopia and presbyopia\njust translates to disease a vision of\nthe agent so you know myopia is our word\nfor nearsighted hyperopia is farsighted\nactually amatropia means normal sighted\nso I can see it distance without any\nglasses I'm amitropic\nbut then we all get presbyopia and as we\nage the lens inside our eye that's\nhelping focus light onto our retina gets\nstiffer\nsuch that our eye muscles are no longer\nable to relax and reshape that lens and\nwe're not as good as we age at\nmoving our Focus from distance Vision\ndistance Vision by the way is basically\nanything three feet or further away\nYou're basically viewing light rays\ncoming from Infinity once you're past\nthree feet so three feet or further\nbeing able to focus that into 14 inches\nor 12 inches which might be a normal\ncomfortable reading space for you\nwe lose that ability to flex our lens\nrelax our lens uh refocus our lens from\ndistance to near and most people around\nage 40 could be a couple years before\ncould be five or ten years later that\nyou notice it but sort of around that\ntime you start needing reading glasses\nyou need a little extra even if you can\nsee fine at distance and don't need\nprescription glasses for distance you\nneed a booster you need reading glasses\nfor near I don't know if you're\nexperiencing this yet and yeah I'm\nreally intrigued by this but maybe you\ncould clarify when you say reading\nglasses do you mean just a magnifier\nbecause I use a you know a 0.5 or a 0.75\nmagnifier for reading but I try and rely\non them\nas little as possible and I want to get\nto this about using glasses as a crutch\nand the problems with that I have a\nstory about that too you know it's no\ncoincidence I decided to work on Vision\nI mean after all\num I had a bunch of vision issues that\nfortunately are corrected but you know I\nI do experience for instance when I wake\nup in the morning if I look at my phone\nwhich by the way folks I try and get\noutside and see sunlight first before\never looking at the phone but I'll\nnotice when I first look at my phone in\nthe morning that I can see it very\nclearly through my right eye but that if\nI cover my right eye my left eye is\nextremely blurry to the point where I'm\nlike oh I'm calling Jeff you know I'm\nI'm afraid but then over the course of\nmaybe 10-15 minutes it resolves and I\ndon't think it's because something's in\nmy eye I don't think it's pressure of\nhaving slept on that side I don't think\nit's a lubrication of the eye issue\num but the two eyes seem to come into\nFocus so to speak um at different rates\nearly in the day and if I pop my readers\non I can see right away so I will use\nreaders late in the day often\num if I want to read at night or\nsomething that's right just it feels so\nmuch more relaxing I feel like like I\ncan finally relax whereas otherwise I\nrealize that I'm straining in order to\nsee does is there any um clinical\nclinical data and what I just described\nyeah you know Andy I'll tell you my\nstory that's like that and\num we were living down in San Diego when\nyou and I were both professors at UC San\nDiego\nand uh we had moved into a house and I\nfound a pair of glasses a pair of\nreading glasses uh in a closet and you\nknow we asked around you know did any of\nthe grandparents uh leave some glasses\nbehind nobody seemed to know who they\nwere so we finally just decided like\nwell I guess the people who moved out of\nthe house just left a pair of glasses\nyou know in this in the back of this\ncloset\nand then I tried the glasses on\nand I looked at my phone up close and\nwas just like oh my God wait a second I\ndidn't realize how blurry my near Vision\nwas and this is back I was about 40 42\nsomething like that so\nso I didn't even realize until I put on\nthe readers and these were\nyou know 1.25 magnifiers you know so\nawesome yeah\nand I'll tell you\nI got addicted because who doesn't like\ngood Vision right right I mean oh my God\nnow I can make the type smaller on my\nphone I can you know it was wonderful\nand you can relax a bit I mean the\nmusculature that's responsible for for\nmoving the lens and focusing the eye and\nthen all this extraocular musculature\nand we forgot I mean I'm definitely\ngoing crow's feet\num around my eyes uh probably because I\nyou know squint or something but you\nknow just the ability to relax one's\nface it just feels like you know more\nmore energy I feel like can be devoted\nto what we're actually looking at yeah\nwe're not making light of this yeah well\npretty soon I just kept that one pair of\nglasses with me all the time and I would\njust keep them in a pocket and whip them\nout whenever I was you know working at\nnear using my phone at a little greater\ndistance like a typical computer\ndistance I could still see the computer\nfine so it really started for like kind\nof that close-up phone it was it was I\ncould get into here but not all the way\ninto here\nand um yeah and then pretty soon I was\njust totally addicted and so you know\nthen I had to go buy 10 pairs and leave\nthem one by the bedside table you know\none in the car one in the computer bag\none on everything I work at yeah because\nI'd leave them anywhere and forget them\nyeah exactly you know yeah\nso\num yeah so\nwhether using the readers\naccelerates the progression of\ndependence on the readers is still uh\nnot you know that's still up for debate\nyou know some studies say maybe yeah\nsome studies say maybe no but certainly\npsychologically we get addicted to good\neasy vision and if you don't have to\nsquint and if you're not straining your\nmuscles and all of a sudden the text on\nyour phone looks crisper again uh boy\nthat's addictive you're gonna like good\nvision and so it feels like you're\ngetting dependent and how much of that\nis changing the eye muscles and how much\nof that is just the psychology of\nwanting to have good Vision I think\nprobably the jury's a little bit out on\nthat point but point being you're either\neither way your dependence will grow and\nas you continue to age 40s 50s up until\nabout 60 65.\nthe ability to shape that lens gets\nweaker and weaker and weaker and so you\nneed to move from the 0.5 to the 1.0 to\nthe 1.5s and to the coke bottle to the\ncode well thankfully not you eventually\nmax out at about plus 2.5 or plus three\nbecause that's the amount of extra\nrefractive power that you need in\nmagnifiers to take the equivalent of\nyour Infinity viewing and bring it up to\n14 inches to read it near basically you\nneed a plus three and then you don't\nneed any\nlens eye muscle action whatsoever so you\nkind of max out around 2.5S or threes\nso because most people will hit this\nsomewhere in their 40s this sort of like\ngosh I'm having trouble on the phone\nI think most people actually use that\nthat's like kind of the first time for a\nlot of people they're like well I guess\nI should go to the eye office right see\nthe optometrist or maybe ophthalmologist\nand when they go in they should be\ngetting the standard in either of those\noffices will be to give you a full\nscreening exam including maybe it's the\npuff test or a blue light test or a\nlittle pen that can check your eye\npressure and having a look inside and\nseeing if you're retina optic nerve look\nhealthy it's kind of screening for all\nthe main diseases and so and they'll\ntell you at that point hey you look\ngreat if you feel like your glasses\naren't doing it for you in a year or\nthree years come back or they might say\nhey I've detected something I'm worried\nabout you and they'll set up a routine\nfor your ongoing Eye Care\nassuming that somebody doesn't have\num you know some form of amblyopia or\nthe need for some a really robust\ncorrective lenses\nand they are already using readers let's\nsay a plus one\nor so you know plus one plus or minus\n0.5 reader\nwould you recommend based on my\nexperience and based on your experience\nthat people strive to avoid using them\nfor as long as they can because in some\nsense if that's the recommendation then\nthe recommendation is that people kind\nof deal with the fact that they're\nseeing a little less well or a lot less\nwell than they possibly could so I'm\nassuming that people can still drive\nwell people can still read but it\ninvolves a little bit more effort in\nother words are we weakening Our Eyes by\nusing these these readers I I realize\nyou said that the data are a little bit\nmixed but as long as one can perform\ntheir required daily activities would we\nbe better off\ndelaying the use of readers\nthere's two important answers to that\nquestion one is regarding the lens and\nthe eye muscles that control the lens\nand it's entirely plausible that's what\nI was saying kind of the data is mixed\non but it's plausible that if we would\njust exercise like work a little harder\nkind of not use as strong a reader as we\nwant or not use that reader as often as\nwe might really enjoy uh are we\nexercising those muscles and kind of\nexercising the ability to to stretch\nversus relax the lens and kind of slow\nthe progression from the 1.0 reader to\nthe 1.25 reader to the 1.5 reader Etc\nright and so that that's why I'm saying\nthe data is mixed but there's a good\npremise that maybe if you're exercising\nbut let me give you the on on the other\nhand it's probably ideal\nto give your retina and your brain the\nsharpest visual signals you can\nso why hamstring your retina and your\nbrain and your vision and your enjoyment\nand ability to read or do near work by\nconstantly undercutting the the reading\nglasses or leaving them out or you're\nnot helping the whole back part of yours\nmaybe you're maybe you're helping the\nlens but you're definitely not helping\nyour retina and brain by feeding it\nblurry information all of that time so I\nactually think just give in use the\nreaders have your enjoy your Best Vision\nall the time and if that means wearing\nglasses and by the way if that means\nthat you're going to have minus two\nglasses for vision and you'll eventually\nneed minus 250s for distance Vision or\nif you're going to need readers 1.5\nreaders now and in a few years 2.0\nreaders okay so you'll get the next\nreader it's it's it's actually not a big\ndeal you can you can you know you're not\nyou're not hurting you're probably\nhelping and in the meantime it's an\nenormous enjoyment to actually have good\nVision all the time right so so I\nactually counsel people\njust wear the glasses that work best for\nyou you know you're only minimally\nchanging how your prescription is going\nto change over time very minimally so\njust enjoy your Best Vision even if it's\nusing readers for clothes or\nprescription glasses for far\nI appreciate that recommendation I do\nenjoy you using the readers at night it\nreally helps for all the reasons I\nmentioned before\nI've noticed that driving at night\npresents an enormous strain on my visual\nsystem and I've noticed this for a\nnumber of years are there any I know\nthere's something called stationary\nnight blindness I don't think I'm\nstationary night blind\num I think the mutation for stationary\nnight blindness was identified in the\nColusa horse or something like that\nthese were horses that you could walk up\nto very easily and they wouldn't even\nsee you until you're right there\nsomeone's going to correct me on this\nit's the internet but I think that the\nmutation was identified\num Etc but I don't think I'm stationary\nnight blind but I do find that driving\nat night I get very fatigued and then\nI'll sometimes even wear my plus one\nreaders when I drive at night which\nremoves the fatigue even though I'm\nlooking more or less at a distance are\nthere some conditions that make it hard\nfor people to see at night for which\nthey would want corrective lenses\num and what what sorts of biology\nunderlies that assuming that somebody is\nnot stationary night blind or a Colusa I\nthink is the name of the breed horse\nyeah that's a great question you know we\nfor the for the optical defects in our\neyes most or many of which can be\ncorrected with just having the right\nprescription lenses we can get away with\nit without using those Corrections in\nbrighter light\nand so during the daytime\num you know you could be slightly blurry\nyou know if I have a real bright light\nuh and a good high contrast book you\nknow with black letters on the white\npage I can get away with reading that\nwithout my readers unlike if if I'm in\ndim light then I feel and that might be\nkind of what you're describing if you're\nreading at night you actually prefer to\nuse the readers a little more even at\nnight because we can make up for a lot\nof that blur if we just have bright\nenough signal and contrast coming into\nour eyes makes sense yeah so when you're\ndriving at night and noticing this this\nmight be revealing a little bit of a\nneed for glasses now I'm not suggesting\nthis is the answer but far more common\nthan having congenital stationary night\nblindness would be being what's called a\nlatent hyper rope okay now we talked\nabout already how the lens inside our\neye goes from focusing it distance to\nthen we squeeze the muscles the lens\nactually rounds up and allows us to\nfocus it near\nsome people's Optical system of their\neye is actually wired or designed or\nsort of set up in length not for regular\ndistance which would be anywhere from\nabout three feet to Infinity\nbut it's actually designed it's actually\ntuned for being beyond Infinity which\ndoesn't make any actual sense when you\ntalk about it but just the Optics of the\neye at their best Focus are actually\nfocusing the light behind the retina and\nand if you're doing that when you're\nyounger you're actually using some of\nyour focusing power to to use those\nmuscles strain those muscles relax that\nlens round up that lens and have your\nvision Focus From Beyond Infinity to\nnormal distance like distance vision and\nso if you're a latent hyperope you are\nconstantly using those muscles and again\nif you're tired it's the end of the day\nyour muscles are feeling a little\nfatigued uh your latent hyperopia or by\nthe way if you've had a drink or two\nalcohol can do this too your latent\nhyperopia can kind of kick in especially\nas we're age and we're not as good at\nrefocusing that lens anyway and now all\nof a sudden your vision is kind of\nreverting to its natural state which is\nslightly out of focus at distance\nbecause it's actually focused beyond\nInfinity if you will and so all of a\nsudden you put on that plus one just for\na little extra booster kick and you're\nlike oh yeah yeah distance vision is\nclean and easy now so\nI'll have to bring you into the clinic\nto really be sure but you could be\nexhibiting a little bit of that kind of\nlatent hyperopia I definitely want the\neye exam and I want it from you and I've\nbeen called a lot of things in life um\nand we can now let add perhaps latent\nhyper\nopiate\nuh to that\nI'd like to take a quick break and thank\nour sponsor inside tracker inside\ntracker is a personalized nutrition\nplatform that analyzes data from your\nblood and DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help you reach\nyour health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term Health can only be\nassessed with a quality blood test the\nproblem with a lot of blood and DNA\ntests out there however is that they'll\ngive you information about certain lipid\nmarkers or hormone markers but no\ninformation about what to do with all of\nthat data inside tracker makes it very\neasy to look at your levels of hormones\nmetabolic factors lipids Etc and then to\nassess what sorts of Behavioral\nnutritional supplementation or perhaps\nother interventions you might want to\nuse to bring those numbers into the\nranges that are appropriate and indeed\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninside tracker you can visit\ninsidetracker.com huberman and get 20\noff any of inside tracker's plans that's\ninside tracker.com huberman to get 20\noff another easier and again this\ndiscussion is not designed to be an eye\nexam for me but I have yet another\nexperience that I think illustrates the\nkey importance of both critical period\nplasticity and the questions about\nwhether or not to rely on corrective\nlenses and that is from the time I was\npretty young I could make my sister\nlaugh by deviating one eye inward so not\ncrossing my eyes but moving one eye\nInward and then what happened was when I\nwas in college and studying a lot a lot\nand getting very fatigued I noticed that\nthis I started just kind of drifting a\nlittle bit so I went to the campus\nHealth Center and they gave me a\nprescription for a prism lens which of\ncourse redirects the image but then I\nnoticed that this eyeball moving Inward\nand I guess for those of you watching on\nuh on YouTube and not just listening um\nI can do this\num by just moving one eye in all right\nas I can move this side yeah it's a\nfairly pronounced it started to really\ndrift in at a relaxation State and I\nstarted seeing double again so I thought\nwhoa these prism this one prism lens is\na crutch of the sort that I really don't\nwant crushed the glasses it broke them\nand it never went back to them\num I have voluntary control over it but\nthat's one example where the corrective\nlens can actually create a pretty\nsignificant shift in eye position if one\nrelies on it so this gets back to this\nissue of\num when should people Force themselves\nto work with their natural vision maybe\ndo some more far viewing\num as opposed and certainly get outside\nand get sunlight into the sunlight full\nspectrum light as opposed to relying on\nactive lenses yeah and and you've raised\na very important distinction here and\nthat's the distinction between the\nmuscles that are inside our eye that we\nuse to relax and refocus the lens and\nthe muscles that are on the outside of\nthe eyeball of course inside our orbit\nbut on the outside of the eyeball that\nturn the eyes and if everything's\nworking right keeps our eyes really\nyoked straight and we talked about\nearlier uh this possibility that you may\nhave been having a little bit of\nintermittent esotropia or intermittent\nturning in of the eyes that then\nculminated on that day of a day at the\npool when you really noticed it\nand your ongoing ability to actually\nturn one eye in could be related to that\nI remember as a kid standing in front of\nthe mirror and I I couldn't get my eyes\nto cross even though friends could do it\nand you know so you know I I was in the\nlosing group on that on that end you\nbecame an ophthalmologist and then I\nbecame an ophthalmologist and I must say\nit is very reassuring that you have\nexcellent Vision you know I always worry\nwhen I go to a new dentist and then I\nlook up at them in one moment and if\nthey're not wearing a mask that their\nteeth are not you know pristine I think\nwell what am I doing here so at you know\nan ophthalmologist with excellent Vision\nbrings me uh great comfort the toddler's\nchildren should have shoes right exactly\num but yeah so so when to correct when\nnot to correct with lenses and I realize\nhere we haven't talked at all about\ncontacts we've been talking about\neyeglasses yeah let's come to contacts\nin a sec if you want but yeah let me\nreturn to your question the difference\nbetween providing corrective lenses that\nallow you to focus for near or distance\nuh in your glasses so that you can go\neasy on the inside the eye eye muscle\nhaving to work so hard a lot of people\nget eye strain and sort of uh headaches\neven from that from not having adequate\ncorrection that they're wearing that's\ndifferent actually especially when we're\nchildren or again into that maybe even\ninto the teens and even young adult\nyears\nfrom the eye muscles on the outside of\nthe eyes which are supposed to be yoking\nour eyes straight and so that you have\nthem both looking at the same point in\nspace and and there it's actually quite\na common treatment to try to under\ncorrect and ask people to exercise and\nnot just give a prism that says hey if\nyour eyes in sometime we'll use a prism\nso the light sort of looks right to you\nbut rather under correct that and sort\nof really force you to exercise trying\nto yoke your two eyes straight together\nand so that's that's in contrast and\nthey're actually I think many\noptometrists who often specialize in in\nwhat are the right glasses to give in a\nsituation like that wherever possible\nespecially during\nuh development as our bodies are\ndeveloping as we're sort of growing in\nour younger years uh take the approach\nof intentionally trying to under correct\nnot use a prism or not use a full prism\ncorrection uh and um to really help uh\nsometimes it's also like an\naccommodative reflex that your eyes are\njust you're spending so much time\nreading it near when you read it near\nyour eyes actually naturally turn in a\nlittle bit to focus uh at that nearer so\nthat they can be looking at the same\nword on the page and that can also if\nyou've got kind of too much muscle drive\nyou can overshoot that and so sometimes\njust using not a prism but like a little\nbit of a plus lens in kids just so they\ndon't have to work quite so hard to turn\ntheir eyes in and sort of over exercise\nthose muscles these are all great\nexamples we're going to an eye care\nprovider often for these kinds of issues\nan optometrist is the right first place\nto start\nyou'd like to say that every optometrist\nand every ophthalmologist is always\ngoing to give the exact right thing for\nfor each kid or young adult or older\nadult to do and and we wish all medical\ncare providers were were always right on\nTarget and a lot of times it's a perfect\nscience but a lot of times it's an\nimperfect science and so it could be\nthat at least with you know we're now 20\n25 30 years later but like it could be\nthat today that 20 year old version of\nyourself would have been given a\ndifferent uh approach to having one eye\nintermittently occasionally turning in\nlike that is there any real value to\num near far exercises you know so-called\npencil push-ups or a smooth Pursuit\ntracking I've talked a little bit about\nit before on the podcast but that was\nyou know some time ago so what are your\nthoughts on on that is there any value\nwhatsoever I mean they require a little\nbit of work just like going to the gym\nbut you know you know 25 reps a day of\nnear far\num especially as one is transitioning\nfrom age 30 to age 50\num is it worthwhile yeah is it harmful\nin any way definitely not harmful and\nagain uh you know would it slow down or\nsort of uh slow down your progression to\npresbyopia or needing those reading\nglasses uh could be some people also\ndevelop\num sort of uh you know a real failure to\nproperly turn their eyes in and so they\nactually would benefit if you've been\ndiagnosed with that inability or having\ndouble vision at near but not at\ndistance\num so that kind of convergence in\ninsufficiency for example then then\npencil push-ups off and get prescribed\nas a way to try to exercise those skills\nand you know uh in your eye muscles I\nshould interrupt here and just tell\npeople for those of you that are\nlistening not watching the pencil\npush-up we can put a link to it in the\nshow note caption so it's essentially\ntaking a pen or pencil looking at it at\num at arm's distance and then slowly\nmoving it toward your nose and\ndeliberately working hard and it is a\nbit of effort to continue to focus on it\nat a close distance at some point it\nwill become blurry because I can't cross\nmy eyes any further unless I become a\ncyclops and then moving it back out\nagain and doing that for you know 10 to\n25 repetitions maybe once or twice a day\na few times a week that's what those are\npencil push-ups yeah yeah so\num you're certainly not going to hurt\nanything there are other situations\nwhere those really do get prescribed and\nthere's definitely some good clinical\ntrial data suggesting that they can\nactually help for example recovery from\nconcussion a lot of people actually\none of the really telling ways to\ndiagnose concussion and this can be\nconcussion from sports or a fall or you\nknow any any source of concussion your\nsmooth Pursuit which is the ability\nlet's say I've got a DOT moving around\nin a circle on a screen and I'm\nfollowing that thought with my eyes my\neyes should be able to very smoothly\nfollow that circle around\nwatching a hockey game is that like your\nbody fan right like that you know just\nfollowing a ball you know following any\nmovement with smooth Pursuits of your\neyes\nand after concussion that actually those\nsystems in our brain the sort of\nreflexive ability to properly follow\nthat use that visual input to tell your\neye muscles exactly where to move\ngets disrupted and so all of a sudden\nyour smooth Pursuit starts to look\nchoppy it's not so smooth anymore and\nit's actually a way to diagnose and\nfollow recovery from concussion and part\nof the visual rehab sort of neuro rehab\none of the approaches being used and\nfurther studied still in recovery from\nconcussion is actually doing those kinds\nof exercises like pencil push-ups or\nbasically what you've described is\nfocusing from far away to focusing near\nand doing that back and forth and using\nthat to sort of like help regain uh the\ntighter control of our eye movements and\nthat eye brain connection so if\ntraumatic brain injury causes deficits\nin smooth Pursuit eye movements and some\nof the recovery protocols for traumatic\nbrain injury are to have people do\nsmooth Pursuit protocols and pencil\npush-ups are these also the sorts of\nthings that anyone can just do I mean\nwhenever possible we like to share tools\nfor various aspects of Health on this\npodcast but of course we don't want\npeople cowboying this stuff in a way\nthat could be detrimental to their to\ntheir Vision so is it okay to get on\nYouTube and find a smooth Pursuit um\nTool uh we can put a link to these there\nthere are several of them\num and people spend a few minutes doing\nthis yeah\nyou're definitely not going to hurt\nanything so totally fine to do it and\nsome people may notice you know like\nthey feel a little more visually active\nif they do these kinds of exercises\num I think most people would do them and\nnot notice something in their daily life\nwe actually have\num\nmade so much progress you know in\nresearch in thinking about how do we\ntake the diseased or dysfunctioning or\naging eye and get it back to healthy and\nnormal\nbut there's a whole other area of\nscience that's we're really just barely\ntouching we've actually we've actually\njust opened a vision performance center\nto really get at not just how do we\nrehab the sick eye back to health but\nwhat's the difference between\nfunctioning normally and functioning\nabove normally\nfor example athletes when they get\nstudied for visual Vision\ncharacteristics they have faster visual\nreflexes higher visual Acuity uh how\nmuch of that was you know genetic how\nmuch of that is trained we don't really\nunderstand could we train all of us with\nyou know normal vision to get up to\nSupra normal vision these are like great\nimportant questions that are really\nrelevant to you know every regular\nperson of course you know people doing\nEsports and the gaming communities and\nathletes is part of what we're studying\nin the vision performance center but\nthese are really really big\nopportunities to try to understand how\ndo we move people from normal vision to\nSuper normal vision and there's evidence\nthat you can do it so here's a great\nexample some athletes train\nusing these special goggles that\nactually use electrical signals in the\nglasses part of the goggles to actually\nblack out your vision one thirtieth of\nevery second two thirtieths of every\nsecond three thirtieths of every second\nnow imagine you and I are passing a\nbasketball back and forth except you're\nwearing goggles and all of a sudden\nyou're only getting 90 percent of the\ndata of where's that basketball on its\nway to my hands now you're only getting\neighty percent now you're only getting\n70 percent of that visual information\nand you are practicing right you are\ngetting good at catching a basketball\nwhen you only have a fraction of the\nvisual information and now I put you\nback on the basketball court without the\ngoggles you might be really good at\npassing that basketball around and\ncatching that basketball right and so\nthe idea that we could train and\nunderstand the biology of training to\nget the eyes from normal to supernormal\nPerformance I think it's an amazing area\nand one that we've really just started\nto dig into that's fantastic so this is\na a new program at Stanford through the\ndepartment of Ophthalmology is it linked\nup at all with the woosai performance\nInstitute yeah actually there's been a\nlot of focus over the years I think in\nhuman performance and there's actually a\nnew human performance uh Alliance and\nCenter we've we've we've long had really\nrun through the department of our\nOrthopedics a human performance\nlaboratory that's really you know much\nmore about joints and muscles and\nstrength and conditioning and stretching\nto layer on to that now a real\nunderstanding of how vision is operating\nyou know it's interesting let's go back\nto the example of concussion you know\nwe've got I don't know about 800 Varsity\nstudent athletes and all the different\nsports at Stanford and you might have a\nstudent athlete come in and say you know\nsomething doesn't feel right I got a\nlittle hit on the head I feel like my\nvision is a little bit messed up maybe\nI've got a mild concussion you could\nimagine doing some of these tests on\nsome of these performance athletes for\nexample and saying well gosh you look\nnormal\nbut actually they used to be operating\nat a supernormal rate and this is a\nnoticeable decrement for them and so\njust starting to study and understand\nwhat's the difference between normal and\nsupernormal how do we go back and forth\nbetween those two how do we measure that\ndifference and maybe ultimately how do\nwe train into that difference I think\nit's going to be exciting and not just\nfor athletes you know for for regular\npeople you know you talk about driving\nat night is there a solution where we\ncould train our eyes to be better at\ndriving at night and I don't know maybe\nreduce the number of accidents that\nhappen out in the world so well\ncertainly there's\num physical training protocols which are\nredefining what a 60 year old or 70 year\nold\ncould look like and feel like and be\nable to perform like why not do the same\nfor vision\num so I don't think there's anything\nSupernatural or greedy about doing it I\nthink that's the excitement of biology\nand neuroplasticity that you can extend\nit forward as opposed to just trying to\nwire up correctly during development\nthis is a perfect time for me to ask you\na question that I'd love a clear answer\non if it's possible it's not always\npossible which is\ncould you define 2020 vision and a few\nof the variants so that any person could\nunderstand it so we think of 2020 as\nperfect vision what does that mean what\nwould degraded Vision look like\nwhatever those numbers are and then what\nwould above normal super normal vision\nlook like yeah and is it true that\nfighter pilots have Supra normal vision\nyeah that's another population like like\nlike many athletes of of people who may\nhave sort of better than normal vision\n2020 you know we Define almost\neverything we do based on you know kind\nof a average not sick human being adult\nwhatever it is right and so 2020 Vision\nmeans that you can read the smallest\nletters at 20 feet away that the average\nhealthy person can read\nat 20 feet away so you can read at 20\nwhat they can read at 20. okay now if\nyou have worse than 20 20 Vision maybe\nyou have 20 25 Vision 2040 Vision maybe\nyou have 2200 Vision which on the eye\nchart at the office is like the Big E at\nthe very top is 2200 Vision that means\nyou can read at 20 feet what a normal\nperson could read at 200 feet right so\nyou've got pretty limited lower Vision\nwe can measure down to like 2400 2800 at\nthat point we're getting into like gosh\ncan you count how many fingers I'm\nholding up you know that kind of thing\nand then ultimately hand motion can you\neven tell if my hand is moving in this\nside of your vision or this side of your\nvision\nand then ultimately after that light\nperception can you tell if the room\nlights are on or off right and that's\nkind of the edge of of being actually\nfully blind we call Legal blindness in\nthe United States typically 2200 or\nworse and is it true that there are\npeople who are legally blind that are\nout there driving as we're having this\nconversation I I have to imagine that\nthat is unfortunately the case but it\nshouldn't be because those people\nobviously are really severely impaired\nand and that's obviously quite dangerous\nso so so that's 20 20. now\nit gets worse 2040 2080 20 100 can it\nget better yeah it turns out that people\ncan be sort of on the other end of that\ncurve and so we could have athletes and\nfighter pilots or people who have had\nLASIK surgery who are 2015\n2010. if you're 2010 that means you can\nsee it 20 feet what the average person\nneeds to be only 10 feet away to see\nright and so you've got better than\nnormal vision and people do get to that\nthrough a variety of ways and so it is\npossible to have better than 20 20\nvision\ndoes the degree of visual Acuity because\nthat's really what we're talking about\nhere differ dramatically between the two\neyes\nin most healthy people know\num you know remember we talked about\nyou're born with something like 2200\nVision takes you a couple of years and\nit can be a little bit asymmetric 2200\nVision yeah that reminds me um I've seen\nimages of what babies can see you know\nparents love looking at their child and\nthinking their child is looking right\nback at them and indeed often the child\nis looking right back at them and your\nface to your child sorry to break this\nto you folks is incredibly blurry even\nat that close distance for probably the\nfirst six to eight months events before\nyou come into sharp relief they're not\nseeing the fine details of your face\nyeah so smile big that's right smile\nbreak keep those eyebrows dark right and\nkeep cooing at them because they can\nhear pretty well that's right yeah the\nOptics of newborn babies are just\ndreadfully bad yeah but they need\nvisuals now other species not you know\nHawks\nRaptors owls that hunt uh they can\nnaturally have 2010 28 Vision right so\nmuch better vision and that's just their\nnormal vision as best as has been\nmeasured so so there's definitely the\npotential for us to have better than 20\n20 Vision now all of this we call Visual\nAcuity and just to be clear for everyone\nthat's the vision in the very center of\nyour vision like when you're reading or\nlooking that's the very center of your\nvision\nour vision is actually described\nvariably as a hill of vision the peak is\nin the center that's let's say 2020 in\nmost people right but it's it's normal\nto have that slope off and our visual\nAcuity your ability to read the eye\nchart on the edges of your vision if you\ncan read the Big E that's pretty normal\nlike you would be 2200 out on the edges\nof your vision and we would feel like\nyep that's pretty normal\num so so our highest Acuity Visions in\nthe center and that's a big part of why\nwe spend a lot of time using those eye\nmuscles to look around right we gotta we\ngotta get a little bit of a high Acuity\nview of what's around us uh fill in fill\nin the gaps of what our what our brain\nis is interpreting our peripheral world\nto look like it's almost like we have\ntwo visual systems we have a high Acuity\nHigh pixel density camera in the middle\nand then surrounding that is a pretty\nlow resolution but very fast detector\ncamera yes yeah yeah you mentioned Lasik\nbut I want to make sure that before we\ntalk about Lasik that we talk a little\nbit about contact lenses is there any\ndetriment to having a piece of glass or\na piece of plastic on the front of your\neye all the time and the reason I ask is\nnot because I think we should live\nnecessarily exactly like our ancestors\nbut it's a pretty bizarre adaptation\nto put a lens directly onto the front of\nthe eye you have to imagine that the\ncells and tissues there are accustomed\nto getting a certain amount of oxygen\nthey're accustomed to get a certain\namount of interaction with the\nenvironment and and you also are now\nadding another surface the way that the\ntears are going to interact with the\num you know with the cornea of the eye\nare probably changed and who knows maybe\nit doesn't make any negative difference\nat all but you know putting a contact\nlens on the front of the eye is you know\nabout as close to putting a device on\nyour brain as I can think of except for\nmaybe the cochlear uh implant yeah yeah\nthat's a great question now first of all\num I want to distinguish uh there are a\nfew really medical uses for different\nkinds of contact lenses like scleral\ncontact lenses for people of certain\ndiseases there are other kinds but I\nthink what we really want to talk about\nright now is just kind of the\nrun-of-the-mill I want to get my\nprescription taken care of but instead\nof wearing glasses I'm going to wear\ncontacts\ncontacts even the newest generation\ncontacts yes they sort of uh change the\ntier Dynamics on the surface of your eye\nthey\num they decrease the oxygen you know\ndiffusion that's just sort of out in the\nair onto the surface of our eye onto the\ncells that are on the surface of our eye\nbut most of us especially as we're\nyounger have enough tear film Reserve\nenough oxygen Reserve that we can easily\ntolerate these polymer gel soft contact\nlenses and and wear them happily the\nadvantage of contact lenses over glasses\npurely from the perspective of\ncorrecting your vision is that there's\ndifferent elements of of of of of the\nshape of your eye that need to be\ncorrected if you need corrective lenses\nand so for example if you're for the\nbasketball shape of your eye is a little\ntoo steep or a little too shallow that's\nwhat the standard glasses correct you\nmay have been told that you have\nsomething called astigmatism that's\nwhere instead of having a basketball\nshaped eye you have a slightly football\nshaped die it's not round in the same\ndimensions on both axes and again\nglasses can correct that but then\nthere's higher order aberrations in our\ncorneas in the clear window in the front\nof our eyes or or to some degree in the\nlens inside the eye that are that are\nfocusing the light that the glasses\nprescription can't correct but if you\nhave a nice smooth contact lens on the\nfront it can correct so a lot of people\nwho wear glasses and contacts will\nreport that they have a much higher\nquality of vision with their contact\nlens correction than with their glasses\ncorrection and again in service of\nenjoying the best Vision that you can\nenjoy in your daily life that's an\nupside to seeing if contacts could work\nFrio now there's another element though\nand that's like gosh is there a risk of\ncontact lenses and especially as we age\num we have less tear film reserves so\ncontacts may become less tolerable as we\nage\nand the other thing is being really good\nabout the cleaning because you know the\ncontacts can trap bacteria or fungus and\nif you get a corneal infection from a\ncontact lens it actually can be quite\ndevastating to your cornea even if you\nsuccessfully treat the infection you can\nbe left with some corneal scarring\nthankfully this happens very rarely but\nwhen it does happen it can be quite\ndifficult on you know on the person\nthereafter to sort of suffer through\nhaving maybe a scar from that infection\non the surface of their cornea that they\nthat leads to some blurring vision for\nexample so we always recommend that if\nyou're going to wear contacts that you'd\nbe really attentive to whether you're\ntolerating them well\nand then also to be really attentive to\nthe recommended use and cleaning of the\ncontact lenses I actually recommend that\neven though they're a little more\nexpensive to afford that people should\nalmost always be just using the daily\ncontact lenses that they don't have to\nclean or use for you know two weeks or\nfour week period so these are disposable\ncontacts highly disposable and I hate to\nthink of you know I don't know filling\nour oceans or what have you with uh more\nmore more polymer plastic but at least\nthe contact lenses are small and it's\nmuch safer for your eye to use a daily\ndisposable than to use a two week or a\nfour week and be responsible for the\ncleaning the other thing to be really\nresponsible about is sleeping in them\novernight because overnight when your\neyelids are closed of course now you're\ngetting even less oxygen to the surface\nof your eye actually most bacteria\nespecially many of the Infectious\nbacteria to our bodies and to the\nsurface of our eye are actually bacteria\nthat Don don't really like oxygen and so\nwe've got a low risk of getting\nbacterial infections on the surface of\nour eye but if we use contacts too much\ndon't clean them or sleep in them\novernight when our eyelids are closed\nand now there's even less oxygen kind of\nhelping keep the surface more more clean\nif you will that increases the risk a\nlot so being really good with the\nrecommended use and cleaning of the\ncontacts is critical considering daily\nuse contacts you don't have to and look\nmost contacts are going to be the two\nweek or four-week kind where you put\nthem in the cleaning solution overnight\neach time give them a good rinse and put\nthem back in the next day and again most\npeople 99.99 some percent of people are\ngoing to do just fine with that follow\nthe instructions and never get into\ntrouble\nas we age they're going to become less\ntolerable people are going to say I used\nto wear my contacts for 12 hours now my\neyes feel really dry after six or eight\nor ten hours\nmaybe some years after that they say\ngosh I could barely use it for four\nhours I only use them when I go out on a\nSaturday night uh and and that's okay\nyou can you can you can back off as you\nneed to back off but in the meantime if\nit helps you especially in the younger\ndecades if it helps you really enjoy uh\nYour Best Vision great\nwhat about UV protection in eyeglass\nlenses and or contacts\nI've dealt with many questions about\nblue light I am not somebody who\nbelieves that all blue light is terrible\nI think it's important to avoid Bright\nLights of any wavelength late at night\nif you want your melatonin production to\nbe normal and you want to sleep well it\ndoesn't matter if you're wearing blue\nblockers or not if you're just under\nblastingly Bright Lights it's going to\nsuppress your melatonin and yet some\npeople enjoy blue blockers for that\nreason nowadays A lot of people wear\nblue blocker\nglasses or blue blocking lenses or\ncontacts throughout the entire day\nthinking that blue light is bad for our\neyes during the day I happen to\nsubscribe to the idea that we want as\nmuch bright light as we safely can\ntolerate during the day ideally from\nsunlight\nin order to set our circadian rhythm and\nyet a lot of eyeglasses and a lot of\ncontact lenses out there have UV a and\nor UVB blocking features to them so what\nare your thoughts on this and I'm\nperfectly happy to be wrong and revise\nmy my stance on this\num yeah what what do you think about\nthis UV a B blocking yeah it's a good\nit's it's a it's really important to\ndistinguish that UV light on the light\nspectrum is right next to blue light red\nlights on the other end and of course\ninfrared is beyond that and our eyes\nother animals can see these but our eyes\ncan't see infrared that's why we call it\nBeyond red and we can't see ultraviolet\nwe call it Beyond violet UV light is\nright next to Blue Light UV light is\nknown to have a lot of adverse effects\nit's not really good for our skin and\ntherefore you know we really want to\navoid Sunburn and kind of UV data you\nknow exposure and damage on our skin\nsimilarly it's not really good on our\neyes and it affects both the ocular\nsurface a little bit in terms of like\nkind of how dry or irritable your eyes\nmight feel for some people and certainly\nover the long term UV light will\naccelerate the formation of cataract\nwhich is a blurring of an oxidative\nblurring of the lens inside the eye\nprofound UV light can be damaging to the\nretina if you're getting way too much on\nthe inside\nso uh so blocking UV light I believe is\njust absolutely standard in every pair\nof eyeglasses and I don't know actually\nhow much to what degree the different\nkinds of contact lenses also filter at\nleast UV light now blue blockers blue\nblocking glasses is totally different\nand\nas I say like I think almost all glasses\nbecause the Plastics almost all glasses\nare not made of glass anymore they're\nmade of plastics but I think almost all\nof them now filter the UV light which\nagain is like probably the safe move for\nour eyes and periocular environment\naround the eye environment\nso blue blockers you know that's been a\nhuge fan I'll tell you the last three\nyears through the pandemic everybody\ngetting on their computer hours in front\nof Zoom meetings where we used to walk\nfrom building to building for a meeting\nthings like that\num I you know I I remember you know like\nthis sort of big uptick in these kinds\nof questions and I'm not sure that\nthere's any data that blocking blue is\nhelpful in any way and as you say it may\nactually play into sort of circadian\nentrainment of our natural daily Rhythm\nso so I think blocking UV is a good idea\nand I think it's pretty standard you\nknow they make glasses is by the way\nthat actually react to UV light they're\ncalled transitions there may be a few\ndifferent brands I don't know uh but but\nyou know these are the sunglasses that\nare clear except then they turn dark if\nyou're out in the sunlight and it's not\njust any sunlight it's actually the UV\nwavelengths that that cause the chemical\nreaction in the glasses to turn from\nfrom Clear see-through to to sunglass\nblocked glasses\nand um\nyou may notice if you if any of you out\nthere are using these kinds of glasses\nuh that they don't work in the car\nyou'll wear them in the car and they\nwon't go to sunglasses even though it's\nsunny out and again that's because all\nstandard car glass also filters UV\nthat's why if you're riding around in\nthe car and it's sunny out you've got\nyour hand you know up next to the window\nuh wearing a t-shirt you never get a\nsunburn through the car window anymore\nbecause all our car glasses also\nfiltering UV light for us so so that's a\nvery informative answer and before we\nstarted recording you and I were\ndiscussing this practice of morning\nsunlight viewing which again I highly\nrecommend over and over and you pointed\nout that low solar angle sunlight so\nsunlight low in the sky viewed for maybe\n10 minutes a morning and again not\nforcing oneself to look at it and stare\nbut blinking as needed is not going to\ncause extensive UV damage to the eyes\nit's really the when the sun is directly\noverhead that we're getting a lot of UV\nwhich raises this other question which\nis for people that don't wear corrective\nlenses and therefore are not blocking UV\nlight to the eyes\num what should they do are they in\ntrouble should they be wearing a brimmed\nhat brimmed Hat's a great idea that I've\ngot a rid of a lot of the direct light\ninto the eye of course you still have\nreflected light off of surfaces and that\nthat can include UV light of course\num you know wearing sunglasses outside\neven if you don't have corrective lenses\nyou know it's may also be more\ncomfortable to wear sunglasses outside\num so so these are all fine you know\nat the end of the day it's probably not\nmaking a huge difference in the health\nof your eye whether you've spent the\nlast 50 years wearing sunglasses really\ndogmatically for your outdoor time or\nnot you know if you were going to\ndevelop let's just say age-related\ncataracts inside your eyes which\nwe'll all get if we all live to 120 we\nall get cataracts you know it's going to\nhappen some people younger some people\nolder maybe if you were really dogmatic\nabout wearing your UV blocking\nsunglasses maybe you'd get your your\ncataracts at 75 years old instead of 72\nyears old it may not be a huge\ndifference in that regard so again not\nsomething to be super stressed I think\nit's I think it's more a question of\njust what are you comfortable in uh and\nthen certainly I will say the the other\nadvantage of a wide brim hat is it's\nkeeping sun off of your face and these\nare the you know some of the especially\nthe upturned portions of your face like\nthe cheeks and the nose these are the\nsome of the most common places to get\nsome of the skin cancers that you can\nget over a lifetime of sunlight exposure\nso you know the wide brain app is it's\nhelping you for that as well\ncan't help but ask about comfort\nat varying levels of brightness I'm the\nperson that when sitting in a cafe or\nsomething and on a bright day I can be\ndirectly across from somebody like you\nwho seems to be perfectly fine without\nsunglasses and maybe even more shaded\nunder an umbrella or something of that\nsort and I'm squinting like crazy\nis it normal for there to be a pretty\nwide variation in sensitivity to light\nand does this have anything to do with\nthe lightness or darkness of the eyes\nyou have brown eyes I have green eyes\nbut is there any real correlation there\nyeah you know it's a good question I\ndon't know if it's been formally studied\nbut I will tell you like I have the same\nimpression you do which is that if you\nhave uh blue eyes or light-colored eyes\nthat you're more likely to have more\nsensitivity we know that there's\ndifferences in the iris muscles that\nconstrict and dilate in response to\nlight\nfor example when you go into your eye\ncare provider and they're going to do a\ndilated exam and they put the eye drops\nin your eye that dilate the eyes they\nsort of change the the nerve impulses\nonto the iris muscles of the iris\ndilates and you get those big big open\neyes\num people with blue eyes we absolutely\nknow blue or Hazel or light colored eyes\nuh you put that eye drop to dilate there\nrise it's going to last four six eight\nhours whereas in a brown-eyed person\noften the dilation only lasts one two\nfour hours so there's clearly biological\ndifferences between the irises and their\nmuscles and maybe the nerves that feed\nthose muscles uh between light-eyed\npeople and and darker eyed people and\nthat may also therefore relate to this\ndifferential sensitivity that some\npeople have you know if you're not able\nto constrict your eyes in the bright\nlight as effectively you're going to\nfind that bright light more frustrating\nmore annoying uh you know even painful\npeople will feel like their eyes are\ncramping almost as they try to get that\nthose eye muscles to activate to bring\ndown the pupil and block some of that\nexcess light from getting in interesting\nyeah let's go back to Lasik what is\nLASIK and\nshould I get Lasik eye surgery does it\ndoes everyone need Lasik can it help\nevery can it make us you know\nsuprophysiological you know can it make\nme a 2010. you know often it can I'll\njust say that you know right up front it\nis amazing people will come out of Lasik\nsurgery uh better than 2020 but uh the\ncornea we talked about before that's the\nClear Window on the front of your eye\nall the light has to get through there\nand we talked about before already like\nif your cornea is misshapen if the\nbasketball shape of it is too too\nshallow or too steep then you're going\nto need glasses to see a distance and\nalso at near if it's to football instead\nof basketball then it's going to be what\nwe call astigmatism and uh and then you\ncan't you need a correction for that\ninstead of correcting with glasses that\nsort of help shape the light so it can\ngo through your slightly off-shaped\ncornea instead of wearing contact lenses\nwhich also shape the light just as it's\nentering your cornea right on the\nsurface of the eye you can just reshape\nthe cornea\nand the way Lasik does that there's a\nfew different versions of Lasik but\nbasically the way the Lasik does that is\nit actually ablates or uh gets rid of a\nlittle ring or rim of that corneal\ntissue\nso that for example if you were a little\nshallow and you got rid of a little bit\nof that tissue around the edge with the\nlaser the Lasik you know starts with the\nword laser if you got rid of that edge\ntissue then you're sort of making it a\nlittle more basketball shaped right or\nif you were too steep on your cornea and\nyou used the laser to kind of shave off\na little bit of the the tip of that\nbasketball right then you're flattening\nit out flattening out the cornea so it's\nthat kind of reshaping and the\ntechnology has come so far that the\nLasik procedures can actually correct\nnot just the regular aberrations that we\ntalked about but also some of these\nhigher order aberrations and there are\ndifferent monikers for this kind of\nLasik it's all I think become fairly\nstandard but wave front guided where\nit's actually using light waves to\nmeasure with a very exact localization\nexactly how much and where to laser for\neach individual eye to make that cornea\npass the light as ideally as possible\nnow one or a few percent of patients\nwill actually have a dry eye problem so\nafter a Lasik because so it does\ninterfere a little bit with those\ncorneal nerves for example and I and I\ndo think that if you're a person who\nalready has dry eye hopefully if you're\nasking your eye surgeon about Lasik\nhopefully you're being counseled that if\nyou have dry eye this might not be a\ngood idea for you just like contacts\nmight not be a good idea for you if you\nalready have a lot of dry eye but for a\nlot of people especially a lot of\nyounger people it's quite common I I\nthink the statistics suggests maybe 15\nor 20 percent of people who would\nbenefit from LASIK you know who who\nwould who would otherwise be wearing\nglasses may get Lasik at some point in\ntheir life and\num you know I used to joke\nyou know Lasik it costs more money than\na pair of glasses but\nit doesn't cost more money than 10 pairs\nof prescription glasses over the course\nof a decade or two you know and so I\nused to joke that gosh if uh if everyone\nhad to have laser eye surgery for their\nbest vision\nand someone came along and said hey I've\ngot an invention you don't have to have\nlaser eye surgery anymore it rests on\nthe ears and the bridge of your nose I\ncall them glasses could they have sold\nthose for a thousand two thousand\ndollars a pair I don't know maybe but\nyou know there's kind of a cultural\nelement of saying you know like I don't\nwant to wear glasses you know I'd love\nto be able to walk around without\nrelying on glasses or contacts of course\npeople are very athletic or spending a\nlot of their time doing Athletics they\nmay be quite irritated to have to deal\nwith glasses or contacts people who have\nvery severe prescriptions I mean if you\nwake up and you can't even really you\nknow you're fumbling for your glasses on\nthe bedside table because you have such\na strong strong prescription you can't\neven see what it says on the alarm clock\nnext to the bed you know these are all\ngroups of patients who like really\nchange their daily lives by getting out\nof glasses or contacts and taking\nadvantage of Lasik and in I don't know\n99 of the time it's going to be like a\nsafe comfortable outcome for the patient\ndo they do Lasik on kids\num there are certain conditions uh\nunusual cordial conditions where\nprocedures like Lasik get used but I\nbelieve uh it's ideal to not do it on\nchildren uh or even even young teenagers\nand the reason goes back to what we were\ntalking about before you are much more\nlikely to change the shape of your eye\nand therefore the prescription you need\nand therefore what exactly the Lasik\nwould laser while you're still in those\ngrowing years and you really want to be\nable to say hey my eyeglasses\nprescription has not changed in the last\ntwo or three or five years because if\nyou do Lasik and then your eye keeps\nchanging shape then by the next year all\nof a sudden the lasik's not doing you're\nbacking glasses again right you can do a\ntouch-up Lasik do a little bit more but\nit's generally you know you're going to\nbe a happier person if you've reached\nthat point in your life and maybe that's\nmaybe that's your late teens more\ncommonly it's into the 20s where your\neye has stopped changing its\nprescription every year you've been\nsteady and stable for some years and now\nyou do the Lasik and it could easily\nlast you a decade\nyou mentioned dry eye\nget a lot of questions about dry eye and\na few years ago I think you and I were\nat a meeting and someone\nwho is very woven in with the companies\nthat\nbuild and test drugs for different\naspects of vision health said you know\nwhat the field really needs is a\ntreatment that works for dry eye and I\nthought dry eye like of all things like\nwhy dry and then the more I learned\nabout it I realized that there are\nmillions and millions of people that\nreally suffer from dry eye and for whom\nstandard drops are just not working so\nwhat underlies dry eye is it some\ndeficiency in the lacquer hormone glands\nthat produce tears for the eye and and I\nthink of Tears as just kind of salty\nwater\nand I wonder if they are more than that\nis there an oil in there and if we know\nwhat's in tears why can't somebody just\nmanufacture something that works as well\nas tears yeah you know it turns out you\nknow we we've got a lot of other eye\ndiseases\nbut by far the most common eye disease\nand and I've been told by far the most\ncommon eye treatment you know purchased\nby anyone now granted it's almost always\nover the counter things like artificial\ntears is for dry eye\nand uh in part that's because as we age\nour\ntier quantity goes down and our tier\nquality goes down and so what do those\ndo mean\nwe have two different major elements to\ntiers and as you alluded to one is the\nsalt water porn of part of the tears and\nthose are made primarily by the lacrimal\ngland and there's a steady drip of those\ntears onto the ocular surface as well as\nreflexive tearing right if you get an\neyelash in your eye or or you cry your\nlacrimal ground will actually squeeze\nout extra salt water tears uh onto the\nsurface of the eye and so so that's\nthat's where most of the sort of wet\npart is coming from but there's also\nessential oils critical oils these come\nfrom other types of glands including\nglands in our eyelids called meibomian\nglands and the oils form a surface over\nthe salt water part of the tear film\nand and also intermix into the tears and\nas we age we go down in the quantity of\nboth salt water part of our tears and\noil part of our tears but also the\nquality and in particular the oil parts\nuh can often be seen to be going down\nmore quickly\nthe the eye drop industry has pretty\nmuch solved for replacing the salt water\npart of your tears right you can get\neither bottles of preserve preservative\ncontaining you know you could use that\nbottle all month or for a month or two\nor you can buy these strips of\npreservative free artificial tears which\nare really basically like the salt water\ncomponents and you can use those\npreservative free ones we have patients\nusing them every hour if they need to\nright you're not going to hurt anything\nwith preservative free artificial tears\nyou just drop them in just drop them in\nyeah either I as as often as you want or\nneed when you feel it it's exacerbated\nin the world we live in uh\nespecially these days now with more time\non computer it turns out that when you\nread including when we maybe used to\nread more books than we do now but also\nread on the computer or stare at the\ncomputer screen or work on the computer\nor actually just even watch the TV\nI've done very careful studies you blink\nless when you're doing any of those\nactivities\nand when you blink glass you're\nredistributing the tears less\neffectively and you're squeezing out\nless of the tears including less of the\noils as effectively as you could be when\nyou're blinking and so\num so between aging tier quality tier\nquantity\na lot of our activities\nwe're kind of in this losing proposition\nnow now I mentioned that uh we're pretty\ngood at replacing the wet salty part of\nour tears but actually as an industry we\nhaven't really figured out a\nhow to really effectively replace the\noily part and the oils do a few things\nincluding when you have a layer of oil\non top of a layer of water\nthe water is less likely to evaporate\nand so the oils help hold the tears on\nthe surface of your eye and so if we're\nnot making as many or as good oils as\npart of our tear film that's uh that's\nalso like kind of working against the\nsalt water part of our tears\num so yeah as an industry as a community\nuh that we haven't really figured out\nhow to get the oil part solved for\neither by effectively replacing the oils\nor\ntreating our eyelids in a way kind of\nrejuvenating those oil glands getting\nthem to kind of go back to their\nyouthful State again you know so that\nthe eyes including the eyelids and the\noil glands unfortunately they're aging\njust like the rest of our body so so\nthis is this this is one of the major\nfeatures uh is uh is dry eye and and uh\nand it's tough on patients because you\nfeel it it's really tough because you\nfeel it yeah I have yet another\nexperience to report where when I had\nthe blepharitis which fortunately was\ntransient I also experienced it every\ntime I would blink I could feel the\nblink and boy I'll tell you I we all\nmost of us take for granted uh what a\npleasure it is to not observe the\nblinking of our eyes because for those I\nthink in last about two weeks every time\nI blink I'd feel an almost sandpaper\nlike experience it wasn't particularly\npainful but it was very uncomfortable\nbecause it suddenly conscious of every\nblink and it's very very distracting now\nthat resolved when the blepharitis\nresolved but I can't even imagine what\nit would be like to deal with that all\nday long every day yeah really Dreadful\nyes it really is and it and so you're\nabsolutely right it's a very it's one of\nour really big unmet needs and and\nalthough for most people with dry eye it\ncan be managed with just the regular\nover-the-counter artificial teardrops\nyou can buy at the grocery store or over\nthe counter at the pharmacy for a subset\nof people who have really much more\nsevere symptoms with the dry eye it's\nit's really it's hard it's a really hard\nthing to have to live with all the time\nand and we Counsel on the use of Tears\nwe Council on the use of eyelid cleaning\nlike we talked about before where you\ntake either these eyelid scrubs or a\nlittle dilute baby shampoo to keep those\neyelashes really clean that keeps those\noil glands functioning at their top\ncapacity for you uh so that you're\nmaximizing you know high quality cheer\nproduction reducing inflammation is also\nimportant whether that's inflammation\nfrom allergy and of course a lot of\npeople's dry eye gets much worse in the\nspring with seasonal allergies when\npollen is around if you have dust\nallergies in your home uh that worsens\nyour symptomatic dry eye\nor other forms of inflammation there's a\nthere's an element of dry eye that we\nactually think is\ninflammation kind of working against our\ntear glands and and in fact some of the\nprescription drops now to help combat\nmore severe dry eye uh are\nanti-inflammatory or even low-dose\nsteroid types of eye drops\num so I think these are all uh sort of\nNext Generation treatments I think at\nthe at the really Leading Edge of Next\nGeneration treatment is trying to better\nunderstand the nerves on the cornea and\nocular surface and if there are ways\nthat we could better treat them and help\nhelp regenerate and rejuvenate kind of\nhow the nerves and the and the tissue\ncells are interacting underneath that\ntear film and that's where for some\npatients we can actually use either for\nexample blood serum your blood serum is\nactually very rich in growth factors\nand many of those growth factors it\nturns out empirically are really helpful\nfor people with dry eye so if you're one\nof those people who's been really\nstruggling with with dry eye you might\nask your eye care provider hey I heard\nabout serum tears is that something that\ncould help me serum tears because this\nPRP is this platelet-rich plasma related\nbut but not the plate platelet-rich\nportion at least not yet they can draw\nyour blood spin out all the cells you're\nleft with the kind of liquid part of\nyour blood that's the serum and then\nthey can dilute that with some salt\nwater maybe with some preservatives in\nsome cases yeah you could keep it in\nyour freezer thaw a bottle when you're\nready to use it you know each few weeks\nand and then use it just like an\neyedropper bottle and those serum tears\nuh actually can be very helpful for\npeople with with much more advanced or\nsevere hard to control dry eye symptoms\nuh companies are really trying to figure\nout hey what are the most important\nparts of the the serum can we just\nidentify and package just the growth\nfactor and uh and turn that into a\nproduct for dry eye patients and so\nthere's a lot of research on the ocular\nsurface and dry eye uh going into\num going into that space right now I'll\ntell you the one other recommendation\nthat I always give patients\nthere's a fair amount of evidence that\nif you're getting too much of some of\nthese preservative chemicals which of\ncourse if you're going to use an eye\ndrop bottle for a month it should have a\npreservative in it right so that you\nknow open the bottle and then it grows\nbacteria a couple weeks later and now\nyou're you're you know you're using\ncontaminated eye drops so for bottles\nit's typical to have preservatives but I\nreally recommend for patients if they're\nusing anything more than a couple drops\nhere and there for their dry eye control\nto actually go for one of the\npreservative free artificial tears they\ncome in lots of Brands I'm sure the\nhouse brands at any of the pharmacies\nuse them too I make them too and these\nare the ones that come in like strips\nplastic strips and you break one off you\nbreak off the little cap you can use as\nmuch as you want all day you have to\nthrow that one out if you have anything\nleft over you have to throw it out at\nthe end of the night and the next day\nbreak off a new one because there's no\npreservatives and once you open it you\ndon't want bacteria to grow in that salt\nwater right but it's really good because\nthe preservatives can be very irritating\nor even inflammatory to the ocular\nsurface to the surface of our eyes so we\nreally do want to if we're using more\nthan a drop or two\nupgrade that cost a little bit more\nmoney if they're still over the counter\nupgrade yourself to the preservative\nfree artificial tears those are great\nrecommendations I'm also really\ninterested in this serum\nthing uh because you know we're this\ndiscussion taking place 10 years ago and\nI raise PRP platelet-rich plasma there\nwould probably be a lot of eye rolls no\npun intended because I think myself and\na lot of other people in the let's call\nthe sort of standard scientific and\nmedical community looked at\nplatelet-rich plasma right alongside\nstem cell therapies because they were\ncheek to jowl back then as you recall\nbefore the FDA regulations about stem\ncell claims which we will get to\num of course\nPRP was suggested as a source of stem\ncells it turns out there are very few if\nany true stem cells in PRP and yet now\nas I understand it PRP is an FDA\napproved protocol for injection into the\nuterus injection into pretty much every\ntissue and organ system of the body in\norder to quote unquote rejuvenate it and\nhere I'm not promoting PRP and yet it is\na very common practice now in more\nstandard medical clinics but it started\noff kind of Niche even gray Market kind\nof underground it's diverged from stem\ncell therapies and we're going to talk\nabout major modes of vision loss in a\nmoment\nand this horrible situation that\nhappened down in Florida of a clinic\ninjecting stem cells into patients eyes\nto recover vision and it actually\nblinded them so we'll talk about stem\ncell therapies but for the record is PRP\nsomething that's now standard in major\noptimal ophthalmic clinics excuse me\nincluding your department at Stanford\nare you drawing out blood spinning it\ndown taking plasma taking serum and\nre-injecting it or reapplying it to\npatients eyes not not yet in\nOphthalmology uh in eye clinics I I\nwould say we're sort of like right now\non the edge of uh groups are starting to\nstudy that is it safe is it valuable is\nit any better for certain conditions\nlike on the ocular surface than serum\nTears For example this sort of diluting\na patient's own own blood serum uh so so\nit's being studied it's a very active\narea now it turns out that this PRP\nplasma has uh you know again like a high\nconcentration nation of growth factors\nthat's probably what's responsible for a\nlot of the kind of quote tissue\nRejuvenation effects uh be that be they\nas they may but but it's being studied\nbut it's definitely not a standard of\ncare yet uh at least in in Ophthalmology\nspace and and you know I think whenever\nthere's something really new it really\ndeserves to be properly studied we\ntalked before about you know at first\nyou're going to do trials where you just\ntest it carefully in a few people maybe\na few of the most severely effective\naffected patients be really thoughtful\nabout uh you know the ethics of trying\nout for safety then as you develop a\nlittle understanding of the safety you\nreally want to eventually get to\nproperly controlled randomized what\npeople in the community often call\ndouble blind trials but we in\nOphthalmology like to call Double masked\ntrials blind is a bad word\ntrials yeah yeah so you really want\nproperly controlled trials testing is it\nreally working thing is it really\ndeserve the claims that people are\nmaking and that has not yet really come\nto fruition at that level for\nOphthalmology or Eye Care yet so we've\nbeen talking a lot about normal visual\ndevelopment eye checks and some of the\nmore typical challenges that people have\nwith their vision\nbut we haven't yet touched on some of\nthe really debilitating stuff\nthings like glaucoma things like\nretinitis Pigmentosa macular\ndegeneration the things that if we could\nwe would all avoid and yet are out there\nin the world at pretty high rates you\nknow I'm sure you'll share with us what\nthose rates are\nand as bad as these things are there are\nways to detect and offset their\nprogression so that people don't\nnecessarily lose their Vision so if you\ncould could you share with us what are\nthe major forms of vision loss in\nchildhood and in adulthood and what can\neach and all of us do in order to find\nout if we have one of these conditions\nand therefore treat it effectively yeah\nthat's great you know\nlet's start by just\nreminding ourselves what are the major\ncauses of vision loss and these are\ngoing to differ where you are in the\nworld\nbut the major the number one cause of\nlow vision is actually refractive error\npeople who need glasses and especially\nin other countries affordability access\ncan't even get glasses okay so that's\njust refractive error but that's\nfundamentally correctable\nthe next most common cause of vision\nloss is cataract cataract is the\nblurring the Aging of the lens inside\nthe eye behind the cornea we talked\nabout how that is responsible for\nfocusing light under the back of the eye\nit also has to be clear enough that the\nlight gets through the lens\nand a cataract is a normal aging process\nyou know as I said if we all live to 100\nor 110 years old we'll all get cataracts\nwe'll all need cataract surgery we\nactually is you know in in the eye\nclinic we see cataracts years or even\ndecades before they're affecting your\nvision in a meaningful way so that the\ncataracts are forming and that's okay\nbut at some point they get bad enough\nthat it's time to take them out we've\nactually solved for cataract surgery\npretty efficiently we could do a four to\neight minute surgery maybe if we're\ntaking our time it's 10 or 12 minutes of\nsurgical time take out a cataract it\nworks beautifully 99 point something\npercent of the time we put a plastic a\nclear plastic lens inside the eye\nexactly where your lens used to be and\nthere's even lenses that can Flex or\nfocus light from far and near so\ncataracts is fundamentally a there's\nstill room for improvement but there's\nit's fundamentally a solved problem the\nproblem is is that worldwide there\naren't enough cataract surgeons there's\nnot access to care the Machinery or the\nlenses\ncost too much money in developing\ncountries to get out to the number of\npeople who would need them so it's\nactually just again an access to care\ncataract is a reversible treatable\neasily treatable problem\nbut it's number two on the list of\ncauses of vision loss in the world\nbecause we don't have enough access to\ncare we need a lot more sort of\nprogramming around Global Ophthalmology\nGlobal Eye Care to solve for cataract\njust to bring that solution to countries\naround the world\nthen after that you start hitting the\neye diseases that lead to what are\ncurrently irreversible\nnon-reversible causes of vision loss the\nnumber one cause of irreversible vision\nloss in the world is glaucoma\nso what is glaucoma glaucoma is actually\nprobably a little cluster or\nconstellation of diseases that we lump\ntogether it's a degenerative disease\nlike a neurodegeneration we talk about\nneurodegenerations in the brain like\nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's glaucoma is\na neurodegenerative disease it happens\ninstead of affecting one or different\narea in your brain it happens to affect\nthe optic nerve that connects the eye to\nthe brain and we need our optic nerves\nto carry all the visual information from\nthe eye to the brain and so if your\noptic nerve is degenerating in glaucoma\nand I should add there are other optic\nneuropathies so-called diseases of optic\nnerve degeneration for example you can\nget a stroke of the optic nerve you can\nhave an inflammatory disease like\nmultiple sclerosis called optic neuritis\nthat affects the optic nerve so you can\nget other optic nerve diseases but\nglaucoma is by far the most common optic\nneuropathy and the problem is is just\nlike you know just like spinal cord\ninjury which is also part of the central\nnervous system right the brain the\nspinal cord the rat and the optic nerve\nthat's the central nervous system and\nthere's no regeneration and that's why\nspinal cord injury leads to permanent\nparalysis well optic nerve injury or\noptic nerve degeneration unfortunately\nleads to permanent vision loss so in the\ncase of glaucoma how do we get ahead of\nthat\nglaucoma has two major risk factors one\nis increasing age there are actually\ninfantile and pediatric glaucomas\nunfortunately and those can be much more\naggressive much more damaging when they\npresent so early in kids uh in babies\nand in children\nmost of the kind of run-of-the-mill\nglaucoma usually results presents in\nadulthood and even in in the Aging\nadults so much more common after 50 or\n60 or 70 years old increasing the other\nmain risk factor for glaucoma is\nincreasing eye pressure the eye actually\nyou know it stays inflated it's a\nballoon it has to stay inflated we need\nsome amount of eye pressure to keep our\neye as a as an inflated balloon but if\nthe eye pressure goes too high and we\ntalked about this before you won't even\nfeel it if it slowly gets too high if\nthe eye pressure goes too high that\ncauses glaucoma and\num and that's one of the things that we\ntalked about you really include in a\ncomprehensive eye exam when you're just\ngetting a screening checkup at your eye\ncare provider at your optometrist or\nophthalmologist office they're going to\ncheck your pressure and just as a\nscreening tool check to make sure it's\nnot too high\nwe can treat glaucoma today\nby trying to reduce the impact of that\nhigh pressure by lowering the eye\npressure so we have treatments for\nglaucoma that Target the eye pressure we\nhave medications like eye drops we have\nlasers that can be used inside the eye\nthat can also lower the eye pressure and\nultimately if we need them we also have\nsurgeries that can also provide an\noutflow that lets the fluid out of the\neye in a controlled way so that the eye\npressure can be brought back down into\nnormal ranges\nagain the reason that glaucoma\nends up being the number one cause of\nirreversible blindness in the world is\nnumber one\nwe can't get those therapies everywhere\nin the world the affordability of eye\ndrops the access to lasers or surgical\nprocedures Around The World Isn't equal\nto what it is here and even within our\ncountry you know people may not be\naccessing Health Care effectively to get\nscreened for glaucoma or to get treated\nfor glaucoma the other big problem with\nglaucoma is that it affects our\nperipheral vision first and only very\nlate in the disease does it pinch in and\nfinally pinch off the center of our\nvision in typical glaucomas\nand that's a real problem because\nwe don't notice if our peripheral vision\nis down you know our peripheral vision\nisn't that good to begin with and if\nyou're driving and you can see a\npedestrian step off the sidewalk you\nthink your peripheral vision is fine but\nactually your peripheral vision could\nalready start being damaged by glaucoma\nand you won't notice it in regular daily\nlife and that's where the importance of\nscreening and early detection really\ncomes in for glaucoma\nwhat we don't have for glaucoma we can\ncome back to like kind of what's The\nCutting Edge of the future in these eye\ndiseases what we don't have are\ntreatments that really Target the optic\nnerve degenerative process and we can\ncome back and talk about that\nso that's glaucoma and optic\nneuropathies then the next two major\ncauses of currently largely irreversible\nvision loss our age-related macular\ndegeneration\nand then diabetic retinopathy now\nage-related macular generation is just\nlike it sounds major risk factors age\nit's very common and actually in the\ndeveloped world you know countries that\nare more developed also countries that\nhave a larger Caucasian white population\nit's more common in certain populations\nthan in others\num it actually is you know definitely a\nleading cause of vision loss in the\nelderly population for example in the\nUnited States\num and uh there's two forms of macular\ndegeneration but they both end up\ntargeting the same part the same part of\nthe retina and the part of the retina is\nreally like the rods and the cones that\nwe talked about before the rods do your\nlow light vision at night time primarily\nyour cones do color vision and bright\nlight you know sort of normal lighting\nthat we experience you know through most\nof our awake day\nand in that back of the retina you can\nhave what's called dry macular\ndegeneration which is a slow thankfully\nslow but slow Insidious disease that\ncauses the degeneration of the rods and\ncones and also the support cells that\nhelp feed the rods and cones and take\ncare of the rods and cons they're called\nrpe cells retinal pigment epithelium\nit's not really critical of course the\nnames of every different cell type but\nthese are like the the the light\ncollecting cells in our eyes in the\nretina and they degenerate in macular\ndegeneration and in the dry form there's\nthis slow degeneration but some percent\nof people with the dry form of macular\ngeneration will actually convert to\nWhat's called the wet form it's called\nwet because new blood vessels actually\ngrow inappropriately under and even into\nthe retina and new blood vessels unlike\nour mature blood vessels tend to be\nleaky and so now the flu fluid leaks out\nof those blood vessels gets into the\nretina interferes with vision and that\ncan lead to a much more acute loss of\nvision now we have some treatments for\nwet macular degeneration we have\ninjections that can go into the eye that\nactually fight against the molecules\nthat are causing those new blood vessels\nto grow and these are antibodies that\ncan be injected into the eye and they\ncan be very effective controlling\npatients wet macular degeneration\nit's been a much bigger uphill battle\neven over the last decade as advances\nare being made to to really try to knock\nback or or slow down even the dry form\nof macular degeneration there was just\nsome exciting news even just in the last\nfew months the first uh successful\nTrials of a treatment for the dry form\nuh have just shown success and properly\nrandomized controlled human clinical\ntrials phase three clinical trials so\nit's an exciting time\nthose new treatments are not going to be\na Panacea they slow the progression like\nthe an anatomic progression of the\ndisease\nuh maybe by 20 or 25 so so patients are\nstill going to get worse even with those\ntreatments so there's still a lot more\nto be done to really knock back macular\ndegeneration I want to mention you\nmentioned retinitis Pigmentosa that's\nlike an inherited form of a type of\nmacular degeneration it's also affecting\nthe rods and cones and also the support\ncells the rpe cells in the back of the\neye retinized Pigmentosa is an inherited\nform\nthere are actually many different genes\nyou could have that could leave to\nretinized pigments Pigmentosa in\naggregate if you add up all the people\nwith all those different genes uh and it\ncan be very devastating because it can\nreally affect the vision knock out your\nvision very early in life including in\nchildren and even versions of that and\nbabies but you add that all up it's\nstill much less common in aggregate than\nmacular degeneration\nbut in a way it's you know quite a bit\nmore severe because it does affect\npeople much earlier in life so so I sort\nof Clump those together macular\ndegeneration retinitis Pigmentosa\ndegeneration of the rods and cones and\nthe support cells the rpe support cells\nand then you you can't have this part of\nthe discussion about what are the\ndevastating eye diseases without\nbringing up diabetic retinopathy\nespecially because diabetes\nunfortunately really continues to grow\nin especially let's say in the United\nStates certainly in the developed world\nyou know as we\num especially type 2 diabetes with\neating habits exercise habits\ncontributing to a proliferation of some\nof the risk factors for type 2 diabetes\nmetabolic syndrome obesity\nwe're unfortunately seeing a\nproliferation a growth in the number of\npeople with diabetes and with the growth\nin diabetes unfortunately comes the\ngrowth of the complications of diabetes\nand one of the major complications of\ndiabetes is damage to the retina inside\nthe eye and we call that diabetic\nretinopathy and there again some of the\nsame\ndamage that occurs\nespecially when in diabetes again some\nnew blood vessels are growing or blood\nvessels are leaky some of that can be\ntreated with it used to be lasers and\nnow more commonly is often being treated\nwith some of the same injectable drugs\nthat are treating macular degeneration\num but there's still a lot of vision\nloss with diabetes and diabetic\nretinopathy I think that's an area where\nagain early screening making sure if you\nhave diabetes that's that's an\nindication where you definitely have to\nbe going in and getting your at least\nannual exam with an eye care provider or\nhaving someone take a photograph of the\ninside of your eye and rate that\nphotograph to say if you have any\ndiabetic retinopathy or not\nin terms of interventions can we talk\nabout diabetic retinopathy first because\nof course type 1 diabetes is a failure\nto produce insulin relatively rare\ncompared to type 2 diabetes which as you\nmentioned is proliferating in developing\ncountries right this is probably\nunprecedented in the sense that\ndeveloping countries have better Medical\nCare typically than non-developed\ncountries\nmore opportunities for food nourishment\nand yet it's clearly a problem of\novernourishment insulin insensitivity\nobesity Etc\nis this type of diabetic retinopathy\nthat one observes the same for type 1\ndiabetics versus type 2 diabetics\nbecause my understanding is that type 2\ndiabetes this insulin insensitivity is\na bit of a Continuum right I mean the\ntype 1 diabetes is as far as I know is\nall or none you either make insulin or\nyou don't but type 2 diabetes someone\ncould be mildly in insulin insensitive\nor severely insulin insensitive and\nsometimes I'm told people are not\nnecessarily obese and can have type 2\ndiabetes as well certainly things like\nsmoking and alcohol intake can\ncontribute to that so how equivalent are\ntype 1 and type 2 diabetes when framed\nUnder the Umbrella of diabetic\nretinopathy yeah the the time to\npresentation can be different\na type 1 diabetic usually presents with\nsort of a\ncataclysmic sudden loss sudden sort of\nfinal loss of their ability to make\ninsulin it usually presents in childhood\nor teenage years but can present you can\nhave late onset type 1 diabetes because\nit's kind of a sudden presentation it\ncan take some years after that to show\nany diabetic retinopathy whereas just\nbecause just just like you said type 2\ndiabetes can be on a Continuum and\npeople can have like kind of a mild type\n2 diabetes but kind of be you know\ngetting along you know going through\nlife kind of maybe not even realizing\nyou know at first and so when you're\ndiagnosed with type 2 diabetes you've\nprobably had some insulin resistance for\nthe years prior to your diagnosis and so\nin that case you often can have\num you know like you're you're at higher\nrisk for presenting sooner with the\ncomplications of diabetes like diabetic\nretinopathy now given that the actual\nretinopathy\nis very similar maybe the same uh\nbetween type 1 diabetes and type 2\ndiabetes and again it involves things\nlike leaky blood vessels new blood\nvessel growth there's some amount of\nneurodegenerative dysfunction that just\nsimply occurs uh so so uh you can have\nlittle little hemorrhages or bleeding\nspots in the retina tiny little strokes\nor microvascular uh events in the retina\nso that can happen in either type 1 or\ntype 2 diabetes once you start having\nthe retinopathy it does look pretty\nsimilar\nso what can people do to prevent or\ntreat diabetic retinopathy obviously the\ntype 1 diabetic needs to take insulin in\norder to survive really type 2 diabetics\nneed to get their obesity under control\nif they are in fact obese and get their\nblood sugar levels under control\nregardless that's my understanding and\nby extension are you seeing any\nreductions in diabetic retinopathy with\npeople that are taking these glucose\nlike peptide mimics like ozempic which\nis used to treat type 2 diabetes yeah\nit's been a very exciting development\nfor the diabetes field this new class of\nof um of\nanti-diabetic drugs and\num so uh there you've touched on a\ncouple of them there are a few key\nthings for reducing the risk of diabetes\nor the impact of an diabetes on your\nretina at risk of diabetic retinopathy\nor impact of diabetes on your retina\nuh one is as I mentioned get regular eye\nexams be screened you know any diabetic\nshould be screened at least once a year\nuh with a with a good comprehensive\nretinal exam looking for any of these uh\nitems the number one most important\nelement to prevent diabetic retinopathy\nis to control your diabetes and having a\nreal good blood sugar control keeping\nyour hemoglobin A1c which is one of the\nblood tests that gets used to measure\nhow your kind of long-term diabetes\nmanagement is going\nuh that's really uh you know first and\nforemost the most important and that's\nbeen shown in large clinical trials they\nactually randomize patients to hey take\ncare of your diabetes or do a real good\njob taking care of your diabetes and the\npatients who did a real good job taking\ncare of their diabetes have much less\ndiabetic retinopathy so that's number\none it turns out that if you have high\nblood pressure and diabetes that blood\npressure is also really damaging to your\nretina also by the way the kidneys and\nprobably all the other organs that are\nsuffering from the diabetic insult so in\naddition to controlling blood sugar\nreally important to have blood pressure\nunder great control now both blood sugar\nand blood pressure in type 2 diabetics\nespecially if you're catching them early\ncan be improved with some of these you\nknow so-called Lifestyle Changes like\nimproving eating watching what your food\nintake is you know getting good exercise\ntrying to lose weight uh so these are\ndefinitely on that list of how do you\nget to good blood sugar and blood\npressure control\nbut suffice it to say blood sugar and\nblood pressure control right at the top\nand then also including the regular at\nleast annual exams and then if diabetic\nretinopathy is detected and blood sugar\nand blood pressure control are not going\nto be enough for that patient we do have\ntreatments as I mentioned before there\nare drugs that can be injected if your\nretina is getting you know kind of leaky\nblood vessels from diabetes there are\ntreatments that we can give the eye\nspecifically to try to counter the\ndiabetic retinopathy terrific in terms\nof glaucoma as you mentioned glaucoma is\nrelated to pressure although there is\npressure normal glaucoma\nglaucoma is a death of the retinal\nganglion cells the neurons that connect\nthe eye to the brain and once they are\ngone at least at this point in human\nhistory they can't be replaced although\nhopefully because of work that you've\ndone in the other Laboratories are doing\nat some point that statement I just made\nwill not be true in the rgcs can be\nreplaced\nmeanwhile what can and should people do\nto find out if they have glaucoma\nand to treat glaucoma\nand is it true that even if somebody has\nnormal pressure that lowering their eye\npressure further protects them against\nglaucoma yeah that's absolutely right so\nmost important is to get screened with a\nformal exam at your optometrist or\nophthalmologist because you you won't\nnotice you won't have any symptoms if\nyour eye pressure is too high you won't\nknow you're not likely to notice until\nvery late in the disease if your\nperipheral vision is being damaged\nthrough the course of glaucoma so most\nimportant us have a screening exam a\ngood comprehensive screening exam will\nalways include checking the eye\npressures and also looking in the back\nof your eye the head of the optic nerve\nwhere all the fibers leave the eye and\ncarry the optic nerve information back\nto the brain we can see that when we\nlook inside your eye and uh and and\nglaucoma has a fairly characteristic\nlook to it in the optic nerve head so so\nlooking at the optic nerve had uh we\nhave Imaging and peripheral vision\ntesting that can also be included in\nthose screening exams so if you really\nget a comprehensive screening exam you\ncan very reliably detect if you have\nglaucoma to worry about or you're in the\nclear\nif you have glaucoma to worry about we\nhave treatments and you're absolutely\nright whether you start with a\nabnormally high pressure or you start\nwith a pressure that's on the face of it\nin the normal range\nin either case lowering the pressure has\nbeen shown in large properly controlled\nclinical trials to slow the progression\nof optic nerve damage and vision loss so\nabsolutely in either case starting with\nhigh pressure or starting with normal\npressure in either case you've got to\nlower the pressure further and as I\nmentioned we have eye drops those are\nusually the first line there's very good\ndata that there's a very benign\nnon-invasive laser it's not the same\nkind of laser that gets used for Lasik\nbut there's a benign very safe type of\nlaser called selective laser\ntrabeculoplasty SLT we call it and\nthat's also very effective as a first\nline actually in the largest clinical\ntrial from which the data have been\ncoming out just even over the last few\nyears it's called the light trial in the\nlight trial patients with glaucoma were\nrandomly assigned to either get the\nlaser or the sort of most common first\nstrongest eye drop and uh that gets used\nclinically and actually\non many features they both worked at\nleast as well but when looking out over\nthe long term actually the laser had\nsome advantages over the eye drop not in\nthe least of which by the way it's very\nnice for patients to not have to like\nremember to use the eye drop every night\nand so um so that's quite helpful I\nthink uh to to keep in mind as a\ntreatment option uh early in the course\nof the disease of course if the eye\ndrops under our lasers are not enough\nearly in the disease we also have\nsurgical approaches to lower the eye\npressure further you know even with all\nof our treatments all of these\ntreatments stepping patients through all\nof this\nabout 10 15 even 20 percent of patients\nwill lose very meaningful functional\nvision and maybe five ten fifteen\npercent of patients especially depending\nwhere you are in the world will go blind\nfrom glaucoma\nincluding in you know quote-unquote\ndeveloped countries uh there's still a\nvery significant cohort of patients that\ngo blind legally blind and then you know\nabsolute blindness I can't even tell if\nthe lights are on in the room uh so it's\nit's it's it's devastating it's\nInsidious it's hard to detect early\num and so glaucoma's still a tough one\neven with all of the treatments that we\nhave okay so get your pressures checked\nfolks and if you are prescribed drops\ntake your drops\nI hear about patients not taking their\ndrops which to me just seems like\nbaffling but I guess having to do\nsomething day in and day out is it can\nbe Troublesome enough that unless people\nare losing their Vision very quickly or\nthey are very afraid of losing their\nVision sometimes they just neglect to\ntake them it's hard it's hard for\nglaucoma eye drops it's hard for taking\nyour blood pressure medication it's hard\nfor a lot of medicines you know if\nyou're if you're taking a medicine where\nyou don't feel better you know if you\nhave a headache and you take an aspirin\nor Tylenol or an ibuprofen uh you know\nyou feel better you feel reinforced gosh\ntaking that pill made sense right but if\nyou're using an eye drop that like hey\nthis is going to protect you for the\nnext 20 years from losing your vision\nbut you don't notice every day that\nanything's better and by the way the eye\ndrops could be a little irritating maybe\nit stings a little for a minute or two\nand you put it in your eye some people\nare even less tolerant of the eye drops\nit's hard to feel motivated every day\nand we know that we call that compliance\nwe know that it's very hard for patients\nto stay compliant with prescribed\nmedications where they don't feel or\nnotice a difference in a daily way\nI realize that we can't stop aging\nyet\num but right now you can't stop aging\nand age is a risk factor for glaucoma my\nunderstanding is so is smoking or vaping\nnicotine\nand so is alcohol\nand by that reasoning should people\nstrive to drink less and smoke less\nincluding vaping nicotine less if they\nare concerned about glaucoma yeah and\nnot just glaucoma macular degeneration\nactually macular degeneration has a\ncouple major risk factors macular\ndegeneration aging just like with\nglaucoma major risk factor\nsmoking including exposure to secondhand\nsmoke major risk factor for macular\ndegeneration and for the progression and\nvision loss potentially associated with\nmacular degeneration in the case of\nmacular degeneration there's also a\ncouple of genes that we've sequenced the\nhuman genome and there's a couple of\ngenes associated with magnet generation\ntwo\nthat's less true for your typical\nrun-of-the-mill adult Kuma there are\ngenes for the Pediatric and infantile\nforms of glaucoma uh so yeah smoking a\nhundred percent including vaping uh it's\na No-No for your eyes just like it's a\nNo-No for the rest of your body and uh\nit's tough as the eye doctor to have\nthese conversations with patients\nbecause you kind of feel like well you\nknow they must know it already and I'm\ntrying to be the good guy in the room\nwith the patient convince them to use\ntheir other medications but it's it's\nimportant for us also as Eye Care\nProviders to reinforce the message with\nour patients a smoking terrible idea uh\nfor maca degeneration also for glaucoma\nyou know glaucoma is interesting because\nthe optic nerve where it degenerates\nkind of right at the head of the optic\nnerve where it exits the eye it's what\nwe call a watershed Zone it's kind of an\nedge of two blood vessel supplies and if\neither of those blood vessels supplies\nare a little bit short on blood or\noxygen supply to that optic nerve head\nyour glaucoma is going to get worse your\noptic nerve is going to be under fed and\nthat's going to worsen this degenerative\nprocess just by not having all the right\nnutrients and oxygen so the other thing\nis that especially for glaucoma\neverything that we talk about for being\nheart healthy\nfor the rest of our body is is almost\ncertainly true for glaucoma and so I\nalso always counsel glaucoma patients\nit's not just no smoking but eat healthy\nhave a multivitamin uh get some exercise\nall those things that are good for your\ncardiovascular system are going to be\ngood for your eyes in general and in\nparticular if you have glaucoma or at\nrisk high risk for glaucoma I realize\nthat smoking or vaping are problematic\nfor glaucoma and for macular\ndegeneration but we can't have a\nconversation about glaucoma without at\nleast mentioning cannabis I did an\nentire episode about cannabis which\ntouched on some of the real dangers of\nvery high THC concentration cannabis\nthis lost me a few\num followers I'm sure no problem because\nwhat was important was to convey the\nfact that the Cannabis that's out there\nnowadays comes in a variety of different\nstrains and ratios of THC to CBD there's\nsome severe risks of high THC especially\nin young males although not always the\npoint being that there are and I want to\nbe very clear about this because for\nwhatever reason cannabis gets people\nreally up in arms they always say it's\nnot as bad as alcohol but guess what we\ndid an entire episode about alcohol and\nthere the message is very clear zero is\nbetter than any and two a week is\nprobably the limit and if you're an\nalcoholic zero is the rule so\nwith cannabis it's clear by my read of\nthe data that it can lower eye pressure\nwhich may undermine the progression of\nglaucoma somewhat but if people are\nsmoking that cannabis is it therefore\ngoing to offset any gain that one would\nget from that cannabis and then how does\none account for the potentially\nproblematic aspects of very high THC\ncannabis yeah it's a great question and\nthe truth is is that in most patients\ncannabis will lower the eye pressure the\nproblem is is it really only lowers that\neye pressure During the period that\nyou're high from the Cannabis and the\nsecond problem is that smoking version\nof getting that cannabis into your\nsystem the smoking is bad for your lungs\nby the way the smoke from Cannabis or\nfrom cigarettes is also terrible for\nyour dry eyes it causes inflammation it\ndries out your eyes so it's also very\nbad from that perspective now so the the\nproblem with cannabis is not that it\ndoesn't work to lower the price we want\nto lower the pressure that's great the\nproblem with cannabis is that it's not\nrealistic for most of our patients\nto prescribe could you go out and be\nhigh from Cannabis 24 hours a day seven\ndays a week for the next 20 years I'm\nsure some people have tried and\nsucceeded\num but right that's not practical for\nmost people and certainly for young\npeople it could be really especially\nproblematic yeah I should say absolutely\nso so I recommend not taking that\napproach but that said I I'm definitely\nnot a decryer of it and now that there\nare edible forms I certainly have\npatients who are using it in a\nresponsible way uh especially edible\nforms and uh and in select cases like\nthat could make the difference for them\nhelping to keep the pressure down and\nI'll say for example you know it turns\nout you've talked a lot over the last\ncouple years about diurnal curves and\ncircadian rhythms it turns out that our\neye pressure also undergoes a circadian\nrhythm and it's actually highest at\nnight while we're sleeping kind of peaks\nin those early morning hours then hits a\nlow throughout the early day and then\nkind of rises again throughout the\nafternoon into the evening and we have a\nlot of patients who they come into their\nClinic visit their eye pressure looks\nnormal but it's actually quite a bit\nhigher when they're at home and that\ncould explain some fraction of what we\ncall normal pressure glaucoma it just\nlooks normal during the day it's\nactually high at night and so in\nparticular some patients I certainly\nhave some patients who are using these\nproducts like let's say before bed and\nif it's controlling their eye pressure\nat night while they're asleep when the\neye pressure would have been the highest\nit may confer some protective advantage\nover time but that said again like for\nmost patients it's not going to be the\nprimary approach I'm most excited about\nthe idea of\nyou know Laboratories or companies\nfiguring out which\nthe compounds Within These cannabinoids\nthey're called within these products are\nactually responsible for lowering the\neye pressure and could we get like a\nmore potent eye specific\nlong-acting drug that's basically\nderived from the concept of cannabis but\nworks better and is more compatible with\nnot bringing along all the other adverse\nelements that can come with cannabis use\nyou mentioned the Circadian rhythm and\neye pressure and the fact that eye\npressure is higher at night\nis there any advantage to sleeping in a\nparticular position I know this might\nsound a little detailed but I seem to\nrecall an abstract or a paper a few\nyears ago at a meeting that you and I\nboth attended were that said that if\npeople slept with their head below their\nfeet eye pressures were higher than if\ntheir head was slightly elevated above\ntheir feet and for somebody who has\nglaucoma this could make a pretty\nsubstantial difference in terms of their\neye pressures at precisely the hours of\nthe night we should say in which they\ncould be doing the most damage to the\nganglion cells yeah absolutely and we\nwill sometimes counsel patients with\nsevere glaucoma especially if they're\nyou know poorly responsive to standard\ntherapies or poorly able to tolerate\nstandard therapies we'll counsel them if\nthey're able to sleep up on a couple\npillows get kind of a 30 degree sleep\nangle going what I don't want to do is\ninterfere with a person's sleep because\nI just I fundamentally feel for the\ntotal health of the whole human being\ngetting a good night's sleep is maybe\nmore important than that 30 degrees and\nif trying to sleep up on pillows at 30\ndegrees it's going to lead to kind of\nrestless difficult sleep night I'd\nrather the patient get a good night's\nsleep but if they can tolerate it and\nespecially if they have a sort of a\ntough version of glaucoma then we'll\nwe'll let them try see if they can sleep\nup the other really interesting question\nthat arises is uh does which side you\nsleep on affect uh which I might have\nworse glaucoma glaucoma is almost always\nwith with a few rare exceptions almost\nalways a disease of two eyes but it can\npresent very asymmetrically in fact it's\nquite common to have one eye kind of\nhave worse damage than the other and and\nwe don't know fundamentally why that is\nbut one hypothesis was gosh maybe if you\nsleep on the right eye uh then your\nright eye will have worse glaucoma\nbecause the pressure is a little higher\ndown below or maybe it's pressing on the\npillow in a way or some something like\nthat there have been a couple studies\nreally really looking at that question a\ncouple Studies have said the lower aisle\nhave worse glaucoma a couple Studies\nhave said the higher I will have worse\nglaucoma so the upshot is it probably\ndoesn't matter which side you sleep on\nwe also know when you video people in\ntheir normal sleep pattern even if you\nfeel you always fall asleep on the left\nside of your face people toss and turn\nall night probably over the course of\nthe night you're spending a similar\namount of time on each eye I'm glad you\nbrought up that point in terms of\nmacular degeneration I'm curious about\nthe things that people can do as opposed\nto the don'ts in order to perhaps offset\nmacular degeneration one of the things\nthat I'm intrigued by are the results of\nGlenn Jeffery's laboratory over at\nUniversity College London I had known\nJeff for probably a decade or more and\nhe typically worked on animal models but\nthen a few years ago started publishing\nstudies I believe there are now two\npublished studies showing how red light\nexposure\nand near infrared\nlight exposure done early in the day to\nthe eye at a distance of about two feet\nfor just a couple of minutes a few times\na week could offset some of the vision\nloss associated with age-related macular\ndegeneration in people older than 40.\nthat's my understanding of these studies\nand there's a theory there about\nenhancing function of mitochondria and\nphotoreceptors by reducing reactive\noxygen species there's a whole\nmechanistic hypothesis but\nmy question is is that the sort of\nprotocol that produces significant\nenough offset of macular degeneration\nlike we should all be looking at red\nlights in the morning\num or is it still too early days in\norder to really conclude that\ndata is very compelling the data are\nvery compelling that this kind of red or\nnear infrared light therapy can be at\nsome level neuroprotective and yes uh\nthe the data suggests that uh kind of\nramping up high high functioning\nmitochondria is a part of that\nactivating neuroprotective Pathways in\nthe retina it's actually been\ndemonstrated in animal models and a\nlittle human data here and there but\nboth for macular degeneration kind of uh\ndegenerative is but also for optic\nneuropathies you know like glaucoma\nretinal ganglion cells the cells that\ncarry all that visual information from\nthe eye to the brain they're chock full\nof mitochondria too and uh and so the\nidea that this could be a therapeutic\napproach I think is very compelling\nthere are a number of studies actually I\nthink still ongoing today\nreally trying to figure out what's the\nright dose how much brightness do you\nneed is there an optimal wavelength how\nmany minutes does it matter when during\nthe day you provide that light or how\nmany minutes or hours\num these are still very much open\nquestions you know what's the dose\nwhat's the delivery\num but it's it's it's it's it's very\npromising looking and there's biological\npremise and I'm excited to see where\nthat goes because again that's like a\nthat's a very accessible uh sort of\ntherapeutic approach that could be\nbrought to a very broad swath of of\npeople so I'm excited about that sorry I\ndidn't mean to interrupt and completely\nnon-invasive\num I should um probably mention a\nwarning which is if people are going to\ndecide that they're going to jump on\nthis result and do red light exposure in\nthe early part of the day no matter what\ncolor a light is if it's too bright you\ncan damage your eye so I think this is\nwhy you're pointing the fact that we\nneed established protocol calls before\npeople really start blasting their eyes\nwith red light and if they are going to\nexpose themselves to Red Light it\nshouldn't be uncomfortably bright do I\nhave that yeah that's absolutely right\nyou know actually uh light effect\num we talked about this a little bit\nearlier\num there's actually now data also that\nred light and actually interestingly\nstudies using light at the other end of\nthe visible spectrum violet light either\nof those in small daily doses can also\nbe used to prevent progression of\nnearsightedness in children in\nschool-aged children and so I think\nwe're really just on the cusp of really\nunderstanding the biology of how these\ndifferent light therapies might be\nleveraged maximally to to maximize our\nEye Health and both during development\nand at the other end of the spectrum as\nwe age so it's an exciting area and I\nthink this kind of phototherapy is uh\nyou know a very hot topic for research\nright now very hot topic one has to\nwonder whether or not these light\ntherapies the fact that infrared works\nand maybe ultraviolet works is are\nreally just capturing some of what\nsunlight\nis naturally doing when as you mentioned\nbefore a child or perhaps an adult also\nspends a certain number of hours\noutdoors I mean maybe we're just filling\nin the blanks that are neglected\nnowadays because we're spending so much\ntime indoors under artificial lights and\nin front of screens yeah yeah\nvery thoughtful possibility yeah\nI have a couple of we don't have to call\nthem quick questions but common\nquestions that perhaps have a brief uh\nexplanations uh for instance I put out a\nrequest for questions in an anticipation\nof this episode and I got a lot of\npeople asking what are floaters in the\neye and is there anything that people\ncan do to get rid of floaters yeah our\neye when we're born is actually filled\nin the middle of it with a jelly it's\nnot just fluid it's kind of a jelly\nthere's collagen fibers and thankfully\nthe whole jelly is largely invisible so\nthe light can get through our eye back\nto the retina without being impeded as\nwe age those different fibers and gels\nshrink and contract and they peel off of\nthe back of the retina so there's just\nin the middle now your your eyeball\ndoesn't shrink because it fills in with\nwith fluid with salt water basically but\nthe gel part shrinks and as it shrinks\nand also pulls peels off the retina it\ncan pull off kind of little tiny retinal\nbits not important to your vision bits\nbut just like little tissue bits and\nalso as it congeals it kind of uh can\nget little concretions in the jelly and\nwe perceive those as floaters you know\nlittle almost semi-translucent or in\nsome cases kind of grayish blackish\nsometimes sometimes you get a big one if\nit peels off the edge of the optic nerve\nin the back of the eye as happens we\ncall that a posterior vitreous\ndetachment you can actually see like a\nmoon or a half moon floater in Your\nVision these are very frustrating to a\nlot of people\num and uh the good news is in almost all\ncases they will just go away by\nthemselves in theory it's been played\nwith gosh we could do like a big surgery\nto chew up all that jelly replace it all\nwith salt water try to get rid of your\nfloaters there's risk associated with\nthat surgery we use it very effective\nactively in a retinal detachments or\nother diseases bad diabetic retinopathy\nbleeding inside the eye we can take out\nthe jelly from the eye replace it with\nwith salt water but that's not\num you know putting patients through the\nrisk of that surgery just to get rid of\na couple of floaters or a few floaters\nthat probably are going to go away over\nthe next few months I actually like to\ntell patients it's nothing to worry\nabout just ignore them and actually if\nyou stop focusing on them your brain\nwill actually start filtering them out\nyou'll stop noticing them if you can\nkind of uh not worry about them be a\nlittle intentional about ignoring them\nin the beginning and then they do\nactually go away and look some will go\naway these three will go away these two\nwill appear eventually you'll stop\nhaving floaters most patients will stop\nhaving floaters so we really don't like\nto put a patient at risk by intervening\nwe really like to in this case just\nreassure them it's going to be okay just\nignore them they'll eventually go away\nthank you for that answer\ntwitching of the eye is something that\npeople complain about I know when I get\ntired I'll get a twitch over one eye I\nthink there's a condition is it called\nmyasthena gravis where people go through\na stressful period or get very fatigued\nand I think that's a depletion of the\nnerve terminal communication between the\nnerves that control the muscles of the\neye and then people get this kind of\nlike hooded eye look\num where they have a hard time opening\ntheir eyes but barring something extreme\nlike myasthena gravis\nor staying up for two days working or\neven just being a bit sleep deprived\nwhat causes the twitching of the eyelid\nand is there anything people can do\nabout that most the time it's actually\njust a bad nerve ending you know maybe\nthat one nerve cell you know your eyelid\nis fed by you know hundreds maybe it's\nthousands of nerve cells that are doing\nthe muscles they're doing the feeling\nobviously if the ones controlling the\nmuscles that can lead to a twitch if one\nof those nerve cells kind of just starts\nyou know maybe that one nerve cell is\ndying just you know whatever the age you\ncan process uh you know it happens in\nyoung people too though so you got one\nbad fiber that's just deciding to kind\nof ring off the hook that's that's that\ntelephone's just ringing off the hook\nand it's just activating the muscle so\nyou're just twitching that muscle I've\nhad them as well and you can have\nnotches in your eyelids you can have\nthis anywhere in your body like one\nlittle spot on your leg where just the\nmuscle right under the skin again is\njust\nand typically it'll happen over the\ncourse of a couple of months\nintermittently some days more sometimes\nless maybe it correlates with when\nyou're tired a little bit sometimes and\nthen it'll stop that nerve cell will\neither reconnect properly and stop doing\nthat maybe it dies we don't really know\nbut typically it lasts on that scale now\nthere are other diseases not just\nmyasthenia gravis you can have blepharos\nspasm like where you have a chronic\nspasming of of certain nerves causing\nmuscles to spasm and there we we can use\nwe can use treatments for example Botox\nas a treatment that you know people use\nfor cosmetic reducing of wrinkles for\nexample but you know a really good\nmedical use of Botox is preventing that\nblepharospasm and patients can come in\nonce every three or six months if they\nhave a really severe spasming version of\nwhat you're describing but the regular\noccasional run-of-the-mill lasts a\ncouple months nothing to worry about it\ndoes not pre-sage anything bad happening\nin your future and maybe let it run its\ncourse and you'll be okay great\nwe've all heard that carrots are good\nfor our vision which presumably stems\nfrom some peripheral understanding about\nthe fact that vitamin A is integral to\nthe photosynthesis pathway of converting\nlight into electrical and chemical\nsignals that the rest of the eye brain\ncan use and yet I'm guessing that there\nprobably aren't that many people walking\naround who are vitamin A deficient\nthey're probably out there but not that\nmany especially in developed countries\nand in addition in the last really five\nyears but in particular in the last two\nyears I've seen a proliferation of\nsupplements on the market to promote Eye\nHealth and Longevity of vision\nI'd love your thought on this General\ntheme of nutrition and supplements for\nimproving Eye Health or for maintaining\nEye Health and before we started\nrecording you mentioned that\nOphthalmology or at least Eye Health is\none area of medicine that has a bit not\nextensive but a bit of a longer history\nof exploring supplementation in rigorous\nrandomized control trials whereas other\nareas of Neuroscience and Neural Health\nsuch as Alzheimer's Etc certainly there\nare brain health supplements out there\nbut there aren't a lot of rigorous data\nto support them just yet so what are\nyour thoughts on nutrition\num aside from the standard thing of you\nknow people shouldn't be ingesting too\nmany calories such that they are obese\nand diabetic and therefore you know Etc\nindirect effects of nutrition\num what are your thoughts on nutrition\nand supplementation for Eye Health yeah\nyou know you're absolutely right and\nagain in Ophthalmology we actually do\nhave quite a bit of studies there's been\nquite a bit of attention over the years\neven over the decades looking at this\nquestion and I think it's worth\nhighlighting\num a couple of yeses and a couple of\nno's\nfor macular degeneration which we talked\nabout being an exceedingly common cause\nof vision loss there have been two\nage-related eye disease studies called\narids age-related eye disease studies\nera there is arids and then arids too\nand those studies were a large\nrandomized Trials of using giving giving\npatients supplements and in arids it was\nvitamin c and e\nuh higher dose than would just come in a\nmultivitamin\nzinc and copper\nand then also beta-carotene\nand beta-carotene is one of these what\nare called carotenoids it's a it's a if\nyou look at the extended family there's\nmaybe 600 different chemical entities of\nthese carotenoids and beta-carotene is\none of them that's in the direct pathway\nof making vitamin A and so that was the\nprinciple in the Arid study and the Arid\nstudies showed that patients randomized\nto these pills compared to controls it\nit did these are antioxidants in part\nright in addition to feeding into that\nvitamin A pathway and um and the\npatients randomized to get that\nsupplement mixture\nshowed less progression of their dry\nmacular degeneration in the moderate to\nsevere ranges if you had mild macular\ndegeneration they didn't show a\nstatistically significant Improvement\nbut I will say it's my experience you\nknow myself with patients and and seeing\nhow the field works you know if you have\nmild macular degeneration even though\nit's not as clinically proven we're\nstill often recommending hey if you can\nafford that supplement go ahead and buy\nthat now arids Was Then followed by a\nsecond study arids too also with vitamin\nC vitamin E zinc and copper they\nactually tested whether a slightly lower\ndose of zinc would be as good as a\nhigher dose and a lower dose was as good\nas a higher dose and then instead of the\nbeta-carotene they tested against the\nbeta-carotene they tried two other\ncarotenoids that are called lutein and\nzeaxanthine and and they actually found\nhead to head that the second the arids\nII formula without the beta-carotene and\nwith the lutein and zeaxanthin that that\nformula was even better at slowing dry\nmacro degeneration in the moderate to\nsevere population again it's not clear\nhow much it may help mild back the\ngeneration but in the uh sort of\nclinically defined moderate towards\nsevere group there was a statistically\nsignificant it reduced it by about 20 25\nthe progression of your dry Market\ngeneration and you know over a couple of\nyears 25 five percent you may not notice\nbut over a couple of decades you know\nthat could really slow down the\nprogression of your disease\nnow it turns out that the beta carotene\nthey noted a little bit of an increased\ncancer risk in the patients in the arids\none who had that beta-carotene mostly in\npatients who are smokers\nthey also noticed in the second one that\nif you were already not taking a\nmultivitamin or not eating a diet that's\nalready naturally rich in lutein or\nzeaxanthin that the effect of that\nsupplement was even stronger\nso it was very strong clinical trial\nsupport for taking what we now use this\narids II supplementation and I'm sure we\ncan list the formula or put it in the\nlinks under under your podcast uh uh\nthat that thus really does slow macular\ndegeneration so that's like a very\nstrong example of a yes you should do\nthis\nthere's one yes brewing in the glaucoma\nfield right now and that's high dose\nvitamin B3 B is in boy three it's also\ncalled in its various forms either\nnicotinic acid or nicotinamide uh the\nnicotin sounds like nicotine but this is\nnot a substitute for smoking or vaping\nthis is a different this is a vitamin\nthat just has a very similar sounding\nname it's in the NAD synthesis pathway\nthat's exactly right it's in the NAD\npathway NAD is one of the oxidative\nstress regulators and energy Regulators\nof our cells so it's a very critical\nmolecule in the metabolism of our cells\nand there was very strong evidence in\npre-clinical models of mice given\nglaucoma that manipulating this pathway\nand sort of increasing this pathway\ncould be protective in glaucoma or other\noptic neuropathies optic nerve\ndegenerative diseases and so there have\nnow been been too limited but randomized\ncontrolled clinical trials one looking\nat glaucoma patients looking at their\nvisual field so their actual visual\nperformance and the other looking at the\nelectrical signals in the eye called an\nelectroretnogram kind of like an EEG\ndoes for your brain we can do an ERG for\nyour retina and in both of those trials\nhigh-dose vitamin B3 was a found to be\nvery safe and B was shown to actually\nimprove at least in the short term\nimprove retinal function measured either\non visual field testing or on the\nelectro retinogram now this is now\nentering\nclinical trials large kind of phase 3\nstyle clinical trials actually around\nthe world it's a very hot topic for\nglaucoma the fact that this NAD boosting\nsupplementation with high-dose vitamin\nB3 might be a great approach to helping\nprotect the nerve in in glaucoma and so\nas I say there's there's three or four\nlarge randomized phase three style\nclinical trials uh starting now and so\nover the next year or two we'll get more\ndata but I'll tell you like I have\npatience and if they're at the end of\ntheir rope and we are having a lot of\ntrouble controlling their vision loss\nfrom glaucoma I'm already recommending\nin these limited cases uh hey why don't\nyou try this it's almost certainly safe\nand it may and it may help and it may\nhelp protect your vision over time so so\nthat's that's an area that's kind of\nanother like kind of could be a yes\nearly data's point in the right\ndirection you want to be careful but uh\nbut I but I am starting to recommend it\nat the same time that we're actually\ndoing the clinical trials now that said\nthere are a lot of other things that\npeople talk about other supplements\nginkgo biloba things with generic names\non the internet like you know glaucoma\npreservation you know uh yeah that sort\nof thing makes my uh gives me hives you\nknow yeah and these are areas where\nthere might be scientific premise like a\nplausible explanation for how this\nshould help but not good data that it\nactually helps thankfully in most cases\nthese things are safe uh but I just\nworry about patience\nhitching their wagon to something that's\nnot going to help them getting their\nhopes up uh worst case scenario not\ntaking their actually proven prescribed\ntreatments and instead using an\nalternative therapy that doesn't have\ndata to support it and so I think there\nthere's a lot of you know\num uh you know either unfounded\nunsupported uh you know information it\ntravels around chat rooms travels around\nthe internet one person tells the next\nperson you know there's inappropriate\nadvertising for some of these uh and\nthey're you know I really don't want\npatients to be hurt not necessarily hurt\nby taking something that's not helping\nbut but maybe hurt by feeling like I\ndon't have to go to the doctor I'm\ntaking this supplement and that would be\nobviously a really bad potential outcome\nfor a patient yeah I completely agree\nsupplements are just as the name\nsuggests a supplement to an already\nhopefully healthy lifestyle and use of\nmedication where it's prescribed and\nI've often said on the podcast that\nsometimes the best dose of a supplement\nis zero milligrams so I do appreciate\nyou touching on those themes because\num supplementation is something that\ncomes up from time to time on the\npodcast and I know that I've certainly\nhave seen a number of these different I\nEnvision support supplements we aren't\naffiliated with any of them I don't\npersonally take any of them but these\nclinical trials sound promising so I'm\ngoing to keep an ear to the ground for\nthem\nas a final question and hopefully a\ntopic that we can cover in more detail\nin a subsequent episode of the podcast\nbecause I absolutely want to have you\nback to discuss this in more detail\nI'd like to just get your thoughts on\nthe fact that the neural retina is in\nfact neural and it's part of the brain\nand we are hearing an increasing amount\nof positive chatter about the use of\nImaging the eye and the retina directly\nas a way to detect other forms of\nneurodegeneration for those that are\nlistening or for watching\num you know I'm putting my hands up in\nkind of C shape at the back of your eye\nis lined with these with this three cell\nlayer thick thing that is the neural\nretina which are really pieces of brain\nthat connect to the rest of the brain\nand because it resides in the eyes and\noutside the cranial Vault people like\nyou\nskilled clinicians with the appropriate\ntools can look into the eye and see the\nbrain directly without having to cut\nthrough the skull\nand my understanding is that more and\nmore ophthalmologists are seeing\ncases where degeneration of the retina\nis correlated with degeneration of\nstructures deeper in the brain making\nImaging of the neural retina perhaps one\nof the best diagnostic tools for\npredicting and tracking the progression\nof Alzheimer's and other forms of\nneurodegeneration do I have that right\nyeah absolutely actually this is a super\nexciting area you know we we have this\nlong-standing sang in Ophthalmology that\nthe eye is a window to the brain the\neyes of window to the soul of course is\na log standing sang right and and it\nturns out that you know in Alzheimer's\ndisease as an example you know we really\ntalk a lot about the degeneration of\nbasal forebrain cholinergic neurons that\nare leading to the cognitive deficits in\nAlzheimer's disease but it turns out\nthat there is also some degeneration\nthroughout other areas of the brain\nincluding the retina and since we have\nsuch a relatively easy time Imaging the\nretina you can go into your doctor's\noffice and get a quick little sort of\nlaser scan of the retina a picture of\nthe ratna compared to like going through\na full MRI processor for your brain\nand we can detect the degeneration of\nthe retina and optic nerve associated\nwith Alzheimer's disease it looks like\nthe same thing is happening in\nParkinson's disease in Ms now one of the\nissues is that in a lot of these\ndegenerative diseases were able to\ndetect the difference in the retina but\nwere not necessarily able to say hey if\nwe see this in the retina it's multiple\nsclerosis but if we see that in the\nretina it's Alzheimer's disease so there\nmay not be there may be good sensitivity\nto detecting the disease and to\nfollowing whether your diseases your\nbrain disease is getting worse but there\nmay not be very good specificity\ndifferentiating the different diseases\nand I say that with a very big asterisk\nat the end of that sentence because\nthere's actually amazingly cool new data\none of our colleagues who you know Alf\ndubra\nhas helped revolutionize a new way of\nImaging the retina that's giving us now\ncellular resolution and even subcellular\nresolution seeing things smaller than\nthe sizes of cells inside our retina and\nrecently in one of his projects he's\nteamed up with another one of our\nfaculty Heather Moss she's a\nneuro-ophthalmologist so she really\nspecializes clinically in the eye brain\nconnection and her research focuses on\nthat and together they made actually an\namazing recent discovery of very\nspecialized unusual novel structures\nthat they can detect in the retina of\npatients with multiple sclerosis and\nwhether these kinds of discoveries or\nother similar kinds of discoveries are\ngoing to lead to kind of a a whole new\ngeneration of biomarkers which are ways\nof measuring disease diagnosing who has\nthe disease figuring out who's getting\nworse from the disease figuring out\nwho's responding to therapies that we're\ntrying to use to treat the diseases this\nis a very exciting area and this really\ntouches on what we're all hoping is the\nfuture of of eye care as well as the\nrest of medicine and that's that's\nPrecision medicine but also what we call\nPrecision Health we really want to not\njust figure out what drug treatment to\ngive this patient versus that treatment\nbut we really want to figure out who's\nat risk of even getting some of these\ndiseases and gosh we could intervene now\nand prevent them from ever getting in\ntrouble in the future\nfantastic can't wait to hear more about\nthose developments and listen I want to\nsay on behalf of the listeners and\nmyself just thank you ever so much for\nthe discussion today I don't think I can\never recall a conversation that's\nincluded so much basic science and\nclinical science and also so many\nactionable recommendations both do's and\ndon'ts as it relates to something so\ncritical as Eye Health I also I was just\nreflecting for a moment\nabout the fact that I think you and I\nmet 20 years ago when you were a\ngraduate student by the way folks\num Jeff is uh sort of the Kobe Bryant of\nsorts although unfortunately still with\nus in the sense that he went directly\nfrom his MD and phds skipped his postdoc\ndidn't require one directly to being a\nfaculty member most people don't do that\nthey do a five-year postdoc in between\nwait and then I believe he's going to\ntell me all the places I'm wrong and I\nshould just come clean that\num Jeff is my chair of department at um\nStanford School of Medicine Department\nof Ophthalmology so for me I I see this\nas a particularly warming but also\num at once unpredictable but pure\npleasure of an experience to get to\nlearn so much from you because I don't\nthink we've had this long to sit down\nand talk science in a very long time so\nthank you for doing that for my own sake\nthank you for teaching us so much about\nhow to take care of our Eye Health and\nnow you can tell me where my history is\nwrong maybe my hippocampus is\ndegenerating no it's been a pleasure\nover the years I have nothing but the\nwarmest memories of of you as a postdoc\nand me as a graduate student getting to\nbe you know nerds in the laboratory uh\n20 years ago 20 years ago at Stanford in\nthe lab of Ben Barris and uh and very\nwarm wonderful feelings about you know\nlearning science and how to do science\nand making real advances even at that\ntime and then the fact that we've had\nthe chance to cross paths in San Diego\nagain at Stanford collaborate on\nimportant projects having to do with you\nknow developing new ways of measuring\ndiseases developing new ways of treating\ndiseases the idea that we're going to\nactually bring forward some of the\nadvances that our lab that you're a lab\nthat other people's Labs have been\nmaking in neuroprotection in diseases\nlike glaucoma and macular degeneration\nin regeneration of the optic nerve of\nthe retina we're real close on a lot of\nthose this is a major topic of really\nThe Cutting Edge research that we're\nreally trying to keep pushing forward\nbecause we know it's so important to\npatients you know I I often joke you\nknow my mother had a uh a sign outside\nthe bathroom and it said remember how\nlong a minute is depends on what side of\nthe door you're on and I I really\nappreciate that like as fast as we're\ntrying to go with our research and\nmoving that into clinical research which\nI think we're doing very effectively in\nthe department really working on Vision\nrestoration research in the department I\nappreciate that as fast as we think\nwe're going it's not fast enough for so\nmany patients who are suffering from\nthese diseases so thanks very much for\nhaving me on it's been a real pleasure\nreconnecting over these many important\ntopics I really appreciate the chance to\ntalk with you well delighted to do it\nand looking forward to doing it
