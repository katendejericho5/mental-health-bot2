    "video_title": "Ask Yourself THESE 6 QUESTIONS To Change Your Life TODAY! | Rob Dial",
    "transcript": "there are some people\ntoday right now possibly even listening\nto this episode that are still pissed\noff about something that happened to\nthem 10 years ago what a waste\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nsix questions that will absolutely\nchange your life because one of the\nthings that you have to realize is it's\nnot always about having the right\nanswers sometimes it's about having the\nright questions that you ask yourself\nthat bring you to the right answers in\nyour life and i actually got a couple of\nthese questions i was watching a youtube\nvideo by a guy\nnamed ryan holiday who uh talks about\nliving a stoic life under the stoic\nphilosophy which is you know philosophy\nthey used to have in ancient rome marcus\naurelius made this really popular so\nit's a few questions from him that i saw\nhim say that kind of inspired this and\nthen a few questions that i actually\nadded in there as well so one thing i\nwould recommend that you do if possible\nget a pen and paper write these down and\nthen when we're done all you have to do\nis literally answer those questions and\nstart to go through them and see if you\ncan start to get some really deep\nanswers for these questions so i'm going\nto ask these questions and i'm going to\nkind of frame them for you you can write\nthem down you can pause me if you need\nto and then force yourself to answer\nthem and to not allow yourself to be\nsurface level but to allow yourself to\ngo deeper than you normally would to\nfind answers\nthat might be hidden inside of you that\nare looking to be uncovered throughout\nthis process\nthe first question that i want you to\nask yourself is this\nwho am i spending time with so there's a\nphrase a quote that says show me who you\nspend time with and i will tell you who\nyou are show me who you spend time with\nand i'll tell you who you are i don't\neven need to know who you are see you or\nanything but if you were to show me the\ntop five people that you spend the most\ntime with the top 10 people who you\nspend the most time with and i were to\nlook at them talk to them\ninterview them all of that stuff i could\nget a pretty good idea of who you are\nwhere you are in your life what you're\ndoing well with what you're struggling\nwith but also what direction you're\nheading in your life as well it's like\nyou've heard me say many times the five\npeople you spend the most time with you\naverage them together you're going to\nbecome those people if you spend time\nwith five alcoholics you're probably\ngoing to be the sixth alcoholic if you\nspend time with five millionaires you're\nprobably gonna spend you're probably\ngonna become the six millionaire and so\nthat's why if you look at people who are\nyou know if you look at the people you\nspend the most time with there's a\npretty good chance you've put them all\ntogether you\nthink the same way as them you are\nheaded the same direction as them your\nbody is probably very similar to them if\nyou hang out with you know if you're\noverweight and you just start hanging\nout around five people who are extremely\nfit\nyou are going to start to become more\nfit now you might not be as fit of the\npeople who are extremely fit but you\nwill become more fit simply from being\naround them and they are going to hold\nyou to a higher standard you know\nthey're not going to be eating things\nthat you're eating in order to get you\nto where you are and you're going to\nstart changing your habits and when\nyou're around people that are taking\ncare of themselves and you see that\nthey're waking up earlier and you see\nthat they're focused on their business\nor you see that they're focused on their\nmindset or you see that they're focused\non the relationship with their spouse or\nthey're focused on their relationship\nwith their children showing up as the\nbest parent you are going to see what\nthey're doing and you are going to\nbecome like them and so the first\nquestion is who am i spending time with\nis to start thinking about who are the\npeople around me\nthat are\nhelping me become better\nwho are the people that are keeping me\nin the exact same position and who are\nthe people that could possibly be making\nme actually worse and so there's three\ndifferent categories that i just talked\nabout there's the people that are going\nto make you better there's the people\nare going to make you worse and the\npeople that are going to keep you\nexactly the same as you currently are\nwhen you look at these people\nand you start to see who you're spending\ntime with you ask yourself who you're\nspending time with also ask yourself the\nquestion where are these people headed\nin their life like what direction are\nthey headed if you look at the\ntrajectory of their life and what\ndirection they're going into and you're\nsaying okay my good friend john that i\nspend a lot of time with and i look at\nwhere he's going in his life and i fast\nforward in my mind where john could be\nin five years\nis that where i also want to be in five\nyears or am i looking at that going yeah\nhe's not heading in a direction that i\nwant to be\nwell if he's not heading a direction\nthat you want to be maybe it's time to\nno you don't have to get rid of him as i\nalways say just spend a little bit less\ntime with him and maybe put a new person\ninto your top five i'm not saying you\nhave to get rid of people\nbut just start to be very aware\nof the people that you spend time with\nand where they are helping you head in\nwhat direction you're headed to you know\nso if you have a\nmassive success you have something\namazing happening happening at work are\nthese people celebrating your success\nare they rooting you on or is there a\npart of you that's like\ni'm not really sure if they're happy\nabout my success or if they're just\nbeing fake or if they're being if\nthey're if they're indifferent to my\nsuccess a really good friend should be\nsomebody who celebrates your success and\nas happy about your success as you are\nthat's what you're really looking for in\nthese types of people so are they\nheading in the same direction as you or\nare they heading in the direction that\nyou want to be heading that's the first\nquestion who am i spending time with\nquestion number two which is a big\nquestion to ask yourself is is this\nsomething that i have control over and\nso when you look at things that are\npossibly uh stressing you out\nmaking you anxious that you're worrying\nabout maybe a little bit too much ask\nyourself the question is this something\nthat i have control over because so much\nof what we go through in our lives we\ndon't have control over we don't have\ncontrol over the majority of the things\nin our life we don't have the control\nover anybody else uh we don't have\ncontrol over the weather and if you want\nto talk about you know control over\nother people\nand i'll give you a really good example\nof this i was running a zoom earlier\ntoday uh for about 93 people and these\nare all people who i'm you know helping\nthem grow their coaching business i'm\nteaching them how to grow a coaching\nbusiness in my business breakthrough\nprogram and i'm teaching them this and\nuh you know there were quite a few\npeople who showed up late not massively\nlate but like one or two minutes late\nlike they were a few minutes late five\nminutes late seven minutes late and i\nstarted exactly on time and i said hey\nwould it be and i didn't preface this in\nany sort of way for them but i said to\nthem you know would it be um\nkind of irresponsible and unacceptable\nif you're expecting me to start this\nlive at 12 eastern and i showed up at\n1207 consistently would you guys see\nthat as unacceptable let me know in the\nchat\nflood it in every single person like yes\nyes yes yes they'll be unacceptable and\nthen i said\nwhy is it unacceptable for me to show up\nlate but many of you showed up a few\nminutes late and so you have to be\nwilling to hold yourself accountable for\nwhen you're showing up but you also have\nto realize that you have no control over\nwhat time other people show up how other\npeople act\nhow they're going to show up whenever\nthey get there when they show up all of\nthat stuff and i always give the example\nif you have kids or you know children\nand you're around a two-year-old the\nlast thing that a two-year-old wants to\ndo is be controlled and so you have to\nrealize it is really hard to control\nother people\nso what is it that you can control those\nare the things that i want you to focus\non stop focusing on what you can't\ncontrol and start focusing on what you\ncan control so things that you can\ncontrol you can control your own mindset\nit might feel like sometimes you can't\ncontrol your own mindset but you are\nfully 100 in control of your mindset\nyou're in control of your attitude\nyou're in control of the way that you\ntalk to yourself you're in control of\nyour energy throughout the day you're in\ncontrol of your actions throughout the\nday you're in control of your happiness\nthose are things that you can control so\nthe important thing is to ask yourself\nis this something that i can control is\nit something i control over and if it is\na no it is something that you should let\ngo of and release and stop worrying\nabout\nbecause if you're stressing over\nsomething that you can't control you're\ngoing to stay stressed forever\nforever\nif you're trying to control that thing\nbecause if you have no control over it\nwhat will make you stress out more than\ntrying to control something that you\ncan't control so don't waste your time\nyour money your energy none of those\nthings on things that you cannot control\nonly focus on what you can control\nbecause those are the things that are\ngoing to move the needle in your life so\nthat's question number two\nis do i have control over this question\nnumber three which is a very important\nquestion that i would wake up and ask\nyourself each morning for the next week\ntwo weeks and just see what comes up\nwhat does my ideal day look like what\ndoes my ideal day look like i had this\npractice that one of my mentors years\nago had me go through it's called the\nperfect tuesday and where he had to sit\ndown and design what our perfect tuesday\nwould look like from every single moment\nfrom the second we woke up to the second\nwe went to bed and the reason why is\nbecause tuesdays are just normal days\nthey're just days it's not like a friday\nwhere you're excited for the weekend\nit's not a monday where you're like oh\nthe weekend i'm still kind of you know\nhungover from the weekend tuesdays are\njust tuesdays they're not even the\nmiddle of the week they don't even get a\nspecial name like wednesday gets hump\nday you know it's not uh you know\nthursday where thursday's friday eve and\nthen friday you have friday so it's like\ntuesday's just a normal day most of the\ntime\nwhat do you want your perfect tuesday\nlook like what do you want your ideal\nday to look like when you wake up what\ntime do you want to wake up where do you\nwant to wake up what do you want your\nmorning routine to look like do you want\nto wake up in the morning what do you\nwant to eat who do you want to spend\nyour time with what do you want to do in\nyour business or in the job that you\nhave or the career that you have or the\nchildren that you spend time with you\nknow what do you want to do in all of\nthe morning plan out your entire morning\nand what you want that to look like and\nthen you start to shift into the noon to\nafternoon time what do you want that to\nlook like what do you want to be eating\ndo you want to be eating with other\npeople who are those people that you\nwant to be eating with like what do you\nwant this ideal day to look like what do\nyou want the afternoon to look like what\ndo you want the evening to look like\ndinner what type of dinner do you want\nto have type of food you want to be\neating who do you want to be eating\ndinner with after dinner what do you\nwant that to look like do you want to be\nspending time with your family with the\ncell phone away with netflix away with\nthe ipads away with all of that do you\nwant to spend time with just your family\ndo you not have a family yet maybe you\nwant to spend your time on your own\npersonal growth or building your\nbusiness\nwhat does your ideal day look like if\nyou don't know what your ideal day looks\nlooks like it's going to be really hard\nto build into that ideal day and so the\nthird question that will help you grow\nis what do i want my ideal day to look\nlike question number four\nis what am i missing out on by choosing\nto worry or be afraid what am i missing\nout on by choosing to worry or be afraid\nnotice i use the word choosing because\nworrying and being afraid is a choice it\nmight not always feel like a choice\nbut if you're worrying you're allowing\nyourself you are choosing to stay in\nthat state you are choosing whether you\nrealize or not to focus on those things\nthat are causing you worry and if you've\nbeen listening to me long enough you\nrealize the statistics i say it all the\ntime psychologists found that about 85\npercent of the stuff that you worry\nabout never even actually happens 85\npercent of what you worry about never\nhappens\nso if you're focusing on those things\nthat means 85 percent of the stuff that\nyou spend your energy your mental and\nphysical energy worrying about never\nactually happens imagine what could\nhappen if you replaced that mental\nenergy that you have been choosing to\nwork and\nwaste\non just\nworrying and being afraid and whatever\nit is that you're focusing on imagine if\nyou took those things that don't happen\nand you were to focus on things that you\ndo have control over that you can do and\nstop wasting your energy and your mental\ncapacity on those things that you have\nno control over so what am i choosing to\nworry about\nor to be afraid of\nthat's question number four\nonce again you can pause me at any time\njust go for it just start asking\nyourself these questions if your brain's\nalready starting to go question number\nfive is what is the most important thing\nin my life one of the things that i\nfound with a lot of people is that they\ndon't have a whole lot of focus as to\nwhat their most important things are so\nif you can identify what the most\nimportant thing in your life is you can\nbuild a life around that so\nfor some of you listening it might be\nyour family it might be your children it\nmight be your\nyour brother sister your parents it\nmight be your spouse might be your\nboyfriend girlfriend what is what is the\nmost important thing in your life\nand what do you want to build around\nthat most important thing in your life\nfor some of you it might be family for\nsome of you it might be your happiness\nokay what do i need to do to build a\nlife around that happiness and to create\nmore happiness in my life for some of\nyou guys it might be love like love\nmight be the most important thing for\nyou even if you're just single love\nmight be the most important thing well\ndo i have friends that i can love on\nmore do i can i love on myself more can\ni make loving on myself the most\nimportant thing that i do if i'm single\ni have nobody that i live with i might\nlive in a different city or a different\nstate than my entire family\ncan i focus on loving myself if love is\nthe most important thing\nso you start to build a life focusing\naround what the most important thing is\nto you so that the most important thing\ngrows and gets better because what you\nfocus on you will get more of what you\nappreciate appreciates\nokay it might be your freedom your\nfreedom might feel like the most\nimportant thing to be able to free be\nfree and to travel and to you know build\nyour own business so that you can go\naround the world and do some work from\nbali and go to tulum and do all of those\nthings your freedom might be the most\nimportant thing well how can i focus on\nthe most important number one identify\nwhat the most important thing is and\nthen number two focus on that thing and\nhow it can make that thing much better\nthan it already is this needs to be your\nnorth star in your life and what i mean\nby north star is that if i'm heading\ntowards the north star\nyou're heading in that direction no\nmatter what so if i'm like hey this is\nthe number one thing in my life i'm\nheading towards that direction of this\nnorth star and everything that i do at\nall points in time the the uh\nit might have to move and shift and\nthere might be detours and there might\nbe you know a path might change a little\nbit but the actual direction of where\ni'm heading never changes\nso that becomes your north star what is\nyour north star in your life you have to\nknow what your north star is you have to\nknow what you're standing for because if\nyou don't stand for anything you're\ngoing to fall if you don't stand for\nsomething you're going to fall for\nanything and so you have to know what\nthat most important thing is and then\nnumber six\nanother question to ask yourself often\nis will i remember this in five years\nyou know the majority of the things that\nstress you out right now that have been\nstressing you out today that have\nstressed you out yesterday the day\nbefore that you're not going to remember\nany of this you're really not going to\nand so you ask yourself will i remember\nthis in five years one of my very first\nmentors used to always say this to me he\nused to always say if i won't remember\nit in five years i don't spend more than\nfive minutes thinking about it i don't\nspend more than five minutes worrying\nabout it stressing out whatever it is\nlife\nhey life is up and down it's crazy it's\nall over the place it's beautiful it's\ntragic it's it's a lot of different\nthings and so if it's something that you\nwon't remember\nin five years don't spend more than five\nminutes freaking out about it but if you\nwant to if something stressful comes up\nif you get bad news give yourself five\nminutes if you want to you can scream\nyou can throw things you can throw\npillows you can break things whatever it\nis that you want to do you give yourself\nfive minutes to freak the hell out about\nthat thing\nafter that five minutes is up you know\nset a timer on your your phone after\nthat five minutes is up you move on and\nyou go on and you do something different\nwith your life and you stop worrying\nabout the things that don't matter\nand you go all right\nif i'm not going to remember this\nconversation with this person that said\nthis thing that i didn't enjoy\nin five years i'm not going to spend\nmore than five minutes on this thing\nbecause if it's not going to be\nremembered in five years is it really\neven worth the five minutes in the first\nplace and so the question is will i\nremember this in the next five years if\nyou can't remember it if it doesn't seem\nlike something that's going to be you\nknow a big life-changing event that\nyou're going to remember in five years\nspending more than five minutes is a\nwaste of your time it's a waste of your\nenergy you don't get time back you don't\nget the energy back throughout the day\nso focus on all right i'm gonna give\nmyself five minutes to freak out about\nthis and then what i'm gonna do is i'm\ngonna start focusing on those things\nthat are the most important to me i have\ngrieved this relationship or this\nfriendship or this person that just said\nthis to me or this you know fire that i\nhave to put out at work i'm going to\ndeal with it i'm going to freak out for\nfive minutes and then i'm going to get\nmoving i'm not going to spend the next\nday two days week five weeks freaking\nout about this thing there are some\npeople\ntoday right now possibly even listening\nto this episode that are still pissed\noff about something that happened to\nthem 10 years ago what a waste\nyou have a very precious life that you\nhave in a very limited amount of time\nand mental energy stop wasting it on\nthings that do not matter and if you\nwon't remember it in five years it does\nnot matter that much\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering
