    "transcript": "there is nothing that i have found\ni mean i don't do any drugs you don't\nneed that there is nothing that i have\nfound that gives me more energy that\nforces energy through my body into my\nbody then\ni feel like i can run through a freaking\nwall\ntoday we're gonna be talking about five\ndifferent keys to have more energy i\nthink in my personal opinion this is my\nopinion so i'm just gonna tell you what\ni think i think that one of the most\nimportant things in your entire life is\nyour energy when you look at it we're\n99.9\nenergy anyways so shouldn't we focus on\nthat more than anything else the energy\nthat we have because\nthink about this if you want to create\nan amazing life and you have this big\ndream and you have these goals and\nyou've written out your goals and\neverything is just you're doing it it's\nit feels good you've got it all figured\nout but then you wake up in the morning\nand you don't have the energy to\nactually take action\nwhat happens\nnot a whole lot and so in order to get\nthings done you have to have energy\nmental energy physical energy spiritual\nemotional energy all of these energies\nbehind to get you to move in that\ndirection so one of the most important\nthings that you should be focusing on\nevery single day is your energy\nthroughout the day one of the things\nthat i focus on more than anything else\nthroughout the day is my energy\nthroughout the day and so\ni'm gonna give you a couple keys to help\nyou have more energy throughout your day\nlet me give you five keys number one tip\nnumber one it is very rare that you can\nwalk into my house and not have music\nplaying i am a firm believer in music\nand how it motivates inspires and moves\npeople and especially me and so one of\nthe things that i talk about is the\nmusic that you listen to what are the\nwhat's the music like that you're\nlistening to i notice sometimes that we\nwill uh in my house we put on uh lord\nand i meditate on the couch together and\nwhat we'll do is we'll put on a youtube\nvideo that has literally just like three\nhours of meditation music and we'll\nmeditate until we just decide that we're\ndone meditating and sometimes what we'll\ndo this literally happened today i\nrealized it is then we'll go about our\nbusiness for the day we'll start getting\nready we'll make some breakfast all that\nstuff\nand it will continue to play because we\nleft it on and then i walked into the\nkitchen earlier and i was like oh man\nlike\nyou know i kind of feel kind of feel a\nlittle bit tired and i was like oh\nbecause that freaking music is still\nplaying like there was no motivating\nmusic moving me around and so usually\nwhat i'll do is i'll change my music\nthroughout the day depending on how i\nwant my energy to be throughout the day\nmusic is energy music is sound and\nvibration\nyou know that it's literally made of\nenergy sound vibration all of that is\nliterally the human\norganism and so\nwhen you think about the music that you\nlisten to\nif you don't have a whole lot of energy\nare you sitting in silence\nno that's not a bad thing to sit in\nsounds depending what you want but if i\nhave something like guaranteed when i'm\nabout to go into the the gym i'm about\nto go into our garage and work out i\nswitch the energy in the house about 30\nminutes before it's not slow music it's\nnot chill it's not acoustic it turns\ninto edm inside of the house and i start\nbumping the music because i want to\nstart getting my energy up and so you\ngot to ask yourself your energy is down\nwhat's the music like are you listening\nto music are you playing music can you\nput music on that is going to move you\nmore can you put on a song that makes\nyou want to dance\nalso another way to think about it as\nwell is what are the words that are\nbeing used inside of this this music\nthat you're listening to have you ever\nthought of that before like what are the\npeople saying are they saying\ngood things that you're repeating out\nloud because words are affirmations\nmusic and is affirmations as well so if\nyou're saying lyrics\nare those lyrics that you believe in or\nare you listening to some music that's\nsaying stuff where you would never say\nthat you know\nto somebody on the street like would you\nrepeat\nto somebody what some of the\nlyrics that you're listening to are\nthere's been some songs i've listened to\nover my life where i've been like oh\ni should probably should have listened\nto those lyrics a long time ago and\nactually paid attention to what i'm\nsaying because i am actually affirming\nstuff that i don't believe in\noutside of my body from the words that i\nuse so\nthink about the energy behind the music\nthat you listen to and also think about\nthe words that is in the music as well\nnext thing i want to talk about is the\npeople that you spend time with the\npeople that you spend time with can\nusually be one of two things\nbatteries or black holes\nbatteries or black holes let me tell you\nwhat i mean by that a person that is a\nbattery is someone that you're around\nand what does a battery do it gives\nenergy gives energy you know the battery\nthat's in the the video camera that's\nrecording this\nit's giving energy so that the thing can\nobviously be on\nso when you think about that who are the\npeople that are the batteries in your\nlife you're around them and you're like\ni'm so motivated every time i hang out\nwith john i'm so motivated every single\ntime when i get done with a great\nconversation with stacy like i feel\namazing like are there people like that\nin your life and if there's not or if\nthere's not as many as you want can you\nstart to look for them and bring more\ninto your life people that are batteries\nthat make you feel good that are like\nhell yes i'm inspired being around this\nperson going and getting coffee with\nthem for 45 minutes changes the entire\ncourse of my day\ndo you have people like that if you do\nhow often are you talking to them\nthroughout the day one of the things\nthat i think is super important is the\npower of community you know i i talk\nabout every once a while but i have a\ncommunity where i literally teach people\nhow to grow online coaching businesses\nit's called business breakthrough and\nthere's a facebook group and everybody\nwho's ever joined business breakthrough\nis in that facebook group and so people\nare able to be around other people that\nare succeeding that are pushing\nthemselves that want something better\nfor themselves there's people that are\nfriends from all over the world they\ncreate friends from all over the world\nthey meet each other they do zoom calls\nthey meet up with each other sometimes\nin person because some of them live in\nthe same local area\nthose people end up being batteries for\neach other and they motivate each other\nto do more to be more to get more out of\ntheir life do you have something like\nthat if not can you bring more people\nlike that into your life\nthose are batteries now let's talk about\nblack holes black holes are the ones\nthat just exactly like a black hole they\njust suck you in and your energy is\ncompletely gone there's some people that\nare batteries that you can spend 20\nminutes with and you are freaking fired\nup after you sen you hang out with them\nthere are other people where you can\nspend 20 minutes with them and it feels\nlike 20 hours and then after at minute\n21\nyou're like oh my god\nthe person's just their energy is so low\nthey bring me down they make me feel\nlike\nthat person is literally sucking the\ngood energy out of your body so can you\nspend less time\nno time with black holes in more time\nwith batteries people that inspire you\nto be better people that push you to be\nbetter people that want the best for you\nbecause\nyou're either hanging with batteries\nyou're hanging with black holes can you\nstart to categorize people in your life\nand hang out with the people who\nmotivate you that are the batteries and\nnot the people that demotivate you and\ntalk negatively and talk about why you\nknow they're still broke and they're not\nsuccessful and whoa is me and the world\ndoes this to me and\nstop you don't need that so that's the\nsecond second thing as far as your\nenergy goes is the people that you spend\nthe most time with the third thing is\nthe information that you consume\nyou know how i feel about the news if\nyou've been listening to me for long\nenough you know i feel about the news\nand it's not good i don't like the news\ni don't watch it doesn't ever come into\nmy awareness but\nsometimes i happen to go to places where\nthe news is playing and i can tell a\nenergy shift in my body based off of\nthat so i'm not just talking about the\nnews though there's all of the\ninformation that you consume so you have\nto start to think about you know there's\ngood information there's bad information\nthere's uh information and things that\ncome into your awareness in your brain\nthat make you feel better and there's\nthings that come into your awareness in\nyour brain that make you feel worse so\ncan you start to be very intentional\nabout brainwashing yourself with the\ninformation that you want that makes you\nfeel better that gives you more energy\nyou know if you're driving right now\nhopefully this podcast is something that\ngives you energy can you listen to more\nstuff like this whether it's my podcast\nor somebody else's podcast that\nmotivates you you can go on to youtube\nand you can actually watch motivational\nspeeches or you can watch someone that\ninspires you on youtube and you can find\nyou can listen to audible you can find\nways to consume information so that\nevery moment of your day is geared\ntowards inspiration and you get your\ninspiration from the content you consume\nand completely stay away from the things\nthat drain your energy that don't make\nyou feel good because the information\nthat you consume\nis going to make you feel good or it's\ngoing to make you feel bad but the\nbeautiful thing about it is that same\nway where you get to choose who you hang\nout with you also get to choose the\ninformation that you consume as well and\nso it's about being intentional with\nthat it's also about realizing who\nyou're friends with on facebook and\ninstagram\nthat and that information is consumed as\nwell if you've been listening to the\npodcast past few weeks i've been\nbragging about all of the people that\ni've unfriended i'm not trying to really\nbrag i'm trying to literally tell you\nhow i've done this in my life as well\ni've noticed that i will see somebody's\n15 second instagram story and be like i\ndon't feel good after watching this\nand i was like i noticed it happening\nover and over and over again especially\nin the you know past 18 months two years\nwith just things that have been\nhappening\nand i'm like you know what i'm gonna\nstop following this person i'm gonna\nstop following that person i have people\nin my family that i've started\nunfollowing\ni have people i've been friends with for\na long time that i've unfollowed\ni've defriended people i defriended over\n3000 people on facebook cause i was like\nyou know what\ni'm gonna curate the information that i\nwant coming into my brain and it's not\nlike coming from a place of like i'm\ngoing to pigeonhole myself and only see\nwhat i believe in but it is me\nprotecting my energy it's me protecting\nmy mental energy my spiritual energy my\nemotional energy physical energy me\nprotecting all of that energy because i\nonly have a finite amount of it every\nsingle day and so i'm trying to protect\nit with giving myself the information\nthat i want that i know is going to push\nme into creating the future that i want\nso be very very careful with the\ninformation that you're consuming\nthe next thing number four is the food\nthat you eat so we're talking about\ninformation that you're consuming think\nabout the food that you're consuming as\nwell some people listening to me right\nnow if you were to just change your diet\nyour energy would be completely\ndifferent if you were to change your\ndiet your energy would be vastly like\ni'm talking crazy amounts different\nbecause you're eating food that is\nliterally taking energy from you the\nmost energy-consuming thing that your\nbody does is digestion if you're feeding\nyourself stuff that takes a lot to\ndigest\nno wonder why you're so freaking tired\nafter lunch is because you're not eating\nfood that's really great to have for\nlunch and so can you pay attention to\nwhat you eat\nwhen you eat here's another really\nimportant thing as well to think about\nis if you have the time and the money to\ndo so\ngo to a doctor and get a blood panel\ndone and see if you might be\nnutrient deficient or vitamin deficient\nany sort of way this was something that\nwas crazy for me to find out but i went\nto a doctor and we did like this this\npanel it wasn't cheap but you know it\nwas worth it to me and i'll tell you why\nthat is is we did a panel and it came\nback with like hundreds of things they\nliterally tested me for every single\npossible thing that you could test for\nand everything came back amazing except\nfor there were two things that i was i\nwas deficient in that i needed to fix\none of them was like vitamin b3 i think\nit was there's a couple of vitamin b's\nthere's like a bunch of them i guess but\nthere's a couple of them that i didn't\nhave and one of them was vitamin d i was\ndeficient in as well and so he was like\nokay oh and a couple aminos and so he's\nlike all right i'm gonna give you this\nvitamin b i'm gonna give you this\nvitamin d and i'm gonna give you uh\nthese aminos he's like take em every\nsingle morning it's alright cool i\nliterally took them and within two days\ni was like holy sh i didn't know i could\nhave this much energy at 35 years old i\njust thought that i was just getting\nolder and i was like yeah you know hear\npeople like oh yeah you get old you lift\nsome energy and stuff i was like i\nhaven't felt this good in like a long\nlong time\nwhy\nsimply because i was able to not only\nfind out what i was deficient in but i\nwas also able to get like high quality\nversion of it like i didn't go and buy\nit on amazon i bought it specifically\nfrom this guy who's like obsessed with\nnutrients and obsessed with vitamins and\nfigured out the best ones are got them\nfrom them and i was like i don't\nremember the last time i've had this\nmuch energy first thing in the morning i\nwas like i don't even know if i need\ncoffee and in fact i have so much energy\nthat when i drink coffee sometimes it\nstresses me out because it's too much\nenergy and so you just gotta think to\nyourself about the stuff that you\nconsume\nthe food that you consume the water that\nyou consume you know you're drinking\nfrom the faucet are you going through\nsome some crappy filter you know can you\nstart to get water delivered to your\nhouse that's spring water that has\nminerals inside of it all of these\nthings you consume all change the way\nthat you feel throughout the day so\nthink about the food that you eat and if\nyou can go and get a blood panel done\nlook at all the vitamins you possibly\ncan see if you're deficient fix it i\nguarantee it'll help you with that as\nwell and then last but not least\nas far as energy goes if you're trying\nto give more get more energy throughout\nthe day\nforce movement every single day what do\ni mean by that force yourself to get up\nbut i don't mean force is like oh my god\ni've got to do it and you've got to\nforce yourself as like a pissed off\nversion of it but it's like hey i am\ndedicated to moving every single day the\nbeautiful thing about the body is that a\nlot of people think they don't have\nenergy but in reality they haven't been\nusing their energy sources and so if you\nwork out every single day for instance\nyour body will start to create more\nenergy throughout the day and so if you\njust tell yourself i'm going to move i'm\ngoing to move i'm going to move i'm not\ngoing to sit around i'm not going to not\ndo something i'm not going to be lazy\nanymore i'm going to make myself move\nyour body will start to create more\nenergy every single day and\nif you notice that you have low energy\nfor the day\ni don't care what it is make yourself\nmove make yourself do it get up move do\n50 jumping jacks do 100 push-ups do 75\nsquats whatever it is get your heart\nrate up and what's really interesting is\nonce you start to get your heart rate up\nyou can start to notice that your body\nand the way that you feel is going to\nchange as well\nand going along with that i'm gonna go\nahead and give you bonus tip number six\nbecause you've been sticking around for\nthe the episode bonus tip number six is\nwhen you feel like you don't have energy\nthroughout the day and you're just\ncalling for an sos\nyou know what you need to do\nget a cold shower and get your naked ass\nin that cold shower\nwhy because\nif you're in the cold shower i'm going\nto tell you all the scientific reasons\nyou can listen to the scientists talk\nabout that there is nothing that i have\nfound\ni mean i don't do any drugs chug coffee\nmaybe there is nothing that i have found\nthat gives me more energy that forces\nenergy through my body into my body than\njumping into cold water and being there\nfor a couple minutes so you know i have\na cold plunge inside of my garage when\ni'm like when i feel like i'm dragging\nass sometimes throughout the day you\nknow i work from home so luckily i can\ndo this if you work from home or if\nyou're able to do this try it out you\ncan do it in a cold shower i do it\ninside of a cold plunge pool it's\nliterally set at 45 degrees at all\npoints in time\nit is not easy it is\nsemi-torturous every single time that i\ndo it but every time that i get out\nafter about three four or five minutes\nin it\ni feel like i can run through a freaking\nwall it's like my body just somehow\ncreated all this energy and so when i\nfeel like i'm dragging ass i'll hop in\nthat i feel like a completely different\nperson as soon as i hop out of it so if\nyou work from home or you're at home and\nyou feel like you're dragging us you\nfeel like you want to get some more\nenergy go into a cold shower put your\ntimer on for three minutes do not let\nyourself get out for three minutes or\njust put on your favorite song take tip\nnumber one put on your favorite song\nthat makes you move jump dance move\nwhatever it is you got to do you put on\nthe cold shower and you do not get out\nof that shower until the song is over\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click
