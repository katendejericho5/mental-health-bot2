if you really want\nto this is your world you can do\nwhatever it is that you want\ntoday we're gonna talk about eight steps\nto relieve stress from your life if you\nhaven't noticed there's a whole lot of\nsh that's happening in the world right\nnow so don't we all just need some\npractices to make sure that we can\nah relieve the stress from our lives i\nthink that we all do and so today i'm\ngonna give you eight different\ntechniques some of them you might have\nheard before some of you probably have\nnever heard before and i'm gonna try to\nhelp you out as much as i possibly can\nso that you can feel better because if\nyou feel better you know what you do you\ngo out and you kick some ass and that's\nwhat we're going to talk about today i\nwant you to feel better so that you can\ntake action and create the life that you\ntruly want because there's one thing\nthat i do know\nwhen you don't feel good\nyou don't take action\nit's just hard to take action you don't\nfeel good when you're stressed out when\nyou're anxious it's really hard and so\nwe're going to talk about these\ntechniques to relieve daily stress that\nyou have you ready grab your pen and\npaper let's dive in number\none is\nbreathing\nsimple breathing can help you relieve\nstress there is a study that was done\nover in japan not too long ago and they\nfound out that six\ndeep conscious breaths will help you out\nand actually change your state\ncompletely let me explain why this is\nbecause i don't know if i've actually\ndove into the actual science behind it\nyou breathe in through your nose you\nbreathe out through your mouth and when\nyou breathe out through your mouth\ninstead of just going\nlike that you act like you're breathing\nthrough a straw so it's more like\nand you try to make your out breath as\nlong as you possibly can couple reasons\nwhy number one number one when you\nbreathe in through your nose you you get\nabout three times more nitrogen inside\nof your bloodstream\nthat's a beautiful thing number one\nnumber two when you breathe out like\nyou're breathing out through a soda\nstraw when you breathe out slow it\nactually slows your heart rate down so\nif you're in a very stressful\nanxious state\nyour heart's going to be\nwhat you want to do is you want to calm\nyour body down and the way to do it to\ncalm your heart rate down to slow your\nheart rate down the fastest way to do it\nthey do not know of another way that's\nfaster than breathing like this to slow\nyour heart rate down you slowly breathe\nout like you're breathing through a\nstraw so it's just in through the nose\nout through the mouth\nas long as you possibly can six deep\nbreaths if you can do more this maybe\ntakes to do six really deep conscious\nbreaths maybe a minute\nmaybe a minute and a half\nit will completely change your state if\nyou can do 10 breaths if you can do 20\nbreaths it's even better but at least\nsix not three not five not four\nsix okay so six deep conscious breaths\nsecond thing\nas you're doing this breathing if you\nwant to really add fuel to the fire of\nrelieving your stress or maybe that\nwould actually be putting out the fire\nof your stress would be even better so\nyou want to put some water on top of\nyour fire of that stress as you're\nbreathing think about one thing that you\ncan be grateful for\nanything it could be a person it could\nbe a moment in your life it could be the\nfact that you have air conditioning\ninside of your house because my air\nconditioning is out right now and the ac\nguy is going to be here about 45 minutes\nand as hot as inside of this room\nbut i don't have i can't be grateful for\nit right now but i will be grateful for\nit about 45 minutes when he comes and\nfixes it right so maybe it's that you\nhave ac maybe it's that the sun is\nshining today and it's not rainy anymore\nright what is it that you can be\ngrateful for there's something that you\ncould be grateful for so the reason why\ni say this is because what you focus on\ngrows if you're stressed out i guarantee\nyou're focusing on sh that's stressing\nyou out so if you focus on that stresses\nyou out guess what you're going to be\nmore stressed so if i want to change my\nstate i've got to change my breathing\nfirst off number two i've got to change\nmy focus and i'm going to start thinking\nabout\none thing\nthat i can be grateful for holy sh i had\nbreakfast today so many people didn't\nhave breakfast today holy crap i woke up\ntoday 150 000 people died yesterday\nthat's pretty average 150 000 people die\na day what that's nuts and you're still\nsitting here breathing\ntaking in this sweet ass oxygen that's\naround you you can breathe i mean that's\na there's so many amazing things that\nyou can really be conscious of when you\nallow yourself to be conscious so we're\ntrying to shift your body then we're\ntrying to shift your thoughts and we're\nshifting your thoughts through going to\ngratitude so what can you be grateful\nfor as you're doing this breathing next\nthing number three this is actually\nreally interesting go for a walk not to\njust go for a walk and get your mind out\nof things but there's actually studies\nthat's done i wish i could remember it\nbut i heard uh neurobiologists talk\nabout it andrew huberman he was talking\nabout when you go for a walk in the\nactual movement when you're looking\nforward so if you just take your dog for\na walk in the morning the movement of\nlooking forward in things passing by\nyour eyes on the peripheral vision\nactually calms your nervous system down\nand so if you feel stressed that's why a\nlot of people they say oh i go for a\nwalk in nature i feel so much better\nwell because you're actually having\ntrees pass you by in your peripheral\nvision it could be out of nature it\ncould be just around your block if you\ntake your dog out for a walk it could be\nyou leave your office building and go\nfor a walk down to the coffee shop\nwhatever it is just the watching of\nstuff passing by and you don't even have\nto consciously think about it will calm\nyour nervous system down so there's your\nsympathetic nervous system and there's\nyour parasympathetic nervous system even\nthough sympathetic sounds like it would\nbe the better nervous system it's not\nsympathetic means that it's actually a\nheightened state so your sympathetic\nnervous system when you go for a walk\nand you start to see these things past\nyour peripheral vision starts to calm\ndown and starts to turn on your\nparasympathetic nervous system which is\nthe\ncalm side of it so if you can\ngo for a walk and you can think about\nsomething that you're grateful for and\nyou can consciously\nbreathe it will help you out so much\nmore so go for a walk you don't have to\ngo anywhere you don't have to have any\ndestination just simply go for a walk\nand enjoy the fact that you got working\nlegs or you can breathe lungs in your\nyou breathe breathe air inside of your\nlungs or the fact that you woke up today\nthat's the next one is to go for a walk\nnumber four is as you're doing this\nlisten to very specific type of music\nthat is calming music there is music\nthat is made that simply calms down the\nhuman nervous system as well and you can\nfind this music there's actually a study\nthat was done on a a song and i'll tell\nyou the name of the song it's called\nwaitlists by marconi union there was a\nstudy that was done and found out that\nthat is the most calming song\never created by humans i don't know how\nthey figured it out but it's it works\ni've been using it for years i literally\nhave a playlist on my spotify that is\njust that song 10 times in a row it's\nlike an hour long of just that song and\nif i feel like i've got a lot going on i\nfeel like i have stress i put that song\non another song that really calms me\ndown that for years when i used to have\nmy own office and i had a few hundred\nsales reps that were under me and it was\njust a lot that i had to deal with with\nall of these sales drops and all of her\nstuff and\nyou know having assistance under me and\nhaving receptionists and having\nrecruiting that was going on all that\nstuff there were times when i would get\nextremely stressed and i would go into\nmy office and i would put a song that is\nthe out of africa theme song and i put\nit in my headphones and i would just\nbreathe deeply so if you can actually go\nfor a walk if we can concentrate on what\nyou're grateful for if you can\nconsciously breathe and if you can\nlisten to music that calms you all of\nthese things are just tips and tricks to\nhelp you calm yourself down you can\nlisten to them if you want to or you can\nstay in your height and stress nervous\nanxious state if you really want to but\nyou're fully in control of it which is\nwhat's amazing so listen to music that's\ncalming start turn off the\nhardcore death metal or turn off the edm\nthat's so fast not saying those those\nare bad i like both of them but there\nare certain times and places if i'm\nfeeling stressed the last thing that i\nwant to do is put on pantera and you\nknow just jam to that it's going to make\nme feel more stressed i'm going to put\non music that is going to actually\nscientifically proven to slow me down\nand\nallow me to calm down you breathe slowly\nyou go you focus on what you're grateful\nfor you go for a walk and you put on a\ncalming song next thing that you can do\nis write it down what's really crazy\nabout this is a lot of stuff that's\nstressing you out doesn't really matter\nthat much and a lot of times the reason\nwhy it is so stressful for you is\nbecause it's not on a piece of paper\nwhen something is in your brain\nit seems very abstract the the way to\nget there and what to create is very\nhard to figure out when it's not on a\npiece of paper and you're trying to\nfigure out inside of your brain when you\ncan put on a piece of paper you can work\nthrough it and becomes much easier so\ntake whatever it is that's really\nstressing you out and write it down on a\npiece of paper write down this is really\npissing me off right now\nthis is really stressing me out right\nnow and then ask yourself the question\nwhat can i do\nto remove this stress that this is\ncausing right maybe it's like oh i've\ngot a deadline that's coming up for work\nwhat can i do to remove the stress okay\nmaybe i can get someone on my team to\nhelp me with it maybe i can employ some\nvirtual assistants to get this done\nquicker for me to do the things that i\ndon't need to do myself whatever it is\nand you actually start to take the\nthings that are stressing you out and\nwhat do you do you take the things that\nstress you out and then you end up\nworking through them of how to make\nyourself calm down how to actually work\nthrough them so much more simple when\nyou can put it on a piece of paper so\nput it on a piece of paper write it down\nand start to figure out what the\nsolution is the next one\nyou're probably not going to like this\none most of you guys is to consider\ndrinking less caffeine less coffee\nwhatever it is you got to do if you can\nget off of caffeine your stress levels\nand anxiety levels will go down a ton\nbut if you can't simply try to switch to\ngreen tea for a little while green tea\nstill has caffeine so you can still get\na little bit of a caffeine cake it also\nis processed differently by your body\nthan coffee is if coffee is what you\nnormally drink\nbut instead of drinking five coffees can\nyou drink three can you drink\ntwo and then a couple\ngreen teas if you if you have to so what\ncaffeine does is caffeine will actually\nstir up the sympathetic nervous system\nwhich is the part of your nervous system\nthat stresses you out so if you can have\nless caffeine i promise you you'll see\nyour stress levels go down you might be\nlike oh my god my productivity levels\nwill go down as well well i mean if you\nwant to be stressed out all day long in\norder to be productive you can choose to\ndo that this is your world you can do\nwhatever it is that you want but if you\nwant to feel better and have less stress\nand have less anxiety consider cutting\ncaffeine out\nthe next thing\nis this it's actually something that's\nreally interesting get your blood levels\nchecked eight weeks ago i went and got\nmy blood levels checked in this massive\npanels it was like they took it felt\nlike gallons of blood out of me and they\ndid every single possible test that you\ncould and it wasn't the cheapest thing\nin the world to do and you could do\ncheaper version of if you want to but\nwhat we found out is that besides\neverything was great everything was\namazing except for two things i was low\nin vitamin d i was low in vitamin b and\nmy doctor gave me uh liquid supplements\nfor both of them i take them in the\nmorning on an empty stomach\nholy sh i didn't know how different i\ncould feel by doing that and i told\nmy friends i was like i feel like a\ndifferent human like i have\nmassive amounts of energy and i'm way\ncalmer\nwith all of this mass amounts of energy\nsimply because i didn't realize that i\nhad deficiencies in vitamins that i\nneeded inside of my body and now i take\nit every single morning and i feel\namazing and so one thing that would be\nsmart to do is go to a doctor get your\nlevels checked if you're really stressed\nout you might have different levels\ninside of your you know might be\ndeficient in some vitamins you have too\nmuch cortisol you might have too much\nadrenaline going through your body and a\ndoctor will be able to work through\nthose things with you so\ni do recommend checking it out i would\nhave never thought of this except for\ntwo months ago when i went and had this\nchecked and how different i feel on a\ndaily basis so i recommend one thing you\ncould actually try is going and getting\nyour blood checked to see if there might\nbe any deficiencies or any abnormal ad\nabnormalities that are inside of your\nblood that possibly you know working\nwith a doctor could help another thing\nthat you could do is you could watch 10\nminutes of comedy watch stand up comedy\nwatch tv favorite tv show whatever if\nyou feel massive amounts of stress watch\n5 to 10 minutes of comedy the reason why\nis because comedy and laughing releases\ndopamine into your body why is that a\ngood thing because dopamine actually\nlowers the amount of cortisol that's\ninside of your blood so if you're\nstressed out cortisol is the stress\nhormone inside of your body if you want\nto lower your stress hormone your\ncortisol dopamine will do that dopamine\nis released when you laugh out loud and\nso if you watch something and truly\nenjoy it you'll actually lower your\nlevels of stress and cortisol simply\nfrom laughing because it releases\ndopamine knowing the neurobiology of how\nyour brain works\nwouldn't it be really good just to take\n10 minutes every single day and to watch\nyour favorite comedian or to watch your\nfavorite tv show or something just for a\nfew minutes whenever you're starting to\nfeel stressed so that you can calm\nyourself down wouldn't it be amazing\nidea take a five minute break take a 10\nminute break watch a comedian whatever\nit is that you have to do take ten\nminutes of your time\nand watch something that's gonna make\nyou laugh hang out call a friend who's\nreally funny that you know is gonna make\nyou feel good because that feel good is\ndopamine release being into your\nbloodstream and that that dopamine being\nreleased into your bloodstream is going\nto lower your levels of cortisol which\nmeans that you are not going to be\nstressed out simply because you are\nenjoying your life\nhow is amazing is that that's ridiculous\nso the reason why i think this is\nimportant is because there's so much\nthat's going on in the world right now\none thing that i didn't put in here that\ni should put on this list stop watching\nthe news and unfollow as many people as\nyou possibly can on instagram that are\nnot making you feel better if someone's\nposting a lot of political posts a lot\nof scare tactics that post a lot of\nstuff that doesn't make you feel good\nafter you see it unfollow them stop\nwatching the news be in your own lane\nand work on yourself and getting\nyourself better\nthat is what is super simple about it\nbut you are in charge of how you feel\nthroughout the day whether you realize\nit or not with these tactics and these\ntechniques you can make yourself feel\nbetter you can take control of your\nnervous system and you can allow\nyourself to get into a beautiful state\nso that you don't have to stay in a bad\nstate all day long and it's not hard\neverybody\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if you\nhave stress and anxiety realize that it\nis normal\n[Music]"
