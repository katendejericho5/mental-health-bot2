    "transcript": "and i was sitting there i was like i\ndon't\nknow how i got here\ni don't know\nwhat i'm supposed to do to get myself\nout of here who were you before the\nworld told you who you're supposed to be\nso who am i oh let's get really deep\nright at a core level who are you\na few weeks ago was my 35th birthday\nparty and we had a bunch of people come\nover to my house uh this house that we\njust newly moved into not too long ago\nand uh we probably had 25 people come\nover to the house and there's a bunch of\nfriends that lived around town and one\nof my friends who came over\nis a friend who just recently moved to\naustin\nand he was actually my roommate in\ncollege for my last year of college\nright before i dropped out to go start\nmy business\nand uh and i kind of went into\nwe're all sitting outside we're all\nhanging out we're all talking\nand i was looking over at him and i this\nflashback to when we used to be\nroommates and how different\nmy life is now compared to the way my\nlife was then now we were roommates uh\n2008 going into 2009. so we're talking\nuh at this point in time about 12 years\nago right 11 12 years ago or so\nand\nat that point in time my life was only\nabout a couple things my life was how\ncan i get drunk as quick as i possibly\ncan\nand how can i do a whole lot of drugs\nright and i'm telling you this because i\nwant you to understand i'm i'm not this\nperfect person who's just been this\nmaster of mastermind like of my mind or\nanything like that for my entire life\nthe way i get into doing what i do now\nuh in in the way i get into teaching\npeople about mindset is because i had to\ntry to master my own mindset to get to\nwhere i am and so people think that i\nwake up and i'm just highly motivated\ni'm just driven all this stuff\nno i have to work on myself sometimes\nharder than anybody else that i know but\nthat in turn has given me tools to be\nable to teach people and so when i had\nthis little flashback thinking about him\ni was like man my life is\nis way different than when we were\nroommates i'm i'm literally a different\nperson the things that i enjoy now i\nwould not have enjoyed then and if if i\nwould have met myself\nin 2009 then\n2008 2009 met myself now\ni would have gone wow\ni can't believe all the stuff that\nyou've accomplished i can't believe all\nthe things that you've done\nand i say that because i know there's\npeople out there that are listening to\nme right now\nand uh they're thinking to themselves i\ndon't know if i can get out of where i\nam i don't know if i can get out of this\nspot i don't know if i have enough\nenergy enough motivation to get out i\ndon't like what my circumstances look\nlike but i also don't see a light at the\nend of the tunnel and there's been many\ntimes in my life where i didn't think\nthat i saw light at the end of the\ntunnel\nright so when we were roommates\neverything was okay i was in college i\nwas partying and getting drunk as quick\nas i could and\nsmoking weed and doing whippets and\ndoing all that stuff that crazy college\nkids do right\nthen after that i moved out he moved out\ni went and started my own company and uh\nit went well for a while and then it\ndidn't go well\nand i was working so much i started\nactually resenting the place that the\ncompany that i was building because i\nwas literally working 110 hours a week\nfor years\nand i was working and i was working i\nwas working myself to bone i had a\nquarter life crisis and i was just over\nit didn't want to do anymore i ran to\nthe ground\nand i had a moment of i don't know how\ni'm gonna get out of this and if you've\nbeen listening to the podcast long\nenough you know this moment it's when i\nwas sitting there and i was uh living\noff of pasta for two months i was five\nfive months behind in my car payment and\nmy car was about to get repossessed\nand i was sitting there i was like i\ndon't\nknow how i got here\ni don't know\nwhat i'm supposed to do to get myself\nout of here there's no one that i know\nto ask for help and i don't want to be\ndoing this anymore all of the money that\ni did have i had saved about forty\nthousand dollars about eight months\nbefore then i used into my business i\nlost all of it the marketing money\ndidn't come back\nso i was at a point where i didn't have\nanything i was negative i was over\ndrafting non-sufficient funds in my bank\naccount so they're charging me 40 bucks\nfor every charge even though i didn't\nhave the money inside of my bank account\nand so i thought it's so crazy to think\nabout how different my life is now\ncompared to how my life was thin\nand then i thought to myself\nman\nthe thing that has allowed me\nto get to where i am\nis this absolute obsession with always\nwanting to be better always wanting to\nimprove\nnever thinking to myself that where i\nwas was going to be my final destination\nlike just the thought of myself of i\nknow that if i work on myself i can make\nthis better\nand i want to tell you\nthat i was right\ni won't often say that i was right but\nthere was something inside of me there\nwas a gut feeling if you just keep\nworking on yourself rob it's going to\nwork out if you just keep working\nyourself it's going to work out\nand\nit did\nand i can say that i'm\nlove where i am i love i'm proud of\nmyself for all the stuff that i've done\ni'm proud of myself for the business and\nthe achievements and all of those things\nand i don't say it to brag i just say it\nbecause i know that no matter where you\nare\nyou can feel the same you can do the\nsame now you're not going to get it\nright away\nmight take you some time but i promise\nyou it'll be worth it\nand then what popped up to my into my\nhead was\nwith all of that personal development\nall this knowledge that's inside of my\nhead that's something that can never be\ntaken away from me ever right like my\nhouse can be taken away\nyou know my computer\nmy car my\neverything my\ncamera that i'm shooting this on the\nmicrophone i'm speaking into the\ncomputer that's recording and all that\nstuff it can all be taken away\nthe one thing that can never be taken\nfrom me is the knowledge that i've built\nup over years and years and years of\nworking on myself\nand that's the most important thing and\nthe reason why is because that means i\ncan always get it back\nnone of that knowledge can be taken away\nfrom me so people want to buy things and\nthey they want to do all this stuff but\ni think what's really important is is\ntrying to improve yourself at every\nsingle moment\nso then i had another quick little\nflashback and i thought to myself man\nwhen did this this personal development\njourney start\nwhen did this purse development journey\nstart when was it\nand i thought to myself i remember\nhiring my very first mentor i paid him\n500 bucks a month when i was 19 turning\n20 years old i've only paid 350 in rent\nat that time\nand i thought to myself while i was\nstill outside still my birth it's my own\ndamn birthday and i'm thinking this deep\nright there's all my friends all around\npool party all this stuff everyone's\nhanging out outside i'm going into these\ndeep thoughts like i always do because\ni'm so freaking philosophical right and\nthen so i'm thinking to myself\noh man\ni know when it really kicked off and it\nreally kicked off\nwhen my mentor told me to read a book\nand hopefully this book sales just spike\nup like crazy today\nbut the book is called the five major\npieces to the life puzzle and it's a\nsuper super short book for those of you\nguys that are looking you know on video\nit's this book right here uh it's a\nshort little tiny book for those of you\nguys that are following on just on the\npodcast that's why you need to be also\nfollowing along on instagram or\nfollowing following along on youtube as\nwell it's a tiny book i mean you can see\nit's\nprobably a hundred and let's see it's\n119 pages it's nothing super easy to\nread\nit was kind of like my gateway drug to\npersonal development\nand um so i thought to myself\ni should go inside\nand pick that book up\nand just see\nif the universe is ever going to give me\nmessages\nit's going to be now\nand i believe that if i go pick up a\nbook and i open up to a page that's a\nmessage that i need to have\nso i went in and my freaking birthday\nparty's still going on at this point\nguys my birthday is still happening and\ni'm i'm walking inside of my frickin\nhouse\nto go see if the universe wants to give\nme any messages for my 35th birthday i\nwalk into the house and lo and behold\nthe new universe decided to give me a\nmessage i'm flipping through the pages\nand i'm like you know what i'm just\ngoing to pick one and i just open up to\na page the page that i open up to\ni don't remember i was looking for it i\ndidn't get enough time to look for it to\nfind the actual quote\nbut it said something along the lines of\ndon't underestimate\nwhere you can be in 10 years by\ndedicating\nwork into yourself every single day and\ntrying to improve every single day\nand for me\nit was like this message of\n[Music]\nyou did pretty good you're still doing\ngreat like you might not be where your\nfinal destination is but were doing\npretty damn good and it was it was\neye-opening for me because i remember\nwhere i was\nwhen i wrote like when i highlighted\nthat because i highlighted the hell out\nof this book very first book i ever had\ni highlighted it i took notes all of\nthat stuff and that's what really\nstarted me into reading it's also really\nstarted me into highlighting and making\nnotes and i thought to myself i remember\nwhere i was\nwhen i highlighted that that's this is\nthe time machine i'm telling you about i\njust flashback to i remember when i was\nselling cutco selling knives in people's\nhouses and i was waiting for someone to\nshow up to her appointment and she was\nlate and so i went back into my car and\ni was inside of my 2000 i think it was\nactually no what was it it was in 1999\nnissan sentra\nit was all beat up looked like crap and\ni remember i was highlighting\nthis part\nof never underestimate what 10 years of\nworking yourself every single day will\nget you it's like the compound effect\nit's just little tiny improvements over\nyears and years and years put you in a\ncompletely different place\nand that was 15 years ago that i was\nreading that and i thought to myself\nwhat if i never read this book what if i\nnever\nhired my very first mentor what if i\ndecided to quit my job early instead of\nopening a franchise with a business what\nif i decided to go the easy route what\nif i decided to not follow my heart what\nif i decided to finish college instead\nof dropping out what if i decided to go\nthe route that i was supposed to go the\nthings i was supposed to do what if i\nwould have listened to society instead\nof listening to my gut\nand i thought to myself my life could\nhave been in a completely different\ncircumstance than it is right now\nif i would have gone the easier routes\nbut one thing that i've done\nconsistently is i've always followed my\nheart on what i felt was the right thing\nto do\nmost of the time i'll be honest with you\nit didn't logically make sense\nmajority of time it didn't logically\nmake sense but for some reason in my gut\nin my heart it felt like it was the\nright thing to do and so what did i do i\njust decided to follow it because i\nthought this feels right let me at least\nsee what happens\ndropping out of college\nto start a business that didn't\nlogically make a whole lot of sense\nthere weren't a whole lot of people at\nmy age you know at that that time i was\n23.\nthey were dropping out of college\nyeah i was 23 i still wasn't done with\ncollege for all of you guys that are\njudging me\nright i was i was i was going the long\nroute in college 23 dropping out of\ncollege so they could go and open their\nown business\nright normally at that time people are\ntrying to graduate college so that they\ncan get into\nsome company right it didn't logically\nmake sense for me to start a podcast it\ndidn't logically make sense for me to\nstart posting stuff on instagram that\nwas inspirational didn't logically make\nsense for me to try to start making\nviral videos right\nbut all of those things added up to\nwhere i am now once again i'm not\ntelling you any of this stuff to brag\ni'm telling you this just to give you my\nown personal experience of what i've\nnoticed works really well in my life and\nwhat it is is sometimes\nyou know\nlooking at the way that your quote\nunquote supposed to go and saying you\nknow what that's not what i want to do i\nknow there's some people out here that\nare listening to me right now that are\nin college and they're thinking about\ndropping out and nobody's supporting\nthem but something feels right about it\ni know there's some of you that are\nlistening and you're thinking about\nleaving a relationship because it feels\nlike that's what's supposed to happen\nfeels like you're being restricted but a\nlot doesn't logically make sense i know\nthere's some people that are out there\nthat are you have the feeling that you\nwant to quit your job and start your own\nbusiness and it doesn't logically make\nsense but inside of your gut inside of\nyour heart it makes sense i know there's\nsome people out there that are you know\nyou had a little bit of money saved up\nand the only thing you truly want to do\nright now is travel\nso you want to quit so that you can do\nit\nit doesn't logically make sense but in\nyour heart it makes sense\nand i want you to realize that following\nyour heart is always the right choice\ni've been in all of those situations\nright they're dropping out of college\nbeen in that situation i've been in the\nsituation of needing to break up with\nsomebody i've been in this situation\nquitting my job to start my own business\ni've been in this situation of quitting\na job to go travel for three months and\nbackpack around europe by myself even\nthough none of those things logically\nseemed to make sense at that point in\ntime in my life they all felt right and\ni think that one thing we all need to\nget better at is listening to our gut\nthinking about what feels right versus\nwhat doesn't what logically makes sense\nbecause ultimately as i always say your\ngut is your their gut feeling is your\nemotional compass\nright your brain tries to keep you out\nof danger it tries to keep you out into\nyour comfort zone so it doesn't tries to\nchange as little as possible\nyour gut though your gut knows what's\nsupposed to happen and when you stay in\nplaces that you're not supposed to stay\nin\nyou can feel yourself getting more\ndepressed or slowly slipping away or in\nyou know what i always say is the way\nthat i felt in certain aspects when i\nwas working for somebody when i knew i\nshouldn't be and i want to start my\nbusiness was i felt like i was my soul\nis just slowly dying inside of me and so\ni want you to realize that a couple\nthings that i've realized\nfrom this time machine from this\nflashback from this 35th birthday when i\nwent on this really\ndeep\nthought process\nwas that number one\nworking on yourself\nis always going to pay off there's never\na downside to working on yourself\nright\ninvest the time the money the energy\ninto yourself because there is no better\nroi than working on yourself i\nabsolutely promise you that i've\ninvested into a lot of different things\ni've invested a lot of different things\nfor myself into companies and to real\nestate i still to this day have not\nfound anything that gives me a better\nreturn than putting money into my own\ndevelopment business development\nperspective mindset whatever it is that\ni'm doing\nthat's the first thing i'll say to you\nand the second and it compounds over\nyears and years and years and years and\nyears so that when you look back like i\nam at 35 and see yourself at 20 years\nold 15 years later you go holy sh\nrob\nyes\nthank you\nfor having this little gut feeling that\nyou followed thank you for reading the\nbooks when you didn't need to read the\nbooks thank you for paying 500 a month\nfor your very first mentor when you\ndidn't really even have the money to do\nit none of it logically makes sense but\nthank you\nfor being wise enough to do that thank\nyou\nthe second thing that i'll say is this\nstop thinking so much of your head and\nstart thinking more with your heart\nbecause it's gonna tell you where you\nneed to go\nit will and if you stop listening to\nyour gut if you stop listening to your\nheart eventually\nit's gonna stop communicating with you\nit's going to stop telling you because\nthere's pointless at that point so if\nyou have an urging if you have a feeling\nsomething feels right\nit always is right\nso work on yourself\ndedicate your life to working on\nyourself\ndon't give up on yourself\nand when things get hard ask yourself\nwhat your gut feeling is and try to\nthink of that and follow that path and i\npromise you it will never lead you down\nthe wrong path i've been in this space\nfor a really really long time 15 years\nnow i've been in personal development\nand i'll admit before i got into\npersonal development\nbefore i get into reading before i get\ninto working on myself i thought that\npersonal development in improving myself\nwas stupid my mom when i was a child\nin my teens early teens i remember her\nlistening to tony robbins tapes and i\nwas like that is so stupid like this\nwoman's listening to another guy telling\nher how to be better i thought it was\nridiculous and\nthen when i got into the space it was\nlike this awakening of how i have built\nmyself unconsciously it's the important\npart unconsciously into someone that i\ndid not want to be anymore and i don't\nknow about you that might hit home if\nyou might strike a chord maybe you've\nrealized that who you are you just don't\nwant to be anymore you want to be a\ndifferent person not the person that you\ncurrently are and as i started improving\nmyself i started to feel like i was\nconstantly in a battle\nit was almost like there was me\nand then there was who i wanted to be\nthere was like this person that i built\nmyself up to be and then the person who\ni felt like i actually truly was and it\nwas almost like i was fighting with\nmyself like i would do things and i\nwould think things and i would think why\nthe hell did i just do that like i would\nget into an argument my girlfriend at\nthe time i'd be like why did i just say\nthat thing i didn't meet like that's not\nwho i truly am i don't want to be the\nperson that says that and i would think\nthings and i'd be like\nwhere did that thought just come from\nlike who who the hell thought that\nbecause i don't feel like i thought like\nthat's not what i want to think and it\nfelt like this constant battle\nof who i was versus who i felt like i\ntruly was behind the scenes if that\nmakes sense\nand i would think\nhow is it possible to have these\nthoughts that are so different\nthan true who these thoughts and these\nactions and these feelings that are so\ndifferent than who i feel like i truly\nam deep down inside and i realize that\neach of us has at least two sides to us\nand that's why i said bipolar it's not a\nknock on people who are actually\nclinically bipolar what i mean is it's\nalmost like there's two sides of us that\nare fighting at all points in time i\ndon't know about you but it feels like i\nhave two people that are inside of me\nfighting at all points in time i had a\nfriend that i was talking to about this\nthe other day and he's like bipolar he's\nlike i feel like i'm octopular like i've\ngot so many different people that have\nso many different viewpoints that are\nfighting inside of me and it sounds like\nan alien movie right like i have two\npeople that are fighting inside of me\nbut in reality\nit's when i take a step back and i think\nabout it it's kind of like the movies i\nused to watch when i was a kid or maybe\nthe uh the movies i watched on this kid\nor maybe even the cartoons as well where\nthere this is what they meant when you\nhave an angel on your shoulder and you\nhave a devil on your shoulder the angel\nis basically like your true self who you\ntruly are deep down below everything the\ndevil is like the conditioned self so\nlet me explain the difference between\ntrue self and conditions off because\nthis is super important for you to\nunderstand it so the angel is more like\nthe true self the devil is the\nconditioned self so there's the true\nself which is the angel\nand when i think back to who i was as a\nchild when like when i think to who i\nwas when i was three years old and i see\nvideos and tapes of me when i was a kid\ni was this sweet little kid i used to\nalways i remember i used to i don't know\nif you guys can relate to this i used to\ngo on walks and i'd come home and i'd\nbring my mom like a rock or i bring her\nlike a flower that i picked from\nsomewhere\nand it's who i was before the world told\nme who i should be\nright it's my true self it's before i\nlearned who i was supposed to be\nso it's who you are your true self is\nwho you are who you were before the\nworld before family before society\nbefore advertisements told you who you\nwere supposed to be\nthink about that who were you before the\nworld told you who you're supposed to be\nand what happens is and the reason why\nwe build up we\nbuild up a conditioned self aka get out\nof that true self\nis because at some point we were hurt\nand usually hurt at multiple stages in\nour lives we were hurt there could have\nbeen some trauma in your life so it\ncould have been something that happened\nin your life it was bef it was this is\nyou before the trauma this is you before\nthe heartbreak this is before you learn\nto protect yourselves\nand what do i mean by protect yourself\nright so\nlet me give you an example of a dog no\ndog is born aggressive there's no puppy\nthat's just like an aggressive puppy\nthat's attacking everybody else around\nobviously there's different levels of\naggressiveness and lovingness and all of\nthat stuff in each person each puppy and\nstuff but no dog is born aggressive the\naggressiveness is a defense mechanism\nthat is learned to protect itself\nusually an aggressive dog comes from an\naggressive owner or a\nowner that beats their dog and that\ndefense mechanism builds up the\naggressiveness builds up\nthat protection mechanism\nis the conditioned dog\nthe same way that we have our true self\nand then we're hurt and we have traumas\nwe have things that happen to us you\ndon't go through this life without\ngetting some scars it's just things\nhappen\npeople die we get broken up with\ntragedies happen\nyou know bullies happen people get\ntalked down to we don't think that we're\ngood enough we don't think we're smart\nenough pretty enough fit enough and we\nget down on ourselves\nand that true self starts to hide\nand so what we start to do is we start\nto build up walls around ourselves\naround our hearts so that therefore\npeople don't see who we truly are and we\nbecome a little bit of like this\nconditioned self aka the devil on the\nshoulder this is what we're told that we\nshould be we learn how we are supposed\nto be how we're supposed to act how\nwe're supposed to treat people and we\nalso we learn how to protect ourselves\nwe learn how to defend ourselves i'll\ngive you a perfect example in my own\nlife in my own situations when i was uh\nfirst became a manager\ni was about\ni was 20 when i came a manager in this\ncompany and i started training people\nand i started running training seminars\ni started running interviews\nvery very young age i started training\npeople 17-hour three-day seminars i\nwould run uh you know meetings every\nsingle wednesday for two hours for\n30 to 50 people on average i would run\nsunday meetings for 30 to 50 people on\naverage sometimes 100 people would be at\nthe meetings as well so i was in front\nof people all the time and i was\ntraining and i was working and training\nand working\nand probably about 18 months into being\na manager so i'm probably about 21 years\nold about to turn 22 i would guess i'm\nrunning the number one office in the\nentire united states out of 700 of them\nand i think i'm just hot [ __ ] i think\ni'm we're crushing it we're doing so\nwell we're making so many sales and my\nmanager at the time calls me up\nhe's like hey man i'm in town do you\nwant to go get some food i was like sure\nso he's like all right meet me at\nchipotle we go to chipotle true story\nand uh he gets his burrito before me i\nmeet him there i go ahead and i get my\nbrew and i sit down we're talking for a\nfew minutes and i can tell there's\nsomething that's not\ncoming out that he wants to tell me he\ngoes hey man i've got i've got something\nto tell you can i just be honest with\nyou\ni was like sure tell me\nand he goes okay\nthere's a lot of people that don't like\nyou\ni was like oh [ __ ] where did this come\nfrom i wasn't expecting this to come out\nand he started talking about he's like\nlisten i know who you truly are because\ni'm with you all of the time and we're\nconstantly working we're constantly i\ncan see who your true self is but your\ntrue self doesn't come out very often\nwhen you're around people when you're in\ngroups of people when you're you know\nsome it usually comes out one on one\nbut you are way more brash\nthan you need to be\nand i started realizing my conditioned\nself right i started realizing that i\nwas pretending to be someone who i\nwasn't truly deep down inside of my\nheart i wasn't that person but i was\nhurt so bad as a child in different ways\nfrom my father\nto bullies to playing in sports and the\nway that guys talk to each other and\ntreat each other and i learned to have\nreally thick skin in a really sharp\ntongue so i would strike first with\nhaving a sharp tongue so hard that\nnobody would try to come back at me and\nnobody would ever try me so it was\nbasically like i was trying to\nnot even consciously do it\nsubconsciously make myself seem superior\nto people and harder than people that\nnobody'd be like i don't want to mess\nwith this guy and that wasn't my true\nnature so when i look at who i was and\nwho i built myself up to be at 21 years\nold and i compare that to who i was when\ni see myself in videos at three years\nold i wasn't the same person right\nthat's the angel versus the devil right\nthat's the angel on my shoulder the\ndevil on my shoulder that's the true\nself me as a young age versus the\nconditioned self the conditioned self\nthat's trying to protect itself that's\nbeen through trauma that's been hurt and\nit's the aggressive dog that's trying to\nbark and scare somebody\nbecause it's really just terrified not\nbecause it's aggressive but because it's\nterrified and it's trying to protect\nitself and so i had learned that i had\nconditioned myself to be that way and i\ndidn't just like wake up to it one day\nand then just got rid of it i was like\noh i'm just i'm gonna go back to my my\nyou know perfect true self again right\nthat person still exists inside of me\nthat i was at 21 years old and i have to\nwork to diminish that version of me\nevery single day\nmuch better now than i was then we're\ntalking about this a conversation that's\n14 years ago and i still have to work on\nit and i'm definitely not as brash as i\nused to be not as uh\nsharp tongued as i used to be but i\nnoticed it start to come up sometimes\nand i have to consciously\nbring it back and sometimes i say stuff\nand i'm like oh god i didn't mean to say\nthat it just kind of popped out and i\nhave to backstab from there right and i\ndon't know about you\nbut i would much rather be my true\nloving self more than i would rather be\nmy conditioned self i want to be who i\nwas when i was a kid\nright i want to listen more to that\nangel more than i do to that devil\nand i'm definitely not perfect in any\nsort of way i still judge people way too\nfast i notice it in my head but then\nwhen i judge somebody i go okay\nthat's not who i am that's not who i\nwant to be and so that first thought\ncomes up and that's the me think me the\nwhole thing i was talking about you know\nlike almost like the bipolar nurse was\nlike there's two people inside of me\nthere's the person who automatically\ncomes up the conditioned self and then\nlike ah that's not my true self and so\nwhen i notice myself judge somebody too\nfast or say something too fast or think\nsomething's too tough too fast i then in\nmy head have to say three good things\nabout the person that i just judged a\nfew minutes ago\nright\ni have to i have to consciously try to\ndiminish that conditioned version of\nmyself because i don't want that to be\nme because it's not even truly me\nmy true self is me when i was three\nyears old i still get pissed off when i\nget cut off on the road\nstill comes out i notice it come out\nand then so i have to\nbecome aware breathe through it and then\ni remind myself that maybe this person\nis in such a rush because they've got to\nhurry up to the hospital to see someone\nthat they love because something might\nhave happened or maybe that person\nreally has to poop i don't know but i\nalways remind myself they're either in\nthe way so when i get started to get\npissed off from being cut off all right\nthey're either on their way to the\nhospital or they're on the way to the\nbathroom they either they're either\ngoing to go see someone they love or\nthey got to poop it's one of the two\nthings and that kind of takes myself out\nof that little bit of a pissed off mind\nframe and i go okay\nit's a really big deal i just got cut\noff in the road it's not am i gonna\nremember this in five years no i\nprobably won't even be thinking about\nthis in five minutes and so i noticed\nthat thought come up i notice those\nfeelings come up and i have to to take a\nstep back\nbe aware to get myself out of the\nfeelings i always say you've heard me\nsay it if you've listened to the podcast\nfor a long time when you're in the jar\nyou can't read the label i've got to\ntake myself out of the jar of my head\nand say hey what's actually happening\nhere and it starts with having that\nawareness i've got to become aware\nof who i truly am who i have been and\nwho i want to be\nwell that person's got a poop all right\nhey man go ahead and poop we've all been\nin that situation before where it's it's\nit's dire needs you gotta get there\nmaybe that's what that person why that\nperson cut me off right you can't\ncontrol your first thought but you can\nalways control your second thought your\nfirst thought will pop up\nand then you gotta think is that the\nthought that i wanted it isn't okay that\nwas just my conditioned self that was\njust the devil on the shoulder it'll pop\nup but it's about the awareness of going\nyeah that's not who i want to be in my\nfuture i don't want to be the person\nthat's sharp talking i don't want to be\nthe person that gets pissed off at\npeople just for cutting them off i want\nto be more calm more loving whatever it\nis\nand then just keep working through it\nthe important thing though is not to\njudge yourself because a lot of times\nwhen people start to work on themselves\nand they notice that person cut them off\nand they notice them getting pissed off\nand then they start judging themselves\nwhy would i judge myself that's not who\ni truly am and then get pissed off no\nit's about all right i've got the\nawareness i see how it is let me go\nahead and help myself work through this\nand it's kind of like the the ants will\nstill pop off they still pop up ants\nstands for automatic negative thoughts\nthose automatic negative thoughts are\nstill going to pop up\nit's just the way that life is i don't\nknow if you'll ever get rid of the\nautomatic negative thoughts i don't know\nif i'll ever get rid\nof the\ncondition itself but i'm\nnoticing that over years of working on\nmy self-worth myself it starts to get\nsmaller and smaller and smaller and\nsmaller i start to notice myself of\nyears of working myself to start to get\nmore back to who i feel like i truly am\nthe automatic negative thoughts are\nstill going to pop up\nthat automatic negative thought which\nautomatic means automatically first\nis the first thought once again you\ncan't control your first stop but you\ncan always control your second thought\nso what usually happens is it makes it\neasier for you\nwhen emotion is high logic is low so if\nyou notice yourself getting into high\nemotion situations where you feel a lot\nof emotion when your emotion is high\nyour logic is low that is the worst time\nto try to think critically try to think\nlogically of what i should do now and so\nthe best thing to do is noticing\nwhen your conditioned self will pop up\nand you don't want that conditioned self\nto be there\nand to make a plan when the emotion is\nnot high so if you notice yourself get\npissed off don't come up with a plan\nthen but later on when you cool down say\nokay that wasn't my true self that's not\nwho i want to be that's not\nrepresentative who i feel i truly am so\nwhat can i do to make sure\nthe next time that happens again i'm\ngonna have a plan right now that i'm\ngonna create the next time that that\npops up and i feel very emotional or\npissed off or whatever it is that i have\na plan of exactly what it is that i'm\ngoing to do\nso the automatic thoughts automatic\nnegative thoughts are going to pop up\nthe judgments are going to\npop up the you know sharp tongues are\ngoing to pop up all of those things are\ngoing to pop up at some point in time\nyou have to make a plan right now what\nyou're going to do whenever they do pop\nup because that's the journey that we're\non\nwe're just constantly working on ourself\nyou're never going to be perfect you're\nnever you know going to be exactly where\nit is that you want to be\nthis journey of life is a journey of\nself-development and perseverance and\nspiritual development of just becoming\nbetter every single day that's all that\nwe're really here to do is just to try\nto improve ourselves\nso don't judge yourself when it happens\nhave a plan and start to work through it\nyou can't control your first thought but\nyou can always control your second\nthought that first thought is usually\nthe conditioned self\nthat second thought can always be your\ntrue self who you truly are deep down\ninside\nbehind all of the protection mechanisms\nto find behind all of the defense\nmechanisms behind all of the walls you\nbuilt up for yourself all the hurt the\npain the trauma all of those things\nthere is a true self that's deep down\ninside there that's the one that you\ngotta find and that's the ones you gotta\ncome in contact with every single day 99\nof people listening to me right now or\nwatching me however you're consuming\nthis content\nyour perception of yourself is\ncompletely false and let me explain to\nyou why that is there's a quote that's\nreally good that i'm going to give you\nfrom a guy named charles cooley and the\nquote summarizes all of this perfectly\nand he says i'm not who i think i am i'm\nnot who you think i am i am who i think\nthat you think i am\nnow what the hell does that mean let me\nsay one more time i'm not who i think i\nam i'm not who you think i am i am who i\nthink that you think that i am so what\nexactly does this even mean\nwell let's dive into it most people\nthink that they are who they are through\ntheir own perception\nof what they think other people think\nthey are so i think\nthat i am the person that i see that you\nthink that i am now this is a really big\nproblem because we're dealing with a\nperception of a perception right so not\nonly is all of this completely false\nit's so far from who you truly are but\nso many people i'm gonna tell you why\nthis is but so many people have built\ntheir entire lives their entire identity\neverything that they know about\nthemselves that they love about\nthemselves that they hate about\nthemselves off of a perception of what\nthey think that they actually are and it\nall starts off because in reality the\nway that we learn the world and how to\nnavigate through the world\nis through our parents but we also learn\nwho we are\nthrough our parents we start off and we\nbecome who we think our parents think we\nare that's the reason why parents need\nto be so careful with what they say\naround their kids and what they do\naround their kids because the children\nare literally going to build themselves\nup based off of what they see what they\nthink what they hear children become\nwho they think their parents think they\nare right and you know it's terrible but\nsome children are verbally abused when\nthey're younger it's a terrible thing\nand a lot of people never get over it\nwhy because even though a lot of people\nconsciously know as adults once they\ngrow up they consciously know that the\nthings that may have been said to them\nwhen they were not when they were you\nknow little tiny children and they were\njust a sponge they might consciously\nknow those things are false but in their\nsubconscious their subconscious is still\nholding it as true because they're not\nconsciously thinking a lot as a child if\nan adult comes up to a child and says\nyou are stupid the child a lot of times\nis you know two three four years old is\nnot sitting there and actually saying\nwell is this true is this false is this\ntrue is this false it's like a big human\njust came up to me and told me i'm\nstupid they're smarter than i am i don't\nknow how to navigate this world\nperfectly still so they must be right i\nmust be stupid and some people will be\ntold something by an adult as a child\nand they take that as their truth and\nthey act like it's their truth for the\nrest of their life but the problem\nwith that is that we're living our lives\nthrough what we see in other people and\nwe also have a\nreally\nbig problem and the big problem is that\npeople who are talking to you\nas a child as you're growing up as a\nteenager and even right now every single\nperson has a skewed perception based off\nof their childhood so looking\nto somebody else\nfor information on who you are is like\nlooking into a broken mirror to see what\nyou look like let me say that again\nlooking to someone else for information\nabout who you are is like looking into a\nbroken mirror to see what you look like\nyou'll never\nsee the true picture because everybody\nwho you talk to has different paradigms\nand different perceptions of the world\naround them and so you're going to be\nseeing yourself through this broken\nperception which isn't true and so if\nyou if you base off your if you base\nyour entire life based off of someone\nelse's perception you're going to be\nliving something that's completely false\nimagine this real quick and i'll bring\nthis together so it makes more sense and\nit's not as abstract let's imagine that\nyou remind someone of their dad\nright maybe you look like him maybe you\ntalk like him maybe you know you uh you\nhave the same type of personality\nwhatever let's just say that they loved\ntheir dad he was an amazing man he did\neverything that he could he's still\naround he loves the hell out of this\nperson and you remind\nthat person of their dad then they are\ngoing to have amazing feelings around\nyou and that's going to show when they\nare around you and when someone has\namazing feelings towards you and they\nlet that show\nwell what's going to happen it will make\nyou feel good about yourself and you'll\nthink man i must be a good person i must\ni must you know you feel good when\nsomeone feels good around you right so\nif they love if you remind someone of\ntheir dad\nwhatever it is that reminds them\nthen you're going to have this\nperception of yourself through that\nperson who love their dad and be like\ndamn i must be really awesome because\nthat person really liked me okay now\nlet's flip it\nlet's say that you just happen to look\nlike their dad or you look like their\nmother if you're a female let's say\ntheir dad or their mom was a terrible\nperson and you just happen to look just\nlike him\nthen what are they gonna think of you it\nhas nothing to do with you and who you\nare it has everything to do based off of\ntheir perception of another person in\ntheir childhood that they're bringing to\nthem now they're not going to like you\nnot because it's your fault\nbut simply because of their own\nperception of what you remind them of\nand it might make you feel worse about\nyourself because you don't even know\nthat you remind them of their dad\nneither one of those situations whether\nthey like you or whether they don't like\nyou based off of whether they like their\ndad or whether they don't like their dad\nneither one of those has anything to do\nwith you and that's why this is so\ndangerous that's why it's so important\nto find out who you are\nand decide who you're going to be\nyou know if i ask you right now\nlet's play a game let's do this together\nif i ask you who are you\ni want you to answer right now answer it\nin your head who are you\nanswer it think about that for a second\ntake a few seconds who are you say it\nout loud bring as many things into your\nconscious awareness that are you that\nsay who you are\nright\nand so you know some of you might say\nyour name oh i'm rob dial some of you\nmight say i am a mother of two i'm a\nfather of three i am 35 years old i am\nfrom florida i am a brother i am a\nsister i am a cousin i have i am a ceo\nof a beverage company i am a janitor at\nthe beverage company whatever it is\nyou're going to say these things i'm a\ncollege graduate i went to the\nuniversity of florida when i asked you\nwho you are you're going to start naming\noff external things\nbut none of those are actually who you\ntruly are\nnone of those things your name the fact\nthat you're a mother or father your age\nwhere you're from if you're a brother\nsister if you went to college if you\ndropped out of college if you got a\ndegree if you got multiple degrees none\nof those things are actually who you\ntruly are i'll give you an example that\nmakes let's let's just really try to\ndumb this down as much as possible so i\ncan just like make it so it's as simple\nas i possibly can i drive a 2018 ford\nraptor i am not a 2018 ford raptor right\nnow you might be like oh yeah that makes\ncomplete sense of course you're not why\nwould i ever think that you're a car\nwell i bought the car which means that i\nhave quote unquote achieve the buying of\na car\nso then why would you if i'm not a ford\nraptor\nthen why are you a college graduate why\nare you a mother why are these are all\nthings that you have done and some of\nyou think that you're a mother or father\nwhich you are but at the deeper level\nright at the deepest sense\nyou were someone else before you birthed\nchildren\nweren't you\nwho were you\nbecause you're always looking to the\nexternal to figure out who you are\nyou're always looking to other people or\nyour accomplishments or your pay or your\njob or what is it you do or your name\ntag to figure out who you actually are\nbut at your core level that's not who\nyou are\nright if i say i'm rob dial that's just\na bunch of you know\nsounds that were put together and given\nto me at birth i wasn't rob dial when i\nwas born though\nso who am i oh let's get really deep\nright at a core level who are you this\nis why so many people have so much\ntrouble when their children leave and\nthey become empty nesters\nis because they are they they're like\nfor years for 18 20 25 30 40 years\nsometimes they have identified\nthemselves as a parent well then when\ntheir their children leave and they\ndon't have somebody to parent they're\nalways like well who the hell am i\nand it becomes this big wake up life i\ndon't know who i am because people base\nwho they are based off of the external\nnot the internal we base it off of other\npeople's perceptions as well\nwe base everything off of other people's\nperceptions or the external but none of\nthose things are actually who you truly\nare you weren't a parent when you were\nfour years old were you\nso being a parent is something that\nyou've done it's something that you've\naccomplished i'm not saying there's\nanything wrong with being a parent but\nyou weren't a parent when you were four\nyears old\nso who are you\nyou know i wasn't a ford raptor driver\nwhen i was four years old either these\nare all just external things that we've\naccomplished over time or gotten over\ntime so you have to stop basing\nwho you are\noff of other people's perceptions of you\nor external accomplishments or things\nabout you now\nthis might be really messing with some\nof your minds but when you really get it\nyou can actually see how powerful it is\nbecause if you are none of those things\nthat you actually think that you are\nthen what are you\nyou know are you just a spiritual being\nor a soul or whatever you want to call\nit that's just inhabiting this meat suit\ncalled your body right think about that\nand this is why it's so messed up and\nthis is why we could go so deep into it\nright i'll give you a really good\nexample through a story and how this can\nchange how this this little tiny mini\nperception can completely change your\nlife right there's a story about\nthis kid and he's uh in the 11th grade\nand he's been failing all of his class\n9th grade 10th grade barely getting into\nthe next grade and his parents are\ncalled in because he has this you know\nhe's about to have to probably redo the\n11th grade he's getting terrible grades\nhe's not showing up at school he's not\nhanging out the right kids all that\nstuff then his mom forces him to go take\nthe sat because she's like i really want\nyou to get education i really want you\nto turn your life around and he's like\nit doesn't make any sense i'm stupid i\nfeel all of my tests i've never gotten\ngood grades i'm barely getting by and\ni'm not showing up to school because i\nknow how stupid i am she's like just go\nand take the sat so he goes and takes\nthe s.a.t and for those of you guys that\naren't in america s.a.t is just a test\nthat you have to take in order to get to\ncollege and he takes the sat this stupid\nkid quote unquote stupid kid\nfailing in school not showing up not\nhanging out with the right people\ngets a 1480 out of 1600 which is that's\nlike the top five percent he gets a 1480\nout of 1600 he gets such a good grade to\nshow him how smart he is his mom\nactually thought he cheated but he\ndidn't cheat and he realized he didn't\ncheat he knew he didn't cheat and he\nwent oh my god\ni'm actually smarter than i thought i\nwas what the hell have i been doing\nand so he looks at this and says i'm\nsmarter than i thought i was maybe i if\ni did so well in the sats imagine what\nwould happen if i started studying so he\nstarts waking up earlier so that he can\nstudy he starts changing who he's\nhanging out with he starts showing up to\nschool more because he's like oh my gosh\nif i'm smart maybe i can actually do\nbetter and he changes his entire life\naround starts getting amazing grades\ngets into an ivy league school becomes a\nsuper successful entrepreneur\nright and here's the crazy thing about\nit every 12 years the sats what they do\nis they review all of their tests and\nthey go through them\nand when they went back through this\nguy's test he got something in the mail\nthat said that he actually didn't get a\n1480. what he got was a\n740. what happened was the machine\naccidentally doubled his score so he got\na 740 out of 1600 which is not good\nbut he thought he got a 1480. but\nbecause of the fact that his little\nliterally a couple numbers on a piece of\npaper changed his entire perception of\nwho he thought he was he started showing\nup differently he started realizing that\nhe was smart he started taking you know\ntime to to wake up earlier he changed\nthe people that he was around he started\nstudying for his exams he started going\nto school and paying attention more and\ntaking all of the notes that he needed\nto his perception of himself changed\nbased off of seeing a few numbers on a\npiece of paper and what happened because\nhis perception of his self changed he\nchanged\nnow think about how powerful that is\nfor that person to change their life\ncompletely based off of literally four\nnumbers on a piece of paper think about\nall of the things in your life that\nyou've been basing your life off what\npeople have said about you what people\nhave done the things that you've done\nthe accomplishments that you have or\nhaven't had you can be\nliterally whoever you want to be if this\nkid is failing out of school and can get\ninto an ivy league school and become a\nsuccessful entrepreneur based off of\nfour numbers on a piece of paper you can\nbe literally whoever the you want to be\nso who do you want to be\nbecause this entire episode all i've\nbeen talking about how all of the things\nthat you think you are are complete bs\nso if that's the truth then who do you\nwant to be\nyou can wake up every single day and\ndecide who you want to be and i don't\nmean i want to be somebody who's a\nmillionaire i want to be somebody who\nhas you know accomplished this i want to\nbe somebody who's driving a ferrari i\nwant to be someone who's got an amazing\nfamily i want to be an amazing parent\ni'm not talking about any of those\nthings those are all still external and\nthis is why it can be hard because we\nbase our literally our entire perception\nof everything based off external i want\nto turn it to internal who do you want\nto be before you walk out of your door\nget out of your bed who do you want to\nbe internally before any of those things\ncome up to you do you want to be kind do\nyou want to be loving do you want to be\nhumble do you want to be sweet do you\nwant to be generous who do you want to\nbe at every single moment of your life\nand how do you want to show up for other\npeople before the accomplishments before\npeople see before people decide who you\nare you decide who you want to be no one\nelse\nwhat you do is the same way that when\nyou get in your car and go to a place\nthat you've never been before you get\nyour phone out and you set your gps\nyou want to figure out how to go from\nwhere you are to where you want to be\nyou set your gps so if you wake up every\nsingle morning and you say who do i want\nto be today i want to be kind i want to\nbe loving i want to be sweet i want to\nbe generous i want to be giving i want\nto stop judging people i want to think\nthe best of people that i possibly can\nand you set your gps your mental gps\nyour internal gps for who you want to be\nit changes how you show up in the world\nand you realize that other people's\nperceptions of you have literally\nnothing to do with you but you've been\nbasing your entire life based off of\nyour accomplishments and other people's\nperception and when you're so firm into\nwho you truly are other people's\nperceptions mean nothing to you outside\ncircumstances mean nothing to you they\ndon't change you in any sort of way so\nwhat you need to do is you need to get a\npen and paper out and say who do i want\nto be\nyou decide who you want to be and then\nevery single morning you mentally set\nyour gps to become that person and see\nwhat happens in your life and how your\nlife starts to change the exact same way\nthat when that little boy got a piece of\npaper that said four numbers on it it\ncompletely changed the trajectory of his\nentire life imagine if you didn't get\nthat imagine if you got the real results\nwhere you could be the exact same thing\nis true for you what you see on that\npiece of paper of who you want to be how\nyou set your gps is going to change\nwhere your life goes from this moment\nforward\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well i'm\ngoing for longevity i realize that this\nlife thing although it can be very short\nit's also a marathon and you know what\nmakes running a marathon easier a good\nattitude"
