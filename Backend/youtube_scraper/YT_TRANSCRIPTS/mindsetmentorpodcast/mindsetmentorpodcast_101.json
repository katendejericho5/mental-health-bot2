    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to overcome and work\nthrough any anger any judgment any\ncriticism that you have towards other\npeople so that you can heal yourself and\ngo out there and create the life that\nyou want let's dive in is when you take\na step back and you look at a human what\nyou're really looking at uh as somebody\ngrows up uh as humans is we are patterns\nthat we are have developed over our\nlifetime in the majority of the patterns\nthat we have developed over our lifetime\nmost of them if not all of them are\ncompletely unconscious them and so we\nwhat we do is because of the fact that\nthey're unconscious is we develop them\nwithout really recognizing them and it's\nkind of like the phrase of the the old\ntale where it's like there's there's two\nyoung fish swimming in the water and an\nold fish swims by him and he says Hey\nguys water's nice today isn't it and\nthey look at each other and they say\nwhat what's water it's like they're in\nthe water and it's so omnipresent it's\nbeen around them their entire life that\nthey don't even realize that it's there\nand that's how a lot of our patterns are\nuntil we decide to actually start\nlooking at oursel through a lens and say\nlike what are my patterns why am I\nreacting this why why am I doing this\nand when we look at patterns some of\nthem are beneficial I don't want you to\nthink that all of the patterns are not\nbeneficial some of them are beneficial\nand then some of them are holding us\nback and keeping us stuck in life and\ncreating self-sabotage and some of those\npatterns are anger jealousy judgment\nhaving a short fuse all of those are\npatterns now when you look at the\npatterns why would we have those\nnegative and you know we would title\nthem as quote unquote negative patterns\nwhy would we have those patterns why\nwould we have anger why would we have\njealous uh jealousy judgment criticism\nhaving a short fuse you know where did\nthey come from and and why are they\nstill in our lives and um there's a\nquote by a guy named Marshall Rosenberg\nand the quote says every criticism\njudgment diagnosis and expression of\nanger\nis the tragic expression of an unmet\nneed and so this is really important\nbecause Rosenberg what he does is He\nsuggests that our how we would label\nthem as negative behaviors our\nemotions often that we had as child that\nstem from unmet needs and we still have\nthem as adults so when we criticize\npeople when we judge people when we get\nmad when we blow up at people um we're\nnot reacting to this\nsituation more than anything else what\nwe're doing is we're revealing an\nunderlying need that is not being met in\nsome sort of way and so we're really\ngoing to dive deep into this and I think\nthat there's going to be a lot of people\nthat are going to listen to this episode\nand really start to learn a lot about\nyourself we're going to dive into your\nreactions we're going to dive into your\nunmet needs and we're going to see if we\ncan start to identify any needs that are\nunmet for you and uh exactly how you can\nstart working through them and this will\nhelp you understand yourself but also\nreally help you understand other people\nas well and so when you look at needs\njust in general needs are Universal as a\nhuman for everything and we have needs\nfrom physical requirements physical\nneeds like food Water Shelter clothing\nyou know physical safety we have those\ntypes of needs uh but we also have\nemotional needs such as love respect\nfeeling like we belonged and that is\nreally emotional safety and when these\nme these needs are really unmet they\ntend to show up and manifest as negative\nemotions and behaviors and if we can\nunderstand this connection it really\nshows us a way to to look at them and\nunderstand that we're it's not really\nthe situation what it is is it's it's\nthe unmet need behind it and so it's\nit's like um when you look at somebody\nwho is who who who has anger they blow\nup at a situation the problem is not\nthat anger the problem is what caused\nall of that right so it's like anger is\nthe\nsymptom that you're seeing but it's not\nthe actual cause and so when you look at\nunmet needs and you at needs in general\nprobably the most famous uh version of\nneeds is maso's hierarchy of needs where\nhe he's it's basically if you've never\nseen it it's a pyramid and at the bottom\nof the pyramid is the most important\nones which is physiological needs and\nthen from there it goes up the pyramid\nand uh starts to go through your needs\nso the first one the most important for\nus is our physiological needs that's the\nbasic necessities for survival food\nWater Shelter sleep um the next one up\nfrom that is safety needs protection\nfrom physical and emotional harm uh\nstability security order and this would\nbe like your personal safety Financial\nSecurity your health your well-being the\nnext level up from that would be love\nand belonging needs and so that would be\nlike relationships affection being part\nof a group or Community um romantic\nattachments all of that type of stuff\nthe next level up from that would be\nemotional needs and this would be the\nneed for your self-esteem your respect\nfor yourself your respect from others\nthat you're getting um it could be\nachievement it could be status it could\nbe recognition feeling of accomplishment\num all of that and then the the last\nlevel and the top level is what they he\ncall self-actualization needs which is\nuh the need to realize one's full\npotential in order to achieve personal\ngrowth and fulfillment and so it could\nbe like creative activities solving\nproblems seeking personal growth uh\nbuilding a business that changes the\nworld or helps other people um and all\nthose would be the the maso's hierarchy\nof needs and so when you look at at\nearly childhood development I I mean\nthis part is going to be huge for a lot\nof you to really understand yourself but\nreally start to understand other people\nwho are in your lives that you come\nacross um I if you listen this podcast\nlong enough you know I almost always go\nback to childhood development because\nmajority of our patterns come from\nchildhood development and the\ndevelopment of unmet needs and their\nexpression begins in early childhood you\nknow as children we rely on caregivers\nto meet our physical and emotional needs\nand when these needs are met\nconsistently uh children develop a sense\nof security they develop a sense of\ntrust but if they are unmet or if\nthey're inconsistent children develop\nbehaviors that are aimed at drawing\nattention for those specific needs so a\nchild who feels neglected might start to\nact out to get attention from their\nparents and this is really really really\nreally important and this took me over\n30 years to really understand most\npeople listening to this podcast had\ntheir physical needs met by parents you\nknow there are some people who didn't\nhave food and shelter and stability that\nare listening right now but I would say\nthe vast majority probably over\n90% you didn't have a whole lot of like\nit wasn't like you didn't have a house\nto live in it wasn't like you weren't\nfed it wasn't like you didn't have water\num it's not like you didn't have housing\nsometimes you know some people out there\ndid not have those things but the\nmajority of people listening had your\nphysical needs met by parents but many\nmany many people don't get all of their\nemotional needs met from their parents\nand you know like for me I remember one\ntime I went to a therapist uh probably\nwhen I was about 29 30 years old and I\ntold him my whole life story and he said\nyou were neglected and I was like no I\nwasn't I wasn't neglected like I had\neverything I needed I never never like\nfelt like I wasn't going to be fed and\nhe said no because of the fact that your\nfather wasn't there you were emotionally\nneglected from him not showing up in\nmany different ways and I was like holy\n I didn't even know emotional\nneglect was something that I could have\nand I started working through those\nthings and so um you know I see this\nfrom a lot of people who I've worked\nwith over the last 19 years is is they\nwere not physically neglected by their\nparents but a lot of people\nunconsciously parents um it really\nemotionally neglected them they didn't\nfeel safe around their parents they\ndidn't feel fully loved around their\nparents they felt like they had to\nperform in order to get their parents'\nlove and I want you to understand that\nthis is not me on anybody's\nparents that's not something I ever want\nto do but everyone's parents did the\nbest they could with with what they had\nbut they learned from their parents and\na lot of us our grandparents our\ngreat-grandparents were just trying to\nsurvive physically in order to get by\nand and so like when I think about my\ngrandma told me uh her stories of when\nthey went through uh the Great\nDepression how they were just trying to\nsurvive in in feed like her parents were\ntrying to feed their family and so when\nyou're just trying to survive a lot of\ntimes there's emotional neglect that\ncomes from that and so when physical\nsafety is the most important thing\nemotional safety isn't always there and\nso it kind of goes down the line of I\nthink it's going to take a few more\nGenerations before hopefully if\ntechnology doesn't get too insane and\nget in the way for people to actually\nreally start to feel um emotional\nstability all of the time from their\nparents and so if you're a parent one of\nthe most important things that that I\ncan tell you is to to work on making\nsure that your children feel emotionally\nsecure right you need to work on\nyourself you need to work on your your\nown emotional stability but read books\nabout parenting read books about\nchildhood brain development and uh and\nhow you know if you have a child and the\ntime that you spend with them in front\nof them will help them develop their own\nnervous system and their nervous system\nis learning from your nervous system you\nknow because as children grow these\nearly experiences shape their\nunderstanding of how they express their\nneeds and so a child who learns that\ncrying or temper tantrums result in\ngetting them attention that they want\nbecause their parents are too busy on\ntheir phones that will then end up being\na behavior that they usually will turn\ninto adulthood right but a child who\nlearns that they can express their needs\ndirectly to their parents they can\nexpress them calmly and that's the most\neffective way to do it that will carry\ninto the adulthood and so let me give\nyou some examples so we can really put\nsome context this because this is really\nimportant right so I I think I have like\nfour or five examples for you to really\nunderstand this let's say a child throws\na temper tantrum a meltdown and Target\nwhen you look at that the first question\nyou to ask yourself is what is the unmet\nneed you know a lot of times that is a\nchild wanting attention from their\nparent parents in some sort of way maybe\nthey feel unsafe in a place they've\nnever been been before and that need\nthat they need is safety they need their\nparents pick them up make them feel safe\nmaybe the child is tired and they that\nneed that they have is is sleep maybe\nthey're hungry and the need that they\nhave is to eat right so when you see\nsomething happening like that which is\nan what we would call a quote unquote\nnegative emotion like the temper tantrum\nor blowing up whatever it might be the\nreal question is what is the unmet need\nat this moment you know if you see a um\nyou know let's say uh an example would\nbe uh a parent who I see this a lot with\npeople um where their parents were so\nhardcore of them getting good grades all\nof the time that they never really got\npraise or encouragement from their\nparents so if they come home with an a\nit's like why wasn't in an A+ oh you got\na 98 what what were the two points that\nyou didn't get and so they never really\ngot true encouragement from their\nparents and the child has an unmet need\nfor esteem and recognition from their\nparents they just want to be seen they\njust want to be loved for their\naccomplishment but the behavior what it\nturns into over time is that this lack\nof positive reinforcement turns into low\nself-esteem as an adult and so as an\nadult because the fact they have low\nself-esteem they might Express that as\njudgment or criticism towards other\npeople so that they momentarily feel\nlike they Elevate their own esteem their\nown\nself-esteem and that's just a really way\nto mask the feelings of inadequacy and\nso we we a lot of people will judge in\nthat reason because they don't feel like\nthey really got the unmet need that they\nhad is they really just wanted their\nparents to W they've tried really hard\non a test they got a 95 and the parent\nwas like why didn't you get a 100 and\nit's like the the child just really want\nyou to say hey I'm so proud of you you\ndid such a good job and so it's it's an\nunmet need for childhood that develops\ninto a pattern and a behavior later on\nin life as an adult you know and there's\nthere's a uh there's a thing that's\ncalled bow meister's self-esteem study\nthat was done in\n2003 and uh the actual study title was\ndoes high self-esteem cost better\nperformance interpersonal success\nhappiness and healthier Lifestyles and\nso you know they went through this whole\nthing and they found that self-esteem\nand then when they went through it below\nself-esteem is linked to negative\nemotional expressions like anger and\ncriticism so when people have low\nself-esteem that stems from their\nchildhood um usually it comes and and\nturns into anger and criticism as they\nget older and so researchers found that\nunmet needs and unmet esteem could lead\nto behaviors uh aimed at judging or\ncriticizing people in order to boost\ntheir own self-esteem Al often resulting\nin in negative interactions with other\npeople so it's really interesting to\nstart to look at that so that's that's\nanother example you know let's let me\ngive you an example of a parent child\nconflict right let's say a parent uh\ngets angry at their their their teenager\nfor staying out late and not being home\non time right the unmet need is really\nthe parent if they blow up on the child\nfor it it could be the parents need for\nsafety and reassurance and so the parent\nmight not feel safe in the world because\nmaybe they weren't really meant to feel\nsafe by their own parents whatever that\npattern was and so they don't feel safe\nin the world\nso they don't have their they don't feel\nsafe with their child being out in the\nworld and so they need that child to\ncome home in order to feel like they're\nsafe and so the parents anger is\nactually driven by a need to ensure that\nchild's safety but whatever we're we're\nlooking at from the outside world if if\nthat that parent is looking for safety\nfrom that child coming home what they're\nreally looking for a lot of times is\nfrom themselves whatever we're looking\nfor from the outside world is what we're\nlooking for from ourselves and so the\nreal question becomes if that's an unmet\nneed well then how can that parent make\nthemselves feel more safe so that they\ndon't uh grasp their children too\ntightly and it turns into resentment\nlater on in life you know let's say\nyou're um another example be let's say\nyou're scrolling on Instagram and you\nsee someone with more than you more\nhappiness more joy more uh a better body\nmore money whatever it might be in in\nyour mind you judge them and you\ncriticize them you're like oh she's\nskinny she must not eat maybe she makes\nherself throw up right or she's got no\nwrinkles she must edit her photos like\ncrazy or she probably gets Botox or you\nknow he's got a new car he just bought a\nnew Mercedes he's probably\npeople over in in order to make that\nmoney and you see somebody and you make\na judgment or a criticism on them\nimmediately and you have to realize it's\nyou it's what you're looking for from\nthe outside world is what you're looking\nfor from yourself and if you can't\naccept yourself\nthen you're probably not going to accept\nsomeone else and when you see somebody\nelse succeed you're starting to judge\nyourself for your lack of success and so\nyour reaction has nothing to do with the\nperson who's skinny it has nothing to do\nwith the person who has less wrinkles it\nhas nothing to do with the person just\nbought the new car it's usually comes\nback to what is my unmet need oh I\ndon't love and accept myself so I can't\naccept somebody else's success or\nsomebody else's looks uh and then last\nexample like you is this you know let's\nsay that you go out to dinner and um you\nblow up on your partner at dinner\nbecause they've been on their phone for\na few extra minutes than normal right\nand you don't want them to be in their\nphone and uh then you ask yourself okay\nI just I just blew up on this person\nwhat is my unmet need you know what\nwe've had a really busy couple weeks we\nhaven't had any alone time a lot of\nstuff's been going on with travel a lot\nof stuff been going on work a lot of\nstuff been going on with the kids my\nneed that is unmet right now is I really\njust want I just want quality time and I\nwant attention from them and I want to\nfeel that emotional connection but it\ncame out as anger so in this in this\nrelationship the partner signals a need\nfor quality time and attention but blows\nup on them instead and so it's the adult\nversion this is literally the adult\nversion of the Meltdown and Target the\nMeltdown and Target happens because they\nwant you know to feel loved to feel seen\nto feel held by their their their parent\nthe adult version of blowing up inside\nand and and getting mad or disconnecting\nand shutting down in a restaurant is you\nknow they want to feel seen they want to\nbe they want their attention they want\nto feel loved and so these are all\npatterns that we develop from childhood\nand it really turns into you know these\nadult behaviors and so what you have to\ndo is you have to start learn you have\nto learn to start recognizing this\nwithin yourself you know when you do get\nangry take a step back and and say what\nis my unmet need okay that's what my\nunmet need is when you feel you know\nwhen you feel like you're alone what is\nthe unmet need when you see somebody and\njudge somebody what is the unmet need if\nyour friend comes over and tells you\nabout the promotion they just got and\nyou start to feel\nlike jealous what is the unmet need that\nis there if you criticize somebody else\nwhether in your own head or whether\nverbally out loud what is the unmet need\nand really what it comes down to is us\ntaking a step back and realizing like I\nsaid we we have these majority of these\npatterns we've developed over our\nlifetime and we have no idea where they\ncame from we have no idea that we have\nthem and it takes a moment of\nself-reflection to come back and go okay\nI criticized I judged I got angry I blew\nup on somebody I had a meltdown I got\ntoo emotional what is the unmet need in\nin a lot of times what you're going to\nrecognize is what you're actually\nlooking for is what you're looking for\nfrom yourself you know if you're if\nyou're really wanting that love and\naffection from from your spouse 100% you\nshould definitely let them know but what\nyou're also really looking for is is\njust the love and acceptance from\nyourself and so you you really have to\nhave a moment of self-reflection and\nfind out what's going on and then what\nyou do is you actually just start\nnoticing your patterns start noticing\nwhen this happens um and start really\nunderstanding that if I'm being truthful\nis the majority of people can't give you\nthe need that you want if you're looking\nfor you know emotional safety if you're\nlooking for physical safety if you're\nlooking for all of that those usually\ncome from you before they come from\nanywhere in the outside world and so\nit's it's recognizing your own unmet\nneeds and then once you can recognize it\nin yourself you can start to recognize\nit in other people you know like I've\nI've said in this podcast many times\nI've been doing this now for 19 years\nI've been working with people half of my\nlife I've been working with people and\nit is really hard not to have a lot of\nempathy for people when you start to\nhear people people's stories because\nevery adult is just an unhealed child\nthat's in an adult's body and when you\nsee a guy who's blowing up and he's an\n yeah he is an he is\nbeing an we would categorize him\nas that but that's also just a little\nchild that didn't get love and affection\nfrom his dad or he is lashing out\nbecause his dad lashed out and so you\nreally start to understand other people\na whole lot more once you start to\nunderstand yourself as well and so when\nyou see\nit e"
