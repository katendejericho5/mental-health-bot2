    "transcript": "like what is actually scary about that\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nstop focusing on your fear so that you\ncan actually start getting stuff done\nand move into the direction that you\nwant and i've got a really great story\naround this so this past weekend\ni was at an event that i am a mastermind\nthat i'm a part of and there's about 80\nof us in this mastermind and the speaker\nwho was on stage was mike tyson this\nweekend and it was cool to see mike\ntyson talk because one of the questions\nthat was asked of him is somebody said\nhey mike when you were about to go into\nthe ring and fight some of these people\nwe're talking about mike tyson fought\nsome of the most dangerous people alive\nand the guy said hey you know you fought\nsome most dangerous people that have\never existed did you ever feel fear when\nyou were about to walk into the ring\nmike tyson was super honest and he said\ni\nam literally a terrified person like my\nentire life i'm i'm\nafraid all the time and he said when i\nwould find out before i would find out\nwho i was about to fight i'd be\nterrified of who that could possibly be\nas soon as i would find out who the\nperson was that i was fighting i would\nbe terrified to fight that person for\nthe six months\nup until the point where i stepped in\nthe ring and i was training every day\nevery night every day every night the\nwhole time i was training i was\nterrified just thinking about this\nperson and what we were gonna do in the\nring almost every night i had trouble\nsleeping because i was so afraid of this\nperson who i was going to step in the\nring with i was terrified the night of\nthe fight i was terrified walking in to\nthe ring and the only time that i wasn't\nterrified is as soon as the guy said\nokay fight\nand that point in time i just kind of\nwent on to autopilot and it was cool to\nsee because what he said\nwas super important he said i felt fear\nall the time but the one thing that i\ndidn't do was doubt myself let me say\nthat again he said i felt fear all of\nthe time but the one thing that i didn't\ndo was doubt myself and the reason why i\ndidn't doubt myself was because i know\nthat there are very few people in this\nworld who put more action\ninto becoming the greatest they could\npossibly be than myself my level of\npreparation was beyond what other people\nwould put into it and you start to think\nabout that and you realize this is a guy\nwhose job was to go in and\nfight and try to knock people out while\nthey were trying to knock him out he\nfelt fear his entire\ncareer\nand then you think about the fact that\nwe feel fear all the time and we think\nthat there's something wrong with that\nwe think that that fear is bad and then\nbecause of the fear we don't do what it\nis that we're supposed to do and it\nholds us back from taking the action\nthat we need to but it also holds us\nback from if we don't take the action it\nholds us back from not having the life\nthat we truly deserve but he was over\nprepared\nthe thing that was great about it is he\ndidn't doubt himself because of the fact\nthat he took so much action another\nthing that reminds me of i remember\nhearing a story\nthat i heard from jeff hoffman who is\nthe founder of priceline.com about five\nyears ago i interviewed him and he was\ntalking about how he was really good\nfriends with evander holyfield who just\nso happened to get his ear bitten off by\nmike tyson but he was friends with him\nand he remembers he was going through\nthis workout then the workout had 300\nsets and it was this crazy intense\nworkout that like no human could do he\nhad 300 sets of this workout and he was\nsitting there and he was counting them\nfor evander holyfield as he was almost\ndone and he finished one of the last\nsets and he said hey if any holyfield\ncomes up to me goes hey\nwas that 300 or was that 299.\nand jeff hoffman goes oh i think it was\n300 and he looks at him he goes was it\n300 or was it 299. and he said man i\nthink it was 300. and he looked at him\nin the face and he said listen to me was\nit 300 or was it 299 and he goes i don't\nknow evander what does it really matter\ni think it was 300 and he said what is\nit and he said he got really looked him\ndead in the eyes and terrified him he\ngoes the difference between 299 and 300\nis the difference between everybody else\nin the world and the heavyweight\nchampion of the world that's the\ndifference between 299 and 300 and then\nhe went and did an entire other set and\njeff hoffman said at that point he\nfinally understood what made him great\nbecause they put in so much action that\nthey don't doubt themselves another\nexample of this which is another fighter\njust so many different fighters i have\nthese great stories on that reminds me\nof is i have a podcast episode coming\nout in the next few months with george\nst pierre who's considered one of the\ntop five ufc fighters george st pierre\nis one of like the sweetest most humble\nkindest guys it was amazing to talk to\nhim and he's just so humble and he hates\nfighting he doesn't like fighting but he\nhas to be one of the best fighters\nthat's ever lived he just happened to be\nreally good at it and it was something\nthat could make him a lot of money and\nget him out of the place that he was in\nhe just saw it as a way to make money\nand he said he hated fighting it\nterrified him all of the time he was so\nscared of fighting all the time but the\nthing that he wasn't scared of\nwas the fact that he had put so much\nwork into himself and he had such such\ngreat abilities because of all the work\nthat he put into himself and he didn't\ndoubt himself and when he said his lack\nof doubt came from over preparation\nhis lack of doubt came from over\npreparation and he said that he would be\nterrified as soon as he found out who he\nwas fighting the whole time for the two\nthree four five months that he was in\ntraining camp he would be terrified for\nthe entire time that he's you know\nsitting out there and thinking about and\ntrying to fall asleep and going to\ndinner he said like in dinner in the\nmiddle of dinner he'd be thinking about\nfighting and thinking about fighting\nhe'd have to he was just terrified the\nentire time\nand he was terrified up until the one\npoint was about to be his time to fight\nhe would go to the mirror\nhe would look at himself in the mirror\nand he would say to himself you're\nbetter than this guy you're the best\nfighter that's out there you are better\nthan this guy you're the best fighter\nit's out there he would talk to himself\nin the mirror and what made his fear\ndisappear\nwas him building himself up\nand talking about how amazing he was and\nhe said that he would then put on a mask\nhe imagined where his name is george st\npierre after talking to himself he would\ncall himself gsp it was like his alter\nego he would be pretend that he was\nsomebody else who'd pretended he was\njust this killer this guy who was not\nafraid of anything who had no doubt who\nhad no fear none of those things and so\nhe literally would step into being a\ndifferent person and he would be that\nperson the entire rest of the night\nthat's when he said he would go on\nautopilot because he was so over\nprepared his body knew better than his\nmind for what to do in all of these\nfights so why do we say this i bring up\nthree of the greatest fighters who have\never existed\nand the beautiful thing about them is\nthat their fear is not like our fear\nlike if you have the fear of public\nspeaking\nwhat's the worst that could happen i\nmean\nyou might mess up you might screw up a\nfew lines\ni mean if you're really terrified maybe\nyou pee on yourself like that would be\nthe worst thing they get you could pass\nout i guess like the fact of that the\nthe chance of that happening is not\nreally gonna happen but what's gonna\nhappen you could stumble on a few lines\nyou could mess up some people could see\nit and see you screw up but no one's\ngonna punch you in the face\nand possibly knock you out in the middle\nof thousands of other people and\nmillions of people online so if these\nguys had as much fear as they did and\nthey still took action are you really\ngoing to let other people's opinions of\nyou what other people think of you of\nwhat could possibly happen about your\nparents judging you because you want to\nswitch careers and you don't want to be\nan electrical engineer anymore and you\nwant to decide to be a painter our fear\nif you really think about the fears that\nare holding you back from everything\nthat you want in this world\nlike if i ask you what is your number\none fear that's holding you back and i\ndon't mean like spiders or heights i\nmean like what is your fear that's\nholding you back from doing what it is\nthat you want it's not really that big\nof a deal and when you look at it that\nway it's like oh yeah i'm\ni'm really just afraid of what other\npeople might say\nabout me am i gonna die if other people\nsay things about me no if if my parents\ndon't approve of the degree that i get\nam i going to die no and you look at all\nthese things you're like none of these\nthings that i actually feel fear around\nare scary\ni'm making them to be these massive\nscary things i'm making mountains out of\nmole hills it's like they're not a big\ndeal but make them to be so big in our\nmind these guys are literally going into\na place of potential\ndeath and they're still taking action to\nget themselves there you're not going\ninto a place of potential death you're\npossibly you know if we talk go back to\npublic speaking what are you doing\nyou're getting on a stage and talking in\nfront of people there shouldn't be that\nmuch fear if you really break it down to\nits simplest forms to its simplest forms\nhere's what's happening your physical\nbody is going onto a platform that's a\nlittle bit above other people\nmaybe those people are standing up maybe\nthey're sitting down maybe they're\ntaking notes but your physical body is\nraised a little bit higher than other\npeople's physical body you're going to\nstand in front of them and you're going\nto create sounds from your face for 20\n30 minutes and then you're going to be\ndone at its simplest form that is all\nthat you're doing\nlike what is actually scary about that\nyou're on a platform physical body\npeople are lower than you and you know\nthey might be sitting down and you're\ngonna make sounds from your face is that\nreally terrifying it's not and when you\nbreak it down it's almost comical the\nthings that we're quote unquote afraid\nof the things that we have fear over so\nwhen you think about this\nhow do i make it easier on myself if\npublic speaking is the example that i\nwant to get the two biggest fears in the\nworld number one is public speaking\nnumber two is death jerry seinfeld has a\njoke around that says people would\nrather be inside of the box than giving\nthe eulogy at a funeral when you think\nabout it that way\nwhat can i do\nto make sure that there's less fear but\nabsolutely no doubt in my mind when i'm\ngonna go out there the best way for you\nto be if public speaking is the thing\nthat we're going off of the best way for\nyou to be the best public speaker and\ngive the best presentation is to be over\nprepared for every single thing for you\nto know\nyour subject the best that you possibly\ncan and so what i'm going to do is i'm\ngoing to over prepare in every single\naspect of what it is that i could\npossibly do so that\ni might still feel the fear and you\nprobably will still feel the feel\nstill feel the fear you will still feel\nit but it doesn't matter because i'm not\ndoubting myself i'm so over prepared i'm\nso ready to go into it and i know what\nit is that i'm going to do\nthat the fear is there but it doesn't\nreally matter and one of the things that\nmike tyson said that was amazing is that\nfear is just a natural human emotion\nthat's it you're going to feel fear the\nsame way that you feel tired sometimes\nthe same way that you feel excited\nsometimes the same way that you feel\nhappy the same way that you feel sad but\nwhen you're happy about something you\ndon't go oh my god i'm happy i can't\njump onto this stage and do public\nspeaking no it's just a natural human\nemotion what he said is that the\nbeautiful thing about fear is it allows\nus the strength to build up courage\nbecause you can't have any courage\nunless there's some sort of fear in\nfront of you if i were to walk up to any\nperson and say hey would you like to be\nseen as a person with courage would you\nlike to be seen as somebody who is\ncourageous to other people everyone be\nlike absolutely because courage is a\nbeautiful emotion it's a beautiful trait\nto have you can't have courage in the\nabsence of fear\ncourage can only be built when you have\nfear that's around you so you have to\nthink of that same way that you can't\ngrow your muscles unless you go in and\nlift heavier weights you can't have\ncourage and be more courageous and more\ncourageous and more courageous unless\nyou're in the presence of fear often\nthat you're working through all of the\ntime so if you want to be a courageous\nperson you have to think to yourself\ni've got to see fear i've got to feel\nfear there's always going to be fear\npresent i feel fear all of the time\nevery successful person that you could\ngo out and see in elon musk and you know\nall of the most successful people in the\nworld you go to them and say hey do you\nfeel fear sometimes they're all going to\nsay yes the difference is the feeling of\nfear does not stop them from taking the\naction that they need to in order to get\ntheir goals so next time you feel fear\nrealize what that's showing you is it\nshowing you the edge of your comfort\nzone you don't feel fear in your comfort\nzone but when you're starting to step\nout of your comfort zone like public\nspeaking the example that we're giving\nwhen you start to step out of your\ncomfort zone you're going to feel fear\ndoing something new is scary to the\nbrain because the brain only cares about\nyour safety so it doesn't know that you\nknow when you walk onto stage\nthat you're going to be safe and you're\nnot going to die because we're tribal\npeople the brightest lights gets the\nmost arrows so you have to realize that\noh my gosh standing in front of people\nit leaves me up in front of people to\npossibly be attacked we're not going to\nbe attacked or in front of people\nspeaking in front of your team meeting\nin front of 14 other people you're not\ngoing to be attacked but you have to\nrealize that fear is just this natural\nemotion that you need to learn to dance\nwith you don't need to get rid of fear\nand in fact you'll never get rid of fear\nso just get used to it you need to learn\nto dance with your fear and go okay what\nam i feeling\ni'm feeling fear\nthat's okay there's nothing wrong with\nthe feeling of fear so what am i feeling\nfear around i'm feeling if you're around\nthis okay is that fear stopping me from\nstill taking action that i need to take\nno it's not at all okay so can i still\ntake the action yes all right rob go\nahead and take the action and that's how\nyou get it is get what it is that you\nwant in life is to notice that fear is\nomnipresent it's going to be more\npresent than most other emotions if\nyou're trying to create the life that\nyou want if you're trying to step out of\nyour comfort zone if you're trying to do\nthings you've never done\nfear should be omnipresent but it\ndoesn't mean that because fear is there\nyou're not going to be able to work\nthrough it the same way that evander\nholyfield the same way that gsp the same\nway that mike tyson all felt fear the\nbeautiful thing about the thing that\nmade them some of the greatest in the\nworld is that when they felt fear they\ndid it anyways\nthey never doubted themself they over\nprepared and in\nthat state they were able to build more\ncourage than anybody else around them so\nfeel the fear and do it anyways\n[Music]\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well so i'm\ngoing to take a guess that i probably\nknow 95 percent of you what you're\nfurious how many of those can kill you\nthe answer is zero we're actually born\nwith only two fears the fear of\nand the fear\n[Music]"
