    "transcript": "something felt right i don't know what\nit was but it was something that lit up\ninside of me that had never lived inside\nlive inside of me before when something\ndrains energy from you that is the\nuniverse telling you hey dude this ain't\nit every single second is here for you\nto grow\none of the questions that i get asked\nmore than anything else on social media\nis how do i find my passion how do i\nfind my purpose how do i find\nthe way that i can come alive and what\nit is i need to do and and i think it's\nan important question i think it's\nsomething that people need to think\nabout\nevery freaking day if i'm being honest\nwith you because you only get one life\nthat we're aware of maybe we do get more\nmaybe we don't but nobody has any actual\nphysical proof that there's anything\nafter this so then i'm gonna try to make\nthis the best life that i possibly can\nand i'm going to give you some stories\nabout my life and how all of this\nrelates to me and why hearing the\nquestion what if money was no object\ncompletely changed the way that i saw my\nlife so before we start i want to tell\nyou this when i was 27 years old the\nfirst 27 years of my life by the time i\nhad 27 was all focused on how i can\naccumulate and make as much money as i\npossibly can my life\nbesides hanging out with people and\ndoing other things like my life the core\nof it was how can i make more money how\ncan i make money how can i be successful\nand i know i'm not alone in this i know\nthis is most people's number one goal\nthere was a study i said this a couple\nepisodes ago that 80 percent of\nmillennials number one goal was to\nbecome rich so i'm not the only person\nwho really just was their goal was to\nmake money\nmany people live the exact same way that\ni lived and um what happened with me\nwhen i was 27 years old was super\nimportant for the story that i'm going\nto tell you\nat 27 i was working a high paying sales\njob i was making about 200 000 a year so\nfor a 27 year old pretty damn good money\nand um\nin my the company i was with decided to\njust get rid of their sales department\nright so their sales department for the\ncompany i was with they're just like hey\nwe're just gonna go ahead and get rid of\neverybody so there's only five of us at\nthe time they got rid of everybody and\nwhat happened with me was they gave me\nthe opportunity to stay at the company\nbut take a massive pay cut and switch to\na different position and so i had to sit\ndown with\nyou know the head person of my\ndepartment and i had to sit down with\nthe ceo and um the ceo gave me some\nreally good advice and he basically said\nit seems like you're more passionate\nabout this other thing that you're doing\ni had a podcast that i just started and\ni'll dive into that it seems like you're\nreally passionate about that why don't\nyou pursue that\nand i already knew in my heart that's\nwhat i wanted to pursue but i didn't\nreally have the confidence to go ahead\nand pursue it\nand you know i was making 200 000 a year\ni had to make a big decision i could go\nfind another job like in sales they\nalways say if you're in sales you always\nhave a job i could have easily found\nanother job and made pretty good money\nright but there was something inside of\nme\nthat told me that i should do something\nelse and this was six years ago just so\nyou know and podcasts were not what they\nare now\nthey weren't even close to what they are\nnow nobody really knew what podcasts\nwere when i used to tell people that i\nwas a podcaster um they would i would\nget three responses number one what is a\npodcast that was my number the number\none response number two i've heard of\npodcasts but i don't know how to listen\nto them that was a number two response\nand number three was oh i love podcasts\nand that was very rare right so\nsix years ago podcasts are not what they\nwere\nback then what they are now in my\npodcast the exact same podcast it's not\nnow called the mindset mentor obviously\nback then was called mwf motivation came\nout monday wednesday friday like it\nstill does\nand i was making zero dollars on the\npodcast let me say that again\nzero dollars i decided to not go and get\nanother high paying job and i decided to\npursue my passion\neven though at that point i was making\nzero dollars i had no advertisers on the\npodcast nobody was paying me any money i\nwasn't getting enough downloads for that\nnumber two i had no products in my own\nbusiness that i could sell people i had\nno coaching services i had nothing\nliterally\nzero dollars was how much money i made\noff my podcast in all of my services\nbecause the services actually didn't\neven really exist but\ni didn't know how to make any money\nonline i didn't know i knew that people\ndid and to be honest with you i didn't\nknow if i could make money off my\npodcast i didn't know if i could make\nmoney off of coaching services i didn't\nknow if it was possible but i had this\nfeeling\num deep down inside of me\nthat this is what i should do and i had\nat least a little bit of money in the\nbank account i was like you know what\ni've got a little bit of money i can try\nthis out for six months to a year if it\ndoesn't work i can always go back to\nmaking money again and being a\nsalesperson\nbut there's something in my heart that\ntells me like this is what i'm supposed\nto be doing and i'm going to figure it\nout and i i felt like this was my\ncalling i felt like this is my passion\num\nand it logically didn't make any sense\nbecause logically you look at you say\nmaking zero dollars versus making a\ncouple hundred thousand dollars\nthe average person's gonna go just go\nmake the money right\nthat's what the logical side of it but\nwhen you think about it from like what\nmy heart was telling me what my passion\nwas telling me it was hey\nyou should go and pursue this thing\nbecause it seems like it's the right\nthing like this feels right it feels\nlike something that you'd actually love\nto do so logically it made no sense but\nit just felt right it felt something\nfelt right i don't know what it was but\nit was something that lit up inside of\nme that had never lived inside lit up\ninside of me before and it was this\nfeeling of like yep\nthis is in full alignment with who i'm\nsupposed to be and what i'm supposed to\ndo right\nand i'm bringing this up and i'm telling\nyou the story because now obviously\npeople come out to me like hey i want a\nsuccessful podcast like you and i'm like\nwell you got to do 900 episodes that's\nwhat i've done you've got to go for six\nyears that's what i've done you know\nyou've got\nit you look at it and it's like we have\nyou know 10 employees now and between\neverybody who's who works for the\ncompany about 15 people across the board\nyou know and we've got a multi-million\ndollar coaching business but it came\nfrom literally\nzero\nno followers you know people seem like\noh i want 2.5 or 3 million followers\nwhatever we have at this point i want a\nbig podcast all of these things people\nwant it i understand it but most people\nare not willing to step out into the\nunknown into what seems illogical\nto follow their heart\nand so i want to ask you that question\nyou know is there something inside of\nyou that logically does not make sense\nas far as on spreadsheets how much money\nyou're going to make all of that stuff\nbut it just feels right is there\nthink about that for a second let it set\nin is there something inside of you that\nsays i should go follow this passion\nright because that's what we're going to\ndive into i wanted to give you my story\nto to make you realize it can go from\nzero to\nmillions of followers and millions of\ndollars quite quickly if you're\nfollowing the thing that is actually\nyour passion\nright so when i'm talking about this i\nwant you to think to yourself what is it\nthat i want to do right\nand sometimes following your dream\ndoesn't logically make sense\nit doesn't\nbeing a painter might not quote unquote\nlogically makes sense being a musician\nmight not being a creator might not make\nsense whatever it is it might not make\nsense\nto the average person but for some\nreason there's something inside of you\nthat goes yeah this makes sense\nright when i told everybody i was to not\ngo back and not take a pay cut and not\ndo any of those things and not go back\nto the company or try to find another\njob because i was going to find my\npassion people like you're crazy and i\nwas like i know\nbut watch\nand now they're like oh you were right\nso is there something inside of you that\nfeels right\nright let's dive into that\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject\nif money did not exist there was no\nmoney what would you do with your free\ntime and i asked myself this question\nthis is a question posed by alan watts\none of my\ntop two favorite philosophers in the\nentire world him and ramdas right he\nsays what would you do if money were no\nobject i remember seeing that video and\nthinking what would i do if money were\nno object\nand what i do now i am obsessed with\nbefore i started the podcast i was\nalready obsessed with neurology\npsychology early childhood development\nwhat makes people tick watching people\nin conversation and watching people and\ntrying to to figure out why they are the\nway that they are based off of their\nchildhood based off of their parents i\nwas already obsessed with all of that\nstuff\nand i'm still obsessed with it but\nwhat's cool is i'm obsessed with it and\nnow i can teach it to people and make\nmoney in different ways as a teacher as\na coach as a facilitator as a speaker\nall of these things so\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject if money was not something if you\ndidn't have to worry about paying the\nbills and all of your bills are just\npaid for\nyou could eat your family has taken care\nof you or taking care of all that stuff\nwhat would you do\nwith your free time if you had to do\nsomething besides just sitting on the\ncouch hanging out with your kids on\ninstagram whatever it is what would you\ndo if money were no object right\nthink about it\nwhat is that thing what makes you come\nalive what makes you tick what makes you\nfeel like this is the reason why i'm\nhere what gives you energy just thinking\nabout right what gives you energy by\ngoing and doing\nyou feel better you feel more alive you\nfeel like that's something that just\nfeels good we live in a society where we\nthink too much\nwe think about things and that's why i\nsay logically it made sense for me to go\nback and just get another sales position\nlogically it makes sense that's a\nthinking thing but it didn't feel like\nthat was the right thing for me so what\nis it that feels right for you inside of\nyour body right and i understand that\nsome of you out there that are listening\nyou have children you have families you\nhave mortgages you have to pay i\nunderstand you can't just go you know\nwhat i'm going to quit my job today and\ni'm going to go and become a painter or\nwhatever the hell that makes you come\nalive\nmaybe you can't do that but can you\nstart to think of some sort of a\ntransition plan\nright\nif you have bills to pay i get it but\ncan you go okay over the next two years\nyou know i'm gonna go two years from\ntoday\ni'm gonna leave my job what do i need to\ndo to make that happen all right i\nshould probably start saving money\nprobably started saving money okay i\nshould probably start building an online\nfollowing i should probably start\npainting more probably start making more\nmusic whatever it is that you're that is\nthat lights you up right i should\nprobably start connecting with other\npeople who are in the same industry\nright try to figure out what would be an\ne what would make it easier for you to\ntransition out of what you do now into\nwhat it is that you truly want to do one\nof the problems is that people want\nimmediate gratification and they think\nyou know what if i want to do this thing\nthat is my passion i have to leave my\njob today and i have to start making\nmoney at the thing that i that is my\npassion tomorrow no you need to be smart\nand say if i had to leave two years from\ntoday what would my transition plan look\nlike and start to plan it out\ni can't tell you how many people i've\ntold this to and they've quit their jobs\nand they've built their own businesses\nthey followed their passions because it\ntakes so much pressure off when you say\nokay i've got a year i've got two years\ni've got three years to figure this out\ni've got to connect with the right\npeople i've got to get better at my\nskills i've got to better my knowledge\ni've got to start learning how to make\nmoney online whatever it is that you\nwant to do and when you have that\ntransition time it allows you to pay\nyour bills\nlive your life feed your family\nkeep the mortgage all of that stuff but\nat the same time it allows you to start\nto learn and grow and the light at the\nend of the tunnel starts to become a\nlittle bit brighter and a little bit\nbrighter a little bit brighter and by\nthe end of the two years people like\ni've got this i've got it under control\ni'm already making a little bit of cash\nand this this thing that i'm doing on\nthe side it's providing me the life that\ni want to whatever it is come up with a\ntransition plan if you have a job\nand you've got a family and you've got a\nmortgage you've got bills can you come\nup with some form of a transition plan\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject okay\nsome people say oh i can't do it because\ni have children right\num\nthe thing i want to tell you about your\nchildren is this if you haven't realized\nalready which you probably have your\nchildren are going to follow in your\nfootsteps they're not going to do what\nyou say that they should do they're\ngoing to do what they see you do so you\nmight say hey honey follow your passion\nand follow your dreams and become a\ncreator and be a painter or a musician\nwhatever it is you want to do you can do\nanything that you want to but if they\nsee you going to a job that you hate\njust to pay the bills they're going to\nthink to themselves subconsciously oh\neven though i can be a creator and make\namazing things i'm supposed to hate my\njob i'm supposed to just pay the bills\nso your children will follow in your\nfootsteps if they see you work a job\nthat they hate there's a pretty good\nchance guess what they're gonna do work\na job that they hate just to pay the\nbills so\nwhat do you want them to see you do\nbecause whatever you do they're most\nlikely going to do as well they learn by\nwhat they see not by what they hear\nso wouldn't you rather your children do\nsomething that they love like if i were\nto ask you would you rather your your\nchild be successful or happy what's the\nanswer to that would you rather be\nsuccessful or happy\nright there's a pretty good chance that\nif if that they don't have to choose\neither one a lot of times when they\nstart on a path of going to do something\nthat they're happy with they also become\nsuccessful as well so it's not either or\nbut i guarantee you probably want your\nchildren to be happy right and if you're\nworking a job that you don't love or it\ndoesn't light you up\nwhat if they were to go do the same\nthing what if you were to fast forward\n20 years and see your children stuck in\nthe exact same position that you're\nstuck in what would that feel like\nthink about that\nyou can't tell them to build their\ndreams when you're staying in your\nprofessional prison prison because\nthey're going to see the exact same\nthing right\nso next thing you spend most of your\nwaking hours working\nso this should be something that is\nextremely important to you you spend\nmost of your waking hours doing work\nsome form of work right so is it a\npassion\nis it a purpose for you or is it a waste\nthink about that the thing that you\nshould do is listening to this podcast\nis take a good long look at yourself in\nthe mirror\nand i always say this if you've listened\nmy podcast on if you've heard me say\nthis\nit's okay not to know what your purpose\nis right now on this planet it's okay\nyou don't have to know this very moment\nbut if you don't know what it is it's\nnot okay to not be in constant search\nfor what your purpose is\nlet me say that again it's okay not to\nknow what your purpose in this world is\nit's not okay to not be in constant\nsearch for what that purpose of yours is\nso if you're sitting there and listening\nthis you might know what your purpose is\nyou might have a feeling\nright once again go with the feeling go\nwith the gut your gut always knows your\ngut is your emotional compass your brain\ntries to talk you out of everything\nthat is outside of your comfort zone\nyour gut feeling is your emotional\ncompass that always knows what you\nshould do the problem is your gut only\nspeaks to you in feelings it doesn't\nspeak two in words so you've got to feel\nyour way into this what do i feel is the\nright step for me what is it that lights\nme up what would make me so excited to\ndo this thing\nthat's you've got to ask yourself\nsame way i understand\nit's scary as hell it's so freaking\nscary to leave what it is that you're\ndoing that's paying your bills that is\nsafety in order to basically jump off a\ncliff and think that as you're jumping\neventually a parachute will build itself\nright\ni had a i remember and i told this story\na few weeks ago i remember\nwhen i was terrified when i first left\nthe job the month i left the job i was\nlike i gotta go back to getting another\njob i got i was so used to getting the\nuh the golden wrap pellets as we call\nthem the golden rat pellets is the\npaycheck every two weeks right it's this\ngolden wrap pellet uh and and so\nbasically it's this thing that you're so\nused to getting and when you stop\ngetting it kind of scares the [ __ ] out\nof you right and i remember being\nterrified and i said this a few episodes\nago like i said but i went home and my\nsister gave me a box that was my dad's\nstuff and one of them was a letter that\nwas in there that he wrote to my sister\nabout a year before he passed away and\nat the end of it it said i hope you live\nyour life with courage love and laughter\nand i was so terrified that i needed\nthat this whole thing wouldn't work\ni was in so much fear\nand the opposite of fear is courage and\nin this letter said courage love and\nlaughter and so i literally got it\ntattooed on my arm it says live your\nlife with courage love and laughter it's\nmy dad's handwriting it's tattooed on my\narm because i needed a constant reminder\nwhen i was scared less every single day\nthat what i was doing was the thing that\ni was supposed to be doing it's the\nthing that the reason was put on this\nplanet right and i needed the courage\nevery time i felt the fear and so every\ntime i'd be like should i go back to\nworking a job should i go back to\nworking jobs should i go back to those\nrat pellets i look in my arm and be like\nnope that i'm not gonna do it i'll\nfigure it out if i go broke if i live on\nthe streets whatever it is i'll figure\nit out right\nthe beautiful thing about it though\nit'll work out for you if you get the\nfeeling the gut feeling that is what\nyou're supposed to do it will eventually\nwork out\nso\ni'm going to pose the same question to\nyou that i posed to you at the beginning\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject\nfigure out what it is follow it follow\nyour heart do it is do what it is you\nthink that you should do if you don't\nknow what it is right now it's okay but\nit's not okay to not be in constant\npursuit for what that thing is\ni'm going to give you some strategies on\nactually coming into alignment with what\nyou're truly supposed to be doing in\nthis world if you're lazy if you don't\nhave energy throughout the day to do the\nthings that need to be done the reason\nwhy is because you are out of alignment\nwith what it is that you're truly\nsupposed to be doing in this world\nit's that simple when you are aligned\nwith what it is that you're supposed to\nbe doing with your true purpose in this\nworld you don't have to look for energy\nit's like the universe just throws\nenergy at you so go with me as i explain\nthis to you okay\nthere's a reason why you're on this\nearth i believe that i don't know what\nyour reason is\nbut you might know what it is or you\nmight know that there's a reason you\njust don't know what it is\nif you don't know what your purpose is\nat this point it's okay not a big deal\nbut it's not okay to not be in constant\nsearch for what your purpose is on this\nearth\nyou say it again it's okay not to know\nwhy you're on this earth and what your\npurpose is at this moment but it's not\nokay to not be in constant search for\nwhat that purpose is otherwise you're\ngonna get to the end of your life and\nwish that you would have done something\ndifferent but you don't even know what\nthat something different is with that\nbeing said you have a purpose i have a\npurpose we all have a purpose but your\npurpose might be different than my\npurpose\ncompletely cool no big deal and your\npurpose might be different than every\nother person that's listening to this\npodcast\nno big deal that's good so what we\nshould be doing is searching for it and\nthe reason why is this is if you have a\npurpose\nand you're not living in that purpose\nthink of it this way when you're\nwhen you're doing what it is that you're\nsupposed to be doing in this world and\nyou feel like you're on purpose and you\nfeel like you're doing what it is you're\nsupposed to be doing it's almost\neffortless it's literally as if god or\nthe universe or source or whatever it is\nthat you want to believe in comes\nthrough you and provides all of the\nenergy for you and it's like you know\nwhat i've got so much energy to go and\nrecord podcast episodes because i feel\nlike this is just literally what i'm\nsupposed to be doing when i get done\nrecording three podcast episodes in a\nrow just screaming into the microphone\nlooking at a camera for an hour an hour\nand a half i have more energy after than\ni did before because it's like the\nuniverse or god whatever it is throws\nenergy at me and says yes this is your\npurpose in life i'm going to actually\nprovide the energy for you so you don't\nhave to come up with it now\non the flip side of that this is super\nimportant come with me here if you're\ndoing something that is out of alignment\nwith what is your truth you're truly\nsupposed to be doing if you're working a\ndesk job that you hate\nand it's sucking your soul or you're a\nteacher and you don't want to be a\nteacher anymore you thought you just\nwanted to help children and now you're\nrealizing that's not the way that you\nwanted to go or if you're an accountant\nor if you're in finance or if you're hr\ndirector or if you're an account\nexecutive and you're like i just\nfreaking hate what i do\nit's exhausting isn't it do you want to\nknow why it's exhausting because the\nuniverse will not provide energy for you\nto do something that is not in alignment\nwith your true purpose you picking up\nwhat i'm putting down it will only give\nyou energy more energy than you can\nhandle more energy than you need\nto do the thing that you're supposed to\nbe doing\nthink about that one for a second i want\nyou to realize\nif you come back at the end of the day\nand you're exhausted after working\na day in your life\nthen that's not what you're supposed to\nbe doing now i do want to be very clear\nwith you it's not like oh i never get\ntired right there's good exhaustion\nthere's bad exhaustion good exhaustion\nwould is\ni'm tired at the end of the day but my\nheart is full do you feel that way tired\nbut your heart is full you feel\nfulfilled you're like\noh my god i can't wait to do that again\ntomorrow that is good exhaustion bad\nexhaustion is you come home you're tired\nyou're dragging ass\nyour mind is just like i don't want to\nbe doing this thing again tomorrow\nthat's good exhaustion versus bad\nexhaustion where do you find yourself\nliving at the end of the day if you find\nyourself living in bad exhaustion you're\nnot supposed to be doing that that's not\nyour purpose your purpose here on this\nearth wasn't to be you know an account\nexecutive maybe or to be an hr director\nmaybe or to be a ceo maybe i don't know\nbut what i'm telling you is if you feel\na bad exhaustion that's not\nnot what you're supposed to be doing so\nhow do you find what you look to do how\ndo you find what you love how do you do\nthat how do you get there first off you\ngot to try some new things if you don't\nknow what your passion is first off you\ndo know what your passion is a lot of\nyou probably do you just aren't\naccepting it right like you don't know\nwhat your passion is you're not fully\naccepting what that passion is so if you\ndo know what it is try to put a little\nbit more time into it and see if you\nstart to come alive see if you start to\nget more energy from it that's the\nuniverse coming through you saying hey\nthis is it i'm gonna give you some i'm\ngonna drop some seeds this is what you\nwant man this is what you want if you\ndon't know your passion then you've got\nto try some new things you probably\ndon't know what your passion is because\nyou haven't found it you haven't done it\nyet so if you haven't found it you can't\nwake up tomorrow and do the exact same\nthing you've been doing for the past\nfour or five years six years seven years\nbecause if you just keep doing the same\nthing you're gonna get the same results\nand so if you've never found it based\noff of what you're currently doing\nyou're not going to find it by doing the\nsame thing over and over again so you\ngot to try some new things\nyou got to try some new stuff next thing\nthat will really help you out\ni got this from one of my friends\nmake a happy list\nmake a list of every single thing that\nmakes you happy it could be huge\nit could be small little things it could\nbe\nseeing your children\ncome home from school it could be\ndropping them off at school it could be\na watermelon popsicle it could be\nrecording a podcast it could be whatever\nit is for you just make the biggest list\nof things that make you happy\nthat's it\nand see what you come up with one of my\nfriends\nwas a\nlike number 13 employee at facebook and\nhe was fired from facebook\nbefore they went public like six months\nbefore they went public then they went\npublic and with his shares that he had\nto give up if he would have still had\nhis shares in the company and not been\nfired\nabout six months later when they went\npublic he would have made about 180\nmillion dollars\nhe made zero\nso obviously\nthat sucks and he started to go into a\ndepression and then he realized that he\nwas putting himself into a depression\nand so what he did was he made a happy\nlist all of the things that made him\nhappy and he did as many every morning\nhe'll wake up and he'll look at that\nlist and say how can i bring as many of\nthese things into my day today to make\nme happy he made a happy list and he\ntried to bring as many of those things\nand what he said was i will not let my\ndepression or my happiness be left up to\nchance so he made a plan to make a happy\nlist and to look at that list every\nsingle morning think about that doing\nthings that make you happy is like\nplaying a video game and finding the\npower up button it's like\noh you've got more energy because that's\nwhat you want to be doing that's what\nyou're here to do another way to find\nout what it is that your purpose is what\nis your passionate what is that you want\nto be doing\nis a strategy called ikigai which i love\ni don't know if i've found a better\nstrategy for finding what your true\npurpose is if you want to make money and\nfind a job or a profession or vocation\nwhatever it is that that is whatever it\nis that you're truly supposed to be\ndoing so there's four questions to\nikigai so if you have a pen and paper\nyou should want to jot these down\nquestion number one is what do you love\nto do\nright make a list of all of the things\nthat you love doing\nwrite it down it could be big it could\nbe small it could be you know it could\nmake you money it might not make you\nmoney that's fine\nwhat do you love to do\nthink about that next one what are you\ngood at what are things that you're good\nat\nwrite them all down\nwhat are all the things that you're good\nat next\nwhat can you be paid for\nwrite all the things you could be paid\nfor you know uber\npublic speaking whatever it is sales\nwhatever it is that you've been paid for\nbefore you could make money at in the\nfuture what can be paid for last\nquestion question before is what does\nthe world need right and this is funny\nbecause i never\ndid this before i started doing what i'm\ndoing now but had i done ikigai before\nstarting the podcast before doing all\nthis i probably would have still found\nmyself in the exact same place because\nif you look at like what i love i love\nspeaking i love personal development i\ndidn't make any money off of personal\ndevelopment before i started doing\npodcasting and coaching and all that\nstuff but i just loved it\nthat would have been on the list reading\ngrowing getting better next one what am\ni good at i happen to be good at public\nspeaking when i first started the\npodcast i had about uh i had about 10\nyears of public speaking experience\nbefore then over 10 000 hours of public\nspeaking experience that would have been\non the list i am good at public speaking\nokay cool what can i be paid for i could\nbe paid for\nspeaking i can be paid for podcasting i\ncan be paid to coach people i can be\npaid to run programs build a course\nokay and what does the world need the\nworld needs more people that are helping\npeople remove themselves from their\nanxiety from their stress from their\nworry all of those things things that i\nthink i provide so i would have found my\nikigai\nmost likely had i done this before i\nstarted the podcast as well so i\nrecommend trying that out to see if\nmaybe that helps you shift and move some\nthings into place to find out what your\ntrue purpose is here in life you know\nthink about this like\nwhy is it that that when you do\nsomething that you love it's like time\nflies\nright it's like you don't have to think\nabout oh man like yeah i'm really tired\ntoday it's like you don't have\ntiredness inside of your body it's like\nthe energy is there that's the universe\ncoming through you god coming through\nyou whatever it is that you want to\nbelieve coming through you\nto go this is what it is you're supposed\nto be doing when you're doing something\nyou don't love doing going into a job\nthat you hate hanging out with people\nthat you don't enjoy whatever it might\nbe you're going to find out that there's\ncertain things that pull the energy from\nyou that is one of the things that could\npull the energy from you find out what\nit is that you actually get energy from\nand what drains energy from you when\nsomething drains energy from you that is\nthe universe telling you hey dude this\nain't it\nit's the truth hey this ain't it you've\nbeen working for the government now for\n17 years you've never been excited to\nwalk in these doors this ain't it\nlisten to the universe the universe will\ncome to you and it'll speak to you very\nsoftly sometimes you've got to be cut\npretty silent to hear it's like tickling\nyou with a feather then if you don't\nlisten the universe will get louder\nthey'll smack you with a brick\nand then if you don't listen for even\nlonger it's going to come and hit you\nwith a truck right i just know someone\nwho got fired from a job that they hated\nfor the past 20 years they got fired\nfrom the job that they've hated for the\npast 20 years that is the universe\nhitting them with the truck saying get\nout of this spot this is not what you\nwant to be doing\nsadly they went right back into the same\nindustry\nbecause they are focused on paying their\nbills i guess i don't know but they're\nnot searching for their passion they're\ndoing something that they love doing and\nso that's what'll happen is you'll start\nto get these feelings it's like the\nwhisper the tickling of the feather so\nit's either the feather then when it\ngets worse it turns into a brick when it\ngets worse it turns into a truck the\nfeather is like oh man it's like those\nthoughts in the back of your head of\ni don't really like being here i don't\nmaybe i should do something else maybe i\nshould quit my job become a painter\nmaybe i should you know go and start\nhelping homeless people i don't whatever\nit is for you start thinking these\nthoughts that's kind of like the whisper\nthat's the tickle with the feather then\nwhat happens is the universe will do\nsomething else it'll wake you up a\nlittle bit more you'll start getting\nreally anxious before you go into work\nyou'll start feeling depressed thinking\nabout work\nthat's like the the\nthe the brick then the truck is like\ngetting fired\nhaving a disease something like that\nit's a manifestation of the universe\ngoing this isn't it what you're doing\nisn't working what you're doing isn't\nworking what you're doing isn't working\nwhat do i need to do for you to finally\nlisten to me that's what's happening in\nthis case it's the feather it's the\nbrick it's the truck\nplease make a change before the truck\ncomes because i promise you this the\ntruck's coming it will come at some\npoint in time just make sure that you're\nout of the way when it does and it's the\nreason why\nyou can see two people who are both 50\nyears old\nand one of them looks like they're 60\nand one of them looks like they're 40\nand they can take care of themselves\nexactly the same\nsame food same diet same amount of\nworking out all that stuff they could\ntake care of themselves exactly the same\nthe difference is\nthe amount of stress that they're going\nthrough mentally based off of what\nthey're doing with their life so someone\ncould be the two people could be the\nexact same age born the exact same day\nbut one looks 20 years older than the\nother one simply because they're doing\nso they're mentally beating the crap out\nof themself every single second that\nthey're at their job and subconsciously\nevery single second when they're outside\ntheir job being like i hate this job i\nhate this job even when they're on the\nweekends saturday thinking oh my gosh\ni'm so glad that it's saturday but i\ndon't want to i don't want monday to\ncome i don't want monday to come sunday\nthey wake up and like i'm so glad it's\nsunday but i don't want monday to come i\ndon't want monday to come and then\nmonday comes and they're like\nnow i gotta go do this again and they're\nmentally getting beat up by themselves\nbecause it's not what it is that they're\ntruly supposed to be doing and guys this\ndoesn't just have to do with your\nprofession either this can happen with\nyour relationships too you can wake up\nnext to somebody and it's a relationship\nthat's not the right relationship the\nuniverse is trying to tell you it's not\nthe right relationship and it's giving\nyou signs and feelings and signs and\nfeelings and signs and feelings but\nyou're just not listening to it the\nfeather will come\nthe brick will come later and then\neventually the truck's going to come so\nyou've got to always think about is what\ni'm doing now in alignment with what it\nis i'm supposed to be doing because if\nit's not you're going to be really lazy\nyou're not going to want to do it so\npeople are always like how do i have\nmore energy can i drink more coffee can\ni have yerba mate is there something\nthat some some energy hacks some\nneurotropics i can take no the change is\nthat you've got to change what it is\nthat you're doing because you're not in\nalignment with what it is that your true\npurpose is and if once again you don't\nknow what your true purpose is that's\nfine find it find it find it find it or\nelse the truck will be coming at some\npoint in time i don't want you getting\nhit by the truck of this isn't what\nyou're supposed to be doing listen to me\nalready it's the reason why\ndoing something that you hate is so\nexhausting and doing something that you\nlove brings you so much energy that's it\nit's that simple because when you're\ndoing something that you love something\nthat makes you happy something that is\nyour\nfull embodiment full alignment with who\nyou truly are the universe will provide\nthat energy for you it is effortless\ntime flies when you're doing something\nthat you hate\n[Music]\nthe universe ain't gonna provide energy\nfor you it's gonna say hey\nyou're not doing what you're supposed to\nbe doing you got this i'll let you take\nit from here and then you're exhausted\nand then you're tired and then you're\nanxious and you hate what it is that you\ndo and then you start to put your body\nthrough unnecessary stress based on the\nfact that you're too afraid to make\nchanges or to get out of your comfort\nzone you've got to put yourself outside\nof your comfort zone and find out what\nit is that you truly want that\nis how you stop being lazy i'm going to\ntry to answer the toughest question in\nthe entire world the question that every\nsingle person since the beginning of\ntime has asked himself why am i here\nwhat's the purpose of me being here\nwhat's the purpose of my life and before\ni dive into it let me state my ignorance\nokay i don't know all of the answers i\ndon't claim to know all of the answers i\ndefinitely don't think that i know\nmost answers i'm 35 years old don't\nclaim to know everything i don't think\nthat i'm a guru i never want to be a\nguru any of those things\ni'm still working on myself i think i'll\nbe working on myself to the day i die\nand i've been working on growing myself\nfor 15 years now but with that i have\ncoached thousands and thousands of\npeople over the time that i've been\nworking on myself\nand working with other people\nand i feel like for for most of the\nboxes that people want to check off in\ntheir life as far as you know happiness\nsuccess money whatever it is that you\nwant to say i feel like i've checked off\nmost of the boxes that people want to\ncheck off in their time and i spent a\ngood portion of my life\nbeing happy in creating some form of\nhappiness but more than anything else\nactually just going straight for money\nlike money was my main purpose in life\nit's the thing i was going after more\nthan anything else\nand you know i was able to to realize\nthe way that we all know right that\nmoney doesn't give you happiness like\nmoney does not make you happy i realized\nwhat everyone before me has ever said\nright and i knew that money didn't make\nme happy but i was like you know what\nlet me make some money first and then\ndecide if i want to be happy from there\nor not it didn't change anything in my\nlife everything was exactly the same\nthe only thing it really allowed me to\ndo was to be able to do things that i\nwasn't able to do before and to be able\nto buy things that i wasn't able to buy\nbefore but\ndoing the things that i did didn't make\nme happy and buying the things that i\nbought didn't make me happy as well so\nif i felt like i checked off many of the\nboxes that i'm supposed to check off in\nmy life but i still wasn't happy as i\ncould be or i didn't feel as fulfilled\nas i could be then why the hell are we\nhere right what is the purpose of this\nlife and my personal opinion once again\nyou can take this for what it's worth\nyou could take it and fully believe it\nyou can take with a grain of salt either\none is completely fine it's completely\nup to you what you decide to do with\nthis information i think the purpose of\nthis life is to grow spiritually and i\ndon't mean religiously because i think a\nlot of religion actually restricts most\ngrowth and most\nmost spiritual growth and most personal\ngrowth and i'm not mocking religion any\nsort of way\nfor some people religion is the path to\ntheir enlightenment or to happiness or\nto fulfillment for me it just wasn't and\nso when i say uh you know\nit's it's the path the work of just\nspirituality for those of you guys that\nmight be atheists or might be agnostic\nanother way of saying it for you just so\neverybody can kind of join in on this\npath that we're talking about here is i\nthink the purpose of us being here if\nyou don't want to say grow spiritually\nwould be just to learn we're here to\nlearn\nthat's it that's all we're here to do\nlife is a classroom\nand\nthat's all that i think that it is we're\nhere to learn we're here to grow we're\nhere to get better and hopefully by the\ntime that we leave this place we end up\ndoing a pretty good job of it i do\nbelieve that there's something after\nlife there's times where i've bounced\nbefore like you know is there something\nafter life is there is there not\nsomething after life i've bounced all\naround and i personally believe that\nthere is um\ni personally think that we might you\nknow have a lot of lives after this one\nyou know there could be reincarnation\ndidn't think i'd ever say that before uh\nit could be on this planet it could be\non another planet it could be in another\ndimension it could be somewhere else\nthat we don't know about i don't know i\ndon't ever i'll never act like i know\nall i know\nis that i get this feeling that i'm here\nto learn i get this feeling that the\npurpose of me being here\nis to grow to learn and to get better\nthis life that i have is just basically\na really big classroom and this\nclassroom\nis not here when i consciously decide to\nstep into the classroom and learn it's\nnot here when i sit down you know i\nconsciously decide you know what now i'm\ngonna sit down and i'm reading a book\nthat's not when i step into the\nclassroom or when i sit down and i say\nyou know what i'm in a journal that's\nnot when i step into the classroom when\ni step into the classroom is when\nanything happens in my life not when i\njust decide to journal not when i just\ndecide to meditate now when i just\ndecide to read or to\nwrite or to do something my personal\nbelief is that the classroom is every\nsingle second of my life do you feel\nthat way is there something inside of\nyou that kind of feels the same\ni'm curious\ni'd love to hear from you do you feel\nlike it's the same do you think that\nit's different once again i don't i\ndon't have many of the answers i just\nfeel like for me this is what feels\nright and once again this isn't\nsomething that's just like hey when i\nconsciously decide to sit down and do\nsomething that's when i enter the\nclassroom it is every single second of\nmy day is an opportunity to learn and to\ngrow and to get better that could be\nspiritually that could be mentally that\ncould be physically that could be in my\npersonal growth that could be my\nspiritual growth in my relationships\nwith other people every single second\nlife or god or the universe is throwing\npeople in circumstances and things at me\nto allow me to either stay awake and\nwake myself up out of this autopilot\nthat i can go into or to wake up and\ngrow from it the thing about in the way\nthat i think about it is i don't think\nthat there's a finish line that i'll\never cross for like a lot of people they\nthink oh well one day\ni'll eventually get to the place that i\nwant to be one day i'll eventually\nyou know\ni'll eventually become enlightened one\nday i'll eventually learn all the things\nthat i learned to need to learn to know\none day i will get to the point where i\nhave all of the knowledge in the world\nor one day i'll finally not be stressed\nout or not have anxiety or whatever it\nis i personally don't think that there's\never a finish line that i'll cross i\ndon't know if that's the truth or not i\njust have the feeling\nfor me that it is the truth and for some\npeople that can be stressful because\nthey're like oh my god that means i'm\ngoing to feel this way forever oh my god\nthat means that i'm never going to cross\nthe finish line because our western\nsociety we're raised to think like you\nhave to do and produce and achieve that\ngoal and so when we think growing or we\nthink we're here to learn or we think\nwe're here in school we're here to learn\nspiritually we think that there's\nsupposed to be like some award that we\nget at the end of it or some like test\nthat says we got a an a or you know some\ndiploma that says hey you you pass the\nspirituality of life or whatever it is\nand for some that can be really\nstressful to go oh my god i don't know\nif there's a finish line this is this is\nliterally what i'm going to be doing\nforever that's kind of stressful but for\nme it's super freeing because then i\nknow\nthat's all i'm here to do there is\nnothing else for me to do\nexcept\nfor me to be inside of a classroom to\nlearn to grow and to get better now i\nunderstand there's some people that are\nlistening to me right now and you're\nlike hold on that's not the only thing\nrob\nbecause i'm a parent\ni have to take care of my kids\ni'm a spouse i can't just not pay my\nbills my wife will want to divorce me\nwhat happens to my family if i just go\non this spiritual learning journey that\nyou're talking about what happens if\nthat happens and what i'm saying too is\nif you're thinking that i think what's\nhappening is you're missing the point\nyour growth doesn't come in spite of\nyour family your growth doesn't come in\nspite of the people around you or you\nknow you don't have to leave your family\nand go to india and go on some spiritual\njourney in order to grow\nspiritually mentally physically whatever\nit is your growth doesn't come in spite\nof everyone that's around you your\ngrowth comes through\neveryone that's around you\nthey\nare your actual path\nthey are your path\nso you know i remember i i think of you\nknow a story that that ram das says when\nyou know ramdas is a spiritual teacher\nand you know he was a professor of\npsychology at harvard and then he you\nknow started doing some psychedelics he\nwent to india he went on a spiritual\njourney you know he was wearing a white\nrobe he thought that he was enlightened\nand he had just you know he was on in\nindia for a year or two years whatever\nit was and he came back and he was on\nyou know nothing can bother me life is\nbeautiful i'm this enlightened being and\nthen his dad who is a lawyer picks him\nup at the airport and within like 15\nminutes his dad goes so when are you\ngonna get a job and immediately\nset him off again it was a trigger and\nhe realized in that trigger that he\nwasn't free he wasn't free of his past\nhe wasn't free of all of the things\nmentally that he needed to overcome he\nstill had work to do that is the perfect\nexample of the growth coming through\nthem right how many of you listening\nyour mom or your dad or your brother or\nyour sister can say one thing\nand it triggers you they can say one\nthing and it drives you nuts they say\none thing and it's like\noh my god i was having such a good day\nbefore that happened your growth\nis on the other side of that it's not\nthat they trigger you it's that they\nsaid something that brought up something\nin you that was already there nobody\ngives you nobody makes you mad what\nhappens is they do something that brings\nup the madness inside of you or the\nanger that's inside of you your journey\nis through them\nright your mom saying the stuff that\ndrives you nuts\nyour children having a mental breakdown\ninside of chick-fil-a right like your\nyour spiritual journey is through that\nmoment how you react there your spouse\ndoing and saying the things that drive\nyou crazy you're like oh my god how many\nfreaking times do i have to tell him to\nstop putting his underwear on top of the\nkitchen\nsink whatever i don't know hopefully\nyour husband isn't putting his underwear\non top of the kitchen sink whatever he's\ndoing he's doing something and your\nspiritual journey is not in spite of\nthat your growth in this world is not in\nspite of that your growth is through\nthat all of it all of it is here for you\nto grow every single second is here for\nyou to grow and i personally see all of\nthis as a game life presents you with\nthings with people with opportunities\nwith circumstances to show you where\nyou're still hung up a trigger is a\nteacher\nit teaches you where you still need to\ndo work do i still get triggered\nabsolutely\nbut then i'm like oh\nyep\nstill hung up there\nstill got some work to do rob it's all\nlike a little game and it becomes fun in\nmy opinion because you start to notice\nthis game it's like i'm constantly\nplaying a game all day long and the\nbetter that you become at this game the\nbetter that you work through the better\nthat your life becomes so the better\nthat you become at this game the better\nthat every single person's life becomes\naround you every single person that\nyou're close to everyone in your family\nevery single person's life becomes\nbetter when you work on yourself every\nsingle moment to become better\ndoes that make sense to you because the\nmore you work on yourself the better you\nbecome and the better you become the\nbetter the lives around you become not\njust your family but every single person\nthe person that's handing you the coffee\nin the drive-thru that person's life\nbecomes better by you being better in\nshowing up there right the energy that\nyou bring to that person the way you\ninteract with them it's gonna be that\nway till the day we die in my opinion\nyou know once again take it for what\nit's worth i think it will be that way\nuntil the day we die every single person\nyou come in contact with and maybe we we\nwe go on this spiritual journey and we\ndie and we go somewhere maybe we die and\nwe get another life maybe we die and\nnothing happens i don't know\ni'm not going to sit up here and just\ntell you that i know what happens like a\nlot of people will i don't know what the\nhell happens but from my point of view\nwhen you live your life\nknowing that this is a classroom\nthat we're going to be triggered those\ntriggers are teachers that we're going\nto get hung up that we're going to get\nagitated we're going to get pissed off\nwe're going to get sad we're going to\nmess things up we're going to act in\nways that we look at\nand look back on and wish that we would\nhave done different we're going to mess\nthings up all of those are just\nopportunities to show us where we need\nto get better next time not to\njudge ourselves and think about how\nterrible that action was and to judge\nourselves and to put emotion into it and\nto get pissed off no none of those\nthings it's the opportunity to go yep\ni see what i did there i did mess up you\nknow what next time i'm going to do it\nbetter it's a teacher it's a lesson\nevery moment is a teacher every single\nmoment is a lesson and to ignore those\nlessons\nis like failing a test\nand then not studying before you take\nthe test again right imagine that you\ntake a test and you don't do well in the\ntest and the teacher says hey\ni'll give you one more chance to take\nthe test come back next week\nwould you study\nof course you would hopefully you would\nbut to have a trigger happen to you a\nlesson a teacher happened to you and for\nyou to do nothing before it happens\nagain\nis like failing at a test doing nothing\nin between the time of the next test and\nyou take the next test and fail again\nit's all just classroom it's all just\nlessons it's all just teachers and once\nagain this is not just when you sit down\nthis is every single second of your day\nare you taking a step back\nand seeing what's going on in your head\nseeing how you're reacting seeing what's\ngoing on because it's all in front of\nyou all everything you need to work on\nin your life is literally it's right\nhere\nat every single moment\nto improve to get better to improve to\nget better you are here to learn what\nare you here to learn what are you here\nto grow from\nthink about that write it down\nwhat am i here to learn what are some of\nthe triggers that set me off that i know\ni need to work on what are some of the\nthings that i don't like about my\nreactions that i get angry too quickly\nthat i get emotional that i get\nsad too often what is it that what are\nthe emotions what are the triggers what\nis it that my mom does what is it that\nmy dad does what is it that my my spouse\ndoes that my children do\nwhat is it that they do that trigger me\nbecause once again it's not that they're\nbringing that thing to you it's that\nthey're bringing that thing out of you\nso if somebody something happens and you\nget really angry that anger was inside\nof you that person didn't create the\nanger that anger was inside of you\nokay so what do i need why did that\ntrigger me and what do i need to do to\nrelease that anger so that next time\nthat happens again i don't react in the\nsame way failed the test last time gonna\nmake sure i'm gonna pass the test this\nnext time\nright where are you still hung up where\nare the triggers that are in front of\nyou it's so important to think of this\nway and to realize\nwe're gonna be here for life baby like\nthere is no getting out of this thing\nthere isn't you know like there's\nliterally if you guys have been\nfollowing me long enough i have a tattoo\non my wrist you might be able to see for\nthose of you guys that are looking\nonline\nyou know there's a tattoo on my wrist\nand it's a roman numeral for ten\nthousand right i've only got two tattoos\nthis is one of them it's a roman numeral\nfor ten thousand it's an x with the line\nabove it\nand because i personally believe in the\nten thousand hour rule which is\ni love the idea of mastering something\nin order to master something it takes\nten thousand hours of deliberate\npractice not just like practicing but\ndeliberate practice pushing yourself to\nbe better pushing yourself push yourself\npush yourself for ten thousand hours the\nreason why i got this on my wrist is\nbecause i believe that personal mastery\nis not just a ten thousand hour thing\npersonal mastery is the rest of your\nlife thing and once again like i said\nearlier that can be stressful for some\npeople to think oh my god i'll never get\nout of this race i'll never get out of\nthis classroom\nor\nit could be really freeing knowing\ni just gotta wake up and try to get\nbetter each day i just gotta wake up and\ntry to be nicer each day i got to wake\nup and be less angry each day i got to\nwake up and treat people better each day\ni got to wake up and do one good deed\nfor people every single day\nso\nwhat are you here to learn\nwhere are you still hung up\nand where do you have the opportunities\nto grow because that's all that we're\nhere to do\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well a lot\nof people like to go through life and\nnot make the decision to step up to not\nmake the decision to step up your life\nand to take control of it is still a\ndecision\nyou realize that right\n[Music]"
