    "transcript": "it is the most powerful thing in the\nworld and rarely do i ever talk about\nthis\nbut i should talk about this more and\nreally i almost never hear anybody\ntalking about this\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nchange your identity and this is\nactually the first episode of my first\never three-part series so i'm gonna do\nthree episodes on how to take action and\nthe very first one is going to be today\nwhere i talk about how to change your\nidentity so when i talk about this\nyou have to realize when i talk about\nyour identity what i mean by that is the\nstory that's going on in your head at\nall points in time about yourself about\nyour presence about your past about your\nfamily about the world around you and\neveryone around you as well so when i\nsay your identity it's literally\nin my mind the most important part\nof you\nand who you are\nthe problem is most people have an\nidentity that doesn't line up with the\nfuture that they want to create\ni promise you this if you have an\nidentity that doesn't line up with the\nfuture that you want to create you will\nnever create that future the only way to\ncreate the future that you want is to\nfirst change your identity so you have a\nstory an identity that's going on in the\nback of your head\nat all points in time\nand it's just a story none of it is\nactually true it changes the you know\nwhat you do\neverything that you don't do it's\neverything that you think about yourself\neverything that you think about\neverybody else that's around you the\nimportance that you place on your\nhistory and your past and everything\nthat's happened and the importance of\nyour current circums circumstances that\nyou're currently stuck in and it will\ndictate the future that you're going to\nhave once again it is the most powerful\nthing in the world for each person\nbecause it will shift the way that you\nwork in this world and rarely do i ever\ntalk about this\nbut i should talk about this more and\nreally i almost never hear anybody\ntalking about this i don't think people\nunderstand the importance of changing\nyour identity when i work with somebody\nor when someone comes to me with an\nissue or a problem or some of my past\ncoaching clients that i've had before\ni listen to them\nbut when i'm listening to them i also\ntry to identify\nthe story that they're telling\nthemselves behind that because at any\npoint in time someone's always telling\nthemselves some sort of story\nsome sort of story of this is how i am\nthis is why i will get what i want this\nis why i won't get what i want so i'm\nlistening to them but i'm also trying to\nlisten to what's going on behind the\nscenes and if somebody's usually talking\nlike if you're in a conversation with a\nreally good friend and it's a long\nconversation and they're venting to you\nyou can listen to them but also when\nthey're on a long tangent usually their\nsubconscious their identity their story\nwill be very blatant if you're listening\nfor it and you can hear\nmaybe a victim mindset you can hear\ni'm not going to get it because of this\nor i'm not as good as she is or i'm not\nas smart as he is you can hear it behind\nwhat they're actually saying but once\nagain it's all a story beautiful thing\nabout that is when we become aware of it\nwe can change that story when we change\nthat story we change our identity we\nchange our identity we change our action\nwe change our actions we change the\nresults that we get in our life so why\nis it so important because your life\nand the results that you have in your\nlife will always\nalign with the identity that you have\nfor yourself your life will not change\nif your identity does not change let me\ngive you a few examples\nof what i see very often and these will\nprobably hit home with some of you or\nyou know somebody who's like this i\nguarantee so i'm gonna give you a few\ndifferent examples that i see often\nsomebody who's overweight right often a\nlot of people who are overweight they're\nnot overweight because of their genes\nthey're not over overweight because of\nanything else other than the identity\nthat they have for themselves let me\ngive you an example what i mean\ntheir story might be well\ni'm just a fat kid i have a really good\nfriend who struggles with losing weight\nit goes up and it goes down it goes up\nand it goes goes down because he still\nsubconsciously sees himself as a fat kid\nand he's become aware of it and as he's\nbecome wherever he started to shed that\nthat identity that has himself\nor it could be my whole family is\noverweight so\nit's in my genes so\ni'm just always going to be overweight\nit's just in my genes or\nlosing weight is hard for me have you\never heard somebody say that before have\nyou ever said it before or i'm just not\nathletic i didn't play any sports when i\nwas younger\nhave you ever heard that one have you\never said that one or\nyou know if i had her body then it would\nbe easier for me to look thinner you\nknow if i was taller then of course i\nwould look better\nhave you ever heard that have you ever\nsaid it so you have to think about this\noh yeah i'm shorter so you know weight\njust gets on me a lot easier than it\ndoes for people who have different body\ntypes right whatever it might be and i'm\nnot saying that some people don't have\ndifferent body types i'm not saying that\nsome people don't have different genes\nwhat i'm saying to you is it's just a\nstory and if you latch on to that story\nyou'll never actually change your life\nso you've got to be very aware of the\nstory that you're telling yourself\nwhatever it might be it's all everything\ni just gave you it's all the same excuse\nbut it's all just different flavors of\nthe same excuse the excuse is\ni will never look the way that i want to\nbecause of x and we're taking the blame\nand putting on something external\nversus going you know what maybe i don't\nhave the same body as her but i'm still\ngoing to get the shape that i want to\nmaybe i don't have the same genes as him\nbut i'm still going to get into the\nshape that i want to maybe you know i\ndon't have uh i wasn't raised athletic\nand i never played any sports but it\ndoesn't mean anything the trainer that\ncomes over to our house and works out my\ngirlfriend and i she was never athletic\nshe told us that she never played any\nsports but if you look at her now she\nlooks really damn athletic because she\njust decided that she was going to get\ninto fitness so you've got to think\nabout it that way you know if we take\nthe example of the overweight family\nmy whole family is overweight it's just\nin my genes it's just the way that i am\nit makes somebody think it is in my dna\nit is absolutely unchangeable if it's\nunchangeable why in the hell would you\never eat healthy because we all know\nthat most of the time like are there\ngood healthy things you can eat for sure\nabsolutely\nbut hey pizza tastes way better than\nsalad i don't care pizza taste in my\nopinion pizza tastes better than\nanything you have to think about that if\nyou have the choice of should i eat\nhealthy or should i eat something that\ntastes really good well if it's in my\ndna and it doesn't matter then why the\nhell would i eat healthy so then what do\npeople do because their story their\nidentity that's going on in their head\nis i have this in my genes it's in my\ndna they automatically make the choice\naka the actions\ngo towards well i'm just going to make a\nchoice that's going to be easier it's\ngoing to taste better because it doesn't\nmatter what my choice is i'll always be\noverweight same exact thing\nif you're if you're if it's in your\njeans\nwhy would you ever go and work out\nworking out some people like working out\ni'm not a fan of it i force myself to do\nit but it's not like i'm like oh my god\ni can't wait to work out today it's like\nno i'm going to work out because it's\ngood for me and it's good for my body\nthat's the only reason why i do it right\nor because i want to look better that's\nit but i'm not like oh my god i can't\nwait out to go wait to go torture myself\ntoday if your story is my whole family's\noverweight it's in my dna\nthen why would you ever force yourself\nto work out\nno way\nscrew that\nsit on the couch and eat a pizza\nyou know hang out drink a beer do\nsomething else so if it's in your story\nin your identity why would you ever take\nthe actions for a better body if you\nthink that you're completely\nunchangeable\nthe identity changes your actions your\nactions change your results your results\ngo back into your identity and you'll\nsay oh yeah well see look at me my\nbody's overweight that's just the way\nthat i am your identity your thoughts\nyour feelings and that identity will\nalways dictate your actions or lack of\nactions which will always get you\nresults which are either the results\nthat you want or the results that you\ndon't want it's the identity of yourself\nbleeding into your actions always go\ninto your actions your actions go always\ninto results and here's a key point your\nresults will always line up with your\nidentity unless you go with what i'm\nabout to tell you in just a few minutes\nyour results will always line up with\nyour identity\nthe way it's gonna work when they line\nup with the identity they reinforce it\nso let me give an example if i'm\noverweight and i think my whole family's\noverweight there's no chance that i'll\nbe overweight well then i'm gonna take\nactions like not working out like not\neating as healthy as i could and those\nare gonna give me results and those\nresults are going to line back up with\nmy identity of i'm still overweight look\nat me i'm still gaining weight because\ni'm not obviously i'm not taking the\nactions that i need to but i'm still\nsaying to myself i'm still overweight\nsee it must be because it's in my genes\nthat is then reinforcing my identity\nwhich is making my identity stronger\nwhich is reinforcing it at every moment\nthe beautiful thing about your identity\nit's not concrete but the more that you\nget results results results that line up\nwith that identity the more it\nreinforces it and makes it stronger and\nyou think i will always be this way and\nthis is just the way that i am you know\ni i don't have the body that i want\nbecause my genes aren't correct because\nit's in my dna\nyou know i wasn't dealt the right hand\nmaybe next time around i'll get\nget into a family with better dna\nwhatever it is right and your identity\nbecomes fortified and too strong to\nbreak unless you're really willing to\nwork to break that identity but it's\njust a story\nit's literally just a narrative that\nyou're telling yourself in your head\nand none of it is true we make all of it\nup let me give you another example\nif my identity if i think to myself\nbecause of past things that might have\nhappened to me in my past and failing\ntests and not doing great in school or\nmaking it hard to graduate if i tell\nmyself am i in the back of my head is\ni'm not smart or i'm not as smart as\neverybody else or i'm not good at math a\nlot of people say that i'm like well not\nreally you just you could get better at\nmath if you really wanted to you know if\ni'm not smart\nthink about this for a second let's say\nthat when you were younger you went and\nyou took a test\nand\nyou take a test and you go and you're\nwriting it all out you're making it\nyou're excited about you think you did\nreally well you studied really hard for\nthis test when you're\nyou know eight nine ten years old you\nstudy really hard you did really well\nyou thought you did really well and then\nwhen you get the paper back\nthe teacher has all there's all red\nmarks all over it and you look at it and\nthen you see your friend's paper next to\nyou who you know\ndoesn't seem to be as smart as you and\nactually they seem to be kind of dumb\nlet's just say that they're the kind of\nlike a dumber kid and you look at their\npaper there's nowhere near as many red\nmarks well then you're going oh my god\ni'm dumber than my friend that i thought\nwas dumb\ni must be really dumb imagine how that\nidentity placed onto somebody\ncan change the actions that they're\ngoing to take if you're dumb why would\nyou ever study for a test because you're\nautomatically going to fail if you're\ndumb why would you show up for school\nbecause you're not gonna do very well if\nyou're dumb if you're not as smart as\neverybody else why would you ever put in\nthe extra effort and study longer or put\nmore research into something because you\nalready know the results the results are\nyou're dumb\nso that one event can change the way\nthat someone perceives themself\nand that would can change their identity\nnow let me give you the exact same\nexample but let's change it around a\nlittle bit let's say that when you're\nleaving class the teacher pulls you\naside and says hey wait for a second\nwait till everybody leaves i want to\ntalk to you and then everybody leaves\nand the teacher pulls you aside\nand says hey\nyou know i gotta talk to you i think\nthat you're the smartest kid in the\nclass and the reason why i marked up\nyour paper so much is because i want to\nchallenge you to get better because i\nthink that you're better than what you\ndid i want to challenge you because i\nthink that you're the smartest person in\nthis class and i want you to do even\nbetter you did really well on this test\nbut the reason why i graded you so hard\nis because i know you can do better i\nknow that you're smart i know that you\ncan you can be the smartest kid in this\nclass how do you think that would change\na child's perception leaving the class\nas if the teacher didn't talk to him\nit's the exact same situation the only\ndifference is the child leaves the\nclassroom thinking i'm dumb in the first\nsituation and i'm smart in the next\nsituation so if that child now thinks\nthat they're smart that's their identity\nthe story that they're telling\nthemselves how do you think that's going\nto change their actions later on in\ntheir life maybe they're going to study\nharder\nmaybe they're going to show up earlier\nmaybe they're going to ask the teacher\nmore questions maybe they're going to\npay more attention maybe they're going\nto put more time into research simply\nbecause their identity is different i'm\ndumb versus i'm smart the actions that\ncome from i'm dumb are going to be\ndifferent than the actions that come\nfrom i'm smart and if the actions are\ndifferent the results will be different\nand the results will go back into the\nidentity and reinforce it whatever it\nhappens to be but once again it's all\nall of it just a story and that's the\nbeautiful thing about it there's a story\nof a of a guy who was in high school\nlike 20 years ago never did good in\nschool\nnever did good on any tests none of that\nhe skipped school a lot didn't hang out\nwith the best people\nand his mom wanted him to take the sats\nwhich is you know just the a test here\nto get into colleges and his mom was\nlike hey go take the sats like i'm dumb\nthere's no reason for me to take the sat\nand she's like please just try to see if\nyou can do it to get into her college so\nhe goes and takes the sat and the s.a.t\nis out of 1600 and he comes back and he\ngets a 14.80 and his mom's like holy\ncrap you just got a 1480. and she's like\ndid you cheat he's like no i didn't\ncheat she's like are you sure you didn't\ncheat he goes yes i'm positive i didn't\ncheat\nand she goes oh my gosh well you might\nactually be a lot smarter than you\nthought you were and so it clicks in his\nhead of oh my god i'm smart what the\nhell have i been doing for all of these\nyears so he starts changing his actions\nhis identity has shifted from dumb kid\nto smart kid\nhis actions changed because of that he\nstarts hanging out with people who go to\nschool and actually pay more attention\nsome smarter kids he starts stops\nhanging out the kids that aren't going\nto school and partying too much he\nstarts showing up earlier instead of\nskipping classes\nhe decides that he wants to do to put\nmore effort into all of his studies and\neverything that he does he ends up\ngetting into an ivy league school and\nhere in america\nand with that ends up doing really well\nin ivy school because his identity\nchange means his actions change\nand then ends up becoming a ceo of a\ncompany super successful and then 12\nyears later he gets a letter in the mail\nfrom the sat panel\nand they actually messed up on his sats\nhe didn't get a 1480.\nhe got a 740\nand they accidentally\ndoubled his number so instead of doing\nreally well on the test\nhe did terrible on the test\nbut what happened\njust the thought of that test coming\nthrough made him think i am smart that i\nam smart changed his identity changed\nhis narrative changed the story he was\ntelling himself naturally made him\nchange his actions his actions changed\nhis results and his results reinforced\nthe identity of i am smart i am smart\nactually i am when i do show up when i\ndo study when i do put more time into it\ni do really well his identity shifted\nsimply from a test score that came back\nincorrectly a lot of people have a money\nstory we all know somebody who has a\nmoney we all know somebody who says i'm\npoor all the time they make jokes about\nhow they're always poor if they always\nmake jokes about that guess what that's\ntheir identity they're gonna take\nactions of a poor person not gonna work\nas hard not gonna try to get promotions\nmaybe they're not gonna save their money\nif their identity is i am poor they will\nalways be poor that's just the way it's\ngoing to be so if we want to change our\nresults in life which is why you're\nlistening this which is why we're here\nwe want to get better results in our\nlife we must change our actions that we\ntake in order to change our actions\nwe're going to need to change our\nidentity of our self and our identity\ncan shift at any moment\nit's the story that we're telling\nourselves we've just got to become aware\nof the story and when the story pops up\nwe've got to be there to change it your\nidentity is just your personality that\nyou place on top of yourself your\npersonality\nis just personality the word personality\ncomes from the root word persona which\nis a greek word which is the mask that\nactors would wear when they would go on\nstage that's what personality is persona\nis just a mask that you wear of who you\nthink that you are i'm smart i'm dumb\ni'm overweight i'm fit whatever it is\nthat you're telling yourself so what's\nthe story that you're telling yourself\ndo you know and if it doesn't line up\nwith the future that you want\nyou must change it otherwise you're\nalways going to get the results that\nline up with your identity you got to\nchange the way you talk to yourself\nyou've got to notice the negative\nthoughts when they come in you have to\nreplace those negative thoughts with the\nthoughts that you actually want so\ninstead of you know seeing a girl when\nyou're scrolling through instagram and\nseeing a body and saying well that must\nbe nice i wish that i had her jeans you\nlook at her and say good for her i am\ngoing to have a body like hers see the\ndifference in the way the story the\nidentity shifts instead of oh i wish i\nhad her jeans it's i'm going to have her\nbody i'm going to work really hard as\nwell i'm working really hard to have a\nbody like hers i'm working on my fitness\ni'm working on my health to have a body\nthat looks like hers\ni'm willing to take the actions needed\nto have a body like hers instead of like\noh i wish i had those jeans boom poo poo\non this person because they look better\nthan i do no it's good for her good for\nhim i'm going to work hard and have a\nbody like that as well that's how you\nshift the identity through the mind\nyou got to change your mind about\nyourself your story your narrative in\norder to change your actions and change\nyour results but the problem is people\ndon't talk about the identity very much\nnow there is another way to shift the\nidentity\nthat's through the mind the other way to\nshift the identity is through the body\nwhere you don't have to believe in\nyourself in order to take any actions\nthat's the beautiful thing about actions\nyou don't have to believe in yourself i\ndon't have to believe that i'm going to\nget fit to go work out but if i force\nmyself to work out five times a week my\nbody's going to change doesn't matter\nwhat my mind thinks so you can either\nshift through the body or you can shift\nthrough the mind or you can shift\nthrough both and that works even better\nbecause that's twice as much you get\nboth of them you get the body and mind\nin there so the other way to shift the\nidentity is to force yourself to take\nactions\nthat you know you need to take in order\nto get the life that you want so if you\nlet me give you an example if you have a\nstory of oh i'm poor i'm poor i'm poor\nand poor\nbut\nyou want to make a hundred thousand\ndollars this year and you look at your\nnumbers and you say okay i need to make\na hundred cold calls a day and i'll make\na hundred thousand dollars this year you\ncan still tell yourself you're poor but\nif you show up to a hundred cold calls\nevery single day you're eventually going\nto make a lot more money because you're\njust simply will powering and forcing\nyourself to take action if you think to\nyourself uh it's just you know it's just\nhow my family is they're all just\noverweight but you force yourself to\nmeal plan to look at your macros to make\nsure that you're eating the right stuff\nto get rid of all the crappy food to\ngive up alcohol to give up sweets give\nup anything that's not healthy for you\nand you force yourself to only eat\nthings that are good for you and you\nforce yourself to go to the gym five\ntimes a week you will get the body that\nyou want and when you start to get the\nbody that you want your identity will\nstart to shift if you're still working\nthrough the mind that's the important\npart you can't let the mind just the\nstory just stay the same you've got to\nstart to look at your body shift and go\nyou know what i am start maybe it's not\nmy genes maybe it's not my cheese oh i\nam getting the body want i am getting\nthe body i want and when you use the\nmind and the body together it makes it\nso much stronger we have to\nconsciously be changing our stories at\nall points in time because we all know\nwe all know people who have lost 100\npounds\nand then gained it all back within the\nnext two or three years why they forced\nthemself to do it through the body but\nthey didn't also shift the mind so we\nhave to constantly be forcing the body\nconstantly be forcing the body but also\nshifting the mind at the same point we\nall know people who have won the lottery\nwe might not know somebody personally\nbut we all see that people win the\nlottery 70 percent of people who win the\nlottery end up losing all of that money\nspending all that money within a few\nyears why they got the actions they got\nthis this the results that they wanted\nthey were just placed in their bank\naccount but their identity never shifted\ntheir actions never shifted to do the\nthings that a wealthy person would do so\nin order to change your identity fully\nyou got to shift it through the mind by\nshifting the story that you're telling\nyourself and you've got to shift it\nthrough the body by forcing yourself\nhaving the willpower to just show up and\ntake the actions that are needed in\norder to get the results we want to in\nlife and if we force the mind\nand the body to change the story in the\nactual body itself to move and change\nthe results will change in those results\nwe'll start to change our identity and\nthat identity will get stronger and\nstronger and stronger and stronger so if\nyou want to change your life\nyou've got to shift your identity the\nquestion that i have for you is what is\nthe story that you're telling yourself\nwhat is your identity is it that oh my\nfamily is overweight oh i'm always going\nto be poor oh i've always been stupid oh\ni've always been pretty i'm not good\nenough i'm not smart enough i'm not\npretty enough i'm not whatever it is\nwhat is your identity that you're\ntelling yourself ask yourself is that\nidentity going to line up with the\nfuture that you want and if not what is\nthe identity that i need to have\nin order to get the future that i want\nbecause it's all just a story what's the\nstory that you need to shift to to tell\nyourself to get the future that you want\nyou shift your identity through your\nmind you shift your identity through\nyour body if you do this it will make it\nso much easier to take action towards\nthe results that you want that's why\nthis is episode number one on taking\naction out of the three episodes we have\ncoming out this week\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well a lot\nof people like to go through life and\nnot make the decision to step up to not\nmake the decision to step up your life\nand to take control of it is still a\ndecision\nyou realize that right"
