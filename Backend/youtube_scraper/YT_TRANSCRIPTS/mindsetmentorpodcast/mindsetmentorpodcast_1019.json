    "transcript": "but the moment your life changes and\nwhen you decide to take the blame from\nexternal and blame everything internally\nand go wow\nthis reality that i have is not the\nreality that i want\nthis is my fault\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\ncompletely reset your mindset in your\nbrain now i know there's people out\nthere going is that even possible the\nanswer to that is yes as long as you\nshould follow the strategy i'm going to\nteach i'm going to give you two\ndifferent options two different\nstrategies that you can use depending on\nwhere your life currently is and\ndepending on what it is that you're\ntrying to create in your life so you\nknow when people think about who they\nare a lot of times what holds people\nback from changing their life and\nultimately creating the life that they\nwant to\nis that they look at their lives and say\nwell you know this is who i am this is\nwhat i've done this is who i will always\nbe and in the book mindset by carol\ndwight she says that's considered a\nfixed mindset which is this is the way\nit is this way it's always been this is\nhow i am this is in my genes this is in\nmy dna my family's always been this way\nthere's nothing that i can do to change\nit that's a fixed mindset on the other\nside of that is a growth mindset knowing\nthat no matter what it is that i want to\ndo i can do it it's just going to take\nchanges in me and that's the type of\nminds that you have to have in order to\nchange your life and so when you say can\ni completely reset myself absolutely\nwho you are is not set in stone your\npersonality is not concrete your\npersonality is just something that you\ndecide it's like a mask you decide to\nput on every single day and just\ncontinue to keep wearing every single\nday nobody says you can't switch mass to\nsomething different you know one of my\nfavorite phrases is alan white says\nyou're under no obligation to be who you\nwere five minutes ago\nin the phrase personality comes from the\ngreek word root word persona and persona\nback in the greek days were just masks\nthat people would wear when they would\ngo on stage that's what a mask was it\nwas the persona so your personality can\nchange at any time you just have to make\nthe conscious decision to change your\npersonality because you want to change\nyour results so just realize that where\nyou are who you are that's not concrete\nit never has been and ever will be the\nonly time it becomes concrete is when\nyou develop a fixed mindset of this is\nhow i will always be because you've made\nthe decision to always be that way\nthere's two options as i said that we're\ngoing to go over today number one is if\nyou feel like you need small changes in\nyour life maybe your life is pretty good\nmaybe you've done some work on yourself\nbut you're just not where you want to be\nyet\nand on the other side of that option\nnumber two is a complete overhaul of\nyour life so let's dive into both those\noptions so option number one is small\nchanges you know your life might be good\nyou might make decent money you might\nhave a pretty good house and maybe\nyou're happyish\nmost of the time\nand you got a pretty good family and\nmaybe take a vacation every single year\nand it's not like life sucks it's not\nterrible it's not this place that's hell\nthat you're stuck in\nbut deep down in your heart you feel\nlike there is more for you like you're\nnot living up to your potential like\nthere's another level or maybe another\nfive levels of life\nthat you're really meant to live through\nbut you're still stuck at the level that\nyou're currently at so that's this is\ngoing to be optional which is just small\nchanges in your life right in this case\nwhat you're going to do\ni hope you take this\nand actually do this because i know a\nlot of people listening are like that's\na great idea but then you'll never\nactually do it the people that will have\nmassive change in their lives are the\npeople that actually listen to this and\nthen make changes and listen to what i\nsay\nthe thing that you need to do is you\nneed to go to the store and buy a small\npocket-sized notebook not use your phone\nnot use your ipad nothing you're gonna\nhave a small pocket size notebook that\ncan go into your back pocket and you're\ngonna carry that with you and a pen\neverywhere you go for the next 30 days\nokay and here's what we're going to do\nany time that something happens to you\nor that you do something that you're\nlike oh man\nlike my highest version of myself the\none that's five levels above where i\ncurrently am wouldn't have done that\nand you're gonna write that down here's\nthe reason why is because writing it\ndown is bringing the awareness to the\nphysical form versus just making a\nmental note because how often\ni'll give you a perfect example how\noften do you go into another room and\nthen you get into that room and you're\nlike why the hell did i just come into\nthis room i don't know about you i do it\nall of the time so when you go oh i'm\ngoing to make a mental note of how i\nwant to make changes if you go from\nliterally the kitchen to the to your\nbedroom and forget in those 10-15\nseconds what it is that you were\nsupposed to be getting what makes you\nthink that you could possibly remember\nall of the things that are programmed\ninside of you that you want to change\nand so what we're doing is we're taking\nthe things that you want to change about\nyourself\nto then create the reality that you want\nand you're actually going to write it\ndown in physical form what you're doing\nis you're actually training your brain\nto flag the things that you don't want\nto have anymore you're training your\nbrain to flag the places in your life\nwhere you want to make adjustments and\nwhat's happening is it's called a\npattern interrupt is actually what it is\nyou're in the middle of doing something\nand instead of continuing going oh\nmental note you're gonna actually\ninterrupt that pattern and you're gonna\nwrite down with a pen and paper what it\nis that you're actually trying to work\nthrough and what you're trying to change\noh this just happened and instead of\ndoing this i would have preferred to do\nthis\nso you write it down this is what\nhappened and instead of doing this i\nwould have preferred to do this i will\nstart doing this this is what i'm going\nto do from now on and then what you do\nis now you have a little notebook that\nsays all of the things that you did and\nall the changes that you want to make so\nnow what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to try to put this into your\nsubconscious and your subconscious is\nmost active when you're asleep and so\nwhat you do is you take that little\nnotebook out every single night and what\nyou do is you read through the things\nthat happen today that you want to make\nadjustments on\nand how you're going to make adjustments\non them you're programming your\nsubconscious to actually start to make\nthese changes while you're asleep it's\nlittle incremental changes like this\nwhich is where you actually start to\nmake\n3 four five ten years down the road\nthese little incremental changes end up\nbeing massive change in your life maybe\nyou know\nyou wake up late and you're like oh crap\ni didn't want to wake up this late i hit\nthe snooze button three times okay get\nyour pen and paper write down hit the\nsnooze button three times would have\npreferred to not hit the snooze button\nat all tomorrow i'll wake up at 5 a.m\nlike my alarm clock says it could be\nyou know i said something in the middle\nof an argument to my significant other\nand\nmy you know i know when my emotions are\nhigh my logic is low so\ni would have preferred to say this or to\nkeep my mouth shut or to let it blow\nover whatever it is that you would have\npreferred action so instead of letting\nmy emotions take over me and lashing out\nat her i would have preferred to do this\nright i'm bringing awareness\nand then\nactually writing down the change that i\nwant to make bringing awareness right\nnow that change that i want to make you\nknow i i\nstayed on the couch for an extra 30\nminutes today and didn't get my workout\nin because i ran out of time before i\nhad to you know leave to go do something\nso what i would have preferred to do\nis actually work out for those 30\nminutes instead of laying on the couch\nthe entire time next time i find myself\non the couch with free time i am going\nto get up and i'm going to make changes\ni'm going to get off got get off my ass\nand get into the gym right so you're\nwriting down all of the little things i\nhad a friend who i taught this to\nand she hated how she judged people too\nmuch which i think a lot of us can\nrelate to that it's just i don't know if\nit's a comparison thing that we all have\nfrom our tribal days where we look at\npeople and we judge them quicker and we\ntry to place ourselves above them maybe\nit's a lack of self-worth where we try\nto make ourselves feel like we're above\npeople she hated how she would judge\npeople because that's not her true self\nthat was just her conditioned self she\nactually told me this past week that she\nnoticed somebody\nand she noticed that she immediately\njudged her and it was a judgment popped\ninto her head and she goes oh damn that\ngirl is big and not even big in like\nlike she was fat or anything she was\njust a really tall\nlarge girl like just you know took up\nspace i guess you could say in the\nnicest way and she noticed that with the\nre-patterning of her brain her brain she\nactually thought this never said out\nloud but it went like this oh my gosh\nthat girl is really big i love her\nbecause what happened when she trained\nherself whenever she started to judge\nsomebody because she didn't want to\njudge people she wants to love people\nthat she's going to say i love her i\nlove him i love that person i love this\nabout them and took the judgment and\nturned it into love and took the\njudgement turned into love she called me\nand she's like holy crap this is crazy\nthis just happened where i saw somebody\nand i said oh my god that's a really big\ngirl and i felt judgment behind it my\nbrain automatically\nwent to i love her\nand she could actually start to feel the\nlove for that person so she literally\ntook\nsomething that she didn't like about\nherself six months ago and started a\nre-patterning process to start to get\nrid of it if you fast forward another\nsix months a year two years from now\nwhat's amazing about this story is i\nguarantee you it's just gonna be i love\nher there won't be the judgment because\nshe's starting to re-pattern the parts\nthat she doesn't like about herself for\nthe parts that she wishes she was more\nloving in now she can go ahead and do\nthis and start to love people more and\nstop judging people as much see how this\nworks it's a re-patterning of your brain\nto change yourself into the person that\nyou want to want to be but the key here\nis that you've got to bring awareness to\nthe physical form by writing it out\nand then what you've got to do is you've\ngot to write out what it is that you\nwant to do and the next time this\nsituation arises because i guarantee\nit's going to rise in some pattern some\nsort of way so that's option number one\nis if you want to make small changes\noption number two is complete overhaul\nof your life\ncomplete overhaul of your life and it is\nto do everything the opposite of the way\nthat you normally would do it and i got\nthis from my friend garen jones if\nyou've listened to the podcast with him\nyou know he was uh he had been in a\nfrench jail for smuggling heroin for a\nfew years and he was homeless for two\nyears and he just decided that he was\njust gonna start doing everything like\nhe woke up one day and was like he\nrealized that his actions and over his\nentire life got him to where he was and\nwhere he was was not where he wanted to\nbe so he said you know what instead of\nme just continuing to do the same things\nover because einstein says to do the\nsame thing over and over again expected\nfor results insanity what i've been\ndoing has gotten me to a place where i\ndon't want to be anymore so i'm just\ngoing to do the opposite\nof everything that i normally do and if\ni do that eventually my life is going to\nbe different so he started doing the\nopposite of what he normally would do so\nif he looked at an elevator or an\nescalator and he wanted to go up another\nfloor instead of telling taking the\nelevator or the escalator he would\nsearch for the stairs and take the\nstairs and set why because that's\ndifferent than what he would normally do\nif he usually would stay up late\nthen he decided what he's gonna do he's\ngonna start going to bed early okay if\nhe decided you know if he he noticed\nthat normally he would he was eating\nfast food well then you know make a\nhealthy meal at your house take some\nextra time it's gonna take time to do it\nbut it's something different instead of\njust i'm going to get this because it's\nconvenient and it's quick it's i'm going\nto take time and attention to make\nsomething that's healthy instead of\nlaying on the couch and just scrolling\nthrough instagram and just seeing\ni don't know what's going to come up i\nbet we could all guess what's going to\ncome up we know what our feeds are going\nto look like today tomorrow the next day\ninstead of just doing that how about\ninstead of laying down the couch we saw\nthat we want to go to the gym what's the\nopposite of everything that you normally\ndo so what you do is you take guess what\na pen and paper and you write down all\nof the things that you do that you don't\nwant to do anymore and then you ask\nyourself what is the opposite of that\nand you start doing the opposite of it\nand then when you notice yourself\nfalling back into the pattern of doing\nthe thing you don't want to do you've\nalready got the pen and paper that's in\nfront of you that says hey these are the\nthings that you want to start doing\ninstead so if i notice myself\noh i'm on the couch\nscrolling through instagram\ni then become aware wake myself up out\nof it and i go okay i'm on the couch i\ndon't want to be doing this what was it\nthat i wrote down and told myself that i\nwould do oh that's right that i would go\nand do\n40 push-ups whatever it is go to the gym\ngo for a run go for a swim and that's\nhow you start to re-pattern yourself to\nthe point where garen got so serious\nabout this he started learning how to\nwrite with a different hand his other\nhand because he heard that depending on\nwhat hand you write with it changes your\nbrain so he's like i'm going to change\nevery single aspect about who i am and\njust\nsee what happens just use yourself as a\nguinea pig and see if it ends up being\nthe life that you want eight years ago\nhe was homeless now he lives in a\nmulti-million dollar house and he's\nmarried he's got a kid on the way he\nwent from depressed and sad to happy has\nan amazing life all of this stuff simply\nbecause he just decided\nto do the opposite of what he had been\ndoing it's very simple\nthe life that you currently have right\nnow\nis just\nthe culmination of all of the actions\nthat you've taken in the past so if you\nlook at your life and you're not a\nhundred percent on it well then what do\nyou need to do to change it what about\nyour life what what past decisions if\nyou would have made them differently\nwould have made your current reality\ndifferent as well it's simple\nyou know your life is just simply the\nend result of all of your past actions\nthat's it the problem is a lot of times\nwe don't want to take acceptance of that\nwe want to be able to blame externally\noh it's my parents fought for the way\nthat they raised me it's the\ngovernment's fault because they didn't\ngive me what i wanted it's you know\nmy uh the president's fault because he\nyou know he looks like that or does this\nwhatever the hell you want to blame we\ncould blame everything external but the\nmoment your life changes and when you\ndecide to take the blame from external\nand blame everything internally and go\nwow\nthis reality that i have is not the\nreality that i want\nthis is my fault\nand it's my fault from decisions that i\nmade in the past so if i want to make my\nfuture reality different i need to make\ndifferent decisions right now so those\nare the two different options that you\nhave either number one if you want to\nmake small changes kind of like you're\njust optimizing your life and making it\nbetter\nget that pen and paper bring it with you\neverywhere and start to write down\neverything that's happening write down\nwhatever it is that you don't like and\nthen what you wish that it would be\nif you need a complete overhaul of your\nlife\nwell\njust start doing the opposite of what\nyou would do and then every moment\nyou go you know what i normally would\ntake this route to work i'm going to\ntake a different route i normally would\nyou know lay on the couch i'm going to\ndo 50 push-ups and you start challenging\nyourself to just do something different\nwhat we're talking about is a complete\nre-patterning of who you are your brain\nwill change when you change you have to\ndo something different your brain will\nnot change if you just keep doing the\nsame every single day but if you start\ndoing something different your brain\nwill automatically change with you as\nwell so\nif you want to completely change your\nlife and reset your mindset those are\nthe tips that i have for you today\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well in\nlosing\nmy freedom i discovered my freedom\nso maybe the universe needed to\nremove\nall of the things i gave power to so\nthat i can remember where the power\nbelongs\ninside of myself"
