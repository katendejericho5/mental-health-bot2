    "transcript": "success is my only [ __ ] option\nfailure is not i either get it or i die\ntrying there is no other option\nthat's the mindset\ntoday\nwe're gonna be talking about my number\none key to success so\nyou know i'm gonna tell you i feel like\ni've built a life that i'm proud of i\nfeel like i've checked off most of the\nboxes that i wanted to check off in my\nlife and that people tend to want to\ncheck off so i consider myself decently\nqualified to tell you what my number one\nkey to success is but i'm going to tell\nyou this my number one key to success is\nnot sexy\nat all and it's probably quite\nunexpected i don't really hear a lot of\npeople talking about this so\num and in reality it might kind of\nsurprise you a little bit my number one\nkey to success here it is\nis patience\nthat's my number one key to success and\ni'm gonna explain patience how to be\nmore patient but i'm also gonna give you\nsome more steps after the patients and\nleading up to the patients that will\nhelp you succeed as well so there's a\nfew keys there's a few action items and\nthere's a few mindset shifts that need\nto be made in order to take your\npatients\nactualize it and create the success that\nyou want to in your life so when we talk\nabout success\nyou have to look at the world that we\nlive in first right first off before we\neven do that let's talk about what does\nsuccess mean to you right what success\nmeans to you\nmight be completely different actually\nis probably different than every other\nperson's listening to this podcast\nhundreds of thousands of different\nreasons why\nyou want to be successful in what\nsuccess means to you to someone out\nthere success might mean 10 million\ndollars net worth so some of you out\nthere might mean a house on the beach\nsome of you guys out there might need a\nhappy family some of you guys out there\nmight be no more anxiety some of you\nguys out there might be buying your mom\na house\nwhatever success means to you\nyou have to realize\nthat we live in a world\nof immediate gratification if i want\nfood\ni can get food delivered in my house in\nthe next 30 minutes if i want groceries\ni can get groceries delivered to my\nhouse in the next couple hours if i want\nto go somewhere i can have someone come\npick me up and drive me that i've never\nmet before if i want to know something i\ncan google and i can immediately get\nknowledge we live in a world where\neverything is immediate\nexcept for\nsuccess\nsuccess is not immediate success takes\ntime and a lot of times we think that\nit's very quick because what happens is\npeople just kind of pop up sometimes and\nyou're like man\nelon musk for instance he's so\nsuccessful he just like came out of\nnowhere one day and that's the way that\nwe see it oh this actor is massively\nsuccessful we look at this musician oh\nmy gosh she's so massively successful\nshe just came out of nowhere how did she\nbecome so successful so fast what we\ndon't see is we don't see the 10\nto 15 years of hard work and knowledge\nand skill building that they have to put\nin in order to get to where they want to\ngo very rarely does somebody decide they\nwant to do something and then a month\nlater they're this massive success it's\nlike you don't just\nplant a seed in the ground and expect\nthat tomorrow it's going to be a massive\ntree you know it's going to take time\nso what if you were to treat your life\ntreat your goals and treat your success\nthe same way that you would if you were\njust waiting for a tree to grow we just\nplanted trees in my house these little\ntiny little teeny tiny trees are about a\nfoot tall right\nand they're supposed to grow to 80 feet\nbut we got them because the fact that\nthey just will make a border around my\nhouse because for my house there's just\nthere's nothing out there's just nature\nthat goes off my property right so we\nwanted a little bit of privacy trees so\ni planted these little one-foot trees\nand they've been there for about four\nmonths now and they've barely grown\nbut i'm not trying to rush them to grow\nbecause i understand that it's not gonna\ngo from one foot to eighty feet tall in\ni don't know a couple days i'm not gonna\nbe like oh it's been four months what\nthe hell is going on with these trees i\nthink these trees are broken i know that\nit's going to take time so when we see\nsomeone that's a massive success it\nlooks like it's a meteoric rise but in\nreality it was a really slow burn for\nthem to get to where they are for me\ni don't know if it's just because i'm\nmore of a laid-back person i don't know\nif it's because i was race fishing and\ni'm used to being patient i'm okay with\njust\nwaiting around and doing what needs to\nbe done until eventually i get to the\npoint where i want to go and as i get\nolder\nyou know i'm 35 now i started really\nworking on myself and building my first\nbusiness when i was 19 years old so it's\nbeen 16 years and it's cool because i\ncan see\nall of the little micro decisions that i\nmade\nwhen i was 19 20 21 22 23 years old\nall these little tiny decisions\nthat got me to where i am now but had i\nnot made those decisions\nand not stayed on the path that i was on\ni wouldn't be where i am\nand i think it's that way for everybody\nand so one of the biggest things that\nyou can learn along your path of success\nis just to simply be patient you can\nhave the world you just can't have it\nall at once you've got to work towards\nit you know when you see people\nthat\nare patient\nand just continue to go on the path and\ngo on the path and go on the path put\ntheir head down to work and put their\nhead down work put their head down work\neventually\nyou just have this feeling that they're\ngoing to get there because if you can be\npatient if you can decide what you want\nand be patient you're going to get what\nyou want that's the first thing that i\nwant to bring in before you have to be\npatient you have to decide what it is\nthat you want like when you look at your\nlife\nten years from now what do you want\nwhat is the life that you actually want\nbecause if i'm going to go and i'm going\nto drive somewhere\nbefore i get in my car\ni've got to know where i want to go\nright otherwise i'm just going to be\ndriving around\nup and down random streets so many\npeople out there live their lives just\nlike they're just driving a car around\nand just taking random turns and random\nturn here and random turn here they\ndon't know where they're going and too\nmany people live their lives as if\nthey're just wandering\nthey don't have any idea of what it is\nthat they actually want so before you\ndecide\nanything else before you can be patient\nyou can't just be patient just think\nthat life is going to come to you you\nhave to decide what it is that you want\nso what do you want okay once you've\ndecided what you want\nwhat you have to do is you have to get\nrid of all other options this is\nsomething i remember when i started a\nbusiness with my best friend dean years\nago\nwe started an amazon business and one of\nour friends jj asked a question he said\nhey\nwhy are you guys going into business\nwith each other like you could do this\non your own all this stuff and dean's\nphrase was\nrob's the most resilient person that i\nknow he's basically like a cockroach\nlike when he decides he's gonna do it\nhe's just gonna do it there are no other\noptions and that's the way i've always\nlived my life is that first off i decide\nwhat i want second off i either get it\nor i die trying there is no other option\nand if you've listened to my episode a\ncouple months ago on manifestation i\ntalk about this when i decide what it is\nthat i want the opposite of what i want\ndoesn't exist in my reality so i can't\neven think to myself oh well what if\nthis doesn't work because the only thing\nthat exists in my head is this is the\nonly thing so you've got to learn to\nburn the ships you know there's a\nthere's that story of\nwhether it's true or not\nyou know there's debate on whether it's\ntrue or not but whether or not it's true\ndoesn't even matter what matters is the\nstory behind it of the spanish conqueror\nwas coming across and you could tell\nthat while he was coming across hundreds\nof years ago he could notice that his\nhis men weren't really in it\nthey're kind of uh thinking about\nturning back and so when they landed\nthey were in wooden boats when they\nlanded\nin the americas he said all right\neverybody we're going to burn the ships\nhe's like they're all like wait what do\nyou mean what are we going to burn the\nships he goes we're going to burn the\nships\nbecause you're not turning back either\nwe succeed in this conquest or we all\ndie here trying that's the way that\nyou've got to be with the life that you\nwant you've got to decide what it is\nthat you want and all other options are\noff the table there is no other plan b\nit's like will smith says there is no\nplan b because it distracts from plan a\nthere should only be a plan a\nyou have to make up your mind you have\nto say this is what i want there is no\nother option it's like the eminem quote\nright success is my only mother an\noption failure is not that's the way\nthat it's got to be in your head there\nis nothing else you've got to go for it\nthis is it nothing else either i get it\nor i die trying\nthat's the mindset boom okay\nnow that i know what i want\nnow that i've made that mind set up of i\nam going to get it no matter what this\nis where most people usually stop they\ndon't go much further because then they\ngo i'm all in i'm all in i'm excited\nabout this i'm gonna go\nand then they they go all in and they\nput all of their hard work into\nbuilding a brand new business and then\nthree months later\nthat business is barely doing anything\nand they're like man maybe this isn't\nfor me maybe i made a mistake maybe i\nyou know i'm putting in three months of\nhard work and nothing's happened we've\nbarely made any money in fact we've lost\nmoney over the past three months maybe\ni'm just on the wrong path ah i know\nwhat it is i'll switch to another path\ni'll figure out that other path that i\nshould go down or to be successful\nbecause clearly this is the wrong one\nand then what they do is they go on that\nother path and they're all in on that\nother path yes we're gonna do it we're\ngonna burn the ships\nand then\nit doesn't work out for three to six\nmonths like damn it this must have not\nbeen the right path either no it's not\nthat you are on the right path\nis this that you have to stop stopping\nas long as you just don't stop you'll\neventually get to where you want to be i\nremember years ago i was watching a an\ninterview with jared leto jared leto is\na\nsuper successful\nactor and he's also a super successful\nmusician so he is in two different\nfields\nthat\nmany millions of people want to be\nsuccessful millions of people want to be\nsome of the best actors in the world\nmillions of people want to be one of the\nbiggest bands in the world he's both\nwell\nhe was uh in an interview and the lady\nwas asking him said what do you what do\nyou what do you think is your success\nwhy is it that you're so successful what\nhe said was i realized that most people\njust don't start\nand as long as i don't as long as i just\nstart\ni'm already light years ahead of other\npeople\nso i just have to start and then all of\nthe people who start\nmost of them give up so as long as i\njust don't give up i'm eventually going\nto beat almost everybody and that\nis the key to success is deciding what\nyou want doing it and then going there\nis no other option this is what i'm\ngoing to do so after three months when\nyou don't see success because you\nprobably won't\nyou keep going after six months when you\ndon't see success because you probably\nwon't you keep going after nine months\nafter 12 months after a year after three\nyears after four years it'll start to\nbuild and build and build and build and\nbuild it's like the trees that i planted\nin my backyard before they can grow up\nthey've got to grow their roots down you\nknow you've got to grow\nyour knowledge and your skills and\neverything that's the foundation that\nyou're going to build everything on\nbefore it can grow up it's got to grow\ndown you've got to put your roots down\nyou've got to say this is it\ni don't care what happens\neither i succeed at this or the rest of\nmy life i'm going to go for this\nso you just don't give up next step\njust get moving\njust keep moving it doesn't matter how\nfast you go\nas long as you're going in the right\ndirection so if i were to get in my car\nright now\ni could drive to dallas and take about\ntwo and a half to three hours to get\nthere but\nif i were to just go on my feet\nand start heading in the direction of\ndallas\ni could walk to dallas and the beautiful\nthing about that\nis that as long as i was heading in the\nright direction\ni'm eventually going to get there it's\ngoing to take longer than it would if i\ntook a car i completely understand that\nbut the thing that i do understand\nis that as long as i'm heading in the\nright direction\nit doesn't matter the speed that i'm\ngoing at i'll eventually get there and\nthat is where the patience comes in i'm\ngonna get there one day one day i'll be\na millionaire one day i'll have the life\ni want one day i'll be able to travel\nthe world with my family one day i'll be\nable to\nxyz whatever it is that you want one day\ni will have it i just have to make sure\nthat every single morning i'm heading in\nthe right direction if you're heading in\nthe wrong direction don't get me wrong\nyou're not going to get what you want\nthat's for sure you can't just have hard\nwork\npeople always well hard work i work\nreally hard i said well you can work\nreally hard at digging a hole in my\nbackyard but when you get done i'm just\ngoing to have a hole in my backyard\nthere ain't going to be anything else\naround that it's just a hole so it's\nlike you could work really hard at\nsomething that you don't want to do\nbut working really hard something that\nyou don't want to do is not going to\ngive you the life that you want you've\ngot to figure out what it is that you\nwant you've got to work towards it make\nsure that you're heading on the right\npath and realize that the direction that\nyou're heading in life is more important\nthan the speed that you're going at\nbecause\nyou're eventually going to get there\nand so that's why you've got to stop\nfocusing on the end result stop focusing\non that end result is it good to know\nwhere you're going absolutely you've got\nto know where you're going but don't\nmake that the reason why you're doing it\nlike if you're starting a business\nsimply because you want to be rich\nyou've already lost the game you have to\nenjoy the journey\nyou have to enjoy the growth process of\ngetting better and learning and failing\nand getting better and learning and\ngrowing and failing and getting better\nbecause that\nis what's eventually going to get you\nthere if you're just focused on that end\nresult i promise you this you're\nprobably not going to get there or\nyou're going to really hate your life up\nuntil you finally get there the goal is\nto go what direction am i going in like\ni'm in austin right now if i were to\nwant to go to dallas i'd have to head\nnorth so as long as i wake up every\nsingle morning and before i start\nwalking i look at my my compass and i go\nokay i'm heading north all right i'm\njust gonna start walking this way i wake\nup the next morning i say okay what's my\ndirection compass says i'm heading north\nokay i'm just gonna keep walking this\nway as long as i'm going in the right\ndirection north eventually i don't know\nhow long it takes to walk from austin to\ndallas it's probably a few days\neventually i'm going to end up there so\nrealize this\nbe patient with what is it you want\ndecide what it is that you want burn all\nof the ships give yourself no other\noption and then realize that the\ndirection that you're heading into life\nis more important than the speed that\nyou're heading at\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well we've been\nsold a lie you've been sold a lie i've\nbeen sold a lot we've all been sold a\nlot no wonder why people are so stressed\nis because they're stuck in a reality\nthat they do not want"
