    "transcript": "every action is a vote for the person\nthat you want to become\nso\nhow are you voting\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nget better every single day and i'm not\ngoing to talk about how to become\nexponentially better or how to wake up\ntomorrow and become\nbe be 10 times richer than you are or\nwake up tomorrow and you're having the\nperfect body or the perfect relationship\nor any of that stuff i'm going to talk\nabout how to simply just focus on being\none percent better every single day\nthat's it and we're going to talk about\nthe journey of life that you're on and\nwhat you're focusing on and what you're\ndoing we're going to talk about the\njourney of self-improvement because i\ndon't see\nself-improvement as something that you\njust do like a\ndiet where there's an end point to it i\nsee it as a lifestyle you know if you\nwant to completely change your body you\ndon't just go on a diet you change it in\nme the new healthier version of you is\nyour new healthy lifestyle i see the\njourney of self-improvement the exact\nsame way\ni've lived my life since my very first\nmentor in 2006 under the impression of\nsomething called kaizen kaizen is a\njapanese phrase for constant\nnever-ending improvement\nit's literally the 12-month mastermind\nthat myself and my business partner run\nfor business owners it's literally\ncalled the kaizen mastermind because\nit's constant never-ending improvement\nconstant never-ending improvement in\nmyself and my relationships in my\nbusiness in my mindset in my health in\nevery single aspect of what i do i'm\nconstantly trying to grow and improve so\nit's a constant never-ending improvement\nit's a journey of life it's a lifestyle\nit's not something that you just decide\nthat you want to do and the whole idea\nis i don't expect to wake up tomorrow\nand be like this\nsuper\nripped\n10 times richer version of rob i know\nthat for me it's just about how did i\nshow up for myself every single day how\ndo i show up today do i feel like before\nmy head hits the pillow that i'm one\npercent better than i was when i woke up\ntoday and i'm curious with you what do\nyou think when you went to bed last\nnight\ndo you feel like you were one percent\nbetter or do you feel like you were the\nexact same person that woke up\nbecause if you're the exact same person\nwhen you woke up\nnothing's gonna change in your life but\nif you're one percent better and you do\nthat every single day\nfor the next year that's 365 better\nthat's 3.6 times better than you are\nright now simply by focusing on little\nteeny tiny things to get better every\nsingle day and the reason why this is\nimportant is because your current\ncircumstance in life the way that you\nlook the way that you feel the\nrelationships that you're in\nthe\namount of money in your bank account the\nsuccess or lack of success in business\nall of those are just lagging results of\npast habits\ntraits behaviors and actions that's it\nresults don't come right away that's the\ninteresting thing about them so where\nyou are\nright now is based off of decisions that\nyou made in your past six months ago\nthree months ago a year ago two years\nago you don't get results right away\nmost of the time it usually takes time\nthey lag\nso if you look at your life right now if\nyou don't like where you are\ni'm gonna give you a harsh reality you\nchose to be there if you don't like\nwhere you are right now in your life you\nchose to be there whether you realize it\nor not there was a bunch of decisions\nthat you made to allow yourself to be in\nthe position that you're in that's the\nbeautiful thing about life is that no\nmatter where your life is you can always\nblame yourself for it if you look at\nyour life and this is one of the very\nfirst things my mentor actually and my\nvery first mentor i don't remember\nanything else he told me in two years i\nremember was all really good but i\nremember one conversation where he\nliterally said that you have to become\nthe ceo of your life if you wake up one\nday\nand you're 85 years old and you don't\nlike where your life is at\nit's your fault\nbut if you wake up at 85 years old and\nyou love where your life is at it's also\nyour fault wherever you are in life you\nchose to be there and that can be\nsomething that's very empowering but for\nsome people it can also be a really big\nsmack in the face because your past\ndecisions\ngot you to where you currently are\ncan't blame anybody else you gotta stop\nblaming other people don't take any\nblame and put on anything external oh\nwell my mom was this way my dad was this\nway my dad was an alcoholic\ni was raised in this part of town my\nsister always used to tell me i was ugly\nyou know i i was raised with a bunch of\npoor people so i never would do what it\nlooked like to be rich and it's all of\ntheir fault it's the government's fault\nit's the president's fault it's the\npresident before him's fault it's the\npresident before the president before\nthe president's fault you can blame\neverybody if you want to but it's not\ngoing to change your circumstances\nyou've got to learn to take all of your\nblame and put it on yourself which for\nsome people can feel stressful but it\ncan also be extremely empowering because\nyou realize\nthat you're the only one\nthat's going to change your life\nthat's empowering so if you don't like\nwhere you are you chose to be there\nbased off the decisions that you've made\nin the past your habits\ncome from a story that you are telling\nyourself about yourself this is where it\ngets interesting we're gonna start\ntalking about your identity okay\nyour habits and actions that you take\ncome\nfrom the story that you're telling\nyourself about yourself so if you say\nstuff like i'm lazy\ni procrastinate\ni you know being overweight runs in my\nfamily that's why i'm overweight i love\nto sleep in i'm always late\ni love food too much to lose weight if\nyou tell yourself any of that\nthat's the identity that you have\ncreated for yourself and you are going\nto take the actions\nthat align with that identity so if you\nsay\noh my my family is all overweight so\nthat's you know i'm going to be\noverweight as well if you say that you\nhave now placed an identity on top of\nyourself my family is overweight i'm\ngoing to be overweight as well if i take\nthe identity of i'm going to be\noverweight because my family is\noverweight\nthen i'm going to take actions that line\nup with that identity why the hell would\ni ever work out if i think to myself i'm\ngoing to be overweight no matter what i\ndo because if i'm going to be overweight\nno matter what i do why the hell would i\ngo to the gym that doesn't sound fun i'm\nstill gonna be overweight so i'm going\nto take actions not going to the gym\nthat line up with my identity being\noverweight which is going to then make\nmy identity being overweight a reality i\nwill be overweight if i say to myself oh\nyeah you know i i love food too much\nit's just it's just a part of the way i\nwas raised it's my culture you know for\nus to to eat big meals together and all\nthat\nif that's your identity then you're\ngoing to eat more than you probably\nshould and you're going to have a hard\ntime breaking the habit of eating\nsomething that's bad for you or too much\nfor you into something that's healthy if\nyou have the identity of that's just the\nway i am i'm always going to be\noverweight\nwhy would you ever eat a salad like if\nif i had the choice if someone came to\nme and said hey rob\ni've got a salad right here and i've got\na pepperoni pizza right here which one\ndo you want pepperoni pizza is gonna win\nevery damn day why because it's so much\nfreaking better than salad we can all\nagree on that can't we so if i know that\ni'm going to be overweight no matter\nwhat i do why would i ever eat healthy\nwhy do you eat a salad when i can eat\npizza i'm going to be fat anyways right\ni'm going to be overweight because\nthat's just my reality that's the\nresults that i'm going to have so why\ndon't i just do what i need to do i have\ncreated an identity in my head\ni'm taking actions that line up with\nthat identity and my results from that\nidentity will create\nthe identity that i have\nwhich is still overweight and this goes\nwith lazy this goes with broke this goes\nwith i procrastinate too much this goes\nwith i'm late all the time your actions\nand habits will stem from what you\nbelieve about yourself so if you want to\nbecome one percent better every single\nday guess what you're gonna have to do\nyou're gonna have to work on your\nmindset every single day your mindset's\ngonna have to get one percent better\nevery single day because your identity\nneeds to shift you're under no\nobligation to be who you were five\nminutes ago it's what alan watts always\nsays\nright if you want to be a different\nperson tomorrow you've got to shift your\nbelief in who you are today you know if\nyou think you're overweight you're not\ngoing to work out if you think you're\ngoing to be overweight no matter what\nyou're not going to eat healthy\nyou're going to be overweight anyways\nwhy would you put your body through\nstress and eat something that doesn't\ntaste as good you have to change your\ninternal story in order to change your\nexternal results so\nyou got to change your behaviors but\ntrue behavior change is actually a\nchange in identity\nthat's what people don't realize i heard\na crazy statistic the other day\nfor people who lose weight at least 20\npounds do you know what percentage of\nthem\nkeep the weight off let me let me ask\nanother another way out of people that\n100 of people that go and they lose 20\npounds what percent of them do you think\nactually go back to that weight\nsay it out loud to yourself what do you\nthink it is i asked my my videographer\nbefore she started she said 50\nthe number is 97\n97\nof people\n97 of people that lose at least 20\npounds gain it back in the next couple\nyears\nthree percent of people keep it off\nthere's a lot of reasons why one of them\nhas to do with their identity another\nreally big reason why is who they\nsurround themselves with if you lose\nweight and you hang out with a lot of\nother people who are overweight you'll\nmore likely to be overweight if you have\none friend that's obese you have 57\npercent higher chance of being obese if\nyou have one friend that's obese so if\nyou start if you if you lose weight but\nall your friends are still overweight\nyou're probably going to gain all the\nway back if you lose weight and you\nstart hanging out with people who are\nextremely fit you're probably going to\nbe in that three percent they continue\nto keep the weight off it has to do with\nyour community that you surround\nyourself with it has to do with the\nidentity of the way you actually see\nyourself same thing works if you think\nof\nsomeone who grows a successful business\nand they keep it and they continue to\ngrow and grow and grow it versus running\ninto the ground\nthe person who grows and grows and grows\nit usually is somebody who is\nsurrounding themselves with other people\nwho are growing their business as well\nthat's keeping them motivated to go in\nthat direction and a lot of it has to do\nwith the community and the other bit of\nit has to go with obviously the identity\nthat they have so changing your\nbehaviors true behavior change is\nactually a change in identity it's\nsaying this is who i am that this is who\ni am will dictate the actions that you\ntake\nall of the time just the way that it\ngoes your bank account\njust so you know is a result of your\nspending and earning habits let's make\nthis as simple as possible\nwhen you look at your bank account if\nyou don't like your bank account and how\nmuch is in it your bank account is a\nresult of only two things how much you\nearn and how much you spend nothing else\nhow much you earn how much money comes\nin\nhow much you spend how much money you\nlet it go out of it so if you want to\nchange your bank account you've either\ngot to earn more or you've got to spend\nless or both\nthat's it your body is a result of your\neating habits your working out habits\nand how you take care of yourself so if\nyou want to change your body and make it\nbetter you've either got to change the\namount of working out that you do and\nthe way you work out or you've got to\nchange the way that you eat or both\nthat's it your business\nis simply a result of the hard work the\ndedication the work habits and the\ncommitment that you have to your\nbusiness\nthat's it\nit's very simple like you don't have to\npeople make\nlife\nand happiness and success\nso hard they struggle their way to get\nthere but when you take a ten thousand\nfoot view and you go let's look at it\nfrom ten thousand feet you go\nyeah it's really not that hard if i\nwanna lose weight i gotta work out more\ni gotta eat healthier and i've gotta if\ni wanna lose weight i've gotta be have a\ndeficit in my calories i've got to burn\nmore calories than i consume\nthat's it there's nothing else if i want\nto make more money have more money in my\nbank account and my savings i've got to\neither make more money or spend less\nmoney\nor both that's it there's nothing else\nthat's to it and so you just make simple\nhabits around it but you've got to ask\nyourself what is your identity around\nthat if my identity is i've been broke\nmy entire life my entire family is broke\nwe've always been poor we've always\nstruggled rich people have to screw\npeople over in order to make their money\nif that's the identity that i have\naround myself and around other people\nwho are rich\nthen i'm gonna have a really hard time\ntaking the action that i need to to\nbecome wealthy\nsimply because\nmy identity is wrapped around this fake\nstory it's this narrative this story\nthat we're telling ourselves at all\npoints in time and james clear\nhas a quote that i love and it's every\naction is a vote for the person that you\nwant to become whether you realize\nyou're doing it or not every action is a\nvote for the person that you want to\nbecome\nso\nhow are you voting are you voting to\nbecome the person that you want with the\nbody that you want with the bank account\nthat you want the relationship that you\nwant or are you voting and not realizing\nit for becoming the person that you\ndon't want to become not in the shape\nthat you want not with the relationships\nyou want now with the bank account that\nyou want to mount the business that you\nwant and it's little teeny tiny habits\nthat's why it's one percent better not\n400 better tomorrow one percent better\nit's little teeny tiny habits like\nnobody\nnobody dies from eating one hamburger\nthey don't\nthey don't have a heart attack from\neating one hamburger they have a heart\nattack from a bunch of decisions over 5\n10 15 20 30 40 years\ndecisions little tiny decisions\nthey accumulated over years and years\nthey compounded to get them to a heart\nattack at 55 years old whatever it is no\none gets fit from one push-up\nno you guys know that it's a lot of work\nand time put into it and then one two\nthree two years down the road now\nthey've got the body that they want no\none gets smart from reading one book no\nit's a bunch of reading books and having\na dedication to knowledge having a\ndedication to the body of the one having\na dedication where they should be the\none having a dedication to the bank\naccount that they want having a\ndedication to whatever it is that you\nwant tiny habits make up who you are\nwhat are your tiny habits if i were to\nfollow you around i always ask this in\nuh in my kaiser mastermind i said if i\nwere to follow you around all day every\nday with a pen and paper and write down\nevery single thing that you do what\nhabits do you have\nthat you'd be worried about me seeing\nwhat actions do you take or not take\nthat you would be like oh i don't want\nrob to see this think about that for a\nsecond because those are the ones that\nhave got to go those are the ones you've\ngot to get rid of are you the type of\nperson to\nwake up on time are you the type of\nperson to hit the snooze button 17 times\nevery single day are you the type of\nperson to spend money or the type of\nperson to save it are you the type of\nperson to eat\nthat unhealthy food are you the type of\nperson to say no to the unhealthy food\nand go for the food that you know you\nshould are you the type of person that\nsays oh i need a glass of wine every\nsingle night or you're the type of\nperson that says you know what i've come\nto realize that it's not good for me to\nbe able to drink every single night so\ni'm gonna not drink every single night i\nsaw a study not too long ago about what\none glass of wine over the course of an\nentire week does to your brain\ncompounded over 10 20 years and it\nliterally if the guy's name is dr eamon\nif you want to go to he's got a book\ncalled change your brain change your\nlife a-m-e-n dr amen literally puts\nholes in your brain from having one\nalcoholic drink every single week\nholy\nright but\nif you look at someone's brain at 60\nyears old who decided to drink a little\nbit and they've got a brain that isn't\ncomplete\nwhen you look at the scan it's because\nof just decisions that they made there's\nno right or wrong there's no judgment\nit's just simple you're going to get the\nresults of your life based off of the\ndecisions and the actions that you take\nthat's it there's nothing else\nyou're going to get the results based\noff of decisions and actions that you\nhave in your life that's it\nthose things come from your identity and\nthat's what we're trying to shift every\nsingle day to become one percent better\nright we only see people who are\nsuccessful in the end result at the end\nbut we don't see the little teeny tiny\nthings that they did for 5 10 15 20\nyears to get there the journey of a\nthousand miles begins with a single step\nand we start something brand new and\nwe're excited sorry about something\nbrand new and then within two weeks\nwe're pissed off because we're not at\nmaya 1000 yet no dude you're at mile\nyou're literally step 14\nand you're pissed off that you're not at\nmile 1000 every single day is another\nstep you got to know that the journey as\nlong as you're on the right path as long\nas you're on the right path to get there\nand you're progressing every single day\nit's a win and you've got to just know\nthat eventually time will get you to\nwhere you want to be you can't be pissed\noff that you're not where you want to be\nyou know two weeks into starting a brand\nnew business\nyou're not there yet you can't look on\ninstagram and see somebody who has a\nlamborghini or the body that you don't\nhave and be like oh yeah well they were\njust born with money or they were just\nblessed with that body no they took\naction to make the money that they\nwanted to to get the lamborghini or they\nworked out and ate in order to get that\nbody like just simply look at it stop\ngiving excuses to why you're not having\nthe body or the lamborghini that they\nhave and simply realize they did actions\nthat got them that body or that\nlamborghini and if i take actions i can\nget that body or that lamborghini as\nwell\nit's that simple don't compare yourself\nto other people and also don't compare\nyourself if you're\nweek one in the gym to some woman who's\nbeen working out for five years and be\nlike well i'm not where she is you can't\ncompare your chapter one to somebody\nelse's chapter 20. as long as you're on\nthe journey and trying to improve every\nsingle day and noticing oh you know what\nwell at least i'm working out four times\na week now\nthree weeks ago i wasn't working out at\nall at least i've lost a pound in the\npast couple weeks at least i'm not\neating the food that i was eating you're\non the path to where you want to go\nthat's all that really matters it's the\npath of just changing yourself and\nbecoming a little bit better every\nsingle day you can't compare yourself to\nother people because some people have\nbeen on the path the same path that you\nare now on or you're starting to get on\nfor a lot longer than you stop comparing\nyour chapter one to somebody else's\nchapter 20 stop shaming the other people\nand stop making excuses as to why you're\nthere there because they're blessed with\ncertain genetics and because they're\nblessed with being in a family they gave\nthem enough money to get a lamborghini\nor whatever it is and go you know what\ngood for them they've gotten they're\njust a little bit further along in this\njourney than i am i'm going to be there\none day as well\nyou know who do who do you want to be in\n10 years what actions you need to take\nin order to line up with that life\nright do your actions right now line up\nwith that future 10 years from today do\nyour current actions look like the\nhabits and the actions of the person\nthat you need to become\nbecause if they don't shift them move\nthem change them just a little bit it's\nnever what you need to do\nin order to get to the life that you\nwant it's who you need to become in\norder to make that life happen that's\nthe interesting thing about it is most\npeople think oh i need to do all these\nthings which i agree with but if i\nbecome the type of person who is healthy\nand i tell myself that i'm healthy it's\nnot telling myself oh my entire family\nis just overweight that's what i'm going\nto be but if i tell myself i am a\nhealthy person i will start to make\nhealthier decisions it's not about what\nyou need to do in order to get the life\nthat you need or you want it's about who\nyou need to become in order to get the\nlife that you want and if you become\nthat person you will simply start to do\nthe things that that type of person will\ndo and you have to change a lot less\nabout yourself than you realize a whole\nlot less there's maybe\nfive or ten things that you really need\nto change about yourself to have massive\nchange in your life i'm talking about\nlittle tiny changes it's not 50\ndifferent changes not 100 different\nchanges you know it's like wake up\nearlier have a morning routine meditate\na little bit read a little bit eat food\nthat's good for you and realize that\nfood is medicine stop poisoning your\nbody stop procrastinating and just start\ntaking action stop making excuses as to\nwhy you're not where you want to be take\nfull ownership of your life work out\nthree four five times a week and stop\nwatching tv in the news and if you do\nmost of those things you're gonna have a\npretty damn good life in about 10 years\nit's not a million things that you need\nto change it's just a few things\nthroughout your day just about being one\npercent better so it's not about being a\nbrand new person tomorrow it's about\nbeing one percent better when you go to\nbed tonight than you were when you woke\nup and you have to decide is this is\nthis journey that i'm on is it a hobby\nis it something that i'm just trying out\nor is this a lifestyle is this a\nlifestyle of me just trying to be better\nevery single day and all you have to do\nand this is what i want you to do an\nassignment i'm going to give you if\nyou're listening this okay\ni want you to identify three to five\nsmall habits not massive habits three to\nfive small habits that you want to\nimplement and start implementing into\nyour day every single day and then once\nyou write those down i want you to ask\nyourself how can i make taking action on\nthese easier and make a plan to make\nthese easier and eventually if you just\nkeep improving a little bit every single\nday you'll wake up a year from today and\nyou realize holy sh i'm in a much better\nplace than i was\n12 months ago at this very moment\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well here's\nthe secret to life you know what you\nneed to do to be successful whatever\nsuccess means to you you know what you\nneed to do\nyou're just not doing it"
