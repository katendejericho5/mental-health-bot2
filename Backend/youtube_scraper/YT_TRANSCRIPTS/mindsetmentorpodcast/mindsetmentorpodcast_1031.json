    "transcript": "if you have stress and anxiety realize\nthat it is normal\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\novercome stress and anxiety i'm actually\ngoing to give you my four step process\nfor how to remove yourself from stress\nand anxiety and with all of the stuff\nthat's happening in the world right now\ni don't think i need to tell you how\nimportant this knowledge is to be able\nto have a process to help you if you\nhappen to feel anxious or happen to have\nanxious thoughts or anxious feelings but\nalso if you happen to get extremely\nstressed out this will help you as well\nso\ni saw a statistic today\nthat said that in 2020 alone overdoses\nwere up by 30 percent and overdoses or\npeople taking some form of a drug\nusually to numb a feeling and a lot of\ntimes that feeling is stress\nsadness\nanxiety and so if you can have these\ntools in your tool belt you can remember\nthis it can help you as you're working\nthrough these the first thing that i\nwant to say\nuh about stress and anxiety though is\nthis is if you have stress and anxiety\nrealize that it is normal to have it all\nday all you know evening every single\nsecond day that's not necessarily normal\nbut to have some form of stress and\nanxiety is not necessarily\nshowing you that you're broken you're\nnot broken if you have anxious thoughts\nyou're not broken if you have fearful\nthoughts you're not broken if you have\nworry that tends to creep into your mind\ntoo often one of the things that i find\nwith people before we dive in and\nactually talk about how to overcome the\nstress and anxiety is for you to realize\nthat if you feel them don't judge\nyourself don't think that you're broken\ndon't think that the system that you\nhave in your body there's something\nwrong with it is what it is it will\nhappen and you have to understand that\nthere's ways to get out of stress and\nanxiety now i do want to be very clear\nwhen i talk about stress and anxiety i'm\ntalking about stress and anxiety i'm not\ntalking about depression depression if\nit's a clinical depression is a chemical\nimbalance inside of somebody's brain i'm\nnot talking about a chemical balance\ninside of your brain uh and very rarely\ndo people actually have any form of a\ntest when they are\nyou know actually clinically depressed\nvery rarely do doctors actually say well\nlet's actually test what's going on in\nyour brain it's usually they're like\nokay what are your symptoms here's some\npills to get rid of it a lot of times\nand actually to be honest with you give\nyou a statistic 61 of the time uh they\nfound that people are misdiagnosed with\ndepression when they actually don't have\ndepression they have stress and anxiety\nso i'm talking about specifically stress\nand anxiety i'm not talking about\ndepression the first thing to do though\nis to realize that it's normal\neverybody's going to have stress and\nanxiety at some point in time in their\nlives it's just about something that you\ncan work through don't judge yourself\ndon't think that you're broken none of\nthat stuff what is happening is your\nbody is identifying some form of a\nthreat in its environment that's really\nwhat stress and anxiety is there is a\nthreat we need to become aware of it we\nneed to work through it the problem is\nnowadays is that threat is actually not\nsomething that's in your immediate\nenvironment\nif it was a hundred thousand years ago\nand we're talking about our ancestors\nwhen they felt stress and anxiety it was\nprobably when there was a predator that\nwas around them or you know they're\nwalking by\na lake\nand one of their tribal members gets\nattacked by an alligator and now they\nall have to figure out what to do so in\nthat case that's where stress and\nanxiety actually come from and that's\nwhere they're useful but when you look\nat it today usually our stress and\nanxiety comes from our thoughts about\nthe future or some future event that\nwe're not necessarily in control of\nright now so your body is doing what it\nneeds to do it's what it's actually\ndoing is your body is sending your brain\nmessages and you can either listen to\nthe messages or you can ignore them it's\nup to you or you can listen to the\nmessages or and you can work through\nthem so if you know that the feeling of\nstress and anxiety is the body asking\nitself or\nbeing aware\nthat there is a threat the first thing\nyou can ask yourself\nif you're feeling stressed and anxiety\nis there a threat around me and a lot of\ntimes you look around and you're like\nactually uh no i'm just sitting inside\nof my house\nyou know looking at instagram in the air\nconditioning and then you realize there\nis no actual real threat that's\nhappening right in front of you the\nthreat\nmore than anything else is actually\ncoming from your mind that's what it is\nand so as we go through and we talk\nabout this your body's doing what it\nneeds to do you need to listen to it you\nneed to become aware of the stress of\nthe anxiety of the worry of the fear all\nof those things and realize\nthat right now where you currently are\nor that moment where you are in stress\nand anxiety and fear all of those\n99.9 of time you're safe\nand that's an important thing for your\nbrain and your body to physically\nemotionally and intellectually\nunderstand and feel is the feeling of\nsafety\nokay\ni'm i'm stressed but am i safe\ni am\nokay beautiful well now we can work\nthrough that we can start to figure out\nwhat's going on so\nask yourself the question am i safe look\nat your surroundings look at everything\nthat's happening to you and make a clear\ndistinction in your brain if you're safe\nor not if you are safe i want you to\nintellectually emotionally and\nphysically feel the feeling of safety\ninside of your body most of the time if\nyou can literally just feel the feeling\nof safety and emotionally intellectually\nin every single aspect of you to to to\nsink into safety a lot of times your\nanxiety and your stress will go away and\nit's just\nokay\ni am safe\ni am okay right now there might be\nsomething in the future that i'm\nthinking about\nokay i can work through that i can get\nto it when that future comes but i'm not\nin that future moment what moment am i\nin i'm in this present moment that's\nwhat moment i'm in okay so if i'm in a\npresent moment\nthen can i just work through this\npresent moment right now absolutely i\ncan and so we're focusing on a threat\nthat's what we're focusing on\nbut i've identified that i am some\nform of safe okay good now what i can do\nis i can go on to step two i've\nidentified that i'm safe\ni've identified that i'm okay step two\nis to stop identifying yourself with\nyour feelings\nso a lot of people say i'm stressed\ni'm anxious if you've been listening to\npodcasts long enough you've heard me say\nit do not ever identify yourself\nwith a feeling that is not you don't\nidentify yourself with something that is\nnot empowering don't ever say the phrase\ni am if the fri if the words that are\ngoing to follow it are not the most\nempowering things that you can say to\nyourself so to say that i am stressed i\nam anxious is that empowering it isn't\nstress and anxiety is a feeling and it's\nan emotion it's like a cloud that's\npassing you'll never look at a cloud\nthat's passing and say i am that cloud\nor if it's you know the weather if it's\nraining you don't say i am rain you're\nnot it's just okay the weather is\npassing i know that eventually the rain\nwill stop i know that eventually that\ncloud will pass so there's no reason for\nme to identify myself with it so step\nnumber two after you've identified step\nnumber one which is that you're safe\nstep number two is to go okay\ni am not stressed\ni happen to currently be feeling the\nfeelings of stress\nor i happen to be\nworking through my stress\ni am not anxious i am just currently\nfeeling a little anxious and for some of\nyou might be like this doesn't seem like\nit matters much it matters a lot because\nyou're not identifying\nyourself\nwith this feeling with this emotion\nwhich is just like a passing cloud\nyou're not that you are the human behind\nthat and if you want to get even deeper\nyou're the soul that's inside of the\nhuman behind that you're not anxious\nyou're not stressed\nyou're just happening to feel those\nfeelings right now and we all know\nfeelings they're fleeting you can be\nhappy one moment you could be stressed\none moment you could be sad one moment\nyou could be anxious another moment do\nnot identify yourself with any form of a\nfeeling\nunless it's the most empowering thing\nthat you can identify yourself with so\nstep number one is to identify that you\nare safe\nstep number two is to i stop identifying\nwith the emotion or with the feeling\nbecause you're not broken there's\nnothing wrong with you that is not who\nyou are step number three is that you\nneed to breathe\nand if you've been listening to me for\nlong enough you've heard me talk about\nthe importance of breath if you've been\nlooking at any scientific research\nrecently it seems like the breath is\nlike this amazing thing that people are\njust starting to finally uncover and\nidentify as this thing that just changes\nhuman states remarkably and so you've\nprobably heard me talk about six deep\nbreaths\ncan absolutely change your state\nimmediately and it's very simple it's\njust in through the nose out through the\nmouth the key of it though is to\nliterally make your inhale come in and\nmake your exhale\nlonger than your inhale the exhale is\nthe more important part and the reason\nwhy is because the longer the exhale the\nmore it actually slows your heart rate\ndown when you're feeling stressed and\nwhen you're feeling anxious your heart\nrate will go up\nabsolutely i'll give you a perfect\nexample i wear a heart rate monitor on\nmyself at all points in time it's called\na whoop and literally i was watching the\nuh the very last game of the nha nhl uh\nfinals stanley cup finals and i'm a\ntampa bay lightning fan because i come\nfrom tampa bay the last two minutes i\nliterally turned my heart rate monitor\non my heart rate resting heart rate went\nfrom one seven i'm sorry i went from 75\nall the way up to 120 in the last three\nminutes because my i was feeling\nstressed and anxious like we got to win\nthis game we got to win this game it's\nonly the last two minutes we're only up\nby one\nso\njust the feeling raised my heart rate so\nif i want to lower my heart rate i get\nto breathe in through my nose and then\nwhen i exhale here's the key\nis to act as if you're breathing through\na straw that's how you want to do it so\nthe inhale can be\nand the next tail can be\nthat alone\nlowers your heart rate do that six times\nand there was a japanese study that\nfound that six deep breaths exactly like\ni just showed you can completely change\nthe state of somebody and help them get\nrid of their anxiety and their stress so\nthe exhale has to be longer act like\nyou're breathing out of a straw gets\nyour lips to be like if they're wrapped\naround a straw and the exhale is what\nlowers your heart rate okay so now we've\nidentified first off number one i'm\nthere is no threat i'm okay i'm safe\nright now number two i am not this\nanxiety i am not this stress number\nthree now i'm starting to work through\nit and i'm actually starting to breathe\ni'm trying to bring myself back to a\ncentered state the last one is now to\nbecome self-aware when emotion is high\nlogic is low the worst thing to try to\ndo is to try to think your way out of a\npanic attack or think your way out of\nstress or think your way out of anxiety\nno first you've got to bring your body\nback to a stable state before you do\nanything else that's the most important\nthing so step number four is to become\nself-aware don't worry about trying to\nfigure out\nwhy you're feeling the way that you're\nfeeling when you're feeling it let the\nfeelings pass let the cloud pass and do\nwhat it's going to do now once it has\npassed and i feel back like i'm on to a\nlevel of calm and equanimity and peace\nand joy and i feel a little bit better\nat least\nnow i can become self-aware i can take\nout my journal i can start my pen and\npaper figure out\nwhat made me feel that way\nwhy because i want to avoid it if i'm\nyou know walking and every single time i\nwalk down the street i fall in a hole in\nthe sidewalk and twist my ankle\nwouldn't i want to make sure that i\ndon't do that next time i walk down the\nstreet wouldn't i want to at least you\nknow avoid that next time of course so\nif i've noticed that i've you know\nmentally or physically through anxious\nthoughts and feelings\nfallen into a hole inside of the\nsidewalk\nmaybe i should figure out how i can\navoid that hole in the sidewalk next\ntime i go buy it and so i get a pen and\npaper and i start to figure out\nwhat's going on now that i've rose you\nknow brought my levels back down to\nsomewhat normal i'm gonna ask myself\nwhat what was i focusing on that made\nthat happen so when i felt that rush of\nanxious thoughts that rush of stress\nwhat was i focusing on what was i\nthinking about what was i ruminating on\nwhat were the majority of my thoughts\nbeing consumed by and here's\nalmost every single time what it is\nyou're being consumed by thoughts of a\npossible future something that might\nhappen later on down the road\nbut hasn't even happened yet and what's\nactually causing you the stress and the\nanxiety is the fact that in this present\nmoment you can't control the possible\nfuture moment and so the anxious\nthoughts is actually a control problem\nwanting to control the future when in\nreality there's no way that you can ever\ncontrol the future\nyou can't and you know you can't and so\nyou actually start to ask yourself what\nwas i thinking about what was\nidentifying what was i\nruminating on the entire time that made\nme feel the way that i felt because i\ndon't like feeling that way and i don't\nwant to feel that way again so i'm going\nto journal through it and next time i\nnotice myself start to go down the\nrabbit hole of\nworrying about that thing that's coming\nup in the future maybe it's a deadline\nthat you have at work\nmaybe it's a bill i can take myself out\nof it and this is a key that one of my\nmentors gave me just say this phrase\nnot right now\nand it sounds ridiculously simple it\nsounds like it wouldn't work but if you\njust tell yourself not right now and let\nyour brain know that that's what's going\non that we're not going to focus on it\ninterestingly enough your brain will\nstart to release these things when you\ntrain yourself to just release it\nsince my one of my mentors taught me\nthis if i start if i there's a lot of\ntimes that i'll wake up in the in the\nmiddle of the night three o'clock and\ni'll go to the bathroom and i'll come\nback and thoughts of business and things\nthat have to be done and my to-do list\nwill come into my head and i don't know\nabout you but that'll keep me up for an\nhour two hours sometimes\nthat's it doesn't happen often but when\nit does happen\nmy brain goes down this rabbit hole of\nthoughts and to-do lists and all of\nthese things when i learn this strategy\nfrom a mentor it literally just allows\nme to get rid of it\nthe thought is\nnot right now\nso when i wake up i go to the bathroom i\ncome back into bed and i think about oh\nthis thing that i have to do i have to\nbe up at 7. i have to do this this this\nthis is this oh i've also got this much\nto do this i just go hey brain\nnot right now\nand my brain kind of goes oh\noh yeah okay that's fine it sounds so\nridiculously simple it sounds like it\nwouldn't work and my mom told me about i\nwas like it's definitely not going to\nwork it freaking works my brain's like\noh okay cool\nit's like a dog that's that's chewing on\na toy and you take the toy from it\nyou're like no and i was like oh\nall right cool i guess that's i guess\nthat's what i got to do\nit's just the way that it works so\nnow that you've realized\nwhat you have stressed out about you can\nfigure out what got you there and now\nwhen it comes up again in the future you\nhave a way to work through it so you\nknow how to release yourself from it the\nquestion that you want to think about is\nwhat can i control right now\nso what can i control right now\ni can't control that future what can i\ncontrol right now i control how i feel\nright now i can control how i think\nright now so let me go ahead and try to\npick those things up i want to work\nthrough those two things how can i make\nmyself feel better right now not later\nnot thinking about the future how can i\nmake myself feel better right now stop\ntaking yourself out of the present\nmoment if you can bring yourself back in\nthe present moment and you can remind\nyour brain and your body that you're\nsafe next time you start to feel a lot\nof stress and anxiety and you can\nbreathe through it a lot of times you\ncan literally feel the stress leaving\nyour body feel the anxiety leaving your\nbody and at that point you're in power\nto take your life back\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well simply\nchanging the way i want you to be aware\nof this right now how are you sitting"
