    "transcript": "are you the same person in front of\neverybody or do you act a certain way in\nfront of your friends and then you act a\ncertain way in front of your family and\nthen you act a certain way in front of\nyour mom you are not free\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to be truly\nauthentically who you are at the core\ngetting rid of all of the crap\nand how to actually truly step into your\nfull authentic self and i'm gonna give\nyou a story as we go through this but\nwe're going to talk about how to also\nnot give your power away as you go\nthrough this and you know if i want to\ntell you a story if you've been\nlistening to my podcast for a while\nyou're probably aware of the way that i\nspeak right you're aware that i am a\nshort to the point no bs podcast and i\nhappen to cuss and guess what i love it\ni love cussing i love cuss words they\njust they they bring so much\nrichness to a sentence right i love it\nand some people don't love it and i'm\naware of that i'm going to tell you\nabout how i stepped into being more\ntruly authentically myself and how i had\na struggle with it and it's around\ncussing and it's gonna help you\nunderstand how i stepped into it\nhopefully this story will help you step\ninto who you truly authentically are as\nwell so i love cussing simply because i\nthink it brings so much flavor to a\nstory like if i were to say oh what i\nwent through was really hard or if i\nwere to say oh what i went through is\nreally\nhard like it just seems like there's\nmore emphasis on it right\nand at the same time it's me being truly\nauthentically myself could i not say a\ncuss word absolutely i cannot say a cuss\nword but that means that if i wanted to\nsay it and i didn't say it i'm holding\nmyself back from being truly\nauthentically who i am and when i first\nstarted this podcast actually i didn't\ncuss for a long time like three and a\nhalf years it was about 650 episodes\nbefore i started actually cussing maybe\ni'd throw out a couple cuss words one\nout of every 30 episodes but i kept it\nreally tight and then i thought to\nmyself if i'm going to be giving myself\nto these people if i'm going to be\ntrying to be true if i'm going to be\ntelling them to be authentic and i am\nnot being authentic then i'm a coward\nand i'm also a fraud and people\nshouldn't listen to me and so i made the\ndecision you know what if people don't\nlike cuss words\ni'm not their guy\nand i'm okay with that and what you have\nto realize in life is that when you step\ninto who you truly authentically are\nyou're not\ngoing to be everybody's guy you're not\ngoing to be everybody's girl you're not\ngoing to be every single person's cup of\ntea and that is completely fine somebody\nwho listens to my podcast that wants me\nto be like hey sweetheart it's okay and\nto pat their head and to tell them that\nlife is gonna be amazing and that it's\nokay that they've been making mistakes\ni'm just i'm just not that person but\nthat person probably exists out there\nand so i'm okay with that person\nlistening to my podcast and going nope\ndon't like this guy\nbut i didn't used to be okay with that\nmy question to you is are you okay with\nsomeone going nope i don't like this guy\nor nope i don't like this girl\nare you okay\nwith somebody not liking you at your\ntrue deepest core because a lot of\npeople think that they're okay with it\nuntil they get haters they think they're\nokay with it until they get a negative\nreview they think they're okay with it\nand then they realize they ain't okay\nwith it and i want you guys to realize\nthat number one first off this is\nsomething that i that i i want you to\nunderstand is that the true authentic\nversion of yourself is somewhere in\nthere it might have been so long since\nyou've been your true authentic self or\nmaybe you've never been your true\nauthentic self because your parents told\nyou not to do this or because society\ntold you not to do that and because you\nsaw what you are and are not supposed to\ndo that you're like i don't even know\nwho i truly am well now it's a ver now\nit's a self-discovery that you get to go\non and find out who that is but if you\nwere to walk into my house if you were\nto be around me when i'm around my\nfriends i cuss i don't hold back i make\njokes and i realize that i wasn't truly\nauthentically myself for a lot of my\npodcast episodes and i said i can't not\nbe that way and if i'm not someone's cup\nof tea then i'm not someone's cup of tea\nthat's okay and i knew\nthat things were going to happen the way\nthey're gonna happen and maybe i would\nlose some some listeners maybe i'll lose\nsome followers but you know what some\npeople are gonna listen to me and go yep\nthat's my dude that's exactly where that\ni think that's exactly where that i talk\nbecause here's what's interesting if\nsomeone listens to my podcast and then\nthey decide you know what that's my guy\ni want to go ahead and i want to learn\nhow to build a business from him or you\nknow i know he does business consulting\nmaybe i should learn a little bit from\nhim and then they join and they see a\ndifferent version of me in person\ncoaching them than they do while it's on\nthe podcast then i'm attracting the\nwrong type of person in the first place\nby not truly authentically being myself\nand if i'm not truly authentically being\nmyself i'm going to feel resistance\ntowards doing something because i'm not\nbeing the person that i want to be and\nwhen we're talking about cussing just\nside note\nwhen i'm talking about getting your own\npower back\ncussing is just a word a word is just a\nsound and a sound is just coming from\nsomebody's face so if you're\nif you're out there and you or someone\nthat you know is offended by cuss words\nthat is a program\nthat person has been programmed to\nactually not like a sound coming out of\nsomeone's face what is the difference\nbetween me saying\nand me saying\nnothing there's no difference between sh\nit's just a sound coming out of my face\nbut somewhere along the way somebody\nsaid oh no\nintelligent people don't speak that way\noh no that's trashy to speak that way\nthat's not elegant to say that to talk\nlike that and i hear it all of the time\nand i see people send me messages on\ninstagram rob i love your podcast\nbecause you stopped cussing so much and\ni'm like sorry no that's not\nauthentically me and then i look at my\nreviews sometimes and sometimes like\nlike one i got one the other day\ntwo-star review on my podcast they love\nall the stuff that i put out but they\nsaid i sound trashy with the way that i\nspeak i'm like hey that is the way that\nit is and if you don't like it then you\ndon't like it so that's why you know if\nyou do like my podcast please go give me\na freaking review and let's get some\nfive star reviews in there for instead\nof the the two star if there's a pl\nbelieve me there's thousands and\nthousands more five star reviews and\nthere are two star reviews but there's\npeople out there that get offended by a\nsound coming out of somebody's face and\nthat is something that is programmed\ninto them and\nif a word can make somebody feel a\ncertain way that person doesn't have\ncontrol of their own personal\nsovereignty they are not a free being if\nthey're being triggered by a sound\ncoming out of someone's face eleanor\nroosevelt says\nno one can make you feel inferior\nwithout your consent the same way\nnobody can make you internally change\nthe state of you\nwithout your consent so if i say a word\nor you say a word and someone hears it\nand it makes them change their internal\nstate they have given up their own\npersonal sovereignty the way that they\nfeel their emotions in their thoughts\nto everybody outside of them there's no\ncontrol there's no personal sovereignty\nand people who do get offended i had\nthis long conversation i talked about\nthis in a podcast hundreds of episodes\nago\nwith my mom and her sisters came in town\nabout four years ago three years ago and\none of my aunts was like hey do you i\ni don't hold back i speak the way that i\nspeak and i i said the word\nand my aunt's like hey don't speak like\nthat can you not speak that way it\nsounds it sounds unintelligent and i go\nit's time for a coaching session and so\ni go okay\nher name's pam i said okay pam um what\nabout that word is unintelligent and\nshe's like oh well it's just there's\nother words that you could use and i go\nof course there's other words that i\ncould use but what about that word is\nactually unintelligent like wherein it\nthat word shows you unintelligence\nshe's like well i guess it doesn't\nnecessarily show it just you could use\nwords that would make you sound more\nintelligent and i go so what word would\nmake me sound more intelligent so we had\nthis conversation and we got deeper and\ndeeper and deeper and deeper and ended\nup talking i got to the point that my\ngrandmother who i love\nand she said people who are dumb cuss\nthat's how she that's people that are\nunintelligent use customers that's how\nshe raised her children and so that\nprogram was set into their mind and now\nthey're carrying it along with them in\nthe the book the four agreements he\ntalks about anything that somebody says\nto you and you accept into your mind and\nit changes your perception is like a\nvirus put into a computer right if my\ngran my grandma spoke a virus into her\nchildren i love her to death\nwell she is she is dead now so i still\nlove her even though she has experienced\ndeath i guess i could say but she put a\nvirus into her children it's okay\nthere's nothing wrong with this i'm just\ngoing to explain this to you right she\nput a virus into her children and that\nvirus played out over and over and over\nagain same way that if i put a virus\ninto a computer that will affect the\ncomputer and the way that it runs\nforever until that virus is removed and\nso\nwe added this conversation we ended up\nfinding out the reason why they didn't\nlike the cussing was because when they\nwere children my grandma said this to\nthem and i said do you realize that\nyou're not free\nif somebody can say a word and it\nchanges your internal state you are not\nfree\nyou are under that person's control if\nsomebody can say a four-letter word and\nyou know instead of saying the word pool\nthey say\nand it's a different four-letter word\nand one of them changes your internal\nstate you are caught in a program you\nare caught in a construct you are caught\nin a virus you need to figure out how to\nremove that virus and ask yourself do i\nactually hate\nyou know that word or is the word just\nsomething that doesn't really matter to\nme and i've just been programmed to\nthink that way so that was a whole side\nnote that i want you to think about\nbecause no one makes you feel inferior\nwithout your consent as eleanor\nroosevelt said and victor frankel who\nwrote an incredible book called man's\nsearch for meaning viktor frankl was a\npsychologist who was a prisoner in\nauschwitz in many other nazi prison\ncamps and he saw what happened to people\nand he saw how their minds would go and\nhow some people had strong mental\nfortitude and how some people did it and\nhow some people lived through it and how\nsome people didn't based off of the way\nthat their belief system was and one of\nthe things he says is is the last human\nfreedom that we have is the is uh is to\nchoose one's attitude in any given set\nof circumstances to choose one's own way\nthere will always be choices to make so\nwhat he's saying is that your last\nfreedom is to choose how you're going to\nfeel in any circumstance also how you're\ngoing to feel based off of what somebody\nsays to you and i'm not saying to go out\nand just start cussing directly at\npeople that's not what i'm saying any\nsort of way but what i am saying is if\nyou feel like your authentic self cusses\nor your authentic self doesn't wear\nblack anymore in black and white even\nyou've been you know dumbing down your\ncolors and you just want to wear bright\nflashy colors and you want to be more\nextravagant than you ever have and\nthat's actually your true self step into\nthat true version of yourself are people\nnot going to like it absolutely when you\nstep into true authentic version of\nyourself there's gonna be people that\nare offended by it because they are\nstuck in programs that they can't get\nthemselves out of and seeing you at your\nhighest version of yourself is going to\noffend them in some sort of way because\nyou are the perfect example of what they\nwish that they could be but their lack\nof freedom in their own mind is holding\nthem from stopping stopping them and\nholding them back from stepping into\nthat version of it so you have to\nrealize that that's going to happen\nyou're going to get some haters but most\npeople are going to love you that's the\nbeautiful thing about it there's a small\nsmall small percentage of haters that\nlive out there but you have to learn who\nyou truly authentically are so who are\nyou like what does the authentic you\nlook like have you ever asked yourself\nthat question have you ever sat down and\nsaid what is the true authentic version\nof rob look like what does a true\nauthentic version of you look like what\ndoes it look like are you the same\nperson in front of everybody or do you\nact a certain way in front of your\nfriends and then you act a certain way\nin front of your family and then you act\na certain way in front of your mom and\nit's all different because that's just a\nmass that you're putting on and\npretending to be somebody else if you're\nacting a certain way in front of your\nfriends and then you get in front of\nyour mom and you act completely\ndifferent that's a construct that you\nhave to abide by and anytime you set up\na new construct of this is who i truly\nam but this is how i have to act at\nschool this is how i have to act at work\nthis is how i have to act this is why i\nhad to quit a job and i can't work for\nanybody else because i'm highly\noffensive i guess if i'm discussing and\nbeing the way that i am right it's not\nallowed but if you if you have to be a\ncertain way in front of your friends and\nthen in front of your mom and in front\nof work and then in front of your\nsignificant other it's\nit's tiring and the reason why it's\ntiring is because it's like a new\nconstruct is opened up with each person\nthat you have to be different in front\nof and it's like opening up your\ncomputer and going to safari or chrome\nand opening up a thousand different tabs\neventually the computer is going to\nstart running way slower because you\nhave so many tabs open you have so many\ntabs open and so many constructs that\nyou have to be\nquote unquote have to be\nfor other people when you're just truly\nauthentically who you are\nyou don't have to worry about any tabs\nbeing open because that's just you you\nhave a standard operating procedure it\nis you maybe you cuss maybe you're\nflamboyant maybe you wear crazy colors\nmaybe you have haircut that's different\nmaybe you have purple hair maybe you\nhave pink hair whatever is truly\nauthentically the version of you is the\none i want you to find so what does that\nlook like do you like to dance around do\nyou like to be louder do you like to\ncuss do you like to wear colors do you\nlike to act a certain way as long as\nit's not offending anybody else or i'm\nnot offending because it's gonna offend\nas long as you're not hurting anybody\nelse\nstep into it\nbe that person step into your true\nauthentic self will people enjoy it yes\nyou're going to find that you will\nactually start to light other people up\nby being this way once again there will\nbe people who don't like it doesn't\nmatter you won't be everybody's cup of\ntea but you stepping up and being your\nweird\ntrue authentic version of yourself is\ngoing to\nwake people up from the programs that\nthey've been in\nand go oh\nyeah\ni i do like to be a little bit crazier\nthat person's actually waking something\nup inside of me they're funny they're\nfun i like to be more funny and fun you\nknow what i've been kind of dull this\npast week maybe i should be more funny\nand fun maybe i should wake up and just\nhave more fun with each moment that i\nhave you know what i like that person's\nshoes those bright neon shoes i've been\nwearing such ugly shoes the past few\nyears like i feel like i don't normally\nwear shoes like this i used to wear\nbright colored shoes screw it i'm gonna\ngo buy i'm gonna go on amazon right now\nand find some bright colored shoes you\nstart to wake people up\n[Music]\nand it's it's like mary williamson said\nit's not our it's not our our darkness\nthat scares us the most it's our light\nfrom stepping into our true authentic\nversion of ourselves because we're\nafraid you know it's the the brightest\nlight\ngets the most arrows you know if you're\nif we go back to hundreds or thousands\nof years ago\nif you're walking around and you have\nthe brightest light in the middle of the\nnight you're gonna get the most arrows\nif you walk into the wrong territory so\nwe we dim our lights for other people\nthinking that we're going to you know\nstepping into our truest version of\nitself is going to offend other people\nor hurt other people it won't hurt\nanybody it will wake most people up and\nyou have to realize that you're once\nagain i'm going to say it over and over\nagain you're not going to be everybody's\ncup of tea and that's completely fine\nyou don't need to be everybody's cup of\ntea\nbut the majority of people are going to\nlove you and you know if you have a\npodcast like i do and you haven't been\nyour true authentic self step into what\nthat true authentic version of yourself\nis be the true authentic version of\nyourself you know if you're if you're\nyou know holding back from being a\ncertain way and your true authentic self\nis the other way that you need to be how\ncan you start stepping into that how can\nyou go through a discovery process of\ngoing who am i what am i what do i love\ni'm gonna bring out my true authentic\nversion of myself in everything that i\ndo because we want to fit in\nit's programmed into us\nwe're tribal beings\nbut there's no reason to fit in anymore\nlike we want to fit in just because it\nused to keep us alive thousands of years\nago when we were in a tribe you didn't\nwant to stand out because if you stood\nout you could possibly be kicked out of\nthe tribe now you're not going to be\nkicked out of a tribe so it's programmed\ninto you\nyou're designed to be different you're\ndesigned to be the owner your own\nperfect authentic version of yourself\nwhat does that look like and it's like\njim carrey says you don't need your need\nto be accepted in this world will make\nyou invisible right you don't want to be\ninvisible i know you don't you want to\nbe your true authentic version of\nyourself you just might need to\nrediscover who the that true authentic\nversion of yourself is do you know who\nit is\ndo you know who it is do you need to\njournal through do you start thinking\nabout it and are you being somebody\ndifferent than you truly are\n[Music]\nmy hope for you is that you find out who\nyou truly are and you have the courage\nto step into it because once you do that\nlife becomes a lot more fun becomes a\nwhole hell of a lot easier as well so\nstep into that version of yourself\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to
