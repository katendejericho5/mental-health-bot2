    "transcript": "if it's really important to you'll\nfigure it out but if you're stopping\nyourself immediately right now going oh\nyeah but what if you've already taken\nyourself out of the game\ntoday\nwe're going to talk about how to\ncompletely change your life in just six\nmonths\nand this is for anybody who wants to\nchange their life drastically\nand this could be if you are unemployed\nand you want to be able to figure out a\nway to finally start making money and to\nbe able to change your life this could\nbe if you are employed and you've bid at\na job for a while and you're just ready\nto create your own job do whatever it is\nthat you want with your own life no\nmatter which situation that you're in\nthis is for you i'm going to talk to you\nabout how you can change your life in\nsix months if you have a family if you\ndon't have a family if you have a job if\nyou don't have a job this relates to\nevery single person if you want to make\nmassive changes in your life\nand the reason why i say this is because\nsomeone that i'm close to\ntheir father uh actually just got fired\nfrom a job that he was at for 20 years\nhe was at a job for 20\nyears and they had to let him go for\nbudget reasons and one of the things\nthat drives me the most crazy is that\npeople think that working for somebody\nelse and getting a salary is secure work\nfor those you guys are just listening to\npodcasts you can't see me i'm air\nquoting secure because there's nothing\nsecure about working for somebody else\nthe only time it's secure is when your\nown you are your own boss you can't fire\nyourself whenever you're at the mercy of\nsomeone else there's no security there\nso today we're going to be talking about\nhow to completely change your life in\nsix months and step number one is to\n[ __ ] disappear\nthat's correct disappear completely\ngo off the map lock yourself in your\nhouse whenever you're not at work or\nwhenever you're\nawake if you're not don't have a job\ndisappear\ndon't see anybody that you've seen\nconsistently throughout the days\nthroughout the weeks whatever it is\ndisappear for six months and i'm gonna\ngive you the steps of what this is going\nto look like but the most important part\nof it is to disappear because you can do\nanything for six months and we're\ntalking about a full\nlife reset so let's talk about what this\nis going to look like the first thing i\nwant you to do is i want you to get very\nclear\non what it is that you want in this life\none of the main issues that i see with\npeople and i've coached tens of\nthousands of people tens of thousands of\npeople have sent me emails or facebook\nmessages or instagram messages or\nthey've gone through my courses or\nthey've gone through one-on-one with me\nwhatever it is one of the biggest things\nthat i see it's a problem of holding\npeople back is they just don't know what\nthey want so when i say you've got to\nbecome very very very very very clear\nwhat is that you want what do you want\nif you were to look into your future\nfive years from today 10 years from\ntoday what do you want what do you want\nyour life to be what do you want your\nfamily to look like what do you want\nyour bank account to look like what kind\nof business do you want to be running\nyou've got to become very clear i've\ntold you this story before on the\npodcast but when i first had my coaching\nbusiness i also had an amazon business\nthat was making way more money than my\ncoaching business was but i asked myself\nif i fast forward five years from today\ndo i want to be known as the guy who's\nteaching you know who's selling stuff on\namazon or do i want to be known as the\nguy who's coaching people and helping\nthem improve their lives that became\nvery clear for me i want to be the one\nthat's coaching people helping people\nchange their lives that was just what i\nwas passionate about selling on amazon\nthere's nothing wrong with it it just\nwasn't my passion\nso i fast forwarded my life\nand then i said okay what do i want from\nhere\nhere's a really easy way to do this it's\ncalled future pacing okay so if it's 20\n21 right now\nand let's say that you look and you say\ni want 10 million dollars in my bank\naccount and i want to have this this\nthis this this five years from today\nthen you're gonna go it is\n2026. i have 10 million dollars in my\nbank account i do and i have all of\nthese things all the things you list out\nthat you want and life and the happiness\nand the joy this is what i did to do it\nand i want you to write a story\nas if it's already happened\nit's called future pacing you go into\nthis future that you want and you\nactually write the future out and how\nyou created that future and the thing\nthat you have to do is you have to\nbecome very clear because the more clear\nthat you are the easier it is to\nvisualize this future that you want to\ncreate and you're going to visualize it\nand you're going to look at your goals\nevery single day every single morning\nand you're going to visualize them\nyou're going to look at them you're\ngoing to read them you're going to write\nthem down and you're going to get more\nclear every single morning of these six\nmonths\nand then what i want you to do in these\nsix months is i want you to learn\none high income skill\ni

better\nlearn to get better mess up a lot mess\nup a lot mess up a lot is then what\nyou're going to do is you're going to\nfigure out a way to take that skill take\nthat very\nniche knowledge skill and turn it into a\nbusiness and\ndepending on what it is that you want to\ndo there's tons of people have courses\nto teach you how to run a shopify store\nto run an amazon business or to get\nbetter

high income skill and\ncompletely change your life with it the\nsecond thing that you're going to do now\nthat you know what you want now that\nyou've figured out what high income\nskill you're going to get now you got to\nmake a plan\nof how you're going to get there so if\nyou say okay in five years i want to be\nworth this amount of money 10 years i\nwant to be worth this amount of money i\nwant to do it by opening a\nluxury shopify store in etsy store for\nfaux leather jackets i don't know\nsomething like that well then now i\nfigured out what it is i need to create\na plan okay i'm probably gonna have to\nlearn from somebody either i'm gonna\nhave to pay them to coach me or i'm\ngonna have to get some sort of course\ni'm gonna have to go onto youtube and\nfigure it out and what you do is you\nfigure out what it is that you need to\ndo now if you have a full-time job then\nyou know when you go home this is what\nyou're doing you're going to lock it\ndown you're not going to go out and\nparty you're not going to see your\nfriends and that's fine and i'm going to\ntell you how to work with your friends\nand work with your family and work with\neverybody\nif you have children you know obviously\nyou've got to take care of your children\nbut we're talking about taking time to\nactually really lock down whatever that\nmeans for you and people can always use\ntheir family as an excuse but literally\ni had somebody who just joined and for\nme and just learned how to grow a\ncoaching business she grew a coaching\nbusiness she's got four she's a single\nmother of four she made sixteen thousand\ndollars last week you can use your\nfamily as an excuse if you want to or\nyou can use them as the reason why you\nsucceed people like to use their family\nand their children as reasons why\nthey're not succeeding\nin reality you need to flip that and\nmake them the reason why you are going\nto succeed so you've got to figure out a\nvery clear plan of exactly what you're\ngoing to do exactly what you're going to\ncreate and the business the money that\nyou want the happiness the joy whatever\nit is you're trying to create in the\nnext five to 10 years get very clear on\nwhat it is that you want and then get\nvery clear on the roadmap and the plan\nto get there here's what messes a lot of\npeople up they expect that they need to\ncome up with the perfect plan that will\nnever change your plan is going to\nchange 500 times in the next 10 years\nthat's okay it's the same way as if\nyou're going to take a really long road\ntrip there's going to be some detours\nthere's no way that the original plane\nto get there is just going to be perfect\nthere's going to be detours no matter\nwhat you can figure it out\nyou can figure out what it is you need\nto do\nthe thing about it\nis that you know what you need to do to\ncreate the life that you want you know\nwhat you need to do to be successful be\nhappy to whatever it is that you're\ntrying to create you know the problem is\nyou're just not doing it everybody knows\nwhat they need to do to become wealthy\nor happier successful or more peaceful\nwe know what we need to do we're just\nnot doing it that's the problem so stop\nacting like you don't know you've just\ngot to start doing it come up with a\nplan and realize that that plan is going\nto shift and move along the way\nthat's what's going to happen it's going\nto shift and move along the way so\nthat's step number two is come up with a\nplan step number three is what i told\nyou in the very beginning disappear\nyou're gone poof\nnever to be seen again for the next six\nmonths\nthat's what you're going to do\nwhy because this is your time to\ncompletely rewire and to change your\nlife and the people who really love you\nwill be fine with you doing this one of\nthe main resistance of people doing this\nis they think oh my gosh my mom's going\nto be so mad you know my uh my friends\nare going to be so mad usually we hang\nout we watch football on sundays if it's\nreally important to you you'll figure it\nout if it's not important to you you\nmake some excuses as to why you're not\ndoing it that's the truth of the matter\ntell everyone that you know that you're\ngoing on a money-making vacation you're\ndisappearing that's just the way it's\ngoing to go you're going to disappear\nfor six months just let them know if\nthey get mad about it they were never a\ntrue friend in the first place a couple\nweeks ago i did an episode on kobe\nbryant and michael jordan what it takes\nto be great i remember watching the\nvideo on kobe bryant talking about how\nwhen he first got into the nba he was\nonly 18 years old went straight from\nhigh school straight to the nba and he\ntold all of his friends and all of his\nfamily i'm not going to hang out with\nyou for the next year and the person\nthat was interviewing him was like well\ndidn't they get mad he's like some of\nthem got mad but those aren't my truth\nthose are that's not the true people who\nlove me if you love me you know how\nimportant basketball is to me you know\nhow important is for me to bring out my\ntrue potential in this very first year\nhow important it is we can hang out\nafter year one\nbut year one i've gotta lock in i've\ngotta change myself i've got to improve\nmy skills because this is the most\nimportant year of my life he said\neveryone that loved him was okay with it\nso you've got to be upfront be like hey\ni can't hang out i can't go to parties i\ncan't watch football on sundays stop\ndoing anything that doesn't get you\ncloser to your goal stop doing anything\nthat doesn't get you close to your goal\ni promise you that everything will be\nexactly the same six months from today\nas it is today\nbesides your own life everyone's gonna\nbe acting the same they're gonna be\ntalking and saying they're gonna be\nthinking the same i remember when i left\nin 2012 i went on a backpacking trip for\nfor three months by myself and then in\n2017 i went on a six-month trip with my\ngirlfriend what was so funny is that you\nleave and you're like i've been gone for\nso long i bet everything's gonna be so\ndifferent you come back your friends are\nstill exactly the same they're still\nworking the same job they're still\nacting the same your family is still the\nsame nothing has changed everything is\nexactly the same now for those of you\nguys that have families you still got to\ntake care of your kids you still got to\nfeed them we get it but can you lock\nyourself outside of anything that isn't\nthe family the kids everything that\nneeds to be done can you lock yourself\noutside of it because your life is going\nto improve dramatically and their life\nis going to improve dramatically as well\nyou can do anything for six months\ndisappearing for six months is not that\nbig of a deal and you've got to ask\nyourself this question as you're going\nthrough these six months if you're\nreally serious about this is something\nthat you want to do you've got to\nconstantly ask yourself this question\nevery single day multiple times a day is\nwhat i'm doing right now getting me\ncloser to or further from my goal is\nwhat i'm doing right now getting me\ncloser to having a million dollar a year\nshopify and etsy faux leather jacket\ncompany that makes me profiting 300 000\na year from that million\nokay it's not i'm going to stop doing it\nis what i'm doing right now getting\ncloser to or further from my goals and\nyou start working at this and you\ndevelop what we're talking about is\ndeveloping the foundation of a brand new\nlife developing the foundation of a\nbrand new skill set developing the\nfoundation of a brand new business and\nyou're not going to be amazing at the\nbeginning but you're going to get better\nand you're going to get better and\nyou're going to get better and what\nyou're doing is you're basically pouring\nthe foundation for this brand new life\nthis brand new business you're pouring\nthe foundation\nand then after these six months you're\nbasically you know you're in the six\nmonths you're starting to build the\nbricks and you're putting the bricks\ndown but then what you're also gonna be\ndoing is continuing to build it after\nthe six months after the six months you\ncan go back and watch football with your\nboys on sundays you can watch saturday\nyou know\nncaa football if you want to you can do\nall of those things but what i'm telling\nyou is if you if it's truly important to\nyou you'll lock it down for a little\nwhile you'll figure out how to make it\nwork you'll figure out how to make it\nwork with your business to figure out\nhow to make it work with your family\nfigure out how to make it work with your\nfriends you'll figure out how to work\nmake it work with every single aspect of\nyour business but if you're stopping\nyourself immediately right now going oh\nyeah but what if you've already taken\nyourself out of the game so if you fully\nwant to change your life\ndisappear\nfor six months completely rewire\nyourself rewire your mindset rewire your\nbusiness rewire your your bank account\nrewire your\nhappiness your joy your peace all of\nthose things and in six months you'll\ncome back a different person and inspire\nall of the people\naround you to start changing themselves\nas well that is how you change your life\nis by disappearing for six months\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well do i\nbelieve in
