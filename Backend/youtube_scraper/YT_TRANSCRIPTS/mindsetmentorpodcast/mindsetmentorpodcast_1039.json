    "transcript": "look around you and look at your entire\nlife look at everything that you have\nyou have already gotten the maximum that\nyou can\ninside of your comfort zone\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\ngrow through suffering how to grow\nthrough trauma how to grow through some\nof the hardest things that have ever\nhappened to you in your life and how\nbehind all of those things is some\nhidden benefit whether you found the\nbenefit or not there's always some\nhidden benefit that we need to search\nfor that will allow us to grow to get\nbetter to share our story and to help\nothers grow from it as well i'm going to\ntalk about suffering and what\nsuffering actually is i'm going to talk\nabout how to use it to get through life\nand i'm going to be going through a\nconcept that's called applied suffering\nwhich is basically applying suffering to\nforce growth if you want to so when you\nhear the word suffering suffering can\nhave a really bad connotation right\nnobody wants to suffer i don't\nnecessarily want to suffer\nbut there's a difference between pain\nversus suffering that we need to clear\nup before we dive any deeper so pain\nis inevitable you're going to have pain\nthroughout your life it's going to\nhappen i don't know of anybody who's\ngone through their life and not had some\nform of pain you can't go through this\nlife without some scarring that happens\nsuffering on the other hand is optional\nso pain is inevitable but suffering is\noptional so let's talk about how to use\nyour suffering to grow the beautiful\nthing about pain is that pain is the\nstimulus for your brain or your body to\nmake a change i'll give you a great\nexample let's say that i'm walking\noutside it's really hot in the summer\nright now and i'm walking barefoot\nthrough\na giant\nsuper large really brand new paved\nparking lot and i'm barefoot and i get\nabout 50 feet in there and i can feel my\nfeet on fire that pain\nis a stimulus to go to my brain to say\nhey\nrob\nget off of the hot cement and i've gotta\nrun off of it that pain is a stimulus to\nmove if you've ever put your hand on a\nhot stove it doesn't feel good but that\npain is a stimulus to change pain\nis always going to happen and it's\nalways a stimulus to say hey this is\nsomething that you should avoid hey this\nis something you should do for do\ndifferently pain is a teacher that's the\nbeautiful thing about it and it is\nforcing you to move it is forcing you to\nchange is forcing you to take action if\nyou're feeling pain in your body in your\nlife in your circumstances that is the\nuniverse saying hey you\nstop doing what you're doing\nyou're doing something wrong do\nsomething differently do something that\nyou love stop working this job that you\nhate stop eating that food work out more\nwhatever the pain that you're feeling is\nit is the universe telling you that you\nneed to do something differently think\nabout this for a second how does a\nmuscle grow\nif you want a muscle to grow you can't\njust go in and lift the same weight you\ncan't not lift weights you've got to\nhave applied suffering throughout it\nyou've got to actually hurt the muscle\nin order for the muscle to grow we have\na trainer that comes over my house and\nshe beat the crap out of me two days ago\nand literally my bicep\nhurt so bad a couple nights ago i woke\nup in the middle of the night because my\nbicep hurts so much it was through that\napplied suffering my muscle is going to\ngrow it does not feel good it's not\nsomething that i would love to do i'd\nrather sit on the couch and eat candy\nthat would be much nicer but through the\napplied suffering my body will grow my\nbody will change how does a plant grow a\nplant has to do the exact same thing it\nstarts off as a seed it has to break out\nof the seed to break out of the shell\nthat it has and it's got to go through\napplied suffering it's got to push\nitself through\nthe soil it's got to put its roots down\nthat's all not easy to do\nand then it becomes easier how does a\nlobster grow well i've done episodes on\nthis in the past but a lobster is a\nreally soft animal that lives inside of\na hard shell that shell doesn't grow\nwith the animal that shell is the size\nit is and it will stay that size so it's\ncalled the exoskeleton so when a lobster\nis starting to grow the soft animal\nthat's on the inside of it\nactually starts to come up to the edge\nand it starts to get really\nuncomfortable it starts to hurt there\nstarts to be pain and that lobster\nliterally has to break its own shell its\nown exoskeleton\nand it's got to go through applied\nsuffering and some pain in order to\nbreak that shell in order for it to get\nit off of it so that it can go for\nand grow a new one so if you look at the\nworld if you look at the universe if you\nlook at life\npain\nis something that pops up to show you\nthat you need to change that's the\nuniverse saying hey this is something\nyou need to change you can use this\nthrough applied suffering and some\npeople don't usually listen to the the\npain that pops up they just think oh\ni've got back pain oh i've got you know\nstomach pain oh i've got this pain oh i\ndon't feel very good oh i kind of feel\nanxious thoughts it's the universe\nspeaking to you and saying hey you need\nto make some changes and i always say\nthe universe speaks to you in a whisper\nand if you don't listen it's going to\neventually speak to you in a slap it's\nthe the feeling of the feather\nor after the feather it is the brick and\nthen after break it is the truck the\nuniversal common will kind of\nwhisper to you you got to be quiet it'll\nkind of take a feather and tickle you\nwith a feather hey you need to you need\nto stop doing this you need to you need\nto move you need to do something\ndifferent you need to quit this job you\nneed to get out of this relationship\nwith this person and you don't listen\nlong enough\nthen instead of a feather it's going to\ncome up with a brick and it's going to\nhit you with a brick something's gonna\nhappen who knows what it is but it's\ngonna be some form of a break it's gonna\nbe much more\nmuch more painful than the feather is\nand then if you don't listen for even\nlonger another year two years three\nyears five years\nthen the truck comes and it's like\ngetting hit by a truck and so it's\nknowing that these are all going to come\nup and all of these come up for your\ngrowth here's the problem with pain and\ndiscomfort and it's not even a problem\nwith pain and discomfort it's a problem\nwith the way that we view pain and\ndiscomfort people fear discomfort\npeople try to avoid discomfort they try\nto get away from it at all costs because\nthere's a part of our brain the amygdala\nthat makes us think that if we are in\ndiscomfort that we're in danger we\nshould avoid it at all costs because\nthere's something wrong the beautiful\nthing about discomfort is it's showing\nyou\nwhere you need to grow it's showing you\nwhere you're not capable yet it's\nshowing you the edge of your comfort\nzone the word discomfort implies that in\nthe opposite of the discomfort is your\ncomfort zone what's the opposite of\ndiscomfort well being in your comfort\nzone discomfort the opposite of it\ncomfort look around you and look at your\nentire life look at everything that you\nhave\nall that you've gotten\neverything that's around you everything\ngood everything bad everything that's\nindifferent you have already gotten the\nmaximum that you can\ninside of your comfort zone so if you've\nbeen stuck in your comfort zone for a\nyear\ntwo years three years five years ten\nyears and you look around you you\nrealize that you've probably had the\nsame things the same type of life for\nthe same amount of time it should be\nstuck inside of your comfort zone you\nhave already accomplished the maximum\nthat you can\ninside of your comfort zone so what does\nthat mean\ndamn i need to push myself outside of my\ncomfort zone and b\ndiscomfort i don't i don't know what the\nthe right word would be right there i've\ngot to feel the discomfort and be okay\nwith it i've got to feel the fear i've\ngot to feel the pain i've got to feel\nthe applied suffering and that will make\nme grow and people stay in their comfort\nzones forever i love it i don't\nnecessarily say i love it but i love to\nsee the example of when i go to an event\nand i speak with people and i say hey\nraise your hand if you've been stuck in\nyour comfort zone for six months\npretty much everybody's hand goes up i\nsay okay keep your hand up if you've\nbeen stuck in your comfort zone for\nlonger than a year keep your hand up if\nyou've been stuck in your comfort zone\nfor two years three years five years 10\nyears\n20 years 30 years 40 years 50 years and\npeople's hands stay up they stay inside\nof their comfort zone because they they\ndon't realize they don't pay attention\nto their feelings and ask themselves\nwhat are these feelings they just listen\nto them and just immediately just go\nwith what they are so they feel the\ndiscomfort they feel the pain they feel\nthe\nthe little bit of discomfort that they\nhave and then they back away versus\ngoing okay\nlet me look at everything that's going\non in my life ask yourself this when i'm\nfeeling discomfort towards something i'm\ngonna ask myself this question is this\ngoing to kill me\nis this\nwaking up and\ngoing for a two mile run is it going to\nkill me no\nokay that's good to know next question\ncould this help me grow this could help\nme grow if i were to do this two mile\nrun it could help me grow and then\nhere's an important question\nam i safe one of the things i think that\npeople don't notice the most is that\nthat they immediately don't do what they\nneed to do\nbecause there's a part of their brain\nthat makes them think that they're\nunsafe but they've never actually\nconsciously brought the feeling up and\nsaid hey\nwhat am i feeling all right i'm kind of\nfeeling unsafe right now\nam i safe i am okay let me turn that\npart of my brain off\ngoing for a two mile run\nis not gonna kill me\nit's going to help me grow\nand i will be safe the entire time let's\nsay that you're in a sales position\nyou need to make 75 phone calls a day\nand you're sitting there going i don't\nknow if i want to make these 75 phone\ncalls ask yourself the question is it\ngoing to kill me\nno it's not going to kill me if you make\n75 phone calls would it help me grow yes\nbecause i'm pushing myself out of what i\nwant to do and it's also going to make\nmy bank account grow from making 75\nphone calls okay last question am i safe\ni am safe okay\nso the only thing that's holding me back\nthis point is me\ni can make a decision to not do it or to\ndo it but what i've done is i've taken\nthe parts of my brain that hold me back\nto try to keep me in my comfort zone and\ni've turned them down just a little bit\nso i don't have to listen to them\nanymore you've got to get out of your\ncomfort zone your comfort zone is where\nyour dreams go to die\ndiscomfort is your friend most people\ndon't think about that your comfort zone\nis where your dreams go to die\ndiscomfort is your friend you should\nseek discomfort because if you look at\nthe life that you have\ni'm guessing you're probably listening\nthis podcast episode because your my\nlife might be amazing it might be great\nbut you have this feeling\nthat you have more potential inside of\nyou right that's what you feel inside of\nyou is that you have more potential so\nif you've got this feeling of more\npotential the only way to bring it out\nis to force yourself to grow to bring it\nout which means that if i stay in my\ncomfort zone i'll never actualize or\nrealize my true potential but if i seek\ndiscomfort\nand i push myself outside of my comfort\nzone constantly i will then eventually\ngrow so comfort is not my friend\ndiscomfort\nis my friend in order to get your body\nto grow\nwhat do you have to do\nyou've got to push it you've got to put\nit through applied suffering you've got\nto do things that you don't want to do\nsometimes if you want your body to grow\nif you want bigger muscles you've got to\nbe uncomfortable what do you have to do\nyou have to push yourself you have to\nsweat\nyou have to hurt\nbut what happens your body is an amazing\npiece of machinery it comes back and\ngrows stronger that's the beautiful\nthing about it your brain and your\nmindset work exactly the same way that\nyour muscles do neuroplasticity which is\nthe act of actually changing your brain\nand building new neurological pathways\nin your brain neuroplasticity in your\nyour brain changing doesn't happen from\ndoing the same that you've been doing\nfor the past seven years\nit doesn't your brain only changes when\nyou do something different your brain\nonly changes when you change so if you\nwake up and do the same thing and go\nthrough the same routine you wake up on\nthe same side of the bed you brush your\nteeth through the same\nyou know\nhand that you always have your entire\nlife you build the same exact breakfast\nyou take the exact same way to work you\ntalk to the same people you\ndo the exact same phone calls you have\nthe same meetings you drive the same way\nhome back to work you have the same\nmicrowavable food you watch the same\nshows your life is not going to change\nat all you can't just think that you do\nthe exact same thing today that you did\nyesterday and magically life's gonna be\ndifferent no neuroplasticity and\nchanging your brain the act of changing\nyour body comes from doing what you've\nnever done before you have to seek\ndiscomfort the life that you want is on\nthe other side of your discomfort so\nwhen you think about that\nis this going to kill me\nno it's not\ncould this help me grow\nyes\nabsolutely it will am i safe and if you\ngo through those\nyou have to force yourself into doing\nwhat you need to do if you want to do\nsomething\nthat you\nhave never done before you've got to\napply some\nform of suffering into it it's gotta\nyou've gotta know that there's gonna be\nsome form of suffering but you gotta\npush yourself to do it anyways so i'm\ngonna give you an assignment\nif you choose to accept it everyone\nwho's listening right now\ni've given this assignment before i've\nmentioned this before and i love getting\nmy the stories back on instagram and\npeople always tell me about it i want\nyou to do something today\nright now that makes you completely\nuncomfortable i'll give you a couple of\nexamples that i've given people and i've\ngotten these from i think it was tim\nferriss someone said on tim ferriss's\npodcast i think it was noah kagan that\nsaid it\ngo into a coffee shop today and while\nyou're ordering coffee you're about to\norder coffee just lay down on the ground\njust do it do something that you've\nnever done before do something that\nmakes you feel completely uncomfortable\nwhy because then you start getting used\nto the feelings of uncomfort and\nrealizing that the feeling of uncomfort\ndoesn't mean potential death lay down in\na coffee shop\ndo it\ni love it when i when i when i tell\npeople to do this because then i get\nvideos and i get tagged on instagram of\npeople that are doing it they're in\ntheir stories i had a video on time of a\ngirl that was in walmart and she laid\ndown in the middle of walmart and people\ncame up to and they're like honey are\nyou okay and she's like yeah i'm fine\ni'm just hanging out right like it's\njust funny to see\nwhy not do it i got another assignment\nfor you\nask for a 20 discount the next time you\nprobably buy something\nno reason just ask for it\ni had to one time i i gave this as an\nassignment to a bunch of group of people\nthat i was coaching one girl went out\nand asked for a 20 discount and she was\nbuying an 800 bag and they gave her the\n20 discount she got 160 off no reason\nfish gave it to her\nit seems silly\nbut why not\nwhy not do the things that make you\nuncomfortable if you feel uncomfortable\nyou should get used to that feeling do\nit anyways why are you afraid of doing\nit why are you afraid to ask for a\ndiscount why are you afraid of laying on\na floor people like oh because the floor\nis dirty no it's not because the floor\nis dirty it's because it's something\nthat's your program that you're not\nsupposed to do as a child you would have\nno problem laying on the ground you've\neither been programmed that laying on\nthe floor is a wrong thing to do or\nyou've been programmed that the floor is\nso dirty that somehow you're going to\ncatch some weird thing off of the floor\nand you're going to die from it\nyou have to get used to pushing yourself\noutside your comfort zone you have to\nget used to being uncomfortable become\ncomfortable being uncomfortable that is\nthe act of applied suffering and that is\nhow you grow your mind that's how you\ngrow your body that's how you grow your\nlife and that's how you really find out\nwhat your true potential is\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well and so if\nyou're sitting and just waiting for\nthings to go back to normal i promise\nyou this you're going to be left behind\nthis is possibly the best time to be a\nhuman"
