    "transcript": "you can go from no energy to holy sh i\nhave so much energy like that simply\nbecause you're using the body the way\nthat the body is made to be used\ntoday\nwe're going to be talking about the nine\nways to naturally have more energy i'm\ngoing to give you some that are going to\nbe decently obvious but i'm going to\ngive you some tips around how to make\nthem better and i'm going to give you\nsome that are just going to be something\nyou probably never thought of before so\nthe first one as how to have more energy\nis to get some sleep now you might be\nlike well no well let's dive deeper into\nsleep uh sleep is obviously extremely\nimportant for your energy but there's a\ncouple hacks that you can definitely\nhave number one your room should be as\ndark as possible when you sleep you\nshould figure out how much sleep you\nneed for me it's about seven and a half\nto eight hours i can sleep for 13 hours\nstraight if nobody wakes me up though i\njust can sleep but if i'd go too long\nthen i don't feel good if i go too short\ni don't feel good so i've come to\nrealize that my natural time is about\nseven and a half to eight hours which is\ncommon with people right make sure your\nroom is really dark\nusually it helps if you're colder as\nwell and one of the things that that\nhelps with sleep is making sure that you\nkeep a very consistent time you go to\nbed and you wake up at the exact same\ntimes every single night every single\nmorning during the week and also during\nthe weekend so it's very important to\nkeep your circadian cycles exactly the\nsame if you want to research more about\ncircadian cycles and how to help with\nthem that is definitely one way to do it\nnow one thing that helps with that as\nwell\neverybody seems to want to wake up\nearlier it's very simple to wake up\nearly do you want to know how to do it\nyou just force yourself to wake up let's\nsay it's five o'clock and you put on the\nnight owl i went to bed at midnight all\nyou gotta do is force yourself to wake\nup at five o'clock you're gonna be more\ntired that night and you're naturally\ngonna start to fall asleep so if you\nwake up at five o'clock and five o'clock\nand five o'clock no matter what your\nbody will change its circadian cycle and\nstart to make you go to bed earlier a\nlot of people think that they're night\nowls nobody's really a night owl very\nvery few like one out of a hundred\npeople out of studies they've done and\nfound that that people are actually\nnight owls what happens is it's just the\nproblem is that people are around too\nmany screens too many screens they are\nkeeping themselves up if you were to go\nokay when the sun sets i'm gonna read a\nbook\ntry to keep yourself awake if that's\nwhat you did every single night you're\ngonna fall asleep first thing is sleep\nwhen you wake up one way that's going to\nhelp you when you break your sleep if\nyou've heard me talk about this before\nmy podcast is to walk outside you go and\nyou look at the blue in the sky because\nthe blue turns out it turns we have your\nreceptors in your eyes they tell your\nbrain to stop making melatonin and your\nbrain stops making melatonin which is\nthe thing that makes you fall asleep so\nthat you wake up earlier second thing\nthat you want to do to have more energy\nwhich goes with number one is to drink\nsome caffeine if that's something that\nyou're into now the secret is to not\ndrink caffeine within an hour of waking\nup because that's when your cortisol\nlevels are really high it's best to let\nyour cortisol levels drop and then have\ncaffeine about an hour to two hours\nafter you wake up so for those of you\nguys that have a lot of caffeine\nthis is a secret wait about an hour\nalong with caffeine is to stop drinking\ncaffeine at about noon if you really\nwant to have good sleep and have more\nenergy if you want to have a whole lot\nof energy you can stop drinking caffeine\ncompletely and eventually after about a\nmonth your body will start creating its\nown energy so caffeine is super\nimportant in this sense also what type\nof caffeine you have it's crazy i didn't\nknow there's so many different types of\nways you can get caffeine so there's\ncoffee which you could use but i'm\nstarting to drink less and less coffee\nover the past year and a half and i'm\nstarting to go more towards tea tea i\ndrink the most is called yerba mate\npeople always send me messages saying\nrob what is that tea that you talk about\nit's called yerba mate y-e-r-b-a-m-a-t-e\nyerba mate instead of dehydrating you\nlike coffee does it actually hydrates\nyou and it's got a lot more nutrients\ninside of it as well it's also got a lot\nof other stuff when i was talking with\ndr andrew huberman who is the\nneurobiologist out of stanford he told\nme he drinks because there's a lot of\nextra things that are benefits for your\nbrain of actually taking your mate\nversus coffee so tip number two\nobviously is caffeine tip number three\ntake some b12 if you want to now i'm not\na doctor any sort of way so don't listen\nto anything that i say but i take b12\nsometimes throughout the day to get\nsomething natural without having this\nmassive spike of caffeine and then a\ndrop after so b12 is something that\ndefinitely helps as well super simple\ntip number four\nstop drinking so much alcohol actually\nif you really want to help yourself out\nstop drinking alcohol period if it's\nsomething that you could do i very\nrarely drink alcohol but this is\nsomething super interesting that\nhappened over the past week last week\nwas my girlfriend's birthday we went out\na couple times and i didn't even get\ndrunk at all i just had a couple glasses\nof wine and i wear this thing on my\nwrist when i go to sleep it's called\nduring the day mostly throughout the\nentire day and then also when i sleep\nit's called a whoop and it literally\ntracks your body the entire day and it\ntracks your recovery as well something\nreally crazy happened my recovery from\nhaving two glasses of wine completely\nplummeted even though i got more sleep\nthree of the nights we went out and we\nhad a couple glass of wine like her\nfriends were in town and then we went to\nsan antonio where she's from and then i\nhad two glasses of wine there\nmy recovery during sleep got destroyed\nfrom two glasses of wine alcohol stays\nin your system for up to 80 hours that's\nover three days it will affect you and\nso i always knew this but i was like i'm\ngonna have a couple glasses of wine no\nbig deal\nso on the days that i did not the four\nnights that i did not drink the two\nglass of of wine my recovery was around\n90 to 94\nwhich means that i woke up and i had\nenergy i woke up and i felt good i woke\nup and i immediately was like cool i can\nwork out no big deal what happened was\nthen i looked at my whoop and i saw that\nevery day that i drank the the night\nthat i drank my sleep was around a 31 to\n35\nwhich means that i didn't feel anywhere\nnear 100 those days so if you want to\nhave more energy don't go home and drink\na beer don't go home and have a glass of\nwine for some of you guys like but hold\non glasses of wines are actually good\nfor your heart well just so you know you\ncan go back and listen to my interview\nthat i did with dr david sinclair who\nwas the head of longevity at harvard and\nhe actually says that i think it's\nresveratrol i think is what it's called\nthe antioxidant that they found that's\ninside of wine red wine that they did a\nwhole article and said oh my gosh this\nis so good for you they've actually\nfound it's very small amounts and it\ndoesn't really do anything for you that\nwas just people over promoting that wine\nis good for you it's not bad bad bad for\nyou if you're going to drink just one\nglass of wine but what you have to rush\nis this the thing about alcohol is that\nit will help you fall asleep easier but\nit will make your sleep worse and the\nreason why is because it changes your\nrespiratory rate and it also changes\nyour heart rate the other thing that was\ninteresting when i checked my recovery\nevery single night that i drank my\nnormal resting heart rate is about 50 to\n55 beats per minute when i'm sleeping it\nwas literally up to 60 to 70 beats per\nminute just when i was sleeping after\nhaving alcohol which means my heart rate\nwent up 20 to 30 percent while i was\nsleeping it's not a good thing to have\nyour heart rate be up while you're\nsleeping so\nif you want to have more energy stop\nhaving a glass of alcohol stop having a\nglass of wine stop having a drink when\nyou come home stop having beer it is\ndestroying your sleep as well number\nfive put some music in your house i'm\nreally big if you ever come over my\nhouse i'm really big on always playing\nmusic there's always energy and\nvibration going through my house at all\npoints in time for me and i don't know\nabout you guys like i have favorite\nsongs that just feel like they give me\nenergy and so one of the hacks that i\nfind with a lot of people\nthat make it super simple is just start\nputting on music that you like don't\neven put just background music put on\nmusic that you like throughout your\nhouse while you're driving while you're\nat work wherever you can listen to music\nif you have favorite songs start putting\nthose favorite songs on have the\nvibrations go through your house we're\nvibratory beings we're constantly\nvibrating at all points in time that's\njust what we do if you look at us we\nlook like we're solid beings but really\nwhat we are is we're just a vibrating\npiece of mass with 70 trillion cells\nthat are constantly moving and vibrating\nas well and so when you have energy and\nmovement and music going through a room\nyour body's gonna feel it your body's\ngonna hear it you're gonna start singing\nalong with it you're gonna start moving\nyour body a little bit more so a thing\nthat i recommend is to put music on\nwhenever you can have music on\nespecially if you can put on your\nfavorite music tip number six\ntry something called breath work there\nare many many different types of breath\nwork but this is something that we do\nwith our team every single morning we\nhave a team meeting every single morning\nall of all hands on on deck everybody\nthat's on our team comes in and we do\nbreath work every single morning\nguaranteed the very first thing that we\ndo there's multiple different types of\nbreath work you can do i'll give you\nthree of them that i recommend we've\ndone all three of them with my team they\nenjoy all of them at different times one\nof them is called breath of fire breath\nof fire is where you breathe in\nand breathe out of your nose\nas fast as you can\nfor as long as you can and when you\ndon't think you can do any more you just\nkeep doing it i like to put on music of\ncourse like i said and i'll do breath of\nfire so it's literally\nand i'll do it sometimes you get some\nsnot flying out of your nose no big deal\nthat's just part of the process that\nwill literally start to invigorate your\nbody that's breath of fire another one\nthat we do is called wim hof so wim hof\nbut we also do something a little bit\nseparate another thing that i learned\nfrom wim hof so it's 30 deep breaths in\nbut then on the 30th breath you ready\nhere's a secret you breathe in as much\nyou possibly can\nhold at the top and then force yourself\nto do as many push-ups as you possibly\ncan\nbefore breathing again this is just\nsomething that i do this is not a\nrecommendation i don't need you guys\npassing out and then saying oh my god i\nheard this guy talk about this thing\nthis is what i do if you want to try it\nyou can try what i have found and here's\nwhat's crazy is if i want to just do\npush-ups right now i can do about 40\npush-ups in a row here's what's crazy if\ni want to do the breathing exercise and\nthen do my push-ups i can get about 60\nsometimes even more\nit without ever breathing again and the\nreason why is because i'm over\noxygenating my body which is what your\nbody needs and also your muscles need a\nlot of oxygen so i'm over oxygenating my\nbody and i'm doing these push-ups i'm\ndoing it to music and i'm pumping them\nout and i have literally a song that we\nlisten to every single morning it's\ncalled strobe by dead mouse we put it on\nwe just crank it out and we just do the\npush-up we do the breathing then we do\nthe push-ups every single time\nthat's the very first way that i start\nmy morning\nbefore i ever have any coffee any of\nthat stuff and i can literally feel my\nbody light up with energy and i feel\ncompletely different if i'm ever feeling\ndrained throughout the day i do one of\nthese as well and the third one i'm\ngoing to tell you i don't know what\nthey're called i just call them skis\nthat's what i call them because it\nliterally looks like so for those of you\nguys that are watching video for those\nof you guys that aren't watching video\nlisten on a podcast breathe in through\nyour nose breathe out through your mouth\nbreathe in through your nose breathe out\nthrough your mouth and when you breathe\nin your hands go above your head\nwhen you breathe out your hands go below\ndown to your waist it's best to stand up\nand it's\nand you literally use your entire body\nas if you're skiing down a mountain and\nyou're putting your your hands are going\nup you're going down your hands are\ngoing up going down when you breathe in\nyour hands go up when you breathe out\nyour your hands go down do this for two\nto three minutes straight\nwith music blaring as well you can go\nfrom no energy to holy sh i have so much\nenergy like that\nsimply because you're using the body the\nway that the body is made to be used\nsuper simple so what was that again\nbreath of fire\nor wim\nhof\nor the skis\nall of them are different i use each of\nthem depending on what i'm doing try it\nout i promise you at some point in time\nyou're going to get a ton of energy from\nit\nsee if it works see if it works if\nyou're on your phone chilling on the\ncouch scrolling through instagram you're\nlike oh my gosh i got to get up and do\nthis thing but i don't really feel like\ndoing this thing force your body to do\nbreath of fire or to do the push-ups\nwith the breath hold or to do the skis\nput on some music and i guarantee you\nit'll just rush energy into your body\ntip number seven get outside take your\nshoes off put your feet on the ground\nand go outside in the sun for me every\nsingle morning the very first thing that\ni do because we have a puppy he likes to\npee all over the place so i gotta get\nhim outside as soon as we wake up in the\nmorning first thing i do is i put some\nshorts on i keep my my shirt off and i\nwalk outside barefoot and i keep my feet\nin the grass as long as i possibly can\nand get as much sun on my body as i\npossibly can and like i told you i look\nup at the sky the blue in the sky and i\ntry to get all of the reasons why i\nshould be awake for my body to go oh\nyeah this is the time when rob should be\nawake the sun is now coming up he's\noutside his feet are on the grass he's\ngetting sun on his skin he's looking at\nthe blue inside so that means that the\nsky is you know obviously the sun is up\nwe should stop making melatonin i'm\ntrying to give my body all of the\nreasons why i'm supposed to be up right\nnow get some sun on your skin also with\nall of the stuff that's been happening\nwith viruses and everything\nvitamin d which is what you get from the\nsun is one of the things that kills the\nviruses the quickest according to\neverybody is the people who have a lot\nof trouble with it and tend to have\nvitamin d deficiencies and most people\nhave vitamin d deficiencies get outside\nin the sun more get as much of your skin\nto be able to\nas much sun to be able on your skin as\npossible and i guarantee it'll help you\nnumber eight exercise in the morning it\nis a fact that the more that you\nexercise your body will start to create\nmore energy you know i look at my one of\nmy friends my friend amy when she lived\nhere she doesn't live here anymore when\nshe lived here in austin she was doing\nlike god she was doing like five four to\nfive cycling classes every single day\nand everyone was like how does she have\nso much freaking energy she has so much\nenergy not because she was just blessed\nwith energy she must she has so much\nenergy because she has literally for\nyears told her body this is what we do\nthat's what we do this what we do and so\nwhen she doesn't go and do four cycling\nclasses she has a day off of course\nshe's got so much energy of course she\ncan keep going first she wants to party\nuntil late night because her body knows\nit needs to create lots of energy if\nyou've been in a cycle of not working\nout not forcing your body to move your\nbody's learned that\nyou can make it relearn and make it\nstart to create more energy so work out\nin the morning or at least even if it's\nnot in the morning just work out at some\npoint in time and force your body to\nlearn it needs to create more energy\nyour body is an amazing adaptive piece\nof machinery force it to adapt the way\nthat you want it to adapt last but not\nleast is to drink more water and\npreferably drink spring water like this\nif you're looking drink spring water\ndoesn't have to go through a filter it's\ncoming straight from the earth it's also\nin a plastic or not a plastic bottle in\na glass bottle you can do your own\nresearch on why plastic isn't good for\nyou and how plastic raises your estrogen\nwhether you're male or female but if it\ncomes from a glass bottle usually ends\nup being a lot better for you as well if\nit's spring water ends up being a lot\nbetter for you as well but just\nregardless just drink more water it's\nmind-blowing to me how little water\npeople drink considering that your body\nis 60 to 70 percent water one of the\nthings that they found is that most\npeople when they're tired the very first\nthing you should check is actually if\nyou're dehydrated because a lot of times\nthe first thing to go down as soon as\nyou're dehydrated is your energy your\nbody runs off of water if you don't feel\nlike you have energy maybe you should\nsee if you got enough water drink a lot\nmore water and your body will actually\nstart to filter out all the toxins in\nthe same time it'll run more efficiently\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well uh-oh i'm\nabout to offend a whole lot of people\nhere we go"
