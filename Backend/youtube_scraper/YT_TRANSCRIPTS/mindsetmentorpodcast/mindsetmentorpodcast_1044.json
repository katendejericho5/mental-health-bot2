    "transcript": "because life success happiness joy peace\nall of those things they're not\ndifficult we make them difficult\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to talk about the\nseven tips to be more disciplined\nbecause if you can be more disciplined\nwith what you have and everything that's\naround you in your life the more that\nyou can get yourself to do what needs to\nbe done and when you do what needs to be\ndone you create the life that you want\nso let's talk about discipline before we\ndive into it so\nthe easiest way to think of it where\nwhen you look at discipline what exactly\nis discipline because what discipline\nmeans to me\nmight be different than what it means to\nyou i guess it could be a little bit\ndepending on who the person is you can\nsee discipline\nas a bad connotation right like if a\nchild is bad you discipline that child\nthat's a bad connotation for discipline\nbut for me\ni don't see it as a bad connotation i\nsee it as a prerequisite to get the life\nthat i want\nsimply put the way that i see it is\nbeing able to take action even when you\ndon't feel like it that's it just take\naction regardless of how you feel\nthat's it there's there's nothing else\nto it it's feeling the resistance of\nyour mind of your body of your life of\nyour external circumstances internal\ncircumstances whatever it is it's\nfeeling that resistance of i don't want\nto do this\nbut then leaning into it and doing it\nanyways doing it regardless of how you\nfeel\nyou know it's the it's it's following\nwhat the mind tells it to do versus the\nbody because sometimes the body's like\nwell i'm exhausted you know the mind\nknows what you need to do to get stuff\ndone but there's a disconnect somewhere\nin there there's a disconnect of the\nbody doesn't want to do it or you're\nthinking the wrong thoughts so it's\nabout connecting to what needs to be\ndone and doing it versus knowing what\nneeds to be done\nsitting on the couch hanging out looking\non instagram and then feeling like crap\nabout yourself because you didn't do\nanything so let's go through the seven\ntips right now so number one\nthis is super important one that i tell\na lot of people i've coached over the\nyears is if you're unmotivated if you're\nnot taking action if you're not\ndisciplined you need to start focusing\non the opportunity and not the\nobligation so what does that mean you\nneed to stop looking at the obligation\nthat's in front of you and you start\nlooking at the opportunity so a good\nexample would be let's say that you want\nto make a hundred thousand dollars a\nyear for your first time in sales and\nthe reason why you want to make a\nhundred thousand dollars for the years\nbecause you want to buy your family a\nhome so that your children can have a\nbackyard and be in a good part of town\nand get a great education and get out of\nthe neighborhood that you're in that's a\nbeautiful thing to be able to think of\nthat that's the opportunity\nthe obligation is that you've got to sit\ndown and make 50 cold calls today maybe\nso instead of looking at the obligation\nof damn it i've got to sit down i've got\nto make 50 phone calls i don't want to\nmake 50 phone calls you look at it and\ngo\nwhen i make these 50 phone calls it'll\nget me one step closer to my children\nhaving a safe environment that they can\ngrow up in with a better education if\nyou think about that\nthe opportunity and not the obligation\nthe 50 phone calls don't you think that\nyou'd be more motivated to make those 50\nphone calls so if you're\nnot disciplined to take the action that\nyou need to to create the life that you\nneed to it's probably because you're\nfocusing on the obligation that's in\nfront of you versus the opportunity that\nyou get for me i'll be honest with you\ni've said this many times when i sit\ndown to plan episodes for this podcast\nit's not my favorite thing to do in the\nworld i love shooting the podcast i love\nrecording them i love all the other\naspects of it but to sit down and plan\nis really not my jam i'm not really keen\non it but i have to force myself to do\nit you know you're not going to love\nevery single part of everything that you\ndo but i have to remind myself as to why\ni'm doing this right if i remind myself\nthat there's hundreds of thousands of\npeople in the podcast that there's going\nto be people whose lives are going to\nchange and remind myself as to why i'm\ndoing this maybe there's someone out\nthere that's really depressed and if\nthey listen this episode it's going to\nturn their life around or at least\nthey're going to feel better if i can\nmake somebody feel better that makes it\nworth it now\ni'm looking at that which is the\nopportunity versus the obligation of i\ngot to sit down and plan\ngreat beautiful so remind yourself why\nyou're doing what you're doing is the\nbiggest key behind it that is the\nopportunity why are you doing it what\nare you doing it for what is the life\nthat you can create how would your life\nchange how do other people's lives\nchange find and focus on the opportunity\nand stop focusing on the obligations\nthat's number one number two is to start\nmastering the small things figure out a\nway to get really good at the small\nthings\nif you've been a listener in my podcast\nfor some time you know i'm a really big\nbeliever in the small things in in just\ndoing the small things right because\nsuccess and life are not about some big\nmassive cataclysmic event that make you\nsuccessful or change your life\ncompletely most of the time it's usually\na bunch of little teeny tiny boring\nthings that you do every single day\nsuccess is usually not sexy it's just a\nbunch of little teeny tiny tasks done\nevery single day to make sure you get it\ndone the best athletes in the world\nthey're not the ones that have you know\nif you look at the\nthe best basketball players they're not\nthe one with like the best crossovers or\nthe best anything what it is is that the\npeople who who master the fundamentals\nof being a basketball player if you look\nat a a football player if you look at a\nwide receiver they've mastered the\nroutes that they're running they've\nmastered stopping on a dime and turning\nto the right they've mastered every\nsingle aspect of it if you look at a\nwide receiver they'll go through and\nthey'll shoot or they'll catch hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds and hundreds\nof balls every single day it's not even\nabout all the other things it's about\nhow can i know that i am a\nfootball player i'm i catch these balls\nif i'm a wide receiver i need to get\nmake sure that it's so built into my\nprogramming into my hands and the\nmuscles in my hands that no matter what\nhappens my hands are going to catch the\nballs they fly at it it's about\nmastering the fundamentals and\neverything that you do success is doing\nthe small things day in day out whether\nyou want to or not so what are the small\nthings you know if you think about that\nwhat are the small things required for\nyou to get what you want in life let's\nfigure it out that's number two master\nthe small things number three is to\ndesign your environment i'll give you a\ngreat example if you're trying to lose\nweight have you designed your\nenvironment to help you lose weight for\nme i'll give you a great example my body\nloves sugar everybody around me knows\nthat if i have sugar i'm going to want\nto finish if i have a piece of candy i'm\ngoing to want to finish the entire bag\ni'll give you a perfect example last\nnight we were driving to go to dinner\nlast night i was in dean's car and he's\ngot kids so he had on the right hand\nside i was in the pasture seat i reached\ndown and he had some some of those\nwelch's fruit chews whatever those are i\nhad one of them because i was like i\nhaven't had one of these since i was a\nkid\ni ended up having like 30 of those damn\nthings i can't have one because my\nbrain's like we gotta go i'm gonna eat\nthe entire bag i know that so i don't\nbuy skittles i don't buy candy if you\ncome into my house my environment is\nbuilt around\nnot allowing myself to eat candy because\ni know i'll finish the entire bag so\nwhat do you do that you need to design\nyour environment for my environment is\ndesigned to make sure that i don't\nfinish an entire bag of candy because i\nknow i'm have a whole bunch of energy\nit's going to drop and i'm going to feel\nlike crap for a few hours so what do you\nneed to do you need to design your\nenvironment\nwhat can you do do you waste too much\ntime on the couch\nmaybe you spend too much time on the\ncouch take all of the cushions off your\ncouch and throw them inside of your\ncloset you're not gonna be hanging out\non your couch if there's no cushions\nright you can what are you gonna do lay\non the floor probably not so then you\ntry to go in you're like well this\ndoesn't look comfortable i might as well\ngo do what needs to be done do you waste\ntoo much time on social media\nhow can you design your environment put\nthe phone in another room and don't\nallow yourself to use it for an hour do\nyou have a roommate you have a spouse do\nyou have someone that you live with give\nthem your phone and say hey don't give\nyou're not allowed to give me this phone\nfor two hours even if i come and ask for\nsay it's emergency don't let me get it\nthat's designing your environment andrew\nhuberman who is the neurobiologist i had\nuh about a month ago on the podcast says\nhe knows that he's addicted to his phone\nso sometimes he's literally taking his\nphone and throwing it on top of the roof\nbecause you\nhave to literally go and get a ladder\nyou gotta get on top of the roof that's\nridiculous so before you go and do all\nthat stuff he's like i know i threw on\nthe roof for a reason i'm gonna get down\nwhen i need to give you another example\ndo you want to wake up and go for a run\nput your running shoes next to your sink\nso when you sleep you just wake up you\nbrush your teeth you put in your running\nshoes and hell go to sleep with your\nrunning clothes on so that you're\nliterally ready to go how can you design\nyour environment to support the life\nthat you're trying to create think about\nthat what do you need to do to design\nyour environment to make it better do\nyou want to meditate what do you need to\ndo design your environment to meditate\nto make meditation easier do you want to\nfloss your teeth what do you need to do\nto design your environment to floss your\nteeth design your environment to support\nyou taking action towards whatever it is\nthat you're trying to do in life so\nthat's number three tip number four to\nmake sure that you have more discipline\nis to make your body move this one\nyou've heard me talk about if you've\nheard other episodes your body will\nrespond to whatever you make it do your\nbody is the most incredible piece of\nmachinery your brain your body all of\nthat stuff is just so incredible\nso what do you need to do to make your\nbody move so that it starts creating the\nchemicals that it needs to i'll give a\nperfect example for me i almost never\nwant to work out there's really most of\nthe time i never want to work out i'm\nlike damn it i got so much other stuff i\ncould do i've got a business i've got\nemployees i've got so many other things\nin reality i'm just making up excuses as\nto why i shouldn't work out so then i\nhave to force myself to work out so\nbefore working out i never feel like i\nwant to work out i'm never like yay\ntoday's leg day never i don't know if\ni've ever said those words in my entire\nlife but then when i get done with the\nworkout my body has woken up my body has\nresponded it has changed its chemical\ncompounds inside of it it's switched\naround from laziness to moving too\nmotivated and it's a lot easier to keep\ngoing at the end of a workout simply\nbecause my body has all of the chemicals\nin it to keep going and a lot of times\nby the end of the workout i'm like why\ndon't i just do a couple more sets and i\nfeel amazing after what happened i\nforced my body to create action and in\nthat action chemicals change in my body\nchemicals change in my brain and gave me\nmore drive to keep going action creates\nmore action inaction creates more\ninaction so if you are not doing what\nneeds to be done\nyou need to break the cycle of an action\nwhat do you need to do\nwell tip number five will help you tip\nnumber five is to count down\nand go don't allow yourself to think mel\nrobbins wrote a book on this called the\nfive second rule and for me it's funny\nthat she wrote a book on this i\nliterally have been doing this for a\nreally long time but i used to count\ndown from three i'd go three two one and\ni would force myself to do whatever that\nthing was when i was younger i was\nreally shy and i knew that if i wanted\nto start making more friends and want to\nget some girlfriends when i was younger\ni would have to figure out a way to\nstart talking to people right and so\nwhat i would do is when i would start to\nthink of what i needed to say i would\nget really nervous and i would think of\nthe first word that i needed to say and\ni would go three two one and then i\nwould say the word and i would force\nmyself to say the word because forcing\nmyself to say the word it'd be really\nawkward if i just said the word and\ndidn't say anything after and forcing\nmyself to say the word would then at\nthat point i had to finish the sentence\nit would force me to finish my sentence\nwhatever it is i was talking about and i\nstill do it if i have a tough\nconversation with my girlfriend or tough\nconversation with my employee\ni still do it three two one and then i\nsay it and i think this is ingrained in\na lot of us as kids where we're in\ntrouble and our parents want us to do\nsomething they're like you better go you\nknow put your shoes away and you're like\ni don't want to do it they're like three\ntwo\nand you're like oh sh i don't know what\nhappens at one i gotta go and run\nhopefully you didn't say oh she was a\nkid but you know what i'm saying but\nyou're like i don't know what happens\nwhen she gets to one or when she gets to\nzero i might as well go run and do it so\ni think it's kind of built into our\nbrains like i'm afraid to find out what\nhappens at zero so with that being built\ninto us\nit doesn't allow us to sit around and\nthink i've never heard someone just\nthink their problems away well i'm just\ngonna think them away and they're gonna\ndisappear it's usually some sort of\naction that's required to get you past\nit the best thing to do is to count down\nthree\ntwo\none and then just force your body to get\nup and move in some sort of way that's\ntip number five tip number six it's a\ngood one this is something i used to do\nwith all of my clients my one-on-one\nclients when i was coaching people for\nyears ask yourself this question\nhow can i make this easier on myself\nwhenever i would have my clients set\ngoals\ni realized that a lot of times they\nwould set a goal and then they would\nmentally make it harder on themselves by\nstarting to\ntell themselves all the struggles all\nthe things that were coming up and i was\nlike well instead of finding finding all\nthe reasons why not and why it's going\nto be hard why don't you just find the\nreasons why it's going to be easy and in\nfact why don't you just make it easier\non yourself so when you figure out what\nit is that you need to do\nto get life done and to get the\ndisciplines you need to ask yourself how\ncan i make this easier because life\nsuccess happiness joy peace all of those\nthings they're not difficult we make\nthem difficult why not find the easy\nroute like we think that we have to\nstruggle our way to success that life\nhas to be so hard it doesn't have to be\nso hard you can make everything in your\nlife easier and if you can make it\neasier if it doesn't feel as hard guess\nwhat you're more more likely to do\nyou're more likely to take action so ask\nyourself the question how can i make\nthis easier and then tip number seven\nget an accountability partner get an\naccountability partner that is on the\nsame path that's also working at\nsomething in their lives and talk every\nsingle day even if it's just through\ntext message say hey\nmy goal is this you know if your goal if\nwe go back to the 50 phone calls to get\nyou a hundred thousand dollars for the\nyear my goal is 50 phone calls every day\nmonday through friday i need you to\ncheck in on me every single day can you\ndo that for me and then every single day\nthis person checks in on you get an\naccountability partner you hold them\naccountable to their goals they hold you\naccountable to your goals and with this\naccountability partner\nif you really want to make it fun if you\ndon't hit your goal or you don't check\nin\nthere needs to be some sort of\nreprimanding or there needs to be\nsomething that you lose in some sort of\nway so one thing that i've really found\nthat motivates people there's a lot of\npeople that are politically charged\nnowadays or they believe very deeply in\nsomething and so what i always say to\npeople you know we have very advanced\npeople that work with us and we\nliterally say and we did this inside of\nour kaizen mastermind which is in our\nmastermind of you know advanced\nmastermind that we have for an entire\nyear with entrepreneurs and leaders and\nand managers and sales leaders and all\nthat is we match them up with an\naccountability partner and i said one of\nthe things that i recommend is that you\nguys figure out\nsomething that they need to do if they\ndon't hit their goal and that something\ncould be and the example that i gave\nthat everyone seemed to react to is\ndonate a thousand dollars\nto the political campaign that you hate\nthe most\nright so if i believe in x\nwhatever that is and there's y that's\nout there that is the exact opposite of\nit if i don't hit my goal if i don't do\nwhat i say i'm going to if i'm i don't\ndo that thing i'm supposed to do i\nactually have to donate a thousand\ndollars to wise campaign that motivates\na lot of people to donate to somebody\nthat you don't like is a big motivation\ncould be anything it could be something\nelse it could be that you have to give\nyour accountability partner a thousand\ndollars give him a hundred bucks even\n200 bucks even 50 bucks i don't know\nwhat it is whatever it is that's\nmotivating for you where your\naccountability partner will then be\nmotivated to keep you even more\naccountable if they know if you don't\nhit your goal and they don't hear from\nyou they get 50 bucks do you think\nthey're going to be checking in any more\noften of course so how can you bring in\nan accountability partner you hold them\naccountable they hold you accountable\nand the goal is for you guys to up level\neach other's lives by checking in on\neach other and making sure that you get\nit done because ultimately a lot of\ntimes you're not disciplined just\nbecause there's nobody checking in on\nyou just because there's no\nnothing that you have to do if you don't\nhit that goal so get an accountability\npartner is tip number seven hey thanks\nso much for watching this video if you\nwant to learn even more about mastering\nyour mind click right here and watch\nthis video as well every single person\nhas 24 hours in the day no more you'll\nnever be given anymore so either you get\nit done or you don't and it's that\nsimple either you make excuses or you\nfigure it out get the life that you want\nto or you don't there is nothing in\nbetween"
