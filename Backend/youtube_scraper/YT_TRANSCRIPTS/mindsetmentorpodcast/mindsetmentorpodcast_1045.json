    "transcript": "ask yourself this question is what i'm\ndoing right now getting me closer to or\nfurther from my goals right now in this\nvery moment what are you doing i love\nthat you're listening this podcast but\nyou got to get off your ass at some\npoint start taking action\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nfive keys to have more confidence so\nlet's not mess around let's just dive in\nthe first key\nto have more confidence is to change the\nway that you talk to yourself i was\nreading a book\nlast week and there was something that i\nsaw that was like oh my god i need to\nget my pen and underline this\nand the phrase that was said is that\nnobody has ever abused you more in your\nentire life than you've abused yourself\nand so i'm gonna ask you guys this\nquestion and we've been through some\nyou've probably been through some stuff\nfor your life some of you guys have been\nthrough some stuff some of you guys have\nbeen through a lot of stuff\nbut\nthat thing that happened to you those\nthings that happened to you\nhappened they were an event that\nhappened but when we talk about abusing\nourselves how often do we abuse\nourselves over and over and over and\nover again we can think about how we\nscrewed up an event that was five years\nago and we're still abusing ourselves\nfor a mistake that we made five years\nago and we're not even the same person\nwe were five years ago no one has abused\nyou more in your life than you've abused\nyourself so think about that what do you\nsay to yourself if you've been listening\nto me for a while there's one thing that\ni love to bring up in the way that you\ntalk to yourself you would never talk to\nsomeone that you love the same way that\nyou talk to yourself why is that why are\nwe so hard on ourselves if we want to\nhave more confidence\nshouldn't we focus on figuring out a way\nto be our biggest best friend to be our\nbiggest cheerleader there's no way for\nme to be a confident person but then\ntalk trash to myself all day long why\nbecause i'm going to create the\nreality\nof what's going on in my head if i'm\nconstantly talking down to myself at all\npoints in time how is it possible for me\nto walk into a room and be like i'm the\nmost confident person here it's\nimpossible and i understand\nthat this is a habit\nthe way you talk to yourself is a habit\nyou can't change it overnight it's\nsomething that you're used to doing\nyou've heard me say before you can't\nchange your first thought but you can\nalways change your second thought start\nbecoming more aware of how maybe you do\nverbally\nmaybe you don't know how to speak like i\ndon't verbally abuse yourself you can't\nchange it overnight but you can start\nbecoming more aware of it and when you\nbecome aware of it you can fix it you\ncan't fix something that you're not\naware of and so if you notice yourself\nokay i have been a little bit hard on\nmyself for something that i did\nyesterday what i want you to do is\ninstead of being hard on yourself and\nfinding all of your flaws because you\nhave a lot of them we all do that's what\nmakes us human because nobody is perfect\nthere's never such thing as perfect\nthere's no such thing as a perfect\nanything perfect person perfect\ncircumstance perfect anything everything\nis imperfect it's like the ancient i\nthink it's japanese wabi-sabi is the\nbeauty in the imperfection can you start\nto find the beauty in your imperfection\ncan you start to go yeah you know what i\ndid mess it up yesterday but you know\nwhat i'm still pretty awesome i'm still\na great person i still treat my friends\nreally well i still you know haven't\ni've been working on my legs and i got a\nreally great butt whatever it is that\nyou've been working on how can you find\nout what's good with you versus always\nsearching for the flaws the first key\nto changing your self-confidence and\nhave more confidence is to change the\nway you talk to yourself because you're\ngoing to create the reality that you\nconstantly have going on in your head\nsecond key\nis to follow through follow through and\nnot just follow through on the big\nthings in life follow through on the\nsmall things especially follow through\non the small things why because we do\none thing is the way you do everything\nare you going to be perfect absolutely\nnot you're not going to be perfect\nyou're going to mess up a lot of stuff\nyou're not going to follow through all\nthe time you're not going to do\neverything you say you're going to do\nbut as long as you're doing more than\nthat like you're if you're more than 50\nin following through maybe you're at 51\nmaybe tomorrow you're 52 and next week\nyou're at 57 you start getting a little\nbit more confident in your\nfollow-through you start becoming better\nand you start start getting this\nfeeling of when i say i'm gonna do\nsomething i freaking do it what would it\nlook like what would your life look like\nwhat would your your reality look like\nwhat would your relationships look like\nwhat would your friendships look like\nwhat would your bank account look like\nwhat would your business look like what\nwould your family look like if you were\nimpeccable\nwith your words and you were impeccable\nwith your actions how would your life\nchange because here's the reason why\nfollowing through is so important think\nabout your subconscious your\nsubconscious is working at all points in\ntime it's running in the background at\nall points in time\nevery single time that you don't follow\nthrough\nthat's a little bit of your subconscious\ngoing oh there's rob that didn't follow\nthrough again up there's rob that didn't\nfall through him oh there's rob he said\nhe was gonna do three sets he decided to\ngive up on himself and do four actually\ni'm sorry those backwards he decided he\nsaid he's gonna do four sets he decided\nto give up himself and do three your\nsubconscious is constantly watching you\nin the background it knows when you\ndon't follow through and so if you were\nto think of your subconscious as the\nlittle guy that's in the background just\nyou know stacking dominoes and on the\nleft hand side he's got all the times\nyou don't follow through and on the\nright hand side he's got all the times\nyou do follow through which one is he\nstacking more\nbecause guess what if you're stacking\nmore of the not follow through i\nguarantee you absolutely 100\nyour confidence is going to be lower but\nif you start stacking the follow-through\nand start stacking the follow-through\nand start stacking the follow-through\nyour confidence will raise because your\nsubconscious is going you know what i'm\nstarting to notice when rob says he's\ngonna do something he freaking does it\nthat's where confidence comes from\nshowing up for yourself when no one else\nis there not showing up for other people\nsure that counts and that matters but\nshowing up for yourself think about your\nsubconscious when you don't follow\nthrough and then think about your\nsubconscious when you do follow through\nit's like lifting heavier weight your\nsubconscious like i can do this i've\nbeen doing this before you want me to do\nthat little thing did you see what i did\nyesterday got it don't worry about it\nthat's where confidence comes from\nconfidence comes from showing up for\nyourself for following through from\nbeing impeccable with your word and\ndoing what you say you're going to do\nstep number two is to follow through\nstep number three is to force yourself\nto get better results focus on going\njust a little bit further than normal i\nhave the law of 10 i like to call it\njust do 10 more in everything that you\ndo that's it if you are a salesperson\nand you have to do a hundred cold calls\na day\nand that's required\ndo 110 it's only 10 phone calls i've sat\ndown many many times and done 100 cold\ncalls in a day\nmany many many times so it's possible to\ndo\nbut once you get to that 100 it's like\nall right i could stop right now or i\ncould do 10 more right if you do 10 more\na day monday through friday for an\nentire year that's two thousand\nsix hundred extra cold calls a year how\nmuch different would your business be\nwhatever it is that you sell whatever it\nis you do if you did ten extra phone\ncalls if you hit\ntwo thousand six 600 extra phone calls\nover the course of a year that's 26 if\nyou're doing 100 cold calls a day\nnormally and then you add an extra 10\nmonday through friday for a year 2 600\nextra cold calls that's like adding 26\ndays of cold calls into your schedule\nhow much different would your mindset be\nhow much different would your bank\naccount be how much different would your\nbusiness be if you just did 10 more it's\nonly 10 more 100 to 110. if you say\nyou're going to run one mile\nrun 1.1 miles let's just say monday\nthrough friday you decide that you want\nto run one mile monday through friday\nand instead you decide to go 10 more and\nyou do 1.1 miles and you do it monday\nthrough 5 for an entire year that's 26\nextra miles a year how different would\nyour body be if you did 26 more miles\nthis year and it's not that much it's\nnot 26 at once it's not an entire\nmarathon at one time it's just an extra\n10th of a mile you can do that just add\n10 instead of going for 10 reps add 10\nmore 10 of 10\nis one so all you have to do is 11 reps\nthat's thousands of extra reps per year\nhow different would your body be if you\ndid thousands of extra reps maybe tens\nof thousands of extra reps every single\nyear doesn't seem like much it's only\none extra rep it's 10 more it won't kill\nyou\nbut it will change you that is value of\ndoing just a little bit better than what\nyou're currently doing just 10 more also\nit helps your mindset around finishing\nand going further instead of stopping\njust before instead of stopping in nine\nreps when you're supposed to go to 10\nwhen you go to 11 you're like i'm\nshowing up for myself i'm showing up for\nmyself and if there's that little guy in\nyour subconscious that's just stacking\ndominoes\nyou're freaking sad that you're showing\nup for yourself those dominoes are going\nto get stacked so that's number three\nget better results by going 10 more step\nnumber four is to push yourself through\nfear there's this weird misconception\nthat i find with people that people feel\npeople who have not been as successful\nas they want to be in life think that\nsuccessful people are fearless think\nthat they have no fear think that\nthey're just ready to go at all points\nin time\nno\nhere's the difference successful people\nhave fear\nthey feel the fear they just learn to\nstop listening to it a successful person\nand an unsuccessful person still have\npretty close to the same amount of fear\nthe difference is who listens to it and\nwho doesn't the reason why is because i\nthink that the most successful people in\nthe world\nmost successful athletes in the world\nknow your fear is showing you the edge\nof your comfort zone when you're feeling\na physical feeling of fear\nit is a physical\nmanifestation of your fear that is your\ncomfort zone because you're not going to\nfeel fear in your comfort zone right if\nyou're sitting at your house watching\nnetflix you're on instagram\nthere's no fear going on there you're\ndoing something that you've done\nhundreds and hundreds of times most\nlikely but when you feel fear\nthat is a physical manifestation of your\ncomfort zone that's a beautiful thing\nthat is your mind your body your reality\nshowing you hey rob\nyou're on the edge of your comfort zone\nand so most people when they feel fear\nthey start to lean back they go oh this\nisn't good this isn't right i'm not\nsupposed to be doing this i'm not\nsupposed to be here fear shows me i'm in\nthe wrong place in reality fear is\nshowing you that you're in the right\nplace and instead of leaning back you\nneed to lean into fear fear is beautiful\nfear the physical feeling of fear\nis the physical manifestation of your\ncomfort zone it is showing you what you\nneed to push past it is showing you\nwhere you need to go it is showing you\nit is one of the biggest gifts you could\npossibly get is to find out where your\ncomfort zone is by feeling fear feel\nfear and do it anyways okay that's step\nnumber four push the fear and step\nnumber five is to stack your small wins\nif you've been listening my podcast for\na long time you know i'm a really big\nfan of like the smallest ones you could\npossibly get i want you to stack as many\nwins as you possibly can throughout the\nday i'm not talking about you know\nclosing a hundred thousand dollar deal\neven though that's amazing that's great\nyou'll probably be super excited about\nit i'm talking about the little things\nbecause it's the little things that\nmatter the tiny little wins you've heard\nme say it try to get as many wins as you\ncan first thing in the morning when your\nalarm clock goes off wake up don't hit\nthe snooze button when you get out of\nbed make that damn thing when you you\nuse a dish clean it right after it's\ndone when you're trying on clothes\nbefore you're you know about to go out\nand party whatever it is that you do\nmaybe go on a little date trying to look\nsexy instead of leaving all of your\nclothes on the bed\nthat you tried on to find the perfect\noutfit put those clothes away it might\ntake you two minutes but it's a small\nwin it's a small one of going you know\nwhat i'm showing up for myself\nit's a small way of going you know what\ni'm stacking those dominoes how many\nsmall wins can you come up with\nthroughout the entire day think about\nthat next time you're going through your\nday today when you get off stop\nlistening to this whenever you're done\nand you go through your day think about\nhow many small wins you could stack\nwalking into the gym is a small way not\neven finishing\nthe workout walking into the gym is a\nsmall win and small wins add up in your\nsubconscious you have to make sure that\nyou're winning more than you're losing\nyou know it's like the the phrase and\natomic habits you don't if if you think\nof your your habits and what you're\ndoing as voting if you're running for\nfor governor you don't have to get all\nof the votes you've just got to get the\nmajority of the votes you've got to get\n51 percent of the votes in order to\nbecome governor so think of every single\naction as a vote for the person you want\nto become look at your actions\nthroughout the day and ask yourself\nam i voting in the right direction am i\nvoting for the rob that i want to build\nam i voting for the rob that you know is\ngoing to keep me in my comfort zone ask\nyourself this question is what i'm doing\nright now getting me closer to or\nfurther from my goals right now in this\nvery moment what are you doing you're\nlistening to this is it any closer to\nyour goals it might be because you're\nbuilding up your mindset but you got to\ntake action eventually i love that\nyou're listening this podcast but you\ngot to get off your ass at some point\nstart taking action hopefully you're\ntaking action while you're listening to\nthis podcast that's like a you know\ndouble whammy that's perfect right\nyou're working on your mindset and\nyou're conquering some stuff out in the\nreal physical world small wins add up in\nyour subconscious you got to make sure\nthat every single action that you take\nis adding up to a win there's nothing\nworse than knowing that you should have\nshown up for yourself and you didn't\nthere's nothing worse than knowing that\nyou could have done something better and\nyou didn't and you have that that\nfeeling of damn it i could have done it\ni know i could have done i know i could\nhave showed up for myself i know i could\nhave done this but i didn't i backed\naway and that's something that i do\ni do too often and instead of judging\nyourself you look at it very\nsubjectively and say okay\ni did it or very objectively and you\nlook at oh i did it that's that's that's\nall right i did it\nlook at it objectively don't put any\nemotion to it and ago next time i won't\ndo that thing i did before i'm going to\nshow up for myself i'm going to get\nlittle tiny wins i'm gonna start\nstacking them up i'm gonna stack up\nthose little winds in my subconscious\njust have this visual reminder your\nsubconscious is like a guy that's in the\nbackground he's got stack of dominoes\nhe's putting some on the left he's\nputting some of the right the ones on\nthe left are all of the times that you\ndidn't show up for yourself or you gave\nup early you said you were going to do\nsomething you didn't do it all the ones\non the right it's the times when you\nshowed up the small wins when you woke\nup and you said you're going to wake up\nwhen you took the cold shower instead of\nthe hot shower you did everything you\nneeded to do to show up for yourself\nthat is exciting think of your\nsubconscious guy stacking dominoes and\nthink of it this way if you want to\ncreate the life that you want if you\nwant to create the confidence that you\nwant that little guy\nneeds to stack more dominoes on the\nright-hand side of all the times you\nfollow through for yourself hey thanks\nso much for watching this video if you\nwant to learn even more about mastering\nyour mind click right here and
