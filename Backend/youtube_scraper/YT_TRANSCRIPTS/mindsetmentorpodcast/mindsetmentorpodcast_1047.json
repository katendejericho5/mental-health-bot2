    "transcript": "i want you to think about the things\nthat are making you anxious and ask\nyourself this question that alone\n90 of the time makes somebody go\nso let me tell you what i've been doing\nit's super simple but it is ridiculously\nprofound\nwe're gonna be talking about something\nthat i should have probably talked about\nquite a long time ago but uh i talked\nquite a bit about anxiety and all of\nthose things in march and april and as\nthings were going on and then i had a\nconversation with a friend\nabout covet about all the things that\nare happening and i'm not gonna give you\nmy world perspective because who needs\nto hear another opinion in this world so\ni'm not gonna give you any opinions on\nanything but what i will tell you is how\ni know how to work through anxiety how\ni've helped myself get through anxiety\nhave had my friends help get through\nanxiety i've had clients get through\nanxiety and stress and depression all\nthose and there's a lot of heavy that's\nhappening in the world we can admit it\nand first off we probably need to admit\nit like this has been for most people a\nheavy year\nit has been a lot of unknown things that\nwe did not see coming up that have come\nup right and you can feel really heavy\nif you are a person that's very\nkinesthetic you can feel\nlost if you're a person's very head and\nanalytical type of person\nyou might just be ready for this to be\nover i'm actually pretty sure that\neverybody who's listening to this is\nready for this to be over but at this\npoint in time it's not\nit just isn't and so what comes down to\nis us accepting that and i'm here to\ntell you everybody\nit'll be all right it will eventually\nwork itself out\nand the quicker that we just accept that\nit is the way that it is right now\nand that it will eventually be all right\nthat i think the easier it'll make our\nlives until it gets to at least some\nfeeling of normalcy and i'm going to try\nto help you feel better and i was having\na conversation with a friend of mine and\nwe were talking about covet and the fact\nthat she's going home to her parents uh\nfor christmas and she has a lot of\nanxiety around possibly bringing kovid\nhome to her parents for the holidays\nwhich is the worst christmas gifts you\ncould give your parents but she's afraid\nof giving that to her parents uh going\nhome for the holidays completely\nunderstandable makes a whole lot of\nsense and she was talking about that but\nmore than anything else what she was\nreally anxious about is the fact that\ncovet is still around the fact that\nwe're still dealing with this thing what\nare we nine months into it and she was\njust talking about how she was anxious\nand stressed because of that\nthen the conversation went a little bit\nfurther and she was talking about you\nknow the other thing that scares me a\nlot as well is the economy like i don't\nknow what's going to happen with the\neconomy with all of the inflation that's\ngoing on with you know about 20 of the\nworld's money or the us's money was just\nprinted this year you know and just\nwhat's going to happen with the economy\nand then she went into rolling into how\nshe's also having these anxious thoughts\naround getting these test results that\nshe's waiting for her dog and you know\nthe dog the the\nthe issues that's happening with her dog\nand the fact that her dog might have\ncancer and she's just\nat this point in time it's a waiting\ngame for all of them right so it's a\nwaiting game for the test results for\nthe dog it's a waiting game for uh\nseeing eventually if kovid's ever going\nto pass or what's going to happen with\nour lives next and it's a waiting game\nto see what's going to happen with the\neconomy and i let her go through and\ntalk about it and talk about it\nand then what happened was i mentioned\nto her\nthat the things that she's having all of\nthis stress and anxiety around she has\nabsolutely no control over and that's\nwhat's giving her stress and anxiety\nright so she has no control over what's\ngoing on in covid she has zero control\nover that she also has zero control over\nthe economy and she also has zero\ncontrol over test results from blood\nwork that was done a few days ago for\nher dog zero control over all three of\nthose things now before i go any further\ni want you to think about the things\nthat are making you anxious and ask\nyourself this question do i have any\ncontrol over those things all of the\nthings that are bringing you worry and\nfear and anxious thoughts do you have\nany control over them or\ndo you have those anxious thoughts and\nfeelings around them simply because of\nthe fact that you have no control over\nthem and you want to have control but\nyou don't\nso your anxious thoughts could be coming\nfrom the fact that you want to have\ncontrol over something that you\nabsolutely will never have control over\nand you haven't just fully accepted that\nlack of control\nbecause of those things three things\nthat i mentioned to you about my friend\nnone of them literally none of them she\ncan control she cannot do anything about\nthose\nand it's not that those things don't\nexist they all exist it's that she's\nfighting them in her mind and that is\nbringing in the anxiety\nso what are you fighting\nare you fighting things\nand the other thing that she's not doing\nshe's not accepting she's not accepting\nthat they exist they are here they are\nthe way that they are she's just not\naccepting them she is resisting the way\nthat the world currently is right now\nright that's what at its simplest form\nshe is resisting the way that the world\ncurrently is she's resisting the covet\nshe's resisting the economy she's\nresisting the dog's test results she's\njust resisting and this is not uncommon\ni was reading an article the other day\nit says depression has gone up four\ntimes four hundred percent from the\nexact same time last year\nand i think a lot of the reason why is\nbecause people are feeling all of these\nanxious thoughts and at the same time\nthey're they're not accepting the way\nthat the world is and they're they're\nnot allowing themselves to learn and\ngrow and get better in these times and\nbe able to work through it because they\njust so badly want the world to go back\nto quote unquote normal whatever bit of\nnormalcy that they can have again and if\nyou've listened to my podcast before\nyou've heard me say this your level of\nstress anxiety worry and fear and\ndepression\nunless you're clinically depressed\nthere's a completely different that's a\nwhole other episode that we could do but\nyour level of worry anxiety sadness fear\nall of those things anxiety all that\nyour level of it will be in direct\nproportion to how much you're resisting\nthe way that the world is so if you're\nextremely anxious right now i guarantee\nyou are extremely resisting the way that\nthe world is you're extremely resisting\nsomething that is out there in the world\nright if you you're having low levels of\nanxiety and just a little bit maybe it's\njust bubbling under the surface which i\nfeel is for most people how it usually\nworks it's not that it's full-blown\nanxiety attacks it's just it's just a\nlittle bit of anxiety that's bubbling\nunder the surface all day every day and\nthe reason why is probably because you\nhave a low level of resisting the way\nthat the world is you're wishing\nall right well yeah you know it is this\nway but\ni just wish it would go back to normal\ni'm just so i just want to go back to\nwork i want to see my friends again i\nwant to be able to hug my mom and it's\nnot that it's a full-blown panic attack\nfor you might just be that you're just\nresisting versus full acceptance you\nknow there's a shaman that i've worked\nwith in the past and done psychedelics\nwith and he says just surrender harder\nright just surrender harder that's what\nwe all kind of need to do right now and\nactually what we need to do probably for\nthe rest of our lives is just surrender\nharder i'm not saying surrender to the\npowers to be if you think that the you\nknow the economy and the cove and all\nthat stuff is being put on by some\nmasterminds behind the scenes i'm not\nsaying surrender those i'm saying\nsurrender the fact that it is the way\nthat the world is right now and at this\nmoment there's nothing that i know of\nthat we can do about it so do i want\ncovet to exist anymore no hell no of\ncourse i don't but what can i do about\nit\nwhat can i personally do about covid\nright\ni'm just a college dropout i don't know\nabout covet i don't know i think about\nall that science and stuff\ni can barely formulate words sometimes\nhow am i going to save the world from\ncovet i'm not so do i want it to be here\nno but\nit is here and i've got to figure out a\nway just to accept that\nand\nyou can either resist\nor you can accept those are the two\nthings that you can really do yeah it is\nthe way that it is\nit's not what i would have chosen but it\nis the way that it is and what you have\nto realize is that's completely my\ndecision and you\ncan resist or you can accept and that is\ncompletely your decision as well it's\nfully 100 up to you and what you have to\nrealize is that the more that you're\nresisting\nthe more that you're stealing away your\njoy in the present moment your joy is\nbeing stolen from you in this present\nmoment because of your resistance\nyour joy your happiness your peace in\nthis moment is being stolen from you\nbecause you won't just fully accept that\nhey the world is the way that it is\nright if somebody breaks up with you\nyour joy\nis stolen from you if you're resisting\nand going god i just wish that we would\nbe back together again and you're\nthinking about how the past used to be\nand you're thinking about your love and\nall of the times that you hung out and\nwatched netflix and chilled and had all\nthose great moments you're like god i\njust want it to be that way again but\nit's not and guess what the more that\nyou're resisting the fact that it is in\nthe way that you want it to be\nobviously the more that it's gonna be\nholding you back the more anxiety and\nstress and worry and fear you're gonna\nbe having around that thing and\nyou have to realize if your joy is being\nstolen from you in the present moment\nyour life is just a collection of\npresent moments that's all that it is\nthere is no past and there is no future\neverything that has happened to you and\nwill ever happen to you in your entire\nlife is in the present moment nothing\nhas happened to you in the past the past\nis just a present moment that has passed\nright nothing has happened to you in the\nfuture yet but when that future thing\ndoes happen that will be a present\nmoment and so if we're really serious\nabout this and trying to make ourselves\nfeel better we need to be very aware\nthat our entire life is just the present\nmoment the only thing that that does\nexist and will ever exist for us is the\npresent moment and if we're resisting\ncovet if we're resisting the economy if\nwe're resisting a breakup if we're\nresisting test results all of those\nthings we're resisting it and having our\njoy stolen from us in this moment when\nwe fully can experience the love and the\njoy and the happiness and the peace that\nwe truly want to if we were to just step\ninto it and accept stop resisting and go\nwhat is great about this moment right\nnow\nand just allowing ourselves to sink into\nthe present moment more than anything\nelse\nand the perfect question asks yourself\nand this would i ask my friend\ni said okay\nnow that we've gone through all these\nthings i got a question for you the\nquestion is are you okay right now\nshe's like what do you mean i was like\nin this moment in this very second\nare you okay\nand she's like well yeah i mean i'm good\nyou know i've got this coming up and\nthis i was like no no no i don't care\nabout bills i don't care about anything\nthat's happening in the future i don't\ncare about any of that\nin this very second\nare you safe\nand are you okay\nshe's like yes and i was like\nnow just think about that thought just\njust marinate on that thought how does\nit make you feel like it makes me feel a\nlot better and the reason why is because\nall of the stress and anxiety that we\nhave is all for things that could\npossibly be happening in the future we\nmake up all of these ghosts and demons\ninto the future that could possibly\nexist but in reality it's never about\nthose things it's always about this\npresent moment right now so if you feel\nanxious thoughts if you feel like\nthere's something wrong i want you to\nask yourself in this moment right now am\ni okay\nnot oh my god i have pills i have to pay\ntomorrow or later on at five o'clock i\nhave to make sure i'm at this\nappointment no right now in this [ __ ]\nmoment this very second are you okay\nand the answer is yes can you sink into\nthat feeling of being okay don't sink\ninto the feeling of the anxiety of the\npossible things that could happen in\nyour future can you sink into the\nfeeling of being just fine right now in\nthis present moment feel the feelings of\nwhat it feels like to be fine in this\nmoment\nare you okay you are\nokay i feel better i feel at least a\nlittle bit better\nand if i can continue to notice when i\nfeel anxious thoughts and start to\nre-pattern myself to go am i okay right\nnow in this moment yes i am okay am i\nokay right\n99.999 of the time you're okay right now\nin this present moment and there's\nnothing to be worrying about or anxiety\nthat you should have but you're bringing\nit up and forcing it on to yourself\nright so\nif you have anxieties of anxiety or\nstress or fear or worry that you've been\nfeeling my question to you is this what\nare you resisting\nif you're anxious if you're worrying if\nyou're fearful if you're feeling those\nnegative emotions come up what are you\nresisting\nthink about that for a second what is it\nwhat is it that you're resisting is it a\nbreakup are you not accepting the\nbreakup wanting it the way the world to\ngo back to the way that it used to be\nthe fact that you're not person's not in\nlove with you anymore what is it that\nyou're resisting\nand the question is are you okay right\nnow are you okay\nand the other thing we have to do is we\nhave to accept\nand that we can control almost nothing\nlike we literally can almost control\nnothing\nlike literally you can barely control\nyour own bowels after taco tuesday like\nyou can literally control almost like\nyou can't control other people you can't\ncontrol your children very well you\ncan't control the weather we can barely\ncontrol our own thoughts most of the\ntime we can't\nwe can control almost nothing and this\nis\nme telling you this as a recovering\ncontrolaholic where i realized on one of\nmy very first psychedelic journey that i\ndid that i was a control freak i had\ncontrol issues and that was causing all\nof my stress and my worry and my anxiety\nin my life and the past three years\nthree and a half years since i've done\nit have been a complete unraveling of\njust letting go of all the control and\nnoticing it when it comes up and\nrealizing that the more that i let go of\ncontrol and the more the less i try to\ncontrol everything the more amazing my\nlife becomes\nand so we can't control our first\nthought\nbut you can always control your second\nthought\nand so even if the first thought comes\nup is an anxious thought well then\nnotice it identify it and then go is\nthat the thought that i want no it's not\nokay what is a better thought that i\nwant to replace it with and replace that\nthought with a new thought you can't\ncontrol your second or you can't control\nyour first stop but you can always\ncontrol your second thought\nand if you change your first thought\nenough to whatever this second thought\nis enough over and over and over and\nover and over again you eventually\nre-pattern your brain in your thoughts\nand your second thought will eventually\nstart to become your first thought if\nyou're naturally a negative person\nidentify that negativity and replace it\nwith positivity and if you do this over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain all day every day hundreds of\ntimes every day depending how much\nnegativity pops up in a year two years\nthree years five years you'll notice\nthat your new\nfirst thoughts are positive and not\nnegative anymore we can re-pattern our\nbrain by noticing it and by taking\ncontrol of it you can't control your\nfirst thought but you can always control\nyour second thought\nand then what do you do\nit's very simple right now am i okay\nin this moment it's very second i am\nokay\nokay\ngood number two accept\naccept stop resisting the world is the\nway that it is\nthe more that i resist the worse i'm\ngoing to feel so if i can just accept\ni'm going to feel better and number\nthree ask yourself this question this is\nsomething that i had\ni was feeling a lot of it's probably\nabout five years ago i got off a plane\nand flew into austin\nand uh\nand it was like i came from florida\nand florida was hot it was amazing and i\nwas on the beach i flew back in austin\nand it was like\n19 degrees\nand just like it wasn't even snowing it\nwas like that really frozen rain and it\nwas cold and it was hailing and it was\njust a crap day outside and i got off\nthe plane and i was like ugh gross this\nis disgusting i'm waiting for my uber to\ncome pick me up and it's like the wind\nis just like howling it's like 30 miles\nan hour it's cold\ni came from amazing beautiful florida to\ncold rainy windy wet austin\nand i started to notice\nmy feelings change towards being in\naustin at that moment i didn't feel good\ni was like damn why didn't i just stand\ni started to get really kind of anxious\nabout why didn't i just stand forward i\ncould have stayed in florida for an\nextra week whatever it was\nand then i made myself reframe\nwhat was going on and i asked myself\nthis question that's the question i have\nfor you is what's beautiful about this\nmoment\nand i forced myself to answer what was\nbeautiful about this moment and so i\nlooked around and i started noticing\ndifferent things that i could feel they\nwere beautiful oh my gosh i have my\nhealth i have you know people who love\nme in my life i have you know a business\nthat i love running i have things that i\nlove doing i have you know a time\ntomorrow to go work out with one of my\nbest friends and i started noticing\nwhat's beautiful about the moment and by\nnoticing that thing that i felt was\nbeautiful i was actually starting to\nunravel all of the feelings of anxiety\nand stress that i had about coming back\nin to the way that it is in the cold and\nthe rain and the sleet and the snow and\nall of the crap that we had that day\nand so the thing i want you to do is\nnumber number one ask yourself am i okay\nnumber two accept it and number three\nask yourself this this one question\nwhat is beautiful about this moment and\nreframe your thoughts in the current\nmoment the current present that's being\nstolen from you and reframe it to\nfinding what's beautiful in your life\nand what's beautiful in this present\nmoment and this right here that i'm\ngoing to share with you is a strategy\nthat i've used for tons of my clients\nbefore in the past and it's actually a\nstrategy i've used for myself and it's\nactually a strategy the reason why i'm\ntalking about it is because it's a\nstrategy i had to use for myself at 4am\nin the morning a few days ago and i\ndon't know if you guys have ever done\nthis before where you wake up in the\nmorning it's early in the morning maybe\nyou have to go to the bathroom or you\nhear noise or dogs are barking or\nsomething like that\nand then immediately\na thought comes through of something\nthat needs to be done or something that\nyou have to do or it could be an anxious\nthought i don't know what it is for you\nbut that first thought gets your brain\ngoing and then once your brain gets\ngoing it's gone you can't you can't stop\nit and so a few nights ago we've been\nsuper super busy my business this week\nwe have an event that we're planning\nwhich we'll tell you about later we have\na mastermind that we're planning that's\ncoming up as well a three another three\nday event we have uh tons of other\namazing things that are coming up and\nit's all good stuff\nbut the problem is i woke up to go to\nthe bathroom and immediately one thing\nthat i had to do popped into my head\nand then it was a cascade of all of\nthese different things oh my gosh i'm\nbehind on doing this i've got to reach\nout to this person i've got to get a\nquote for this i've got to get this this\ni have to negotiate this price and it\nstarted to become all of these anxious\nthoughts rolling into my head one of the\nthings that's very uh that's a huge\nmisconception is because i'm a mindset\nguy that i must have this perfect\nmindset and nothing holds me back but\nnothing could be further from the truth\nthe reason why i am the quote unquote\nmindset guys because i have to work on\nmy mindset sometimes more than other\npeople just to motivate myself to get\n[ __ ] done and so what happened was i had\nthe first thought i had a second thought\nthird thought and i was sitting in bed\nfor about 45 minutes so it's about four\no'clock in the morning right i'm in bed\nand i'm like i'm not falling asleep it's\nnot happening and i was like i have to\nget up and i have to use my strategy on\nmyself and i had to get up and i had to\nget my journal so i went into the living\nroom i got my journal four o'clock in\nthe morning and i started journaling\nsome of the stuff that i needed to and\ni'm going to take you through exactly\nwhat it is that i did for myself and\nwhat i've done for many other clients as\nwell you know i've worked with a lot of\ndifferent people that have anxiety\nproblems um and this is just one of the\nstrategies i've come up with and the\nfirst thing\nis the awareness that i'm having anxious\nthoughts that's the first thing right\nlike the first thing is is now you have\nto you're inside of your head you're\nhaving a thoughts you're inside your\nhead you have an anxious thoughts you've\ngot to pause\nand notice as the observer what's going\non here okay yep i've done this before i\nknow exactly where i am i'm in the\nmiddle of anxious thoughts i need to\nthen remove myself\noutside of my head you know it's like\nthe quote when you when you take\nyourself if you don't take yourself out\nof the jar you can't read the label\ninside of the jars inside of my head i\nneed to take myself out of my own head\nbecome the observer and say what is\nactually happening here oh\ntoo many thoughts too many anxious\nthoughts\nand uh one of the things that about\nanxiety is that anxiety comes from your\nthoughts and when you google and\nactually start to look up and research\nanxiety there is no cure for anxiety and\nthe reason why is because it comes from\nyour thoughts there's no actual hey you\nhave anxiety this is the chemical that\nyou should take now i will tell you this\npeople do have that you can go to a\ndoctor and if you have too much anxious\nthoughts they will give you stuff to\nthen make you feel different and put\ndifferent chemicals into your brain but\nit's not a chemical imbalance right so\ni've had anxiety attacks before in the\npast it's been a long time since that's\nhappened i've been around many people in\nthe middle of anxiety attacks i've\nworked with many people who have anxiety\nsome of them that have such crippling\nanxiety they literally cannot even leave\ntheir house their social anxiety is so\nhigh that they haven't left their house\nin two to three years\nand the reason why is because it all\ncomes from the thoughts and when\nthoughts are in your head\nthey're extremely hard to deal with\nright\nit's like trying to grab water like when\nyour thoughts are in your head and\nyou're trying to work through thoughts\nit's like trying to grab onto water like\nyou will never really grab it it's\nalways going to get away from you right\nso\nthoughts can't stay in your head because\nthoughts are too abstract you need to\nget all of your thoughts and put them on\npaper because to try to\nwrangle up your thoughts and to try to\nfigure out what's going on and figure\nout how to work through them is like\ntrying to punch somebody in the dark\nlike you're not going to see that person\nmaybe every once in a while you take\nfour five six swings and on the\nhundredth swing you might hit that\nperson but then they're gone again and\nthey move that's kind of like figuring\nout your thoughts in your own head and\ntoo many times people are trying to\nfigure out their issues they're trying\nto figure out what's going on their head\nthey're trying to figure out why they\nfeel the way they feel they're trying to\nfigure out why they're sad why they're\ndepressed or other anxious why their\nlife isn't going the way they want to\nbut they never get a freaking pen and\npaper and write down what's actually\ngoing on right so i sat down with my\njournal and i wrote down a few questions\nright if you have ever learned how to\njournal for me before in the past it's\nsuper simple\nyou just ask yourself questions and then\nyou force yourself to answer it so i was\nwriting down and i noticed that i was\nhaving anxious thoughts so i said what\nam i having anxious thoughts about and i\njust wrote them down and there was like\n17 things it was like a massive list of\nall of these things that started\nflooding through\nbecause i had so much i had to be like\nso much was on my plate so many plates\nwere spinning at one time\nkind of what happens sometimes when you\ngrow a business and you know the higher\nyou go the harder the wind blows right\nthe wind was blowing hard this morning\nthat morning and so the first thing i\nwrote down is what am i having anxious\nthoughts about and i wrote all the\ndifferent things down and i just you\nknow brain dumped put them all down okay\ni've got to do this for this person this\nfor this person this thing has to happen\nyou know i got to make sure that i plan\nall my podcast episodes i've got to\nrecord all the podcast episodes this\nthis this all of these things i put them\nall down on a piece of paper right then\nwhat i did is i took each individual one\nand started working through it right i\nstarted working through each individual\none\nand then helped myself come up with a\nplan and so let me show you how this\nworks so next time you feel some anxiety\nnow\ni this isn't going to happen in the\nmiddle\ngoing to help you in the middle of a\npanic attack i promise you that because\nby the time you're in a panic attack\nyou're already too far\nlike you're too far you just have to\nwait till that calms down\nbut if you feel just anxious thoughts\nyou feel sad you don't feel right this\nis something that you could use so you\nwrite down and say what am i feeling\nanxious about what am i not liking what\nam i fearing right now whatever it is\nthat's there in front of you you write\nit down you take it out of your head you\nput it on that piece of paper right the\nnext thing that you ask yourself is\nwhat's the worst that could happen now\nyou might think this is not a good\nquestion to ask somebody who's in the\nmiddle of having anxious thoughts but it\nis because i'm going to show you exactly\nwhy that is right so what's the worst\nthat could happen\nthe next question is what's the best\nthat can happen\nright because i want to contrast the\nworst that can happen\nand then the last step is what last\nquestion is what is my next best step to\nmake me feel better right now\nright so let's go through those\nquestions and talk about why they're\nimportant and exactly how to work\nthrough them okay you write down the\nquestion what am i feeling anxious about\nand you write down all of the things\nthat you might be feeling anxious about\nall of those right we all have things\nthat can pop up in the back your head we\nall have busy moments we all have\nstressful moments we all have sad\nmoments in our life but what we're doing\nby actually writing it down and not\nletting it be\non the you know in our head anymore or\nputting on a piece of paper is we're\nbasically in that room trying to punch\nsomebody in the dark and we flip the\nlights on and we're like oh they're\nright there i see him\nthat alone\n90 of the time makes somebody go\nokay it's on a piece of paper i feel so\nmuch better about it because it's not\nabstract anymore it's there it's it's\nit's literally tangible i can see it on\nthat piece of paper usually that starts\nthe relief and a lot of times people\ndon't know what's making them feel\nanxious and so when they're able to take\nit put it down and identify it it\nalready just by writing it down makes\nthem feel so much better right so that's\nthe first thing let's identify maybe\nit's one thing maybe it's 17 things like\nit was for me\nright now let's go into what's the worst\nthat could happen\nhere's why this is important is because\nwhen you don't put it on paper and\nyou're dealing with it abstractly\nyour brain makes up these fears that are\ncompletely illogical and are ridiculous\nright oh my gosh if i don't you know end\nup getting this done i'm going to lose\nmy house and my kids and my family and\nlike that's where your brain immediately\ngoes to the worst possible outcome\nso i'm going to put down the what's the\nworst that could happen so that i can\nliterally see it and go oh my god that's\nridiculous that's never going to happen\nright because 99.9 of the time\nit never gets as bad as your brain\nactually makes it before you put on a\npiece of paper so when you write down\nwhat's the worst that could happen and\nit's like oh i could lose my job and my\nfamily could be homeless and my kids\ncould be homeless and my wife could\ndivorce me and i could be a terrible\nfather and you look at it and you're\nlike uh yeah but that's not gonna happen\nlike that's that's ridiculous\nand usually that's what happens when you\nactually take it and put it down on\npaper and you see it you identify you\nonce again flip the lights on so that\nyou can see what's going on in your head\nso what's the worst that could happen i\nwant to identify that and i want to get\nclear on what that is\nbecause then i can go ah that's not\ngoing to happen i'm not going to let\nthat happen all right let's go to the\nnext step what's the best that can\nhappen\nright so let's look at it positively\nso if i'm up all night i'm going okay\nlike for instance we have this event\nthat's coming up i have to get the event\nthe contract the the av video team i've\ngot to negotiate all that stuff i've got\nto get the the place figured out you\nknow we've already got it we've got to\nget the contract signed all that stuff\nwe got to get the audio video team\ncompletely separate got to get them\nnegotiated get the contract done for\nthem then i started thinking about all\nthe things that i'm planning and the\nworst that could happen is that it\ndoesn't happen right and that would suck\nbut it's not the world's not going to\nend the best that could happen is we\nhave you know a bunch of people show up\nto it everybody gets there safely they\nfeel amazing they're able to make new\nconnections and 100 lives are impacted\nright\nthat's pretty damn exciting and so now\ni'm looking at the what's the worst that\ncould happen and going ah that's\nprobably not gonna happen and then i'm\nlooking at what's the best that could\nhappen and i actually feel better about\nthis thing that i was having anxious\nthoughts about that kept me awake for a\nwhile right\nusually it doesn't go as good as you\nthink it's gonna go but it goes way way\nway way way way better\nthan the worst that could happen right\nif there's like a medium ground and and\nthe worst is all the way over to the\nright and the best is all the way over\nto the left usually in that medium\nground it's going to swing a little bit\nmuch more towards the left than is the\nright so i want to actually identify\nwhat is the best thing that could happen\nthrough this like so if you're in the\nmiddle of a divorce and that divorce\nobviously you don't want to go through\nthat sucks i can't even understand what\nthat would feel like to go through\nsomething like that right\nbut you could go what's the worst that\ncould happen you can work through and\nsay what's the best that could happen\nwell we go through this divorce\nwe go our separate ways and i become a\nfree person and i can refine myself\nbecause i felt like i lost myself in\nthat relationship and then you're like\noh my god what can what how amazing\nwould it be for me to find myself and\nwho i truly am and who i've grown into\nbecause i grew apart from this person\nand then maybe you actually get excited\nabout divorce because you're like that\nsounds awesome i do want to get this\ndivorce right so it can take something\nthat seems positive and turn it into\nnegative right so what's the best that\ncould happen is the next question and\nthen the last question is what is my\nnext best step to make me feel better\nright now\nright what is my next best step to make\nme feel better right now what action can\ni take to make me feel better right\nso for me\nwhat it was i was like okay if i'm\nlooking at all these things i put down\nall of the action plans of exactly what\ni needed to do in all of those 17\ncategories all the stuff that that i\nneeded to do i was like oh okay yeah i\ncan do this tomorrow morning once you\nknow once everybody wakes up and i can\nget on the phone calls and i can\nnegotiate and do all the stuff i can get\nmy team on it as well\nso i was like okay i'm looking at all\nthis stuff it's four o'clock in the\nmorning 4 45 in the morning i can't do\nanything about it right now for most of\nthese so what's the next best step for\neach one of these did them okay bought\nit wrote them all down now what i'm\ngoing to do the next best steps to make\nme feel better right now\ni was like what's the next best step\ni need to meditate i need to focus on\nwhat i'm grateful for because i have so\nmuch to be grateful for in my life like\nit's amazing and i'm focusing on these\nthings that are kind of trivial and you\nknow i'm not saying all of people's\nthings that they're stressing out about\nare trivial like mine happen to be but\nit's not going to ruin my life in these\ncircumstances so i was like you know\nwhat i need to focus on gratitude\nbecause if i come from a place of\ngratitude if i come from a place of love\nequanimity peace\ni'm going to\ngo into all of these 17 things and feel\nbetter\nso i was like all right i'm going to\nmeditate i'm going to focus on gratitude\nyou know maybe for you guys it might be\nlike okay i need to have a conversation\nwith this person that's the very first\nthing i need to do right now right maybe\nit's like i need to go work out i need\nto go for a run\ni need to call a friend i need to call\nmy business partner because this thing\nthat happened to us has really been\nstressing me out and i haven't had the\nconversation need to that's why i'm\nstressed out you know what\nscrew it i'm gonna have the conversation\nright now\nright because then what happens is i've\nidentified my anxiety culprit\nright i've shined the light on it i've\nidentified what could happen the worst\nthat could happen i've identified the\nbest that could happen\nand now i have the action that i need to\ntake in order to make me feel better\nand by doing all of this at literally 4\n45 5 o'clock in the morning made me feel\nso much better and i went from not being\nable to fall asleep to okay i've got\neverything on a piece of paper it's all\nready to go\nas soon as i can start doing work in the\nmorning i was like i'm going to put on\nmeditation i'm going to feel some\ngratitude\ni'm going to try to make myself feel\nbetter and i i i consciously breathed\nfor 20 minutes and i was consciously\nand when i was breathing i was going i'm\ngoing to feel my body relax with every\nsingle out breath for 20 minutes i was\nlike i'm gonna consciously feel my body\nand i went from this this high\nvibrational buzzing state of like oh my\ngosh anxiety stress stress anxiety\ntwo calm peace felt amazing\nwhat happened\nfell asleep\ni was like whoa\nwake up a couple hours later on my couch\ndid my morning routine i got my journal\ni looked at all of the things\nand then one by one started knocking out\nevery single one of them and had a super\nfreaking productive day\nand all of the anxiety around everything\nwas gone all of the stress around\neverything was gone\nwhy because it was all in my head i\nneeded to take it out of my head i\nneeded to shine a light on it i needed\nto work through what's the worst that\ncould happen the best that could happen\nand what is the immediate steps that i\nneed to do right now to make myself feel\nbetter so i woke up i did my morning\nroutine i got my journal looked through\nall of the stuff that i had started\nknocking everything out\nbecause i had my action plans i had\nexactly what needed to be done\nbut the most important part was number\none identifying\nwhat was going on\nexcuse me\nthen what did i do after that i actually\nwent\nyou know what i'm gonna write it all\ndown i took it all out of my head and i\nput it down on a piece of paper\nright get it out of your head\nput it down\nso you're not not trying to grab water\nanymore so you're not trying to punch\nthat person in the dark flip the light\non see the person and go up there it is\nthat's the thing that i need to work\ntowards\nso know that when you're feeling anxious\nthoughts there is a strategy to get out\nof it this is the four steps the four\nquestions to ask yourself\nnext time you feel stressed worried fear\nanxiety any of those negative feelings i\nwant you to use this try it and i\nguarantee it'll make you feel better i'm\ngonna give you my number one tip for\novercoming anxiety\nand i'm gonna be honest with you it's\nactually way more simple than you could\nthink\nbut that doesn't mean that it's easy\nit's actually even though it's so\nridiculously simple i know that for a\nmajority of people listening to this\nit's going to be really hard for you to\nactually do this to relieve your anxiety\nand i'm going to be completely honest\nwith you recently i've been so freaking\nbusy i've been spinning so many plates\nwe have so many events that are coming\nup we're hiring new people we're\ncreating new programs we're making sure\nthat we give our clients who are\ncurrently paying us the best possible\nexperience that they can i'm on lives\ni'm talking to people i'm coaching\npeople all of this stuff it's literally\nlike a rocket ship and with a rocket\nship it's all good stuff but if not kept\nat bay it can creep up on you to be like\na holy [ __ ] moment there's a lot going\non and i'm kind of stressed out about it\nand\nfor me i noticed the anxious thoughts\nstarting to creep in and so that's what\ni'm going to tell you is what i've been\ndoing over the past couple weeks to kind\nof keep them at bay but especially not\njust me but with all of the stuff that's\nhappening in the world right now all of\nthe uncertainty of\nwhat's going on is the virus still here\nis it are we staying in lockdown we're\nin lockdown we're not in lockdown we're\nback and locked down again are we\nwearing masks we're not wearing masks\ncould i die from this there's so much\nanxious thoughts that are coming from\nthis this is going to help so many\npeople if you can just do this in your\nbrain even though you're trying to keep\nit at bay your brain's constantly in the\nbackground thinking is this happening is\nthis not happening am i safe am i not\nsafe how should i do this how should i\nwalk [ __ ] how should i am i able to walk\nup to person shake their hand are they\ngoing to be and there's so many things\nso many variables that are just all over\nthe place for people i'm going to teach\nyou how to try to keep those things at\nbay and how to calm them down so that\nyou can operate at the highest level\npossible for you and before i tell you\nmy secret there's one thing that it's\ngonna piss a lot of people off it's\nmaybe not piss people off it's gonna\nmake you sad one thing that makes it\nabsolutely worse\nis caffeine i said it yes your coffee if\nyou have anxious thoughts throughout the\nday if you feel really way too stressed\nthroughout the day and you're drinking\ncoffee in the morning it is making it\nway\nworse way worse so i would recommend if\nyou're having anxious thoughts if you're\nhaving you know if you're getting\nanxiety if you're getting some little\nbit of feels like you're a little bit\ndepressed so that you're sad or that\nyou're super freaking stressed out wean\nyourself off of coffee for a little\nwhile right if you can't go cold turkey\nand you gotta wean yourself off switch\nfrom from coffee to when you're making\ncoffee do half decaf half caffeinated\nand try that out for a little while and\nif you can't do that\ngo green tea\njust do something that has less caffeine\nso it you can start to not be so\ndependent on it you'll notice your\nstress levels your anxiety levels go\ndown a ton so let me tell you what i've\nbeen doing it's super simple but it is\nridiculously profound once again just\nbecause it's easy\nand it's simple doesn't mean that it's\neasy to do and to make yourself do and\nif you're dealing with anxious thoughts\nthis definitely won't be easy but it's\nworth it and it works here's what it is\ni've been breathing\nand you guys are listening to me are\nprobably like no sh we all have right\nbut i don't mean just breathing i mean\nextremely intentional breathing and if\nyou've ever been on a live with me\nbefore if you've ever been on a zoom\ncall\na facebook live a live event i try to\nstart every single meeting that i do\nevery single morning when we do our team\ncalls we start off with breathing every\nsingle time that we get everyone\ntogether for our mastermind we start all\nof it with breathing and i'm gonna go\nmuch deeper into what i do the reasons\nwhy i do this the science behind it for\nall of you analytical skeptics that are\nout there i'm gonna go through all of\nthese things in just a minute\nbut i want you to try this with me okay\nwe're gonna do something that we've\nnever done before in a podcast we're\ngonna breathe together and don't turn me\noff and be like oh i know how to breathe\ntrust me with this right there's a lot\nof science behind this if you're hanging\nout at home or you're in a good place\nyou can close your eyes while you do\nthis if you're driving your car don't\nrecommend closing your eyes and\nbreathing with me but you can still\nbreathe all of this will take about one\nminute okay\nhere's what we're gonna do you and i are\ngonna do six deep breaths together okay\nreason why is because there was a a\nchinese study that was done not too long\nago and they found that if you do six\nreally deep slow intentional breaths\nthat it can completely change your state\nbecause the breathing changes your heart\nrate and your heart rate changes the the\nbreathing and your heart rate both of\nthose together change the hormones that\nare put into your body so instead of\ncortisol and adrenaline which can be\nvery stressful it can start to calm\nyourself down and give you some dopamine\nsome oxytocin some serotonin the things\nthat start to calm you down and so\nhere's what we're going to do we're\ngoing to breathe in through the nose you\ndon't need to do it with me yeah i'll\ncount it with you we're going to breathe\nin through the nose\nand when we exhale we're going to exhale\nthrough the mouth now\nwhen you do this on your own\nit's really important to try to make\nyour inhale and your exhale as long as\nyou possibly can and so when you do it\nyou could breathe in the nose and go\nand then breathe out and go\nif you wanted to but actually what you\nwant to do is you want to try to take\nyour lips and make the smallest hole\nthat you possibly can and breathe out\nand that will actually slow down the\nbreathing process and there's a fact\nit's literally a fact that when you you\nstart to do a long exhale that it\nactually makes your your heart start\nbeating slower and when your heart\nstarts beating slower obviously that\nwill calm me down we're not going to do\nthat you can't do it if you want to but\nin a typical time when you're doing\nthese 60 breaths it'd be more of\nand you just let it out as slow as you\npossibly can but for time's sake just\nbreathe with me instead we're gonna do a\nlittle bit different okay so if you can\ndo it close your eyes if you can't close\nyour eyes don't close your eyes but i'm\ngoing to count you through all you got\nto do is just breathe with me so inhale\nthrough the nose exhale through the\nmouth so inhale\nexhale\ninhale\nexhale\ninhale\nexhale\ninhale\n[Music]\nexhale\ninhale\nexhale\nand last one inhale\nand exhale\nokay\nhow do you feel\ndo you feel a little bit better\ndo you feel a little bit calmer do you\nfeel a little bit less anxious a little\nbit less stressed\nright it's literally just breathing but\nit is intentional breathing is obviously\nwhat's important now here's the\nimportant things as as you go through\nthis what we didn't do is we didn't even\ngo a little bit more advanced the more\nadvanced is when you breathe in i want\nyou to breathe in to your stillness find\nthe stillness that you can in your\nbreathing in and in your exhale what i\nwant you to do is i want you to breathe\nout the [ __ ] breathe out the stress\nbreathe out the worry breathe out the\nto-do list breathe out the thoughts\nbreathe out all of those things i want\nyou to just try to connect to the\nstillness that is inside of you do you\nfeel different\ni know if you did it right you probably\ndo even if you didn't do it right you\nprobably still feel different slow\nintentional breathing has been shown\nscientifically to reduce anxiety and\ndepression inside of people don't\nunderestimate the power of your\nbreathing i'm gonna go deeper into\ntelling you guys what i've been doing\njust besides that to help you guys out\nwith the anxiety and anxious thoughts\nand stress and worrying all about stuff\nbut if you just look at what's important\nto humans right like food for instance\nyou cannot eat food for weeks you can go\nwithout food for weeks and still live\nwater\nyou can go a couple days without water\nbut breath\nmaybe a couple minutes so if we're\nranking breath water food\non the important scale what's the most\nimportant\nclearly breath is breath is the first\nthing to change whenever your state\nchanges when you get excited it's\nclinically shown that the very first\nthing to change in somebody during\nexcitement is the breath inside of\nsomebody when you get anxious feelings\nwhen you feel anxiety the very first\nthing to change in you before your\nhormones before your thoughts any of\nthose things is your breath when you\nfeel fear the very first thing to change\ninside of you is your breath and so what\ndo we do is if we want to change our own\nstate we intentionally change our\nbreathing to intentional breathing\nand that's how you bring your body back\nto normal since i've been telling you\ni've been so freaking busy and a little\nbit anxious and stressed out over the\npast week how have i been using this\ni've been sitting down and forcing\nmyself to not just do 60 breaths but to\ndo this as long as possible until i can\nfeel\nthat the anxious thoughts\nthe stress the worry the fear whatever's\npopping up in my head is going away\nuntil i feel different and if i'm being\nhonest with you it usually takes about\n20 25 30 minutes to feel this way this\nis the hard part about it this is why\npeople have so much struggle\nto meditation is because there's so much\nanxiety that comes up so many anxious\nthoughts the to-do lists the fears all\nof those things come up\nand it's basically like your\nsubconscious your ego fighting against\nyou to\nyou know\nthe easiest way to think about it is if\nyou put a child to bed the little kid\nwill fight and fight and fight to going\nto bed even though they're they they\nneed to go to bed and they're wanting to\ngo to bed and they're angry and they're\ncrazy because they are so tired\nthey fight to not go to bed and that\nfighting and staying up makes them even\nmore angry and even more emotional\nthat's exactly what happens when you sit\ndown when you're anxious and you try to\nmeditate all of the anxious feelings\nwill do everything that they can to make\nyou not sit down and meditate and so\nwhat you want to do when you sit down i\nliterally have been doing this every\nmorning for about 25 minutes and i can\nfeel myself start to get even more\nanxious during the first five 10 15\nminutes of meditation and then\neventually my body kind of calms down\nand it's like okay we're not going to do\nthis we're going to chill and so what\nyou want to do is you can either feel\nthe breath going in your nose and out of\nyour mouth in your nose out of your\nmouth and just pay attention that\nfeeling or what i've been doing is\nfeeling the muscles around my stomach i\ncan feel the muscles on my stomach when\ni breathe in i can feel them go out\naround my diaphragm and when i breathe\nout i can feel them going in and all i\nsay is breathing in in my head i'm\nsaying breathing in\nand breathing out\nand breathing in\nand breathing out and your mind will\nwander it'll go all over the place it'll\ntry to fight it'll try to say no this\nisn't what you should be doing but just\nlike you know like i know that for for\nour puppy he goes crazy sometimes he\nbites toby and toby's 12 years old and\nour puppy's eight years old eight months\nold and he goes crazy on him and we have\nto train him not to do those types of\nthings so what we'll do is we'll hold\nhim in place and be like no that's not\nwhat you do and he'll fight in a fight\nand fight in a fight and fight and then\nshe's like\nand he literally does a breath if you've\never noticed when your dog goes to lay\ndown what do they do they go\nand they breathe out that's what dogs do\nto calm themselves down so you have to\nrealize that you have to sit there and\nyou have to fight through the anxious\nfeelings because you're going to feel\nmore anxious when you sit down to\nbreathe promise you that and so what i\ndo is i do this breathing\nslow in through the nose slow out\nthrough the mouth\nfor 15 20 30 minutes sometimes 45\nminutes at a time and i can feel myself\nfight it and fight it and fight it and\nfight it and fight it and fight it and\nfight it and eventually it's like\nand it just kind of gives out and what\nam i doing i'm destroying the anxious\nthoughts i'm getting rid of the anxious\nthoughts i'm getting rid of the stress\ni'm getting rid of the fear i'm getting\nrid of the worry anything that's going\nthrough my mind i'm telling my mind i\nwill not allow you to act the way that\nyou're acting because anxiety and stress\nand worry and fear all come from your\nthoughts\nthey do and so i'm telling my mind i'm\nnot going to allow you to do this i'm\nnot going to allow you to do this i'm\nnot going to allow you to do this and\nit's going to fight and it's going to\nfight it's going to fight it's going to\nfight and it's going to go all right\nfine\nand it might take 15 to 20 minutes to\neven get to the all right fine but if\nyou don't want to feel anxious anymore\nthen that's just something that you need\nto do it's not that you don't have\nenough time it's just that you're not\nwilling to do it don't ever say that i\ndon't have enough time just say it's not\na priority right so if you're wanting\nto stop being so anxious if you're\nwanting to calm down if you're wanting\nto stop worrying\nit comes from your your breath because\nyour breath is in charge of every\nfeeling that you have and you break\nthrough those feelings and that's what\nyou're trying to conquer is those\nanxious thoughts the worry the stress\nthe fear the feelings\nyou're just trying to get all those to\nsubside and eventually you'll find a\nplace where you'll be in and it might\ntake you some time but you'll go you\nknow what\ni feel pretty good i feel like this\nbreathing exercise is done you don't\neven have to call it meditation because\ni guess it's not even meditation it can\nbe if you want it to be or you can just\nsay you know what i'm just going to\nbreathe i'm not going to put any time to\nit all i'm going to do is i'm going to\nwait until my anxious thoughts my stress\nmy worries my fears all of those things\nsubside and then i'm going to give\nmyself a few minutes to rest in that\npiece and know that i can always come\nback to this piece and when you do this\nyou'll realize that your day is\ncompletely different\ncompletely different so you do this when\nyou first wake up because that's usually\nwhen your cortisol is at the highest\nwhich means you're stressing out which\nmeans that you're worried that you have\nanxious thoughts that's when it's the\nhighest for me cortisol is usually\nactually what wakes you up and cortisol\nis the stress hormone so i feel it in\nthe morning so i force myself to calm\ndown i force myself i'm going to be the\none that's in charge of my brain i'm not\ngoing to let my brain be able to do\nwhatever it wants to do i'm going to\nwrangle it and i'm going to make it calm\ndown and i'm going to get rid of my\nanxious thoughts my feelings my worry my\nstress by simply going back to the\nbreath this is something that you can do\nat any moment at any time anywhere in\nthe world\nthroughout the day this is something\nthat will make you more powerful because\nwhen you can control your mind you can\ncontrol everything else around you but\nonce again it's so simple but it's not\neasy you've got to force yourself to do\nit and you've got to know last thing\ni'll say you've got to know that your\nmind is going to fight you for a little\nwhile and it's going to be really\nfreaking hard to stay still you've got\nto go against those feelings and\neventually like a child who's just\nfighting not to go to bed eventually\nthey're going to fall asleep and\neventually your feelings are going to\nsubside\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well you\never felt like i can't fully allow\nmyself to be in this moment because\nthere is a chance that one day it's\ngoing to be gone\n[Music]"
