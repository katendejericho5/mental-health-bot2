of myself\n[Music]\nwelcome everybody to the mindset mentor\npodcast i am excited to bring you my\nguest today who i'm super interested\nabout which is crazy because we've been\nfriends for a little while now i've\nnever researched you and i was like i\ngotta research him because i'm gonna be\ninterviewing him this week and we were\njust talking about before the cameras\nwent on we're like this guy has\nliterally been in every single industry\nyou've done everything in your life and\nthe fact that you're 41-42 i'll be 42 in\njuly 42 in july\nand you have the story that you have\nit's pretty remarkable so\ngaren jones everybody i'm excited to\nbring you\ngaren jones and uh i want to dive in and\ni want to talk about your childhood\nfirst you've told me some crazy stories\nwhen i've been hanging out at your house\nand you've got i mean you could write a\nthere should be a movie on you for all\nof the different crazy stories you've\nhad as a kid like there's going to be a\ngaren jones movie one day yeah and uh\nand so tell us a little bit about\nyourself so people who don't know who\nyou are so you can get a little bit of\nan idea of who you are\nso um i was born and raised in missouri\ncity texas um\nfamily didn't come from money parents\nsplit up when i was four years old\nmy father was murdered when i was 12.\nthat's when i just decided i don't care\nabout anything and that's when i got\ninto\nbreaking breaking into cars breaking\ninto houses and just doing whatever with\nno regard\nuh to responsibility because after my\ndad died it was like a part of me died\nand i just didn't care\nand that just carried on into high\nschool\nbut somehow i had a knack to run track\nand be really fast and\nthat was the that was the silver lining\nthat just kept me going i probably\nwouldn't have made it out of high school\nschool\nif it hadn't been for track and field\nand then um you know i i always had\ndreams to be a model and people people\ncalled me crazy when i was a little kid\nbut i was like man one day i'm gonna be\na model i'm gonna do tommy hilfiger and\none day i'm gonna be on tv one day i'm i\njust always saw that but coming from\nmissouri city that's not normal like\npeople\nthere's a lot of really talented people\nfrom where i'm from\nthey're getting the shine now because of\nlike\nentertainment like rap and things like\nthat but anything outside of that really\ndidn't make it outside of that city\nand so i was looked at as the crazy\nkid\nwho man you're like an alien bro you\njust talk about stuff that makes sense\nto nobody but i always knew that i was\nsupposed to\ndo the things that i'm now doing\num\nand um you know i\ni was in and out of juvenile several\ntimes one time i had a stint\nsix and a half months and after\ni got out of juvenile i was supposed to\ngo to tyc which is a prison for\nteenagers and then after i got out of\ntyc i was\nalso being tried as an adult at the age\nof 15 because i got busted for 62\nfelonies\nbreaking two felonies yeah but here's\nwhat i want people to see\non the surface right was 62 felonies\nbut below\n[Music]\nwas a little kid who was driven\nto succeed at something\nand energy cannot be created nor\ndestroyed it can only be transferred i\njust wasn't aware of where to put this\nenergy so i put it into chasing women i\nput it into cheating on tests i put it\ninto track and field which i succeeded\nat all of them\nand um you know it's it's it's like\nlearning a language you don't just stop\nlearning english once you've already\nbeen domesticated with it so my\nupbringing was that of\nuh just trying to thief trying to uh get\naround without working hard\num\nand just just having no\nregard for\nthose who came before me disrespecting\npeople cheating on women\num you know as i started getting older\nthat never stopped\nso\na big part of my childhood was a a\ndirectionalist\nlittle kid\nwho\nwas driven and didn't know where to\npoint the energy it's interesting\nbecause uh\ni've heard you talk about and you just\nstarted saying it's it's like a language\nlike poverty is kind of like a language\nyou were you were raised in this\nsituation you just i've always thought\nabout it i've always thought to myself i\nwas lucky where i was able to see we\ndidn't have any money you know my mom\napplied for food stamps but you can't\nget food stamps when you got a car for\nsome reason so we never were able to get\nit and\none thing that i did have though and it\nwas being able to see\nmy uncle who was very successful yeah\nright and i was able to see it\ni was able to see my father and him\npassing away at 15 when i was 15 from\nhim being an alcoholic and all the the\nthe stuff that he went through because\nhe didn't overcome his traumas of his\nfather killing himself when he was 12\nand walking in the room and seeing it\nbut then on the other side i saw my\nuncle dan and he was a successful guy i\nhad 200 employees all of this stuff and\ni saw\nthat there were other options and what\nyou're kind of saying is where you were\ngrowing up there was no other options it\nwas like this is if you were to grow up\nin spain you'd speak spanish but if you\nwere to grow up where you grew up yeah\nthat poverty and what you saw was\nbasically a language that you just spoke\nand that went through your head at all\npoints in time yeah and that also speaks\nto the power of community too\num but the things that i did have access\nto\nis\ni saw and even though i felt like my\nbrother never liked me because he pretty\nmuch disowned me when i was a kid\ni saw him fall in love with\nskateboarding\nand he studied film and he practiced and\ni didn't know what that and you can't\nchange what you're not aware of but if\nit's ingrained in there it's somewhere\nin your subconscious mind so\ni saw that\num i have a um um my uncle he was gay\nbut i didn't know what that was when i\nwas four and five years old so he used\nto wear bright colors and he was very\nexpressive and he would just dance all\nthe time if you anybody knows anything\nabout me thank you i am loud i wear a\nbright color yeah and\nvery unashamed like lit una\napologetically you know who that came\nfrom your uncle duane yeah but i had i\nhad no idea i was just exposed to the\npeople that i was exposed around and so\ni'm forever grateful for my uncle dwayne\nbecause\nwhat he taught me\nis what people struggle with today is\nbeing open-minded and my best friend was\nmuslim my other best friend was jewish\nmy mom went to a methodist church and\nthe people at my school went to a\nbaptist church and i fell in love with\nthe um with a non-denominational so i\nwas so exposed to my favorite uncle who\nwas gay and then uh my best friend who\nwas muslim so\nfrom a little kid i always had some\nrespect for mine to just be able to\nreceive people for who they are and\nbe authentically me for sure\ni didn't know that i'd get paid for that\ndown the line\nbecause a lot of people are stuck in\nthat domestication of this is how it is\nand my dad was like this well my dad\nwasn't around my mom was always at work\nand my brother pretty much disowned me\nso i pretty much raised myself along\nwith the streets but i definitely wanted\nto speak into that language you think\nabout how it's ingrained\nyou you go gaga gugu then you learn the\nabcs then\nyou keep on harping on the basics then\nthat turns into\num uh words sentences paragraphs essays\nbooks libraries so imagine a household\nof insecurity lack of worthiness\nauthenticity and all these different\nthings this is what little kids\nwithout even knowing\nthis is how their domestication\nshapes their future and i say all the\ntime\nadults are deteriorated children until\nyou see that you can create a different\noutcome for your life\nso where does that take you so you know\nyou're in juvenile what happens after\njuvenile because you you talk about\nmodeling you talk about yeah but there's\na whole lot of stuff that's happening\nbetween there so\nso you uh you went from there you lived\nin a car for for two years you've been\nyou've been in prison a french prison\nyep so what are what are the stories\nbehind all these because you've done\neverything that you could possibly do it\nseems so\ni kept on with the language\nof\nlooking for cheap ways to get around\nthings and never you know just\nbut more than anything\ni always\nwas seeking\na place of belonging i always i never\nfelt like i belonged anywhere so i tend\nto hang out with the people that were\nshowing me love when i was a little kid\nthe people that would show me love were\nthe people that got in trouble all the\ntime\nwell you fast forward five ten years\nand that's still the same\ncharacterization of my life\nby nature when i'm around that\nenvironment it's like a safe environment\nfor me\nso\nwhen i was in juvenile\nand i remember because i didn't start\npuberty until i was 18 years old so i\nwas a little kid for a long time when i\nwas in juvenile everybody said to me i\nwas like\nwhat are you doing in here you look too\nnice\nbut i was so fearless like i would do\nthe stuff that no one would do without\nhesitation\nfor the sake of somebody's going to\nrecognize me and and say oh great job\nbecause i never heard you matter you're\nspecial you're important when when i was\na little kid\nso i'm in juvenile and i remember my\nprobation officer\nuh officer said to me he said he goes\nyou know garen there comes a time in\nyour life where you hit a fork in the\nroad\nand you can either turn left\nor you can turn right\nand he looked me in the eye\nand he said\nor you can hit the brick wall\nhe said garen you've hit the brick wall\nhe said i'll see you in prison\nand i never forgot that\nand i still kept up with the crime and\nstuff like that but i never forgot what\nhe said hey let me tell you about my\nfavorite drink that i drink first thing\nin

to figure out my life and i knew\nthat i wasn't supposed to be in missouri\ncity i knew i was meant to go somewhere\nelse i knew that since i was a little\nkid so i left i went to i was in los\nangeles trying to figure life out\ni ended up\nsigning a record deal with a guy in ohio\nthat i met\nin los angeles which it made no sense to\nleave that music capital and then go to\nohio at that time nothing was popping\nout of there\nand\ni go there and he promises\npromises us this big\ncontract and you can stay on the other\nside of my house and i'm like oh my god\nwe get to go to is a group and the name\nof our singing group was called soldier\nand he's like we get to go on the other\nside of the house man we get to the\nhouse and it was like hell's day\neverything that he said was a lie his\nfather was a\nhe was like a a a pastor but he's like\nfunneling this criminal type stuff and\ni'm just like what is happening you know\nhow i signed the contract\nit was a plastic machine gun on the\ntable\nand he literally said you know why it's\nplastic and i said why\nbecause if i use it i can melt it no one\nwill ever find out\nso i ended up signing my life away\nmm-hmm legit signing my life away\nand in this moment i was like\nwhat's happening i'm 18 years old\nwhat is this\nand i still wasn't aware\nso i still kept\nchasing women still kept doing like\nlittle petty things because i just\ndidn't know i had i lacked major\ndirection\nand even how i got out of that situation\nwe were in miami for this event called\nthe impact he wanted us to take his gun\nhome because he couldn't take it on the\non the plane flight so we took we were\nwe had the briefcase and the gun and\nwe're driving and i said stop the car\ni'm not going back to ohio they're like\nhe's gonna kill us i was like how we got\nhis gun i'm not going back to ohio\nnow i didn't know at the time but i was\nleading\ni was influencing\npeople in a certain way i said i'm not\ngoing back to ohio let me out of the car\nno phone\nno money\nno car\nwhat do i do\ni start walking with determination to\ngod knows where\nthey stop the car come back\nand then we start to go back to la so i\nthink my confidence and where i was\ngoing was much stronger than their lack\nof confidence in going back to an area\nwhere they were fearing for their life\nwe opened up the\nthe\nthe briefcase and all of our contracts\nwere in there i was like [ __ ] that like\nso we we um burn up the contracts throw\naway the gun come back to la that's when\nmy l.a starts i was like i gotta figure\nsomething out\nand so i enrolled in the santa monica uh\ncommunity college met two roommates\nthere and i was like i need a place to\nstay because i was staying with my\ncousin marcus at the time and i was like\nbut it was just he was he was way too\nstrict\ni need a place to stay stay with these\ntwo like japanese girls from okinawa\nthey could barely speak english and we\nwere all sleeping in the same bed\nnothing sexual but it was just like yo\nthis is like wild like how am i in this\nsituation right someone said i should\nmodel\nget it i'm six one now but at the time i\nwas five foot nine\nand they were joking around don't joke\naround with me because i'm gonna\nactually prove you wrong\nso i i literally went to every single\nagency there was in los angeles starting\nwith the easiest ones first ford and\nwilhelmina the hardest ones last i got\nrejected every single day for four days\nand on the last day i was like\nyou know what\nit's not worth it a little voice came up\ninside of me and says\nyou come this far keep going\nso i go in that room and i'm watching at\nleast 75 guys who i feel look way better\nthan me i'm like they've already got two\nblack guys on the wall and at that time\nthey only took two or three black people\non any fashion wall dark skin guy light\nskin guy the one light skin guy with the\nthe bright eyes and the big hair\non every single high fashion model wall\nthey already had that\nso my insecurity i have no abs i have no\nbook i have no car i don't look like a\nmodel i don't look like anybody in here\nso that's what had me walk away so i\nwalk up and it was my turn after\neverybody got maybe 10 seconds of\nlooking time with the agent everybody\ngot rejected i'm like you know what [ __ ]\nit\ni'ma just be me\ninside of that breath and i go in there\nand they're looking at me and it's\nlonger than 10 seconds i'm like\nthey're like huh\nand he goes away\ntakes my polaroid in my little bird\nchest\ncomes back with two other agents\nand i'm like\nand he goes we'd love to represent you\nyou don't look like anybody\nso my insecurity\nwas the uniqueness not my actual\ninsecurity but what i felt was my\ninsecurity\nbecause i don't look like anybody was\nthe thing that they were looking for\nthey sent me on a destiny's child jump\nand jumping uh\nvideo audition to be the lead role uh\nbeyonce's boyfriend they sent me on a\nbuckle campaign and skechers campaign i\ndidn't have a car i could only make two\nof them i made the buckle and sketchers\nand i didn't want to tell them i'm like\ndamn\ni finally got a shot i don't want to\ntell them i didn't even go to the\naudition\nfirst thing in the morning\ndavid calls me and says congratulations\nyou booked all three jobs can you even\ngo to the third one i didn't go to girl\ni was like wait a second\ni was like even the destiny's child\nvideo i'm like damn he's like yeah be up\nbecause b i didn't know beyonce was with\nthe agency she's with wilhelmina\nbeyonce just happened to walk into the\nagent agency yesterday and she\nhand-picked your card\nas her love interest in the destiny's\nchild jumping jumping video you could\ncheck it out you felt good about\nyourself\ni bet you felt good about yourself\nso good and i was 7 7 500 richer from\nhaving no money plus i booked the\nskechers campaign five thousand dollars\nplus a book the um sketchers and the\nbuckle campaign forty five hundred\ndollars so instantly in one day\nthirteen thousand dollars\nmy mind was blown\nand i just kept booking jobs what i\nrealized it wasn't about how i looked\nbut how people felt around me how i was\nlaughing and making people feel seen and\nheard and it was easy to work with me\nand everybody else was like snobby\nbehind the like behind the camera or\nwhen the camera was off\nword was is man garen is so easy to work\nwith you def and\nthe world is so big but it's so small in\nthe industry and every and in this\nindustry\nyou book a lot of jobs\ntwo way three ways three ways\nyou sleeping with somebody\nor\nyou're like\nthe next\ngod's gift to you you're like the most\nunique person on the planet like the\nalbino kid like completely different\nthan anyone is like you're gonna book\nevery job or\nyou have the best personality i wasn't\nthe best looking guy wasn't sleeping\nwith anybody and\nbut\nyou could not out out person\nor personality we were just having fun\nit was like a party every uh every time\nwe did a photo shoot so that's how\nmodeling came about and i just\nthe lesson that i learned in modeling\nwas i went through probably about 14 or\n15 rejections\nbut i was growing through those\nrejections\nso i learned how to grow through my nose\nto earn my powerful yes right\ni always tell people that and that's\nit's it's funny because one thing we\nused to always do when i run sales\noffices is we would have these things\ncalled two week pushes where like we put\neverything in we eat sleep and breathe\n14 days in a row just go at it i'm like\nthe universe is gonna test you at some\npoint in time like to see if you\nactually want it like your car is going\nto break down somebody's going to die\nyou know you're going to get sick you're\ngoing to get the flu there's something\nthat's going to happen and it's like the\nuniverse will always test you to see if\nwhat you're actually going for is is\nsomething that you're really passionate\nabout and for you that's a perfect\nexample like you had to go through a\nbunch of no's most people would have\ngiven up at no number two they wouldn't\nhave kept going right yeah so it's like\nor they wouldn't have even showed up in\nthe first place right so it's like you\nhad to go through showing up\ngetting rejected get a rejection all of\nyour insecurities coming to the surface\nand then going to the very last one\nand having that feeling of\ni just shouldn't even do it and then the\nuniverse spoke inside of you and you're\nlike all right let me go in and you went\nin and you booked it but it happened to\nbe the last one it's the universe\ntesting you at all points in time and\nthat's it's crazy that's that story so\nis that is that before the whole thing\nhappening in france then the the french\nprison yeah so how do you go from you\nknow because everyone's gonna be like\nwell dude this make guys make it so much\nmoney how does he go and and uh get into\na french prison years down the road so\nhere's here here's the deal and it was\nduring the process so you this was\nduring the modeling this was during the\nmodel okay yeah it's wild bro\nso here i am making all this money\nbut just as fast as it's coming in it's\ngoing up i don't have a financial\nadvisor i don't come from money so\nyou end up attracting as far as income\ngoes the level of personal development\nand how you see yourself\ni didn't feel worthy of the money i was\ngetting so as fast as man i was buying i\nhad a little bitty apartment sleeping on\na box spring with a bunch of uh blankets\nbuying a five thousand dollar pair of\ndulcim dolce gabbana spiky shoes right\ni had no\nunderstanding of how money breathes and\nhow money is energy and how you can\nattract it according to the value in\nwhich you first see yourself no idea\nand you can't change what you're not\naware of so while being the\nin the picture frame of my life because\nyou can't it it's like\nyou can't see what's inside of the frame\nwhile you're in the picture\nand um\nso\nhere i am doing all this modeling stuff\nand i meant you could open up magazines\nyou'll see me in wilson's leather you\ncan see me an express man you can see me\nin aniche but in the same magazine it\nwas like man this dude is everywhere you\ncan walk in\nthe mall at one time and i had seven\ndifferent campaigns going gap old navy\ntommy hill figure wilson's leather but\nit was all macy's it was all in the\nmalls at the same time so you're in\nevery single store that you walk by damn\nnear every single one plus\ni had the destiny's child video out\nplus i had the old navy commercial out\nplus i had l'oreal hair commercial out\nthey dyed my hair like burgundy so it\nwas like i was everywhere\nhere's the deal\nbut the money\nthe way in which checks were coming in\nthey weren't coming in every single day\nthey were coming in like six months\nlater and i didn't i never knew what it\nwas like to make instant money\nso here i am at the height of my career\nyou could go and\nyou you could go to times square\nand there was a massive there's whole\nthe movie hulk hole i mean uh incredible\nhulk\nand then there's\nmy billboard that's bigger than the\nincredible hulk billboard\nand i'm just like on top of the world\nalso i had a huge ego at that time i\nwasn't doing any self-development i did\nnot know how to approach life with grace\nand ease and build people up i would\ngossip and all these different things\nbut i didn't know\nbecause see before i did all this i was\nreading a book called the power of\npositive thinking\nby dr norman vincent peale but i read\nthat book over 300 something times\nbetween the paperback and audiobook\nbecause great things kept happening\ni didn't know you're supposed to

prison for a long\ntime\ni was in that prison for a whole year\nbefore i got my first phone call in\namerica you get your first phone call\nright away mm-hmm so imagine one year\nmost people thought i'd die\nwhere you were at all no wow but here's\nthe deal\nbecause it's overseas you write a letter\nthey gotta decode everything in your\nwriting so it took two let two months\nfor a letter to get to my mom mm-hmm so\ni was working through the consulate but\nshe was so wild\nso i'm in there\nand i'm like\nwhat did i do\nin my life like that movie sixth sense\nwhen he didn't know he was dead the\nwhole time and then his whole life just\nflashed before his eyes\nevery single crime i ever committed\nevery shady thing every time i cheated\non a test\nhit me\nwhen i went to prison\ni'm like\nmy life is over\neverything everything is over i'll never\nsee my daughter again\nso after a year i was just kind of just\nkind of coasting\ncoasting coasting coasting coasting\nfinally start picking up books and\neverything\nafter year they sentenced me\nthis was in 2003\nbut it sends me to 2014\nand in europe\nif you appeal\nthey see it as a sign of disrespect and\nthey'll give you more time\nthey give you more time for abuse if you\nappeal well oh yeah it they got a weird\njudicial judicial system out there\nso i'm out there and i'm just like yo my\ni\ni don't know what the [ __ ] i'm gonna do\nlike my life is over\nso here i am\nthen they played something on tv they\nplayed shawshank redemption we're\nallowed to watch it one once a month\nuh\nwatch a movie once so in prison they're\nshowing a movie of people breaking out\nof prison\nyeah reduction out of all the movies\nthey give you it's people breaking out\nof prison so we're watching shawshank\nredemption\nand at this time my life is over\nand tim robbins says one\nchange phrase\ngame for me\nhe says they can take anything they want\naway from me\nbut they can't take away my mind\nboom\ninstantly i was hit i'm like wait\nknow exactly why i'm in prison\nbecause when i was out of prison\nfree\ni used to say every day i feel like i'm\nso far away from where i'm supposed to\nbe i feel like i'm in jail inside of my\nown body i feel like i'm in a prison far\naway from where i'm supposed to be and\nguess what i manifested you're in a\nprison far away from very specific in\nprison\nin europe yeah\nso i said if i can put myself in prison\nyep\nwell then in this moment\ni'm a free man\nso when i said i am a free man\ni then started to think\nwhat would i do in here\nthat i wouldn't normally do out there\ni stop using my dominant hand\ni start using my non-dominant hand\nwhich i didn't even realize was\noperating a different part of my brain i\nstarted creating i mean i was reading\nbook after book after book i learned to\nspeak fluent french i joined the art\nclass i just started doing all these\nthings and\nand and every time i was doing the stuff\nthat i used to love when i was a little\nkid it brought me so much joy\nand the and the inmates were like man\nevery time you sing it makes me feel\nfree so i just kept singing but it it\nwas like what brought me joy\nwas getting out on other people\nand\ni would paint and draw portraits of\nother people's families they were crying\nand they're they're like man\nthank you so much can i give you\nanything\n[Music]\ni'm like nah man i just want you to be\nhappy\nand so i became the kind of person\nwhich i now know was adding so\nmuch value\nthen i started running\nnobody was running all they were doing\nwas like lifting weights and fighting\ndoing drug deals stabbing and [ __ ] like\nthat like i really saw what happens\nwhen humans are suppressed\nand then i just started running a little\nvoice says start running you love to run\nrunning used to make you feel free when\nyou were a kid 30 days\nhalf the inmates running with me\nless fights less drug deals less\nstabbings the warden brought me inside\nme ever since you've been running\nthis place has been peaceful\nkeep doing great work\nremember what i told you what i didn't\nget when i was a little kid\nsomebody acknowledging me for doing so i\njust kept going\nand i became this person that people\ncame to for advice i'm like yo this is\nwild\nhere's the deal\nwhen i felt free\nfelt it's the difference between oh i\nthink i'm free\nbut when i embodied the characteristics\nof freedom which is ultimately doing\neverything that your heart wants you to\nexpress\nespecially when it's been something i've\nthat made me happy when i was a kid when\ni felt free\nout of nowhere\nmind you i'm started serving a 12-year\nsentence\nout of nowhere when i felt free\nthey just called me in the office\nand they said today's your lucky day\nwe retested the drugs which they had no\nreason to because they already tested\nthem three times it was 6.2 kilos of\nheroin they had no reason to retest the\ndrugs two and a half years\nlater retested the drugs\n90 was fake\nfor the amount that was real you've\nalready done the time you're free to go\nhome\nshut up\nso what you're telling me\nis when you were out of prison before\nyou went into prison you were in a\nprison of your own mind\nwhen you were in in that created\nyou being in a prison eventually you've\nbecause i've been around you and you can\ntell like your energy your\nyou manifest stuff like if there's even\npeople out there just like oh yeah i\ndon't understand the word manifestation\nstuff like you're constantly manifesting\nstuff you manifest yourself in a prison\nfar away from where you should be\nthen when you're in there you start\nsaying i am a free man i am a free man\nand we can dive into and i've talked\nabout many times the power of just the\nphrase i am\nuh you said i'm a free man i'm a free\nman and you started doing things you\nsaid okay if this got me into prison let\nme do the exact opposite of everything\nthat i've ever done and you started\ndoing all these things you've lit up the\nlittle child that's inside of you\nand because of that it created the\nfreedom there was no reason why somebody\nshould ever retest drugs two and a half\nyears down the road and find out that it\nwas 90 fake and then you automatically\njust get out like that you were\nliterally able to create yourself into\nprison then you're literally able to\ncreate yourself out of prison\nin losing\nmy freedom\ni discovered my freedom\nso maybe the universe needed to\nremove\nall of the things i gave power to so\nthat i can remember where the power\nbelonged\ninside of myself but i was still unaware\nof all this stuff yeah so you can still\nget a result being unaware but if you're\nunaware you cannot articulate what's\nactually happening\nor use it okay\nno it's just happening so i'm just like\ndoing stuff i'm reading books i'm being\nreally kind i'm motivating people i'm\ndrawing art and doing all this stuff but\nwhile i'm in there i've wrote all these\nbecause when the mind is\nquiet who you really are shows up\nyour higher self literally starts\nspeaking\nwell\nwhen you're in a prison\nthere's no\nwomen distraction or traffic or anything\nlike job or anything and you just got a\nlot of time to yourself\nman i started ma\ni read the bible cover to cover\nthree times i read the quran cover to\ncover three times i'm like oh they're\nsaying the same thing underneath i'm\nlike but who really from this world\nreads this and reads this\nit was wild bro i was just feeding\nmyself with information\nwhen i got out\neverything\nbecause it was like an overflow if you\nif i pour\nso much water inside of this and it\nreaches its tipping point it's\neventually going to spill over into the\nnext container\nbut if you pour so much inside of\nyourself which is a container it's\neventually going to spill over into the\nnext container called the physical\nequivalent of your life yeah\ni unconsciously did that so if you look\nat prison\nas if it\nwere woman's womb mm-hmm with\nmy we have a uh my wife is 26 weeks\nwe're 26 weeks pregnant right now so if\nyou\nlook at that prison as if it was a a\nwomb\ni first added value to myself by\ndoing everything that i love not what\neverybody else wanted me to do giving\neverybody else power over my life\ni did everything that i loved\nit was too big for the eye container and\nit spilled over into the y'all container\nand spilled over into the people and\nthen they started doing stuff that they\nlove which was too big for the container\nso that level of value and the overflow\nand overflow was too big for the womb of\nprison so just like a baby what once\ngrew on the inside gets too big for the\nwomb contractions and then it's produced\ninto the next realm called birth\ni feel\nthat\nmy spirit body\ncalled the value and what i was adding\nis too big for that space\nso what once grew on the inside\nwas produced on the outside yeah called\nthe birth of freedom\nso i can articulate because i apply it\nnow i couldn't apply it back then i'm\njust like oh man i was praying and i was\nlucky and this thing happened it was\ncrazy but i also wrote a bunch of songs\nwhile i was in there\ni get out\ngo to los angeles\nmy brother\nyou know he's uh\nhe's\nnot blood brother but that's my brother\nhis name is d-ray davis comedian\nactor\nhe gave me a place to stay\nand he goes\nso what are you gonna do while you're\nhere i was like i'm gonna be a singer\nhe's like you'll be a singer he's like\nyeah he was like i give you\nrides anywhere you go i buy you clothes\nuh you get a free place to stay\nthe only thing is\ndon't come home unless you have a song\nhmm i'm like well i don't know any\nproducers he's like\nyou'll be a singer right\nlike yeah don't come home unless you\nhave a song\nthat started my introduction to myspace\ni knew nothing about myspace and i'm\nlike talking to people on the internet\nweird\nso i put on my half naked body\nand i was like a singer

else to\nsing it wasn't even my style of music\nbut\ngot us on trl and mtv and bet and things\nlike that so\nwe were performing this song and\nit just wasn't my style then i felt\nmyself\ndoing a bunch of music that wasn't my\nstyle\nand i gave my power away to everyone\nelse\nwho wanted me to show up how they\nthought i should show up\nno amount of money could keep me\nin any environment if i can't be\nauthentically myself\nso i ended up leaving the label\nand people called me they're like yo\nwhat\npeople go crazy for an opportunity like\nthis i said but at the expense of me not\nbeing myself\ni'm not putting out this image i'm not i\ndon't want to be on\nyou know yes i do have a pass where i\nrolled around with gang bangers and well\ni rolled around with hardcore people but\ni am i'm that's not that's not me like i\nlove people i wear fun colors i'm very\nexpressive person and things like that\nlike\nmy style of music doesn't have no\nbusiness being on stage\nwith you know the the style of music\nthat i was on stage this makes no sense\nit's not even my core audience\nso i was losing myself so i\nleft got called crazy\nand when i left\ni also left\n400 000 on the table because i never put\nout the album\nwell i spent all the money that i had\nbought me a jeep wrangler cash\nspent spent spent because i still didn't\nknow anything about money i'm like man\nthis patent seems familiar\ni was like well at least i got myself\nand then the hype died down\nthe underground buzz\ndied down\nand at that time i was going by my\nmiddle name\nsteph jones\nstefan that's my middle name but that\nwas my stage name\nand i was like man i got to do something\ndifferent and i was like but all i have\nis my car\nso i stayed in my car no money was\ncoming in even the songs that i wrote\nfor other people\nsometimes they don't get placed\nfour or five years later right i'm\ngetting checks right now right last year\ni got like 23 000 out of nowhere for a\nsong that i wrote 12 years ago i'm like\ngod damn i'm like\ni could have used this back then yeah\nbut when the no money was coming in\nmy girlfriend had broken up with me\num\nbecause i couldn't get my life together\nthe hype died down\ndaughter pretty much disowned me because\ni couldn't get my life together\nmom was dying in the hospital\nfamily was overweight\ni started going in debt i didn't pay\ntaxes\nfor 10 years but they can't get you past\nseven so i owed 250 000\nto the government\nsuper negative\ntried to kill myself twice and it just\nkept going so just as fast the velocity\nthat level of energy that one that i had\nwhen i was a little kid\njust as fast as it went up\nwas just as fast as it went down with\nlike three elephants\nchained to my soul\n[Music]\neight tons\ni mean rocket [ __ ] fast\nso\nthe weight i started putting on this\nweight\nstarted getting depressed didn't have a\nplace to stay too shameful to even go by\nback home because i told people if i\never come back

of la brea and\nhollywood at the mail and more in the\nmail in moore park parking lot\nand our face because it was like\ni felt more safe in that place\n3 43 in the morning august 2011\nthat's when i had that was the moment\nthat's what set up all of this\nokay\ni'm tired of fighting i don't want to\nfight anymore\ni want to be healthy i want to be happy\ni want to be surrounded by nothing but\npositive people and i just want to\ninspire people and i want to make a\nbunch of money but i want the money to\nrepresent something that i passionately\nbelieve in that i would do for free just\nshow me a sign show me a sign\none week later i'm at a gas station and\na homeless guy\ncomes up to me asking me for money and i\nsay you have more money than me\nand the homeless guy said change your\nmindset change your life\nand in that moment right there\nthat six sense moments where your whole\nlife flashed behind and before your eyes\ni had a conscious interrupt\nand i thought about everything\nthe prison the modeling the acting the\nlife growing up\nmind so if my mind is set on something\nthen that's why the result is what it is\nso if i do different\nwith the same circumstance\nmy life will change change your mindset\nchange your life and i just kept on you\nknow\nif you play a song long enough you'll be\nsinging a song your subconscious mind\nwill have you singing that song\nfor the whole month\nmy new song was change your mindset\nchange your life change your mindset\nchange your life change your mindset i\nwill walk up to some a set of escalators\nchange your mindset change your life so\ni take the stairs\ni normally use gel soap change your\nmindset change your life i use bar soap\nnormally i wake up late change your\nmindset change your life i would uh\npractice waking up early i would come\nfrom a family that doesn't know anything\nabout healthy active lifestyle or live\neating nutritious\nchange your mindset change your life let\nme go find some people who are doing it\nlet me surround myself around healthier\nactive lifestyle community let me go\nstop chasing women at a club let me go\nchase a better version of myself\neverything\nwas on the other side of something i\nwould never do in areas of my life where\ni wasn't happy\nand i just kept going and i kept going\nwell at one of these leadership seminars\na guy on stage said when you find a good\nbook\nkeep reading it\nbecause when you stop reading it\nthings from your past start creep i'm\nlike\nthat's what happened\nthe rise and fall\nfrom the acting\nthe highest\nthe modeling the music and i'm like\nthe ego\nthe ego creeped in i allowed the ego to\ncreep in because i didn't choose to keep\nlearning choose to keep growing i didn't\nchoose to surround myself around\npositive people who are up to something\nand it's i made it all about me\n[Music]\nand in that moment i became less me more\nwe\nbut in order to get to we you gotta\nyou gotta be a wee kind of person\n[Music]\nso i picked up the book\npower of positive thinking again and i\nkept reading kept reading kept reading\nand then i was around the healthy active\nlifestyle community well they were\ntalking about goals and dreams and\nretiring their parents and and all these\ndifferent things and i was but by nature\ni just started doing everything that\nthey were doing i dropped 35 pounds put\non 19 pounds of muscle took my body fat\nfrom 16.4 percent down to six percent i\nbut at age 32\ni didn't even think that you could do\nthat then\nso just because my energy i thought it\nwas gone\nbut i was around\nan incredible community of people you\nwere speaking a new language what you\nwere doing i was learning a new language\nlearning a new language you were you\nwent from spain and you decided to go to\ngermany and now you're learning german\njust by being around to learn french to\nspeak fluently not rosetta stone at\nstarbucks once a week one hour a week\ni was actually in france\namongst the french\nthe only american there\na little rusty now because i don't speak\nit every day but i can i can i\nunderstand everything\nso by be it by by way of proximity being\naround\nthe people being around the fire i got\nwarm\nand\ni still have that same\nenergy i finally knew where to put it\ni said before energy cannot be created\nnor destroyed it could only be\ntransferred so i transferred into\nreading books i transferred into\nleadership i transferred into building\npeople up i transferred into learning\nand understanding about money i'm like\noh\nthat's why i kept losing it same reason\nwhy 99 of the people who win the lottery\nlose it because they're not operating on\nthe same frequency as the level of money\nthat they got so the money is coming\nback to meet them at their level of\nself-development and the value in which\nthey see themselves so once i was aware\nof all these things i then went back to\nall these bent benchmarks in my life\nand started connecting the dots and\nseeing what were the commonalities and\nseeing why this happened and that's what\ni decided to even put into my book which\nwas the journey the lessons what i\nextracted how you can place it in your\nlife\nwhat i didn't know\nwas that\nby posting this online\nmy very first message was going to come\nfrom somebody who says by you sharing\nyour real\nuh your authentic testimony i put the\ngun down\nfive messages later\nafter you because i shared my testimony\nabout me living in my car and i just\ncompletely opened it up\nby you sharing your testimony i didn't\ndrive my car off a bridge\n[Music]\ni knew what my mission was and i knew\nwhat my purpose was\nit was to be an example\nof what true freedom looks like\nthank you uncle dwayne\nfor expressing\nwhat free\nlooks like\nthat's for my uncle dwayne he taught me\ni just didn't know\nthat that expression\nwas going to be something\nthat could be an example\nfor the voiceless\nbecause i was the voiceless until i\nspoke until i shared my vulnerability to\nshared my story and then people started\nman i want to pay you to come to this\nschool you want to come to this prison\nyou want to come to this jail you want\nto come speak to these teens you want to\ncome like you want to be on this panel\nyou want to go and do this i'm like yo\nand i'm like yeah i'm\ni have no manager i don't have no pr but\ni'm able to pay this rent\nand i'm making these thousands of\ndollars\nand i'm not even looking for the money\nlike money is great\nhowever it seems that the more people\nthat i am\nimpacting\nthe dollar amount is matching\nit's like the bigger the message\nthe bigger the platform\nbigger the outcome\n[Music]\nso i start\npaying attention to patterns\nbecause i have these significant things\nthat occurred in my life\ni can always pull them to the forefront\nwhen i start noticing certain things\nhappen in my life i'm like ah\nand i can easily go like that because\nthe thing about it is weeds don't need\nanything to grow but time\nso no matter how well you keep up your\ngarden you leave it for there long\nenough\nyou know it'll be time you can brush\nyour teeth for 60 years\nevery day\nstop brushing your teeth for five days\n[Music]\nthe infections will grow\ntake a shower every day 60 years don't\ntake a shower\nso you don't can keep renewing your mind\nstop for five days\nstinky mind stinky life stinky outcome\nso then i started learning about\nbusiness\nbecause it's transferring the energy but\nstill the same power\nsame velocity\nwhenever i get into something\ni don't know how to kind of do it i\ndidn't know how to be a kind of criminal\ni didn't know how to kinda break into\nthose cards when i was a little\nkid\nwhen i go into something i go hard i go\nall the way in\ni went all the way in with my\nrelationship with my wife\nlike\nthat's so i'm all the way in kind of guy\ndo y'all get anything from this\nall the way in\nwill always produce\nvastness of results\nregardless if it's negative or positive\nand it just keeps growing then i move to\naustin being surrounded by\nguys like you and other businessmen that\nare doing things that i'm not but i'm\nalso doing things that they're not and\nwe're all iron sharpens iron building\npeople up and this is the next cut this\nis the next cut in investments in in in\nbusiness and everything however my sweet\nspot\nis sharing my story being vulnerable and\ntelling everybody that you can create a\ndifferent outcome for your life\nand\ndepending on how many people you impact\nthere will always be a blessing on the\nother side for sure yeah you're the\nyou're the the perfect example of your\nmess is your message yeah right you just\nshare your sh and people go oh me too\nand that's what you were put here to do\nyes and you've in so many people it's\nlike the phrase you know jim carrey says\nyou need to fit in in this world and\nmake you invisible you know so many\npeople just want to fit in and just want\nto fit in kind of like you were saying\nwhen you went to the modeling you wanted\nto fit in but they weren't looking for\nsomebody to fit in because they already\nhad that role played yep and you got the\nmodeling the one thing that i that i we\nand it's there's two things actually\nnumber one you're the perfect example of\ni mean\ntony robbins says you underestimate what\nyou can do in a year but people under\noverestimate they could do in a year but\nunderestimated they can do in a decade\nif you think about\nabout a decade ago you were sleeping\ninside of a jeep wrangler getting taken\naway\nand\nnow you have a multi-million dollar\nhouse that you live in it's a decade and\nso people don't don't think about just\nputting in the time and putting in the\ntime just knowing that if it's in the\nright direction events you're going to\nget to wherever they want to go it's\njust a direction all you do is course\ncorrect that's all you did right\nthat's the first thing the second thing\nis being around you and the the thing\nthat i found that's the most obvious is\nmore than most people that i've ever\nbeen around you're so good at bringing\nit out your inner child\nin in no sort of way being ashamed of it\nright like people are ashamed of like\nthe things that we love about being a\nkid and you talk about even being in\nprison you\nyou discovered the things that you used\nto love when you were a kid and that got\nyou out of prison it also is still\ncontinuing to get you paychecks from the\nsongs that you wrote when you were in\nprison right so it's like you discover\nthis little inner kid\ntalk to me about like\nhow that was for you that discovery and\nthen also to just step into it and not\nbe afraid of other people's judgment and\njust go this is me this is my soul this\nis who i truly am and i'm just going to\nput it out there for everybody to see\nso\nbecause you are a 41 about to be 42 year\nold little kid yeah you're 12 yeah 100\npeople see all this stuff that i've been\nable to create\nand they're just like man how do you\njust like do it and you always have this\nendless amount of energy i was like well\nwhat you see is this 41 year old\nbut\nwhat's happening\nwhen i was a little kid i said i wanted\nto be a superhero\ni wanted to have abs like an action\nfigure\nbe stronger than the average man\ni want to save people's lives\ni'm doing\nwhat i wanted to do when i was 5.\nthe modality doesn't matter right give\nme any platform if it has to do\nwith what i always wanted to do you ever\nnotice a kid they don't run out of\nenergy\nso when you're operating from the\nessence of your heart\nthere's like secret jewels there so how\ni discovered this\nit's very interesting\nactually i'm going to just take\neverybody through this it's like i'm\ngoing to get you to answer your own\nquestion\nimagine a little kid\nyour parent\na little kid is coming up to you going\nmom mom mom dad dad dad mom dad dad that\nand you ignore that kid for 20 years\nwhat do you think the relationship is\ngonna be like it's gonna be good\nbecause there's no emotional closure\nif the water if the flower doesn't get\nproper water and\nsunlight that's the nutrients it needs\nfor growth\nso\nwhen the child is not acknowledged\nit starts to it starts to it turns to\nquiet\nthen mean then anger than rage\nthen\nthere is it's like invisible\nif you understand that\nnow imagine\nany time you get a hint for an idea\nsomebody should create that or a man i i\nwanted to do this thing right here and\nor\nsomething that used to bring you so much\njoy when you're a little kid like\nplaying in the rain\nswimming drumming dancing don't think\nabout business in in this sense right\nhere but something that you just\nabsolutely loved\nokay\nwhen was the last time you did it\nnow someone a lady that i spoke to\nshe was like oh i haven't danced and i\njust feel like something is missing i\nhave the job i have the money but\nsomething is missing i was like what did\nyou love when you were like around five\nor six years old\nand her whole body she was like\ni used to love to dance and i don't know\nand it just brought me so much joy and i\nwas like when was the last time you\ndanced she was like about 20 years ago\n[Music]\ni said so imagine\ndance\nwas a spiritual child\nlike it was it's an expression of you\nthat is connected to your inner child\nand every day that goes by is going mom\nmom mom mom dad dad dad imagine if you\nignored that child for 20 years what do\nyou think the relationship would be like\ni feel like something is missing and she\ngoes\ni said ding ding ding ding ding\nyou just found yourself\nbecause\nwe're not just this physical body in\nthis meat suit skin there's actually a\nspirit i feel there's a soul inside of\nhere there's got to be some reason why\ni'm going like this\nand we can conjure up our stories and\nthings that's coming from somewhere\nwell\nwhen it feels dead\nwhen it feels lost and i've been there\nbefore\nso i can speak on my personal experience\nit feels dead it's lost\nwhat's missing is the connection to your\nspirit\nso when you actually honor those things\nthe little kid is like ah let me show\nyou more\nyou tell little johnny johnny you're so\nfast then he starts running faster\nso i can get people to understand\nthat what they're looking for they\nalready have\n[Music]\nthe ideas\nthe creativity\ncomes from the kids\nthat's why they're so creative from ages\none through seven\nthen gets diminished as they get older\nbut if you tap into it i feel like it's\nconnected to your spiritual umbilical\ncord that's a straight route from heaven\nso\nthat in itself right there if people got\nthat\nright there they would experience a\ndrastic shift in any relationship in\nrelationship to money in relationship to\ncreativity their job and their anything\nand you know you got a lot of people\nthat are successful but there are a lot\nof people who are successful and not\nhappy\n[Music]\nthat mm-hmm compensate for sure\nto distract from an area that they've\nignored since they were a little kid\nso what did i do when i was in prison\ni started running\nmy mom says i started walking when i was\n11 and a half months and it takes it\ntake i'm at seven and a half months and\nit takes babies like 11 something to to\ndo something she was like you\nshe was like you're a full-blown running\nbefore most babies are walking\nso running's always been inside of me\nalways\nso when i started running in prison\ni was increasing my joy\nso funny joy to the world the lord has\ncome so it's like i bring joy to the\nworld and it seems like\nmy world is an expression of the joy\n[Music]\nso teaching people how to honor their\ninner child only gets them to remember\nthemselves and when you remember\nyourself to the core\nyou don't have to try to be happy you\nhave to look for happiness you don't\nhave to look for love because because\nit's it's an expression of who you are\nand then you'll attract people\nto the way that you see yourself\n[Music]\nso what you're saying is what everyone's\nsearching for the money the cars the\nhappiness the acceptance is what they\nthink they want\nwhat they truly want is just to find\nthemselves a sense of fulfillment which\nthey\nare the captain of\nstuff on the top\nlook look at me look underneath for us\nall the same [ __ ]\nit's all the same [ __ ] i just really\nneed a man to make me happy i really\nneed this job to make me happy i really\nneed this money to make me happy then\nyou get the [ __ ] you realize that's not\nwhat you wanted\nhappens over and over and over and over\nand over\nso that's why i had to redefine\nwhat i felt like wealth and success was\nmy version of wealth and success\nis to live a life\nof grace joy and ease and when i go to\nsleep at night no voices\nit's peaceful\nand it's calm\nand when i look in the mirror and the\ntruth shows up\nand nobody else is around\ni\nlove what i see\nthat\nmy version of success\nsticking to that one because that one\nwon't put a bullet into his brain\ni don't know if there's a better way to\nend episode than that\nso everybody just so you know gary we\nwere talking about this beautiful book\nthat he has uh it's called change your\nmindset change your life and\nalso has a new podcast yeah so tell us\nyou helped me with it\nrob\nhe helped me with it um so my podcast is\ncalled welcome home\nuh with garen jones and it's everywhere\nwhere podcasts are\nand we have a few episodes up right now\nby the time y'all hear this there's\ngonna be a lot more but i'm basically\njust talking about insights and\nawarenesses that i've either learned\napplied experience\num\njust for people to have\nyou know things that are real from real\npeople\nand um you know i call it welcome home\nbecause like when you really find\nyourself you'll realize that home is not\nthe home until you find home in yourself\nso reminding people of who they are by\ngiving them tools and ways to\nhave these insights to discover their\nown version of freedom and love inside\nof themselves these are things that i\ntalk about and my book is in\nenglish and spanish\nand paperback and we're currently\nworking on the audiobook now um on\namazon\nand um you know i didn't write this\nhuge esoteric book\nthis is my personal experience talk\nabout god talk about spirit talk about\nyou know i got in trouble for\nthere's uh\nyou know i extract a lot of lessons and\ni didn't write it\nto the level of\nmy knowledge\ni wrote it for people who typically\ndon't read books at all so it's a very\nsimple read very simple you can finish\nit in a day\nvery simple there's some pictures in\nthere big words and i made the chapters\nshort however\nthe spirit\nat which it was written\nwas designed specifically for you to\nremember yourself love it yeah got one\nmore question for you that i asked\nso\ni don't know if you've ever heard the\nphrase they say you die twice the first\none\nis the first time the first time is when\nyou stop breathing the second time is\nthe last time someone says your name\nyeah in between those two deaths what do\nyou hope people say about you after\nyou're gone before the last time they\nspeak about you again\nsay that one more time can you say that\none more time in a different way\nso they say you die twice okay first\ntimes when you stop breathing second\ntime is the last time someone says your\nname what do you hope people say about\nyou in between that\nlast time they speak your name and the\ntime that you die\nthe thing about it is\npeople aren't going i i live my life in\nsuch a way that people will never stop\nsaying my name people still talk about\nbenjamin franklin\nhe bingo\nmy dad\ndied when i was 12.\nbut he's still alive because i carry on\nhis message of being able to love no\nmatter what\nand that's something he gave to me when\ni was five\nso my dad's still alive\nbecause\nsoul a soul lives inside of messages\nlike our ancestors are still alive\njust like those trees if one of those\ntrees fall\nthe roots and somehow there'll be\nintegration\nsome how so i\nthere is like the physical death but i\ndon't believe in\nthe kind of death where they're gonna\nsay that be the last time they say my\nname so i'm living my life and making\nand working towards making the kind of\nimpact well they'll mention my name with\nthe greats because of the impact that i\nchose to leave\nuh uh\nwhile i was physically on this earth but\nmy soul will forever live\ndarren jones appreciate you man yes sir\ngood stuff\nthank you for being here\nthat
