    "transcript": "do you think that in your life there\nmight be unconscious priming that's\nhappening around you that you're\ncompletely unaware of we divide as\nhumans we are easy to control be in\ncontrol of your own brainwashing if\nyou're not in control of it yourself\nyou're still being brainwashed\nthe question i have for you is do you\nthink that it's possible that you are\nbeing subconsciously\nprogrammed and you're completely unaware\nof it\ndoes that scare you\nwould it make you pay more attention to\nyour surroundings and every single thing\nthat you did if you were subconsciously\nbeing programmed completely out of your\nawareness well\nyou just might be and i'm going to give\nyou a couple stories that make you\nrealize how possible it is and how\nlittle people understand what's actually\ngoing on so i'm going to give you a\ncouple stories about it one of them\nthere was a study that was done about\nsomething called unconscious priming\nunconscious primary you can google you\ncan look it up if you'd like to but yale\ndid a study to see if they could change\nthe way that somebody feels about\nsomething simply by the temperature of\nthe coffee that they're holding on to\nand so what happened was they had these\nthese\nstudents come in\nthey would come in and the researcher\nwould meet them down on the bottom floor\nand they would say hey good to meet you\nand then what they would do is they\nwould say they'd hop into an elevator\nand they had a lot of stuff in their\nhands and they would notice the\nresearcher would notice that their shoe\nwas untied and what they would do is\nthey would have you know they go hey can\nyou hold my cup of coffee for me real\nquick and so they would hand them the\ncup of coffee they would put their stuff\ndown they would tie their shoe they'd\npick up their stuff and then they get\nthe cup of coffee back from them and\nthen the person that was part of the\nresearch but didn't know that they're\npart of the research at the time that\nwas part of the study that would go in\nand they would read a one-page\nstory and it was just a typical story\nand then they were given a quiz real\nquick quiz at the end of it where they\nwere told to answer questions about the\nperson and you know so they would take\none character from the story in one page\nand then they would answer questions\nabout them and you know all they would\ndo is they would you know answer the\nquestions then they would go and what\nthey realized was this\nwas that even though they had just held\na cup of coffee\nfor about 15 seconds at most it changed\nthe way that they felt about the people\nthat they were reading about about 15\nminutes later so here's what happened\nthe people that were given an iced cup\nof coffee because there was ice cup of\ncoffee that was handed to people and\nthen there was a hot cup of coffee those\nhanded people people that were given the\niced coffee felt that the character that\nthey had the questions about was much\ncolder less social and more selfish\nthe people that were handed a hot cup of\ncoffee for the researcher to be able to\ntie their shoe felt that the person was\nwarmer more social in someone that they\ncould trust\nso let me pause right there\nthese people were given a cup of coffee\none of one set of people were given a\nhot cup of coffee one set of people were\ngiven a cold cup of coffee and across\nthe board statistically the people who\nwere given the cold cup of coffee felt\nthat the person was cold less social and\nmore selfish the people that were given\nthe hot cup of coffee felt that the\nperson was warm more social and somebody\nthey could trust so if they're given\nliterally\n15 seconds of holding on to a cup of\ncoffee and it changes their perception\naround the world around them and\neverything that they think about people\nwhat is happening in your world that is\nchanging your perception\nthink about that for a second how crazy\nis that that just a simple temperature\nof something that somebody holds for 15\nseconds can change the way they feel\nabout people 15 minutes later\nall right i got some more stories i'm\nnot done\nso there was also researchers that went\nin and they had uh students come into a\nroom and they had them answer questions\nor actually come up and see how creative\nthat they could be right and what they\ndidn't realize was that some students\nwent into this room and they were they\nconstantly like three or four times they\nsaw the logo for ibm because ibm was\njust you know it's\nibm is seen as a typical standard\ncompany not very creative but there was\nyou know they said okay we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna put something up\non the board and they'd turn the\ncomputer on they'd see the ibm logo it\nwould be right there and then they'd be\nokay this is what we're gonna do and\nwhat they had people do was figure out\nas many uses that they could use for a\nbrick besides what a brick is normally\nused for besides like throwing through a\nwindow to break the window besides you\nknow building a house any of that type\nof stuff what can you how can you be\ncreative\nso they had people see the ibm logo\nthree or four times before they were\nasked the question to write down what it\nwas that they could come up with you\nknow\nnon-typical uses for a brick and then\nthey had another set of people that\ninstead of seeing the ibm logo they were\nthey saw the apple logo and it wasn't\nlike they're like hey this is an\nadvertisement for apple it was just like\nthey happened to see it it was either in\nthe room somewhere or it just popped up\nas they went to go asking the questions\nnow if you look at the two companies\nbetween ibm and apple if you were to\nlook at the two of them you say ibm is a\npretty typical company not very creative\nnot outside the box you don't really see\na lot of advertisements for many of that\ntype of stuff when you look at apple\napple tends to be a very creative\ncompany people tend to think that\nthey're a creative company they trust\nthem a lot they have creative packaging\nthey love a lot of you know there's\npeople that are hardcore about apple i\ndon't know too many people that are\nhardcore about ibm\nhere's what's crazy exact same situation\njust different logos that they saw the\npeople that saw the apple logo\nfound three times more uses for a brick\nthan the people that saw the ibm logo\nisn't that pretty crazy simply because\npeople know that they're when they deal\nwith apple apple is more creative so\nwhen they saw the apple logo they became\nmore creative in all of the uses that\nthey could find and the reason why it\nworks like this is because your brain\ndoesn't just have like one part of the\nbrain that lights up so the same place\nthat the brain where apple lies inside\nof your brain can connect other\nneurosynaptic connections in your brain\nfor creativity and it starts working\ntogether the same way that when you hold\non to a cup of coffee and you feel cold\nit lights up a certain part of your\nbrain and that certain part of your\nbrain has other neurosynaptic\nconnections around it so when you see\nsomething it doesn't just affect one\npart of your brain it affects many parts\nof your brain it's not just like one\npart of your brain turns on and the rest\nof it is off and so it depends on what's\nactually lighting up inside of your\nbrain another example of how this is\nused is grocery stores\nhere's something that's really\ninteresting okay\none of the best that i've that i find as\nfar as grocery stores that deal with\npeople and uh the way they they skew and\nchange your perception around everything\nis whole foods whole foods is one of the\nfirst ones to do this when you walk into\na whole foods what do you almost always\nhave i'm thinking of whole foods that i\nwalk into that's right down the street\nflowers\nright flowers and fresh produce\nwhy because they want you to feel that\nthis is a\na fresh place to walk into because when\nyou walk into a place that has flowers\nyou can smell the flowers you can smell\nthe fresh produce it makes you feel as a\nhuman like we are sensory organisms we\nsee a bunch of really bright beautiful\ncolors we smell a bunch of beautiful\nscents it actually turns on parts of\nyour brain to go oh yeah this is great i\nreally like this this is i feel fresh in\nhere\ni've never walked into a grocery store\nand all of the dead animals and flesh\nwas in the front\nwhy because that'd be a really weird\nplace to put it where do they put the\nmeat in every single grocery store in\nthe very back\nwhy don't they put the meat in the front\nbecause that's not how they want you to\nwalk in they want you to walk in seeing\nbeautiful colors they want you to walk\nin smelling beautiful scents they don't\nwant you to walk in and just see dead\nanimal parts right there and you know\ni'm just telling you honestly how it is\nand so what happens with the fresh\nflowers with the fresh scents everything\nis it makes you a little bit more hungry\nand at the same time makes people feel\nbetter when they see beautiful colors\nand they smell beautiful scents so\nif this is what companies are doing and\nable to do with you at all points in\ntime do you think that in your life\nthere might be unconscious priming\nthat's happening around you that you're\ncompletely unaware of\nabsolutely a hundred percent the best\npsychologists in the entire world work\nfor advertising agencies right i'm not\ntrying to be doom and gloom and i'm just\ntrying to make you aware of what's\nhappening so that you can start to\nprogram yourself and that's what we're\ngoing to do today but advertising\nagencies know that at the core of every\nhuman fear like fear that holds you back\nat the core of every single one of them\nis the feeling of i'm not enough and if\ni won't if i'm not enough then i won't\nbe loved and so advertisers know this\nand they exploit your psychological\nweaknesses in what happens they know the\nfeeling of i'm not enough is what's\nusually at the core of most people's\nfears and so what they do is they make\nadvertisements to make you feel\nsubconsciously like you're not enough\nuntil you buy our product\nsimple\nit makes sense that's how they start to\nsell more if you want to know more about\nthis there's a uh\na beautiful documentary it's like four\nhours long it will blow your mind uh\nthat's called the century of self\ni believe that's what it's called pretty\ni'm like 99 sure that's what it's called\nthe century of self and it goes through\ntalking about how it used to be before\nlike the 1940s it used to be that people\nwould 1940s 1950s people would buy stuff\nbased off of if they needed it and then\na lot of psychologists learned about\npsychology and human behavior they came\ninto advertising agencies and they\nstarted to actually use the advertising\nand the psychology in advertising to\nmake people stop buying things that they\nneed and make them buy things that they\nwant\nand so the perfect example that they\ngive inside of this the century of self\nis that there was i'm gonna try to\nremember this because it was about two\nyears ago that i watched this is that a\npre-1950s cigarettes were seen as\nsomething that only men smoked so women\nweren't really ones who smoked this and\nso uh so there was a guy that came in\nand the guy that came in was actually\nthe uh\nthe um\nsigmund freud's nephew he was sigmund\nfreud's nephew and he came in and he's\nlike i'm going to come in and help you\nwith the psychology behind this because\nif you're only selling to men you're\nmissing out on an entire 50 of the\nmarket that's out there how can we\nchange the perception and start selling\ncigarettes to women so that women can\nstart you know start\nstart consuming them and so what\nhappened was they came up with this big\ncampaign and they uh what they said is\nthere's gonna they they had these women\nand inside of these women were there's\nbig massive like thanksgiving parade or\nsomething like that and so they had the\nwomen\ngo and they were walking through and\nthey they went to all of the news\noutlets and they said there's going to\nbe a line of women who are going to be\nuh i think they called them suffragettes\nis what they called them and they said\nthey're going to go and um\nand and have have freedom torches that\nthey're going to show to take over their\npower take their power back so they're\ngoing to have freedom torches and what\nhappened was they went to all the news\ngroups there's going to be these women\nthey're going to have freedom torches so\nthe news group's like what the hell is\ngonna happen we gotta see whenever this\nthing happens so as soon as they're\nwalking there were these women that were\nin these these dresses they had inside\nof their uh inside their dresses they\nhad cigarettes and so all at once when\nthey got in front of all of the news and\nmedia outlets they took out their\ncigarettes they lit them in front of\neverybody and that was the way that\nwomen to in this perception of what\nhappened here took back their power to\nbe able to smoke cigarettes and say it's\nnot just going to be men they're going\nto smoke cigarettes it's going to be\nwomen as well and that alone\nsparked women smoking cigarettes from\nthe 50s on and so they knew how this\npsychology worked it's mind-blowing when\nyou start to see how psychologists are\nin advertising and actually hijack your\nsystem and exploit your psychological\nweaknesses so\nonce again i'm not saying this be doom\nand gloom i'm saying this so that you\ncan understand that your mind if you're\nnot very self-aware is able to be\nhijacked very easily by people who\nunderstand how your mechanisms in your\nbrain work better than you do right and\nso you've got to start thinking about\nthese things if an advertising agency\ncan make you feel differently just by\nwatching a 30-second ad to make you want\nto buy their product if a grocery store\ncan make you feel differently based off\nof the stuff that you see in the stuff\nthat you smell if a brick can you come\nup with three times more\nuh uses for a brick simply by the logo\nthat you see walking into a room if you\nknow a company if a school can make you\nfeel differently about someone that you\nread on a piece of paper simply by the\nthe temperature of the coffee that\nyou're holding on to then there's\nmillions of these things happening\naround the place and you've got to be\nvery aware of what's going on this is\none of the reasons why i tell people not\nto watch the news because the news is\nhijacking this system like crazy right\nnow it's also why i tell people not to\nwatch stuff like reality tv you know\npeople that are yelling at each other\nand terrible people and you know the\nthe kardashians and all the shows that\nare happening where people just they\ndon't seem to treat very people very\nwell every time i've seen that and also\nwhen there's like the\nwhat the housewives of whatever place\nthey all are at now that what happens is\nwhen you're watching these things it\nmight be like oh this is just a mind you\nknow i was busy all day i just want to\nwatch something that's just entertaining\nyou've got to ask yourself is this just\nentertaining or is this making me feel\nbetter about myself and the world around\nme or worse about myself in the world\naround me you know is the news keeping\nme informed or is it keeping me\nconformed and then you also got to start\nthinking about the people that you\nsurround yourself with you've heard me\nsay before and you've heard everybody\nsay before you're the average of the\nfive people that you spend the most time\nwith you know if you hang out with five\npeople that are extremely fit you're go\neven if you're not in shape you're going\nto get in shape simply because\nthe same way that all these things get\ninto your brain all of the people around\nyou are going to get into your brain in\ncertain ways as well oh man they're fit\ni'm fit subconscious you're going to go\ni should actually start working out more\nthey invite you to go work out you start\nshowing up because you want to feel\nbetter about yourself you want to fit in\nwith the people that you're around you\nknow if you hang around five people that\nare completely out of shape you're\nprobably gonna be the sixth if you hang\nout around five millionaires you're\nprobably gonna be a six if you hang out\naround five alcoholics you're probably\ngonna be the six you know so you gotta\nthink the people that are around you\nhow are they programming you right\nthe people that you follow on instagram\nis it pro programming you in some sort\nof way i always tell people go through\nyour news feed go through the people\nthat you follow just now that you know\nthat this is a thing and start removing\npeople that you feel are not good for\nyour own personal psychology now\nthe reason why this is important and\nthis shouldn't be something that\ndisempowers you but something that\nempowers you is because when you realize\nthat this is how the world works this is\nhow your brain works you can take back\nyour power and you can use it the way\nthat you need to so you can go okay\nbeautiful this is how it works i\nunderstand that this is my my system\nbeing hijacked i understand that this is\ngoing to affect me this certain way the\nmusic that i listen to is it something\nmakes me feel better is it something\nmakes you feel worse is this how i would\ntalk to somebody in real life or is this\njust something that i say when i'm all\nalone and i want i don't want to say so\nmy mom's around or i don't want to say\nit's when my girlfriend's around or i\ndon't want to say this when people that\ni respect are around right you start\nthinking about every single thing that\nyou do you start thinking about people\nyou hang out with the music that you\nlisten to the ads that you see the the\nthe news that you watch or don't watch\nthe food that you eat the places that\nyou shop and you start to become very\naware of oh that makes sense now oh that\nmakes sense now as well and it's not\ndoom and gloom it's actually empowering\nbecause you go you know what i'm going\nto surround myself with all of the\npeople all of the stuff all of the the\nmusic all of the the podcasts all of the\nyoutube videos all of the books all of\nthe people that are going to get me to a\nbetter level of who i want to be because\nif anybody can hijack the system why\ncan't i hijack my own system\nsince i'm in the system all day long why\ncan't i hijack my own system to create\nthe life that i want to become the\nperson that i want to become because\nultimately every single thing that you\ndo is unconsciously priming you\neverything that every single thing that\nyou're around is unconsciously priming\nyou so you've got to ask yourself am i\nin control of my priming am i taking\ncontrol of it or am i just leaving it up\nto chance because when you're very\nself-aware of this and you're very\nintentional with it you realize that\neverything in your environment\ncan either empower you or disempower you\nto create the life that you want to so\nbe very careful\nand motivate yourself inspire yourself\nwith every single piece of content every\nsingle thing that comes into your brain\nevery single thing that you see hear\ninteract with all of that stuff and\neventually you're going to realize that\nyou consciously primed yourself to\nbecome the person that you want the\nother day last week i was in the paint\nstore and i don't watch the news i don't\nwatch tv i don't even have you know any\ntv stations that could come in got\nnetflix and youtube that's basically all\ni watch on my tv in my house\nand i was inside of the paint store and\ni won't tell you what station it was on\nor any of this stuff but\nwhat it was on was it was on a very\npopular talk show\ni won't tell you which one it is and it\nhappened to be on a station that the\ntalk show was talking about a lot of\nthings that were very politicized\nand um every time it would go to the the\ncommercials the commercials would have a\nnews flash like little break that would\nhappen and it was another thing that was\ngoing on right and what i became aware\nof in this moment obviously i've known\nit but to be able to actually see it\ni was in there for about three to four\nminutes and i was like i wonder what\nthey're actually going to be talking\nabout\nand it was so blatantly obvious to me\nthat\nthis station was trying to push their\npropaganda to make you think and feel a\ncertain way now i'm not saying what\nstation was any of those things what\ni'll tell you is no matter what side it\nis whether it's the left or the right\nwhatever it is they are trying to have a\nwar for your mind by throwing out\npropaganda in things and making the\nworld seem a lot worse than it actually\nis\nright and within three to four minutes\nof being in there i became very\nuncomfortable because i was like i can\nliterally\nfeel\nhow other people\nthat don't know this is going on can\nthink that the world is absolutely\nterrible right now think that the world\nis absolutely going to to think\nthat there's so much to be afraid of and\ni've got to pick a side of what side i'm\non you know i've got to be on this side\nand when i pick a side this is important\nto know when i pick a quote unquote side\nthat puts me on one side which means\nthat there is always an enemy which is\nthe other side right and it was so\nobvious that this one side was trying to\npush their agenda and push their injen\nand push their agenda into somebody who\nis not aware of what is going on\nthey are going to be extremely easily\ninfluenced into number one\nthinking the way this side thinks number\ntwo\nseeing that there was a side that is\nagainst them that they need to be\nfearful of and number three think that\nthis world is going to absolute crap so\nthere's a couple things i want to pack\nout you know pull out of that and unpack\nthe first thing\nwhy is the news so negative and i've\ni've done episodes on this before in the\npast the news is so negative because as\na human our brains naturally go towards\nwhat is negative aka what is wrong why\nis that important because 10 20 30 100\n000 years ago when we focused on what\nwas wrong we were able to fix it which\nthen meant that we would stay alive\nbecause what was wrong a hundred\nthousand years ago could mean death if\nwe don't fix it so now\nwhat happens is the news in this media\nnot even just the news now it's also\njust the media these stations then they\ndisguise them as talk shows they\ndisguise them as tv stations they\ndisguise them as all of these different\nshows they put out there\nare out there putting fear and fear and\nfear and fear and fear into people and\nthe reason why is because when you're\nfearful you're going to watch more\nbecause you want to find the solution to\nthis problem and the more that you watch\nthese stations the more money that\nthey're going to make off of ad revenue\nif you watch them you're going they're\ngoing to get more ad revenue the more\nmillions of people that watch their\nshows\ntheir tv stations their news stations\ntheir\nyou know talk shows all of those things\nthe more people that watch them\nwell they're going to make more money so\nthat's the first thing\nso you've got to be very clear as to\nwhat you're watching and to be very\nclear is this something that is\nsupporting\nme growing into the person that i want\nto be or is this something that's\nactually holding me back and keeping me\nin a fearful state\njust simple way to diagnose just ask\nyourself this question what i'm feeling\nwhat i'm watching right now how does it\nmake me feel\nright if you're watching tv and the news\nhappens to pop up and you say how does\nthis make me feel and you're like i feel\nreally worried i feel very fearful and i\ndon't feel very positive about the\ndirection of the world\nturn it off like get it off as soon as\npossible because that's not helping you\ncreate the life that you want that's\nholding you back that's keeping you\nparalyzed that's immobilizing you versus\nmobilizing you towards what is that you\nwant to create right so the first thing\nto be very aware of is that they are\nputting fear\ninto every person that's out there\nbecause it's an easy way to control\nthe second thing that you have to\nrealize is this and i'm once again\nbefore i go any further i'm not saying\nthat the world doesn't have problems the\nworld definitely has problems and the\nworld will always have some problems in\nsome sort of way there's 7.5 billion\npeople on this planet are there a few\nbad apples out there there are a few\nkooky people that are off the rails\nabsolutely there will never be nothing\nbad i don't believe that will ever get\nto that point what i'm saying is it is\nseems way worse than it actually is\nbased off of number one all of the\ncameras now exist in the world because\neverybody's got a camera inside their\npocket and number two how it can be\npushed over and over and over again\nthrough every platform through the news\nthrough social media through everything\nthat you could possibly see\nso are are\nis the world perfect no will it ever be\nno but it's nowhere near as bad as they\nmake it seem right so that's the first\nthing to to be very aware of the second\nthing as to why would the media i don't\neven just say the news anymore why would\nthe media the stuff you see on tv\ntalk shows all of these things\nwhy would they put so much negativity\nand so much fear-based stuff out there\nreason why is because the easiest way to\ncontrol people\nis through fear guilt and shame\nhe said again the easiest way to control\nsomebody is fear guilt and shame think\nabout what's been going on the past year\nand how much fear guilt and shame has\nbeen put out into the media it is\ncrazy\nhow much has been put out there right\nand i'm not talking about any side i\ndon't i'm not part of any side just so\nyou guys know i don't believe in any\nspecific side i don't think that there\nis a side to just go for\nbut when somebody picks a side\nas i said earlier once you pick a side\nyou now have a side that you're against\nright if i'm rooting for one basketball\nteam if i'm watching a game and the\nmiami heat are playing and i'm a heat\nfan\nthey're playing another team that other\nteam i want to lose\nso if i'm on one side\nwhether that's the left or the right or\nwhatever it is that people believe in at\nthis point\ni want the other side to lose\nand when i want the other side to lose\ni'm losing and the reason why is because\nwhen you can when we're split up and\ndivided\nit's the phrase that we've all heard\nunited we stand divided we fall if we\ndivide as humans we are easy to control\nwe are easy\ni don't have a side right i don't i\ndon't have a specific side that's that\nthat\n[Music]\nthat i believe in or that i think is\nright or wrong i think that there's\ndifferent sides of both of them but\nthere's another thing that also is very\nimportant as well that people don't take\ninto account is that you're seeing the\nworld through your lens of the world\nbased off of everything that has\nhappened to you in your past\nright\nyou're seeing the world you think the\nway that you think you believe what you\nbelieve based off of the way that you\nwere raised and circumstances that were\npresented to you in your life\nlet me say that again you think the way\nthat you think and you believe what you\nbelieve based off of the way that you\nare raised and circumstances that life\npresented you with\nso someone who doesn't believe the exact\nsame thing that you believe\nand think the exact same way that you\nthink\nis because of the way they were raised\nin the circumstances that life presented\nthem with so that's very important to\nrealize who's to say\nthat if instead of having your life you\nhad their life that you wouldn't think\nexactly the same as them\nso what i want you to realize is that we\nneed to stop looking at other people and\nsaying that's the enemy i'm different\nthan them this is my side that's another\nside the only thing that we should be\ndoing at this point\nis focusing on how we can love the other\npeople now this is really interesting\nbecause i put up a video on instagram\ntalking with us the other day\nand most people will in full agreement\nyes we need to figure out a way to love\nmore to love more to love more because\nthe opposite of love is fear think about\nhow much if i don't like the other side\nwhatever that side is it's coming from a\nplace of fear right love is the only\nthing that's going to get us through all\nof this\nright there is no other way\nbattling and picking sides will not\nsolve our problems look at our\ngovernment if you're in the united\nstates all they do is just bicker like a\nbunch of little children right oh\nthere's this side there's this side\nthere's battling all they're doing\nthere's no love at all in all of that\nright\nclosing off will not solve our problems\nthere is no other side that you can be\non the only side that you can be on\nright now or ever is human you are a\nhuman no matter where you're from no\nmatter what you look like no matter what\nyou believe in no matter any of those\nstuff none of those things\nmatter what you are as you're a human\nand everybody else that's on this planet\nall 7.5 billion of them are human as\nwell when we are divided we are easily\nconquered if you look around and you\ndon't see the things in this world that\nyou currently if there's certain aspects\nof this world that you don't like i\ncompletely understand that but fighting\nis not going to create something better\nwhat's going to create something better\nfiguring out a way to love more\nright to unite not to divide when people\nare united is when things happen\nbut when we say that's evil this\nperson's evil that side's evil what\nhappens we get divided and when you\ndivide\nnothing's going to actually happen\nnothing good is going to hap actually\nhappen look at look at look at the past\nhundred years of how much division has\nhappened the past 100 200 years right\ndoes it look like it's going in the\nright direction well probably not if you\nwatch the news it looks like it's going\nin the wrong direction really fast\nactually right\nbut anything that you've tried to do in\nthe past and put somebody into a box\nand anything that's happened has put\nsomebody into a box of this is what you\nbelieve this is what i believe is what\nthey believe\ndivides people and when you are divided\nyou are easily conquered\nso what we need to do is figure out a\nway to love more\nlet me give you an example of what i\nmean\nas i said a few minutes ago\npeople believe what they believe and\nthey think what they think based off of\nwhat has happened to them in their past\nwhat life has brought to them in what\nthey were taught\nright\nso i might look at somebody and say you\nknow what i don't necessarily believe\nthe exact same things that they believe\nbut\ndoes that mean i can't love them\nor find some sort of love for them it\nmight be hard sometimes but it doesn't\nmean it's impossible it means it's\nsomething that we got to work towards\nright so you look and you've heard the\nphrase love your neighbor right love\nyour neighbor love your neighbor\nwhen we're divided nothing's going to\nhappen that's going to be going to be\ngood but when we unite and we can work\nthrough our problems we can work through\nthings that are going on that's when\nthings actually that's when things\nactually start to change\nright so if i look at somebody and i say\nokay\nthis person\ni don't agree with much of what they\nsaid\nactually i don't agree with most of what\nthey say but\ni didn't have their life i didn't have\nthem cir their circumstances i didn't\nhave any of the things that they had so\nif i was in their exact same shoes and i\nwent through the exact same life that\nthey had would i think the same as them\nand there's a possibility that i would\nwhich means\nthat how can i say i'm better than them\nand that my opinion and my my stance is\nbetter than them i can look at them and\ni can say you know what i don't agree\nwith them not a hundred percent\nthere's some things that we definitely\non other sides but i can love them\neither way why can i love them because\nnumber one\ni'm an empathetic person we all have\nempathy and we can always be empathetic\ntowards other people what they've been\nthrough in their lives right\nnumber two if i want things to actually\nchange\ni need to be able to look at someone who\ndoesn't agree the same thing as me and\nsay i can still love them through this i\ncan figure out a way to to for us to\nwork together that's the only way that\nthis is going to work then i could say\nokay if i go come from a place of love\nwhen i go and speak to this person\nthey're more receptive to listening to\nme and to listening to my side if i go\nfrom a place of hate in a place of anger\nthey are way less likely to listen to me\nand what they can do they're going to\nbuild up their walls and they're going\nto push their side further so if we\nreally want to have an intelligent\nintellectual you know adult conversation\nmaybe i should come from a place of love\nfirst and not a place from division and\nhatred towards them come from a place of\nlove and that would make them more\nreceptive to actually listening to what\nit is that i have to say\nmaybe\nthat's a way that we can actually get\nthem to change\nbecause if what they have been taught\nand what they what life has presented\nthem with what if i come from a place of\nlove and present them with a different\noption and present them with something\ndifferent maybe then that would change\nthem in some sort maybe it wouldn't\nbut in reality i know that if we come\nfrom a place of love and everything that\nwe do life is going to be a lot better\nand that's the thing that the world is\nmissing so what i want you to realize is\nthat right now there seems to be a war\nfor your mind\nyou're in control of all of the things\nthat you watch all the things that you\nlisten to all of the people that you\nhang out with the music that you listen\nto the media that you consume whether\nthat's\nvisually auditorily the people that you\nhang out with you know you're in control\nof all of those things and all of those\nthings brainwash you in some sort of way\nthe question is is it brainwashing you\nto become the person that you want to\nbecome or is it brainwashing you to hold\nyou back and not get you to move forward\nright all i know is that when i walked\ninto that paint store and i saw those\nthree to four minutes i was like oh\nmy god\ni literally physically did not feel good\nin my body and i was like i gotta get\nout of here as quick as possible because\nnumber one i could see what it was doing\nto me and number two i could see what\nit's doing to other people who aren't\nnecessarily paying attention and who\ndon't have this knowledge as well so\njust be\nnumber one come from a place of love be\nvery loving in everything that you do\nand number two\nrealize you're in control of the\ninformation that comes into your head\nbe in control of it be very diligent\nabout what you allowed to come in your\nhead number three\nlook at everyone else around you and\nrealize that if i pick a side and if i\nbecome divisive\nwe're easily conquered the only way that\nwe're going to change this world into\nbecoming the world that we want to be is\nwe have to first become that change if\nwe want people to get along more than\nthey're getting along\nnow we need to first be the people who\nstart getting along with people if we\nwant people people to be more loving we\nneed to first be the people that are\nmore loving\ngandhi said it\nstill makes sense be the change you want\nto see in the world what do you need to\ndo and change within yourself\nto be the change that you want to see in\nthe world what change do you want to see\nin the world and how can you take that\nand put it inside of you\nthere's a war for your mind going on\nbe in control of what's actually coming\ninto your head be in control of every\nthought that you think every action that\nyou take and come from a place of love\nin every single thing that you do and i\npromise you that'll be the first step\ntowards a better world i had put up\nyesterday a\ninstagram and facebook stories poll\nand i put up a couple different things\nand one of them said do you think aliens\nexist yes or no\nis money the root of all evil yes or no\nand then one of them said do you think\nthe world is getting better or worse and\ni was super surprised to find that 78\nof the people who follow me think that\nthe world is getting worse\nyeah i was super surprised by that and\nthe reason why is because i think that\ntypically the people who follow me tend\nto be more optimistic versus pessimistic\nand so i wanted to dive into the issue\nto talk about my viewpoints of if i\nthink the world is getting better or\nworse because i was super surprised and\nwhat i\nthink is i think the world is getting\nbetter but i think the world is going\nthrough an awakening\nso let me give you an example of what i\nmean by this let's say that somebody is\n50 years old right\nand they don't take care of their body\nthey eat whatever it is they want to eat\nthe greasy food they eat really sugary\nfood lots of caffeine just a bunch of\ncrap into their body they don't care\nabout anything that you know they just\nliterally eat whatever it is they want\nto eat nothing healthy okay let's also\nsay that they don't ever work out never\nthey've worked out in years and years\nand years and let's say they're\noverweight 30 40 50 70 100 pounds of\nweight i don't know what it is let's say\nthey're overweight because of the fact\nthey haven't taken care of themselves\nand they also don't get much sleep they\ndon't get good sleep\nand then one day that person has a heart\nattack and the heart attack luckily\ndoesn't kill them\nbut it does\ngive them a heart like they do have a\nheart attack heart attack isn't fun i'm\nsure never had one before but i'm sure\nit probably isn't the most fun thing in\nthe world\nso you look at this and you say after\nyears and years and years of abuse in\nneglect and not treating their body\nright\ntheir body has a heart attack\nand because of that heart attack the\nperson wakes up\nand they go oh my god like i almost just\ndied i'm now becoming aware\nof how i haven't been taking care of my\nbody i haven't been treating it right i\nhaven't been giving it the right fuel\ni have been just\neating stuff for taste and not for\nactual health reasons i haven't worked\nout and god knows long how\nit's been since i've worked out\ni don't get any sleep i don't get good\nsleep i drink a lot of alcohol\nand all of that over years and years and\nyears and years has accumulated to this\none moment of me having a heart attack\nnow\ni have a choice either i can go back to\nlife as it was or i can make some\ndifferent choices based on my heart\nattack\nand let's say that person decides you\nknow what i want to live long enough to\nsee my daughter walk down the aisle i\nwant to live long enough to be able to\nbe a grandfather that ends up being able\nto play with his his grandkids and go to\ntheir sports games and be able to\ncontinue to travel i want to live longer\nthan just past the age of 60 years old i\nwant to live to 85 90. what would it\nlook like for me to live to 90 and see\nmy grandkids get married as well\nand they start to take care of\nthemselves they start eating healthy\nmaybe they hire a nutritionist they hire\ntheir nutritionist and take care of\ntheir body they hire someone that that\nteaches them how to work out and the\nright ways to move they start figuring\nout ways to improve their sleep and they\nread books around improving their sleep\nand because of this this heart attack\ntheir entire life shifts\nbecause they now\nwoke up\nto how they have been treating their\nbody\nwhy do i bring this up why don't you\njust think about what we've been going\nthrough\nand actually before we dive into what\nwe've been going through\nif somebody were to have a heart attack\nand then switch their entire lives\naround in change for the better and\nlived longer and was able to see their\ntheir daughter walk down the island to\nbe able to hang out with their grandkids\nand have a better life and be healthier\nand happier and better sleep and all\nthat stuff is the heart attack still bad\nor\nwas the heart attack the thing the good\nthing that came in to awaken this person\nfrom the sleep that they were in and the\nneglect that they were giving their body\nand now\nah that's amazing because you know what\nnow i can treat my body the right way\nand that heart attack woke them up\nis what you can say it is their\nawakening from everything that they were\ngoing through now is a heart attack bad\nor\nwas maybe the heart attack of blessing\nwas a heart attack something that\nactually ended up being good because in\nthe long term it changed them\nand i think basically what we're in\nright now is the middle of a heart\nattack\nright\ni'm assuming that when you go through a\nheart attack it's not very fun\nno one's like holy this is great\ni'm having a heart attack it's usually\npeople are probably freaking out it\nprobably hurts a lot it's probably\nsomething that you don't want to go\nthrough\nbut\nif you think about what we're going\nthrough in the heart attack that we're\ngoing through the amazing thing about it\nis that we're now starting to wake up to\neverything that is wrong in the world\nthat we need to fix and this isn't me\nsaying this i take this side of this i\ndon't take any side in politics or any\nof that stuff in my opinion doesn't\nmatter because everyone has an opinion\nso it's just me talking from just a this\nis the way that i view the world\nwe're now waking up to old oppressive\nand evil systems that are being brought\nto the surface\nand a lot of people who were not aware\nof them\nare now aware\nthat there's a lot of things happening\nthat maybe they weren't aware of maybe\ndifferent racial things maybe different\ngender things it's becoming apparent\nthat some people have been held down by\nsociety it's been apparent that maybe\nsome people don't get 100 equal\nopportunities like group a might not get\nthe same opportunity as group b based\noff of where they lived or where they\ngrew up in the the school that they were\nable to go to and the education system\nthat they had\nit's becoming aware how our government\nis not set up for the people's best\ninterest but maybe their own\nand people are starting to become very\naware of these things like a heart\nattack that wakes you up and goes holy\n something's not right\nbut in turn now we're in the middle of a\ntime where things can start to shift\nthings can start to change so is having\na heart attack fun probably not i don't\nthink anybody's ever i've never heard of\nsomebody using the adjective as fun for\na heart attack\nbut\ndoes it seem like sometimes if you're in\nthe middle of a heart attack let's hit\nthe fan probably but if you live through\nthe heart attack you make changes you\nchange your life you change your\nlifestyle did it turn out to be a good\nthing\nmy\nrebuttal would be yes i do think my\nargument but yes i think that it is\nsomething that helped\na heart attack is an awakening for bad\nhealth in most cases obviously there's\ncircumstances outside where someone just\nhas heart problems but in most cases a\nheart attack is an awakening to bad\nhealth right civil unrest is an\nawakening to how we should look at the\nsystems\nthat we have and see if we can make them\nbetter for all people\n[Music]\nso the same way that a heart attack\nwakes up somebody who hasn't been taking\ncare of their health\ncivil unrest wakes up the public to how\nwe should be treating people and start\nto change our systems and processes\nmake sense\nso\nanother thing that we should consider\nwhen we're talking about the\nthe the the way that the world looks\nreally bad right now is that you have to\nrealize we're seeing a lot more footage\na lot more videos a lot more pictures\nthan we ever have\nof things that are bad that are\nhappening in the world\nare there things that are bad at\nhappening world absolutely are there\nmore than there ever have been\nabsolutely not and i'm going to share\nsome statistics with you around that in\njust a little while to tell you that but\ni think what you're also really have to\nrealize is that if you were to rewind 20\nyears ago 25 years ago 99 of people did\nnot have a phone or\ni mean actually not even take phone they\ndidn't even have a camera to take\npictures if you would have talked to\nsomebody 20 years ago and be like yeah i\ntake pictures of my phone they'd be like\nyeah you're crazy because that\nwould make no sense to somebody 20 years\nago right a phone was made to make phone\ncalls\nbut if you just think about that\nnow every single person\nhas a camera in their pocket at all\ntimes they can take pictures of anything\nso things that were kind of under the\nsurface and hidden a long time ago are\nnow coming to the surface and they have\nto come to the surface just like a heart\nattack so that you can be able to work\nthrough them\nso that's one thing another thing i want\nyou to consider is that now there's a\nlot more cameras than there ever have\nbeen so if you're seeing more things and\nthinking that the world is worse because\nof that you just have to realize there's\njust a lot more cameras than there ever\nhappened and once again i'm gonna go\nover the statistics in just a minute i\nthink they're gonna kind of surprise you\nanother thing\nthat has shifted a lot in the past 20 30\nyears is that the news used to be\nsomething that you could trust the use\nhad no the news had no\nhidden agenda now we all know that they\nhave their own agendas that they want to\npush to you and so they're pushing them\nanother thing that you can actually\nstart to think about\nis the rise of social media\nin my opinion social media is not a good\nthing it's not a bad thing it is just a\nthing and the human condition is now\ncoming out through social media but the\ninteresting thing about social media is\nthat social media makes it easier to\nshare information\nfaster and more widespread than any time\nin human kind\nso if it was 30 years ago and you saw\nsomething with your own eyes that was\nbad that happened in front of you\nthe only people you could really tell is\nyou could i guess you could call the\ncops you could tell your neighbors you\ncould tell your family\nbut right now if something were to\nhappen bad in front of your eyes and you\nwere to videotape it and put up on\nfacebook and put it up on instagram it\ncould immediately go viral millions or\nhundreds of millions of people could see\nit news groups could pick it up and then\nit would be all over the place so it's\nnot that things are getting worse it's\njust that\nthe darkness is coming to light because\nwe are able to share this information\nquicker than ever before\nand to dive into the statistics which i\nwant to share with you guys it's super\ninteresting\nis this so there's a\ni did my own research on this and\nthere's also a harvard psychologist he's\na cognitive psychologist named steven\npinker he's actually got a couple books\nabout in a ted talk about how the world\nis getting safer and it's better than it\never has been it just seems like it's\nnot based off of the fact that we have a\nlot of information that we can share\npictures videos immediately if you go to\ndepartment justice's website on the\ndepartment of justice's website if you\nlook at statistics firearm homicides are\ndown 39\nfrom 1993. so if you look at it you\nthink oh my gosh are so many more people\ndying from guns there's actually 39 less\npeople than there were in 1993\nyou know and it continues to go down\nyear over year i'm not here to argue\nfirearms so don't even think that that's\nwhat i'm trying to get across i'm just\ntrying to give you plain and simple\nstatistics to show you that the world is\nactually getting better right to make\nyou feel better about well maybe it's\nnot as bad as i thought it was maybe it\nis actually starting to get better uh\nnon-fatal firearm accidents are down 69\npercent\nso non-fatal firearm accidents are not\ndown 69 percent the numbers of people\nwho are murdered on a yearly basis in\nthe united states is down\nand now you might say okay well what\nabout side of the united states\ni understand there's there's places\nwhere things have gotten worse and\nthey've gotten better and things have\ngotten worse things have gotten better\nbut if you look at the world\ncollectively as a whole and i understand\nthere's going to be some anomalies to\nthis everybody but if you look at the\nworld collectively as a whole the number\nof people killed in war\nis 1 12th of what it was in the 1950s\nand 1960s\nso you literally have to look at that\nand go wow\n1 12\nof what it was before\n60 70 years ago so now right now is the\nsafest time to be alive as a human is it\nperfect hell no absolutely not but what\ni think we're going through\nis a little bit of a heart attack\nwe're starting to realize some of the\nways that we weren't taking care of our\nquote-unquote body other people's bodies\nour system our you know the body that we\nare all a part of\nthe\ngovernments that we're a part of the\nlocal areas we're a part of the nations\nwe're a part of and the world that we're\na part of we're starting to become very\naware\nof old evil oppressive systems\nand they're very blatantly in front of\nus now and we're now able to start to\nwork through those things\nso is it the most comfortable time to be\nalive absolutely not\nwill it get better\nwill there be something good that comes\nout of all of this i tend to be an\noptimistic person so i think yes and i\nwould like to argue that with anybody i\nthink that it is getting better\nstatistically it's showing it's getting\nbetter there's books that are written on\nit getting better\nis everything perfect absolutely not\nthere is no way you will ever hear me\nsay that everything is perfect and i\ndon't think\nhumans are perfect therefore i don't\nthink everything ever will be perfect\nbut\ni tend to\nlean towards the side of everything is\nworking for me not against me the world\nis working for me not to me and if\nthat's the case i also feel the world is\nworking for you and not to you it's\nnever working against you it's always\nworking towards your side so is it\nperfect absolutely not\nbut what i would recommend is this\nif you're starting to feel the feelings\nof of the world being heavy of the news\nbeing heavy of stuff that's happening in\nsociety being heavy\nturn off the news\nthe news is not there to support you\nit's not there to inform you\ni promise you that i've done episodes\nbefore about how the news is literally\njust there to make you\nnot informed but conformed and they put\nout a bunch of negativity because your\nbrain is addicted to negativity because\nthat's how the human species survived so\nturn off the news if you're starting to\nfeel like the world is heavy\nturn off social media if you're starting\nto feel like things are heavy as well\ngo out and experience the world\nwalk outside look at the sun and you'll\nrealize\nman things aren't as bad as they seem to\nbe when you watch them on the news on\nthe on the screens everything seems to\nbe collapsing when you walk outside of\nyour house\nit tends to be a lot better\nand i'm a very optimistic person so i\nthink we're going in the right direction\ni think we have a lot of work to do i\nthink there's a lot of things that still\nneed to work be\nbe worked through\nbut you have to realize that everything\nthat comes into your brain\ninfluences the way that you feel\neverything that you see influences the\nway that you feel everything that you\nhear influences the way that you feel\nevery person that you talk to influences\nthe way that you feel everything that\nyou read on social media or see on tv is\ngoing to influence the way that you feel\nand in turn that kind of brainwashes you\nto be a certain way\nso if you're thinking of it this way if\nif every single thing that comes into\nour brain in a way brainwashes us to\nfeel a certain way why don't we take\ncontrol of our our own brainwashing why\ndon't i go you know what i'm not gonna\nlook at the news today i'm not gonna\nturn on social media today i'm gonna\nread a book i'm gonna watch some youtube\nvideos from some motivational speakers\nor from\nsome psychologist or neurologist or\nwhatever it is you're trying to learn\nfrom and be in control of your own\nbrainwashing\nbecause i promise you this if you're not\nin control of it yourself you're still\nbeing brainwashed is it the brainwashing\nthat you want\ni would prefer to wake up and say i'm in\ncontrol of my own brainwashing i'm gonna\nput on the music i like i'm gonna listen\nto the podcasts i like i'm gonna read\nthe books that i like i'm not gonna turn\non the news i'm not gonna turn on social\nmedia and i'm gonna hang out the people\nthat i like\nbecause ultimately that's the way that\nwe get better\nso is the world getting worse i don't\nthink that it is i just think that we're\nin the middle of a heart attack and i\nfeel like on the other side of this\nheart attack\nthere will be better\npeople are going to work it out we're\ngoing to figure it out in the evil old\nand oppressive systems will be worked\nthrough and released\nand we'll be on our way towards a better\nsociety and hopefully better human\nconnection\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if you\ncontinue to eat what the media and news\nfeeds you and all that negativity you're\ngoing to have to deal with the sickness\nthat comes from it"
