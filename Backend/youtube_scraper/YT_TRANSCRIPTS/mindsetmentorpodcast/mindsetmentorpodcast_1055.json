    "transcript": "there's somebody else in this world that\nhas less talent than you less skill than\nyou that is getting ahead of you simply\nbecause they're taking action and you're\nnot what if you never take action\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow your perfectionism is destroying\ndestroying your productivity\nand not too long ago i did an episode on\nperfectionism specifically and how\nperfectionism is complete bs today i'm\ngoing to talk about how that\nperfectionism is literally killing the\nproductivity that you need to have in\norder to create the life that you want\nbut let me give you a real quick\noverview of what that episode is about\n60 seconds here we go your perfectionism\nis not real there is no such thing as\nbeing a perfectionist a\nperfectionism itself is a mask that you\nare wearing for your fears right what's\nreally the truth about perfectionism is\nyou're afraid of being judged or not\nbeing good enough or your paintings not\nbeing good enough or your music not\nbeing good enough or your photo's not\nbeing good enough\ncompared to other people and maybe some\njudgment or maybe the lack of acceptance\nright so you be you hide behind and not\njust you we all do this until we become\naware of it you hide behind your mask of\ni'm a perfectionist that's why i haven't\nput it out yet because i want to make\nsure that i'm perfect and you hide\nbehind that instead of actually putting\nit out there so an example of what i'm\ntalking about with perfectionism\nis if you are an artist you're painting\nand you're making all these beautiful\nthings there's so many artists that are\nsome of the best artists in the world\nthat will never be seen because they are\ntoo afraid of putting their art out\nthere so they have closets and closets\nand closets and storage units full of\namazing paintings that people would pay\ntons of freaking money for but they're\ntoo afraid because it's not quote\nunquote perfect when in reality what\nthey're really afraid of is doing a show\nand being so proud of themselves and\nthey have all of their paintings up and\nthey walk by and they hear somebody say\nthat's five thousand dollars i would\nhave paid fifty dollars for that and\nthat's what they're afraid of they're\nafraid of that little bit of rejection\nof not being good enough not being smart\nenough you're you're you're the the soul\nthat you have of being an artist is not\ngood enough the thing that i know about\nartists is if you see a really great\nartist what you'll actually see is you\nwill find someone who knows that their\nart will never be perfect let me say\nthat again when you see a really\nincredible artist what you're actually\nseeing is somebody who knows that their\nart will never be perfect so whatever it\nis that you are afraid of that is\ncausing you to be a perfectionist\nwhether it's\nart maybe it is art maybe it's music\nmaybe it's painting maybe it's you know\njust getting up and giving a speech in\nfront of people maybe it's writing an\narticle there's something inside of you\nthat's waiting to be brought out to the\nworld but you're too afraid to bring it\nout and that\nperfectionism is killing your\nproductivity\nit's killing your productivity because\nyou're waiting for the perfect moment\nyou're waiting for your stuff to be\nperfect and we all know that it will\nnever be perfect perfection does not\nexist anywhere in this universe the only\nthing that's perfect is imperfection\nthat's really what the truth is so\nyou're not taking action because it's\nnot the perfect time because your\npaintings aren't perfect because your\nwriting is not perfect because you're\nyou know your body's not perfect\nwhatever it is that you're that you're\nholding back from the world meanwhile\nthere's somebody else in this world that\nhas less talent than you that has less\nskill than you that is getting ahead of\nyou simply because they're taking action\nand you're not let me say that again\nthere's someone in this world who has\nless talent than you and has less skill\nthan you at whatever it is that you're\ntalented or skilled at and they're\ngetting ahead of you with less talent\nand less skill simply because they're\ntaking action and you're not let that\none sink in for a second\nwhat if you never take action\nwhat you have to do is you have to\nfigure out a way to get better every\nsingle day right you don't strive for\nperfection what you strive for is\nprogress can you just be a little bit\nbetter today than you were yesterday can\nyou be one percent better today than you\nwere yesterday can you get your your\nstuff a little get a little bit better\ncan you progress a little bit more can\nyou start bringing your stuff out a\nlittle bit more so instead of putting\nyour paintings you know if we just go\nwith the painting example because\nobviously i'm on this example for some\nreason i don't know why but you know\nlet's say you put your painting up on\nthe wall and you're painting something\ninstead of doing a show\nwhat if you were to just do a time lapse\nof you painting that thing and put it up\non instagram or put up on facebook and\njust see what people say i guarantee you\nthis we make things out in our heads to\nbe way worse than they actually are you\nwould be so surprised by people's\nresponse to seeing whatever it is that\nyou're doing\nwe'd make it out to be so much worse\nthan it actually is right i remember\nbefore i started making videos even\nthough i had over 10 000 hours of public\nspeaking experience there's a difference\nbetween public speaking experience and\nspeaking to a camera when there's nobody\nand no faces and no reactions that you\ncan see i have many friends who are\nincredible public speakers but they\nstruggle get go getting going and\ncreating video right if you're out there\nmaybe you want to be a speaker or maybe\nyou want to be a motivational speaker or\nmaybe you want to be a coach or whatever\nit is maybe you just want to just do\nspoken word i don't know what it is what\nif you just took a video and just\ndecided to put it up i guarantee you\nwhat you think people's perception and\nwhat they would say to you is way\ndifferent than it actually will be\nbecause we always make things out to be\nway worse than ever will be it will\nnever be perfect that's okay\ngetting something done\nis better than continuing to work on\nsomething because it's not perfect yet\ndone\nis always better than perfect i always\ntell my team members i always tell my\npeople who work work for me\ni'd rather them put something out at 90\nthan 100\nthere's so many times that i've said\nthis to people my team i'd rather you\nput something out at 90 perfect than 100\nperfect why because i know number one it\nwill never get to 100 perfect and that\nlittle extra 10 between 90 and 100 is\nthe rest of your life i'd rather\nsomebody put something out that's good\nenough\nthan something that's perfect you just\ngot to get it out you just got to put it\nout because i promise you if you're\nstriving for perfection you're never\ngoing to reach it and it's just going to\nbe a massive disappointment it's\nliterally the difference in life of\ntrying to get your entire to-do list\ndone versus just knocking off the most\nimportant things how many people\nlistening to my voice right now you\nstress out when you see your to-do list\nbecause you know that you need to get\nthat entire to-do list done\nright when i have a to-do list it's like\n40 45 things long because there's so\nmany aspects of things that i need to do\nparts of my business all of that stuff\nwhat if you stopped looking at your\nentire to-do list and you just circled\nyour most important thing and said i\njust got to do this because your most\nimportant thing is your most important\nthing so if you get the most important\nthing done\nisn't that at least going to get you\nmuch further ahead than anything else\nit will let me give you a real quick\nsecret about to-do list just so you know\nthis is what i do i make a to-do list\nif you've ever heard me say this i\nliterally did this on a live the other\nday i was on a facebook live or a zoom\ncall there was a ton of people that were\nthere and i literally took out my my\nthree by five card to show them this is\nactually what i do i practice what i\nteach preach i'll make a to-do list and\nit's freaking massive it's always\nmassive my to-do lists are never\nsomething that's small but i don't care\nabout getting the entire to-do list done\ni actually know that i'm probably not\ngoing to get anywhere near the entire\nto-do list done what i do is let's say i\nhave a to-do list of 45 things i'll go\nthrough and i'll circle the three most\nimportant things on that to-do list and\nthen what i'll do is i will take them\nand write them on a three by five card\nand i'll put them in my back pocket and\nall i have to do that day is get those\nthree things accomplished that's it\nimagine if you just get your three most\nimportant things done every single day\nthat's over a thousand important things\nover the course of a year\nright but the average person who's a\nquote unquote perfectionist looks at\nthis entire to-do list and is actually\ngets paralysis by analysis and they\ncan't do anything because the list looks\nso long and they've got to get\neverything done because they're a\nperfectionist no i just got to get my\nmost important things done that's it you\nhave to have\na different type of attitude in order to\nget stuff done you have to have the gsd\nattitude\nwhich is the get done attitude right\nyou've got to stop thinking you've got\nto start doing you will never be fully\nready for anything\nand you don't have to believe in\nyourself in order to take action that's\none of the beautiful things about taking\naction is you don't have to believe in\nyourself in any sort of way to just get\nit done anyways you just got to start\nmoving you don't have to worry about the\nthe journey of a thousand miles you just\ngot to take the next step and then the\nnext step and the next step then you'll\nnever take a perfect step but that's\nokay you have to mess up you have to\nlearn by messing up\nright the creator of honda says success\nis 99 failure you just got to succeed\nthat one time but you got to realize\nthat you're gonna mess up like i'm fully\naware that i'm i'm\na bubbling fool most of the day and i'm\njust i'm fully aware that i'm going to\nmess things up i'm going to screw things\nup every single day multiple times a day\ni'm going to screw stuff up i'm going to\nbump into walls i'm going to screw\nthings up i'm gonna send the wrong\nemails to the wrong person i'm gonna\ncreate a crappy podcast whatever it is\nthat i happen i'm just going to mess\nthings up\nbut i want to get the messing up out of\nthe way because when i mess up is how i\nfigure out how i can do it the right way\nright i go up that way didn't work oh\nthat way didn't work oh that way didn't\nwork oh this way did work and being\ncompletely honest perfectionism if i'm\nbeing honest with you is usually just a\ncase of a frail ego let that one sing in\nfor a second perfectionism happens to be\na case of frail ego i don't want to put\nthis out because i'm such a frail ego i\ncan't\nhandle somebody saying they don't like\nthis i can't handle somebody else's\nopinion i can't handle rejection i can't\nhandle that if sally in accounting sees\nmy video of my first\nmotivational video that i decide to put\nout of my first poetry of spoken word\nand she's like this sucks\ni can't handle somebody saying that to\nme that's a frail ego it's okay because\nyour ego most people's ego is quite\nfrail until they recognize it and they\nstart building it up you will never be\nperfect and let me just give you a real\nquick\ni guess this might help you out a little\nbit nothing in this world will ever be\nperfect there's no such thing as\nperfection walk outside and tell me what\nis perfect about everything that you see\nthere's no perfect tree there's no\nperfect blade of grass there's no\nperfect bird how could you expect to be\nperfect in any sort of way if you are\npart of nature like we look at nature\nand think that oh well i'm a human and\ni'm different from nature no you come\nfrom nature we are nature we have a\nsymbiotic relationship with nature we\nbreathe out carbon dioxide trees take it\nthey turn it into oxygen we breathe the\noxygen we have the symbiotic\nrelationship we are nature so if you\nlook at you wouldn't walk up to a tree\nand be like ugh that tree's fat oh that\ntree is skinny oh that tree's crooked\nit's not perfect you don't look at a\ntree and judge a tree\nbecause it's not perfect because we\nunderstand that there will never be a\nperfect tree there will never be a\nperfect blade of grass we just planted\nlast uh on sunday we just planted\nhibiscus and all of these hibiscus\nstarted blooming and i look at them and\nthey're not perfect i'm like they have\nlike little like veins and cracks in\nthem and like this beautiful pink color\nbut then there's like you know\na messed up leaf that they have like\nthey're not perfect but i don't expect\nthe hibiscus flower to be perfect so why\nwould i expect myself to be perfect when\ni come from nature i will never be\nperfect and the quicker that i realize\nthat the quicker i can go\nall right\nwell now i just got to go and get some\ndone there will never be anything that's\nperfect you're not going to be perfect\nthere's no such thing as perfection go\n some things up buttercup it's the\nway it's going to be\nthe only way to improve is go and mess\nsome stuff up go throw some stuff at the\nwall see what works and what doesn't\nincorrect action is always better than\nno action at all let me say that again\nincorrect action is always better than\nno action at all because enough\nincorrect action will eventually uncover\nwhat needs to change in order to make it\ncorrect action\nbut if you're just sitting around just\nhoping that you're going to figure it\nout and figure out life and make\nyourself perfect by not taking the\ncorrect action i'm just going to be\nhonest with you you're delusional\nbecause you'll never be able to figure\nout what that is the only way to figure\nout what the right path is or the right\nthing to do or the way to be\nquote-unquote perfect or as close to as\npossible is to go out there and mess\nstuff up that's only way that you can do\nit you just have to get going you just\nhave to get moving and eventually what\nyou'll find along this path is that\nyou'll mess up so much that you become\nokay with messing up and you actually\nrealize that messing up is the most\nimportant part of getting to where you\nwant to go right it's like a baby that's\nthat's starting to walk the only way\nthat a baby learns how to walk is by\nfalling over and realizing that's not\nthe right way that's not the right way\nand they're not consciously thinking oh\ni got to put a little bit more weight on\nmy right foot i got this big old chunky\nleft leg i got to try to move it my my\nthighs are kind of sliding against each\nother because i'm such a chunky little\nbit they're not thinking all these\nthings they're not thinking oh i got to\nput a little bit more weight here well i\nwas leaning back too far what they do is\nthey stand up and they fall they stand\nup and they fall and they stand up and\nthey fall they stand up and they fall\nand they stand up and they fall and\neventually after falling and falling and\nfalling and falling and falling they\nstart to figure out subconsciously their\nmuscles start to figure out oh this is\nthe way that you stay the way that you\nnever expect a child to just be able to\nperfectly walk is how you have to\nunderstand that in order to start\nwalking you've got to mess up a lot\nyou'll never be perfect unless you start\nmessing up so that's why incorrect\naction is always better than no action\nat all every single time i would rather\nsomebody on my team mess up and mess up\nand mess up than just sit there on the\nsideline and hope that one day that\nthey're going to figure it out you got\nto get going you got to get moving you\ngot to get past\nthe the worry of other people's opinions\nof you of not being perfect of this\nperfectionism because this perfectionism\nis literally killing your productivity\nand you have to be productive you have\nto get stuff done in order to create the\nlife that you want to so\nwhat do you do\nyou get moving\nand you mess up and you'll be okay with\nit what do i have to say\ngo get moving stop listening to me stop\nlistening to me right now turn me off if\nyou need to and go get some done\nit's time to take action it's time to\nstop judging yourself it's time to start\nthinking that you're not good enough\nit's time to stop thinking that you're\ngoing to be perfect just get a little\nbit better every single day and if you\ndo that one day you wake up and you'll\nbe a completely different person years\nfrom now than you currently are with the\nlife that you want\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well and so\nif you're telling yourself oh yeah but\ni'm just a perfectionist you're full of\nyou are failing at something is better\nthan doing nothing"
