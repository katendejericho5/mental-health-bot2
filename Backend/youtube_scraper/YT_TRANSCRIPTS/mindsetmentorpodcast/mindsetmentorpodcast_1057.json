    "transcript": "it's very very difficult when you have a\nloved one who's in the grips of this\ndisease and it's a sense of\npowerlessness\nthat is unlike anything else you cannot\nwill that person to make a change\nthere's nothing about it that's rational\nor logical alcoholics if you present\nthem with this idea look you can keep\ndrinking jail's institutions are death\nthat's the only place this is going or\nyou can get sober and just your life\nwill change and you'll be met with\nunlimited possibilities and the\nalcoholic will say i need to think about\nit right like\nyou know and normal people don't\nunderstand that\ntoday i'm excited to be joined by rich\nroll who is uh an ultra endurance\nendurance athlete best-selling author\nand host of the ritual podcast um began\nhis athletic career in his 40s\nand uh was uh\nwas an alcoholic 50 pounds overweight\nand within two years at the age of 43 if\ni'm not mistaken you won the stage one\nof the ultra marathons is a three-day\n320 mile triathlon is that correct that\nis correct\nso\num\nand you're also one of men's health top\n25 fittest men in the entire world which\nis impressive\nbut i would like to one thing i always\ndo with all of my audience is dive into\nyour story and kind of how you got to\nwhere you are because it hasn't always\nbeen\nrainbows and unicorns\nto get you to where you are uh but if\nyou would uh kind of start off on\nyou know how you got to where you are i\nwould love for everyone to know you want\nto go\nuh we could go back to you know college\ntime and uh the transition of everything\nthat happened to you well you mentioned\nthat that uh i started my athletic\ncareer in my 40s it's it's not\ntechnically accurate because i was a\nswimmer growing up\nswim\nat a very high level competitively\nthroughout high school and um\nand collegiately at stanford which had\nthe number one swimming program in the\ncountry at the time in the late 1980s so\ni competed on two nc2a division one\nchampionship teams\nsharing lanes with olympic gold\nmedalists and world record holders and\namerican record holders so i do have a\nrobust athletic background\nbut\nwhen i got to college well prior to\ncollege leading up to that i was a very\nstudious introverted\nkind of kid you know i never got into\ntrouble i didn't party i was just i was\non the grind all the time i got up at 4\n45 every morning went to the pool swam\nan hour and a half went to school\nuh\nback to the pool after school two more\nhours in the pool\nhomework 9 pm lights out repeat and did\nthat from age 14\nthrough high school\nso by the time i was a senior in high\nschool i was you know\nregarded as one of uh you know one of\nthe the top recruits in the country and\nstarted going on all these recruiting\ntrips and you know had gotten my grades\nto the\nrelatively close to the top of my class\num\nso the world was very much my oyster\ni thought that i was gonna\ngo to harvard i told them that i was i\ngot in and was intending to go there i\ntold the swim coach this is where i'm\ngoing visited stanford at the last\nminute because i had always like as a\nkid growing up in washington dc who had\na stack of swimming world magazines\npre-internet on my bed stand would see\nuh you know these these heroes of mine\nwho were at the farm at stanford and\nnever thought that i was quite good\nenough or that i would have a shot to\ncompete at that level because there's a\ndifference between\nbeing a standout high school swimmer and\nbeing an olympic contender that's a\npretty wide gap\nbut i visited at the last minute fell in\nlove with the people and the campus and\nthe idea of swimming outdoors every day\nand the combination\nof\nbeing able to train and compete at the\nhighest level in my sport alongside the\nbest people in the world\nwhile also attending arguably the best\nif you know one of the best in you know\nacademic institutions in the country and\ni just couldn't say no to that so that's\nhow i ended up at stanford\num and i loved it and there was an\nenvironment there\nthat was very conducive to\n[Music]\nopen-minded thinking in the sense that\nif you came with a dream there was an\ninstitution there to support it and\nnobody said\nyou got to pick academics or you got to\npick swimming you're not going to be\nable to excel at both instead it was an\nenvironment that said why not like\nthat's what you're here to do how can we\nsupport you and i love that ethos about\nthat institution that i think still\nis a hallmark of\nof of what makes stanford great\num but\nwhen i arrived at college i you know\nquickly\nuh fell into uh the partying scene i had\ngotten drunk a couple times and you know\ni could tell that whole story but\nessentially what happened was\n[Music]\nalcohol from the first time that i\nexperienced it\njust gave me a sensation that i knew\nfundamentally even\nat age 18 was different from my peers\nlike it was like this warm blanket that\nuh\nyou know made me feel comfortable and as\nif all the problems in the world faded\naway and i had this sense of feeling\nlike i thought i was supposed to feel\nall the time\nand it was a facilitator to a social\nlife that had previously eluded me i\ncould suddenly\nlook a girl in the eye and\nhave a conversation\nand go to parties and be sociable which\ni had never done\nin my life prior to that and i loved it\nand over time it was a very slow erosion\nbut over time that became much more\nimportant to me than any of the goals\nthat i had set for myself as this high\nschool senior\nlooking at conquering the world so fast\nforward\nyou know to a very dark place that\nalcohol took me at age 31 prior to\ngetting sober but along the way i had a\nlot of good times and it did\nit did\nteach me some social skills that i was\nlacking so it wasn't all bad it's it's\nit works until it stops working\nand the extent to which it\nstopped working um was kind of a\nprogressive\nthing that occurred over\nover many years but you know it didn't\ntake long before i was the kid who was\nthe last one to leave the party or was\ngoing out three or four nights a week\nwhen i was still getting up to go to\nswim practice and suddenly\nyou know my times aren't so good and my\ngrades are slipping and i didn't care i\njust was focused on where's the next\ngood time right so i maintained my\ndrinking\nafter college lived in new york city and\nthat was really an accelerant to the\nwhole thing because\nnew york city at that time early 90s it\nwas like disneyland for alcoholics and i\nknew in my heart of hearts that i had an\nalcohol problem but i was very far away\nfrom\nuh being in a place where i was ready to\nreckon with it yeah\nyeah so i'll give you my background so\nmy father was an alcoholic parents got\ndivorced when i was nine because of it\nand then he passed away when i was 15\nfrom alcoholism so sorry\noh thank you so i've i've\nbeen thinking about it my entire life\nand just kind of\nwhat what gets somebody to that point\nand what's interesting is that you know\nuh are you familiar with gabor mate yeah\nso i know i know him fairly well yeah so\nhe talks a lot about almost all\naddiction in some sort of ways is trauma\nbased and there's there's sometimes when\nit's when it's not it just happens to be\nlike you said where it's maybe for the\nfeeling that it gave you and the fact\nthat it\nwas able to get you outside of your\nshell and give you a you know an\nexperience that you weren't able to have\ndo you feel like there was something\nthat was trauma-based or do you feel\nlike you just went\nhey i'm too far down the line at this\npoint and i've it gave me something that\ni wanted to like social skills or\ngetting me out of my shell and then just\none day you're like i'm too far down\nwell i think it's a combination of a lot\nof things i think there's a lot of merit\nin\ngabor's work and what he has to say\ni think it's mostly instructive\nin terms of\na parent looking at how to guide a young\nperson to avoid\nthe kind of trauma that might trigger\nsomething like that as somebody who's\nbeen in recovery for\nwell over 20 years at this point um\ni can tell you that the solution lies\nless in looking in the rear view mirror\nand more about the practical tools that\nyou can access and apply in order to you\nknow rectify some of your preset\nbehavior patterns or you know kind of\nthe mental narratives that's been in\nyour head to\nlive a better life in my case i didn't\nhave alcoholic parents there was no\nalcoholism around me i never really saw\npeople drink excessively and i don't\nthink anybody gets out of childhood\nwithout some kind of trauma yeah\nand different people index the level of\nimpact that\nthose kinds of traumas may have but i\ndidn't suffer any kind of trauma where i\ncan point to it and say this is why\nand i think\nit's important to understand that\nlike i said earlier you can go down that\nrabbit hole and spend years trying to\nparse how you got to this place where\nyou became an alcoholic but ultimately\num it's not that helpful you know in\nterms of like how to live now right hey\nthese days would be hard to find time to\nsit down and learn and it's not easy\nwith the likes of social media they can\nbe so addictive and so time consuming so\nyou might think to yourself when do i\nhave time to develop myself but there's\nan app that i've been using for five\nyears now that i highly recommend it's\ncalled blinkist blinkist is for anyone\nwho

it's going to get in the place of\nthe what in the how like what do i need\nto do how do i need to get through it\nand i feel like sometimes people do go\ntoo far in the past and pay too much\nattention to it when in reality you're\nin this present moment and there's\nsomething that might be in front of you\nthat that you can work on yeah and um so\nthis is this is you know if you if you\ntalk about you said when you're 31 so\nabout 13 years that you were you were\nan alcoholic and performing well and\nwhen you graduate you became a lawyer\nand everything yeah i mean i was fairly\nhigh functioning for a long time i got\nthrough law school i don't know how i\ndid that yeah you know and i lived in\nnew york city and then i worked in a law\nfirm but you know like i said my life\nwas degrading you know day to day and\nthe kind of circumstances that i would\nfind myself in were becoming\nprogressively more and more dire\ni was able to get away with it for a\nlong time but as any alcoholic will tell\nyou they think that no one knows what\nthey're actually doing but it's pretty\ntransparent\nand it was it was it was bad i mean at\nthe very end\ni was the guy who would pour a vodka\ntonic before i would get in the shower\nin the morning and i'd put a tall boy\nbetween my legs to drive drunk to work\nand i would sneak drinks throughout the\nday\njust waiting until i could get home and\nlike get my buzz on you know real time\nand then go out and inevitably blackout\nthere's so many you know i have tons of\ncrazy stories but ultimately there was\nnothing\nvery bukowski or rock and roll or sexy\nabout it it was just sad lonely and\npathetic and it really came to a head\nnot that long after i moved down to los\nangeles where i got two duis in a row\nlike literally within a period of six\nweeks of each other i was facing jail\ntime i had rear-ended an elderly woman i\nwas you know and my license had been\nstripped my boss knew about it my the\nwhole house of cards was basically\ncollapsing on on top of me\nand uh\nand it's not that i didn't know that i\nwas an alcoholic i knew it was i knew i\nwas an alcoholic for a long time but\nthere's a powerlessness that's baked\ninto this disease you know it's\nessentially\nthis allergy of the body but it's really\na spiritual disease\nand\npeople\num\nwhen you hear about you know that that\nbottom that people hit that's different\nfor every people and i think it's\ncalibrated in accordance with people's\npain threshold you know the elevator is\ngoing down sometimes it's going down\nslow when it went down slow for me for a\nlong time then it started to accelerate\nand at any moment you have the\nopportunity to step off and change your\nlife\nbut it had to go down pretty far for me\nbefore i was willing to really reckon\nwith it and\nyou know it was a situation in which my\nlife was\nclearly going nowhere fast and my family\ndidn't want anything to do with me\nanymore i'd lost a bunch of friends i\nwas quickly on route to becoming\nunemployed sleeping on a bare mattress\nin a shitty apartment with no furniture\nand just alone you know and\nthat was really the catalyst and i ended\nup going to\na rehab facility in oregon\nwhere i thought in my mind i was gonna\nspin dry for 28 days like people do\nand when i got there you know i realized\nthat my best thinking me thinking i'm\nthis smart guy i got into harvard i went\nto stanford i went to cornell law school\ni have all these\nskills and i was this swimmer i don't\nbelong in a place like this but my best\nthinking had essentially landed me in\nyou know to put it bluntly a mental\ninstitution and that landed like a you\nknow like a pile of bricks on top of me\nand i just remember thinking\ni need to do this right because i never\nwant to come back here again and\nultimately that led me to being open and\nhonest about how i was actually living\nfor the very first time because\nalcoholics are are loners you know they\nisolate they don't want to tell anyone\nwhat they really feel and they feel\nlike their problems are totally unique\nand nobody would understand them and\nwhen i finally\nyou know opened up and started saying\nthis is this is what i do this is what a\nday in the life looks like for me the\ncounselors essentially said well one\ncounselor in particular said listen\nyou have\nyou have a case of alcoholism that we\ntypically only see in like 65 year old\nlifelong drinkers like it's bad and if\nyou don't sort this out for yourself\nlike you will die i've seen it a million\ntimes\nyou can leave whenever you want but we\nwould suggest that you stick around and\ni said whatever you need me to do i'm\nhere and i ended up living in that\ntreatment facility for 100 days\nwas there like a\none moment where it was like you said\nyou knew for a while but there's one\nmoment where you're like i have to make\na change and it was like\nthat was the moment where you decided to\nto wake up or was it just the slow burn\nlike you're talking about i mean it was\na slow burn but rob i think you would\nagree that that all of us\nat moments in our life like it's sort of\nlike uh\num sliding doors like there are these\nwindows of opportunity that suddenly\nappear\nwhere your willingness to make that\nchange\nmatches up with a set of circumstances\nthat allow you to kind of step through\nthat door and make that change because\nlike i said i knew\nthis was going to end badly i knew at\nsome point i was either\ngoing to kill somebody kill myself end\nup in jail or get sober\nbut i just couldn't get myself to make\nany of those changes until one day i\njust was ready and i can't\nexplain it any more further than that\nbut to say that you know the level of\npain that i was in like the\nthe the the pain that i was experiencing\num exceeded the fear of the unknown\nbecause it's a very scary prospect and\nyou probably know this from your father\nthe the idea of getting sober it's like\nonly alcoholics if you present them with\nthis idea look you can keep drinking\njails institutions are death that's the\nonly place this is going or you can get\nsober and just your life will change and\nyou'll be met with unlimited\npossibilities you'll be happy you'll be\na\nresponsible member of society again and\nthe alcoholic will say i need to think\nabout it right like\nyou know and normal people don't\nunderstand that and i'm sure\ngrowing up\nthat caused a lot of chaos and confusion\nand pain and you know and turmoil and\ntrauma for yourself and your family\nyeah and i i get messages from people\nall the time which is why i you know i\ndon't want to dive too deep into it but\ni think i i appreciate you sharing\nbecause there's a lot of people that\nhear my story and they're like well my\nfather's going through this my mother's\ngoing through this or they're going\nthrough it as well and it's it's\nimportant i think for people to hear\nthis and\nalso to realize that there's nothing\nwrong with those people like they think\nthere's something wrong with them and\ni'm like it's\nthey they kind of just need support\nsometimes and it's also sounds like from\nwhat you said it's it's just some people\nget to a point they realize they need\nhelp it's it's very very difficult when\nyou have a loved one who's in the grips\nof this disease and it's a sense of\npowerlessness\nthat is unlike anything else you cannot\nwill that person to make a change\nthere's nothing about it that's rational\nor logical\ndid you\ngo to al-anon when you were a kid yeah i\ndid yeah yeah and i went to allen on\nmore than my dad went to aaa yeah you\nknow and it's uh it's\nthere are people who have messed me\nthey've been alan on and it's\nas as a a child of an alcoholic it's\nsuper hard to\nunderstand because also you feel like\nand i never consciously knew this until\ni did a lot of work on myself of oh most\nof my trauma comes because i actually\nthought my dad loved alcohol more than\nhe loved me\nright but then you grow up and you're\nlike that's not actually the case but\nnow that is some of the trauma they need\nto work through you know because you see\nthis thing and you're like i just want\nhim to be around i want him to i want to\ni say i got i got lucky in the sense\nthat um my father was an alcoholic who\nhe never hit me he never abused me he\nnever\nemotionally physically sexually abused\nme any of that stuff he got drunk and he\nfell asleep but in turn there's\nemotional life that comes from that\nright times he was supposed to pick me\nup didn't pick me up um having to walk\nhome by myself you know thinking he was\ngoing to pick me up to go fishing\nsitting on the steps it's it's the the\njust the day-in-day-out trauma of not\nhaving a dad present in your life and\nyou know falling into that belief that\nhe must love that more than he loves me\nfor sure yeah\nso it's been some work it's been a lot\nof years i mean i i i\nlook at it this way it was a blessing it\nwas the day he died was the worst day of\nmy life but it was also the best day of\nmy life because it made me realize this\nis going to end and i don't think that i\nwould do any of the stuff that i do now\ni actually not that i think i would not\ndo the things that i do now i wouldn't\nhave the podcast i wouldn't you know try\nto help people with it so\nin turn i think it's turned into a\nbeautiful thing it's the way that it\nalways works yeah it's it's supposed to\nwork things\nif you give them the attention and\nwrestle with your demons and do

were\nstill you went back and worked i think\nas a lawyer and then there was a moment\nwhere you you just decided that you\nwanted to to do what you do now it seems\nyeah it was uh excuse me\ni'm sorry was your were you with your\nwife at this point in time no i well i\nmet my wife so i come out of treatment\nand my\nmy whole mo was to build the most solid\nfoundation of sobriety that i possibly\ncould i was so terrified of relapsing or\nbeing back in that place that desperate\nlonely place that i was in\nso when i came back to los angeles it\nwas just all about meetings like i just\nwent to two meetings a day i needed to\nchange all my friends\nand found some i mean the good thing\nabout\none of the many good things about la is\nthere's incredible recovery here and\nthere's a lot of amazing young people in\nrecovery and the community is just\nunbelievably supportive so\ni embraced that\nwholeheartedly and that was the most\nimportant thing in my life so yes i went\nback to the law firm where i was working\nbut\nprior to leaving the treatment center\nthe council the count my main counselor\nwas like listen i really think that you\nshould be\ncelibate and avoid dating or getting\ninvolved in a relationship for at least\nthe first year because so many of my\nissues were tied up in\nhow i\ninterrelated with the opposite sex\nbecause that's how i learned to talk to\ngirls i couldn't do it sober and the\nidea of trying to do that was terrifying\nto me and i needed to really just focus\non developing life skills and getting as\nsober as i possibly could before i could\nwelcome in any other human being because\ni'd never been\nin a healthy relationship before so i\ndid that but right when i\nreached the one year mark i met my wife\nand and that was that was it like she's\nliterally the only person that i've\ndated in a sign in a significant way in\nsobriety and we've now been together\nfor\n21 years yeah and it seems like from the\nstories the research i've done it seems\nlike she's pretty amazing as well he's a\nbadass yeah like when you talk about the\nstories\nwhen you talk about stories of like you\nknow you were you were at a point one\ntime where you couldn't even uh\npay for your garbage to be picked up so\nthey took your trash cans right and uh\nbut she still was supportive in getting\nyou and helping you to where you wanted\nto be it wasn't so much helping me it\nwas more helping us\nthe idea behind it so\nyes i went back to the law firm and\nthere's a whole story about that but\nultimately i end up walking away from\nthat life when i start to discover that\nthere's so much more to explore as i\nwrestled with this kind of existential\ncrisis that i was having about\nwho i was and\nwhat i'm here to do\nand that was a\nmultiple that was multiple years of\ntrying to figure things out during which\ntime\nwe went through\na very difficult financial time\nwhere\nthe prospect of just putting food on the\ntable became precarious\nand part of that was yes there was\nthere was a time where we couldn't pay\nto have our garbage bins\nuh couldn't pay to have our garbage\npicked up so they took the bins away and\nwe would have to put the garbage in the\nback of this beat up uh our only car\nwhich was a beat up minivan with like\n250 000 miles on it find a dumpster\nsomewhere to dump it and it was\nhumiliating and emasculating as a guy\nwho\nyou know\nagain going back to like i'm this person\nwith this pedigree and i should be doing\nthis\nand now i have kids and i'm married and\nand\nit's a tough pill to swallow so you're\nwrestling with this idea of\nof of chasing meaning you know they call\nit following your passion i'm not a big\nfan of that phraseology but\nfinding meaning trying to connect with\nsomething more potent and\npersonally fulfilling to do with my life\nand that was not a\nquick process so during that period of\ntime yeah there was a lot of hardships\nand julie\nyou know i would have moments where i'm\nlike screw this i i need to like just\nget a paycheck doesn't matter what it is\nand she would say\nno you're like on this path and for you\nto stop or backtrack now is to\ndisrespect everything that we've gone\nthrough to date\nand i have faith like she had extreme\nfaith that this would play out in a\npositive way but that we had to just if\nanything double down on the way that we\nwere kind of pursuing this path\nso it was her strength i think that in\nso many ways allowed me to stay in it\nwhen my faith faltered\nand you know she's a powerhouse like her\nspiritual practice is is\nsomething to behold and she doesn't\nsuffer fools lightly and i think when\nyou talk about spirituality the mind\nwanders to a bunch of new age people\ndoing crazy stuff talking about a bunch\nof nonsense but really what it is is an\ninternal fortitude\nand a sense\nof um\nfidelity to whatever your north star may\nbe\nthat's beautiful\nand so\nwhat was the path that you found at that\npoint well what happened was\ni get out of treatment i'm working on my\nsobriety i meet julie we're together\nand that there was a decade in which\nin addition to just being sober\nmy goal was to become\na responsible member of society again\nlike to\nrebuild everything that i had destroyed\nand to regain a level of respectability\nto be a responsible member of society\nand in my mind the path towards doing\nthat was to\nyou know\ndouble down at work at this law firm and\nbecome a partner and do all the things\nthat society will smile upon and approve\nof so\nthat ushered in a phase of of\nworkaholism because the way alcoholism\nworks is you could take the drugs and\nthe alcohol away right that's not really\nthe cure like the drugs and the alcohol\nare a symptom of an underlying disorder\nthat just wants more that's trying to\nfill this hole that you have in your\nsoul and your spirit and if you're not\nfully dialed in in your recovery program\nyour behavior is going to start to\nmanifest in all manner of unhealthy ways\nyou're either going to get into\na terrible relationship or you're going\nto start gambling or you're going to be\nshopping too much or you're going to be\nnow scrolling on social media all day in\nmy case it manifested in\nworkaholism and this is important\nbecause people don't talk about\nworkaholism enough like that was how my\ntrauma manifested from my father was\nworking 110 hours a week\nwell because it's something that you\nfeel like you can control right and for\nyou coming out of an environment in\nwhich there's a lot of chaos it's not\nsurprising that that that you would\ngravitate towards that like i'm in my\ndomain here's what i do and as long as\ni'm working and you know pushing these\npapers around in this particular way i'm\ngoing to be able to create the life that\ni want for myself and what happens with\nthat is that\nit's myopic to the bigger picture around\npurpose and meaning and so while i was\nchasing all of this i was also\nmedicating my\nrepressed emotional state through\nunhealthy food so i was basically a junk\nfood junkie\neating all my food through drive-ins and\nyou know late night\nchinese food at the law firm or whatever\nthe case may be so by the time i was 39\ncoming up on 40 i was about 50 pounds\noverweight\num never like i was never like a big\nmorbidly obese guy or anything like that\njust like a heavy guy who looks like\nhe's working in the law firm too much\nand riding the elevator up and down was\nthe extent of my\nphysical exertion for the day\num\nand in my mind this is fine like i'm but\ni'm also\nin the back of my you know in the in my\nheart of hearts in the back of my mind\ni'm like\ni'm really unhappy here i look around at\nthese partners i don't aspire to any of\ntheir lives you make partner then you\njust get more responsibility and i saw a\nlot of\nrelatively unhappy people who then\nbecome leveraged to the hilt because\nthey would\nbuy the house that's a little bit out of\ntheir reach or lease the car that's just\na little bit too expensive and before\nyou know it you got kids and you wake up\nand you're 45 and you're like well this\nis my life like i can't course correct\nat this point i'm too\nfar in\nand i had that sense that if i didn't do\nsomething different that that was going\nto be me and i was terrified about that\nbut i didn't know what else to do this\nwas the only thing that i'd ever really\nconsidered and it dawned upon me that\ni'd never despite this\nhigh level education that i had and\nparents that cared about me and and\nalways met my needs and the like i had\nnever spent a minute thinking about\nwhat it was that i wanted to do for\nmyself i didn't feel entitled to that\nand i think part of that comes with this\nother thing that that people\nwho are lucky enough to get a great\neducation don't feel like it's okay to\ntalk about which is if you if you get\nthat kind of education then you need to\ngo be this kind of person in the world\nand and you're you can't really squander\nit to chase some crazy dream because\nthen what was all that for right and i\nwas dealing with a lot of that at the\nsame time so this existential\ncrisis eventually\ncrashes into\na health crisis when\ni come home late from work\ni'm on the precipice of turning 40 my\nfamily's asleep and i'm walking up the\nstairs to go to bed and i had to pause\nup a simple flight of stairs i was\nwinded out of breath\nsweat on my brow heart disease runs in\nmy family i had tightness in my chest\nand i thought\nam i having a heart attack like it was a\nscary moment\nin which\neverything suddenly became crystal clear\nlike another sliding door situation line\nin the sand moment\nwhere i suddenly had a willingness to\nmake some of the changes that i knew\nthat i needed to make with respect to my\nlifestyle and to really tackle this\nexistential dread that was consuming me\nat the time and i think looking back i\nmean you mentioned you know you have\nthese\nbad moments in your life and ultimately\nthey become good things i knew because\nof\nwhat had happened to me\nso many years prior eight nine years\nprior\nwhere i made that decision to go to that\nrehab and how drastically my life had\nchanged as a result of that decision so\ni had\nthe sense\nthat a simple decision can change your\nlife\nand the idea that\nanybody can change their life if they\ncan summon the courage to\nwelcome the unknown into their life\nbecause that had happened to me before\nbut that was a very specific moment i'm\ngonna go to this treatment center you\nknow had i waited a day i don't know if\ni ever would have gone so when i'm on\nthe staircase\ni had this palpable sensation that i was\nbeing visited once again with one of\nthose moments and i knew well enough\nthat it was going to require me to act\nright away because\nif i just let it pass and say well that\nwas weird you know maybe i should\neat a little bit better or go to the gym\nyeah that that wasn't going to work like\ni needed to do something immediate and\ndrastic that was similar\nthat would that would like\nconnect me with that experience of going\nto that treatment center in a different\nway\nand that's what i did so the next day i\ndid like a seven day i started this\nseven day\nfruit and vegetable juice cleanse\nbecause that felt like a version of\ndetoxing off drugs but with food\nand it wasn't that i felt like i needed\nto detox my body i just needed to do\nsomething hard that would like wipe the\nslate clean\nand and and provide me with a new\nperspective and some momentum which i\nthink is very important in making any\nchange in your life\nto\nbegin this journey of how i was going to\nrecreate how i was living yeah so did\nyou decide at that after that point had\ndid you become a vegan or you would take\ntime into know\nyeah that took time it's funny because\nif you google my name it all looks like\nall this stuff happened in a very\ncompressed period like he was a drunk\nand he went vegan and then he was doing\nultra marathon\nwe're talking about like a 15 year well\nit was like you know nine years sober\nbefore the health thing and then\nit took about six or eight months of\nplaying around with diets before i\nentertained the possibility of trying to\neat a 100 plant-based diet like i didn't\nwant to it wasn't like oh i can't wait\nto not eat animal products like i wasn't\nan animal rights person but i tried all\nthese other diets it didn't really seem\nto work and\nthat cleanse that seven day cleanse that\ni did on the seventh day i felt\nincredible like if if you've ever done\nanything like that or done some fasting\nyeah there's something about that\nprocess that that really supercharges\nyour vitality and i just remember like a\ngood alcoholic i was like i want to feel\nlike this all the time right you know\nmaybe i'll never eat food again my\nwife's like\nyeah you're still an alcoholic like you\ngot to eat food i'm like all right well\nhow can i eat so that i feel like this\nand that's what kind of led me down the\nrabbit hole of trying a bunch of diets\nthe last being a plant-based diet\nbecause it seemed the most extreme it\nseemed the most difficult to master\nbut nothing else worked and honestly i\nwas like i'll try it because i need to\ncheck that box and then i'll just go\nback to eating cheeseburgers because i'm\n40 and maybe when you're 40 you're\nsupposed to just feel like [ __ ] all the\ntime\nso i did it and within a week of making\nthat switch i did feel like i did on\nthat seventh day there was something\nabout\neating only plants close to their\nnatural state no processed foods that\nreally agreed with me and\nthat was like a profound moment and i've\nbeen eating that way ever since so that\nwas how long ago was that i'm 54 so\n14 years\nso\nfor people listening they're thinking\nhow because the way that we understand\nyou can people can't see me it's air\nquotes understand nutrition think if\nsomeone's going to be an ultra\nmarathoner they got to get a lot of\ncalories they got to get a lot of animal\nproducts all that so to be a a vegan\nultra marathon runner seems\ncounterintuitive for the average person\nthat's out there do you have uh do you\nhave anything to say around that because\ni think yeah a lot of people that that\nswitches the way they think right i mean\nit's changed a lot um in the 14 years\nsince i've been doing this now there's\ntons of athletes that are killing it on\na plant-based diet and movies like game\nchangers have really helped\nchange the conversation the cultural\nconversation about\nathletic performance and a plant-based\ndiet but at the time yeah there weren't\nthat many people doing it there was one\nguy that i knew called rick esselstyn\nhe was an all-american swimmer at the\nuniversity of texas i competed against\nhim we didn't really know each other we\nweren't friends but i knew who he was i\nknew his name i'd swim against him when\ni was a kid he's a couple years older\nthan me and we were facebook friends and\non his facebook so this is what is this\n2006 or something so just to like root\nyour internet you know vernacular around\nlike facebook being you know kind of the\nmain thing at the time\num and he was about to come out with a\nbook called the engine 2 diet and he'd\nbeen plant-based for a long time then he\nwas a profession he was a he was an\nall-american swimmer and then he was a\nprofessional triathlete he was first out\nof the water at kona one year like he's\na very good athlete\nand we started communicating i was like\ntell me about this\nthing that you're doing because i just\nstarted eating plant-based i don't know\nwhat i'm doing he's like oh man you know\nso we started a friendship up and he was\nkind of mentoring me then his book came\nout that was a book that was a big deal\nbasically he was a fireman at the time\nand he took all the guys in his\nfirehouse through like a 30-day\nexperience of cooking for them in the\nfirehouse plant-based only and they\nwould do you know all the stuff that\nfiremen do push-up challenges and pull\nup challenges and he was taking their\nblood week by week and there were guys\nyoung guys in there who had crazy\ncholesterol and all kinds of like health\nproblems that you know somebody in their\n30s shouldn't have yeah and he was able\nto reverse a lot of that and that\nprovided the basis for this book that\nexplored the plant-based diet his father\nis also\num\na\nuh a cardiologist and a researcher who'd\ndone a lot of work in this field and was\nan olympic rower and had been eating\nplant-based for like 50 years so that\nwas like\nthose guys really\nhelped me to feel\nconfident or\nassured that i wasn't being completely\nirresponsible or crazy\nand\nin tandem with that with this elevated\nvitality that i was experiencing\ni started exercising again which is\nsomething i hadn't done in a long time\ndespite having been an athlete but i had\nno designs on returning to becoming\ncompetitive in any regard i just wanted\nto lose this weight right that i was\ncarrying it was really a vanity thing\nlike i just i just want to lose weight i\nwant to look good i want to be able to\nenjoy my kids at their energy level my\nwife bought me a bike for my birthday\nand i just you know would go out for a\njog i went back to the pool occasionally\nbut it was all like super casual at\nfirst it didn't it you know the whole\nlike ultra endurance world didn't come\nuntil\na fair bit later yeah so what was that\ntransition so just you just started\ngetting\na little bit better a little bit better\nand then something popped up and you're\nlike all right i'm going to go run a\nmarathon or a halfway thumb yeah no what\nhappened was the weight came off really\nfast and\nevery week i was making crazy gains like\ni would go from being barely able to run\nyou know three or four miles to then\nrunning eight miles like you know two\nweeks later and i just was feeling good\nand i was bouncing back day to day like\ni wasn't getting\novertired by any of these workouts\nand that started to you know get my\nbrain thinking like wow i feel like i\ncan't believe you know i was never a\nrunner yeah i can actually go out and\nrun pretty far and pretty fast and then\none day\nit's probably about maybe six months\ninto this whole thing\ni went out for a trail run near my house\nand it was a weekday morning\ni didn't have that much time because i\nhad work i had to do\nand my plan was just to run for 45\nminutes or an hour but i had that kind\nof flow state experience that you hear\nabout and runners talk about a lot that\nthey're visited with occasionally where\nyou just feel unbelievable like you can\nrun forever and i was experiencing that\nfor the first time and i just decided to\nkeep running and keep running and keep\nrunning and ended up running like 24\nmiles on that run which was\nlike\nso much further than i ever had before\nand i just couldn't believe\nthat i was able to do that and it didn't\nseem that hard like i wasn't that tired\nafterwards either and so that got me\nthinking about a challenge for the first\ntime and part of that is also like hey\nyou're 40 that's when you start to you\nknow kind of look at your life and have\nthat mid-life crisis a lot of guys end\nup going to do iron man's or buying a\nfancy car or something like that so\nthere was a little bit of that mixed in\nwith\nthis\nsense that i had that i'd never reached\nmy potential as an athlete because\nalcoholism had really robbed me of that\nand so\nthat's 24 miles that's almost an entire\nmarathon just going for a typical run\nand then so how did how did it\ntransition you going to 100 mile race\nwhat was the first really big oh [ __ ]\nthis is this is a big deal for you well\nso i started entering some triathlons\nlocal little triathlons around town and\nthought um hey i'd love to do an ironman\nbecause i'm having a midlife crisis\nyou didn't want to get the red corvette\nanything about that world at all yeah\nand i thought you could just sign up for\nthese things i didn't realize you got to\nsign up for them like a year in advance\num\nand so that was kind of off the table\nbecause i didn't want to wait a year in\norder to have a date on the calendar\nthat would kind of drive me in a certain\ndirection\ni did a half iron man that i didn't\nfinish i didn't know what i was doing\nlike i just cramped up after the bike it\nwas a terrible experience like i was not\noff to\nlike this great start of you know where\neverybody's like wow he's he's an\namazing endurance out there like that\nwas not what was going on but but then\nwhen i was trying to figure out what\nwould be a cool challenge\ni\nread this article about this race called\nultraman which i'd never heard of so for\npeople that are listening that don't\nknow an iron man\nwidely considered the ultimate challenge\nof endurance\nis a one-day race in which you swim 2.4\nmiles you ride your bike 112 miles and\nthen you run a marathon super hard the\nfastest guys do it in eight hours plus\nmost people do it in like\n12 to 14 hours or something like that\num and i just thought there's nothing\nharder than that like that's the\nultimate challenge and then here was\nthis ultraman race that i started\nreading about which was twice that\ndistance over three days it's\nessentially\na double ironman distance triathlon that\ncircumnavigates the entire big island of\nhawaii a 320 mile race in the first day\nyou swim 6.2 miles 10 kilometer swim and\nthen you ride your bike 90 miles with\ncrazy amount of elevation up to volcano\nvolcano national park in hawaii the big\nisland hawaii the second day you race\nyour so then you go to bed it's like a\nstage race second day you wake up\nand you race your bike 171 miles\nall the way around the island and then\nthe third day\nyou celebrate this insanity by running\n52.4 miles like a double marathon to\nbring you back to where you started and\ni'm reading this article and i just it\nblew my mind like i just didn't think\nthat was humanly possible and the story\nwas really about well david got it part\nof it was about david goggins because he\nhad just done this race right after\ndavid goggins had just done it so he he\ncame into that that world before you\nthen so david yeah i mean dave has been\naround for a long time like i i i mean\ndavid was like like the first podcast\nthat he did was my podcast like in the\nendurance world like everybody knew\ndavid but he wasn't david goggins right\nyou know he's not like it's crazy that\nhe's this cultural phenomenon now\nbecause he was a guy who was doing lots\nof races in the ultra endurance world\nwhich is a very small world and\neverybody kind of knew him but he didn't\nhave any visibility outside of that\nwhatsoever but he had just done the bad\nwater 135 merit double ultra marathon\nand then he had\ndone this ultraman race and he had all\nkinds of problems his pedal broke and he\nhad to tape his shoe to the it was like\nhis crazy\nstory and i'd never heard of david prior\nto this and it was about him being this\noverweight powerlifting football playing\nnavy seal guy who then decided to tackle\nall of these difficult endurance\nchallenges to raise funds in honor of\nsome of his fallen brothers right at the\nsame time the description of this race\nvery clearly positioned it as\nmuch more of a spiritual journey than a\ncompetitive event it is a world\nchampionship event there are athletes\nthere that want to win\nbut it's hands they hand select just 35\npeople from all over the world they keep\nit really small\nand the overarching goal and there was a\nquote from the race director was to\nprovide every athlete and their crews\nbecause it's a self-supported thing you\ngot to bring people along with you\nto have\na spiritually transformative experience\nas a result of\nnot just this difficult endeavor but\nreally connecting with\nthe island of hawaii which is has\nmagical\npowers in many ways like it's a very\npowerful place\nand i realized in reading it that that\nwas what i was looking for i didn't want\nto do an iron man to like check a box or\nsay that i did this thing like i was\nstill\nvery much wrestling with this\nexistential crisis and i was on some\nform of a spiritual journey\nof self-understanding and this just\nseemed like\nan unbelievable vehicle for that\nexploration and something inside me\nclicked and i was like i am doing this\nthing i don't know how\nor when\nbut this is what i've been looking for\nand\ni just\nthen proceeded to assume that some way i\nwas going to find my way into this race\nbecause again you can't just sign up for\nit they have to like select you you have\nto apply but i just assumed i was going\nto work that out and just\nproceeded accordingly as if i'd already\nbeen admitted yeah and so do you have to\ndo any races before then to then qualify\nfor those or is it just like because it\nseems like it's 35 people quite elite\nwhere they're gonna just be like yeah\nman you haven't done enough at this\npoint well yeah that i mean that was my\ndilemma now\nthat race has become so popular that\nthere are a lot of things that you have\nto do in order to in order to do it um\nwhat i did\nand this was a different time\nwas i just called up the race director\nlike her name was in the thing and i\nfound her online and i just called her\nup and i said i read this article\ni i can't stop thinking about this like\ni literally couldn't sleep i was like i\nhave to figure this out\nand\ni just told her i'm like i really want\nto do this and she said what have you\ndone and i basically said i haven't done\nanything like i was very honest with her\ni said please just tell me now that it's\nyou're never going to let me in so i can\nat least go to sleep and like forget\nabout this\nand\nand she said something amazing to me\nwhich was i'm not saying she didn't say\nyes and she didn't say no she said why\ndon't you call me in a couple months\nbecause this was very early it was very\nfar out from like the deadline or all of\nthat\nand that was all that i needed like she\njust gave me that little glimmer of hope\ni ended up hiring a coach i told him\nthis is what i'm doing\nhe was like you're crazy but okay i'll\ntry to prepare you as best as i can\nand he put me on you know an incredibly\nrigorous training program that ramped up\nvery slowly\nbut ultimately was extremely challenging\nand i stayed in communication with that\nrace director i had my coach write a\nletter saying i'm going to get him as\nprepared as i possibly can and she\nlet me in and you know had she not like\nmy life would have been very different i\nthink\nyeah this is the thing i was really\ninterested about with you because i've\nalways thought that these types of\nthings are spiritual journeys it's i\nmean i guess there are probably some\npeople that go there just\ncompetitiveness but i would think that\nprobably a lot of them it is a journey\nlike an inward journey to do something\nlike this\nso for you going and signing up and\nactually getting into this race what was\nthe spiritual journey like for you going\nin we said it's 320 miles yeah yeah i\nmean\nit was a journey that played out through\nthe through the course of of preparing\nfor it because\nas any ultra endurance athlete will tell\nyou you're spending an unbelievable\namount of time with yourself\nin an elevated heart rate situation\nwhere\nyou're connecting with your breath\ni wouldn't characterize it as meditation\nbut it is a form of active mindfulness\nright uh\nthat\nthat i think\ngave me the space to really go inward\nlike if i was on an eight-hour bike ride\nlike you can't listen to music you know\nit's like\ni was going deep inside myself and\ntrying to understand what makes me tick\nwhat it is that i want to do and all i\nknew\nwas that this was making me happy and i\nfelt directed\nand after that 24 mile trail run i made\na decision and a promise to myself that\ni would that i would no longer ignore\nthe things that brought me joy in my\nlife and\nit was this understanding that\nthat\nthose things weren't having a certain\nkind of house or a certain kind of car\nor\na job it was the feeling of the sun on\nmy shoulders at dawn on a trail run or\nwhat it feels like to jump into a\nswimming pool like these are things that\nmade me so happy as a kid\nswimming\nand i just completely put them in a\nrear-view mirror and said i'm an adult\nnow so i just said this is i enjoy doing\nthis and i'm going to\nprioritize making time to continue to do\nthis even though it doesn't make sense\nthere's no logical path forward for me\nit's not like i'm going to become a\nprofessional athlete or figure out a way\nto make money doing this but i didn't\ncare it just felt\ni can't the only way i can explain it is\nthat it just felt like the right thing\nto do for me\nyeah\num you're familiar with charlie ingle\ni'm sure right yeah i know charlie well\nso uh i i met him at an event and we\nspeak pretty often and he\nis uh he he told me kind of the same\nthing as well i mean he did i think 5\n000 miles across the city or a desert\nand uh and it's it's a completely inward\njourney you know like it's and that's\nthe\nbut what's what's interesting about what\nyou said\nis that you didn't want to not do\nanything that didn't make you happy\nanymore which i think that a lot of\npeople get away from you know there's a\nlot of people that email in and they're\nmessing me on instagram or facebook or\nwhatever it is and they're like you know\ni just\ni don't know what makes me happy anymore\nand like you're saying it usually goes\nback to childhood and it's like we\nalmost build up this who we're supposed\nto be and forget about who we actually\nare and it seems like this spiritual\njourney was kind of a journey back to\nwho you were and who you truly are as a\nchild who i was all along right\nand then just over time it seems like\nyou just\nyou know\nyou you figured out through society of\npeople around you who you were supposed\nto be but in reality that wasn't the\nthing that actually made you happy yeah\nbecause my whole life was directed\ntowards becoming this you know\nrespectable upwardly mobile person right\nright and there wasn't room for what i\nwanted to do like that was just never\nlike i said earlier never really part of\nthe conversation yeah with myself yeah\nand so\nwhen you're doing something like this\ni'm sure a lot of people like there's\nprobably a lot of pain that you're going\nthrough when you're going through this\nbut you have a really unique perspective\non pain in your relationship with it\ndon't you\nyeah i mean pain is a phenomenal\nteacher you know pain doesn't lie pain\nis truth\num you know pain has been\nthe thing that has taught me the most\nthrough\ndark nights of the soul and through my\nsuccesses and it is a weird thing like i\nremember as a kid in the swimming pool i\nwas not the most talented swimmer\nbut\ni also realized that i was willing to\nendure more suffering than the other\nkids\nand that's how i was able to bridge a\ncertain talent deficit gap and achieve a\ncertain level of proficiency in that\nsport\nand from and that was meaningful to me\nback then so i always be so i just\nbecame the grinder like i'm not the\nsmartest i'm not that but i will outwork\nyou every single time\nand\nthat's good\nin certain doses but you know that's\nalso what led to the workaholism or that\ncreates a situation in which you're\nblind to the other areas of your life\nthat require your\nyour attention but i think\nthe endurance training helped me kind of\ncalibrate what that\nrelationship should be\nand i realized that my ability or my\nwillingness to suffer\nis a strength if i could channel it in a\nhealthy way and ultra endurance is you\nknow a pretty good template yeah for\nsomebody who's not afraid to suffer a\nlittle bit for sure\ni'm thinking that there's probably\npeople listening and saying well you\nwent from alcoholism to workaholism to\ndoing this\nand i'm sure there's probably people who\nsaid it to you before it's like oh you\njust traded to a new addiction sure but\nfor you what's your your viewpoint on\nthat because i don't i personally don't\nsee it that way but i'm sure you don't i\nthink there's truth in that\nyeah i think it's i think people who\ndismiss that are not being honest with\nthemselves if you go to any ultra\nendurance event there's so many people\nin recovery really yeah so many lots of\ntattoos\nlots of former junkies because\nit is a spiritual journey and a lot of\ndrug addicts\nare people who have that hole in their\nsoul or in their spirit and their\nseekers like they they initially seek it\nout through drugs and alcohol\nthen they get sober but that hole is\nstill there yearning to be filled\nso i think it's very easy to lapse into\nan unhealthy relationship with these\nkinds of pursuits\nthere's a trope uh called the you know\nthe iron man widow like you know\nmiddle-aged dudes who get into iron man\nand they just want to train all the time\nand then they're never home and you know\nother areas of their life suddenly\naren't getting\nproper attention and their lives kind of\nfall apart i've seen that a lot um so\ni'm somebody who is prone to having like\ni have buddies you know they you know\nwhat they want to do is like go to vegas\nwith their friends and play golf and\ngamble or whatever and when i think\nabout like oh wouldn't it be great to\nlike get a cabin in the woods by myself\nand i could just train you know\nso you know i can easily\nuh\nfall into\na situation in which it is out of\nbalance for me so i have to be very\nmindful about that and i've been i've\nyou know i've flirted with that in my\nlife before so\nbasically what i'm saying is i'm i'm\nadmitting or conceding that\nthat\nthe addiction piece\ncan and at times does play a part in my\nrelationship to\nendurance\nbut overall\ni think it's important to also\nacknowledge that that's an overly binary\nsimplistic way of looking at it for sure\nthe drink was always the way out the\nescape you know putting on the running\nshoes is hard yeah it's not yeah it's\njust it's like it's not like when you're\nwhen you're when you're doing drugs and\nalcohol like you just you don't want to\ndo\nanything that isn't pleasure oriented\nand\nendurance training is exactly the\nopposite it's all about doing what you\ndon't want to do yeah do you feel like\ndrugs and alcohol is more of like you\ndon't want to feel and when you do\nultras and do this stuff it's more of\nyou actually feel more you definitely\nfeel more and there is this deep\ninterconnectedness with yourself that\nthat occurs because it's just it's\nbetween you and you and you're alone\nwhether you're in a race or you're\ntraining you know what do you what are\nyou going to do when you're at mile x\nand you feel like you can't go another\nstep like that's where you meet your\ntruth and you can't lie to yourself\nabout who you are or what you're capable\nof and i think those\ndifficult moments come\nearly and often in the endurance world\nand those are the things that reveal\ncharacter they provide you with these\ntests to\nyou know grapple with who it is exactly\nthat you are and uh and and through kind\nof continuing to show up for that\nand\nand\num eclipsing some of those boundaries\nyou start to develop a broader sense of\npossibility and potential for yourself\nthat spills out into every area of your\nlife yeah i've heard david goggins talk\nabout you know the rule of 40 i've heard\nthat you you agree with that as well\nwhere it's basically like\nwhen you feel like you can't go anymore\nyou're only about 40 of what your actual\nfull capacity is\num\nwhat's your relationship with that and\nalso at the same time what do you feel\nlike you've learned about yourself going\npast that point that you thought was\njust absolute\ncan't go any further from that yeah i\nmean i've had i've had lots of those\nexperiences you know i think that that\nmaxim is rooted in the idea\nthat the body is stronger than the mind\nand usually it's the mind that that that\nkicks out before the body right because\nwe're not men we're not as men you can\ntrain all you want but if you're not\nmentally strong\nyour your achilles heel like the weak\nweak link in your chain is your mind\nyeah right\nand your mind is going to get you to\nquit\nwell before the body needs to shut down\nyeah it's probably a safety mechanism\nprobably i'm sure there's an\nevolutionary you know advantage to all\nof that so that you don't you know\noverly harm yourself for sure\ndo you have uh\ndo you talk to yourself when you're\ndoing this do you have like a\npositive self-talk of of when you're\ngoing through this or do you just try to\nclear everything because i'm real\ncurious as as far as what's going\nthrough your head\nwhen it is really hard or when you know\nyou still have a hundred miles in front\nof you or whatever it might be\nyeah i don't really have\na specific practice in that regard i\nmean i would say that\nthat i do my best when i'm as present as\npossible and there's something about\nlike that\nlow-grade\nsuffering where your heart rate is\nelevated and you're connecting with your\nbreath\nthat tends to mute out whatever your\nbrain is you know whatever if you were\nsitting in a chair\nwithout a formal meditation practice\nyour brain is going to start looping\nsome stories and you'll just get lost in\nthought\nbut\nwhen you're in that active state there\nisn't a lot of room for that like you\nhave to be really present with what\nyou're doing and when you reach those\nmoments\nwhere\nyou feel like you can't keep going or\nlike you can't i don't i don't think\nabout the destination i just try to be\npresent with how i'm feeling and what\ni'm doing in the moment\nbut of course your brain's going to go i\ncan't i'm so tired i can't i'm not even\nhalfway done with this thing i'm never\ngoing to make it\nin those cases\ni default to\nbreaking it down into the tiniest chunks\npossible which is i'm just gonna all i\nneed to do is like get to that\nlantern you know the next street lamp or\nwhatever and then i'll worry about\neverything else after i get there that's\nthe only thing that i'm focused on is\nhow can i get how can i cross this next\n100 meters and there's a lot of that\ni'm trained in that regard because so\nmuch of 12-step recovery is similar\nthis precept that\nyou don't have to worry about not doing\ndrugs and alcohol for the rest of your\nlife you just have to your head has to\nhit the pillow tonight it's over that's\nall you got to worry about like breaking\nit down into small bite-sized chunks so\nthat\nthe challenge becomes as digestible as\npossible yeah rich da vinnie talked\nabout that the other day when he was in\nhere and it's it's i think it's it's\nfunny because there's so many life\nlessons that are just so simple you know\nand he talks about when he's in these\ncrazy missions and\nand it's just like we just got to get to\nthe next five minutes from now we just\ngot to get to the next\ntree that's over there whatever it might\nbe and i think there's so many lessons\nin life of just\nthe same way that you're saying it don't\nthink about the whole 50 miles that you\nstill have in front of you it's just\nlike most people get paralysis by\nanalysis thinking of oh my gosh i want\nto build this business i want to create\nsomething amazing but they don't think\nabout like what's the next 15 minutes\nand what i need to do to get me closer\nto there and then they're paralyzed\nbecause what they actually want seems so\nfar away from them i mean analysis\nparalysis is a huge one i mean i would\nhave never done ultraman if i was\nwaiting to figure out the answer to all\nthese questions\nam i going to get in what kind of bike\ndo i need what kind of shoes you just\nhave to start everything that i've ever\nbeen successful at i just started doing\nit without any of the answers and i've\nlearned to trust\nthat the journey unfolds in front of you\nand all those questions get resolved or\nanswered in due time\nbut\nprogress is made through action not\nthrough trying to solve all of this in\nyour mind while you sit at home and do\nnothing for sure and it's\nthe simple\nyou know the journey of a thousand miles\nbegins with a single step just take the\nfirst step and don't worry about mile\n478\ni'm curious with you is there is there\nanything that you haven't done at this\npoint\nthat you see is like the next\nmountaintop for you i know you're\ntalking about being present and all that\nbut is there something that that that\nkind of makes you click on the same way\nthat the the ultraman did\ni don't feel that i have anything that i\nneed to\nprove to myself or to anybody else\nphysically i still love\nendurance training and i'm sure i'll do\na race here and there and maybe i'll\nreally gear up for a race at some point\nto see what i can do but that really you\nknow isn't my primary motivator um\nyou know the internal work is never done\nright so\nyou know i've been sober a long time but\ni'm still prone to all kinds of\ncharacter defects and things that you\nknow i could\nwould be would be well advised to better\nmaster than i have\num and now i'm a parent i've got four\nkids i've got two teenagers you know\nthey need my attention and my time so my\nfocus is how can i be the best dad\nand professionally\nmy my kind of north star is trying to\nfigure out a way to\nimpact as many people as i possibly can\nin the most meaningful substantive and\nand\num\neffective way possible so the podcast\nthe books that i do\nthe speaking all of that is oriented\naround\naround that and when you're an endurance\nathlete you want to train 25 30 hours a\nweek like those two things you know they\ncompete yeah and uh and so as much as it\nwould be cool to set aside everything\nand train like a madman to see what i\ncould do as a\nmid-50s year old guy\nhow\nis that really meaningful to the broader\nmission of trying to be a force for\npositive good in the world so\nmy focus is really on the work that i'm\ndoing now yeah\ni'm curious with you know you going\nthrough how long have you been sober now\nwell i got sober in 96\num i had a little bit of a lapse 13\nyears ago one day left so i had to\nrecalibrate the clock so i got to be\ncareful\ni mean i went to treatment in 96 so it's\nonly 24 no 98 i'm sorry so\nnine so that would be coming up on 23\nyears but really you know coming up on\nlike 14. yeah i'm curious with you with\nwith\npeople say even when they're in recovery\nthey say you know i'm rob and i'm an\nalcoholic i'm curious your thoughts on\nthat of saying that they're an alcoholic\neven when they're in recovery do you\nfeel like that\nmakes it easier for someone you feel\nlike it could make it harder because\nthey're still identifying with a past\nversion of themselves\nuh you know i try not to i'm not in the\nbusiness of passing judgment on how\nother people think about their own\nalcoholism i only have my own experience\nthat's another thing i've learned in\nrecovery like i don't give advice i\nshare my experience\nmy experience is that\nalcoholism is something that\nthat\ni have that's part of who i am that\nrequires a lot of attention in order to\nkeep at bay and my relapse\nwas a profound teacher in that regard\nbecause\nthat was a period of time in which i\nnever questioned whether or not i was an\nalcoholic but i thought i had a handle\non it and\nmy meeting attendance had slipped my\nkind of\nprioritization of my\nrecovery routine wasn't what it had been\nbefore\nand i'd really made\nendurance training my higher power for\nlack of a better word like i had put i\nwas all in on this i was going back to\nultraman in 2011\nand my goal was to win the race and i\nwas like so fit and\ncrazy ready but i really hadn't been\npaying attention to my recovery that\nrace ended up not going well\ni ended up dnfing i had all kinds of\nproblems and i was so despondent and\nbecause\ni hadn't been adequately taking care of\nmyself in that way i was\nprimed for a relapse and i can tell you\nafter\none sip of a beer it was like game on it\nwas like\nmy alcoholism had been doing push-ups in\nthe dark all along and was like ready to\ngo really and it was\nscary\nreally scary wow so that immediately\ndisabused me of any idea that i could\none day drink like a gentleman was very\nclear\nthat it went immediately\nwithout any thought on my part like it\nwas so spontaneous and strange how it\nhappened\nbut\nvery clear\nthat that's something i can never do\nagain\nand ultimately has\nbeen\na seemingly negative experience that\nended up turbocharging my recovery\nprogram\nbecause it was so clear that like this\nis something that you know for me\ni'm always going to live with and i'm\nokay with that\nbecause the process of getting sober and\nthe principles and the tools that i've\nlearned and the number of people that i\nnow get to help\nhas given my life like you know\nincredible meaning\num as far as being a vegan uh i know you\nguys you and your wife have cookbooks\nmy girlfriend i purchased it like six\nyears ago that's how we started going\nvegan and everything and uh i'm curious\nwith you\nuh with being a vegan what are some of\nthe best i mean you talked about the\nbenefits as far as energy\nand it didn't seem like it was a you\nknow pro animal thing for you but over\nthe time that you've been doing it for\nfor how many years is this that you've\nbeen like almost 14 years 14 years um\nwhat have you noticed and obviously\nyou don't seem like a type person wants\nto recommend or tell people what to do\nin any sort of way but for people who\nare out there that are thinking about in\nsome sort of way like they've maybe they\nare on a journey where they've looked at\nthemselves in the mirror and be like\nmaybe i should go vegan\nwhat's the simplest way to do something\nlike that i think there's a lot of\non-ramps uh to this lifestyle that has\nbeen such a positive in my life so it\nreally depends upon what people are\nsensitive to or interested in for me\nlike i said it was kind of vanity and it\nwas just wanting to feel good it was a\nvery selfish concern but after doing\nthis for so long and being very steeped\nin the plant-based movement\ni've become much more passionate about\nthe environmental implications of the\nfood that we eat\nthe health considerations\nthe food that we eat and the suffering\nthat is incident to\na system of conglomerized animal\nagriculture that is\ndisgusting by any measure even the\nardent meat eater\ncan't you know get on board with the\npractices of factory farming at the\nhighest level and i think on the\nin addition to that\nthe united states being this\nunbelievably prosperous country\nour our health outcomes are not so good\nand millions and millions of people are\nsuffering from\nan accelerating\nuh\nrate of\nchronic\ndisabilities that are entirely lifestyle\nrelated whether it's obesity type 2\ndiabetes hypertension\nheart disease of course\nall of these things are directly\ncorrelated to the foods that we eat\nand americans have a taste for highly\nprocessed food food that's very high in\nsaturated fat\nand artificial ingredients\nand the like and it's making us very\nunwell and so the way that i look at the\nplant-based lifestyle\nis like this\nmeans of\nchecking all kinds of boxes you're being\nhealthier for yourself\nthe animals are happier they're\ncertainly you know happy that you're not\nconsuming them and it's better for the\nenvironment i mean right now\nwe're in the midst of a mass species\nextinction\nwe are raping and pillaging the rain\nforest to clear them to raise crops for\nfor animal feed\nand uh\nand the deleterious environmental impact\nof i mean i just listed like one thing\nout of a million things that get packed\ninto animal agriculture the extent to\nwhich it's um\npolluting our waterways and creating\nthese algal blooms and it's just\nit's just it's not sustainable it's not\nsustainable so like i said it's not\nincumbent upon me to tell anybody how\nthey should live but\ni don't miss eating the way that i did\nbefore i feel great 54 i still can go\nout and kill it you know i rode 40 miles\ntoday i feel good\nand it's nice to opt out of\nparticipating in a system that's really\njust creating harm yeah for sure and i\ndon't stand on any pedestal with this\neither like i'm not better than anyone\nelse because i'm eating a vegan diet\nit's not a harm-free lifestyle it's just\nan aspiration to live a little bit more\ngentle on the planet\nyeah and going back to that book that\nyou were taught engine 2 where so my\nbrother-in-law is i remember when i\ndecided i wanted to start eating vegan i\ngot everybody made fun of me right\nbecause they're like oh you okay\nand uh and it's not as bad as people act\nlike it is like there's some really\ndelicious stuff that you can have like\nit's not like you just eat lettuce all\nday long but uh but my brother-in-law's\na firefighter so he's wow he loves in\naustin no he's a firefighter in tampa\nso he um\nbut people don't realize going back to\nto firefighters is they go their bodies\ngo through a lot like heart attacks are\nvery common for them at young ages uh\nstrokes are very common at young ages\nfor them so my brother-in-law\nhad a second heart attack and he's not\nlike severely overweight in any sort of\nway he had a second heart attack and\nthey decided to you know\ngive it a shot\nbecause his cholesterol is really high\nhis cholesterol dropped like 20 points\nin two weeks and just like crazy how\nfast it happened\nit's amazing how\nhow quick the body can change like it's\nit is made to\nshift the way that it needs to and once\nyou start feeling really good you\nrealize for how long you actually felt\nreally bad and you realize you didn't\nhave energy for a long time and you're\nlike oh my god this is like you're\nsaying you're like oh my god i do have\nthis surplus of energy in ways\nyou know yeah yeah\nyeah the body is unbelievably resilient\nand i learned that with food as well as\nwith the endurance stuff it's like you\nthink it's only capable of doing x until\nyou eclipse that boundary and then you\nrealize that there's so much more\npotential baked into all of us if we can\njust you know embrace the possibilities\na little bit more broadly for sure\nwell rich i appreciate it it's been\ngreat man\nwhere can people find you\nuh what's going on in your easy to find\nritual podcasts wherever you listen to\npodcasts richworld.com is kind of where\nall my stuff
