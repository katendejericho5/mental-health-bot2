    "transcript": "i think the purpose of this life purpose\nof us being that's all i'm here to do\nthere is nothing else for me to do\nexcept\ntoday i'm going to talk about what the\npurpose of life is yes\ni'm gonna go into the subject i'm gonna\ndive into it i'm gonna try to answer the\ntoughest question in the entire world\nthe question that every single person\nsince the beginning of time has asked\nhimself why am i here what's the purpose\nof me being here what's the purpose of\nmy life and before i dive into it let me\nstate my ignorance okay i don't know all\nof the answers i don't claim to know all\nof the answers i definitely don't think\nthat i know\nmost answers\ni'm 35 years old don't claim to know\neverything i don't think that i'm a guru\ni never want to be a guru any of those\nthings\ni'm still working on myself i think i'll\nbe working on myself to the day i die\nand i've been working on growing myself\nfor 15 years now\nbut with that i have coached thousands\nand thousands of people over the time\nthat i've been working on myself\nand working with other people\nand i feel like for for most of the\nboxes that people want to check off in\ntheir life as far as you know happiness\nsuccess money whatever it is that you\nwant to say i feel like i've checked off\nmost of the boxes that people want to\ncheck off in their time and i spent a\ngood portion of my life\nbeing happy in creating some form of\nhappiness but more than anything else\nactually just going straight for money\nlike money was my main purpose in life\nit's the thing i was going after more\nthan anything else\nand you know i was able to to realize\nthe way that we all know right that\nmoney doesn't give you happiness like\nmoney does not make you happy i realized\nwhat everyone before me has ever said\nright and i knew that money didn't make\nme happy but i was like you know what\nlet me make some money first and then\ndecide if i want to be happy from there\nor not it didn't change anything in my\nlife everything was exactly the same the\nonly thing it really allowed me to do\nwas to be able to do things that i\nwasn't able to do before and to be able\nto buy things that i wasn't able to buy\nbefore but\ndoing the things that i did didn't make\nme happy and buying the things that i\nbought didn't make me happy as well so\nif i felt like i checked off many of the\nboxes that i'm supposed to check off in\nmy life but i still wasn't happy as i\ncould be or i didn't feel as fulfilled\nas i could be then why the hell are we\nhere right what is the purpose of this\nlife and my personal opinion once again\nyou can take this for what it's worth\nyou could take it and fully believe it\nyou can take with a grain of salt either\none is completely fine it's completely\nup to you what you decide to do with\nthis information i think the purpose of\nthis life is to grow spiritually and i\ndon't mean religiously because i think a\nlot of religion actually restricts most\ngrowth and most most spiritual growth\nand most personal growth and i'm not\nknocking religion any sort of way\nfor some people\nreligion is the path to\ntheir enlightenment or to happiness or\nto fulfillment for me it just wasn't and\nso when i say\nuh you know\nit's it's the path the work of just\nspirituality for those of you guys that\nmight be atheists or might be agnostic\nanother way of saying it for you just so\neverybody can kind of join in on this\npath that we're talking about here is i\nthink the purpose of us being here if\nyou don't want to say grow spiritually\nwould be just to learn we're here to\nlearn\nthat's it that's all we're here to do\nlife is a classroom\nand\nthat's all that i think that it is we're\nhere to learn we're here to grow we're\nhere to get better and hopefully by the\ntime that we leave this place we end up\ndoing a pretty good job of it i do\nbelieve that there's something after\nlife there's times where i've bounced\nbefore like you know is there something\nafter life is or is there not something\nafter life i've bounced all around and i\npersonally believe that there is um\ni personally think that we might you\nknow have a lot of lives after this one\nyou know there could be reincarnation\ndidn't think i'd ever say that before uh\nit could be on this planet it could be\non another planet it could be in another\ndimension it could be somewhere else\nthat we don't know about i don't know i\ndon't ever i'll never act like i know\nall i know\nis that i get this feeling that i'm here\nto learn i get this feeling that the\npurpose of me being here is to grow to\nlearn and to get better this life that i\nhave is just basically a really big\nclassroom and this classroom\nis not here when i consciously decide to\nstep into the classroom and learn it's\nnot here when i sit down you know i\nconsciously decide you know what now i'm\ngoing to sit down and i'm read i'm\nreading a book that's not when i step\ninto the classroom or when i sit down\nand i say you know what i'm going to\njournal that's not when i step into the\nclassroom when i step into the classroom\nis when anything happens in my life not\nwhen i just decide to journal not when i\njust decide to meditate not when i just\ndecide to read or to\nwrite or to do something my personal\nbelief is that the classroom is every\nsingle second of my life do you feel\nthat way is there something inside of\nyou that kind of feels the same\ni'm curious\ni'd love to hear from you do you feel\nlike it's the same do you think that\nit's different once again i don't i\ndon't have many of the answers i just\nfeel like for me this is what feels\nright and once again this isn't\nsomething that's just like hey when i\nconsciously decide to sit down and do\nsomething that's when i enter the\nclassroom it is every single second of\nmy day is an opportunity to learn and to\ngrow and to get better that could be\nspiritually that could be mentally that\ncould be physically that could be in my\npersonal growth that could be my\nspiritual growth in my relationships\nwith other people every single second\nlife or god or the universe is throwing\npeople in circumstances and things at me\nto allow me to either stay awake and\nwake myself up out of this autopilot\nthat i can go into\nor to wake up and grow from it the thing\nabout in the way that i think about it\nis i don't think that there's a finish\nline that i'll ever cross for like a lot\nof people they think oh well one day\ni'll eventually get to the place that i\nwant to be one day i'll eventually\nyou know\ni'll eventually become enlightened one\nday i'll eventually learn all the things\nthat i learned to need to learn to know\none day i will get to the point where i\nhave all of the knowledge in the world\nor one day i'll finally not be stressed\nout or not have anxiety or whatever it\nis\ni personally don't think that there's\never a finish line that i'll cross i\ndon't know if that's the truth or not i\njust have the feeling\nfor me that it is the truth and for some\npeople that can be stressful because\nthey're like oh my god that means i'm\ngoing to feel this way forever oh my god\nthat means that i'm never going to cross\nthe finish line because our western\nsociety we're raised to think like you\nhave to do and produce and achieve that\ngoal and so when we think growing or we\nthink we're here to learn or we think\nwe're here in school we're here to learn\nspiritually we think that there's\nsupposed to be like some award that we\nget at the end of it or some like test\nthat says we got a an a or you know some\ndiploma that says hey you you pass the\nspirituality of life or whatever it is\nand for some that can be really\nstressful to go oh my god i don't know\nif there's a finish line this is this is\nliterally what i'm going to be doing\nforever that's kind of stressful\nbut for me it's super freeing because\nthen i know\nthat's all i'm here to do there is\nnothing else for me to do\nexcept\nfor me to be inside of a classroom to\nlearn to grow and to get better now i\nunderstand there's some people that are\nlistening to me right now and you're\nlike hold on that's not the only thing\nrob because i'm a parent\ni have to take care of my kids\ni'm a spouse i can't just not pay my\nbills my wife will want to divorce me\nwhat happens to my family if i just go\non this spiritual learning journey that\nyou're talking about what happens if\nthat happens and what i'm saying too is\nif you're thinking that i think what's\nhappening is you're missing the point\nyour growth doesn't come in spite of\nyour family your growth doesn't come in\nspite of the people around you or you\nknow you don't have to leave your family\nand go to india and go on some spiritual\njourney in order to grow\nspiritually mentally physically whatever\nit is your growth doesn't come in spite\nof everyone that's around you your\ngrowth comes through\neveryone that's around you\nthey\nare your actual path\nthey are your path\nso you know i remember i i think of you\nknow a story that that ram das says when\nyou know ramdas is a spiritual teacher\nand you know he was a professor of\npsychology at harvard and then he you\nknow started doing some psychedelics he\nwent to india he went on a spiritual\njourney you know he was wearing a white\nrobe he thought that he was enlightened\nand he had just you know he was on in\nindia for a year or two years whatever\nit was and he came back and he was on\nyou know nothing can bother me life is\nbeautiful i'm this enlightened being and\nthen his dad who is a lawyer picks him\nup at the airport and within like 15\nminutes his dad goes so when are you\ngonna get a job and immediately\nset him off again it was a trigger and\nhe realized in that trigger that he\nwasn't free he wasn't free of his past\nhe wasn't free of all of the things\nmentally that he needed to overcome he\nstill had work to do that is the perfect\nexample of the growth coming through\nthem right how many of you listening\nyour mom or your dad or your brother or\nyour sister can say one thing\nand it triggers you they can say one\nthing and it drives you nuts they say\none thing and it's like\noh my god i was having such a good day\nbefore that happened your growth\nis on the other side of that it's not\nthat they trigger you it's that they\nsaid something that brought up something\nin you that was already there nobody\ngives you nobody makes you mad what\nhappens is they do something that brings\nup the madness inside of you or the\nanger that's inside of you your journey\nis through them\nright your mom saying the stuff that\ndrives you nuts\nyour children having a mental breakdown\ninside of chick-fil-a right like your\nspiritual journey is through that moment\nhow you react there your spouse doing\nand saying the things that drive you\ncrazy were like oh my god how many\nfreaking times do i have to tell him to\nstop putting his underwear on top of the\nkitchen\nsink whatever i don't know hopefully\nyour husband isn't putting because i\ndon't know what's up with the kitchen's\nsick whatever he's doing he's doing\nsomething and your spiritual journey is\nnot in spite of that your growth in this\nworld is not in spite of that your\ngrowth is through that\nall of it all of it is here for you to\ngrow every single second is here for you\nto grow and i personally see all of this\nas a game life presents you with things\nwith people with opportunities with\ncircumstances to show you where you're\nstill hung up a trigger is a teacher\nit teaches you where you still need to\ndo work do i still get triggered\nabsolutely\nbut then i'm like oh\nyep\nstill hung up there still got some work\nto do rob it's all like a little game\nand it becomes fun in my opinion because\nyou start to notice this game it's like\ni'm constantly playing a game all day\nlong and the better that you become at\nthis game the better that you work\nthrough the better that your life\nbecomes so the better that you become at\nthis game the better that every single\nperson's life becomes\naround you every single person that\nyou're close to everyone in your family\nevery single person's life becomes\nbetter when you work on yourself every\nsingle moment to become better\ndoes that make sense to you because the\nmore you work on yourself the better you\nbecome and the better you become the\nbetter the lives around you become not\njust your family but every single person\nperson that's handing you the coffee in\nthe drive-thru that person's life\nbecomes better by you being better in\nshowing up there right the energy that\nyou bring to that person the way you\ninteract with them it's gonna be that\nway till the day we die in my opinion\nyou know once again take it for what\nit's worth i think it will be that way\nuntil the day we die every single person\nyou come in contact with and maybe we we\nwe go on this spiritual journey and we\ndie and we go somewhere maybe we die and\nwe get another life maybe we die and\nnothing happens i don't know\ni'm not going to sit up here and just\ntell you that i know what happens like a\nlot of people will i don't know what the\nhell happens but from my point of view\nwhen you live your life\nknowing that this is a classroom\nthat we're going to be triggered those\ntriggers are teachers that we're going\nto get hung up that we're going to get\nagitated we're going to get pissed off\nwe're going to get sad we're going to\nmess things up we're going to act in\nways that we look at\nand look back on and wish that we would\nhave done different we're going to mess\nthings up all of those are just\nopportunities to show us where we need\nto get better knocks next time not to\njudge ourselves in think about how\nterrible that action was and to judge\nourselves and to put emotion into it and\nto get pissed off no none of those\nthings it's the opportunity to go yep\ni see what i did there i did mess up you\nknow what next time i'm gonna do it\nbetter it's a teacher it's a lesson\nevery moment is a teacher every single\nmoment is a lesson and to ignore those\nlessons\nis like failing a test\nand then not studying before you take\nthe test again right imagine that you\ntake a test and you don't do well in the\ntest and the teacher says hey i'll give\nyou one more chance to take the test\ncome back next week\nwould you study\nof course you would hopefully you would\nbut to have a trigger happen to you a\nlesson a teacher happened to you and for\nyou to do nothing before it happens\nagain\nis like failing at a test doing nothing\nin between the time of the next test and\nyou take the next test and fail again\nit's all just classroom it's all just\nlessons it's all just teachers and once\nagain this is not just when you sit down\nthis is every single second of your day\nare you taking a step back\nand seeing what's going on in your head\nseeing how you're reacting seeing what's\ngoing on because it's all in front of\nyou all everything you need to work on\nin your life is literally it's right\nhere\nat every single moment to improve to get\nbetter to improve to get better you are\nhere to learn what are you here to learn\nwhat are you here to grow from\nthink about that write it down\nwhat am i here to learn what are some of\nthe triggers that set me off that i know\ni need to work on what are some of the\nthings that i don't like about my\nreactions that i get angry too quickly\nthat i get emotional that i get\nsad too often what is it that what are\nthe emotions what are the triggers what\nis it that my mom does what is it that\nmy dad does what is it that my my spouse\ndoes that my children do\nwhat is it that they do that trigger me\nbecause once again it's not that they're\nbringing that thing to you it's that\nthey're bringing that thing out of you\nso if somebody something happens and you\nget really angry that anger was inside\nof you that person didn't create the\nanger that anger was inside of you\nokay so what do i need why did that\ntrigger me and what do i need to do to\nrelease that anger so that next time\nthat happens again i don't react in the\nsame way failed the test last time gonna\nmake sure i'm gonna pass the test this\nnext time\nright where are you still hung up where\nare the triggers that are in front of\nyou it's so important to think of this\nway and to realize\nwe're going to be here for life baby\nlike there is no getting out of this\nthing there isn't you know like there's\nliterally if you guys have been\nfollowing me long enough i have a tattoo\non my wrist you might be able to see for\nthose of you guys that are looking\nonline\nyou know there's a tattoo on my wrist\nand it's a roman numeral for ten\nthousand right i've only got two tattoos\nthis is one of them it's a roman numeral\nfor ten thousand it's an x with the line\nabove it\nand because i personally believe in the\nten thousand hour rule which is\ni love the idea of mastering something\nin order to master something it takes\nten thousand hours of deliberate\npractice not just like practicing but\ndeliberate practice pushing yourself to\nbe better push yourself push yourself\npush yourself for ten thousand hours the\nreason why i got this on my wrist is\nbecause i believe that personal mastery\nis not just a ten thousand hour thing\npersonal mastery is the rest of your\nlife thing and once again like i said\nearlier that can be stressful for some\npeople to think oh my god i'll never get\nout of this race i'll never get out of\nthis classroom\nor\nit could be really freeing knowing\ni just gotta wake up and try to get\nbetter each day i just gotta wake up and\ntry to be nicer each day i gotta wake up\nand be less angry each day i gotta wake\nup and treat people better each day i\ngotta wake up and do one good deed for\npeople every single day\nso\nwhat are you here to learn\nwhere are you still hung up\nand where do you have the opportunities\nto grow\nbecause that's all that we're here to do\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well there\nhas never been a study that's been done\nlike this some of them became drug\naddicts some of them became successful\nsome of them became ceos and one person\nin the study even became the president\nof the united states"
