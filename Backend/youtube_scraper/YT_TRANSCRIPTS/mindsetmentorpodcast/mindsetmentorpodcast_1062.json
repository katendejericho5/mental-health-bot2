    "transcript": "if the universe is ever going to give me\nmessages\nit's going to be now\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow not long ago i went back in time in\na time machine now\nlet me explain what i mean by this and\ni'm gonna start off by telling you the\nstory so uh a few weeks ago was my 35th\nbirthday party and we had a bunch of\npeople come over to my house uh this\nhouse that we just newly moved into not\ntoo long ago and we probably had 25\npeople come over to the house and\nthere's a bunch of friends that lived\naround town and one of my friends who\ncame over is a friend who just recently\nmoved to austin\nand he was actually my roommate in\ncollege for my last year of college\nright before i dropped out to go start\nmy business and uh and i kind of went\ninto\nwe're all sitting outside we're all\nhanging out we're all talking\nand i was looking over at him and i this\nflashback to when we used to be\nroommates and how different\nmy life is now compared to the way my\nlife was then now we were roommates uh\n2008 going into 2009. so we're talking\nuh at this point in time about 12 years\nago right 11 12 years ago or so\nand\nat that point in time my life was only\nabout a couple things my life was how\ncan i get drunk as quick as i possibly\ncan\nand how can i do a whole lot of drugs\nright\nand i'm telling you this because i want\nyou to understand i'm i'm not this\nperfect person who's just been this\nmaster of mastermind like of my mind or\nanything like that for my entire life\nthe way i get into doing what i do now\nuh in in the way i get into teaching\npeople about mindset is because i had to\ntry to master my own mindset to get to\nwhere i am and so people think that i\nwake up and i'm just highly motivated\nand i'm just driven all this stuff no i\nhave to work on myself sometimes harder\nthan anybody else that i know but that\nin turn has given me tools to be able to\nteach people and so when i had this\nlittle flashback thinking about him\ni was like man my life is\nis way different than when we were\nroommates i'm i'm literally a different\nperson the things that i enjoy now i\nwould not have enjoyed then and if if i\nwould have met myself\nin 2009 then\n2008 2009 met myself now\ni would have gone wow\ni can't believe all of this stuff that\nyou've accomplished i can't believe all\nof the things that you've done\nand i say that because i know there's\npeople out there that are listening to\nme right now\nand uh they're thinking to themselves i\ndon't know if i can get out of where i\nam\ni don't know if i can get out of this\nspot i don't know if i have enough\nenergy enough motivation to get out i\ndon't like what my circumstances look\nlike but i also don't see a light at the\nend of the tunnel and there's been many\ntimes in my life where i didn't think\nthat i saw a light at the end of the\ntunnel\nright so when we were roommates\neverything was okay i was in college and\ni was partying and getting drunk as\nquick as i could and\nsmoking weed and doing whippets and\ndoing all that stuff that crazy college\nkids do right\nthen after that i moved out he moved out\ni went and started my own company and uh\nit went well for a while and then it\ndidn't go well\nand i was working so much i started\nactually resenting the place that the\nthe company that i was building because\ni was literally working 110 hours a week\nfor years\nand i was working and i was working i\nwas working myself to bone i had a\nquarter life crisis and i was just over\nit didn't want to do anymore i ran into\nthe ground\nand i had a moment of i don't know how\ni'm going to get out of this and if\nyou've been listening to the podcast\nlong enough you know this moment it's\nwhen i was sitting there and i was uh\nliving off of pasta for two months i was\nfive five months behind in my car\npayment and my car was about to get\nrepossessed\nand i was sitting there and i was like i\ndon't\nknow how i got here\ni don't know\nwhat i'm supposed to do to get myself\nout of here there's no one that i know\nto ask for help and i don't want to be\ndoing this anymore all of the money that\ni did have i had saved about forty\nthousand dollars about eight months\nbefore then i used into my business i\nlost all of it the marketing money\ndidn't come back\nso i was at a point where i didn't have\nanything i was negative i was over\ndrafting non-sufficient funds in my bank\naccount so they're charging me 40 bucks\nfor every charge even though i didn't\nhave the money inside of my bank account\nand so i thought it's so crazy to think\nabout how different my life is now\ncompared to how my life was thin\nand then i thought to myself\nman\nthe thing that has allowed me\nto get to where i am\nis this absolute obsession\nwith always wanting to be better always\nwanting to improve\nnever thinking to myself that where i\nwas was going to be my final destination\nlike just the thought of myself of i\nknow that if i work on myself i can make\nthis better\nand i want to tell you\nthat i was right\ni won't often say that i was right but\nthere was something inside of me there\nwas a gut feeling if you just keep\nworking on yourself rob it's going to\nwork out if you just keep working\nyourself it's going to work out\nand\nit did\nand i can say that i'm\nlove where i am i love i'm proud of\nmyself for all the stuff that i've done\ni'm proud of myself for the business and\nthe achievements and all of those things\nand i don't say it to brag i just say it\nbecause i know that no matter where you\nare\nyou can feel the same you can do the\nsame now you're not going to get it\nright away\nmight take you some time but i promise\nyou it'll be worth it\nand then what popped up to my into my\nhead was\nwith all of that personal development\nall this knowledge that's inside of my\nhead that's something that can never be\ntaken away from me ever right like my\nhouse can be taken away\nyou know my computer\nmy car my\neverything my\ncamera that i'm shooting this on the\nmicrophone i'm speaking into the\ncomputer that's recording and all that\nstuff it can all be taken away\nthe one thing that can never be taken\nfrom me is the knowledge that i've built\nup over years and years and years of\nworking on myself\nand that's the most important thing and\nthe reason why is because that means i\ncan always get it back\nnone of that knowledge can be taken away\nfrom me so people want to buy things and\nthey they want to do all this stuff but\ni think what's really important is is\ntrying to improve yourself at every\nsingle moment\nso then i had another quick little\nflashback and i thought to myself man\nwhen did this this personal development\njourney start\nwhen did this purse development journey\nstart when was it\nand i thought to myself i remember\nhiring my very first mentor i paid him\n500 bucks a month when i was 19 turning\n20 years old i've only paid 350 in rent\nat that time\nand i thought to myself while i was\nstill outside still my birth it's my own\ndamn birthday and i'm thinking this deep\nright there's all my friends all around\npool party all this stuff everyone's\nhanging out outside i'm going into these\ndeep thoughts like i always do because\ni'm so freaking philosophical right and\nthen so i'm thinking to myself\noh man\ni know when it really kicked off\nand it really kicked off\nwhen my mentor told me to read a book\nand hopefully this book sales just spike\nup like crazy today\nbut the book is called the five major\npieces to the life puzzle and it's a\nsuper super short book for those of you\nguys that are looking you know on video\nit's this book right here uh it's a\nshort little tiny book for those of you\nguys that are following on just on the\npodcast that's why you need to be also\nfollowing along on instagram or\nfollowing following along on youtube as\nwell it's a tiny book i mean you can see\nit's\nprobably a hundred and let's see it's\n119 pages it's nothing super easy to\nread\nit was kind of like my gateway drug to\npersonal development\nand um so i thought to myself\ni should go inside\nand pick that book up\nand just see\nif the universe is ever going to give me\nmessages\nit's going to be now\nand i believe that if i go pick up a\nbook and i open up to a page that's a\nmessage that i need to have\nso i went in and my freaking birthday\nparty is still going on at this point\nguys my birthday is still happening and\ni'm i'm walking inside of my frickin\nhouse\nto go see if the universe wants to give\nme any messages for my 35th birthday i\nwalk into the house and lo and behold\nthe universe decided to give me a\nmessage i'm flipping through the pages\nand i'm like you know what i'm just\ngonna pick one and i just open up to a\npage the page that i open up to\ni don't remember i was looking for it i\ndidn't get enough time to look for it to\nfind the actual quote\nbut it said something along the lines of\ndon't underestimate\nwhere you can be in 10 years by\ndedicating\nwork into yourself every single day and\ntrying to improve every single day\nand for me\nit was like this message of\n[Music]\nyou did pretty good you're still doing\ngreat like you might not be where your\nfinal destination is but you're doing\npretty damn good and it was it was\neye-opening for me because i remember\nwhere i was\nwhen i wrote like when i highlighted\nthat because i highlighted the hell out\nof this book very first book i ever had\ni highlighted it i took notes all of\nthat stuff and that's what really\nstarted me into reading it's also really\nstarted me into highlighting and making\nnotes and i thought to myself i remember\nwhere i was\nwhen i highlighted that that's this is\nthe time machine i'm telling you about i\njust flashback to i remember when i was\nselling cutco selling knives in people's\nhouses and i was waiting for someone to\nshow up to her appointment and she was\nlate and so i went back into my car and\ni was inside of my 2000 i think it was\nactually no what was it it was in 1999.\nnissan sentra\nit was all beat up looked like crap and\ni remember i was highlighting\nthis part\nof never underestimate what 10 years of\nworking yourself every single day will\nget you it's like the compound effect\nit's just little tiny improvements over\nyears and years and years put you in a\ncompletely different place\nand that was 15 years ago that i was\nreading that and i thought to myself\nwhat if i never read this book what if i\nnever\nhired my very first mentor what if i\ndecided to quit my job early instead of\nopening a franchise with the business\nwhat if i decided to go the easy route\nwhat if i decided to not follow my heart\nwhat if i decided to finish college\ninstead of dropping out what if i\ndecided to go the route that i was\nsupposed to go the things i was supposed\nto do what if i would have listened to\nsociety instead of listening to my gut\nand i thought to myself my life could\nhave been in a completely different\ncircumstance than it is right now\nif i would have gone the easier routes\nbut one thing that i've done\nconsistently is i've always followed my\nheart on what i felt was the right thing\nto do\nmost of the time i'll be honest with you\nit didn't logically make sense\nmajority of time it didn't logically\nmake sense but for some reason in my gut\nin my heart it felt like it was the\nright thing to do and so what did i do i\njust decided to follow it because i\nthought this feels right let me at least\nsee what happens\ndropping out of college\nto start a business that didn't\nlogically make a whole lot of sense\nthere weren't a whole lot of people at\nmy age you know at that that time i was\n23. they were dropping out of college\nyeah i was 23 i still wasn't done with\ncollege for all of you guys that are\njudging me right i was i was i was going\nthe long route in college 23 dropping\nout of college so they could go and open\ntheir own business\nright normally at that time people are\ntrying to graduate college so that they\ncan get into\nsome company right it didn't logically\nmake sense for me to start a podcast it\ndidn't logically make sense for me to\nstart posting stuff on instagram that\nwas inspirational didn't logically make\nsense for me to try to start making\nviral videos right\nbut all of those things added up to\nwhere i am now once again i'm not\ntelling you any of this stuff to brag\ni'm telling you this just to give you my\nown personal experience of what i've\nnoticed works really well in my life and\nwhat it is is sometimes\nyou know\nlooking at the way that your\nquote-unquote supposed to go and saying\nyou know what that's not what i want to\ndo i know there's some people out here\nthat are listening to me right now that\nare in college and they're thinking\nabout dropping out and nobody's\nsupporting them but something feels\nright about it i know there's some of\nyou that are listening and you're\nthinking about leaving a relationship\nbecause it feels like that's what's\nsupposed to happen feels like you're\nbeing restricted but it doesn't\nlogically make sense i know there's some\npeople that are out there that are you\nhave the feeling that you want to quit\nyour job and start your own business and\nit doesn't logically make sense but\ninside of your gut inside of your heart\nit makes sense i know there's some\npeople out there that are you know you\nhad a little bit of money saved up and\nthe only thing you truly want to do\nright now is travel\nso you want to quit so that you can do\nit\nit doesn't logically make sense but in\nyour heart it makes sense\nand i want you to realize that following\nyour heart is always the right choice\ni've been in all of those situations\nright they're dropping out of college\nbeen in that situation i've been in the\nsituation of needing to break up with\nsomebody i've been in this situation\nquitting my job to start my own business\ni've been in this situation of quitting\na job to go travel for three months and\nbackpack around europe by myself even\nthough none of those things logically\nseemed to make sense at that point in\ntime in my life they all\nfelt right and i think that one thing we\nall need to get better at is listening\nto our gut\nthinking about what feels right versus\nwhat doesn't what logically makes sense\nbecause ultimately as i always say your\ngut is your their gut feeling is your\nemotional compass\nright your brain tries to keep you out\nof danger it tries to keep you out into\nyour comfort zone so it doesn't tries to\nchange as little as possible your gut\nthough your gut knows what's supposed to\nhappen and when you stay in places that\nyou're not supposed to stay in\nyou can feel yourself getting more\ndepressed or slowly slipping away or in\nyou know what i always say is the way\nthat i felt in certain aspects when i\nwas working for somebody when i knew i\nshouldn't be and i want to start my\nbusiness was i felt like i was my soul\nis just slowly dying inside of me and so\ni want you to realize that a couple\nthings that i've realized\nfrom this time machine from this\nflashback from this 35th birthday when i\nwent on this really\ndeep\nthought process\nwas that number one\nworking on yourself\nis always going to pay off there's never\na downside to working on yourself\nright\ninvest the time the money the energy\ninto yourself because there is no better\nroi than working on yourself i\nabsolutely promise you that i've\ninvested into a lot of different things\ni've invested a lot of different things\nfor myself into companies and to real\nestate i still to this day have not\nfound anything that gives me a better\nreturn than putting money into my own\ndevelopment business development\npersonal development mindset whatever it\nis that i'm doing\nthat's the first thing i'll say to you\nand the second and it compounds over\nyears and years and years and years and\nyears so that when you look back like i\nam at 35 and see yourself at 20 years\nold 15 years later you go holy sh\nrob\nyes\nthank you\nfor having this little gut feeling that\nyou followed thank you for reading the\nbooks when you didn't need to read the\nbooks thank you for paying 500 a month\nfor your very first mentor when you\ndidn't really even have the money to do\nit none of it logically makes sense but\nthank you\nfor being wise enough to do that thank\nyou\nthe second thing that i'll say is this\nstop thinking so much of your head and\nstart thinking more with your heart\nbecause it's going to tell you where you\nneed to go\nit will and if you stop listening to\nyour gut if you stop listening to your\nheart eventually\nit's going to stop communicating with\nyou it's going to stop telling you\nbecause there's pointless at that point\nso if you have an urging if you have a\nfeeling\nsomething feels right\nit always is right\nso work on yourself\ndedicate your life to working on\nyourself\ndon't give up on yourself\nand when things get hard ask yourself\nwhat your gut feeling is and try to\nthink of that and follow that path and i\npromise you it will never lead you down\nthe wrong path hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you want to learn\neven more
