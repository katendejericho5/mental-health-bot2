    "transcript": "the five hour rule maybe you replace\nnetflix with learning maybe you play\nsocial media\num everybody it could be life changing\nfor you\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to think outside the box and why\nit's so important for you to think\noutside the box with everything that\nhappens to be going on right now so in\norder to actually go in and tell you why\nthis is important i'm actually to start\nwith a story so in the early 1900s there\nwas a guy who owned a fast food company\nand in this fast food company\nhe was literally like the type of person\nthat was so analytical\nhe had\nfully optimized his business and this is\na true story and so literally to the\npoint where he went through every single\naspect of the business and he thought to\nhimself how can i optimize this and so\nit was a burger place and so he went in\nand looked at the burgers and he said\nokay if i look at the buns if i look at\nthe meat i look at the tomatoes the\ncheese if i look at every single aspect\nfrom how i order it how it gets here how\nit's stored how it's cooked\nhow it's put together how they wrap it\nup how it gets delivered to the customer\nat the at the counter is there ways that\ni can optimize this and so we optimize\nevery single process of making the\nburger then he went through every single\nprocess of making the fries every single\nprocess that he could he goes okay\nnow that the food is fully optimized\nwhat about the soda machines how can i\noptimize the soda machines to make sure\nthat we get the most out of our sewn\nmachines or as fast as possible and this\nis where fast food came from is there\nthese people had burger places and they\nwanted to make them as fast as they\npossibly could versus having sit down so\nhe starts figuring out how he can get\nbetter how he can get better how we can\nget better how can i make sure that the\ncashiers check people out more\nefficiently and we can make as much\nmoney as possible so he goes through\nliterally optimizes his entire business\nand then he goes i don't know how to\nmake anything faster i don't know how to\noptimize anymore and so him and his\nbusiness partner brainstorming\nand he's like you know what i'm i think\ni'm going to do\ni think i'm going to start going to\nother businesses in other industries\noutside of the food industry and just\nsee what they do and see if i get ideas\nand his business partner is like well i\ndon't that doesn't really make sense why\nyou would do that because it makes more\nsense for you to go and see other people\nin the food industry and see what\nthey're doing he's like well i've\nalready done that i'm going to start\ngoing to other industries and see what\nthey're doing so what does he do he\nstarts going to grocery stores then he\ndecides he wants to start going to\nlibraries then he goes to all of these\ndifferent places and one day he goes to\na bank and he walks into a bank and he's\nlike hey you know i i'm i'm down the\nstreet i have a food company and i want\nto just see what you guys do and see if\ni can get some ideas of maybe i can help\nyou guys in some sort of way maybe you\ncan help me in some sort of way\nthey're like yeah i guess that's fine\nyou know you can shadow the manager for\nthe day and um right in the morning as\nyou're shadowing the manager he's like\nhey there's people that are doing\nconstruction outside what are they doing\nand he goes oh we're going to build\nsomething called a drive-through this is\nthe early 1900s we're going to build\nsomething called a drive-through so that\npeople don't have to get out of their\ncars in order to come in and actually\nstart to you know in order to come in\nand actually get money or deposit money\nwhatever it is we're going to allow them\nto actually stay in their car\nin order to put money in whatever they\nneed to do here at the bank and he\nthought to himself oh my god\ni never thought of optimizing my\nbusiness that way i've been trying to\noptimize my business by everything that\ni know in the food industry and when\nsomeone comes in but i never thought\nabout optimizing the customer's\nexperience so that it's faster for them\nso they don't have to get out of their\ncars so it went back to his his uh his\nbusiness partner he said we've got to\nmake this thing called a drive-through\nhe's like what is that explains the\nwhole process to him he's on board you\nknow they gotta take out one of the\nwalls and put up windows and they gotta\nswitch a lot of stuff around he does\nthis and fully optimizes the\ndrive-through process\nand a few years later for millions of\ndollars in the early 1900s ended up\ngetting bought by mcdonald's mcdonald's\nobviously started using drive-throughs\nnow drive-throughs are known like crazy\nnow why do i tell you the story it's\nbecause\nthis guy tried to optimize every version\nof his life everything that he possibly\ncould in his business but what happened\nis he started going outside of his\nindustry outside of what he knew so that\nhe could learn much more everything was\nalready fully optimized he decided to\nlearn from other industries and i\nlearned this from a guy named jeff\nhoffman jeff hoffman is a billionaire he\nfounded priceline.com and he calls\nsomething he does this thing called info\nsponging and info sponging is where he\ntakes time every single day to learn\nsomething that has nothing to do with\nhis business nothing to do with his\nbusiness and what he does is he takes\ntime every single day and he takes a\nthree by five card so he'll read you\nknow a chapter of a book that has\nnothing to do with his industry he'll\nread a magazine that's from a completely\ndifferent industry he'll read and learn\nand try to grow that has nothing to do\nwith his industry and then what he'll do\nis he'll get a three by five card and\nhe'll summarize what he learned for the\nday in this this event he calls info\nsponging he'll write down on a three by\nfive card what it is that he learned and\nwhat he liked about it and then he'll\njust forget about it he takes that three\nby five card he throws it inside of a\nshoe box and at the end of every single\nmonth he takes out the shoe box and he\nlooks through all of the cards and\nthinks about how can i use this in my\nlife or how can i use this in my\nbusiness and sometimes\nmost of the time he can't use it in his\nbusiness in any sort of way it doesn't\nmake any sense but\none day\nhe was reading through and he he was\nlooking through his boxes he looked\nthrough\nand he read an article earlier that\nmonth and it said it was talking about\nhow bananas when bananas get closer to\ntheir expiration date and they're about\nto go bad\nthey're right but they're about to go\nbad they become cheaper and the reason\nwhy is because the grocery stores want\nto make sure that banana gets sold to\nsomebody or else they lose money on it\nand so they lower the prices of bananas\nso therefore they can make sure that\nthey make their money\nand they don't lose any money and he\nthought to himself oh my god i think i\ncan use this and so at that point in\ntime he was in the airline industry and\nhe was his company at that point in time\nwas actually the company that developed\nuh the the kiosk so you can actually\ncheck yourself in get your your flight\ntaken you know your your boarding pass\nprinted out all of that stuff\nso his company was in that industry and\nhe was in the airline industry and\nthought to myself okay now if you look\nat it you might say airlines bananas\nairlines bananas airlines bananas that\ndoesn't make any sense and so what he\ndid though is he said when when when\nbananas are about to go bad they become\ncheaper\nand then he said i wonder\nif the closer and closer and closer it\ngets to a flight taking off if the open\nseats become cheaper so because the fact\nthat he had connections in the airline\nindustry he went to delta he went to\namerican he went to united he went to\nevery single company that he could that\nwas in the airlines and he said hey i'm\ncurious how often do you have seats that\nare not sold and they're like about\n10 to 15 of the seats on all of the\nflights that we have are never sold and\nhe said\nhow much would you be willing to sell\nthose for it if a price if a flight is\n500\nwhat would you be willing to take\ninstead of having an empty seat you know\nknowing that the person is going to have\nluggage no all of this stuff let's work\nit in he sits down at the airlines and\nhe finds out the perfect amount of how\nmuch it would be worth for them\nand so what he does is he develops\npriceline.com\npriceline.com the way that they became\nfamous is that they had a you know\noffer your own price and so as the\nflights got closer and closer and closer\npeople can make an offer so if the\nflight is normally 500 they could say\nlisten i'll pay 400\nand that's my bid i'll pay 300 and\nthat's my bid and the bid would then go\nto the airline companies and they would\nsay to themselves is this worth it is it\nnot worth it and they would either\naccept or decline and if they accepted\nit you had to buy that flight it was\nyour card was automatically charged\nthere was nothing that you could do\nthere were no refunds and so what\nhappened is he built a\nmulti-billion dollar company\noff of the idea that he got from reading\nan article about bananas\nand you would never think that's\nsomething that would happen and so what\ni reason why i'm bringing all this up is\nbecause i want to challenge you to learn\nabout stuff that doesn't make any sense\nfor you at this point i want to\nchallenge you to do this and this brings\nus to what's called the five-hour rule\nokay the five-hour rule\nis the idea with the world changing as\nmuch as it is with things happening i\njust did an episode on on how much the\nworld is changing and how if you don't\nadapt you're gonna be left behind with\nthe world changing as much as it is how\ndo we keep up and the five hour rule\nmakes it super simple here's what the\nfive-hour rule is\nevery single day you should spend monday\nthrough friday you should spend one hour\nreading\nand learning and growing five days per\nweek so five days a week\nall you have to do is read learn and\ngrow preferably outside of your industry\nbut you can also you know learn inside\nof your industry if you don't feel like\nyou've perfected your industry and what\nyou do and i'm going to take the five\nhour rule and i'm also going to take the\ninfo sponge and put them together is\nhave a stack of three by five cards\nread something see how that could work\nfor you write it down that three by five\ncard and when you're done with it you\nput it inside of a shoe box you put it\nwherever it is leave it you know just\nhave a stack on top of your desk\nwhatever it is and at the end of every\nsingle month flip through those cue\ncards flip through all of them and see\nif there's something in there that you\ncan pull into your life if you're a\nbusiness owner this can be massive for\nyou to keep ahead of the competition if\nyou're somebody who is just going to\ncollege and learning and growing this\ncan be massive for you for thinking\noutside of the box and thinking\ndifferently in everything that you do so\nthe five hour rule is to spend you know\none hour per day\nmonday through friday learning where\nthis came from was benjamin franklin\nbenjamin franklin did this every single\nweek right if you want to constantly\nstay on top you've got to constantly\npush yourself to learn and grow and you\nknow it's a commitment to being a\nstudent and always learning and if you\nlook at the\nthe people that that our society looks\nup to the most so the type of people who\nthey seem to know everything right\nthey're so well read they seem so\nthey're so well versed in everything\nthat they have if you look at oprah if\nyou look at warren buffet if you look at\ntony robbins look at elon musk anybody\nthat you look at you're like wow this\nperson seems to know a lot the thing\nthat tends to be the common denominator\neven though they're all in different\nindustries\nis that they all have a commitment to\nlearning and growing and never resting\non the laurels for their success the\ndifference between you know what i have\nseen from a lot of successful people\nthat i know and successful unsuccessful\npeople that i've seen is that\nunsuccessful people tend to just think\nthat they know it all to wrestle\nlaurel's of their success and to never\ngo you know what i'm going to try to\npush myself to be better and the people\nwho are successful act like they aren't\nsuccessful at all they act like they\ndon't have any money they act like\nthey've they're they're the type of\nperson who doesn't have anything they\nnever wrestle lawyers of their success\nthey're constantly trying to learn\nthey're constantly trying to grow and\nthat commitment to being a student is\nwhat helps them out now here's what\nhappens\nin the short term\nthat hour is going to take away\nfrom everything that you do like that's\njust a fact that hour is going to take\naway from an hour of productivity today\nan hour of productivity tomorrow monday\nthrough friday but in the long term the\nknowledge that is gained from it\nwill be massive for you the knowledge\nthat is gained from it will be\nlife-changing for you because you will\nbe so far ahead a year from now you will\nbe so far ahead of every single person\nthat's around you\nthat you're gonna be different you're\ngonna think different now if you do this\nfor two years three years five years ten\nyears\nit could be life changing for you you're\ngoing to be way different than everyone\nin your industry and everyone that you\nhave around you but the key to it is\nthis is to think about how this relates\nto your life\nand to think about when would the best\ntime for me to do this be when's the\nbest time for you when is it during the\nday for me it's usually\nlate afternoon or late morning is the\nbest time for me that's it\nyou look at it and you say okay the late\nafternoon is when i'm going to do it\nusually about 10 to 11 o'clock is when i\nfeel like my brain is working the best\nand that's when i want to push myself to\nlearn right maybe for you at the same\ntime maybe for you it's six o'clock in\nthe morning before the kids wake up\nthat's just when you have quiet time\nthat's when you\nyou decide that you like to learn and\ngrow maybe it's before you go to bed you\njust you dedicate an hour to yourself\ninstead of watching netflix you decide\nyou know what the last hour is going to\nbe dedicated towards my own growth my\nown knowledge everything that i do maybe\nyou replace netflix with learning maybe\nreplace social media\num everybody\nreplace social media with learning think\nabout what i what i want to challenge\neverybody to do is to take your phone\nand at the end of the month go through\nor end of the week when you get that\nreport that says how much time you spent\non your phone everything look back and\nsee how much time you spent on social\nmedia look back and see how much time\nyou spent on youtube and if you're using\nyoutube for for growing then that's fine\nbut think about the ways that you waste\ntime on this little device this little\nphone\nand think what would happen if i\nreplaced some of that time with learning\nwhat would happen if i replaced some of\nthat time with groin whatever would\nhappen if i replace some of that time\nwith pushing myself to be better\nthink about that\nso where can you fit it in where can you\nfit it in your day and where can you fit\nit in with stuff that you're normally\ndoing it's never that you don't have\nenough time it's just not a priority for\nyou your learning should always be a\npriority for you so that's the first\naspect of it then i want to pivot and\ntalk about what should you be learning\nright so if you think about what should\nyou be learning\nthe first question i have for you is\nwhere do you want to go\nin your life where do you want to go in\nfive years where do you want to be in 10\nyears where do you want to be in 15\nyears where do you want to be and you\nthink about that future that you want\nand the future person that you want to\nbe and then you ask yourself in order to\nget there\nin order to have the business that i\nwant or whatever the family that i want\nin order to have the relationships that\ni want the finances i want all of those\nthings in order to have those what do i\nneed to learn\nand you find out what you need to learn\nand then from there now you have a\npretty good idea of the stuff that you\nstart reading the people that you start\npulling yourself around putting yourself\naround the the knowledge that you should\nget into your head okay where do i want\nto go what do i need to know to get\nthere that's where you start and the\nimportant thing is to realize\nthat if you just learn\nfive hours a week\nthat's not much there's a lot of time i\nthink it's around 164 hours something\nlike that 168 hours that are in an\nentire week you're telling me you can't\nspend five hours\ndedicated to your learning to your\ngrowing to your becoming better you\nabsolutely can\nwe all can we could all find time where\nwe're wasting time\nyou know\nwhat if you were to just literally go\nyou know what every time i go to the\nbathroom and i decide to go number two\ni'm gonna take a book with me around xyz\nand that's what i'm gonna learn i'm sure\nyou spend you know a pretty good amount\nof time\nthere every single day 10 15 20 minutes\non the bathroom right there's some time\nright there for you netflix if you were\nto get rid of it there's some time right\nthere for your social media if you were\nto get rid of it or just at least lower\nit there's some time there for you\nthere's always time to learn and grow\nand get better and i think people know\nactually i know people know they should\nbe learning but i think people\nunderestimate the value\nof the long-term\nresults that you'll get from taking time\nand investing into yourself because\nthere is no better roi than putting time\nmoney energy attention into your own\ndevelopment\nwhatever it is that you want to learn it\nwhether it's business whether it's\nself-development whether it's you know\ncreating a better relationship with your\nspouse whether it's being a better\nparent there's always time available to\nyou so if you think that there's not any\ntime i would challenge you to find where\nthat time is it's there\nyou just haven't made it a priority yet\nbecause when you sit down and you learn\nand grow\nyears down the road you're going to\nnotice you're a completely different\nperson\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well it's all a\ngame and you're in the game you've got\nto figure out some way to play it"
