    "transcript": "one of the things that really got me\ninterested were these proteins that are\ncalled lectins and they're sometimes\ncalled sticky proteins\nand just to capture the audience gluten\nhappens to be elected and it's just one\nof multiple lectins\ngluten is actually not as evil as a lot\nof people think okay inflammation and\neverybody's you know inflammation is the\ncause of everything\nwell inflammation is caused by a leaky\ngut\ntoday i'm excited first off this is my\nearliest interview that i've ever done 7\na.m in the morning oh wow but i'm here\nwith uh dr steven gundry who is a\ncardiologist heart surgeon medical\nresearcher who's done over 10 000 heart\nsurgeries and former president of the\namerican heart association but also now\nnew york times best-selling author of\nthe plant paradox the longevity paradox\nand the newest book the energy paradox\ndr steven gundry thank you for being\nhere hey thanks for having me i'm\nexcited to dive in and talk about uh all\nthe research i've been doing on you but\nbut uh but it's good though because i\nthink that a lot of people\num i was talking yesterday with somebody\nabout people don't research their food\nenough and\nmy my nephews say that i ruin food for\nthem because every time i come over the\nhouse i'm like oh do you know this do\nyou know this i ruined ketchup for them\nbecause i talked about how much sugar\nwas in it oh yeah so i'm i'm excited to\nsit down with you and actually hear it\ndirectly from you\num but if you could kind of talk about\nwhy\nyou are writing these books now why are\nyou putting this out there coming from a\nheart surgeon what you noticed\nand what made you decide to leave that\ntask to become an author\nwell real real briefly um i was a\nprofessor and chairman of cardiothoracic\nsurgery and pediatrics at low melinda\nuniversity not far down the road from\nhere\nand very famous for operating on people\nwho\nwere too dangerous to operate on\nchildren's heart transplants\nand over 20 years ago now i met a guy\nwho changed my life who i call big ed in\nall my books and he was a big overweight\nguy from miami who was 48 years old and\nhe had inoperable coronary artery\ndisease that means he had so many\nblockages in his coronary arteries you\ncouldn't put stents in them to open them\nup you couldn't do a bypass because\nthere wasn't any place to\nland a bypass\nand people like this would go around the\ncountry looking for idiots like me to\noperate on them and were you kind of\nlike the last resort yeah exactly there\nthere are a handful of surgeons who will\njust say oh what the heck you know if\nyou want to try i'll i'm willing to try\nand he had spent six months going around\nthe country\ncarrying his angiogram his\ncatheterization you know the movie of\nhis coronary arteries around\nand everybody turned him down all the\ncenters and i was kind of six months\ninto this the last resort and i'm\nlooking at his movie and i go you know i\nreally don't like to turn people down\nbut i agree with everybody else there's\nnothing you know i can do for you he\nsays well you know wait a minute you\nknow this this film was taken six months\nago i've been on a diet i lost 45 pounds\nthis is this guy's 265 pounds when i'm\ntalking to him big ed and he says i and\ni went to a health food store and i\nbought all these supplements and i've\nbeen taking these supplements\nreligiously\nmaybe i did something in here and you\nknow i'm scratching my professor beard\nand going well you know good for you for\nlosing weight but that's not going to do\nanything in here and i know what you did\nwith all those supplements you made\nexpensive urine which i firmly believe\nand he said well look i've come all this\nway\nwhy don't we just get another angiogram\nanother cardiac catheterization\nall right\nso we did and in six months time this\nguy had cleaned out 50 of the blockages\nin his coronary arteries\ngone\nand that's not supposed to happen that's\nimpossible at least that's what i was\ntaught and\nso i'm going\nwait a minute you know how did you do\nthat and he starts describing this diet\nhe was on\nand\nwith i mean it's the serendipity is\namazing because i had this crazy special\nmajor as an undergrad at yale university\nback in the dark ages where you could\nactually design your own major\nin human evolutionary biology basically\na thesis you could take a great ape\nmanipulate its food supply manipulate\nits environment and prove you'd wind up\nwith a human being\nand i actually defended my thesis and\ngot an honors and gave it to my parents\nand went off to become a famous heart\nsurgeon\nso he starts describing this diet and i\ngo holy cow you know that's my research\nproject it's the same diet yeah it's the\nsame diet\nand\nwhy this was so\npoignant was that at that time i was 70\npounds overweight\ndespite running 30 miles a week going to\nthe gym one hour a day eating what i\nthought was incredibly healthy pretty\nmuch vegetarian diet because loma\nlinda's an is a adventist institution um\nso\nand you know i had high blood pressure i\nhad pre-diabetes i had arthritis i had\nmigraine headaches doing baby heart\ntransplants don't recommend it um\nand\ni was told it was genetic because my\nfather had much of the same stuff yeah\nso i'm i'm going\nwow so i called my parents actually who\nlived in san diego san diego i said do\nyou still have my thesis and they said\nyeah you know it's here in the shrine\nby the eternal flame yeah\nand i said send it up to me so um i\nactually started my thesis on myself but\nthis the other thing that happened is\nlet me look at those supplements\nand i said how'd you\nchoose these supplements he said well\nyou know i just that one looked\ninteresting and this one looked\ninteresting and the health food\nstore person said yeah i'll try that one\nand when i started looking at these\nsupplements i was famous for keeping\nhearts alive for 48 hours in a bucket of\nice water for heart transplant and\ni used a bunch of these particular\ncompounds\nto\nprotect them to preserve them and i was\nputting them through the arteries and\nveins of the hearts and never occurred\nto me to swallow the dumb things\nso i started swallowing a bunch of\nsupplements and i lost 50 pounds my\nfirst year\nand i lost another 20 and kept it off\nover 20 years now but the important\nthing is\ni started patients that i operated on on\nmy program\nand\nlo and behold their high blood pressure\nwent away their diabetes went away their\narthritis went away\nand after about a year of doing this uh\ni was actually going\ninto work one friday looked in the\nmirror and i said you know i've got this\nall wrong i shouldn't operate on people\nand then teach them how to eat i should\nteach them how to eat and i probably\nwon't never have to operate on them\nright now that's a really dumb career\nmaking yourself obsolete is it's like\nyeah all my colleagues said what you're\ntrying to put yourself out of business\nwhich i did unfortunately\num and you know it's a really dumb\ncareer move but that's what i did so i\nresigned my position\nliterally the height of my career and\nset up a clinic in palm springs where i\njust started a research project saying\nlook\nif you'll start eating certain foods and\navoiding certain foods and go to costco\nor trader joe's and buy some of these\nsupplements i want to draw your blood\nevery three months and you know\ninsurance will pay for it medicare will\npay for it and let's just see what\nhappens mm-hmm and\nlo and behold\nyou could you could document how it\nworked that it did work yeah who would\nhave thought yeah just just switch the\nfood that you're eating yeah just\nswitch the dumb food around so this is\nwhat i want to dive into is is what\nfoods are the ones first off that we\nshouldn't eat because i've there's\nthere's some some big surprises that\ni've found um and then obviously in the\nbook it tells the ones that we should\neat but what are some of the surprises\nthat you came across the foods that we\ndefinitely shouldn't eat as humans\nyeah and that that actually harks back\nto my research on human evolution human\nbeings\num\nare basically great apes um and we\nnever encountered never eat ate a bean\nor a grain until about ten thousand\nyears ago and 10 000 years ago is is a\nblink in human evolution\nand it's interesting when you actually\nlook at skeletons from humans back then\nuh humans were actually very tall\ncreatures the average human was about\nsix feet tall and our brain size was 15\nbigger than it actually is right now\nand then you can actually watch humans\nshrink about a foot when beans and\ngrains were introduced\nand\nour brain size shrunk and you can\nactually\nfirst document arthritis occurring in\nbones\nand so on and so forth then you go gosh\nthat's\nnot very good right so i\ni was intrigued as well why are these\nthings so mischievous and that opened up\nthis pandora's box of learning about\nplant defense systems against being\neaten right\nand\nbelieve it or not plants do not want to\nbe eaten they were not put here on earth\nfor us to eat them they were here first\nand\nthey their defense system uh is\nbiologic and biochemical warfare against\ntheir predators and\none of the things that really got me\ninterested were these proteins that are\ncalled lectins and they're sometimes\ncalled sticky proteins and just to\ncapture the audience gluten happens to\nbe a lectin and it's just one of\nmultiple lectins in fact if i was going\nto choose an evil foe as a\ngluten is actually not as evil as a lot\nof people think okay but it\nit's i'm gluten free so i want to hear\nabout that all right when we dive into\nit too okay so uh yeah in in all my\nbooks it's really what i tell you not to\neat that really makes a difference it's\nnot what i tell you to eat so\nalmost all grains have lectins they're\nprimarily in the alt outer hall and so\none of the things that's fascinating is\nwe have gotten sicker and sicker the\nmore we've introduced whole grain\ngoodness\nfor instance four billion people use\nrice as their staple\nrice was introduced cultivated eight\nthousand years ago\nfour billion people go to the trouble of\ntaking the hall off of brown rice to\nmake it white before they eat it and\nfour billion people can't be that stupid\nbecause everybody knows how much better\nbrown rice is for you than white rice\nright\nbut it's not they've taken the hall off\nthe rice\nfor years and years and years\nbread was judged by the whiteness and\nonly the poor people got the brown bread\nand\nthe upper class got the white bread\nbecause the hall was being removed and\nthe the italians i mean the idea really\na whole whole wheat pasta or whole wheat\npizza would just\nkill in italian it's like really or a\nwhole wheat croissant yeah france\nno way\nwhy would i do that and why would i ruin\nso yeah\nso people of all and\npart of my\njob is to study cultures and figure out\nwell why did they do this well you know\nwhat what prompted them i'll give you\nanother example in the nightshade family\nnightshades are primarily\namerican plants um\ntomatoes peppers eggplant potatoes are\nall from north or south or central\namerica\nand they were only introduced to the\nrest of the world both asia and europe\nby columbus and what's called colombian\ntrade\n500 years ago\nso\nall of these foods are modern to almost\nall human beings\nand even the italians refused to eat\ntomatoes for 200 years after columbus\nbrought them back\nbecause they knew how deadly they were\nright\nand most you know most italian cuisine\ntomatoes and peppers are peeled and\nde-seeded before they're used and made\ninto sauces because we don't do here at\nall which we don't hear yeah my mother\nmy my grandmother on my mother's side\nwas french and she taught my mother you\nalways have to peel and de-seed tomatoes\nso growing up\ni actually had sliced tomatoes with no\nseeds or peel on them and when i went\naway to yale i actually had a sliced\ntomato with a peel and seed and i\nthought this was the weirdest thing i've\never seen why you know why why would you\neat these things yeah hey i don't know\nabout you but i love the feeling of\nlearning something new and that's what i\nfeel like every time i watch or listen\nto the great courses plus this is a\nstreaming service that you gotta have\nit's a

is\nathleticgreens.com\ndial so grains\nuh we've got grains in there we've got\nbeans um\nbut we've there's some ways around\ncertain things so\nuh first off with the beans you say we\ncan do it in a only in a pressure cooker\nyou can have it but they are lethal\nif they're taken in the wrong doses i\nheard you tell stories about this so\nyeah there's actually very good\ndocumentations particularly the most\nfamous one happened in boston on a\nhealthy eating dead school day\nwhere\nfaculty and kids in a school were were\nserved under cooked beans\nand\ni think 23 of them were admitted to the\nhospital with uh severe quote food\npoisoning and it was actually the\nlectins and undercooked beans yeah they\nwere they were uh kidney beans i think\nyou said yeah kidney means kidneys are\nby far the worst they have the highest\nlectin content but even the humble\nlentil\nseven percent of all the proteins in a\nlentil\nare lectins\nso it's they're they're armed and\ndangerous yeah\nwhen you look at traditional cultures\nthat use\nbeans for instance much of india and\nmuch of brazil\nwhich\nboth use a lot of legumes\npressure cooking is standard in in how\nyou prepare these things what's the\nreason why pressure cooking is the it\nworks and none of the other ones do so\nyou have to have high pressure and high\nheat to break lectins the only\nlectin that's resistant to that is\nactually gluten and gluten is is such a\ntough protein that even high pressure\nand high heat can't do it well i learned\nsubsequently that um\nthe adventists\nlive uh on a mystery meat that's made\nout of texturized vegetable protein tvp\neverything's made out of tvp and it\nturns out tbp\nis made from\ndefatted ground up soybean that is\nextruded under high pressure and high\nheat\nso the clever adventists had figured out\na way to detoxify soy\nit's like how did they knew all of this\nstuff and we just lost this knowledge we\nlost the knowledge of the beans we lost\nthe knowledge of of the uh the tomatoes\nis it just because we got lazy or we\njust wanted to get it done quicker yeah\ni think all of the above i mean the\nincas uh\nclearly ate a quinoa you know that\nhealthy pseudograin but the incas\nwouldn't eat quinoa raw they wouldn't\ncook it they actually fermented it first\nand they let it rot and then they cooked\nit and ate it and fermentation is\nactually a very good way of\neating lectins now in fact many bean\neating cultures\nsoak their beans for multiple hours\nmultiple days they changed the water and\nit turns out that you can actually\nferment the surface of beans by doing\nthat and break down the lectins wow so\nyeah so it's really fun watching how\ncultures have figured this out yeah and\nhow we just lost it one thing i'm really\ncurious about is the gluten because\ni'll tell you the the journey my\ngirlfriend i've been on so we uh my\ngirlfriend was having eczema for like\nreal bad eczema and i definitely want to\nhear you talk about skin and that's\nsuper interesting to me she was having\nreal bad eczema though and um\nshe she you know did a whole bunch of\nresearch didn't want to take any pills\nany of that type of stuff so then she\nshe started researching the the no-fod\ndiet she went on that for a while and\nnoticed it started going away i was like\nif you'll go i'll go gluten-free with\nyou because i've noticed some you know\nsoreness in my back that type of stuff\nand i was like maybe it'll help with\ninflammation\num\nher eczema went away she hasn't had in\nprobably three years i would say um her\neczema went away\nand uh and so we've just been\ngluten-free since and the more that we\ndo research on it and the way that it\nyou know breaks through the the lining\nof your gut and go into your blood so\nfor people that are out there that think\ngluten-free is crazy um because people\nare always like oh but it tastes so much\nbetter if you can have you know just\nbread um what is what is the the the\nreason why gluten does that and then why\nis the skin so important to notice when\nthere's problems inside of your gut\nso it will we'll almost start backwards\nso the lining of your gut is literally\nyour skin turned inside out from the\nfrom your mouth down to your rear end\nand the surface of the lining of your\ngut is actually the same surface as a\ntennis court inside of you and everybody\nlooks down and go wait a minute\ncome on there's no tennis court in there\nand it's only one cell thick yeah it's\nif you will a design flaw you know i\nmean i can tell you why it's one cell\nthick but it's one cell thick\nand those cells are all held together um\nyou're probably old enough to remember\nred rover red rover yeah\nit's not allowed in schools anymore it's\nreally it's too dangerous yeah of course\nyeah of course uh so we all locked arms\nand you know two rows of kids so one\nstraight at him yeah right at him and\nall there was always the big guy with\nhis knee up and the girls would scream\nit was great fun um\nso these these cells are all locked\nliterally arm and arm and they're called\ntight junctions\nand\nhippocrates 2500 years ago you're the\nfather of medicine said all disease\nbegins in the gut crazy yeah yeah and he\nknew he didn't have any of our\ntests you know the guy just knew and\nhe's actually right\nso thanks to work by a professor who's\nnow at harvard dr fasano\ndr fasano\ntried to figure out how\ngluten was his interest\ncaused celiac disease the extreme form\nof gluten intolerance and caused leaky\ngut\nand he discovered that\ngluten being a lectin if it could get to\nthe surface of our intestines could\nattach\nand\nmake a compound\nthat would um\nit's called zonulin and it would attach\nto another receptor and it would\nactually break the tight junction it\nwould\nmake the arms go apart\nand there would be a gap between these\ncells and if there was a gap\nthen foreign proteins like lectins could\nleak through this gap\npieces of bacteria or living bacteria\ncould get through this gap and on the\nother side of our intestines 80\nof all of our white blood cells all of\nour immune system line the lining of our\ngut\nbecause\nthat's where a potential you know attack\ncould come across the wall of our border\nif you will\nand so\nthese guys attacking these foreign\nproteins created inflammation and\neverybody's you know inflammation is the\ncause of everything\nwell inflammation is caused by a leaky\ngut\nand so\none of the things in my research is that\nwhat happens is that these\nforeign proteins\nplants are so clever uh it's\nit's mind-boggling plants we identify\nforeign proteins by literally reading a\nbarcode of that protein and all of our\nimmune cells literally have barcode\nscanners that read a protein and say do\ni know this protein uh is it a good guy\nor is it on the no-fly zone right\nand\nplants make these proteins lectins\nresemble human proteins oh my god and so\nour immune system gets all revved up and\nthey're sent out almost like with wanted\nposters at the post office if you see\nthis protein you kill it and you shoot\nit down\nand plants have figured out that\nit's close enough to a human protein\nthat because our immune system is so\nwildly\nturned on that it will\nshoot to kill a protein that almost\nlooks like what it's looking at and so\nyou your girlfriend's eczema was your\nimmune system shooting at proteins in\nher skin that looked like lectins in in\nher case gluten\nand let me use the best example\nwhen i\n95\nof us are born\nwith an antibody to the peanut lectin\npeanuts or beans they're not nuts at all\nso 95 of us carry an antibody and\neverybody now knows antibodies because\nof covet right so that's how our immune\nsystem recognizes a foreign protein\nand yet when i was growing up\nnobody had a peanut allergy kids were\nbringing peanuts to school peanut butter\nand jelly sandwiches and nobody was\ncarrying epipens to school right\nnow of course we have\nmassive amounts of peanut allergy yes my\nnephew has peanut allergy yeah and you\ngo well wait a minute you know 50 years\nago nobody had a peanut allergy what\nhappened\nwell back in the good old days our\ngut microbiome the bugs in our gut uh\nliterally taught our immune system hey\nyou know yeah i know you guys are\nlooking for this guy but just cool it\nnobody had leaky gut for the most part\nso our immune system wasn't\nhyperactivated but now thanks to\ntons of antibiotics thanks to whole\ngrain goodness\nwe all have leaky gut and so our immune\nsystem is hyper on alert and now they\nsee this kind of innocent peanut lecter\nand they go oh my gosh you know i've got\nan antibody to that i'm gonna i'm gonna\nshoot it down well yeah and so is\nglyphosate a part of that as well oh\nyeah\nthat's the other thing um i was on a\npodcast with a millennial recently\nand millennials are often described as\nthe first lazy generation\nand um\nit's interesting that millennials are\nactually the first generation that has\nbeen totally exposed from day one to\nglyphosate in our food\nnever been without it and glyphosate's\nin roundup and\nthe interesting thing about glyphosate\nis it's really good at destroying our\ngut microbiome it's um\nit was patented by monsanto yeah not as\na wheat killer but as an antibiotic yeah\nyou wanna hear something crazy around\nthat my grandfather\nuh worked for monsanto\nin\nit would have been i guess the 60s\nand\ndeveloped a\nnot to go too deep into it but develop\nstomach cancer\nfrom working at monsanto\nstory short\nwas in so much pain became an alcoholic\nended up killing himself\nbut\ninterestingly enough in killing yourself\nyou're not supposed to get any insurance\nmoney monsanto paid the insurance money\nto keep him quiet interesting yeah so\nthat's that this tells you a little bit\nabout what was going on being in the in\nthe 60s in those uh\nyou know in the inside the uh what yeah\nit's making sense you know there's\nthere's numerous books written about\nwhat they knew and when they knew it\nright\nand\num it's\nthey knew\nthat it\nkilled bacteria\nbecause bacteria use what's called the\nshikamate pathway i love that word\nchickamay\nit sounds like a great swear word but\nthe shikamate pathway is how plants\nlive\nproduce energy if you will and bacteria\nuse the shikamate pathway as well\nhumans don't use the shikimate pathway\nand so monsanto said don't worry you\nknow\nyou can you know eat glyphosate by the\nbucket full and it won't kill you\nbecause you don't use the shikamite\npathway what they didn't say is oh by\nthe way it's going to kill all your\nbacteria and your gut microbiome and now\nthere's recent evidence that glyphosate\nin and of itself causes leaky gut\nwithout having any effect on the gut\nmicrobiome hey you're the hiring expert\nfor your company and what you really\nneed is help making

lot about the gut\nand you always say that all disease\nstarts in the gut and\nbefore we started doing research my\ngirlfriend i never heard anything about\nthe gut except for like go with your gut\nfeeling that was it right but you have\nsome extremely interesting stuff about\nwhy it's so important how it actually\nchanges the way that you feel the way\nthat you think and everything about you\nso yeah\ntell us about the gut and all of all of\nthe goodness that you have for that\nwell so we used to women uh understand\ngut feeling much better than men or\ntrust your gut\nand now\nwe've known for a number of years that\nthere are nerves that go\nbetween the gut and the brain and\nlikewise\nrecent research shows that\nfor every\nfiber nerve fiber coming down from the\nbrain to the gut there are actually nine\nnerve nerve fibers going from the gut up\nto the brain so far more information is\nactually going up rather than down\nthen there were\nthere were a bunch of neuro hormones\nthat were discovered that seemed to be\ncoming from the gut and we presumed that\nthere were\ntissues neurons that were making this in\nthe gut and then the most recent advance\nis no no no all these compounds like\nserotonin for instance that makes you\nfeel good we're actually being\nmanufactured by the gut microbiome\nthemselves\nisn't the majority of your serotonin\nactually manufacturing yet yeah it's all\nit's all coming from the gut it's all\nmostly coming from your gut microbiome\nand then as i talk about in the energy\nparadox the the new exciting research is\nthat there's a whole class of\ncompounds that are called\npostbiotics\nwhich is\na literal language between the gut\nmicrobiome\nand our energy producing organelles the\nmitochondria and our brain\nthat literally\ntells you if you will how to feel how\nmuch energy to make\num give you an example you just\nyesterday i i saw a woman who\nhad some pretty awful um autoimmune\ndisease called crohn's disease which is\nleaky gut at its finest and\nshe had been\nto multiple physicians had been placed\non multiple medications was miserable\nand she was profoundly depressed\n[Music]\nand\nuh we got her off of all of her\nmedications and she came to see me she's\n50 now\nand we were talking yesterday literally\nand she says you know\nthe biggest thing that has happened to\nme that just blows my mind and blows my\npsychiatrist mind is i am no longer\ndepressed she says i am so happy\nand she said i fired my psychiatrist i\nyou know i don't need him i don't need\nthe pills and it was all because of you\nknow you and teaching me how to get my\ngut working again\nand so she doesn't have crohn's and\nshe's not depressed and it's like\nwow you know it\nyou don't need any of these medications\nyou just have to\navoid a few foods yeah\nso so tell me about because the thing\nthat's really interesting about and\npeople don't realize\nhow important it is is i've heard you\ntalk about the fecal transplants to go\nfrom from one person to another that\nmight be pretty talk about rats doing or\nyou take it to depress fecal matter and\nput it into a normal rat i've heard you\ntalk about someone who's extremely\nhealthy and getting fecal transplant\nfrom someone who's not healthy so yeah\nand and how it actually changes their\nbody physically by having a fecal\ntransplant\nyeah the most the most famous human\nstory was a\nfemale marathon runner in england\nwho um because of\nsome antibiotic overdose if you will\ndeveloped a really a life-threatening\ninfection called c difficile and a lot\nof people have heard about it\nand c difficile primarily we now treat\nit if it's severe with a fecal\ntransplant from\na healthy donor and\nas i talk about in other books\nwe share a lot of our microbiome with\nfamily members um the closer you are\nto a family member or the living in a\nhouse you share a lot of your microbiome\nyeah and friends share microbiomes and\nwe've talked about that um in in other\nbooks\nso anyhow they took they found a niece\nof this woman\nwho was was a good match and except she\nwas 30 pounds overweight\nand so\ngot the fecal transplant from the\noverweight niece and went back she was\ncured went back to life went back to\nrunning\nbut over the course of the next year she\ngained 30 pounds crazy she didn't change\nthe way she ate she didn't change her\nactivity it was just that she had been\ngiven a new set of bacteria that changed\nhow\nexcuse me\nshe harvested food and actually made her\nactually eat more for that bunch of\nbacteria wow there's a new paper out\nthis morning\non the same sort of subject\nyou can\nyou can breed mice\nto be develop high blood pressure\nand you can\nfeed mice\nwith a\nhigh blood pressure inducing diet that\nmakes bacteria that make you have high\nblood pressure\nbut they found that\nintermittent fasting time restricted\neating which is actually a big part of\nthis new book the energy paradox if they\nput high blood pressure mice on\ntime restricted eating intermittent\nfasting\nthen they would\nbecome normal intensive they their blood\npressure would go back to normal\nand they go gee i mean just\nthey didn't change the amount of food\njust the timing of food and they went\nwow how come that's happening\nlo and behold changing the timing of the\nfood in these mice\nchanged their microbiome from a\nmicrobiome that induced high blood\npressure to a microbiome that cured high\nblood pressure wow yeah it's crazy yeah\nit's crazy so and i see this again i\nstarted seeing this years ago it's like\nwait a minute these people had high\nblood pressure and\nthey don't have high blood pressure\nanymore\nwhat happened\nit was really funny early on people\nwould call and say you know i'm pretty\ndizzy\nuh you know what supplement are you\ngiving me that's making me dizzy and my\nnurse and i would look at each other and\nno this isn't\nthere's nothing in there so i'm making\nyou dizzy and we'd have them come into\nthe clinic and sure enough their blood\npressure was pretty low so we'd cut\ntheir blood pressure pill in half and\nsay okay you know that'll take care of\nit and then they call a few weeks later\nand say boy i'm really dizzy again you\nknow well come on in here and their\nblood pressure\nwell shoot let's just you know throw\nthese blood pressure pills away and\nthat's kind of like how all this starts\nlike wow food has that much power yeah\nfor sure and so what does it have to do\nwith with\nbecause i'm super interested how you can\ntake\nfecal matter from somebody and put into\nsomeone else and change but you've also\nthere's also been studies on rats that\nwere considered i guess depressed rats\nin the way that they act the way that\nthey were and taking their fecal matter\nand putting into a normal rat and it\nchanges correct the normal rat\nthat had normal energy and everything as\nwell yeah the rant becomes anxious won't\nyou know go looking for food\nwe now know that these\nas much as we hate to admit it these\nlittle single cell organisms\nhave profound effect on\nreally our entire functioning they're in\ncharge\nthey are literally in charge um\ni always like to say this and my my\nstaff hates me to say it uh jacqueline\nlane who i think is really the godfather\nof fitness\nwho lived in 96.\nuh jacqueline\nmost people know him from the jacqueline\njuicer but jacqueline always had an\nexpression\nthat if it tastes good spit it out\nand\nmy staff said no don't say that you know\nyou you have good tasting food but\nhe wasn't really saying\nthat what he was saying is you really\nshould be eating\nfor your microbiome and he didn't even\nknow about the microbiome back then but\nyou should be eating for them\nand if you eat for them they'll take\ncare of you and that's\nmy research in longevity shows that\nother people research and longevity\nshows that\nthe more we take care of our microbiome\nthe more we give what i call the gut\nbuddies\nwhat they need to eat what they want to\neat they they make these compounds\ncalled postbiotics\nthat control everything that's going to\nhappen to us even control our lifespan\nwhich is i mean really\nfun and exciting\nyeah\nand\nwhat's interesting about it are you\nfamiliar with uh have you ever heard of\num\n[Music]\ni'm trying to remember his name\num anyways i can't remember what it is\nhe wrote the biology of belief but oh\nyeah\nuh i want to say greg braden but greg\nbrains is friend uh but anyways uh bruce\nlipton yeah bruce and bruce lipton says\nwhen you look at yourself in the mirror\nyou're not like when i see myself i'm\nnot saying rob i'm seeing a collection\nof 70 trillion cells\nand i've heard you talk about that\nliterally majority of us in our genes\nare not actually human genes at all\ncorrect or human cells or yeah about\n90 90 of all the cells that make us\nup are non-human\nbut the fascinating thing is that 99\nof all the genomic material in us genes\nare non-human genes so each other yeah\nwe're yeah we're nothing i mean we have\none percent say in all of this\nand you know that's\nin a way scary but the really exciting\nthing is\nwith with every year we learn you know\nwhat these guys want\nwhy\nwe want to give them what they want\nand\nif we do that then you know all these\nall these things that we assume are part\nof getting older\ngo away\num there was a nature study\nthat um i published uh i cited in the\nlongevity paradox\nuh in 2018 so a fairly recent study that\nlooked at the influence of genes and\nour microbiome on\nour fate and it turns out that human\ngenes\nhave only\na eight percent maximum influence on\nwhat's going to happen to us and so\nyou know 92\nof what's going to happen to us is\nactually non-genetic\nand\nyou can you know you can literally\npretty much\nwipe out any of that genetic\ndeterminant by\nchoosing what to eat yeah and choosing\nthe environment it's the environment\nthat's created that's another thing that\nbruce lipton talks about is that you\nknow he was he was seen as crazy in the\n70s because he was saying it's not the\ngenes that matter when everyone's saying\nthe genes matter he's he's saying it's\nthe environment because you can take a\nhuman cell and make an ear you can take\na human saw make a nose or something\ncompletely different and what he says\nit's the environment that that actually\nmatters more than the genes that matter\nright yeah yeah epigenetics is really\nwhat happens i mean for instance i mean\nwe we have fewer genes\nthan a corn plant\nthere's fewer genes\nand\nwe hopefully are a little more complex\nthan corn plant we have actually we and\nso everybody says well then we have the\nthe most genes of any animal and it\nturns out that's not even true the sand\nflea has more jeans than we do so next\ntime you're walking on the beach and one\nof those little guys yeah yeah so far\nmore jeans than we have well so yeah i\nthink we're like the most advanced and\nthe biggest but we're not even close\nyeah they're not even close yeah\num\nso so talk to me about\nabout meat because one thing i really\nactually i was when i was researching\nyesterday i was watching you talk about\norganic free-range chicken\nand um\ni text my girlfriend literally took a\nvideo of it sent the video to my\ngirlfriend text it to her because she's\ngot a soy allergy\nand we don't eat a whole lot of meat we\neat a little bit of meat but when we get\nit we try to get what we thought was the\nhealthiest and people listening to\npodcasts can't see my my fingers do the\nquotations right but when you talk about\norganic free-range chicken you're\ntalking about they're given soybeans\nthat was the first thing pots my head\naround like oh my gosh she's ingesting\norganic free inch chicken that are\nhaving soybeans she has pretty bad\nallergies eczema's gone but the\nallergies are still there i was like it\nactually might be from that\nbut talk to me about\nabout that the the meat industry but\nalso the organic free-range chicken\nbecause for me that was super eye\nopening and i got to go back to austin\nand research who has you know the better\nmeat in the area well you got to look at\nmy podcast on the dr gundry podcast\nwhere we had farmer dan from texas yes\nwho is now excuse me raising\nlectin-free chickens wow and he set\nabout to feed his\nuh pastured chickens um\nlectin-free food and\nhe's uh it's fabulous i can tell you so\nyou live right around the corner from\nfarming do you know where in texas he is\ni've i've\nforgotten the name but uh\nbig state yeah yeah it's a big state but\nyeah but and now his whole business is\nlectin free chickens\num anyhow so\nyou are what you eat but you are what\nthe thing you're eating ate\nand what really\nsurprised me and maybe it shouldn't have\nis years ago\nwell in 2007\nthe congress passed a law determining\nwhat an organic free-range chicken is\nand you can label a chicken organic free\nrange as you can keep it in a warehouse\nfor its entire life with a hundred\nthousand other chickens\nas long as you open a door to the\noutside that has a three yard by three\nyard patch of grass\none yard by three yards one door nine\nfeet by nine feet right and it literally\nis a hundred thousand chickens hundred\nthousand chickens you can have a hundred\nthousand chickens wow\nand as long as you open that door for\nfive minutes every 24 hours\nand the chickens have the potential to\ngo outside they don't have to leave wow\nthen you can legally label them organic\nfree range crazy\nnow it gets even better\nif the\nmost of these chickens are fed organic\ncorn and organic soybeans that's\nprimarily what's in chicken feed\nif the price of organic\nexceeds\nconventional\ncorn and soybeans double in by double in\nprice\nyou can legally feed them\nconventional corn and soybeans and still\nlabel it organic because you meant well\nbecause you meant well correct oh that's\nnice yes and\nit's technically illegal to\ngive antibiotics to chickens anymore but\nthere's a loophole of course there is if\nthe veterinarian who is employed by the\nmajor food corporation\non site\nbelieves\nthat there is a sick chicken in that 100\n000 flock of chickens\nthen you can dose the entire flock\nrather than wading through the hundred\nthousand chickens to find the sick\nchicken and it's perfectly legal to give\nthem\nantibiotics and\nso\nso getting back to your question so you\nare what you eat but you are with the\nthing you're eating ate\ni had a woman here from la who's\nactually a psychiatrist\nwho had horrible lupus um you know skin\nrashes the whole bit\nand on double drug therapy she was\nmiserable\nlong story short we got her off of all\nher drugs her\nher skin rashes cleared up\nand she was in the office one day and\nshe said you know i'm really happy i'm\noff on all my drugs the rashes are gone\nbut i've got this little bit of eczema\non the top of my\neyelids right where my eyelashes are she\nsaid that's that's all i've got\nand she said where do you think that's\nfrom so we're going through you know\nwhat she's eating and she got to organic\nfree-range chicken\nand i said\nso not pastured chicken and she said no\norganic free range and i said well\nthey're being fed corn and soybeans i\nsaid tell you what\nand she said well i eat a lot of it and\ni said tell you what let's just\neliminate that just stop eating that\ncall me back change nothing else but\nthat nothing else but let's just\nlook at one thing a month later she\ncalled she said yeah that was it\neczema's gone it was the organic\nfree-range chicken wow\nand i went wow and i said well of course\nit makes so much sense because these\nproteins which are foreign proteins\nare incorporated into the flesh of these\nanimals and\nif you have a sensitivity to soy or corn\nand i can tell you huge\ni can tell you that in my practice\nuh 70 percent of people who are\nsensitive to gluten\nuh react\nto corn in the exact same way uh 70\nreally and that's one of the reasons why\ngluten-free diets as they're construed\nnow\nin general don't work for celiac disease\n70 of people celiac which is the extreme\nform of gluten intolerance still have\nceliac by biopsy a year and a half later\nof being on a gluten-free diet because\nmost of the foods that are gluten-free\nare\nfull of lectins for instance corn or\nquinoa or buckwheat and that's what\nthey're eating wow\nso just to go back because i want to i\nwant to talk about i just want to for\nanyone who happened to miss it and if\nyou were to put all that together an\norganic free-range chicken can be inside\nof a warehouse with a hundred thousand\nother ones they have a opportunity to\nleave for five minutes they don't even\nactually ever have to leave they're\ngiven corn which we can talk about as\nwell i've heard you say was outlawed in\nfrance\nat one point in time\nsoybeans which uh you know many people\nare there to soy as well\nthey're not supposed to have oh and if\nthe price of organic\nsoybeans and corn happens to be price\ntwice the price of conventional which i\nhate the word convention i think they\nshould call it gmo like and then they\nshould switch the name of it so it\nshould be corn plus all that\nconventional\ncorn and soybeans has been sprayed with\nroundup oh perfect which is glyphosate\nand they have all that so so if the\nprice is is double they can give them\nnone\nor you know non-organic butcher they\ncall conventional uh\nbecause they meant well and if they\nthink that there happens to be one sick\nchicken and a hundred thousand they can\ngive all of them antibiotics which we\nall know antibiotics make them you know\nfat and huge and grow faster correct\noh my god\nokay so yeah and that was actually\npassing the law in 2007 it was\nintroduced by\na congressman from georgia from a\nchicken farming of course what a\nsurprise\nwow so\num\ni'm trying to process all that the fact\nthat that's possible so when when you\nsay pasture raisin you mentioned that\nwith the ladies so is pasture raise okay\nso you gotta know your farmers are other\nloopholes you've got to know your farmer\nuh and i'll tell you an interesting\nstory about that\num we have uh a big fan of\nour program who\nreally changed her life around\ngot rid of some really awful arthritis\nissues young woman\nand then\nshe\nunbeknownst to any of us she's not a\npatient and but she's a big fan and i\ntalked to her\nunbeknownst to us she went on a um\nwell i'll just say it a carnivore diet\nand the more\ncarnivore diet she did the\nmore sick she got her arthritis came\nback her migraines came back\nand she was getting\ngrass-fed beef and pasture poultry from\nthis farmer\nand so she said you know i'm doing\neverything right it's grass-fed it's\npastured poultry\nand we did\na bun she she finally\nshe was posting that you know my diet\nhad failed her blah blah blah and so\nwe reached out to her and\nlearned that she actually wasn't\nfollowing my program and said\nwell this is interesting so let us you\nknow let us do a lot of you know blood\ntests on you look at leaky gut look at\nwhat you're sensitive to\nand come to find out she's got wide open\nleaky gut again\nand she's sensitive to\ncorn and\num\nso i said\nyou need to talk to your farmer\nand i said farmers\neven if they're pastured will supplement\ntheir food\nwith you know a feed and you need to\nfind out what's in this feed\nand so she did and she actually\ncalled me back she says oh my gosh my\nfarmer was killing me\nshe he was feeding his chickens corn and\nsoybeans and other grains he was feeding\nhis cows corn and soybeans even though\nthey were on pasture yeah and\ni said okay well you know that's good\nnews stop eating this stuff call me back\nand she called me back in three days she\nsaid\nyou're not gonna believe this but\nmy pain is 70 less than it was three\ndays ago well just she she said my\nfarmer was killing me and i trusted him\nyeah\nthat's crazy so how do how do do\nallergies have a big part of this as\nwell what how people's allergies react\nto that so\nso allergies um\nso we used to do food\nallergy testing in our office and i was\nnever impressed because allergies work\non\nan immunoglobulin system called ige\nand\nwhen we finally switched over to looking\nat food sensitivities by using igg and\niga and we won't go into the\ntechnicalities\nand started believing those results it\nmade all the difference in the world and\ni recently had a stanford stanford\nprofessor on the dr general podcast\ntalking about her book the end of\nallergies\nand she and i both uh agree\nthat\nallergies and food sensitivities can be\ncompletely eliminated\nby knowing what you're sensitive to\nfinding out how\nleaky your gut is and then\nstopping uh\nthat leaky gut and your immune system\nliterally\nrelearns um a year ago i gave a paper\npre right as covet hit at the american\nheart association a lifestyle and\nepidemiology meeting\nwhere we took\n10 people\nwith um\nsevere leaky gut they actually all had\nceliac disease put them on our program\nfor a year\nand looked at all their food\nsensitivities including to gluten\nand at the end of the year\nnine out of ten of them uh all of them\nsealed their leaky gut\nnine out of ten of them had actually\nlost all\nmemory all immunoglobulin memory that\nthey didn't like gluten\nyeah completely gone\nnow\ndoes that mean we can reintroduce gluten\ni don't know uh i don't want to make\nthat leap of faith but when we look at\nfood sensitivities and once the leaky\ngut is uh sealed then we can reintroduce\nthings i\nhave a gentleman here in la who\ndeveloped a severe autoimmune disease\nsevere pain\nfrom his leaky gut\nwe pretty much got his leaky gut sealed\nnow\ngot him off of all of his mischievous\ncompounds and\ninitially he was sensitive to both egg\nwhite and egg yolk and we took those\naway\nwe retested him about nine months into\nit because he loves omelets and he was\nstill sensitive to egg yolk but he was\nno longer sensitive to egg white so we\nintroduced egg white omelets which made\nhim a happy guy\nand i just talked to him on the phone a\ncouple weeks ago and he says i got to be\nhonest with you i've\nreintroduced duck eggs including the\nyolk and i'm not reacting so and he says\ni'm a happy guy\nthat's awesome yeah so i used to have\nhorrible allergies as a kid and in\ncollege and i got allergy shots\nand i had hay fever and the whole bit i\ndon't have any allergies anymore so\nincredible yeah so i've retrained\ni've told my immune system to stand down\ni've told my my gut microbiome has\neducated my immune system and said hey\nwe got your back you know go\ngo have a doughnut and a cigarette and\nyou know just relax\ni'm sure that's what you're doing on\nyour days off donuts and cigarettes um\ntell me about your your new book i know\nwe're short on time but tell me about\nyour new book the energy paradox because\nuh that just came out uh last month yeah\nyeah last month um so i i really had no\nintention of writing the energy paradox\nbut i was\ni was driving into la actually orange\ncounty to do a pbs fundraising\nsegment\nand\ni got a call on the phone saying that\nthe person who was going to do the\nsegment with me wasn't going to come in\ntoday\num because she just didn't have it in\nher um and this was a millennial yeah\nand i'm going\nwell what are we going to do they say\nwell that's all right you know we'll\nsomebody else will take her place and\nblah blah blah and we got through it but\nthat kept resonating with me for several\ndays it's like\nhow can a millennial not have it in them\nyou know to come into the studio\nand so i i realized that when i first\nstarted my new practice in restorative\nmedicine that well over 50 percent of\nthe diagnoses codes that we use\nthe icd-9 code was fatigue and malaise\nand\nlooking back i realized oh my gosh you\nknow\nall these people presented with being\ntired with being you know exhausted and\ni part and parcel that all went away\nso i said geez you know i've been an\nenergy doctor for the last 20 years and\ni should find out\nwhy this program has been so effective\nin restoring people's energy so the book\nholds people by the hand takes shows\nthem some nerdy stuff about how energy\nis made\nbut then\nshows people how to get their energy\nback the the other thing that's striking\nis\nbrain fog in this country is just\nrampant for sure and\nyou know it was it's one thing to say\nwell you're 80 years old and you don't\nremember things you used to but again\nwhen a millennial\ncan't remember can't you know leaves\ntheir keys someplace you go\nwhat the you know\nthat can't be good\nand it can't be good and we're seeing\nthis huge amount of what i call\nneuroinflammation\nwhich if you have a leaky gut i can\npretty much guarantee you you have a\nleaky brain\nand we can actually measure that we can\nmeasure neural inflammation and it's no\nwonder that our brains don't work well\nthere's there's a war going on inside of\nour brain as well wow and we have an\nentire set of immune cells in our brain\nthat basically are our neurons body\nguards if you will um\nand these guys actually if they suspect\nthat mischief is a foot down in the gut\nthey literally\nform\ncircles around neurons and cut off their\ncommunication to each other to literally\nprotect them wow yeah and so we can\nactually measure this now and we go whoa\nno wonder you you know your brain\ndoesn't work right and the really\nexciting thing is\nyou can measure that coming back you can\nwatch the neural inflammation going away\nwell that's incredible man i feel like\nwe could go for another few hours i have\nso many so many questions i'll have to\nhave you back at some point yeah so um\nbefore i ask you last question how can\npeople find you um books and also on the\ninternet as well in podcast world yeah\nso the dr gundry podcast wherever you\nget your podcast um\nthe\ndrgundry.com\nyou can find me gundrymd.com\nis my supplement of food company\ngot two youtube channels instagram\nif\nif you can't find me i'm doing something\nwrong how's that the books everywhere\nbooks are sold um you know amazon barnes\nand noble please please please\ngo to your local bookseller\nit's a best-selling book they'll have it\num\nthe book sellers your local stores have\nbeen devastated by covid and we need to\ngive them\nall the help we can give for sure so\nlast question i have for you a little\nbit of a shift but you went from you\nknow heart surgeon\nyou know working in the actual surgeries\nthemselves to now educating people\nmaking yourself obsolete but obviously\nbuilding a career doing it you know they\nsay that that there's two times when you\ndie the first ones when you stop\nbreathing the second time is the last\ntime someone says your name\nso in between that time what do you\nthink people what do you hope that\npeople think and say about you between\nthe the first death and the the last\ndeath\num well i i guess\ni think the most important thing i can\ntell people is and i tell them this in\ntheir own health it is never too late\nit's never too late to make a difference\nuh it's never too late to make a change\nin a mission or career choice i mean\nnever and the other thing i would tell\nanyone\nis never retire\num\nretirement is unless you use your\nretirement\nfor a new um\ninterest and and pour yourself into that\nin my patient population retirement uh\nis a death spiral it literally starts a\ndeath spiral\nand\nnever ever retire i'm now in my 70s i\nwork seven days a week\nand literally six days a week seeing\npatients one day a week at country md\nwow\nand\nnever ever retire but you seem like you\nlove it and i got more energy than i\never have\ndr stephen gundry i appreciate you being\nhere hey thanks for having me appreciate\nit thanks hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you love this\nvideo i've got another one you're gonna\nlove just click right here and watch it"
