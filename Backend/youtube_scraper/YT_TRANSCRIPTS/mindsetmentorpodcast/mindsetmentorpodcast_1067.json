    "transcript": "the universe just gives me gifts it's\nlike the gold coin just start falling\nfrom the sky\ntoday we're gonna be talking about the\nstandards that you hold yourself to and\nhow your standards creates your entire\nlife and this is super important because\ni think that habits are very important\ni'll say this before i before i talk\nabout habits they're important but\nthey're not the most important thing\npeople don't talk enough about the\nstandards that people hold themselves to\nand if you can understand this and you\ncan hold yourself accountable to the\nlevel that you really want to hold\nyourself accountable in the level that\nyou need to be in order to create the\nlife that you want you will create that\nlife\nhabits are important but habits are the\nchildren of standards standards are way\nmore important and so\nif you can learn to hold yourself to a\nhigher standard then you'll have to\nforce yourself to grow and if you grow\nyou'll create an amazing life and in\nthis episode i'm going to give you tips\non exactly how to do so but first off\nlet's get really clear on what a\nstandard is because sometimes people\nlike to ask that standards in the\nsimplest form the way i like to explain\nit are what you deem acceptable and\nfully unacceptable in your life and\nthese are levels that you will not let\nyourself drop below at all ever you\nwon't let yourself drop below the\nstandard and your standards are attached\nto your identity in what you think about\nyourself right so you know when you look\nat your body there's a pretty good\nchance that for most people listening\nyour body has been\nvery similar for the past two three four\nfive ten years for some of you even\nlonger right that's because that's the\nstandard that you're holding yourself to\nyou won't let yourself go any lower but\nyou're probably also not going any\nfurther in getting any better in a lot\nof cases you might be in some cases but\nthis is the reason why people can lose a\nbunch of weight and then they can go\nright back to gaining all the weight\nback just standards that they have\nif you look at your bank account you\nprobably have around the same amount\nthat you have for years right tends to\nbe very common if you seeing five\nthousand dollars in your bank account\nyou've probably had around five thousand\ndollars in your bank account for years\nand years why because it's simply just a\nstandard and if some big bill comes in\nand you have to pay that bill and let's\nsay your bank account goes from 5 000 to\n4 000 well the standard is that you're\nused to seeing 5 000 so that's when\nyou'll you'll buckle up you won't go out\nto each you won't see your friends you\nwon't go to the movies you won't spend\nany extra money until you feel safe and\nat that same part the same place that\nyou're normally at right so your life\nwhere it currently is is because of your\nstandards how you look how your body\nlooks where your business is at where\nyour bank account is at where your\nfriendships is at where friendships are\nat where your relationships are at where\nyour\nmarriage is at where your relationship\nwith your kids is at\nthe cleanliness of your house everything\ncomes down to the standards that you\nhold yourself to and a standard is\nsomething that you will not drop below\nbut\nthe thing about that is that's basically\nlike the ground floor\nwhich means there's always levels above\nit and those levels above it in order\nfor you to go from ground floor to the\nnext floor you're gonna have to raise\nyour standards in some way so i'll give\nyou a quick example\nif we're talking about not falling below\nany standards let's go really drastic\ni'm assuming that most people listening\nto this podcast right now you're\nprobably not going to get done listening\nto this podcast and then go shoot up\nsome black tar heroine right why\ni would assume that for most people\nlistening to a motivational podcast and\na mindset podcast and trying to improve\nthemself and get into personal\ndevelopment and growth\nyou're probably not shooting up black\ntar heroine on the weekends right\nthe reason why is because that's\nprobably below your standards\nnow what's the difference between that\nand the people out there that are\nlistening that you don't shoot black tar\nheroine but\nyou tend to stop really short of your\ngoals before you ever hit them\nright i know there's a lot of people\nthat listen to this and you stop short\njust a little bit short of your goals\nbefore you actually get there\nthat means that it's it's a standard for\nyou to not hit your goals what if your\nstandard was hey i'm not going to ever\nstop until i hit my goal\nright or giving up short on yourself\ngiving up just a little bit too early\nhow common it's so common for me when i\nwork with people to hear how many people\nget really excited about something some\ngoal some new year's resolution and then\nthey give up in the middle of it and\nthey're done with it right\nhow about this\nis it your standard to wake up the very\nfirst time your alarm goes off or do you\nhit snooze three times before waking up\nsee that's a standard you have the\nstandard of when my alarm gets up goes\noff my ass gets out of my bed and i do\nnot go back in that is a standard\nright people love to focus on habits and\nlike i said those are important but your\nhabits are just the offspring of your\nstandards so if you have a habit of\nwaking up and having a morning routine\nit's because your standards are i will\nwake up at 6 a.m or 5 a.m i will get out\nof my bed the first time the alarm goes\noff and i will not let myself go back to\nsleep that is a standard in the habit of\nthe morning routine is an offspring of\nthat standard right it makes sense i\ndon't know why nobody talks about this\nbecause your standards are actually more\nimportant than your habits your\nstandards create your habits so\ni'll give you a couple of examples\npeople want to wake up and have a\nmorning routine like we're talking about\nthey want that to be a habit of theirs\nbut they don't have the standard of\nwaking up when the alarm goes off they\ndon't have the standard of going to bed\nearly they don't have the standard of\ndoing what they say they're going to do\nthey don't have the standard of\nprioritizing their sleep they don't have\nthe standard of making sure everything\nin the morning is ready for the morning\nbefore they go to bed there are\nstandards that assist in making sure\nthat those habits are executed correctly\nand so what are your standards and where\ndo you need to improve them right you\nwon't go and shoot heroin but you will\nstruggle getting yourself out of bed in\nthe morning why standards it's all\nstandards\nright you have to and here's the\ninteresting thing and this is going to\nsound very drastic to most of you but\nwhen you get it you'll get it\nas drastic as it seems of like i would\nnever\nshoot heroin right like if you think\nthat to yourself like i would never\nshoot heroin\nthe mental the same mental disgust that\nyou have towards shooting heroin you\nshould have towards sleeping in\nthat's a standard and that's what i'm\ntalking about now you might be sitting\nthere going well that's pretty damn\ndrastic rob uh shooting heroin sleeping\nin those are not the same thing i know\nthey're not the same thing but can you\nmake them the mental equivalent where\nit's like i do not sleep in there is no\nway on god's green earth that i freaking\nsleep in at any point in time i get up\nwhen my alarm goes off because that's\nwhat i'm supposed to do the same way\nthat there's no way on god's green earth\nthat i'm going to take heroin and shoot\nit into my arms right the same way there\nneeds to be a a rock bottom for you\nright shooting heroin would be rock\nbottom not\nnot actually waking up and having your\nmorning routine and the habits and\nexecuting the weight you want to should\nbe a rock bottom for you\nso let's give another example look at\nyour body is your body right now your\ndream body or could it be better\nwell\nit is what it is because of your\nstandards\nright\nwhat about the food that you eat do you\neat fast food do you eat greasy food\nwings pizza all of that is a standard\nthat you're sticking to do you eat food\nthat's\nyou know if if you were to be taking\nyour food out right and you drop your\nfood in the parking lot\nand it falls on the concrete are you\ngonna pick it up and eat it after it\nfalls in the parking lot that everyone's\nbeen walking over and cars been going\nand birds have been on right probably\nnot why because eating food off of a\nparking lot is probably below your\nstandards but eating mcdonald's when you\nknow that you shouldn't isn't below your\nstandards right you see how these\ncorrelate\nthe same way that you wouldn't eat food\noff the floor should be there's no way\ni'm gonna eat some freaking mcdonald's\nthere's no way i'm gonna eat this greasy\nfood because i know when i do it's\nnumber one it's gonna make me fat at\nnumber two it's gonna make me tired\nnumber three i'm not gonna feel good\nnumber four i'm probably probably going\nto fart a lot right my wife isn't going\nto doesn't love isn't going to love that\nthere's standards you have to hold\nyourself to so that eating mcdonald's\nneeds to be the mental equivalent of\neating food off of the ground\nright look at your body again\nhow often do you work out how many times\na week do you work out per week\nwhat's your that what's your personal\nstandard what is it\nyou know i know people work out twice a\nday i also know people who haven't\nworked out in 10 years what's the\ndifference standards the standards that\nsomeone's going to hold themselves to\nand the level they will they will not\ndrop below\nif you want to know how to change your\nbody\nwhat do you need to change your\nstandards change your workout standards\nchange your lifestyle standards change\nyour mental standards how hard you go to\nthe gym because you could show up at the\ngym and you could you know walk on the\ntreadmill at you know slow pace for an\nhour if you want to or you can go in\nthere and have that mental standard of\nlike i'm going to work my ass off i'm\nnot going to leave until i burn 500\ncalories according to my apple watch\nwhatever it is you live and die by your\nstandards\nright they make the life that you have\ncurrently they have all of your\nstandards a cumulative effect of your\nstandards and your past standards and\nyour current standards have given you\nthe life that you currently have\nit's the truth\nbut those standards are not going to get\nyou the life that you want\nso the only difference between you now\nin this moment listening to those\npodcasts or watching this podcast the\nonly difference between you now and you\nin 10 years and having the perfect life\nand the perfect body and all the money\nyour bank account and the love and the\nhappiness and the success and the\ntraveling whatever it is that you want\nthe only difference between you now and\nthat version of you\nis that the two versions have two\ndifferent levels of standards there's\nyou now and there's a perfect you\nand the you that's the perfect you has\nfully maxed out their true potential and\nnot wasted their true potential and they\nhave fully decided to step into having\nthe highest standards that they possibly\ncan\nand this is everything in your life you\nhave standards for every single thing\nthat you do in your life all of your\ngoals do you come up short to your goals\ndo you give up too often\nyou know do not or do you not stop until\nthe goal is hit no matter how long it\ntakes\nright\ncome up short give up\ndon't quit no matter what\nwhat's the difference the standards\nright what about the relationships that\nyou have\ndo you cheat on your significant other\nor do you have a date night every single\nweek\nright do you turn off your phone at 7\np.m so it's you know just enough time\nfor the two of you to hang out\nthe difference is standards cheating on\nsomebody is one standard and you are\nlike well i'm okay with doing that\nthat that thing cheating on somebody or\ni will turn off my phone at 7 pm every\nsingle day so that i can have some time\nwith my significant other that's\nuninterrupted and you know what i'm also\ngoing to take her on a date every single\nweek\ndifference between the two of those\nthey're vastly different the standards\nthat i'm willing to hold myself to\nstands that you're willing to hold\nyourself to right what about your family\ndo you have a standard of you know hey i\ndo work so hard that i usually miss\ndinner with my wife and kids\nor do you have the standard of i\ndisconnect at 6 00 pm no matter what so\nthat i can be a fully present parent\nbecause being a present parent matters\nmore than all of the money that i can\nmake\nwhat's the difference standards\nyour body do you work out every single\nday\ndo you follow a healthy lifestyle do you\neat a lot of fast food do you skip\nworkouts often what's the difference\nbetween those two scenarios\nstandards what about your bank account\nright you have a lot of standards for\nhow much that you make\nhow much you save how much you spend\nif you're a saver that's a standard if\nyou're someone who spends a lot of money\nyou're not really good at saving money\nthat's a standard all of these things\ncan be changed at any point in time look\nat your work look at your career look at\nyour business\nall of that is a standard if you have a\nbusiness and you have people that work\nfor you in your business and there you\nfeel like they're lazy that's a standard\nbecause you don't hold them to a high\nenough standard and usually that means\nthat you're not holding yourself to a\nhigh enough standard\nif you want people who work really hard\nyou better be the one that's working\nreally hard first\nright people follow leaders\nare you a good leader right what about\nyour personal growth are you reading\noften\nare you skipping it\nare you telling yourself that you're\nyou're growing when in reality or not\nwhat is it all of them have to do with\nstandards the way you do one thing is\nthe way you do everything right there's\nno way that you're slipping on standards\nin your relationship\nand\ncheating\nbut you happen to be having this\nbusiness is crushing it no if you're\nslipping in one area of your life i\nguarantee you we can identify all of the\ndifferent areas of your life where you\nhappen to be you happen to be you know\ncheating and having low standards the\nway you do one thing is the way you do\neverything you live and die by your\nstandards\nthey make the life that you have\nthey will create the life that you want\nso the only difference once again\nbetween you\nnow and you in 10 years\nin the perfect life that you want is the\nstand that you hold yourself to so take\na quick\nlook around your life and start thinking\nto yourself what are the standards that\ni typically hold myself to\nwhat are the standards that are are\ngreat standards what are the standards\nthat i need to keep okay i'm really good\nat going to the gym let's say you're\ngood at going to the gym\ni'm not the best at eating healthy\nthough and i know that if i really want\nto get the body that i want\nwell i'm probably going to have to start\neating better okay so now i've noticed\nwhere i do well i've also noticed some\nplace where i need my standards to be\nbetter so about you what are places\nwhere your standards are good and you\nwould like to keep those what are places\nin your life where standards are not\nwhere they should be and you want to\nimprove those\nmaybe you have the standard of oh man my\nrelationship with my wife it's doing\ngreat we're doing good\nbut\nyou know what i'm missing my morning\nroutine almost every single morning\nyou want to miss my morning routine it\nstresses me out a little bit because i\nfeel like i could have done better i\nfeel like it was something that i needed\nyou know what i'm gonna have to go ahead\nand figure out you know how to make my\nmorning routine be better\nhow to make sure that i show up and if\ni'm missing my morning routine there's\nonce again when you do one thing as we\ndo everything there's probably other\nplaces that i could make my relationship\nbetter with my wife where i could make\nmy relationship better with my kids\nwhere i could show up as a better leader\nin my business the way you do one thing\nis the way you do everything so there's\nalways going to be other places so take\na look around you and start seeing where\nyou have good standards and where you\nhave standards that need to be improved\nand if you look at yourself in 10 years\nin the perfect life that you could have\nbecause it is\nout there for everybody and you look at\nthat life ask yourself what type of\nstandards would that person hold\nthemselves to\nright\nand\nrealize that when you truly level up all\nof your standards you're pulling your\ntrue potential out of yourself and your\nhabits will be created from that and for\nme personally\nthe way i see everything is i see life\nas this big game i feel like it's a game\ni'm just playing this game in every game\nthere's just a new level right there's\njust new levels that you get to and with\nnew levels there's always new challenges\nand i see everything as life as just a\ntest to see how i'm going to show up as\nif god or the universe or whatever it is\nthat you believe in is watching me at\nall points in time and if i have low\nstandards and you know let's say god's\nwatching down on me the universe is\nlooking at me and i have low standards\nas to sleeping in not holding myself to\na high state or not showing up in my\nrelationships all of this stuff i'm\ngoing to stay where i am why\nwould anybody reward me with anything\ngreat\nfor not doing anything great right it's\nlike you don't play could you imagine\nhow boring the video game would be if\nyou didn't have to accomplish anything\nbut you were just rewarded with gold\ncoins for just kind of doing nothing and\nyou know meandering all over the place\nno you've got to accomplish something\nright but if i hold myself to a high\nstandard\nhuh that's interesting because the\nuniverse tends to reward me every single\ntime i reward my i hold myself to a high\nstandard if i push myself without\nanybody else needing to push me if i\ntreat people the way that people should\nbe treated if i show up for people the\nway that i should show up for people if\ni work harder than anybody else if i\nmentally take care of myself and build\nmyself up it's like the universe just\ngives me gifts it's like the gold coins\njust start falling from the sky\nright but it all comes down to the\nstandards of what i deem acceptable and\nwhat standards i'm going to hold myself\nto so if you're out there and you don't\nhave the life you want currently like\nyou could have a great life and most\npeople listening probably have a great\nlife right it's good but you know that\nthere's more inside of you that more\ninside of you is going to take a shift\nin your standards not shifting your\nstandards is going to change your habits\nand the change of your habits and your\nactions is what's going to change your\nlife\nit's a top-down effect standards to\nhabits to actions that's what you need\nto focus on so as you're looking at your\nlife ask yourself once again\nthis life i have right now the standards\nthat i'm holding myself to where do i\nneed to hold myself to a higher standard\nand how should i pay attention to myself\nat a deep level and become very\nself-aware if my standards happen to dip\nso that i can make sure i pull myself\nback up and not allow myself to dip\nbelow because the only difference\nbetween you and the life that you want\nis the standards that you hold yourself\nto\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well it was\non like donkey kong comes out of the\nwomb and they're like i get stuff done\nbeing this badass productivity machine\nif you don't feel like you're\ndisciplined right now you're not\nstarting behind the eight\nball you"
