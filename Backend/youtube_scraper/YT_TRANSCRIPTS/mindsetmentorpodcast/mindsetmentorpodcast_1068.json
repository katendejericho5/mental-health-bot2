    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode with judd\nbrewer judd brewer is a psychiatrist\nwhose newest book unwinding anxiety\ntalks about the importance of figuring\nout where anxiety comes from how to work\nthrough it and how to get rid of it we\ndive really deep into the addiction of\nanxiety what causes it and how to get\nrid of it so with all of the stuff\nthat's happening in the world right now\nthat happened last year i can't think of\na better podcast episode for all of you\nguys to listen to and to be a part of so\nwithout further ado this is psychiatrist\njudd brewer\nwhen somebody's in a full-blown panic\ndisorder and they're they've developed\nthis system it seems like the way that\nyou explain it and the way that i love\nit is\ni guess the thing that i i feel like\nmost people in the world kind of\ni hear from them is that they feel like\nanxiety is something they can't really\ndo anything about\nbut from looking through what you say in\nyour book is it it actually explains\nmore of anxiety as being a habit is that\ncorrect yes and this is what blew me\naway you know when i was training to be\na psychiatrist i didn't learn any of\nthis stuff but doing\nresearch myself and as my lab started\nexploring how habits and addictions form\nit turns out that anxiety can be\nreinforced in the same way that any\nother habit or addiction can be\nreinforced and it was just kind of this\nobscure part of the literature that\npeople had been largely ignoring\nso in fact if you think of\nactually it's a very basic learning\nmechanism you know that helps us survive\nuh it has three elements that trigger a\nbehavior and a result\nso you know the survival piece is you\nknow you see some danger there's the\ntrigger you run away there's the\nbehavior and then the result is that you\nsurvive you know this is at least for\nour ancient ancestors but if you think\nof anxiety itself\nanxiety can trigger worry thinking and\nthat worry thinking leads us to feel\nlike we're in control\nor and or to avoid that feeling of\nanxiety itself and what that can do is\nthen feed back and trigger that same\nhabit loop every the next time we have\nanxiety because our brain has learned oh\nyou know next time you're anxious you\nshould worry about this does that make\nsense for sure no i feel like i know\npeople that are actually exactly in that\nloop so so what you're if i'm getting it\ncorrectly is the way that people\nactually kind of put their anxiety at\nbay is they worry so that they feel like\nthey're somewhat in control of the\ncircumstances yes\nokay i know it's crazy isn't it\nit's crazy when you say it but then i\nknow there's people listening they're\nlike yeah this is 100 me i'm worrying\ntoo much because the worry actually\nmakes me feel like i'm in control of my\ncircumstances in some way even though\nworrying does nothing for your\ncircumstances right right now what makes\nit worse\nis that maybe one in a thousand times\nwhen somebody worries they're like i'm\ngoing to think of all the worst case\nscenarios and i'm going to be prepared\nfor them\nthat one in a thousandth time when\nsomebody has had that scenario go\nthrough their mind and then suddenly it\nhappens and like wow see it was so good\nthat i worried about this because then i\nknew it was gonna happen\num so that can it's like playing the\nlottery you know it's like i wouldn't\ninvest in the lottery um but it gets\npeople addicted in the same way if\npeople happen to have that association\nwith like wow i worried and it and it\ndid come true that can actually make it\neven that worry habit leap even stronger\nthat's interesting i know people who um\ni know multiple people whose parents\nworry like crazy\nand they tend to place their worry on to\nthem\nand it's kind of like it's almost\nhereditary like it just comes down\nthrough generations where they learn to\nwhere they learn to where they learn to\nworry and\nthe justification that i hear from their\nparents is that i just love you so much\nand i want to make sure you're safe as\npossible but it sounds like when\nsomeone's outside of the nest the\nparents are actually justifying their\nfear of something happening for their\nchildren\nwith the worry and that makes them feel\nat least a little bit in control of a\nsituation that they're completely unin\ncontrol of is that kind of right as well\nthat is it in a nutshell because you\nknow if they look at the fallacy of that\nlogic you know\ni love you so much i want to make sure\nnothing happens\nthe worry actually makes it more likely\nthat something bad is going to happen\nbecause their worrying makes it harder\nfor them to think and to plan\nand on top of that\nthat seeds the anxiety\nin their children so you know children\nlearn from their parents and so they're\ngoing to model worrying for their kids\nand then their kids are going to grow up\nand be like man why am i worrying so\nmuch about my kids well it was because\nyour parents modeled that behavior for\nyou\nfor sure and so that's it's super\ninteresting be just because of the fact\nthat it's\nit's completely in our control\nbut i feel like most people act like\nit's completely not in their control and\nso i see a lot of\ni mean now is literally the perfect time\nto talk with us like i was saying at the\nvery beginning\nis there's so much anxiety about what\ncould possibly be happening in the\nfuture um but if you were to take out\neven just everything that's happened in\n2020 and beyond right and we could have\nnever seen this happen i feel like\nanxiety was still really on the rise a\nlot before covet popped up before all of\nthe things you know presidency popped up\nall those things popped up it seemed\nlike anxiety was really on the rise so\nif we just i want to go back to to covet\nand talk a little bit about it because i\nthink it'll really help people but even\nbefore that happened it seemed like\npeople were starting to get very anxious\num did you see that in your lab of\npeople getting more and more anxious and\nif you did what were the reasons why you\nsaw that more anxiety was was coming up\nyeah we saw this both in in my lab and\nalso in my clinic you know getting the\nprimary\nreferral that i get now from my clinic\nis people with anxiety\nand i think we can look at this in terms\nof uh there are a number of factors that\ncontribute but uncertainty is probably\none of the largest ones so\nfor example\nyou know with certain political figures\nthat are very erratic or\naren't very\ni don't want to use the word unstable\nbut\nyou know they're not necessarily\npredictable in how they're going to\nbehave right right that drives people's\nminds apeshit right because our brains\nour brains\nplan for the future based on previous\nevents and so our brains are going to do\nthese simulations and they're going to\nsay okay based on what happened before\ni'm going to project into the future and\nthat's going to help me survive\nyet if we don't know\nwhat you know\nhow if things are very uncertain let's\njust put it that way that uncertainty\nmakes our brains go into hyperdrive\nthinking that they need to get more\ninformation\nyet there's a ton of information out\nthere but it doesn't necess one it's a\nlot of it's not true\nand the second part is it's hard to sift\nthrough all of it to figure out what\ninformation is actually relevant to us\nso not only is there a ton of\nuncertainty happening you know whether\nit's uh environmental right now we're\nseeing this with health crises with with\ncovid uh politically you know people's\njobs all these things a lot of\nuncertainty\nand then on top of that you throw in a\nfire hose of information and people have\nto sift through it to figure out what's\npertinent and then they also have to\nsift through it to see what's real you\nknow from a survival standpoint our our\nancient ancestors\nyou know there were there were no such\nthings as like deep fake uh\nsaber-toothed tigers right you know\nyou're like is that really a cyber tiger\ncoming at me it was there yeah and they\nran so yeah so our survival brains are\nsaying they just take everything as\ngospel because that's how our survival\nbrains work\nand so we have to help our brains step\nback and say wait a minute you got to\nyou know before you freak out you got to\nsee if this is actually true so there's\nan added layer of complexity\nyeah that's interesting because it's\nalmost like what what you're saying is\npeople people's brains really want\nthings to stay consistent which is i\nfound a lot of people are miserable\nbut they're so comfortable in misery\nthat even getting out of that misery and\ndeveloping something beautiful of their\nlife kind of scares the out of them\nbecause it's so there's variables that\nthey don't understand because they\nhaven't been there yet and so people can\nliterally create anxiety about changing\ntheir life into a more beautiful future\nit seems like\nthey can and this relates a lot to you\nknow often people talk about being in a\ncomfort zone and then moving outside of\nthe comfort zone and how we deal with\nthat outside of the comfort zone makes a\nbig difference\nso comfort zones what you're talking\nabout where you know it's very\npredictable we you know if we set up a\nroutine or habit at home it just feels\ngood because our brain says okay i don't\nhave to worry here you know i don't have\nto um\ni can basically check out and it helps\nme save energy so i can save my brain\npower for learning things right when we\nmove out of that comfort zone\nour brain goes on high alert and if you\nthink about it from a survival\nstandpoint our brains you know it's like\nout on the savannah scanning for danger\nbecause it doesn't know that territory\nnow what we could do in in modern day\nwhen most of us aren't in actual\nphysical danger is we can actually lean\ninto that uncertainty and understand how\nour minds work so that we can say oh\nhere's this i instead of moving into\nthis panic zone like oh no this is\ndangerous and running back to our\ncomfort zone we can lean into that and\nsay oh\nhere's an opportunity to learn and grow\nand here it gives us the ability to lean\ninto that to say okay can i actually\nlearn from this can i can i grow\nin these moments of uncertainty as\ncompared to shrink back or panic you\nknow which are the two other options hey\nlet me tell you about my favorite drink\nthat i take every single morning it's\ncalled athletic greens and here's how i\nstart my day go to the restroom brush my\nteeth drink athletic greens and then\nmeditate and in just 30 seconds in one\nscoop i get 75 vitamins minerals

and\nit's not easy with social media and\neverything else to be so time consuming\naround us so you might think that you\ndon't have time to develop yourself but\nthere's an app that i've been using for\nyears that i highly recommend it's\ncalled blinkist blinkist is for anyone\nwho cares about learning but doesn't\nhave a whole lot of time what they do is\nthey take the key ideas and the insights\nfrom over 4 000 nonfiction bestsellers\nin more than 27 categories and they\ngather them into 15 minute text and\naudio explainers that help you\nunderstand the core ideas and over 15\nmillion people are already using\nblinkist to broaden their knowledge in\nthe 27 categories i spoke about those\ninclude self-improvement personal growth\nmanagement leadership mindfulness and\nhappiness and i love blinkist because\nit's short to the point exactly like i\nam and right now blinkist has an offer\nfor you if you go to blinkist.com\nmindset you start your seven day free\ntrial and you get 25 off of a blinkist\npremium membership that is blinkist\nspell b-l-i-n-k-i-s-t\ndot com mindset blinkist dot com slash\nmindset for 25 off and your free\nseven-day trial are you familiar with um\nwith andrew huberman\nso he's in stanford and he is a\nneuroscientist that's out in stanford\none thing that's really interesting is\nhe talks about how\num when you're about he deals a lot with\nneuroplasticity he says when you're\nabout to do something that you've never\ndone before you start to get really\nstressed out you start to get anxious\nand you know like you're saying it's\nbecause it's kind of like you're\nstepping out i always say like a comfort\nzone is like a caveman's cave you're\nstepping outside of it and there's much\nvariables you don't know what could\npossibly happen totally what he says is\nthat\num what's really interesting is what\ncauses neuroplasticity one of the big\npieces of of neuroplasticity is i guess\nacetylcholine uh and acetylcholine\nactually is what marks the brain for\nchange and what he says is that what's\nreally interesting about before\nacetylcholine becomes released\nis that you actually turn on the stress\nstress mechanisms in the brain\nand so when most people think i\nshouldn't be going further\nit's almost like that stress is telling\nyou you're about to change your body is\nabout to change your brain is about to\nchange and what you're saying is just\nlean into it yes yes\nso instead of the oh no like you know i\ngotta run back into the cave we can lean\ninto it and and bring in some curiosity\nlike oh\nwhat's happening here and what that\nactually can do\nanother stanford uh professor carol\ndweck she came up with this\nmindset model of growth versus fixed\nmindset so you can think of being in our\ncave is that fixed mindset where we're\nyou know this is how things work and\nthis is always the way that it's going\nto be\nmoving out of the cave is potentially\ngives us the potential to move into a\ngrowth mindset but we have to be open to\nchange\nand so we can look at that stress quote\nunquote as something that helps us open\nto that and say okay because that's\nbasically our brain saying okay i'm\nready to learn stuff\nyou know\nand there if we can open to it and bring\nsome curiosity in what that does is\nliterally opens us up to seeing things\nand seeing things differently or\nlearning something new\ni love the idea of just the curiosity\ninstead of the fear\ni have a friend who went and lived down\nfor 40 days with a native brazilian\ntribe like it took two days by boat to\ngo live with them he lived there for 40\ndays and he looked me dead in the eyes\nand the one thing he said he said you\nwanted the craziest part about it rob he\ngoes there is no depression with these\npeople\nand the reason why and is because\nthey've always got something to work\ntowards they're always working towards\nsomething they're always you know happy\nabout you know bringing home the\nanaconda they just killed for everybody\nbut one thing he said though is is he\nsaid he always had to\nwear with the machete because\nhe might come across something that's\ngoing to attack him so if he saw a\njaguar the jaguar has been seeing you\nfor a long time like it's it's an issue\nand so what he said is and the way he he\nsaid it to me was\nall my primal fears were turned on and\nall my intellectual feels turned fears\nturned off of people are worrying about\nme what am i thinking and i'm really\ncurious do you feel like the the main\nreason for this anxiety and everything\nthat's coming up now is that\nour brain still exists from millions of\nyears\nyou know 100 000 a million two million\nyears ago\nit hasn't changed as much as our\nexternal world has\nand we still have the the animalistic\npart of our brain that says i could be\nattacked by a lion even though i live in\naustin texas i could never be attacked\nthere are no lions in austin texas but\nthat part of my brain\ni guess the amygdala is always still\nsearching for something that could be a\npossible threat or fear in the future is\nthat right yes it's always on the\nlookout for danger you know unless we're\nin the cave\nright yeah and so\num i'm curious what what exactly\ntriggers someone's anxiety like what are\nthe triggers around that and some how\ncan someone become more\nself-aware to those triggers and\nactually work through them so that they\ncan actually have a system when they do\nhave anxious thoughts that come up\nit's a really good question i would say\nit's very individual in terms of what\ntriggers anxiety for people\nand often i see people just waking up in\nthe morning and feeling anxious and so\nhere\nanxiety can be its own trigger for worry\nwhich then feeds back to more anxiety\nbecause they're worried you know why am\ni why am i anxious is there something\nwrong and then it just kind of feeds on\nitself so i think here we can\ndifferentiate\ntriggers for anxiety and triggers for\nworry and here\nyou know that feeling of anxiety often\nit's hard for people to identify\nspecific triggers for that but one thing\nthat i do see is consistent is that\npeople with anxiety\nthat tends to trigger worry and worry is\none of the key uh key characteristics of\nanxiety disorders in particular if you\nlook in the psychiatric you know the the\ndiagnostic statistical manual there so\nyou can think of\na lot of things will trigger worry and\none thing so anxiety the feeling of\nanxiety can trigger worry another thing\nthat can trigger worry\nis just uncertainty\nwhere somebody doesn't know you know if\nthere's some big event that's going to\nhappen and they start worrying how you\nknow how's this going to go and they\nstart going through all the worst-case\nscenarios so those are some of the two\nof the big ones that i see in terms of\nuh precipitants or triggers for worry\nand if somebody catches themself\nokay they're in this this state of\nanxiety they feel it coming up what's\nwhat's the best route for them to go to\nkind of get themselves out of it and i\nguess you know recalling themselves\ndown this is one of the things that my\nlab has actually been studying so\nwe've been looking approaching this from\na neuroscientific standpoint which is to\nkind of understand how anxiety and worry\nhabit loops get perpetuated we just\ntalked about that that habit loop\nprocess\nand then asking questions like how can\nwe specifically target that from a\nmechanistic perspective\nso there's a there's actually a part of\nour brain called the orbital frontal\ncortex that\nstores and updates reward value for\ncertain behaviors and it's it sets up\nthis reward hierarchy so that we don't\nhave to relearn the reward value of\neverything we do every day so for\nexample you know\ni use an example in my book of broccoli\nversus chocolate right most of our\nbrains are have this chocolate over\nbroccoli hierarchy so that we don't have\nto like oh broccoli oh chocolate you\nknow and then decide you know every time\nwe we have the choice which one to eat\nthe reason i bring all of that up\nis that the thing that will change\nreward value of behaviors\nis awareness right and there's this we\ndon't have to go into all the specifics\nbut there are these these mathematical\nmodels that came out of the 70s by these\ntwo researchers with scorla and wagner\nbasically showing that we're going to\njust habitually act out certain\nbehaviors based on their previous reward\nvalue unless something changes and the\nonly thing that's going to change that\nis awareness to help us see oh this is\nmore rewarding than expected or less\nrewarding than expected now how this\napplies to anxiety\nis that we tend to see\nthe feelings of anxiety and the mental\nbehavior of worry as having a certain\nreward value\nyet if we pay attention to it and bring\nawareness to how rewarding the worry\nactually is we can start to see oh this\nworry isn't getting me anywhere\nand that leads to what's called a\nnegative prediction error our brain has\npredicted that it's going to be a\ncertain reward value and then we just\nbring awareness in and we're like wow\nthis is not very rewarding and so it\ndrops and what that does is it helps us\nstart to become disenchanted with the\nworry itself\nnow the reason i went through all that\nbackground is because this is very\ndifferent than the standard way that\nwe're taught even in residency training\nyou know to help people with with\nanxiety it's basically you know try to\ngive them some medications\ni wish our medications were better\nand you use\ncognitive control techniques you know\nthings like uh willpower or cognitive\nbehavioral therapy and you know like\nreplace these un unhealthy um mental\nhabits with or mental patterns with with\nhealthier cognitions the problem is that\nthat all relies on the\nyoungest and weakest part of our brain\nfrom an evolutionary perspective and\nironically that's the part of the brain\nthat goes offline when we get stressed\nout or anxious so we can't actually tap\ninto these these mechanisms so we need\nto find something that's going to be you\nknow a little more\na little stronger and this is where\nwe can actually tap into this reward\nvalue piece\nsimply through having people\nuh just get very very aware of what that\nworry uh gets them i can give a concrete\nexample from my clinic if that helps\nthat helps to drive at home\nso i had a patient who was referred to\nme for for anxiety and this is the\ngentleman that had he had panic disorder\nhe had generalized anxiety disorder and\nhe was\nuh terrified of driving on the highway\nbecause he he described it as i felt\nlike i was in a speeding bullet\nand\nwhat i had him do was after his first\nvisit\nwe was during his first visit we mapped\nout his habit loop around\nanxiety around panic in particular so\nit was he would have these thoughts like\ni'm gonna kill somebody on the highway\nhis behavior would be you know i'm not\ngoing to drive on the highway and then\nthe result was that he could avoid those\nreally distressing thoughts\nso we mapped that out and i sent him\nhome and i said just go and map out as\nmany of these things as you can and all\nthe things related to your anxiety all\nthese habit loops related to your\nanxiety and in particular pay attention\nto how rewarding they are using the\nsimple question what am i getting from\nthis right so when you're worrying ask\nyourself what am i getting from worrying\nis this actually helping me not\nintellectually but dropping into their\ntheir direct experience into their\nbodily sensations\nwhat's happening when i'm when i worry\nso this guy came back he actually he was\nvery overweight and he came back two\nweeks later and he said you know i\nmapped out these habit loops and i lost\n14 pounds\nand that was a surprise for me because\nwe weren't even going to address his\nobesity at the beginning but he had\nrealized that when he got anxious he\nwould eat and that eating wasn't\nactually fixing his anxiety and in fact\nit was making him feel worse about\nhimself because he knew\nthat it was he was very unhealthy\nso when he started seeing how\nunrewarding that habit loop was he was\nable to let go of it in fact he lost\nover 100 pounds\nsimply using that practice\nand\nthe same guy also\nhe went from not driving at all to\nbecoming an uber driver within five to\nsix months because he could start to see\nhow unrewarding the worry was\nand then he could start to bring in\ntools i think of it as like the bigger\nbetter offer right give your brain\nsomething more rewarding he started\nbringing in curiosity as that bigger\nbetter offer and he started to get\ncurious about what his what that worry\nyou know felt like in his body what the\nthoughts were and he could start to just\nnotice them and let them go

people because\nwhen you're talking about the youngest\npart of the brain the thinking party\nbrain are you speaking of the neocortex\nyes and the prefrontal cortex in\nparticular okay so the prefrontal cortex\nso you know i used to always say and we\nused to say this when i was you know\nwould manage people is that uh when\nemotion is high logic is low right and\nso\nwhat i always tell people is if you\nnotice something have a plan when your\nlogic is as high as possible not when\nyou're going through that like the worst\ntime to try to fix a relationship is in\nthe middle of a full blown fight right\nlike wait till you're chilled out but\nwhat it seems like is\nas i'm putting the pieces together\nis we see worrying as a reward for like\nwe were saying a little while ago for\nyou know we're at least being safe in\ncase something happens but it seems like\neverybody knows worry does nothing to\nthem but i think it seems like if you\nwere to write it down with a pen and\npaper and actually\nas if it were a business plan and you're\ntrying to create a blitz business you're\ngoing to put on a piece of paper but\nyou're most people don't take their mind\nwhere things can be very abstract and\nactually put them on a piece of paper it\ncould be out you know concrete and it\nseems like almost if you were to be able\nto write these things down and track\nthem you'd be able to see\nyeah this doesn't work here this doesn't\nhelp me here this doesn't help me here\nthis doesn't and then your brain as\nsmart as it is starts to go well this\ndoesn't hold as much value as i thought\nit did\nbut it seems like what needs to be needs\nto happen is you also need to have\nsomething to replace it and it seems\nlike from from what you're saying is\nthat curiosity is almost like like when\nsomebody worries they might get like the\ndopamine hit they want but it's also\nlike very anxious at the same time it\nseems like what you're trying to do is\nyou're trying to get the curiosity to be\na stronger dopamine hit that you feel\nlike your brain is getting a reward from\nbeing curious about oh why do i feel\nthis way versus the worry itself is that\nthe kind of the thing i'm getting there\nyeah this image is coming to mind as\nyou're saying that is you know this\nbusiness plan if you go and pitch a\nbusiness plan of worry to a bunch of\ninvestors they're going to say well go\nfind me some folks where this actually\nworks give me some use case scenarios\nand then you go out and you're like i\ndon't want to worry this is this doesn't\nhelp me and then they say okay we'll\nfind a different thing okay go try the\nuse case scenario of having people get\ncurious and you know get have them get\ncurious about what that you know those\nsensations of anxiety feel like in their\nbody can that actually help them\novercome things like anxiety and you\nknow is that something that that's going\nto actually be a viable business\nstrategy so to speak so absolutely i\nthink that's that's dead-on\nand um you were talking about a lot of\npeople will wake up and have anxiety and\ni know that for me like i don't have\nanxiety throughout the day but i found\nfor about six months i was waking up and\njust immediately upon going you know\nbrushing my teeth everything i was like\ni have these anxious feelings i was like\nwhy am i feeling anxious in the morning\nso i started reading and trying to\nfigure out what it was and it seems like\nwhat wakes most people up is actually\ncortisol right it's from what i've heard\nis that it wakes the cortisol is at the\nhighest in the morning so for me and\ni've you know i saw that in your book\nyou talk about meditation and\nmindfulness\nso if somebody wakes up in the morning\nthey feel those immediate thoughts of\nanxiety\ni mean what's one of the worst things\nthey could do they could probably drink\na coffee and then go on the internet\nright and go on social media that's\nprobably gonna make your anxiety\nfull-blown after that so instead of\ngoing that route what do you recommend\nfor people who wake up and feel anxious\nthoughts\nwell i think it's a great thing to do to\njust\ntake a beat so to speak so\nthis reminds me of something i learned\nin medical school which is if somebody\nis having a heart attack the first thing\nthat you should do is take your own\npulse\nwhich seems counterintuitive because you\nknow that our goal is to help you know\nhelp the person that's dying but what\nthat points out is if we are freaking\nout we're actually going to make things\nworse yeah and i think this can be true\nfor our us\nourselves so\nif we wake up and we feel anxious and we\ngo get coffee go get a stimulant\nwe're just adding you know fuel to that\nfire\nwhereas if we can\ntake a moment take a beat or maybe you\nknow take five or ten minutes and just\nuh\nyou know i i hesitate to use the word\nmeditate because it has all sorts of\nconnotations for people but let's say\ntake five minutes to just simply scan\ndown through our body and get really\ncurious about where we feel different\nsensations in our body in that you know\nin that five minute period\nthat can help ground us a bit so that we\ncan then get up and go throughout our\nday without kind of spiraling out of\ncontrol\nand one thing i'd like to do to kind of\nhelp people wake up to their own natural\ncapacity to be curious\nis if they're feeling anxious\nto just feel into where they feel that\nanxiety most in their body\nand then ask themselves do i feel it\nmore on the right side or the left side\nof my body\nright and what that does\nis i think you just kind of did that hmm\nis this on the right side or the left\nside right it doesn't matter what site\nit's on right but what that does is it\nawakens our curiosity like huh if i had\nto pick which side is it on so that\nbrings that awareness in and helps us\nsee oh these are just physical\nsensations and it also awakens that\ncuriosity which is very much an antidote\nfor getting caught up in anxiety\nyeah that's and that's good because the\nthe next question i was going to ask you\nis it seems like\na lot of people that i've worked with\nand spoken with it seems like a lot of\npeople have lost a lot of their\ncuriosity they've lost a lot of their\nyou know\nlike being a kid it's like you're\ncurious about everything and you know\nyou can dream the biggest dreams you\ncould possibly but as you become older\nyou kind of become set in your ways and\nyou it it seems like being curious or\nactually just trying to think something\namazing in the future is different from\nwhere you currently are tends to be a\nchore with people and it tends to be\nhard but\nthe questions kind of answer i was going\nto ask you like what is the best case\nlike what's the best thing to do in that\ncase it seems like just ask yourself\nlike do i feel it more in my left or\nright\nwhich is just a simple question you\ndon't have to really\nvisualize or think of anything or you\nknow try to see a glowing ball that's in\nfront of you like you know all of the\nmeditations have it's just like okay do\ni feel it more in my left or my right\nright and um in that situation do you\nfeel like uh or do you ever recommend\nfor people to write these things down\nlike i was saying previously do you find\nthat that helps with some people i think\nit can be very helpful for a lot of\npeople so really some people they like\nto write things down they like to see it\non paper and there's something really\ntransformative\nabout just seeing something on paper\nthat was in their head that just makes\nit very concrete and often it's this big\nwake up and they say wow\ni was thinking that you know\nthe other thing that that helps with\nis you can think of this as the observer\neffect so in physics you know back back\nin the day when they were starting to do\nthese quantum physics experiments there\nwas this they found that by doing these\nslit lamp experiments with light to try\nto determine you know whether it's wave\nor particle and all this that actually\nby adding an\nobservation device to measure photons\nthey were changing the results right so\nthey call this i think it's the\nheisenberger factor the uh the\nobserver effect and the same is true\npsychologically so if we can observe our\nthoughts and emotions\nwe can see oh\nsimply by observing that gives us some\ndistance and some perspective rather\nthan being i totally identified with\nthem so we can actually employ that\nobserver effect ourselves and the\nwriting down on paper can add even more\ndistance there\nyeah that's it and you bring in a really\ngood point where it bringing the\nobserver into it\nbecause a lot of people have say\nsomething like i have anxiety\nso instead of saying like i'm feeling\nanxious feelings right and and people\ntend to identify with\nwhatever they've been told that they\nhave or you know\nthat it's you know it's it's really\ninteresting the perception of somebody\nwill change when their identity around\nthat thing tends to change\nso\nif somebody has anxiety is it better for\nthem to say like at times i feel anxious\nthoughts or do you feel like it's better\nto actually say i have anxiety which in\nsome sense i think changes someone's\nidentity and their perception of himself\ni think this is something that people\ncan experiment with i love where you're\ngoing with this uh so the at the far end\nof that spectrum i have patients who\ncome in and say i am an anxious person\nthat's how identified they are with it i\nremember somebody\nso we we made this app called unwinding\nanxiety same name as the book\nand somebody wrote me an email who is\npilot testing the program and she wrote\nme this email and she said i feel like\nanxiety is deeply etched into my bones\nright that's how identified she was with\nthe anxiety so somebody can explore this\nthemselves and say what's it feel like\nwhen i say i'm an anxious person what's\nit feel like\nwhen i uh\njust\nnotice those thoughts and say oh i have\nanxious thoughts and what's it like to\nsimply notice oh\nthere's an anxious thought\nit doesn't even have to belong to me\nright so somebody can explore that and\nsee what is it like i'm anxious versus\nthere's an anxious thought\nand i can you know spoiler alert\na lot of folks it's it's game changing\nfor them just to see that they don't\nhave to be there uh identified with\ntheir thoughts and emotions that they\nare not their thoughts that is huge for\na lot of people and anybody can do this\nexperiment you know i'm anxious versus\nhere's an anxious thought\nyeah\nand it's kind of like like my favorite\none of my favorite quotes is by alan\nwatts and he says you're under no\nobligation to be who you were five\nminutes ago you know and i kind of think\nof it the easiest way to think of\nanxious thoughts happy thoughts whatever\nit is like it's rainy here in austin\ntoday but it's not going to be rainy\nforever right and so it's kind of like\nit's a rainy day\nand the anxious thoughts can come in for\nan hour two hours but\nit's not behind it is the sun\nbut when you identify as i am an anxious\nperson it's kind of like saying that is\nthe sun and it will always be that way\nit'll always be there but it seems like\nthe the main thing is to kind of\nunwrap your identity from that thing\nthat you think that you have and go i'm\nhaving anxious thoughts right now okay\ni'm having happy thoughts right now and\nnot identify yourself with the thoughts\nand the feelings that you have that run\nthrough your body and your brain\nabsolutely so if you think about this in\nterms of our brains wanting to have\ncertainty you know the way to have\ncertainty is to try to keep things from\nchanging\nwell we can flip that on his head\nand\nyou know accept the fact that we are\nconstantly changing as human beings you\nknow we're constantly aging we're\nconstantly changing the world is\nconstantly changing\nand so there you can think of as the\nonly unchanging thing is change itself\nand if we can start to live into that\npiece and kind of ride that wave\nsuddenly things get a lot easier to work\nwith just like you're talking about oh\nthings are changing you know the\nweather's this way in this moment but it\nthe weather constantly changes my mind\nis like this in this moment\noh but things are constantly changing\nit's really helpful to be able to kind\nof get on that constantly changing train\nas compared to\nreally struggling all of our lives\ntrying to make things not change and it\nalso helps us start to see how much\nsuffering we cause for ourselves by\ntrying to make things not change\neverything from relationships to\nyou know our bodies\nit's funny because i guess even the\nphrase i'm an anxious person is me\ntrying to find certainty and create no\nchange\nright so when you're saying\ni'm just a human that experiences\ndifferent emotions\nit's kind of a lot easier in that sense\nwhere it's like there is certainty there\nbut then the anxious and the happy will\ncome up in some form or another\num so\nobviously i'm really curious about this\nand i'm i don't know i don't even know\nhow to dive into it exactly but i'm\nreally curious at this point in time\nwith all the stuff that's happening with\ncovet all this stuff happened with the\nelection with vaccines with all the\nstuff that's coming up i mean what tips\nand how can people\ncreate less anxiety more happiness than\nall of the change that's happening right\nnow knowing that they want certainty\nyes so i think of this as a three-step\nprocess and i've seen this both in my\nclinic and also in the research that\nwe've done\nwhere the first step here is just to be\nable to see how our minds create habit\nloops around anxiety so the first step\nis just mapping them out you know what's\nthe trigger what's the behavior is it\nworry is it fear is it whatever and\nwhat's the result of that\nstep two is what you and i just talked\nabout a little while ago is around\nseeing how unrewarding that behavior is\nso that habit loop so if it's worry we\ncan ask ourselves you know what's the\ncause and effect relationship here what\ndo i get from worrying so that we get\nthat negative prediction error in our\nbrain says wow that's really not as\ngreat as i remembered\nthat opens that door for step three\nwhich is to bring in the bbo the bigger\nbetter offer and here the simplest\nbigger better offer that i love i think\nof it as a superpower\nis curiosity you know so in those\nmoments when we're anxious\ninstead of\nfalling into an old habit of worrying\nabout why we're anxious\nwe can simply get curious about what\nthose sensations feel like in the moment\nand then this gets back to what you were\njust talking about we can see that these\nsensations are constantly changing and\ninstead of worrying like oh no this\nfeels bad right now\nyou know instead of the oh no we can\ndive in and say oh what is this where do\ni feel it is on the right side left side\nfront back those types of things and\nthen it's just basically\nrinse and repeat you know that's\nbasically what i wrote the whole book\nabout was to help people kind of\nunderstand this from a neurobiological\nperspective and then put it into action\nin their own lives\nyeah it kind of goes back to the whole\nphrase of like the world's happening to\nme versus the world is happening for me\ni think right where it's like if you\nthink that the world's happening to you\nand you're just trying to dodge a bunch\nof stuff as you wake up dodge\ncircumstances all day long it's going to\nbe stressful it's going to be anxious\nbut if you look at income\nyou know i think that it comes down to\ncontrol problems which i think a lot of\npeople really have i've realized through\nsome psychedelic experiences control\nproblems were really my issue and as\ni've tried to get rid of those it's\nhelped and been like man like i i can't\ncontrol almost anything i can barely\ncontrol anything in myself\nright and uh and so if you think about\nthe world's happening for me it's like\nokay are these the circumstances that i\nwould choose for myself no\nbut if life is this game if we just look\nat it as a game this is my level that\ni'm on and i have to deal with these\ncircumstances to get to the next level\nand it seems like for you it's like\nall right let's be curious if we're in\nthis if it's happening to me it you know\nthen it's gonna be hard if it's\nhappening for me\nwhy is this happening for me like what\nthat seems more fun to me than being\nlike oh my god this is terrible this is\nhappening to me right why is this\nhappening for me like what is it that\nwhat can i see about this breakup what\ncan i see about this whole thing that's\nhappening for me\nto make my future better yes and so in\nthat sense we can\nbow to every circumstance as a teacher\nyou know there's this you know the\nphrase you know two steps forward one\nstep backward\nwell i would throw out there\nif we are learning from that\nquote-unquote step backward\nis it actually a step backward because\noften we learn more from our mishaps\nthan from things going well\nand so if we're actually learning from\nthat step backward are we ever going\nbackwards if we're actually open to\nlearning in each moment\nright it's it's like a you can't have an\narrow go anywhere unless you pull it\nback to launch it and the further back\nyou pull it the farther it's going to go\ntotally but\nbow to every circumstance as a teacher\nis what you said i might i might have to\nget that as like a tattoo i feel like\nthat's the perfect phrase for if people\ncould just wrap up this entire thing\nit's just bow to every circumstance if\nit's a teacher for you there's a lesson\nin every single thing whether it's good\nor bad and\nusually the biggest lessons and the\nbiggest teachers are in the bad things\nthat happen totally so\ni think it's a good way to end it right\nthere that was a great that was a great\nlittle ending i i i love that phrase i'm\ngonna write that one down as soon as we\nget done so um the book is called\nunwinding anxiety um for people who want\nto go out there and purchase it i'm sure\nit's available everywhere you could\npossibly purchase it and for anyone else\nwho wants to dive deeper into it um how\ncan they connect with you and and you\nknow obviously go by the book at amazon\nand barnes noble all those places but if\nsomeone wants to learn more about you\nand more about your app how can they\nfind more about you\nuh my website is doctorjudd.comdrjud\nand that has a bunch of resources talks\nabout the apps\nthat we've developed you know the one\nfor anxiety as well as eating and\nsmoking\na bunch of and also has links to my book\nand ways to contact me if folks are on\ntwitter they can hit me up on twitter at\njudd brewer j-u-d-b-r-e-w-e-r\nnice\nwell man i appreciate it i think this is\ndefinitely\nthe best time for this book to come out\nand i think a lot of labs are gonna be\nchanged from so i appreciate you for\nthat thank you hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you love this\nvideo i've got another one you're going\nto love just click right here and watch\nit"
