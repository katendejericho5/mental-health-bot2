    "transcript": "you are your abuser let me say that\nagain for everyone in the back you are\nyour abuser if you talk down to yourself\nyou're your abuser you are the abuser\ntoday ladies and gentlemen we're going\nto be talking about how to have more\nself love how to have more self love how\nto have more confidence and how to\nchange the way that you speak to\nyourself and i hear this way too often\none of the most requested things that i\nget from people who send me messages on\ninstagram and i look through all of my\ninstagram messages that i get from\npeople hundreds of them a day usually\nand i got i get to see what people say\nabout themselves and about what they\nthink about themselves and what\nquestions they have around the world and\nthen when i see something that happens a\nlot what i do is i take that and then i\ngo okay i should do an episode on this\nso if you do want to send me an\ninstagram message let me know what you\nwant me to do episodes on you can\nmessage me rob dow jr r-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r\nbut let's talk about self-love because\nthat's one of the messages i get the\nmost and first off let's talk about why\nself-love is so important because\nself-love either hurts your confidence\nor it helps your confidence and that in\nturn depending on how confident you are\nas a person\nchanges the actions that you take or the\nactions that you do not take so\ni'll give you an example let's say that\nsomeone's a very confident person and\nthey want to go and start a new business\nif they're confident in themselves\nthey're going to be confident in their\nbusiness and they're going to\ntake some actions that somebody who\nisn't confident probably wouldn't take\nthey're going to believe in themselves\nmore when things get hard they're not\ngoing to give up when things get hard\nthey're going to keep going they're\ngoing they're going to when things get\nharder when they fail or something\nmesses up or they do have a bad month in\ntheir business they're gonna sit there\nand they're gonna speak to themselves in\na way to build themselves up versus tear\nthemselves down and so\nthe confidence comes from the way that\nyou speak to yourself the way that you\nspeak to yourself builds confidence or\ntears it down and that in turn affects\nall of the actions that you do or do not\ntake so it also just affects the way\nthat you feel in the way that you carry\nyourself doesn't it at every moment the\nway that you feel the way that you carry\nyourself is changed by how confident you\nare and how you speak to yourself it\naffects the way that you interact with\neveryone in the world around you which\nthen in turn affects for instance\nwhether you do or do not get a\nsignificant other\nit also affects who the significant\nother is that you attract right\nbecause you attract someone who is like\nyou\nso if you want a really awesome guy\nwho's super confident guess what you\nneed to be\nif you want a really awesome girl who's\nreally confident guess what you need to\nbe you need to be confident as well and\nthat comes from the way that you speak\nto yourself you won't be an unconfident\nperson\nand somehow attract someone who's super\nconfident that energy just won't match\nand men i know you can relate i can\nrelate to attract a badass confident\nwoman you have to be on a whole other\nlevel of confidence because i know that\nmost women aren't attracted to someone\nsomeone who's very confident in\nthemselves and in a badass woman is not\ngoing to be attracted to someone who is\nweaker or who doesn't believe in\nthemselves and all of that comes back\ndown to that one thing that we're\ntalking about today which is self-love\nso in today's episode i'm going to be\nteaching you some tips on how to have\nmore self-love how to speak to yourself\nand how to build yourself up\nmore than anything else and i want to i\nwant you to kind of imagine this with me\nright i'm going to take you on a journey\nand i want you to just think about the\nenergy behind this journey okay\nimagine with me for a minute a child who\nis talked down to their entire lives\nright let's say that their parents are\nterrible parents\nand this child hears everything they get\ntold that they're stupid\nyou're so stupid why do you do that they\nhear it all day long you're stupid they\nhear they're worthless all day long they\nhear they're unlovable they hear that\nthey're fat they hear that they'll never\namount to anything day in day out most\nof the day the things that they hear\nfrom their parents are how worthless how\nfat how stupid how ugly they are\nright that's terrible isn't it\nbut it happens\ndo you know how wounded that child will\nbe if they keep hearing these things\nover and over and over and over again\nthey're going to be wounded how do you\nthink that will affect them\nhow do you think it will affect what\nthey believe in themselves when they\ngrow up do you think that a child that's\ntold that all day long\nby somebody is going to grow up and be\nsuper confident\nand take the actions towards the life\nthat they want or do you think that\nthey're probably going to have a lot of\ntrauma and things to work through all\nthe time\nthey're probably going to have a lot to\nwork through right\nhow do you think it's going to affect\nthem what do you think that they're\ngoing to believe\nyou can see this right you can see how\nsomebody speaking to a child\nis going to change the way they feel\nthink about themselves you understand it\nright\nwhat the f is the difference between\nthat child and you\nthere is no difference if you talk\nnegatively to yourself\nyou might think oh well that child\nthough they're young they're they're\nimpressionable guess what you're\nextremely impressionable and guess what\nyou are probably the just so you know if\nyou want to know statistically the\naverage person says anywhere between\nthinks anywhere between 60 to 80 000\nthoughts a day\nand 90 of those are negative this is\nstatistical averages\n60 to 80 000 thoughts every single day\nand 90 percent of them are negative\nthat's more than the child's being\ntalked down to\nso don't think that there's a difference\njust because you're older\nthere is no difference right don't think\nthat that because of the fact that\nyou're older because you have more life\nexperience that you're going to be able\nto get through it easier there is very\nlittle a difference very little\ndifference between that child and their\nabuser the only difference is that you\nare your abuser\nlet me say that again for everyone in\nthe back you are your abuser if you talk\ndown to yourself\nyou're your abuser you are the abuser\nthe empowering thing about the child is\na child can at least walk away\nyou can't walk away from the thoughts in\nyour head so guess what you're going to\nhave to start to work on\nthat's right the thoughts in your head\nif you talk down to yourself if you talk\nnegatively to yourself you are your own\nabuser there's a really great video\nmaybe you've heard me talk about it\nbefore but my friend my friend jay\nshetty put it up and um he sat down with\nthese women that were in their 20s and\n30s and he gave him a pen and paper and\nhe said hey i want you to write down all\nof the negative things that you say to\nyourself whether it's out loud or\nwhether it's in your head\nhas them write all these things down all\nof the negative stuff they write it down\nthey write it down just make a list you\nknow anything that you say about the\nwhat you think about yourself the way\nthat you look\nuh the way that you you look in your\nclothes which you fit the\nin your clothes the the stuff that you\nsay when you don't work out just write\nall the things you could possibly think\nof that you typically say to yourself on\na weekly basis so they write all this\nstuff down and he says okay go ahead and\ncome with me real quick and he takes\nthem into another room and they don't\nrealize it\nbut in that other room is their little\nsister so these women that are 20 30\nyears old have these little sisters that\nare like 10 11 12 13\nreally impressionable age right and he\nsits them down and he says okay\ni want you to look at your sister and i\nwant you to say\nto her what you just wrote down and the\nlook on these women's faces are like\npetrified they're tariff there's no way\nthey would never\never\nsay something to their little sisters\nthat they have on that piece of paper\nthey wouldn't say those things\nso if they wouldn't say it to them\nwhy are they saying it to themselves\nnow i know there's people out there\nlistening and there's light bulbs going\noff you would never talk to someone that\nyou love the way that you talk to\nyourself sometimes\nso why do you do it\nyou know let's say one of your friends\nsends you a text message and she's like\nhey\njust had a really bad first date do you\nhave time for a call and you're like\nyeah absolutely she calls you\nokay\nshe's like ugh i just feel really down\non myself because the fact that i was at\nthis first date and i really started to\nlike this guy and then at the end of the\ndate i wanted to go further and he's\nlike listen i'm just not really\ninterested i think you're nice but i'm\nnot really interested and and i don't\nreally think that we should go on a\nsecond date\nwould you then say to your friend well\nyeah of course he said that because\nyou're ugly\nof course he said that because you're\nstupid of course he said that because\nyou probably don't fit in that dress\nvery well of course you said that do you\nwant to know why because you got that\npimple that's on your nose of course he\nsaid that because everybody tends to\nwalk away from you of course he said\nthat because you're unlovable of course\nhe said that because this this and this\nand this would you ever\nsay that to one of your best friends\nafter they're going through something\nlike somebody not being interested in\nthe first date\nwould you\nyou would it\nso why would you say it to yourself\nthink about that put yourself in this\nsituation maybe you haven't had that\nexact same situation happen to you but\nmaybe you've had some sort of situation\nwhere someone that you're not interested\nsomeone that you're interested in is not\ninterested in you and so what do you do\ninstead of building yourself up you\nbreak yourself down of course he's not\ninterested in you of course he's not\ninterested in you because you're too fat\nbecause you're unlovable because you're\nstupid because this and this and this\nand this and this and you just list off\nall of the reasons why somebody would\nnot be interested in you\nwhy\nhow in the hell does that help you in\nany sort of way\nright one of the things that that i do\nwhenever i get up i've done this many\ntimes speaking on stage is i'll stand in\nfront of a group of people and i'll say\neverybody get your pen and paper out\nreal quick i'm a couple hundred people\nin the crowd and i say okay\nhere's what i want you to do\ni want you to i'm gonna give you 60\nseconds i want you to write down\neverything that you don't like about\nyourself everything negative everything\nthat's bad in your life everything you\ndon't like about yourself just write it\nall down it could be some it could be in\nyour head it could be something\nphysically it could be something that\nyou've done in the past i want you to\nwrite down every possible thing that you\ncan think that you don't like about\nyourself every negative thought that\ncomes into your head everything that you\ntypically say just think all of that\nstuff put it down on a piece of paper\nwrite it all down\nlet's see who can get the most ready set\ngo\nand it's insane to see this because i do\ni've done this so many times and i let\nthem go for 60 seconds and people are\nwriting like they're basically\nscribbling like they're writing so fast\nbecause they have so many things that\nthey can write down they're writing and\nwriting and writing and writing it looks\nlike they're trying to literally tear\nthrough the paper there's some sometimes\nthere's so many things and i'm like how\nmany did you get you know raise your\nhand if you got more than 20 everyone's\nhand goes up raising you've got more\nthan 30 everyone's hand stays up raise\nyour keep your hands raised if you did\nmore than 40 50 60 70 80.\nand then usually we'll get to around 60\n70 things is the person who got the most\nright and i say okay let's try something\nelse i'm going to give you 60 seconds i\nwant you to write down every single\nthing that you love about yourself\nready set go\nand the\nthe blank stare that i get on people's\nfaces is\neye-opening because people are looking\nat me like\nuh\ni don't\nknow a whole lot of things and then they\nwrite down a couple things a couple of\nthings\nand then you can literally see the\naverage person has like four things on\ntheir paper that they come up with that\nthey love about themselves\nfive things they come up with\nsix things the most will get like 17\nthat they love about themselves when the\nother way around the most they had was\nlike 80 of the things they hate about\nthemselves\nright just think about that for a second\nhow crazy is that that people\nand the reason why is because people are\nnot usually focusing on what it is they\nlove about themselves usually focusing\non the things that they hate about\nthemselves the things that they don't\nenjoy\nwhat's that gonna do for you\nright we're always focusing on what's\nwhat we don't have what we're not good\nat\nit's crazy to see it because you can\nliterally see in someone's face as\nthey're writing oh my gosh i don't know\nany i put up a picture the other day and\nit was a pic a quote on my instagram and\nit said if i told you if\nif i\nthe quote said if i told you to write\ndown all of the things that you love how\nlong would it take until you named\nyourself\nand so many people responded that\nwouldn't even have popped into my head\nright\nso we get caught up in who we are who\nwe're not we compare ourselves to\neverybody else right comparison is the\nthief of all joy\nyou don't love your body because you're\nlooking at somebody on instagram\nyou tell yourself you have a fat ass\nbecause you're comparing yourself to\nsome photoshop model on instagram you\ndon't have the same butt that she does\nright you talk trash to yourself because\nyou procrastinate and you just happen to\nsee a picture of one of your friends\nfrom high school who just bought a\nmassive house so then you start\ncomparing yourself and how you're not\ngood enough and you procrastinate\nearlier today and i bet he didn't\nprocrastinate or she didn't\nprocrastinate when they to be able to\nbuy that house but look at me there i am\nagain just procrastinating right you're\npissed off because you're you're driving\na 20-year-old kia and you're thinking\nabout the 18 year old millionaire that\njust got became a millionaire off of\nbitcoin putting up pictures on his\ninstagram of his new lamborghini right\nso you're looking at what you have\nand don't have and you're comparing it\nwith what other people have or don't\nhave which might not even be a true\nreality which is the craziest part about\nit right\nbut i want you to realize this where you\nare right now\nis where you are it is a fact\nyou are nowhere else you are where you\nare\nall of the things that you've done in\nthe past all the things you've thought\nall the action if you take have gotten\nyou to exactly where you are right now\nthere's nothing that you can do to\nchange that\nthe only thing that you can change is\nfrom right now\nmoving forward\nand here's the thing\ni do know one thing\nit's a lot harder to get motivated to go\nto the gym it's a lot harder to get\nmotivated to stop procrastinating it's a\nlot harder to do the things that you\nneed to do in order to create the life\nthat you want when you feel like crap\nit is like if i don't feel good it's\nhard to get myself motivated to go to\nthe gym it's hard to get myself to not\nprocrastinate i don't feel good\nwhen you don't feel good you don't take\naction and guess what talking trash to\nyourself does\nit makes you feel like\nnobody's ever been like man i'm so glad\nthat i spent about 35 minutes talking to\nmyself today because it really motivated\nme to go to the gym very rarely does\nanybody get stoked about life\noh yeah i felt really good when i\nstarted comparing myself to that 18 year\nold bitcoin millionaire whatever it is\nthat's going on right\nso you have to realize\nthink about this way how do you feel\nwhen someone is telling you\nhow great you are\nhow much better your body looks than it\ndid last month right how proud of you\nthey are\nhow much they love you\nwhen someone tells you those types of\nthings how does that make you feel\nnot what do you think about it how does\nit make you feel\ninternally physically in your body how\ndoes it make you feel when someone is\nsaying amazing things about you\nimagine if you had someone in your ear\nall day every day telling you about how\namazing you are about\nwho you are about what you could be\nabout what you could create\nwouldn't that be a lot better than\nhaving someone talk trash in your ear\nall day long tell you about how you're\nnot good enough are you worthless are\nyou not smart enough pretty enough\ngotta you know chunky legs\nwhatever it is that you tell yourself\nright you've got to be your biggest fan\nbecause here's the thing no one else is\ngoing to be your biggest fan if you're\nnot\nyou're either your biggest fan or your\nbiggest critic\nso i want to ask you which one are you\nare your biggest fan or your biggest\ncritic because if you're your biggest\ncritic it's going to be really hard to\nbe motivated to create the life that you\nwant do you know why because when your\nbiggest critic and you're talking trash\nyourself you feel like and when you feel\nlike you don't get motivated go do\nthings when you don't feel good you\ndon't take action so you get what you\nfocus on\nwhat are you focusing on are you\nfocusing on the improvements that you've\nmade since last year are you focusing on\nyou're still not where you want to be\nyou focusing on the you know the fact\nthat you've lost 10 pounds are you\nfocusing on the fact that you still need\nto lose 20.\nthink about that\nand it's something that we've all done\nwe've all done this we've this is\nsomething that every human deals with in\nsome sort of way let me give you a tip\non something that would help you that\ni've done before\nand this is a little ceremony that you\ncould do for yourself for your fears\nyour limiting beliefs for all the trash\nthat you think to yourself i want you to\ntake a pen and paper\ni want you to write down everything that\nyou say to yourself all of the trash all\nthe things that you want to get rid of\nall the things you want to release all\nthe things that you say to yourself that\nyou no longer want to say to yourself\neverything that holds you back\nall of those things once you write down\nall of the things that hold you back in\nsome sort of way\nokay all the ways you talk to yourself\nthen i want you to make a massive list\nof all of your fears all the things that\nyou're worried about other people's\nopinions rejection failure\nwrite it all down as much as you could\npossibly think of then i want you to\nwrite down your limiting beliefs all the\nthings that you think are truly holding\nyou back but in reality they don't even\nexist most of the time write it all down\ni want you to write down every single\nthing that you could possibly think of\nand i know the majority of you listening\nare not going to do this i'm realistic i\nunderstand that but what i do want you\nto do for the five percent of you that\ndo do this is actually do this and take\ntime because i promise you it'll it'll\nhelp you out a lot\nthen what i want you to do is i want you\nto look at the list of all those things\nand i want you to think all of them\nthink those\nthings that you've said to yourself\nthank those fears thank those limiting\nbeliefs have a moment of they got you to\nwhere you are but they're no longer\ngoing to serve you and you're going to\nlive the rest of your life without them\nyou're going to live the rest of your\nlife without those thoughts you're going\nto live the rest of your life without\nthose fears you're going to live the\nrest of your life without those limiting\nbeliefs\nwhat i want you to do actually i'm not\ngoing to i'm not gonna recommend this\nbecause i don't want anybody burning\ntheir house down but what i would do\ni'll just say it that way what i have\ndone in this situation is to look at all\nof those things\nand to then take it light it on fire\nand then throw it inside of a trash can\nyou know like a metal trash can i've\ndone it that way and i've also done it\ninside of a sink before because sinks\nare usually metal right and literally\nwatch those things burn away and realize\nthat's how much they actually physically\nexist in this world they don't need to\nbe with you any longer in the future\nand let go of them\nbecause you're either your biggest fan\nor your biggest critic the more that you\nbuild yourself up the more confidence\nthat you have the more confidence that\nyou have the more that you will step\nconfidently into the future that you\nwant to create\nso\nyou would never talk to yourself the way\nthat someone that you you never talk to\nsomeone that you love the way that you\ntalk to yourself\nso from this moment on start to be more\naware\nof the thoughts that you have the things\nthat you say about yourself and if you\nsee something pop up that you don't like\nchange it in that moment switch to the\nthought that you would prefer\nto have about yourself\nand that\nis the way that you build yourself up\nand also\nthe way that you're going to have more\nself-confidence the way that you're\ngoing to talk to yourself the way you're\ngoing to love yourself at a deeper level\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well stop\ndoing things that you don't like i don't\nknow about you but for that"
