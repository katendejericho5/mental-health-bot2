    "transcript": "there's one thing in this world that i\ndon't want you to be\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nall of the limitations that you place on\nyourself all of the things that you\nthink are real are completely optional\nall of your limitations are optional and\ni'm going to start off with a story\nback in 1954 and before 1954 for all of\nhuman history i guess until you know\ntime came in and people started\nrecording time\nthey thought it was impossible\nfor someone to run a mile in under four\nminutes so\nyears and years and years and years and\nyears people have been running miles no\nperson had ever made it under four\nminutes they thought it was literally\nimpossible physically impossible\nthere were actually doctors that came\nout and said that a human heart would\nactually explode if somebody were to\npush themselves hard enough to run a\nmile in under four minutes so nobody did\nwhy because there were all these people\nthat were in white coats there were\nsupposedly quote unquote professionals\nthey were the doctors they were the ones\nthat quote unquote know it all so of\ncourse we can't do it\nand then so what happens someone comes\nout and says something\nand the mass amount of people in the\nworld go okay i believe that and this\nlimitation was placed on all of mankind\nthat actually paid attention to it\neverybody thought that it was impossible\nexcept for one person\nthere's a guy named roger bannister\nand in 1954 roger bannister ran a mile\nin three minutes\n59.4 seconds the first person ever\nrecorded to run a mile in under four\nminutes\nand what did he do he showed everybody\nthat running a mile under four minutes\nwas possible\nand once people saw it was possible they\nstopped limiting themselves\nso they went oh this is possible that\nmeans i can do it here's the craziest\npart about it\nnobody had ever been recorded running a\nmile under four minutes because they\nthought it was physically impossible the\nhuman heart would explode it was not\ngoing to happen so why would they even\ntry right within two years of roger\nbannister breaking the record and\nrunning a mile under four minutes 300\npeople\nran a mile in under four minutes\nnow let me ask you a question\nwas it in those two years that roger\nbannister\nran the four minute four minute mile\nthat humans just magically evolved they\nbecame a great species they became more\nsuperior they became faster they became\nstronger their their lungs grew to a\nlarger capacity did humans change\nno\nwhat changed\ntheir perceived limitations changed they\nhad the ability the whole time\nbut the problem was their belief that it\nwas not possible was the thing that held\nthem back\nso think about that for a second\nbefore i go any further in this podcast\nepisode how many times\nhave you held yourself back because of\nperceived limitations how many times\nhave you believed something simply\nbecause somebody in a white coat told\nyou that that was the truth how many\ntimes have you listened to someone who's\nolder than you because they said it was\na truth\nright there's another example\nfor all of human history people look up\nin the skies and they'd see birds flying\nand they're like i wish that humans\ncould fly and that was impossible\nuntil the wright brothers proved them\nwrong\npeople thought that putting a man in\nspace was impossible until the russian\npeople put their very first person's\nbase in 1961. people said that it was\nimpossible to land on that big old thing\ncalled the moon\nuntil 1969\nwhen neil armstrong proved them wrong\nand you're telling me\nthat in 1969\nwe successfully sent a rocket ship 238\n900 miles away\nto a rock that's orbiting the earth at\napproximately 2\n288 miles per hour\nand then got them to take off from that\nfreaking moon and land back on the earth\nsafely\nwith something that literally their\ntechnology was nowhere near what you\ncarry in your pocket\nand you can't accomplish your dreams\nreally\ndoes that make sense to you either\nbecause in my head that doesn't make any\nsense\nwhat do all of the the four-minute mile\nthe wright brothers\nrussia neil armstrong what do all of\nthose have in common\none thing\nthey were impossible\nthey were impossible\nand they were only impossible until they\nwere done\nand then once they were done what\nhappened people clicked over and they\nwent oh my god this thing is possible so\ni've got a question for you\nwhat is holding you back from following\nthe life that you really want\nwhat are the limitations the glass\nceilings the perceived limitations that\nyou're placing on yourself the same way\nthat every one of those was a perceived\nlimitation it's just they hadn't figured\nit out yet\nright the four minute mile\nperceived limitation that perceived\nlimitation was people saying that it was\nimpossible physically impossible for a\nhuman to do it until oh actually it's\nnot physically impossible we were wrong\nit's physically impossible going to\nspace oh we were wrong it's physically\nimpossible to get to the room oh we were\nwrong\nright how many times have things people\nbeen oh we were wrong what is the oh\nwe were wrong that still exists in your\nworld right now\nwhat are you telling yourself that is\nnot possible\nwhat limits are you placing on yourself\nthat are completely false what is the\nfalse narrative the conversation that\nyou're having in your head that you're\ntelling yourself all day long as to why\nyou can't create the business that you\nwant to as to why you can't create the\nfamily that you want to as to why you\ncan't create the business that you want\nto as to why you can't be a successful\nartist\nwhat is it what are you afraid of what's\nholding you back what are the perceived\nlimitations that you're placing on\nyourself is it the fear of success\nare you afraid of what would happen if i\nwere to succeed at such a high level\nwhat would be required of me because\nwith success becomes you know there's so\nmany things i have to do\nso many people are afraid of the fear of\nsuccess is it the fear of failure as to\nwhat if i what if i go after this thing\nthat i really want and it doesn't work\nout\nwhat if i go after this thing and people\nmake fun of me when i fall on my face is\nit the fear of uncertainty as i don't\nknow what's out there in the world i\ndon't know what's going to happen to me\nwhen i go for this thing\nis it the fear of making a mistake\nis it the fear of other people's\njudgment is the fear of other people's\nopinions\nis it the fear of disappointing somebody\nelse\nis it a fear of stepping out and\nfollowing your dream and creating this\ndream business because you don't want\nyour parents to come back at you and say\nhey why the hell would you do that we\nspent 60 thousand dollars for you to get\nyour engineering degree\nwhat is it\nare you afraid of disappointing yourself\nare you afraid to bring your light into\nthe world because you feel like you're\nso afraid you know this potential that\nyou have inside of you but if you were\nto bring this potential to the world it\nwould scare the [ __ ] out of you because\nyou don't know what it looks like to\nplay big you only know what it looks\nlike to play small are you making things\nup in your head\nare you taking the safe route\nwhat is it that you're doing are your\ndreams so big\nand so vast that it paralyzes you\nthinking of all of the things that you\nmust do in order to get that\nwhat is it\nare you making up your limits are you\nmaking up your limiting beliefs are you\nmaking up your excuses\nand then once you think of those living\nbeliefs and believe and think of those\nexcuses you're believing them to be\ntruths you're believing those things to\nbe impossible\nare you saying that you don't have\nenough money to do that are you saying\nyou don't have enough time are you\nsaying that you're too lazy are you\nsaying that you don't have a car are you\nsaying that you didn't grow up in the\nright part of town are you saying that\nyou don't have mentors are you saying\nthat you know people from where you're\nfrom don't succeed\nwhat is it what is it what is the bullsh\nthing that you keep telling yourself\nover and over again\nwhat is it\nbecause it's all false see we all have\nnear unlimited ability between us and in\nus but we restrict ourselves in the\npotential that we have because of\nlimitations that we put on ourselves the\nexcuses that we make up as to why we're\nnot living our dreams so that we can\nplay small\nwhy we can't reach our dreams so that we\ncontinue just to sit on the couch and\nplay around on instagram\nbecause i'll tell you what it's a lot\neasier to sit on the couch and just mess\naround on instagram that is to actually\ngo after your dreams\nwhy because you're going to fall on your\nface over and over and over and over\nagain\ngoing for your dreams but guess what's\nthe beautiful thing about it you\neventually will succeed\nthe creator of honda says that success\nis 99 failure\nyou only got to succeed once\nyou've got to look at your limitations\nand say yeah those are false i can see\nhow false those things are we have to\nrise above the limitation we have to\nbreak fear for free from our fears from\nour excuses\nwhen are you going to stop telling\nyourself that you can't\ndo that\nwhen you're going to stop telling\nyourself that something something is\ncompletely impossible\nbecause when we remind ourselves that\nsomething's impossible\nthen we give ourselves an excuse as to\nwhy it does not go for it because once\nagain it's easier not to go for it but\nwe remind ourselves that something is\npossible that it is within our reach\nthat it is going to take more of us is\nit going to demand more from us to get\nthere absolutely but are we going to be\nable to get there for sure\nwhen it comes down to\nyou it's always has always and will\nalways be in your head\nyou're not a battle with anybody else\nyou're not competing against anybody\nelse you're competing against the person\nin the mirror you're competing against\nthe eight inches between your two ears\nthat's all you're competing against it's\nyou it all comes down to you it comes\ndown to your beliefs it comes down to\nyour fears\nyou are the only thing that's holding\nyou back not the government not your\nparents not the degree that you have not\nthe fact that you should go to college\nnot the part of town that you grew up in\nnot the fact that you don't have a car\nnot the fact that you don't have the\nmoney that you don't have the you know\nthat your past is holding you back it's\nnot your current situation it's not the\nfact that you know you don't have the\nright circle of influence it's you it's\nalways been you it will always be you\nand the the second that you realize that\nyou've been externally\nexternalizing all of your excuses and\nyou need to internalize them and put\nthem on yourself you can't blame\nanything else but yourself anymore and\nyou go this is i'm the one to blame as\nto why my reality is the way that it is\nwe need a reprogramming of our minds it\nchanges with the story that we're\ntelling ourselves\nand so i want you to start to think\nabout that what is it that you're doing\nthat's holding yourself back there's one\nthing in this world that i don't want\nyou to be\nthat's realistic\ni don't want you to be realistic do you\nwant to know why\nbecause realistic doesn't exist\nrealistic is fully 100 subjective you\nmake up what is realistic so that\nrealistic thing like\nit's a glass ceiling and what's\ninteresting is as you work harder you\nknow for some people they might be\nlistening it might be your goal to make\na hundred thousand dollars but that's so\nunrealistic for where you are right now\nand i get it that's unrealistic but that\nthat hundred thousand dollars is a glass\nceiling\nit's not a real limitation but it's a\nglass ceiling\nhere's what's interesting about it once\nyou push yourself and push yourself and\npush yourself and you don't pay\nattention to your beliefs and the\nbeautiful thing about about the beliefs\nthat you have is you don't have to\nbelieve in yourself in order to take\naction\nso if you have this glass ceiling that's\nsaying\nnot good enough not good enough i can't\ndo it i can't do it i can't do it but\nyou just work and work and work and work\nand work and you eventually do it you\nbreak through that glass ceiling what\nhappens you create a new glass ceiling\nand you go oh i just made over a hundred\nthousand dollars\nyou probably won't make less than a\nhundred thousand again why because you\nnow have a new belief of what is quote\nunquote realistic for you so last thing\ni want you to do is be realistic because\nthere's no such thing as realistic\na four minute mile once wasn't realistic\ngoing to the moon wasn't realistic all\nof those things weren't realistic you\nknow if you were to go back 200 years\nand be like i'm gonna you know one day\npeople are going to land on that thing\nup in the sky\npeople 200 years ago would be like\nthat's the most ridiculous thing i've\never heard\nwhy\nbecause back then it wasn't realistic\nwhy because it never happened so you\nhave to realize\nall your limitations are put on yourself\nby you no one else\nso i want to leave you with a couple\nquestions to help you kind of dive into\nthis and get a little bit deeper into\nthis so i want you to jot this down get\na pen and paper real quick\nwrite this question down what\nlimitations are you placing on yourself\nwhat are they\nwhat are the limitations you're placing\non yourself write them all down there\nmight be four there might be five there\nmight be 200 i don't know what they are\nwhat are they\nnext question once you ask yourself is\nthis\nwhy are those limitations false\nso instead of looking at the limitations\nand believing them as limitations let's\nflip it on its head\nnow that i'm looking at those\nlimitations\nwhy are those limitations false maybe\nsomeone's like oh yeah i can't be\nsuccessful because of where i grew up\nright and you can say why why is that\nlimitation why is that belief false\nwell because i'm sure there's other\npeople in the world who have come from\nthe part of town that i'm in or\nsomething equivalent to it and succeeded\nand if somebody else has done it that\nmeans i can do it if roger bannister can\nrun a four minute mile i can too\na few hundred people realized that two\nyears after he had ran the mile right so\nwhy are your limitations false why are\nthey not true\nand then last but not least the last\nquestion is how can i overcome these\nlimitations what do i need to do what\nactions do i need to take what systems\ndo i need to set in place what habits do\ni need to create what life do i need to\ncreate how do i need to change my\nenvironment around me so that i can\novercome these limitations as often as\npossible maybe i set up some sort of way\nwhere whenever i start thinking about\nthis limitation what do i do\ni have something else that i do instead\nand i develop a system a routine a habit\naction something that i need to do to\nget myself past the limitation because\nnone of those limitations are real they\nnever happen they never will be\nthe only thing that holds you back from\ncreating the life that you want to is\nyou it always has been it always will be\nbut the beautiful thing about that as\nwell the only thing that will propel you\nforward\ninto creating the life that you want to\nis\nyou so you can either look at your\nlimitations or you can look at your\nopportunities but the choice\nis yours\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well and so\nif you're telling yourself oh yeah but\ni'm just a perfectionist you're full of\nyou are failing at something is better\nthan doing nothing"
