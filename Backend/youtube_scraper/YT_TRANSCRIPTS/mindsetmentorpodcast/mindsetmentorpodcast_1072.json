    "transcript": "there seems to be a war for your mind oh\nmy god i literally physically did not\nfeel good in my body and i was like i\ngotta get out of here as quick as\npossible\ntoday\nwe're gonna talk about the war for your\nmind that is currently going on\nand i want to tell you a real quick\nstory of kind of how this became\nsomething that i was aware of so uh the\nother day last week i was in the paint\nstore and i don't watch the news i don't\nwatch tv i don't even have you know any\ntv stations that could come in got\nnetflix and youtube that's basically all\ni watch on my tv in my house\nand i was inside of the paint store and\ni won't tell you what station it was on\nor any of this stuff but\nwhat it was on was it was on a very\npopular talk show\ni won't tell you which one it is and it\nhappened to be on a station that the\ntalk show was talking about a lot of\nthings that were very politicized and\nevery time it would go to the the\ncommercials the commercials would have a\nnews flash like little break that would\nhappen and it was another thing that was\ngoing on right\nand what i became aware of in this\nmoment obviously i've known it but to be\nable to actually see it\ni was in there for about three to four\nminutes and i was like i wonder what\nthey're actually going to be talking\nabout\nand it was so blatantly obvious to me\nthat\nthis station was trying to push their\npropaganda to make you think and feel a\ncertain way now i'm not saying what\nstation was any of those things what\ni'll tell you is no matter what side it\nis whether it's the left or the right\nwhatever it is they are trying to have a\nwar for your mind by throwing out\npropaganda in things and making the\nworld seem a lot worse than it actually\nis\nright and within three to four minutes\nof being in there i became very\nuncomfortable because i was like i can\nliterally\nfeel\nhow other people\nthat don't know this is going on can\nthink that the world is absolutely\nterrible right now think that the world\nis absolutely going to [ __ ] to think\nthat there's so much to be afraid of and\ni've got to pick a side of what side i'm\non you know i've got to be on this side\nand when i pick a side this is important\nto know when i pick a quote unquote side\nthat puts me on one side which means\nthat there is always an enemy which is\nthe other side right and it was so\nobvious that this one side was trying to\npush their agenda and push their injen\nand push their agenda into somebody who\nis not aware of what is going on\nthey are going to be extremely easily\ninfluenced into number one\nthinking the way this side thinks number\ntwo\nseeing that there was a side that is\nagainst them that they need to be\nfearful of and number three think that\nthis world is going to absolute crap so\nthere's a couple things i want to pack\nout you know pull out of that and unpack\nthe first thing\nwhy is the news so negative and i i've\ndone episodes on this before in the past\nthe news is so negative because as a\nhuman our brains naturally go towards\nwhat is negative aka what is wrong why\nis that important because 10 20 30 100\n000 years ago when we focused on what\nwas wrong we were able to fix it which\nthen meant that we would stay alive\nbecause what was wrong a hundred\nthousand years ago could mean death if\nwe don't fix it so now\nwhat happens is the news in this media\nnot even just the news now it's also\njust the media these stations then they\ndisguise them as talk shows they\ndisguise them as tv stations they\ndisguise them as all of these different\nshows they put out there\nare out there putting fear and fear and\nfear and fear and fear into people and\nthe reason why is because when you're\nfearful you're going to watch more\nbecause you want to find the solution to\nthis problem and the more that you watch\nthese stations the more money that\nthey're going to make off of ad revenue\nif you watch them\nyou're going they're going to get more\nad revenue the more millions of people\nthat watch their shows\ntheir tv stations their news stations\ntheir\nyou know talk shows all of those things\nthe more people that watch them\nwell they're gonna make more money so\nthat's the first thing\nso you've got to be very clear as to\nwhat you're watching and to be very\nclear is this something that is\nsupporting\nme growing into the person that i want\nto be or is this something that's\nactually holding me back and keeping me\nin a fearful state just simple way to\ndiagnose just ask yourself this question\nwhat i'm feeling what i'm watching right\nnow how does it make me feel\nright if you're watching tv and the news\nhappens to pop up and you say how does\nthis make me feel and you're like i feel\nreally worried i feel very fearful and i\ndon't feel very positive about the\ndirection of the world\nturn it off like get it off as soon as\npossible because that's not helping you\ncreate the life that you want that's\nholding you back that's keeping you\nparalyzed that's immobilizing you versus\nmobilizing you towards what is that you\nwant to create\nright so the first thing to be very\naware of is that they are putting fear\ninto every person that's out there\nbecause it's an easy way to control\nthe second thing that you have to\nrealize is this and i'm once again\nbefore i go any further i'm not saying\nthat the world doesn't have problems the\nworld definitely has problems and the\nworld will always have some problems in\nsome sort of way there's 7.5 billion\npeople on this planet are there a few\nbad apples out there there are a few\nkooky people that are off the rails\nabsolutely there will never be nothing\nbad i don't believe that will ever get\nto that point what i'm saying is it is\nseems way worse than it actually is\nbased off of number one all of the\ncameras now exist in the world because\neverybody's got a camera inside their\npocket and number two how it can be\npushed over and over and over again\nthrough every platform through the news\nthrough social media through everything\nthat you could possibly see\nso are are\nis the world perfect no will it ever be\nno but it's nowhere near as bad as they\nmake it seem right so that's the first\nthing to to be very aware of the second\nthing as to why\nwould the media i don't even just say\nthe news anymore why would the media the\nstuff you see on tv\ntalk shows all of these things\nwhy would they put so much negativity\nand so much fear-based stuff out there\nreason why is because the easiest way to\ncontrol people\nis through fear guilt and shame\nhe said again the easiest way to control\nsomebody is fear guilt and shame think\nabout what's been going on the past year\nand how much fear guilt and shame has\nbeen put out into the media it is\ncrazy\nhow much has been put out there right\nand i'm not talking about any side i\ndon't i'm not part of any side just so\nyou guys know i don't believe in any\nspecific side i don't think that there\nis a side to just go for\nbut when somebody picks a side\nas i said earlier once you pick a side\nyou now have a side that you're against\nright if i'm rooting for one basketball\nteam if i'm watching a game and the\nmiami heat are playing and i'm a heat\nfan\nthey're playing another team that other\nteam i want to lose\nso if i'm on one side\nwhether that's the left or the right or\nwhatever it is that people believe in at\nthis point\ni want the other side to lose\nand when i want the other side to lose\ni'm losing and the reason why is because\nwhen you can when we're split up and\ndivided\nit's the phrase that we've all heard\nunited we stand divided we fall if we\ndivide as humans we are easy to control\nwe are easy\ni don't have a side\nright i don't i don't have a specific\nside that's that that\n[Music]\nthat i believe in or that i think is\nright or wrong i think there's different\nsides of both of them but there's\nanother thing that also is very\nimportant as well that people don't take\ninto account is that you're seeing the\nworld through your lens of the world\nbased off of everything that has\nhappened to you in your past\nright\nyou're seeing the world you think the\nway that you think you believe what you\nbelieve based off of the way that you\nwere raised and circumstances that were\npresented to you in your life\nlet me say that again you think the way\nthat you think and you believe what you\nbelieve based off of the way that you\nare raised and circumstances that life\npresented you with\nso someone who doesn't believe the exact\nsame thing that you believe\nand think the exact same way that you\nthink\nis because of the way they were raised\nin the circumstances that life presented\nthem with so it's very important to\nrealize who's to say\nthat if instead of having your life you\nhad their life that you wouldn't think\nexactly the same as them\nso what i want you to realize is that we\nneed to stop looking at other people and\nsaying that's the enemy i'm different\nthan them this is my side that's another\nside the only thing that we should be\ndoing at this point\nis focusing on how we can love the other\npeople now this is really interesting\nbecause i put up a video on instagram\ntalking with us the other day\nand most people were in full agreement\nyes we need to figure out a way to love\nmore to love more to love more because\nthe opposite of love is fear think about\nhow much if i don't like the other side\nwhatever that side is it's coming from a\nplace of fear right love is the only\nthing that's going to get us through all\nof this\nright there is no other way\nbattling and picking sides will not\nsolve our problems look at our\ngovernment if you're in the united\nstates all they do is just bicker like a\nbunch of little children right oh\nthere's this side there's this side\nthere's battling all they're doing\nthere's no love at all in all of that\nright\nclosing off will not solve our problems\nthere is no other side that you can be\non the only side that you can be on\nright now or ever is human you are a\nhuman no matter where you're from no\nmatter what you look like no matter what\nyou believe in no matter any of those\nstuff none of those things matter what\nyou are is you're a human and everybody\nelse that's on this planet all 7.5\nbillion of them are human as well when\nwe are divided we are easily conquered\nif you look around and you don't see the\nthings in this world that you currently\nif there's certain aspects of this world\nthat you don't like i completely\nunderstand that but fighting is not\ngoing to create something better what's\ngoing to create something better\nfiguring out a way to love more\nright to unite not to divide when people\nare united is when things happen\nbut when we say that's evil this\nperson's evil that side's evil what\nhappens we get divided and when you\ndivide\nnothing's going to actually happen\nnothing good is going to hap actually\nhappen look at look at look at the past\nhundred years of how much division has\nhappened in the past 100 200 years right\ndoes it look like it's going in the\nright direction well probably not if you\nwatch the news it looks like it's going\nin the wrong direction really fast\nactually right\nbut anything that you've tried to do in\nthe past and and put somebody into a box\nand anything that's happened that's put\nsomebody into a box of this is what you\nbelieve this is what i believe is what\nthey believe\ndivides people and when you are divided\nyou are easily conquered\nso what we need to do is figure out a\nway to love more\nlet me give you an example of what i\nmean\nas i said a few minutes ago\npeople believe what they believe and\nthey think what they think based off of\nwhat has happened to them in their past\nwhat life has brought to them in what\nthey were taught\nright\nso i might look at somebody and say you\nknow what i don't necessarily believe\nthe exact same things that they believe\nbut\ndoes that mean i can't love them\nor find some sort of love for them\nit might be hard sometimes but it\ndoesn't mean it's impossible it means\nit's something that we got to work\ntowards right so you look and you've\nheard the phrase love your neighbor\nright love your neighbor love your\nneighbor\nwhen we're divided nothing's going to\nhappen that's going to be going to be\ngood but when we unite and we can work\nthrough our problems we can work through\nthings that are going on that's when\nthings actually that's when things\nactually start to change\nright so if i look at somebody and i say\nokay\nthis person\ni don't agree with much of what they\nsaid\nactually i don't agree with most of what\nthey say\nbut\ni didn't have their life i didn't have\nthem cir their circumstances i didn't\nhave any of the things that they had so\nif i was in their exact same shoes and i\nwent through the exact same life that\nthey had would i think the same as them\nand there's a possibility that i would\nwhich means\nthat how can i say i'm better than them\nand then my opinion and my my stance is\nbetter than them i can look at them and\ni can say you know what i don't agree\nwith them not 100\nthere's some things that we definitely\non other sides but i can love them\neither way why can i love them because\nnumber one\ni'm an empathetic person we all have\nempathy and we can always be empathetic\ntowards other people what they've been\nthrough in their lives\nright\nnumber two if i want things to actually\nchange\ni need to be able to look at someone who\ndoesn't agree the same things as me and\nsay i can still love them through this i\ncan figure out a way to to for us to\nwork together that's the only way that\nthis is going to work then i could say\nokay if i go come from a place of love\nwhen i go and speak to this person\nthey're more receptive to listening to\nme into listening to my side if i go\nfrom a place of hate in a place of anger\nthey are way less likely to listen to me\nand what they can do they're going to\nbuild up their walls and they're going\nto push their side further so if we\nreally want to have an intelligent\nintellectual you know adult conversation\nmaybe i should come from a place of love\nfirst and not a place from division and\nhatred towards them come from a place of\nlove and that would make them more\nreceptive to actually listening to what\nit is that i have to say\nmaybe\nthat's a way that we can actually get\nthem to change\nbecause if what they've been taught and\nwhat they what life has presented them\nwith what if i come from a place of love\nand present them with a different option\nand present them with something\ndifferent maybe then that would change\nthem in some sort maybe it wouldn't but\nin reality i know that if we come from a\nplace of love and everything that we do\nlife is going to be a lot better and\nthat's the thing that the world is\nmissing so what i want you to realize is\nthat right now there seems to be a war\nfor your mind\nyou're in control of all of the things\nthat you watch all of the things that\nyou listen to all of the people that you\nhang out with the music that you listen\nto the media that you consume whether\nthat's visually auditorily the people\nthat you hang out with\nyou know you're in control of all of\nthose things and all of those things\nbrainwash you in some sort of way the\nquestion is is it brainwashing you to\nbecome the person that you want to\nbecome or is it brainwashing you to hold\nyou back and not get you to move forward\nright all i know is that when i walked\ninto that paint store and i saw those\nthree to four minutes i was like oh my\ngod i literally physically did not feel\ngood in my body and i was like i gotta\nget out of here as quick as possible\nbecause number one i could see what it\nwas doing to me and number two i could\nsee what it's doing to other people who\naren't necessarily paying attention and\nwho don't have this knowledge as well so\njust be\nnumber one come from a place of love be\nvery loving in everything that you do\nand number two\nrealize you're in control of the\ninformation that comes into your head\nbe in control of it be very diligent\nabout what you allowed to come into your\nhead number three\nlook at everyone else around you and\nrealize that if i pick a side and if i\nbecome divisive we're easily conquered\nthe only way that we're going to change\nthis world into becoming the world that\nwe want to be is we have to first become\nthat change if we want people to get\nalong more than they're getting along\nnow we need to first be the people who\nstart getting along with people if we\nwant people people to be more loving we\nneed to first be the people that are\nmore loving\ngandhi said it\nstill makes sense be the change you want\nto see in the world what do you need to\ndo and change within yourself to be the\nchange that you want to see in the world\nwhat change do you want to see in the\nworld and how can you take that and put\nit inside of you\nthere's a war for your mind going on\nbe in control of what's actually coming\ninto your head be in control of every\nthought that you think every action that\nyou take and come from a place of love\nin every single thing that you do and i\npromise you that'll be the first step\ntowards a better world\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well\ntypically the people who follow me tend\nto be more optimistic versus pessimistic\n78\nof the people who follow me think that\nthe world is\nyeah i was super surprised by that"
