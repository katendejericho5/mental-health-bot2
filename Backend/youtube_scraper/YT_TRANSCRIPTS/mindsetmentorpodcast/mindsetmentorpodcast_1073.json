    "transcript": "what do you find are the most common\nsoftwares that you reinstall for the\naging process the way to think of the\nbody is that there's two types of\ninformation uh one is the dna which we\nall know the other part of the\ninformation the other type in our body\nunfortunately is analog not the genetic\nbut the epigenetic information and\nthat's the part that i believe\ngets corrupted most rapidly\nare you\none of the world's leading experts in\naging or are you the leading expert in\nthe world on aging at this point\noh that's a pretty tough question to\nanswer i'm definitely not the leading\nthere are hundreds of people who work on\nthis topic yeah\nas interesting as that is um\nyou know i've been working at this for\nnow 30\nyears almost\nso you know if i don't have a reputation\nyet i've done something wrong but you\nknow i'm not going to say i'm the\nleading guy i'm probably one of the most\nwell known\nbecause i've been brave enough to go out\nin public and talk about it since i was\nin my 30s even 20s and my book that came\nout that's also been uh successful but\nyeah i i am not gonna stand up and say i\nam the greatest uh you know i'm not a\nmuhammad ali kind of guy i'm australian\noriginally and australians definitely\ndon't stick their head up above the\npoppy field tall poppy syndrome exactly\nright cut off\nyeah uh i know a lot about that because\nwe have a a lot of australians that\nlisten to us that happen to be the the\nnumber one business podcast in all of\naustralia and i was like i don't even\nknow how all the australians found me so\nit's uh that's pretty amazing but the\nthing i love about your book and\neverything that you talk about is you\ntake age an aging process and actually\nkind of flip it on its head and think\ndifferently about it but before we dive\ninto that specifically when you look at\naging we think it's just something that\nwe do it's we're just it's something\nthat we're gonna it's gonna happen no\nmatter what but um i'm curious from the\nway that you your perspective the way\nthat you describe it why is it that\nhumans actually age\nwell first of all let's just get\nsomething straight just because\nsomething happens and it's natural\ndoesn't mean it's good\n200 years ago we thought\nyou get cancer your home pack your stuff\nand can't do much about it but you\ndevelop medicines and you you try to\nstop pain and suffering\num so that you know i regard aging as a\ndisease one that's treatable um and that\nmindset is very important here\nwhat is aging well people have been\ntrying to figure that out since before\nthe pyramids or even you know first\nblock laid down there\nso we don't know 100 but what i put\nforth in my book is a new theory that\nhas become one of the hottest theories\nin the field and that's the idea that\nit's not just things going wrong\nwilly-nilly there's if you boil it down\nactually you can make it into a\nmathematical equation it's a loss of\ninformation\nand i think it's it's the good a good\ntime and the reason that it's being\nreceived well is because we live in an\ninformation age 50 years ago people\ndidn't really understand what that meant\nbut today we can understand that if the\nbody's like\na computer\nand the drives get corrupted\nor the chips get corrupted and slow down\nthat's aging um and that what i think we\ncan do is to reboot the system and\nreinstall new software and get it to\nwork really well\nand that's what we're working in\nuh on in my lab which is to reinstall\nsoftware into body parts\nand we're finding that those body parts\nbecome young again literally and work\nagain like they were young yeah and so\nwhat what do you find are the most\ncommon softwares that you reinstall for\nthe aging process\nyeah well you know if you want a biology\nlesson uh you can read my book i'm not\ngoing to go too much into it but\nthe way to think of the body is that\nthere's two types of information uh one\nis the dna which we all know that's a\ndigital form of information very robust\nit's the reason we can talk uh through\nthe internet\nthe other part of the information you\nknow the type in our body unfortunately\nis analog\nyou know records\ncassette tapes this is not the kind of\ninformation that lasts for a long time\nand we call that the not the genetic but\nthe epigenetic information and that's\nthe part that i believe\ngets corrupted most rapidly now the good\nnews is though\nlet me switch analogies it's not the\nbest but\num probably everyone knows what a cd is\nat this point\nuh the the music on a cd or the photos\nthat's digital information but if you\nscratch the cd that's like aging the\nepigenome the reading of the information\nis is messed up you can't read it so\nsongs skip and in the body the\nequivalent is that the genes that should\nbe on and off in each part of the body\nyou know your brain has to have a\ndifferent set of genes\non compared to your your liver because\notherwise the cells are going to be\nthe same we all have the same dna in our\ncells\nso now that now that hopefully you\nunderstand what i think is going on the\nscratches on the cd we've been looking\nto polish\nthe cd so that's you know different\nanalogy but\none that i think is apt and what we do\nis we we use gene therapy at this point\nwe turn on three particular genes that\nare normally only turned on in embryos\nto develop a very robust healthy\nchild\nwe turn them on in adult animals so\nwe're taking mice\nthey're old they can't see\nthey're blind and we put those three\ngenes into the back of the eye we turn\nthem on for three four or five weeks we\ncan go as long as we want\nand the eyes\nthey go back in time the retina the\noptic nerves literally become young they\ndon't just get healthier we measure\ntheir age we can measure that\nwe can measure the scratches and when\nthey're young they get their eyesight\nback fully\nfirst time that's been done to actually\nreverse aging we think that we can\ndo that probably in in many other\ntissues we're working on hearing\nuh loss um some early results we're\ngonna\nwork on uh other parts of the body so\nspleen liver and the most exciting part\nuh the one that keeps me up at night is\nwhole body rejuvenation\nimagine a world where you either take a\npill or a gene therapy\nyou fill your body with these three\nembryonic genes and then you take\nan antibiotic or some drug that turns it\non that's how we do it in the mice we\ngive them a doxycycline to turn it on\nand then your doctor\nmonitors you\nokay you've gone back far enough in age\nand i'm 51\nthree weeks later okay david you've gone\nback to 35 do you want to keep going\nyeah give me another 10 years go back\nstop it you don't want to go too far\nand then you know you arrange another\nvisit\n20 years later so that that's what we're\ntalking about\ntheoretically though it's early days\nbecause we're still in mice\ninteresting so\ni know that i hear i've heard bruce\nlipton talk a lot about epigenetics and\nhe talks about how\nthe dna matters but in some cases it\nseems like the epigenetics matter\nsometimes even more where it's it and\nthe way i get i guess he explains\nepigenetics is it's kind of like you\nhave the dna and you have the genes but\nepigenetics is kind of the environment\nthat it is and if you change the\nenvironment it could be healthier for\nthe cancers for it but you're talking\nabout not just changing the environment\nbut also taking\nnew cells and new stuff and putting it\ninto it directly right\nyeah that's that's essentially the the\nright thing to to\nimagine but but it's a little bit\nbetter than that more exciting what\nwe've discovered is\nmy colleagues and i is that the\ninformation to be young the dna is\nlargely intact in our body we didn't\nrealize that\nso the hardware is all there the\ninformation the main information digital\nis there it just doesn't get used\nand what that means is that we can tap\ninto it that aging is far more\nreversible\nthan we ever thought and this epigenome\nhas become one of the hottest things in\nbiology right now because you're right\nit is affected by how we live\nand\nyou know when you are overweight you\ndon't exercise\nyou spend 20 20 sitting in a chair like\na lot of us did\nthat affects your epi genome\nand\nin good and bad ways there are longevity\ngenes that we study\nthat if you have a sedentary lifestyle\ndon't eat the right foods\nthose longevity genes get switched off\nand they don't protect your body\nconversely\nuh you know you don't smoke you you\nexercise you eat re rarely i skip a meal\nat least a day then the longevity genes\ncome on\nand protect your body and stop those and\nslow down those scratches from occurring\nbut here's one thing most people don't\nrealize we tend to think\nour dna is our destiny that's totally\nwrong when it comes to aging and we know\nthis from studying tens of thousands of\npeople measuring their clock over time\nyou 80 of what you experience in aging\ndepends on how you live your life and\nonly 20\nis your dna from your parents and that\nreally is motivational it should be to\ndo all the right things\nyeah\nyeah i saw a study that that came out a\ncouple days ago and and they were\ntalking about covenant they said that\nobviously the number one thing that's\nkilling people is is age but the second\nthing seems like that that the factors\nfrom obesity seem to be as well so it\nlooks like age you know it's funny\nbecause in the article it says age is\nsomething that you can't do anything\nabout looks like you would definitely\nwant to go into debate about that\nand on the other side it then talks\nabout obesity and there's all the stuff\nthat comes from that diabetes um you\nknow cardiovascular issues as well so it\nseems like the actual two biggest issues\nnow talking to you actually can be\nworked through to actually help people\nbe healthier boost your immune system\nand actually be able to fight it better\nit seems\nwell they're inextricably linked\nobesity heart disease alzheimer's\nuh even cancer these are manifestations\nof aging\nand\nlet's talk about obesity just for a\nsecond\nuh it's known that the clock of aging\nticks faster if you're overweight\nright\nand so it's not that obesity\nis just the problem it's that your\nobesity is accelerating your aging and\nthat's why obesity causes a whole range\nof diseases including cancer your body\nclock is ticking so if you can\nlose that weight and your body clock\nwill slow\nuh down\nbut the other thing to think about is\nwhat is the root cause of most suffering\non the planet what is the root cause of\ndisease\nwell\nwe know that\nfor cancer for example\nthe majority of the risk for cancer is\naging the processes that drive aging we\nforget about that we try to treat cancer\nafter it occurs we forget about the\npreceding 50 years that lead up to that\ntypically and you can have a big\ndifference on your cancer rates i'll\ngive you one example so my mother\ndied of lung cancer\nshe smoked which accelerated her clock\nit mutated her dna as well which was not\nhelpful\nbut her risk of getting cancer because\nof smoking went up five-fold above the\naverage person\nwhereas going from age 20 to 70\nincreases your risk more than 200 fold\nso which is more important to work on\nsmoking or cancer well i'd say do both\nbut we ignore the major cause of cancer\nin the world\nyeah which is people's environment what\nthey put in their body how they take\ncare of themselves and one of the things\nthat you said that i put down that i was\nreally interested on which i haven't\nheard you speak a whole lot about is\njust the just being sedentary and just\nsitting all the time like that's one of\nthe things that i'm i'm\ngetting better at is every hour trying\nto get up and move in some sort of way\nand you know the thing that i've already\nexplained is like sitting is basically\nthe new cancer\nwhat is what is the issue with sitting\nso much and how do you see that\nhappening in affecting the aging process\nwell i had personal experience of that\nwhen i wrote my book uh which\ntook 10 years but i was literally\nsitting for about 18 months every day\nand night\ni ended up suffering\nmy health went um\ni could barely walk because my\npiriformis muscle atrophied and then\nseized up it was in a cramp for six\nmonths and that's the muscle that that\ngoes through that hole in your pelvis\num and it took me six months of exercise\nand therapy to get back to walking again\nso i've switched over to having a\nstanding desk uh it's right next to me\njust here i go on a lot of walks so why\nwhy is sitting so bad well first of all\nyour heart rate doesn't go up you're\nbasically a minimal\nbasal heart rate which is bad second of\nall if your major muscles atrophy\nyou're that if you're a man you can have\nless testosterone but even for women\nthat lack of muscle bulk\nis super bad not just because your your\nhormones are diminished but particularly\nthose people who are my age and older if\nyou have weak muscles it's super bad\nbecause hey it's very hard to get them\nback\ni took me a lot of work and it's harder\nthe older you get\nbut the number one or maybe one of the\ntop five not number one but one of the\nmajor causes preventable causes of death\nis falling over and breaking\nyour leg or your hip and you've got to\nkeep those muscles\nthat are required for standing\nuh really strong so that if you fall you\ndon't break you just bounce\nyeah it's it seems like you know one of\nthe things that that\nthat's happening is people are getting\ntoo comfortable it seems right we're\nstaying inside you know inside of my\nhouse it's at 72 degrees all the time i\ncan sit most of the day and do all that\nbut then also the same time it's like\nyou know if you think about it\nwe don't put our body through enough\nstress and you know i live in austin we\nhad this i don't know if you heard about\nthe whole snowpocalypse thing where it's\njust like crazy so our ancestors would\nhave been outside in that there would\nhave been massive amounts of stress of\ngoing down to five degrees and all that\nbut you know the thing that i'm i'm\ncurious of and that i like to do is i\nlike to to kind of seek discomfort like\ni i i love\nthere's a lot of and i don't even really\ndo it i guess for the body effects i\nactually do it more for the mindset\neffects but like really pushing myself\nand doing something that's uncomfortable\num one of the things there's a couple\nthings i want to dive into with you on\nit but one of the things is actually\nintermittent fasting which i know you\ntalk a lot about um i'm really curious\nwith what type of fasting people should\ndo you said that you normally skip one\nto two meals what that looks like\nand then also long-term fasting one day\ntwo days three days because if people\nhave done research they talk about you\nknow when you go three days or so it\nseems like your body starts to clear out\nold dead cells and create new ones so um\ni'd really love to dive into fasting\nlong term and also intermittent fasting\nas well\nexactly so this is the concept that's\nmost important uh and always keep in\nyour mind that your body isn't healthy\nif it come if it's comfortable our mind\nwants to be comfortable we want to sit\nand watch tv\nand eat popcorn that's that's very\nenjoyable but if you always do that\nyour your mind and particularly your\nbody will will atrophy so you do need to\npush it you need to be uncomfortable at\nleast part of the time and then you\nrecover\nhey did you know that mono tasking is\nbetter for mental performance than\nmultitasking or that simply cleaning\nyour kitchen can reduce excessive\nsnacking and listening to happier music\ncan help you think more creatively these\nare just a few of the fascinating things\nthat i've picked up while watching\noutsmart yourself brain-based strategies\nfor a better you not only am i learning\nsomething new

uh losing\nyour breath is great being hungry once\nin a while is great being hot in a sauna\nhas benefits even being cold we think\ncan help we call these these concepts\nwell overall they they're called\nhormesis h-o-r-m-e-s\num i mean sis and the idea is that our\nbodies need a little bit of perceived\nadversity think of it this way uh what\ndoesn't kill you makes you stronger and\nwhat's happening we've discovered comes\nback to these longevity genes that i\nmentioned earlier we work on a set of\nseven genes called sirtuins there are\nothers but these ones control\nthe scratches and they control your\nbody's energy and fat content your brain\nalzheimer's even how fast that\nprogresses\nand here's the key thing when you\nexercise when you're hungry\nthese genes come on they protect the\nbody they give you longer life we think\nand certainly health increased health\nbut when you're sitting down you don't\ndo any of that stuff they just say hey\ntimes are good we don't need to work\nhard your body will not protect itself\nunless it actually thinks there's a\nthreat to survival so that's hormesis\nand it's super important\nso is that is the hormesis the longevity\ngene that you're speaking of\nwell hermes is the concept of keep your\nbody in a stressed state every day once\nin a while but actually getting to your\npoint rob about\nbeing hungry in particular\num i've always tried to keep a lean\nweight i just have known that that's\nhealthier so i've tried to do that\nbut i thought that eating small meals\nduring the day was the way to go because\nthat's what nutritionists have said for\nat least most of the 20th century\ni don't believe that anymore i think\nthat the idea that you should always be\nsatisfied and have snacks in between\nmeals\nis wrong i mean certainly not not wrong\nfor teenagers we don't want malnutrition\nor starvation heaven forbid but what\nwe're talking about is people\n30 40 50 and beyond where metabolism's\nstarting to slow down you're already\ngaining weight if you eat three meals a\nday you don't want to do that\nso i skip breakfast i often skip lunch i\nhave a normal dinner\nuh healthy grains and maybe a bit of\nmeat um i've recently switched uh to\njust fishes meat to see how that goes\nbut what's important is when you've got\nthat hunger state um and now you call it\nhunger but i'm really never hungry i'm\nused to this after two weeks you don't\nfeel hungry\ni'm drinking tea and coffee in the\nmorning it feels great actually i feel\nmuch better than being bloated what's\ngoing on at the cellular level is a lot\nthose longevity genes come on and they\nturn on a process\nin particular called autophagy you might\ncall it autophagy depending on where you\nlive and that is the process that\ngrabs the old old proteins in the cell\nand digests them we have a lot of old\nproteins that sit around and don't do a\nlot of good in fact in the case of\nalzheimer's disease\nthat's the reason we get alzheimer's\ndisease a lot of misfolded old proteins\none called a beta for example\nand our bodies need to chew those up to\nstay young and healthy and a a really\ngood friend of mine and colleague down\nat albert einstein culture medicine\nher name is maria ana cuervo or anna\nmarie\nyou should look her up if you're curious\nshe's the star of this and she's\ndiscovered a type of autophagy that\nhappens when you go hungry for three or\nmore days\nand it's called chaperone-mediated\nautophagy and that's the deep cleanse\nthat grabs all of the really bad\nproteins and old ones that have\ncrystallized and formed these tight uh\nbundles that are very hard to get rid of\num and just choose them up\nand she has new work uh i think it's\ncoming out in the next few weeks\nactually\nshe just had a nature paper now she's\ncoming out with another big paper that\nsays if you turn this process on in a\nmouse it lives dramatically longer um\ni i think it was at least 20 longer and\nthey're healthier they look great\nyou look at a mouse that's got this and\nit's shiny and black coat and the other\nones are gray and can barely walk it's\nhuge and right now the only way to\nstimulate that process\nis to go hungry or skip meals i should\nsay well um but we're developing i'm\nworking with anna maria\non a medicine that would give you know\npatients that kind of feeling so that\nolder people sick people people in\nhospital you know obviously wouldn't\nhave to\nuh fast for three or more days that's\nnot necessarily what you want to have if\nyou're recovering from a disease\nbut here's the point you can induce\nhormesis with a pill and that's what a\nlot of my companies work on\ninteresting so\nis there a fast that it's too long\nbecause i've sat with a doctor before\nwho said you know i was talking about\nthinking about doing a 10-day water fast\nand he's like well at that point in time\nit actually starts to be you know you go\nyou're going so far that you're actually\nstarting to do harm to your body so is\nit three four five days it tends to be\nperfect to go into this homesis and then\num\nyou know is there is is it is three days\nthe the amount of time that we at least\nwant to go to to get into that state\nlike what is what is the the typical\namount of time that you guys recommend\nyeah well well there's two mistakes in\nin your sentences unfortunately uh rob\none could probably be a lot more without\nthe rest of the interview no it's\ntotally inadvertent i'm being a bit\nfacetious uh we don't recommend stuff i\ndefinitely don't recommend stuff okay i\ncan tell you scientifically what's known\nright and then the other mistake was we\nactually don't know we're on the cusp of\nlearning this but\nuh we know that three days is good is\nfive days optimal or do you start to\nlose muscle mass too much\nand uh doctors like peter atia attia\ngood friend of mine he's\nself-experimenting he's got some\npatience but we really don't know we\nneed more clinical trials to know that\num i would i would say that what i do\nis harmless three days probably all good\nfive days i would start to think that\nany more than that would start to take\naway muscle mass and you don't want to\ndo that\nyeah\nso um you know\none of the things that i've i hear a lot\nof people talk about and skin like it's\nbeen very prevalent is you know\nneurodegenerative diseases which you\nkind of spoke about for a second\nalzheimer's and dementia my girlfriend\nboth of her grandparents on her\ndad's side um had either dement or\nalzheimer's as well and that's one thing\nthat she worries about for herself and\nthen also for her father so\nwhen you're saying these people don't go\ninto this if i understand it correctly\nwhen they don't go into hormesis\nbasically they have old proteins and\ncells that are still inside of the body\nthat the body hasn't flushed out\nis that what turns into the amyloid\nplaques that then destroy\nthe actual brain itself or is that\nsomething that's separate and then in\nthat case where somebody knows they have\nsomething because there's a lot of\npeople that have somebody that had a\nneurodegenerative disease in their\nfamily um obviously we can't recommend\nbut the science what does it say is best\nfor that person knowing that that\npossibly you know come down the line for\nthem\nall right well first the diet then the\nscience uh so the diet i'm working with\nuh dean ornish you might have heard of\nthe ornish diet so dean and i are\nwith another five other scientists\nrunning in a clinical trial on\nalzheimer's patients\nand so far seeing dramatic results now\nhis diet\nis lower on calories and focusing on\nplants\num and just really healthy food\nand it seems to be working now we'll\npublish this and we'll do more patience\nand get more data but i think that\nthat's the right approach is what he's\nsaying so if you want to look up the\nornish diet\ni'd recommend doing that\no-n-o-r-n-i-s-h\nuh now the science now there are\nmisfolded proteins that\naccumulate in your brain from these\nlittle crystals uh a beta i mentioned is\none alpha-synuclein is is another and\nthey're very hard to clear it's thought\nthat actually\nyour body just cannot get rid of these\ncrystals and you find them inside the\ncell\num and very much so outside the cell now\nthere's been a lot of debate which is\nthe worst form\num i think it's it's clear that\nsome of these are bad for you no doubt\nbecause there's some therapies based on\nthe clearance of these proteins outside\nthe cell using antibodies and they're\nstarting to see some pretty promising\nresults\nbut i'll tell you my view is that it's\nfar easier to prevent them than to try\nto reverse them and this is why it\nfrustrates me that\nvery few doctors focus on what you can\ndo\nleading up to\nactually getting getting the disease and\nthat's not just true for alzheimer's\ndisease it's true for everything right\nand i think doctors because their\ntraining has been on we only treat\ndiseases we're not preventative\nyou know\nmedicine doctors that's for the kooks we\nneed to change that attitude i mean how\nmany people's doctors spend half of the\ntime with their patient talking about\nlifestyle\nwhich i would say especially in midlife\nis far more important than worrying\nabout you know what kind of flu you\nmight be catching\nyeah\nyeah i'm curious also with that as well\num one of the things that i literally\njust got delivered yesterday it's in my\ngarage is\na sauna so a traditional sauna and um\nalso i do cold plunge therapy and\nusually i put a you know i talk about\nall the time just for the the mental\nbenefits of pushing myself and doing it\nand now it seems like they're starting\nto you know wim hof is starting to go\nviral and people are loving all this\nstuff and people are looking into it um\nwhen you look at the the hot cold\ntherapy heat shock proteins all those\ntypes of things that come out when you\ndo this what are the benefits with hot\nand cold therapy um that that you're\nnoticing and also what do you recommend\nfor people who\nmight decide to buy a son or might\ndecide to start doing cold plunges is\nthere too much is there's too little\nthat you find\nuh well again we're on the cutting edge\nand wim hof is right on the bleeding\nedge\nuh the science says that\nyeah turning on heat shock proteins\nuh and and hot temperature saunas in\ngeneral do seem to have long-term\nbenefits on health there are some\nstudies that i\nhave referenced in my book which people\ncan go to to get more detail but\ntypically it's in finland where pretty\nmuch every house seems to have a sauna\nif you look at people who do a lot of\nsauna bathing they are protected i think\nit was 30 less chance of heart\nhaving a heart attack late in life\nso those studies are convincing actually\ni was surprised how convincing the data\nis exactly how they work we don't know\nit might also involve the turning on of\nthese longevity genes due to hermesis\nthe cold therapy is actually less known\nabout but the best explanation i can\ngive right now is that there are\nlongevity genes that respond to cold not\njust hot\nthe sirtuin genes that i work on there's\nthere's one called number three so two\nand three that comes on during cold and\nit's really healthy it turns on the\nbody's brown fat processes and burns\nenergy revs up the mitochondria the\nbattery packs in the cell and brown fat\nwhich we didn't even know existed 20\nyears ago in adults it's usually baby\nfat babies cannot shiver they have to\nuse brown fat to get warm\nbut adults can build up particularly on\nthe back um in other regions it depends\non how old you are and who you are but\nbeing cold\ni bet you that wim hof has a ton of\nbrown fat and that keeps his metabolism\ngoing but also brown fat secretes these\nlittle hormones that are increasingly\nthought to be healthy as well so it's\nnot just your fat that's in good shape\nthat your whole body gets the benefits\nlong term hey let me tell you about my\nfavorite drink that i

are\nlistening like well i don't want more\nfat that's the exact opposite of what i\nwant but you're that you're talking\nabout the brown fat not the white fat is\nright well yeah it's not building up\nmore fat it's converting the fat in your\nbody to become brown or beige\nso yeah you don't build up fat it's\nquite the opposite actually it'll make\nyou\nthinner if you have if you have more\nbrown fat\nso more brown fat will make you thinner\nthat's going to be a\nthat's like a\npeople would never think that having\nmore fat would make you thinner but from\nwhat i've heard also as well it seems\nlike the brown fat you've said before\nhas um\nenergy producing mitochondria that's in\nas well oh exactly and and actually what\nhappens is those mitochondria when you\nget cold\ncan uncouple now uncoupling\nuh will extend the lifespan of flies and\nmice and basically what uncoupling is is\nthat the body uses\nuh some proteins called uncoupling\nproteins to\nuh basically punch holes or let holes\nthrough the mitochondria\nso a quick biology lesson mitochondria\nare like a hydroelectric dam there's a\nlot of water inside that gets let out\nand as they pass through the\nhydroelectric\nturbine they make energy\nand uh\nif you let the water through somewhere\nelse you're not going to be able to make\nas much energy and in doing so your body\nget that has the food in it you know you\neat a muffin it's not going to make as\nmuch energy so it has to work harder and\nyou you know you expend more energy what\nhappens to the energy well you know\nphysical laws of physics still apply it\ncomes out as heat\nand so your body might go up 0.01\ndegree\nfahrenheit or celsius it's very subtle\nyou don't feel it and you but you're\nexpending more energy and that over the\nlong run\nuh leads to less weight gain\ninteresting\nso one of the uh the things that you\nmentioned real quickly as well is you\nknow mostly plants but a little bit of\nfish is what you feel like you've\nswitched to so\nyou know\ni always hear people talk about\nred meat it's good for you red meat it's\nbad for you stay away from poor works\nlike there's i mean there's every\npossible things you can think of\nobviously but um what are you finding as\nfar as if there there's science around\nit between\nthe fish the chicken the pork the the\nbeef and how that either helps with\naging or actually holds us back with\naging\nwell this is a huge debate um there's\nthe carnivores who attacked me on social\nmedia\nkindly i know i know most of them so\nit's it's not vicious uh like it could\nbe but it's a healthy debate um really\nwe don't know that there's some evidence\nthat at least in mice you know we're not\nmice so fair is fair but in mice we give\nthem a certain amount of protein\nparticularly meat based protein and\nthere are chemicals in red meat that get\nconverted\ncan cause atherosclerosis so that's one\npossibility that red meat is bad for you\nprocessed meat's definitely\nbad the nitrates there are carcinogens\nin there so i try to avoid that though\nyou know sunday piece of nibble on bacon\nis certainly fine\nbut what i'm convinced by more\nthan a mouse study even\nare epidemiological studies you go to\nthe world\nuh like dan button has the blue zones\nand you look where are people the\nhealthiest where don't they get cancer\nwhere they live over 100\non average and these blue zones you look\nat what they eat\nand they're typically eating if you're\nin the mediterranean they're eating\na lot of vegetables olive oil getting a\nlot of exercise\na fair amount of red wine\num and you know that that sounds like my\ndiet right and it's not a bad diet to\nhave that might go fishing in the\nmediterranean pull out a fish and eat\nthat some sardines a lot of good oils in\nthere and the olive oil by the way\nactually we found or somebody else found\nbut we've confirmed\nactivates one of these longevity gene\npathways that we\nstudy the sirtuins which is pretty cool\nthe idea that olive oil is good for you\nbecause it's turning on a longevity\nmechanism but that's another story\num if you go to okinawa they have a\nreally interesting diet too there's a\nbook that i love called the okinawa\nprogram where they also they exercise\nthey they eat\nnot a lot they stop eating a meal at 70\nfull uh they're they're in the in the\nfields\nthey have a social network a lot of\nplants\nand they only eat fish generally maybe a\nlittle bit of pork but not much and that\nthey're the longest lived people on the\nplanet they there's a lot of people out\nthere that are still working the fields\nin their 90s and 100 above\nso all of that convinces me that um\nthe best bang for your buck\nis a more of a rabbits than an alliance\ndiet\nyou know but then again i'm not\nsome people have a shock when they learn\nthat i very occasionally or i might eat\nsome\ncheesecake or i might eat you know a\nsteak\nit's it's not worth living if you can't\neat the foods you love i just try to\nlimit it to special occasions and when i\nreally feel like it\nnow if we're talking about you know\nstress and discomfort is there benefit\nto every once in a while once a week\nonce a month whatever it is to literally\njust going all out and going crazy and\neating like is there a benefit to that\nat all because we're talking about\nstressing the body in different ways is\nthere benefit to just\nhaving a cheat day and just eating\nwhatever you want or a cheap meal\npassing out because you have enough\nenergy because your body's got to digest\nit all and then you know going back and\nnot doing that for another month or so\nis there actual benefit or any science\nbehind it at all\nuh i haven't seen any science behind it\nbut uh\nyou know i'm\nyou know last weekend i had to spend uh\nsunday in bed put it that way after a\npretty big night\nbut i don't think it does long-term harm\nif you do it once in a while if you do\nit a lot you're going to hurt your liver\nor you're going to build up fat in your\nliver just\nprobably hurt some neurons in your brain\nbut once in a while i mean i do it\nbecause i love life but you can also do\nit because you just need some mental\nrelief you can't always be so strict i\nfind and\nprobably the best effect on it is is the\nfact that you know that you can have a\nbit of fun once in a while and it's that\nmental\nuh stress relief that that it benefits\nbut i don't know i don't think uh a lot\nof food and a lot of uh alcohol i\nhaven't seen any benefits if i if i find\nit you know you'll be the first to know\nso uh one thing that i've heard you say\nthat you do avoid though is sugars and\ncarbs i'm really curious with that why\nyou you tend to avoid those\nwell i try to avoid them i i've learned\neven through wearing a glucose monitor\nthat di type 2 diabetics where what\nfoods trigger me now we're all different\nwe have different microbiomes and\nwhatever\ngenetics\nso what i try to avoid things that shoot\nmy blood sugar straight up now\ncheesecake\nis not going to make me live longer but\nagain you know i don't do that that\noften\nbut generally on a during the week i\nwould try to avoid white rice\nuh white bread eaten bread i'm starting\nto wean myself off because that just\nshoots the sugar up\num\nsushi unfortunately i love sushi that\nthat still is bad for me\nso what the reason that i do that\nactually is\nit's clear that having high blood sugar\nand continuous high blood sugar is bad\nin the long run you can measure your\nlong-term blood sugar levels it's called\nhba1c it's what your doctor will test\nmidlife to see if you've got type 2\ndiabetes and that's basically\nglucose attached to your hemoglobin\nwhich is an average as that goes up it's\nperfectly coral not perfectly but as\nhighly correlated with heart disease um\nand of course type 2 diabetes and even\ncancer so you want to over your life\nkeep those levels\nrelatively low\non average you can spike it's not going\nto kill you\nand that's why i essentially gave up\ndesserts at age 40\num\ni say essentially because i i do steal\nsome and occasionally eat it but\nprobably most of the time i'd rather\nhave a little piece of cheese\ninstead\num and i think that's the best way to go\nlow blood lower blood sugar\num\nlower hba1c\nuh will prevent glucose from binding to\nyour proteins remember we were saying\nthese proteins get misfolded and messed\nup and\nso this is called\nglycation and it happens during aging\nand you don't want it to happen\nit's like cooking your food on the\nbarbecue it's it's terrible stuff\nnow you can get rid of it with fasting\nbut in general it's best not to\naccumulate this so that's why i wouldn't\nsay i totally avoid carbs the other\nreason for avoiding carbs by the way is\nyou know i enjoy food and the more the\nbetter and if i don't eat a lot of carbs\nthen i can eat more food\nso i stick to foods\num you know that that are full of flavor\nand i really enjoy i'll admit something\nthat i've never admitted publicly if i\nput something in my mouth and i'm not at\na you know a fancy restaurant that has\nno taste tastes like crap\ni will consider spitting it out because\ni would rather replace that with\nsomething that's really tasty\nright this you know this this is not an\neating disorder this is just\nyou know was that mouthful of\nwhatever worth it i don't think so\nthat's awesome i love that the um\nthe thing that i'm real curious about\ni've never really asked but that's come\non is is\nabout three years ago my girlfriend i\ndecided to go gluten free because she\nwas having a lot of problems with eczema\nand started seeing like the the gut\nbiome and all that stuff\nwhat's your thoughts around gluten and\nis it something that you recommend that\npeople avoid or is it something that you\njust feel like is is uh\nand i know it's different depends on\nwhere you are like you could my mom has\ngluten issues she can go to italy and\nshe could under anything here she can't\neat any gluten in america so i mean what\nare your thoughts around gluten and\nconsuming it\nwell i'm not the world's expert i know\nenough\nto be dangerous here\nso yeah gluten is an issue\nand\ncutting back on on grains in general\ncertainly processed grains is a good\nthing for the reasons i just mentioned\nanyway\num and there is a sensitivity no\nquestion you can have it tested by your\ndoctor\nand there's a lot of it\num the thing to remember is we all have\ndifferent guts we have different\nmicrobes we have different sensitivities\nand you know i totally believe that that\ngluten does harm to a lot of people i\ndon't know if it's the majority of\npeople i think there might be a lot of\npeople who suspect a gluten sensitivity\nwhereas it's probably something else\nbut yeah i mean it's a real thing and\nhow you can have it checked out and you\ncan do self-experimentation like i do\nbecause we're all different we need to\nknow\nif it works for us whatever we're trying\nand yeah go go off gluten and see if you\nfeel better there's certainly no harm in\nthat yeah\num i'm curious because we talked about\ncancer a little bit as well we also\ntalked about wim hof\num is there any studies around breath\nwork in you know over oxygenation\nbecause i know that from the stuff i've\nread that usually cancer\nif you're looking at the the this place\nthat it is cancer tends to grow in an\nacidic environment people talk about how\nif you're over oxygenated that's an\nalkaline environment um do you know of\nany anything around breath work and over\noxygenating the body that way\n[Music]\nwell\nyeah\nso the warburg effect is what it's\ncalled and cancer cells love sugar\num\nand don't use a lot of oxygen for that\nreason\nthey're in a hypoxic state whereas the\nopposite is\nhyper oxygenation\nand\nnow i i don't\nthink uh that i've seen evidence that\num\njust breathing a lot would make any\ndifference but you can do hyperbaric\nchamber uh therapy\nand there is some really interesting\ndata that just came out\nnot on cancer but on uh what was it was\nuh dementia i believe\num and there's also is a paper that came\nout looking at telomeres the ends of the\nchromosomes that\nthat represent your age and get shorter\nas you get older uh they reversed\nthat process with age um just with some\ntherapy in this hyperbaric oxygen\nchamber so i think there's some merit to\nit and i i've done some work on this as\nwell we find that\num i won't get too much into it but\nhaving\nas you get older your muscles get\ntricked into thinking that there's not\nenough oxygen around\nthey become hypoxic\nand that they shut their own\nmitochondria down because they think oh\nthis person's not breathing enough\nthey've gone to the top of mount everest\nso they don't don't make as much\nmitochondria\nthe problem there is that your body's in\na state of hypoxia which is bad you\ndon't make mitochondria you don't make\nenergy you feel probably you feel\nlethargic and we found that by\nblocking that process\nand getting the cells back in a couple\nof weeks to feeling normal\nmice could now run twice as far on a\ntreadmill that was super healthy super\nfit had the energy back\nand so yeah it's this oxygen stuff and\nmitochondria is intimately linked to\naging\num and the older you get\nthe less\nmitochondrial activity you have\nnow\nyou can boost that up again\nprobably by exercising\nuh by being a bit cold\nand perhaps even by heavy breathing that\npart i don't know about but it's really\nimportant um\nand i think it's the future for a lot of\ntherapies given what i've seen\ninteresting so\nit's fun because i feel like you're like\nright on the cusp of all of the stuff\nthat was weird five years ago you know\nlike people were making fun of and it's\nlike oh this actually could have some\nsort of merit to it so it seems like\ncold therapy was made fun of going in\nsaunas was made fun of breathing was\nmade fun of fasting was made fun of all\nof these things were made fun of but it\nseems like\nthe core of it is really putting your\nbody under some form of stress\nbecause when it gets too comfortable is\nwhere it becomes an issue so it's\nfinding some\npart throughout the day where you i mean\neven if i'm thinking about you you're\ntalking about being sedentary i'm\nthinking like all right if i'm sitting\ndown watching netflix should i jump up\nand do like you know 50 jumping jacks\nand 50 push-ups and then go all right\nnow i can go back to watching netflix\nevery hour is that like is that that's\nprobably even more beneficial than just\nsitting there watching netflix for an\nhour an hour and a half right well yeah\nthat's a little extreme um hopefully\nyou're not cuddling with somebody under\na blanket at that point\nuh but you know sometime during the day\nyou should be moving if you're older\njust go on a on a walk if you're if you\nfeel like getting on a treadmill for a\nfew seconds for 10 minutes that's fine\ni do a fair amount of weight lifting um\nyou know despite what you might think\nand that is also important long term\num your body your muscles in particular\nwill secrete hormones that have\nlong-term benefits as well and allow you\nto eat more uh and burn fat so all of\nthat is good you do want to do it um but\nyou need rest as well don't forget you\ncan't run a marathon every day and\nexpect to be healthy\nright and so i have days of rest as well\nand that's when you should watch netflix\nyeah i've known the rest of the days on\nthe rest stage we're eating all the chew\npastas we can right\num yeah once in a while yeah i don't\nthink i don't think that's the thing\nthat uh that's gonna help i put up a\nquestion that i had i ended up feeling\nand number one i have a feeling\nintegrity number two i had a feeling i i\nknew what the question back would be\nfrom everybody would be i put up on my\ninstagram and i was like hey i'm going\nto talk to him you know uh one of the uh\nthe the front runners as far as uh\nanti-aging and aging in general what\nquestions you have and you might not be\nsurprised by this question the number\none question that came back was from a\nlot of women and it said what to put on\ntheir faces to to remove lines i have a\nfeeling i know your answer is going to\nbe around this it probably has something\nto do with besides just putting\nsomething on your face but with the look\nof aging what uh what helps with that\nuh yeah well so\ni i have a fair number of uh of\nvip\nclients who are\nasking me these same questions the good\nnews is that if you do what i\nwhat i do\num\nprobably what's happening is your whole\nbody will will stay healthier and\nyounger and your skin is a very large\norgan if not the largest\num so you can start on the inside you\ndon't need to slather yourself with\nstuff\num\ni don't know you can judge me i'm 51 so\ni haven't got a gray hair yet um and i\ndon't think i've lost much either\nso you know that's what we call an n of\none clinical trial not exactly helpful\nbut i do believe that you should start\non the inside\num and you can apply things from the\noutside there are\ni mean the easiest thing to do is just\navoid\nthe sun um i grew up in australia\nunfortunately when it was fashionable to\nget burnt that's gonna come back to\nhaunt me so avoid avoid the sun um take\nvitamin d that's also very good long\nterm for health and the skin\num\nthere's uh you know retinol which\nactually does work\ni would say that's something that a lot\nof people already know\nthere are creams that\nare purported to raise nad levels nad is\na molecule we work on in my lab and\nthat's the fuel for these sirtuins that\ni've talked about these longevity genes\nand actually\nactually as we get older the nad levels\nin the skin go go down by about twofold\nso in my 50s i'm 51 as i said i would\nhave roughly half the levels as i did\nwhen i was 20. so maybe you can raise\nthe levels of an ad in the skin with a\ncream uh instead i take a pill that\nraises my nad levels i talk about it in\nthe book page 304 if you want to learn\nall that stuff\num i think it's possible to slow aging\nin the skin um\nyou know and then it\nif that doesn't work there's always uh\nthe other cosmetic stuff\nbut uh you know i think you want to\nstart early in life you know once you're\nin your 30s when i when i started\nit's a long-term program you cannot\nexpect to start at 45 and instantly\nreverse the effects yeah i had a feeling\nyou're going to say it started from the\ninside out there's not a whole lot of\nmagic effects that actually takes but\npeople want the fix all they want they\njust want to fix it and look young\nimmediately but um i'm curious with with\nthat in in with skin in general um what\ndo you know about red light therapy uh\naround the skin and producing\nmitochondria as well\nyeah i i think it's got legs as a\nscientist i tried to extend the lifespan\nof nematode worms with this red light in\nmy lab it didn't work but i haven't\ngiven up given up on it yet\num i think there's something to the red\nlight therapy there's some\nreasonable data on\nuh what is it hair\ngrowth uh from this so\nprobably there's something going on but\nit's really not well studied we need a\nlot more\ni've seen that you can buy these red\nlights\num\nsomeone even sent me one to be honest i\nhaven't used it much\nbut i think that there's there's good\nreason to think that certain wavelengths\ncould trigger your body into a hormesis\neffect\num\nyeah i think well where i stand on that\nis we need more research but i doubt\nthat it's doing harm\nright\nso i'm curious because you said\nsomething i want to get really clear on\nit you said avoid the sun\nnow do you mean completely avoid the sun\nor do you mean you know avoid getting\nburned because a lot of people are gonna\nbe like\nhe said don't go out so i'm not gonna go\nout yeah but i've also heard that being\nhaving at least some sunlight triggers\nyou know turns off like between turns on\nor off like 300 switches inside of your\nbrain in your body and all of this stuff\nso so with sunlight and getting the\nvitamin d from sunlight but also taking\nit um as you recommended um what is what\nis your recommendation around sunlight\nyeah well disclaimer i don't recommend\nstuff but what i can tell you is that no\nrecommendations what does the science\nsay around sunlight yeah thank you rob\nthanks for bringing that up maybe i i\nmisspoke what i meant to say was\ndon't stay in the sun long enough for\nthere to be irreversible damage so a\nlittle bit of sunlight is good i'm i\nwalk out\ni haven't been out that much because\nit's middle of winter here in boston\nbut yeah some sunshine is fine but but\ndon't do it for\nyou know more it depends on the uv but\ni would these days because i'm you know\npasty as much as a vampire would be i\nwould i don't want to spend more than\nhalf an hour out there in the sun that's\nenough but think of it as a competition\nbetween dna damage what's happening with\nthe sunlight is your dna gets\ncrosslinked and your body has to come in\nand take out those crosslinks and put a\nnew piece of dna in and your body takes\ntime to do that and the older you get\nthe worse it get the the slower it is\nand it's a balance of damage repair\ndamage repair and if you don't repair it\nyou get mutations and epigenetic changes\ntoo don't forget\nso what i like to do is i you know get a\nbit of sun it's healthy for sure you get\na bit of a tanning effect too but if you\nstay red you've overdone it uh your body\ncan't cope and it's got inflammation so\nyou're limited but you know i wasn't\ntrying to say live in your basement for\nthe rest of your life i'm eager to get\nout this pandemic has been pretty uh\nharsh on on myself and all of us\nyeah\num so i've heard you talk about you know\nnad nmm a few different other things as\nwell a lot of podcasts but one thing\nthat i've heard a lot about recently\nmaybe just because of people that i hang\nout with\nis something called bpc157\nfor it's a peptide that you inject into\ndifferent parts of your body that you\nwant to regrow but also like joints as\nwell have you heard any of the science\naround bpc157 at all\nwell i hear it a lot\npeople ask me that\ni don't know enough even to talk about\nit with any\nauthority\ni'm sure it has that uh has effects\nbecause athletes\nuh have taken it um it's not approved\nfor human clinical use by any authority\num and it's thought there may be some\nnegative effects um\nso it's on a prohibited list um\ndepending on\nwaiting on new research um\nalso athletes they it's part of that\ndoping test it's uh there's tests\ngetting developed\nso i don't know uh enough i mean maybe\nyou do\nto say something about it\num\ni wouldn't say that i'm authority in it\ni don't recommend anything either so\nthat's one thing i want to make sure of\num\nso we've covered a lot of different\nthings and so i know everyone there's a\nlot of different things we've jumped\naround in but\nyou know if we're saying okay for the\ntypical person i'm 35 about to be 35\nyears old right um if if we're going\nthrough and we're saying the science uh\nas far as sleep to waking up to the\nstresses to put my body through the type\nof stuff to eat the fasting how often do\ni do all of it what is the typical\nas far as the science says what would\nwhat would a typical really day good day\nlook like as far as the stress we put\nour bodies through the stuff that we eat\nhow often we eat does it matter when we\neat and then also how much sleep we\nshould have and if there is a time of\nwhen we should go to bed we should not\nget better if none of that actually\nmatters\nit all matters um but again don't don't\nbe so strict on yourself because you\nyou'll stress about not sleeping that\nthat can backfire\nwell let's see let's start with a\ntypical day for me uh\nget up uh shower i'll\nhave a cup of tea or coffee a little bit\nof milk doesn't hurt a bit of stevia\ncertainly doesn't hurt um\ni will most days have a little\npiece of not piece spoonfuls of yogurt\nuh\nprobably a greek yogurt or one i make\nmyself and i sprinkle in about a gram of\nresveratrol this is the molecule in red\nwine that we\ndiscovered activates the sertuans um\ngoing back to 2003 now but if anyone you\nknow hears that red wine is good for\nyour slowing your aging that's that's\nour lab so i do that i've been doing\nthat for a lot of parts of that\nyeah\nactually when we published that in\nnature back then red wine sales went up\n30 and it\nstayed up so you're welcome uh red wine\nindustry\nso i do that and then uh then i go\nhungry you know i'm not hungry i fast\nprobably until late afternoon or go all\nthe way to dinner\nduring the day i'll try to stand up i'll\ngo on a walk\ni'll go to the gym maybe once every\nthree days\nlift some weights run on a treadmill for\nfive ten minutes\num\nand that's a good day for me when it\ncomes to the night it's very important\nto dim the lights\nyou and i are looking into the screen\nall day i've got lights here on my face\nit's that really bad this blue light in\nparticular and so i did that at night\nautomatically on my phone on my computer\nthere's a piece of software called f dot\nlux which is great for computing\nuh i wear those um yellow glasses to\nblock out the blue light if i watch tv\nand i try not to do a lot of computing\nafter 10 o'clock at night so it's it's\ndifficult right we're all on our phones\nand then i try to get to sleep then you\nknow\ni practice\nbreathing and try to calm down because\ni'm going at 200 miles an hour every day\nand i try to get a good night's sleep\nevery night if i can i typically do i\nknow if i do because i've got this aura\nring on\nand that's a good day so why do all that\nwell hormesis and even the sleep wake\ncycle it's important that i take\nmy nmn which is the nad booster i s you\nknow this is my part of my breakfast\nthat's the nad boosting molecule which\nwe're testing clinical trials right now\nany of my colleagues who say\ni'm just experimenting now this is we\nhave clinical data at this point\nuh it's not a medicine yet but hopefully\nit will be so there's that there's\nvirtual that's in the morning so i get\nthis\ni feel this this boost\nand it sustains through the day but then\nat night i need to come down the nad\nlevels would come down by then and i get\na good night's sleep which is important\nwe know that that cycle the sleep wake\ncycle we call the circadian rhythm is\nintimately con connected with longevity\nif you mess up sleep in an animal within\na few weeks it's got type 2 diabetes um\nand it'll age more rapidly\nconversely as you get older your sleep\nwake cycle will get messed up you know\nhow many people have a grandparent who\ndoesn't sleep well that's in part\nbecause this nad\ncycle that we have during our day\nnaturally\nuh gets flatter and you don't feel as\ntired and you wake up in the middle of\nthe night\nlong way of saying get exercise\nskip a few meals one a day don't eat a\nlot of snacks and get a good night's\nrest\nlove that\num last thing i want to dive into that\nwe spoke about right before everything\nwe started recording which was uh death\njust in general and we we connected in a\nweird way around the fact that we just\nactually think that death is something\nthat actually drives us and um and i'd\nlove for you to share kind of your\nviewpoint on you know we talked about\ncarpe diem and we also talked about just\nviewing our lives as if it's already\nhappened and we already have died so um\nif you'd share with that since this is a\nmindset mentor and i want to dive into\nthe mindset of everybody if you'd share\nkind of your viewpoint on that because i\nthought it was really interesting\nright well anybody who listens to your\nyour podcast knows that you've been\nthrough some hell too\nuh yeah by the time you're my age of 50\nyou've seen a lot um and most of us have\nseen at least one of our parents pass\naway\na few years ago was probably going back\nfive years now i watched my mother\npass away she had lung cancer had her\nlung removed\nsurvived for 20 years actually\nmaybe residual had something to do with\nit but she really did do well\nbut then her remaining lung gave out\nso i flew to australia to be by her\nbedside fortunately she\ndidn't die during that flight i wrote\nthe eulogy for her\nfuneral i thought this was it\nuh arrived she sat up she was happy i\nsaid hey mom do you want to hear the\neulogy that i wrote it's uh really i\nthink you'd get a laugh\nand she laughed it was great\nuh it was probably five minutes later i\nhadn't had a chance to read it to her\nshe coughed her lungs became\ncongested there was fluid in them um and\ni literally watched my mother\nwide-eyed suffocate to death in front of\nme it only took about a minute\ni only had time\nto start screaming at the nurses and the\ndoctors to get help\nthey said there's nothing we can do\nand i whispered in her ear uh mom you're\nthe best mom i could ever hope for\nthanks for everything and uh you know\nyou see that\nas a kid as a you know as a human being\nfirst of all mike my first thought was\nseeing her\nride on on the bed like like\na dying\nlizard you know that that's something\nthat no one tells you about\nyou know sorry if i've you know told\neverybody here and you didn't want to\nhear it\noften death is not a pleasant thing uh\nit can be horrific and my mother\nsuffered that way\nand uh\nyou know we gotta live life first of all\nlike every day could be our last\num and there will be a last day\nwe will take our last breath that's\nthat's a fact\num and then when you see something\nhorrible like that\ni live life like\nit's a great day if somebody hasn't died\nwhen you see something like that there\nis no such thing as a bad day\nall right so i would i still get home\nand you know how was your day the kids\nwill ask and i'll say it was a great day\nnobody died and that that's my bar and\nthat's why every day to me\nis a blessing and i'm super optimistic\nabout things carpe diem i live that\nevery day the other thing i like to\nthink about is\ni live like life like i died years ago\num i've had some close miss close calls\ni drive my car a little too fast\num i drive one of elon's tesla vehicles\num and i i regard myself as having died\nand i live my life like hey every day is\nan extra day that i got\nand that also helps\ni love that\nwell thank you for sharing that that was\nyeah i've been in the room when someone\npasses away and there is\n[Music]\ni've never been in the room with\nsomeone's birth yet i've heard that's\nquite amazing but to be in the room when\nsomeone passes away is a life-changing\nexperience and it really changes the way\nthat you think of everything i was in\nthe room with my grandfather passed away\nmy myself and my cousin and it was just\nlike\nit was an interesting thing to go\nthrough but i also felt so blessed to\nhave been in the room when it happened\nbecause it changed even more my\nviewpoint on life and death as well\nyeah it really does and\nyou know i don't want anyone to have to\ngo through something like that if they\ndon't have to\nbut if you do it certainly gives you\nthis different view about\nmortality your own mortality right you\nknow what's coming\nit doesn't i don't live in fear rather\ni'm sure you don't but but we live life\nwith energy\nwith the thought that\nevery day is a gift and there will be\none day when they run out and i i think\nyou're the same we want to do the most\nto leave this world a better place 100\nlove it well uh dr david sinclair um i\nknow you have an amazing book lifespan\nwhy we age and why we don't need to but\num where else can people find you so\nthere's obviously your book people can\nconsume but where else can people find\nyou if they want to learn a little bit\nmore\nuh well of course on social media um i'm\nfairly active on twitter so i'm\nthere at david uh david a sinclair i'm\non instagram\noccasionally post some videos and some\ntidbits on that little in insights into\nmy life in my lab there\nuh more detail i have a newsletter you\ncan sign up for that is on a website\nlifespanbook.com lifespanbook.com\ni also have an illustrated\nsection to my book so if you buy the\naudible version you can download the pdf\nthat comes with it there's a glossary\nillustrated glossary there's there's a\ncast of characters that i actually drew\nall of the characters that had to do\ntheir head shots by hand due to\ncopyright um so there's all that and\nthere's a q a you can sign up for the\nnewsletter there\ni'm working on a second book which\nactually\ntalks more about hormesis and what we\ncan do but a lot of the book is is about\nwhy we're aging but half of the book\nwell at least a third is about what you\ncan do now to slow that process and and\nlook better and feel better\nby the time you hit my age and beyond\namazing dr davidson chloe claire i\nappreciate your time man it's been great\nand i think a lot of people are going to\nlearn a lot from uh from all of us\nbecause it was\nit's it's definitely a different\nperspective of going you know what we\ncan look at this differently and we can\nactually try to slow or reverse this\naging process down and\nman if you're putting out uh if you're\nputting out books you're gonna have to\nkeep putting out books with all the\nresearch and stuff that's coming down\nthe line it seems like in the next five\nor ten years possibly\nwell this is the reason i have to so we\nmade a discovery that that hit the cover\nof nature\num\nhopefully this isn't too egotistical but\nit's pretty pretty fun so we got the\ncover of nature magazine in december and\nthis talks about the biggest thing that\nyou could get and that's like the\nthe top of the top is nature magazine\nright for for people who are doctors and\nscientists and work in your field\nwell\ni mean you can win a nobel prize but\nthat's pretty good uh that was a\nhighlight and i had a fantastic team\nthat was able to show how to get rid of\nthose scratches on the cd and that was\nthe work that we showed could uh reverse\nblindness in in old age and the first\ntime safely reset the age of an animal's\ntissue in vivo in the actual living\nanimal without causing any issues\nso the exciting part is is that and the\nreason i'm writing a second and probably\na third book\nis that this field is going so quickly\nfive years ago and i started saying\nuh not just delaying aging but we could\nreverse it and a lot of my harvard\ncolleagues and elsewhere screwed up\ntheir face he goes sinclair again he's\ngoing off in a dream world you know i'm\nhappy to say that the science has caught\nup to that and uh\nlike you said it's no longer crazy to\nthink and even dream about what the\nfuture looks like\nit's amazing\nwell thank you so much for your time i\nappreciate it\nrob it's been great thanks for doing\nwhat you do hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you love this\nvideo i've got another one you're gonna\nlove just click right here and watch it"
