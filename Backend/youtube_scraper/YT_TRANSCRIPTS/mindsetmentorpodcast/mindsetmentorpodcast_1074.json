    "transcript": "everybody that you love will die\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\ndeath\none of the most motivating things in the\nworld to talk about we're going to talk\nabout the death of everyone that you\nknow that's around you and how to cope\nwith death we're also going to talk\nabout your own death and how to become\nmore okay with it right and the\ninteresting thing about death is that it\nis guaranteed it will happen no matter\nwhat\nuh and and we really need to learn that\nif it's going to happen it's nothing we\ncan get away from we need to try to\nbecome as okay with it as we possibly\ncan because everybody that you love will\ndie\nright like it sounds morbid but in\nreality it's not that morbid it's just\nfact\nand you\nwill die\nand so we're going to talk about both of\nthose because i get a ton of messages so\nmany messages on on instagram from\npeople and i read all the messages right\nof\nthey lost somebody they don't know how\nto get past it right they lost a loved\none they just died of old age or they\nhad something that happened to them that\nwas tragic or there was a suicide or it\nwas their grandparents or it was their\nparents\nsome people it was old age some people\nit was young age and it was something\nthat was tragic that happened it's every\ntype of thing that you could some of\nthem are overdoses every type of of\ndeath you could think of i've been send\nmessages about it and when i see\nsomething that comes through\nmany many many many times in my\ninstagram messages i go huh i should\nprobably make an episode on this because\nthis is clearly something people want to\nlearn about so\nfor those of you guys that want\nto you know message me and give me some\nform of request of what i should do an\nepisode on message me on instagram\nthat's where i usually talk to people\nrob dial junior\nr-b-d-i-a-l-j-r that's how i communicate\nand talk with people but when we're\ngoing into death and we're talking about\ndeath i've seen it come up many many\ntimes and people are struggling all of\nthe time\nwith how do they cope with it you know\nsomeone that they love they won't expect\nthem to die it happened how do you work\nthrough it the first thing that i think\nis important is before anybody dies\nat this moment\nyou have to learn to start becoming more\nokay with it because it's going to\nhappen for everybody right\nto you to your loved ones to everyone\nand that's not morbid it's just a fact\nso first let's dive into the death of\nsomeone that you know before we talk\nabout your own death we'll talk about\nboth of them we'll dive into them and\ni'm going to make it as light as\npossible because it's going to happen\nwhy would i want to make it depressing\nright\nso i'll talk about how you know in\nmy instance of how i've had some\nrelations with death you know up into my\nfirst 14 years i never knew one person\nthat died maybe some older person that i\ndidn't really know that was in my family\nlike a distant cousin or a distant aunt\nor uncle or whatever it was but no one\nthat was i was really close to had\npassed away my first 14 years then when\ni was 15 my dad died unexpectedly he was\nan alcoholic we weren't expecting him to\ndie\nhe did we were flying up to go see him\nfrom florida to tennessee and we were\ngetting on about to get on the plane\nto go see him because he was unconscious\nand we got the message that he had\npassed away i was and you know he was\nthe first dead body i'd ever seen and\nthat left a really big imprint on my\nmind of\nholy this is going to end like this\nas much if you've ever been to a funeral\nof someone that you know and that you're\nclose to it feels like a joke it feels\nlike they're about to pop up and be like\nhey just kidding no no no just joking\ni'm let's go hang out right and it never\nhappens and so it's the it's that\nrealization of like oh\nwow this is going to happen to everyone\nthat i know and that's going to happen\nto me as well\ni would say that moment\nchanged my life as far as the urgency\nthat i bring to every single thing that\ni do then i'll talk more about that\nlater right i was also in the room\nabout three or four years ago when my\ngrandfather passed away right i was in\nthe room in hospice\nthere\nit's a crazy experience to be in the\nroom when someone passes away right i\nwas there\ni was also there when my mom and her\nthree sisters told my grandmother that\nher husband of 70 years had passed away\nright that's a whole other thing to see\nis to see somebody process that in real\ntime\nright i've had friends die from car\naccidents i've had friends die from\noverdoses i've had friends die from\nsuicides i've had friends that have been\nmurdered i've seen a quite a few\ndifferent sides of death\nand\ni don't know if i just gave you like my\nqualifications for talking about death\nbut i guess i just did but i'm going to\ntell you what i have learned through the\nprocess being somebody who is obsessed\nwith mindset obsessed with trying to get\nbetter and the first thing is is there's\nalways a grieving process right\nand one thing that i've noticed with\npeople\nis\nthey tried to speed up the greeting\nprocess whatever the grieving process is\nthe grieving processes don't try to\nspeed it up\ndon't try to not feel it don't try to\nkeep yourself busy that's one thing that\npisses me off the most is when somebody\nhas somebody that they're dealing with\nthe emotions of death and someone says\nwell just keep yourself busy so you\ndon't think about it yeah that sounds\nlike a really\ngreat way to just repress your emotions\nyou don't want to do that feel it\nas beautiful it is to experience the\nmost beautiful amazing joyful loving\nparts of your life\nthe other emotions\nare also very beautiful and it's part of\nthe human experience and if you can't\nallow yourself to experience the lowest\nof lows i promise you actually won't be\nable to allow yourself to experience the\nhighest of highs so allow yourself to\nfeel it don't feel like you there's a\nright way to do it and a wrong way to do\nit there is no right there is no wrong\njust experience it and see if you can\nenjoy\nthis part of the human experience right\nso i will say that and as far as grief\nand the way that it goes\nis one of the best ways i've heard it\nexplains it's kind of like waves right\ngoing out to the ocean you know in when\nyou first have someone that you love\nthat passes away it's like the waves are\n100 feet tall and they're just crashing\non you and crashing on you and crashing\non you and you can barely come up for\nair that's like how it feels in the very\nbeginning where it's like you're just\ngetting swept and every single emotion\nand feeling and anger will come up and\nsadness will come up and fear will come\nup and you're just getting hit by\nconstantly rocked by these waves\nand then\ntime starts to pass and the waves start\nto come a little bit less frequently but\nwhen they do come they're still 100 feet\ntall and they'll still throw you upon\nthe rocks and you try to get up and try\nto have some form of air to come up\nright\nand then\nyou know as time goes on you tend to\nprocess and you know the waves will\nstill come\nunexpectedly but instead of being 100\nfeet tall they might be 50 feet tall\nand they might they might get to 20 feet\ntall and 30 feet tall and sometimes they\nthen after a while they come really\nunexpectedly could be a year two years\ndown the road it might be like a a song\nthat you hear that just hits you again\nand you can't help but be overcome with\nemotion or might be driving past a\ncertain part of town and seeing a you\nknow\na gas station where you have a memory\nwith that person and you just get hit\nagain and there's nothing wrong with\nthat\nright the human experience is a\nbeautiful thing the highs are beautiful\nthe lows are beautiful the worst things\nyou can do is try to rush a grieving\nprocess or think that you're doing it\nright or think that you're doing it\nwrong one of the things that i always\ntell people if you want to help yourself\nif you love somebody that died\nright they're not going to come back\nlike i can promise you that\nbut one of the things you can do is you\ncan help them live on in you and what do\ni mean by that this is something i did\nwith my grandfather my grandfather was\nlike\nthe kindest person that i've ever met my\nentire life he was incredible to the\npoint where like i'm finally at the\npoint where i don't cry talking about\nhim because he was just that incredible\nof a human being right and so when he\npassed away it was such a another\nmonumental event in my life that i wrote\ndown and this was a few years ago so i\nwas at least you know\nemotionally intelligent enough to work\nmyself through it because i had worked\nmany clients through at this point in\ntime not like when i was 15 and i had\nnever had a client never really worked\nin myself at all right so i wrote down\nall the things that i loved about my\ngrandfather unconditional like literally\nthe only person i've known with\nunconditional love like no matter what\nhe was going to help you out right he\nkindness and loving and joy didn't\nmatter who you are what you believed in\nwhat you looked like didn't matter loved\nyou either way\nso i wrote down all the things that i\nloved about him and the character traits\nthat i\nrespected most about him\nand then what i did was i went i want to\nwake up every single morning\nand meditate on how i can be more like\nthis because if i fully respect somebody\nand who they are in the character traits\nthat they have wouldn't i want those\ncharacter traits to also be inside of me\nand isn't that the best way the best way\nto actually keep that person alive after\nthey have passed away so i recommend\nif you have somebody that's recently\npassed away or you have somebody that\npasses away soon enough or even if they\npass away decent pass write down the two\nthree four five things that you love\nmost about them and then wake up every\nsingle morning and take five minutes and\npause and read those five things and\nclose your eyes and try to get into your\nsubconscious of i'm going to bring\nthese aspects of this person into myself\nevery single day and if you do that\nevery single day what you'll realize is\nyou actually start to become\nthe aspects of that person that you love\nthe most so that's the interesting thing\nabout the grieving process and how to\nhelp you work through it another thing\nthat will help you as well\nis to realize the difference between\npain versus suffering and this is super\nimportant okay because pain is the pain\nthat you feel and pain is inevitable you\ncan't go through this life without some\nform of pain pain is inevitable you're\ngonna have scars in this in any lifetime\nyou're gonna have scars pain is\ninevitable suffering is optional\nwhat do i mean by that pain is somebody\ndied in the emotions that you feel with\nthat\npain is the the feelings that you feel\nfrom the loss of someone\nsuffering\nis the resistance\nto someone's death which then makes it\neven worse it is the unnecessary part of\nit right it's the thoughts of oh my gosh\nthey were too young\nit shouldn't have been them\nit shouldn't have happened this way\nmaybe what did i do wrong part of this\nis my fault i should have been\nbeen there for them i shouldn't have let\nthem get in the car i shouldn't have let\nthem do that thing\nand most of the time the suffering comes\nfrom not accepting\nright so there's the pain of the event\nthat's going to happen you're going to\nhave pain it's part of being a human\nthe suffering is not accepting it and\nwishing that it was different there is\nno other way that it could have happened\nbecause it didn't happen any other way\nit happened the way that it happened it\ncould not have happened any other way\nwhy because it didn't\nyou have to learn to accept the\nsuffering comes when you are resisting\nthe way that the world is there's\nnothing you can do about them it is in\nthe past there's nothing you can do\nabout anything in your past right the\nonly thing that you can do something\nabout is you\nso you have to learn to accept\nyou cannot change\nexcept that that's just the way that the\nworld is\nright\nanother thing that i always tell myself\nthat i heard from ramdas who is a\nspiritual teacher who passed away about\na year and a half ago\nis something that i say every that i've\nnoticed and i start to say to myself\nover the past year and a half when\nsomeone that i know passes away and what\nhe says is that a soul does not leave\nthis plane that we're in a second too\nsoon or a second too late\nit happened exactly where that was\nsupposed to happen if you believe in god\nor the universe or fate or\nyou know\nthe quantum realm of all of this stuff\nthat's happening\nyou've got to believe that everything\nhappens the way that it's supposed to\nright and i've just accepted i'm not in\ncontrol i'm not in control of when\nsomeone leaves this time i'm not in\ncontrol of when i leave this\nit's going to happen the way it's\nsupposed to happen the soul does not\nleave this plane a second too soon or a\nsecond too\nlate just the way it goes it worked out\nexactly was supposed to work out that\nwas you know if you want to say that was\ntheir karmic predicament\nit could be and the way that you're\nreacting to it is also your karmic\npredicament too what's going on with\nthat so you have to realize that\ndeath is going to happen but you can\nmake it easier on yourself by instead of\nnot accepting\nactually sitting down accepting and\nstart figuring out what you love most\nabout them and bringing that person into\nyourself and then being okay and not\njudging yourself for the grieving\nprocess and allowing things just to\nhappen so that's the death of a loved\none now\nlet's talk about you dying because it's\ngoing to happen you're not going to be\nable to live to 500 years old you know\nthere's all these people that are\ntalking about longevity and living\nforever and putting yourself inside of a\nfreezer until something i don't know\nwhat all that stuff is i'm not going to\nresist it it's going to happen right\nit's going to happen and most people are\nterrified of it\nit's going to happen there's nothing you\ncan do about it so you might as well\nfigure out a way to become at least a\nlittle bit more okay with it right no\nmatter how terrified you are of it it's\nstill going to happen so you might as\nwell accept that\nright\nbut the way that i see death is i see\ndeath as a beautiful part of life\nright we're dying at every single second\ni am if you're watching me on video i am\nslowly decaying in front of you every\nsingle second as beautiful as that\nsounds right i'm decaying in front of\nyou\nfor those of you guys that are listening\nto me just on the podcast\nmy voice is slowly deteriorating for you\nright but the beautiful thing about\ndeath in my opinion is death gives your\nlife urgency\nright if you didn't have to die\nif you were immortal\nyou'd always have tomorrow\nwhy do i need to go ahead and\ntry to build this business why do i need\nto try to get into that relationship\nhelp the world\nmake money have fun\nyou know change other people's lives\nbecause there's always tomorrow\nbut the beautiful thing about death is\nthat there is not always tomorrow\ntomorrow is never guaranteed and so if\nyou take life and look at it that way\nyou realize\nthat that should bring your life some\nurgency an urgency in a good way\nand if you deal with if you've ever\nheard of stoic philosophy\nthere's a stoic phrase and stoics the\nbeautiful thing about uh that the phrase\nthat i heard around it not the original\nphrase i was going to tell you i'll tell\nyou that in a second but a phrase i\nheard around stoicism is that stoicism\ndoesn't\ndoesn't take away human emotions it\ndomesticates them it makes you\nunderstand the emotions feel them and be\nable to work through them and process\nthem in real time and one of the things\nthat they say the phrase in stoicism is\nmomentum mori momento mori\nright which means remember that you're\ngoing to die\nand you may have heard me talk about\nthis in the podcast before and uh this\ni've thought this way even before i ever\nheard the phrase you know memento mori\nand i remember i was having a\nconversation with my mom not too long\nago and i was like mom\njust curious how often do you think of\ndeath and she's like oh i don't know\nmaybe\nmaybe once a week once every two weeks\nor so i was like okay and she could what\nwhy how often do you think of death and\ni was like ah\ni don't know probably every\nfew hours\nfive times a day ten times a day and\nshe's like really i was like yeah but\nnot in a creepy way like ooh i'm\nthinking about death or i'm thinking\nabout dead people or anything that type\nof stuff or you know i can't wait till\nit happens or like i wasn't thinking any\nof that type of stuff it's just like\nit's going to happen and if i think\nabout the fact that it's going to happen\nit brings me urgency i always say that i\ndon't really have any fears anymore\nexcept for one like i don't care what\npeople think about i don't care about\nother people's opinions or judgments i\ndon't care about failing i don't care\nabout any of that stuff i've worked\nthrough it mostly i won't say i'm just\ncompletely relieved of it but it's\nbasically mostly gone right the one fear\nthat i really do have though is that i'm\ngonna get to my deathbed and wish that i\nwould have done something more to bring\nout my true potential for the world\nright the only thing worse than the pain\nof hard work is a pain of regret i do\nnot want to regret anything\nwhen i die\ni want to get to my deathbed and be like\ndamn that was fun\nyou did everything you could kid you did\nit all you did everything you built the\nbusiness you wanted to you had the\nfamily you wanted to you had the kids\nyou wanted to you impact the world that\nyou were you wanted to all of that stuff\nand the reason why i do what i do and\nthe reason why i push so much harder\nthan a lot of other people that are in\nmy industry because i'm gonna die\nand i pay attention that every single\nday like i think about it all of the\ntime i'm very aware of it and it's a\nbeautiful thing\nso i want to experience everything that\nthere is in this world i don't\nexperience all of the beautiful all of\nthe the hard stuff i don't experience\neverything there is i want to bring out\nall of the potential that i feel that i\nhave inside of myself and i know you all\nfeel that you have some potential inside\nof you i want to release all of it to\nthe world so therefore when i do get to\nthat day when it will eventually happen\ni can go\nall right\ni'm ready i've done all that i can so\nwhen you can come to terms that everyone\nthat you know is going to die and you\nare going to die as well\nand you can come to terms with it and\nsee it as a beautiful thing and give it\ngive it have it give you\nmore beautiful things in life than\nnegative things when you start thinking\nabout death and when death happens to\nsee when someone else dies you can take\nthat beautiful part of them and put it\ninto yourself and you can look at your\nown death that will eventually happen\nand have it give you more urgency to get\noff the couch to get off to instagram to\ndo the things you want to to impact the\nworld to impact people around you to\nbring out your potential to the world\nyou realize that death\nis actually one of the most beautiful\nparts of life\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you
