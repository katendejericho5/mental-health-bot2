    "transcript": "they just would rather\nnot change in the moment that they'd\nrather stay exactly the same because\nthey know\nwhat they know tomorrow is predictable\nif they don't change and the reason is\nthat with change comes loss and what we\nlose is the familiar so you know there's\nsomething about knowing exactly how\nthings are gonna go even if we're not\nreally happy with them people will lose\na hundred pounds and then they'll gain a\nhundred pounds back or they'll win the\nlottery and then they lose all their\nmoney so do you find that a lot of times\nit's because of the story that they're\nattached to the identity behind\neverything that kind of they can go out\nof it and it pulls them right back into\nit my ted talk is all about how you\nchange your story and one of the things\nthat i say both in the book and the talk\nis that a lot of people think they're\ncoming to therapy to get to know\nthemselves but i feel like what you're\ndoing when you come to therapy is you're\ncoming to unknow yourself\ni've been a therapy uh i know other\npeople have been in therapy and i know\npeople who are terrified of therapy um\nfirst off do you feel as a therapist uh\nthat most people should go to therapy\nand then also the same time why do\nwhy do people get so afraid to go and\ntalk with someone that's a therapist\nyeah well first of all i don't think\neverybody needs to go to therapy i think\nyou know the title of the book maybe you\nshould talk to someone is a little bit\nof a nod toward trying to say to a\nfriend well maybe you should talk to\nsomeone but it also means maybe we need\nto talk more to one another and i mean\nin an honest way in a way that is going\nto be helpful and we need to learn how\nto listen to one another and i think\nthat the reason that people are afraid\nof reaching out and going to therapy\nbecause i think therapy can be very\nuseful i feel like going to therapy is\nlike getting a really good second\nopinion on your life from someone who is\nnot in your life and people don't go\nbecause they think that you're gonna go\nto therapy you're gonna talk about your\nchildhood forever and you're never gonna\nleave whereas therapy is actually a very\nactive process of having someone go in\nand hold up a mirror to you and help you\nto see your blind spots help you to see\nwhat keeps you stuck helps you to see\nyour patterns so that you can be more\neffective out in the world\nso do you feel like you know if i think\nfrom like the the the spiritual aspect\npeople always talk about the ego right\nare\nare people afraid of change because it's\ngoing to destroy the ego the self the\nthe image the identity they've built up\nfor so long or is it they're just they\njust would rather\nnot change in the moment that they'd\nrather stay exactly the same because\nthey know\nwhat they know tomorrow is predictable\nif they don't change\nright that's such a good point because\nyou know even positive change\npeople have trouble with so that's why\nnew year's resolutions for example often\ndon't last\nand and the reason is that with change\ncomes loss and what we lose is the\nfamiliar\nso you know there's something about\nknowing exactly how things are gonna go\neven if we're not really happy with them\nwhen you make a change you are going\ninto a place of uncertainty um you're\nchanging an old habit you're doing\nsomething that's outside of your comfort\nzone you're going to experience some\ndiscomfort because you are changing and\nhumans don't do well with uncertainty so\nwhat we do is we sabotage our efforts at\nchanging and the other reason and i go\nthrough this and maybe you should talk\nto someone there are many stages of\nchange it's not like you wake up one day\nyou say i'm gonna change and then you\nchange sometimes that happens but more\noften you go through the changes that i\ntalk about in my book where there's\npre-contemplation you don't even realize\nyou're thinking about change there's\ncontemplation you're sort of\ncontemplating it but you're not ready\nthere's preparation then there's action\nand the most important phase of change\nis maintenance\nand maintenance is once you've made the\nchange how do you maintain that change\nand most people the second they split\nback and you will because you're human\nthey say oh it didn't work i failed as\nopposed to oh that's okay i'm just gonna\nget back on the train again tomorrow\nyeah one of the things that that i find\nwith people is they get so stuck in the\nstory of i guess you could call it\nidentity that they have you know you\nhear story you hear identity you hear\nblueprints you hear personality it's all\nkind of one of the same once you dive\ninto it but um\ni find that for so many people they have\nso many habits that are attached to that\nidentity that it makes it hard to even\nshift it and\none of my favorite quotes and i'm\ncurious what your thoughts are around it\nis alan watts says you're under no\nobligation to be who you were five\nminutes ago but the problem with that is\nthat i i'm curious with you do you feel\nlike people if there's a massive shift\nlike if someone has a heart attack they\ncan literally decide to be a different\nperson with a different identity with\ndifferent habits but majority of time\nit's like you said they kind of go out\nof them and then they come back in them\npeople will lose 100 pounds and then\nthey'll gain a hundred pounds back\nthey'll win the lottery and then they\nlose all of their money so do you find\nthat a lot of times it's because of the\nstory that they're attached to the\nidentity behind everything that kind of\nthey can go out of it and then it pulls\nthem right back into it well right i\nthink those stories are so powerful and\nthey're operating behind the scenes so\nwe're not even aware that we're telling\nourselves that story my ted talk is all\nabout how you change your story and one\nof the things that i say both in the\nbook and the talk is that a lot of\npeople think they're coming to therapy\nto get to know themselves but i feel\nlike what you're doing when you come to\ntherapy is you're coming to unknow\nyourself\nto get rid of that old story that is not\naccurate doesn't work for you\num doesn't fit anymore so a lot of\npeople are telling themselves these\nstories like i'm unlovable or i can't\ntrust anyone or nothing will ever work\nout for me or i'm the whatever kind of\nperson right um which is some kind of\nstory that maybe doesn't really reflect\nwho they are so it's really teasing out\nwho who do you think you are what are\nthese stories what are these myths that\nyou're telling yourself about yourself\nso that you can get a much clearer\npicture of who you really are and that\ngives you freedom that opens up\npossibility first thing you said was\nthat i'm unlovable and i feel like\nthat's that hits home for a lot of\npeople you know with with my podcast i\nget a lot of emails of people just\nsaying they just talk so much trash\nthemselves they say stuff to themselves\nthey would never say to someone that\nthey love ever\none of my friends jay shetty did a great\nvideo and he had women write down they\nwere probably in their 20s and 30s and\nthey had them write down all the\nnegative stuff they say to themselves\nand then they didn't know but in the\nother room was their little sisters that\nare teenagers and he had him come out\nlike you know eight to probably 15. he\nsaid i want you to say this to them and\nthey're like i could never do that you\nknow and so what is that why do people\nget stuck in that story of i hear it all\nthe time and i feel like it's so common\nthat they just talk\nso crappy themselves all of the time and\nthen they get stuck in this loop of\nthat's all that they know that they\ndon't even know how to pull themselves\nout of that loop to talk positive\nhimself so people are so unkind to\nthemselves and i had a very similar\nexperience where i had a client come to\nme and she was so clearly self-critical\nbut she didn't think she was being\nself-critical we have these voices in\nour heads that speak to us all day long\nso when i when i'm doing events and i'll\nsay to people on you know from the stage\num who is the person that you talk to\nmost in the course of your life show of\nhands is it your partner is it your best\nfriend is it your sibling tons of hands\nfor that but if i say no actually the\nperson that you talk to most in the\ncourse of your life is yourself people\ngasp and they gasp because they know\nit's true\nand so i had this client come in and she\nsaid oh no i'm not like that i don't i'm\nnot you know harsh on myself well i said\ni want you to write down everything that\nyou say to yourself over the course of a\nfew days and then come back next week\nand we'll talk about it so she does the\nassignment she comes back the next week\nand she starts to read it and she says i\ncan't even read this i am such a bully\nto myself\nand there were things like she was just\nyou know going about her day and she\nmade a typo in an email and she said\nyou're so stupid you're such an idiot\nshe said that to herself who would think\nthat because you made a typo um you\nwouldn't think that of your friend if\nyour friend made that typo or she saw\nher reflection in in a mirror and she\nsaid oh my god you look terrible today\nbut she did not look terrible um and you\nwouldn't think that or none of her\nfriends would think that if they if they\nlooked at her and so i think it's really\nimportant to ask yourself to listen for\nthat voice because that voice is guiding\nall of the choices and decisions that\nyou make about what's possible for you\nwhat you can achieve who you can be with\nwhat your value is that voice is\ndictating all of that and you don't even\nknow that it's there so i say to people\nlisten for that voice and then ask\nyourself is it kind is it true and is it\nuseful\nand if that voice whatever your voice is\nsaying to you doesn't meet those three\ncriteria\nstop listening to that voice is it kind\nis it true is it useful do you feel like\nthat's learned for people to talk the\nway them that way to themselves do you\nfeel like maybe it's i mean everybody\nwants to go back to believe their\nparents but it could be their parents it\ncould be society it could have been an\naunt or a brother do you feel like\nthat's that's something people learn to\nbe negative to themselves or is it just\nnatural for humans to compare themselves\nand go oh well i'm fat because i don't\nlook like that woman on instagram\ni think it's learned both in your family\nof origin and also in the culture so\nyou're gonna get it from somewhere\nbecause we're not born um sort of hating\non ourselves for sure\nso so what happens is um you know that\nvoice came from somewhere you know\nsomebody was giving you these messages\nand if they weren't let's say that you\ngot really good modeling in your family\ngrowing up the culture will do that to\nyou the culture will say you're not\nsuccessful enough you're not attractive\nenough you're not this enough you're not\nbad enough and the problem with\ncomparison is that it does one of two\nthings either you look at somebody else\nlet's say you're scrolling through\ninstagram right and you say i am less\nthan i'm not i'm not good enough and so\nyou feel inferior or you scroll through\nand you do that kind of schadenfreude\nthing where you say oh look i'm more\nsuccessful than this person because this\njust happened to me and that's a\nnarcissistic place to be it's not it's\nnot true a true sense of your worth\nand so i think when we talk about\ncomparison it's really important to\ncompare yourself to yourself where am i\ntoday compared to yesterday how am i\ndoing in terms of my goals for myself\nand do they align with my values and who\ni want to be in the world\ni love that and it makes me\nreal curious when you talk about all\nright so we could talk trash to\nourselves or\nwe could see somebody and compare\nourselves in a narcissistic way build\nourselves up but it seems like both of\nthose could come from a lack of\nself-worth right right that's like false\nself is so so can you dive more into\nthat and explain the the both sides of\nthat because both of them it seems like\neither oh my god i don't look like her\nor she must starve herself or something\nlike that can come from a place of low\nself-worth right\nyeah those are sort of defense\nmechanisms that we use so the one of is\nthe superiority is a defense mechanism\num you know it's those people who say\nlike somebody has something that you\nwant and you say oh i would never want\nthat\neven though you actually really want\nthat people are so afraid to feel those\nthose kinds of messy feelings like you\nknow sadness anxiety envy um i always\nsay about envy it's a great thing to\nnotice your envy because i always say\nfollow your envy it tells you what you\nwant it gives you a sense of desire so\nthat doesn't mean that you you feel\nenvious and then you you you go to this\nplace of self-loathing it means you use\nit to say what does that tell me about\nsomething that i want in my life and\nwhat are the steps that i can take to\nget my version of that the one that\nwould look right for me or feel right\nfor me\num as opposed to just you know denying\nthe envy because then you won't go after\nwhat you want or just bathing in\nself-loathing because you don't have\nwhat you want it's a really active\nprocess when you say how can i use my\nenvy and i feel like all of our feelings\nare like a gps system they tell us what\ndirection to go in and if we pretend\nthat we're not feeling something it's\nlike walking around with a faulty gps\nyou never know what direction to go in\nthat's so good hey you're the hiring\nexpert at your company and what

that\nis athleticgreens.com\ndial\nthe the one thing that i'm curious of\nthat you said is a little bit of the\nguilty side in there because what i\nnotice is that people it's the spiral\npeople go down right so it's like they\nsee something\nthey judge it or they judge the other\nperson or they judge themselves and then\nthey don't feel good and now they judge\nthemselves for doing that and they guilt\nthemselves for being that type of person\nso\nwith with that spiral i know the first\nthing is probably there's some\nself-awareness that needs to be there\nbut if someone notices because i feel\nlike we i talk about this a lot in my\npodcast of you've got to become software\nyou've got to notice you've got as dr\njoe depends says take yourself out of\nthe jar and read the label\num if somebody notices themselves in\nthat spiral is there some sort of tips\nor strategy that you typically use to\nget someone out uh wants to become\nself-aware\nyeah i mean the thing to ask yourself is\nwhat can i learn what am i learning\nright now from this feeling what is this\nfeeling telling me so to have a better\nrelationship with your feelings meaning\nthat your feelings are not the enemy\nthey're actually your friend and if you\nstart to feel something that makes you\nuncomfortable you welcome that feeling\nbecause that's going to help you\nunderstand something about yourself that\nmaybe you hadn't been aware of before so\nyou have a reaction to something you see\nout in the world what is that telling me\nabout myself right now what can i learn\nfrom this about me not about the other\nperson but about me\nso would you say that that\nthe best thing is at that point just hey\nget curious instead of instead of start\nstart getting mad it's just more like\nhey get curious about what's going on in\nthis moment well right instead of\njudging yourself have compassion for\nyourself i think self-compassion is so\nimportant because we can't grow without\nself-compassion a lot of people think\nthe opposite they think i have to\nself-flagellate to hold myself\naccountable to be really hard on myself\nso that then i can achieve and succeed\nand meet all of my goals but it turns\nout that people don't function well when\nthey are being harassed by themselves or\nby anybody else i mean think about it as\na parent with kids if you if you say to\nyour kid you know how did you get this\ngrade that's terrible versus oh let's\nunderstand what that mistake was about\nand let's try to understand what the\nchallenge was here so that we can figure\nout what might work better next time\nthat kid is going to succeed so much\nmore if they're approached from a place\nof curiosity as opposed to a place of\nyou did badly or you are bad and so we\ndo that to ourselves as adults that we\nwe aren't compassionate with ourselves\nwe don't say okay well you know i i wish\ni had done this differently or i wish\nthat i were at this point in my life or\nwhatever it is what can i learn right\nnow how can i get curious about myself\nand that's self-compassion you can't do\nthat when you're telling yourself that\nyou're that you're not good enough that\nyou're bad that you're worthless that's\nnot a place\nfrom which you can grow yeah and the the\nwhole idea of of finding out your story\nand realizing where you're kind of stuck\ntry to get yourself unstuck\nthe thing that's i have a friend i've i\nhave a lot of friends that come to me\nand just ask me a question and kind of\nthrow their life stuff at me right and\num and one of them has an issue with one\nof their parents\nand we're talking about how you know\nwe're at the i feel like there's once\nyou kind of get over the age of 18 20 22\nyears old it's hard to change but as you\nget older and older and older i feel\nlike it gets even more stuck\nwhere people get stuck and they're like\nthis is how i am and you know they blame\neverybody else but themselves for their\nanger or their sadness or their worry or\nwhatever else their fear that's going on\nwith all the stuff that's happening in\nthe world right now do you find that\nit's as somebody gets older it's\nharder for them to change or it's just\nit's just dependent on everyone every\nsingle person's situation and i list i\nhave a lot of listeners that are all\nages so i have people go up to 75 80\nyears old so some of them i hear i i had\na uh\nliterally a course that i went through\nand someone was 96 that went through the\ncourse right so it's like even at 96\nsomebody wants to change and get better\nbut i mean with with age do you feel\nlike you see more people that kind of\nget stuck in who they are in the story\nthat they built for themselves\ni think what's great about being human\nis that you can change at any age and\nmaybe you should talk to someone there's\nsomeone that i see who's about to turn\n70 and her life has been extremely messy\nand unhappy up to that point to the\npoint that she doesn't want to live\nanymore and so much changes in her life\nover just the course of a year\nand so i think that when people are\nready that change can happen at any age\nand i don't mean that you can change the\npast and so i think you know one of the\nbig things is that people come into\ntherapy and they're kind of like you\nknow they want to redo on their\nchildhood somehow or they want to redo\non some period of their lives and they\nwon't move forward because they're so\nfixated on i want i want this to have\nhappened differently as opposed to okay\nnow that that happened here's where you\nare now in the present what can we do\nmoving forward\nand so you don't you don't get a redo\nand it's true that as you get older more\nthings have happened but i also think\nthat as you get older you become much\nmore aware of our limited time on this\nplanet you become much more aware of our\nmortality and that's a huge motivation\nto make change and to make change\nquickly because you realize that you\ndon't have all the time in the world to\ndo it\nso do you recommend for people that are\nstuck on their past and they've been\nstuck for a long time\nto try to sit down and find the lessons\nthat come from it and how they can grow\nand become a better person or to look\nback and\nforgive or to look back and go it you\nknow it is what it is there's nothing i\ncan do like what is the what's the\nprocess of looking back to the past\nobviously it could take a lot of\nsessions to do something like this but\nlook back in the past and kind of just\nlet the past be the way that it is\nversus feeling like i wish it would have\nbeen different or i wish i would have\nacted different than she wouldn't have\nleft me or whatever it is that that's\ngoing on\ni think that so many people spend time\non the what ifs that they don't spend\nenough time on the what is\nand so what happens is they spend a lot\nof time thinking about how could i redo\nthis thing from the past um and what it\ndoes is it prevents them from actually\nliving in the present you're not\nactually\nalive in the present there's a big\ndifference between being alive and not\ndead right and um\nand and meaning meaning you can be alive\nright um and really live and be someone\nwho's vibrant and and lives in the\npresent or you can be not dead and\nyou're living in the past and you're\nyou're living through all these other\nexperiences but you're not present for\nyour life right now and then people have\nmore regret later because they say i\nspent all of those years regretting my\npast instead of living in the present\nyeah um i think that that you know i\ntalk in the book about the difference\nbetween idiot compassion and wise\ncompassion i think that's relevant here\nbecause\nwhat a therapist will do is is really\nhold up the mirror to you and help you\nto see yourself\num in in a way that your friends won't\nso your friends will say you know you'll\ncomplain about the same thing over and\nover with your friends my parents this\nmy partner this my boss this and your\nfriends will say yeah they're wrong\nyou're right that's terrible that's\nidiot compassion because if your friends\nreally listen to you they'll probably\nhear a pattern where you are feeling a\nlot like a victim and i'm not saying\nthat difficult things didn't happen to\nyou it's that you are are putting\nyourself in a position of helplessness\nwe call them help rejecting complainers\npeople who they say they want help but\nreally what they just want to do is\ncomplain\nand it's very hard to help a help\nrejecting complainer\nand so your friends will give you idiot\ncompassion you know but but really if a\nfight breaks up in every bar you're\ngoing to maybe it's you but your friends\nare not saying that you know if you're\nseeing this all across the board in all\nyour relationships or all your\nsituations in therapy a therapist is\ngoing to offer wise compassion where\nthey're going to really help you to\nunderstand how it's serving you to keep\ntalking about the same thing from the\npast where you're not moving forward in\nany way and you're ignoring your life in\nthe present so what are you afraid of\nwhat are you terrified of facing right\nnow what will it mean to say wait a\nminute i'm free my own therapist and i i\ni have the illustration in the book too\num brought up this beautiful cartoon\nwith me where he said you remind me of\nthis cartoon and it's of a prisoner\nshaking the bars desperately trying to\nget out but on the right and the left\nit's open\nno bars the prisoner is not in jail so\nmany of us feel that way we feel like\nwe're trapped by our circumstances our\nsituation the people in our lives so\nwe're shaking the bars but really we can\njust walk around the bars we're free so\nthe reason that people don't walk around\nthe bars is because with freedom comes\nresponsibility if we walk around the\nbars we are responsible for our lives we\nare responsible for our happiness we are\nresponsible for the choices and\ndecisions that we make we are\nresponsible for our reactions for our\nbehaviors and we can't blame anyone else\nanymore oh my god that's so good because\ni feel like\nthere was a a picture i saw not too long\nago and it was a looked like a\npolitician as a cartoon politician he\nwas had a whole bunch of people and says\nwho wants change and everybody raised\nher hand and then the next one said who\nwants to change and everybody's hand was\ndown\nit's kind of like everybody especially i\nfeel like nowadays you know there's so\nmany people that are on this side or\nthat side and this belief or that belief\nit seems like everybody wants everyone\nelse to change around them and they\nnever actually want to accept as you're\nsaying the responsibility of maybe that\nif i change i can change my\ncircumstances which kind of goes back to\nyou know the the ghandi quote be the\nchange you want to see in the world and\nthat's one of the things that that you\nyou say quite often\nis that you know people want change but\nthey want someone outside of them to\nchange when in reality they need to\nrealize that part of them needs to\nchange in order for that change to\nhappen right that's right so i see that\na lot when couples come in so couples\ncome in and usually what's the problem\nthe other person yeah right and so what\ni do with couples is before they come in\ni say i want you to write down\nwhat you want to do what work you want\nto do on yourself in this therapy to\nimprove this relationship so it's not\nabout what you know whatever the other\nperson does is not going to be relevant\nhere to your goals your goals are about\nhow can you\nmake change and a specific change\nbecause we all know that even if the\nother person needs to change too that we\nreact to them in a certain way that is\nnot helping that actually exacerbates\nthe the situation\nso it's really important to say what can\ni do to change you can't change another\nperson but you're changing yourself can\ninfluence another person and help them\nto want to change because you're\nreacting to them in a different way now\nfor sure\none of the um the things that i love\nthat you had said is\nis i think you said it was one of your\nyour clinical supervisors said before\nyou diagnose someone with depression\nmake sure they're not surrounded by\n which is like made me laugh out\nloud as soon as i heard it um how much\ndo you feel like\nthe person's environment plays the way\nthat they show up the way that they are\nand then do you often give you know\nadvice of hey maybe you should remove\nyourself from this group of people in\norder to make massive change in your\nlife because you're pulling you back\nwhat's interesting is that when we're\nyounger we don't get to choose our\nenvironment but when we're adults we do\nand i think sometimes we forget that and\nso what happens is people recreate a\nsituation that seems very similar to the\nenvironment that they did not want to be\nin when they were younger and now that\nthey have a choice they end up\nsurrounding themselves with friends with\nromantic partners with co-workers who\nare very similar to you know whatever\ndynamic they they were experiencing\ngrowing up and so why would people do\nthat you know you wonder why would you\ndo that when you when you're an adult\nyou can finally choose the people that\nyou want to be around why would you\nchoose people who are who are not\nhealthy for you yeah and and the answer\nis again going back to the familiar that\nour unconscious has this pull toward the\nfamiliar if we don't work out our stuff\nso we like to say you know we marry our\nunfinished business yeah\nand and i think that we we do that with\nour friendships too we choose friends\nbased on our unfit we choose you know\nour unfinished business for our friends\nif you work on that that is not\nunfinished business anymore and now\nyou're not going to have this pull\ntoward recreating that situation that\nyou had before and the idea is that if\nyou recreate that situation that you had\nbefore that somehow you're going to\nmaster at this time that's why we do it\nas adults but it doesn't work out that\nway you're just going to put yourself in\nthat same position\nof how you felt when you were younger\nhelpless\num you know sad anxious unheard unseen\nmisunderstood all of that\nso is it do you feel it's fully\nsubconscious that somebody would go like\nso for instance\nsomebody could marry a woman and then go\noh they're a lot like my mom like\nwhat do they notice is is it a lot of\ntimes where it's just fully\nthere's there's aspects of this person\nthat they're dating that they don't\nrealize remind them so much of their mom\nbut they marry them because they feel\nlike that's the familiar and this is\nsomething i need to work on and this is\nall subconscious or do you feel like\nsometimes that is it is conscious as\nwell\nwell if they haven't worked out their\nunfinished business then there's this\npull toward people who maybe look\ndifferent on the surface so when you\nfirst meet them it's different but you\nhave this intense chemistry with them\nand you're really drawn to them and when\nyou have that really strong feeling of\nlike i'm really pulled to this person\ni'm really drawn to this person and it\nfeels um ungrounded\nthen you might say wait a minute is this\nis this something more than who this\nperson is is this is this the past and\nthe present coming together or is this\njust the present um so sometimes what\npeople think of as chemistry is actually\na pull toward some\nneed to resolve some unresolved dynamic\nfrom the past through this person who\nwill who will recreate that situation\nfor them again in an unhealthy way again\npeople don't generally look like that\nperson so if you grew up with an angry\nparent you're not going to probably pick\nsomeone who on the surface seems angry\nbut then as you get to know that person\nyou see wow that person really has a\ntemper issue or you know if you grew up\nwith an alcoholic parent you're probably\ngoing to choose someone who you know\ndoesn't seem like they have addiction\nissues but they have other kinds of\nissues that are very similar to\naddiction issues this episode is brought\nto you by public goods the one-stop shop\nfor sustainable high-quality everyday\nessentials made from clean ingredients\nat an affordable price

like\nbecause so say for instance somebody has\nan alcoholic father and then they they\nget into a relationship with someone has\naddiction issues do you think that\nthere's a part of them that's like i\ncouldn't fix my father so now i think\nthat i can save and fix this person 100\nyes that's exactly what it is\nright and so we're just pulled to those\ntypes of people and feel like we got to\nfix them and and that's our you know\nbecause we can't i guess as a child you\ncan't change your parents obviously\nhumans want to have control and when you\ndon't have control and what could what\ncould be a situation where you have less\ncontrol than being a child\nwith a parent who doesn't have control\nover their own lives and so you have\nthis parent who's out of control you\nfeel very out of control as a child\nbecause you can't control the situation\nand then you grow up and you say i'm\ngonna make sure i'm never in that\nvulnerable situation again where i don't\nhave any control and then you end up\nbeing drawn to someone where you feel\nlike i'm going to have so much control\nthat i'm going to fix them\nso is it kind of like you know my my\nfather was alcoholic and so he passed\nwhen i was 15 from being an alcoholic\nand so when i i've done a lot of therapy\nand then psychedelics around it one\nthing that i put my my childhood was\nuncertainty right\nand then i realized through a lot of\nwork that i've built my entire life to\nbe as certain as possible and the\nproblem with that then you try to\ncontrol every situation and every person\nand that just ruins relationships for\nfor people so i think there's a lot of\npeople that are out there that are going\noh like i'm looking at my spouse my\nboyfriends and girlfriends that i've had\nin the past and i'm starting to notice\nthat i'm in a relationship or have been\nrelationships with these people so\nwhat's i know because you do a lot of\ncouples therapy what's the when\nsomeone's in that situation when they\nfind out they're with somebody that has\naddictive personality or you know\naddictions that they go oh man i\nactually subconsciously have been\nwanting to fix this person\ndo you recommend like how because i\nguess the the way i'm trying to phrase\nthe question excuse me is\nwe just said you can't change the person\nso now you're in a relationship with\nthis person so we're talking about\nchanging yourself before changing the\nperson so\ndo you try to change yourself to change\nthe dynamic of that relationship and\nhope that they change or is the best\nthing a lot of times just to get out of\nthe relationship and seek somebody\ndifferent\ni think that the beauty of adulthood is\nthat you're now with somebody where\nyou're in the adult position so you're\nnot in a helpless childhood position so\nyou can set boundaries and you can set\nexpectations\nand boundaries are something that you\nset with yourself by the way you you\nknow a lot of people misconstrue\nboundaries they think a boundary is um\nif you do this you know you can't do\nthis this is a boundary i'm telling you\nyou can't do this and what a boundary\nactually is is you tell the person what\nyou want or need\nand they either can do it or choose to\ndo it or choose not to do it or can't do\nit but you choose your response your\nboundaries with yourself if this person\ncan't give me what i want or need then\nwhat is my decision what am i going to\ndo\nand and that's where it's really\nimportant especially where people try to\ndrag you into their\ntheir stuff um that's not yours\nso um in those couples where you say oh\nwow you know there are a lot of aspects\nof this person that i love but there are\nalso aspects of this person\nthat remind me a lot of the things that\nwere very detrimental to me in my\nchildhood and are detrimental to me now\nyou talk with that person and you say\nlook\nthese are the things that that i want or\nneed and this is what my response is\ngoing to be um you know and at a certain\npoint if you're with somebody who's an\naddict and they're not going to do\nanything about it you might choose to\nnot be in that relationship um you know\nit's a totally different ballgame if\nthey are going to do something about it\nbut again you get to choose\nwhat is okay for you and what is not\nokay for you and you can't um you can't\ndictate to somebody else how they should\nlive their lives you can tell them\nwhat's important to you and they're\ngoing to live their lives how they live\ntheir lives and vice versa they're going\nto tell you\num what is important to them you know a\nlot of people we talk about safety in\nrelationships and a lot of people say in\norder you know let's say that someone\ncheated on someone in a past\nrelationship right and now you're with\nthis new person who has never cheated on\nyou or anyone else but you hold them\naccountable for the crimes of the other\nperson that you dated before\nand so every time that person goes out\nyou know the person says you have to\ntext me where you are or you're not\nallowed to have friends of the opposite\nyou know\nsex or you know whatever it is that's\nunreasonable so that person's saying for\nmy safety you need to do all of this\nyou are you know perfectly\ncapable of saying to that person\nno you know i i know you have trust\nissues and i know you want to feel safe\nbut i can't make you feel safe by not\nliving my life i can't make you feel\nsafe in that way i can make you feel\nsafe by by being trustworthy because\nthat's what i am\nbut i can't make you feel safe by doing\nthings that feel unhealthy to me like\nhaving to text you every minute that i'm\naway from you type of thing and that\ntends to be for the person who wants the\ntext message it tends to be\nself-sabotage in every relationship they\ngo into because with restriction and i\nwant to dive into it because one of the\nthings you say that people want more\nthan anything else is freedom that they\nput two buckets into in therapy is\nfreedom and change but for the person\nwho wants freedom but then they go out\nwith a girl goes out with their friends\nand she's gotta text every hour and let\nthe guy know where he where she is she's\ngonna go through this i don't wanna i\nlove this guy but\ni don't wanna feel restricted in every\nsingle thing that i do\nand people tend to have these\nself-sabotaging relationships and\ncircumstances that they kind of carry\nthrough without with them their entire\nlife until they i guess unconsciously\nbring the subconscious to the conscious\nand go wow yeah this thing is\nreally actually holding me back is that\ntypically what you find as well yeah\nthat they actually create the very thing\nthey're terrified of having happened\nthat's great so so you know they're\nthey're with the person and they say oh\nmy gosh you know i i have a fear of\nabandonment and i don't want to be\nabandoned and then they do everything\npossible\num to make sure the person won't abandon\nthem but in doing that that person feels\nso restricted that a certain point they\nabandoned them not because they didn't\nlove them but because they say i can't\nbe in this kind of relationship\nthat's crazy\nalmost like it's almost like they\nguarantee their own unhappiness by\ntrying to protect themselves from the\nthing that they think is going to be\ncatastrophic for them\nand it's kind of like the going back to\nthe whole parent thing as well it's kind\nof like the idea of you know i've heard\nthe phrase of fathers you should you\nshould raise your daughter the same way\nthat you want uh her to marry is kind of\nthe idea is because they're going to\nmarry somebody that's a lot like you\nand um and it's interesting to me\nbecause so many people\ni have a friend who's dealing with uh\nparents that are getting one of her dad\nhas extreme anger issues right and um\nit's interesting to see\nwhat seems like\nchild trauma\ncome up in someone who\nis an adult like a full adult and i'm\ncurious with with anger and with emotion\nwith sadness and all of these things do\nyou tend to find that\nlike in in this case someone who's\nextreme got extreme anger issues that a\nlot of times this is something\nthat's carrying from their childhood\nwhere maybe\nthey didn't get a popsicle when they\nwere three years old and they got\nextremely angry and the parents are just\nlike i've had enough just give them a\nfreaking popsicle and then they it kind\nof clicks in their head of oh if i get\nangry i get what i want and they they\nkind of bring this or if i get emotional\ni go to when they and they kind of\nperpetuate this from childhood into\nadulthood and they're they're completely\nunaware of these things\noh yeah absolutely i mean i think that's\nwhere we learn about relationship is in\nour homes when we when we were growing\nup um and so there's a lot of unlearning\nthat some people have to do other people\ngot great learning in their childhood\nhomes and and they bring that into their\ninto their adult world but definitely\nand i think you have to be aware of that\nbut i think that one thing that even in\nsort of the best of environments one\nthing that happens culturally so outside\nof you know your parents might might\nhave been incredibly good role models\nfor you but at the same time one thing\nthat i think the culture does is even\nfor the best of parents\nit shapes the way we we interact and so\nwhat i see in the therapy room is that\nthere's this difference between how men\npresent and how women present and when\nyou talk about fathers and their kids um\ni think that men are really afraid of\nbeing vulnerable with their emotions\nthat they still feel like they need to\nbe the stoic one they need to be the\nrock they need to be the strong one\nwhatever that means to them because\ninterestingly being strong does not mean\nstuffing down your feelings but somehow\nwe've come to conclude that in our\nculture and so when men come in to see\nme they're all they'll often say\nsomething like you know i've never told\nanyone this before and they seriously\nhave never told a soul about whatever\nthe issue is that they're thinking about\nyou know and it's a very sort of like\ncommon issue and they think they're the\nonly one\nand women will come in and they'll say\ni've never told anyone this before\nexcept for my mother my sister my best\nfriend right so they've told a few\npeople but they feel like they haven't\ntold anyone because they have permission\nto be vulnerable and so i see this in\ncouples therapy where let's say it's a\nheterosexual couple and um the woman\noften will say to the man some version\nof um you know i just i want to feel\ncloser to you i don't feel connected to\nyou i want to know more about what's\ngoing on inside i want you to share with\nme what you're feeling\nand then he does\nand let's say he starts crying\nand she will inevitably look at me like\na deer in headlights like i didn't feel\nsafe when you weren't sharing with me\nbecause i didn't feel close to you i\nfelt like there was this gap this big\nyou know gap between us\nbut i don't feel safe when you're\nsharing too much with me like you're\ncrying in front of me right she doesn't\nuse those words until we start talking\nabout it but you can see her body tense\nup like she doesn't know what to do like\nhe's crying does she hug him but she\nkind of recoils she knows she's supposed\nto move toward him and she does but it's\nvery mechanical um\nand so i think we need to give men\npermission to be vulnerable and see that\nas the strength that it is and so when\nwe're raising our kids if you think\nabout fathers um you know i'm not saying\nyou know break down crying for either\nparent you know in front of your kids\nalthough if you are sad there's nothing\nwrong with letting them see\nyou be sad in reaction to something that\nis sad but i think just in in in\nwatching you sort of like talk about\nfeelings that that's not like sort of\nlike go talk to your mom about that you\nknow that you are available for that\nthat you can share that you can engage\nin those kinds of conversations\nthat's how that that child is going to\ngrow up and feel whole and feel able to\nbe fully present with their partners\nwhen they're older yeah it's almost like\nin our culture emotion is very\nlike especially for men but i also think\nit's just for everybody emotion is kind\nof shamed a lot of times one of the\nthings that i notice\nis if somebody starts crying almost\nalways they say i'm sorry they have to\napologize for having feelings\nand um\ndo you feel like that's something that's\njust in the culture where they're just\nwe're not supposed to we're more of like\nhead culture versus heart culture and uh\nor do you feel like it's just people\nthat are embarrassed by the fact that\nthey're crying and you're not crying\ni think it's so interesting because even\nin the therapy room where you would\nexpect there are tissue boxes right\nthere so you know that it's okay to cry\nthere um that people will apologize\nthey'll start crying and they will\napologize on a therapist couch for\ncrying while they're talking about\nsomething painful yeah so i think that's\nso interesting and i think what happens\nis people then stuff down their feelings\nand and what happens is if you don't\ngive your feelings some air they will\ncome out in other ways so they come out\nin too much food or too much alcohol\nor\num you know a short-temperedness or\ninsomnia or difficulties in relationship\ndifficulty focusing that mindless\nscrolling through the internet right um\na colleague of mine said the internet\nwas um the most you know it was like um\nit was basically a painkiller right it\nwas like a non-prescription painkiller\nyeah um and so so what happens is the\nfeelings are there they're just you're\ntrying to numb them out but but numbness\nis not the absence of feelings numbness\nis actually a sense of being overwhelmed\nby too many feelings you're flooded and\nso you go numb\nand and and part of that is because of\nthe culture because the culture says uh\noh i'm feeling a lot i better not feel\nthis way i'm gonna seem weak or needy or\nyou know just pathetic\num as opposed to wow i really want to\nuse these feelings i really want to\nunderstand these feelings are going to\nhelp me understand what is not working\nright now what is not working in my life\nif you don't feel it's like if with our\nbody you know with our physical selves\nwe don't do that we don't say oh my gosh\ni gotta cut i'm gonna ignore it right\nright because you know you gotta like\nyou know you gotta disinfect it you\ngotta take care of it you gotta say okay\nhow did i get that cut i gotta be more\ncareful next time\nnow with your feelings instead what you\ndo is you say you're not like why am i\nsad or why am i anxious you're just like\ni don't want to feel the sadness or\nanxiety i'm going to go have a drink\nyeah\nyeah that's that's one thing that i find\nreal interesting because you know for my\nwhole my whole childhood like the reason\nwhy i got into this is because i was\ntrying to figure out my dad for so long\nand my dad was an alcoholic so i was\nlike i remember i was listening to gabor\nmate for a couple months ago a couple\nyears ago excuse me and he talks about\nthat almost all addictions come from\nsome form of trauma and it's like this\nwhole thing that's starting to come out\nand i was like i've always thought it\nwas this way because i knew that my my\ndad walked in the room when he was 12\nyears old after his dad shot himself and\nsaw it he just never overcame that but\nwhat's really interesting about us\npeople look at him and say oh he's an\nalcoholic or they look at someone's\noverweight and say oh they're just\nthey're just fat whatever it is but they\ndon't look at the other sides of like\npeople that are workaholics a lot of\ntimes they're numbing people that are on\ninstagram like you're saying all the\ntime is numbing alcoholics and drug\naddiction all that is is a form of\nnumbing and\nin i'm really curious\nwith the whole numbing that we have\none of the things that that that changed\nmy life was reading the book uh brene\nbrown's books of vulnerability and when\ni started this podcast\nin the first thing that i wrote down was\ni'm going to be as vulnerable as\npossible so that people feel like oh me\ntoo like there's not there's other\npeople that are going through the same\nstuff i'm going through i could have\nnever imagined that making 900 podcast\nepisodes would be the most cathartic\nthing i've ever done in my life is\nbecause i'm just giving my to\npeople and people are going yeah me too\nand and i still love you through it and\nso\nuh with with the numbing and and some\npeople want to go therapist some people\ndon't is it just safe to find somebody\nthat just doesn't judge you when you\nwant to break down and cry and just be\nable to share and or you know you were\ntalking a few few minutes ago about when\npeople share with their friends they\ndon't tell them what they need to hear\nis it that you need to go to that friend\nand say listen tell me all the things i\nneed to hear and be hard with me or like\nwhat is what is the the practical way to\nwork through these things when we're\nstarting to identify that we're numbing\nfeelings\nyeah that's that's so true i think it's\nreally important to choose your audience\nin terms of who is the person that\nyou're going to share with yeah a lot of\npeople what they do is they say well i\ndon't want to be vulnerable because i\nget burned when i'm vulnerable and what\nhappens is they go to the same person\nover and over who is doesn't know how to\nlisten who doesn't know how to be\npresent who doesn't know how to to sit\nwith them um and i think that it's\nreally important for us as as friends as\nfamily members as partners to know how\nto listen as well when people come to us\nso for example\num you know when somebody comes to you\nand they're talking to you about\nsomething it's important to say to them\nat the beginning of the conversation how\ncan i be helpful to you right now i'm\nhere with you how can i be helpful do\nyou just want to vent right now do you\nwant to hug do you want me to do you\nwant me to share what i'm thinking about\nthis or how i'm feeling about this um do\nyou want me to brainstorm ideas with you\nand and then the person reflects for a\nsecond oh wait a minute what do i want\nout of this conversation how what is it\nthat i'm needing now and it also opens\nthe door to the idea that there's not\njust one conversation that right now\nduring this 20 minutes um this is what i\nneed right now but maybe tomorrow i am\ngoing to want your thoughts on this or i\nam going to want your honest feedback\nabout this right and maybe right now i'm\nso raw because it just happened that i\njust want to tell you what happened\nright now and i just want you to sit\nwith me so it's really important to know\nhow to listen and to choose people who\nknow how to listen to you\num\nso i want to go back to with what you\njust said i want us to go back to\nthe man who cries in front of the woman\nand now she doesn't know what to do\nbecause i want to i want to kind of\nclose that loop because as you're\ntalking i'm like well damn\nwe need to bring this frame in if you're\nthe man wanting to speak to a woman and\nsay something\nbut also i think we might have just\nscared some of the men to be like oh\n i don't know if i can say this now\nto to her because i don't want to cry\nand be that person so is it is the man\ncome in in that frame and say hey listen\nlike you know i want to tell you\nsomething from my heart and you know in\nif i get emotional i just ask that you\ndon't judge me because of this\nand you know i'll be the strong\nman that i've always been in 20 minutes\nafter this in in how how would they\nframe that situation because it sounds\nlike now it's like oh my god i don't\nwant to make her think i'm not the rock\ndo you know what i mean because i don't\nit seems like it could offend her and\nmake her feel like oh it's not he's not\nstrong anymore you know right i'm going\nno only because of the way that you\nframed this thing about being strong\nthat you know in 20 minutes i'll be the\nstrong man no you're actually being the\nstrongest person you should be in that\nmoment by being vulnerable so i just\nwant to make sure that we don't\nreinforce that to the person we're\ntalking to when you go if you if you if\nyou are the man who says you know i\nreally want to talk to you about this or\num you know i i think the way to say it\nis hey you know what one of the things\nthat i think makes our relationship so\nstrong or can make it really strong is\nif we're both able to be really\nvulnerable with each other i think that\nthat would show a strength in our\nrelationship and a strength in each\nother\nand i want to be able to talk with you\nthat way how do you feel about that are\nyou okay with me really opening up to\nyou because i feel like\nthat that is a strength of mine to be\nable to do that and it would be a\nstrength in our relationship if we can\nreally\num create that space for each other yeah\nthat was a big reframe when i read brene\nbrown was she says\nyou know we think that when we go\nand open ourselves up and we're\nvulnerable that it shows that we're\ncompletely weak to everybody but in\nreality when we open ourselves up people\nlook at us and go man i wish i was that\ncourageous to be able to open up myself\nto everyone else yeah you know that's\nthat's so we started this podcast called\ndear therapists and somebody comes on\nand you hear a therapy session and then\nwe give them a concrete homework\nassignment that they have one week to do\nand then they come back and they tell us\nhow it went and they do it all we play\nit for you all in one episode so you can\nhear the whole story and and i think\nthat what you're saying about this idea\nof of you know strength and\nvulnerability is that we've gotten so\nmuch feedback this podcast has just sort\nof exploded because everybody's saying\noh my gosh i hear myself in this person\nand and they're talking about it and\nlook what happens when they try their\nhomework and they go and they talk to\nthe people in their lives about it and\nand how much it moves them forward and\nso even if it's not your exact situation\ni think the homework is applicable to\neverybody because basically it's about\nhow can i show up in a way that feels\nlike a strength to me and my partner\nwhereas before it felt like a source of\nshame or i was i was hesitant to do it\nor i thought i don't want to rock the\nboat or i didn't know how they would\nreact and so i think that the more that\nthat for example your podcast is out\nthere or my podcast or you know all of\nthese ways that people are seeing wait a\nminute this is universal we are we are\nall more the same than we are different\nand there's nothing to be ashamed of in\nfact being more human is going to lead\nto not only us having better lives but\nour society being a stronger society as\na whole\n[Music]\nyeah i love that and i love the the what\nyou're giving people the opportunity is\nwhat i always say is people just want to\ngo\nme too\nright like there's many times i've given\nspeeches and i've talked about my father\nand there's a couple hundred people and\nthen someone will come up say oh my gosh\ni i completely relate to you my mom used\nto beat me when i was younger i'm like i\ndidn't tell that story at all but you\nheard something in my story that made\nyou go oh i'm not the only one\nit was it was the emotional similarity\nit was the it was it was the feeling\nunderstood when again when i do couples\ntherapy you know you think that the that\nin a couple the three words that the\nperson wants to hear are i love you but\nreally the three words that the other\nperson wants to hear is i understand you\nthat is the most loving position to be\nin where you feel like i understand you\nto feel understood is what we all want\nand to feel understood by somebody with\nwhom you've been vulnerable from\nsomebody who really sees you for who you\nreally are your true self your authentic\nself say i understand you\noh that's like\nwhen you see when you see the reaction\nof someone in a couple when they feel\nunderstood by their partner in that deep\nway there's really nothing like that\nyeah that's amazing i don't think\nthere's any other way better to end than\nthat exact way right there so um\nthank you so much for your time this is\namazing um it was good to talk to you\nabout these things i think for a lot of\npeople they need this right now\nespecially with all that's happening in\nthe world so for people who want to find\nyou what's the best ways to find you out\nthere yeah well first of all just thank\nyou so much for the conversation i'm so\nglad that these conversations are\ngetting out in the world and um they can\nfind me at my website which is lori\ngottlieb.com they can check out my book\nwhich is called
