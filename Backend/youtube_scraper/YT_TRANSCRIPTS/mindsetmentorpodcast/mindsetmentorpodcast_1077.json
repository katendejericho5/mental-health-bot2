    "transcript": "stop doing things that you don't like i\ndon't know about you but for that\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nto find yourself and how to become who\nyou truly want to become and we're\nactually going to follow a format by a\nphilosopher who's now dead as most\nphilosophers are and his name is\nfriedrich nietzsche and friedrich\nnietzsche is a philosopher who\nthought way different than everybody\nelse did in the time that he was alive\nand so i'm going to go through the four\ndifferent steps and talk through them\nand give you my opinion on all of them\nas we go through them as well so let's\ndive into it the first tip that he says\nto find yourself is to don't follow the\nherd mentality and one thing that he\nsays that we've all\nwhat we call\nuniversal values what we call truths are\nalways only personal expressions from\nthe people who promoted them so the\nthings that we think are values and\nthings that we're supposed to follow and\nthings that we're supposed to do are\nonly personal expressions of those who\npromoted them and one of the things that\ni love thinking about it and what's\nreally made me kind of forget about the\nsystem that we've been raised in\neverything that i've been told and\nallowed me to think outside of the box\nis i realize that everything that i have\nbeen told to follow everything i've been\ntold is important everything i've been\ntold to do\nand everything that we follow with\nsociety of what we are or not supposed\nto do what's taboo what's not taboo is\nall made up by people that are no\nsmarter than you and i\n[Music]\nand they're usually dead that's the\ncrazy part about it so we're following a\nset of values and things that we're\nsupposed to societal constructs we're\nfollowing all these\nfrom a bunch of dead people\nthat decided to say something and do\nsomething and make something up one day\nthat we're no smarter than you and i and\ni don't know about you i don't want to\nlisten to any dead people i want to live\nmy life the way that i want to live it\nso what he's saying is don't follow the\nherd and it's tribal we're all tribal\npeople so we want to fit in we don't\nwant to not fit in but in order to\ncreate the life that we truly want to in\nlife that we see and know that we have\nthe potential of creating we're going to\nhave to not fit in right if you think of\nall of the people that you look up to\nsteve jobs or elon musk or nelson\nmandela\ni could go off and give you a ton of\ndifferent people go off on tangents and\njesus and buddha and all of the people\nthat you could look up to in your life\nthey were not people who fit in so why\ndo we feel like we need to fit in\nif we want to live an extraordinary life\nwe should probably follow other people\nwho had extraordinary lives the ones\nthat we look up to and if they didn't\nfit in\nthen we should think to ourselves i need\nto do whatever i can to not fit in as\nwell right because when we go with the\nherd mentality it limits our\nindividuality and it also limits our\ncreativity as well right how many people\nright now listening to this don't wear\nwhat you want to wear because it makes\nyou stand out in some way\nhow many people don't act the way that\nyou want to act or do the things that\nyou want to do simply because you're\nworried about the thoughts and opinions\nof other people\nright that is the herd mentality you are\nlimiting your full expression of who you\nare\nbecause you don't want to make other\npeople uncomfortable you're dimming your\nlight just to keep other people\ncomfortable i don't know about you but\nthat that's not what i want to do\nthink about that for a second\npeople don't stand out because they have\nthe fear of being rejected they have the\nfear of other people saying no to them\nthe fear of being ridiculed and i\nunderstand once we go back to the fact\nthat we are tribal beings we have a part\nof our brain that makes us want to\nactually fit in with everybody because\nif you go back 100 000 years ago 200 000\nyears ago when we had to be in a tribe\nwe literally had to survive the only way\nthat we could survive is through a tribe\nso we had to fit in or else we were\nbasically going to die they were there\nfor our safety they're there for our\nfood they're there for our community\nthey're there for protection everything\nso we have that part of our brain that\nstill exists\nbut in 2021 2022 beyond\ndo we really need to fit in with\neverybody else to survive no we have a\nsociety and systems built that we can\nsurvive without needing other people now\ni'm not saying just be a loner forever\nwhat i'm saying is if you don't fit in\nif the the future that you want to\ncreate doesn't fit in with the tribe\nthat you currently have you might have\nto leave that tribe and find a new one\nright\npeople don't create the life they want\nto\nthey're dimming their light\nsimply because they don't want to be\nrejected they don't want to stand out\nthey don't want to wear something\ndifferent they don't want to say a\ndifferent opinion because people will\nridicule you for standing out because\nyou're showing them\nwhere they're dimming themselves so\nlet's talk about that for a second the\nreason why people will will try to cut\ndown australians call it tall poppy\nsyndrome never been to australia but i\nhave a lot of australians that listen to\nme and they always talk about tall poppy\nsyndrome which is like if you look at a\npoppy field and there's one poppy that's\nsticking up higher than the other one\nyou have to cut it down and so one thing\nthat's that i've been told that this is\nwhat i've been told as part of their\nculture it's tall poppy syndrome you're\nnot supposed to stand out and if you do\nstand out you will be ridiculed in some\nway right and they ridicuted for\nstanding out because they feel like\nyou're showing off in some sort of way\nbut think about how many people don't\ncreate the life that they want they\ndon't have the life they want simply\nbecause they're worried about what they\ncall tall poppy syndrome but they're you\nknow of being ridiculed of you know\nbeing condemned this is but but the\nreason why tall poppy syndrome exists\nand all these different aspects can\nexist of not standing out\nand this is the reason also why haters\nexist is because they're jealous because\nwhen you stand out and you don't dim\nyour light\nyou're showing other people and they're\nbecoming aware of how they're dimming\ntheir light and that makes them\nuncomfortable to see somebody living to\ntheir full potential when they know deep\ndown inside they're not living to their\nfull potential so what do they need to\ndo they need to cut you down in some\nsort of way\nthey cut you down to make themselves\nmomentarily feel better about their\nexistence\nright\nthat's the reason why you don't want to\nfollow the herd the herd consists of\npeople who have in a sense killed their\ntrue self\nthey've killed their dreams they've\nkilled their goals in the life that they\nwant simply to fit in\nso if you want to create the life that\nyou want\nyou've got to get rid of that you've got\nto stand out you've got to be okay\nknowing\nthat there's a chance that some people\nare going to ridicule you they're going\nto try to make you feel insecure you've\ngot to have the mental fortitude to not\nlisten to them why do you think there's\nso many addictions\nwhy there's so many alcohol and drugs\nand food and sex and workaholism why\nbecause those things numb us from the\nfeeling that we're dimming our light\nreason why addictions exist is because\nthey numb and people are trying to numb\nthe feeling that they are not living the\nlife they truly want to and that they're\nkilling their dreams simply because\nthey're afraid of what other people\nmight think or because they don't want\nto stand out it is numbing\nright\nyou've got to realize that that's why so\nmany people when they finally follow\ntheir dreams\nthey get rid of their addictions because\nthey don't need to numb the feeling\nof\ni'm killing myself my dreams my life my\npotential because i'm simply just trying\nto fit in so the first part\n[Music]\nof how to find yourself is to don't fit\nin with the herd mentality right\nthe second part\nis to embrace the difficulty of\nself-discovery right as you start to\ndiscover yourself as you start to do\npersonal development as you start to\nwork on yourself\nthings are going to going to pop up\nand one of the things that friedrich\nnietzsche says is it's only when we're\nwilling to face the challenge of life\nthat we're spiritually growing\nright\nit's about taking the difficult path\ndistance distancing yourself from others\nwho aren't on the same path as you\nthat's what it requires of you the path\nof self-discovery means that you might\nhave to walk alone for a little while\nyou might have to leave the tribe that\nyou've been so close to to your entire\nlife\nit goes back to the you know as we go\ninto self-discovery and how it can be so\nhard is you kind of have to go into your\npast in order to to be the full\nexpression and to create the self that\nyou're trying to create you're gonna\nhave to get rid of the old things the\ntraumas the fears the worries all those\nthings that are holding you back and are\ngonna be slowing you down as you're\ncreating that right and it goes back to\none of my favorite quotes and it's the\nthe cave that you are afraid to enter\nholds the treasure that you seek\nthey say again the cave that you are\nafraid to enter holds the treasure that\nyou seek\nso let me ask you a question what cave\nare you afraid to enter\nthe life you want will only come by\novercoming the skeletons in your closet\nnot by acting like there are no\nskeletons in your closet not by acting\nthat there are no traumas that you need\nto overcome not by acting like there\nweren't people who bullied you or\nemotional neglect or physical neglect or\nmental or physical or sexual abuse\nleaving acting like those things never\nexisted are not going to help you going\nforward and creating life that you want\nyou've got to go back\nand relive those things and work through\nthem and so\ni had this this call with my mastermind\nand we talked about this the other day\nwhere it's kind of like if you've ever\ngone uh and the way i see trauma in\nunresolved trauma is it's kind of like\nif someone breaks a bone right the bone\ncracks in half and it goes back together\nbut it's not put together correctly\nright it's not put together correctly\nthere's going to be issues with that\nbone and so what do you have to do in\norder for that bone to heal correctly\nafter it's already healed you have to\nbreak it again and heal it correctly and\nso if something happened to me when i\nwas eight years old and i won't go back\nand look at that thing and try to\nreprocess it and try to work through it\ni'm still living i'm still stuck\nenergetically\nin my mind in my life\nprocessing that event as an\neight-year-old and i can tell you as a\n35 year old right now i was not as\nemotionally and intellectually\nintelligent as i am now\nso i can either forever live that trauma\nin that event as an eight-year-old in my\nlack of intellectual and emotional\nintelligence or go back now as a 35 year\nold and it's not gonna feel very good\njust like breaking a\nno another bone won't feel very good but\ni've got to go back and do it in order\nto heal properly and once i heal\nproperly i don't have to worry about it\nagain\nright once the bone heals properly the\nbone heals properly once you heal\nproperly you heal properly so that's why\nyou know he says you have to embrace the\ndifficulty of self-discovery\nit becomes hard sometimes but i promise\nyou this\nit is the path that you need to follow\nin order to create the life that you\nwant the cave that you're afraid to\nenter holds the treasure that you seek\nso what cave\nare you afraid to enter\nyou've got to figure out a way to get\ninto it\nokay so that's the second one number\nthree is to say yes to what gives you\nmeaning okay say yes to what gives you\nmeaning\nso one of the things that he says one of\nthe famous quotes that he has friedrich\nnietzsche has is he who has a why can\nbear almost any how\nhe who has a why can bear almost any how\nmy very first mentor used to say\nsomething very similar to this he said\nhe used to always say if your why is\nstrong enough your how will reveal\nitself\nright so say yes to what gives you\nmeaning\nwhat is it that gives your life meaning\nwhat is it that you love what is it that\nyou loved as a kid\nright what is it that makes you happy\none of the things that i find is that as\npeople get older they tend to act like\nthey're not a little kid anymore i'm 35\nyears old i still feel like i'm a little\nkid i guarantee with all of you guys you\ndon't feel as old as you are you always\nfeel like a little kid deep down inside\nand the reason why is because that\nlittle kid still lives inside of you and\nall of the things that you loved as a\nlittle kid you still love now it would\nstill bring you joy so what did you love\nas a kid\nhow many things have you\nmuted in yourself\nsimply because you feel like you're\ntoo old now you're older you're not\nsupposed supposed to do that once again\nanother societal construct based off of\nthe herd mentality right\nwhat makes you happy make a list of\nevery single thing that makes you happy\nbig small it could be you know seeing\nyour bank account grow it could be a cup\nof coffee in the morning it could be the\nsunshine right the sunshine makes me\nhappy\nright what is it that makes you happy\nand you make a massive list of every\nsingle thing every single thing that\nmakes you happy and i got this from a\nfriend of mine who uh was the number 13\nemployee at facebook and got fired from\nfacebook right before they went public\nand lost out on 180 million dollars\nbecause he got fired from facebook\nbefore they were public\nand he went into a mini depression after\nall of this happened because facebook\nwas like his life\nand one of the things that he said\nthat's a quote i don't think i'll forget\nthe rest of my life is that i will not\nlet my depression or my happiness be\nleft up to chance\nlet me say that again i will not let my\nhappiness or my depression be left up to\nchance what he means is that if i'm\ngoing to be depressed i'm going to be\nthe one that's in control of that\ndepression but if i'm going to be happy\ni'm going to be the one that's in\ncontrol of that happiness and so he did\nthis he made a list a happy list of\nevery single thing that he loves that\nmakes him happy and how did he get\nhimself out of his depression he made a\nmassive list of this happy list every\nsingle thing that he loved and then\nevery single day he would wake up and he\nwould look at that list and plan how he\ncan get as many of those things into his\nday as possible guess what if you have a\nbunch of things in your day that make\nyou happy it's pretty hard to be\ndepressed and so the way he got himself\nout of that depression was by bringing\nas much happiness into his life as he\npossibly could so do you have a happy\nlist what did you love as a kid what do\nyou love now what do you want to try\nwhat\nwhat what creativity makes you come\nalive what music makes you come alive\nwhat actions make you come alive right\nbring as many of those things into your\nday stop doing things that you don't\nlike\nright and some of you are going oh well\nthat sounds nice but you don't know my\nlife right okay cool we'll make a\ntransition plan\nmake a goal by 2023 i will not do\nanything that doesn't light me up inside\nwhy can you not do that give yourself a\ncouple years to work on on creating the\nlife that you want to\nand you can go okay do i have to do some\nthings in my business now that i want to\nyes do i have to do this things that i\nwant to yes but how can i transition\nthose things out over the next couple\nyears so that i don't have to worry\nabout them by 2023 is that possible for\neverybody yes the only thing that's\nholding you back from doing it though is\nyou\nso make a happy list and bring as many\nof those things into your life as\npossible say yes to what gives you\nmeaning and number four the fourth part\nof finding yourself is to know your true\nvalues not the values that have been\ntaught to you but what are your true\nvalues\nwhat are your values do you know what\nyour values are\nwho do you want to be not what do you\nwant to accomplish who do you want to be\nthink about that what makes you feel\nalive what makes you feel free what are\nyour true values write down everything\nand everyone that limits your freedom as\na person\nyour partner your friends your work your\nactions whatever it is that limits your\nfreedom and figure out a way to work\nthrough every single one of those\nin a way to think of your true values is\nthis\nquite simply we're all going to die one\nday\nhow do you want to be described at your\nfuneral when people walk up to the stage\nwhenever that day comes what do you want\nthem to say about you\nwhat do you want to say about you\nthink about that\nthat's your values\nnot what your parents told you to do not\nwhat your parents told you was right or\nwrong now what society has told you or\nright around not with your friends and\nevery construct has told you is right or\nwrong what are your true values how do\nyou want to be described\nevery single day\nwhen somebody when you walk away from a\ngroup how do you want people to talk\nabout you what do you want them to say\nabout you what do you want them to feel\nhow do you want to be described at your\nfuneral what those are your true values\nright so when you go in and you try to\nfind yourself one of those things is\nwhat is your true values and you wake up\nevery single morning you look at that\nlist of true values and you say how can\ni make myself more of this okay giving\ngiving is one of the values that i want\nto work on if that's the case how can i\ngive more today what can i do today to\ngive more and you work at bringing those\nthings into your life every single\nmoment\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind
