    "transcript": "what do i want in my life do you know\nwhere you're going how do i want people\nto talk about me at my funeral who do i\nwant to money\nwho do i want to marry you can marry\nmoney if you want to\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to turn your life around\nno matter where your life is right now\nso your life could be incredible it\ncould be doing great your life could be\nterrible it could be in the crapper or\nyour life could just be average we're\ngoing to talk about no matter where you\nare how to turn it around to actually\ncontinue to keep going in the direction\nthat you want to make better or to\nactually get in the direction that you\nwant and we're going to talk about more\nimportantly\nthan anything else where you're going\nbut first off before we dive into that i\nwant to i wanna let you know how crazy\nthis world is that we live in like\neverything's amazing in this world but\npeople tend to miss it right we live in\na world where everything happens right\naway like if you want some if i want any\nknowledge on anything that's ever\nexisted in the entire world i can\nliterally just say hey siri ask her and\nit'll automatically pop up right like\nthat's incredible\nif we want a product to be at our house\nand not even leave the house i can go on\namazon and it'll be here if it's on\namazon prime now it could be here in the\nnext two hours right if i don't want to\ndrive why don't i buy a car i can just\nhave somebody pick me up and literally\ndeliver my ass to some other place right\nif i want food it can be delivered to my\nhouse i don't want to go grocery\nshopping it can all be delivered to my\nhouse we live in a world where almost\neverything is fully completely instant\ngratification i can get it when i want\nit\nand we've been trained now because it's\nso simple and so easy to get everything\nright now that we think that everything\nshould be right now\nour happiness our success the million\ndollars in our bank account we think it\nall should be right now\nbut you have to realize that's not the\nway the world actually works and it's\nnot the way the world has worked for the\nmajority of the time the 3.5 billion\nyears that the world has been here let\nme give you a quick example\nif you wanted strawberries a hundred\nyears ago let me just take you through\nthe process of what it would cause what\nyou'd have to do to get strawberries 100\nyears ago you'd have to go buy the seeds\nhopefully you live in the right part of\npart of the world to be able to grow\nthem but you'd have to wait for the\nright time of year\nthen you'd have to plant the seeds you'd\nhave to water them every single day you\nhave to make sure that the sun gets to\nthem every single day you'd have to take\ncare of them for a few months\nthen they would start to grow and then\nthey would start to ripen and then\nhopefully by the time they ripen an\nanimal doesn't come and eat them the\nnight before they start to ripen and you\ndon't get to them but it could take i\nwant strawberries i could have\nstrawberries in six freaking months now\ni can literally sit on the couch on my\nphone and within two hours some kid\nnamed travis who's a student at the\nlocal university delivers them to my\ndoor the only thing he doesn't do is\nfeed them to me right like it's like\nimmediate we can get anything that we\nwant at any point in time and if i want\nstrawberries quicker i can literally\ndrive down and get them in five minutes\nfrom the grocery store so we've been\nindoctrinated to believe that everything\nhappens right away we've been\nindoctrinated to believe that this world\nworks through immediate gratification\nit's like i i want it i get it i want it\ni get it i want it i get it i want it i\nget it but so many things in life the\nmost important things in life are not\nimmediate gratification the most\nimportant things in life take time\nwhat does this have to do with today and\nturning your life from well today i'm\ngoing to be talking about the direction\nthat you're going in but more\nimportantly we're going to be talking\nabout the speed that you're going at as\nwell\nin so many people get an idea for\nbusiness or they get an idea for\nsomething\nlet's just use business as an example\nthey get an incredible idea for business\nand they're like oh my gosh i would love\nto have a fitness business for instance\nright so they're so excited they make\nthe business plan they buy the yoga\npants they get the all the stuff that\nthey need and they want to start this\nfitness business whatever they're going\nto be doing in fitness\nand then within three months\nthey've realized that their business is\nnot doing a million dollars a month yet\nand what do they do\nthey get down on themselves and they\nthink you know what this might not have\nbeen the right thing for me not\nrealizing that just like the strawberry\nseeds it takes\ngrowing time\nbusiness takes time you know we hear\nabout someone who starts an app and\nwithin six months they have a a billion\ndollar net worth and we think that's how\nbusiness works but it's not that's like\nthe very very small outliers that\nsomehow\nsomehow that happens right\nfor 99.9 of businesses 99.99 of\nbusinesses it doesn't happen like that\nit doesn't blow up it takes time it\ntakes years of work and work and work\nand so what i always tell people is\ndon't plan for three months plan for\nthree to five years because it'll take\nthree to five years most of the time for\nyour business to really be cranking not\nto make money you can make money you can\ndo pretty well you can\npay the bills within six to nine to 12\nmonths most of the time\nbut as far as like driving a lamborghini\nwithin the first three to six months\nprobably not going to happen and if you\nthink that you know you go on instagram\nyou guys talking about oh hey you can\nstart a you know a shopify account i can\nmake you millions of dollars you can\nstart a walmart account i can make you\nmillions of dollars you can start an\namazon account and make millions dollars\nit doesn't happen that fast right i have\nfriends that have super successful\nshopify stores their first one didn't\nhappen that fast first million dollars\ndidn't come within the first three\nmonths right i have friends that have\nreally successful amazon stores 15\nmillion of dollars in sales at least\nevery single year didn't happen in the\nfirst three months\neverything takes time\nso what i want you to realize in\nbusiness things are always going to take\ntime and one of the things that that\nthat becomes more and more true for me\nevery single time that i hear it and the\nlonger that i'm in business and the long\nthat i'm working my business is tony\nrobbins has a phrase that says people\nunderestimate what they can do in a\ndecade but they overestimate what they\ncan do in a year so most people think\nwithin this year i'm going to have a\nmillion dollar business\nit doesn't really happen majority of\ntime like that it takes time\nbut if you put five years into it ten\nyears into it a hundred percent could be\na million dollar business the question\nis do you have the patience in the work\nethic to keep going for that loan even\nwhen maybe the results aren't exactly\nwhere you want them to be at this point\nright so you got to think about that\nwhen i look back and you have to realize\nmost people within the first three\nmonths of starting the business six\nmonths to start the business\nthey're making mistakes like when i was\nin my first 3 6 12 24 months i was still\nmaking mistakes and still figuring out\nlike my first my my business the\nbusiness that i have was doing\nin its first year did it just under 80\n000 so not bad it was still pretty\ndecent i was able to pay my bills and\nkeep the lights on and pay expenses and\nall the stuff that i needed to\nbut\nyou know it took years for it to get to\nthe million dollar mark it took three\nyears actually for it to get to the\nmillion dollar mark right and once it\ndid then it took six months and then it\ntook three months and it continues to\nget shorter and shorter in time span but\nit's only because i worked my ass off\nfiguring things out messing things up\nfor three years that i was able to get\nit to that point so you gotta ask\nyourself are you willing to invest the\nnext three years four years five years\nto get this business up and running\nanother great story i always think of is\nandy fursella uh who has podcasts he\nruns a 100 million a year business\ncompany now he does a hundred million\ndollars a year\nbut he slept in his warehouse and barely\nbroke even for the first two years\nright so people look at him and they go\noh my gosh i want his life i want his\nhis lamborghini i want his massive\nmansion i want to make a hundred i want\nto run a 100 million dollar your\nbusiness as well that's what i want\nbut are you willing to sleep on the\nfloor in the warehouse\nbarely\nmaking it for the first two years in\norder to get there\nthat's what you really got to ask\nyourself and a lot of times most people\nare not most people are not ready to do\nthat so how bad do you actually want it\nyou have to rush it's going to take time\nand it's just like anything though it's\nnot just business relationships\nthey take time to build a great\nrelationship\nfriendships take time\nyou know to find\nthe the work that you're doing on\nyourself personal development it takes\ntime people always think when they get\ninto personal development like oh my\ngosh for the next six months i'm\nbasically going to be fully enlightened\ni'm going to basically be jesus or\nbuddha within the next six months right\nit doesn't happen that way and it\nprobably won't happen for the rest of\nyour life and you've got to be okay with\nthat but it's the journey of just trying\nto get better every single time that's\nwhat matters\nand it brings it back to i mean there's\na childhood story that we all know\nwe were all told we were children the\nchildhood story and if we would start\nbeing more like this then it would make\nsense and it's the tortoise versus the\nhair\nright the tortoise versus the hair\nmost people\nespecially with instagram showing off\npeople flaunting their money and how\nsuccessful they they act like they are\nby renting lamborghinis and renting\nplanes and renting all this stuff they\nact like they're super successful and\npeople think oh my gosh they did that in\nsix months i could do that in six months\nright number one most of the time it's a\nfacade just so you guys know uh the the\nrichest people i know don't flaunt the\nmoney at all why because they don't want\npeople to know they have money why\nbecause people like to get greedy that's\nwhy\nso\nwhen you think of that you think slow\nand steady wins the race okay then all i\nhave to do is decide where i want to go\ni have to decide where i want to go and\nwhere i want to where i want to be and\nthen i just don't stop i just don't give\nup\nright the only time you fail at\nsomething is when you give up\nthat's it\nso\nyou have to decide are you willing to\ninvest the time it's going to take to\nget whatever it is that you want to be\nup and running\nand if you do\nthen what we've got to talk about is\nthis now that we've talked about the\ntime let's talk about the speed at what\nyou're going\nright let's talk about the speed because\nsometimes the speed is is more important\nthan anything else you know the uh the\ni'm sorry let's talk about the direction\nthat you're going sorry so we've talked\nabout the speed now let's talk about the\ndirection\nand it goes back to the phrase\nthat the the direction that you're going\nis more important than the speed that\nyou're traveling at right the direction\nthat you're going is more important than\nthe speed that you're traveling at so if\nyou're looking and going okay i see\nmy north star i see where i'm trying to\ngo i've just got to continue to keep\nworking that way every single day\nbecause if you're going the right thing\nabout this if you're going the right\ndirection and you just don't stop\nyou'll eventually be there\nit's simple but it's also profound\nif you're going the right direction and\nyou just don't stop\nyou're eventually going to end up where\nyou want to be you might not be there as\nfast as you wish that you would be there\nbut things take time\nso you've got to ask yourself if we're\ntalking about direction\ndo you know where you're going\ndo you know\ndo you know where you want your life to\nbe\ndo you know what you want your where you\nwant your life to be in 365 days do you\nknow what you want your life to be in\nfive years do you know where you want\nyour life to be in 10 years have you sat\ndown with a pen and paper and asked\nyourself what do i want in my life in\nall aspects of my life what do i want to\nmy bank account what do i want my\nrelationships and my romantic\nrelationship in my\nhouse what do i want in my cars what do\ni want in my\nyou know my family life what do i want\nin a relationship with my parents who do\ni want to be what type of character do i\nwant right how do i want people to talk\nabout me at my funeral\nthose are my character traits i want to\ndevelop how much money do i want to make\nright where do i want to live who do i\nwant to money\nwho do i want to marry you can marry\nmoney if you want to who do you want to\nmarry though right do you want to have\nkids how many kids when do you want to\nhave them what do you what do you want\nwhat do you want your family to look\nlike do you want to travel with them\nwhat do you want your relationship to be\nwith your parents do you want to retire\nyour parents do you know where you want\nto go because if you don't know where\nyou want to go you're never going to\nactually get there\nmake sense\ni always say if you don't know where\nyou're going and you'll never actually\nhit that target so it's a perfect\nexample as if i were to take the number\none archer in the world person with a\nbow and arrow\nand i would say hey you're gonna line up\nwith the archer we're gonna see who's\nbetter they're gonna beat you every\nsingle time but if i were to blindfold\nthem and then just\nrandomly spin them around and they don't\nknow what direction they're facing\nyou're going to beat them why simply\nbecause you can see the target and they\ncan't so can you see the target of your\nlife and where you're trying to go let\nme give you another example right let's\nsay that we're in miami you and i are\ngoing to take a boat trip people don't\nknow that miami's like 90 minutes or\nthree hours or something like that from\nfrom\nthe bahamas you can literally go from\nmiami or fort lauderdale directly over\nthere and be there in a few hours right\ntake a boat over so let's say that you\nand i decide you know what let's go\nwe're in miami let's go to the bahamas\nlet's take a few hours let's go over\nthere\nwake up one morning we hop on the boat\nwith the captain and we're like captain\nwhere are we going to be going he's like\nwe're going to the bahamas and i'm like\ncool what's the plan what direction\nwe're going to go and he goes um we're\ngoing to\nuh we're\nwe're gonna go\nprobably in like that direction ish\nbut we actually might go that direction\ninstead\nbut we're gonna try to be in between\nthese two areas we're just gonna try to\ngo that we're just gonna go\ngo that way\nand you go how long are we gonna go that\nway and he's like\njust as long as it takes\nwe'll we'll probably get there sooner or\nlater\nright you'd be like get off the boat i'm\nnot gonna get on the boat with i'm not\ngonna have this captain take me three\nhours into the middle of the freaking\nocean\nprobably end up in the burrito triangle\nand disappear\ni'm gonna figure out a captain that\nknows you know if you get on the boat\nthe captain's like oh yeah we're going\nright there here's the coordinates this\nis the gps you can actually see we'll be\nthere in two hours and 45 minutes you'll\nbe like perfect i feel comfortable with\nthis person right and it's a funny\nexample but that's how you're living\nyour life if you don't know what you're\nshooting for you're just kind of well\nlet's let's just hop in this boat and\nfloat and see whatever the hell happens\nno direction we're just gonna\nsee where the wind takes us and see\nwhere the tide takes us it's a funny\nexample but how many people are just\nliving their lives just seeing what\nhappens right they don't know what they\nwant they don't know where they want to\ngo they don't have a time frame of how\nthey want to get there or when they want\nto get there any of that stuff\nand so they have no real direction they\nhave no real time frame and they're not\nreally even planning it and so first off\nyou have to know where you're going\nokay i'm going this direction this is\nwhat my my next year looks like this is\nwhat my next five years looks like this\nso my next 10 years look like i've\ndeveloped a plan i've found a north star\nand i'm gonna follow this north star and\nthen what you need to do is you need to\ndevelop weekly and daily check-ins with\nyourself i tell this to everybody people\nwho are in my business breakthrough\ncourse that learn how to how to how to\ngrow their coaching businesses from me\nteach them you need to have a date with\nyourself every single sunday people who\nare in my mindset course my accelerator\ncourse\nuh the accelerator academy same thing\nyou need to have a date with yourself\nevery single sunday just 30 minutes\nlook at the next week and figure out\nwhat you need to do the next week it's\nlike getting on the boat and setting\nyour gps to go over there if you're not\nyou're just kind of floating every\nsingle week and seeing what happens so\nyou make a plan\nyou know of what your next week is going\nto look like every single sunday and\nthen you wake up every single morning\nand you have a real quick five-minute\ncheck-in session before everything\nhappens okay is this still set do i need\nto move this is this good do i need to\ndo something better do i need to do\nsomething different do i need a shift do\ni need to move a little bit and you you\nfigure out if your plan needs to change\nat all and so you have a weekly check-in\non sunday 30 minutes real quick not hard\nbut super important and then daily check\nin every single morning for five minutes\nto make sure you're going in the right\ndirection\nand realize along the way\nof building this business and building\nthis life you're gonna mess up and i\npromise you this you're gonna mess up a\nlot\nlike a lot a lot that's okay messing up\nis not a failure failure is giving up\nright you're gonna mess up\nthe the guy who started honda\nsaid that success is 99 failure you just\ngot to succeed that one time that's all\nyou really got to do so you're going to\nmess up it's not about being perfect\nit's about\ngetting more\ntally marks in the wind category of your\nlife than the lost category of your life\nright if you want to have a weight you\nwant to wake up early and have a morning\nroutine and develop a beautiful morning\nroutine perfect are you going to be\nperfect every single morning you're not\nso don't get down on yourself when you\ndo happen to mess something up just\nrealize okay i wouldn't say today was a\nwin in the morning but tomorrow i'm\ngonna make sure that it is i'm\ndefinitely not gonna go two days in a\nrow messing up my morning routine right\nand you develop a strategy to put you\nto the direction of what it is that\nyou're trying to build it's simple it's\nnot hard you just check in with yourself\nevery single day every single week and\nyou know exactly where you're going but\nyou have to be very aware that where\nyou're going you're probably not going\nto be there in the next three months six\nmonths a year but in the next 10 years\nif you don't stop and you just keep\nworking and you realize that slow and\nsteady wins the race i promise you this\nyou'll look back in 10 years and be like\nholy i am so much further than i\nthought i was going to be\nbecause once again as i said tony\nrobbins says people overestimate what\nthey can do in a year but they\nunderestimate what they can do in a\ndecade it's more important the direction\nthat you're going than the speed that\nyou're traveling at hey thanks so much\nfor watching this video if you want to\nlearn even more about mastering your\nmind click right here and watch this\nvideo as well there has never been a\nstudy that's been done like this some of\nthem became drug addicts some of them\nbecame successful some of them became\nceos and one person in the study even\nbecame the president of the united\nstates"
