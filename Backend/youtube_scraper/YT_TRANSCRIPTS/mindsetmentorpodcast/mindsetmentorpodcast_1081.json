    "transcript": "there has never been a study that's been\ndone like this some of them became drug\naddicts some of them became successful\nsome of them became ceos and one person\nin the study even became the president\nof the united states\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nwhat the secret to happiness is and what\nit takes to live a really good life and\nthis actually came from a video that i\nwatched years ago and it's a ted talk\nfrom a harvard professor over a 75-year\nstudy that harvard did to try to figure\nout what makes a really good life and\nit's this incredible story because there\nhas never been a study that's been done\nlike this and i'm going to tell you why\nthat is first off\nwell the first thing you need to realize\nis when you look at how people live\ntheir lives right now if you look at\nmillennials there was a study that was\ndone on millennials and they found out\nthat 80 percent said their life goal is\nto become rich\n50 percent of them said that their life\ngoal is to become famous so if you look\nat that the reason why people go for\nrich and the reason why they go for\nfamous because they think that those\nthings will make them happy they think\nthat becoming rich will make them happy\nhaving a lot of money will make them\nhappy becoming famous will make you\nhappy and we all know if we're old\nenough we've seen enough stories that\nthese those things don't make you happy\nin a lot of cases they actually do the\nopposite sometimes people go for being\nrich they make the money they realize it\ndoesn't change their life and then they\ndon't know what to base their life off\nof and the exact same thing for famous\nas well and uh you have to step back and\nask yourself like do those things truly\nmake people happy they don't and if they\ndo what is the secret to happiness and\nhow can we start to progress in the way\nof making ourselves happier so the best\npart about this study that harvard did\nis that they took teenage boys\nliterally teenage boys all the way into\ntheir 90s and they they studied them and\nasked them questions brought them in\nevery two years from teenagers into\ntheir 90s it's the longest study of\nadult lives that has ever happened\nbefore and they had 724\nteenage boys that they studied from all\nwalks of life from the richest parts of\ntown all the way to the poorest parts of\ntown all over boston some of them became\ndrug addicts some of them became\nsuccessful some of them became ceos and\none person in the study even became the\npresident of the united states which\nthey don't name who it was but at least\nyou have an idea all walks of life all\nthings that could happen to them and\ncurrently 60 of these men are still\nalive so out of the 724 60 of them are\nstill alive and so what they decided to\ndo was to continue the study and they\ncontinue to study with their wives they\ncan still continue the study every two\nyears with their children and now\nthey've continued to study with their\ngrandchildren and over 2 000\ngrandchildren are now part of this study\nas well so they're literally\nevery two years checking in on these\npeople to find out what is the secret to\nhappiness and so\ni'm gonna tell you the secrets happiness\nin this episode that's what we're gonna\ndive into\nso uh what were the lessons that were\nlearned three lessons three main\ntakeaways that they learned by studying\nthese guys for you know 60 70 years 75\nyears\nnumber one\nthe number one thing that they found\nthat brought the most happiness to\nsomebody's life was good relationships\nmake us happier and interestingly enough\nmake us healthier you heard me right\nthe best relationships the people who\nhad the best relationships in their life\nit made them happier but not only\nhappier it also made them healthier and\nso uh the thing that we're starting to\nfind out and it's a fact there's tons of\nstudies that especially now with all the\nstuff that happened with the pandemic\nwe know that loneliness kills\nthe i've saw a study that said\nbeing lonely every single day is the\nequivalent of what it does to your body\nof having 15 cigarettes every single day\nloneliness kills people that have uh\npeople in their lives that are great\nrelationships not just relationships but\ngreat relationships so we're going to\ndive into that are happier healthier and\nlive longer so if you take nothing else\nfrom what i'm gonna say make sure that\nyou have deep relationships you don't\nhave to have tons of relationships but\nhave deep relationships the people that\nwere the most well-connected uh with\ntheir friends with a significant other\nwith their children lived longer than\nthose who didn't and so the people who\nfelt isolated uh said that they were\nless happier and\ntheir brain function actually stopped\nearlier than those who had great\nrelationships so not only did they feel\nbetter but their brains actually work\nbetter as well\nso that was one of the things that that\nthey found that was super super\nimportant the second thing they found is\nthat it's not the number of friends that\nactually matter you can have one two\nreally good friends because i remember\nwhen i was younger is about having as\nmany friends as possible i don't know\nabout you but as i get older it's about\nless friends but deep quality\nrelationships so it's not just a number\nof friends but it's that doesn't really\nmatter it's the number of committed\nrelationships quality relationships that\nsomebody has in the depth of the\nrelationships they have as well um they\nfound that the people that were in high\nconflict relationships so\nthis is staying in a relationship with\nsomebody whether that's a friendship or\nwhether that's you know somebody that's\nin your family but people that were in\nhigh conflict relationships were\nactually worse off than people who got a\ndivorce so people who got a divorce\nactually did better than people who\nstayed in a relationship there was a\nhigh conflict relationship\nwith somebody and they didn't leave\nbecause you know they just thought they\nwere stuck they didn't do it because of\nthe kids or whatever it is and the one\nthing that that was a very key indicator\nis at age 50 when they people study\npeople when they're at age 50 the thing\nthat predicted future health more than\nanything else\nwas the quality of the relationships\nthat they were in so when they studied\npeople in their 50s and then they 30\nyears later became 80 year olds the\npeople that had quality relationships at\n50 years old were the ones who lived the\nlongest and were the healthiest at 80\nyears old so\nlook around you who is around you\nis it people that are bringing you up\npeople that are making you feel better\npeople that are you know you can have\ndeep intellectual relationships with\npeople that you can be vulnerable with\nand show who you truly are\nor are the people that are around you\npeople that make you feel worse people\nthat feel like they're taking energy\nfrom you people that feel like you know\nbeing around them is an energy suck so\ni always say people are one of two\nthings people either batteries or\nthey're vacuums what do i mean by\nbatteries or vacuums\na battery is somebody who gives you\nenergy being around them makes you feel\nbetter they energize you they push you\nto be better that is someone who's a\nbattery\nthe vacuums are people who suck the\nenergy out of you like a vacuum you know\nyou could be around there for 20 minutes\nand you leave their house and you're\nlike [ __ ] i feel so tired right so the\npeople that are around you are they\nbatteries are they vacuums if they're\nvacuums they're gonna\nnot physically like come over and murder\nyou but they're going to kill you\nsooner if you have bad relationships so\nyou got to think about that you should\nbe surrounding yourself with only people\nwho are batteries and get rid of i'm\nsorry i'm just going to say it the way\nit is get rid of the people who are the\nvacuums and are sucking the energy from\nyou\nso the people who had the best\nrelationships at 50 were the healthiest\nat 80. uh people that were in their 80s\nthat had good relationships\nwhen they felt physical pain\nthey this is interesting when they were\nin their 80s and they had physical pain\nthey said it wasn't as bad because the\nfact they had quality people around them\nbut the people who were in their 80s\nthat had bad physical pain said that it\nactually was worse when they were lonely\nso the lonely people had worse pain in\ntheir bodies than people who didn't\nbecause of the people who had great\nrelationships and weren't lonely so\nthat's the second thing and the third\nthing\nis that they've actually found that\nrelationships good quality relationships\nprotect our brains and they also protect\nour bodies so people who are in good\nrelationships where they feel like they\ncan trust their spouse they feel like\nthey can trust their friends they feel\nlike they can trust the people around\nthem and be vulnerable around them\nin their 80s it actually protected their\nbrain and their memories stayed sharper\nthe people who said that they didn't\nfeel like they could trust the people\naround them\nin their 80s their memory declined\nsignificantly and it's interesting\nbecause i think about just in in my\nfamily my grandparents my grandfather\ndied when he was in his i think it was\n95 my grandfather died my grandmother\ndied when she was 93. they were together\nfor 71 years and they were sharp i mean\ni was i was in hospice with my\ngrandfather and he was sharp as hell and\nit was literally like he was sharp as\nhell and then one night he died i was\nlike how and the hell that happened it\nwas crazy it was his body that gave out\nbut they were people who were always\ntogether they have i mean our family is\nsuper tight they were always reading but\nthey were always sharp and so one of the\nthings that they find is that people who\nhave quality relationships when they're\nin their 80s their memory and their\nbrains are actually protected and they\nstay sharper into longer age\nolder age which is kind of crazy if you\nthink about it people that were in bad\nrelationships with people they felt like\nthey could not trust their memories\ndecline a whole hell of a lot faster\nso what's the moral of the story good\nrelationships equal better health\ngood deep relationships equal better\nhealth you don't have to have a ton of\npeople around you you've just got to\nhave some people around you and people\nwho are the happiness happiest in their\nretirement\nwere those who actively worked to\nreplace those workmates that they had\nwith new playmates so this was\ninteresting as well\none of the things that people really\nworry about with retiring is what are\nthey going to do when they retire and so\nwhen people retire a lot of times the\npeople they realize that a lot of their\nfriends are literally just from work the\npeople they hang out with in their\nworkplace\nso what happened was the people who who\nlived the longest also had new friends\nthat they picked up along the way so\nthey were talking about how you know\nthey they might have been a construction\nworker in a factory whatever it was and\nthey might have been a manager there and\nby the time they retired then they\nstarted playing tennis and they got new\nfriends that they played tennis with and\nthat kept them sharp versus just being\nlike oh my old friends are gone i don't\nhave my work friends anymore and sitting\naround the house doing nothing so um\none of the things that was important as\nwell uh that they mentioned inside the\nstudy is that they actually found that\nthe people who did really well were the\ntype of people who would reach out to\npeople\nin their family they haven't spoken to\nin years and so what they did was they\nwent back and mended old relationships\nthat weren't doing as well as they could\nhave been doing and so these people they\nthey sat down with them every two years\nthey came to their house they did blood\nsamples they did cat scans they did\nall of their body and they found that\nthese people that lived the longest that\nwere the healthiest that felt the best\nwhose memory stayed the sharpest were\npeople who literally\nworked on relationships and worried\nabout the relationships being as good as\nthey possibly could other than the\npeople who were like uh i'm just gonna\nyou know sit by myself loneliness kills\nso if you're out there and you're\nlistening to this you got to ask\nyourself a few things you know\nwhen you look at all of the people that\nyou're surrounded with\nall of the people that are around you do\nyou feel that you can have quality\nconversations with them do you feel like\nyou can trust them do you feel like you\ncould be vulnerable with them if you\ndon't number one maybe you should find\npeople who you can be open honest and\nvulnerable with number two a lot of\ntimes that i've found with people who\ncan't be open honest and vulnerable with\npeople around them the reason why is\nbecause they can't be vulnerable with\nthemselves they don't know themselves\nintimately and when you don't know\nyourself intimately you can't share you\nknow yourself intimately with other\npeople around you as well and so\nlistening to this i always like to say\nthat success leaves clues you can hear\nthat everywhere success leaves clues if\nsomeone's a successful multi-millionaire\nthey've probably left clues along the\nway as to how they've done it there's\nsteps to get there if you want to live a\nhappy life if you want to live a long\nlife why don't you look at people who\nhave lived life before you and say okay\nif i don't build quality relationships\nthere is a pretty good chance that my\nbrain my body my health all of that\nstuff will decline\nat a faster level than if i don't than\nif i were to build all these so then you\ngo okay\nif that's the case i'm looking around\nmaybe you do have a quality relationship\nmaybe you don't but then you look and\nyou say okay are there any relationships\nthat i might need to trim out of my life\nwe had the the snowpocalypse here in\naustin and i have agave that are outside\nand our landscaper came by and said we\nneed to trim some of the agave because\nthe the snow killed them right and if i\nleave those\nkilled parts like the dead parts on the\nagave it will eventually rot the rest of\nthe agave right so the dead branch on\nthe agave will kill the rest of the if i\ndon't take it off\nthat's how you should think of your\nrelationships you should trim off some\nof the dead relationships from you\nbecause if you don't those rotten\nrelationships will tend to rot you and\nit will be a steeper decline in your\nhealth and your happiness in your brain\nif you don't so learn from people who\nhave been there before take advice from\npeople who have been there before\nfigure out a way to make your\nconversations deeper to find people that\nyou can trust to open yourself up to\nyourself and then open yourself up to\nother people because when you can be\nopen honest and vulnerable people around\nyou feel like you can trust them they\ncan trust you you will tend to live\nlonger and you will also be happier so\ntake the advice from people live before\nyou work on your relationships hey\nthanks so much for watching this video\nif you want to learn even more about\nmastering your mind click right here and\nwatch this video as well my business\nthat was killing it at the time\ncompletely went to crap i lost all of my\nmoney i was five months behind on my car\npayment and i was living off of pasta\nand i thought to myself this isn't my\nlife like this isn't what my life is\ngoing to be i need to create something\nof myself"
