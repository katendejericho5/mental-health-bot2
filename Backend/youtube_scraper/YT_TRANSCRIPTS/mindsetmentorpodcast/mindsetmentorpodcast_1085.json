    "transcript": "it's funny because i was never taught\nthis i never heard this when i was\nyounger if what you're doing doesn't\nlight you up it's not meant for you\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nwhat millionaires focus on to become\nwealthy now this is an interesting thing\nbecause there's three things that i'm\ngoing to cover today that you may have\nnever heard people cover when they talk\nabout people who are successful they\ntalk about people who are wealthy they\ntalk about people who are millionaires\nand i'm going to talk about some things\nthat i don't really ever hear people\ntalking about and a lot of people\nthat i see that make videos on this for\nyoutube or they make podcast episodes on\nthis they they talk about what actions\npeople need to take in order to be\nsuccessful i'm not really going to talk\nabout actions today i'm going to talk a\nlittle bit more about the motive you\nknow the\nthe mindset the way that they work\nthrough it and kind of why they do the\nthings that they do versus what do they\ndo\nand a lot of times i see videos that are\nmade by people talking about the habits\nof wealthy people but those people\naren't wealthy and what's interesting is\nsometimes they don't even know wealthy\npeople right so in this episode i'm\ngoing to talk about it i uh have been\npersonally blessed enough to acquire uh\nsome wealth over my 35 years that i've\nbeen here\nand i happen to have some some really\nwealthy friends that i've you know\npicked up along the way as well and i\ndon't say those things to brag in any\nsort of way i just say them because i\nfeel like i at least can give you\ninsider perspective as to what i did\nwhat i focused on but also some of my\nfriends that have become extremely\nextremely successful and extremely\nwealthy um and what they focused on what\ni noticed by hanging out around those\npeople because the one thing that i had\nnoticed from being young\nwas i i noticed that that sometimes\nbeing wealthy is demonized and like you\nhave to screw people over and i'm going\nto talk about this but as i've met more\nand more wealthy people i actually find\nthat they're some of the nicest most\ncharitable people that i know\nand so we're going to dive into the\nthree things that i've noticed um that\nthat i've noticed from wealthy people\nhow they acquired that success and what\nthe millionaires who are millionaires do\nin order to become millionaires so let's\ndive into it the first thing\nalmost across the board from people that\ni've met her that are extremely wealthy\nis they do something that actually\nlights them up which is interesting\nbecause one of the biggest\nmisconceptions i think people have\naround being successful in making a lot\nof money is that you have to struggle\nyour way to success you have to freaking\nhate what you do\nand just work and grind and work and\ngrind and work and grind and eventually\nyou're going to become rich by doing it\nand and we think a lot of times that\nstruggling is a prerequisite to success\nand in reality it's not the people that\ni know that are extremely wealthy like\nthey love what they do like they are\nin a in\nin a real sense they are obsessed with\nwhat it is that they do in a way and\nthat's part of the thing that actually\nhelps them become successful you know so\nis it hard to become successful and\nwealthy absolutely but one interesting\nthing about it is that when you find\nsomething that you love and you find\nsomething that lights you up and you\nfind something that you're passionate\nabout for entrepreneurs that's fun it's\na it's like a game more than anything\nelse instead of having to struggle it's\nlike waking up and like hey what\nchallenges am i going to get today\nbecause there's going to be challenges\nbut it becomes fun and most wealthy\npeople that i know they do something\nthat they love that you know maybe they\nthey really love real estate for some\nreason they they're in the real estate\ngame they really love helping people so\nthey end up being authors and they end\nup being coaches and they help people\nmaybe they're speakers there's many\nthings that they do that they absolutely\nlove and they become successful because\nthat and the reason why is because this\nthing\ngives them energy\nright it doesn't feel like it's taking\nenergy away from them so for me\ni know personally what i'm doing right\nnow for you guys that are listening to\nthe podcast you hear me speaking into a\nmicrophone for those of you guys that\nare watching on youtube facebook\ninstagram you see me talking to a camera\ni love doing this i don't know why i\nlove doing this i love\nthe way humans work i love figuring out\nhumans i love\nyou know neurology psychology early\nchildhood development i love learning\nabout it and then i just love speaking\nabout it i would be doing this even if i\ndidn't figure out a way to make money\ndoing it it lights me up so when i get\ndone recording four or five episodes in\na row and it takes hours and hours and\nhours it gets a lot out of me but i'm\nactually more energized after doing it\nthan i am before doing it because i just\nlove what i do it gives me energy and\nthe reason why that's important is\nbecause we all know to be successful\nit's going to require hard work whether\nyou love what you do or you hate what\nyou do it's going to require a lot a lot\na lot of hard work but what's\ninteresting about it is when you love\nwhat you do you are naturally going to\nput more work into it why because it\njust feels like it's part of you it\nfeels fully in alignment\nwith what it is that i do like i feel\nlike the podcast and all of the coaching\nand the stuff that i do is like my baby\nit's like a it's like a third arm i\nwould feel lost without it i love what\nit is that i do and i feel like i'm\nprobably going to do this until the day\nthat i die right so i just love this\nand so one of the things that that's a\nprerequisite for success is\nhard work now can you\nforce yourself to do something that you\nabsolutely hate and struggle your way to\nsuccess a hundred percent there are\ndefinitely people that hate what they do\nthey're just doing it for money and they\nstruggle with their way to success but\nthat sounds like it sucks i don't know\nabout you\ni don't want to struggle my way to\nsuccess i would love to find something\nthat i'm\nfully in alignment with that makes me\nfeel like i come alive because then i'll\nwork my ass off and it doesn't feel like\nwork cliches are cliches because cliches\nare true in the cliche find what it is\nthat you love and you'll never work a\nday in your life is so freaking true\nbecause it's just it's just fun it's\njust fun like this has worked for me\nlike how how blessed am i to have this\nas my work right i have friends that are\nyou know very successful real estate\nthey just love real estate they love\nknocking houses down and flipping them\nand doing interior design and all of\nthis stuff they love that they love the\nthe thrill of it i have friends that are\nvery successful that have become really\ngreat sales reps as well they love the\nthrill of going for the sale they love\ntheir product so when you're thinking\nabout this you have to work hard in\norder to be successful and once again\nyou can either struggle your way there\nif you want to or you can love your way\nthere i would prefer to love my way\nthere so if you love something that you\ndo you'll never work a day in your life\nit is so freaking true in what i do i\nlove\nmy question to you is if you hate what\nyou're currently doing\nin your life\ncan you find something that you do love\ncan you find something that lights you\nup if what you're doing doesn't light\nyou up it's not meant for you\nlet that sink in for a second if what\nyou're currently doing to a mass wealth\ndoesn't light you up then it's not meant\nfor you it's probably not the thing for\nyou and so you have to ask yourself what\ndo i feel not think what do i feel is\nright for me what do i what if i were to\ndo it would feel in full alignment with\nmy heart with my soul with what it is\nthat i love to do if you find that thing\nno matter how weird and obscure it is\nyou'll put a whole lot of hard work into\nit and when you put a whole lot of hard\nwork into it eventually it will become\nsuccess so you can work 80 hours but it\ndoesn't feel like working 88 hours it\ngives you energy like this is freaking\nfun so the first thing\nthat i notice with some of the most\nsuccessful people i know is that they\njust love what they do and they've\nacquired massive amounts of success from\nit and that's interesting because most\npeople are like oh my gosh if i look at\nthis person who's a\nmulti-multi-millionaire\nand you look at someone who's a\nmillionaire or a billionaire and a lot\nof people like they've made so much\nmoney why don't they just retire because\nit was never about money in the first\nplace\nhmm\nthink about that for a second it was\nnever about money in the first place did\nthey want to make money sure but what it\nwas about was that they actually love\nthat thing that they're in whatever it\nis\ncoaching real estate\nyou know whatever there's a whole\nthere's a million ways to make a million\ndollars but the reason why they don't\nquit is because they were never in it\nfor the money in the first place they\njust love doing that thing and when you\nlove doing that thing you have no\nproblem working your ass off because it\ndoesn't feel like work and eventually if\nyou work your ass off you're going to be\nget to be successful so the first thing\nthat i notice that not many people talk\nabout is they do something they love\nthey do something that lights them up\nthe second thing that i notice is most\nextremely successful people are\nentrepreneurs and entrepreneurs\nwhat they do is they solve other\npeople's problems whether it's their\nproblem\nthat they've had their whole life and\nthey want to find a solution for it or\nthey notice that other people having\nthis problem they take on other people's\nproblems that's what's interesting about\nentrepreneurs is they look at other\npeople's problems and go huh can i find\nthe solution to that is there a hole in\nthe market where i can go ahead and\ndevelop something or invent something or\nimprove a service that currently exists\nor product that currently exists and\nmake it better so that i serve people at\na higher level right so entrepreneurs\nalways solve problems in some sort of\nway i'll give you a perfect example\n150 years ago 200 years ago people were\nusing horseback right horseback and\ncarriage and then somebody went you know\nwhat i could probably figure out a way\nto transfer people quicker and what\nhappened they started developing cars\nthat was never a thing before but that\nwas a problem that they solved and a lot\nof times entrepreneurs solve problems\nthat are there and a lot of times they\nsolve problems that people don't even\nknow that they have until after that\nproduct comes out you're like oh my god\ni've needed this my entire life how many\ntimes has that happened to you right so\nyou know people didn't realize i guess\nthat they're like man yeah i'm moving\nwith horse but when the car comes out\nyou're like oh my god this thing is so\nmuch better and then eventually what\nhappened people went i could probably\nmove people even faster what if we\ndeveloped this thing called a plane and\nthen a plane was developed right\npeople become wealthy by solving\nproblems\nso if you think about it that way\nwhat is it that you could do that would\nsolve other people's problems and\nthere's a couple different avenues that\nyou could go number one you could just\nspecifically solve people's problems\nnumber two you could create a a service\nthat solves people's problems like maybe\nyou know\nan easy example of solving someone's\nproblem with a service is hey i don't\nwant to mow my lawn but i'll pay someone\nto do it i don't want to mess with my\npool but i'll pay someone to do it you\nknow so that's that's a service\nanother example is a a product can you\ndevelop a product or you know figure out\nsome form of some product or an invent\nsome product that would then improve\npeople's lives\nor is there a product that currently\nexists and this is the way a lot of\npeople get really rich is they take a\nproduct that already exists and makes it\nmake it even better because when you can\ntake a product and make it even better\nwell the good thing about that is that\nyou can take something that's already\nproven that people need make it better\nmore efficient and people will buy it so\nthat's the thing that people don't\nrealize about very very wealthy people\nthe very wealthy people that i've come\nacross and that i know they're very good\nproblem solvers so look around in your\nyour surroundings people that you hang\nout around and what do you typically\nhear people say that they need help with\nwhat problems do they do they have right\nwhat problems can you help people solve\nright whether it's a service a product\nor improving a current product or\ncurrent service start looking around\nyour life start trying to find that if\nyou're wanting to become wealthy how can\nyou help people solve their problems\nwhat are the problems that are out there\nin the world so that's the second thing\nthat i noticed from very successful\npeople and the third thing\nwhich is really\ninteresting especially when you see what\npeople the way that people talk about\npeople who are quote unquote rich or\nhealth rich or wealthy is that a lot of\ntimes they usually are doing something\nfor others and that's the and i don't\nmean by solving the problem i mean they\nactually are developing a company for\nothers\nsome of the most successful people that\ni know are doing it not for themselves\nand here's why this is key is because\nonce again you have to work really\nfreaking hard to become successful and\nif you're just going for money money is\na very hollow goal it's just like when\nyou make it you're like well i made it\nright but i don't feel better about\nmyself when i make money\nthe interesting thing about humans is\nthat humans no matter what they always\nwant to do something for someone else\nlike i'll give you an example you know\nwhen you do something for money it gets\nold when you do something for yourself\nit gets old when you do something for\nothers it never\never gets old\nit's just fun it's just there's\nsomething inside of the human brain for\ncompassion and love that when you do\nsomething for others it makes you feel\ngood and so some of the most successful\npeople that i know\nare doing what they're doing because\nthey want to help others in a lot of\ndifferent ways so\ni'll give you an example i have a friend\num and his whole life goal was to make a\nhundred million dollars like to be worth\n100 million dollars and he hit that\nnumber by about 45.\nand when he hit that number he actually\nwent into like a little bit of a state\nof depression because he was his whole\ngoal is to be worth a hundred million\ndollars and once he hit that number he's\nlike i'm only 45 what do i do with the\nrest of my life right good problem to\nhave you could say right and then he\nrealized that his life goal\nwas actually wrong all along it\nshouldn't have been to make a hundred\nmillion dollars it should have been to\ndonate a hundred million dollars to\ncharity and so his goal from now on he's\nin his 50s now is to make enough money\nto donate a hundred million dollars to\ncharity by the time he passes away now\nyou don't hear about these types of\nthings inside of the news you don't hear\nabout them when people are talking about\nit and the reason why is because for\nsome reason\npeople who have wealth become demonized\nright you've heard it you have to screw\npeople over in order to make money you\ngotta you know money is the root of all\nevil and are there people doing bad\nthings for money yes absolutely but i\ni don't know many of them compared to\nthe ones i know they're just really\nfreaking good people and the good thing\nabout money is if you make money you can\nthen do more better things with that\nmoney right when you're broke you can't\ndo a whole lot except for donate your\ntime but when you have a have amassed\nmoney you can donate that money you can\ndo something with it you can build\norphanages you can build water towers\nand everything in in africa you can help\nwhen you have money money is just a\nsomething that is used as a tool\nand so\ni have found and it's it's funny because\ni was never taught this i never heard\nthis when i was younger i was always\nalways heard you know not from just my\nfamily but just just people in general\nyou hear it in the news you hear people\ntalk about it\nis there's a demonization of people who\nhave money and people who have money\nfrom what i found do are some of them\n and they've screwed people over\nto get there\nyeah of course there are some of that\nbut it's a super super small percentage\nthe majority of people who have money\nthat i've found have really big hearts\nand they've done it and they because of\nfact they've been leading from their\nhearts\nthey've actually developed big companies\nthey've helped a lot of people they've\nhelped a lot of souls they've you know\nmade charities donated to cherries all\nof that stuff are there outliers to that\nof course there always are outliers to\nthat but what i'm telling you is i am\n100 sure that there are more really good\npeople that are wealthy than not and\nthey tend to do really good things with\nthat so with that being said like i said\nbefore when you don't have money you\ncan't do a whole lot when you don't have\nmoney but when you do have money you can\nand so that's the beautiful thing about\nit is that i'm here to tell you that you\ncould be a really good person you could\nbe a loving person you could be a heart\ncentered person and you can make a ton\nof money and a ton of wealth still being\nthat way you don't have to screw people\nover money's not the root of all evil\nnone of that stuff there's really great\npeople who make money and um i don't\nthink it's talked about enough and i'm\nhere to tell you that if you're a really\ngood person you have a really big heart\nmaking money does not go against that\nwhat goes against that is usually our\npsychology around money\nwhich is you know comes from our parents\nit comes from society it comes from\npeople in our family all of that stuff\nin most people's psychology around money\nis completely screwed up i know that\nmine was um and and usually it's a\nscarcity mindset of i i don't have\nenough i've got a i've got a horde\nbecause what if something happens and\nwhen someone has an abundance of money\nand they can do stuff with it they\nusually do good things with it\nso i want you to realize um this is not\nme preaching from a soapbox in any sort\nof way of oh my gosh look at me look at\nmy friends any of that stuff it's just\nto let you know\nthat a lot of times there's really good\npeople who have become wealthy and if\nyou are a good person\nit's completely cool you can make a lot\nof money you can be a really good person\nand usually you can do a lot with that\nas well hey thanks so much for watching\nthis video if you want to learn even\nmore about mastering your mind click\nright here and watch this video as well\nif you go back and look at some of the\nmost successful people in the world one\nof the things that you'll find among 95\nof them is that they"
