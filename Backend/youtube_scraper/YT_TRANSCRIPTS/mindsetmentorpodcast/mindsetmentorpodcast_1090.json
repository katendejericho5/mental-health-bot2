    "video_title": "\"Why 90% Of People Die With Regret\" - STOP WASTING Your Life!  | Rob Dial",
    "transcript": "stop it's not too late you have now\nwoken up from the slumber that you're in\ndon't go back to sleep don't go back to\nsleep\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to die with regret\nhopefully you're not one of the people\nthat does die with regret but i'm going\nto talk about why 90 of people end up\nliving their lives and then dying with\nregret i'm going to talk about it so\nthat you don't have to\nthat's an important thing you have to\nlearn from other people so that you can\nimprove your life and there's an\nincredible book called five regrets of\nthe dying in the number one regret\nactually before i go about the number\none regard let me tell you about what\nthe book's about the book is a lady who\nlives in hospice or works in hospice for\npeople who she's a nurse there and she's\naround people who are dying all of the\ntime and she starts to notice that\nthere's five really common regrets that\npeople have as they're dying and the\nnumber one regret which is what we're\ngoing to talk about today the number one\nregret of people who are on their death\nbeds they've lived their entire lives\nand they're at the very end there is no\nway out their number one regret is that\ni wish i lived a life that was true to\nmyself and not the life that others\nexpected of me\nlet that sink in for a second the number\none thing that people regret when\nthey're at the end of their lives is\nthat they wish they lived a life that\nwas true to themselves and not the life\nthat others expected of them and there's\na couple reasons why\nthis exists and i'm going to talk about\ntwo reasons number one is our absolute\nneed for acceptance from other people\nthat holds us back i'm going to talk\nabout that and number two\nis i feel like most people don't know\nwho they truly are and if you don't know\nwho you truly are then you don't know\nwhat you truly want and so let's go over\nthe first one first\npeople's need for acceptance holds them\nback from everything that they want\nthere's an incredible quote that jim\ncarrey has when he's giving a\ncommencement speech and he says your\nneed for acceptance will make you\ninvisible in this world we learn from a\nyoung age whether it's our parents or\nsociety or our family or our friends we\nlearn that we have to act a certain way\nand we have to fit in into society and\nso from a young age we develop what's\ncalled a personality now just so you\nknow personality comes from the greek\nword persona the greek word persona is\nactually the mask that people would wear\nwhen they were acting on stage back in\nancient greece so that personality that\nyou have is a mask that you're wearing\nso that you can fit in with what you\nthink you should be or what you have\nbeen raised to be\nso ultimately what happens from a young\nage is we make ourselves into a\ncharacter of who we think other people\nwant us to be whether that's our parents\nwhether that's society whether that's\nfitting in with our friends whatever it\nis\nwe make ourselves into a character of\nwho we think other people want us to be\nit starts off as everything does with\nour parents if you had\ngreat parents or terrible parents we\nstill as children mold ourselves into\nwhat we feel like our parents want us to\nbe\nhow they want us to act how they act and\nsometimes it's not even what they\nspecifically say to us it's also what we\nwatch them doing have you ever noticed\none time where you're just doing\nsomething you're like oh my god that was\nexactly like my mom oh my god that was\nexactly like my dad it's not that they\nforce that onto us it's that we learn\nthe world by learning from what they say\nto us but actually more than anything\nelse is watching them\nso if your parents have a personality\na persona a character that they've\ndeveloped\nchildren tend to take on their parents\ncharacter as well\nand so what happens is when we act a\ncertain way as we're young we figure out\nwhat we're supposed to do what we're not\nsupposed to do right we learn it from\nour parents\nand we start to develop that personality\nand then what happens\nwe start to hang out around other\nchildren and we want to be\naround other children we want to be\naccepted by other children it's built\ninto us to be tribal beings so we want\nto be accepted we don't want to be\nkicked out of the tribe because a\nhundred thousand years ago to be kicked\nout of tribe meant certain death and so\nit's built into our brains to have the\nneed for acceptance from others around\nus so it starts with our parents and\nthen we get older and then as we're you\nknow five six seven eight years old we\nstart to develop a personality a\ncharacter a mask a persona of what we\nthink other people want us to be\nand then what do we do we start acting a\ncertain way so that we fit in i still\nremember i still feel bad i'm 30 about\nto be 35 years old i still feel bad for\ncalling a girl named tracy on the bus on\nthe way back from school in middle\nschool on anne marie island a name that\ni thought was really really harsh and\nafter those words came out of my mouth i\nwas like\nthat wasn't me\ni can't believe i said that but i can't\ntake it back and the only reason why i\nsaid it was because i remember that i\nthought other kids would think it was\nfunny\ni developed a i said something that was\ncompletely out of my character to her\nand i still feel bad about it like 28\nyears later 20 years later whatever 25\nyears later i still feel bad about it\nbecause that's not who i am but it's who\ni thought i needed to be to be accepted\nso let me take a step back\nwho did you need to be\nor who did you think you needed to be in\norder to be accepted by your parents\nhave you ever thought about that for a\nsecond\nwho did you need to be or who did you\nthink you needed to be to be accepted by\nother children when you were younger\nwho did you need to be or who did you\nthink you needed to be to be accepted in\nhigh school\nin college in your first relationships\nyou develop a persona in a lot of times\nwhat happens is we do what we think\nother people think that we should do so\nwe go to college when in reality some of\nus don't want to go to college because\nwe feel like that's just i don't know\ni'm 17 years old i'm 18 years old i\ndon't know what the best decision is but\nit seems like what everyone's telling me\nis that i have to go to this college and\nso we go to college even though\nsometimes we might not want to go to\ncollege or maybe we go to college and we\nget a degree or start studying\nfor a degree that we don't truly want\nbut it's what our parents tell us is the\nsafest route or we get it because we\nknow that that that job is going to make\nthe most money\nand so we go on a pursuit of not what we\ntruly want not what we truly desire but\nwe go on a pursuit\nof what we feel other people want from\nus or what we feel will get us accepted\nor what we feel will make us more money\nwhich should make us more successful\nwhich would then change other people's\nperception of us make us feel a certain\nway\nthen we keep going\nwe get out of college\nwe get a job\nand sometimes we get a job just because\nwe want other people to think of us in a\ncertain way oh i want to get this job i\nwant to be a doctor so that people think\nof me in a high way they think that i'm\na great person whatever it is and we get\na job and we do what we think other\npeople want us to do when in reality we\nstill don't know what the hell we want\nto do\nand then what happens there's something\ncalled a midlife crisis for a lot of\npeople some people have theirs in my\nmidlife crisis at 24. i had a quarter\nlife crisis some people have it 30 40 50\n60.\nand we wake up\nfrom this\nthis sleep that we've been in\nthis autopilot that we've been working\non and we're we get the feeling of this\nisn't what i want\nbut am i too far down the road to turn\nback now i can't tell you how many\nmessages i got from people that are 40\nyears old 35 years old 30 years old 50\nyears old and they want something\ncompletely different than what they have\nthey have awoken from the dream that\nthey have been in\nthe autopilot\nbut they say i don't think i can turn\nback now i'm too far down the road\ni have a family to support i have this i\nneed to do\nand what happens is that they stay in a\njob a lot of times that's slowly killing\nthem\nthey're too far down the road is what\nthey feel\nright i've invested too much time\ni don't want to get out of this now i've\ninvested way too much\ni'm so far down the road you might be 40\nyears old right now and you might feel\nlike you've invested so much time into\nyour career into your college into your\ndegree into everything but it's not\nfulfilling you it's not what you want\nbut you might think it's too late i've\nmissed my shot right so many people feel\nthat way if you're 40 years old the\naverage person's living to about 85\nyears old you're not even halfway\nthrough with your life so you're going\nto waste the next 80 well if we could do\n85 minus 40 45 years of your life doing\nsomething that you don't want to do\nbecause simply you made a decision when\nyou were 17 years old to do something\nand to go study something and you got a\njob in it\nthat's freaking bonkers if you think\nabout it\nyou're not too old it's not too late you\ncan change at any time and you don't\nhave to change right now but can you\nstart to make a transition plan over the\nnext two years i'm gonna leave my job\ni'm gonna do this make sure my family's\nset up make sure financially i'm good to\ngo i'm not saying just leave at this\nvery moment but you can make a\ntransition plan i understand some people\nlistening to me have a have people\nmouths to feed\ni'm not saying just up and leave and\nquit and go become an artist but\nwhatever it is you want to do it's truly\npossible for you to make money doing it\nand for you to be fulfilled and to live\nyour passion and to still feed your\nfamily what would that transition plan\nlook like it's not too late stop selling\nif telling yourself you're too late you\nhave now woken up from the slumber that\nyou're in don't go back to sleep\ndon't go back to sleep\nso that's the first thing is that people\nhave the need for acceptance\nand so they they do all of these things\nto be accepted for so long and then\nsometimes they wake up\nand that's one of the number one reasons\nthat's number one reason why people\nobviously hold themselves back and they\nget into this life that we're talking\nabout and the second reason why is\nbecause people don't know who they truly\nare\nand what they truly want\nso we rarely ask ourselves what do i\nwant what if you started waking up every\nsingle morning to ask yourself a\nquestion what do i want\nwhat is it that i want what is my dream\nlife what is this dream job this dream\nprofession this dream family the stream\nhappiness this dream\nmindset\nwhat do i want\ndo you ever ask yourself that what do\nyou want what do you want in life\nwhat do you want\ngo for it\nand then what happens is some people\nwill wake up to what they want and they\nstill don't go for it\nright so we live a life based on what we\nthink other people want from us\none of the scariest moments in my entire\nlife was leaving my job that i felt like\ni had worked forever at you know i was\n26 years old when i got the job 29 when\ni was leaving the job i was making over\nsix figures base salary plus commission\non top of it that's a lot of money for a\n29 year old\nand i remember i was like i felt\nliterally i felt like my\nmy\ni felt like my soul was dying like i\nfelt like i could feel myself slowly\nslipping into a depression like i was on\nthe edge of going into a depression i\ncould feel myself slipping into habits\nthat i didn't want to have and habits\nthat i\nrealized would not create the life that\ni wanted to and so what happened was i\ncreated this podcast i started a\nbusiness and\nit didn't go really well for a while\nthat's what i i don't talk a whole lot\nabout like i wasn't making much money i\nwasn't you know like oh my gosh i'm\nsuper successful from the very beginning\nand i was terrified because i left my\njob to make a business out of it\nterrified scaredless right and i went\nback home and uh this was in november of\n2015. i'm sorry december of 2015. i went\nback home and my sister asked me a\nquestion she goes hey have i ever shown\nyou the box of dad's stuff\ni was like i don't know what you mean\nshe's like i have a box of dad's stuff\nmy dad had died 14 years ago she still\nnever showed me all this and she finally\nbrings out this this box and it's got\nlike old shirts it's got his glasses\nit's got his watch and it's got these\nletters uh my dad was when i was younger\nmy dad was in jail for a little while\nfor multiple duis and he wrote us\nletters and he wrote a letter to my my\nsister on her 19th birthday and it was\nthis beautiful letter he was a great\nwriter and then at the end\nhe said i hope you live your life with\ncourage love and laughter and then it\nwas a little bit more and i was like\nholy i feel like he's speaking to me\nright now like this is a letter from my\nsister in 2000 and when i'm in 2000 he\nwrote this letter to her and in 2015 i'm\nreading the letter and it says i hope\nyou live your life with courage love and\nlaughter and the number one thing that i\nwas feeling at that moment from starting\na business is should i shut down my\nbusiness and go back to sales go back to\ndoing what i was doing because i knew\nthat that money was guaranteed i had so\nmuch fear inside of me and the opposite\nof fear is courage\ni needed some courage\nand on it it said i hope you live your\nlife with courage love and laughter\nand i had never had any tattoos in my\nentire life for that moment\nbut i was like i feel like i'm about to\nslip into\nmassive amounts of fear and anxiety\naround not having the money that i want\nto coming in with this business and i'm\ngoing to burn the ships this is the only\nthing that i'm going to do and i'm going\nto get this tattooed on me and so if you\nguys you guys are on video can see it\nit's literally on my arm it's my dad's\nhandwriting that is blown up on my arm\nand it's in his handwriting it says live\nyour life with courage love and laughter\nand i made myself look at it every\nsingle morning of i'm\nscared\nlist this list list of\nlosing everything that i have but i know\nthat this is what i truly want to do so\ni'm not going to give up so i have to\nlive my life with courage right so i\nliterally had felt my soul dying at this\njob had to leave i felt myself slipping\ninto depression i left there\nwhich was scary as hell and it wasn't\ngoing the way that i wanted wanted to\nfrom the very beginning\nbut then what happened was i was like\nscared and thinking about going back and\ni had to get a tattoo on my on my arm to\nshow me\nthis is\nstop like stop living in fear stop\nmaking your decisions out of fear start\nmaking your decisions out of a place of\npower versus a place of scarcity\nand luckily i was able to make it work\ndid it take time yes is it working\nbetter than i could have ever possibly\nimagined yes but i almost went back to\nwhat was killing my soul\nbut i didn't\n[Music]\nthink about that in your situation that\nyou're in does that hit home in any sort\nof way\nwhat do you want\nif money were no object what would you\nbe doing\nwhat makes you feel the most alive in\nthis world what makes your soul smile\ndo you know\nif you do know follow it\ndo it\nput every waking ounce of energy that\nyou have into it if you have a full-time\njob at nine to five whenever you get\nhome put every ounce of energy after\nthat into it don't use your job as an\nexcuse as to why you don't have enough\nenergy to follow your dreams after your\njob\nsure you can pay the bills but then\nfollow your dreams until your dreams can\nthen pay your bills\nso if you do know what it is follow it\nif you don't know what it is search for\nit if you've been listening to my\npodcast long enough i always say this\nit's okay not to know your true purpose\nright now but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant search for it\nit's okay not to know your true purpose\nright now but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant search for it wake up every\nmorning and ask yourself what do i want\nwhat do i want what do i want set your\nreticular activating in your system to\nfind what it is that you want you might\nwake up today and you might say what do\ni want that answer might come to you\nright away probably not going to though\nit might take a week it might take a\nmonth it might take\n10 months it might take a year it might\ntake five years before you finally get\nthe answer as to what it is that makes\nyour soul come alive\nit's not okay\nto not be in constant search for what\nthat is if you don't know what it is\nso what do you want in your life stop\ndoing what you feel like you're supposed\nto be doing stop following what other\npeople say that you should be doing\nbecause what happens is if you do\nstay in the route that you're in if you\ndon't love what you're doing if you're\nnot following your purpose if you're not\nfinding your dream if you're not doing\nexactly what you want to do\nthen the worst thing that could happen\nis that you could be like 90 of people\nlike they say in this book that gets to\nthe end of their life they're on their\ndeath bed and they wish they lived a\nlife that was true to themselves and not\nthe life that others expected of them\nwhat do you want in your life\nall that matters is what you want not\nwhat other people want\nwhat do you want\nfigure it out find it follow it and\ndon't stop until you get it hey thanks\nso much for watching this video if you\nwant to learn even more about mastering\nyour mind click right here and watch\nthis video as well but what if i told\nyou that\nin 10 years 10 years from today\nyou will have a life that you absolutely\nlove\nlike the perfect life\nwould that excite you"
