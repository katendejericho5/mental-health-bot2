    "transcript": "have you ever walked up to somebody\nand you just have a bad feeling around\nthat person like there's just a feeling\nif something's not right this could be a\nrich episode just so you know\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe law of attraction what it is how to\nuse it and how to actually attract\neverything that you want into your life\nnow before i dive into it i understand\nthis might seem weird and woo-woo and i\ncompletely understand that because i'm a\nvery logical\nsensible person but when i go through\nthis and i'm very analytical as well\nyou're going to see what i mean by how\nthe law of attraction works whether you\nhappen to be woo wooi or whether you\nhappen to be a very analytical\nscience based type person this is going\nto make sense to you no matter which one\nyou are i'm going to teach you how to\nuse the law of attraction to get what it\nis that you want in your life now i'll\ntell you this i've been using it now for\nabout 15 years and i can tell you this\nno matter what your stance is on the law\nof attraction it works if you take notes\non this if you use it i'm going to teach\nyou how it works how to use in your life\nand how to get what you want in life as\nwell on a basic sense\nthis is what the law of attraction says\nit says that you can attract anything\nthat you want into your life\nbut you need to believe in it to your\ncore\nand if you believe in it to your core\nevery single cell in your body then you\nwill get whatever that thing is but\nthat's the secret to it is that you have\nto you have you have 50 trillion cells\nin your body right now right you have to\nget all of those cells\nto go towards that one thing\nin the way that you control your 50\ntrillion cells is through the central\nvoice your thoughts and that's what\nwe're going to go into i'm going to go\nmuch more in depth but basically you\nwill attract into your life what you\nthink about the most that's the easiest\nway to think of the law of attraction\nbut we're going to go much more in depth\nthan just that alone\nnow you may have seen the movie the\nsecret the secret is on the law of\nattraction i think it's a great movie\nit's a great book but i think it leaves\na lot out the way that the secret seems\nto be for me is i'm going to sit down\ni'm going to figure out what it is that\ni want i'm going to sit there and think\nabout it all day long and it's just\ngoing to the universe is just going to\nbring it into my life\nand i think that that's part of it but\nit's missing a lot and that's what i\nwant to dive into\nand there's no real explanation of how\nit works so it makes a lot easier to\nbelieve in something when you know\nexactly how it works because then you go\nokay yeah i can get behind this idea you\nknow you can't just sit there and just\nmeditate the rest of your life and try\nto meditate a million dollars in your\nbank account without actually getting up\nand doing something right so it requires\nyou to yes the law of attraction but\nalso it requires action you got to do\nsomething so we're going to dive into\nthat and to understand the law of\nattraction we must understand our bodies\nas they are our bodies are molecular\nstructures that are vibrating at a\nmassive speed at all points in time so\nyou can look at my hand and my hand\nseems like a solid object but my hand is\nnot solid\nit is actually vibrating if you were to\nbe able to look at my hand through a\nmicroscope be able to see all of the\ntrillions of cells in my body all of\nthem moving at a specific rate whatever\nthat is if you look at anything that you\ncan see in your physical reality\neverything is a vibrating structure my\ndesk this podcasting mic the camera this\nis recording it on my computer that's\nrecording this audio everything is\nvibrating it's just that everything is\nvibrating at different speeds and we're\nconstantly vibrating everything is the\ndifference between my body and my desk\nthough\nis that my desk is one constant speed\none constant vibration my body\nchanges depending on my thoughts and my\nfeelings\nso you know i'll give you a perfect\nexample of of how this is going to make\nsense to you have you ever walked up to\nsomebody\nand you just have a bad feeling around\nthat person like there's just a feeling\nof something's not right right that is\nyour body's vibration and their body's\nvibration coming into contact with each\nother and they're not in alignment in\nsome sort of way that's called\ndestructive interference if you want to\ngo deeper into it right but have you\never met somebody before and you don't\nknow why but you just connect with them\nand you get an incredible feeling around\nthem that is my body and their body\ntheir fields coming together i know it\nsounds weird i get it for those guys\nthat are analytical our fields coming\ntogether because your\nvibration of your body doesn't just stay\nwithin your skin right so we are in\nalignment if i'm vibrating at a certain\nrate and that person's vibrating a\ncertain rate\ni'm going to have good feelings that's\nwhere the phrase good vibes come from\nthat's also where the phrase bad vibes\ncome from as you can tell whether\nsomething's right or right wrong you can\ntell whether someone is right or wrong\nbased on basically how you feel now in\norder to understand how the law of\nattraction works we must understand two\nseparate things number one is our\nconscious mind which is the mind that\nyou hold all of your thoughts in and the\nother one is in your subconscious mind\nso we're gonna get really deep today\ni hope you're ready right your conscious\nmind is the mind in which you think\nright your conscious mind is only about\nfive percent of your thoughts throughout\nthe day write everything you think about\nand you can only hold one thought at a\ntime\nyour subconscious mind is like your\nmind's filing cabinet it doesn't know\nthis is true this is false it just takes\nall of the information and stores it all\naway as if all of it is true it doesn't\ndecipher the information it doesn't\nthink about it any of that stuff\nbut what's interesting is that your\nsubconscious is in control of about 95\nof your thoughts\nyour feelings and the way that you see\nthe world as well so it's really\nimportant before we dive into the law of\nattraction a little bit more in depth is\nto actually understand the way your\nsubconscious mind which nobody tends to\ntalk about when they talk about the\nsecret and they talk about the law of\nattraction how your subconscious mind\nactually dictates the law of attraction\nin what rate you're vibrating at now\nyou have to realize this\nthe subconscious mind once again just\ntakes everything that you say and\nautomatically stores it as true so if\nyou talk negatively about yourself in\nyour head if you talk trash to yourself\nsay oh my gosh i'm so stupid\nthen it's automatically going to take\nthat conscious thought stored in the\nsubconscious is true\nso if you constantly just keep thinking\nthis and thinking this and thinking this\nthat thought of i'm stupid over and over\nand over again now becomes a personality\ntrait of somebody who is stupid and now\nyou actually believe at your core that\nyou're stupid if you think oh i'll never\nattract the right man or i'll never\nattract the right woman or you know all\nguys are players or any of those types\nof things those thoughts will then store\ninto your subconscious and you will take\nactions that line up with what your\nsubconscious believes in so after years\nand years and years of thoughts being\naway\nbeing stored away from your conscious to\nyour subconscious you will develop a\nparadigm a paradigm is what you believe\nis true and it's usually the\nsubconscious you don't even think about\nit it has shaped your life throughout\nthe years this your program from your\nchildhood is where your paradigm your\nthat's actually what dictates what your\nparadigm is going to be so if your\nparadigm is as a child\nif it shapes the way that you view the\nworld as an adult\nit's everything it's what you believe\nit's what you don't believe it's what\nyou love it's what you hate it's the\nlanguage you speak if you believe in\nyourself if you don't believe in\nyourself if you talk down to yourself if\nyou're rich and successful now if you're\npoor now if you ever will be rich and\nsuccessful if you'll continue to fail in\nrelationships if you have you know a\nsuccessful one the way that you raise\nyour kids your paradigm literally\ndictates everything that you do\neverything that you think everything\nthat you feel everything your conscious\nmind everything your subconscious mind\nit dictates everything so let me give\nyou an example if you were born poor as\na kid right and your parents always got\nin fights about money and your parents\nwere always in debt and they said stuff\nlike money doesn't grow on trees and\nmoney is the root of all evil and you\nknow in order to be rich and successful\nyou have to screw people over then your\nbrain is going to take that and take\nthat and take that and take that and\nthen it's going to consciously\nstore it into your subconscious and now\nyou've got a paradigm just around money\nitself uh i have to screw people over\ni'm never going to be rich to successful\nyou know um\ni have to do bad things to make money\nmoney is the root of all evil money\ndoesn't grow on trees now i've got a\nparadigm around money\nwhich is going to change my perception\nof the view of money of the world it's\ngoing to change my thoughts around money\nit's going to change my vibration around\nmoney and it's going to dictate the way\nthat i either attract money or don't\nattract money or the actions that i take\nto go make money or the actions i take\nnot to make money so\nif you're poor now as an example\nif you're rich now as an example if\nyou're good in relationships now if\nyou're bad in relationships all of those\nare guided by your paradigm\nand those were all programmed into you\nat some point in time when you were a\nkid\nnow that being said when we're looking\nat the programming or with the conscious\nand the subconscious mind we're looking\nat the paradigm it's not something that\nyou can just change overnight it's not\njust something that happens quick and\neasy it takes time but believe me it's\nworth putting time into and to actually\nstart figuring these things out right so\nultimately what we're trying to do is\nwe're trying to\nin its simplest form we're trying to\naffect and change\nall of the results that we have in our\nlife we're trying to affect our\nour and change out of the results around\nour money making more money if we want\nour relationships having better\nrelationships our happiness our joy our\nsuccess everything and it all starts\nwith what you think\nright and what you think whether it's\ngood or whether it's bad goes into your\nsubconscious and will eventually produce\nwhatever results you want in your life\nnow if you want to change your results\nyou're going to have to change your\nthinking right and all of your results\ntypically line up with your paradigm so\nlet me give you an example\nthere's going to be a lot i promise you\ni told you this is going to be a big\nthis can be a rich episode just so you\nknow\ndo you know somebody who has all of the\neducation in the world they have you\nknow degrees falling off the walls and\nthey're getting another degree and\nanother degree and another mba and all\nthis stuff but they just can't seem to\nsucceed they just can't seem to figure\nit out do you know anybody like that\nhave you ever heard of someone like that\nwhy do you think that is because they\nthink that education is going to change\nthem but it's not what actually changes\nand needs to change is their paradigm\nbecause they can get all of the\neducation they want to in the world but\ntheir paradigm hasn't hasn't changed now\nwhat does this have to do with the law\nof attraction your paradigm is in\ncontrol of the frequency of vibration\nthat you set off into the world the\nfrequency and the vibration that your\nbody is at so in order to change your\nvibration you must change your frequency\nin order to change your frequency you\nhave to understand how your programming\nworks how your paradigm works and what\nis stored inside of your subconscious\nand when i say change your frequency and\nyour vibration the easiest way to think\nof it is this you know if i'm inside of\nmy car and i'm going for a drive and i\nhave the am\nstation turned on in my car my car will\nnever pick up an fm station if i am\ntuned into an am station right it won't\nhappen because i'm in an am station not\nan fm station so the same thing happens\nwhere if the law of attraction the way\nthat works if i have a poverty mindset\nif i have a poverty paradigm if my\nsubconscious is being run by\nyou know these poverty thoughts and\nmoney is the root of all evil you have\nto screw people over and you have to\nwork all day in order to become\nsuccessful if i have that poverty\nmindset\nthen i'm going to send that it's it's in\nmy thoughts it's in my body i'm\nvibrating as poverty mindset frequency\ni'm gonna send that out into the world\nright\nso an example of that would be all of\nthe people places opportunities and\nthings that could get me out of my\npoverty mindset i won't even notice them\nwhy\nbecause if someone comes in that could\nchange my or an opportunity comes in\nthat says oh this could get me out of my\npoverty mindset i'm not even going to\nrecognize that it's something that could\nhelp me i'm automatically going to push\nit away the same way\nthat if i meet somebody and i'm not\nvibrating at the same frequency as them\ni'm going to get bad vibes so for\ninstance i might have a poverty mindset\nand the best freaking investment\nopportunity or the best business idea\ncan come into my awareness can come into\nmy field can come into my you know i can\nliterally be sitting there and talking\nto somebody who's got the best business\ninvestment they can make me millions of\ndollars if i'm vibrating as a negative\nyou know poverty mindset i'm not even\ngoing to take that thing as an option\ni'm going to be like no this isn't right\nit doesn't feel right which is usually\nhow you can tell you know the frequency\nit doesn't feel right why because i'm\nvibrating at poverty if abundance in\nwealth comes into my life and starts to\nvibrate i'm not going to be in line with\nit there's going to be a part of my buy\nit says no rob don't do this don't do\nthis don't do this therefore i will\nreject that person i will reject the\nopportunity i will reject everything\naround me that could get me into my\nabundance that could get me into my\nwealth because i am at a poverty mindset\nmakes sense\nif i'm vibrating at that frequency of\npoverty then anything that's not lined\nup with that poverty i'm going to reject\nit's crazy isn't it\nyou know so what happens is we have to\nget ourselves on a quote-unquote\nmoney-making frequency we have to\nrealize that our programming of money's\nthe root of all evil and you know you\nhave to screw people over whatever it is\nthat is your your your frequency the\nstation that you're turned into the same\nway that if i'm on an am station i won't\nbe able to pick up an fm station if i'm\non a poverty frequency i'm not going to\nbe able to pick up an abundance\nfrequency or a wealth frequency\nit's simple it makes a whole lot of\nsense doesn't it remember the difference\nbetween myself and my desk is that we're\nboth vibrating but i can change my my\nvibration i can change my frequency i\ncan change the station that i'm turned\ninto\nright so you will attract whatever\nvibration or station that you're turned\ninto and you can only listen to that one\nstation so if i'm on a poverty mindset i\nwon't be able to poverty station won't\nbe able to get the abundance and\nyou know\nabundance in wealth\nfrequency if i'm on the scarcity one\nlet's go to another one if you've been\nscrewed over maybe you're maybe your\nparents divorced when you were younger\nand your mom talked about how all men\nscrew you over and men are cheaters and\ndon't trust men or you heard her maybe\nshe even say it directly to you maybe\nyou overheard her talking to friends\nabout it right and then you grow up and\nyou get into a relationship maybe you\nget cheated on you're like oh my god my\nmom was right\nyou start to actually think\nso many times over and over and over and\nover and over again men are cheaters men\nwill screw you over you can't trust men\nyou know this is just an example it\ncould go the other way for men to women\nwomen and men\nand you keep repeating that thing over\nand over and over inside of your head\nwhat's going to happen is you are\neventually going to to create a paradigm\naround that you're going to go from your\ntake it from your conscious thoughts\nstore it into your subconscious mind\nwhich is going to change the frequency\nthat you're vibrating at and that's why\nso many people like i don't know why i\nkeep dating men that are broken i don't\nknow why i keep dating men that are\n i don't know why i keep finding\npeople who are screwing me over who\ncheat on me all this stuff is because we\ntend to attract into our life\nwhatever it is\nthat is going to line up with what we\nbelieve is true in our conscious mind in\nour subconscious mind in our paradigm we\nare going to attract those things into\nour life so if we even if we consciously\neven if you're a woman out there or even\na man out there that just wants a really\ngood man\nyou're still going to attract\nthe ones that are not good for you if\nyou're always vibrating at the frequency\nof men will screw you over\nsame way for men for women for all of\nthis stuff you know you can switch out\nall of the genders in any way that you\nwant to it just makes sense though\ndoesn't it\nso the same example if i'm a woman who\nwants a really good man but i've been\nscrewed over and my mom said things when\ni was younger when a really good man\ncomes into my life i won't even vibe\nwith them or be attracted to them any\nsort of way because they don't line up\nwith the reality of the way that i see\nthe world\ni'm only going to be attracted to the\npeople who\nreinforce my paradigm of the way that i\nsee the world so that's why you know\nsomeone comes in they could be really\ngood for them and you're like why don't\nyou see your friend maybe and you're\njust like why doesn't she like him like\nhe's perfect for why because he\nas a really good man doesn't reinforce\nher belief paradigm consciously and\nsubconsciously of the world of men or\n men screw you over men are\ncheaters why does she always end up with\nthose types of people because that's\nwhat she believes\nat a\nthought and at a cellular level that men\nactually are\nthis is what meditation's for this is\nwhat going on and actually becoming\naware of these things is four is so you\ncan start to reprogram yourself you\nrealize what station am i tuned into\nwhat station are you tuned into\nin your relationships in your wealth in\nyour business in your life and you're\nthinking about yourself what station are\nyou tuned into because whatever station\nif i'm tuned in to 98.7\nfm i'm only going to get 98.7 fm i'm not\ngoing to get\n7 10 am if i'm tuned in a 98.7\nfm\nso i've got to pay attention to man what\ndo i actually consciously and\nsubconsciously think is true about money\nabout business about relationships about\nwealth about happiness about abundance\nabout scarcity all of these things\nbecause that's going to dictate where my\nbody is vibrating at\nand if something vibes with me which is\nusually going to you know that's called\nconstructive interference versus\ndestructive interference\nthen i'm going to actually\nunderstand that i'm only noticing and\nattracting things into my life that line\nup with the way that i actually\ntruthfully deep down at a cellular level\nbelieve the will the way that the world\nis so that's why you can consciously\nwant success but then you're not taking\nany action that's why you can\nconsciously want to have the best\nrelationship but you're screwing them\nall up or finding the wrong person\nthat's why you can consciously want to\nhave a successful business but you're\nfreaking sleeping in and you're bringing\nthe wrong business partners in and all\nof these things are happening is because\nyou have to become aware not only just\nof your conscious thoughts but of your\nsubconscious thoughts and your paradigm\naround all of that because that's 95 of\nwhat you think about and it doesn't\nhappen overnight like i can't just go oh\nmy gosh you know what\ni'm going to change my frequency and i'm\njust a different person you know you can\ntry to work on it every single day but\nyou have to res you have to literally\nbrainwash yourself into\nbelieving that that's why i have an\nepisode you know that's you know\nbrainwash your uh your way to success or\nyou have to brainwash yourself to change\nyour paradigm and that's\nbrainwash yourself to be successful that\nepisode that i did\ntalks about how you have to spend every\nsingle moment every down time\nbrainwashing yourself with what it is\nthat you actually truly want to do in\nthis world so if you don't see results\nright away it's not a big deal doesn't\nmean it's not going to happen just\nrealize it takes time for you to\nreprogram yourself if you're 35 years\nold you've got 35 years of programming\nit might take more than a couple weeks\nto start to switch your programming\nstart to switch your paradigm and\nremember that we're all programmed from\na young age so our our our job now as\nadults is to go back look at what our\npar our paradigm is look at what our\nprogramming was from a young age ask\nourselves does that line up with the\nfuture that i want for myself and if it\ndoesn't then i need to consciously\nchange it and also subconsciously change\nit because my it starts with my thoughts\nwhich is my conscious mind they're\nstored into my subconscious mind that\nchanges my vibration which then changes\nwhat i attract in my life\nthat's why if i have a poverty mindset\nonce again and a great business\nopportunity opportunity comes into my\nawareness comes into my life i will be\nlike no it just doesn't feel right\nit's not that doesn't feel already\nbecause it's not right for you it\ndoesn't feel right because it's actually\nnot vibrationally matching where you are\nit's too freaking abundant for you for\nwhere you are right now\nso if you want something in your life\nare you tuned into it\nthink about that for a second if i want\nsomething in my life i need to be tuned\ninto that freaking thing\nif you want something in your life or\nyou tuned into that station if you want\nsomething in your life you need to be\ntuned into that\nthat station so that you can start\nattracting it into your life you know\nthe one thing that i don't like about\nthe secret is that it acts like you know\nwhat i\nif i want to have the best relationship\nin the world and attract the best man or\nthe best woman into my life i need to\nsit there and i need to meditate it into\nmy life and meditate and meditate and\nmeditate and eventually that man will\njust show up at my door no you have to\nliterally after working on yourself\nafter working on the programming after\ndiving into what your paradigm is you\nhave to get off your ass and actually\ntake action\nthe the man of your dreams or the woman\nof your dreams is not going to come\nknocking on your door while you're\nmeditating and you're just going to\nattract him or her into your life\nthe missing piece a lot of times is that\nyou have to actually get up and take\naction okay i'm going to program my\nthoughts my feelings which is my head my\nheart my body\nto go and find this person that i want\nor to find that wealth that i want to\nfind whatever it is that i want and then\ni'm going to get my physical vibrating\nbody and put it out into the world to be\nable to actually go find these things\nthat's what i always find is missing\nwhen people talk about the law of\nattraction is what i like to call the\nlaw of action you got to get your ass up\nand get moving you got to do something\nyou got your mind you're working on your\nmind but is your body out there in the\nactual physical universe\ngoing where you can talk to other people\nof the opposite sex\nright\naround people who happen to have the\nbusiness that you want so if i want to\nattract the perfect woman into my life\nright and and i'm sitting there if\nyou're out there you're a single guy and\nyou're like i want to attract the\nperfect woman i'm just ready to i'm\nready to stop playing games i want to\nattract her if you're that's what you're\nthinking right\nyou can meditate on her all day long but\nshe's not going to come knocking at your\ndoor so you got to meditate meditate you\nknow get the vibration how do you feel\nabout it are you starting to actually\nfeel that maybe a real relationship is\nsomething that you're you're going to\nsettle into like is your body at that\nvibrational frequency and it sounds\nweird i understand the vibrational\nfrequency and all that stuff but you can\nask yourself do i feel ready to attract\nthe right person do i feel ready to\nbring in the right person into my life\nand you can feel in your body the\nrelaxed state that it can get into then\nyour physical body you've actually got\nto leave your house right you've got to\nleave your house and go to places where\nyou think that person might be and what\nhappens is whether you realize it or not\nthe same way that you're\nvibing with somebody\nthey also need to be vibing with you so\nyou might\nmight find somebody right now and they\nmight be the perfect person for you but\nbecause you haven't changed your\nvibrational frequency\nto them it doesn't feel right\nso if you work on yourself that's why\nthey always say if you want to if you\nwant to find the perfect person become\nthat perfect person first because then\nyou're going to match them vibrationally\nand then it's going to be good vibes\nbetween the two of you constructive\ninterference versus destructive\ninterference aka bad vibes so you can't\njust meditate that person into your life\nright\nsame way that if you want to have a\nmillion dollars in a bank account\nyou need to program and consciously\nthink about this money that you want to\nmake and you've got to consciously\nbrainwash yourself into believing that\nthis is actually true\nbut then you've also got to get out and\ngo make the money the money's not just\ngoing to show up and you're not going to\njust you know ding dong fedex is your\nbank is that your is that your front\ndoor and they just drop a million\ndollars in cash no\nyou've got to\nphysically and mentally working yourself\nso that your vibration is at the right\nfrequency so therefore you go out and\nwhen the right opportunity or person or\nplace or thing comes into your life you\ngo that's it right there that's the\nthing that i was working for it and it\nmight not you might not think it's right\nbut it actually feels right the reason\nwhy it feels right is because your\nvibration is lining up with that\nvibration so when they say attract\nthings into your life\nwith the law of attraction this is what\nit's talking about what you think about\nwill be stored into your subconscious\nyour subconscious will change your\nvibration that vibration is at a certain\nfrequency and you will only line up and\nget things that line up with that you\nknow only get things that line up with\nthat that frequency if you think you're\ngoing to be poor your whole life you're\ngoing to be poor your whole life if you\nthink you're going to be wealthy\nto at a cellular level deep down\nyou'll eventually be wealthy it's going\nto come to you if you think that people\nare always there to screw you over and\nthat men are there are going to screw\nyou over and cheat on you then you're\ngoing to find a lot of those people\nbecause those people line up with the\nreality line up with the frequency that\nyou're vibrating at you're going to find\nonly those people\nbut if you switch it around\nand you truly believe that the right\nperson for you is out there as long as\nyou get yourself out there that person\nis going to find you you're going to\nfind them and when you do find you're\ngoing to match vibrationally which is\nhow the law of attraction works\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well good\nmorning everybody today's going to be a\nbeautiful day\ndo you want to go back to dreaming or do\nyou want to go to actually creating your\ndreams"
