    "transcript": "it was on like donkey kong comes out of\nthe womb and they're like i get stuff\ndone being this badass productivity\nmachine if you don't feel like you're\ndisciplined right now you're not\nstarting behind the eight ball\ntoday we're going to talk about the five\nsteps to be more disciplined today now i\nget it discipline doesn't sound sexy\nthere's nothing nothing sexy about the\nword discipline or making yourself be\nmore disciplined but it's not the\ndiscipline that's sexy it's the results\nof the discipline that is sexiest the\nresults of the discipline which creates\nthe life that you truly want and we're\ngoing to talk about how to build your\ndiscipline and this is important because\ndiscipline isn't something that you're\nborn with there's no person who just\ncomes out of the womb and they're like\noh my gosh i'm just a disciplined person\nno discipline is actually a muscle\ndiscipline is a habit it's something\nthat you build and it's something that\nyou create in yourself the same way that\nyou go to the gym over and over and over\nagain and start lifting heavier and\nheavier weights your muscles will start\nto grow same thing exact same thing\nhappens with discipline you might start\noff and not be a very disciplined person\ni used to be extremely undisciplined i\nused to just be lazy not do anything\nthat i needed to not get anything done\nsuper late to everything that i did\nnever accomplished any of my tasks and\nthen slowly but surely i had little tiny\nwins and it wasn't like\nmy whole life just shifted and i had\nthis i went from completely not\ndisciplined to the most disciplined\nperson in the world there was never that\nshift it was years and years and years\nof just working on myself and realizing\nafter five years after 10 years oh my\ngod i'm a different person because i've\ndeveloped this disciplined muscle i've\ndeveloped this discipline habit so for\nanybody who's watching this or listening\nto this realize\nif you don't feel like you're\ndisciplined right now you're not\nstarting behind the eight ball nobody is\ndisciplined nobody's born with it it's\nsomething that you have\nto develop in yourself\nand\nthe funny thing about discipline is that\nwe don't need\ndiscipline for all of the easy things in\nlife\nwe don't need discipline to eat a pizza\nwe don't need discipline to take a nap\nwe don't discipline to sleep in we don't\nneed discipline to do any of those\nthings what we need discipline for is\nthe hard things not the easy things the\nhard things the things that you know you\nshould be doing\nlet that sing in for a second you don't\nneed discipline for pizza you need\ndiscipline for you know a salad when a\npizza is in front of you you need\ndiscipline to say no to that pizza and\nsay yes this out do you need discipline\nto wake up early and do your morning\nroutine you need discipline to force\nyourself to go to the gym wouldn't it be\na lot easier just go to the bar and get\na beer wouldn't it but\ngoing to the bar and getting a beer\nisn't going to build the life that you\nwant\nthe discipline is going to build a life\nthat you want so once again it's not\nsexy but it's necessary and the results\nof discipline is sexy it's the life that\nyou want the money that you want the\nfreedom that you want the business that\nyou want the relationships that you want\nbut before we dive into my five tips\non how to actually be more disciplined\ndiscipline is not about being perfect\nor being this badass productivity\nmachine and you're just like i get stuff\ndone you know it's not about that it's\nabout\nwinning more than you lose in this\nbattle every single day\nright you're gonna mess up it's okay\nwe're gonna talk about that later you're\ngoing to screw stuff up no big deal\nbut it's about winning more battles than\nyou lose on the discipline side\nit's about\ncreating more\nthan you don't and what happens is if\nyou slowly start winning more than\nlosing\nit kind of gets addicting you're like\ni'm going in the right path this is fun\nthis is something i want to continue\ndoing and you get a little bit better\nand a little bit better so i'm going to\ngive you my five tips to help you be\nmore disciplined and to build this\ndiscipline\nthe first tip is this\nis i want you to challenge yourself to\nfinish\neverything\nyou may have heard the phrase or you may\nhave heard me say i say it all the time\nbecause i'm a firm believer in it the\nway you do one thing is the way you do\neverything and so i want you to\nchallenge yourself not just to finish\nthe big things not to get the reports\ndone that your boss needs by the time\nthat you need it i want you to actually\nfocus\non challenging yourself to finish the\nsmall things in life\nwhen you eat something\ninstead of taking the plate and putting\nit inside of the sink\ncan you take that plate\nwash it off by hand or wash it put\ninside of the dishwasher\nbecause you went from the act of eating\nhow do you close out the active eating\nmaking sure the plate is clean\nthat's a win\nokay that's just a little thing it's not\nsexy\nbut the way you do one thing is the way\ndo everything so if you're not doing the\nlittle things and you're not finishing\nthe little tasks and creating\njust the little tiny things that need to\nbe done you're definitely not doing and\nfinishing the big things so if you can\nhave discipline to do the things that\nare almost minuscule almost don't even\nmean anything it makes it so much easier\nto start doing the heavy objects to lift\nthe heavy objects later on down the road\nright so do the dishes you've heard me\nsay this one before after you get done\nsleeping just make your bed listen i i'm\nbeing honest with you i hate making the\nbed i think it's i've always thought\nthat making the bed is stupid if i'm\nbeing honest because i'm like i don't\never spend any time in my room the only\nthing that i do in my room is brush my\nteeth brush my brush my teeth after i\nget up i sleep i go and shower in the\nbathroom and then i leave and i never\ncome back so i brush my teeth i shower\nand i wake up from my for my sleeping\nthose are things that i do when i'm\nawake inside of my bedroom other than\nthat it's just eight hours of sleeping\nevery single night so to make my bed\ndoesn't make a whole lot of sense but\ni'm in it for the act of discipline when\ni wake up in the morning i go okay i\nhave almost finished the act of sleeping\nif i want to finish the act of sleeping\ni need to now make my bed it's about\ndoing the little things because when you\ndo the little things and you have\ndiscipline on the little things like\ndoing the dish\nwashing the cup\nmaking the bed then when you start to\ndevelop that little muscle of discipline\nit makes it easier to go you know what i\nneed to go to the gym i'm going to force\nmyself to go gym you know what i need to\nwake up at 5 00 a.m i'm gonna start\nwaking up it's about building you can't\ngo in and just automatically start\ncurling 75 pounds in the gym\nyou know the 75 pound dumbbells you have\nto start with the smaller ones so why\nnot start and have the discipline and to\nstart to challenge yourself to finish\neverything finish the small things\nfinish what you start don't allow\nyourself to stop anything early because\none of the things that i see with most\ni've coached tens of thousands of people\nis that so many people are excited to\nstart but they're terrible at finishing\nwhatever it is they want they're excited\nabout their new year's resolutions they\ndo really well for the first week and\nthey start to fall off in the second\nweek and the third week\nbasically they're completely off and\nthey're back in their old routines so i\nwant you to get the discipline of\nfinishing what you start do not allow\nyourself to stop early or to give an\nexcuse as to why you're going to stop\nokay so that's tip number one\ntip number two plan ahead\nand ask yourself this question how can i\nmake what i need to have discipline and\neasier on myself so let me give an\nexample let's say that you want to start\neating healthier okay you can eat\nhealthier that is great that's a\nbeautiful thing but then you ask\nyourself how can i make this easier on\nmyself well one thing i could do is i\ncould take sunday\nand take two hours on sunday and plan\nand create every single meal and if i do\nmeal plans\nit makes it easier to stay on track to\neat the stuff that i need to and\ntherefore i don't go\nfive hours without eating and then i\nfind myself with really low blood sugar\nand then i just want to freaking eat a\nbag of chips and a bag of skittles right\nplan ahead for everything that requires\nthe most discipline for you how can i\nmake this easier on myself how can i\nmake eating healthier myself why don't i\ntake two hours of meal plan on sunday\nperfect cool how can i make working out\neasier on myself i've done this before\ni've done this many times i force myself\nto go to the gym and i get to the gym\nand i'm like what the hell should i do\nand i'm i'm kind of like just wandering\nall the gym and picking up a couple\nthings and doing a couple things and\nthen i'm like i don't feel like i did\nanything in the past 45 minutes so maybe\nif you plan on working out\nfour times a week five times a week\nmaybe you actually have your workouts\nplanned so all you have to do is show up\nso there's less resistance because\nwhat we're trying to do is we're trying\nto remove resistance in our brain when\nwe know there's more stuff that we need\nto do like creating a meal we're less\nlikely to create that meal because we've\nwe're freaking busy let's be honest\nright\nbut if i've already got the meal done\nit makes it easier because i'm like all\ni got to do is just take this food and\nput in my mouth that's it right if i\nknow that i've got to go to the gym\nand i and now as i'm at the gym have to\nfigure out the workout there's\nresistance that cause it's going to\nrequire more of me so if i just plan i\nsay okay it's today's sunday i'm going\nto work out monday tuesday\nthursday friday and i'm going to do\nchest and back this day i'm going to do\nbiceps and triceps system and do legs\nthis day and i'm going to do full body\nthe next day and i have my exact workout\nplans done makes it so much easier all i\ngot to do is just show up right so plan\nahead how can you make this easier on\nyourself i gave you a couple of examples\nwith meal plans with eating healthier\nwith working out but with anything that\nyou're trying to get better at anything\nthat you need to work at how can you\nfigure out a way to make it easier on\nyourself and to plan ahead okay\nthe next thing number three is to design\nyour environment\nto help you\nlet me give a couple of examples of how\nto how to do this\nremove temptation\nright so like if for me i'll be honest\nwith you i\nam like a crackhead when it comes to\nsugar i know that when i have sugar when\ni actually have a bag a couple skittles\nif i have a couple skittles i want to\ncrush the entire bag of skittles and i\nwant to crush as many skittles that i\ncould possibly get my hands on i'm like\na crackhead when it comes to sugar so\nwhat i do is there's no sugar inside of\nmy house that contempt me there's no\ncandy there's no popsicles there's none\nof that stuff i remove the temptation i\ndesign my environment to help me be more\ndisciplined right if i want to start\neating healthier i don't have any crappy\nfood that's in the kitchen i don't have\nany crappy food that's in the pantry i\nremove all of that stuff if you want to\nstop drinking alcohol for 30 days can\nyou let's say you have you even\nyou even have alcohol in your house you\nhave a bar set up can you take that\nalcohol and put it out of sight lock it\ninside of a closet somewhere right out\nof sight out of mind can you design your\nenvironment to support this discipline\nthat you're trying to build\nah think about that\nwhat about the people that you hang out\nwith hmm\nokay if i want to you know let me just\nthink back to the super bowl that just\nhappened right i had friends over for\nthe super bowl and i had friends over\nand they were all drinking and i wasn't\ndrinking at the time and so you know i\nhad them over and it made it really hard\nnot to drink because i wanted a drink\njust to have a drink with my friends\nbut if i wanted to make that even easier\non myself what i could have done is gone\nyou know what i'm not even going to be\naround people who could possibly talk me\ninto drinking now luckily my friends\nknow that i rarely drink anyway so they\ndon't try to talk me into it but when i\nstopped drinking when i first started\ngetting out of it when i went from\nhardcore partying rob to actually\nserious business owner and creating the\nlife i want to rob\ni got so much crap from my friends so\nmuch peer pressure\nand that was hard and i did well\nsometimes and i failed sometimes\nbut what would make it easier is to not\nbe around people who can't help me\nactually make this the whole thing who\ncan't support me who want to make it\nharder for me who wanted me to if i want\nto stop drinking who want me to drink\nright so design your environment if\nyou're trying to be more positive\nand you're being disciplined to think of\nevery single thought to make sure that\nevery thought that comes through your\nhead that happens to be positive you\ncelebrate and every\nthought that comes to your head that's\nnegative you fix with a couple positive\nthoughts then it'd be really dumb for me\nto be around somebody who's constantly\nnegative right so how can you design\nyour environment you're in control of\nthis don't act like it's someone else's\nfault that they're negative no you got\naround that negative person take\nresponsibility for it design your\nenvironment to get it done\nif you're like you know what i need to\ncrank out two hours of hardcore work\nmaybe what you do is you clear all of\nthe crap off your bed or not if you're\nbad if you're off your desk you put it\nall away and the only thing that's on\nyour desk is your computer your phone is\nin another room whatever it is you have\nto do to design the environment to make\nsure that you can be ultra productive at\nthat moment right turn off all your\nnotifications drop the notifications\nwhen you get a text message on your\ncomputer if you have an app you know a\nmacbook turn off all of your email\nnotifications shut out everything that\ncould distract you from the one thing\nthat you need to do which is\nget stuff done you have two hours to\nwork get it done\ndon't allow yourself to slip into\noh i've got my phone right here oh i\ngotta text me oh look i gotta oh\nsomebody sent me a facebook message no\ndesign your environment to support you\nin building up this discipline so that's\nnumber three is to design your\nenvironment number four\nthis is super important for everybody\nrealize it's not about being perfect\nit's about progress not perfection okay\nyou're going to mess up you're not going\nto be perfect i'm promise you this\nyou're going to mess up quite a lot in\nyour life\nand so what you have to realize is this\nwhen you mess up\ndon't judge yourself\ndon't guilt yourself don't get emotional\nabout how you messed up because you will\nmess up but when you mess up\nmake adjustments\nright if i if i'm sitting down to be\nultra productive like the example i just\ngave\nand i happen to find myself going down\nthe rabbit hole of instagram when i'm\nsupposed to be working i go oh crap\nthat's right i'm supposed to be working\nright now what can i do what adjustments\ncan i make well next time i could take\nmy phone i could put it in the other\nroom that's what i'm gonna do right if i\nnotice that i'm in the middle of my\nultra productive time or what's supposed\nto be multi-productive time\nand i happen to notice oh man i'm i'm in\nthe middle of doing all these emails and\nthat's not what i wanted to do\nhow can i make adjustments to make sure\ni don't have this happen again i can\nturn off the notifications on this right\nwhen you mess up make adjustments don't\njudge yourself don't be hard on yourself\ndon't talk trash to yourself don't make\nit harder on yourself than you need to\nyou screwed up okay it is what it is it\nhappened don't resist it it is the way\nit is but how can i make adjustments you\nknow if you were planning on not\ndrinking and you wake up with a big\nhangover\nwell you probably need to make some\nadjustments as to you know maybe you\nhave alcohol out or maybe you were\nstressed out or maybe your friends\ncalled you and there's certain people\nthat you when you're not drinking maybe\nyou shouldn't spend much time around or\nspend time around them during the day\nand not at night when they're gonna get\nyou wasted whatever it is\nit's gonna happen you're gonna mess up\nyou're gonna fall in your face that is\nlife that's the way that it goes but\nwhen it happens when you mess up make\nadjustments it's about progress not\nperfection am i still going in the\ndirection that i want to if i happen to\nscrew up and take a step back am i at\nleast taking two steps forward for every\nstep back that i take\nprogress not perfection take a deep\nbreath and realize\nyou're not perfect you never will be\nperfect and you're gonna mess up a lot\nof stuff that's okay though it's about\nprogress not perfection\nand then tip number five\nis to reward yourself\nreward yourself give yourself some sort\nof reward if you want to be super\nhealthy for the entire day have one day\nwhere you have a cheat meal like when i\nwas when i used to literally when i was\nhardcore and to be like really hardcore\nmeal planning working out eating the\nstuff that i need to like i'm not\nanywhere near as hardcore as i used to\nbe\nbut i would be so hardcore for the\nentire week\nsaturday night\nit was on like donkey kong you knew that\ni was about to destroy some food i get\nentire freaking cheese and pepperoni\npizza i'd eat the entire thing by myself\nthen i would go to this place called\namy's ice cream here in austin and i\nwould order a big old freaking ice cream\nand i would basically go into a food\ncoma and pass out because i ate so much\nbut that\ni ate so much and i was so rewarded that\nit really like the next week was\nactually easy for me to be disciplined\nbecause i was like holy crap i kind of\nwent off the hinges there and also i ate\nso much i don't feel like i need to eat\nthat again at least not until next\nsaturday afternoon saturday evening well\ni'm going to crush it again right\nanother thing i used to do when i was uh\nwhen i was a salesperson is i would sit\ndown and go okay i've got to make a\nhundred phone calls and so i would i\nwould figure out a way to reward myself\nand so what i would do\nis i would set up what they call\ndopamine reward systems i didn't know i\nwas doing this now i know the actual\nneurology behind what i was doing but\nwhat i would do is i would go okay every\n10 phone calls\ni can eat three skittles right so i'd\nhave a bag of skittles and i would have\nthem in front of me so i could see it i\nwas like oh my god i want the freaking\nskittles right because i told you i'm\nlike a crackhead with skittles and sugar\nso\ni go okay i can have three skittles\nafter i get done with my first 10 phone\ncalls i can have three skittles after my\nnext 10 phone calls and when i get done\nwith my 100 phone calls which was my\ngoal i can eat the rest of the skittles\nand so what i would do is i would reward\nmyself and set up small rewards to get\nme excited to do what i needed to do\nversus just eating the entire bag of\nskittles you know having a massive sugar\nrush and then falling asleep after right\nso can you set up your life where you\nreward yourself for the discipline that\nyou need one thing that i'm going to\ntell you this is something that really\nhelps me out when i was younger i\nremember reading a book that changed my\nlife that talked about this but\nwhat i used to do is i used to think to\nmyself if i'm not where i want to be in\nmy life yet i don't deserve a day off i\ndon't deserve free time i used to live\nmy life that way\nand i used to think that but then i came\nto realize i read a book called the one\nthing by gary keller and j pop is on and\ni read the book and i realized that i\nneeded to actually start to set up my\nlife\nwhere i had free time\nplanned\nbecause when i go and have my free time\nit allows me that reward of free time\nallows me to go back into the work time\nthe hardcore time and get the stuff done\nthat i need to be focused on it\nbut i'm the type of person and you're\nprobably like this as well my goals are\nlike the horizon i'll never catch them\nevery time i get closer to them i push\nthem just a little bit further away and\na little bit further away because i want\ni keep thinking bigger and bigger and\nbigger\nso if i set up my entire life\nnot to be rewarded until i hit a\nspecific massive goal in my life i'll\nprobably never hit that goal because i\nconstantly keep pushing it further and\nfurther away and so you have to set up\nreward systems to reward yourself reward\nyourself with a cheat meal reward\nyourself with a day off and not having\nto work out reward yourself with you\nknow a bag of skittles after you make\n100 phone calls set up reward systems to\nstart to help you out and to start to\nmake you more disciplined\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well stop\nlying to yourself you need to first\nadmit that you are a lazy person if you\ndon't do anything and you're too lazy\nyour life is not going to be what you\nwant it to be"
