    "transcript": "there's no reason why you can't become\none of the best in the world in whatever\nit is that you want to do talent\ndoesn't even really mean\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to talk about the\npursuit of greatness we're going to talk\nabout how to bring out the best version\nof yourself and how to work at becoming\nbetter every single day and i'm going to\ntalk about you i'm going to talk about\nme and i'm also going to talk about an\nathlete\nwho you've probably heard of before and\ni'm i'm gonna talk about uh tom brady\nwho you could be a fan of or you could\nbe like i hate that guy uh because he\nseems to be a polarizing figure because\nhe wins so much and so um i want to talk\nabout him because of the fact that it's\nbeen inspiring what has happened in the\npast few years in the past year with him\nspecifically and just his story and why\nit's inspiring to me\nfrom not being a fan before to now being\na fan so\nas we dive into it we think about it i'm\nobsessed with the idea of greatness i'm\nobsessed with the idea of how can i\nbring the best version of myself how can\ni improve myself at all points in time i\nremember reading a book a little while\nago that was called uh it was by malcolm\ngladwell and he talks about the 10 000\nhour rule it takes about 10 000 hours to\nmaster something like to truly be a\nworld class master and it's 10 000 hours\nof deliberate practice not just\npracticing and having 10 000 hours of\nexperience but deliver it deliberate\npractice where you push yourself and i\nalways love that idea and the reason why\ni love it is because\nwhat it shows you is that talent doesn't\nreally matter as much as skill and\ndetermination matters skill is something\nthat you build in determination is\nsomething that helps you build it talent\nis something that you can be given but\nthat talent at the same time uh doesn't\nmean anything unless you obviously have\nthe skill behind it as well and so i\nlove it so much i literally have a\ntattoo on my wrist which is a roman\nnumeral x with a line above it which is\nthe roman numeral for ten thousand\nbecause i want to\nconstantly remind myself every day when\ni look at my wrist that this life is\nlike a self mastery thing something that\nwe're working on trying to become better\nevery single day and um when i when i\nlook at what tom brady has done last\nnight they just won the super bowl he\nwon the super bowl the tampa bay\nbuccaneers he went from the you know\nbeing in new england for 20 years to\nmoving down and being with one of the\nworst teams in the history actually the\nworst team in the history of the nfl and\nuh if you're not a fan doesn't really\nmatter if you're not a fan because if\nyou listen to a story you can start to\nsee\nhow his story can be very similar to the\nstory that you're building in your life\nand i think that if you think about the\nright way it could be\nhonestly uh inspiration to anyone and uh\ni wasn't really a tom brady fan up until\nfive years ago and the reason why was\nbecause he was just always winning in\nnew england and i was like is this guy\never gonna stop winning and it kind of\npissed me off and then five years ago\nthey were in the super bowl and his team\nwas down by 25 points in the super bowl\nand they came back and won and i was\nlike all right\nwhether i like his team or not you have\nto respect somebody who is just a winner\njust what you have to realize in life is\nthat winners win and this dude\nexcuse me is just a winner that's all\nthere is to it and you've got to respect\nthat whether you like him or not you got\nto respect damn this guy just wins\nwell a year ago he left new england\nstarted all over after 20 years he's\nbeen in the nfl for 20 years and he\nstarted off with the tampa bay\nbuccaneers i happen to be a tampa bay\nbucks fan and i have been because i\nactually grew up in tampa so i have been\nmy entire life um but we have\nbasically the worst team in the history\nof the nfl we have the the lowest\nwinning percentage of any team in the\nhistory of the nfl and we have tom brady\ncome back come down and change all of\nthat around which is really an\ninteresting thing when you start to\nthink about it we hadn't won a playoff\ngame\nin literally 13 years\nhow do you want to play off game in 13\nyears i'm sorry we haven't won a playoff\ngame in 17 years we hadn't been to the\nplayoffs in 13 years and we hadn't won a\nsuper bowl in 19 years and he comes down\nthere and there's a reason why the tampa\nbay bucks are called you know the tampa\nbay buccaneers have a nickname of the\ntampa bay sucking ears is because\nthey've always sucked that's really what\nit is but he moves down to what is known\nas the worst organization as far as\nwinning percentage in the history of the\nnfl\nand now he starts to change everything\naround with who he is with his culture\nand he comes down also in the middle of\na pandemic so what that means is he's\nmoving from one system\none team to a new system a new team new\nplayers a new offense which is basically\nlike learning a brand new language they\ncan't have practices because of all the\ncovet stuff that's happening there's no\npreseason\nand the guy literally goes on and wins\nthe super bowl\nand when you look at that you go\nholy sh that's a pretty big deal how\ndoes that happen\nnot only does it happen the road to\ngetting there was quite insane as well\nwhat do i mean by that\nif you know anything about football he\nhad to beat drew brees on the road then\nthe very next game he had to beat aaron\nrodgers on the road in the very next\ngame the super bowl he had to be patrick\nmahomes who is considered the the newest\nup-and-coming best quarterback who just\ngot a 500 million dollar contract\nbeats him in the super bowl as well and\nwhen you look at what he's done\nyou look at him and you go wow this is\ninspiring at least i look at him and go\nthis is inspiring because it shows you a\nguy who was overlooked\nhe was picked number 199 in the draft\nwhich means that when he went in the\ndraft\n198 players went before him which means\nthat the people who are paid\nmillions of dollars to figure out the\nbest players in the world did not think\nthat he was good enough to pick until\n199.\nhe had six quarterbacks that were picked\nbefore him\nand so it shows you they didn't even\nthink he was the they thought he was the\nseventh best quarterback\nand so this guy literally\nproves\nthat people who guess about how good\nthat you think that you are or what you\ncan be don't know [ __ ]\nbecause 198 people went before him\ni mean what does that show you it shows\nyou\nthat he was able to prove\nall of the teams wrong that he was\nbetter than all 198 people but those\npeople who are paid millions of dollars\noverlooked this guy because he didn't\nhave the talent because they didn't have\nthe skill because they have the right\nmindset whatever it is and you start to\nlook at it and when i look at someone\nlike this i go what can i learn from\nsomeone that is of this caliber who's\nbasically the michael jordan of football\nright and you look at it you say what\ncan i learn from watching greatness real\nlive greatness and there's a couple\nthings that i noticed i want to teach\nyou guys the first thing\nhis entire life is built around football\neverything he does is built around\nfootball he has a family and obviously\ntakes really good care of his family all\nof that stuff he's married to a\nsupermodel they have three or four kids\ni think it's four\nand he he has his entire life that's\nbuilt around football and his family but\nevery single thing that he does\nduring the season and after the season\nis built around how he can be the best\nplayer that he can be the guy literally\nis 43 years old\nthe average player in the nfl is 26 so\nhe is 17 years older than the average\nplayer nobody lasts for 20 plus seasons\nlike he is nobody's ever won a super\nbowl at 43 years old but then you look\nat how is it possible for someone to be\nthat old you know in and be able to\ncompete against people who are 17 years\nyounger than him and his entire life is\nbuilt around it he has you know this\nwhole thing he calls a tb12 system where\nit's the food that he eats the way that\nhe works out the guy doesn't have any\nprocessed foods he doesn't eat any sugar\nhe doesn't drink any alcohol he has no\ndairy he has no inflammatory foods he\neats 80 vegetables 20 percent meat and\nhis entire workout is not built around\nbuilding muscle\nit's around how he can get his muscles\nto work the best and it's not about how\nbig he can get it's how can he continue\nto use his muscles\nthe way that they need to be for him to\nthrow the ball and for him to be able to\nget hit and the guy has now been to 10\nsuper bowls which has never happened\nbefore he's won seven of them which has\nnever happened before but once again he\nwas drafted in the sixth round number\n199\nsix quarterbacks were taken before him\nso he's not talented what is he he's\ndriven and he's skilled why should this\ngive you hope because no matter where\nyou are in your life if you find what\nyou want to do and you're driven towards\nthat thing you can build the skills up\nthat you need to and that's the thing\nthat will smith says will smith says\nhe's never been really talented at\nanything but skill\nand drive will be will eat talent for\nlunch we all know somebody who's been a\nincredible\nathlete they're super talented but they\ndon't have the work ethic to go with it\nand what happens they go you know really\nhigh into the nba draft for the nfl\ndraft or the mlb draft or whatever draft\nit is\nthey go really high\ninto it but because the fact that their\nwhole life has been built around talent\nand not skilled they don't become what\nthey could be but then you also always\nhear about people like tom brady and\nother people who nobody knows who the\nhell they are they get drafted under the\nradar but they work and they work and\nthey work and they work and they work\nthey become better they become better\nthey come better and what happens is it\nshows you that talent\ndoesn't even really mean\nwhich should be great because it shows\nyou that if you find something that you\nlove if you find something that you can\ncommit to 100\nwith every ounce of your being you can\nfind your own version of greatness what\ndoes that greatness look like to you\nwhat is greatness in your mind and what\ndo you want to master\nhave you ever thought about that\nwhere do you want to bring your\ngreatness out of the world how do you\nwant to bring your greatness onto the\nworld what is your medium where you are\ngoing to show that you're one of the\nbest in the world and you might not even\nbe started at this thing right now but\nif you put time and effort and energy\nand hardcore willpower into what this\nthing is\nif you're like tom brady you can win\nand that's what's amazing winners win\ndoesn't matter your talent doesn't\nmatter where you are if you're sitting\nout there right now and you're like you\nknow what\ni kind of like singing\ni would like to become a professional\nsinger even if you've never taken any\nsinging lessons but you're pretty good\nright now you're like i got a little bit\nof talent let me take some lessons let\nme work it every day and every day let\nme work on my singing my songwriting my\nguitar playing my singing my songwriting\nguitar playing and you work it every\nsingle day there's no reason why you\ncan't be one of the best in the world\nisn't that the cool thing like i think\nthat is the most amazing thing about\nbeing a human is if i find one thing\nthat i am hardcore about i can become\nthe best of the world if i really want\nto\nso if you look at that my first question\nto you is what is the thing that you\nwant to put your life into what is it do\nyou know what it is\nif you don't know what it is\ncan you find it what is it that you'd be\nlike if i could be the best in the world\nat one thing what would that thing be\nbecause if i could put my talents and my\nskills and my drive into this thing i\ncould become one of the best there's no\nreason why you can't become one of the\nbest in the world of whatever it is that\nyou want to do\nand that's what's amazing about being a\nwork about being a workhorse and going\nfor what it is that you want\nbut\nif we're looking back at tom brady his\nentire life is built around being one of\nthe best football players ever and to be\none of the best football players his\ndiets his workouts what time he goes to\nsleep all of the stuff that he does on a\ndaily basis is built around\n[Music]\nhow can he become the best and how can\nhe sustain where he currently is at 43\nyears old playing with people that are\n17 years younger than him on average\nand realize that he can continue to keep\nplaying for at least the next two three\nfour maybe five years the dude could\nplay until he's 50 years of football one\nof the hardest sports in the entire\nworld he could play up until 50 years\nold\nwhy because he's dedicated his life to\nthis thing\nwhat do you want to dedicate your life\nto\nthink about that once you figure out\nwhat that thing is then you got to ask\nyourself the question okay now that i've\nfigured out what this thing is\nwhat do i need to do\nokay so what do i need to start doing\nin order to become one of the best in\nthe world\nlet's go back to the singer-songwriter\nokay if i want to become a\nsinger-songwriter i should probably sing\nevery single day work on my vocals try\nto become better i should probably write\nsongs every single day i should probably\ngo to you know take songwriting lessons\nyou can take those online\nwhatever it is that you want to do you\ncan master\nso then you say what should i start\ndoing\nin order to become the greatest at\nwhatever this is\nokay\nwhat should i stop doing in order to\ncontinue in order to actually go and to\nbecome the best version of this okay\nmaybe i should stop drinking alcohol and\ndrinking coffee because those things can\nmess with your vocal cords i don't know\nit's something along those lines you can\nfigure out so you what do you need to\nstart doing what do you need to stop\ndoing\nokay next question\nfor you to become one of the best in the\nworld at whatever it is that you want to\ndo\nwho should you surround yourself with\nlet's say you want to become an actor\nokay what should you start doing what\nshould you stop doing who should you\nsurround yourself with in order to\nbecome an actor\nwho should you stop surrounding yourself\nwith if you want to become the best\nactor in the world who should you get\naround who should you get away from\nthese are all things you should think\nabout\nand you start realizing\nthat greatness isn't just something that\npeople are born with greatness is\nsomething that is built and that's\namazing because you can be great at\nwhatever it is that you want to do and\nif i look at my life if i look at\neverything that i've done i've tried to\nbuild my life around becoming one of the\nbest at what i do one of the best\npodcasters in the world one of the best\nmindset mentors in the world one of the\nbest you know writers in the world which\ni have a book coming out and we're\nworking on it right now and so it's like\ni've built my entire life around this\nand i'm not an nfl quarterback or an\nelite athlete or any of that type of\nstuff but i'm a podcaster i'm a youtuber\ni'm a quote unquote social media\ninfluencer even though i hate that\nphrase but that's would be the category\nthat i fall into and my goal\nis to help change the mindset of the\nworld\nand so the more that i learn\nthat helps me teach so then i've got to\nbuild a system of how i can learn every\nsingle day and i have an hour built out\nevery single day where i'll follow\ncertain neurologists or psychologists or\npeople that are in early childhood\ndevelopment so that i can learn more\nabout mindset and about the brain so\nthat i can teach more of these things so\ni can help more people i've built a\nsystem around it right from the moment i\nwake up i've tried to figure out a way\nof when i wake up to support me to\nbecome better i\nwake up earlier so that i have more time\nto work on myself because the better\nthat i am the better that go into the\nday so then i have my morning routine\nbuilt around this\ni don't drink a whole lot of alcohol why\ndon't i drink a whole lot of alcohol not\nbecause i don't like it but because of\nthe fact that alcohol stays in your\nsystem for 80 hours\nand i know that if i'm going to try to\nlearn\nevery single day and retain this\ninformation and then teach it to people\nand then make content and try to put it\nall down and you know take something\ncomplex and put into something that\npeople can understand if i have alcohol\nrunning through my system from a couple\ndays before that's making me a little\nbit foggier than if i hadn't drank it\nthen why would i drink it in the first\nplace and so for me it just doesn't\nnecessarily fit with the lifestyle that\ni'm built and what i'm trying to do\nright i'm just giving you these examples\nbecause it's examples that you could use\nin your life as well the food i eat and\nwhen i eat you know i found that if i\neat heavy foods i get really tired so\nguess what i don't eat any heavy foods i\nfound very specific things that i can\neat in the middle of the day that don't\ntake energy away from me because\ndigestion is the number one thing that\ncan steal energy away from your body\nso if i'm trying to create content like\ni am right now\nif i were to eat a hamburger 30 minutes\nago i would be foggy as hell right now\nand if i'm foggy in my brain i'm not\ngoing to be giving the best content i\npossibly can so i pay attention to you\nknow the food that i eat working out\nthis freaking body of mine is my vessel\nand the better that it's the shape that\nit's in the better i'm gonna be able to\ncome up with content to deliver content\nevery single thing so it's from the\nmoment that i wake up the food that i\neat the alcohol that i don't drink the\nworking out the water that i drink all\nof these things are built into a system\nfor me to be able to learn more to\ncreate better content to deliver more\ncontent than anybody else that's in my\nindustry to possibly become one of the\nbest in the world at what it is that i\ndo right so my life is built around how\ncan i be the best at this thing that i'm\ndoing right now\nand that's cool the reason why is\nbecause i wasn't born gifted in this\nthing that i'm doing now\nyou know i wasn't born the one of the\nthe top podcasters in the world neither\nwere you so if you want to start a\npodcast what's different between me and\nyou nothing i've just got a few years on\nyou so why can't you build one of the\nbiggest podcasts in the world why can't\nyou be one of the biggest youtubers in\nthe world why can't you be one of the\nbest athletes in the world why can't you\nbe one of the best singers in the world\nwhy can't you be one of the best actors\nin the entire world the only thing\nthat's holding you back is the limiting\nbeliefs that you don't think that you\ncan actually do it and you need to\nfigure out what it is that you want to\ndedicate your life to and put every\nounce of energy into it that's the\nbeautiful thing about greatness that's\nthe beautiful thing about mastery so you\nstart to look at every single thing that\nyou do\nwhat does it look like for you what\nwould make\nyour life easier if you want to become a\nyoutuber what would make it easier for\nyou to create content\nif you want to become the best singer\nwhat would make it easier for you to\nmake more incredible\nmusic if you want to become the best\nartist in the world what do you need to\ndo in order to become the best artist in\nthe world who do you need to surround\nyourself with what things on a daily\nbasis what alcohol should you or should\nyou not drink\nright what food should you or should you\nnot eat how often should you or should\nyou not work out who should you surround\nyourself with and what you realize is\nthat greatness is not something that\npeople are born with greatness is\nsomething that you build yourself into\nit's literally right there for every\nsingle person to take if they want to\nbut the difference is\nyou have to figure out what it is that\nyou're willing to put your entire life\ninto\nif you don't know what it is that's okay\nbut can you figure out what it is\nand then once you figure out what that\nthing is say how can i build a system a\nlife that supports me in every single\naspect to become absolutely great at\nbeing a singer at being an actor and\nbeing a youtuber being a musician and\nbeing whatever it is an artist whatever\nit is that you truly want to be\ngreatness is so freaking close to you\nbut you have to number one decide what\nit is number two you have to fully\ncommit to it number three you have to\nask yourself what systems can i build in\nmy life to make it easier for me to\nbecome better at this thing that i want\nto become better at and then you have to\nrealize it takes 10 000 hours so it's\ngot to be something that you love what\ndo i need to do to work my ass off to\nbecome one of the best in the world at\nthis thing\nif you can figure out what it is\nand you can put every ounce of energy\ninto it\ni promise you this you won't get to the\nend of your life and be on your deathbed\nand think damn i wish i would have done\nmore\ngreatness is within you you just have to\nmake the decision to bring it out hey\nthanks so much for watching this video\nif you want to learn even more about\nmastering your mind click right here and\nwatch this video as well what if i told\nyou that\nin 10 years 10 years from today\nyou will have a life that you absolutely\nlove like the perfect life\nwould that excite you"
