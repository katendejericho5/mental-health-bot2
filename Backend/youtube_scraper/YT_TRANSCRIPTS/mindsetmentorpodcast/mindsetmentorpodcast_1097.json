    "transcript": "ask yourself this question to just cut\nthrough all of the bs is what i'm doing\nright now getting me closer to or\nfurther from my goals\ntoday i'm going to be giving you my\nseven tips to maximize your productivity\nand your focus in every single thing\nthat you do and i'm also going to give\nyou my number one tip for productivity\nand focus the thing that's helped me\nmore than anything else and so if you're\ntrying to be productive if you're trying\nto create the life that you want these\nseven tips will help you one of the\nthings i want to say before i give you\nthe tips is this do not ever say the\nphrase i don't have enough time\nlet me say that again don't ever say\nthat you don't have enough time i\npromise you that there is somebody who\nhas been in the exact same situation as\nyou or very similar that has been able\nto create the life that you want and so\nif somebody else has done it there is\nabsolutely no reason why you can't do it\nas well don't blame it on your children\nand say oh i've got children and that's\nthe reason why i don't have enough time\ndon't say oh i've got a full-time job\nand that's the reason why i don't have\nenough time or don't say i don't have\nenough money and that's the reason i\ndon't have enough time whatever it is\njust admit to yourself finally that all\nof that is just an excuse and that\nyou're going to create the life that you\nwant to no matter what\ncool\ncan we all agree on that\nhere we go instead of saying i don't\nhave enough time just say it's not a\npriority for me\nbecause that's the truth it's not that\nyou don't have enough time it's just\nthat you haven't made that thing a\npriority just say you don't care instead\nof saying well i don't have enough time\nto create my my dream life just say i\ndon't make my dream life a priority and\nsee if that starts to shift your mindset\na little bit more into creating the life\nthat you want because ultimately what it\ncomes down to is intention and so when\nwe go into these seven steps realize\nthat you have to put intention into\nevery single thing that you do\nand if you do you put intention into\nbecoming better at focus and becoming\nbetter being more productive and getting\nthings done you will eventually get\nwhatever it is that you want in life\nguaranteed\nso let me give you my seven tips for\nmaximizing your productivity and your\nfocus number one get some freaking\nheadphones and i would say don't just if\nyou really want a tip\ninvest\na little bit of money into a really\ngreat pair of headphones don't just use\nyour apple headphones you just put them\nin and you can still hear everything\noutside of it the ones you get for free\nwith your iphone actually go and invest\ni don't know 50 100 200 300 into a good\nset of headphones\ni like to use the ones that i have i\ndon't know the exact brand i know the\nbrand is sony but i don't know exactly\nwhich ones they are but they are noise\ncancelling so literally what i do is i\nput on headphones i click on the noise\ncanceling so i can hear nothing outside\nof it\nand then what do i do i put on some\nfocus music binaries beats and that's\nwhat i listen to\nso literally if a train were to go by i\nprobably wouldn't hear the train which\nmeans that that's if i'm focused if i'm\nin the zone of something i want to have\nmy headphones on so that nothing can\npull me out of that focus why because\nyou know you've been really focused\nbefore and then somebody taps you on the\nshoulder or somebody makes a phone call\nto you and then you get out of it for 30\nseconds and then you try to get back in\nhow detrimental that can be that 30\nseconds of pulling you out of focus can\nbe and so if you have noise cancelling\nheadphones and you're listening to\nbinaural beats or you're listening to\nsomething that has absolutely no words\nin it it makes it so much easier to\nfocus\nso get a really good set of headphones\nthe other reason the reason why\nheadphones are great is because people\nare less likely to walk up to you and\nsteal your attention away if you have\nheadphones on so if you don't have\nheadphones on it makes it easier for\nsomeone to just say something to you\nacross the room you know if you you work\nin an open air area\npeople can just say something over to\nyou and steal your focus away if you\nhave your headphones on they could go oh\nyeah i guess i'll talk to him later\nright so put on headphones and find\nmusic that has absolutely no words\nthat you can just put on and listen to\nyou may have heard me say before but i\nhave songs that i listen to just for\nfocus i have one song one youtube video\ni put in focused binaural beats on\nyoutube and it's the one if you want to\nuse the same one that i am\nfocused by narrow beats on youtube and\nit's a little neon owl is the one that i\nlisten to it's like three hours long and\ni listen to that so much that my brain\nknows when this song is on\nrod focuses\nso\nbuy a good set of headphones\nif they're a good set and you invest\ninto them it makes you more likely to\ntake it serious and more likely to\nactually use the headphones and to be\nmore serious about getting stuff done\nsecond tip that i'll give you which is\nmy number one tip actually for being\nhighly productive but this is tip number\ntwo right here\nis to do the pomodoro technique you may\nhave heard me talk about the pomodoro\ntechnique but it is incredible it has\nchanged my life as far as getting\ndone\nand stop multitasking multitasking\nactually they have found makes you\ndumber you do worse work\nslower\nwhen you multitask what you should do is\nwhat they call single tasking doing one\nthing at a time the pomodoro technique\nis perfect for this it's super simple\nyou do 25 minutes of work\nfive minute break\nbut those 25 minutes of work is focused\non one thing and one thing only so you\nsay okay i have task xyz in front of me\nthis task has to be done today i'm gonna\ngo for 25 minutes maybe you don't finish\noff those 25 minutes but at least you\nget a break and then you go back into it\n25 minutes on five minutes off 25\nminutes on five minutes off 25 minutes\non five minutes off where you focus on\none task and one task only if an idea\ncomes into your head\njot it down with pen and paper don't\nlook at your phone just have a journal\nnext to you and write down that idea and\ngo right back to what you're doing\nbefore\nwhile you're doing the pomodoro\ntechnique put your freaking headphones\non right stay locked in you ask yourself\nthe question like if i'm trying to be\nfocused and i'm trying to be productive\nthe thought that i have in my head is i\nneed to be locked in\nwhat is going to assist me in being more\nlocked in headphones that'll help me be\nlocked in pomodoro technique that'll\nhelp me be locked in 25 minutes on five\nminutes off if you want to hear me go\ndeeper into the pomodoro technique just\ngoogle rob dial pomodoro technique or go\nto youtube and type in rob dial pomodoro\ntechnique i have entire lessons on just\nspecifically how to maximize the\npomodoro technique so stop multitasking\nstart single tasking and when you single\ntask use a pomodoro technique\nthat's tip number two tip number three\ntake your to-do list if you're a to-do\nlist person you have 30 things on your\nto-do list let me make your life super\nsimple okay\ni know and i've seen i've i know because\ni've done this and i've talked to so\nmany people i've done this before you'll\nmake a to-do list and you'll be like oh\nmy god i got to do this thing and you go\ndo that thing and you come back to your\nto-do list and write that thing down on\nyour to-do list and then cross it off so\nyou feel like you crossed something off\nin your to this right you've done this\nbefore we've all done this before in\nsome different way\nthe easiest thing to do is this if you\nwant to get\nhyper productive and hyper focused is\nproductive means doing the important\nthings getting the important things done\nthat need to be done right make your\nto-do list and then what i want you to\ndo is circle on your to-do list if it's\n20 things let's say the three most\nimportant things\ncircle the three most important things\ntake out a three by five card an index\ncard\nwrite down number one the most important\nthing that's that's the hit list i need\nto get if nothing else gets done today\ni've got to get my most important task\ndone\nthen i write down number two\nand then i write down number three then\nwhat i do is i take that three by five\ncard and i put it in my back pocket and\ni leave the to-do list wherever it was i\ncan leave it on my desk i can come back\nto it later but now\ninstead of having 20 things that i have\nto focus on which can make me feel\nreally scattered and if i feel really\nscattered i'm less likely to actually\nget that thing done and to do it instead\nof doing that what am i going to do i'm\ngoing to take that list of 20 things\nmake it into a list of three things and\nthen only focus on those three things\nand that's it for the day i'm gonna\nfocus on number one and i won't do\nanything else until number one is done\nonce number one is done i can cross it\noff now i can go number two and i won't\ndo anything else until number two is\ndone and then once number two is done\nthen i can go to number three and i\nwon't do anything else until i get\nnumber three done if i just get my most\nimportant things done every single day\nthat's a really freaking productive day\nand i might not get the other 17 things\ndone\nbut they weren't important in the first\nplace the three most important things\nwere on that index card let's say i do\nhappen to finish those three things then\ni can go to the rest of the to-do list\nand figure out what's most important\nafter that but what it comes down to\nis\nis being productive versus being busy\nwhich is what we're going to go into in\nthe next one so the next one is being\nproductive versus being busy\nif you think about it tip number four\nbeing productive versus being busy a lot\nof times people will call themself\noh i don't have enough time i'm too busy\ndoing things you're doing busy work\nyou're not doing productive work when i\nsay you take a list of 20 things and\nshorten it into three things and\nconcentrate on those three things and\nonly focus on those that's called being\nproductive\nbeing busy is just taking time and\nfocusing on doing whatever it is i need\nto you know just getting stuff done so\nlet's say for instance i run a business\nright and i might have\nmake 10 sales calls that might be the\ntop of my list i might have reach out to\nmy you know\nemployee and talk to them about this i\nmight have you know make a lesson that\nmight be another thing that helps me\nand then also on that to us i might have\ndo my laundry\nright and then i go well doing laundry\nis easy i won't get rejected\ni can do laundry at least cross\nsomething off my to-do list so then you\nask yourself is doing laundry\nbeing productive or is it being busy\nit's just being busy i'm just acting\nlike i'm keeping myself busy doing\nthings when in reality i'm not doing\nanything actually means something for my\nbusiness so\nwhen you look at tip number four\nam i being busy am i being productive\nright one of the things that i find that\nholds most people back is that they\nthink that they're being productive when\nin reality they're just keeping\nthemselves busy right they go oh you\nknow what i've gotta\nlike for instance i could go i gotta\nmake a podcast episode and i could go\ni'm gonna i'm gonna do an episode i'm\nbeing being you know being focused and i\ncan spend the next 10 hours\nactually researching being focused or i\ncould go i'm going to spend 20 minutes\nabout being you know trying to be\nfocused and then i'm going to start\nactually creating content right the\ncreating content is most important part\nof what i do so i don't need to spend 10\nhours\nfocusing and figuring out how to create\nthe best podcast episode i need to spend\n20 30 minutes focusing putting it\ntogether and then boom i need to record\nit because recording it is the actual\nmost important part which is the\nproductive side of it people go oh you\nknow what\ni want to uh\nyou know i want to uh work out more\nand then so instead of actually going to\nthe gym which would be being the\nproductive side of it they go you know\nwhat i'm gonna i'm i'm gonna research\nfor the next three hours the best\nprotein\ni'm gonna research the best diet and all\nthe stuff that's important yes but\nthat's not gonna move the needle\nlike going to the gym well right being\nproductive go to the gym pick up weights\nput weights down throw them at the\nceiling that's being productive being\nbusy is i'm going to spend the next few\nhours researching the best diet plan and\nresearching the best protein and\nresearching the best workouts and\nresearching this and researching this\nis it important in some way yes but it's\none-tenth of the amount of importance of\nactually going to the gym if you're\ntrying to lose weight make sense so are\nyou being busy or are you being\nproductive ask yourself this question to\njust cut through all of the bs is what\ni'm doing right now getting me closer to\nor further from my goals\nis what i'm doing right now getting me\ncloser to her further from my goals ask\nyourself that 100 times a day i\nguarantee you're going to find yourself\nbeing way more focused and way more\nproductive of doing everything that you\nneed to do is what i'm doing right now\nget me closer to or further from my\ngoals\nsimple that's all you got to do\nso then you look at you say okay is\nresearching protein for the next two\nhours getting me closer to or further\nfrom my goals ah it's actually getting\nme further from my goals is is going and\nbuying new yoga pants getting me closer\nto or further from my goals uh that\nhonestly that's getting me further from\nmy goals just going and doing yoga would\nbe getting me closer to it\nso you have to realize you can either be\nproductive or you can be busy and the\nway that you decipher what you're being\nas you say is what i'm doing right now\ni'm getting closer to or further from\nour goals so that's tip number four are\nyou being busy or being productive tip\nnumber five\nis to find your peak hours everybody has\npeak hours it's usually about two to\nfour hours where you are the most\nfocused where you do your best work for\nme it's from 10 a.m to 2 p.m that's my\nmost\nfocused peak hours all of the most\nimportant stuff that i do in my day is\ndone between the hours of ten and two\nright for you\nit might be the same time for you it\nmight be later on at night for you it\nmight be earlier in the morning find\nyour peak time i know i have friends\nthat wake up at three o'clock in the\nmorning because they have kids they wake\nup with you know i have a friend that\nruns a business and he wakes up between\nthree to four o'clock in the morning and\nhe runs a 30 million dollar your\nbusiness because he wants to be out\nbefore he wants to be up before his kids\nso he can get as much done as he\npossibly can right\nhis peak hours is he likes to wake up\nand work as soon as he gets up i don't\nlike to work as soon as i wake up so\nit's different for everybody when are\nyour peak hours when are your three to\nfour hours of peak time where you can\nreally get locked in because that's what\nwe're trying to do we're trying to get\nlocked in and being focused and being\nproductive\nif you try to have me get a lot of\ndone after 7 p.m it's not happening\nbecause usually throughout the day i'm\nworking so hard that my brain is fried\nafter 7 p.m so that's just the way that\ni am but do you know the way that you\nare do you know when your peak hours are\nthink about that\nthat is tip number five tip number six\nis to clean up all of the that's\naround you right a cluttered cluttered\nspace a cluttered mind is is usually the\nthe key to it now are you gonna have\neverything being perfect around you\nabsolutely not\nbut if there's crap all over the place\nand you're trying to be productive and\nyou're spending 50 of your time rustling\nthrough things to try to find the things\nthat you need to\nthat's going to hold you back from being\nproductive if you have crap all over\nyour desk and you can't find what you\nneed to in order to get stuff done\nthat's holding you back it's taking time\naway from you so\nwhat what if you were just to hire\nsomebody to come in and tidy up your\nspace for you right that'd be one of the\nbest 100 or 200 you've ever spent\nis it\nis it beneficial to have someone if you\nwork from home right now because\neverything that's happening is it\nbeneficial for you to spend 150 bucks to\nhave someone come and completely clean\nyour place\nto make everything more organized\nto get rid of all of the crap that's on\nthe floor to do your dishes for you to\ndo your your laundry for you is there\nbenefit into paying somebody to do those\nthings for you\nyou know is is it is it more beneficial\nfor you to put your time\ninto doing laundry or if you were to\ntake the same amount of time that it\ntook you to do all that laundry and\nactually put it into work would you make\nmore money working\nthan you would doing laundry\nand if you would\nmaybe you should hire somebody if it\ncosts you a hundred bucks for someone to\nhave someone do your laundry and it\ntakes them two hours but you make a\nhundred dollars on you know 100 an hour\nand you would say okay if i work about\n100 an hour you know if it cost me you\nknow 100 bucks to have somebody do this\nand in that time that i could have\nsomebody do this i could make 200 bucks\nlet's say let's say\non average you make 200 an hour and it\ntakes somebody an hour to do all of your\nlaundry right you would make if it's a\nhundred bucks to do all of your laundry\nwhich i explain this so it makes the\nmost sense if it costs 100 bucks in an\nhour for someone to do your laundry and\nyou make about 200 in an hour when\nyou're hyper productive that means by\npaying somebody a hundred dollars and\nyou make 200 that you're actually\nnetting 100 extra dollars most people\ndon't think about this they just think\noh i got to pay somebody and i don't\nwant to pay somebody because i'm too\ncheap\nbut if you're net positive in the\nrevenue that you make or the amount of\nmoney that you bring in it's worth it\nfor you to do that so maybe it's worth\nit for someone to come in and clean your\nplace maybe it's worth it for someone to\ndo your lunch maybe it's worth it for\nsomeone to do your landscaping maybe\nit's worth it to outsource things so\nthat you can be more productive at what\nwhatever it is that you do\nbecause you only get\n24 hours every single day\nand if you're sleeping afraid of it\nyou're only awake for 16 of it so how\ncan you be more focused and more\nproductive and outsource the things that\nyou don't necessarily need to do how can\nyou clean things up okay and the last\nthing that i'll tell you is this\ntip number seven is to batch your tasks\nwhat do i mean by batching it i'll give\nyou the perfect example you take\neverything that you do and if you do\nsomething\nover and over again can you do all of\nthose at one point in time like for\ninstance if you wake up in the morning\nand you're like you know what i'm just\ngoing to get all my emails done first\nthing in the morning and later at night\nand you just do all of your emails in\nthe morning and at night then you don't\nhave to do your emails throughout the\nday and you can focus on other things\nyou need to do\nright now i'm recording this this\nepisode this is the third one that we've\nrecorded in a row all i do is literally\nchange my shirt i'm not lying to you\nthis is the third shirt that i've been\nwearing in the past hour and a half why\nbecause i'm batching the stuff that i'm\ndoing right first shirt okay so now i'm\nwearing for those of you guys that\naren't watching the video i'm wearing a\ngreen shirt the episode i did before\nthis which was literally recorded right\nbefore this i was wearing a maroon shirt\nthe episode i did before that i was\nwearing a gray uh sweater that said be a\nnice human right i just recorded and\nmade it look like it was a different day\nit's the same damn day but why do i do\nthat because it's easier to batch my\ntasks and to get my stuff done all at\nonce because what do i do\nwake up in the morning today i've\nplanned out four episodes right now\nwe're recording three episodes later on\nin this week we'll record another three\nepisodes so if i put out three episodes\nper week monday wednesday friday and\nthen i have a bonus one that comes out\non thursday i only need to record most\nof the time one day to get all of next\nweek done\nright so what can you batch in your life\nto make you more productive your emails\nyour phone calls your meetings right my\ntuesdays are my busiest days why because\ni batch all of my coaching calls and all\nof my calls you know i've got business\nbreakthrough which is where i teach\ncoaches how to build coaching businesses\ni teach them how to make money and how\nto make six figure businesses i do my\ncall with them on tuesday then on\ntuesday i've also got my accelerator\nprogram later on which is the the\nadvanced mindset course that i have i do\nthat on tuesday as well because i know\ntuesday is my coaching day so i can get\nmy coaching brain on put on my coaching\nhelmet and get that done on tuesday and\nthen i don't have to worry about it for\nthe rest of the week\nbatching stuff will make you way more\nfocused\nand way more productive i cannot\nrecommend it enough so batch all of the\ntasks that you do if you can batch them\nso that is tip number seven so you only\nhave 24 hours in the day every single\nperson alive only has 24 hours in the\nday so you have to figure out how can\nyou get more locked in how can you get\nmore focused how can you get more\nproductive and ask yourself this\nquestion is what i'm doing right now\ngetting me closer to or further from my\ngoals if you ask yourself that a hundred\ntimes a day and you focus on being\nproductive and you focus on being\nfocused you will get a whole lot more\n done than everybody else\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well how\nmany times have you started to do really\nwell and it stopped and it started to do\nreally well and it stopped too many\ntimes\n[Music]"
