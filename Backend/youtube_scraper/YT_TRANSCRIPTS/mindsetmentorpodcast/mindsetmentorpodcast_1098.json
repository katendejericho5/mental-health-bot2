    "transcript": "good morning everybody today's gonna be\na beautiful day\ndo you want to go back to dreaming or do\nyou want to go to actually creating your\ndreams\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nbrainwash yourself for success so if\nyou're somebody who wants to be\nsuccessful if you're somebody who wants\nto create the life that you want to i'm\ngoing to teach you actually how to\nbrainwash yourself to be successful now\ni understand the word\nbrainwash has a very bad connotation but\nwhen i start to\nactually describe what i mean by that\nit'll make a whole lot of sense to you\nand the reason why is because every\nsingle thing every single thing that you\nhear\nevery single thing that you see touch\nfeel taste all of those things are all\nbrainwashing they're all going into your\nbrain through some form or another\nwhether that's something that you see or\nsomething that you hear\nall of that stuff is going into your\nbrain your brain is getting it in there\nit's filtering it through and then it's\njust storing all of the information is\ntrue and so when you realize that every\nsingle bit of information every single\nthing that comes into your awareness is\nbrainwashing you you start to realize\ndamn maybe i should pay a lot more\nattention\nto the stuff that's coming into my\nawareness because ultimately the stuff\nthat comes into my awareness is going to\ndictate who i'm going to become\ntherefore how successful i'm going to be\nand so\ni'm going to give you guys a ton of\nquestions and a ton of things that i\nwant you to think about and i'm gonna go\nthrough different areas of your life and\nhow to change them up and how to\nbrainwash yourself to be successful\nfirst thing i think about\nis every morning starts with your alarm\ngoing off\nright so how do you wake up\nfirst thing to think about when your\nmorning starts how do you wake up do you\nwake up and hit the snooze button three\ntimes\nbecause you have to realize if you hit\nthe snooze think about the psychology of\nhitting the snooze button\nyou planned to wake up at let's say 6am\nand your alarm goes off at 6am and you\ngo i'm going to wait till 10 more\nminutes at 6 10. now i'm going to wait\nfor 10 more at 6 20. i'm gonna wait for\n10 minutes 6 30 right\nyou start your day off with a failure\nthink about that psychologically\nhow you start your day is going to carry\nover to the rest of your days the rest\nof the day so if you're starting your\nday off by hitting the snooze button\neven if it's just once do you see how\nyou're actually starting your day off on\nyour back foot you're starting your day\noff with a failure versus a win\nif you get up and you immediately turn\nthat alarm off and you go to brush your\nteeth and you get up you're starting\nyour day off with a win versus starting\nyour day off with a loss so how do you\nstart your day\nokay next thing when you wake up what\nare the feelings that you have as soon\nas you wake up is it you know oh my god\ni'm so grateful that i got another day\nthat's not that's not very common with a\nlot of people or is it [ __ ] i just want\nto sleep some more\nthink about that for a second\nbecause that's also starting your day\nwith a win or a loss do you start you're\nlike oh my god i just wish i could\nfreaking sleep more\nright or do you want to go back to\ndreaming or do you want to go to\nactually creating your dreams\nthat's the difference in the way that\nyou wake up so how do you wake up every\nsingle day\nright the next thing i think about as\nfar as you know brainwash yourself to be\nsuccessful is then what does your\nmorning routine look like is your\nmorning first off number one do you have\na morning routine\nyou should always have a morning routine\nin some sort of way because that's how\nit starts your day but if you do you\nhave a morning routine or not\nif you do\nis it planned or do you just kind of\ngo into it and try to figure it out\nis it intentional\ndo you go into your day with every with\nevery single bit of intention do you\nhave it are you like okay you know this\nis what i want to feel today so\ntherefore i'm going to go and i'm going\nto start my day this way i want to feel\njoy and peace and calm today so i'm\ngoing to start my day with 15 minutes of\ngratitude in my meditation and be\ngrateful for every single thing that i\nhave so that i get more of that\nright do you start your day that way or\ndo you start your day like just\n[ __ ] i gotta wake up i gotta take a\nshower i gotta get out of here real\nquick because i gotta be at work in 20\nminutes\nhow do you start your day what does your\nmorning routine look like\nalso another good question do you review\nyour goals every single morning right\nsuccessful people review their goals\noften so do you review your goals every\nsingle morning what's your new year's\nresolution do you review your new year's\nresolutions every single morning do you\nreview your monthly goals every single\nmorning right do you review your day do\nyou have a plan where you take time\nevery single day and you look at what\nyour day is going to look like in the\nmorning so that you can go into that day\nwith intention\nthink about that for a second\nthe way that you wake up\nmatters\nthe first hour of your day\nmatters\nare you going into it with intention\nand being proactive are you going to it\nand being reactive\nare you looking at your phone\nimmediately and getting sucked into\ninstagram and text messages and emails\nand phone calls or you going you know\nwhat i'm going to focus on myself\nfor the first hour of my day\nand i'm going to plan on how i can just\nfocus on myself and then i can go into\nemails and then i can go into text\nmessages and get the kids ready or\nwhatever it is just you have going on\nso what does the day look like for you\nwhen you start if you want to brainwash\nyourself from the very beginning\nthink about that the way that you start\nyour day the way they start every single\nday matters\nnext thing throughout your entire day\nwhat are you filling your brain with\nif you want to brainwash yourself to be\nsuccessful\nshouldn't you be filling your brain with\nthings that are going to make you\nsuccessful shouldn't you be turning off\nthe news because i guarantee you if you\nwant to be successful\nwatching the news is going to hold you\nback from doing that\nright so do you watch cnn or fox news or\nmsnbc or cnbc or any of those things do\nyou go straight into it or do you get\nyour news from\nyou know all of the crazy things that\nare happening around the world from\ngoogle or yahoo or any of that stuff i\nguarantee you this if you're filling\nyour brain with that stuff\nyou're not going to want to be freaking\nmotivated to go and make an incredible\nday\nso think about that what are you filling\nyour brain with what are you filling\nyour brain with from the moment that you\nwake up until the moment that you go to\nbed every single thing that you come in\ncontact with on a daily basis on an\nhourly basis on a minute basis is\nbrainwashing you in some sort of way are\nyou in control of that brainwashing or\nis somebody else in control of that\nbrainwashing\nbecause there's brainwashing going on\ngood thing is you can control it if you\nreally want to\nanother question what are you reading\nthe average ceo reads 60 books per year\nthat's over a book a week are you\nreading in the first place\nif you just want to be successful and\nyou see okay if i just want to be\nsuccessful i should probably follow the\nsame steps of other successful people\nright that wouldn't make a whole lot of\nsense so that's the case and i realized\nokay\nceos tend to be successful ceos read 60\nbooks per year maybe i should start\nreading more because at this point in\ntime i'm not even reading a book a year\nmaybe i should just start reading more\nokay what are you reading are you\nreading at all\nfirst off\nif the average ceo reads 60 books per\nyear realize they're not just reading 60\nnon-fiction books per year they're\nreading books that are going to help\nthem progress and get better are you\nreading nonfiction are you reading\nfiction are you reading business books\nare you reading self-help books are you\nreading books that are going to make you\nbetter\nwhat are you reading\nhow are you doing that\nokay what are you listening to\nthroughout the day are you listening to\nmusic\nwhat type of music are you listening to\ni'll tell you this this is something\nthat you've probably heard me if you've\nbeen following me for years my stance\nhas changed a lot over the years i love\nmusic i'm a musician i listen to all\ntypes of music but i have this big\nawakening\nthat music is just affirmations\nwith melody behind it right\nso if you listen to some of the music\nthat's out there\nare these the things that i want to\naffirm into my life this person that i'm\nlistening to do i want to affirm\nthe stuff that they're saying into my\nlife or am i looking and going oh i\ndon't want to brainwash myself into\nbelieving what they're saying\nor are you going i'm going to be intense\nby what i'm listening to the music that\ni'm listening to hey maybe i'll just\nshut the music off\nand i'll listen to podcasts maybe i'll\nshut the music off\nand i'll listen to some inspirational\nstuff on youtube\nmaybe i'll just shut the music off and\ni'll be with my own thoughts all day\nlong so that i can control what's going\non inside of my brain\nwhat are you listening to what are you\nreading what are you allowing into your\nbrain\nit's something to think about because\nmost people don't pay as much attention\nto all of these little teeny tiny things\nokay another really big one you've heard\nme talk about many times who are you\nsurrounding yourself with\nyou've heard me say it over and over\nagain and the reason why is because it's\nso freaking important you're the average\nof the five people that you spend the\nmost time with who in the hell are you\nspending the most time with\nwrite it down with a pen and paper look\nat your top five and say are these the\npeople that are supporting my growth\ninto who i want to be\nor these people keeping me in place\nor these people actually pulling me back\ninto who not not even not even allowing\nme to progress into being the person i\nwant to be\ni say it all the time if you hang out\nfive millionaires you're gonna be the\nsix if you hang out with five alcoholics\nyou're gonna be the six if you hang out\nwith five really fit people you're gonna\nbe the six if you hang out with five\nreally overweight people you're gonna be\nthe six you are the average of the five\npeople you spend the most time with i\nguarantee you that\nif you hang out people that complain all\nthe time you're going to have a negative\nmindset you're going to be complaining\ninside of your own head they do not help\nyou and assist you into becoming who you\nwant to be so how do you brainwash\nyourself to be successful you hang out\nwith other people who are either\nsuccessful\nor are on the same path as you working\nto get better every single day so that\nmakes it easier for you to become that\nway when you look at your top five this\nis one of the things that's super\nimportant you should have three people\naround three people this can change a\nlittle bit but just this is very\nimportant to understand around three\npeople\nwho are\nin the same vicinity as you as far as\nsuccess happiness the amount of money in\ntheir bank account\nall of the stuff that you want peace joy\nall of those things\nthree people that are around the same as\nyou but they're also pushing themselves\nto get to where they want to be which is\nalso where you want to be so it's not\njust like you know you make 50 000 a\nyear and you hang out three people who\nare also making 50 000 a year it's more\nlike you hang out with you make 50 grand\nthey make 50 grand but they want to make\na million and you also want to make a\nmillion so then you're you're all going\ntowards towards the same goal versus\njust staying in the exact same place you\nneed three people that are around the\nsame as you\nbut pushing themselves to be better\nright you want to have one person that's\nabout two to four years in front of you\nthis could be somewhere you're like all\nright my business is at a hundred\nthousand dollars in a year\nokay so i've got three friends that\ntheir businesses are doing around a\nhundred thousand dollars per year and\nthey're all trying to get better i have\none friend who's about two to four years\nahead of me he's doing about five\nhundred thousand dollars a year okay if\nthey're there because you can help them\nthey can help you and they also show you\nwhat's next for you so it's like the\nfriend and the mentor a little bit of a\nmentor that shows you what's next\nthey're a couple years ahead of you two\nto four years ahead it's important to\nhave that person that's around you\nbecause it shows you what you're really\nclose to\nand that's inspiring to see\nmakes you want to get better\nbut then you have another person the\nlast one is someone who is very far\nahead of you someone who is ten plus\nyears ahead of you right do you have\nfriends and you might say well i don't\nhave anything in common with people that\nare ten plus years older than me believe\nme you have a lot more in common than\nyou realize i have some friends that are\n10 and 20 years older than me but\nwe have a mutually beneficial\nrelationship where i help them with\ncertain things they help me with certain\nthings but it shows me okay you know\nthis friend of mine is worth 150 million\ndollars which is way further ahead than\nme\nbut it shows me what's possible over the\nnext 10 or 15 years if i continue down\nthis path so who are you surrounding\nyourself with so three people around the\nsame as you that are on the same path\none person the fourth person is going to\nbe somebody who's about two to four\nyears in front of you and then one\nperson is far ahead of you 10 15 20\nyears ahead that is literally like this\nis who i could be if i just continue on\nthis path what's interesting is it's\nkind of like you learn through osmosis\nthey learn from you you learn from from\nthem and just that you get to see how\nsomebody that's far ahead of you and the\nthe standard that they hold themselves\nto and naturally you start to hold\nyourself to a higher standard and go you\nknow what\nthis person's amazing but\nthey're not out of reach i could be in\nthe exact same situation as them in two\nyears five years 10 years 15 years 20\nyears if i just continue on this path so\nwho do you surround yourself with\nbecause if you're around people\nthat are completely negative they talk\nabout being broke all the time they talk\n[ __ ] about you and every time you have a\nwin they knock it down or they poke\nholes in your win\nthe type of people who are like oh you\nwon the lottery oh my god you're gonna\nhave to pay so much in taxes like we all\nknow those types of people do you\nsurround yourself with those types of\npeople or the people who want to see you\nwin the people who are trying to help\nyou win\nright so who do you surround yourself\nwith because they're going to brainwash\nyou to either be successful or not be\nsuccessful okay what else do we have to\nthink about as far as success goes what\nare you feeding your body\ni talk about it all of the time\nwhatever you put in your body is going\nto dictate whether you have enough\nenergy throughout the day if you're\ngoing to have a successful life whatever\nsuccess means to you you're going to\nhave to have the energy to create that\nsuccessful life aren't you you're going\nto have to have the energy to create it\nif you're eating greasy crappy shitty\nfood that's bringing all of your energy\ndown you need a nap in the middle of the\nday you need to drink three coffees in\nthe middle of the day you're not gonna\nhave the energy to create the successful\nlife that you want to so what are you\nputting into your body\nthat's food\nand also what are you feeding yourself\nbesides just food as far as mentally\ncoming in every single day\nenergy\nis going to either help you create the\nlife that you want or lack of energy is\ngoing to hold you back from creating the\nlife that you want\nso if we're trying to brainwash\nourselves to be successful shouldn't we\nalso pay attention to whatever putting\ninto our body are you putting a bunch of\nsodas in your body every single day so\nyou get a big old spike in sugar and\nthen it drops or are you drinking a lot\nof water are you drinking enough water\none of the things that's real crazy is i\nfind that i drink probably about a\ngallon half to two gallons every single\nday i'm constantly peeing which is which\nis the funny part about always drinking\nso much freaking water but i'm 70 water\nso shouldn't i be putting in water to\nassist with that they found that people\nare dehydrated their brains don't work\nas well so if you're not drinking enough\nwater\nyou're not even gonna be thinking well\nenough so it's not even just about\ncrappy foods it's are you drinking\nenough water\ncan you just drink enough water to have\nmore energy that's a crazy thing how are\nyou taking care of your body let's go to\nthe next part how are you taking care of\nit every single day how are you working\nout\nare you stretching or doing yoga i mean\nyou have to realize i understand that\nthat the majority of the time when we're\nworking to create whatever it is we're\ntrying to create\nyou're sitting down you're sedentary\nyou're not doing a whole lot\nand they found that the next what they\ncall the next cancer is that people are\nalways sitting\nand that ruins your body so if nothing\nelse are you getting up and stretching\nevery single hour\nare you taking the necessary the\nprecautions to make sure that your body\nis going to be healthy and you know how\noften are you working out how are you\ntaking care of your body how much\nalcohol do you drink how much caffeine\ndo you drink how much water do you drink\nwhat type of food are you putting into\nyour body every single thing that you do\non a daily basis is affecting you in\neither a positive way or a negative way\nif you just think of it that way\neverything that you do\nis either affecting you positively or\nnegatively\nso that goes down to the the time that\nyou wake up\nif you hit the snooze button what you\ngot going on with your morning routine\nthe people that you surround yourself\nwith the stuff that you're reading the\nstuff that you're listening to the\npodcasts the youtubes the facebook the\nif you're watching reality tv\nyou know what you're putting into your\nbody the food that you have the water\nthat you have\nthe the working out that you do every\nsingle thing is either a positive or a\nnegative for your body so what you start\nasking yourself in the moment is right\nnow is this thing that i'm doing is it a\npositive or a negative right now\nthis burger that i'm eating in the\nmiddle of the day is this going to help\nme is this a positive or negative is\nthis going to take energy away from me\nis this going to add energy to me for me\nto be able to progress and become more\nsuccessful\nis this person that i'm hanging out with\nright now are they going to affect me\npositively are they going to going to\naffect me negatively if i sleep in today\nis it going to affect me positively or\nis it going to affect me negatively this\nmusic that i'm listening to is it going\nto affect me positively or is it going\nto be affecting me negatively\nevery single thing that you do every\nsingle thing that you see everything\nthat you hear everything that you taste\ntouch feel all of those things are\nbrainwashing you in some sort of way the\nproblem is that most people don't\nrealize this so they don't take control\nof their quote unquote brainwashing\nbrainwashing is not a negative\nconnotation it just means that\neverything that comes into your\nawareness is going to affect the actions\nthat you do or do not take so if we're\nbeing smart shouldn't we say okay if i\nwant to create the life that i want if i\nwant to do what i want to do if i want\nthe future that i want shouldn't i be in\ncontrol of my own brainwashing the\nanswer is yes you should but what it\ntakes is it takes intention it takes a\nplan and it takes awareness every single\nmoment to ask yourself is what i'm doing\nright now positively or negatively\naffecting me in the life that i'm trying\nto build and the success that i'm trying\nto have if you ask yourself that moment\nto moment you'll start to realize you'll\nstart to get away from the things that\nare not serving you and you'll start to\nbuild up more things that are serving\nyou to create the life that you want\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to
