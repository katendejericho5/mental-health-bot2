    "transcript": "stop lying to yourself you need to first\nadmit that you are a lazy person if you\ndon't do anything and you're too lazy\nyour life is not going to be what you\nwant it to be\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to stop being lazy so if you're\nsomeone that's out there and you tend to\nbe a little bit lazy if you're not\ngetting things done that you need to or\nif you tend to procrastinate too much\ni'm going to give you my strategies on\nhow to make sure that you stop being\nlazy so the first tip that i'm going to\ngive you before we dive into like the\nactual meat and potatoes of exactly how\nto do it is to stop lying to yourself\nyou need to first admit that you are a\nlazy person because all too often i see\npeople that are lazy they're not getting\nthe stuff done that they need to and\nthen ultimately what they do oh yeah\nwell you know i'm just i've got stuff\ngoing on and they make excuses for\neverything of so the reason why they're\nnot achieving the goals they want why\nthey don't have the life that they want\nwhen in reality the thing they need to\ndo is just admit\nthat what the real issue is is that\nthey're lazy and they're a\nprocrastinator and they don't have plans\nput in place so the first thing you need\nto do is to admit to yourself to fully\nbe transparent and say you know what i\ndo have a problem with laziness it's the\nsame way that if somebody is an\nalcoholic and they go through a 12-step\nprogram the very first thing to do is to\nadmit\nthat so that they can overcome it\nbecause once you admit it then you can\nstart to work through it and that's the\nimportant thing is to realize that that\nhumans are inherently lazy more than\nanything else if you were to just go\nback in in a hundred thousand years ago\ntwo hundred thousand years ago and see\nour ancestors i don't think that they\nwere just working all day long if i were\nto make a guess if they're in the middle\nof the desert it's really hot outside\nit's 101 degrees they're probably under\na tree in the shade hanging out because\nthey hunt in the morning and then they\nhunt in the evening and then during the\nday they're just sitting around and\nsitting in the shade most likely so i\nthink being lazy is inherently inside of\nhumans so for you to not be lazy is kind\nof going against\nwhat you actually would be doing as a\ntypical human if you weren't born in a\nwestern world like we are now with\nyou know instagram and facebook and all\nof these things so uh when you realize\nthat we are inherently lazy and you\nadmit okay i am a lazy person i have\nbeen lazy it is my fault it's no one\nelse's fault it's no one no one outside\nof me is fault nothing externally it's\n100 me and you stop blaming anybody else\nor anything else you take full 100\nresponsibility then you can start\nactually taking steps to overcome that\nlaziness that you have\nso that's the first tip make sure that\nyou admit it to yourself stop lying to\nyourself be 100 transparent the second\ntip that i'm going to give you is to\ntake your goals and make sure that all\nof your goals are bite-sized and i don't\nmean take your goals and make them\nsmaller what i mean is take your goals\nand take the time frame so if you have\nfor instance let's say you want to make\na hundred thousand dollars this year and\nthat's the goal for the year if you look\nat that you've never made a hundred\nthousand dollars there's a part of you\nthat that scares there's a part of you\nthat that's outside of your comfort zone\nand you're not really sure how you feel\nabout it like you want to make the\nhundred thousand dollars but there's a\nparty that's kind of for being honest\nyou're kind of scared less of making\nthat a hundred thousand because what do\nyou have to do how hard do you have to\nwork how much more time do you have to\nput into it so if you're looking at the\nnumber and you're saying okay this is a\nlong-term goal over the next year that's\n365 days right that's a decent amount of\ntime from right now so when you look at\nit that way and you say okay i need to\ntake these and make these more\nbite-sized what does that mean i need to\ntake that hundred thousand dollar goal\nand i need to figure out how to take\nthat hundred thousand dollar goal and\nmake it smaller make it so it's more\nbite-sized so let me give you an example\nlet's say that you're a sales rep and\nyour goals make a hundred thousand\ndollars this year okay well now that we\nhave the goal of a hundred thousand\ndollars we've got that figured out if\nyou break down your numbers which every\nsales rep should know their numbers how\nmany you know sales they get depending\non how many appointments that they have\nhow many phone calls they need to make\nin order to get an amount of a certain\namount of appointments and you look\nthrough and you say okay if i'm looking\nat my long-term goal of how much money i\nwant to make this year a hundred\nthousand dollars and i say okay over the\nnext year that means weekly i need to\nmake sure that i'm doing a hundred calls\nper week if i just do\na hundred calls per week\nstatistically i should make a hundred\nthousand dollars this year\nautomatically doesn't that already feel\nbetter because i'm not focusing on the\nentire year\nall i'm doing is i'm focusing on this\nweek so i know what needs to be done\nokay let's take it another step further\nif i look at that and i say okay if i\nwork for five days and it's a hundred\ncalls a day a hundred calls a week\nthat's 20 calls a day i mean i can focus\non 100 100 100 calls a week 20 calls a\nday and if i just do my 20 calls a day\nand i only focus on just that one goal\nstatistically i'll make a hundred\nthousand dollars\nisn't that a lot easier because then\nyou're taking something that's really\nfar away and really big and making it\nreally close and really small 20 calls a\nday i can do that if i'm working for the\nnext eight hours what is that like two\nand a half calls an hour i could do two\nand a half calls in an hour that's super\neasy so take whatever goals that you're\ngoing for and make them more bite sized\nand the thing about it is because of the\nfact they're bite size you're more\nlikely to hit little tiny goals\nthroughout the day which motivates you\nto then work harder right so if you're\nlazy the reason why this is important is\nbecause if i go oh i'm gonna make a\nhundred thousand dollars this year\nthat's really far away but if i go i\nonly need to make two and a half calls\nthis hour\nthen what happens i make two and a half\ncalls this hour you know three calls\nthis hour and i go holy crap i'm ahead\nand it actually makes me feel better\nbecause i have little teeny tiny\ncheckpoints that i'm hitting and each\ntime i hit a checkpoint what happens i\ngain confidence and when i gain\nconfidence and i feel like i'm moving\nand progressing towards the goal that i\nwant to go for and the life that i want\nto create it actually gives me more\ndrive and more motivation towards that\ngoal which is more\nmore than likely going to make me less\nlazy so take all of your goals all of\nyour big goals and just make them\nsmaller figure out a way to chunk them\ndown a little bit it's easiest way to do\nit if you sit down to eat a meal you\ndon't eat the entire meal you eat the\nmeal one bite at a time so stop worrying\nabout the entire meal and just worry\nabout each and every bite each and every\nday that you have\nso that's number two is to take your\ngoals and make them smaller because then\nyou're gonna hit more checkpoints which\nis going to then make you excited to\nkeep working harder towards your goal\nstep number three is to figure out what\nyour why is\nif you don't if you're if you're too\nlazy the reason why is because you just\nreally don't care enough about your\ngoals but if you can figure out exactly\nwhat you want and why you want it it\nmakes it much easier to go for it so let\nme give you a very drastic example but\nit's my favorite example because it\nshows everybody they can do whatever\nthey want so one of my favorite things\nto do when i'm giving a speech and i\nstart to talk about this is i'll go into\na group of people and i say hey\neverybody here\nwhat is the actual percentage chance\nthat you're going to make a million\ndollars in the next 12 months legally\nwhat's the chance that you make a\nmillion dollars in the next 12 months\nlegally who's gonna who has over a five\npercent chance and i raise my hand and\nnobody ever raises their hand\nwho has a one percent chance of making a\nmillion dollars legally in the next 12\nmonths and like a couple people raise\ntheir hand and then i say who thinks\nthat there's a zero percent chance of\nyou making a million dollars over the\nnext 12 months\nlegally\nand everybody raises their hand they\nthink there's a almost everybody thinks\nthere's a zero percent chance and i okay\ni'm going to take that exact same goal\nand i'm going to shift it around a\nlittle bit and see if we can shift the\nway that you believe in yourself\nokay so i'm going to say what's the\npercentage chance of you making a\nmillion dollars this year\nlegally and if you don't\neverybody that you love is killed\nand i raise my hand and say who's who\nthink what's the percentage chance 100\n100 100\npercent ten thousand percent everybody\ngoes from zero\npercent chance to a hundred percent\nchance\nnow why is that the goal didn't change\nthe time frame didn't change what\nchanged is they actually give a damn\nabout the goal that's what changed\nright there's a why behind the goal if\neverybody that you love gets killed\nthere's no such thing as laziness right\nyou'll wake up early you won't make\nexcuses you'll get everything that you\nneed to get done and you won't you\nprobably wouldn't even look at instagram\nor facebook throughout the entire year\nthere would be no way that you're lazy\nover the next year if everyone that you\nloves life depends on it for you to make\na million dollars legally you would\nfigure out a way\nso what does that show you\nyou're not just lazy you're lazy because\nyou don't love what you're doing you're\nlazy because you're not fully tied into\nexactly what it is that you're trying to\ncreate it's not that it's not possible\nit's 100 possible it's 100 possible for\neverybody listening to me right now\nsomehow to figure out a way to make a\nmillion dollars in the next year but the\nproblem is it's not that you don't have\nenough time is that you just don't care\nenough and that's the main issue\nso how do you make yourself care more\nyou've got to have a really really\nreally strong why so if you figure out\nwhat your goals are and you figure out\nwhat your why is\nlaziness doesn't exist anymore you'll\nget up in work when your why is strong\nenough to figure out why it is that\nyou're working towards what you're\nworking\nso that's the third thing is to find\nyour why behind all of your goals\nthat'll get you past your laziness\nnumber four is to remove the\ndistractions\nhere's the thing that i know when you're\nbeing lazy i guarantee you're not just\nsitting on your couch and just staring\nup at your ceiling the entire time\nright what are you doing you're keeping\nyourself busy in some sort of way\nif i were to guess 99 of people listen\nthis when you're being lazy you're\nprobably either watching something on tv\nor you're on your phone\ni don't think there's anything else that\npeople are really doing besides that\nyou're not just staring up in the clouds\nand watching the clouds pass by and\nthat's your quote-unquote laziness\nwhat's happening is you're figuring out\nanother way to distract yourself so that\nyou don't do the thing that actually\nneeds to be done so if you can remove\nthat distraction then you're more likely\nto just go ahead and go all right well\n[ __ ] i got nothing else to do i might as\nwell go ahead and do it so what's a big\nway to do this take your phone and put\nit in the other room\nif you've got something important to do\nif you have something that needs to get\ndone take your phone and put in the\nother room\nturn off all of your notifications on\nyour phone\nfor some of you guys that scares you\nturn off all of your notifications take\nyour freaking apple watch off that's the\nbiggest i have an apple watch and the\nonly time i've ever worried is i work is\nwhen i work out because i just don't\neven want to have all of those\ndistractions so turn your apple watch\ndistractions off turn your phone\ndistractions off the only way like for\nme i'll be completely honest with you\nthe only way that you can get a hold of\nme on my phone is if you call me if you\nsend me a text message my phone doesn't\nlight up nothing lights up the only time\nit lights up is when i get a phone call\nnot when i get an email now when i get a\nfacebook message not when i get an\ninstagram message not when i get\nsomebody that likes one of my photos\nnothing\nno way would i ever have notifications\nget in the way of what i'm truly trying\nto do so turn off all of your\nnotifications on your phone\nnext turn off all of your notifications\non your computer\nyour computer should have all of your\nnotifications off as well\ni don't want to know every time someone\nsends me an email i check my email once\nevery two to three days i don't want to\nknow there's no way because that's going\nto pull me from everything that i'm\ntrying to do you know what i mean so i\ndon't want to focus on that there's no\nway that i want to focus on those things\nso i'm going to remove as many\ndistractions as i possibly can how do i\nmove as many distractions i possibly can\nturn off my freaking notifications put\nmy phone in the other room let everyone\nknow that you're about to go do\nsomething so like for instance when i'm\nplanning my episodes i planned this\nepisode earlier today i tell my\ngirlfriend hey i'm gonna go plan some\nepisodes i plan three episodes in a row\nwhat do i do i take my phone i put in\nthe other room i get onto my computer\nthat has no distractions on it i put my\nheadphones in i tell my girlfriend hey\ni'm going to go and start start planning\nsome episodes she knows to leave me\nalone for the next two hours because\nthat's what's going to get me focused\nbecause if i break my focus it makes it\neasier for me to go back to doing\nnothing so i'm trying to get myself into\nthe zone\nso i can literally go okay i'm in the\nzone now i'm going to stop being lazy\nnow i'm going to do exactly what needs\nto be done\nso just stop freaking turn turn your\nnetflix off delete your netflix account\ndelete your facebook account delete your\ninstagram delete all of those things and\nsee if you're still lazy because you're\nnot going to have [ __ ] to do it's the\ntruth right like if you get rid of\ninstagram facebook whatever else there\nis twitter and you know snapchat some\npeople i think still use snapchat and\nyou know tick tock and now there's this\nnew thing called clubhouse you delete\nall of those\nand you delete your netflix and your\nhulu and all of those things\nif you're being lazy the only thing\nyou're doing is you're sitting outside\nwatching the grass grow so if you're\nbeing lazy you're probably distracting\nyourself in another way so what are\nthose distractions write them down with\na pen and paper and get rid of those\nfreaking distractions\nso that's number five or number four and\nthen number five\nthe last one is my favorite thing is\njust the pomodoro technique the pomodoro\ntechnique says i'm gonna work for 25\nminutes and i'm gonna take five minutes\noff\nyou can do anything for 25 minutes right\nanything you could figure out a way to\njust work for 25 minutes so you say all\nright screw it i'm being lazy i can\nnotice that i'm being lazy i'm admitting\nto myself that i'm being lazy i need to\nget this thing done all right so what am\ni going to do i'm going to get my\ncomputer and what am i going to do next\nto my computer i'm going to have a pen\nand paper and i'm going to write down\nwhatever it is that pops up into my head\nbecause i've got one task only one task\ni can do for the next 25 minutes i'm\ngoing to put my headphones in i'm gonna\nlisten to\nyou know i always listen to music on\nyoutube i look up a focused binary beat\nsong it's like three hours long and i\njust put it on so therefore there's no\nmusic there's music there's no\nsounds that could come into my ears\nexcept for just this music i'm in\ncontrol of the sounds that are coming in\nand then there's no words inside of the\nsong as well if there's no words inside\nthe song there's nothing to distract me\nand i can start thinking about the\nlyrics like i do so i don't have that to\ndistract me and i go okay the only thing\nthat i can do for the next 25 minutes is\nthis one task and if you give your brain\nno other options\nyou'll realize that your brain can get\nhyper focused and if you are sitting\nthere and a great idea comes into your\nhead instead of going and putting that\nsomewhere all you have to do is take\nyour pen and paper and write that on the\njournal that's next to you and you focus\non just one thing for 25 minutes you'll\nbe surprised how much you can get done\nbeing hyper focused with no distractions\nwith no notifications coming in with no\nexternal sounds how much you can get\ndone in literally just 25 minutes\nthat's kind of crazy you're way more\nefficient than you actually realize when\nthose 25 minutes is you're doing those\n25 minutes you take a five minute break\nthat's it super simple take a five\nminute break and you could go on\ninstagram you can go to the bathroom you\ncan go stare at clouds passing in the\nsky do whatever you want for those five\nminutes\nyou're completely done working for those\nfive minutes and then what do you do you\ngo back in and you do another 25 minutes\nand you only have one task to work for\nit's really not that hard being lazy is\na really easy thing to pull yourself out\nof you just have to be aware you have to\nadmit it and you have to make a plan and\nyou have to have a really strong why and\nif you do that it will pull you out of\nyour laziness so that you can start to\nget [ __ ] done because i'm telling you\nthis if you don't do anything and you're\ntoo lazy your life is not going to be\nwhat you want it to be so in order to\nbuild the life that you want follow\nthese steps pull your ass out of\nlaziness and get to work\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well good\nmorning everybody today is going to be a\nbeautiful day i'm just so excited i\ndon't want to [ __ ] do it today i just\ni'm just not 100 into it"
