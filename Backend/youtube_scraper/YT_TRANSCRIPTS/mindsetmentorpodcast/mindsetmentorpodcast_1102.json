    "transcript": "if you go back and look at some of the\nmost successful people in the world one\nof the things that you'll find among 95\nof them is that they\n[Music]\ntoday we're gonna be talking about the\nnine habits of the most successful\npeople in the world and i have done\nalmost 900 podcast episodes when i look\nback at all my statistics this was my\nnumber one\nmost downloaded one five years ago is\nwhen i first put it out so i decided\nlet's do an updated version of it and\nsee how it still holds if it holds true\nand if there's any changes over the past\nfive years so let's go ahead and dive in\nif you want to be successful\nyou should probably whatever the success\nmeans you should probably follow other\nsuccessful people and do what they do so\nif you just write these down and just\ndecide to do these nine things\nsee where you are in five years there's\na pretty good chance you're going to be\nwhere you want to be so let's dive in\nhave it number one which you've probably\nthought of you might do maybe you try to\ndo sometimes but habit number one is to\nwake up earlier if you go back and look\nat some of the most successful people in\nthe world one of the things that you'll\nfind among\n95 percent of them is that they wake up\nearly and so what i did was i decided to\ngo through and research\nwhat are some of the most successful\npeople in the world and if you look at\nsome of the most successful in the world\nwhat time do they wake up so i found a\nfew of them for you number one jack\ndorsey the guy who started twitter he\nstarted square he wakes up at 5am in the\nmorning and the first thing he does is\nhe meditates and then goes for a six\nmile run if you look at richard branson\nrichard branson has about a 4.8 billion\ndollar net worth he wakes up every\nsingle morning at 5 45 on his private\nuh island that he has because the shades\ngo up with the sun\nnext person tim cook tim cook who is the\nuh ceo of apple tim cook has a net worth\nof about a billion dollars and tim cook\nwakes up at 5 40 or wakes up at at 4 30\nso that he can be at the gym by 5 30\nevery single morning if you look at\nhoward schultz howard schultz is the\nthe guy who started starbucks he wakes\nup every single morning at 5 00 at 4 30\na.m so he can walk his dogs and they can\ngo and do a workout steve jobs who was\nworth you know 11 billion dollars when\nhe died woke up every single morning at\nthe latest at 6 a.m to go work out\nso if you just look okay\ni just gave you what four five six\nexamples of billionaires who wake up\nearly and usually seems like most of\nthem go to work out as soon as they wake\nup\nif you just decide hey what do these\npeople do\nmaybe i should do it wouldn't it just\nmake sense to go huh\nmaybe i should just wake up early and\nnow some of you are out there going oh\nyeah but i'm not a morning person i\ndon't i'm not a morning person either\nbut there's also somebody out there like\noh\nbut i'm a i'm a night owl right there's\na lot of studies have been done that\nfound that there's no really night owls\nthat are out there like if you think\nabout our ancestors 200 000 years ago\nthere wasn't there wasn't some random\none of the random guys sitting by the\nfire he's like no sorry guys i wish you\ncould fall asleep but i'm a night owl\nlike that's [ __ ] so what you're\ndoing is you're realizing that you're\nnot a night owl you've just\nhabitualized yourself to go to bed in a\nlater hours which you've really done and\nso what you need to do is you need to\nget in in some of those circadian cycles\nand start to research that how to sleep\nbetter because i used to think i was an\nidol until i researched how to become\nbetter at sleep and i realized i'm not a\nnight owl at all but i'm also not a\nmorning person but you know if you want\nto be successful why don't you just do\nwhat successful people do\npretty easy number one wake up earlier\nnumber two\nwrite down your goals successful people\nwrite down their goals there was a study\ndone in the 70s\nat harvard and they actually went\nthrough and everyone who is graduating\nwith their mba they went through and\nthey did a survey on all of them and\nthen 10 years later they followed up on\nthe survey and one of the interesting\nthings that they found\nin 1970 all of their mba graduates\nonly three percent of them wrote down\ntheir goals\nwhich means 97 of them did not write\ndown their goals when they followed up\nwith everybody 10 years later those\nthree percent of people who wrote down\ntheir goals were 10 times more\nsuccessful financially\nthan the other 97 percent combined you\nsay that again they weren't just 10\ntimes successful\nthree percent of people were 10 times\nmore successful than the 97 percent\ncombined so what does that show you\nthere's some sort of secret to writing\nyour goals down there's something\ndifferent about putting your goals and\nputting them physical into the world and\nactually going you know what now that\nthey're on this piece of paper maybe i\nshould start to make a plan maybe i\nstart to figure out how to do this and\nso if nothing else instead of just\nthinking about your goals put your goals\ndown on a piece of paper get very clear\non exactly what it is that you want so\nthat's number two number three is they\nhave work ethic now work ethic just so\nyou guys know work ethic is not\nsomething that somebody is born with i\ncan speak from from me personally i was\nan extremely extremely lazy person up\nuntil the age of 19.\nthen at 19 i found a place where i\nwanted to start putting my effort into\nstarted working for a sales company and\ni went oh my god i can actually start to\nmake money i can get i cannot be poor\nanymore\nthat would be amazing and what happened\ni started working a little bit harder\nand as i started working a little bit\nharder i started getting some results\nand i was like this is awesome let me\nwork a little bit harder and see if i\ncan get more results and i did i started\ngetting more results i was like this is\nawesome as well\nlittle by little i didn't even realize\nit was happening until about three years\nlater i went from super lazy like\npartying drinking a lot of alcohol\nsmoking a lot of weed to\nnot doing any of that stuff and working\n110 hours a week\nit wasn't like i was just born working\n110 hours a week but i was just like i\ndeveloped this work ethic and this\nhardcore work ethic that just stuck and\ni still have it and so work ethic isn't\nsomething that you're just born with\nwork ethic work ethic is something that\nyou build upon every single day and so\nif you want to you know start being more\nsuccessful whatever the success means to\nyou start working a little bit harder\nstart working a little bit harder what\nhappens is your hard work becomes\nhabitualized and then you just work a\nlittle bit harder and you're just\nstacking like if you were just just to\nimagine work ethic being little tiny\nblocks you're just stacking work ethic\nblocks on top of each other once you\nrealize that you start working harder\nyou go from lazy as hell to a really\nhard worker so\nthat's the third thing they have really\nincredible work ethic number four is\nthat they exercise almost every single\nday you have to think about your body\nyour body is\nthe most incredible piece of machinery\nprobably in the entire universe the\nstuff that it does the way that it heals\nitself if you can think of all of the\nthe crap that you put in your your face\nover your lifetime if i think of all the\ncrap i've put in my face over my\nlifetime\nand the fact that my body still runs let\nalone that it still runs really well is\nquite amazing to me but if you think to\nyourself okay\nif i think about the way that i treat my\nbody and if i exercise more often and\npay attention to all of those things and\nin the way that it works\nyour body isn't just you're not just\njust born with tons of energy some\npeople yes they have more energy but\nwhat happens is your body starts the\nsame way with that work ethic it starts\nto get more energy as you start to use\nmore energy your body adapts and so if\nyou're like you go to the gym for the\nvery first time and you're like i can't\ndo this anymore\nbecause i'm so tired the next day i'm so\ntired that day what happens is your body\nstarts to adjust your body is an\nincredible piece of machinery and what\nhappens is it goes oh it looks like rob\nis going to start needing more energy\nevery single day let's give them more\nenergy and so when you exercise you get\nmore energy when you have more energy\nit's easier to work harder it's easier\nto develop work ethic so exercise every\nsingle day humans are not built\nto just sit down in front of a computer\nall day long we're not built to just be\nstagnant like when i think about how\nstagnant people are when i heard the\nword stagnant i use it on purpose\nbecause when i think of stagnant i think\nof like a\na dirty pond like a stagnant dirty pond\nwith like flies and mold on top of it\nlike that's not the way i want to think\nof my body and so when you think of\nbeing stagnant and just being sedentary\nall day long that's not what your body\nis made to do your body is made to move\nand the more that you move the more\nenergy your body will start to make day\nafter day and so it's super important to\nthink of your body as the temple that it\nis and go the better that i take care of\nit the more that i exercise the better\nthat i you know decide to actually take\ncare of it it's gonna have a lot more\nenergy if i decide to make sure that it\ncreates energy every day throughout the\nday so\nexercise every day get your ass up get\nmoving go for a walk if you don't work\nout at all go for a walk for a little\nwhile walk a couple miles walk for 20\nminutes whatever it is you got to do\nexercise and get your body moving okay\nsuccessful habit number five is that\nthey read really often this is a really\ninteresting fact that i found\nthe average american reads about one to\ntwo books per year i know some people\nlistening to this myself included years\nago you might not have read any books\nlast year right the average ceo\nwhich means that they're you know in the\ntop of their company\nreads 60 books per year\njust take that in for a second the\naverage ceo which means obviously are\nceos busy yeah absolutely they're busy\nprobably the most busy people in their\ncompany a lot of times but they find\ntime to read they find time to\nconstantly be growing they also never\nthink that their know-it-alls clearly if\nthey're still reading and they're\nreading business books and self-help\nbooks and mindset books and psychology\nbooks and books that are they're not\nthey're not just reading like you know\nromance novels or anything like that\nthey're reading books that are improving\nthem and helping them get better so\nwhat's cool about that is that they read\na little bit more on average than a book\nper week\nthink about that for a second a book per\nweek\nsome people don't read a book a year\nso if you want to be more successful i\ndon't know if i just go straight to\nreading 60 books per year because you\ngot other stuff to be to be to do to be\nsuccessful as well but can you start\nreading more can you do a book per month\nhave you ever cranked out 12 books in a\nyear what would you what do you think\nthat you would start thinking how do you\nthink your mind would be if you started\nreading a book every single month\nokay that's tip number five successful\nhabit number six is that they plan their\nweek every single sunday\nthis is one of the things that i see\nthat\nthat very successful people do\nthat the average person doesn't is that\nit seems like the average person tends\nto go into their day and they go into\ntheir week in reaction mode they just\nhope that it goes the way that they want\nto\nthey go kind of like well i hope this\nworks i hope i don't have too many fires\ni have to put out this week\nand it seems like the most successful\npeople in the world go into it with a\nplan\nready to execute like they go in all\nguns blazing from the moment the day\nhappens on monday right so when you look\nback what does it look like when you\nhave you know a\nsunday meeting with yourself it's super\nsimple you may have heard me say about\nit before in\nway past episodes\nvery simple you look back and you look\nforward you look back on last week\nsee what happened last week what went\nwell what didn't go well and you look\nahead to this week and you go through\nsomething called stop start continue\nstop start continue i got from p diddy\nuh a long time ago like 10 12 years ago\nhe had a show\nand they did stop start and continue\nwith his team members and stop starting\ncontinuing means what do i need to stop\ndoing so if i'm looking back on last\nweek i'm in my look back of the look\nforward\ni'm looking back what do i need to stop\ndoing that i did last week i need to\nspend some less time on instagram okay\nwhat do i need to start doing\nokay i need to start waking up earlier\nso that i have more time to get my\nworkout in okay and what do i need to\ncontinue doing now i'm doing a pretty\ngood job at eating healthy okay perfect\nso you go through and you figure out\nwhat you need to stop doing start doing\nand continue doing and you'll look back\nand now what you do is you go into your\nlook forward and you look ahead to the\nnext seven days take 20 30 minutes out\nof your sunday just to do this every\nsingle sunday and you start to make a\nplan of exactly what it is that you need\nto do to execute to go into your week\nlook back look forward stop start\ncontinuing you go into this week all\nguns blazing and executing other things\nyou need to execute so successful people\nsit down and they take it serious enough\nto plan every single day of their week\nand they start that on sunday successful\nhabit number seven is that they are\nsuper\npositive in their self-talk and they\npractice gratitude\none of the things that you know is what\nyou focus on magnifies so if you're\nsitting around focusing on all the\nthings that aren't going well if you're\nfocusing on all the things that are\npissing you off if you're focusing on\nall the things that that are negative in\nyour life then you're going to find more\nof those things that piss you off that\nmake you negative that aren't going well\nbut if you sit down you say what can i\nbe grateful for right now what you focus\non magnify so if i find something to be\ngrateful for\neven if it's if i have nothing else to\nbe grateful for right now\ni have my heartbeat right my my my lungs\nare still working my heart's still\nworking i'm still here i have something\nto be grateful for right if i could\nstart my day\nand try to live that throughout the rest\nof the day to practice gratitude and\npositive self-talk it's going to carry\non through the rest of my day and if i'm\ngrateful\nfrom the morning what i focus on\nmagnifies i will find more things to be\ngrateful for\nand create more things to be grateful\nfor\nin my life which is going to create more\npositive self-talk more positive\nthoughts more optimistic thoughts less\nnegativity\nless pessimistic thoughts less holding\nmyself back\nmakes sense so\npractice some more gratitude practice\nmore positive self-talk that is number\nseven\nnumber eight\nis that they have mentors this is\nsomething i see a lot of people don't do\nthe average mentor i saw a statistic\nthat came out so the average mentor but\nby before they become a mentor has had\nseven different mentors so the average\nmillionaire has had seven different\nmentors by the time that they are a\nmillionaire\nso if you're sitting there you have to\nthink to yourself how many mentors do\nyou have how many mentors have you had\nand so can you go out and find mentors\ndo you have people around you that have\nyou know a certain aspect of their life\nthat they look out you look up to maybe\nit's you know somebody has a really good\nmarriage can you have a marriage and\nrelationship mentor you know they don't\nhave to coach you specifically but just\nbeing around them and having\nconversation with them and meeting up\nwith them once a month going to get some\ncoffee having conversations when you're\naround people who have the lives that\nyou want and you you\nintentionally put yourself around them\nyou start to hold yourself to a higher\nstandard when you hold yourself to a\nhigher standard your life starts to\nchange\nso they have mentors how many mentors do\nyou have how can you find more mentors\nand a relationship mentor business\nmentor a money mentor right like i was i\nwas over at a friend's house the other\nday and one of my\nfriends which i would consider a mentor\nwas there as well and he's a big real\nestate guy he's worth about 150 million\ndollars and i was sitting next to him\nand i was like hey i've got some\nquestions for you about what i should do\nwith this crazy market that's going on\nand he's like hey well you know why\ndon't you just call me this week and we\ncan go get some coffee right it's cool\nto have people like that but they're all\nhe's only in my life because i\nintentionally sought out him like i knew\nhe lived in austin i i\nwas able to get connected to him and\nhe's become a friend of mine we go get\ncoffee every once in a while we don't\ntalk every single day but if i text him\ni know he's going to text me back\nright do you have people like that in\nyour life mentors in all aspects of your\nlife maybe you have a\nmentor who's really fit maybe if a\nmentor is a really great father or\nmother\ncan you have mentors a business mentor\nin every area of your life where you\nwant to improve the average millionaire\nhas had seven mentors before becoming a\nmillionaire and i guarantee you they\nhave more and more and more as their\nlife continues to go on so they have\nmentors and the last habit that i found\nis that they have proper nutrition and\nsleep\nthis is something that i don't think\npeople talk about too much when you\nthink about successful people right when\nwe're talking about a few minutes ago\nabout your body about what your body\ndoes how it works and everything when\nyou give your body fuel\nand not something that's going to slow\nit down you have energy to continue to\ndo what you need to do throughout the\nday so like even for me there's a lot of\nthings that i don't eat throughout the\nday\njust because of the fact that i know\nit's going to steal energy from me right\nso there's certain foods and can you\nstart being more aware of this that take\nenergy from you the most\nenergy-intensive thing that your body\ndoes is digestion and so there are\ncertain foods that you're eating that\nyou aren't paying attention to that are\nstealing energy from you and making you\ntired then if you're tired you don't\nhave the energy to do what you need to\ndo to go out and execute on the life\nthat you want so why don't you start\npaying attention to stuff that gives you\nenergy and steals energy from you what's\nheavy there's greasy food there's cheese\nthere's red meats usually those things\ntend to steal energy from you that's not\nsomething you want to have during the\nday maybe at night for dinner if you\nabsolutely have to have it or\njust get rid of it completely so that\nyou have more energy and everything that\nyou do\nand then the last part of that is asleep\none of the things that i found that's\nsuper interesting about some of the most\nsuccessful people as i was researching\nthem is it's not like they sleep like\nthree to four hours a night there's a\nfew weird ones out there that only sleep\nthree to four hours a night because\ntheir bodies don't necessarily need it\nbut the average one sleeps eight nine\nhours a night that's why i interviewed\nmatthew mcconaughey and he said he did\nnine and a half hours a night he doesn't\nsleep less than nine and a half hours\nper night right i guess pretty damn\nsuccessful if you think of it so when\nyou look at it what is the amount of\nsleep that your body needs do you know\nhave you tested it have you figured it\nout i know for me i need around seven\nand a half hours of sleep i can sleep\nfor 14 hours i'm really damn good at\nsleeping but i only need a quote unquote\nonly need seven and a half hours of\nsleep and if i can get seven and a half\nhours of sleep every single night i'm\ngood some people only need six what do\nyou need it's about you figuring it out\nit's about you knowing it and it's about\nyou working towards getting that\nwhatever it is and in prioritizing your\nsleep versus being something that you do\nprioritizing your sleep prioritizing\nyour nutrition as well so that those are\nthe nine habits of the most successful\npeople in the world with all the\nresearch that i found so look at those\nwrite them all down and say how can i\ntake these and put these into my life\nknowing that the most successful people\nin the world do this and if i do this\nhey\nmaybe i could be one of the most\nsuccessful people in the world as well\nor at least much more successful than i\ncurrently am\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well good\nmorning everybody today is going to be a\nbeautiful day i'm just so excited i\ndon't want to [ __ ] do it today i just\ni'm just not 100 into it"
