    "transcript": "but what if i told you that\nin 10 years 10 years from today\nyou will have a life that you absolutely\nlove like the perfect life\nwould that excite you\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to build a life that you love a life\nthat you don't want to escape from and a\nlife that you are excited about now\nas you think about it it seems obvious\nthat every single person should want to\nbuild a life that they love right\nso many so many people should every\nsingle person not even so many every\nsingle person should be building a life\nthat they absolutely love they don't\nwant to try to escape from but if that's\nthe case why do so many people not love\ntheir lives\nbecause if i look around and the people\nthat i've coached the people i talk to\nit seems like most people are slightly\ncontent with their life\nand sometimes maybe even a little bit\nagitated with their lives and then some\npeople\nkind of hate their lives\nbut very rarely do i meet someone who's\nlike absolutely in love with every\naspect of their life and so i want to\nask you before we dive in do you love\nyour life like do you love every single\naspect of your life\nor are there certain pieces of your life\nor many pieces of your life you're like\nyeah i don't\ni don't really like that i don't really\nlike that that job that i have that\nperson to my life i don't like any of\nthat because for me personally i think\nthat i should be and i think that you\nshould be\nbuilding a life that i'm in love with in\nevery single aspect i think you should\nbe building a life that you're in love\nwith in every single aspect and there\nshouldn't be\nany pieces of your life to be honest\nwith you that you don't love and i don't\nknow about you but i want to be working\ntowards building a life that i love\nevery single day now are there pieces\nthat i still want to change around a\nlittle bit absolutely but over the past\n14 years i feel like i've been pulling\nout the weeds the things that i don't\nwant in my life and replanting flowers\nin places of all of those weeds so if\nyour life was a garden\nyou know and you're looking at it would\nyou see more flowers in your life or\nwould you see more weeds in your life\nand if you see more weeds what are you\ngonna do to go through and actually\nstart to pull them because there's\nnobody else that can pull those weeds\nwhether that's the job that you have the\nfamily the people that you surround\nyourself with the person you're in a\nrelationship with all of those things\ncan either be flowers or weeds and you\nneed to go through and take an actual\nassessment and figure out exactly what\nit is that you want in your life and how\nyou need to get each of those things as\nwell and um i'm going to say something i\nthink that that that might kind of\nsurprise a lot of people\nbuild like have waking up one day and\nhaving a life that you want in love is\nnot going to happen\na life that you actually love\nis built it's something that you have to\nput a lot of intention into it's built\nintentionally and it's built\nmeticulously like going through every\nsingle aspect of every single day and\ngoing do i want to keep this here or do\ni want to get rid of it a perfect life\nis built it's not like you just wake up\none day and go holy this is perfect i'm\nso glad that i somehow just absolutely\nlanded somehow on this perfect life no\nyou have to plan it you have to plan it\nyou have to check it you have to check\nit every single week check it every\nsingle day and you have to execute on\neverything that you want in your life\neverything in your life though is\nchangeable that's what's beautiful\nbecause one of the things that really\nholds people back from building the life\nthey love\nis that they feel like they're stuck in\nthe life that they have and if you feel\nlike you're stuck in your current life\nthen mentally it's going to seem really\nhard for you to build a life that you\nlove it's going to seem like it's near\nimpossible it's going to seem like well\ni guess i'm just not going to get it\nthis life i guess i'm not going to get\nit this this round and you've heard me\ntalk about a friend of mine who was the\nnumber 30 employee in facebook and he\nwas fired from facebook a year before\nthey went public and he missed out on\nabout 180 million dollars because of the\nfact that he was fired and he started to\ngo into a depression\nand when he noticed he was going into\noppression he was there for a while he\nstarted sitting around and going man i\ndon't i don't like being depressed\nanymore i'm gonna i'm gonna figure out a\nway to be happy and so what he did was\nhe made a happiness list\nevery single thing that makes him happy\nit could have been music it could have\nbeen you know walking his dog it could\nbe certain food it could be certain\npeople it could be conversations it\ncould be a movie he made a massive list\nof every single thing that makes him\nhappy and what he did was every single\nmorning he would look at that list and\nthen he would look at the things that he\nhad to do today and he would say how can\ni bring as many of these things from\nthis list into my day\nand the quote that i love that he told\nme was that i will not leave my\ndepression or my happiness left up to\nchance\ni'm gonna be in control of it\nnow when you hear that and you start\nthinking of your own life are you\nleaving your own life up to chance\nor are you actually being extremely\nintentional about every single thing\nthat you need\nwhat would it look like if you were to\nsit down and make a massive list of\nevery single thing that you love every\nsingle thing that makes you happy every\nsingle thing that makes you feel better\nwhether that is music whether that is\nyou know playing with a puppy whether it\nis just a certain food\ncertain restaurant certain friends\ncertain cocktail that you like whatever\nit is a movie that you want to watch\nlistening to certain music going out and\nyou know seeing a band play what is it\nthat that just makes you feel more alive\nwhat is it that would\nseem like a piece of a life that you\nlove if you were to build a life that\nyou love what is a essential piece that\nyou would want to make sure that you\nhave and you go through every single\naspect of your life and you actually\nstart to plan it so let's do it together\nif you have a pen and paper this would\nbe a really good time to pull it out\nlet's go through as many aspects of your\nlife as we possibly can right so let's\nlet's bring the first thing in let's\njust let's just go hard from the very\nbeginning your significant other\nright is this someone that you actually\ndo love\nor is this someone that you feel like\nmaybe you're just you know making sure\nthat you're not lonely anymore you know\nbe honest with yourself it's okay you're\nthe only one that's here that's talking\nto me and listening to this right so be\nhonest with yourself\nyou know are there uh maybe you do love\nthem but maybe there's certain aspects\nof them in certain aspects of your\nrelationship that you want to change\nokay so what do we want to do we take a\na list and we make a list of everything\nthat we love and then we make a list of\nneeds to change right maybe that the\nmaybe the person needs to change it\nneeds to be a completely different\nperson or maybe you and that person need\nto change a little bit in the way you\nshow up to the relationship maybe say\nokay\nyeah i do love this person but\nto be honest with you our communication\nsucks\nand what happens well i'll do something\nshe'll do something and we don't say\nanything because our communication sucks\nand it builds up and it builds up and it\nbuilds up and then what happens it just\nexplodes and it explodes because none of\nus are willing to actually have a\nconversation in the time that we're\nsupposed to have a conversation so\nokay what do i love about this person\nwhat are the stern apps i love their\nadventure i love how they're you know so\ngoofy i love these things okay i want to\ndeepen these things that i love and if i\nhave a needs to change lists i need to\nbring this up with them and actually\nstart to figure out what we need to do\ntogether to change it perfect now we've\nat least got a little bit of a plan\ndon't we\nnow we can start to build a relationship\nthat we love great let's go into our\nfriendships let's look at all of our\nfriends who do you love who are the\npeople that are there for you what do\nyou love about them what are the ways\nthat you want to show up to that\nrelationship with them even deeper let's\ngo deeper into it okay now let's go into\nthe needs to change list\nwell you know there is this one friend\nthat's always negative\ni can try to change them but i probably\ncan't so maybe what happens is i spend\nless time with them okay so you go\nthrough each person and you think about\nthe relationship that you have with them\nand you start thinking to yourself is\nthis somebody that's going to\nbe playing an integral part of my life\n10 years from now and where i want to be\n10 years from now or is this someone\nwho's actually kind of pulling me back\ninto being my old self that i'm trying\nto grow away from you know is there\ncertain aspects of this person or this\nrelationship with them that i want to\nchange or maybe just change it\ncompletely and spend less time with them\nand start spending time with maybe a new\nacquaintance that will pull me into the\nperson that i want to be right something\nto think about\nall right let's keep going what about\nyour family you know your your\nrelationship with your parents\nrelationship obviously you can't change\nyour parents you can't change your\nbrother and sister you can't change any\nof those people what do you love about\nthem how can you deepen the certain\naspects that you love about them so you\nspend more time in that aspect that you\nlove with them\nand then on the other side what are the\nthings that you don't love that you do\nwant to change oh yeah well i feel like\nyou know this person i feel like my\ndad's really surface level and he\ndoesn't really go deep with me and he's\nnot really an emotional guy and\ndoesn't really open himself up there's a\nway to crack them open and maybe start\nto have some real\nactual legitimate conversation so i can\nfeel like i know this person right you\ncan go through every single relationship\nand start to ask yourself\nwhat is it that i love about it what is\nit that needs to change okay all right\nlet's go to the next aspect what about\nyour job or your career okay what is it\nabout your job or your career do you\nlove your job or is it just something\nthat you're doing to make money right i\nunderstand that you can't just quit\ntoday a job that you hate\nbut\nit's kind of ridiculous to just think\nthat you're going to be there forever\nisn't it\nlike why if why would you just just\nautomatically go yeah well i hate my job\nbut it's the way that i pay the bills\nright okay i understand that but can you\nmake a transition plan and say okay i\ncan't leave today\nbut i could come up with a way to to be\ngone and to be doing something different\nin 365 days okay that makes me feel good\nokay so let's let's come up with a need\nto need to change what is it that i\nwould like my job to look like what is\nit that i would like my uh\ncareer to look like maybe i do like\nwhere i am but maybe i don't like the\nposition that i'm in i want to actually\nget a promotion okay what do i need to\ndo to change that what do i need to do\nto get a promotion next 365 days and you\nstart coming up with an actual plan to\nget you to where you want to go in your\ncareer and your job as well\nperfect\nlet's keep going let's say that you have\na business okay what do you love about\nyour business\nyou know what do you hate about your\nbusiness what are the things that you\nwant to change about your business think\nabout that what about the people that\nyou work with your employees you know\nare these employees that you just hired\nbecause you needed to put somebody in\nplace or these people who you actually\nreally want to see them grow and you\nwant to spend more time with them you\nknow you start to think about that and\ngo yeah maybe i do have these people on\nmy team that i'm not really 100 percent\nuh\nin love with they're not really the best\nperson but i hired him a couple years\nago and when you look at it you're like\nactually this person could be producing\nway more if i had a better person in\nthat position\n[Music]\nmaybe i should let this person go maybe\ni should you know maybe i'm holding them\nback by keeping you know holding them\nback from the life they could have by\nkeeping them in this position maybe i\nneed to let them go right so think about\nthat what about the house that you have\nare you in love with your house\nmaybe you are okay are there certain\naspects of your house that you want to\nchange oh yeah there are certain aspects\ni want to change it's it's always too\ndirty okay well that's something that we\ncan work on all right so what do i need\nto do to change it to make sure the\nhouse isn't as dirty as it is maybe you\ndon't love your house what is the house\nthat you love you know how much would it\ncost to buy that house maybe you don't\nhave the money for it right now what do\nyou need to do in order to figure out\nhow to get that money and what you do is\nyou start going through every single\naspect of your life and you make a plan\nyou just figure out what needs to be\ndone\nwhat about the car you drive do you love\nthe car you drive do you hate the car\nyou drive what do you need to do to\nfigure out what what is the car that you\nwant\nokay figure out what it is how much does\nit cost you go test drive that freaking\nthing so it gets you more excited about\nit and then you're more likely to work\nto try to get that thing okay great\nthat's the card that i want i know what\nthat is i know how much it's going to\ncost me i know exactly how much monthly\npayments going to be if i were to put\ndown x amount of dollars okay what do i\nneed to do to get that money to drive\nthat car\nyou know it's not about just acquiring\nbut it's also thinking you know maybe i\nfeel better about myself when i'm\ndriving this and i show up better to\nwhere i'm going your car's a part of it\nwhat about your clothes is there clothes\nthat you don't like maybe you're like oh\n[ __ ] i've been wearing clothes for the\npast 10 years i haven't bought clothes\nin a really long time okay well style's\nchanged in the past 10 years maybe you\ndon't look as good as you thought you\nused to back in the day and you're like\ni need to change this all right well let\nme change exactly the clothes that i'm\nwearing\nwhat is it that you how much does that\ncost maybe you want to hire somebody to\nto teach you what to wear and they go\nout and they go shopping with you and\nfor you and help you build an actual\nwardrobe where you don't look like a\nshmo right i don't know what it is but\nfigure out what it is that you want what\nabout your mindset what are different\naspects of your mindset that you're like\noh man you know what i talk negatively\nway too much to myself i need to stop\ntalking negatively myself how come i\ncome up a plan to not talk as negative\nto myself right what do i love about the\nway that i talk to myself well\ni build myself up i'm a positive person\ni'm more optimistic whatever it is\nfigure out what you love about the way\nthat you talk to yourself the way that\nyour mindset is and then figure out what\nyou need to change what do you love what\ndo you need to change what about your\nmorning routine what's your morning\nroutine look like right there's so many\naspects of your life every single aspect\nof your life you just go through with a\nfine-tooth comb and you figure out what\nyou like what you don't like and how can\nyou make sure that you're building a\nlife of just the things that you want\nyou think about every single thing that\nyou do on a daily basis from the moment\nyou wake up\nto the moment you go to bed\nhow can i make sure that every single\nthing that i do\nis something that i love\nyou think about every single action that\nyou take from the moment you wake up to\nmoments you go to bed how can i make\nsure that every single action that i\ntake is something that i absolutely love\nthink about every single person you come\nin contact with\nevery person that you talk to every\nperson who's faces you every person who\ncalls you every person who emails you\nevery person who text messages you how\ncan you make sure that every single\nperson you come in contact with is not\nsomebody that brings you down not\nsomebody that's negative but somebody\nwho you absolutely love that wants the\nbest for you and empowers you to be\nbetter perfect what about every thought\nthat you think from the moment you wake\nup to the moment you get what it\nrequires is absolute full awareness\nand i know that some people listen to\nthis it's going to go in one ear and out\nthe other and you're not gonna make a\nplan and you're just gonna go ah yeah\nwell this is a great episode on to the\nnext one instead of actually taking a\nplane and figure out what it is realize\nthat you can go through every single\naspect of your day and start to make\nchanges in everything that you do\nstart to make change in every single\nthing that you have and realize that\nyour life is not going to change right\naway it takes time to change\nthe person that you're with it takes\ntime to change the place that you live\nit takes time to change the career that\nyou have the job that you have the\nemployees that you have whatever it is\nit takes time for change to happen but\nwhat if i told you that\nin 10 years 10 years from today\nyou will have a life that you absolutely\nlove like the perfect life\nwould that excite you\nif you're like 10 years from today i'm\ngonna have the perfect life would that\nexcite you hell yeah it would\nwell it's absolutely possible but it\nrequires you to step up to figure out\nwhat you love what you don't love and\nstart to work past it what's crazy about\nis that some people\nlike if you really think about it some\npeople are more intentional\nabout putting hard work into their jobs\nand many people hate those jobs so some\npeople are putting hard work and showing\nup and getting [ __ ] done in a job that\nthey absolutely hate but they're not\neven doing that for their own freaking\nlife it blows my mind that some people\ntake their jobs more serious than they\ntake their life\nright so imagine if you and i are\ncreating a business we're gonna go in as\nbusiness partners what are we gonna do\nwe're gonna create a business plan first\nwe're not just going to go hey we're\njust going to sell this product and see\nwhat happens no we're going to come up\nwith a business plan and figure out\nexactly okay what's the marketing look\nlike what's the sales look like what's\nthe shipping look like what's the this\nlook like and the pictures the\nphotography and all that stuff we're\ngoing to have about the business plan\nright\ndo you even have a life plan\nthink about that for a second that's the\nfirst thing now if we're business\npartners we're going to at least have\nquarterly reviews aren't we if you work\nfor a business you guys have quarterly\nreviews on what you do\nso do you have quarterly reviews in your\nlife\nno\nwell what are you doing why don't you\ntry to figure out a way to start coming\nup with quarterly reviews see if you're\non track to hitting your goals the same\nway that if you're on a sales team\nyou're going to have quarterly reviews\nwhat else you're gonna have weekly\nmeetings\nsee how today how this week went you're\ngonna look back and look forward see\nwhat you're working for see what's going\non and then what are you gonna do\nsometimes my team and i have a morning\nhuddle every single morning\nevery morning i talk to my team do you\neven have a morning huddle with yourself\nor you're just kind of\nseeing what happens\nif you're not fully satisfied with your\nlife it might be because you've just not\nbeen intentional you're not been having\nquarterly meetings you have no plan you\nhave no quarterly meetings you have no\nweekly meetings you have no morning\nhuddles\nof course you're not where you want to\nbe because you might not even know where\nyou want to be at this point and it's\nsome it's just it's just so crazy that\nsome people take their job that they\nhate more serious than the life that\nthey have in the life they're trying to\nbuild\nso what would happen if you took\nyour life as serious and planned out\nyour life as serious and as intricately\nas you do your business or the company\nthat you work for where would your life\nbe in a year five years ten years down\nthe road if you took your life that\nseriously\nand it's simple it's not hard but it\ntakes time you have to plan it out\nfigure out what you want make a plan you\nhave to work for it you're going to have\nto review it often and then you're going\nto have to adjust\nthings are not going to work out exactly\nthe way that you want\nit's going to take some time\nbut\nisn't it worth it\nif this is your life\nshouldn't you be taking this more\nserious than anything else that exists\nbecause this is your life this isn't\nanybody else's life and the more that\nyou take this seriously the more it\naffects every single person you come in\ncontact with\nso\nif you want to build a life that you\nwant it doesn't you don't just wake up\nand it's given to you it's something\nthat's planned meticulously it's\nreviewed often and it's going to require\nyou to execute every single day but\nif you take the time you put in the work\ni promise you you're going to wake up\none day and go holy crap\ni love my life and that's all that\nreally matters\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well and i\ndon't want to ask you this question to\ndepress you but in your life who is on\nyour side 100\nand i'm going to ask you this question\nwho's not\non your side 100\nmaybe it's time to let them go"
