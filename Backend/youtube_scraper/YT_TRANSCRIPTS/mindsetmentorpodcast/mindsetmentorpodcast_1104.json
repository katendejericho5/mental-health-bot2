    "transcript": "how many life-changing decisions could\nyou have made in your life that you\ndecided to play safe\ninstead of deciding to step up into your\nown personal power\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nstep in your own personal power and one\nthing i'm going to talk about is\ndecision making\nhow to make number one quick decisions\nand number two how to make powerful\ndecisions that come from a place of\ngrowth and not from a place of fear and\nso you have to think that for any\nmassively important decision that you\nmake in your life\na decision where it's going to be\nsomething that could change your life\nbut then also for a lot of very very\nsmall decisions there's only one of two\nplaces that that decision can come from\none of them is it can come from a place\nof fear and for most people it comes\nfrom a place of fear so if you look back\nover your entire life the things that\nyou've done the things that you haven't\ndone the decisions that you've made\nmaybe\ndecisions have popped up of should i\nstart a business should i not start a\nbusiness should i marry this person\nshould i not marry this person should i\nbreak up should i not break up should we\nhave children whatever it is when you\nlook back on the majority of the\ndecisions that you've made in your life\nwould you say that those came from a\nplace of fear or that they came from a\nplace of personal power\nthink about that for a second when you\nlook back would you say that that more\nthan 50 came from a place of personal\npower or more than 50 percent came from\na place of fear and the one thing that i\nhave found is that for most people the\nmajority of their important decisions\nthat they have in their life actually\ncome from a place of fear and what do i\nmean by that is in for me i know\npersonally that that for a really long\ntime all of my decisions came from a\nplace of fear staying inside of my\ncomfort zone not wanting to step out of\nmy comfort zone not wanting to challenge\nmyself not wanting to push myself\nwanting to take the easy route\nthey i had decisions that were based in\nmy comfort zone to stay inside of my\ncomfort zone because it's easier to just\nstay comfortable than this to push\nyourself\nso for me i know that the majority of my\ndecisions for a very long time came from\na place of fear but if you look at your\nlife would you say that majority of them\ncame from a place of fear or a place of\npersonal power just think about that for\na second and answer it out loud to\nyourself what i have found is that most\npeople's decisions\nactually come from a place of fear\nlike for instance\nshould i start a business or should i\njust continue to stay at this job that\npays me a salary\nmost people\nusually stay at that place they give you\nsalary just because it's easier and you\nknow do you think to yourself oh my gosh\ni don't know what's going to happen if i\nif i i do know that i'm paid every two\nweeks in this job but if i leave this\njob i don't know what's going to happen\ni don't know if i'm going to get paid\nevery single week i don't know if my\nbusiness is going to succeed i don't\nknow if it's gonna fail and when you\nstart thinking that way\nare you thinking from power or you're\nthinking from fear you're thinking from\nfear\nright so\nwhy do most people go from a place of\nfear is because your brain will\nautomatically go to fear and you have to\nrealize that so it's easy to go to fear\nbecause that's what your brain\nautomatically does that is what kept our\nspecies alive our brain is designed to\ndo one thing really well and that's help\nyou survive the problem with that is\nthat it will usually go the easiest\nroute not pushing yourself not doing\nthings that you've never done before not\nstepping into the unknown so our brain\nis designed to keep us alive we still\nhave a part of our brain that's been\naround for 1.5 to 2 million years called\nthe amygdala which is where all fear\ncomes from\nthe fear of oh my gosh i don't know if\nif i'm going to be attacked by a lion\nwhen i walk outside\nhas now been turned into the fear of\nwhat if i fail what if i'm judged what\nif i get rejected by people what if\npeople throw their opinions at me and so\nnow because we don't have the fear of\ndeath we now have the fear of judgments\nand rejections and\nopinions\nbecause the amygdala still exists so\nmost people what your brain is going to\nautomatically do pretty much everybody\nwhat your brain is automatically going\nto do is go to a place of fear\nand so we have to consciously be aware\nof this\nand have ourselves step out of the fear\nand into our own personal power and when\ni say power\ni don't mean power in controlling other\npeople because people can think you know\nit can have a bad connotation of power\nbut when i say power i mean power is you\nstepping into who you could be\nbeing coming from an actual powerful\nplace\nbeing a powerful being in this world and\nso that's why it's very important to be\nself-aware is because if you're not\nself-aware if you're not paying\nattention to where your brain's doing\nwhat your thoughts doing what your\nactions are doing is the majority of\ntime will actually sink into fear we'll\nsink into comfort we'll seek into\ncoiling away instead of actually\nstepping out and doing what it is that\nwe want to do and so\nyou know if you think about it how many\nhow many great decisions do you feel\nlike you have made in your life from a\nplace of fear and i don't mean fear of\ndeath like i'm not gonna drive 200 miles\nan hour\nbecause of the fact that i could die to\n200 miles an hour to lose control of my\ncar i mean actual decisions that could\nchange your life whether it's you know\nrelationships whether it's\nstepping out and starting your own\nbusiness\ngetting on stage in front of other\npeople whatever it is\nhow many of your decisions that are\ngreat decisions where you're like hell\nyeah i'm so glad that i did that\ncame from a place of fear\nprobably none right\nbut\nif you look back ask yourself how many\nof your decisions that you don't love or\nwhat that you wish you would have done\ndifferently came from a place of fear\nwhere you're like man i i\ni feel like i i wasn't as good as i\ncould have been i feel like i didn't\nstep out i feel like i didn't bring what\ni could to the world how many of those\ndecisions\ncame from a place of fear\nusually it's most of them right if you\nthink about\nall of the great decisions that have\nbeen made in the world all of the\namazing things that have happened in the\nworld all of the amazing companies that\nhave been built all of the amazing\nproducts that have been built the\nbiggest inventions in the world how many\nof those came from a place of fear\nprobably none\nwhy because nothing is really built um\nnothing amazing is built nothing\ninspiring is built on fear no life that\nbecomes amazing is built on fear which\ngoes into if you think about the people\nthat you\nare inspired by the most\nthe steve jobs elon musk's michael\njordans whoever they might be whoever it\nis that inspires you gandhi nelson\nmandela\nhow many of them lived a life filled\nwith fear and made decisions based in\nfear\nnone of them the people that you look up\nto the people that have the most\ninspiring stories are always the people\nthat step into their own personal power\nthey know that there's probably going to\nbe people against them but they know\nwhat they're worth they know what\nthey're supposed to do they know where\nthey're going in this world they know\nwhat they're building and they know that\nthere might be resistance but they're\nnot going to let fear control them what\nare they going to do they're going to\nstep into their personal power and\nthey're going to make decisions based on\nthat personal power\nso now you can start to see the\nimportance of realizing when you're\ncoiling away in fear\nand when you're actually stepping up\ninto a place of personal power\nan example of of of a decision that's\nimportant that people need to be made is\nis like i told you earlier starting a\nbusiness most people go the quote\nunquote safe route by working for\nanother company we all learned in 2020\nthat the safe route is not safe because\nimmediately\n35 million people lost their jobs so\nwhat was safe they actually realized\nit's completely unsafe what's the safest\njob you can have working for yourself\nwhy because you can't fire you i mean i\nguess you could fire yourself but you're\nnot going to fire yourself but you're in\ncontrol of your paycheck that's safe if\nyou ask me because companies could just\nchange their mind and you're gone the\nnext day\nbut how many people\ncoil away and stay at a job that they\ndon't enjoy\nor that they weren't meant for or that's\nnot fully fulfilling to them\nand don't\ngo and do what they truly want or don't\nstart a business or don't start a\nnon-profit simply because there happens\nto be fear\nbecause they're not stepping into their\nown personal power\nthink about that for a second\nanother thing that pops into my head as\nwell is investing\nright so investing let's say it's\ninvesting into the stock market right\nhow many great great stock market\ndecisions came from a place of fear\nprobably not too many\nhow many great decisions into investing\ninto companies came from a place of fear\nprobably not too many usually it's\npersonal power what about investing into\nyour own personal development maybe you\nwant to learn how to do something and\nthere's a course or a seminar or uh a\nperson that you can hire to be your\nmentor\nright you could go oh man i don't know\nabout spending this money i don't know\nif this person's worth it i don't know\nif i'm gonna make my money back i don't\nknow if this is truly what i meant to do\nthen you can have all those fearful\nideas and thoughts come into your head\nand you can listen to those and stay in\nthe exact same place and not invest into\nyourself or you can say you know what\nthis is what i truly want to do i'm\ngoing to pay this person to help me\nfigure it out or to teach me or to build\nthe course or whatever it is that i need\nto do to help me build my business to\nhelp me build my relationship help me\nbuild my finances whatever it is you\ncouldn't go from a place of fear or you\ncan go from a place of personal power\nand say you know what this is what i\nwant to do i do want to take control of\nmy finances so i will hire this\nfinancial advisor or finance coach or\nwhatever it is that you're hiring and go\ni'm going to step into my personal power\nright now and learn from this person\nright so there's two examples right\nthere of fear decisions you could go\ninto fear or you could go i'm going to\ntake control of my life this is what i\ntruly need to do this is what i want to\ndo how many decisions have you made that\nyou are proud of that came from a place\nof playing it safe\nbecause there was no risk you're like\ni'm going to take the less risky way\nprobably not many\nyou know there's a quote that says in\nlife if you don't risk anything you risk\neverything\nlet me say that again\nin life if you don't risk anything\nyou risk everything\nand so how long have you been sitting in\na place of taking as little risk as\npossible taking the easy route\nbecause you're afraid of what could\nhappen if you stepped off into your own\npersonal power how many life-changing\ndecisions could you have made in your\nlife\nlet's say you're 35 years old how many\nmoments of decision did you have\nthat you decided to play safe\ninstead of deciding to step up into your\nown personal power\nwhen you know that you should have\nthink about that and usually the\ndifference is that is that your gut\nfeeling knows that you need to step into\nyour own personal power your gut feeling\ni always call your emotional compass so\nit's kind of like you're guiding light\nand you're following this thing that you\nwant to be doing not even that you want\nto be doing that you feel like you're\nsupposed to do and your gut feeling will\ngive you the intuition the intuitive\nhits to say hey this is the path you're\nsupposed to go down and we can feel this\npath of like i want to go start my\nbusiness this is what i'm supposed to do\nbut\nwe can listen to our brain because our\nbrain is always filled with fear and say\noh but that doesn't make sense you're\nnot going to make any money doing this\nyou have a family you have to support\nyou have you know bills you have to pay\nwhat if you don't succeed what if you\nand your family are homeless\nand so there's always the gut feeling\nwhich is usually the personal power your\ngut knows what's going to make your your\nsoul grow\nbut then there's also always the brain\nside of it which is the fearful side\nthat keeps you inside of your comfort\nzone\nand so\nwhen you think about it when you feel\nthose feelings of oh my god i don't know\nif i should do this or not\nyou know that when you feel that fear\ncoming up that you're on the edge of\nyour comfort zone and what do you do\nwhen you're on the edge of your comfort\nzone lean in because it's showing you\nthat this is a place to grow this isn't\nplace to coil away this isn't a place to\nstep back this isn't a place to get to\nto go in the opposite direction if i'm\nfeeling those feelings of fear that's a\ngood thing that's showing me rob\nyou're at the place now where you're\nabout to grow and if you want to get to\nthe next level the next iteration of who\nrob is you're going to have to lean into\nthis fear\npeople still feel the and i say this all\nthe time is that successful people still\nfeel fear the difference is they don't\nlisten to it unsuccessful people also\nfeel fear but the problem is they listen\nto it and then they coil away and they\nstay in their comfort zone become afraid\ni hope that next time you feel that fear\npop up you go nope i'm going to do this\nanyways i don't give a damn about what\nthis fear is telling me right now\nit's about what you it's about stepping\ninto what you could be\nwhat you should be\nversus what you are\nright you know where you are\nyou know what happens when you do\nexactly what you've done\nand if you think about it and the\nquestion i always love to ask is how\nlong have you been stuck in your current\ncomfort zone\nsix months a year\ntwo years three years five years 10\nyears 20 years maybe\nif you continue to do the same things\nand continue to coil away every time you\nfeel this big moment of decision and\nstep into a place of fear\nthen if you fast forward 10 years from\nnow you're going to be in the exact same\nposition\ni promise you that\nbut if you were to go you know what i'm\ngonna i feel the fear and when i feel\nthe fear i know that i have a decision\nof either going with the fear or going\nwith personal power what does my gut say\nthat i should do my gut's telling me to\nmove forward instead of coil away okay\nthat scares the out of me but i'm\ngonna do it anyways and then if you do\nthat over and over and over again and\nstep in and lean into the fear\nguess what happens you fast forward five\nyears from now ten years from now you\nhave a completely different life\ncompletely different\nbut that's the difference is you need to\nbecome very self-aware of what's\nactually happening and when you're\nstarting to coil back and be afraid and\ntake a step back versus actually leaning\nin to the discomfort so you've got to be\nvery self-aware of when you're feeling\nthose and the thing about is noticing\nfear is a good thing like i said because\nwell here's the first thing noticing the\nfear is a good thing\nlistening to the fear is a bad thing\nso if i notice fear\nnumber one\nthat's good because i'm becoming\nself-aware when before i was probably\njust just reacting to my fear and just\nfollowing it subconsciously so if i'm\nnoticing my fear that's a good thing\nbecause i'm becoming self-aware number\ntwo as i said it's showing me the edge\nof my comfort zone\nso when i feel the physical feelings of\nfear and you know the physical feelings\nof fear of like oh i don't know if i\nshould be doing this i don't know if\nthis is right i don't feel good this is\nmaking me very uncomfortable\nboom i'm in a great place i need to lean\ninto that fear because if i lean into it\ni'm going to be pushing myself out of my\ncomfort zone and each one of us should\nbe putting us putting ourselves outside\nof our comfort zone at least once a day\nand if you do this over and over and\nover and over again and push yourself\nout of your comfort zone and step into\nyour personal power every single day\nand you fast forward five years from now\nlike i said completely different life\nbut you have to realize\nthe only person that can make that\nawareness\nof fear or personal power is you and the\nonly person that can make the decision\nof following your fear and listening to\nit or stepping into your personal power\nis to is you so if you continue to\nlisten to your fear and you fast forward\nfive years from now you're not gonna\nlike where you are\ni promise you that if you continue to\nlisten to your fear and you fast forward\nfive years from now\nlistening to your fear you're not gonna\nlike where your life is at\nbut if you notice your fear\nand go okay i'm aware of my fear now\nthat's telling me i need to find what my\npersonal power is and what i need to\nstep into and what my gut is telling me\nto do so i'm going to step into that\nfear\ni'm sorry step into that that personal\npower because i feel the fear\nand you do that every single day\nconsistently knowing that you're not\ngoing to die when you step into your\npersonal power you'll have a completely\ndifferent life in five years\nbut if you listen to it listen to that\nfear and stay in the fear you're not\ngonna like where you are\nso the goal is to notice the physical\nfeelings notice the thoughts that are\nhappening inside of your brain\nand then become very self-aware when you\ntake yourself out of the jar and read\nthe label you know when you're in the\njar you can't read the label so take\nyourself out of the jar act like if\nyou're just you're coaching yourself and\nyou're a completely different person and\nyou look at it and say this person that\ni'm that i'm aware of right now are they\nfeeling fear they are are they about to\nmake it so there's two decisions there's\na fearful decision and there's a\npersonal power decision\nyou write it down on a piece of paper\nwhich one should they take as if it's\nnot you and you're coaching this person\nokay the fear decision is this what's\ngoing to happen what are the\nrepercussions if they follow this fear\ndecision\nwhat is their life going to look like in\nfive years okay what is the the\nrepercussions if they decide to to step\nout of their comfort zone and follow\ntheir personal power where could that\ntake them in five years and when you\nactually start to plan it out you become\nself-aware and you start to decide\nyou know what i'm gonna start to make\nthe majority of my decisions coming from\na place of personal power instead of a\nplace of fear\nand you do this every single day\npromise you you will wake up\nfive or ten years from now and have a\ncompletely different life that is\ncompletely unrecognizable to the person\nthat you are right now but\nas i always say there's only one person\nthat can make that decision for your\nlife\nand that is you\nso either step into fear or step in a\npersonal power the choice\nis yours\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well so i'm\ngoing to take a guess that i probably\nknow 95 of you what your fear is how\nmany of those can kill you the answer is\nzero we're actually born with only two\nfears the fear of\nand the fear\n[Music]"
