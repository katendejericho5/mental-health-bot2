    "transcript": "it's hard to put in the hard work that's\nwhy it's called hard work do you know\nwhat's even more hard than hard work\nbeing broke the question is what are you\ngoing to do about it in this moment\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow hard life can be and we're going to\ntalk about how to work through it and i\nwant to talk about this because no\nmatter who you are\nno matter where you live no matter where\nyou're from life is going to be hard at\nsome point life\nyou can go through this entire life this\nhuman experience\nand you can't go through the entire\nthing without getting some scars along\nthe way some injuries you can't go\nwithout getting a couple broken bones so\ntoday we're going to talk about how life\nis going to be hard either way\nbut you might not realize it you're\nactually making life harder on yourself\nthan you believe so life is already\ngoing to be hard but you're making it\nharder so today we're going to talk\nabout how to relieve yourself from life\nbeing so hard and how to make it easier\nand also how to have a happier life as\nwe're going through but the best part\nabout life being hard is that you get to\npick your heart what do i mean by that\nyou get to pick\nwhether you want life to be hard right\nnow\nor you want life to be hard for the rest\nof your life so you can either have\nimmediate life being hard or the rest of\nyour life life can be hard and let me\ngive you a couple of examples so this\nmakes a lot more sense right\ndo you know what is hard\nhard work\nhard work is hard\nit's hard to to force yourself to work\n30 40 extra hours on top of the job you\nalready have it's hard to have sleepless\nnights you could start your business you\ncould support your family or be able to\ntravel the world or start your dream job\nor whatever it is or impact the people\nthat you want it's hard to put in hard\nwork it's hard to put in 60 70 80 100\nhours a week for a year two years three\nyears sometimes it's hard to put in the\nhard work that's why it's called hard\nwork do you know what's even more hard\nthan hard work being broke\nbeing broke is way harder\ni'll tell you i've been in both\nsituations before i've been in a\nsituation where i've been really really\nbroke\nand i've been in a situation where i've\nworked really really hard\ni've been in the situation where i was\nfive months behind on my car payment i\nalmost lost my car\ni've been in the exact same situation\nthat same time where i lived off of\npasta for two months inside of my one\nbedroom apartment in fort lauderdale\nflorida\nlost my the company i was running ran it\ninto the ground lost all my money went\ninto debt lived off pasta for two months\nliterally all i ate for two months was\npasta sauce which was 1.88 at walmart in\na box of pasta which is 88 cents at\nwalmart that's how i lived for two\nmonths that sucks\nand if i hadn't made any changes in my\nlife guess what i would have been in the\nexact same situation you know what else\nis hard about being broke not being able\nto provide\nfor your family the way that you want to\nnot being able to provide for your\nfamily the way that you think that they\ndeserve to be provided for you know\nwhat's hard the judgment that you place\non yourself for not being able to\nprovide for your family all of those\nthings are hard what's hard is seeing\nthat some people can you know take their\nchildren to other countries and travel\nwith them and get experiences be able to\nafford to put them into a college or be\nable to help them with their first car\nthat's hard to see that you can't do\nthat but other people can\nso either you can decide that you're\ngoing to work really hard right now and\ntake the hard in this moment\nor you can realize that the rest of your\nlife is going to be hard if you don't\nwork hard\nyou see what i mean\nthe beautiful thing is that the choice\nis yours either you can work hard or you\ncan have life be hard for you because\nyou're broke\nbeing broke is hard hard work is hard\nyou get to choose what's hard you want\nanother example if you think about like\ni've going along with hard work like\ni've been lazy\ni've procrastinated and i'm gonna ask\nyou have you been lazy before have you\never procrastinated have you ever put\noff what it is that you actually truly\nneed to do because you don't want to do\nit right now in that moment when you're\nbeing lazy in that moment when you're\nprocrastinating in that moment when\nyou're sitting on top of the couch and\nyou're just scrolling through instagram\nyou're thinking about you know just\ntrying to not pay attention to your\nworries\nthat's not easy\ni get it\nnot to have that situation it's not easy\nto be stuck in that situation\nit's easy to choose to stay in that\nsituation because it's easier right now\nbut i want you to realize in that moment\nit's easy\nbut what's not easy about it is the life\nthat it's going to give you for the rest\nof your life until you make changes so\nsome people are like oh i don't like my\ncircumstances okay well show me your\nactions\nif you don't like your circumstances let\nme see what your actions are on a daily\nbasis\nso\nif you're being lazy or you're\nprocrastinating you're choosing easy\nright now\nwhich is going to turn into hard later\nnow if you were to flip that and go you\nknow what i'm going to put in the work\ni'm going to get some willpower i'm\ngonna force myself to do the things i\nneed to do to create the life that i\nwant well\nit's gonna be hard now i promise you\nthat\nbut by putting in the work now life will\nbecome easier down the road so either\nyou choose easy now\nand hard later or hard now and easy\nlater because you either have a choice\nin every situation it's either instant\ngratification or it's delayed\ngratification\nsitting on instagram just looking at\nyour phone not doing the stuff that you\nneed to is instant gratification you're\njust flipping through doing mindless\nstuff getting drops of dopamine and\nsaying oh this is great i'm able to look\nthrough these things and i don't have to\ndo any work right now\nbut that's not going to put money in\nyour bank account that's not going to\ngive you the life that you want\ndelayed gratification is putting in the\nwork now\nknowing that it's you're not going to\nsee the fruits of your labor for a few\nmonths a few years maybe like you don't\nplant a tree\nand immediately get fruit from it it's\ngot to grow and that's exactly how your\nlife has to be as well so the difference\nbetween instant gratification delayed\ngratification is instant gratification\nis sitting on the couch being on\ninstagram\nwhatever it is\nchoosing the easy route right now\ndelayed gratification is putting in the\nhard work it's really hard now but it's\ngoing you're going to get the fruits of\nyour labor later on down the road\nanother example of choosing your heart\nof instant gratification versus delayed\ngratification\nis this do you know what's hard eating\nhealthy\nit's hard it's hard to\nsay no to delicious food\nand you know you can make healthy food\ndelicious but i'll tell you this i don't\nknow a whole lot of things that really\ncompete with a big old pizza\nbut\nyou have to say no to pizza that's hard\nit's hard to eat no sugar it's hard to\nsay no to alcohol for some people it's\nhard to be healthy and to take care of\nyour body to say no to gluten say you\nknow no to red meats to say no to the\nthings that the greasy stuff the fried\nchicken whatever it is all of those\nthings that taste so good it's hard to\nsay no to them\nand when you say no to him in the moment\nyou don't get any immediate\ngratification it's all delayed\ngratification but do you know what else\nis hard what else is hard being\noverweight\nbeing obese\nyour body failing on you because of not\nbeing taken care of for years having\ncomplications because of your weight\nhaving complications because of choices\nthat you made in the past which were\nbased off of instant gratification\ninstead of delayed gratification\nright\npossibly not being able to live as long\nthat's hard\nyou know what else is hard not being\nable to see your children walk down the\naisle because of choice that you made in\nthe past not being able to see your\ngrandkids grow up\nbecause of choice that you made in the\npast\nthat's the difference between instant\ngratification versus delay gratification\nin in those choices when you look and\ntake yourself outside of your own head\nyou realize it's not just hard on you\nthat's also going to be hard on other\npeople down the road not just yourself\nso one of them is hard now which is\nsaying no in eating healthy and the\nthings that you should and actually\ntaking care of your body and one of them\nis hard later which is eating unhealthy\nnow\nbut then seeing what happens down the\nroad seeing the repercussions of maybe\nthe decisions that you didn't make and\nthe bad choices that you made\nsimply because you wanted instant\ngratification or as joe rogan says mouth\npleasure you just want something that\ntastes good that's all that you're\nworried about you're not worried about\nthe repercussions in the future so both\nof those are hard one of them is hard\nnow and easy later\none of them is easy now and hard later\nwhich one do you choose the choice is\nalways up to you\nlet's give you another example you know\nwhat else is hard working out five times\na week\ni don't know about you i've never been\nin i've never loved working out i forced\nmyself to do it\nand i enjoy it after i'm done but i\nenjoy don't enjoy the process of\nthinking about doing it i don't enjoy\nthe process of showing up to the gym i\ndon't enjoy the process of working out\nlifting heavy that's hard\ngoing for runs that's hard forcing\nyourself to get off the couch that's\nhard\nthose things are hard\ndo you know what else is hard\ndeciding not to work out\nand then realizing years down the road\nthat you're immobile\nhaving joint issues having muscular\nissues skeletal issues\nnot being able to play with your\ngrandkids in the yard and throw the\nfootball because of choices that you\nmade in the past of being too immobile\nlike we have such sedentary lives we're\nsitting all of the time\nand we have to realize that just you\nknow it's like they say sitting is the\nnew cancer people are going to start\ndying in droves because of the fact that\nthey're not taking care of their body\nand sitting for long periods of time can\nreally start to get at you so it's it's\neasier to sit and just to be sitting and\nstay sitting all day long it's hard to\nget up and do a workout but once again\nif you look at them\none of them is easy now and hard later\none of them is hard now and easy later\nbut once again what do i say you get to\nchoose which hearts you want to go for\none of them is hard now working out\nforcing yourself to do things you don't\nwant to do one of them's hard later\nbeing immobile being injured not being\nable to play with your your grandkids\nmaybe not being around maybe not being\nable to leave a wheelchair because you\nlive such a sedentary life\nso which heart do you want to choose\nwhat else is hard tough conversations\nare hard\nit's hard to sit down with someone that\nyou love maybe a spouse or someone your\nrelationship with or maybe a close\nfriend or maybe a family member it's\nhard to sit down and have a conversation\nthat's tough that absolutely needs to be\nhad\nbut it's also hard\nto see what happens if you don't have\nthose conversations\nif you don't have that tough\nconversation of hey i think that maybe\nyou should stop drinking\nif you have that tough conversation with\nsomebody\nmaybe they don't stop drinking maybe\nsomething happens to them down the road\nugh that's not very good you don't have\nthose tough conversations with your\nspouse that you're afraid to have\nbecause you're like uh i i really want\nto make sure that i don't get into an\nargument i'm worried about that you\ndon't have those tough conversations and\nwhat happens down the road maybe the\nmarriage starts to dissolve because it's\nbeen years and years and years of not\ncommunicating at the level that you need\nto communicate so it's tough to have\nthose it's hard to have those tough\nconversations right now\nbut any relationship the most important\npart is communication so if you are\navoiding conversations that need to be\nhad\nsomething might happen down the road\nsomething might deteriorate down the\nroad somebody's health might deteriorate\ndown the road your relationship might\ndeteriorate down the road\nit's you choose your heart now\nor it's going to be hard later\nwhich path do you want to take\none is hard now one is hard later\nthe beautiful thing about it is it's\ncompletely up to you do you know what\nelse is hard financial discipline is\nhard\nto not want to compete with everybody\nthat you see on instagram\nthat's hard to be able to not go out and\nspend money when you don't need to it's\nharder to stay home and cook something\nthan is to go out to eat financial\ndiscipline is hard\nsitting down and taking time and putting\na budget together every single month and\nmaking sure you're sticking to it is\nhard it takes time it's easier not to do\nit\nbut do you know it's even harder than\nthat\nbeing in debt your entire life\nbeing in debt not being able to do the\nthings that you want to\nnot be able to travel to the place that\nyou want to not be able to have the\nfreedom that you want to because you\ndidn't sit down and make a budget\nbecause you didn't sit down to make a\nplan all of these things are hard it's\neither hard now or it's hard later\ninstant gratification is so much easier\nit is that's why so many people choose\ninstant gratification\nbecause it's easier\nbut\nif you were to fast forward\n10 years 20 years 30 years from now\nand see what your life would be if you\ndecided to choose instant gratification\nevery single time\nyou wouldn't be happy about it you\nwouldn't be happy about where your life\nwould be in 10 years 20 years 30 years\nwhere your family's life would be 10\nyears 20 years 30 years\nwhere your relationship should be 10\nyears 20 years 30 years where your\nfinances would be 10 years 20 years 30\nyears down the road where your body\nwould be 10 years 20 years 30 years down\nthe road\nin the moment it seems awesome\nin the moment all i want to do is sit\ndown on my couch eat a big pizza and\nsome ice cream that sounds amazing\ndoesn't it but\nif i fast forward and have those types\nof decisions every single day for the\nnext 30 years\nmy body my mind my finances my life my\nrelationships are not going to be in the\norder that i that i want them to be\nso i don't know about you\ninstant gratification seems a lot easier\ndelayed gratification is a lot harder\nwhy because you're working something\nthat you don't immediately get to see\nyou don't plant a seed in the ground and\nit immediately grows into a\nfruit-bearing tree but you know that\nwhen you plant the seed into the ground\nand you take care of it and you water it\nand you give it the sunlight you take\ncare of it you water it you give it\nsunlight eventually one years two years\nthree years down the road it will start\nto bear fruit and that is what makes it\neasier that's when you're actually going\nto start loving the decisions that she\nmade in the past\nyour life where you're currently are\nright now in this moment\nis all of a bunch of little teeny tiny\ndecisions\ntiny decisions over the past 10 15 years\ngot you to where you are right now\nwhether it's what you want or whether\nyou don't don't want the beautiful thing\nabout that though is that from right now\ninto the future\nthe next 15 years of your life where you\nare in 15 years will be a bunch of\nlittle teeny tiny decisions did you\nchoose instant gratification or did you\nchoose delayed gratification\nwhich one did you choose one's easy now\nand hard later one's hard later hard now\neasy later instant gratification is\nalways going to be easier but it's\nalways going to be much harder in the\nlong run and it's not going to pay off\nbecause it sucks you're stuck in the\nexact same situation\nsame situation or sometimes even worse\nso at some point\nyou have to sit down and be real with\nyourself you have to realize that nobody\nelse is in control of your life nobody\ncan make you do something you don't want\nto do nobody is telling you to sit on\nthe couch and\nyou know not get off and work out not\nget up and you know nobody's telling you\nto stop eating the pizza nobody's\ntelling you stop having the extra beers\nwhen you come home from work nobody's\ntelling you to stop doing those things\nyou have to be the person that does it\nfor you you have to realize at some\npoint in time either my life is going to\nbe\nreally great in 10 years or i'm not\ngoing to be enjoying my life in 10 years\nand that's the truth\nthe question is what are you going to do\nabout it in this moment\nlife is going to be hard it's hard for\neverybody like i said in the beginning\nnobody goes through this life without\nscars\nit will either be easy now or really\n hard later or it'll be hard now\nand easier\nlater but i guarantee if you choose hard\nnow\nnot only a little bit easier\nlater on down the road but you'll be\nmuch more satisfied with the life that\nyou'll build that you've built you've\nrealized you'll realize 10 years from\nnow\nthat if you look around that your entire\nlife was a bunch of little teeny tiny\ndecisions where you decided not to get\nthe instant gratification we decided to\npush yourself a little bit more do you\ndecide to put in the hard work you\ndecided to work out you decided to eat\nhealthy you decided to get your finances\nin order you decided to fix your\nrelationships all of those were hard\nbut if you fast forward in 10 years all\nof them are going to be so much easier\nand so much better because you chose the\nright choice your life is your choice\nnobody is telling you to take instant\ngratification nobody's also telling you\nto take delayed gratification you\nchoose which one you want it's either\neasy now or hard later or hard now easy\nlater the choice\nas always and everything this beautiful\nlife\nis yours\nhey thanks so much for
