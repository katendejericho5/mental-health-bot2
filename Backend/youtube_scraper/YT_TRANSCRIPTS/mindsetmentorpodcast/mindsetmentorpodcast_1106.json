the way\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nwhy\nmotivation sucks\nhmm let's dive in uh one thing thing and\ni hate\ni'm categorized as a motivational\nspeaker i hate being categorized as a\nmotivational speaker because i think\nmotivation sucks now is it necessary is\nit needed yes is it um\nbuilt up too much absolutely a hundred\npercent\nlet me tell you why uh so often i get\nmessages from people like sir i'm not\nmotivated help me become more motivated\nwhat do i need to do to be more\nmotivated how can i be more motivated to\ncreate the life that i want to i get\nthat message probably on instagram and\nfacebook\n20 times a day between the two of them\nand my answer is always the same so i'm\njust going to start sending this podcast\nso probably\nmotivation sucks you're not searching\nfor motivation\nwhat you're searching for is drive\nso let me explain now jim rohn who's\nbasically the the godfather of personal\ndevelopment in motivation says that\nmotivation is like a shower we recommend\nthat you do both every single day the\nsame way that you should shower every\nsingle day you should become motivated\nevery single day what do i mean by\nbecome motivated\nwell\nread a book that inspires you listen to\na podcast that inspires you and\nmotivates you listen to somebody on\nyoutube and watch some youtube talks\nthat are going to give you motivation\nwhat i'm saying to you is you have to\nget motivation motivation is like a\nspark so if i'm trying to start a fire\nmotivation can start that fire\nbut it doesn't keep the fire going the\nspark\nwill start it but it won't keep the fire\ngoing\nhow do you keep the fire going\ndrive\nso if we're saying that motivation is a\nspark\nthen drive\ndrive\nthat's like the big dry log that you put\non and it burns the entire night you've\ndone it before you've gone camping right\nand you put that one big ass log and it\ntakes a while to get started and it gets\ngoing and you wake up the next morning\nyou're like oh my gosh this thing is\nstill kind of like burning from the\ninside\nthat's what you're trying to create in\nyour life you're not trying to create\nmotivation you need motivation but\nmotivation is nothing compared to drive\nnothing compared to drive\ndrive keeps you going motivation just\nkind of gets you off the couch a little\nbit so\nwhat's the difference between the two of\nthem well if somebody's motivated you\ncould be motivated for 10 minutes 15\nminutes 20 minutes but a driven person\nyou know a driven person when you see a\ndriven person you know what i'm talking\nabout you can see it in their eyes\nthey're almost a little bit crazy in\ntheir eyes right you can hear it in\ntheir voice there's just a little bit\nextra there's that passion there's that\nthat that drive where it's like you get\nthe sense by looking in their eyes\nby hearing them talk\nby seeing their body language that\nnothing will stop them from what they're\ntrying to get to\nthat\nis what you're searching for in this\nworld you're not searching for the spark\nyou're searching for the log the drive\nthe thing that keeps you going no matter\nwhat\nyou know if you think of uh you know if\nyou think of movies where\na woman who's a mother has her children\nstolen\nright and you can tell that she's either\ngoing to find her children or she's\ngoing to die trying to find her children\nthat is drive she is driven to this one\nthing\nand it's almost like she doesn't even\nhave to work towards it with your with\ndrive you don't have to work towards it\nyou're almost being you're not forcing\nyourself to do it you're being pulled\ntowards that thing so motivation is like\noh i got to get my ass moving i got to\nforce myself and it's force force force\nforce drive is like i'm being pulled to\nthis thing that i want and nothing is\ngoing to stop me i'm either going to get\nit or i'm going to try i'm going to die\ntrying to get that thing\nthat is the difference between drive and\nmotivation so what you're searching for\nis drive something to be driven by\nso\nnow the immediate question that comes up\nis how do you find that why how do you\nbecome so driven you have to figure out\nexactly what your why is behind it so\nit's beautiful to have goals\neverybody should have goals\nbut very few people hit their goals why\nbecause their goals are just things\nthey're shooting for what they don't\nhave behind the goal is why they're\ntrying to get to that goal\nthat is the most important part my very\nfirst mentor when i was 19 years old\nused to say if the why is strong enough\nthe how will reveal itself\nlet me say that again if the why\nbehind what it is that you're trying to\ndo\nis strong enough the how how you're\ngoing to do it will reveal itself\nwhen someone's driven they don't care\nabout the y they don't care about the\nprocess if you're a process driven\nperson it's really hard for you to start\nbecause you're thinking about all of the\nthings that you need to do before you\nstart\nyou're not driven towards it when you're\ndriven towards something you don't give\na damn about the process you'll figure\nit out along the way\nyou're going to get there\nor you're going to die trying that's the\ndifference between the two\nand that's why it's so important to have\nthe strong why so let's talk about how\nto find your why because if you're\ntrying to\nbecome driven how do you become driven\nyou get your why\nbehind what it is you're doing so how do\nyou find your why\nyou have to look at your goals you have\nto say why do i want this why do i want\nthis why do i want this there's a\nprocess called the seven levels of why\nwhere you go through and ask yourself\nwhy why why why why and you get deeper\nand deeper and deeper into why it is\nyou're you're searching for what you're\nsearching for why are you trying to get\nto whatever it is that you're trying to\nget to and you figure it out i'll give\nyou a couple of examples of people who\ni can tell you their goal right now and\nthen i can tell you their why and you\ncan see how somebody can go from i'm\nmotivated to do this to i'm driven to do\nthis so years and years ago one of my\nvery first coaching clients that i had\nhis goal he was he wanted to make a\nhundred thousand dollars for the year\ni was like cool that's great why do you\nwant to make that hundred thousand\ndollars he's like oh well i want to make\na hundred thousand dollars because i've\nnever made a hundred thousand dollars\nbefore i was like cool why why do you\nwant to get it though oh i want to get\nit because i think it helped you know\nhelp me with my financial stability it'd\nbe nice to be out of debt okay why tell\nme why you want to make that money and i\nkept going why why why why why why he's\nlike well i want to be able to provide\nmy family okay why well because i've\nnever been able to provide for my family\nwhy and you go deeper and deeper and\ndeeper and deeper\nand it went from i want to make a\nhundred thousand dollars this year\nto i want to make a hundred thousand\ndollars this year we started uncovering\nall of the the things\nof the real reasons why he's going\ntowards what he's going for\nand what we were able to uncover is\namazing and this is what it is\nhe want to make a hundred thousand\ndollars when we first started because he\nhad never done it before then it turned\ninto he wanted to make a hundred\nthousand dollars\nbecause he did not have custody of his\nchildren he was divorced and he wanted\ncustody of his children but he didn't\nmake enough money to have custody of his\nchildren so his children lived with his\nex-wife and lived in a bad part of town\nin living in a bad part of town he\nactually was able to uncover\nthis subconscious fear\nunder everything realizing that his\nbiggest fear was that his daughter would\nbe pregnant by 13 and his son would be\nkilled in a drive-by if he was if he\nkept them in the place that he was in\nliving with his ex-wife because she\ndidn't live in a good part of town so\nnow we went from i want to make a\nhundred thousand dollars to a year to i\nhave to make a hundred thousand dollars\nthis year because i want\nto basically save my my daughter and my\nson's lives\ni need to get them out of where they are\ni need to be able to afford a house a\ndown payment on a house in a better part\nof town and regain custody of my\nchildren because i want to make sure\nthat i change their lives because if if\nthey stay where they are\neven if she doesn't get pregnant even if\nhe doesn't die\nhe knew that where par what part of town\nthey were in their lives would be\ncompletely different if he if they were\nable to take them out of that part of\ntown and put them in a better part of\ntown get them a better education\nget them to get into college send them\nto college it his making a hundred\nthousand dollars\nhe realized could completely change the\ntrajectory of his children's life\ndo you think he became motivated and\ndriven at that point hell yeah it wasn't\nlike oh i gotta motivate myself to get\nup at five o'clock in the morning\nanymore it was he was up at five o'clock\nin the morning because his children's\nlives depended on it\nthat\nis what drive looks like that is what\nfinding your why behind the goal looks\nlike let me give you another example if\nyou go way back probably about five\nyears i interviewed jeff hoffman\non this podcast and jeff hoffman is the\nfounder he's a billionaire he founded\npriceline.com\nand we were talking about how he\nmotivated his uh in his first company\nwhere he became a millionaire how he\nmotivated his sales people we were still\non the psychology of motivating people\nhow to get people driven all of this\nstuff and he had somebody who came into\nhis office as one of his sales reps and\nhe would do this every single year he'd\nsay hey what's your goal for the year\nand they start talking about it this guy\nsat down and he wanted to make a hundred\nthousand dollars for the year because\nthat's usually most people's goal if\nthey've never done it he want to make a\nhundred thousand dollars for the year\nhe said okay why do you want to make 100\n000 and went deeper and deeper and\ndeeper and deeper\nand what he ended up coming down to\nwas that he wanted he lived in new york\nat the time but he was from florida and\nhis mom had lived in an apartment her\nentire life\nso his mom immigrated from puerto rico\nshe came over from puerto rico and gave\nhim and his sister a better life but she\nlived her dream her entire life was to\njust have a house in america and so she\nlived in apartments his entire life and\nnow this guy that's sitting down jeff\nhoffman he lives in new york and he goes\ni want to make a hundred thousand\ndollars and he goes why why why why why\nwhy they get really deep into it and he\nends up finding out the reason why he\nwant to make that wants to make the\nhundred thousand dollars is because he\nwants to get his mom a house in florida\nand so jeff said perfect\nwhat i want you to do and this is a\nlesson not only for yourself but if\nyou're a leader this is something you\nshould be doing with all of the people\nwho you lead figuring out why they are\nthere why their goals are their goals\nyou should know this that's what a true\nleader should do at all times if you're\na leader so what he said to him is he\ngoes okay so what i want you to do i\nwant you to go and find that perfect\nhouse for your mom that house that you\nwant to get here in florida and i want\nyou to come back here with a print a\nprinted out picture of that house and\ncome back by the end of the day so he\ncomes back at the end of the day and he\nsays jeff this is a picture of the house\nand he shows him that house\nhe said okay perfect let's go back to\nyour desk so he goes back to his desk\nand puts on his cubicle\npins it up the picture of the house and\nso he said every time that he walked by\nhe didn't have to say hey john let's say\nthe guy's name is john hey john\nhow are you doing today how much money\nyou made today how much close you to a\nhundred thousand dollars you go up to\nhim and he'll say john\nhow much close are you to getting that\nhouse for your mom\nbecause\nthat is what would truly drive him it\nwasn't just the hundred thousand dollars\nof course that will drive people you can\nbe driven to make money but the drive is\nto find out the why behind the reason\nwhat is that money going to do for you\nfor your family for the people around\nyou you have to realize that one of the\nimportant things to do is if you're\nsearching for your why\nis maybe see that your why might not\neven be attached to you in any sort of\nway maybe your why as to why you want to\nhit your goal your why is you want to\nwhy you want to succeed or whatever it\nis that you want maybe your why has\nnothing to do with you maybe it has\nsomething to do with someone outside of\nyou and a lot of times\nwhere you really get your drive from is\nfor other people\nright so if i if you if you were to say\nhey these are my goals right now let's\nsay okay\ntell me how these goals are going to\naffect your children tell me how you\nhitting this goal is going to affect\nyour child's life tell me how you not\nhitting this goal is going to affect\nyour child's life and i'm going to fast\nforward the next year or two years with\nyou and see what it would look like if\nyou hit that goal or see what it looked\nlike if you didn't hit that goal and see\nwhat your children's life would look\nlike if you hit that goal see what your\nchildren's life will look like if you\ndidn't hit that goal\nright now you might be out there saying\nyeah that's great and all but i don't\nhave any kids okay well is there some\nway that you can figure out what your\npurpose is and attach it to someone\noutside of you if you were to make the\nmoney that you want to how would that\naffect the world how would that affect\nyour parents lives would you be able to\nbuy them a house that you want to would\nyou be able to buy them the car that you\nwant to would you be able to retire your\nparents would you be able to you know be\nfinancially secure so that no one in\nyour family ever has to worry about\nmoney again would you be happier which\nwould make everybody else happier how\ncan you take the goals that you have on\na piece of paper\nand figure out how those goals will\ndrive you\nwhat behind that goal the why will drive\nyou to go and hit it because of course\nyou can always set a goal by just saying\nhey this is my goal and you can try to\nmotivate yourself then you can wake up\nearly and listen to this podcast and\nother people's podcasts you can watch\nvideos you can read books you can get\nmentorship but ultimately what you're\nreally searching for is not the\nmotivation to do something what you're\nsearching for is the pure\ndrive and obsession of i\nwill not\nfail i'm going to get this no matter\nwhat there is no other option i'm\nburning the boats there is no plan b\nbecause it distracts from plan a this is\nwhat i'm going to do and absolutely\nnothing is going to hold me back from it\nthat's what you're searching for\nso you're going to be finding out your\ngoals then you're going to find out your\nwhy behind the goal and what you're\ngoing to try to do is if you aren't\nmotivated by the why that you find\nask yourself is there something outside\nof you\nthat you could attach it to\nis there somebody outside of you that\nyou could attach it to if you don't have\nany\nkids you don't have any close family\nmembers how would you hitting your goal\nimpact the world impact your community\nimpact the people around you what would\nyou be able to do maybe if you had\nenough money be able to donate more\nmoney donate more time help the people\naround you put more time into the food\nbanks or maybe able to donate more food\nto the food banks something there's\nalways something back there but the\ndifference is you have to find the\npurpose of what you're working towards i\nalways say\npeople hear me say it all the time and i\ncoach\ni teach coaches how to grow businesses\nand i always say you've got to find your\npurpose as to why you're a coach\nbecause you're either on self or on\npurpose on self means that you're\nthinking about yourself on purpose means\nthat you're thinking about the purpose\nas to why you're going for what you're\ngoing for\nso you might say i don't but but rob i\ndon't know what my purpose is that's the\nproblem\nif you've been listening to my podcast\nlong enough i always say this it's okay\nnot to know what your purpose is\nthat's okay\nbut it's not okay\nto not be in constant search for your\npurpose if you don't know what it is at\nthis point\nit's okay not to know what your purpose\nis but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant search for that purpose your\njob is to find your if you don't know\nwhat your purpose on earth is your job\nis to find out what your purpose is\nand it's usually right under your nose\nusually it's so obvious that you miss it\nbut if you don't know what it is here's\nwhat you do wake up every single day\nask\ngod the universe source whatever it is\nthat you do or don't believe in just say\ni want to know my purpose and say it\nevery single day today i want to find my\npurpose today i want to find my purpose\ntoday i want to find my purpose can you\nplease tell me what my purpose is say it\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain you might not find your purpose\ntomorrow you might not find your purpose\nin a week two weeks three weeks six\nmonths a year two years you might find\nit two years down the road you might\nhave to ask yourself\nfive six seven hundred times i wanna\nknow what my purpose is can you please\nshow me my purpose but if you ask\nyourself over and over and over and over\nand over again i guarantee at some point\nin time your purpose will come through\nyou will find what it is but if you're\nnot looking for it you're not going to\nfind it\nso\nmotivation is good\nbut compared to drive motivation sucks\nif you want to be pulled towards your\ngoals if you want to be pulled towards\nthe best version yourself if you want to\nbe pulled towards doing something\namazing in this world you're searching\nfor drive you're searching for something\nthat you can put all of your eggs in one\nbasket for you're searching for that\nthing that you go yep this is the reason\nwhy i'm breathing and i am willing to\ndie for that thing\nand when you find that\neverybody better get out of the way\nbecause there's absolutely no stopping\nyou when you find what that thing is so\nmotivation sucks compared to drive drive\nis what you're searching for find your\npurpose and you'll find what to be\ndriven towards\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well there\nis no other option it is either success\nor death there is no other option there\nisn't just\ndon't stop"
