    "transcript": "who wants change\nwho wants to change\nbe the change\ntoday\nwe're going to be talking about one\nsimple solution\nto fix almost all of the world's\nproblems it's quite a promise isn't it\nwell that's what we're going to dive\ninto if you uh listen to the podcast\nthis isn't going to make any sense to\nyou if you watch the podcast so if\nyou're watching after youtube or\nfacebook or instagram you've noticed\nthat i wear almost the same shirt every\nsingle time just in different colors and\nthat shirt says be the change and it\ncomes from a ghandi quote which is be\nthe change that you want to see in the\nworld and so what i did about six months\nago is i just started making shirts that\njust say be the change i thought to\nmyself if i'm gonna wear something and\npeople are gonna see me all over the\ninternet i want a shirt that actually\nrepresents the way that i think the\nworld should be in the way that actually\npeople could improve the world and so\ni'll be honest with you when i first\nheard the quote years ago\nbe the change you want to see in the\nworld i didn't if i'm being honest i\ndidn't even really understood i didn't\nreally understand what it meant like be\nthe change that you want to see in the\nworld what does that mean and if someone\nthat's enlightened like gandhi says it\nmust mean something really good and what\nit basically means it's super simple\nis that instead of trying to fix\neverybody else instead of trying to tell\npeople what they should do what we\nshould do is be the example of what we\nthink the world should be\nthat's what we should do we should be\nthe example of what we think the world\nshould be and there's there's a couple\nways to try to make people change\nthere's two ways\nand it's the the perfect example the\nanalogy of the lighthouse versus a tow\nboat\nnow if you look at what a lighthouse and\na tow boat do\nboth of them their job is to get boats\ninto the harbor safely\nbut even though that's the exact same\njob that they have to do they do it in\ntwo completely different ways and this\nis going to make sense when i get done\ntalking about it a tow boat what they do\nis they go out they get boats and they\nuse all of their energy pulling and\nforcing the boats into the harbor they\npull and they pull and they pull and\nthey pull and they use all of their\nenergy to try to get the boat into the\nharbor that's what they do\non the other side you have a lighthouse\nand a lighthouse doesn't leave its spot\nall it does is it knows its job it\nshines its light and by shining its\nlight and doing its one job it still\ngets boats into the harbor now what the\nhell does that have to do with be the\nchange well most people want the world\nto change around them they want people\naround them to change then what they do\nis they try to force everybody around\nthem to change the way that they want\nthem to\nif there's one thing that i know it's\nthat trying to change somebody is really\nfreaking hard if you don't know how hard\nit is to try to change someone else\nthink about how hard it is to change\nyourself and so a lot of people will\ncome up to me and they say rob i'm on\nthis personal development kick and i'm\non this journey and i love it and it's\nnew to me but how do i get my wife to\nstart listening to podcasts how do i get\nmy husband to start meditating how do i\nget my\nkids to start doing this how do i get\nthe rest of the world or everyone that's\naround me to start reading books or\ngetting into personal development and\nthey try to force everybody in their\nimmediate circle to grow\nand if you want to force somebody to do\nsomething you're going to get a whole\nlot of resistance what's the best and\nthat's that is the exact way that a\ntowboat works they try to pull\nthe boats into the harbor\nversus a lighthouse what does the\nlighthouse do it does its job it works\non itself and it shines its light for\nall of the boats to see and still gets\nthem into the harbor so\nwith with\nthe quote itself\nthe the\nreal connection that i have to it\nthere's a meme that i love that i've\ntalked about it's just a picture and\nit's a cartoon and it's a guy who's up\non top of a pedestal he looks like he's\na politician or something like that and\nthere's a bunch of people in the crowd\nand he says who wants to cha or who\nwants change\nand you see everybody in their hands in\nthe air you know everybody wants change\nand then the next picture it says who\nwants to change and everybody's hands\nare down and nobody wants to change we\nall want change in the world if you see\nall the stuff that's happening in the\nworld right now\nthere's a massive amount of change\nthat's happening and people wanting\nchange that happen which is a beautiful\nthing we should always want change we\nshould always want to be better to treat\npeople to better have equality across\nthe world we should all want change and\nfor things to always be getting better\nbut we have to realize we have to be the\npeople to initiate that change\nwe have to be the people that are ob\nthat are okay with being that change the\nproblem right now is that everybody\nwants change which once again is good\nbut nobody wants to change it's very\neasy to just tell someone to do\nsomething it's very easy to just tell\nthem to change but not change yourself\nchange doesn't happen at a worldwide\nlevel very easily\njust doesn't it takes time change\ndoesn't happen at a nationwide level\nvery easily that takes a lot of time\nchange doesn't happen at a government\nlevel very easily that takes a lot of\ntime state changes happen at a statewide\nlevel very easily that takes a lot of\ntime and change doesn't happen at a\nlocal level very easily it takes a lot\nof time\nthe easiest place to change\nis to start to change yourself and so if\nyou're saying i want this in the world\nthe first thing that you need to do is\nyou need to hold a mirror up to yourself\nand say am i being the perfect portrait\nof this that i want to see of this\nchange that i want to see in the world\nand i know it's hard to change yourself\nbut you have to be the person to change\nyou have to be the person to eat your\nown dog food if you're telling people to\ndo something you\ndamn for sure better be the person\nthat's actually doing it eating your own\ndog food i can't tell you how many times\nit's at least almost every single post i\nput up on instagram i put up a quote or\ni put up a post and somebody always says\neasier said than done of course it is\neverything is easier said than done\nbecause it is easy to move your lips\nthat's you don't even have to get off\nthe couch to move your lips i don't have\nto get out of my chair right now to move\nmy lips so of course it's easier said\nthan done the hard thing is to actually\ndo it and so you have to be willing to\neat your own dog food\ntoo many people are just sharing posts\nand thinking that they're going to\nchange the world you're not going to\nchange the world by just sharing posts\non instagram sharing posts on facebook\nare they important sure of course but\nwhat we really need to do is we need to\nbe the lighthouse\nwe need to be out there making change\nhappen and changing ourselves and\ninspiring others to change as well\nexactly the same way that the lighthouse\nwould be so you know how can you be\nwilling for someone to change themself\nto change their perspective to change\nthe way that they were raised if you're\nnot willing to change yourself first\nreally how can you actually expect that\nyou have to be the first to eat your own\ndog food you have to be the first one in\nthe speed of the leader is the speed of\nthe team\nif you want things to happen you need to\nlead people and inspire people to change\nthemselves\nit's easy to say something it's hard to\nget off and actually start doing\nsomething like\none of the examples that i love is if\nyou follow me on instagram\nyou probably saw a few days ago it\nsnowed for you know the second time in\neight years since i've been in austin\nit's snowed here it's not about three\ninches of snow\nand so i literally put up a post of all\nthe snow coming down on instagram and\nsaid instagram stories and i said should\ni jump in the pool it was like 88 said\nyes and i was already gonna jump the\npool but\ni jumped in the pool\nwhy not because i'm trying to show off\nand be like oh my god look at me i'm so\ncool i'm instead of cold water it's\nbecause i know\nthat that\nconquering that little voice inside of\nyour head is important and how do you\nconquer that little voice inside your\nhead one of the easiest ways is to to go\nin the cold the cold will bring out a\nlot of you\nit'll show you it'll bring to your\nsurface all of the little voices that\nare holding you back from who you want\nto be\nand so what did i do i jumped in the\npool and i had a couple pictures of me\ninside of the pool and i had the picture\nthe screenshot of me being in it for\nnine minutes i didn't do it because i\nwant to be cool i did it because i\nwanted to inspire others to do it as\nwell\nwhat's really awesome about it is how\nmany messages it was about 40 or 50\nmessages of people saying you just\ninspired me to take a cold shower i just\ntook one it was really hard but it was\namazing and people talk about how it\ninspired them\nbut i can't just put up a picture of\nsomebody else in cold water\nand just expect that everyone's going to\njump in cold water i have to realize\nthat if i'm going to be a leader with\nanything that i do i have to be the one\nwilling to do it first because the speed\nof the leader is the speed of the team\nif you have a team that's not performing\nthe way that you want it to you have to\nlook at yourself in the mirror and say\nhow am i not showing up it's never your\nteam's fault it's always your fault and\nwhen you can put it back on you and say\nhow can i change if my community is not\nwhat i want it to be i need to ask\nmyself how can i be better how can i\ninspire more people not try to force\nthem but how can i inspire them to be\nbetter\none of the things i said in the\nbeginning is that so many people reach\nout and like hey i want to change my\nspouse i want my spouse to get into this\nyou know and i'll hear something like oh\nmy spouse is really my wife is really\nanxious she worries a lot she's really\nanxious she gets emotional with all the\nstuff that's happening in the world how\ndo i get her to start meditating\ni can't tell you how often i see\nsomething like this how do i get my\nhusband to start meditating how do i get\nmy wife to start meditating they have\nanxious thoughts and feelings and i\nreally think that it would help them to\nmeditate my response to them\nis you need to meditate\nthey need to see you meditating you\ndon't force it on to them first what you\ndo is you take ownership and say okay if\ni want to see this person meditate i\nthink it will help them\nthen i want to be the first person to\nmeditate and i want to go out and\nmeditate and i don't need to to flaunt\nmy meditativeness in front of them but\nwhat i need to do is actually just go\nand meditate and if they see me\nmeditating or if they know that i did\nand i go and meditate for 20 minutes and\nthey start to notice man\nhe's a lot more calm he's a lot more\npeaceful\nthey start to notice a dissonance\nbetween how calm you are and how anxious\nthey are\nand essentially what's gonna happen\neventually it might not be a first week\nthe first month the first five months\nthey're going to notice the difference\nbetween you and them and they're going\nto go honey\ni've been really anxious lately a lot of\nthe stuff that's happening in the world\nis really getting me down\nyou seem to be really laid back what are\nyou doing and what happens they see you\nbeing the change that they want in\nthemselves\nso they reach out to you for advice they\nask you what you've been doing and now\nyou have an opportunity to help them\nchange how do you make sure that you\ndon't help someone train change try to\nforce change onto them\npeople don't like to change people do\nnot like to be told what to do you want\na perfect example of it do two-year-olds\nlike to be told what to do\nno of course not it's ingrained in\nhumans to not like to be told what to do\nwe like to have our own sovereignty we\nlike to be an individual we like to be\nindependent so if you try to tell your\nspouse that they need to meditate\nbecause they're too freaking anxious\nthey're going to resist meditating but\nif they see you\nwith the change internally of more joy\nof more peace of more calm\nthen they're probably going to reach out\nto you at some point in time and say\nhoney\ni'm really starting to stress out\ni'm really not feeling good with all the\nstuff that's happening in the world and\ni need to calm down you need to stop\nworrying you need to stop being so\nanxious and sad and emotional about this\nyou seem to be handling your life and\neverything really well what are you\ndoing\nnow you can go well\nwhat's really been helping me is\nmeditating\nand now instead of you forcing it upon\nthem they are asking\nfor it from you\nit's a perfect example so many times i\nhear people when they're like oh you\nknow\nmy uh i'm really afraid to go out and\nand do this and be a coach or put up\nmotivational videos or inspirational\nvideos on facebook and instagram because\ni'm worried what everyone's going to say\nabout me\nwell what happens is at the moment that\nyou start changing people will start to\nresist it\nbut then what happens is people look at\nyou and they say man he's been doing so\nwell she's been doing so well maybe i\nshould reach out to them and see what's\ngoing on maybe i should reach out to\nthem like they\npeople will change when there's a part\nof you\nthat inspires them to want to be like\nyou\nnot when you force it upon them but when\nthey go i want to see what they have\nthey seem to be living a life that i\nlove\ni would i would love to feel that\npeaceful i love to feel that joy i love\nto make the money that they're making\nwhatever it is that you have\nand then what happens is they reach out\nto you\nbut they don't reach out to you unless\nyou are first embodying that change\nso what change do you want to see in the\nworld and how can you embody that change\nhow can you become that how can you be\nthe change that you want to see in the\nworld\nthat's the question i have for you\nno one likes to be told what to do\neverybody always wants to think that\nwhat they're doing is their own idea\ndo you want to know the best way to do\nthat is to be so inspiring to live your\nlife at such a high level to shine your\nlight so bright that nobody can look\naway from it and then what happens\npeople start reaching out to you and\nasking how to do it people start saying\nman that's really inspiring man that's\nreally great hey what are you doing can\ni get some help can i get some tips can\ni get some advice\nit's funny how many people literally\ntoday if i'm gonna be honest with you\ntoday i got a message from a friend that\ni've known since 2006\nand he was semi-supportive when i\ndecided to start the podcast\nbut a little bit skeptical kind of made\nfun of me like a friend does and i was\nlike you know what that's just what's\ngonna happen i'm okay with that people\nare going to resist the change\nsend me a message today about 20 minutes\nago and it said you interviewed matthew\nmcconaughey holy sh that's so amazing i\nnever thought that you would be where\nyou are at this point and it shows me\nwhat hard work gets you right that\ninspired him to maybe go do something\ndifferent in his life to actually follow\nsomething so was the resistance when i\nfirst went and started the podcast and\nstarted putting motivational videos and\nstarted to do this of course\nbut my job is not to try to prove\nanybody wrong my job is not to live the\nlife that somebody else wants me to live\nmy my job is to live the life that makes\nme feel like it's 100 right for me and\nif that inspires some people there's a\nlot of people that won't inspire and\nthat's okay i don't need to inspire\neverybody but if it does connect with\nthem that inspires other people to live\na better life i never want to tell you\nwhat to do\ni want to show you what i'm doing that's\nhelped me\nand then i want to inspire some people\nto do the same thing that's really what\nit is i never preach something on the\npodcast that i've never done myself\nbefore i want to use myself as a guinea\npig first i want to show you that i'm\ngoing to be the first one to do it and i\nwill put myself through the ringer to\nsee if it works and if it does i will\nbring it up to you so that you know and\nif you follow me on instagram i'm going\nto show you i'm jumping the cold pool\nwhy because i'm telling you to jump into\ncold pools i'm telling you to take cold\nshowers i'm never going to tell you to\ndo something that you don't want to do\nbut hopefully by seeing that you go you\nknow what i'm inspired i want to do that\nas well\nthat's what you want other people to\nthink so what i want you to think about\nis this number one how do you want the\nworld to change the world is not perfect\nit's far from perfect\nit's getting better things are happening\nthe the old\nmechanisms that kept the world together\nand governments running are starting to\ncome apart and starting to come to the\nsurface into the light so now we can\nchange those things which is great but\nif i were to ask you how do you want the\nworld to change write down the answers\nhow do you want the world to change\nwhat would you like to see in the world\nright that's the first thing number two\nwhat are the biggest changes that you\nwould like to see\nwhat are the biggest change how do you\nwant it to to change and then what are\nthe biggest changes that you would like\nto see\nand then number three how can you embody\nthat change\nso you figure out what change you want\nand then you find out how can i\npersonally embody the change that i want\nto see not force it upon someone else\nbut how can i embody it to the highest\nlevel\nso that it will inspire other people to\nact the same as me\nso how can i embody\nthat change and inspire others to be\nthat way as well because ultimately you\ncan't force anybody to do anything\nif you don't know how hard it is to\nchange somebody else think about how\nhard you should change yourself it's\nreally freaking hard\nright so it's near impossible to change\nsomebody else do you want to know how to\nchange somebody else though is to be so\nto live your life at such a high level\nthat ins it inspires other people to go\ni want that i want that happiness i want\nthat peace i want that joy i want that\nmoney i want the success whatever it is\nthat you have\nthat you inspire people to do the same\nas well because ultimately the only way\nfor the world to change is if we\nbe the change that we want to see in the\nworld\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well who are you\nand who do you want to become is it the\nperson that you've always been is that\nwho you are or do you want to step into\na new version of yourself you can make\nthat decision right now"
