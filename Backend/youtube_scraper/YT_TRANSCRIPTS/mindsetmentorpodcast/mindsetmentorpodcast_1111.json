    "transcript": "i want you to think about the things\nthat are making you anxious and ask\nyourself this question do i have any\ncontrol over those things\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nanxiety and we're going to be talking\nspecifically about covet anxiety\nwe're gonna be talking about something\nthat i should have probably talked about\nquite a long time ago but uh i talked\nquite a bit about anxiety and all of\nthose things in march and april and as\nthings were going on and then i had a\nconversation with a friend uh about\ncovet about all the things that are\nhappening and i'm not going to give you\nmy world perspective because who needs\nto hear another opinion in this world so\ni'm not going to give you any opinions\non anything but what i will tell you is\nhow i know how to work through anxiety\nhow i've helped myself get through\nanxiety have my friends help get through\nanxiety have had clients get through\nanxiety and stress and depression all\nthose and there's a lot of heavy [ __ ]\nthat's happening in the world we can\nadmit it and first off we probably need\nto admit it like this has been for most\npeople a heavy year uh it has been a lot\nof unknown things that we did not see\ncoming up that have come up right and\nyou can feel really heavy if you are a\nperson that's very kinesthetic you can\nfeel\nlost if you're a person's very head and\nanalytical type of person\nyou might just be ready for this [ __ ] to\nbe over i'm actually pretty sure that\neverybody who's listening to this is\nready for this to be over but at this\npoint in time it's not\nit just isn't and so what comes down to\nis us accepting that and i'm here to\ntell you everybody\nit'll be all right it will eventually\nwork itself out\nand the quicker that we just accept that\nit is the way that it is right now\nand that it will eventually be all right\nthat i think the easier it'll make our\nlives until it gets to at least some\nfeeling of normalcy and i'm going to try\nto help you feel better and i was having\na conversation with a friend of mine and\nwe were talking about covid and the fact\nthat she's going home to her parents\nfor christmas and she has a lot of\nanxiety around possibly bringing kovid\nhome to her parents for the holidays\nwhich is the worst [ __ ] christmas\ngift you could give your parents but\nshe's afraid of giving that to her\nparents uh going home for the holidays\ncompletely understandable makes a whole\nlot of sense and she was talking about\nthat but more than anything else what\nshe was really anxious about is the fact\nthat kovit is still around the fact that\nwe're still dealing with this thing what\nare we nine months into it and she was\njust talking about how she was anxious\nand stressed because of that\nthen the conversation went a little bit\nfurther and she was talking about you\nknow the other thing that scares me a\nlot as well is the economy like i don't\nknow what's going to happen with the\neconomy with all of the inflation that's\ngoing on with you know about 20 percent\nof the world's money or the us's money\nwas just printed this year you know and\njust what's going to happen with the\neconomy and then she went into rolling\ninto how she's also having these anxious\nthoughts around getting these test\nresults that she's waiting for her dog\nand you know the dog the the\nthe issues that's happening with her dog\nand the fact that her dog might have\ncancer and she's just at this point in\ntime it's a waiting game for all of them\nright so it's a waiting game for the\ntest results for the dog it's a waiting\ngame for uh seeing eventually if kovid's\never going to pass or what's going to\nhappen with our lives next and it's a\nwaiting game to see what's going to\nhappen with the economy\nand i let her go through and talk about\nit and talk about it\nand then what happened was i mentioned\nto her\nthat the things that she's having all of\nthis stress and anxiety around she has\nabsolutely no control over and that's\nwhat's giving her stress and anxiety\nright so she has no control over what's\ngoing on in covin she has zero control\nover that she also has zero control over\nthe economy and she also has zero\ncontrol over test results from blood\nwork that was done a few days ago for\nher dog zero control over all three of\nthose things now before i go any further\ni want you to think about the things\nthat are making you anxious and ask\nyourself this question do i have any\ncontrol over those things all of the\nthings that are bringing you worry and\nfear and anxious thoughts do you have\nany control over them or\ndo you have those anxious thoughts and\nfeelings around them simply because of\nthe fact that you have no control over\nthem and you want to have control but\nyou don't\nso your anxious thoughts could be coming\nfrom the fact that you want to have\ncontrol over something that you\nabsolutely will never have control over\nand you haven't just fully accepted that\nlack of control because of those things\nthree things that i mentioned to you\nabout my friend\nnone of them literally none of them she\ncan't control she cannot do anything\nabout those\nand it's not that those things don't\nexist they all exist it's that she's\nfighting them in her mind and that is\nbringing in the anxiety\nso what are you fighting\nare you fighting things\nand the other thing that she's not doing\nis she's not accepting she's not\naccepting that they exist they are here\nthey are the way that they are she's\njust not accepting them she is resisting\nthe way that the world currently is\nright now\nright that's what at its simplest form\nshe is resisting the way that the world\ncurrently is she's resisting the covet\nshe's resisting the economy she's\nresisting the dog's test results she's\njust resisting and this is not uncommon\nuh that i was reading an article the\nother day it says depression has gone up\nfour times four hundred percent from the\nexact same time last year\nand i think a lot of the reason why is\nbecause people are feeling all of these\nanxious thoughts and at the same time\nthey're they're not accepting the way\nthat the world is and they're\nthey're not allowing themselves to learn\nand grow and get better in these times\nand be able to work through it because\nthey just so badly want the world to go\nback to quote unquote normal whatever\nbit of normalcy that they can have again\nand if you've listened to my podcast\nbefore you've heard me say this your\nlevel of stress anxiety worry and fear\nand depression\nunless you're clinically depressed\nthere's a completely different that's a\nwhole other episode that we could do but\nyour level of worry anxiety sadness fear\nall of those things anxiety all that\nyour level of it will be in direct\nproportion to how much you're resisting\nthe way that the world is so if you're\nextremely anxious right now i guarantee\nyou are extremely resisting the way that\nthe world is you're extremely resisting\nsomething that is out there in the world\nright if you're having low levels of\nanxiety just a little bit maybe it's\njust bubbling under the surface which i\nfeel is for most people how it usually\nworks it's not that it's full-blown\nanxiety attacks it's just it's just a\nlittle bit of anxiety that's bubbling\nunder the surface all day every day and\nthe reason why is probably because you\nhave a low level of resisting the way\nthat the world is you're wishing\nall right well yeah you know it is this\nway but\ni just wish it would go back to normal\ni'm just so i just want to go back to\nwork i want to see my friends again i\nwant to be able to hug my mom\nand it's not that it's a full-blown\npanic attack for you might just be that\nyou're just resisting versus full\nacceptance you know there's a shaman\nthat i've worked with in the past and\ndone psychedelics with and he says just\nsurrender harder right just surrender\nharder that's what we all kind of need\nto do right now and actually what we\nneed to do probably for the rest of our\nlives is just surrender harder i'm not\nsaying surrender to the powers to be if\nyou think that the you know the economy\nand the cove and all that stuff is being\nput on by some masterminds behind the\nscenes i'm not saying surrender those\ni'm saying surrender the fact that it is\nthe way that the world is right now and\nat this moment there's nothing that i\nknow of that we can do about it so do i\nwant covet to exist anymore no hell no\nof course i don't but what can i do\nabout it\nwhat can i personally do about covid\nright\ni'm just a college dropout i don't know\nabout covet i don't know i think about\nall that science and stuff\ni can barely formulate words sometimes\nhow am i going to save the world from\ncovid i'm not so do i want it to be here\nno but\nit is here and i've got to figure out a\nway just to accept that\nand uh you can either resist\nor you can accept those are the two\nthings that you can really do yeah it is\nthe way that it is\nit's not what i would have chosen but it\nis the way that it is and what you have\nto realize is that's completely my\ndecision and you\ncan resist or you can accept and that is\ncompletely your decision as well it's\nfully 100 up to you and what you have to\nrealize is that the more that you're\nresisting\nthe more that you're stealing away your\njoy in the present moment your joy is\nbeing stolen from you in this present\nmoment because of your resistance\nyour joy your happiness your peace in\nthis moment is being stolen from you\nbecause you won't just fully accept that\nhey the world is the way that it is\nright if somebody breaks up with you\nyour joy\nis stolen from you if you're resisting\nand going god i just wish that we would\nbe back together again and you're\nthinking about how the past used to be\nand you're thinking about your love and\nall of the times that you hung out and\nwatched netflix and chilled and had all\nthose great moments you're like god i\njust want it to be that way again but\nit's not and guess what the more that\nyou're resisting the fact that it is in\nthe way that you want it to be\nobviously the more that it's going to be\nholding you back the more anxiety and\nstress and worry and fear you're going\nto be having around that thing\nand you have to realize if your joy is\nbeing stolen from you in the present\nmoment your life is just a collection of\npresent moments that's all that it is\nthere is no past and there is no future\neverything that has happened to you and\nwill ever happen to you in your entire\nlife is in the present moment nothing\nhas happened to you in the past the past\nis just a present moment that has passed\nright nothing has happened to you in the\nfuture yet but when that future thing\ndoes happen that will be a present\nmoment and so if we're really serious\nabout this and trying to make ourselves\nfeel better we need to be very aware\nthat our entire life is just the present\nmoment the only thing that that does\nexist and will ever exist for us is the\npresent moment and if we're resisting\ncovet if we're resisting the economy if\nwe're resisting a breakup if we're\nresisting test results all of those\nthings we're resisting it and having our\njoy stolen from us in this moment when\nwe fully can experience the love and the\njoy and the happiness and the peace that\nwe truly want to if we were to just step\ninto it and accept stop resisting and go\nwhat is great about this moment right\nnow\nand just allowing ourselves to sink into\nthe present moment more than anything\nelse\nand the perfect question asks yourself\nand this is what i asked my friend\ni said okay now that we've gone through\nall these things i got a question for\nyou the question is are you okay right\nnow\nshe's like what do you mean i was like\nin this moment in this very second\nare you okay\nand she's like well yeah i mean i'm good\nyou know i've got this coming up and\nthis i was like no no no i don't care\nabout bills i don't care about anything\nthat's happening in the future i don't\ncare about any of that\nin this very second\nare you safe\nand are you okay\nshe's like yes and i was like\nnow just think about that thought just\njust marinate on that thought how does\nit make you feel like it makes me feel a\nlot better and the reason why is because\nall of the stress and anxiety that we\nhave is all for things that could\npossibly be happening in the future and\nwe make up all of these ghosts and\ndemons into the future that could\npossibly exist but in reality it's never\nabout those things it's always about\nthis present moment right now so if you\nfeel anxious thoughts if you feel like\nthere's something wrong i want you to\nask yourself in this moment right now am\ni okay\nnot oh my god i have pills i have to pay\ntomorrow or later on at five o'clock i\nhave to make sure i'm at this\nappointment no right now in this [ __ ]\nmoment this very second are you okay\nand the answer is yes can you sink into\nthat feeling of being okay don't sink\ninto the feeling of the anxiety of the\npossible things that could happen in\nyour future can you sink into the\nfeeling of being just fine right now in\nthis present moment feel the feelings of\nwhat it feels like to be fine in this\nmoment\nare you okay you are\nokay i feel better i feel at least a\nlittle bit better\nand if i can continue to notice when i\nfeel anxious thoughts and start to\nre-pattern myself to go am i okay right\nnow in this moment yes i am okay am i\nokay right\n99.999 of the time you're okay right now\nin this present moment and there's\nnothing to be worrying about or anxiety\nthat you should have but you're bringing\nit up and forcing on to yourself right\nso\nif you have anxieties of anxiety or\nstress or fear or worry that you've been\nfeeling my question to you is this\nwhat are you resisting\nif you're anxious if you're worrying if\nyou're fearful if you're feeling those\nnegative emotions come up what are you\nresisting\nthink about that for a second what is it\nwhat is it that you're\nresisting is it a breakup are you not\naccepting the breakup wanting it the way\nthe world to go back to the way that it\nused to be the fact that you're not\nperson's not in love with you anymore\nwhat is it that you're resisting\nand the question is are you okay right\nnow are you okay\nand the other thing we have to do is we\nhave to accept and that we can control\nalmost nothing\nlike we literally can almost control\nnothing\nlike literally you can barely control\nyour own bowels after taco tuesday like\nyou can literally control almost like\nyou can't control other people you can't\ncontrol your children very well you\ncan't control the weather we can barely\ncontrol our own thoughts most of the\ntime we can't\nwe can control almost nothing and this\nis\nme telling you this as a recovering\ncontrolaholic where i realized on one of\nmy very first psychedelic journey that i\ndid that i was a control freak i had\ncontrol issues and that was causing all\nof my stress and my worry and my anxiety\nmy life and the past three years three\nand a half years since i've done it have\nbeen a complete unraveling of just\nletting go of all the control and\nnoticing it when it comes up and\nrealizing that the more that i let go of\ncontrol and the more the less i try to\ncontrol everything the more amazing my\nlife becomes\nand so we can't control our first\nthoughts\nbut you can always control your second\nthought and so even if the first thought\ncomes up is an anxious thought well then\nnotice it identify it and then go is\nthat the thought that i want no it's not\nokay what is a better thought that i\nwant to replace it with and replace that\nthought with a new thought you can't\ncontrol your second or you can't control\nyour first stop you can always control\nyour second thought\nand if you change your first thought\nenough to whatever this second thought\nis\nenough over and over and over and over\nand over again you eventually re-pattern\nyour brain in your thoughts in your\nsecond thought will eventually start to\nbecome your first thought if you're\nnaturally a negative person identify\nthat negativity and replace it with\npositivity and if you do this over and\nover and over and over and over again\nall day every day hundreds of times\nevery day depending how much negativity\npops up in a year two years three years\nfive years you'll notice that your new\npreferred thoughts are positive and not\nnegative anymore we can re-pattern our\nbrain by noticing it and by taking\ncontrol of it you can't control your\nfirst thought but you can always control\nyour second thought and then what do you\ndo\nit's very simple right now am i okay\nin this moment it's very second i am\nokay\nokay\ngood number two accept\naccept stop resisting the world is the\nway that it is\nthe more that i resist the worse i'm\ngoing to feel so if i can just accept\ni'm going to feel better and number\nthree ask yourself this question this is\nsomething that i had\ni was feeling a lot of it's probably\nabout five years ago i got off a plane\nand flew into austin\nand uh\nand it was like i came from florida and\nflorida was hot it was amazing and i was\non the beach i flew back in austin and\nit was like\n19 degrees\nand just like it wasn't even snowing it\nwas like that really frozen rain and it\nwas cold and it was hailing and it was\njust a crap day outside and i got off\nthe plane and i was like ugh gross this\nis disgusting i'm waiting for my uber to\ncome pick me up and it's like the wind\nis just like howling it's like 30 miles\nan hour it's cold\ni came from amazing beautiful florida to\ncold rainy windy wet austin\nand i started to notice\nmy feelings change towards being in\naustin at that moment i didn't feel good\ni was like damn why didn't i just stand\ni started to get really kind of\nanxious about why didn't i just stand\nforward i could have stayed in florida\nfor an extra week whatever it was\nand then i made myself reframe\nwhat was going on and i asked myself\nthis question that's the question i have\nfor you is what's beautiful about this\nmoment\nand i forced myself to answer what was\nbeautiful about this moment and so i\nlooked around and i started noticing\ndifferent things that i could feel\nthey're beautiful oh my gosh i have my\nhealth i have you know people who love\nme in my life i have you know a business\nthat i love running i have things that i\nlove doing i have you know a time\ntomorrow to go work out with one of my\nbest friends and i started noticing\nwhat's beautiful about the moment and by\nnoticing that thing that i felt was\nbeautiful i was actually starting to\nunravel all of the feelings of anxiety\nand stress that i had about coming back\nin to the way that it is in the cold and\nthe rain and the sleet the snow and all\nof the crap that we had that day\nand so i think i want you to do is\nnumber number one ask yourself am i okay\nnumber two accept it and number three\nask yourself this this one question\nwhat is beautiful about this moment and\nreframe your thoughts in the current\nmoment the current present that's being\nstolen from you and reframe it to\nfinding what's beautiful in your life\nand what's beautiful in this present\nmoment\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as
