    "transcript": "when faced with the inevitable get\nrelative\nstay resilient don't be defeated as\nquickly don't quit\n[Music]\nwelcome everybody to the mindset mentor\npodcast i'm your host rob dial and i'm\nexcited to be joined with mr matthew\nmcconaughey here and uh i've got to tell\nyou a story real quick before we dive in\ni think you'd appreciate so\nwhen i was about 10 years old\nmy mom was always working she worked\nthree jobs because my father was you\nknow they they got separated my sister's\nabout six years older than me she was in\nher like\ntroubled years i guess you could say\ninto partying into drugs and all that\nstuff and uh when they would leave\ni wanted to get in and you know see what\nit's like to be older so my mom and my\nsister would leave my sister had uh this\nbig huge stuffed bunny and behind the\nstuffed bunny was two things\nnumber one was uh doggy style by snoop\ndogg and i used to listen to that when i\nwas like 9 or 10 years old number two\nwas dazed and confused\nand i think daisy confused is part of\nthe reason\nnot the whole reason surfing helped but\npart of the reason why i got into\npartying and drugs as much because i was\nlike this looks like so much fun like\nthis seems like a great life like i want\nto see what this is all about and so i\nwant to uh tell you first off i\nappreciate that because that was how'd\nit go\nwell it's good now it was it was kind of\ncrazy for a little while it was\neverything's great\nyeah it was it was real good so\num for those of you guys that don't know\nmatthew just had a book come out that's\nincredible and i'm gonna i won't even\nblow smoke i'll just tell you it's one\nof my favorite books ever\nmy girlfriend and i got it the audiobook\nis is incredible that's what people have\nto listen to because it's your voice and\nyou telling the stories and we listened\nto it uh on our drive back if we spent a\nmonth in sedona we were on our way back\nand we listened to it and by the end i\nwas like [ __ ] i wish this was longer\nlike i want it to keep going like i want\ni want green lights part two because all\nof the other stories that weren't put in\nin 35 years\nand so uh and so for for people don't\nknow it's it's literally you started\njournaling which i love journaling and\ntell people they should journal all the\ntime at 15 years old and so it's 35\nyears of you going back and looking\nthrough your 35 years of journaling and\njust kind of pulling out life stories\nand wins and losses and how it\nculminated to get you into the position\nthat you're in right now and i can't\nrecommend it enough i thought it was\nincredible\nah thank you thank you thank you thank\nyou\nyeah and um you know the very first\nquestion the thing that i love is in the\nbeginning in the entry you say well you\nknow i've been through heartbreaks i've\nbroken my hearts and you go through all\nthese different things you've done and\nthen the very first thing you say is\nso the question i the first question you\nprobably have is what is a green light\nwhich is the title of the book and\nthat's not my first question the first\nquestion that i had is\ncan you dive deeper into the story of\nyou doing peyote in mexico in a cage\nwith a mountain lion because that's what\ni that's what i really was hoping that\nyou'd dive into when you missed it in\nthe book you mentioned it and he never\ncame back around to it just mentioned it\nyeah so\num i'm in um\nreal day katorsee\nand\ni had some time off and i had met this\nshaman\nand\nnever done peyote before but i read\nenough on it and uh talked to enough\npeople who had and understood that it's\nnot something to flippantly do it's not\nsomething you do on saturday night and\nhead out on the town no no it's uh you\nknow it's more of a spiritual adventure\nand i've met the shaman and we talked we\ntalked about it and i've gotten to know\nhim a little bit\nand i started talking about about that\nhey what's the safe way you know uh\nspiritual way to do peyote he goes\ni'll meet you here uh at 4 30 in the\nmorning tomorrow morning\nand i show up it's dark\nand\nwe're not hardly saying a word we he he\nsays bring your hiking shoes\nwe start hiking\num and just as uh the sun starts coming\nup he stops and we'd walk about a mile\nup this hill and he\nyou know delivers a little small\nbite with his pale dude small bite\nsmaller\nand we just keep walking doesn't say a\nword\nabout another mile up now we're starting\nto break a sweat\nsun's up another one\nanother mile up\nanother one\nby the time we reached the top the peak\nwe've gotten to the top of this\nbeautiful mountain the highest mountain\nthat was around there\nand just quietly sat there and listened\nto uh uh everything that's going on i\nremember being uh this was this is real\nthis was not a\nfictitious memory there was from the top\nof this mountain there were all these\nlike sunflowers and there were thousands\nof bees and the hum of the bees\nwas a baseline because obviously with\nwith peyote your senses um\nget tuned in\nmore so than they are\nunder normal circumstances\num and we sat up there for about uh two\nhours didn't really say much of a word\nat all just sat there thought meditated\nprayed\non my own and then we walked slowly back\ndown\nand we got down\nthis is probably six seven hours later\nafter we left that morning\nand he and i saw this this uh this cage\ni said cage i mean it was more like a\nhabitat it was it was huge it was\nprobably 10 feet\ntall\n20 feet by\n30 feet and inside that was this\nmountain lion um\nand i kind of\nyou know was was on the frequency of\nmother nature\nand i nestled up next to the cage and\nstarted sort of getting on the frequency\nof this so said mountain lion\nand uh his mountain lion's pacing turned\ninto when he was a little bit disturbed\nat first\nturned and he slowly moved towards me as\nanimals were doing they get more\ncomfortable and came up to the gate\nand uh\ninstead of being aggressive he sort of\nlicked my hand at the gate\nthrough the fencing so\ni slowly moved to the entrance\nopened it up\nslowly slid in\nhe began to pace again\nbut i moved very very slowly his pacing\nwas not agitated as far as i could tell\ni moved to the opposite side of the uh\nhabitat\nand slowly sat down\nand his pacing as animals do slowly\nmoved a little bit closer to me but was\nnot agitated\nand about\nan hour and a half after i'd sat down\nhe made his way up to\nme about three feet away\nand cut to\ntwo hours later\nthat mountain lion's head was in my lap\nand he was purring oh my god\n[Laughter]\nnow\nwhat's the asterisk what's the uh you\nknow the the the do not try this at home\nhere's the do not part\nthe the\nit was it was a mountain lion and that's\na wild animal absolutely but it was it\nwas fed\nso meaning i've learned that like in the\nafrican trips when i've crossed rivers\nwith with crocodiles and such and you\ndon't want to do that in the dry season\nwhen the animals are hungry and\ndesperate in the wet season when they're\nmore well fed by the by the food chain\nyou have better chances so\nthat's the uh\nthe longer detailed version of that\nstory i love it and i do want to talk\nabout africa because it sounds you had\nsome some stories from there that were\nincredible in the book um but one of the\nthings that you say in the very\nbeginning\nthat i really love\nis\nyou say i have proof that the world is\nconspiring to make me happy\nand i always preach to people that\nthere's two ways to look at life number\none is that you can look at it as if\nlife is happening to me and you're just\nthrown a bunch of circumstances and you\nhave to wake up and try to move around\nthem every single day number two is you\ncan look at is if this is happening for\nme whether it's good or bad it's\nhappening for my own natural progression\nin life so\nso could you dive a little bit more into\nhow you view\nlife good or bad and as it's conspiring\nto actually make you happy\nyeah well you just said it i mean\nit's more than it's more it's not\nfoolish optimism it's not hey the glass\nhas full hey eliminated out of lemons\nit's not that right i'm not i'm not\nreally for that hallmark card stuff\num it's actually more survival\num\nand you know i write very early on one\nof the tools that that has come to me is\nwhen faced with the inevitable get\nrelative\nthere seems to be the art uh of how do\nwe see things for us\nwell as soon as something's inevitable\neven if it's a crisis\nwhat's more constructive\nto\nlet it\n[ __ ] you\nor to go okay i can't do anything about\nthis and i don't like it so how do i\nmake this for me how do i think eastern\ni'm going to use this momentum\nyou know i'm um\nsometimes you can get by that by\nout enduring it you know people right\nnow in kobe time some people will get a\nhead through in this time because they\nkept their damn head above water\nthey survived they didn't thrive but a\nlot of times you get through it by\npivoting and saying you know what\ni'm going to look at this situation\ndifferently than i have\nbefore because\nmaybe the way i'm looking at it now\nit's not feeding me it's not\nconstructive i i'm banging my head into\nthe proverbial wall every day again and\nagain and again and there's nothing i\ncan do about the situation right so\nmaybe i need to say back up and go well\nmaybe i need to look at the situation\ndifferently or reapproach it\nand sometimes when we find out if we\nreapproach it from a different angle or\nperspective\nwe find a little spot and we kind of\ndance by it for the first time you're\nlike ah the way past this was right\nthere but i didn't notice it because i\nwas just banging my head into the\nproblem\nor denying the problem\nthat's another thing you know i have\nthat line later in the book once you\nknow it's black it's not near as dark\na lot of times we we are at least repeat\noffenders in crisis in our life because\nwe don't give the crisis credit and we\ndon't look at the eye and we got it'll\nbe gone it'll be gone it'll be gone we\nhave all those things oh i'll start that\ntomorrow i'll start that tomorrow we\nprocrastinate or whatever but boy if you\nlook at christ in the eye and go oh this\nis a real one\ni want to deal with this and i and and\nsay it's black it's dark well once we do\nthat it's actually not as dark\nas we initially thought it's like when\nyou wake up in the middle of the night\nwhen it's dark you walk you can't see\nanything but your eyes slowly change\nfocus and you start to pick up shadows\nand images and you can see better once\nyour eyes adjust it helps you get your\neyes adjusted if you admit something is\nactually dark it's it's black\num so that's that's another way um\nbut then it becomes\ni mean at the very least once you facing\nthat\ninevitable hardship\nor life is not dealing you\nwhat you hoped it would deal you\ni mean\nto look at it another way\nwell the alternative sucks\nthe alternative is like well what what's\nproactive about that there's no way\nthrough this around this unless i step\nat it admit that there's a problem a\nhardship or crisis and now say am i\ngoing to endure it or am i going to\npivot and go around this or am i going\nto live to fight another day and say\nnope i'm out you win i'm moving on\nsometimes that's what happens in\nrelationships\npersisting in a relationship is great\npivoting in a relationship is great but\nsometimes we got to go hey it's the\nwrong person white flag\nwe had a good run that's as far as we\ncan go\num which is a version of an extreme\npivot but i mean the alternative\nbasically at the very\nbaseline\nof\nmy my line that the world's conspiring\nto make me happy is like\nwell see what happens if you think the\nopposite\nhmm see see how your day is if you're\nwaking up going\neverything is conspiring to make me\nunhappy now\ni'm not saying that we're not all on the\nway to death yes\nyou know you hear people say well you\nknow life is just cruel we're on the way\nto dying\nwell i'd say we're on the way to dying\nbut i wouldn't call that cruel and\nespecially now let's flip that if that's\nan inevitable fact which it is\nso how should we go if we're\ndeteriorating every day on our way to\nour death and we want to how do we look\nat that we either go oh doom and gloom\nwhat's it all for\nit's for nothing or and see how that\ngoes\nsee how you see how that goes or go the\nsame is true\nwe're all deteriorating we're on our way\nout of here so\n[ __ ] i'm gonna make the best of it well\ni'm here yeah it doesn't make it fun\nwhat's the uh the what it's that it\ndoesn't change\nagain that's why it's not foolish\noptimism it doesn't change what's\nhappening sometimes it's just about how\nwe look at it and owning up to that\nbeing a fact\nif it's a hardship in our life or\nreality in our life and saying well i\ngot two ways to look at it and which\none's going to be one more fun which\none's going to be more constructive\nwhich one's going to uh um uh lead to\nme being able to evolve\nuh\nto to turn pages to to to grow be more\ntrue all those things\nand\nhave more fun\nfor sure\nyeah and i think it you know the thing\nthat i love about the book going into\nwhat you're talking about and then\ndiving deeper into the book is that\nit gives you an idea of the mindset of\nsomeone who has had success like you\nand it also gives a lot into your\nparents in the way that they raised you\nwhich was quite unorthodox but it worked\nreally well\nand the one thing that i love about the\nstories about your parents is that\nit seemed like your mom and dad were\nreally really good at instilling\nhardcore confidence into you\nand one of the things that i love is\nthat you said you got your i don't know\nif i love it but i love the thing behind\nit is that you your third beating that\nyou got was because you said i can't\nand i remember my mom always told me you\ncould do anything you want you just\nit won't be hard that's it and then she\nalways told me she was proud of me and\nthat was the thing that i no matter what\ni think that's super important and\nand your parents told you that you can't\nsay i can't and so i want to dive into\nthat in in what lessons you learned from\ngoing i can i mean did that give you as\na child i can do anything i've just got\nto have the right mindset right work\nethic or what did that build instill in\nyou\nit built resilience\nit built hustle\nit built giddy up\nit built\nthe understanding of collaboration\nbecause let me tell you one of the\nexamples after i had already gotten\ni had already learned\nand heard from my parents that they were\ntoo you you can't is a bad word again\nyou got your mouth washed out\nfor saying damn but you say t-a-n-t\nthere's a value instilled in that you\nknow the others were just words boy a\nmindset that believes i can't do\nsomething\nis means they were they i got that butt\nopen because they meant because they\nwere letting me know oh you go out in\nthe world with that idea world's gonna\nbe tough\non you\nit's gonna you will be done on two\nyou know um so i remember one morning my\nchores were to mow the grass we need\nyard on saturday mornings so i go out\ni'm in the back shed trying to get the\npush lawnmower started it's not starting\nit's not starting it's not starting i\ncheck everything it's not starting i go\ninside dad\ni can't get the lawnmower started and i\nsaw his moeller's meet i saw this\nand i went oh geez\noh i said the word oh\ni say that he got up off the bed\nwalked past me i walked with him we went\nout of the bedroom through the kitchen\nthrough the garage around the back\n[ __ ] to the backyard where the shed was\nwhereas the lawnmower was\nthat would not start for me\nhe pulled it a few times didn't start he\ngot down got a screwdriver i looked\naround i found a hose like through the\ngas pipe that was that was just detached\nhooked all back together pumped some gas\nstarted the lawnmower and while the\nlawnmower was running\nsix feet over there he walks over to me\nputs his hand on my shoulders leans down\neye to eye and goes\nyou see son\nyou were just having trouble\nyes\nand that's what i mean by i learned\ncollaboration as well yeah saying even\nif you're unable to do something pull\nsomething off on your own you can still\nask for help\nor ask for assistance or get the right\ntool\nand it was very valuable and and\nsomething that we don't allow our kids\nto say to this day either and so it\ndidn't instill supreme confidence of oh\ni can do anything\nbut it did say\nmore so\ni\ni i it'll take a lot more to defeat me\nright\nit will take a lot more before i cry\nuncle it will take a lot more before i\ngo i give it'll take a lot more before i\nsay\nthat's as far as i can go\nso it built resilience and endurance and\nhustle\nand\nalso creativity in the collaboration\nto go\nagain i've talked earlier about pivots\nyou know in in in endurance\ngetting creative about when you're\nrunning into blockades going\nyour mindset i can't figure this out i\ncan't why why is this relationship going\nthis way why do i keep trying to get\nthis outcome in the job but i'm not\ngetting it well don't say i can't i\nhaven't yet i'm having trouble if you\njust say i'm having trouble it just\nleaves it open there's a way there's\nanother puzzle piece here somewhere\nthat's constructive that was one of the\nvalues that he that he put in this you\nknow it's just it's just a perspective a\nmindset and an understanding\nthat actually\nhell you could even say if you were\nunable to\ndo something for 50 years\nbut you found someone who could\nyou then go\nwell\ni mean maybe there's even value of going\ni'm not able to but it but it is\npossible you know if you want to take it\nall the way to that extent which then\nopens up well\nmaybe i didn't have that maybe i wasn't\neducated for this thing that took me\nmaybe some you know there's certain\nthings that people have to be an expert\nto pull off\nso saying not being able so not saying i\ncan't does not mean oh i i i can\ndo everything\nit's not about like no you can't just be\na 50-minute expert and go well i am\nbecause i didn't say it no that's not\nwhat it means\nit just means don't\nlike i said don't be stay resilient\ndon't be defeated as quickly don't quit\ndon't quit we we we we\nwe quit i think too often me included we\nquit things too often we quit\nrelationships we\nwe quit doing the hard work that we know\nit's gonna pay off but if we just stick\nwith it man\nit will but we're so into immediate\ngratification we need it now if i'm not\ngetting my results right now then i'm\ngonna say well i can't do it anymore oh\nhang on man this is long money this is\nlong money hang in there this one has\nreal\nvalue real currency at the end and we're\ntalking about the kind that feels the\nbank account and the souls account don't\nquit\nyeah\ni think it's i think it goes back to so\nmany people\nlove to start but then they give up\nsomewhere along the way\nyou know and it's it's\nit's not that i can't it's just that i'm\nnot able to yet but it doesn't mean that\ni won't figure out a way right\nyep\nand that's what i love about it and not\nbeing able to yet is exactly not being\nable to yet is different than i can't\nright and too many people\ntry one thing and they it doesn't go\ngood right away for them so then they go\nto the next thing and then they go to\nthe next thing and then like man nothing\nworks out it's like no it's not that\nnothing works out it's just that you\nhaven't been putting in enough time to\nactually succeed at something you don't\nsucceed at almost anything right away it\ntakes time to get to where you want to\ngo yeah it's true i mean\nyou know\nwe want things to be easy but the hard\nwork\nand the persistence at certain things if\nwe're doing something that we have the\ninnate ability to do and we're willing\nto hustle for it and if it's in business\nif there's a demand for it you know\nchoose something that you can supply\nthat can also be in demand is a pretty\nsmart thing if you're talking about\nbusiness\nbut\nyeah\nhow many times we go oh no if you work\nhard it actually then gets easy\nit actually\ni get you know i got i\npov on me is\nfor a long time in my life and career\nit's been like oh mcconaughey just makes\nit look easy rolls out of bed so it's\nlike what are we doing today\nyeah\nyeah\ntrust me i've been breaking my sweat\nbehind behind the doors over there so i\ncan come out and make it look like i\njust rolled off the app car yeah that's\nright\nyeah yeah\nyeah one there's there's so many great\nstories throughout it um\nand one that that's that was something\nthat you said it was a really good\nlesson is you know number one i was\ncrying at the point where you're talking\nabout your brother and his seeing hot\ndog the good thing my girlfriend was\ndriving at the time in my she was\ndriving my truck at the time because i\nwas literally crying laughing so hard\nabout the cni dog so that's a beautiful\nstory that people have to hear there's a\ngreat story about you building a 13\nstory\nfreaking treehouse by yourself with\nstolen wood and then there's another one\nif you get this and this one i want to\ndive into is the story of you wrestling\nthe championship wrestler at a tribe in\nafrica\nand it was at that moment and i love it\nbecause it's like you were challenged\nyou could have said no and nobody would\nhave ever known nobody would ever judge\nyou the one thing that i wrote it down\nis it says it's not about win or lose\nit's about did you accept the challenge\nit's not about win or lose\ndid you accept challenge yeah\nyes\nand so what's the what's the story\nbehind that and how what made you decide\nto go you know what\nhell yeah let's go ahead and arrest this\nguy at random guy in africa i remember\nthe moment we've been i've been as in\nthe banjo of africa which is this\nplace where i think it was around the\n11th century\na lot of the animists\nin mali fled in them after the muslim\ninvasion\nand they went off to these places and\nbuilt these\ncamps at the base of these huge\nmountains where the rivers flow\nand these camps these little villages\nare spread out between eight and fifteen\nmiles apart and we were on about day six\nof our hike so each day\nwe'd hike the eight to 15 miles to the\nnext place the chief would meet you at\nthe boundary\ni'd read you know the chief likes what\nhe sees in your eyes\nhe puts a hand out and to give a soft\nhandshake not a firm handshake that\nmeans aggression well i was being\naccepted into the chiefs of didn't like\nwhat was in my eyes so being accepted in\nthe camp you get to the camp\num\nthere's always a young boy in camp\nusually aged 11 to 14 who was sort of\nthe runner\nyou know a new guest in town he's going\nto fetch you a chicken he's going to\nwalk he would walk me to the cleanest\nplace in the river to then go brush my\nteeth and bathe and he'd watch out for\ncrocodiles or people what have you you\ncome back they give you the best chair i\nmean the one with the least rips in it\nyou know what i mean um\nand and then i eat eat the chicken meal\nand you'd have like 10 kids sitting\naround and i and i was hungry i would\neat all of my meal and trust me i can\nclean it i can clean the chicken bone\nbut i would put this plate down when i\nwas done\nand all those 10 kids would\nbe on it and clean it up even more so\nanyway i get to this one camp one day\nand i had\nshown up over there in molly\ni said my name was david i was looking\nfor anonymity i wanted i was going to a\nplace where nobody knew my name i said\nmy name was dave i said i was a writer\nand a boxer\nwell\ndavid in bambada which is their native\ntongue the native language is\nwell dauda\nvery quick quickly became clear\nas word of strong white men named dauda\nis coming\nbut they didn't give a damn about the\nwriting part they were damn interested\nin the boxing part and over there they\nlove to wrestle it's their pastime\nand i'd showed up at this camp in\nbenjamin matu after about a 14-mile hike\nand i was laying on my back stretching\nas i usually do at the end of the walk\nand um\nthe village kind of came around over me\nand i noticed this was the ritual i show\nup i look different i'm a visitor i'm\ngoing to be the knights entertainment\nyou know\nfrom how i look to what i say to what\ninnuendo we can have and jokes we can\ntell and kids playing with the kids et\ncetera et cetera\nwell\nthese two young men that were about\nlooked about 18 to 20\nstarted to talk sort of\nwe just had a bit of an aggression to it\nright right i could tell they were\ntalking at me\nand i lean over to east and i said\nare they talking [ __ ]\nhe goes this is exactly what they're\ndoing they're talking [ __ ] they're\nchallenging strong white men named daddy\nto wrestling match because they say they\nare the champion wrestlers of audi\nvillage\nand i'm like oh geez they're talking all\nthat smack huh and he i said you know in\namerica when people talk a lot before a\nchallenge it usually means they can't\nback it up because they're talking too\nmuch it is same in africa they talk too\nmuch\nanyway they're coming at me and they're\ngetting all the other villages excited\nand the villagers know what they're\nsaying challenging me to a match two of\nthem\nand i'm just laying there i'm still\nstretching and all of a sudden the pitch\nof the the village just skyrockets and\nthe screams go up and i look up\nand these two boys that were talking at\nme just go\nrun off sprint\nand everyone's laughing going on\nwhy\nbecause who steps up\nmichelle\nburlap bag around his waist tied with\nrope no shirt no shoes about five foot\nnine five foot ten tree trunk of a guy\nstands where the two boys stood\nthis\nis the real champion of the village\n[Laughter]\nhe doesn't say a word\nhe comes and stands over me he points at\nmy chest points to his chest and then\npoints to his right and i'm laying on\nthe ground i know this is a challenge my\nheartbeat starts to go up i look over\nthere and what's over there where he\npointed there's this big dirt pit\nand just as i see that my heart rate\nstarts going up\nand in this ear i'm going are you\nkidding me no [ __ ] way am i gonna do\nthat and as i'm hearing this voice\nin this ear i hear\nare you kidding me if you don't dude you\nwill regret this for the rest of your\nlife this is legend there you go you\ngotta find out you gotta and so while\ni'm doing that this year's winning and\nall of a sudden i find myself stand up\nright in front of him\nheartbeat pacing i point to his chest\npoint to mine\nand move towards the big dirt pit\nnow the crowd goes crazy and it's on and\ni write about what happened in the in\nthe wrestling match in the story\nbut what happened is i had handled\nmyself pretty well and all of a sudden\nafter the match became what was called a\nuh it was called a big man in the\nvillage\na big man in the village\nand the next day uh which is a beautiful\npart about the story because that guy\nwrestled you got to read that daniel he\nwas so good he walks me it was so\ngraceful\nbut we get to the next camp the next day\nafter that night of wrestling when i\naccepted the challenge and i said to he\nsaid my god i was like so what about\nlast night man i mean i i i think i did\npretty good you know and he goes oh no\nyou do very very well everybody think\nthat michelle is going to have strong\nwhite men named on his back in 10\nseconds\nyou handled michelle\ni said ah\nso i\ni won he goes no no\nyou were a big man in the village not\nwhen you handled michelle\nit was not about win or lose you were\nbig men as soon as you accept the\nchallenge\nah i was like boy take that one don't\nforget that one mcconaughey you know and\nit's a good one\nfor\nus all more often and and i think the\nreason that we don't accept as many\nchallenges or take as many\nrisks like that or others not that\neveryone's going to go to africa\nhave the option to go wrestle but\nwhat was inherent in in the proverb that\nwas thrown back at me was\nit wasn't about the winning and it\nwasn't even about the losing\n[Music]\nwell we usually say no to those kind of\nrisks because the fear of losing\nbut what happens when we\nreally i've found that through life what\nreally seems to happen is\nwe need to be a lot less fearful of\nlosing\nright\nand those people that do go high 99 you\nlost i saw you\nnumber one they're usually not\nreal players in this whole game anyway\nthey're usually the people on the\nsidelines and they're on the sidelines\nbecause that's where they belong right\nnumber two\nnot as many people do that as you think\nmore people go\nyeah\ni tried that too and lost\nyou know what i mean or\nway to go i've gotten things in my life\nnot for victories\nbut because\ni've had people come up and go\nyou stepped in the proverbial ring again\nand lost again but you came back again\nright i want you on my team\nand\ni think it's just don't give so much\ncredit to the idea of losing and don't\nthink that you're the center of the\nworld especially in today which thumbs\nup or thumbs down on somebody to give\nyou\nto give each person their their identity\nvia what we say about them\ndon't don't don't go don't go by that\nthe real ones the ones that matter the\nreal players the ones that ain't on the\nsidelines\nbecause that's\nwhere they those sideline people belong\nthey\nthey appreciate\nthe acceptance acceptance of a challenge\nmore than they\ndismiss you if you lost\nyeah and it goes back to like the whole\nmindset your parents instilled in you\nlike don't say you can't there's a part\nof you it's like i could beat this guy\nand have the greatest story of my life\nyou know i've been a hollywood actor\ni've done all these crazy things but i\ncould literally beat this guy in a tribe\nin a village in africa and have that\ninside of you had you never told this\nstory you still have an incredible\nexperience that\nmost people will never have\nand i don't think people think yeah\nno i mean it's true i mean you read the\nbook it goes on the story\nand the\nthe fact that moment when i got up off\nthe ground to accept the challenge\nstill that story's still being told if i\nwouldn't have done that\nwell i don't know how many other things\nwould have gone differently\nin my life\ni mean you have the story of the\nbeautiful story of the grace of\nmichelle walking me back to the next\nvillage the next day then i go back six\nyears later\nhe does the same thing\ntalk about lineage and i and the term i\nuse in the book is\nleave your scent you know um\nboy that's leaving your scent\nyeah and\nyou know for me also very just\npersonally with with that\nyou know and it has a crew story it has\nto do with the african stories and a lot\nof other walkabouts i've taken\nbut\ni've needed that in my own life being\nfamous\nbecause i don't meet strangers anymore\nand i have to sort of decipher\nwait am i is this person you know\nendearing being endearing to me because\nof weight the biography of who i am and\nso so i'm always trying to measure like\nwhat wait wait i got to make sure am i\nstill earning this am i still getting\ncredit for who i am right now\nyeah\nyou and i just met we've been on we've\nbeen on this call for 25 minutes\nis my worth to you what's my worth to\nyou that i'm creating in our\nrelationship in the last 25 minutes but\nnot before\nright so to go away to far away places\nwhere nobody knows my name\nand\ni have a story like this and then come\nback six years later and the same guy\nwalks me 15 miles holding my hand that\ngoes ah that was all based off of the\nman they met named dauda\nsix years ago they didn't know\ni was an actor they didn't ever see me\non tv they didn't know i was famous they\nhad no biography i was a stranger who\nshowed up in their strange land and when\ni show back up that whole village is six\nyears later that whole village is\nhugging me and everyone's growing six\nyears old and i'm talking to their kids\nthey're all six years older and the\nfathers and michelle and the whole\nvillage they all remember and it's all\nbased off of who was the man that they\nmet six years ago who that night\naccepted that child\nyeah nothing\nyeah and it's it's a perfect example of\nlike there's many times throughout the\nthroughout the book that you can hear\nthat you\nare on this journey to\nkind of become better and and seek new\nexperiences so there's there's you know\nliterally you went to africa and this is\nthe moment where you're actually already\nfamous to this point right so you want\nso you're already famous at this point\nyou go to africa and do this there's\nalso stories of how you literally road\ntripped with your dog inside of an\nairstream when you're already famous as\nwell yeah and then you go down to\nuh aikido's peru\nand go on a spiritual journey in the\nmiddle of the height of when most people\nfeel like you've made it you've gotten\nto this point it seems like you're\nalways trying to learn more about\nyourself and see\nwhat other you know i always say like us\nare kind of like a rose that's always\nconstantly blooming and as new pedals\nfall off there's new pedals that pop up\nthat we need to go oh i should discover\nthis\nand uh as you're talking about your trip\nto ikita's peru\ni know about iquitos proof because i've\nhad quite a few friends go down there\nand i was like\nthat's interesting there's only one\nreason why i know people go down to\niquitos peru usually and that's usually\nthey do ayahuasi experiences and\nspiritual journeys down there\nand so i'm curious with what what made\nyou decide to go down there do the do\nthese experiences whether it was\nayahuasca or whether it was a spiritual\njourney in general\nand\nat the point where most people be like\ni've made it why why why go down there\nand find another part of yourself when\nyou you've gotten everything in this\nworld that we're taught we're supposed\nto have\nwell\nyou got to remember that was at a time\nwhen yes\nthe the the roof was taken off of all\nthe possibilities for me\ni had just gotten famous time to kill it\njust come out all of a sudden every the\n99 nos out of 100 that i was getting\nyesterday were now 99 yes\nso when everything comes up and is open\nto you and is now a yes\nthat's\na hell of a challenge\nyeah that's a a intimidating thing wait\na minute\n48 hours ago i would have done any of\nthese and now you're telling me i can do\nall of them and you want me to be\ndiscerning and go well now that i can do\nall of them let me pick the one i really\nwant out wait a minute 48 hours ago i\nwould have done anything to do any of\nthem yeah\nso\nyou know to use the term green lights\nfrom the top book when all of a sudden\nyou know there were 99 red lights and\none green light 48 hours ago and now\nthere's 99 green and one red whoa where\ndid i go i couldn't travel down all\nthese paths just 48 hours ago and now\nyou're saying\ngo move on forward i'm like going well\nwait a minute there's a whole lot more\npass than i've ever had so\ni needed to go hear my own self thing\ni needed to go let memory catch up with\nme i needed to go see check in with me\nand put myself in a place where i didn't\nhave all the frequency of those\nagreements i was choosing a red light\nby going away\non my own where people didn't know my\nname i didn't want to hear all the noise\nall the yeses do this do this you're the\ngreatest this is awesome we love you bye\nyes more please do this one no do this\none you do\nwhoa man\nhang on i gotta go hear myself think\nso\ni had a um\ni had a dream that i go through um that\nwas not a nightmare but had elements of\na nightmare but was not it was actually\njust quite the opposite\nlike literally the opposite and in that\ndream\nthere were two things not dreams though\nyou can mix realities and times right\nin that dream there's two things i was\nsure of i was floating down the amazon\nriver\nand the banks and the banks on the left\nside of the river into the horizon was\nlined with african tribesmen\nso\ni went to the\natlas to go look for the amazon river in\nthe continent of africa two things i\nknew and as most of you know you can\nlook forever and you won't find the\namazon the continent about because it's\nthe wrong concept\nbut in my dream those two were the same\nso then i found the amazon obviously in\nsouth america\npicked out a spot to say this is where\ni'm heading\nand i'll go chase down the first part of\nthat drink\nand\nthat's why i went away i was looking for\nsomewhere to go but that kingdom is sort\nof a celestial sign and it's like\nand i'd actually what i didn't say is it\nwas the second time that i had a dream\nso when i had it the second time at this\ntime in my life where i'd just gotten\nall this payment access i went oh\ni've never had a dream that is exactly\nthe same frame for frame 11 second dream\ni've never had the exact same dream\nbefore twice and now i have so this must\nbe a sign\nthis is telling me telling me something\nand\nso i went off to the end zone and as you\nread later in the book\nthat was only half the dream the other\nhalf was the african tribe which we\nprepared this story with one of the\nstories to afro which is what led me to\nmali years later\nagain\nexact same dream\nyears after peru years after i went\nthrough and said oh that dream came back\nand it's the exact same one i guess i\nneed to chase down the other half\nwell what's the other thing i know did\nthe amazon\nask contrast\nso then it would find a place to go and\nafterwards i'm going to go to mali and\nlearn things that we talked about\nearlier\nyeah man and the the thing that i love\nabout that's consistent throughout the\nbook is that it seems like you're really\nokay\nwith betting on yourself like especially\nrather i remember\nyou would prefer yeah so i i remember\ni was watching you know this is 2013\n2014 i was watching true detective\nand i was like holy [ __ ]\ni didn't know that he could act like\nthis because you talk about you know how\nyou used to be you're kind of like put\nin this box and you kept betting you you\nwant to get out of this box and start\ndoing something different right so we\nwatched dallas buyers club last night so\ni was like i need to watch this again\njust to get the whole the whole vibe of\nwhen this switch was for you\nand and you decided to stop doing like\nthe rom-coms and you got these big\noffers it was like a million you know\nfive million you said no's and then they\nupped it to like seven million they said\nno and then i think they went to like 15\nand they're like 22 million or something\nand you're like oh my god i'm at the\npoint\nwhere i've got to decide\nif i'm actually going to be real about\nthis or if i'm going to go back to what\ni was actually doing and so\ni'm curious behind all of that\nconfidence and betting on yourself\nhow do you talk to yourself in your head\nbecause i know a lot of people that i've\nspoken to that follow me reach out and\nthey just\nthere's no self-love in their head\nthere's not positive self-talk i'm\ncurious with you are you do you sp do\nyou build yourself up are you an\naffirmations guy do you look yourself in\nthe mirror and you're like yes you're\namazing like how how do you how does\nmatthew mcconaughey talk to himself in\nhis head good question um\nthe truth for me\nthat usually settles on us very quietly\nbut like a lightning bolt at the same\ntime\ncame that you know what\nyour work life\nis not challenging your real life\nat that time when i was only doing wrong\ncomes and only getting offered those it\nwas not able to or getting offered the\ndramatic fair that i wanted to do that\ntruth came to me and i said\nand i and i wasn't sleeping well man i\nmean i was like ah i was i was not happy\nenough with my work and i remember\nsaying to myself\nwell i'm glad your life is so vital and\nmore vital than your work but boy i'd\nsure love to try and do work that can at\nleast challenge the vitality of the\nlikelihood\nand that was not coming through the\nscripts in the rom-coms the action\ncompanies that i was only getting\noffered\nso when i said\nsort of what's the bigger risk\nyou know\nbigger risk was well i want to find out\nif i can't do what i've been what i want\nto do\nwhat if i stop doing what i'm doing and\nthat will at least remove me from what\nis giving me my angst it won't give me\nthe place to go\nbecause that's not being offered to me\nbut maybe i just by process of\nelimination remove myself from that so\nsoon as that was clear that that's what\ni'm doing\nand camilla my wife helped me out a lot\nit's like this is gonna who knows how\nlong you're not gonna go with that work\nyou're gonna get wobbly that bottle is\ngonna look better to drink out of\nearlier in the day all those kinds of\nthings i was going to i battled since a\nbattle\nuh not feeling significant that i\nbattled not being able to feel like i\ncould accomplish things\nlike i couldn't build something i i\npurchased a one-way ticket into limbo\nand you know we all know limbo is where\nit sucks\nyou know and it goes back to what\nearlier i was saying i'd rather bet on\nme because these then i know\nif i win i go yes if i lose i go that\nwas on you i just like i like knowing\nright so\nwhat's going through my head is\nit's not a daily come on you got this\nonce that truth was clear\nthat's the hardest part for me\nafter it's clear it's when do you put it\ninto action\ni mean i find that the truth is clear to\nus\nmore often than we give it credit to be\nthe hard part is when do we implement\nbecause we're always going well tomorrow\nwill be a better time to do that or\nmaybe after this next well let me do\n14.5 man geez just do this one and then\nwe'll stop doing mom right you can kind\nof you can push the bucket and you can\ntrust me my blood family my brothers and\nmother when i turned down those officers\nlike what is your problem\nbut i admit it was clear to me and it\nwas clear to camilla why it was for me\nthen it was just okay this is what i'm\ndoing i don't know\nif i'll ever work again\nin hollywood but even if i don't i won't\nregret this decision the only thing i\nwill regret again like saying yes i'll\naccept the challenge\nis not knowing\nand if i stay in the business and do the\nmovies that i'm getting offered i can\nhave a very affluent lifestyle enjoy i\nenjoy the work of the rom-coms i get\npaid very handsomely but\nthose will be taking me further\naway\nfrom ever being able to having the\nchance to experience the kind of work\nthat i want to do and active\nso i said i'll regret that more not\nknowing\nthen i will this and i was like if i\ndon't work i'll i'll\ni'll figure out something else to do\nyou know i don't think i'll go back to\nlaw school maybe be a wildlife guy maybe\ni'll be an orchestral conductor a\nteacher a high school football coach i\ndon't know i'll figure something else\nout so\nit's not daily after that decisions made\nthere was no going back it didn't matter\nif i hadn't\nthat was what 15 years ago\nif i never got if i had still only been\ngetting offered the rom-coms i was\ngetting off at that time\nsince then 15 years ago\ni don't think i would have i don't think\nyou'd have seen me in any movies for the\npast 15 years\nthe decision was clear\nand it was just about\nand so once that became clear that's\nagain once you know it's black it's not\nnear as dark i said it's black man\nfor 20 months it was black nothing came\nin\ni was like this is it but i was like\nokay\nagain when i say no understanding that\nit's black when you know it's black's\nnear dark saying realizing that in this\ndecision\nmeans i may never work in hollywood\nagain\nface that blackness you still willing\nlet's go\nlet's roll the dice let's accept that\nchallenge i'll accept that damn\nchallenge let's just see now funny thing\nis that along the way\ni actually\nstarted to in the last year of not\ngetting in i started to kind of gain\nstrength\nbecause had i had miles under my belt\ni'd been saying no to things for like\n10 months\nand so each day became sort of a little\nmore of a badge of honor for me it\nbecame a little more like that's right\ni'm holding out man i'm still i'm still\non my sabbatical i'm saying no and then\ni started to feel like you know what the\nlonger i'm gone here i think i'm\nbuilding a little momentum\nof what i'm\ndefinitely not going back now\nit became really clear to me and at that\ntime is when the industry started going\nhe's not doing any more rom-coms he just\npaired out a 14.5 million dollar offer\nhe's not bluffing\nso let's quit offering those so then\nthey offered me nothing\nfor another\n14 months\nand 20 months went by\nwhere's mcconaughey haven't seen him in\na rom-com he hasn't been in theaters\nhadn't been in our living room\nhe hadn't been shirtless on the beach\nwhere the hell is he\nand you know might be a new good idea\nfor like\nlincoln lawyer killer joe\nmud bernie paperboy\nmagic mike true detective dallas park\nwell guess who's now was now a new good\nidea a novel idea\nbecause where's he been no one knows\nwhere he\nis here i am ready\nput me in coach and just pounced on but\nit took the unbranding before the\nrebrand so the daily thing there's not a\ndaily\nit was just reminding myself\nhey\noutlast this it's a longer penance it's\na longer pilgrimage than than maybe\nagain facing\nlook look at look at cobia right now i\ncall that i call it there's something we\nhave that's called anticipation fatigue\nand it's part and parcel with once you\nknow it's black isn't near dark\nlike in making that decision not to do\nthe wrong comes i said you may never\nwork again in hollywood\nthat's saying\nface the worst case scenario right\nbut if i don't do that and i'm like\ngoing\nit's been a couple months man\nmaybe maybe this week maybe this week so\ni'm wasting 30 percent of my\nenergy on anticipating it being over\nit's like in code right now fourth thing\nin the world tomorrow for the last eight\nmonths\nthere are those of us who thought well\nmaybe this week\nand you get up you get your hopes up and\nthen\nget your hopes up and then you look down\nyou do that that many times you're\nwasting energy but if you sit there and\ngo this may go on forever\nyour body on a cellular level and a\nmental level slips into survival mode\nyou start conserving energy\nand so that's what happened to me in\nthat 20 months i was like i may never go\nback and work again so my body slipped\ninto\nlean horse long ride\nlean horse long ride\neasy and i told myself\nyou're go and camilla said you're going\nto get wobbly you're going to get\nanxious you're going to get like ah what\nwas i thinking\nthe decision was clear let's remember\nthis truth\nright here that we've agreed on\nand no matter what happens what comes\ndoesn't come\nstick to it trust it\nyep\nand then you do dallas buyers club you\ndo some really big things you win an\nacademy award for best actor and\ncompletely changed your life but it all\ncame because you decided to bet on\nyourself and you decided to stick to\nsomething and stay with it stay with\nyour guns and what you wanted to do and\nyou know i love the\ni love the speech that you gave on the\nacademy awards there because you talk\nabout how you know you're chasing\nyourself in 10 years who you want to be\nin 10 years\nand that's who your hero is is you in 10\nyears and trying to get better\nand one thing i always say is that is\nthat i i believe that god has like i\nlike to visualize it god is like a\nchecklist right of like okay rob dial\nthis is everything that he could do and\noh he's doing that he's checking off and\nmy goal is to get to the end\ngo up and god looks at and says [ __ ] i\ndidn't think you were going to do this\nmuch like that's that's my goal right is\nthat that's what i want to have happen\ngod be like tim you did well my son like\nthat's what i want to see\nand and what's amazing about it is that\nit kind of goes what you're saying where\nit's not that you have a hero that's\nsomeone else you have a hero of the\nperson who you want to be\nin your future and so do you have a\nyou know\na daily of trying to get better each day\nso that you do become that hero in 10\nyears and you know this progression and\nwanting to see yourself get a little bit\nbetter every single day every single day\nand every single day yeah i call it\nchasing\nyet\ni think it's something personally a\npersonal credo i think it's\ni think it should be our\ncountry's freedom\nchasing yet\nmeaning\nyou never get to yet\nthere's no landing spot there's not a\ntodd moment there's never going to be\nperfect equality and righteousness in\namerica\ncan we get a little bit better and have\na small ascension in our life\nthat means oh i see evolution\nyeah\nit's a small ramp even if it's just\nslightly a ramp or what the hell are we\ndoing growing older\nwhat are we doing if we if\nwe're all\nhave in us\nyesterday's\nexperience from yesterday that we didn't\nhave the day before\nthen there's got to be there's got to be\nif we utilize it there's got to be a\nsmall ascension or at least a huge\nopportunity for a small ascension of\ninvolvement as individuals as even as a\ncollective\num\nit's it's it's\nthat i think realizing that yes\nwe can understand that we can just\nstay in the race and commit to the chase\nto being\na little bit better\na little more truer if you don't like\nthe word better sometimes people go\nbetter worse that's moralizing no okay a\nlittle more true to yourself and only\nyou only we each know what that is\nif you can do it just a little bit in\nsmall increments that's as good as it\ngets then you're always in the process\nbut what we have to watch is our result\norientation\ni've got to get to that\ngoal\nand i'm four goals i'm four i'm for\nthose trust me i used to you read the\nbook i've written many a headline first\nthat i then lived the journey to the\nheadline and pulled some of them off so\ni'm all for that but we have to watch\nsometimes going\nand understand that even when we do that\neven when we pull off that goal get that\ngirl\nget win that award whatever it is\nyou don't go\nah\nokay\nactually it opens up twice as many more\navenues for which with for with which to\ngo forward and evolve and go and and and\nget a little bit better at\nthere's not a land there's not a final\nlanding spot\nin this life\nuntil we die\nyeah\nin this life so it's it's it's it's\nthinking it's it's that's what chasing\nmy heroes me in 10 years it's just going\nwho am i\nwho do i want you know and you have to\nwatch it's different for everybody how\nfar out they can project\nbecause maybe 10 years is too far for\nsomebody and you don't want to be like\nwell i want to chase who i want to\nbecome because you got to give yourself\ncredit for who you are right now too\nyou know so you can't be just completely\nobjective without just saying no i'm\ngoing to live out my moment as who i am\nbut it's a step at a time\nis the subjective with the big picture\nin mind which is the objective project\nfrom forward of where i want to go and\nwho i want to become and it's balancing\nthose two i believe um because some\nmaybe for some people that's like hey\na month out is as far as i can think all\nright\na month away is as far as i can project\nwhere i can simultaneously understand\nthe paradox in that who i want to be and\nwho i am\num\nif you can just keep stretching that as\nfar out as possible while keeping those\ntwo in relation i mean i think\nultimately\nthe place the the the\nextent in this life is to think about\nyour eulogy\nthink about how your kids introduce you\nwhen you're gone how the world\nintroduces you when you're gone now\nthat's a daunting task\nbut it's an exhilarating task\nand even if you can't keep hold the\nconcept of it just give it a give it a\nnudge give it a try or walk the dog out\nand go i can think about i can think of\nmy heroes me in a month what can i get\nbetter at be more true in this month and\nthat'll lead to maybe six months down\nthe road then maybe you can think a year\nthen maybe you think two years five ten\ntwenty thirty and it can start to extend\nyou can kind of it works out your your\nyour projection muscles\nyou know um mentally and spiritually\nbut that's that's that's what that is\nchasing yet if we can understand that\nthat's that's that's it you don't get\nthere we never get there and that's the\npoint\nyep\nyeah and\nliterally could not ask for a better\ntransition to the question i love to ask\npeople at the end\nbut uh first i want to honor you man i\nappreciate your time\ni love the book like actually love the\nbook i thought it was amazing i think\neverybody needs to get it it's called\ngreen lights and it's the memoir of the\npast 35 years i guess the past 50 years\nof your life but going through journals\nfor 35 years of taking journals\nand uh i i tell my mom it was really\nweird to her because i i tell her i\nthink about death every day\nand she goes why the hell do you think\nabout death every day and my dad died\nwhen i was 15 and so since that day i've\nthought my time is coming at some point\nin time like i know it is so my biggest\nfear is to get to the end of my life and\nhave\nregrets and things i wish i would have\ndone\nand you're talking about your eulogy in\nthe time when when\npeople what people say about you after\nyou leave\nand there's a phrase that says\nyou know there's you they say you die\ntwice first is when you're in the cask\nand you stop breathing and this last\ntime is the last time that someone says\nyour name\nand so i'm curious with you\nin between the first death and the\nsecond death what do you think and what\ndo you hope people say about you\nyeah\nyou know\ni\ni believe that are you a parent no\nokay well when you\nyou know\nyou just you just reported\nan extension of saying hey\nthe life we live makes us immortal right\nbut when you have\nkids it's another thing you go oh now\ni'm actually literally immortal i'm not\nbiological\nyou know what i mean\num\ni think\nthat uh you know if i was introduced as\nbeing someone to say you know what\nmcconaughey was at home\n[Music]\nin the world\num\nhe saw himself\nuh as who he was individually the boy\nsure did see himself and others\nand and and\nas well\num\nhe\ndamn chair\ncommitted he didn't half-ass it to use\nmy dad's word he didn't have fast things\nhe didn't know how to half-past it\nhe really didn't know how to happen\num\nhe wasn't always right\nbut no it's true people know he's right\nbut but\nhe was at least true i had this i had\nthis director tell me this one time in\nthis scene where i'm i i'm the scene i'm\nvery rigid about or at least secure with\nwhat i know about what my man is
