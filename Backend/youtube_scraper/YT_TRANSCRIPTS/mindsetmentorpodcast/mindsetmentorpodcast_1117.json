    "transcript": "is that not\nmind-blowing to anybody else and nobody\ntalks about how the\nis literally\nthe\n[Music]\ntoday i'm going to talk about one of the\nmost mind-blowing things that exists in\nour world that for some reason nobody\never talks about and it's called the\nplacebo effect you've probably heard the\nphrase before you might know what the\nplacebo effect is\nyou might even be in the same situation\nas me and you might think why in the\nhell does nobody talk about this thing\ncalled the placebo effect so we're going\nto dive into what it is what makes it so\nmind-blowing and then how you can use\nthe placebo effect in your own life so\nwhat is the placebo effect exactly\nwell whenever they're doing drug trials\nwhen there's a new drug that's coming\nout what they will do is they will get a\ngroup of people and they will give group\na the new drug to see how it works on\nthem so if they have some sort of heart\nissue or let's just say they have blood\npressure issue right they'll give them\nthis new amazing whatever it is blood\npressure medication and then for another\ngroup they will tell them that they are\ngetting the blood pressure medication\nbut they won't actually get anything\nwhat it is is they'll give them these\nlittle pills that are just made out of\nsugar so they give them sugar pills and\nthen they test group a which have the\nmedication versus group b that have\nliterally just sugar pills and here's\nwhat's crazy is this is in all medical\ntrials all medical trials use the\nplacebo effect as the control and what\nthey find is that only about 10 percent\n10 of new drugs that go out into the\nworld work better than the placebo\neffect\nlet me say that again\n10 percent of new drugs that hit the\nmarket only 10 of them work better than\na sugar pill in somebody thinking that\nthis cure this pill is going to cure\nthem and the pill actually does cure\nthem\nso what are we getting at it's not the\nsugar that cures somebody\nwhat is it it's the thought\nbehind it of i am taking something\nthat's curing me and the mind cures the\nbody\nis that not\nmind-blowing to anybody else and nobody\ntalks about how the mind is literally\nhealing the body\nso let's talk a little bit deeper about\nit let's get some statistics in there so\nuh one-third\nof all medical healings\nis the placebo effect that means 33\npercent of all medical healings\nthey actually think comes from placebo\neffects somebody thinking their way into\nhealing\none third of\nthem once again as i said ten percent of\nthe pills that come out onto the market\nactually do better than the placebo\neffect which means that ninety percent\nof the time your brain will heal you\nbetter than taking some medication that\ncomes from some company\nso as we dive deeper into it what we\nrealize is that\nthe thought\nof i'm being cured\ncures somebody\nso then you dive deeper into and you go\ndamn if i can heal myself with my\nthoughts what else can i do with my\nthoughts and why do we not pay more\nattention to this it has nothing to do\nwith the pill it has all to do with\ntheir mind and placebo has been shown to\ncause this is from an actual clinical\nstudy placebo has been shown to cause\nmeasurable change in blood pressure\nheart rate and pain releasing chemicals\nlike endorphins it affects the\ncardiovascular system the endocrine\nsystem digestive system immune system\nand respiratory system\nit when they say it that's what's crazy\nabout it is it's not an actual thing it\nis your own mind that is affecting your\ncardiovascular system your endocrine\nsystem your digestive system your immune\nsystem and your respiratory system\nplacebos have been shown to cause\nmassive amounts of neurobiological\neffects to the brain and the body\nwhy is nobody talking about this this\nmakes no sense to me because people are\nhealing themselves with their mind how\nincredible is that\nand nobody talks about this there's all\nthese people that are healing themselves\ntheir mind and we're just going oh yeah\nthat's the placebo effect oh yeah i'm a\ndoctor that's a placebo effect now i'm\nnot trying to knock on doctors people\nthat are trying to help the people get\nbetter but nobody talks about how\nincredible this is let me say this again\none-third of all medical healings so at\nits simplest form we are thinking that\nwe are cured and through thinking that\nwe are cured we are actually curing but\nthen you start to think to yourself huh\nthat's interesting if i can heal myself\nwith my mind is the opposite of that\ntrue\ncan i make myself sick with my mind and\nthe answer is\nyou got it yes it's called the nocebo\neffect you can make yourself sick with\nyour own thoughts with all of the stuff\nthat's happening in the world right now\nthis is pretty damn important to talk\nabout isn't it if you are living in a\nstate of fear and you are constantly\nthinking that you might get sick you\nmight get a virus you might have\nsomething happen to you what are you\nactually doing you're making yourself\nsicker and you're making yourself\nactually more susceptible to whatever it\nis that you're fearing\nsay that again your thoughts of what you\nare fearing is making you more\nsusceptible to getting the thing that\nyou're actually afraid of getting\nif it affects your respiratory system\nyour cardiovascular system your immune\nsystem and you are thinking i'm getting\nsick from this or i could get sick from\nwhatever it is that's out there i won't\ntalk about this thing but if we're\npossibly getting sick from it\nand i'm worried about getting sick from\nit doesn't that mean that i'm lowering\nmy immune system to then actually\npossibly be more likely to get that\nthing\nit does\nso it's called the no sibo and we all\nknow someone who's always sick right you\nknow someone who's always\ni mean they're like the webmd doctor\nright they're like oh my gosh my elbow\nhurts and they're like what is wrong\nwith me oh my god i have elbow cancer\nright like elbow cancer doesn't exist\nbut they always think like they have\nsomething and then what happens they end\nup having all of these different issues\nthey're always sick they're always at\nthe doctor they always have to go get\nsomething with them\nthey're literally causing their sickness\nit happens all the time\nand people do this and they don't\nrealize it so what happens is sometimes\nsomeone goes to a doctor they're\nperfectly healthy you know they maybe\nthey get sick and then they get stuck on\noh my gosh i'm sick and then they think\ni'm sick i'm sick i'm sick and it\ncontinues to keep going and going going\nand what happens is with their thoughts\nthey get worse and they get worse and\nthey get worse i know somebody who's\nliterally been sick for 20 years\n20 years why because they won't get off\nof the thought of there's something\nwrong with me and i am always sick\ntheir thoughts are creating the sickness\ninside of their body we all know someone\nlike this you might be the person who's\nlike this so obviously with all of the\nstuff that's happening in the world\nright now this is pretty important isn't\nit for us to realize oh my god so if i'm\nthinking that i'm healthy if i'm\nthinking that there is no way that i'm\ngoing to get sick i am actually building\nup my immune system and all systems in\nmy brain and body to help me fight off\nwhatever might be out there in the world\nbut if i am sitting in a state of fear\nand i'm constantly watching the news and\ni'm constantly hearing about this bad\nthing and this bad thing and this bad\nthing and this bad thing i'm putting\nmyself into a negative state i'm putting\nmyself into a fearful state i'm putting\nmyself into a sick state which then\nmeans that i am actually lowering my\nrespiratory system lowering my immune\nsystem lowering my endocrine system\nlowering all of these my digestive\nsystem all these different systems\nmaking more me more susceptible to get\nwhatever it is hey if you're enjoying\nthis video do me a favor and hit that\nlike button down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you so let's\ndive into this\nif you can heal yourself with your own\nmind if you can make yourself sick with\nyour own mind what else can you do with\nyour own mind if your mind can literally\nmake you healthier\nor make you sicker\nthen what else can it do for us\nthis is a pretty interesting question\nmaybe we should dive into and start to\nthink about it\nif it can make us healthy and if it can\nmake us sick that means that it can\nliterally create whatever it is that we\nwant to in this world what does it mean\nthe world is literally your playground i\nwant you to remember this the world\neverything around you all of it is your\nplayground you can either decide to play\nor you can either decide to be afraid of\nwhat could possibly happen your mind is\nthe one that's in charge of that\nplayground so the problem is most people\ndon't act like they're in charge most\npeople act like you know life is just a\nset of circumstances that are coming at\nthem and they're just constantly trying\nto dodge them and not get smacked in the\nface you know what a lot of the visual\nthat comes into my head one of my\nfavorite my favorite videos or favorite\nthings to do is there's a uh\nthere's\ninstagram called kids getting hurt that\ni follow i don't it's it's sick and\ntwisted sorry but it's funny as hell uh\nand so you guys ever seen those things\nwhere the kids are playing and there's a\nthere's that spinning thing that comes\naround it's like this big padded softed\nbat basically and kids are trying to\ndodge this bat and then eventually it\nhits them that's basically what people\nare living their life like they're just\ntrying to dodge all of the set of\ncircumstances that life is quote unquote\nthrowing at them\nand they're not actually taking control\nof it and trying to stop that and take\ncontrol of the actual thing that's\nspinning around with the padding on it\nright\nthey don't think that they're creating\ntheir reality what they think is that\nthey're just trying to put out fires\nthey're just dealing with sets of\ncircumstances that come at that but if\nyou can go okay\ni'm gonna step into a place of power i'm\ngonna realize that i'm creating my\nreality and i'm creating my reality one\nthought at a time if you think that\nyou're going to be sick\nyou're going to be sick if you think\nthat you're going to be healthy you're\ngoing to be healthy if you think that\nyou are broken then you are broken if\nyou think that you are healed then you\nare healed if you think that you're\ngoing to be successful with every single\ncell in your body all 50 trillion of\nthem you will eventually get to success\nif you think i know that i am going to\nfind ultimate peace in my life and joy\nand happiness and love and you believe\nit with all 50 trillion cells in your\nbody then you\nwill eventually do it\nyou will\nand you have to realize when you look\ninto the mirror\nyou are looking not when i look in the\nmirror i don't see rob dial\nwhat i see is a collective of 50\ntrillion cells that make up rob dial and\nthere is one central voice behind those\n50 trillion cells telling it what to do\nwhat is it my thoughts my consciousness\nand i'm trying to tap in and go okay let\nme see if there's a possibility that i\ncan control these things i realize it\nsounds out there it sounds crazy but\nthen when you start to really think\nabout it you hear about this placebo\neffect you go oh sh\nthis might actually be true\nit's showing a clinical trial said it's\ntrue there's statistics there's\nthousands of papers on this thing\nmaybe it actually is true maybe it does\nexist maybe\nwhatever i think i am\ni am\nthat's interesting\nyour life will in in your life you will\nbecome whatever you think that you are\nand you will become whatever you think\nthat you will become\nso how do we change our body\nwe change our thoughts\nabout our body how do we change our\nlives we change our thoughts about our\nlives how do we change our circumstances\nwe change our thoughts about our\ncircumstances how do we change every\nsingle aspect of everything that's going\non in our lives we change our thoughts\naround it if you can sit there and look\nat somebody who is able to cure\ncardiovascular issues through their mind\nclearly the mind's powerful if you can\nsee people who have clearly cured\nthemselves from diseases terminal\ndiseases i mean we've all seen people\nwho the doctor gives them 30 days\nand they die on the 30th day we've heard\nthe stories about it we've also heard\npeople that are just like i'm not giving\nup and they're given 30 days and they\nlive for another seven years or they\njust completely cure themselves\nwhat's the difference the internal voice\ni have a really good friend who\nwho uh who battled cancer a few years\nago and he had a 95 chance of dying\nsay that again 95 chance of dying he had\na 5 success rate that's the statistics\nacross every it's a only males can get\nthis uh cancer it's not testicular\ncancer but it's another type of cancer\nonly males get and he had a five percent\nchance of of living and i said what do\nyou think what do you what do you think\nmade you live he said what made me live\nwas that i meditated every single\nmorning and tried to get the central\nvoice inside of me to know that i am not\ngoing to die from this i am not going to\ngive up no matter how hard it seems he\nhas a wife and two young children and he\nis like i am not going to leave the\nplanet it's not happening this cancer's\nnot going to take me out i'm going to\nfreaking succeed\nwhat happened he ended up beating it\nit doesn't exist in his body anymore did\nhe go through some hell he went through\nsome hell for about a year but guess\nwhat he went to the doctor last time i\nsaw him the doctor actually called him\nand said hey there is we don't see\nanything inside of your body that shows\nthat you have cancer anymore\nand he says what did he do as soon as he\nfound out he had it he made the decision\nhe was going to beat it and he put every\nounce of energy he said my full-time job\nwent from my full-time job to my\nfull-time job is healing from this and\ni'm going to make sure that it happens\nso if you're out there and you have\nsomething that's going on in your life\nwhether it is something serious like\nthis whether it is an illness whether it\nis you know uh\nwhatever going on in your life it could\nbe getting you know terrible life\ncircumstances all these things that are\nhappening\nmaybe we can try to fix it with our\nthoughts maybe showing that one third of\nmedical healing has come from the\nplacebo effect we can actually heal\nourselves in worst case scenario it's\ngonna make it a whole hell of a lot\nbetter if we're believing and putting\nevery ounce of energy into healing and\ngetting better versus every ounce of\nenergy into worrying about how sick we\nare or worrying about what's wrong in\nour life or worrying about these\nrelationships that aren't going the\nright way if we decide\ni'm going to take full ownership full\ncontrol of my life my life is going to\nchange\nit's crazy\nit's crazy\nnobody talks about it but one third of\nall the medical healings come from\npeople healing themselves in their mind\nbut then also the other side this other\nside of the fence is the no sibo people\nmake themselves more sick by what\nthey're thinking so i want you to think\nof this and i want you to think back in\nyour life and i want you to think of\nwhat type of person are you are you the\ntype of person that when something comes\nup when circumstances that aren't the\nway that you want to come up are you the\ntype of person that's like oh man what\nwas me poor me victim mentality look\nit's happened to me again it always\nhappens to me or i'm always broke or i'm\nalways losing money or this is always\nhappening to me are you that type of\nperson or are you the type of person's\nlike okay\nchallenge is here challenge accepted i'm\ngoing to figure out i'm going to do\neverything that i possibly can to get\npast this challenge and i'm not going to\nnot succeed i'm going to figure out a\nway to do it which person are you\nbecause your mind\nin my opinion\nis the most powerful thing in the entire\nuniverse\nbut the real question is are you using\nyour mind against you or are you using\nyour mind to your advantage you can\nliterally create heaven on earth or you\ncan create hell on earth and all of\nthose are created through your thoughts\nso i want you to think about that and i\nwant to leave you with this one question\nif you can create anything that you want\nto in this world and you're fully 100 in\ncontrol of it\nwhat do you\nwant to create\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well have\nyou ever felt like i can't fully allow\nmyself to be in this moment because\nthere is a chance that one day it's\ngoing to be gone\n[Music]"
