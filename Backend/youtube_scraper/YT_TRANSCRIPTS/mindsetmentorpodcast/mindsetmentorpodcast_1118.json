want to help\nyou with six pillars to create the best\nmind that you possibly can number one\nyou have to take a cold shower every\nsingle day yes it's the one that\neverybody dreads but it's the most\nimportant and the reason why is because\nwe get to conquer that little voice\ninside of our heads number two work out\nevery single day we had people that lost\n10 20 30 50 even 70 pounds last

ironmind30.com\nright now today as i said we're going to\ntalk about the number one thing that i\nrecommend that you do to make this year\nthe absolute best year of your life\ndo you want to know what it is develop\nyour willpower make your mind your body\nyour resilience your motivation in your\ndrive the strongest thing in your life\nso many people look up to other people\nand say oh man i wish i was motivated as\nthis person i wish i was driven as this\nperson do you want to know where that\ncomes from it's developed it's like a\nmuscle willpower is like a muscle to be\nable to go you know what i don't feel\nlike doing this but i know what i want\nmy life to be so i'm going to do it\nanyways i don't care what i feel like\ni'm going to do it anyways that is what\nwillpower is to have a goal of what you\nwant to work for to figure out what that\nis and to work at it no matter the\ncircumstances of each day no matter how\nyou feel each day it's to do it even\nwhen you don't want to do it\nand if you've been listening my podcast\nfor a while\nyou know i'm very big proponent on doing\nwhat you don't want to do why\nbecause if we're being honest we're all\npretty soft let's be honest like we're\nsoft if we think about our ancestors and\nall the stuff that our ancestors had to\ngo through compared to us we're freaking\nsoft we live in air-conditioned\nbuildings heated buildings we have our\nfood that we just walk into stores and\nget we don't have to hunt and gather and\nforage we don't have any battles that\nwe're really going to war with every\nsingle day we don't have to worry most\nof us about somebody walking into our\nhouse and trying to take our land from\nus every single day we are soft and we\ncan admit that can't we\nbut\nit doesn't mean that we can't build up\nthe resilience what it means is that\nwe've built up our softness\nand so we need to develop this mind this\niron mind this mindset of i'm going to\ndo it anyways because i know what i'm\ngoing to do and a soft mind and a soft\nbody does not change the world a soft\nmind and soft body does not change their\nown life and a soft mind and a soft body\ndoes not change their family's life\ntheir community's life and their loved\nones lives at all and so it's up to us\nthe responsibility is up to us to make a\nchange\nyou know i saw a meme the other day and\ni've seen it many times i used to\nactually show it in presentations and\nit's this guy and it's a cartoon\nhe looks like he's a politician and he\nsays who wants change and you can see\nthe little bubble coming out of his\nmouth who wants change and everybody in\nthe crowd raises their hand and it's\nlike yeah everybody wants change and\nthen he says who wants to change and the\nvery next picture the cartoon right\nafter he says who wants to change\neverybody's hands are down because\neverybody wants something done for them\nbut they don't want to get off their ass\nand actually do it if you're listening\nto this podcast if my little bit\nhardcore\nsay it as it is\nappeals to you then you're probably the\ntype of person that's like i'm going to\ngo and get it i don't care i'm going to\nconquer myself right i'm going to\ndevelop the mind that i need to to get\nwhat i want in life and to impact the\nworld and ultimately what it comes down\nto is a comfort zone the last thing that\ni want to be stuck in going into 2021 is\n2020's comfort zone i don't want any of\n2020 to come into 2021 with me i don't\nknow about you 2020 was actually a\npretty good year for me i enjoyed a lot\nof it for a lot of people it wasn't very\ngood and that's okay but it doesn't mean\nthat 2020 needs to carry on it means\nthat we need to cut ties with it we need\nto break free from it and we need to go\nwhat do i want you know this year was\ngreat for me this year wasn't great for\nme this year was okay for me\nbut next year is my year\nand i am going to figure out a way to\nget it done to succeed to get what i\nwant no matter the circumstances i'm\ngonna get it once again what is that\nit's the willpower to do what you don't\nwant to do to get out of your comfort\nzone and the way i always like to\nexplain a comfort zone that makes sense\nto a lot of people is this\nif you think of a rubber band if i had a\nrubber band in my hand and i'm pulling\nthe rubber band apart that's you\nstretching yourself stretching yourself\noutside of your comfort zone\nand i can't tell you how many people\nreach out to me and the number one thing\ni hear from people who reach out to me\nis hey rob i'm really good at starting\nstuff on my challenges and my goals and\ntrying to go through but i'm really bad\nat finishing what should i do about\nfinishing that's one of the main things\nthat i hear from people is i'm really\ngood at starting i get really excited\nthat i never finish anything so i never\nget my goals hit i don't make the money\nthat i wanted of the life that i want\nbecause i don't finish anything that i\nactually start the reason why is because\nif you think of a rubber band if you're\npulling it people will pull themselves\nand pull themselves and pull themselves\nand stretch their comfort zone and\nstretch it for three days four days five\ndays six days ten days and then what\nhappens they start shrinking back they\nstart doing\nthe things that got them in the\ncomforters in the first place they start\nsleeping in they stop going to the gym\nthey stop\nreading the books they stop meditating\nthey stop eating healthy they go back to\ndrinking whatever it is and slowly but\nsurely that rubber band goes back to the\nsame size because we start to fall back\nin our old habits\nwhat do you need to do\nyou need to break it\nthat's what you need to do you need to\nbreak your comfort zone you need to\nbreak the rubber band so if you pull a\nrubber band long enough left further far\nenough and you keep pulling and pulling\nand pulling and pulling and pulling\neventually it's going to snap\nthat's what we're trying to do we're\ntrying to pull ourselves for so long\noutside of our comfort zone and pull and\npull and pull every single day and be\nconsistent and\npull until\nwe've broken out of our comfort zone and\nwe've created a new version of ourselves\nthat's what we're trying to work towards\nthat's what we're trying to build we're\ntrying to consistently push ourselves\nevery single day that's the value into\nit we're trying to bring a brand new\ncomfort zone into 2021 that doesn't look\nany like anything like any other comfort\nzone we've ever had because it's so much\nbigger and so much more expansive and we\nas a person are so much better than we\nhave ever been\nand the thing that i think that most\npeople need to think about\nis a phrase to do what you don't want to\ndo\ni love it to wake up and to eat the frog\nwhat does that mean if you've never\nheard the phrase eat the frog what it is\nis there's one thing\nat least one thing but there's always\none thing every single day that you have\nto do that you don't want to frickin do\nthat you're dreading doing and you\ndefinitely don't want to do it and what\ndo they say eat that frog first thing in\nthe morning eat the frog\nbecause who would want to eat a frog\nnobody wants to eat a frog so if you\nthink of it that way of like i'm going\nto eat this frog this thing that is\nstaring at me i'm going to just say you\nknow what\npop it in my mouth i'm going for it baby\ni'm going to eat that frog this is the\nbenefit of doing the things that you\ndon't want to do to push yourself a\nlittle bit more a little bit more a\nlittle bit more a little bit more a\nlittle bit more over and over and over\nand over and over again\nand that's the reason why you're going\nto be outside of your comfort zone and\nto do what you don't want to do the\nperfect example for me is i hate cold\nshowers if you follow me on instagram if\nyou don't you need to follow me on\ninstagram rob dial junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r\nyou've seen my instagram stories lately\ni've been outside of my 40-degree pool\nwhen it's 35 degrees outside it's cold\nas hell and i've been sitting there for\n15\n16 17 minutes inside of that pool it's\nnot because i'm weird and sadistic and\ni'm like i'm gonna torture myself today\nno it's because i don't want to do it\nand i know that the voice that's saying\nhey man don't go in the pool today\nis the same voice that says hey man\nsleep in today hey man don't go to the\ngym hey have that extra slice of pizza\nhey don't eat this out hey you know\nthat's that little voice that pops up\neverywhere my job\nevery single day is to literally conquer\nthat inner voice the funny thing about\nthe whole iron mind challenge i was\ntelling you about the beginning here\nis that the number one thing that people\nare most afraid of is the cold showers\nwhat the hell it's literally just\ngetting your your naked body into a cold\nshower just cold water on your skin will\nyou die\nno but that's the funny thing about the\nlittle voice inside of your head is it\nbuilds it up as if it's this big\nmonstrous thing that's going to kill you\nand in reality it's literally you versus\nyou your entire life everything\nthat you do\nis a battle of you versus you\nyou the person that wants to build the\nlife that you want and you on the other\nside that's trying to hold yourself in\nyour comfort zone because you've been\nthere for so long it's you versus you\nit's not you versus a government or you\nversus the president or you versus you\nknow what your parents said when you\nwere younger or what your teacher said\nor what you were raised with no it's\nnever anybody else outside of you it's\nyou versus you it will be for the rest\nof your life and it always has been your\nentire life so if you're not in the\nposition that you want to be in your\nlife right now it's because the view\nthat's holding you back has been holding\nyou back and you've been listening too\nmuch to it that to it too much if you\nare where you want to be it's because\nyou've been conquering that little voice\nconquering that little inside of\nyou that's the thing it's so funny how\nmany people are like oh yeah i would\njoin the iron mind challenge but i just\ndon't want to take the cold showers well\nthat's because we've come too soft right\nit's literally just a cold shower\nthere's obviously a lot of physical\nbenefits for it you can google it of how\ngood it is for your cardiovascular\nsystem for your skin for so many\ndifferent things there's a lot of\nbenefits to that but on the other side\nthe reason why i really like it besides\nall of those things is because the\nbattle of my life is me versus me it's\nalways been me versus me it will always\nbe me versus me and so i'm going to wake\nup every single day and either take a\ncold shower or jump in my freezing cold\npool\nand the reason why is because i'm trying\nto conquer that little voice inside of\nmy head and i don't want to do it that's\nwhy i do it\nthat's the crazy part it makes sense but\nat the same time you're like this is\ncrazy the reason why you do it is\nbecause you don't want to do it\nthat's why it's really not hard it's not\nscientific and this big huge thing where\nyou got to break it down no it's so\nsimple there's two sides of you that are\nalways a battle like i said there's a\nyou that wants this amazing life and a\nlot of money and a lot of happiness and\nsuccess and traveling and\ngiving your kids everything that you\nnever had and all of this joy and peace\nand love that you want in your life\nthere's that side of you that wants to\nto bring out your full potential to the\nworld and there's the other side of you\nthat you can't get to shut up\nand what do we need to do we need to\nwake up every single day and do what we\ndon't want to do to make that little\nvoice that's holding us back diminished\na little bit every single day a little\nbit every single day a little bit every\nsingle day and when you wake up in the\nmorning and you have something like that\nit's a win and when you can start your\nday off with a win it builds so much\nmomentum into everything else you know\nif there's something that i don't want\nto do in my business or i don't want to\ndo\nyou know anywhere\nif i've woken up and i've jumped inside\nof a cold pore i've jumped inside of a\ncold shower and i've conquered that the\nrest of the day is easy i've got\nmomentum on my side that's the beautiful\nthing about it and so that's what i want\nyou to realize there's always two sides\nof you there's a side of you that's like\nthat wants greatness and there's a side\nof you that's comfortable there's the\nside of you that that wants to get out\nof bed and have a beautiful morning\nroutine and there's a side of you it's\nlike damn this bed is so comfortable\nmaybe i should sleep in a little bit and\nstart tomorrow there's the side of you\nthat wants to go to the gym and there's\na side of you it's like damn pizza\nsounds good there's a side of you that\nwants to go out and create the success\nthat you want to that's what you can\nsupport your family at a higher level\nand then there's a side of you that's\nlike well maybe i should stay on\ninstagram for the whole day right so\nthere's two sides of you constantly a\nbattle which one are you going to let\nwin because ultimately whichever one\nwins is going to dictate what your life\nis going to be\nand if you've been listening to the show\nlong enough you know that my number one\nfear is to get to end of my life be on\nmy deathbed and wish that i would have\ndone more that i would have helped more\npeople that i would have pulled out more\npotential that i would have had more\nhappiness more joy more peace\nyou know that's what my biggest fear is\nand so i'm working to bring out the the\ngreatness inside of me every single day\ndo i win every single day not every\nsingle day\nbut the majority of days i win and i\nchalk that up as a win and so that's the\nreason why you've got to work towards\nconsistency of doing the things that you\ndon't want to do every single day to\nmake that little voice that's inside of\nyour head diminished\nyou've got to listen you've got to\nlisten you've got to listen your life is\ndictated by the actions that you take\nand the one the way you do one thing is\nthe way you do everything so if you're\nafraid of jumping into a cold shower\nyou're probably afraid of other little\ntiny things inside of your life if\nyou're coming up short on your workouts\nyou're probably coming up short in your\nrelationships if you're coming up short\nin the workouts you're also probably\ncoming up short in your business in your\nfinances and everything else\nand so for me\nwhat i try to do is just try to build\nthe resilience up of i'm going to create\nthe life that i want\nand in order to do that i've got to\ndevelop discipline i've got to have a\nwillpower that will just run through a\nfreaking wall no matter what\nand believe me i wasn't born with it i'm\nstill working at it i'm way better than\ni ever have been and i'm getting better\nevery single day at it but i want you to\nstart thinking about yourself start\nthinking about the way you do one thing\nis the way you do everything where are\nyou coming up short where are you\nstaying in your comfort zone where are\nyou not showing up fully where are you\ngiving up too early because if you're\ndoing that you're also do in one place\nin your life you're doing it everywhere\nin your life\nand that's going to make everything in\nyour life not as good as it could be\nso it's something to think about\nsomething to dive into it's something to\nreally be serious about and say where do\ni need to develop\nthe willpower in my life\nand start identifying little pieces of\nyour life little places where you could\nshow up better\nmaybe you listen to me talk and you're\nlike\nyeah this cold shower thing sounds like\nit sucks but it does kind of make some\nsense believe me it makes sense the\nfunny thing about these iron mine\nchallenges is at the end of it at the\nbeginning of it everyone freaking hates\nit they resent it they're pissed off\nit's the hardest thing for them is to\njust do a freaking cold shower for a\nminute or two\nby the end of it they're like that was\none of the most life-changing things\ni've ever done because every day i was\nworking at conquering my mind and so\nevery time that little voice came in and\nsaid hey man don't jump in the shower no\none's going to know i had to click off\nmy willpower brain and say no thank you\ni'm going anyways\nand that's what we're trying to do\nbecause that's the same voice that pops\nup and says hey sleep in you're like no\nscrew you i'm getting up the one that\nsays hey don't go make the extra cold\ncalls you're like screw you i'm gonna go\ndo it anyways the one that says hey\ndon't go you know knock on those doors\nand do some some sales it's snowing\noutside and like screw you i'm gonna put\non my boots i'm gonna go out i'm gonna\ndo it anyways that's what life is it's\nthe internal battle of you versus you\nwillpower and discipline versus comfort\nzone the question is\nwhich one are you going to listen to\nbecause it will ultimately dictate where\nyour life is going to be\nand i hope\ni hope i hope that you don't get to that\nin your life and wish that you would\nhave done more because then you can look\nback and go\nyeah\ni see where i should have been a little\nbit more disciplined i see where i\nshould have had more willpower see how\nmy family's life would have been better\nif i would have stepped\nup\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well the\nlittle voice in my head i like to call\nit the little oh there's that\nlittle guy nice try today cute oh i'm\nnot gonna listen to you cute little guy\ni'm gonna put you over there in the\ncorner\nhow often does that voice hold my\nlisteners back"
