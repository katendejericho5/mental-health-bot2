should have kids by now i\nshould have a house i should go to\ncollege i'm here to ask you who told you\nthat\nbecause\nif you think about it there is no real\nshould\nthere is no real life path there is no\npath to success there is no this is\nexactly the way that life should be all\nof the time and if you follow this\nyou're going to be happy and successful\nand peaceful and joyful and i'm here to\nask you who the hell have you been\ngetting [ __ ] on by\nhave you thought about that\nis it your parents is it society is it\nyour family is it your spouse is it\npeople that you're close to is it your\nfriends\nbecause you have to ask yourself is this\nwhat i truly want my life to be or are\njust other people shooting all over me\nand i'm just accepting it and saying\nthat's how i'm going to live my life so\nwhere did your should come from where\ndid it come from\nright that should that's stressing you\nout because stress comes from where we\nshould be where we think we should be\nwhat we should be doing your shoulds are\nstressing you out\nyou have to realize that and have you\never stopped and just thought like okay\nif i feel like i should be married by\nnow where did i learn that who told me\nthat could have been one person that\ntold it to you and you could have heard\nit over and over and over and over again\nyour entire life by society by the\nmagazines by instagram whatever it is\nbut who told you that and who told you\nthat were you eventually you know what\nyeah i accept it that is exactly what i\nthink that i should be doing at this\npoint i do\nthink that i should be married by 22\nyears old happy and have my life figured\nout by 23.\nkids\ncars house millionaire by 25. who told\nyou all of these things\nand is it the life that you actually\ntruly want\nor are you just kind of lost up in all\nof the shoulds that you've heard your\nentire life and you don't even know what\nyou really truly want have you even\ngiven thought to what you want\nnot what you think that you should do\nbased off of other people's perceptions\nor what they say that you should do\nand not just why am i thinking this\nbut why do i feel this way\nwhy do i feel like this is where i\nshould be right so where did your should\ncome from where are the different\nshoulds i mean there's a million\ndifferent shows but let me tell you some\nof the ones that i've thought of okay\nyou should be in a relationship right\nnow really\ni'm curious who gave you that [ __ ] who\nshould on you\nyou should be married by now okay who\ngave you that [ __ ] who should on you you\nshould be a doctor you should be a\nlawyer\nyou should go down this life path you\nshould go to this school\nyou should go and get this degree really\nwho told you that should who should all\nover you\nyou should make a certain amount of\nmoney really who told you that who [ __ ]\nall over you you should have a house\nreally who told you that who's [ __ ] all\nover you you should have kids by now you\nshould be married by now you should be\nsaving\nreally\nokay\nwho told you that who's [ __ ] all over\nyou\nbecause what you realize you're starting\nto build a life that isn't even the life\nthat you actually truly want you should\ngo the safe route yeah that sounds like\na whole hell of a lot of fun let me get\na safe route in life one thing that\nwe've learned in 2020 is that the safe\nroute isn't safe at all actually the\nsafe route the quote unquote safe route\nis actually the scariest route because\nwhen you work for somebody else\nthey can always change their mind at any\npoint in time that doesn't sound safe to\nme but if you're your own boss that\nsounds a lot safer to me because nobody\ncan fire you and your own boss\nthink about that you should\ngo to school\nyou should go to college\nreally\nwhy is that can you give me proof of why\nsomebody should go to college are the\nmost successful people the ones who go\nto college no absolutely not are people\nwho make the most money the ones that go\nto college no statistics actually say no\nthat's not true\nother people have the biggest businesses\nthe ones who went to college nope that's\nactually not true so why would you go\nthat route\nis it because somebody told you that you\nshould get out because of what you feel\nlike you should do\nright\nyou should believe in all of the exact\nsame things that your parents believe in\nyour parents religion you should believe\nin that your parents you know political\nreviews you should political views you\nshould believe in that\nwhat are the other things that you\nshould believe in you should think\nexactly the same that i think have you\never heard a parent say that to you\nbefore you should do this because your\nparents tell you that you should you\nshould do this because your parents\nthink that you should you should think\nthat way because your parents have\nalways thought that way who told you all\nof these things and who told you that\nthat's what you should do\nthat's something to think about most\npeople they they know their shoulds but\nthey have no idea whether what\nnumber one they have no idea where their\nshirts came from\nand they don't know why\ntheir shoulds were actually told to them\nif you're really true to think about a\nlot of the shits that people are\nactually telling other people are their\nown\npersonal problems being thrown onto them\ntheir own personal views of the way that\nthe world should be\nyou know oh i didn't i didn't i wasn't\nable to go to school to be a doctor so\nyou should go to school and be a doctor\nbecause i'm trying to give you\nopportunities that i never had right you\nshould be happier really\nuh\nlet's go ahead and review that most\npeople are still trying to figure it out\nand guess what that's completely okay\nyou know you should follow what you're\ntold to do you should have a bigger\nbusiness you should quit your job you\nshould you know do whatever it is that\nsociety tells you to do that's what you\nshould do now i want you to think about\nthat if you go back through everything\nthat i said of you should be married if\nyou should be have kids all of these\nshoulds\nif you really boil it down what they all\nare are societal constructs and a\nconstruct is not something that truly\nexists it's just something that is\nfabricated that you know you can't hold\na construct you can't hold on to when\nyou should be married you can't hold on\nto when you should have children you\ncan't hold on to the shoulds they're all\nconstructs and something that a\nconstruct is is something that is made\nup by other people and what's really\ninteresting is that we are unconsciously\nfollowing societal and social constructs\nthat are made up by people that are no\nsmarter than you and i\nwhich means that you might be following\na social or societal construct that was\nmade up a hundred years ago by somebody\nwho might have been even less\nintelligent than you but you're still\nfollowing it because you're just\nfollowing it blindly because that's what\nyou've always done that's what you've\nalways known well at some point in time\nyou wake up and you go no this isn't\nwhat i want i want to do something\ndifferent i don't want my life to be\nthat i want my life to be something\ndifferent than it currently is\nwhat do we call that a lot of people\nthis is a midlife crisis you wake up\nyou're 40 you're 45 years old you're\nlike what the [ __ ] has my life become\nthis isn't what i wanted\nand then you realize you followed a\nbunch of shoulds\nyou should\nfinish high school and go down that\nroute you should go to college even\nthough you don't want to you should go\nfor that degree even though you want to\ndo something different because that one\nmakes more money you should get married\nyou know to your high school suites or\nsweetheart you should have 2.5 kids you\nshould buy a house you should have two\ncars you should go into debt and put\nstuff on credit cards if you can't\nafford it you should try to keep up with\nthe joneses and then you wake up one day\nand you're like\nwhose life am i living\nand you go oh my god i'm living somebody\nelse's life i'm not even living the life\nthat i truly want hey if you're enjoying\nthis video do me a favor and hit that\nlike button down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you\ni was on a zoom call just a little while\nago and one of the things that really\nstood out to me with a lot of people\nthat were on the zoom call is they\ndidn't even know what they want they've\nbeen living other people's lives for so\nlong that they don't even know what they\nwant anymore\nthey have no idea and they're starting\nto try to re-figure out what it would be\nlike to dream again what it would be\nlike to start following their own path\nwhat it would be like to go you know\nwhat i want to do what i want to do\nbut damn\nwhat do i want to do it's been so long\nsince i've thought about what i want and\nthought about myself versus thinking\nabout other people that i don't even\nknow how to get to that point and it's\nit's like a muscle you just got to keep\ntrying keep trying keep trying\neventually you're going to start\nfiguring out what it is that you want\nright\nhere's what i have to say\nif it isn't hurting anyone else you\nshould do whatever you want to do\nit's the truth if it isn't hurting\nanybody else you should do whatever it\nis that you want to do is it selfish no\nit's self-preservation is what it is\nsome people go oh yeah but that's\nselfish to only do what you want to do\nno because here's the thing that i know\nis when somebody does goes down the life\npath that they truly want to\nthey become the best versions of\nthemself and if they're the best\nversions of themself guess what they\nimpact everyone else's life around them\nat a much much higher and deeper level\nso is it selfish to do exactly what it\nis that you want to do no it's actually\nmore selfless because you're doing what\nyou want to do and at the same time you\nshow up as a better version of yourself\nhere's what i know and i'll speak for my\nown personal experience\nwhen i was working jobs that i hated i\nwas freaking miserable\nand guess who how i showed up for my\nfamily for my girlfriend for my friends\ni showed up as a lesser quality of who i\ncurrently am but when i found out what\nit is that i wanted to do and i started\nfollowing my life path i started growing\ni started getting better i started\ngetting more enthusiastic and more\npassionate about my life and just life\nin general i have been able to take that\npassion and help other people with their\npassion as well and be able to motivate\nmy mom and my girlfriend and my friends\nand everyone else that's around me to be\nthe better version of themself so what's\ninteresting is my quote-unquote being\nselfish as some people would say\nactually helped other people so is it\nselfish no it's self-preservation it's\ndoing what you want to do as long as\nyou're not helping anybody else\ni'm going to tell you a really unpopular\nopinion i don't give a [ __ ] about what\nyour mom wants\ni don't care what your dad wants about\nwhat society wants about what anybody\nelse wants around you i don't care about\nwhere you should be you know i don't\ncare about how much money you make i\ndon't care if you're single i don't care\nif you're divorced i don't care if\nyou're religious i don't care if you're\nnot religious i don't care what you do\nwhat you don't do all i care about is\nthis one thing\ndo what you truly feel like you should\ndo if it's not hurting other people\nand it's what you truly want to do and\nit makes your soul feel like it's coming\nalive then it is what you should do\ni see so many people come through and\ni've worked with them and helped them\nand spoke with them or gotten message\nfrom them\nwhere they've built a life that they\ntruly didn't want and now they feel\nstuck\nif you're in that position\njust know this you're not fully stuck\nyou never are fully stuck\nyou're not\nbut\nwhat i will tell you is this\nyou can slowly start to unravel the life\nthat you've built and build it into life\nthat you want i've seen many people do\nthis over and over and over and over and\nover and over and over again it is\npossible for you is it going to be easy\nno it absolutely will not be easy i\npromise you that one\nbut\nit'll be worth it and you will benefit\nfrom it and everyone around you will\nbenefit from it as well\nif you don't feel like you're fully\ncaught in a life that you can't get out\nof at this point well then you actually\nhave an easier more of an easier route\nand that route is figure out what it is\nthat you want throw everything else to\nthe side or start to unwind yourself\nfrom those things and do what it is that\nyou truly want and how do you know it is\nwhat you truly want to do here's how i\nknow that is what you truly want to do\nis you don't feel anxious about it you\ndon't feel fear about it you might feel\nnervous that's not the same as fear but\nyou but what happens is there's\nsomething inside of you that goes\noh yes\nas we talked about a couple episodes ago\nit's the full yes it's the oh my god i'm\nso excited if you feel that nervousness\nand that excited and you immediately\nwant to jump up and do that thing that\nyou are talking about that you're\nthinking about in your head that's\nprobably a thing that you should do and\nthen what's going to happen there's a\npart of you is going to click in and go\nyeah but that's not realistic\nthat is societal pressures who says\nsomething's realistic or not realistic\nif you want to go through\nand have your own mind blown just go\nthrough and find the people who have\nsucceeded late in life if you don't know\npeople who have succeeded late in life\ni'll give you a few different examples\nyou know stan lee the guy who created\nmarvel comics didn't even catch his\nfirst big break until his 40 years old\nvera wang who has obviously a massive\ncompany didn't even get into the fashion\nindustry not even start very well but\ndidn't even get into the fashion\nindustry until she was in her 40s right\nsamuel jackson didn't get his first job\nas an actor until he was 46 years old\nright there's many different types of\npeople henry ford didn't get his first\ncar released until he was 45 years old\ncharles darwin was 50 years old when he\npublished his first book and his list\ngoes on and on and on and on and on\nyou're never too late the only thing\nthat you have to do is you have to tell\nyourself i have to start that's what i\nhave to do and the thing that i want you\nto take from this is that your job is to\nbuild the life that you want not the\nlife that other people want to do your\njob is to build the life that you are\npassionate about your job is to find\nyour passion if you don't know what it\nis it's okay to not know what your\npassion is at this moment it's\ncompletely okay but it's not okay to not\nbe in constant pursuit to find out what\nyour passion is if you don't know what\nis this point when you do find it it is\nonly okay to be in constant pursuit for\nthat passion because when you go after\nyour passion you do what you truly want\nto do you stop listening to what people\ntell you that you should do you fully\ncome alive and when you fully come alive\nyou open up the doors for other people\naround you people that you're close to\nto fully come alive as well\nso stop shooting all of yourself with\nall the things that you think that you\nshould be doing do you want to know what\nyou should be doing you should be doing\nwhat you're here on this planet to do\nbut you\nneed to figure out what that is\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click
