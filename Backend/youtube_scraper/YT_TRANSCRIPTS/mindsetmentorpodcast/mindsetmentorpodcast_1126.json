    "transcript": "have you ever felt like i can't fully\nallow myself to be in this moment\nbecause there is a chance that one day\nit's going to be gone\n[Music]\ntoday i'm gonna ask you a question to\nstart off and that question is this do\nyou secretly\nexpect bad things to happen to you when\nthings are going really well is there a\npart of you that feels like\ni better not hold on to this feeling too\nlong or get too into this feeling of joy\nor happiness because i'm afraid that\nsomething is going to happen that's\ngoing to be bad right around the corner\nand if i if i allow myself to feel that\nfeeling of joy and happiness and i do\nget hit with something bad then it's\ngoing to be even a further fall do you\nfeel that way\nthe reason why i'm bringing this up is\nbecause two different events that i had\nrun this week people mentioned it i had\na mastermind event over the course of\nthree days we ran an event and people\nwere talking about how\nno matter how well things are going for\nthem they still feel like at some point\nin time something wrong is going to\nhappen and they can't fully be present\nthey can't fully be in the moment\nand then another person in another\ncourse that i'm running about rewiring\nyour brain said that she feels like she\ntakes three steps forward and then one\nstep back and she wants to know how to\navoid the the one step back and i\nremember\nkind of hearing a story about this where\npeople who have children said that one\nof the the scariest things in the world\nto them is to watch them sleep because\nthey they can look at how peaceful and\namazing they are and they can love them\nbut then on the other side there's this\npiece of them that's like\nbut what if something happens\nwhat if\ni get too in love with this child and i\nlove them with everything that i have\nmore than i thought was even possible\nbut then i lose them\nand i want you to think about this if\nyou're out there have you ever felt that\nway with your children with your spouse\nyour boyfriend girlfriend parents\nhave you ever felt like i can't fully\nallow myself to be in this moment or in\nthis you know joy or in this happiness\nor in this love because there is a\nchance that one day it's going to be\ngone\nfor some reason a lot of people are just\nwaiting for the other shoe to drop\nthey're just waiting for something bad\nto happen and because of that they're\nnot fully expressed\nin the amount of joy that they possibly\ncould have and you can't be fully\npresent in any moment if there's a part\nof you that's outside of that moment\nsaying yeah but what if this isn't\nforever\nand imagine that imagine if you can't\nfully\nget to the amount of joy that you could\npossibly have every single day\nand\nthis doesn't happen with just certain\namounts of people or certain types of\npeople this happens people who are\nsuccessful unsuccessful happy unhappy\nand\npeople act as if it's the law of the\nuniverse like things have been going so\nwell for me for so long something bad\nhas to happen\nwho the hell says something bad ever has\nto happen\nthink about that for a second\nyou know i have a friend of mine that's\na great family friend and he comes from\na great family\nhe's got you know he's the first of six\nhe's got five kids that are under him\neverything's been great had an amazing\nlife but he says that there's he doesn't\nfeel like he can fully\nlove his life because he's afraid that\nsomething bad is going to happen because\nhe's had such a good life and he knows\nthat so many other people haven't had\ngreat lives that if they haven't had\ngreat lives and he's had such a great\nlife then it's going to be coming for\nhim at some point in time and if you're\nin that situation who told you that\nsomething bad always has to happen why\ndo people feel this way\nwhere does this come from\nreally what it comes from is from a\nmindset of scarcity of there is a not\nenough happiness there's not enough joy\nthere's not enough love in this world\nfor me to just fully experience it\nforever until the day i die there's not\nenough good to go around\nand eventually my luck is gonna run out\nbut why why does it have to run out why\ndoes it have to go bad\nwhoever said something had to go wrong\ndo you know what that is that something\nis programmed into you you have learned\nthat there's no child that i've ever met\nthat's like something's got to go wrong\nchildren don't worry about that what are\nthey they're fully in this moment and if\nchildren don't worry about it and we\nworry about it as adults doesn't that\nmean that it's been programmed into us\nin some sort of way where we take a few\nsteps forward and we're like oh my gosh\ni took i just took three steps forward\nsomething bad has to happen i know\nsomething bad has to happen\nthere has to be a step back\nand if there is a quote-unquote step\nback\nwho said that it was a step back\nyour perception you\nare the one that says that it's a step\nback\nbecause think about it this way\nit's all in your perception of if three\nthings happened that were really good\nand one thing happened that was quote\nunquote bad what if instead of it being\na step back it was just a redirection to\nget you on to the right path\nwhat if it was that\nyou know if you think about okay\ni'm trying to propel my life forward and\nto create something amazing in my life\nand i'm going one step two step three\nsteps and then i get pulled back i feel\nlike i'm getting pulled back like\nsomething is not working in the right\ndirection\ni want you to think of a bow and arrow\nif i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna try\nto hit a target with the bow and arrow\nin order for that arrow to go forward\nwhat does it have to do first\nit has to get pulled back\ni\nhave to pull that thing back\nand that's the only way that i can get\nthat that error to go forward isn't it\nit is that is something that is the law\nof the universe is that it has to be\npulled back in order to go forward\nhere's the interesting thing though the\nfurther the harder that i pull it back\nwhen i let go what's going to happen\nthe further that it's going to go\nforward\nso maybe when something quote-unquote\nbad happens to you a quote-unquote a\nstep back happens to you that's a bigger\nstep back than normal maybe that's the\nuniverse or god or whatever it is that's\nout there that's preparing to propel you\neven further\nbecause you needed to go through that\ngrowth maybe that growth of the quote\nunquote step back and what you're going\nto learn from it is actually what's\ngoing to be the thing that propels you\neven further forward but\nif you think of it as a step back and\nonly a step back and not a chance to\nlearn and grow and have something change\ninside of you\nwell then it's just a step back and\nthere are no steps forward\nit's like basically pulling the arrow\nback and then shooting it at the ground\nbut think about that maybe what's\nhappening in this quote-unquote step\nback\nis that you're needing it to pull back\nas far as you possibly can so that when\nyou do let go the universe god lets go\nwhatever it is that thing propels\nforward further than you could have\npossibly imagined\nso maybe it was never actually a step\nback maybe that's just the way to be\nprepared for the next venture that\nyou're stepping into\nand the other thing you have to realize\nis this is you get what you focus on the\nmost\nin one of the problems that i think most\npeople have is that they focus on what\nthey don't want or what they fear more\nthan they focus on what they truly do\nwant\nand so i want you to think about this as\ni'm speaking about this do you for focus\nmore on what you do want\nor focus more on what you don't want\ndo you focus more on things that are\ngoing to propel you forward\nor things that you're fearing are going\nto hold you back do you focus more on\nworry or do you focus more on happiness\nenjoy because whatever you focus on\nyou're going to get more of you're going\nto notice more of and if you listen this\npodcast for a while the easiest way to\nexplain it is this if over to the left i\nhave you know\none bed of flowers it's just seeds and\nover to the right i have another bed of\nflowers it's just seeds\nand i have one glass of water whichever\none i decide to water whether it's on\nthe left or the one on the right is\ngoing to grow from that water right so\nif i'm like okay i'm gonna go ahead and\nwater the ones on the right every single\nday and i'm not going to water the ones\non the left\nwhich ones are going to grow the ones on\nthe right\nso if you think of your energy and your\nfocus\nthe same as that water where i have over\nto the left my negativity my worries my\nfears the things that i really don't\nwant to happen in my life\nand over to the right i have my hopes my\ndreams my desires my joy my happiness\neverything that i want to happen and i\nhave my energy in a cup\nand i can pour it into one of these two\nflower beds\nwhich one am i wanting to pour it in\nwell obviously i want to pour it into\none on the right with my hopes dreams\ndesires everything that i truly want\nbut is that what i'm doing every single\nday is that what you're doing every\nsingle day\nbecause whichever one you water is the\none that's going to grow\nso\nwhich one are you watering every single\nday\nthink about that for a second\nwhere does your focus go on a daily\nbasis does it go into your hopes dreams\ndesires what you need to accomplish your\ndreams or does it go into your worries\nyour fears your anxieties the things\nthat stress you out because whatever you\npour your focus into is what's going to\ngrow and that's what you're going to get\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you it's the same way\nthat you know when you're learning to\nride a motorcycle and you're going into\nthe turn they tell you to look through\nthe turn what does that mean don't look\nyou know where it is that you're turning\nfrom what do you do you look at where\nyou're going\nbecause wherever you look is where\nyou're going to turn into\nand so if you're turning this corner and\nyou're looking at all of it that you\ndon't want in your life\nyou're going to get all that you don't\nwant your life that's the way it works\nbut if you turn into this corner and you\nlook at all the things your hopes your\ndreams desires and you set your\nintentions every single day for the\nthings that you truly want\nguess what you're more likely to get\nit's simple\nit's not easy it's simple one of my\nfavorite things that i see is i post a\nlot of quotes on instagram and facebook\none of my favorite things to see is\npeople say you know it'll be a quote\nabout something people say oh easier\nsaid than done and i always respond to\nthem no\neverything's easier said than done\nbecause in order to say something all\ni've got to do is move my lips in order\nto do something i've got to actually get\nup and put in the work so\nwith that being said\nyou now at least have the awareness\nwhich is the first step you have the\nawareness of okay first off what am i\nthinking about what am i focusing on\nand\nam i always feeling like something bad\ncould possibly happen\nam i thinking that we've all heard it\nbefore bad things happen in threes who\nsaid that bad things things happen in\nthrees where bad thing number one\nhappens bad thing number two happens\nyou're like oh my god i shouldn't even\nleave the house because bad thing number\nthree is coming at some point in time no\nwho said that\nbut if i'm thinking that it's going to\nhappen\nand i'm putting my focus into something\nthat could possibly happen that could be\nbad\naren't i basically attracting that third\nbad thing into my life\nwhat if when the first quote unquote bad\nthing happens i go you know what that\nwas the only thing that's gonna happen\nthere will be no more well maybe i'm not\ngonna attract any more bad things\nmaybe what i should also do is flip my\nperception of what is good and what is\nbad because inherently nothing is good\nor bad it is actually the label that you\nput on it right so if something quote\nunquote bad happens in my life i could\nlook at that as something that could\nhold me back for the rest of my life or\ni could look at that as something that's\nthe universe or god teaching me some\nsort of lesson that i needed in order to\ngrow\nwhat is it it's the universe just\npulling my arrow back\nso it can let me go and fling me forward\nall it really is is just a mindset shift\nwhat if\njust think about this and let it sink\nfor a second what if\neverything went amazing every single day\nuntil the day you die\nthink about that for a second\nwhat if everything went amazing every\nday until the day that you die\nnow i already know some people listening\nto me right now are getting those\nfeelings like the tightening in your\nstomach of like that's impossible\ni've seen too much bad happen in my life\ni know that i'm due at some point in\ntime i know that there's people out\nthere feeling this way\nmy question to you\nis who told you that\nis that the truth or is that just\nsomething that you've been told\nsomething you've been programmed into\nare bad times gonna happen\nmaybe\nbut whatever is good and bad is the\nlabel that you put onto it so you have\nto realize that\nthere's no\nreason why the shoe has to drop the\nother shoe has to drop that that\nyou know something bad has to happen\nthere's no reason why when you're in a\nbeautiful moment with your children and\nyou're trying to be present that you\nimmediately go to something bad could\nhappen\nthere's no reason why that needs to\nexist in your mind\nhere's the thing though\nwe are allowing it to exist why because\nthe perception of this\nnow exists in your awareness like you\nknow\nwhat i'm talking about you're sitting\nout there going\nyeah this does happen to me\nwell now that you know it exists next\ntime it pops up\nyou've got to have the awareness to take\nyourself out of the jar read the label\ntake yourself out of your mind and look\nat the actual life circumstances that\nare going on\nand go okay this thing that i am now\nperceiving as bad is it really that bad\nor is this just something that i can\nlearn and grow from\nthis thing that i'm perceiving is bad is\nthere some sort of lesson that i can\nextract from it so that i can grow from\nit and then you know the universe can\npull back my bow and arrow and then\nfling me forward\nultimately as i said it's just a\nscarcity mindset there is no reason why\nyou have to have a scarcity mindset\nthere is no scarcity in this world it is\nall abundance\nthere is no reason why if you make a\nbunch of money that there has to be some\nsort of bill that comes up\nthere's people out there that i know\nfeel this way there is no reason why if\nyou have a beautiful family things are\ngoing great that something bad has to\nhappen there is no reason why if you\nhave an amazing job and you love it that\nyou are going to get fired someday there\nis no reason there is no reason there is\nno reason i could give example example\nexample example ultimately it comes down\nto what you choose to focus on\nwhat you choose to focus on is going to\ndictate your life you've heard me say it\nover and over again when you change the\nway you look at things the things you\nlook at change\none of my favorite quotes from wayne\ndyer when you change the way you look at\nthings the things you look at change so\nyou can look at this quote-unquote bad\nevent and change the way you look at it\nthat event starts to change and you can\ngo oh my god i can't see why this was\nplaced in front of me because i needed\nto grow from it or\nbecause i needed a redirection so it's\nnot a step back maybe it's a step to the\nside so that i can go a different\ndirection\nbecause ultimately you're the one that's\nin control of your perception of every\nsingle thing that happens to you\nif you want to think of it as bad\ngo for it that is absolutely 100 your\nprerogative which is a beautiful thing\nbut\nif you're out there and you're like i\nwant a happy life i want a positive life\ni want to experience more joy more love\nmore happiness\nlisten to this episode again and realize\nthat you're the one you're the captain\nof your ship you're the one that's in\ncontrol of the way that you think feel\nand act every single day and if you\nchange your perception of the way that\neverything happens to you you'll realize\nthere are no step backs there's just\nsteps forward\nand maybe every once while step to the\nside to get you to go into a different\ndirection hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you want to learn\neven more about mastering your mind\nclick right here and watch this video as\nwell is this not mind-blowing to you\nlike to me this is mind-blowing i can\nactually literally change my brain this\nisn't some woo-woo bs this is actual\nreal science called
