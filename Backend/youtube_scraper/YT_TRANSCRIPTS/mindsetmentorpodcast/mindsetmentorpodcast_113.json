    "transcript": "and so one of the most common things\nthat I hear from people is how much they\nspend their time worrying and a lot of\npeople don't think that they spend their\ntime worrying and then when they take a\nstep back they realize that a lot of\ntheir time is actually used worrying\nabout things that they have absolutely\nno control over so if you're worrying\nabout something and you take a step back\nand you say hold on this thing that I'm\nworrying about can I change this no okay\nwell then I need to learn to accept it\ncan I change it yes okay what action do\nI need to take right now so if you\ncannot control or you cannot change the\nthings that you're worrying about which\nonce again is most things there's only\none thing that you really can do it's\nnot easy it's actually very easy but we\nmake it so hard in our mind we have to\naccept them and we have to let them go"
