    "transcript": "and i don't want to ask you this\nquestion to depress you but in your life\nwho is on your side 100\nand i'm going to ask you this question\nwho's not\non your side 100\nmaybe it's time to let them go\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to support the people that are\naround you to grow into who they're\nsupposed to be but also how to make sure\nthat you become the person that you were\nput on this earth to be so is this an\nimportant episode hell yeah i would say\nit's a pretty freaking important episode\nwhen we're going to talk about this and\nto start off i want to give you an\nanalogy have you ever saw like actually\nsat down and thought about how amazing a\nseed is like if you've ever just held a\nseed within that seed is even though\nit's this little teeny tiny thing is the\npotential to grow into something amazing\nand beautiful if it's treated the right\nway if it's taken care of that little\nteeny tiny seed will grow into something\namazing and beautiful sometimes if you\nget a little bit of a bigger seed it\ncould turn into a massive tree but\nwithin every single seed is the\npotential to become this big amazing\nplant or tree or flower and\ni want to talk to you about this kind of\ndive into the seed itself but i want to\ntalk to you about a flower\ngoing that seed route and a gardener now\nwhat is the gardener's job to do with\nthat seed and with that flower what is\nhis job to do his job is to allow the\nseed to become what it is supposed to be\nright to give it space\nto\nnurture it more than anything else to\ntreat it exactly how it needs to be\ntreated to give it water to give it sun\nto give it air to create the space for\nthat\nlittle teeny tiny seed that flower\nto become the best version of itself to\ngrow to its highest potential\nand the more that it takes care of it\nthe more that seed will become what it\nis supposed to become\nnow what happens if it doesn't get all\nthat what happens if it doesn't get the\nwater that it's supposed to get what\nhappens if it doesn't get the amount of\nsun that it's supposed to get or maybe\ntoo much sun what happens if it doesn't\nget enough air\nit doesn't grow to its full potential\nthe seed the flower does not become the\nflower that it could become and is\nsupposed to become\nlet me ask you a question what if a the\ngardener goes up and takes a mason jar\nflips it upside down and puts it on top\nof that flower what would happen to it\nit would restrict its growth right it\nmight become weaker because it's under\nthat mason jar it might start to have\nits branches and its leaves and\neverything start to to wither away\nand fall off it might kill the leaves\nand it might\neven kill the flower\nso a gardener's job only job is to\nnurture\nthat seed to become the most beautiful\nflower that it could possibly become\nand through the nurturing that flower\nbecomes the best flower that it could\npossibly become its job is not to change\nit he's not supposed to change it he's\nnot supposed to restrict it it's just\nsupposed to nurture that is the only\nthing that is supposed to do\nso now i want to take that analogy\nand i want to put it into your\nrelationships i want to talk first about\nthe people that are in your life and how\nyou're showing up for them and then i\nwant to talk about you and how the\npeople around you are showing up for you\nso in your relationships if you're the\ngardener right every person that around\nyou that's around you has this ultimate\npotential of what they're supposed to be\nwhat they're supposed to become and who\nthey could become if they have the right\nenvironment to do so so if that's the\ncase how are you showing up for the\npeople that are around you\nhow do you show up\ndo you\nnurture them are you really nurturing\nfor them for their ideas for their hopes\nfor their dreams for their desires are\nyou watering them are you giving them\nenough light are you giving them enough\nair you helping those around you bloom\nto their true potential\nare you\nyour job is to help them grow into who\nthey want to become who they were put\nhere to become\nnot this is very important not what you\nwant them to be\nnot what you want them to become\nso if we talk about for instance let's\ntake your significant other right and\nyou could take anybody and put them in\nthis this position but let's just talk\nabout your significant other are you\ntrying to mold them into what they could\nbe and help them grow into that or are\nyou trying to mold them into what you\nwant them to be are you trying to make\nthem into what you think they should be\nand push them into what you think they\nshould be doing\nor\nare you sitting there and nurturing and\nloving them no matter what it is that\nthey're going through are you trying to\nhelp them grow\nor are you trying to change them\nthink about that for a second\nit's an important question are you\ntrying to help them grow\ninto what they truly feel deep down\ninside they want to become\nor\nare you trying to make them become who\nyou think they should become how are you\nshowing up for them what type of\ngardener are you for the people that are\naround you\nnow\nlet me ask you if you have children how\nare you showing up for your children are\nyou restricting their growth are you not\nallowing them to do the things that they\nwant to do\nare you trying to force them into the\nhobbies and the sports and the\nactivities that you want them to be\ndoing\nif they want to be artistic are you\ntrying to you know shut that off and\nmake them go play sports or if they want\nto go play sports are you trying to shut\nthat off and trying to make them go into\nmusic how are you showing up for them\nbecause ultimately there's something\ninside of them that says i want to go do\nthis\nwhatever you want to call that intuition\ngod whatever it is that's inside of them\nthat's giving them this drive to go do\nthis one thing\nare you trying to push them in a\ndifferent direction or are you saying\nokay this is your interest how can i\nsupport you\nhow can i help you deepen that interest\nhow can i help you get better or are you\ntrying to restrict them the same way\nthat if you put a mason jar on top of a\nflower it's not going to grow to its\ntrue potential\nso think about that i know a lot of\nparents that restrict their children are\nyou so afraid of what they could have\nhappened to them that you don't even\nallow them to go and experience the\nthings in life that they're supposed to\nexperience because you're so terrified\nof what could possibly happen to them\nout in the real world\nbecause we all know we have to go\nthrough stuff to grow\nso are you trying to keep them away from\nall of the struggles in life\nare you trying to keep them away from\neverything that can help them grow into\nwho they want to be\nyou know i remember this it reminds me\nthis really sad story one of my friends\nuh their their grandmother died and\ntheir grandfather was still alive and so\nthey went up into the attic and they\nwere starting to help clean and you know\nchange some things around the house they\nwould have been to the attic and they\nwere sifting through things in the attic\nand they found these beautiful paintings\nlike these amazing paintings and they\ncould tell they were old old old old\npaintings and there was like four or\nfive and they're like these things are\nincredible these are beautiful whose are\nthese so they take them down to their\ngrandfather and they're like hey did\ngrandma paint these like who who painted\nthese where'd you get them from he's\nlike no those are those are my paintings\nfrom when i was younger and they're like\nyou painted like we we've never seen you\npaint i never knew that you were a\npainter\nand he's like yeah you know i only\npainted up until you know my my late\nteens and i tried to keep it away from\nmy dad because he wanted me to go into\nsports and this is a true story so don't\ntake my words of what i'm about to say\nas if i'm saying them but what he said\nwas you know he told me i couldn't paint\nhim more because it was too gay right\nlike so in the 30s or 40s whatever this\nwas it was seen as quote unquote gay to\nbe going and becoming a painter and so\nhe shut it off and he never painted\nagain\njust just think about how terrible that\nis that a child has this natural\ninclination\nthis this great talent and skill to go\ndo something and that he just shuts it\noff\ni never want to be that person for the\npeople that i love\ni don't know about you\ndo you want to be that person for the\npeople that you love i don't\ni want to help them grow if i see a\ntalent or a skill that they have i want\nto help them get better and deepen that\ninterest in that skill of what they have\nso then you know now that he was free\nand he was older and they said hey\ngrandpa what if we just gave you some\npainting supplies they brought over some\npainting supplies and he started back up\nagain and he made this amazing beautiful\npaintings\nand it was like he came alive again\nthere was a piece of him that died\n50 60 years ago and he was able to bring\nit back to life\nthink about that are there places in\nyour life where you're restricting\npeople that you love\nand not allowing them to flourish when\nreally you should just be there support\nthem\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nand it's it's sad i never want to be\nthat person for someone that i love but\nhow many of us are doing that and not in\nbig ways like hey don't paint but little\nteeny tiny things we're trying to mold\nthem in little hey don't do that hey\ndon't don't make those jokes in public\ndon't speak up hey john don't say that\nright just little teeny tiny cuts it's\nlike death of a thousand cuts because of\nall these little teeny tiny restrictions\nand slowly but surely slowly but surely\nslowly but surely we restrict who we\ntruly want to be oh don't dance in\npublic you look stupid\nright how many times have you done\nsomething like that told someone not to\nsay something that they thought was\nfunny told somebody not to dance where\nthey wanted to told somebody not to do\nthis it's like death of a bunch of\nlittle teeny tiny million cuts that's\nout there your job is not to change\nthose around you and to mold them in who\nyou want them to be it's to help them\nbecome who they were put here to become\ni don't know about you but i have the\nbelief that everybody has some sort of\nrole that they're supposed to play on\nthis earth\nwhether you want to call it god gave it\nto him the universe gave it to him or\nit's just something that's deep down\ninside of him i believe that everybody\nhas something that's deep inside them\nthat they want to bring out to the world\nso now that we've talked about the\npeople around you\ni want you to think deeply about that\nand now let's dive in and talk about you\nnow that we've talked with the people\naround you we're going to dive in and\nwe're going to talk about you\nhow are you\nshowing up for\nyourself\nhow are you showing up for yourself and\nhow are the people around you showing up\nfor you\nare they nurturing\nare they supportive\ndo they believe in the same things that\nyou believe in\nwhen you pick up a new hobby\ndo they\ntalk about how amazing that is or do\nthey try to cut you down\nwhen you go for a big goal do they try\nto motivate you and support you along\nthe way because we all need motivation\nmotivation and support from the people\nthat we love for big goals or do they\ntry to chop down your goals when you\nsucceed\nhow do they react\nthis is a really big thing if you when\nyou succeed how do the people around you\nreact\nare they celebrating with you are they\nas happy as you are about your success\nor are they trying to poke holes into\nevery little success that you have\nare they trying to show you how your\nsuccess isn't that great or how they\nonce did better\ndo they try to one-up you on everything\nthink about that when they succeed when\nyou succeed how do they show up for you\nusually you can really find out who's in\nyour corner at that point in time\nare they allowing you to bloom into who\nyou\nreally truly want to be or\nsame thing are they trying to mold you\ninto who they want you to be\nare your significant other your\nsignificant other they showing up for\nyou your family members your mom your\ndad your friends your lifelong friends\nyou've had for so long how do they show\nup for you\nthink about that\nmost people don't think about the people\nthat they surround themselves with\nyou know if a flower doesn't grow\nsometimes it's not the flower's fault\nmost of the time\nit's not the flower's fault you don't\ntry to change the flower you try to\nchange the environment of the flower the\namount of sun that it's getting the\nwater that it's getting the location the\nair think about that for a second\nsome people are not nurturing you into\nwho you truly want to be and ultimately\nare supposed to be so maybe the problem\nwith your growth in life hasn't fully\nbeen just you now it probably has a lot\nto do with you for sure i do want you to\nrealize that but it's also really hard\nto grow when there's other people around\nyou that are just like i said putting a\nmason jar on top of a flower and trying\nto hold you back because your growth\nmakes them feel like they're not doing\nenough or makes them feel insignificant\nand so they try to chop you down and\nmake you restricted in any way that they\ncan so maybe the problem isn't fully you\nmaybe it's your environment maybe it's\nyour gardeners maybe it's your lack of\ngardeners in your life\nthink about that for a second in your\nlife\nand i don't want to ask you this\nquestion to depress you\nbut in your life who is on your side 100\npercent\nwho is there for you no matter what\nto support you to help you to always\nwant to see the best for you to\ncelebrate your growth who's on your side\n100\nthink about those people real quick\nthink about them in your mind\nand i'm going to ask you this question\nwho's not\non your side 100\nmaybe it's time to let them go\nmaybe it's time for them to they've\nplayed their role in your life for as\nlong as they've been there but maybe\nit's time to let them go see if someone\nis restricting you or holding you back\nfrom who you are supposed to be\nmaybe it's time to release them not to\nkick them out or to get rid of them\ncompletely but release them they've\nplayed their role\nbecause ultimately sometimes you have to\nrelease certain people so that you can\ngrow into who you're supposed to be you\ncan still love them from afar but you\ndon't have to spend every single day\nwith them and it's okay\nsometimes life gets hard and it requires\nyou to release people i've had to\nrelease friends some of my best friends\nin the world then i can still be nice to\nthem and still hang out them every once\nin a while every couple years when i see\nthem or when i go in the town that they\nlive in but i don't talk to them every\nday\nbecause we're just going different paths\nand that is okay\nwhoever says that it's not okay to grow\napart from some people\nis wrong it's okay to grow apart from\nsome people\nso then if you're starting to release\nsome of your gardeners who suck at\ngardening\nhow can you start to get more gardeners\nin your corner more great gardeners in\nyour quarter people that love you people\nthat support you no matter what people\nthat want to see the best for you\nbecause i believe that we all have\npurpose in this world some of us are\nhere to be incredible parents some of\nyou listening to this are incredible\nparents and you are here to do that and\nyou are doing amazing at that role how\ncan you deepen that sense of purpose and\nbecome even better at raising amazing\nchildren some of you listening to this\nsome of us are healers\nyou're here to heal people and i'm not\njust talking about through it like if\nyou're a doctor or surgeon or a nurse\ni'm talking about you can heal people\nmentally you can heal people\nemotionally you being there for a friend\nsometimes is more healing than anything\nelse that they could have\nsome people are here to be teachers\ntheir skill is to teach how can you\ndeepen that how can you get better at\nthat how can you find more people that\nsupport you and your role of being a\nteacher some people are artists there's\nso many different roles what is your\nrole\nand if money wasn't an object if it\nwasn't something you had to worry about\nwould you what would you do with your\ntime who would you fit in as what role\nwould be you a hundred percent if you're\nlike this is who i am and how can you\nget better at that and then find people\nwho help you get better at that and want\nto see you get better at that as well\nbecause ultimately i want you to think\nof two things\ntwo things in this episode are extremely\nextremely important what you think about\nnumber one i want you to ask yourself\nthis question\nhow am i showing up for those that i\nlove\nhow am i showing up for those that i\nlove am i being a gardener am i\nnourishing them\nam i nurturing them am i watering them\nam i giving them enough sun am i giving\nthem enough love am i you know helping\nthem to become what they truly want to\nbecome\nor am i restricting them\nam i walking through a flower bed just\nstomping on every single flower that's\naround me\n[Music]\nthink about that how are you showing up\nfor those that you love and number two\nwhat does my environment look like\nthe people that i surround myself with\nthe people that are supposed to be in my\ncorner who is in my corner and wants the\nbest for me who's in my corner 100\nno matter what\nand who's not\nand who do i need to get rid of it's\nokay\nto let people go it's okay to release\npeople\nand what do i need to change about my\nexternal environment what is it that i\nneed to change\nwe all change we all grow and just as a\nflower if you've ever seen a flower\nsometimes it releases some of the petals\nand lets them go and sometimes there's\npeople in your life that their time is\ngone and you're trying to basically tape\ntheir\ntheir petal onto your flower\nno it's time to just let it wilt away\nand go so that you can grow a new one so\nthat you can become your truest\npotential because ultimately there's a\npeople that around us that we love that\nwe need to focus on and be the best\npossible gardener that we can be and\nnurture them and number two there's the\nenvironment around us and the gardeners\nthat are around us that we need we need\npeople to nurture us and to be on our\nside as well\nso just like the seed the little teeny\ntiny seed that has this amazing amount\nof potential we're all\nfilled with a massive amount of\npotential inside of us our job is to be\nhere and to live up to that potential\nand to be there for others and allow\nthem to become who they are supposed to\nbecome as well\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well it's\nokay to not know what your true purpose\nin life is right now but it's not okay\nto not be in constant pursuit to find\nwhat that is every single day"
