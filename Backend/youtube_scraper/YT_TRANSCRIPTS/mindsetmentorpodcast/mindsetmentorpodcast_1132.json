    "transcript": "you are the average of the five people\nthat you spend the most time with you\nneed to start paying really close\nattention to who the people are that\nyou're hanging around with and how they\naffect your internal environment\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nalways be positive and i don't mean it\nfrom a standpoint of like oh my gosh man\nlet's just let's just be positive all\nthe time and from a woo-woo standpoint\nor any of those types of things i'm\ntalking about from an actual practical\nstandpoint how can i make sure that no\nmatter what happens to me in my life\nthat i build the mental fortitude to be\nable to handle it no matter what it is\nbecause ultimately that's what we're\nreally trying to build an incredible\nmind for is to be able to handle\neverything that life can throw at us in\nin reality we know that you know there\nare some beautiful moments of life there\nare some terrible moments of life and we\nwant to build a mindset that can handle\nall of those it's like the phrase a\nskilled sailor didn't stay inside of the\nharbor you have to go out and actually\nliterally go through and take some bumps\nand some bruises and you have to get out\nof the harbor in order to actually\nbecome a skilled sailor you know a\nsmooth c never made a skilled sailor i\nthink is actually the better phrase\nthere's i think i just took two phrases\nand put them together for the first one\nuh and so whatever who cares you know\nwhat i'm trying to say and i mean from a\npractical standpoint how can we make\nsure that no matter what happens to us\nwe are positive and i want you to know\nthis from the very beginning i'm not\ntalking about how can we just ignore all\nof the negativity i'm actually talking\nabout more than anything else besides\nignoring the negativity is actually\nfocusing more on the negativity to\nextract the positive from the negative\nand so people are out there like well i\ndon't want to just ignore the negative\nbecause positive thinking is a bad thing\nyou shouldn't just think positive all\nthe time i'm actually going to be\ntalking about and teaching you how to\nextract positivity from all of the\nnegative stuff that happens around you\nand we're going to go dive into two\naspects of your life the first one is\nyour internal negativity\nwhich is just 100 percent you\nand then the second side is going to be\nyour external negativity which is also\nyou but it's also other people that\nmight be around you as well and the goal\nof today is for you to mentally sit\nthere maybe even with a pen and paper\nand to see how you can clear house in\nall of the different pockets of your\nlife and pull the negativity out of it\nso you can have as much beauty and joy\nas possible\nso we're talking about the internal\nnegativity you may have heard me say\nthis before but i always like to talk\nabout your mind as if it was a garden it\ncomes from a book as a man thinketh and\nhe says imagine that you're the gardener\nof this garden you're the only one that\nhas access to this garden it's\nimpossible for you to plant strawberry\nseeds and expect that tomatoes are\nsomehow going to grow because you can't\nplant strawberry season expects tomatoes\nthey're gonna it's not gonna happen same\nway that you can't have negative\nthoughts negative thoughts negative\nthoughts negative thoughts and then just\nautomatically you're just positive all\nof the time\nand so what happens is you have to\nnotice the negativity and just as if\nyou're a gardener see that that weed\ngrows you have to go pull the weeds as\nsoon as they pop up\nthe secret to it though is that you're\nthe only one that actually has access to\nthis garden there's no one else and so\nyou can't allow that negativity to creep\nin when you do you have to immediately\nidentify that negativity go and pull it\nlike a weed that's inside of your garden\nand the reason why i say it once you\nnotice it\nis because you can't always control your\nfirst thought you have to realize up\nuntil the moment that that you're\nlistening to this right now or watching\nit however you happen to be consuming\nthis piece of content\nyou have a lot of patterns and habits\nand traits that were built into you as a\nperson so you might immediately have a\nthought of judgment against somebody\nthat might not be the thought that you\nwant to have\nbut it's your first thought and a lot of\ntimes because of your programming\nbecause of your subconscious thoughts\nand everything that's been happening to\nyou up until the first 20 30 40 years of\nyour life whatever it is that the age\nthat you are that is your immediate\nfirst thought and you can't control your\nimmediate first thought right now but\nyou can always always always choose your\nsecond thought\nand so if you notice that a first\nthought comes in that is not the thought\nthat you want the same way that you\nwould pull the weed you got to pull it\nand immediately replace it with the\nthought that you do want the way that\nyou start to re-pattern yourself is to\nmake sure that you notice the things you\ndon't want and replace them with the\nthings that you do want now here's\nanother thing that you have to realize a\nlot of times people will have a judgment\nthought or\na negative thought or a thought that\nthey don't want to have and then instead\nof pulling that weed they now judge\nthemselves for having that negative\nthought that does nothing for you to\njust judge yourself for that negative\nthought that you now have\nit doesn't help you in any sort of way\nand in fact it makes it worse so it's\nlike looking at the weed and going oh my\ngosh weed why are you there i don't want\nyou to be there that's not gonna do\nanything to the weed get off your ass go\nand pull the weed that's what you need\nto do in your mind don't judge yourself\nfor it don't get emotional over it you\nlook at it and you say that weed is\nthere i need to pull that weed so you\ncan't control your first thought but you\ncan always control your second thought\nand the other thing that makes\nmakes it beautiful about life\nis realizing that negativity is going to\nhappen no matter what things are going\nto happen that you don't want to happen\nyou know\nfailures are going to happen people that\nyou love are going to die at some point\nin time i'm not trying to get more but\ni'm just being very practical and\nrealistic here people that you love are\ngoing to die relationships are going to\nend people are going to be fired you\nknow things are going to happen in life\nthat you don't want to happen at some\npoint in time\ninstead of allowing those things to get\nyou to go down a path of negative\nthinking or judgment or fear or worry or\nanxiety why don't you look at them\nknowing that it's going to happen\nthere's nothing you can do to avoid it\nand say what can i learn from this\nwhat can i learn from every aspect of it\ni'll give you an example my grandparents\npassed away a few years ago within 17\ndays of each other\ntragic sucks they have beautiful lives\nthough and so what i wanted to do\ninstead of getting sad and depressed\nabout it i'm not saying don't grieve is\nwhat i did was i actually sat down and i\nplanned out what i loved about them and\nhow i could put that into my personality\nso i can look at a death and something\nthat i didn't want to happen but did\nhappen\nand i can try to figure out some form of\npositivity from it because ultimately\nyou're either looking at the world one\nof two ways as if it's happening to you\nwhich is like oh what was me you know\nthis just happened this person broke up\nwith me this person died i'm so sad for\nmyself that's woe is me or you look as\nif something is happening for you\nimagine as if you're in the truman show\nyou know the show with jim carrey from\nyears ago in every single event every\nsingle challenge every single thing that\nhappens to you is a perfectly crafted\ncurriculum for the life that you are\ntrying to live as if somebody up there\nis just like okay now make it rain okay\nnow make this person break up with this\nperson now make this person get fired\nwhatever it is because you have to go\nthrough those things in order to get to\nthe next level of life imagine as if\nit's just a giant game and life is just\na perfectly crafted curriculum for your\ngrowth\nif you thought of life that way how\ndifferently would you approach every\nsingle thing that happened to you every\nsingle challenge every single uh\nbeautiful thing and every single\nnegative thing that happens to you as\nwell\nlife is happening to you\nis a negative way of thinking of it life\nis happening for you is a beautiful\npositive way of thinking of it it's your\nchoice\nyou are the one that's able to decide\nwhich one it is because it's never about\nwhat happens in your life it's your\npercept\nperspective and perception of what\nhappens to you in your life and so you\ncould say okay yeah these things are\nhappening to me or these things are\nhappening for me so things are going to\nhappen it's never the event it's your\nperception of the event and how you're\nactually putting it into your life\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\none of the things that people really\nstruggle with the most when it comes to\nnegativity and positivity\nis that when these things do happen\nthey are almost resisting reality like\nthey don't want this negative thing to\nhave happened and so they're almost\nresisting it and trying to fight it even\nthough it's already happened they're\ntrying to fight it because they don't\nwant it to be that way and i will always\nsay this the amount of stress and\nanxiety and worry and fear and all of\nthose things that you feel around\nsomething or that you're currently going\nthrough will be in direct proportion to\nhow much you are resisting the way that\nthe world is\nlet me say that again the amount of\nstress anxiety worry fear all of those\nbad feelings that you don't want that\nyou're going through or will go through\nthroughout life will be in direct\nproportion to how much you are resisting\nthe way that the world is the world is\ngoing to happen people are going to die\nrelationships are going to end people\nare going to get fired people are going\nto run out of money all of these things\nare going to happen probably at some\npoint in time there's a chance that they\ncould happen to you or someone that you\nlove\nand if you resist it it's going to put\nyou into more stress anxiety fear\nwhatever\nbut if you accept it then you can\nrealize that now it's time to move on\nand see this as a challenge in life and\nnow you can go into it with an open mind\nmore positive in seeing it as a learning\nlesson you know if somebody passes away\nif you try to resist that\nyou're going to put yourself into a\ntorture chamber in your mind of\nresisting because you can't bring that\nperson back it's impossible to bring\nthem back\nso what can you do you can grieve but\nyou have to accept that's part of the\ngrieving process is to accept it\nand then try to take the beautiful\naspects that that person put into your\nlife\nif a relationship ends\nyour stress and anxiety will be higher\nif you are resisting that in wishing\nthat it were different than it currently\nis\nso\nyou have to realize we can't control all\nof those problems that happen to us but\nwe can always control our reaction to\nevery event in our life so that's\ntalking about the internal negativity\nthat's your job is to clean house in\nyour mind\nnow when we're talking about the\nexternal negativity let's dive into all\nof the different aspects of it first\nthing that we think about and i hear all\nof the time is rob what do i do if\npeople around me that i love are\nnegative and we have two options and\nreally two options that you have either\nnumber one you let them go and let them\nlive their life the way they want to or\nnumber two you have to figure out some\nway to spend less time with them\nit's that simple\nif you want to truly grow into the\nperson that you can become and someone's\nbringing you down either they need to be\nreleased and let go or you need to spend\nless time with them if you truly want to\nbecome the person that you can become\nright\nthose are the two options\nand you know whichever one you choose is\nyour choice and that's beautiful\nbut ultimately you have to realize if\nthere's external negativity around you\nit's crazy to think that the external\ndoes not affect the internal\nso if it's really important to you to\nbuild a big beautiful life that's\npositive that you love full of joy peace\nhappiness\nall of that\nit's going to be really hard to do when\nyou have people that are bringing you\ndown all of the time\nso i'm not saying that you need to just\nleave your parents and never see them\nagain\nwhat i'm saying though is can you spend\nless time with them if your mom calls\nyou and throws all of her worries on top\nof you can you tell her to stop doing\nthat can you t and you have to write\nthis you teach people how to talk to you\nso if that's happening for instance\nwhere your mom's calling you and\nthrowing all of the negativity and all\nof her worries on top of you just say\nmom stop\ni don't want to listen to this don't\ncall me call somebody else any time you\nwant to be negative right you teach\npeople how to talk to you and you're an\nadult now so teach people how you want\nto be talked to you have to realize that\nbecause the top five people that you\nspend the most time with you will be the\nmost like i always say if you want to be\na millionaire hang out with five other\nmillionaires you'll probably be the\nsixth if you want to be fit hang out\nwith five people who are really fit\nif you're hanging out with five\nalcoholics you're probably gonna be the\nsix if you're hanging out five people\nthat are overweight you're probably\ngonna be the six you are the average of\nthe five people that you spend the most\ntime with you need to start paying\nreally close attention to who the people\nare that you're hanging around with and\nhow they\naffect your internal environment\nbecause ultimately\nyou might start to realize go through\nyour top five and say okay number one\ntwo three four five these are five\npeople i spend the most time with okay\nthree of them are really great three of\nthem are really supportive two of them\n[Music]\ni need to spend some less time with\nthese two okay so let me drop these two\nout of my top five i can still hang out\nthem every once in a while and see them\nat family events or whatever it is but\nnow i can replace two other people that\ni know will support me and push me and\nallow me to think better and have them\nin my top five so that i can grow and\nexpand into the person i know that i can\nbe\nnow some people say but rob i still live\nat home with my parents my mom is so\nnegative then what do i do well see it\nas another challenge once again like the\ntruman show like i said a few minutes\nago everything that happens to you is a\nperfectly crafted curriculum for you to\nbecome the best version of yourself so\nif you are in the truman show and you're\njust bloop you're given a negative\nmother as an example then how can you\nsee that as a challenge for you to\nbecome more positive in that environment\nright how can you see it as if it's a\ngame in order to get to the next level\nof life you have to eventually get past\nthis level that you're on and that might\njust have a really negative mother is\nthe example that you have in this level\nright and you have to think about it\nit's like a um it's like walking into\nyour house and it's fully negative if\nthat's what you have and there's nothing\nyou can do about it right now\nit's like walking into the gym for your\nmind\nright how can i go and lift as much\nweight as i possibly can to get my\nmuscles as big as possible that's how\nyou grow if you want to get bigger\nbiceps you do heavier bicep scrolls\nright if you want to get more positive\nand build a strong mental fortitude\nyou're gonna have to put it under some\nstrain here's your challenge if you\nchoose to accept it go into there and\nrealize that you're gonna be surrounded\nby negativity and you need to build this\nmental fortitude of positivity because\nthat's what you're that's what you're\ngiven you got to figure it out so who do\nyou surround yourself with who do you\nspend the most time with on a day-to-day\nbasis and do you need to shift your top\nfive a little bit because you're going\nto become the people that you surround\nyourself with it's just the way that it\nworks you will hold yourself to the same\nstandards that everybody that you\nsurround yourself with as well do\nas well do i don't know that wasn't even\nright you're going to you're going to\nyou're going to hold yourself to\nstandards that everyone else around you\nholds themselves to\nso you have to think about that so\nthat's part of externals the people that\nare around you other aspects of external\nthat you might not think of\nwell number one how about the music that\nyou listen to\nthis is a big one for me i didn't really\nrealize was was actually affecting the\nway that i feel like i have music that i\nlisten to now i have music that i used\nto listen to and i don't listen to as\nmuch anymore sometimes i'll indulge you\nknow when i was younger\nreally didn't like hardcore metal then i\nmoved in and had a roommate and we were\nboth musicians and i started to really\nappreciate it because hardcore metal\nlike they are the best\nmost talented musicians in the world\nincredible\nbut for me i've come to realize that\nmusic makes me really anxious and it's\nsuper negative and about killing and\ndeath and all of this stuff\ni can appreciate them from afar but i\ndon't listen to it anymore right i've\njust realized that that music and that's\njust me it might not be you it's okay\ni've just realized that that music the\nexternal of that music affects me some\nof the music i used to listen to hip hop\nrap music it's not the way that i live\nmy life and i don't want to say out loud\nsome of the things that they say because\nanything that i say out loud is an\naffirmation and going into my\nsubconscious and if i don't want to\ntreat people the way that they treat\npeople i'm probably not going to listen\nto that music do i still indulge every\nonce in a while yes as much as i used to\nabsolutely not so i try to literally\nlisten to music that i can feel inside\nof me is raising my\nvibration i guess you could say because\nmusic is a vibration you are a vibratory\nbeing and so you have to realize that's\ngoing to come into your body and make\nyou feel a certain way the words will\nthe music will the vibration will all of\nthat stuff well i'm not trying to be\nweird and\nlike uh your vibrations but really\nessentially music is a vibration you are\na vibratory being there's no way around\nthat so that music is affecting you in\nsome sort of way so think about that\nwhat else external affects you what\nabout the stuff you watch on tv\nthe news stop watching it it doesn't it\ndoesn't really inform you it doesn't\nkeep you informed it keeps you conformed\nthat's really what it does\nright there's other ways to get your\nnews\nthe news stations probably not the best\nespecially if you live in america right\nso news\nreality tv oof and some people like oh\nbut i just watched reality tv because\nit's just mind numbing and it's just fun\nto to watch what people do no you're\nwatching people i've seen a lot of\nreality i've walked in the room when\nit's on\nscreaming treating people that you would\nnever want to treat that external you're\nyou're that's coming into your eyes it's\ncoming into your ears everything you are\nconsuming it the same way that if you\nwere to eat your shoe it's going to in\nsome form of\nsome way come into your body and make\nyou not feel good you're still consuming\nall of the stuff that you see in here\nthink about it that way what about games\nyou play do you play video games that\nare\nhardcore shoot-em-up games that make you\nanxious that are keeping you on the edge\nof your seat\ni had a friend that literally he was on\nthis podcast where he was playing video\ngames that were just hardcore games that\nkept him anxious and it clicked a part\nof his brain over and he wasn't able to\nsleep for a year and a half because of\nall of the anxiety that it created and\nthat wasn't just the video games but\nthat was the straw that broke the\ncamel's back which shows you those\nthings come into your internal\nenvironment so if you're not going to go\nup and honestly like think about it if\nyou're not going to go out and shoot a\nbunch of people on the street why would\nyou want to do it on a tv\nreally deeply think about that and start\nto reassess it what you do is your own\nprerogative but really start to think\nabout these things that you do you know\ni was playing vr the other day\nplayed it like for a few hours with one\nof my friends so much fun so incredible\nbut when i was done i realized my level\nof anxiety was so high because i was\nliterally in vr in reality shooting\nthings and it was just like things were\npopping up and it was scaring me i was\nkeeping on my seat it literally raised\nmy anxiety i was like i can't do that\nagain was it fun hell yeah it was fun\nbut it literally made me feel bad after\nsomething to think about just think\nabout the games that you're playing\nhow about people you follow on social\nmedia\num\nthink about that just think about all of\nthe external pieces of your life because\nultimately everything that you consume\nis going to affect you in some form of a\ndifferent like whatever it is that you\ndo no matter what it is if you drink\ncyanide it's going to affect you because\nyou're consuming poison think about how\nmany forms of poison that you're\nconsuming that's not you know actual\ncyanide but stuff that you're seeing\nstuff that you're hearing people that\nyou're surrounding yourself with and\nthoughts that are going on inside of\nyour head ultimately the best thing for\nyou to do is take a pen and paper out\nright now and actually plan out\nwhat your life looks like the positive\nside the negative side and what you need\nto do to clear house of every aspect of\nthat negativity because ultimately\nthere's nobody in control of your life\ninternally and externally except for you\nyou need to sit down and actually plan\nit out as if it was a business and you\nwere creating a business plan because\ninternal and external environment are\ngoing to affect you in some form\nthat's just the truth\nyou have to see if it's something that\nyou want to be consuming or if it's\nsomething that's poisonous to you\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well if you're\nfocusing on all of the input your input\nis just negative negative negative\nnegative the output of the way that you\nthink and the way that you feel all day\nlong is going to be negative that's just\na fact"
