    "transcript": "but how many of us are holding ourselves\nback not because of our own beliefs but\nbecause somebody gave us their beliefs\nat one point in time\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to talk about how you\nunconsciously hold yourself back from\neverything that you want in this world\nand you won't truly get past it until\nnumber one\nyou're aware of it and number two you\nfigure out a way to work past him and\ni'll give you a couple stories today\nthat'll kind of help you lock this into\nyour brain so that we can you know kind\nof make this cemented and where this\ncame from is i saw a post somebody put\nup on instagram and it was of a horse\nthat had you know is tied up but it was\ntied to a plastic chair but it stayed in\nplace all day long because it was tied\nto a plastic chair and i saw this and it\nreminded me of a story\nand the story is there's a man that's\nwalking down the street and he sees over\nto his left he sees that there's a whole\nbunch of elephants and he walks up and\nhe notices that all of these elephants\nare tied and they're these are full-size\nelephants they're tied by a little teeny\ntiny rope to just\njust a small little tree and so there's\nthese huge elephants with small ropes\ntied to one of their legs and there's\nthey're tied to a little tiny tree then\nhe looks and he's like these elephants\ncould easily\nbreak this tree in half and if they\ndidn't break the tree they'd easily be\nable to break the rope so he goes up to\nthe trainer and he says to him you know\nwhy are all of these elephants just\nstanding around like they could easily\nbreak that tree and break that rope why\nare they just standing there when the\nrope is just tied to their leg\nhe starts to tell him it's because when\nthey're really really young what they do\nand even though i hate that this is an\nactual true thing but i'm telling this\nbecause it's going to make sense to you\nin just a minute but this is true this\nis actually how they train them not to\nleave and what he says to them though is\nthat that when they were younger and\nreal small elephants they had the exact\nsame rope that was tied to their leg\ntied to the exact same tree and as they\ngrew they didn't realize that they could\nbreak through it and so what happened\nwas\nthey never had to put a bigger rope on\nthem because they were conditioned to\nbelieve\nthat they could not break away\nso they never had to tie a bigger rope\nbecause they not because they physically\ncouldn't do it anymore but because\nmentally they didn't think that they\ncould do it and so one day\nin their lives the elephants realized\nthat they're powerless and they gave\naway their power\nnow i hate that story because it seems\nlike animal cruelty but also on the\nother side this relates perfectly to the\nway that we hold ourselves back\nsubconsciously you know why do i share\nthe story is because was there one day\nor one moment in your life where you\njust gave up and you just gave your\npower away to somebody else's beliefs or\nsomebody else that they said to you or\nthe fact that you'll never be enough or\nbecause the fact that you failed in the\npast you're definitely going to fail\nagain\nyou know was there a day that you just\ngave up\nthink about that for a second the next\nquestion i have to follow up with that\nis if you stayed there forever\nand died in the place that you're in\nwould you be excited about it would you\nfeel like there was wasted potential\nbecause ultimately how many of us are\nholding ourselves back because of\nsomething that we failed at in the past\nhow many of us are holding ourselves\nback because of where we came from\nand the fact that everyone that i know\nwhen i was younger was poor so therefore\ni'm going to be poor when i grow up\nbecause i'm just the same as everyone\nelse that i was raised around how many\nof us are holding ourselves back because\nof a belief that was programmed into us\nat a young age and when i say programmed\ni don't mean that it was like some evil\nperson's like oh i'm going to program\nrob into not believing that he's worth\nit what i mean is that sometimes you're\njust around people and people say things\ndirectly to you or they say things to\neach other and you hear it and it locks\ninto your brain and says yeah you know i\nwill be in the same position because\nthis is how everybody else or i will be\nin the same position because my uncle\nwhen i was younger told me that i was\ndumb and i'd never be good enough right\nsome people just hear something at one\npoint in time and it just locks into\nplace\nand how many of us are holding ourselves\nback because of a what a teacher or a\nparent or a family member or a friend or\na brother or sister said to us when we\nwere younger and much more\nimpressionable than we currently are\nright now\nyou know it's bad enough that we hold\nourselves back from what we truly want\nbecause of limiting beliefs but it's\neven worse when you realize that you're\nholding yourself back not because of\nyour own beliefs but because of somebody\nelse's beliefs that we're around you\nwhen you are young and impressionable\nand it just locked into your brain and\nyou decided to keep it and it's the\nexample i always give is it's like\nsomebody\ngiving you a dirty shirt\nand you're younger and you put the shirt\non and they just say hey this is your\nshirt and you put the shirt on and then\nyou just wear it your entire life and\nnot even realize that you're wearing the\nshirt somebody gives you a programming\nif not good enough or smart enough or\npretty enough or never going to make\nmoney you're never going to be happy or\nnever be successful whatever it is they\ngive you that quote-unquote shirt you\nput it on and then you wear it your\nentire life until hopefully one day you\nwake up and you go whose shirt\nis this that i'm wearing\nright like most people don't wake up and\nrealize that they're wearing an old\ndirty shirt that isn't even theirs in\nthe first place that was given to them\nwhen they were younger and so you have\nto ask yourself am i holding on to\nunconscious programs that i'm not even\naware of and when i say unconscious it\nalso means subconscious so you have your\nconscious mind and then you have\nsubconscious which is below your\nconscious and they say about 95 percent\nof our things that we do every single\nday\nare subconscious actions our brain just\ndoes it's also called a reflexive action\nour brain just does it because it's what\nwe've always done but how many of us are\nholding ourselves back not because of\nour own beliefs but because somebody\ngave us their beliefs at one point in\ntime\nyou know when i was younger my my very\nfirst job was i was a burden fish\nspecialist i know be impressed i was a\nburden fish specialist at petsmart and\nit was my very first job so i was like\nthe guy who would feed all of the birds\nand all of the little critters and the\nlizards and also the fish and then i\nwould clean all the fish tanks and the\nbiggest tank that we had\nwas filled with thousands and thousands\nand thousands of goldfish\nand one thing i knew from a very young\nage is that goldfish will only grow to\nthe size of the actual\nbowl that they're put in and so a\ngoldfish that's in captivity will only\ngrow to about one to two inches in a\nstandard sized tank\nright but if you go and you find a\ngoldfish in the wild goldfish will grow\nto 12 to 14 inches\nso let me say that again a goldfish in\ncaptivity in a small little tank will\nonly grow to an inch to two inches but a\ngoldfish out in the wild in a stream in\na river in a pond will grow to 12 to 14\ninches so it will grow six to seven\ntimes larger when it's inside of a\nlarger body of water\nwhy in the hell do i say that because\nthink about how\nsometimes you are around people\nthat think small\nthink about how their thinking small\nrestricts your thinking to think small\nsometimes you're around people they give\nyou their limiting beliefs and those\nlimiting beliefs restrict you when in\nreality if you were to be able to just\ncompletely let your mind go and your\nimagination go and go for what is that\nyou want you'd be that 14-inch goldfish\nbut you have all of these little\nprogrammings in these restrictions and\npeople that are still around you that\nneed to be released that are keeping you\nto be a one to two inch goldfish you\nhave so much potential to grow in to\nthat massive goldfish but because of the\nthings that are going on in your mind\nand the people that you surround\nyourself with you're not growing and so\nsometimes when a fish isn't growing you\ndon't blame the fish you blame the\nactual surroundings that it's in in the\ntank that it's in so maybe if you're not\ngrowing it's not a hundred percent your\nfault at this moment\nit might be the fact that you need to\nhang out with some new people you need\nto release some people because they're\nactually restricting your growth from\nbeing who you could be hey if you're\nenjoying this video do me a favor and\nhit that like button down below it helps\nwith the youtube algorithm so that more\npeople can see this message because it\nhelps us get it out organically so hit\nthat like button and i appreciate you\nand so maybe there's people around you\nonce again that are talking about how\nbroke they are all the time and you're\nsubconsciously letting those broke\nprogrammings go into your mind maybe\nthere's people that are around you that\nare just consistently negative all of\nthe time\nand they're just leaking that negativity\ninto your brain and it's hard for you to\nfigure out how to be positive because\nyou have all of these little\nsubconscious programmings 95 of what's\nrunning in the background of your head\nis just negative negative negative it's\nreally hard to grow\noutside of the bowl that you're in and\nso what i think you should think of is\nhow many people around me are keeping me\nrestricted how many people around me are\ngiving me their programmings how many\npeople around me are making me more\nnegative are making me more broke are\nmaking me less happy are bringing the\njoy and the peace out of my life because\nif someone's taking that and they're\nrestricting you\nmaybe you should spend some less time\nwith them\nmaybe you should find some people that\nwant you to succeed that make you think\nbigger that make you happier that are\nalways positive and find the good in\nthings even when bad things happen so\nthat their programming start to leak\ninto your mind\nyou know it's like that it'll slowly\nleak in and you don't even notice it but\nthings people say will click into your\nbrain and things people say to each\nother and you over here will click into\nyour brain so maybe you should be more\ncognizant of the people that you\nsurround yourself with as well as the\nprogrammings that you have\nand that's the thing that's really hard\nabout programming is that if you're not\nlooking for it it's really hard to find\nand so that's why i always say one of my\nfavorite phrases is when you're inside\nof the jar it's hard to read the label\nwhat that means is then when you're\ninside of the jar of your life inside of\nyour own head it's hard to see\nall of the little places where you're\nhung up it's hard to see all the little\nprogrammings that are holding you back\nit's hard to see all of those little\nlimiting beliefs and where they came\nfrom and how to get rid of them so\nsometimes what you have to do is you\nhave to actually take yourself out of\nthe jar out of your own head and look at\nyourself as if you're somebody else and\nstart to actually break down\nwhat do i need to change about this\nperson what do i need to change about\ntheir mindset what do i need to change\nabout their surroundings what do i need\nto change about the way that they think\nwhat do i need to change about their\nprogramming because that's what's so\nhard about the programming is that if\nyou're not looking for it it's really\nhard to find and so the first step\nof almost anything in life is to become\nself-aware of it and when you can become\nself-aware of it you can start to see\nall the place that you're hung up and\nall the places where you're holding\nyourself back but once again it's\nsubconscious it's under the conscious\nmind and it goes so deep and i've been\nworking for 14 years to uncover my\nprogrammings and i've released some of\nthem and i've released some of them and\nthen one day something happens and i'm\nlike i didn't even realize that i\nwas still hung up right there\nand that's something that i need to work\nthrough and that's the beautiful thing\nabout self-development is i see us as\njust like a flower that just continues\nto have new petals that come up and then\nthey fall off and you get new ones and\nthen other ones fall off you get new\nones and they fall off that's kind of\nhow it is with personal development is\nthat you know eventually you work\nthrough something you work through\nsomething you work through something and\nit can go and you can release it it's\nlike a dead pedal that falls off of the\nrose\nbut what happens another one grows and\nyou start to become aware of another one\nand another one and another one and you\nrealize that this journey of life that\nyou're on is not about becoming perfect\nit's about just working through the\nlittle hang-ups that we have realizing\nyou might get to the end of your life\nand not get through all of them and for\nsome people\njust that thought can make you really\nanxious\nor you can look at it and go you know\nwhat\nthat's the journey that i can't i can't\nchange this journey i'm on this life\nso i need to figure out a way to work\nthrough these things and work through\nthese programs to make myself happier\nbecause ultimately your happiness comes\ndown to you your success comes down to\nyou your peace comes down to you your\njoy comes down to you the amount of\nmoney in your bank account comes down to\nyou the amount of people that you impact\nthis will comes down to you and so if\nyou're going to be one of the people\nthat changes you're going to have to\nactually start the change you're going\nto have to wake up one day like the\nelephant if they could look back at your\nfoot and go oh my god i can break this i\ndidn't even realize how powerful i was\ni can break this right now and i could\nrun off and i can be free because i've\nbeen conditioned\nto think that i'm not good enough i've\nbeen conditioned to think that i'm not\nable to succeed i've been conditioned to\nthink that where i come from everybody\nends up going to jail i've been\nconditioned to think that i'm never\ngoing gonna get past the set of people\nthat i'm in and what happens is you wake\nup one day you look back at your leg and\nyou go i'm gonna break this damn thing\nlike i'm gonna get past this i don't see\nany reason why i need to be here anymore\nand i'm gonna go past this that i'm in\nand just like the goldfish what happens\nyou go from one inch to two inches\nand here's a beautiful thing about\ngrowth is that growth is exciting to\npeople one of the things that tony\nrobbins says is that progress equals\nhappiness so if you are a little\none-inch goldfish right now and you\nstart releasing some of your programs\nand releasing some of your living\nbeliefs and stop hanging out with\nnegative people and start being around\npeople that make you think bigger and\npeople that want to see you be\nsuccessful and you go from a one inch\ngoldfish to a two inch goldfish and then\nyou look in your rear view and you're\nlike man\nlook at how far i've come already\nthat little bit of progress makes you\nhappy and we want more happiness so what\ndo we do we go well if if i grew that\nmuch in six months\nimagine how much i can grow in the next\nsix months and then so what happens you\nget excited about growth you start\nworking harder towards being more\nsuccessful or towards growing more being\nhappier more joyful or more peaceful and\nthen you go from a two-inch goldfish to\na three-inch goldfish and you're like\nholy crap look at how much i've grown\nsince i started on this journey and then\ndo four and five inch goldfish and then\none day you wake up and you're a ten\ninch goldfish and you're like man\ni'm so glad that i started on this\npersonal development journey i'm so glad\nthat i've put in all of the work i'm so\nglad that i instead of going out and\npartying sometimes decided to read\nbecause look at myself look at how far\ni've come\nand just that little bit of growth and\nseeing the way that you've grown makes\nyou happy because progress equals equals\nhappiness but the main thing that you\nhave to do in order to start working\nthrough these is develop your\nself-awareness realize that there's a\nlot of subconscious programming that are\nholding you back you've been conditioned\nnot on purpose most of the time you've\njust been conditioned by the things that\nyou've heard and the people that you've\nbeen around to keep you inside of a\nsmaller cage and smart smaller tank it's\ntime for you to break out of the tank\nit's time for you to break the rope\nthat's around your foot become\nself-aware they're there get rid of the\nthings that are holding you back and\nstart growing yourself into the person\nthat you want to become because no one's\ngoing to come and save you the only one\nthat can save you is you but you have to\nstep into the driver's seat and say i'm\ngoing to do this\none of the best things that i think of\nthat really puts it in perspective is\nthe analogy of your life is like being\non a sailboat and you're the only one\nthat's on this sailboat and if you're\njust\nletting life happen that's why they say\nit's like drifting through life it's\nlike hopping on a sailboat and just\nletting the winds take you to where\nyou're going to go and then one day you\nwake up and you're in one place another\nday you wake up and you're in another\nplace\nand then one day you actually not\nphysically wake up but mentally wake up\nand go oh my god\nthis entire time i've been on this ship\ni didn't even realize that there was a\nsteering wheel\ni can actually jump into the front of\nthe steering wheel and i can direct the\nship to where i want it to go\nwhen you finally wake up mentally and\nyou start to do that you realize that\nwith just a little bit of work and\ndedication into yourself you can get\nyourself anywhere that you want to go\nthe same way that you can get that\nsailboat to get go anywhere that you\nwant to go but you're the only one that\ncan hop in the captain's in the\ncaptain's chair hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you want to learn\neven more about mastering your mind\nclick right here and watch this video as\nwell action\nleads to results results\nleads to confidence and confidence\nis what destroys limiting beliefs"
