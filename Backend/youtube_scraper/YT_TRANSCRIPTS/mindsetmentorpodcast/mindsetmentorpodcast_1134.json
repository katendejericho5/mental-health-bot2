    "transcript": "who are you and who do you want to\nbecome is it the person that you've\nalways been is that who you are or do\nyou want to step into a new version of\nyourself you can make that decision\nright now\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe journey of life that you were on and\nhopefully the journey of\nself-development that you're on as well\nwe're going to talk a lot about\nself-development and improving yourself\nevery single day because if you're\nlistening to me if you're watching this\nif you're seeing this\nyou're here because there's something\ninside of you that says i have more\npotential inside of me and i want to do\nwhatever i can to get it out of me now i\nunderstand you feel that way but\nsometimes our actions don't necessarily\nline up with that and the reason why is\nthis is because there's almost two sides\nof yourself that are battling there's\nyour old self which is telling you old\nstories that you might have been given\nby your parents or by society or by your\nbrothers or sisters an accumulation of\neverything that you've heard and\neverything that you've seen people that\nare around you that say oh yeah you know\nthis is where i'm going to be my entire\nlife then there's the other side of you\nthat's like but this is who i could be\nand sometimes if you're out there you've\nprobably felt like some of those you\nalmost did like an internal battle\nbetween the two of them and so we're\ngoing to talk about the journey of\nself-development and i see it as a\njourney and i don't see self-development\nas a\nas something that i do and i hope you\ndon't see it as something that you do\nkind of like you know people say oh well\nyou know i went to the gym today right i\ndon't see self-development as something\nthat i just do on a daily basis\ni see it as an actual lifestyle like it\nis part of who i am now it didn't start\noff that way but then i developed it and\ndid it over and over and over again and\nit's become a lifestyle and the reason\nwhy i said is because i know that i'm\ngoing to be taking this lifestyle this\njourney my entire life\nthe the my very first mentor had a\nphrase that he used to always say and\nit's a japanese word and the word is\nkaizen\nand kaizen needs constant never-ending\nimprovement\nand literally i am obsessed with that\nword my business is named after that my\nllc is named after it\nmy tattoo on my wrist is the roman\nnumeral for ten thousand it's an x with\nthe line above it so i see it every\nsingle day because they say it takes\nabout ten thousand hours to master\nsomething and so i see this every single\nday reminding myself that i don't think\nit's gonna take ten thousand hours to\nask myself i think it's gonna take my\nentire life to master myself i think i'm\ngonna be doing it every single day until\nthe day i die\nand for some of you out there might that\nmight kind of give you some anxiety like\noh my god i'm never going to get to be\nthe person i want to become\nbut what you should see it as you're a\nconstant unfolding always changing in\nkaizen is such a beautiful thing it's\nconstant never-ending improvement you\ncan always get better there's always\nanother version of yourself there's\nalways another unfolding of who you are\nto the point where where my mastermind\nwhich i'll be you know announcing to you\nguys in the next you know a couple\nmonths is called kaizen mastermind where\nit's literally a 12-month program with\nfour events where i work with everybody\nthat's inside of it and it's called\nkaizen because it's constant\nnever-ending improvement and the journey\nis what it's all about but here's what\nmost people don't realize is most people\nthink about\nwhere they want to be and they look at\nwhere they currently are and they see\nthis massive gap between where they want\nto be and who they are and they get down\non themselves because it seems\nso far\nbut what i want to tell you is this the\nbeautiful thing is that i tell myself\nevery single day when i wake up\nall i have to do is be one percent\nbetter than i was yesterday\nthat's it i don't have to be better than\nanybody else i don't have to be ten\ntimes better than what i was yesterday\ntoday i just need to be one percent\nbetter i need to take one percent better\nactions i need to have one percent\nbetter decisions i need to have one\npercent better habits i need to have one\npercent better thoughts i need to take\none percent better care of myself i\ndon't need to be a completely different\nperson today now i can completely switch\nup who i want to be you know one of my\nfavorite phrases alan watts says you're\nunder no obligation to be who you were\nfive minutes ago and you can completely\nshift yourself from one day to another\nbut for some people to think of all of\nthat change becomes very stressful and\nso it might be easier just for you to\nthink one percent better just one\npercent better and the reason why i say\nthat is this is\nyour results in your current\ncircumstances in your life\nthey are the results of your habits\nyour traits your behaviors and your\nthoughts of your past your results where\nyou currently are right now are lagging\nfrom your past so whatever happened in\nyour past brought you to this current\nmoment\nresults don't come right away and so\nwhere you are right now\nis based off of habits and thoughts and\ntraits that you had six months ago or a\nyear ago and now they've caught up with\nyou to where you currently are whether\nthey're good habits or bad habits good\ntraits or bad traits good thoughts or\nbad thoughts\nit's a lagging it doesn't it's not like\nyou immediately start thinking positive\nand then you're immediately positive no\nit takes time it's not like you\nimmediately start taking action and\nimmediately you get results no all of\nyour results in your current\ncircumstances are lagging showing you\nwho you are and who you were six months\nago and what you have created now\nthe reason why this depresses people is\nbecause they look at their current\ncircumstances they try to make changes\nright now and they expect that things\nare going to be different yesterday you\nknow it's like we don't even expect them\nto be better tomorrow we expect them to\nbe better yesterday because we're in\nthis world of\nconstant like everything is at the palm\nof our like in our palm it's at our\nfingertips it's it's instant\ngratification\nwhen success happiness results are all\nbased off of delayed gratification\nbecause what you do right now\nyou will will dictate where you're going\nto be in six months where you are\ncurrently right now dictates what you\ndid six months ago and so for a lot of\npeople they look at where they are they\ntry really hard for one day or one week\nand then they're like i'm not getting\nresults\nno it takes about six months until you\nstart those results start catching up\nwith what you've been doing and the\nactions you've been taking and the\nhabits and the traits and qualities and\nthings that you think of\nand your habits\ncome so if we're talking about changing\nyour habits your cabbage come from the\nstory that you're telling yourself\ninside of your head about who you are\nso you're currently all day long telling\nyourself a story of who you are\nand you could say they could be good\nthings that could be bad things you\ncould say you know you might have this\nprogram running in your head of i'm lazy\nyou might have this program running in\nyour head of i procrastinate you might\nhave a pro program running your head of\ni'm overweight because everyone in my\nfamily is overweight you might have a\nprogram running your head of i love to\nsleep in you might have a program\nrunning in your head of i hate working\nout you might have a program running\nyour head of i love food too much and\nthat's why you can't lose weight what is\nyour program that's running in your head\nbecause the program is going to dictate\nthe habits that you have the habits that\nyou have dictate the actions that you\ntake and the actions that you take\ndictate your results and so you have to\nbe able to break these down and say\nwhere am i currently what do i think\nabout myself because my habits my\nactions and my results will dictate what\nwill come from what i think of myself\nthat i'm lazy that i procrastinate that\ni'm overweight that i love food too much\nthat i uh don't like working out\nwhatever it is\nso in order to change your habits you\nhave to change your internal story\nthat's the secret\nwhat is your internal story and here's\nthe interesting thing is that\ni've said this many times that most\npeople\ndon't know who they are on a deep deep\ndeep level until they start working with\nmyself or a coach or someone else or\nreading books or working on this\npersonal development journey that they\ngo on\nbecause they they don't realize the\ninternal program that's running in the\nbackground that dictates their habits\nand their actions their behaviors and\ntheir thoughts and their life really\nwhat it is and so it goes back to what i\nwas talking about at the very beginning\nwhere it's\nthere's who you've been programmed as\nand it's not like there's some evil\nperson sitting like i'm going to program\nrob into being this way it's just\neverything that i've seen everything\nthat i've heard and then there's who i\nwant to be and sometimes there's the\nbattle the reason why it's the battle is\nbecause there's that internal\nstory that i've been telling myself my\nentire life\nand the story of who i want to be are\nkind of at a battle\nyour habits come from the thought of\nthis is who i am\nyou need to be very careful\nof saying who you are\nand not even just saying that out to the\nworld but saying that into your own head\nof who you are because your bank account\nis a result of your spending habits your\nbank account is a result of your earning\nhabits your body is a result of your\neating habits and your body is also a\nresult of your working out habits or\nlack thereof\nyour business is a result of how much\nhard work you put in your business is\nalso a result of how much dedication\nthat you put into everything that you do\nso once again there's a little bit of a\nlag but you have to be able to sit back\nand say okay my current circumstances\nare not where i want to be which means\nthat six months ago three months ago i\ntook actions to get myself here so in\nthree to six months if i change my\nactions right now that means my results\nand my circumstances in three or six\nmonths could be completely different\none of the a phrase that i love about\nthis james clear says every action is\nlike a vote for the person that you want\nto become\nnow\nyou want to become\nor\nyou tell yourself that you are to get\neven more clear on it\nso if i say you know what i'm a lazy\nperson\nbut i identify that and i say i don't\nwant to be lazy anymore\nokay well then what happens is when i'm\nnoticing myself i need to get up and do\nsome push-ups whatever it is but i'm on\nthe couch looking at instagram\ni have a moment of decision where i can\neither play in to my old story\nor i can notice it become self-aware and\nsay hold on\nthis is a moment of transformation for\nme\ni'm noticing my lazy habit right now of\nnot wanting to get up i need to conquer\nthat lazy habit and get up and do 50\npush-ups\ngo for a run whatever it is\nif i'm the type of person that's like oh\nyeah i'm overweight because my entire\nfamily is overweight and it's just it\nruns in my family well the next time i\ncatch myself not eating the things that\ni need to eat i need to become very\nself-aware and say do i want to continue\nwith my old programming of i'm\noverweight because my family is\noverweight or do i want to make a\ndifferent decision right now and make a\nhealthier decision\nbecause that is who i want to become\nif i'm sitting there and my alarm clock\ngoes off in the morning i have a\ndecision to make in that moment of do i\nwant to continue being the lazy person\nthat sleeps through and hits snooze nine\ntimes or do i want to become the person\nthat wakes up when the sun comes up and\nactually puts time into the morning\nroutine\nyou have a million decisions throughout\nthe course of the day of who you're\ngoing to be it could either be who\nyou've always been and who you've\nidentified yourself as your entire life\nor who you want to become and who you\nnow want to step into being\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nand the thing about it is this is it's\nnever any really big habit that changes\nyour life it's a bunch of little teeny\ntiny boring decisions\ni always say that success is not sexy\nit's just a bunch of little teeny tiny\nthings done every single day right\nyou may have heard me say before nobody\ndies from eating one hamburger\nright nobody dies from eating a\nhamburger\nbut if they have thousands of hamburgers\nover their lifetime\nwell they could be clogging up their\narteries from that it's a bunch of\nlittle teeny tiny decisions\nwell the reverse is that is also true as\nwell nobody becomes\nuh super fit by doing one push-up no\nit's a bunch of little teeny tiny\ndecisions it's push-ups it's going for\nthe run it's working out a little bit\nlonger than you were planning it's\nyou know looking at yourself in the gym\nand saying you know what i need to eat\nhealthier it's changing your eating\nhabits it's a bunch of little teeny tiny\ndecisions it's not one big massive event\nit's tiny decisions day after day after\nday after day that compound into massive\nresults years down the road you know\nnobody gets smart from reading one book\nno it's the little tiny habits of saying\ni'm going to read 10 pages every single\nday the average book is about 300 to 350\npages so i should finish a book every\nsingle month which means that i could\nfinish 12 books this month i'm sorry\nthis year when was the last time you did\n12 books and finished 12 books an entire\nyear\nright it's not about\nconquering the world at this very moment\nit's just little teeny tiny decisions\nand little teeny tiny habits that make\nyou who you are so you need to decide\nwho are you\nand who do you want to become\nis it the person that you've always been\nis that who you are or do you want to\nstep into a new version of yourself are\nyou the type of person to sleep in or\nare you the type of person to wake up\nearly\nyou can make that decision right now and\nthen have your actions\nline up with whatever you decide\nare you the type of person to\nspend a lot of money and buy a lot of\nluxurious things or you're the type of\nperson to save your money as it comes in\nyou can make that decision right now are\nyou the type of person to\nyou know skip workouts or you're the\ntype person that says no matter how\ntired i am i'm going to work out five\ntimes a week i'm working out monday\nthrough friday every single day no\nmatter what happens\nare you the type of person to eat\nunhealthy or are you the type of person\nto look at the calories and the intake\nthat you have every single day and do\nthe research needed to figure out what\nit takes to have a healthy diet\nyou decide there's nobody else in this\nworld that's decide which is the best\nthing and the thing that that most\npeople see in living in this world of\ninstant gratification is we scroll on\ninstagram and we see people who have\nthese incredible bodies and go yeah but\ni'm just not there and we see people\nhave these incredible lives and we think\nyeah i'm just not there we have seen\npeople have these incredible houses\nthink yeah i'm just not there you see\npeople have these cars and these travel\nand you're saying i'm just not there\nthis happiness this joy this love you\nthink i'm not there you're not there yet\nbut you can change your life right in\nthis very moment which will then change\nyour circumstances in the future not in\nthis current moment because we're so\nused to instant gratification and we\nthink hey i'm if i make a change today i\nwant results tomorrow and that's not how\nit works one of my favorite phrases is\nthe journey of a thousand miles begins\nwith a single step all too often we're\nso used to getting instant gratification\nin everything that we do by having our\nphones with us i can get my food\ndelivered\neverything's right now right now right\nnow\nright and so\nwe think with the journey of a thousand\nmiles it begins a single step that\nwithin two weeks i should be at the\nthousandth mile when in reality every\nday is just another step and so\ni'm 14 days in i'm super excited to go\nand i start into this new path and i'm\nexcited day one i'm excited day two and\nday 14 hits and i'm like i'm over this i\nwant to give up i'm not as far along i'm\nnot seeing the results that i want i'm\nnot seeing the body that i wanted i'm\nnot seeing the bank account that i\nwanted i'm not seeing the happiness\nwhatever it is that you're working\ntowards\nwhen in reality we're not supposed to be\nat mile 1000 yet\nwe're only 14 steps in because every day\nis just one extra step\nand you can't compare your chapter one\nto someone else's chapter 20. if i just\nstarted working out in eating healthy\ntoday\ni can't look at someone on instagram and\ngo oh but i'll never be there because\nyou're looking at someone who could have\nbeen on this health journey for five\nyears for four years for ten years\ni can eventually be there and i can tell\nmyself i can eventually be there but\nit's going to take\na single step every single day one\npercent better today than i was\nyesterday one percent better than i was\nyesterday one percent better than i was\nyesterday one percent better than what i\nwas yesterday and so you have to you\nhave to figure out who do you want to\nbecome in 10 years\ntony robbins says most people\noverestimate what they can do in a year\nbut they underestimate what they can do\nin a decade and so you think who do i\nwant to be in 10 years what type of bank\naccount do i want business do i want\nfamily do i want relationships do i want\nhappiness do i want cars do i want\nclothes whatever it is that that tickles\nyour fam whatever tickles your tots\nright what do you want you have to\nfigure out what you want in 10 years and\nthen you have to look and you say do my\ncurrent actions line up with that life\ndo my current actions match up with the\nfuture that i'm going to have do my\ncurrent actions in my current habits\nline up with the income\nthe person that you know if i if i want\nto make a million dollars in a year\ndo my actions today line up with the\ntype of person who has a million dollar\nincome what you do is you see the life\nthat you want and you start going well\nif i want to be that person in 10 years\nif i want to be in this place in 10\nyears who do i need to become in order\nto have that life\nand what you do is you start making a\nlist you start planning out who you need\nto become and then what you do you take\nthat list and you put it into today and\nyou say okay well the you know the\nperfect version of myself would wake up\nearly okay i'm going to make sure that i\nwake up early tomorrow morning\nperfect version of myself would work out\nfive times a week all right well then i\nneed to work out tomorrow and you start\nmaking these little teeny tiny\nincremental changes in every little tiny\nhabit in trait and decision compounds on\ntop of itself\nit's never\nwhat you need to do and this is going to\nsound it's going to make sense once i\ntell you this it's going to sound like\ni'm actually saying going against what i\njust said but i'll explain it it's never\nwhat you need to do\nto get the life you want it's who you\nneed to become in order to get the life\nthat you want now i understand you said\nrob the past 18 minutes you'll be\ntalking about all the things that i need\nto do yes but you have to realize this\nit's easier to do those things when you\nbecome the person that does those things\nbecause we have this internal story\nthat's going on in our head so if i look\nat who i want to be in 10 years and i\nsay what habits and traits and all of\nthat do i need to put into myself and\ninstill into myself in order to have\nthis life then you will automatically if\nyou become that person then you will\nautomatically do those things that you\nneed to do\nand so you have to realize though that\nthe better beautiful thing about life\nin success and happiness and joy and all\nthe things that you want is you're only\na couple small habits away from the life\nthat you want\nyou really truly are like we think\nthere's all of these millions of things\nwe need to change in our life you're\nfive to ten\nsmall habits away from a completely\ndifferent person a year from today\nand that should get you excited you're\nyou probably need to there's a few i'm\ngoing to give you a list of most of the\npeople listening and watching this i'm\ngoing to get the majority of your things\nout of the way right now number one you\nprobably need to wake up earlier number\ntwo you probably need to have a morning\nroutine number three you probably need\nto meditate number four you probably\nneed to read more number five you\nprobably need to eat healthy number six\nyou probably need to stop\nprocrastinating number seven you\nprobably need to stop making excuses\nnumber eight you probably need to take\nfull ownership of everything in your\nlife um number four you probably need to\nstart i'm sorry number nine you probably\nneed to uh to work out four times a week\nat least and number 10 you probably need\nto stop watching tv and stop watching\nthe news\nthat's\nthe majority of people who are listening\nto this\nand those are little tiny things\ndone every single day it's not like you\nneed to run a thousand miles right now\nit's just what do i need to do out of\nthose 10 things and what do i need to do\noutside of those 10 things and put them\ninto my day and make sure that i'm doing\nthem every single day and improving it\nevery single day it's not about being a\ncompletely different person tomorrow\nit's about being one percent better\ntomorrow than you were today\nso you have to decide\nwith this personal development and life\njourney is this a journey that you want\nto take\nis this a lifestyle that you want to\nhave\nof i want to get better every single day\nof kaizen of constant never-ending\nimprovement in everything that you do is\nit a hobby or is it a lifestyle\nis it something that you just do like\ngoing and playing tennis on the weekends\nor is this who you\nare that's what you have to realize\nand you have to realize this\nwhen you try to push yourself there's\nalways going to be resistance\nat the point of change in your life is\nwhen you're going to meet the most\nresistance you have to push through them\nand so what i would say to you right now\nif you have time take five minutes get a\npen and paper out and ask yourself what\nare the five to ten\nlittle small habits that you need to\nchange in yourself\nidentify them take action right now\nand the second thing i'm gonna say is\nhow can you make it easier to take those\nlittle tiny habits and put them in your\nday every single day to just become one\npercent better\nthat's it\nbut you have to decide right now is this\na hobby to you or is it a lifestyle\nare you on the road of constant\nnever-ending improvement that's once\nagain that is constant never-ending\nwhich means that you do it every single\nday constant never-ending improvement\nor is it just a hobby of something that\nyou do sometimes\nif it's a hobby no judgment that's\nbeautiful you can do whatever you like\nin this world that's what's cool about\nit you can do whatever you want but if\nit's a lifestyle you gotta get serious\nand realize\nall you have to do is just become a tiny\nbit better every single day focus on\nsmall incremental changes and remind\nyourself every morning it's only about\ngetting one percent better than you were\nyesterday\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well you just\nsaved yourself 18 to 19 years of\nfiguring it out when i talk about being\nsuccessful doesn't just mean money it's\njust a bunch of little unsexy things and\nthat's what we're gonna dive into is\nseven really unsexy things"
