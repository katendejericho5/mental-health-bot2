    "transcript": "oh\ni have to get out of bed at six o'clock\nno you get to get out of bed at six\no'clock do you know why because 150 000\npeople will die today\n[Applause]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to shift your words just a little\nteeny tiny bit\ni'm talking like the smallest shift in\nthe world and how that shift can\ncompletely change the way that you see\nand view the world but then also the way\nthat you feel about the things that you\ndo as well and before i dive into it and\ntell you what the actual word is because\nwhy would i want to give it to you right\naway let me go ahead and lay the\ngroundwork in the foundation so you\nrealize why this is so important so i'm\ngoing to give you an example of how\nsimple just a simple change of words can\nreally change the way that you see\nthings the way that you act the way that\nyou feel and the way that you view\neverything around you as well and\ni'm going to give you this this example\nyou know words are so so so so powerful\nthey can literally change the state that\nyou are in and so right now you might\njust be in a normal chill state nothing\nreally crazy\nbut just think if someone comes up to\nyou and they say hey i love you\nhow would that make you feel by just\nsomeone saying that now what if someone\ncomes up to you and says hey you look\nreally amazing today\nhow would that make you feel how to make\nyou feel if they say hey your shirt\nlooks really great with your eyes\nhow would that make you feel\nwhat if they come up to you and say man\nyou look so pretty today you look so\nhandsome today\nhow would that make you feel\nthink about that for a second\nwhat if they come up to you and say hey\ni love your haircut i love the way that\nyou did your hair today how does that\nmake you feel simply just by the words\nthat someone's using when they come up\nto you\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nwords can make you feel amazing can't\nthey if they're said to you the right\nway\nnow let's flip it on its head what if\nsomeone comes up and says i hate you and\nthey say it in a really loud screaming\nway i hate you i hate everything about\nyou\nyou treat people like trash\ni've never respected you you've never\nrespected me\nyou know you you'll never be good enough\nsomeone comes up to you and says those\ntypes of things\nhow would that make you feel now you\ncould brush it off and be like oh\nwhatever right but how'd that actually\nmake you feel\nthink about that for a second because\nthe words that you use and the words\nthat other people use around you if\nyou're not careful can really change the\nstate that you're and they can make you\nfeel amazing\nor they can make you feel absolutely\nterrible\nso words are extremely extremely\npowerful and you have to think about\nthis and really understand how powerful\nwords actually are\nyou know somebody could come up to you\nand they could say a derogatory word\nbased off of what you look like what sex\nyou are what gender what you identify\nwith\nwhat nationality you are whatever it is\nthey could say a derogatory word how\ncould that that word could literally\nyou'd be having an amazing day\nsomeone could cut you off or you could\naccidentally cut someone off and they\ncome in they flip you the bird and then\nthey call you something that's extremely\nderogatory and it could change the state\nof your day just by a couple simple\nwords\nisn't that true\nso words are extremely powerful\njust think about how much those words\ncan completely change your state\nnow the question i have for you around\nthis is how much do you pay attention to\nthe words that you use every single day\nhow much do you pay attention to them\nsee when i talk to somebody\nand i learned this from being a coach\nfor years and years and years and years\nis to listen to somebody\nbut to really\nreally intently listen to every single\nword that they use and the reason why is\nbecause especially when someone's on a\nstream of conscious and they're just\nspeaking\nwhat happens is they use words and\nphrases that they're not necessarily\npaying attention to but it's they'll\ngive you little seeds they'll drop\nlittle hints of what's actually going on\nin their mind and you can see how they\nview the world or how that's holding\nthem back\nand so i always say that if you listen\nintently enough it's kind of like\ngetting a little bit of a window into\nsomeone's subconscious and so\nthe thing that i want you to talk the\nflip that i want you to think of is this\ni want you to think of the things that\nyou get to do\nright think of the things that you get\nto do\nright just think of one thing that you\nget to do what is that thing have it in\nyour mind real quick and i want you to\nreally think about that think about that\nthing what is something that you get to\ndo what is it\nand when you think about that thing that\nyou get to do\nhow does that make you feel when you\nthink about that thing that you get to\ndo\nhow does that make you feel does it make\nyou feel amazing does it make you feel\nloved does it make you feel happy does\nit make you feel grateful how does it\nmake you feel to think of that thing\nthat you get to do\nhow do you feel doing that thing\nthat thing that you get to do how do you\nfeel when you get to do it right how do\nyou feel right now just thinking about\nthat thing that you get to do\nthink of another thing think of things\nthat you get to do\njust really try hard with me here what\nare some things that you get to do\nhow do you feel right now in this moment\nthinking about those how do you feel\nwhen you get to do those things\nokay now let me ask you this question\nwhat's something that you have to do\nwhat is something that you have to do\nthink of that think of one thing just\nbring it up into your mind what is that\none thing that you have to do\nwhat is it\nyou know when you when you're doing that\nthing that you have to do how do you\nfeel when you're doing that thing that\nyou have to do how do you feel when you\nhave when you do that thing you have to\ndo\nmaybe not excited pissed off wishing you\nwere doing something else\nright\nhow do you feel thinking about those\nthings that you have to do oh man later\non i have to do this what how do you\nfeel just thinking about not even\nactually doing it right now but how do\nyou feel thinking about the thing that\nyou have to do later on today\nhow do you feel\nnow let me tell you something\nnotice i use two different words\nget to do\nand have to do\nget and have to do\nand all too often i hear people say i\nhave to do this\nand i can tell by the tone of their\nvoice\nthat they're not excited about it and\nhere's the thing i don't think that\nanybody should do anything in this world\nthat they don't love now do people do\nstuff they don't love absolutely but\nhere's the thing if you craft your life\naround enough things and really start to\nthink about the things that you're doing\nif you start to craft it around what you\nlove to do then you get to do things now\ni understand some of you guys are\nlistening to me and you're like rob but\ni have to do these things i have to pay\nthe bills of course i'm not talking\nabout not doing those things what i'm\ngoing to talk with you right now is\nabout flipping the way that you view the\nthings that you have to do\nso let me give an example lots of people\nsay oh later on today i have to work out\nokay is it that you have to work out\nor is it that you get to work out\nimagine if you just switched the way\nthat you said it so let me explain and\nlet me go deeper into it i have to work\nout today it's a phrase of like i don't\nwant to freaking work out today but i'm\ngonna have to push myself to do it right\nnow just think about the mentality of\nhaving to do that having to work out\nversus i get to work out today and let\nme explain why i say that\nthink about how many people\nthink about how many people can't work\nout today\nbecause maybe they're fully paralyzed\nthey're quadriplegic they can't work out\nat all\nthey can't go in and do bicep curls they\ncan't go run on a treadmill they can't\ngo play basketball\nfor them\nif they got to work out\ntheir phrase that they would say to\nthemselves is i get to work out today\nnow think about how the shift happens in\nyour brain of i have to work out versus\ni get to work out\nthere's a shift isn't it\nand it's only one word difference you\nflip have to get so you should never\nhave to do something but you should\nalways get to do something i have to\nwork out today think about all the\npeople that would love\nto be able to be in your shoes to do the\nworkout that you quote-unquote have to\ndo no you get to work out today you get\nto walk into the gym because there's so\nmany people that would love to walk into\nthat gym that would love to walk on the\ntreadmill they would love to be able to\nhold on to a basketball and throw it and\nbe able to do some bicep curls but they\ncan't\nso you get to work out now you have to\nwork out\ni have to get out of bed at six o'clock\nno you get to get out of bed at six\no'clock do you know why because 150 000\npeople will die today\nthat's the statistic 150 000 people die\nevery single day you get to get out of\nbed every single morning not you have to\nget out of bed every single morning\nthink about how the thought of just i\nhave to get up\nversus i get to get up can change your\nperception of the entire day if someone\ncan cut you off and say a few words to\nyou and that can ruin the state that\nyou're in for the entire day don't you\nthink the words that you say to yourself\nin the moments when it's just you\nactually cut even deeper into your\nsubconscious than that person that you\ndon't know\nof course\nyou don't have to get out of bed\nyou get to get out of bed you were\nblessed enough to be able to get out of\nbed today\nsimple shift right\ni have to go to work\nyou have to go to work\neven if you hate your job you get to go\nto work\nbecause there's so many people that are\nunemployed right now 35 million 30\nmillion people i think are unemployed\nright now they would love to be able to\ntake a job that you're going to that you\nquote unquote have to go to no you don't\nhave to go to that job\nyou could stay home\nnow you wouldn't be able to pay your\nbills but you don't have to do anything\nno no you get to go to that job ugh i\nhave to go grocery shopping today\nreally you have to or you get to\nyou get to go to the grocery store and\nbe able to buy food do you mean people\naren't going to eat today\nit's not that you have to do it you get\nto go to the grocery store\nyou get to be able to afford a meal for\nyou and your family\nthink about how this it's a small shift\nbut think about how this could change\nthe way that you start to view the world\nnot i have to do this thing i get to do\nthis thing\nthink about how that little shift could\ncompletely change the way that you see\nthe world around you\nright i have to fill up my gas\nor do you get to fill up your gas\ndo you mean people would love to have\nyour car\ndo many people love to not have to ride\na bike or walk or take the bus anymore\nno you get\nto fill up your car\ni have to feed my children\nno no you get to feed your children\ntoo many people have lost children in\ntheir lives you get to feed them\nyou don't have to do anything in this\nworld you could literally stay in bed\nall day every day if you wanted to now\nlet's be real you lose your job you lose\nyour children you lose your house you\nlose your bed and you'd be homeless and\nyou could then you could stay outside\nand you could lay on the bed or on the\nground forever if you wanted to\nthat's your choice\nlife is full of choices you can make\nwhatever choice you want but it's never\nthat you have to do something it's that\nyou get to do something there are so\nmany people that would trade places with\nyou like that if they could don't ever\ntell me or tell someone else or even\ntell yourself more than anyone else\ndon't ever tell yourself that you have\nto do something no with every single\nchoice that you make every single moment\nin your life you are making the choice\nto do what you're doing\ndon't blame anybody else\nyou get to do these things so that's the\nbeautiful thing you get to go to this\njob even if you hate your job with a\npassion i get it i have hated my jobs\nwith a passion before as well\nbut hey\nit's at least feeding you for now right\nyou don't have to stay there forever\nonce again you don't have to stay there\nyou can leave if you want to it's up to\nyou that's your choice everything in\nthis world is a choice that's the\nbeautiful thing about it but you don't\nhave to go there you get to go there and\nguess what\nif you decide to leave one day you leave\none day\nbut you've made the decision to go there\nnobody else has\nand this is the this is really the shift\nwhere you start to realize\nwhen you stop saying i have to do things\nyou realize that nobody is in control of\nyou the only one that's in control of\nyou is you and you at this point in time\nhave to look at your life and go i've\nmade all the decisions to get me to\nwhere i am i can't blame it on the\npresident i can't blame it on the\ngovernment i can't blame it on my\nparents i can't blame it on my past i\ncan't blame it on my spouse that did xyz\ni can't blame it on this person or the\ncar crash or that accident or this\nperson no\nonce you take full 100 ownership of\nevery single action that happens in your\nlife and everything that you do\nthat's when\nmost people think that's scary to think\nthat i it's all on my shoulders no\nthat's so empowering because it shows\nyou that from this moment on you're in\ncontrol of every single act actually\nyou've always been in control of every\nsingle action but now i know every\nsingle action is an action that i have\nchosen to take not that i have to take\nbut i have chosen to take it even if\nit's not the one that i want at this\nmoment i have chosen to take it and i\nget to take it\nbecause guess what\nas i said\nyou know there's a lot of people that\nwish that they could work out\nit's not that you have to work out\nthere's a lot of people that wish that\nthey were still alive\nbut they died there's a lot of people\nthat have to go to or that don't have a\njob you get to go to work there's a lot\nof people that\naren't able to feed their family\nyou get to be able to feed your family\nthere's a lot of people that aren't able\nto\ntake a car to go fill up because they\ndon't have one you have a car there's a\nlot of people that aren't able to feed\ntheir children you get to feed your\nchildren so take that switch and next\ntime you notice yourself saying i have\nto do\nthis\nbecome very self-aware take yourself\noutside of yourself and look\nat your current circumstance and say no\nno\ni have to take full ownership of\neverything in my life and i have to say\ni get to do this\nwhat's beautiful about this is if you\nstart saying i get to do things your\nperception of them flip and you start to\ndo things with more happiness with more\njoy with more peace once again when i\nsaid just a few minutes ago think of all\nthe things that you get to do and how\nthat makes you feel think about how you\nfelt when i said that\noh i get to see my children i get to\ndrop them off i get to be a parent i get\nto be a spouse i get to be a\nmentor whatever it is that you get to do\nand then when i say think of things that\nyou have to do you're like\noh my god there's so many things i have\nto do that i just don't want to do\nright there's so many things but think\nabout if you switched him if everything\nthat you felt that you had to do\nimagine if you could feel better about\nall those things by just flipping the\nwords that you use because once again as\ni started this episode that's why i had\nto start this episode talking about how\npowerful words are the words that you\nuse are so powerful\nmake sure that you're using the words\nthat are empowering to you and not\ndisempowering because you never have to\ndo anything but you get to do everything\nthat you're doing and i guarantee you\nthat there's so many people in this\nworld that would trade places for you in\nan instant if they had the opportunity\nto\nso go in with the attitude of i get to\ndo things and see how much that changes\nyour perception of your life the things\nthat you do and the world around you as\nwell\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if you\nbelieve\nthat the world is going to\nyou will see all of the ways\nthat the world is going to"
