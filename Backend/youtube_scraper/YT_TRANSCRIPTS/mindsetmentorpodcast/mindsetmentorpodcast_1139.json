    "transcript": "[Music]\nhow many times have you set a goal or\nyour new year's resolution\nand then completely forgotten about the\nnew year's resolution of the goal\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nimprove your goal hitting by using this\none simple goal setting technique and so\nthere's a thing called pearson's law and\nthat's what we're going to dive into\ntoday pearson's law says this\nwhen performance is measured performance\nimproves when performance is measured\nand reported back\nthe rate of improvement accelerates so\nwhat exactly does that mean well if you\nwant to\ntrack something that you're trying to\nget better at you will improve\nif you track something and report it\nback to somebody else the rate that\nyou're going to improve gets way better\nand so let me give you an example of how\ni could use how you could use it how\ni've used it before even with some of my\nclients in the past about four years ago\ni had a client that started working with\nme and the first thing he wanted to work\non was he wanted to lose some weight and\nnow in no form of anything am i a weight\nloss coach i'm not a fitness coach any\nof those things but i knew pearson's law\nand so we used it to our advantage so if\nhe were to go and just jump on the scale\nevery single morning and look at what he\nweighed if he was trying to lose weight\nhe would lose weight just because the\nfact that he would be measuring it\nbut if he has to report back to me every\nsingle week with his exact weight\nhe's going to improve exponentially\nso this is what we did i had him buy a\nscale that was connected to his phone\nthrough bluetooth and every single\nmorning he is required to get on to that\nscale\nhave his phone read it through bluetooth\nwhich automatically logs his body weight\nhis body fat percentage uh his muscle\nmass his water weight all of those\nthings and it just you step on it within\ntwo seconds it's automatically logged\ninside your phone and then every week\nwhen we had our calls he would have to\nsend me the screenshot of every single\nweigh-in from the week before which kept\nhim on track but also gave him somebody\nto hold him accountable to what he knew\nhe was supposed to do and just this\nsimple strategy improved his weight loss\nexponentially so he weighed about 2 30\nwhen we first started working together\nand he lost about 35 pounds within the\nfirst four months of us working together\nsimply because he was tracking\nevery single day so he could see if he\nwas improving or he could see if he's\ngetting worse and on the days that he\ngot worse it then made him go to the gym\nand work out harder because he knew that\nwe were going to be talking every single\nweek to improve this and so once again\nat its simplest form if you track it it\nwill improve if you track it and have to\ntell somebody your results weekly you'll\nimprove exponentially because now you\nhave an accountability partner and think\nabout this\nit's super important quantification in\nyour life and in your business\nare critical to your success if you\nthink about it no company just goes you\nknow what we're gonna just wing it this\nmonth we're gonna wing it this year and\njust hopefully we do well no they come\ndown they sit down and say okay we're\ngonna sit down their sales team we're\ngoing to figure out exactly what it is\nthat we need to do how much we need to\nhave them sell this month then they go\nand they sit down with their finance\ndepartment and they have to make a\nbudget they have to track all these\nthings and they have to figure out their\np ls and that's exactly how your life\nshould be the same way that you go into\nplanning a business and making a\nbusiness plan you should go into\nplanning your life in acting and being\nas serious as you would with a business\non your own personal life and so when\nwe're working towards a goal we have to\ntrack everything that we have going on\nand we have to make sure that we have\nsomeone to hold us accountable to it\nthis could be how much money you want to\nmake this could be how much you want to\nsave this could be you know how much\nweight you want to lose how much weight\nyou want to gain how often you want to\ngo\nto the gym\nwhat you're going to be eating how often\nyou go on date nights with your spouse\nhow many times you show up to\nto your house after work before six\no'clock instead of staying home late\nevery single night and working\nthese are all things that can be tracked\nmeasured and then recorded and brought\nback to somebody else to hold you\naccountable because how often think\nabout this\njust really honestly think about this\nfor a second how many times have you set\na goal or your new year's resolution\nand then completely forgotten about the\nnew year's resolution of the goal\nthink about that\nyou set a goal you're all excited it's\njanuary 1st you're going to go in you\nwant to hit this goal\ntwo months later you're like what the\nhell are my new year's resolutions how\ndo you remember what they were\nthink about how often you've set goals\nfor yourself or set new year's\nresolutions\nthen let's just take new year's\nresolutions out of it let's take that\ncompletely out of it because it happens\nonce a year how many times have you set\ngoals for yourself a daily goal a weekly\ngoal a monthly goal a quarterly goal and\nthen nothing happens you look back after\nyour quarterly goal three months down\nthe road and you're in the exact same\nposition that you were before\nfinancially mentally physically all of\nthose things are exactly the same so you\nhave to take this pearson's law and say\nokay i need to get really good at\nquantifying my entire life i need to get\nreally good at quantifying my entire\nbusiness why because numbers can be\ntracked and if you can track them you\ncan record them and if you can record\nthem you can give them to somebody else\nto hold you accountable to them i bet 95\npercent of the reason why people don't\nhit their goals myself included in the\npast this as well is simply because they\ndon't track them they don't put them\ndown and then they don't develop a\nsystem\nto hold themselves accountable\nthroughout the entire year to hit this\ngoal you know businesses that are\nsuccessful sit down and plan out how to\nbe successful and run a successful\nbusiness people who have successful\nlives as weird as it might sound to you\nsit down and plan out goals with their\nlives and then have people to hold them\naccountable to them you know if you say\ni want to save six thousand dollars this\nyear\namazing perfect let's go ahead and take\nthat goal and figure out how to make it\nmeasurable\nand how you can hold yourself\naccountable to it so if you want to save\nsix thousand dollars this year that\nwould be about five hundred dollars per\nmonth about 125 dollars per week right\nso for some of you might say six\nthousand dollars that's nothing to me\nsome of you guys might say six thousand\ndollars that's the world to me okay\nwe'll just take this example as you know\njust simple proof i wanna i wanna save\nsix thousand dollars this year that's\nfive hundred dollars a month i'm gonna\ncall it my best friend and i'm gonna say\nhey you know i want you to hold me\naccountable i'm going to check in with\nyou every single month january 1st\nfebruary 1st march so on so on so on i'm\ngoing to set a reoccurring\nevent inside of my schedule that's going\nto link up to your schedule that's going\nto say i have to call you at the\nbeginning of every single month and tell\nyou how much money i've saved\ncan i get your can i get your your you\nholding me accountable is that okay\nyour friend's like yeah of course you\ncan do that cool perfect i'm going to\nsend you out the calendar right now just\nmake sure you accept it it's going to be\nfor every the first of every single\nmonth this year and then what happens\nit pops up you now have to call them\nbecause they're expecting your call\nbecause they literally have to hold you\naccountable because it's in their\ncalendar as well\nyou call them up and you say hey\njohn\ni i saved 400 this month john's gonna go\nif john's a good accountability partner\njohn's gonna go well isn't that less\nthan you told me you wanted to save per\nmonth yes it is okay so what are you\ngoing to do about it\nwell if i was supposed to get 500 and\nsay 500 this month and i only saved 400\nthat means that this next month i need\nto save 600. so my goal for this month\nto hold myself accountable to stay on\ntrack is i need to hit 600.\nokay great you go and let's say you you\ndo 600 boom you're back on track perfect\nthat's what you want is someone that you\nknow that you have to report back to\nin a quantity that you can go and say\nlisten this is the number this is what i\nneed to hold you accountable hold me\naccountable to it's so simple but it's\nso overlooked by most people most people\nusually don't even think about it hey if\nyou're enjoying this video do me a favor\nand hit that like button down below it\nhelps with the youtube algorithm so that\nmore people can see this message because\nit helps us get it out organically so\nhit that like button and i appreciate\nyou\nsame goes for health for your weight\nloss let's say you're like okay john i\nwant to lose 25 pounds this year it's\njanuary 1st i want to lose 25 pounds\nthis year that's about 2 pounds per\nmonth i'm going to put something in your\nschedule january february march 1st for\nall of those and i have to call you back\nand tell you exactly what i weigh so\nhere's what we're going to do i'm going\nto call you i weigh\nyou know two let's make the math easy\n225 pounds i want to get to 200 that's 2\npounds per month i have to be at 223 by\nthe next time i call you\nyou call john up you have to tell him\nwhat you weigh\nyou want to make it even better do\nexactly what i was saying get a\nbluetooth uh scale force yourself to\njump on it every single day and if you\nreally want to have john hold you\naccountable send him a screenshot of\nwhat you weigh every single week and\nmake sure that you check in you say john\ni have to check i have to weigh myself\nevery single day i want you to hold me\naccountable to that every single day and\ni'm going to send you the screenshot\nevery single week boom you send him the\nscreenshot every single week he looks at\nit and he's like hey you only you only\nweighed yourself five times last week\nwhat happened oh yeah and you make\nexcuses excuses are like buttholes\neverybody's got them and they all stink\njohn hopefully isn't gonna take your\nexcuses he's gonna go hey rob i don't\ncare about what happened last week you\nmissed it twice that wasn't your goal\nyou need to get it to me seven times you\nknow check in seven times over this next\nweek how does that sound good can we\nagree to that boom what's good about\nthis is that if he holds you hardcore\naccountable to what your goals are he\nprobably also has goals that he wants\nyou to hold him accountable to so you\ncreate this accountability partnership\nwhere you guys are both trying to help\neach other hit your goals\nso then if you come in and at the end of\nthe month you only lost one pound maybe\nyou gained a pound oh my gosh he better\nbe on you to fix that that's for sure\nand so that's how you create this\naccountability relationship do you have\nsomeone in your life that you can check\nin with every single week or check in\nwith every single month if not you need\nto change your your sphere of influence\nyou got to have at least one person\nthat's in your corner that loves you\nunconditionally that wants the best for\nyou and has no ulterior motive to want\nto help you they just want to see you\nthrive if you don't have enough of those\npeople in your life go out and get more\nof them you need them even if it's just\none\nyou need to have one of those people\nthat's in your life you know i i a\ncouple years ago my girlfriend i started\nsitting down with our new year's\nresolutions and planning them out\ntogether and saying hey this is my goal\nfor this year i want you to hold me\naccountable to it i give you full\npermission to call me out on my\nand tell me if i'm messing up\ncan you do that for me yes\nand i need you to tell me this if i call\nyou out in your bs and you give me full\npermission call you on your bs can you\nmake sure that no emotions are involved\nwe don't get mad at each other this\ndoesn't turn into a fight i'm going to\ncome to you and say hey listen\ni'm going to come to you with love and\nsay listen this is what your goal was\nyou're short on your goal\nwe need to change this what's your plan\nto change\nand this is how you improve\nexponentially you know without weekly or\nmonthly measurement\nyou can't make adjustments to your goals\nso if you know for instance like i said\nyou want to you want to have 500 that\nyou save every single week if you don't\nhave that number then you're not i'm\njust going to be honest with you you're\nnot going to save six thousand dollars\nover the course of the year most likely\nbut if you know\nokay i'm only at 400 and then you look\nat you say i need to make some\nadjustments what are the adjustments i\nneed to make okay i need to stop eating\nout as much i probably spent an extra\n100 bucks just eating out okay maybe i\nshouldn't have coffee in the mornings\nfrom starbucks maybe i should make\ncoffee because it cost me 25 cents\nversus 5 bucks and you start making\nsmall incremental adjustments same thing\nwith weight same thing with working out\nokay i only worked out three times last\nweek i didn't hit my goal maybe i need\nto hit up work out four times this week\nokay let me look at what i ate every\nsingle day last week if i look back oh\nmy gosh i probably shouldn't have that\nburgers and fries when i was out you\nknow i also ate that at 11 o'clock which\nis the worst time to eat burgers and\nfries and you can make small incremental\nadjustments when you start to track\neverything that's going on because\nrarely do we set a goal\nmake a plan to hit that goal and then\njust hit it our first try there's a\nlittle adjustments that need to be\nhad over the course of a month or course\nof a year and when you track all of\nthese things it makes it really easy to\nlook back\nand go ah there's my mistake i can point\nout my mistake right there\nthat day that week that action that\nhabit and you can make small incremental\nadjustments just as if i'm gonna i'm in\naustin if i want to go to houston there\nmight be a car accident at some point in\ntime my gps is going to take me there\nbut if there's a car accident i'm gonna\nhave ways waze is gonna take me around\nthat accident hopefully and get me there\ndetours in your life are necessary on\nyour road to hitting your goals but\nif you're not tracking it number one if\nyou don't know what the goal is you know\nactually know what the goal is and the\nquantity that can't quantify it it's\ngonna be really hard to hit the goal\nand if you don't track it then you can't\nmake adjustments but when you know the\ngoal exactly you're very clear on it\nyou track everything that you do it's\nsuper simple to look back at how the\nlast week when how the last month went\nand go this is these are little tweaks\nthat i need to make because we have to\nmake detours things come up that's just\nthe way that it goes you know we're\ngoing to fall short some weeks we're not\ngoing to be perfect all the time that's\npart of being a human but here's the\nthing when you fall short you can't get\nemotional about it you can't get pissed\noff at yourself you can't judge yourself\nyou've got to look at it as if it was a\nbusiness and you go okay the business is\nnot doing well in here here and here\nwhat are the things that we need to\nimprove you look at your life and you\nsay i'm gonna look at my life like a\nbusiness i'm not gonna put any emotion\ninto it i'm gonna say here are the\nthings that i need to improving on what\nadjustments do i need to make here here\nand here to make those little tiny\nadjustments so as you're listening to\nthis i want you to think about this in\nyour life and say how can i use\npearson's law knowing\neverything that i just said to put it\ninto my life to improve my life and to\nimprove it exponentially and then who is\nthe person that i'm going to bring on\nand say hey you're my ride or die we're\ngoing to do this together we're going to\ndo this before the end of the year we're\ngoing to do this over the course the\nwhole next year we're going to hold each\nother accountable even if you've never\ntalked about goals before who's that\nperson in your life\nif you don't know who they are\nidentify them if you don't have someone\nfind someone these are the types of\npeople that you need in your life if you\nlook around and you go none of these\npeople would ever hold me accountable to\nmy goals and they'd probably make fun of\nme if i shared my goals with them\nmaybe they're not the best person for\nyour life\nand i'm just saying it just maybe you\nshould spend less time with them spend\ntime with people who are supporting you\nwhat i want you to do is think this you\nknow when you're thinking about these\npeople to hold you accountable if you\nlook at them\nare they someone like the place that\nthey're in in their life do you want to\nbe in their position at some time in the\nfuture\nask yourself that whether they're a year\nahead five years ahead 10 years ahead do\nyou want to be in their place of the\nfuture or\nif you look at them and where they want\nto go and where they're not where they\nsay they want to go but where they're\nactually working at going do you see\nthem and go yeah this person's on the\nsame track as me like that's the thing\nthat i can say i've picked up mentors\nalong the way that are further ahead\nbut by far the one thing that's helped\nme out the most is since 2006 i've had a\nbest friend we talk almost every single\nday about our goals he's my business\npartner we've built multi-million dollar\nbusinesses together and we've grown\ntogether over the past 14 years i know\nthat if neither one of us had met each\nother we would be way further behind in\nour lives than us meeting each other and\nbe able to work together 14 years we've\nbeen working diligently diligently\ndiligently i mean he's been on the\npodcast his name is dean you guys have\nheard him before\nwe literally talk we've talked four\ntimes today alone\ndo you have someone like that that you\ncan they're your ride or die they're on\nyour side no matter what if you screw up\nyou have a bad day you can call them and\nthere's absolutely no judgment if you\ndon't it's okay not a big deal but now\nyou know who you need to search for\nbecause you need someone to not only\ntrack this stuff you're going to track\nit but you need to go back and actually\ntell them what it is so identify that\nperson\nfind that person and bring them into\nyour life because once again pearson's\nlaw says when performance is measured\nperformance improves when performance is\nmeasured and reported back the rate of\nimprovement accelerates the rate of\nimprovement accelerates\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well today\nwe're going to be talking about the six\nsteps to hit any goal you want coming up"
