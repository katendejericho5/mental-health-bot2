    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you a process to help you have\nless anxiety to plan out your future to\ncreate the life that you want let's dive\nin this is something that you may have\nnever really thought of before I've\ntalked about this before in the past but\num really diving into and thinking about\nthe worst that could happen and uh this\nisn't like visualization this is\nactually what I would like to call\nreverse visualization you know I've done\nI've done many episodes about the the\nthe importance of visualization inside\nof my book level up there's an entire\nhalf of a chapter that is about how to\nvisualize and how to get better at it\nand study after study after study shows\nhow visualization can help you create\nthe life that you want there's studies\nthat show that if you visualize actually\nworking out and you visualize um your\nmuscles Contracting that it can actually\nincrease strength not by doing anything\nbut by visualizing it so your muscles\ncan get stronger by visualizing your\nmuscles contract and getting stronger\nthere's other studies that have showed\nvisualization can impact your emotional\nregulation help you get better at coping\nand um you know that that's not what\nwe're going to be talking about today\nwe're going to be talking about the\nexact opposite so instead of visualizing\nwhat you want we're going to talk about\nvisualizing what you don't want like the\nabsolute worst that could happen I'm\ngoing to take you through something\nthat's called negative visualization um\nwhich is also called defense pessimism\nand it originally comes from the the\nstoic philosophy the idea is to\nbasically visualize the thing that you\nare most afraid of\nhappening that sounds terrible doesn't\nit but there's a whole lot of science\nthere's a whole lot of reasons why and\nif you come along on this journey with\nme you'll see what I mean when you\nvisualize the worst that could happen it\nseems like a terrible idea and it seems\ncounterintuitive but you're going to\nhave to trust me it will make sense to\nyou and I'm going to show you how to use\nnegative visualization defense pessimism\nto actually um help you plan out and\ncreate the life that you want so let's\nsay for instance business right if you\nhave a business I definitely want you to\nvisualize what your business could be\nand how amazing it could be and and in\nbeing successful and changing the world\nand having all of the money and the time\nFreedom that you want I want you to\nvisualize that but I also want you to\nvisualize the other side I want you to\nvisualize you not taking action not\ntaking the action that you need to do to\ngrow your business maybe I want you to\nvisualize yourself making the excuses\ninstead of going to you know making the\ncold calls or going and knocking on\ndoors I want you to visualize laying on\nthe couch and scrolling on Instagram and\ngetting in your feelings and\nprocrastinating and I want you to\nvisualize the business completely\nfailing the worst that it can and just\ngoing up in\nFlames I want you to to visualize the\nabsolute worst that can happen in your\nbusiness as well as the best that could\nhappen and I want I want you to\nvisualize and I don't want you to\nvisualize like hey I'm going to fail\nbecause when I walk outside I'm going to\nget hit by media right it's going to\nkill my entire family that's not\nrealistic what I want you to do is\nvisualize what it would look like to\nfail and what it would feel like to fail\nand um this is actually a strategy I've\ndone in my business that that is really\nactually common in business it's called\npremortem and premortem means planning\nout how the business will fail and so\nwhen I brought on my coo she was really\ninterested in like hey I want to plan\nout the failure of this business so how\ncould this business fail if I come on\nand I do this job and you do that job\nand everybody else does this job and\nthis is what the or chart looks like how\ncould this business fail we planned out\nall of the different ways that it could\nfail and the reason why that's important\nis because it allows you to avoid and\nplan out all the failures if we could\nfail this way this way and this way\nthese are three ways the business could\nfail well now we can actually brainstorm\nhow to not fail now that we're aware of\nwhat those are so we we we visualize the\nworst that could happen so that we can\navoid the worst that could happen we can\nplan against it let's say your\nrelationship is another way right if\nyou're in a relationship I want you to\nvisualize how great that relationship\ncould be but I also want you to\nvisualize the end of that relationship I\nwant you to visualize you not making the\nrelationship a priority and what would\nhappen if you didn't I want you to\nvisualize you not showing up fully for\nyour partner and your partner starting\nto emotionally disconnect from you maybe\nthem cheating on you because of the fact\nthat you were so emotionally\ndisconnected because you were so unpr\ncuz you were at work all the time or\nwhat it would feel like to find out I\nwant you to visualize the worst that\ncould happen and I know it sounds like\nit sucks and it does suck but I want you\nto visualize the worst that could happen\nin the relationship ending so that\ntherefore you can realize what you\nshould not do and how to avoid that you\ncan make a plan of exactly what is that\nyou need to do I want you to visualize\nyour health right I want you to\nvisualize your health you know being in\nthe best shape you could possibly be but\nbut then what I want you to is I want\nyou to visualize you not making your\nhealth a priority I want you to\nvisualize saying oh I'm too busy to go\nto the gym and not going to the gym and\nnot eating the right foods and ignoring\nthe red flags and gaining the weight and\nI want you to visualize walking into the\ndoctor's office and then telling you\nthat you only have 6 months to live\nbecause of the decisions that you've\nmade in the past whatever it might be I\nwant you to visualize what that would\nfeel like what that would be like so\nthat you can start to see what it would\nbe like if you went down that road if\nyou have a job and you work for a\ncompany maybe you stress out about your\njob a lot I've been at the point where\nI've been like this isn't going to last\nlong I've been in those situations\nbefore maybe you stress out about like I\ndon't know how much longer I'm going to\nbe here I don't know if they're going to\nwant to keep me for much longer well I\nwant you to visualize what it would look\nlike to to you know maybe not take the\nthe right action to show your worth I\nwant you to visualize what it would look\nlike to to lose your job what it would\ndo what you would do after it right so\nvisualize that if you're a afraid of of\npublic speaking visualize you not\npreparing for a presentation not doing\nenough research not showing up prepared\nfumbling your words embarrassing\nyourself in front of the entire company\nI want you to visualize and feel what\nthat would feel like so you know what\nyou want to avoid I want you to\nvisualize just everything I want you to\nvisualize your entire life I want you to\nvisualize you being in a crossroad in\nyour life right now and if you go left\nit's that's you taking the action that\nyou want to creating the life that you\nwant to having the body that you want to\nthe business that you want to the\nrelationships that you want to\neverything but I want you to see on the\nleft instead of the right you visualize\nnot doing what you need to do to create\nthe life that you want not doing what\nyou need to do to create the best\nversion of yourself not living up to\nyour potential and getting to your\ndeathbed let's say you're 90 years old\nyou're at your deathbed and you regret\nnot living up to your potential you\nregret living a life that was just half\nlived now some of you are already\nfeeling anxious just thinking about it\naren't you good that's the point it's\ngood because we're going to talk about\nwhy this is important we're going to\ntalk about why we want to do this\nbecause it seems so counterintuitive to\nbe like I'm going to visualize all of\nthe that can happen like I'm\nalready stressed out I'm already\nstressed out throughout the day rob you\ntry to make me sit down to stress myself\nout yes because sometimes you need to\nfeel the pain in the moment because if\nyou don't feel it in the moment you're\ngoing to feel it in the future pain all\npain pain is is just a a your a stimulus\nin your body saying something needs to\nchange that's it so like if I if you're\nyou know let's say you're you're at the\nbeach and you have your your your\nBarefoot and you're walking off of the\nbeach onto the you're walking to your\ncar you're on the asphalt and you start\nto feel an immense pain in your feet\nbecause it's so hot outside that pain is\nyour body telling you do something\ndifferent whether that is run back to\nthe sand whether that run to your car\nwhether that has put your sandals on\nyour body is telling your brain hey do\nsomething different you got to do\nsomething different because we're in so\nmuch pain sometimes what we don't do\nenough is we don't think about the\nfuture pain we don't think about the\nfuture pain that will be coming based\noff our current decisions we like to act\nlike the future isn't going to be coming\nand and not take the right action what\nwe want to do is we want to feel pain in\nthe moment for what the future could be\nif we don't take the right actions\nand why do we want to do that because\nyou want to avoid that pain and so\nyou're actually going to start to make\nchanges in the moment to avoid that\nyou're going to start to make plans in\nthe moment to avoid that future pain you\nknow and it's there's a lot of\nuncertainty in life right it the cool\nthing about this though is that a lot of\nus are so so many people I talk to are\nso stressed out and so worried and so\nfearful about the future because the\nfuture is so uncertain well this\ntakes the uncertainty and makes you feel\nmore\ncertain you know it's it's never as bad\nas you think it's going to be but you\nstart to feel man if I don't make a\nchange with my health if I don't make a\nchange in my relationships if I don't\nmake a change in my business it's not\ngoing to be good and so it takes the\nuncertainty out it makes you feel more\ncertain it makes you go you know what I\nneed to actually make a\nchange another thing that's really\nimportant about the negative\nvisualization is actually desensitizes\nyou you will actually after doing this\ntomorrow the next day whatever it is as\nyou continue to do this you will have\nless anxiety because you've already seen\nthe path of destruction and now you want\nto avoid it right you've already seen so\nthere there's not really you're not\nuncertain anymore you know what it's\ngoing to be you know what your life is\ngoing to look like and you're like oh I\nget it now and so even though it's not\nwhat you want it desensitizes you\nbecause you're actually looking at it\nyou're not uncertain anymore you're like\noh this is what it's going to look like\nyou know there's a study was done in\n1996 and it was called Defensive\npessimism optimism in stimulating\nAlternatives and the research looked at\ndefense pessimism negative visualization\nalongside optimism and actually found\nthat visualizing negative Alternatives\nor imagining how past events could have\nbeen worse provided psychological\nbenefits so defense pessimists use these\nstrategies to alleviate anxiety and feel\nmore prepared and so there's been\nstudies on why this actually works I'm\nnot just some random podcaster just like\nspewing and stuff and you should trust\nthere's been studies on showing how this\nactually helps people feel more prepared\nand how to actually alleviate anxiety\nand so it desensitizes you in many\ndifferent ways the next thing that it\ndoes and one of the most important\nthings is it allows for strategic\nplanning like I gave you the example\nwith my business right the premortem\nprocess um what we did is we looked at\nthe business failing and we said it\ncould fail this way this way or this way\nand we put all of them on a piece of\npaper and then we said how can we make\nsure that we don't fail this way how can\nwe make sure we don't feel this way and\nhow can we make sure we don't feel this\nway so you can plan out the failure on\nthe piece of paper you can plan out how\nto not fail on the piece of paper what\nactions I need to take what actions you\nneed to take how I need how we need to\nset up the business and actually have\nstrategic planning around it there was a\nstudy that was done in in 1997 and it\nwas called counterfactual thinking the\nintersection of effect and function and\nthe paper dove into the role of\ncounterfactual thinking so by mentally\nrehearsing how things could go wrong\npeople can develop strategies to avoid\nundesirable outcomes leading to more\nproactive and less anxious approaches\nand so this is really important so if\nyou say oh like I'm going to plan out\nhow my relationship could fail and how I\ncould screw it up and then what I'm\ngoing to do is I'm going to plan how to\nmake sure that I don't do that or I\ndon't take those actions or I don't act\nthat way and then when you start to find\nyourself acting that way you're like oh\nhold on we spoke about this I need to\nmake sure that I don't do this I need to\nmake sure I change this around a little\nbit and so there's a lot of benefit of\nactually seeing this um and then the\nlast thing that that's that's really\nimportant with it as well is it actually\nmakes you feel more of a sense of\ncontrol one of the things that I found\nwith so many people over coaching years\nand years and years is everybody has a\nam I say everybody almost everybody has\na control problem right we want to feel\ncontrol and in our lives we have very\nvery little control you can barely\ncontrol your own self and you want to\ncontrol other people in the world in the\nweather in politics and every single\nthing it's ridiculous and so when you\nactually plan out the worst that could\nhappen it gives you more of a sense\ncontrol because you've seen what could\nhappen you've planned out how to avoid\nit and you've planned out the best that\ncould happen you see both potential\noutcomes both potential futures of the\nbest that could happen the worst that\ncould happen and now you just have to\ntake the right actions towards the one\nthat you want and when you've\nexperienced the pain of what it would\nfeel like to lose your job to lose your\nbusiness to lose your relationship to\nlose your health and you felt it in this\nmoment versus acting like it's not going\nto happen you actually want to avoid\nthat pain in humans we we only do things\nfor one of two reasons number one is is\nto avoid pain and number two is to feel\npleasure and we will try to avoid pain\nway more than we'll try to get towards\npleasure so we're either running away\nfrom pain or we're running towards\npleasure if you've already felt the pain\nthe the feeling of what it would feel\nlike to lose your job to lose your\nbusiness to uh lose your relationship to\nlose your health you felt that pain in\nthe present moment you're going to want\nto avoid that pain in the future same\nway that when you put your hand on you\nonly need to put your hand on a hot\nstove once and then you're going to\nstart avoiding that hot stove you know\nthere's a study another study was done\nin\n1986 and it was called defens of\npessimism harnessing anxiety as\nmotivation and the study found and this\nis where the actual term defensive\npessimism came from researchers actually\nfound that people who deliberately\nthought through the worst case scenarios\nas a way to manage their anxiety those\npeople actually felt more in control and\nmore motivated when they use the\nstrategy of defensive pessimism as uh\nnegative visualization and realizing\nthat they could actually visualize the\nworst that could happen so it's it's\ncrazy that people felt that when they\nthey thought through the worst things\nthat could happen they were able to\nactually feel more in control manage\ntheir anxiety and more motivated when\nthey use the strategy and so I think\nit's it's very important to yes for sure\n100% you need to visualize the best that\ncould happen because that's running\ntowards pleasure right I said there's\nonly two reasons why you do something to\navoid pain and to run towards pleasure\nright so visualize the absolute best\nthat could happen so you could see what\nyou're life could be like so you can get\nyourself excited but visualize the worst\nthat could happen imagine it all going\nup in flames and how you made it all go\nup in Flames so that therefore you can\nbe desensitized to it you can see what\ncould happen you can have strategic\nplanning you can feel more of a sense of\ncontrol as well so that's what
