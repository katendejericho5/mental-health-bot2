    "transcript": "there will never be a perfect time the\nperfect time is always now because your\ncomfort zone is where your dreams go to\ndie you have to jump off the ledge and\nknow that the parachute will open you\ncan't open the parachute before you jump\noff the ledge\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to conquer the little voice inside\nof your head by not negotiating with\nyour mind and i'm going to teach you how\nto smash that little voice inside of\nyour head and why is that important\nbecause everything that you want the\nlife that you truly want is on the other\nside of all of the fears that that\nlittle voice brings up inside of your\nhead\nnow why why do we want to do this\nbecause everything beautiful in your\nlife the perfect version of your life\nthe you that you know that you can be\ndeep down inside lives on the other side\nof that fear lives on the other side of\nthe comfort zone that you are currently\nstuck in and will smith said something\namazing and he said god puts everything\namazing on the other side of fear which\nmeans the only way to get to the perfect\nlife the life that you want for you your\nfamily your spouse your friends the one\nthat you've truly desired and the one\nthat when you get to your deathbed you\nsay yes this is what i wanted\ni'm so proud of this life\nit all is on the other side of fear it's\nall outside of your comfort zone so if\nyou have fears that are holding you back\nfrom the life that you truly want\ni'm gonna tell you this there's only one\nthing in this world that you should fear\nthe only thing that you should fear is\nfear\nyes you heard me right fear\nfear\ndon't fear anything else\nfear fear\nbecause living a life captive inside of\nfear captive inside of your comfort zone\nis not a life fully lived and the only\nthing that scares the crap out of me\nis not what people think about me not\nbeing rejected not hearing no not other\npeople's opinions not failure not\nsuccess none of those things the only\nthing that really scares the crap out of\nme is not living a life fully lived is\ngetting to my deathbed and seeing that i\ncould have done more in wishing that i\ncould have done more to make my life\nbetter everyone else's life so better\nand lives better in the world's life\nbetter if it's possible for me so the\nonly thing that i'm truly afraid of is\nfear\nbecause i know fear\nis one of the worst things in the world\nif every person in this world was able\nto step out of their comfort zone\nand was able to get past their fears\nthink of how amazing this life would be\nhow amazing this world would be if we\nall just got past our fears and created\nthe perfect version of our lives\nbecause we all have that little voice\ninside of us and that little voice\nis either your biggest fan or it's your\nbiggest critic\nand for most of us it's our biggest\ncritic it's the one that says you can't\ndo that you're not smart enough you're\nnot pretty enough you're not enough\nperiod you're not fit enough you're not\nworthy of success you're not worthy of\nlove go back to bed\ndon't work out today sleep in ah you\nshould take a nap in the middle of the\nday don't make those cold calls\nhey you know what you should do sit on\ninstagram for an hour don't get off the\ncouch\nthat's the little voice that's inside of\nyour head and that thing inside of your\nhead is holding you back\nfrom the life you want\nnothing else\nit's not the economy it's not the\npresident it's not your spouse it's not\nyour parents it's not your past it's not\nanybody else around you the only thing\nstanding between you\nand the life that you want\nis fear and that little voice inside of\nyour head that just makes up a bunch of\nbs fear\nand it keeps us in our comfort zone why\nis it because i like to if you've been\nlistening to me for a while you've heard\nme say this before but i like to look at\neverything that's happening to me\npresent day and holding me back and my\nclients back and people who have coached\nback as if it was a million years ago\nand we're talking about cavemen and cave\nwomen and go why is this thing why does\nfear\nwhy does it exist inside of us\nlet's rewind back to a million years ago\nand fear is what kept our species alive\nand i like to think back to cavemen\nright your comfort zone is basically the\nmodern day equivalent of a cave why do\ntribal people go inside of caves because\nthere's only one entrance in one exit\nyou are completely protected around it\nso inside of this cave you're safe\nyou're safe inside of this cave you\ndon't have to worry about death you\ndon't have to worry about attack you\ndon't have to worry about anything\nbecause you're safe inside of this cave\nbut the moment you step out of the cave\nis where you have the possibility of\nattack and the possibility of death\nso now you have to rise over the past 2\nmillion years million years our brains\nhaven't changed that much and there's\nstill a part of our brain that exists\nfrom millions of years ago it's in the\nback your head it's called the amygdala\nand the amygdala creates fear\nso that you can stay safe\nso it creates the fear because your\nbrain only cares about safety and if it\nonly cares about safety it only cares\nabout actually keeping you alive it\ndoesn't care if you're happy doesn't\ncare if you're successful doesn't care\nif you get the life that you truly want\nor you're rich and famous and successful\ndoesn't care about any it doesn't even\ncare if you're happy it cares about your\nsurvival and so the amygdala because of\nthe fact that you don't have\nto worry about being attacked by a lion\nthe amygdala creates fears\nto keep you in your comfort zone aka\nyour cave\nbecause we have the feeling\nof if i step out of my comfort zone\ni might be out of safety\ni might not be as safe\noutside of my comfort zone as i am\ninside of my comfort zone which is the\nsame as i might not be as safe outside\nof the cave as i say as i am inside of\nthe cave and so what do we do we create\na mental cave\na comfort zone to stay in now you know\nthat if you step out of your comfort\nzone\naka step out of your cave because you've\nnever made a hundred thousand dollars\nbefore and you wanna make a hundred\nthousand dollars this year you know\nyou're not gonna die by making a hundred\nthousand dollars\nbut\nthat little fear-based amygdala that\nexists inside of your brain isn't smart\nenough to know that when you do\nsomething that you've never done before\nyou don't have the threat of death\nmake sense and so when you understand\nthe way your brain works you can start\nto make plans to get past it this is why\ni think understanding the brain is so\nfreaking important and most people don't\nlook at it is because when you can\nunderstand the way the brain works then\nyou can work past it and make plans to\nget yourself out of your comfort zone to\nget past your fears to stop worrying so\nthat's why the little voice inside of\nour head exists the little voice inside\nof our head\nexists to keep us inside of our comfort\nzone inside of our cave so that we don't\nhave to worry about death even though\nyou know if you step out of your comfort\nzone and ask someone on a date then\nyou're not gonna die if you step out of\nyour comfort zone and try to make a\nhundred thousand dollars this year\nyou're not going to die but once again\nthat reptilian part of your brain the\nold old old old part of your brain that\nstill exists\ndoesn't know that\nso what do we do now that we know it\nexists we know how it exists we know why\nit exists what do we do we freaking\ndestroy that thing that's what we do\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you now let me tell you\nhow to destroy the little voice inside\nof your head whenever it pops up\nand says\nyou shouldn't do this whatever that\nthing is\nyou have to go at it\nfull force\ni notice it all of the time little voice\npops up inside of my head and says hey\nyou know don't do the dishes right now\nyou can do them later i'm like god\ni got to do the freaking dishes i didn't\nwant to do the damn dishes but now i got\nto do the dishes okay fine i'll do the\ndish a little voice pops up inside of my\nhead and says hey\nyou don't have to work out today\ni'm like\nnow i got to work out\nbecause when that little voice pops up\nthe only way to get rid of it is to go\nthrough it\nso it shows me what i need to work on\nokay\nlooks like i gotta work out today\ni wake up\ngo brush my teeth get myself ready the\nbed's right there the bed's unmade and\nthe little voice inside of my head says\nah you don't have to make the bed today\noh now i got to make the freaking bed\nbecause i've got to do\ni've got to consistently do what that\nlittle voice tells me not to do i've got\nto go through it\nthe only way out is through and so\nwhenever the voice pops up\ni got to do it if it tells me i\nshouldn't work out i've got to work out\nif it tells me i shouldn't make the bed\ni've got to make the bed if i change a\nshirt and i throw a shirt on the bed and\nthat little voice is like oh man hey\nlater on you're going to have to put\nthat on a hanger i'm like oh i can't\nwait till later i've got to do it now\nthe little voice says hey don't make\ncold calls i got to sit down and make 50\nfreaking phone calls why because i\nrefuse to listen to that little voice if\nthe little voice says hey go back to\nsleep i wake up if the little voice says\nhey man you shouldn't take a cold shower\neven though that you should i'm going to\ndestroy the little voice by going\nthrough the little voice the only way\nout is through and when you notice the\nlittle voice you must go against it\nwhatever it tells you to do you must go\nagainst it if it tells you you're not\ngood enough you better find a way to\nthat you are good enough it just tells\nyou you're not smart enough you need to\nstart thinking of ways that you're smart\nif it tells you're not pretty enough you\nneed to go look at yourself in the\nmirror and talk about all the beautiful\nthings that you love about yourself\nwhatever it tells you you have to go at\nthe exact opposite if it tells you\nyou're not fit enough you need to go and\ntell it how you're going to work out\nevery single day and you're going to you\nknow want to do whatever it is that you\nneed to do create the help that you need\nto if it tells you to go back to sleep\nyou've got to wake up you've got to\nfight the little voice inside of your\nhead\nand i'm going to tell you why\nyou don't\nnegotiate with your mind\nbecause your mind once again\nis a safety mechanism it is amazing for\nkeeping you alive\nbut\nit's terrible if you allow it to run\nyour life\nso you've got to literally go through\nwhatever it is the only way to get rid\nof it is to try to defeat it there is no\nother option you can't think your way\nthrough\nall of the little voice and the the\nthings that it says inside of your head\nthat holds you back you can't think your\nway out of it\nthe only way to do it is through action\nif it says hey\nrob just go back to sleep i get it every\nevery freaking morning i get it\nit pops up and says hey man hit the\nalarm\nyou know go back to sleep no big deal\nyou don't have to do anything for the\nnext\n15 minutes sleep in and when that voice\npops up\nall right looks like i've got to wake up\nwhen the little voice says hey man just\ntake a take a warm shower today you\ndeserve it you've taken cold showers for\na long time i'm like you know what i've\ngot to take a cold shower i don't take a\ncold shower because i love cold showers\ni take cold showers because i\nconsistently need to do things that i\ndon't enjoy doing\nto then prove my mind wrong and to take\ncontrol over it\nif it doesn't suck we don't do it\nright so you've got to figure out a way\nto go through it the obstacle that's\nstanding in front of you\nis the way\nthere's a book that was by ryan holiday\ncalled the obstacle is the way basically\nthe synopsis of the entire thing is this\nwhatever it is that's standing in front\nof you is the way to your enlightenment\nis the way to life that you want so if\nthat little voice says rob don't work\nout today then i have to work out\nbecause the perfect version of me is on\nthe other side of that workout\nif it says don't make cold calls today\ni've got to make 50 phone calls\nwhy because it's on the other side it is\nliterally here's a beautiful thing about\nthe little voice inside of your head\neven though it sucks it's showing you\nblatantly right in front of your face\nwhat it is that you need to do in order\nto create the life that you want\nit's obvious once you see it you can't\nunsee it the obstacle is the way you\ncannot listen to it you cannot negotiate\nwith it you have to go through the\nobstacle you have to go through the\nlittle voice the only way out is through\nthrough the obstacle because your\ncomfort zone is where your dreams go to\ndie\nlet me say that again your comfort zone\nis where your dreams go to die you can't\nwait until you're comfortable before you\ntake action because you'll never be\ncomfortable you can't wait until the\nperfect moment before you go out and\ntake action and create the life that you\nwant to because there will never be a\nperfect moment you can't wait till\nyou're ready because you'll never\nactually be ready you have to jump off\nthe ledge and know that the parachute\nwill open\nyou can't open the parachute before you\njump off the ledge\nyou've got to jump\nand that's the only way to do it the\nonly way out is through there will never\nbe a perfect time the perfect time is\nalways now\nbecause every time will be imperfect so\nif you're thinking to yourself oh i've\ngot to wait because i'm not ready yet oh\ni've got to wait because i've got to do\nx y z\nnow is the time it shows you the\nobstacle that's in front of you\nand the obstacle is your mind and the\nonly way is through that obstacle you\nhave to literally seek discomfort\nyou can't be comfortable\nbecause if you stay inside of your\ncomfort zone your life will be exactly\nthe same forever\nand here's the thing\ni know that if you're listening to this\nif you're watching this\nwhatever it is however you're consuming\nthis piece of content\nyou want more you know that you have\nmore potential in you\nso you don't want to stay in your\ncomfort zone you've got to push yourself\noutside of your comfort zone if you\ndon't do anything different your life\nwill not change you will get the exact\nsame life day after day after day after\nday today will look like yesterday yes\nyou know tomorrow will look like today\nit'll be the same day every single day\nlike groundhog day it'll be just be a\ndifferent date and if you fast forward\n10 years you'll be in the exact same\nplace\ni know that some people listening to\nthis right now are in the exact same\nposition that they were 10 years ago\nand the reason why is because they\nhaven't done anything different with\ntheir days every single day\nif you want to change your life you have\nto change your day it's like einstein\nsays do the same thing over and over\nagain and expect different results is\ninsanity your life isn't going to change\nunless you change\nyou have the ability to change your life\nand the crazy thing is you actually have\nthe ability to change your brain\neven if you're an old dog we can teach\nyou new tricks there's something called\nneuroplasticity neuroplasticity means\nyour brain will actually be able to\nchange you can change your brain through\nwork and through repetition you can\ncreate a new version of you\nif you just start today and work at it\nfor the next\nmonth two months three months six months\none year you can be a completely\ndifferent person a completely different\nversion of yourself\nit's called neuroplasticity your brain\nchanges by doing different things if you\ndo the same thing day in day out day in\nday out day in day out your brain\ndoesn't change at all throughout the day\nbut if you do something different every\nsingle day and you push yourself out of\nyour comfort zone every single day your\nbrain your mind your comfort zone will\nexpand i always say the brain is like a\nplastic bag if you pull a plastic bag it\nwill never go back to the same size\nit will always be the new size that you\npulled it to\nit's not like a rubber band where if you\npull a rubber band it goes back to where\nit was your brain's like a plastic bag\nif you pull a plastic bag it will never\ngo back to the same size that it was\nbefore and through neuroplasticity the\nnew things that you do makes new neural\nconnections inside of your brain which\nmeans that there's new thoughts new\npatterns new feelings that come up from\nthat your brain doesn't change though\nunless you do something different do\nsomething different hang out with\ndifferent people\ntake a different way to work stop\ntalking to the same people uh start\ntalking with new people at work start\nreading new books start eating at\ndifferent places eat different types of\nfood don't go home and make the exact\nsame thing and watch the exact same\nshows\nif you don't change your brain will not\nchange if you change your habits all the\nthings you do throughout the day your\nbrain will start to change\nand that's the amazing thing about the\nhuman brain that people don't realize\nthat's if i'm being honest with you\nthat's actually what my entire course is\nabout that's coming out\nis literally how to change your brain\nhow to change it from this is who i am\nand this is my brain so this is who i\nwant to be and this is the brain that\ni'm going to need to have in order to\ncreate that it's called neuroplasticity\nso the only way to actually go through\nand create a new version of yourself is\nto change your habits your traits the\nthings you do throughout the day that\nwill then change your brain because\nyou're changing the things that you're\ndoing you're creating a new version of\nyourself a new brain new neural\nconnections all of that if you change\nyour brain you change your thoughts if\nyou change your thoughts you change your\nfeelings if you change your feelings\nyour feelings will either make you take\naction\nor not take action because if you don't\nfeel good you don't take action if you\nfeel great you take action towards what\nis that you want so your thoughts create\nyour feelings your brain creates your\nthoughts your thoughts create your\nfeeling your feelings create your action\nand your actions will create results and\nresults\nare what change your life if you get\nbetter results your life gets better if\nyou get the same results your life stays\nthe same if you get worse results your\nlife never changes so in order for you\nto create the life that you want to to\ndestroy the little voice that's inside\nof your head you have to go through it\nthe obstacle is the way next time that\nlittle voice pops inside of your head\nyou've got to go through it when it\ntells you not to work out you've got to\nwork out when it says not to make the\nbed you've got to make the bed when it\nsays not to make the phone calls you got\nto make the phone calls when it tells\nyou not to go up and ask that pretty\ngirl out you've got to go up and ask a\npretty girl out you've got to do every\nsingle thing that your brain tells you\nnot to do and you'll be outside of your\ncomfort zone outside of your comfort\nzone outside of your comfort zone\noutside of your comfort zone and then\nyou realize\nlooking back that your comfort zone is\nmassively expanded from where it was and\nwhen your comfort zone expands you\nexpand and your capabilities expand\nyour life expands your results expand\nand you're in a completely different\nsituation\nsix months a year five years ten years\nthan you are right now but it doesn't\nhappen\nunless you take that little voice inside\nof your head and go through it because\nthat little voice is showing you\nwhat it is that you need to work on\nbut you have to pay attention to that\nlittle voice inside of your head\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if
