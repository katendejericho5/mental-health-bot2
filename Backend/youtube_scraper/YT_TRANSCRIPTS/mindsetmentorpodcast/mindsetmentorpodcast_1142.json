    "transcript": "is this not mind-blowing to you like to\nme this is mind-blowing i can actually\nliterally change my brain this isn't\nsome woo-woo ebs this is actual real\nscience called neuroplasticity\n[Music]\nand very quickly i've got an extremely\nexciting announcement today it is open\nto the public you could join in on my\nnew mindset course called rewire your\nbrain where over the course of eight\nweeks you're gonna get two live lessons\nevery single week and we're gonna be\nworking together to actually change and\nrewire your brain because if you can\nchange your brain you could change your\nthoughts if you could change your\nthoughts you could change your actions\nyou could change your actions you could\nchange your results and that means that\nby changing your brain you change\nresults which means you change your\nworld and so if you're out there and\nyou're interested in learning more i've\nmade an entire video explaining the\ncourse to you all you have to do right\nnow is go to coachwithrob.com\nthe first 100 people who join get 100\noff of the course there's already 41\npeople that joined from the waitlist\nbefore so there's currently 59 more\nspots at that 100 off and if you join\ntoday i'm going to be doing a drawing\nfor one person to win a free 45-minute\none-on-one call with me if you join\ntoday which is valued over two thousand\ndollars so once again if you wanna learn\nmore go to coachwithrob.com check it out\nsee if it's right for you and i'm gonna\nwork really hard with you at changing\nyour brain to change your actions to\nchange your results to change your life\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nto rewire your brain we're going to be\ntalking about something called\nneuroplasticity now just so you have an\nidea i'm completely obsessed with the\nbrain and over the past three years i've\nbeen diving really really deep into\nneurology psychology early childhood\ndevelopment and also neuroplasticity\nbecause if i can figure out how those\nwork and i can look at the anthropology\nof a human and then figure out okay a\nhundred thousand years ago this part of\nour brain existed why did it exist\nversus okay there's successful people\nthere's unsuccessful people there's\npeople that take action and don't take\naction how can i marry the two of those\nand understand what makes somebody do\nwhat they're going to do so they can be\nsuccessful or not be successful and\nthat's basically what i've been obsessed\nwith over the past you know i've really\nbeen obsessed with it for the past three\nyears but for the past five years i've\nreally been diving into it and i want\nyou to realize this\nwe've all heard the phrase you can't\nteach an old dog new tricks i am going\nto prove to you today why that is\ncompletely false because you can change\nyour brain you can change yourself at\nany moment in time and we're going to\ntalk deeply about neuroplasticity which\nis the science of changing your brain\nright now on this episode because your\nbrain has over 100 billion neurons 100\nbillion neurons and what is used becomes\nstronger and what is not used becomes\nweaker\nso this is very important to know it's\nthe difference between talent versus\nskill\nyou know if you like sports like i love\nsports and all of the time you see\nsomeone that's like this incredibly\ntalented highly touted incredible\nbasketball player and then they come\ninto the nba they get drafted really\nhigh and they end up being a big dud and\nthe reason why is because they had a lot\nof talent which is kind of like what\nthey were born with or they just had\nsome some extra you know talent that\nthey had\nbut because of the fact that they didn't\nbuild up the skills that they really\nneeded to improve they ended up being a\ndud\non the flip side of that there's people\nthat are in the mba that were not\ndrafted they weren't good but just over\nand over and over again through skill\nand the difference between talent versus\nskills talent what you're given skill is\nwhat you build\nbut through over and over and over again\nat working on themselves and working on\ntheir movements and the connection\nbetween body and brain and\nwiring the neurons in their brain to be\nable to shoot and be able to move a\ncertain way there's people that come out\nof nowhere that weren't supposed to be\ngood and they've developed the skills\nthey've developed the skills and if\nyou're not working on changing yourself\nand changing your brain and changing\nyour actions and changing your thoughts\nevery single day then what you're really\ndoing is you're just leaning back on\nyour your talent\nbut your life can change at any time if\nyou want to become more skilled\nand with neuroplasticity you have to\nrealize your brain is constantly\nchanging if you\nare changing if you wake up and do the\nsame thing every single day every single\nday every single day your brain is not\nchanging in any sort of way so it's like\neinstein says to do the same thing over\nand over again and expect if results is\nabsolutely insanity the reason why it's\nnot going to change is because you\ndidn't change\nnow if you wake up and you say i want to\nget really good at this and you put in\nthe work and you put in the work and you\nput in the work you'll develop skill\nand what happens is your brain changes\nthrough repetition i'm actually going to\ntell you the three ways that your brain\nchanges today and teach that to you\nbut what happens is that your brain\nactually reorganizes itself that's\nwhat's crazy about the human brain is it\nwill actually reorganize itself\nthey say you can't teach an old dog new\ntricks completely false it just takes a\nlittle bit longer if you're an old dog\nso that's what you have to realize your\nbrain's constantly changing if you're\nchanging the question is are you\nchanging it for the positive i'm going\nto show you why in just a minute that\nyou might have accidentally over the\ncourse of your life hardwired yourself\nto be negative you might have\naccidentally over the course of your\nlife hardwired yourself to be lazy\nhardwired yourself to procrastinate\nhardwire yourself to be afraid and not\ntake action\nand that can change at any moment but\nyou have to be willing to step up and\nsay i'm ready to change my life because\nif you're not then nothing's going to\nchange so your brain will reorganize\nitself you can change the way that you\nthink and so i want you to think about\nthis real quick\nright now in this current moment okay\nif you look back at the last 10 or 15\nyears of your life would you say that\nyou're more of a negative person or a\npositive person would you say you're\npositive most of the day or would you\nsay there's an underlying bit of\nnegativity what i mean is like anxiety\nstress\nworry\nis there an underlying just a little bit\nlittle tinge of just negativity worry\nanxiety frustration agitation that's\njust bubbling under the surface a little\nbit it might not be an explosion\nbut what do you think\nover your last five years let's just say\nfive years would you say you're more\npositive or did you say you're more\nnegative\nbecause you have hardwired yourself to\nbe that way\nnow once again\nyou can change everything that you do\nand hardwire yourself to be a new person\nyou can hardwire yourself to be\ndifferent i would be if i'm completely\nhonest with you before i really started\ngetting into personal development i was\na very negative person i always blamed\neverybody else i always had excuses as\nto why i wasn't where i wanted to be and\nwhy i wasn't successful and why i didn't\nmake any money i was really great at\nblaming other people when i discovered\npersonal development oh my god i can\nchange myself and change my life\nand so you have to realize if your brain\nis constantly changing all the time you\ncan change the way that you think\nyou can change the way that you feel on\na daily basis if you don't feel good you\ncan change that\nwhy because your feelings come from your\nthoughts\nyou can change the way that you feel you\ncan change the way that you act\nif you think about it if you\nprocrastinate or if you don't take\naction or if you feel fear and you be\nbit paralyzed and you don't do anything\nyou can change that you could change\nwhat you think you could change the way\nyou feel you could change what you act\nall of them can be changed at any moment\nin time based off the work that you put\ninto yourself and the work that you put\ninto your brain the six inches that's in\nbetween your two ears and you got to\nthink of your brain as this\nyour brain has is like a giant forest\nokay your brain's like a giant forest in\nthere's well-worn paths in the forest\nyou know if you walk down a path over\nand over and over and over again it's\ngoing to become a well-worn path which\nmeans that it's easier to walk through\nthe well-worn path than it is to go and\ncreate a brand new path right\nso you realize if you do something over\nand over and over and over again like\nbeing negative or being pessimistic or\nhaving anxiety or having worry or having\nfrustration or having agitation if you\ndo it over and over and over and over\nagain you're actually hardwiring\nyourself and i'm not going to talk about\nthis deeply today but actually becoming\nchemically addicted to those feelings\nand you are chemically addicted to your\nnegative thoughts inside of your body of\nanxiety and worry and frustration\nit's like a well-worn path if you've\ngone down it over and over and over and\nover and over again then it's just\nreally easy for your brain to just go\ndown that path now why does your brain\nwant to go down that path because the\nmost energy consuming organ in your\nentire body is your brain there is no\nother organ in your body that consumes\nmore energy and that's why harvard did a\nstudy and found out that 48\nof what a human does is actually\nautopilot\nwhich means that 48 of what you do is\nyou just going through the motions have\nyou ever driven home from work and you\nget home and you're like how in the hell\ndid i just get home and you don't even\nremember it's just like you kind of\nclicked off\nand the reason why is because your brain\nwants to hardwire things into your body\nand into your brain so that it doesn't\nhave to think because if you think a lot\nit consumes a lot of energy\nbut the problem is have you hardwired\nthe things that you don't want into your\nbrain\nbecause what you need to do is you need\nto unwire those and start to hardwire\nthe things that you do want like feeling\nfear and taking action anyways you know\nfeeling like oh my gosh i don't know\nwhat i should do but stepping into the\nunknown and going for it there's ways to\nhardwire yourself around that so the\nbrain consumes a ton of energy\nwhat's crazy is we're not very\nself-aware of all of the things we do on\nautopilot you know somebody can say\nsomething and boom it immediately we\nbecome it's called a reflexive thought\nor reflexive movement\nwe immediately just react and get pissed\noff or agitated or feel a certain way\nright it's reflexive it's we don't even\nhave to think about just autopilot so\nthat's how your brain you know just\ngoing into it how your brain kind of\nworks a little bit now let's talk about\nthe three different ways to change your\nbrain right now\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you the first way is\nthis is chemical at its most basic\nbasic function your brain functions by\ntransferring chemical signals between\nbrain cells which are called neurons\nthat trigger a series of actions or\nreactions that's it so your brain has\nyou know functions that happen inside of\nit and the functions are just chemical\nsignals going from one place to another\nat its simplest form that's the way that\nyou should know it so the thing about\nthough is that your brain can increase\nthe amount of concentration of chemical\nsignaling or the amount of chemicals\nthat go between neurons\nand what you know the the actual amount\nof chemicals that go from one place to\nanother in one place to another one\nplace to another\nthe easiest way to think of it is this\nneurons that fire together wire together\nif you just continue to think the same\nthoughts over and over and over and over\nagain you're actually\nwiring that into your brain like it's\nclicking it into place and you're wiring\nit into into your brain neurons that\nfire together wire together once again\nyour brain can increase the amount or\nthe concentration of signaling that\ntakes place between your neurons so\nyou've got to be very clear\nas to what you want to take happen that\nhave happened versus just allowing it to\nhappen now chemical is basically\nimproved what it does is it improves\nyour short-term memory and improves your\nshort-term memory now\nyou have to realize this i don't know if\nyou've ever done this before if you've\never sat down and tried to\nyou know learn an instrument or learn a\nsport and you take a few hours and you\nstart learning and you see massive\namounts of improvement in a really short\nperiod of time what happens is that your\nbrain goes new thing new thing new thing\nwe need more chemicals to start to pay\nattention to this new thing because it's\na challenge for us and so you can\nimprove and improve and improve and\nafter two hours like man you're not\nincredible you're not like the best\nguitar player ever the best basketball\nplayer ever after those two hours but\nyou can see improvement because your\nbrain has sent\nmore chemicals to the neurons in your\nbrain to start to get better and improve\nat that thing\nbut what happens though you ever do this\nand you wake up tomorrow and you try to\nplay that that scale that you played on\nthe guitar or scale that you played on\nthe piano or shoot those shots and it\nfeels like you never even you're like\nwhy why is my i felt like there was so\nmuch improvement yesterday there's\nalmost no improvement right now\nwhy is that because you only changed the\nchemical structure of your brain for a\nshort amount of time you didn't change\nyour brain you change the chemical\nstructure of your brain for just those\nmoments which means it's good for short\nterm now if you do something over and\nover and over and over again and you\ncontinue to keep learning and learning\nand learning and keep sending chemicals\nand chemicals and chemicals through\nthoughts what happens is your brain\nstarts to change in the second way which\nis the actual structure of your brain\nyou change the structure of your brain\nbecause the neurons that fire together\nwire together and during the learning\nprocess you can actually change the\nconnections between different neurons in\nyour brain so you can create brand new\nconnections\nthat were never even there a few minutes\nago or a few days ago by doing it over\nand over and over again so that's this\nis where the actual physical structure\nof the brain changes and that takes more\ntime it doesn't just happen in one day\nit's more of a\nlong-term play and it's for something\nlike developing a motor skill it starts\nto get better and better and better the\nmore that you put into it the thing that\nyou have to really realize about the\nbrain is that the brain changes\nthrough\nrepetition doing it over and over and\nover and over again so chemical is the\nfirst way to change and that's short\nterm\nthe more long-term way if you do it over\nand over and over again continue to send\nthose thoughts and those thoughts and\nmovements and movements and movements\nand chemicals and chemicals and\nchemicals what happens is this change\nstarts to change the structure of your\nbrain and an example would be this the\ncool thing about is a couple examples\ni'll give you people who are blind and\nread braille have larger hand sensory\nareas in their brain they weren't born\nwith larger hand sensory areas in their\nbrain what happens is because of the\nfact they use their hands so much and\nthe senses matter so much more than for\ninstance me somebody who doesn't rebrail\nthe brain actually the hand sensory area\nactually grows in their brain\nthat's what's crazy\nnow your brain doesn't grow in size what\nhappens is a part of the brain will grow\nwhich means a part of the brain will\nshrink so you're actually hardwiring and\nsomething in there in kind of rewiring\nor you know making the actual neurons\nsmaller in another part of your brain\nanother example is this i'm right-handed\nso your dominant hand motor region is\nlarger and the part of your brain if\nyou're right-handed it's that part of\nyour brain if you're left-handed it's\nthat part of your brain so depending on\nif you're right-handed or left-handed\nyour dominant hand motor region is\nlarger depending on what hand you use to\nwrite\npretty crazy right another example\nis lundy london taxi cab drivers are not\nable to use maps they actually have to\nmemorize every single street before they\ncan start driving taxi cabs and they\nhave to memorize the entire thing of map\nof london and they have done studies on\nthe brains of them and they weren't born\nthis way but because of fact they have\nto sit there and memorize it they have\nlarger larger spatial regions in their\nbrain that are used for mapping\nso literally by sitting there and\nlearning and learning and learning it\nover and over and over the chemicals go\nand the chemicals go and the chemicals\ngo and the chemicals grow\nwhat happens is the brain the structure\nof the brain actually changes once again\nyour brain does not get larger your\nbrain does not get smaller it's just the\nregion that you concentrate the most on\nwill grow\nor shrink and that will strength it will\nit will you know strengthen\nthe actual connections between different\nparts of your brain\nis this not mind-blowing to you like to\nme this is mind-blowing i can actually\nliterally change my brain this isn't\nsome woo-woo ebs this is actual real\nscience called neuroplasticity so\nyou have to realize that is that you can\nchange your brain at any moment in time\nso if you're sitting there and i'm going\nto tell you the third one in just a\nminute the third way to change your\nbrain but if you're sitting there and\nyou're like i don't like my you know how\nmy life is right now i want to change it\nyou can and you can change it through\nchanging your brain which changes\neverything and the external maybe you\nlove your life but you're like you know\nwhat i feel like i have so much more\npotential inside of me guess what\nthrough working at it and working it and\nworking it that's how you bring it out\nthat's the beautiful thing\nso the first way to change the brain is\nchemical the second way to change your\nbrain is structure and the third way to\nchange your brain if you've changed it\nchemically and you've done it so much\nyou've changed it structurally the third\nway is you actually change the function\nof your brain you will actually change\nthe way that your brain functions\nbecause as you use a brain region more\nthan another brain region it becomes\neasier to be more excitable and so what\nhappens is\nwithout going too deep into it is\nthere's stuff called myelin that's built\non the outside of a brain and the\neasiest way to think of it is if you go\nup to a cord that's inside of a wall\nright you know cord's plugged into a\nwall on the outside of it you're\nactually there's something there's just\nrubber that's what it is and on the\ninside of it is usually a copper wire\nthe copper wire is actually where the\nsignal the electrical signals are sent\nthrough\nwhy do you have the rubber on the\noutside because it actually allows the\nchemical signal actually allows the the\ncopper signal the electrical signal to\ntransfer\nwith less energy\nand move faster the same way that if you\nthink of the actual brain itself as you\nhave the neuron\nand then on the outside of the neuron\nyou have something called myelin that\nbuilds the more that you do something\nover and over and over again the more\nmyelin that builds so that your brain\ncan actually send an electrical signal\nfrom one place to another even easier\nand so the same way that you look at the\ncord that's plugged in there's a copper\nwire on the outside the copper wire is\nmyelin if you look at the brain the more\nthat you do something the more myelin\nthat will build up and myelin is the\nequivalent of the the rubber cord on the\noutside of it so there's a neuron on the\ninside wrapped with something called\nmyelin and that's the exact same as a\ncord so the more you do something over\nand over and over again\nthe easier it becomes to do because\nmyelin will build up which makes it more\nenergy efficient to send a chemical\nsignal from one place to another so\nactually changes the structure of your\nbrain\nmind-blowing isn't you could change the\nstructure of your brain but here's the\nthing\nuh when learning you have to realize\nthis there's no drug that you can take\nfor neuroplasticity\nthere's none\nthe only way that you could change it is\nthat you there's nothing more effective\nthan practice\ndoing it over doing it over doing it\nover you have to put in the work\nyour life will not change your brain\nwill not change unless you step up to\nthe plate and actually change yourself\nthere's no drug you could take for\nneuroplasticity there's no secret sauce\nthere's no shortcuts it's the work you\nhave to put in the work because you have\nto change the chemical structure you\nhave to change a chemical i can't use\nthe word structure because i'm about to\nuse the structure you have to change the\ni'll just say you have to change the\nchemical structure of your brain then\nyou'll have to change the actual\nstructure of your brain then you'll have\nto change the actual function of your\nbrain and that's why if you see someone\nlike god they're positive all the time\nit's because they've been positive and\nthey've actually hardwired positivity\ninto their brain\nor you're like man that person just\ntakes action and they never second guess\nthemselves it's because they've\nhardwired that taking action and not\nsecond-guessing themselves\nand it's available to anybody that's the\nbeautiful thing about it though so\nhere's the thing though\nsome of you have accidentally hardwired\nyourself for what you don't want\nfor negativity for worry for\nself-destruction for holding yourself\nback for not taking action for\nprocrastination because you've done it\nso many times over and over and over\nagain and you didn't even know it but\nyou were actually hardwiring the habits\nthe traits the qualities the thinking\nthe feelings that you don't want\nnow that can change is what's the\nbeautiful thing you're not gonna be\nstuck there forever\nbut you have to make a change that's the\nthing that you have to realize about it\nyou have to literally unlearn\nthe things that you've learned to change\nyour brain and you have to relearn other\nparts of your things that you want to\nrelearn so if you've\nlet's just take it for example if you've\nbeen really negative your entire life or\njust had underlying anxiety or\nunderlying stress it's going to be there\nforever unless you make a change but the\nmore that you actually start to change\ntowards the other side of positivity of\nbeing grateful of whatever it is\nyou start to actually make the signals\nweaker for negativity or stress or worry\nor anxiety and make the signal stronger\nwith more myelin on the outside\nfor positivity for love for action for\nhappiness for joy for peace for whatever\nit is that you actually truly want now\nhere's the other crazy thing there's a\npart of your brain called the\nhippocampus the hippocampus is very\nimportant for turning uh you know an\nactual doing something into a memory and\nthe hippocampus is extremely extremely\nactive when you sleep\nwhich is why they say that fifty percent\nof neuroplasticity happens at the event\nof doing it and fifty percent actually\nhappens when you sleep so when you are\nactually doing the thing itself whatever\nit is that you're doing over and over\nand over again you are doing what they\ncall triggering you're triggering the\nchange in your brain but it's not\nactually changing your brain you're\ntriggering the change in your brain only\nthrough deep sleep or deep rest\ndoes your brain actually change and the\nreason why is because your hippocampus\nwill replay it over and over and over\nand over again in your sleep to allow\nyou to be able to change it\nso\ni don't have enough time to really dive\ninto that i talk way way way way deeper\nin that in my course of how to change\nyour brain through sleep and actions to\ntake before you go to bed to make sure\nthat you hardwire it deeper into your\nbrain but just know this as much as it's\nimportant to do the things it's also\nreally really important to have deep\nrest so that your brain can recover and\ngrow in those moments just like when you\nwork out the most important part is\nworking out your diet and all that but\nyou've got to get the sleep because your\nbody has to recover because that's when\nit actually grows\nso understand this this is why it's so\nimportant\nyour brain\nmakes your thoughts your thoughts create\nyour actions your actions change your\nresults and your results create your\nworld create your happiness your joy\nyour peace your success your bank\naccount your relationships all of that\nstuff\nso the way to change your brain i'm\nsorry the word way to change your world\nis to change your brain\nso what are the two things that matter\nwhat's number one\nthe thing that's crazy about this is it\nshows you that who you are now\ndoesn't have to be who you will always\nbe\nyou can change yourself but you have to\nchange the only way to change yourself\nis for you to change\nright you can change at any moment and\nthe second thing is you can literally\ncreate yourself into anything that you\nwant to be\nthat's mind-blowing you can create\nyourself into anything that you want to\nbe\nso realize\ndo it over and over and over again so\nyou can change the chemical structure of\nyour brain you can change the actual\nstructure of your brain and you can\nchange the function of your brain hey\nthanks so much for watching this video\nif you want to learn even more about\nmastering your mind click right here and\nwatch this video as well if you believe\nthat the world is going to\nyou will see all of the ways that the\nworld is going to"
