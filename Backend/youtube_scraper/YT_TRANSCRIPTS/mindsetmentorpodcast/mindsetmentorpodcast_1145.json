    "transcript": "action\nleads to results results\nleads to confidence and confidence\nis what destroys limiting beliefs\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\ndestroy your limiting beliefs and this\none's gonna be super important because i\nwas having a conversation with somebody\nwho is in uh my upper level course which\nis called business breakthrough uh where\ni work with business owners and coaches\non how to build businesses and one of\nthe things that was said to me yesterday\nwas i need to think about my limiting\nbeliefs and work through them mentally\nbefore i take action that was the the\nphrase something along that line that\nsomeone said to me\nand i heard it and i was like that\nis a perfect episode and so i just\ncovered it today inside of my business\nbreakthrough group with everyone on a\nzoom call but i wanted to cover it with\nyou today because i think it would help\neverybody that's out there because i\nwant you to realize this\nthinking about your limiting beliefs\nwill never ever conquer your limiting\nbeliefs\nlet me say that again thinking about\nyour limiting beliefs will never ever\nconquer your limiting beliefs because\nlimiting beliefs are caused by your\nthoughts and we all know you consciously\nknow right now that the limiting beliefs\nthat are holding you back from the life\nthat you truly want most of the time\naren't even true\nand so if you're sitting out there and\nyou're holding yourself back because of\nlimiting beliefs thinking about those\nlimiting beliefs is the last thing that\nyou need to do because here's what's\ngonna happen\nyou're gonna sit there and you're gonna\nsay okay i need to think about where\nthese limiting beliefs came from okay\nyou know this living belief of i'm not\ngood enough where did it come from it\ncame from my mom okay well\nnow i feel bad because i'm thinking\nabout the fact that my mom is a great\nperson but i have limiting beliefs\nbecause of her but i'm still kind of\npissed off because the fact that i got\nthese limiting beliefs from her and i\ndon't deserve these so now i'm thinking\nabout where it came from i feel bad\nabout it now i'm starting to get pissed\noff\nand thinking about where it came from\ndoesn't really matter what matters is\ngetting past those limiting beliefs not\nfiguring out where they came from now is\nit important to know where they came\nfrom yes but to sit there and think\nabout where they came from is not going\nto move you into the future that you\nwant because now i'm sitting there and\ni'm thinking about xyz and i'm thinking\nabout how i got let me believe for my\nmom and for my dad and from people who\nused to bully me and from teachers who\ntalked down to me and i'm thinking about\nall these things and the limiting\nbeliefs that i have and now i feel bad\nand now not only do i feel bad now i'm\ngetting mad at myself for feeling bad\nbecause i shouldn't feel bad about\nsomething that happened in the past\ncan you relate to this a bunch of people\nout there are not in your heads right\nwe're like oh my god exactly i start\nthinking something then i feel a certain\nway and then i judge myself for feeling\nthe way that i feel because i don't\nultimately want to feel that way and now\nmy limiting beliefs are not only holding\nme back from the life that i want but\nthey're actually keeping me paralyzed in\nthis moment because i'm thinking too\nmuch about my limiting beliefs\nand what's that going to do for me\nabsolutely\nnothing\nthinking about your limitless is not\ngoing to do anything\nso i'm sitting there i'm not taking\naction i feel bad and now i'm judging\nmyself for feeling bad\nhave you ever been in this situation\ni'm sure you have right so\nnot thinking about my living beliefs has\nsent me down this\nnegative spiral crapshoot\nof thinking about my life and now i'm\nsitting on the couch i'm pissed off i\nfeel bad and i definitely don't feel\nlike taking action so now\nand we have to rise we started off by\nnot taking action because i was thinking\nabout because of my limiting beliefs\nperiod but now after thinking about all\nmy limiting beliefs i'm basically\nparalyzed on the couch\nso by thinking about my limiting beliefs\nhas it gotten me anywhere no has it\ngotten me to take any action no it's\nactually sent me backwards because now i\nfeel like crap\nwhen at least i didn't feel like crap\nwhen this started\nso what do we do\nwe have to conquer the limiting beliefs\nand you can't conquer limiting beliefs\nby thinking about them the only way that\nyou can conquer those limiting beliefs\nbecause ultimately what's the only thing\nthat matters the limiting belief doesn't\nmatter where it came from doesn't matter\nthe only thing that matters is getting\npast\nthat limiting belief so now you're\nsitting out there you're like okay well\nhow do i get past the living belief how\ndo i conquer these living beliefs\nthere's one way in one way only to get\npast your living belief and that is this\ntaking action\nand you may have heard me say this\nbefore but the beautiful thing about\nbelieving in yourself or not believing\nin yourself is that you don't have to\nbelieve in yourself in order to take\naction\nyou don't you don't have to believe in\nyourself in order to take action\nthinking\ncauses more thinking\ninaction causes more inaction so let me\ngive you an example the thinking causes\nmore more thinking we covered that just\na second ago inaction causes more\ninaction so if you're sitting on the\ncouch and you say you know what i have\nthis business i started this business\nand i really want to you know make my\nbusiness so much better and you're\nsitting on the couch\nand you're not doing anything\nnot doing something in that inaction\nwill breed more in action\nso thinking causes more thinking\ninaction causes more inaction here's the\nsecret though action\ncauses more action\nwhat do i mean by that well\ni'll give you a perfect example today i\ndidn't want to work out didn't want to\nand i'll be honest with you i don't want\nto work out any day i've never i don't\nknow if i've ever wanted to work out in\nmy entire life\nright but what do i do\ni say you know what screw it i'm going\nto force myself to do it anyways so i\ndidn't feel like taking action\ngoing and working out and then by the\nend of the workout i had finished and i\nran out of time because i had to come\nback and run a meeting i thought to\nmyself man i wish i had just a little\nbit more time to work out because i feel\nso good right now you ever feel that way\nyou don't want to work out you work out\nand then at the end of the workout\nyou're like you know what i could\nprobably go for another set i could\nprobably go for another five minutes i\ncould probably go for an extra run i'm\nin it i feel it i'm moving i want to\nkeep this moving my heart rate's up my\nbody's feeling good i want to continue\nto push myself\nwhy\nbecause the action of pushing yourself\nto do it causes more action to continue\nto want to do it it's like a you know\nwhat i always say is it's like taking a\nbowling ball at the top of a\nreally high you know you take and you\nput on the top of a really high mountain\nand you let it go\nit's going to take a second to go but if\nyou go down 100 yards 200 yards that\nmountain that bowling ball is flying\nso the hardest part is getting the\nbowling ball moving but once it's moving\nand it's going downhill it's freaking\ngoing downhill and it's hauling some\ntail all the way downhill it's the same\nthing for your action\nwhen you're sitting on the couch and\nyou're doing nothing you have to have\nthat self-awareness to go\ni'm not taking action right now okay\nwhat do i need to do i need to take some\naction what do i need to do i don't feel\nlike doing anything if i'm being honest\nwith you but what am i going to do i'm\ngoing to do\n30 push-ups\ni'm going to force myself to move i'm\ngoing to go for a run i'm going to do\nsomething that gets my body moving and\nputs it into action because i know if i\nstart to move i'm going to want to\ncontinue to move\nnow if i'm sitting on the couch and i'm\nthinking about wanting to take action\nthat's not going to make me take action\nonly getting up and actually taking\naction will breed more action\nso\nthe only way to conquer your limiting\nbeliefs going back to living beliefs now\nis you have to get up and take action\nbecause here's what happens here's the\nsecret sauce you ready\naction\nleads to results\nresults leads to confidence\nand confidence\nis what destroys limiting beliefs\nthere's the secret\nyou can't break your limiting beliefs by\nthinking about them the only way that\nyou can break your limiting beliefs is\nto build your confidence by getting\nresults\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nso an example that i gave to my coaching\nclients today they're all coaches\nbuilding coaching businesses the example\nthat i gave them is this if you're\nsitting around thinking about\nis somebody gonna buy from me are they\ngonna use my services are my services\nworth it am i worth charging a thousand\nfifteen hundred two thousand 000 a month\nthat is not going to get any money in\nyour bank account what is going to get\nmoney in your bank account getting up\nusing the exact strategy that i give you\ntaking action getting on the phone with\nsome people some people saying yes some\npeople saying no and you might have a\nfew people say no and no and no but if\nyou keep fighting through and you keep\npushing yourself eventually somebody\nwill say yes so let's say your price\nthat you want to charge is 1500 a month\nright and someone says no someone says\nno someone says no and then finally\nsomeone says yes that person saying yes\nto you will then conquer those limiting\nbeliefs\nof am i worth 1500 bucks so basically\nwhat's crazy about it's like a catch-22\nin order to fully believe in yourself\nand fully believe that you're worth it\nyou actually sometimes have to have\nsomebody buy from you at that price and\nthey\nprove to you that you're worth it\nyou see what i'm picking up what i'm\nputting down the result of the buy\nfrom that person makes you go oh my god\nmaybe i am actually worth more than i\nthought i was worth\nand then you get excited about you're\nlike i want to get on the phone i want\nto sell to somebody else\nand this is just used as in a sales\nsales example but how many examples are\nthere in your life where you only built\nconfidence in whatever it is that you\ndid\nby going out and getting results\nright if you're a gymnast you're not\ngonna get confidence in being a gymnast\nby just sitting around thinking about\ndoing the twirl and landing it no you're\ngonna get confidence by attempting the\ntwirl and falling and attempting the\ntroll and following attempting to pull\nand falling and getting better each and\nevery time and figuring out what you're\ndoing wrong and eventually you do the\ntwirl\nyou stick the landing and what happens\nyou put your arms up in the air and\nyou're like oh my god i just stuck the\nlanding and what happens\nthat little voice inside of your head\ngets a little bit quieter each time\nyou're just turning it down a little bit\nturning it down a little bit\nconfidence is what destroys limiting\nbeliefs and confidence comes from\nresults\nresults only come from taking action\nand so here's the thing that i said a\nfew minutes ago the beautiful thing\nabout taking action is you don't have to\nbelieve in yourself to take action you\ndon't have to believe in yourself to\nreach out to clients you don't have to\nbelieve in yourself to go out there and\ntwirl like a gymnast and eventually land\nit you don't have to believe in yourself\nwhen you shoot a basket that you're\ngoing to make it but eventually you will\nmake it and when you make that first\nshot you get a little bit of confidence\nand your living beliefs get a little bit\nless and you make another shot and you\nget a little bit more confidence and\nyour limiting beliefs go down and you\nmake more and more and more and more and\nmore shots\nand you have a lot more confidence\ni guarantee you this lebron james was\nnot as confident in his jump shot when\nhe was 9 years old as he is now at 35\nyears old\nwhy because he's made so many jump shots\nthere's so many proof of results in his\npast that he's like yeah i've got\nconfidence in this now will i miss it of\ncourse i missed some of them but i'm\ngoing to make some of them but the thing\nis this you'll miss 100 of shots you\ndon't take so if you're sitting around\nthinking\ntoo much\nabout all of the things that are holding\nyou back in all of living beliefs\nand where they came from and your mom\ndid this and your dad did this and your\nteachers did this and your sister used\nto say this to you when you were younger\nand your brother used to beat you up and\nyou've been bullied in school that's not\ngoing to do anything for you you don't\nhave to believe in yourself in order to\ntake action but you do have to take\naction to get the results and you do\nhave to get the results to build the\nconfidence and you do have to have\nconfidence to destroy your limiting\nbeliefs\nlimiting beliefs are only destroyed\nthrough you taking action but you have\nto be very self-aware of when you're not\nbeing\nactive when you're inactive when you're\nthinking too much when you're stuck in\nthat negative crap shoot of you know\nthat negative tornado\nof\nall of these things happened to me and\nnow i'm not worth it now i don't feel\ngood and now because the fact that i\ndon't feel good and i got myself into\nthe situation now i'm judging myself for\nfeeling this way oh my gosh it's just\ntoo much and too much and too much\nand we dig our own graves\nwe do\nand eventually you have to just wake up\none day and become self-aware and\nlook at it and go hold on what what am i\ndoing what is this thinking doing for me\nit's doing nothing i can't think about\nmy limiting beliefs and feel better\nabout them because if i think about my\nlimiting beliefs i'm gonna feel worse\nabout them\nnow here's the thing that i told\neverybody on the zoom call today as well\nis this\nand this is super important for you to\nrealize\nthere's a pretty good chance\nthat your limiting beliefs will never go\naway\nbecause some people are like god i just\nwish they would go away one day they\nwill finally go away\ni've been working myself for 14 years i\nstill have my limiting beliefs\nhere's the difference though when they\npop up i just don't listen to them like\ni used to\nso they'll still be there\nbut the difference is you stop listening\nto them you stop caring doesn't really\nmatter maybe when you first started on\nthis this journey of personal\ndevelopment maybe your limiting beliefs\nwere like a nine\nmaybe mine were at a nine\nand every year that i worked harder\nmyself and i got more results and i\nworked hard on myself and i got more\nresults and more results and more\nresults went from a nine to an eight to\na seven to a six and now maybe there are\nthree or four they still pop up every\nday all the time but now i'm just like\noh\nthere it is there's that limiting belief\nit's just like the example that i gave\nthem is just like your your drunk aunt\nat the party right when you were a kid\nthe drunk aunt you didn't know that she\nwas drunk but she was really mean she\nsaid a bunch of things and because of\nfact that you didn't know that she was\ndrunk and she wasn't normally like that\nyou could have taken all those things to\nheart now when you're in your 20s 30s\n40s 50s and you know nancy gets drunk\nagain\nyou're like up there's nancy getting\ndrunk that's what she does but when she\ncomes up and says something to you you\ndon't take it to heart anymore because\nyou're like oh that's drunk nancy that's\nwhat she's doing right we all have the\ncrazy person in our family right you're\nlike oh there's drunk dancing that's\nwhat she does but you don't take what\nshe says to heart same thing with those\nliving beliefs up\nthere's my drunk limiting beliefs\npopping in again but i'm not going to\ncare about them because i'm not going to\nlisten to them because it honestly\ndoesn't matter\ni don't have to believe in myself in\norder to take action hey thanks so much\nfor watching this video if you want to\nlearn even more about mastering your\nmind click right here and watch this\nvideo as well the question is\ndo you truly truly love yourself if you\ndon't\nthat's the reason why you're not taking\nthe action that you need to"
