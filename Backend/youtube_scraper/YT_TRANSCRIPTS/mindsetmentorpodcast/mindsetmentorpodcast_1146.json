the negative stuff that you say\nto yourself\nyou're fat\nyou're ugly\nyou're stupid\nyou'll never amount to anything\nyou're worthless\nyou're unlovable\nno wonder why you're single no wonder\nwhy you keep getting cheated on\nuh you know\nthose love handles are disgusting right\nwe're gonna don't worry we're not gonna\nbe negative this whole time we're gonna\nturn it all around but i wanna make sure\nthat we go through this and do this\nright you know stuff like you'll be\nalone forever nobody wants to be with\nyou\nyou don't have any friends your friends\ndon't love you nobody has your back what\nare the things that you're saying to\nyourself write them down be open honest\nand vulnerable if you need to burn this\npiece of paper by the time we get done\ntoday completely cool no big deal but i\nwant you to write down all of the\nnegative things that you say to yourself\nright now\nnow what i want you to do is after\nyou've done that i want you to\nwrite down\nthe absolute worst thing that you've\never said to yourself take yourself back\nto the moment where you might have just\nbeen so hard on yourself and yelling at\nyourself in your head maybe you're\nyelling to yourself out loud what was it\nthat you were saying to yourself i want\nyou to write that down or think of that\nmoment right now\nwhat was the absolute worst thing that\nyou've ever said to yourself in your\nentire life write it down\nokay\nnow here's what i want you to do i want\nyou to take that sheet of paper\nokay take that sheet of paper look at it\nreal quick\nand what i want you to do is i want you\nto find your youngest child\ni want you to find your youngest sibling\nyour youngest cousin someone that you\nlove\nface time your mom whatever it is that\nyou need to do\nbut the younger they are the better\nbecause the more innocent they are\nand i want you to walk over to them\nand i want you to say the things on that\nsheet of paper to them\ngo ahead do it\ni'll be here waiting for you\ngo ahead tell that child\nthat they're fat that they're ugly that\nthey're stupid that they'll never amount\nto anything that they're worthless that\nyou know they're completely unlovable\nnobody would ever want to be with them\nyou'll be alone forever go ahead try it\nno\nwhy not\noh\nokay it's okay to say to yourself\nbut it's not okay to say to somebody\nelse is that what you're saying to me is\nthat what you're thinking in your head\nbecause i'm reading your mind telepathy\ntelepathically i guess\nso you're telling me you can say all of\nthese terrible things to yourself but\nyou can't say them to someone else\nso why\nwhy\nwhy\ndo you say them to yourself what good is\nit doing to say all of these negative\nthings to yourself to talk down to\nyourself\nwhat good is it doing what what positive\nhas ever come from speaking to yourself\nthat way\nyou would never talk to someone that you\nlove\nthe way that you talk to yourself\nand\nto be honest with you probably never\neven talk to your enemies the way that\nyou talk to yourself you're nicer to\nyour enemies than you are to yourself\nthink about that one for a second\nlet that one sink into your subconscious\ni'll give you a pretty good example\nthink about this for a second think\nabout\nlet's say one of your friend calls you\nand let's say she's a female she just\nwent on her first date it was a blind\ndate right maybe let's say it's a\na tinder date not a blind date she goes\nout on a tinder date\nand uh the guy leaves she's super into\nhim she's like man he's cute he's got a\ngreat job he's nice he's got a great\nbody he's sexy whatever she's into him\nright\nand she's like well at the end of the\nday she's like i'd really love to see\nyou again and he's like actually\ni'll be honest with you you're just not\nreally my type so i don't think that's\ngoing to happen\nand she's distraught\nshe's not happy about it she feels down\nupon herself and she calls you a bring\nbring hello you answer the phone she\ntells you the whole situation\noh he was so cute he was great i don't\nknow what happened we were getting along\nso well i was thinking about how great\nit would be to start dating him to go on\na second date whatever it is she tells\nyou all about him and then he said that\nhe's not interested in me would you ever\ngo\noh let's say her name's michelle oh yeah\nof course michelle it's because you're\nfat it's because you're ugly\nit's because that mole in your face it's\nbecause you're really not that smart\nit's because the fact that you'll\nprobably be alone forever you're\nunlovable i don't know why anybody would\ndate you in the first place it makes\nsense that people have cheated on you in\nthe past\nwould you just go in on her like that\nno nobody would if you did you're a\nterrible friend but i would assume that\nanyone listen this would not do that\nso\nwhy would you do it to yourself\nbecause at that point in time your\nfriend michelle what does she need from\nyou she needs love\nshe needs support she needs you to be\nthere for her\nhow many times\nhave you not been there for yourself\nhow many times have you not shown up\nas the best friend to yourself\nbecause if anything\nmore than anybody else you should be\nyour number one fan you should be your\nbiggest supporter you should be your\nbest friend you should be the one that\nis there that always has your back you\ncan always have the friends and the\nfamily members and all those people have\nyour back but you should be your biggest\nfan\nso if you would never talk to your\nfriend michelle when she calls you after\nher terrible tinder date and she's so\ndistraught you never speak to her like\nthat why would you speak to yourself\nthat way\nafter you have somebody who doesn't want\nto see you again somebody who breaks up\nwith you something that happens why\nwould you speak to yourself that way\nit does nothing for you it does nothing\nfor the world\nbecause the better that you are\nthe better the world is\nso you're actually\nbeing extremely selfish by being so\nnegative yourself because not only are\nyou not getting the amazingness out of\nyourself that you could get the world is\nnot getting the best version of you as\nwell\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so

throw it away\nyou can put down the garbage disposal\nwhatever it is rip that piece of paper\nout that is the last time that you are\ngoing to see that piece of paper i would\nrecommend having a fire ceremony for it\nwe used to do this before with our\nlimiting beliefs when i was younger in\nthe first sales company i was in we\nwould write down all of our living\nbeliefs and then we would burn them you\nknow don't do this inside of your house\nbecause i don't need you burning your\nhouse down we would burn them and watch\nthem burn and go that's the last time\nthat i'm ever going to say that to\nmyself take a picture tag me on\ninstagram rob dial junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r\nof you burning your limiting beliefs and\nthe the negative things that you say to\nyourself take a picture and share it\nhave a fire ceremony for the negative\nself-talk so you can never have it again\nnow we're going to have that blank sheet\nof paper and what are we going to do\nwith that blank sheet of paper you\nguessed it i want you to write down all\nof the things that you want to say to\nyourself all the things that you would\nwant a great friend or a great spouse or\nsignificant other to say to you you're\nbeautiful you look amazing you know uh\nyou're perfect just the way you are no\nmatter how you are you're smart you're\nfunny you're a great friend you're a\nhard worker you're supportive\nyou're perfect whatever it is write all\nof those things down go ahead you can\npause me i'll be here literally forever\ni will literally be here forever that's\nthe way the internet works if you pause\nme and leave me for the next six hours\nand push play i'll still be here at the\nexact same point so if you want to pause\nme pause me\nwrite down all the things that you want\nto say to yourself that you would want a\nsupportive person to say to you to make\nyou feel better\nyou're beautiful you're smart you're\nfunny you're successful you're you're a\nhard worker you're a great friend you're\nsupportive all the things that you want\nsomeone to say and what i want you to do\nis this\ni want you to take a picture of that\nwith your phone so you have it with you\nat all times next time you feel down on\nyourself i want you to look at that\npicture on your phone you know what else\ni want you to do i want you to take out\nyour favorite three to five things on\nthat piece of paper i want you to write\nthem with a dry erase marker on your\nmirror so every time you go into the\nbathroom you see them and you make\nyourself read them every time you wash\nyour hands\ndo it go for it tag me in this as well\non instagram\nyou know what else you should do take\nsome sticky notes the neon sticky notes\nthe bright pink and put those sticky\nnotes with those affirmations you're\nbeautiful you're smart whatever it is\nput them everywhere so you see them all\nof the time you open up your drawer\ninside of your kitchen you got it there\nyou're driving your car it's on your\ndashboard you need to literally\nbrainwash yourself\nto rewire the negative self-talk so that\nyou can start talking to yourself the\nway that you want to talk to yourself\nput reminders everywhere\nyour car your mirror the sticky notes\nput them everywhere you possibly can\nit's not weird\nit's not\npeople might think that it's weird it's\nnot weird i don't think that it's weird\nbecause\nwhy would you not do something like this\nwhy would you not try to build yourself\nup why would you not be obsessed with\nyourself because ultimately we're taught\nthat oh if you're obsessed with yourself\nyou're narcissistic and there's\nsomething wrong with that you shouldn't\nyou shouldn't love yourself like we're\ntaught those types of things oh no you\ndefinitely shouldn't love yourself as\nmuch you do oh my gosh you're so into\nyourself you're full of yourself\ni'm full of myself\nwho the hell should i be full of\nyou\nsomeone else\nno i should be full of myself before i'm\nfull of anybody else\nbecause ultimately i can't give away\nwhat i don't have so i need to love\nmyself\nbefore i can fully love somebody else\nit's not narcissistic it's not obsessive\nwhat it is it's loving it's supportive\nit's building a great foundation of\nconfidence\nthat's what it truly is\nthink about that for a second\ni want to tell you a a strategy that one\nof my friends went through\nabout nine months ago he realized that\nhe didn't love himself and he said that\nif you would have gone up to him and\nasked him hey you know i won't say his\nname let's say his name is john hey john\ndo you love yourself he'd be like yeah\nof course i love myself and then he went\nthrough these journeys of work and work\nand work on himself and he realized he\ndidn't fully love himself\nat all\nand so he had this idea of i should tell\nmyself that i love myself\nand so what i'm going to do\nand this is what i recommend you do and\nthis has been a massive journey for him\nand it's been huge in his self-love\nprocess it's been almost a year now he's\nbeen doing he's a completely different\nperson\nwhat he does is he gets this is every\nsingle morning takes a shower\ndries off\nstays completely naked takes off his\ntowel and i have he's he got this from\none of our friends who's a really deep\nworker\nin this space\ngets completely naked look at himself in\nthe mirror\nsets his timer for five minutes\nand completely naked no clothes looks\nhimself in the eyes and says i love you\ni\nlove you\njohn\ni love you\nand he says it over and over and over\nagain and some days it's easy and some\ndays it's a struggle and he's like why\nis this a struggle why is this so hard\nand things will come up memories will\ncome up things he hasn't processed\ntraumas\nevents that happened in his past will\ncome up and guess what he has to work\nthrough it and it's a journey of\nself-love\nand you might say why would you do it\nnaked though because that's you fully\nshowing up to yourself\nif you can't be naked in front of\nyourself and say i love you you can't be\nnaked in front of someone else you can't\nyou can't be fully seen until you allow\nyourself to fully see yourself\nso it's a journey i remember when i was\nyounger and i first heard about saying i\nlove you inside of the mirror i thought\ni was kind of crazy and then i was like\nyou know what i'll take this journey and\ni didn't have much confidence i wasn't\nborn with confidence i was very\nunconfident until i got into a sales\ncompany where i had to work on myself\nand do a lot of personal development and\nread and go to conferences and grow push\nmyself and i remember somebody came in\nand gave a speech to us and said listen\nwhat you should do every morning is look\nyourself in the mirror and say i love\nyou a hundred times\nevery single morning my friend does it\nhe sets five minutes on his phone that\nmight be even easier but i would sit\nthere and i would say i love you\ni love you\nrob i love you\ni love you\ni\nlove\nyou\nand i would say it over and over and\nover again\nand then one day i just forgot to do it\ni did it for months and months and\nmonths and months and one day i just\nforgot to do it and the next day i\nforgot i forgot and i forgot i forgot\nand then years down the road i went\nsomebody came up to me and said why do\nyou have so much confidence where'd it\ncome from and i was like i don't know\nwhere the hell i came from because i\nhaven't always been this way and then\nsnap myself back into that moment i went\noh my god\ni've told myself i love you thousands\nand thousands and thousands of times my\ngirlfriend makes fun of me because i\ntalk to myself in the mirror and i'm\nlike damn you look good today i say that\nto myself it was just something that i\nlearned to do i don't even have any i\ndon't even know what negative self-talk\nis anymore because it doesn't even live\nin my brain it used to\nbut i rewired it\ni don't even know i was rewiring it it\njust ended up happening and it's a\nbeautiful thing to live that way\neverybody deserves to live that way you\nshould be your biggest fan\nnot your mom not your spouse not your\nbrother sister anybody else you should\nbe your biggest fan\nas i said earlier who the hell else\nshould you be\nobsessed with who the hell else should\nyou be full of you\nyou\nyou you\nbecause ultimately if you don't love\nyourself if you're not showing up fully\nfor yourself you're not showing up fully\nfor the world you're not showing up the\ngreat you that you could be the world\nneeds you to show up in a powerful way\nthe world needs more powerful people\nmore than ever\ncould you be one of the people that step\nup could you be one of the people that\ngive love to yourself and also give love\nto others\nthink about it you're worth it i promise\nyou that\nyou deserve it but more than anything\nelse\nyou actually need it\nwe need\nthe self-love\nwe need more people that are confident\nthat are able to do the things they need\nto in the world we need you to love\nyourself and you\nneed you\nto love yourself\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo
