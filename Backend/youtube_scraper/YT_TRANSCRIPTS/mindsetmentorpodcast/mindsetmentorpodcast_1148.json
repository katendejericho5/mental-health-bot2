    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nthe six steps to hit any goal you want\ncoming up\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe six steps to hit any goal that you\nwant to in life and i got this from my\nfavorite book think and grow rich but\nthis is in think and grow she\nspecifically talks about\njust how to use this towards making\nmoney\ni take this and change it just a little\nbit so that you can hit any goal that\nyou want to not just money it could be\nanything that you want to so grab a pen\nand paper let's dive into it the first\nstep is to fix your mind on the exact\ngoal that you want\nthe exact goal that you want and one\nthing that i always say when i talk\nabout goal setting that i see most\npeople make massive mistakes with\nis that they're not clear on what their\ngoal is exactly like their goal would be\nfor instance to\nmake more money this year but if you\nmake a dollar more than you did last\nyear you hit your goal right but i'm\nsure you didn't want to make just a\ndollar more so you've got to know the\nexact dollar amount that you want to\nmake this year another example is people\nsay stuff like oh i want to lose weight\nwell if you lose one pound you've lost\nweight so you need to be very very very\nvery very i can't say very enough in\nthis situation\nvery specific on exactly what your goal\nis because you won't hit a target that\nyou can't see so you've got to be very\nvery clear of exactly what your goal is\nbecause the better that you can see the\nmore concise you get and the more clear\nthat you get with that goal the better\nchance you have of hitting it and so an\nexample would be something like this\ninstead of saying i want to lose weight\nthis year\nyou could say something like i want to\nlose 10 pounds by the end of the year\nwhich means that i will weigh um\nyou know 185 by the end of the year and\ni want to get myself down to seven\npercent body fat and you know what\nhere's a picture of the person who has\nthe perfect body that i want and that's\nwhat i want to look like do you see the\ndifference between i just want to lose\nweight in between that is you're very\nclear on exactly what it is that you\nwant the better that you can get the\nmore clear that you can get on what it\nis that you want the better that you can\nsee it and the more likely you are to\nhit it so the first step is you have to\nbe extremely extremely clear on exactly\nwhat it is that you're shooting for\nthe second thing\nis super important i don't think most\npeople actually pay attention this\nis determine what you plan to give up\nin order to get what you want\nso you know in order to get your goal\nyou're going to have to in order to to\ndo something you've never done you're\ngoing to have to stop doing some things\nand so what that means is if let's let's\ncontinue on the path of losing 10 pounds\nwhat do you intend to give up maybe you\ntend to give up alcohol for you know\nmonday through friday and you can only\nhave alcohol on saturday or so maybe\ndecide to give alcohol up for the rest\nof the year\nmaybe you decide to give up sugar maybe\ndecide to give up processed foods maybe\nyou decide to give up meat i don't know\nwhat it is for you but you've got to get\nextremely clear of what you plan to give\nup in order to get that because now you\nknow what you can cross out of your\nschedule and not have to worry about\nagain let's say that you want to make\n200 000 this year what are you going to\ngive up well you're probably going to\nhave to start getting up earlier maybe\nstick to a morning routine so then that\nmeans you're going to have to you know\ngive up your late nights maybe that\nmeans you're going to have to give up\nhaving coffee after noon right and you\nhave to figure out in order to get this\ngoal i'm going to have to change things\nabout myself i'm going to change think\nabout my schedule and i'm also going to\nhave to give things up what are the\nthings that you need to give up in order\nto hit the first thing that we were just\ntalking about in number one\nnumber three is you need to establish\na definite date that you will hit this\nby you need to give yourself a deadline\nit's like the phrase says a goal without\na deadline is just a dream\nso what is it what is the exact deadline\noh i want to hit it by\nyou know the for the beginning of\nquarter two maybe you say i want to lose\nthose 10 pounds by december 31st of this\nyear you got to know exactly when it is\nthat you have to have it done by because\nthe human mind works really well with\ndeadlines it's the reason why the day\nbefore you go on vacation is the most\nproductive day that you have of the\nentire years because you have a deadline\nit has to be done and so if you can get\nvery clear on exactly what it is that\nyou're doing and you know the date\nyou've got the road paved now we just\ngot to figure out what you got to do and\nwhat you got to stop doing in order to\nhit that goal that you're shooting for\nso now that you know what your goal is\nwhat you intend to give up and now you\nalso know the date the fourth thing is\nlet's come up with a plan let's sit down\nwith a pen and paper and pretend that\nthis goal of yours is just this it's\nlike a business plan you're starting\nyou're trying to start a very successful\ncompany you need a business plan put\ntogether right so if i want to lose 10\npounds and i want to uh get my body\nweight to 150 i'm sorry 185 and i want\nto get my body fat down to 7\nand i want to look like this guy in this\npicture right here i'm going to do it by\ndecember 31st of this year\nand i intend to give up\nalcohol i intend to give up processed\nfoods i intend to give up\nyou know sugars\nokay now i know what i'm giving up now\nlet's make a plan i also looking at this\nknow that i'm gonna have to get really\nclear on my caloric intake every single\nday and i'm gonna figure out exactly how\nmuch i'm gonna how much i'm gonna have\neach day my micros my macros all the\nstuff i need to figure out i'm also\ngonna have to figure out a workout plan\nokay so i'm gonna work out four times a\nweek monday tuesday wednesday thursday\nand then i'll take friday saturday\nsunday off and then i'm going to meal\nprep every single sunday and every\nsingle thursday and now i can come up\nwith a plan and it doesn't look that\nhard to hit my goal anymore because i\nhave the plan in front of me and now i\njust look at it and go okay now all i've\ngot to do is actually follow through\ni've got to actually do what i've put\ndown on this piece of paper\nso now we've got a plan\nnow here's where it starts to get really\nimportant this is where most people\nusually mess up hey if you're enjoying\nthis video do me a favor and hit that\nlike button down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you\nvery rarely do people know what their\ngoals are if they do know what their\ngoals are they don't have any sort of\ndeadline to them if they do have a\ndeadline to them they don't have any\nsort of plan and if they have a plan\nthey usually don't do this what they\nusually do is they usually forget about\nit how often have you gotten to december\n31st of xyz year and you go god i don't\neven remember what my goals were for\nthis year i don't even remember my new\nyear's resolutions were and the reason\nwhy is because you didn't figure out a\nway\nto get extremely clear on what your\ngoals are\nand make sure you remind yourself every\nsingle day and that's what the next two\nhave to go with number five is you need\nto write out a clear and concise\nstatement\nfour sentences five sentences maybe\nexplaining\none two three and four and so it'd say\nsomething like\ni'm going to lose 10 pounds\nget my body fat down to\nyou know 7\nget my body weight down to 185. this is\nthe picture of the person that i want to\nlook like and i'm going to do it by\ndecember 31st and i intend to give up\nalcohol i intend to give up sugar i\nintend to give up processed foods and my\nplan to get there is to\nevery sunday meal prep my food to make\nsure that i don't even have to think i'm\njust going to have to eat the food that\ni have therefore i don't get caught in\nlow blood sugar and then going towards\ncandy which is what i normally do which\nthen obviously screws everything up i'm\nalso going to do meal prepping every\nsingle thursday and my workout plan is\ni'm going to do high intensity interval\nworkouts monday tuesday wednesday\nthursday and i'm going to do yoga on\nsaturday and i'm going to do that for\nthe entire rest of the year and if i do\nthat it looks like i should hit my goal\nright and so it'd be like four or five\nsentences whatever it is but do you see\nhow when you follow these steps to a t\nyou get very very very clear and\ngranular and now all you have to do you\ndon't even have to think you just have\nto execute\nand that brings us down to the very last\none which is number six is to take this\nclear and concise statement and read it\nto yourself at least\nevery single morning and every single\nevening\nwhy the evening because you're setting\nyour subconscious up because your\nsubconscious mind is what is working the\nwhole time that you're asleep so you're\nsaying it to yourself before you go to\nbed you know programming into your\nsubconscious you can start to believe\nit's possible so you don't forget and\nthen every single morning when you wake\nup as a reminder now if you want a bonus\na bonus is to say it to yourself you\nknow put a reminder in your phone so it\ngoes off every single hour and every\nsingle hour you read this statement to\nyourself you're literally going to\nbrainwash yourself\ninto\nknowing exactly what it is you need to\ndo knowing the date that you're going to\ndo it by knowing what you're going to be\ngiving up so that you don't fall into\nthe trap of accidentally eating the\nwrong thing and knowing the exact plan\nso now it's literally if somebody were\nto smack you at 3 o'clock in the morning\nyour sleep they just come up they smack\nyou in the face and they say hey\nwhat is your plan\nto lose 10 pounds by december 31st this\nyear\nyou can just read it off it's got to be\nthat deeply ingrained into your\nsubconscious mind\nthat it's it's not only possible it's\ngoing to happen\nand that's what most people usually\ndon't do they usually don't have\nreminders set for them if you want to go\neven further so you have you can read it\nto yourself every single morning you can\nread it to yourself every single night\nor you can read it to yourself every\nsingle hour put it on your phone and\nmake yourself read it to yourself every\nsingle hour if you're at work you have\nto look at your phone you have to say it\nout you have to even if you're at your\ncubicle you have to whisper to yourself\nand you have to go through the whole\nthing or go to the bathroom and talk to\nyourself in the bathroom whatever's you\nhave to do\nif you want to go even further get\nsticky notes and put it everywhere when\nyou're driving your car put it inside of\nyour car so that you can see it don't\ncover the speedometer but put an extra\nspeedometer so you could see your goal\nand exactly what it is that you're\nshooting for make a vision board of the\npeople who have the perfect bodies the\nperfect lives that you want make\nyourself see that every single day um\nyou know inside of your your bathroom\nwhen you walk in your bathroom take dry\nerase marker and put your goals up and\nthen really what you do is to hold\nyourself accountable then you force\nyourself to get onto the scale every\nsingle day because when you track\nsomething it's much more likely to\nhappen and so you track it every single\nday and so you're literally going okay\ni'm 195. and then what you do is when\nyou lose a pound you put okay i'm at\n194. all right i'm at 193 and you put it\nup on on the the dry erase so you\nliterally see it every single day\nthis is the difference between somebody\nwho just kind of\ncoasts through life\nand somebody who steps into the driver's\nseat and says i'm going to hit my goals\ni'm going to make my life what i want it\nto be there is no other option but\nsuccess\nthis is the only option that i have i'm\ngoing to succeed at it i have the plan i\nknow exactly what i'm doing and there is\nno possible way on this freaking earth\nthat i'm not going to hit my goal that's\nthe difference between a successful\nperson and an unsuccessful person\nsomeone who goes through life and\nsomeone who steps in the driver's seat\nand says i'm in control of this freaking\nthing everybody get out of the way i'm\nin the one that's in control and this is\ngoing to this ship is going to go where\ni tell it to go\nso those are the six steps setting goal\nreal quick number one know exactly what\nit is that you want to be very very\nclear on it number two determine what\nyou intend to give up in order to get\nthat number three establish a definite\ndate number four create a definite plan\nnumber five write out a clear and\nconcise statement of about four to five\nsentences and number six read it to\nyourself\nat least twice every single day and once\nagain this is from my favorite book\nthink and grow rich if you're interested\nin buying it i'll just go ahead and link\nit down below you can just buy it if you\nwant to i recommend every single person\nread it it's my favorite book i probably\nread it\n10 times i would say it was a first real\nbook that opened my eyes to oh my god\nsuccess is possible for anybody because\nit's every single part of being\nsuccessful is just clear steps to\ngetting there it's not just for some\npeople and for not for other people it's\nreally like anybody can be successful\nand create their life into what they\nwant it to be but there's a lot of steps\nthat need to go into it and you've got\nto hit them hey
