    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nthe four things that you need to focus\non to have more energy in your life\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be diving into the\nfour things that you need to focus on to\nhave more energy in your life and what\nwe're actually going to be talking about\nare the four things that you want to pay\nattention to and also avoid so that you\nhave more energy in your life because\nultimately a lot of times what we look\nat are the four things that we need to\nfocus on to have more energy not\nthinking about the things that actually\nsteal\nenergy away from us so let's dive into\nit the first thing that's kind of odd\nthat most people don't pay attention to\nthat steals energy from them that drains\nthem or can give them energy is the\nmusic that you listen to the music that\nyou listen to ultimately what is music\nmusic is sound in words\nin its simplest form it's sound in its\nwords\nsound is just a vibration that's\ntraveling through the air that vibration\ngoes into your eardrums and then\nobviously it's vibrating into your body\nand so most people don't think about is\nthat our bodies are actual vibrating\npieces of machinery we are all vibrating\nif you were to zoom into our hands and\nlook at them under a microscope if it\nwas possible you would see that you were\nin constant vibration so the music that\nyou're listening to actually changes the\nfrequency or the vibration that your\nbody is at and when you think about the\nsound also think about the words that go\nwith it as well words when you say them\nout loud or you say them in your head\nare all affirmations whether that's a\npositive affirmation or whether that's a\nnegative affirmation and so you got to\nstart thinking to yourself the music\nthat i'm listening to is it uplifting is\nit inspiring do i feel better after\nlistening to it or\nis it aggressive is it mean is it nasty\ndo i feel worse after listening to it\nthe words that i'm saying inside of this\nand i'm singing out loud to myself is it\nyou know the type of future that i want\nis it the way that i want to treat\npeople you know the other day we were\ndriving we were listening to kanye and i\nwas like what the hell is this music\nlike i love the beat i love the way that\nit sounds but when you listen to the\nwords i was like this just isn't\nsomething like this isn't the thing that\ni would walk around and say to myself or\nif i was in the middle of a meditation i\nwould repeat these things to myself and\nso\nthere's certain music that you might\nlisten to that you might not even be\nrealizing or actually draining your\nenergy that are actually sucking the\nenergy out of you\nso think about it the sound the music\nthe frequency the music is at in the\nwords the affirmations that you're\nsinging in your head over and over and\nover again or you're singing out loud\nthink about it you know everything is an\naffirmation whether it's you know a\npositive affirmation you know i am\ngetting better every single day i am\nattracting more wealth into my life i am\nattracting the perfect partner or spouse\nor whatever it is or any of the negative\nstuff that you could say and when you\nlisten to music what happens it usually\ngets stuck inside of your head\nand so if you're repeating these things\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain ask yourself this question is this\nthe type of stuff that i actually want\nto repeating be repeating and\nprogramming into my subconscious because\nsomething that's repeated through\nrepetition over and over and over again\nis programming your subconscious so\nis the music that you're listening to is\nit programming your subconscious the way\nthat you want to is it giving you energy\nor is it draining you from energy\nthe second thing\nthat will either give you energy or suck\nenergy from you are the people that you\nspend time with\nand this is important because we've all\nheard the phrase your network will\ndetermine your net worth you know if\nthey say that pay attention the five\npeople that you spend the most time with\nif you look around you and you see the\nfive people you spend the most time with\nwhat are they like\ndo they have are they are they on the\njourney with you to create a better\nfuture when you look and fast forward\nthree four five years do you want to be\nin the same circumstances of those\npeople where they are in three four five\nyears\nbecause ultimately if you hang out with\nfive millionaires you're probably going\nto be the sixth if you hang out with\nfive alcoholics you're probably going to\nbe the six if you hang out with five\noverweight people you're probably going\nto be the six if you hang out with five\nextremely healthy people you're probably\ngonna be the sixth\nso what are the people that you surround\nyourself like are they motivating to you\ndo they inspire you do they help you\ncelebrate your wins and your successes\nor do they talk down to you do they make\nfun of you do they make you feel worse\nabout your successes whenever you come\nto them with something really exciting\nthat happened to your life\ndo they celebrate with you and are they\ntruly happy for you or are they trying\nto poke holes into your wins\nthink about that and what you have to\nrealize is that there might be some\npeople that are in your top five you\ndon't have to get rid of them and never\nsee them again but maybe you spend less\ntime with them and you think all right\nthis person is actually you know kind of\ndemotivating they don't seem like\nthey're going on the path that i really\nwant to be going on if i were to fast\nforward their life in three to five\nyears i probably don't want to be in the\ncircumstance that they are in three to\nfive years so maybe i spend less time\nwith them and i replace them and spend\nmore time with someone who's an\nacquaintance that i need to develop a\ndeeper relationship with or maybe i\nspend time and go out and try to find a\nmentor that i can spend more time with\nor maybe i have someone who's already in\nmy top five that's super inspiring that\ni want to spend more time with and\ndevelop a deeper relationship with so\nsomething that can actually give you\nmore energy or take energy from you are\nthe people that you spend the most time\nwith i always say that people can either\nbe batteries or they can be black holes\nbatteries they can give you more energy\nyou can hang out with them you can feel\ninspired you can feel excited you can\nleave their house and be like i'm going\nto go take on the world now i got to\nwant to go work out now i want to build\nthat business now i want to go make more\nmoney and i want to impact the world or\nyou can be around someone for 15 minutes\nand you're like holy crap i need a nap\nthose are the black holes and so the\npeople that you surround yourself with\nstart to categorize them is this person\nmore of a battery or they more of a\nblack hole because ultimately the people\nthat you spend the most time with are\ngoing to dictate the energy that you\nhave throughout the day\nthat's number two hey if you're enjoying\nthis video do me a favor and hit that\nlike button down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you\nthe set of the third thing that actually\ngets into your subconscious that you\nmight not be spending a whole lot of\ntime thinking about are all of the\nadvertisements in the commercials that\nyou see and hear\nand read every single day you know if\nyou're watching tv\nand you happen to see an ad that pops up\nand you're not even paying much\nattention to the ad but it says hey you\nknow do you ever feel tired at 4 pm and\nyou're like oh my god yeah of course i\nfeel tired at 4 pm because we all know\nthose big pharma ads that ask the most\ngeneric questions you know do you ever\ngo pee once a day oh yes i do\nsomething wrong with me right you got to\nstart thinking about then they're like\nwell if you go you know have to go pee\nmore than two times in a day or you have\nto take a nap at four o'clock you might\nhave xyz\nand you hear that and that goes into\nyour subconscious now your subconscious\nstarts to think maybe there's something\nwrong with me maybe i do have this\ndisease maybe i do have this disorder\nand you have to be very very uh\nconscious of what you let into your ears\nwhat you let into your eyes what you let\ninto your mind because ultimately\neverything comes in\nthrough to your subconscious from your\nconscious mind to your consciousness and\nthen it's not\nit's automatically stored away as true\nthere's no part of your subconscious\nmind that says is this true is this not\ntrue it's like a filing cabinet it just\nstores it all away and so you have to\nthink of the ads that pop up when you're\ndriving the billboards that you see the\nmagazines that you read when you're\nreading magazines and you're looking at\ncosmo and seeing all the fit women and\nyou're looking at yourself and you're\nlike oh my god i don't look anything\nlike them i'm fat i'm ugly they're so\nmuch prettier than me they have so many\nuh somebody so much beautiful skin my\nskin has issues and then you start\nthinking oh my gosh these advertisements\nof these perfect quote unquote perfect\npeople who are just all photoshopped\nmakes me feel worse about myself maybe i\nshould stop reading that magazine maybe\ni should stop going on that website home\nmaybe i should stop following most of\nthe people that i follow on instagram\nthat are all just completely\nphotoshopped that make me feel worse\nabout myself\nso start paying attention to those\nbecause if you look at something that's\nan advertisement or somebody that's on\ninstagram\nand you look at them and you're like\ni wish i had her body\nand you look at them now you start to\nfeel worse about yourself that that you\njust said in your head was an\naffirmation it was a negative\naffirmation it's going to be repeated\nand it's going to go from your your\nconscious mind to your subconscious mind\nand stored and now your subconscious\nmind just assumes that you have a\nterrible body or assumes that you have\nterrible skin or assumes that you're not\ngood enough or smart enough or pretty\nenough or worthy of love whatever it is\nyou have to be very cognizant of what's\ngoing into your mind\nso the ads that you see the people that\nyou follow on instagram the you know the\nplaces that you hang out that that you\nnormally shop at and you see the ads\nthat they have you have really really\npay attention to some of those and the\ngood thing about when you're on facebook\nor instagram and you get hit with an ad\nyou can always report the ad and say you\nknow this is inappropriate this is not\nfor me so they don't show you those\ntypes of ads again so you have to be\nvery clear of those also when you're\nwatching tv like i said the ads that\nyou're seeing there if you're watching\ntv and you're seeing ad after add after\naddress to ad\nmaybe it's time for you to turn the tv\noff and open a book because the book's\nnot going to have advertisements inside\nof it maybe you should start thinking\nabout oh man i spend too much time\nwatching tv\nand now with all that that tv i've been\nwatching but hit with ads after ads\nafter ads after ads after ads we were\nwatching tv for the first time in the\nlongest time because we don't you know\nwe watch netflix and so there are no\ncommercials that pop up and we were\nsurprised that there's literally we're\nwatching shark tank it was like every\nother minute it seemed like we were\ngetting hit with ads and ads and ads and\nads and you know it's like a 30-minute\nshow is actually only 22 minutes so\nthere's eight minutes of ads almost a\nthird of what we're watching is just\nadvertisements and so you have to be\nvery clear on the ads that you see and\nif they're the ads that you want to be\nseeing or if you should divert your\nenergy and your focus into something\nelse because it can make you feel like\nsomething's wrong with you\nso that's number three and the fourth\nthing which is very\nvery common for people to think about\nbut then also forget about is the food\nthat you eat\nwhat type of food are you eating\nthroughout the day the one thing that i\ntry to pay attention to is after i eat\nevery single time that i eat i ask\nmyself how do i feel about an hour later\nand that will give me a pretty good idea\nif i should ever eat that thing again or\nnot because ultimately what i know is\nthis we have 24 hours in the day\neverybody has 24 hours in the day and if\ni'm tired most of the day\nbecause of the food that i'm eating i\nneed to change the food that i'm eating\nbecause billionaires and bums all get 24\nhours and if i'm going through my day at\n60 energy\n75 percent energy it's not enough to\ncreate the life that i want\nand so then i'm going to look at it and\nsay okay you know what people am i\nspending time with what music am i\nlistening to what ads am i getting hit\nwith who am i following on instagram you\nknow what food have i been eating that\nall of these things can be draining the\nenergy out of me because ultimately\nwith the amount of time that we're given\nwe're only awake for about 16 hours a\nday i want to make sure for me that i\ncan be as productive as possible because\nit's not about being busy it's about\nbeing productive and if the food that\ni'm eating is starting to make me feel\nworse it's got to go\nsure of course i would love to have a\nbig fat burger every single day covered\nin bacon you know but i don't eat those\nthings anymore because they\nliterally drain energy out of my body\nbecause the most energy consuming thing\nthat your body does is digestion\nso if you're eating something that's big\nand heavy in the middle of the day\nyou're gonna get really tired you're\ngoing to feel like you need a nap if\nyou're having too much sugar throughout\nthe day and you get a massive spike in\nyour blood sugar it's going to drop and\nwhen it drops watch out because you're\ngoing to feel like you need a nap\nyou're going to feel like you need a 5\nhour energy you're going to feel like\nyou need a coffee and\nthat is not the type of energy that you\nwant to have so you got to be very clear\nof the food that you're eating\nare you eating something greasy are you\neating something with a lot of\nfat are you eating something with a lot\nof that's really thick and\nhearty so that therefore it takes a lot\nfor your body to digest it because your\nbody will focus on shutting everything\nelse down which is why if you have a big\nhuge meal you literally feel like you\nhave to take a nap is because your body\nis like all right shut it all down we\ngot to digest because it is the most\nenergy consuming thing that your body\ndoes so the four things that can either\ngive you energy throughout the day or\nstrip energy away from you are this\nnumber one the music that you listen to\nthe sounds and the words and the\naffirmations that you use by listening\nto that music number two are the people\nthat you spend time with they can either\nbe batteries or they can be black holes\nnumber three the ads that you see\nthroughout the day whether that's on\ninstagram or facebook or the magazines\nthat you read or listening to the radio\nor watching tv or number four the food\nthat you eat so those are the four\nthings that i would focus on and if you\nreally really want to get in depth and\nfigure out how to make your energy\nbetter this is what i recommend to\npeople set an alarm in your phone every\nsingle hour for the next week\ntake a log and what i want you to do is\non a scale of one to ten so from seven\nto eight o'clock you wake up eight\no'clock your phone goes off you're gonna\nrate from one to ten what your energy\nwas like one to ten one being super low\nten being extremely high the highest it\ncould be then from eight to nine nine\no'clock your phone goes off you're gonna\ngo oh i need to log my energy on a scale\nof one to ten nine to ten you log your\nenergy\nand you go on and on and on and on and\nwhat you look at is you start to notice\nthere's fluctuations in your energy and\nthen you go man was there something that\ni ate was there someone that i hung out\nwith\ndid i started thinking negatively myself\nwas there music that i was listening to\nthat either gave me energy or took\nenergy away from me and you start to\nrealize there's certain times of day\nwhen you have more energy there's\ncertain times of the day where you have\nless energy there's certain foods that\nyou eat that strip energy away from you\nand if you really take this serious and\nlog it every single hour for the next\nseven days you'll notice a massive\ndifference in what you should do\nthroughout your day in order to make\nsure that you have more energy so those\nare the four things that i got for you\nonce again the music that you listen to\nthe people that you spend the time with\nthe ads that you see and the food that\nyou eat\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if\nyou're listening to this or you're\nwatching this\nthere's something inside of you that\nfeels that you need more that you that\nyou're you're destined for more\nyou wouldn't be here if you didn't feel\nlike you were destined for more so if\nthat's the case let's be very clear on\nthe stuff that we're putting into our\nbody and how we feel"
