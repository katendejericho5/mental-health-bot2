    "transcript": "depression can be an actual chemical\nimbalance in your brain anxiety only\ncomes from your thoughts\nyour anxiety can actually be fixed if\nyou\nand i'm back to normal\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to rewire your anxious brain so if\nyou're out there you feel like i deal\nwith anxiety a little bit too much i'm\nactually going to teach you how to\nrewire the anxiety that you have in your\nbrain by first off understanding where\nthe anxiety comes from what anxiety is\nand then the two different parts of the\nbrain that actually deal with your\nanxious thoughts and first off what i\nwant to say is this anxiety comes from\nyour thoughts so i always have to\npreface whenever i talk about anxiety is\nthat anxiety and depression are two\ncompletely separate things depression\ncan be an actual chemical imbalance in\nyour brain anxiety only comes from your\nthoughts and so that means that your\nanxiety can actually be fixed if you fix\nyour thoughts and anxiety is actually\nmore prevalent than depression nowadays\nit is called basically the common cold\nof mental illnesses and we can fix it\nand so this episode is going to teach\nyou exactly how to fix it\nanxiety just so you know though is\nusually fear of something happening in\nthe future and so if we can process\nthese fears of something happening in\nthe future it'll help you know how to\nwork through them whenever you go\nthrough them so one of the beautiful\nthings about being a human is that we\ncan imagine the future we have really\nreally\ncomplex and beautiful\nimaginations but the problem with that\nis if we don't pay attention to them and\nwe're not in control of them they can\ncompletely get out of hand by bringing\nin too much fear of imagining something\nbad happening inside of the future and\nso i'm going to talk about two major\ncircuits inside of your brain so that we\ncan dive into each one of them and know\nhow anxiety works in both of them the\nfirst one is called your neocortex now\nyour neocortex is the more advanced of\nthe two that i'm going to talk about\nyour neocortex\nis\nwhen you have anxiety in your neocortex\nit's the anticipation of something bad\nhappening in the future you know like i\nsaid humans can imagine the future but\nif we don't pay attention those can get\nout of hand and so you have\nanxiety-inducing thoughts so your\nthoughts\nof what could possibly happen in this\nfuture is going to make you anxious and\nso i'll give you an example let's say\nyou're driving your car and it's a place\nthat you typically drive your car and\naround a certain bend let's not even say\nin a bin let's say that you get to a\nstoplight and you go through the\nstoplight you're sitting there you're\nstopped and then it turns green for you\nand you decide to start going and you\nstart going and then boom you're smacked\nsomebody t-boned your car now you live\nthrough it you're fine no big deal but\nnext time you're at that exact same\nstoplight you're going to think oh my\ngod i should probably look both ways\nbefore i go\nbecause i don't want to be t-boned again\nthat's the next time you're at that\nstoplight and you know what next time\nyou're at each stoplight you might\nslowly take off and looked right and\nlook left and you might get anxiety\nabout going through a stoplight and so\nwith your neocortex it's able to\nlook into the future and say this might\nhappen i should be anxious about it i\nshould be very cautious about this\nhappening you know and i always give\nthis example let's say you walk by a\nlake and one day you happen to see an\nalligator outside of that lake and you\nsaw an alligator attack a bird\nwell then if you have to go by that that\nlake every single day you're going to\nthink about that alligator every single\nday and what you're doing is you're the\ngood thing about this anxiety and\nthinking into the future is that it kept\nour species alive because we were able\nto go okay something bad happened in\nthis exact spot i need to think about\nthat bad thing so that i can avoid it so\nthat i don't you know have that bad\nthing happen to me whether it's a car\naccident getting tebowed at a stoplight\nor maybe it's walking by a lake because\nyou saw something attack something else\nyou're going to think about that\nnow what does this have to do with your\npersonal anxiety is you know you can\nhave anxious thoughts about getting up\nand going on stage\nyou can think what if people don't\naccept me what if they laugh me off\nstage what if i go and give this\npresentation for my boss and i look like\na complete fool\nand what you can do is you can have\nanxiety thinking about a future event\nnow you have to realize once again this\nkept our species alive that's a\nbeautiful thing but if you let it run\nrampant it's going to completely control\nyour life now how do you get rid of it\nhow do you get rid of it well the good\nthing about the neocortex and getting\nrid of it is that this is the thinking\npart of your brain\nso how do you get rid of it you think\nthrough it you think through these\nthings couple ways that you can do it\nnumber one is through meditation so if\nyou for instance have\nthe\nfeeling of i'm going to give a\npresentation\ni don't want to be completely\nembarrassed and mess up or walk up there\nwith my fly down you can sit and\nactually go okay this is my neocortex\nthis is the thinking part of my brain\ni'm thinking about something happening\nin the future and it is right now giving\nme anxiety okay so what do i need to do\ni need to calm that part of my brain\ndown what's the easiest way to calm\nmyself down breathing visualization and\nmeditation and so you can sit there and\ngo okay i'm feeling anxiety\nokay\nfeeling anxiety right now what am i\nfeeling anxious about i'm feeling\nanxious about giving this presentation\nfor my boss what am i afraid of i am\nafraid of being embarrassed walking up\nthere with my fly down you know\nstumbling over my words whatever it is\nokay so i'm gonna close my eyes i'm\ngonna think through this i'm going to\nactually visualize and think\nand feel what it would feel like to get\nup there feel confident in myself give\nan amazing presentation and have my boss\ncome up to me after and say you know\nwhat rob you did a really great job we\nwant to give you a promotion whatever it\nis and you can literally instead of\nusing your thinking mind to create a bad\nfearful event you can use your thinking\nmind to do the exact opposite to see\nand feel more specifically feel\nhow successful that presentation that\nyou're so afraid to give actually feels\ninside of you and so when you get up and\ngive that presentation you've got a lot\nmore confidence\nbecause the neocortex if you realize how\nthis works inside of your brain you can\ngo okay\ni'm just feeling anxious that's okay\nthat's built inside of me being a human\nwhat am i feeling anxious about and then\nyou can start to process it and think\nthrough it once again it is in the\nthinking part of your brain so how do\nyou get rid of it you think through it\none of the really\nsmart ways to deal with the brain is if\nit's in a thinking part of the brain you\ncan show your brain how illogical that\nfear is\nfor instance you're afraid to go give\nthis presentation for your boss and you\nhave all of this fear you can go do you\nremember you know you gave your last\npresentation and you knocked it out of\npark and you gave another presentation\nand you knocked it out of the park and\nyou're not going to be fired for giving\na bad presentation and you can literally\nmake it seem illogical to your brain so\nyour brain's like this is ridiculous i\ndon't need to hold on to this fear\nanymore\nso that's the neocortex side of anxiety\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nso you could have an anxiety\ncoming up because of the neocortex side\nor you can have it because of the\namygdala which is the other major\ncircuit of the brain that has to deal\nwith anxiety the amygdala is where fear\ncomes from it is in the back of your\nbrain it's in the reptilian part of your\nbrain the oldest part of your brain that\ngives you fears\nthat sometimes are completely ridiculous\nand so the amygdala creates the fears\nand so for instance what happens is some\nyou see something or hear something or\nfeel something your body reacts and\nthinks later that's what the amygdala\ndoes so let's say you're walking in your\nhouse at night i've done this probably a\nmillion times you've got to go out you\nturn the light on because you've got to\nyou know go to the kitchen and get a\nglass of water and oh my god you see\nsomething and you react to it because\nyou think someone's inside of your house\nand then you realize it's just your\njacket that's you know on the coat rack\nand you're like oh my god okay that's\nthe amygdala reacting to something\nimmediately or you're walking outside\nand you're like oh my god snake and your\nbody just reacts\nand then you realize it's a curled up\nhose\nand it's not a noise or i'm sorry it's\nnot a snake\nbut it looked like a snake your body\nreacted the same way that your body\nreacted to the coat thinking that the\ncoat was someone that broke into your\nhouse is the same way that your body\nreacts to the hose thinking that it\nmight be a snake it's there\nto protect you you know you could be\nsitting it could be peaceful perfectly\nfine\nboom loud noise outside your body's\ngoing to react to it that is the\nreptilian part of your brain that just\nreacts\nso how do you deal with the amygdala and\nalso just so you know\nit responds quick and then asks\nquestions later and so it's the reason\nwhy you can't really talk yourself out\nof a panic attack because literally your\nbody is responding exactly like this it\nis doing what it's supposed to do this\nis where you know the part of the brain\nwhere ptsd usually works is they can\nhear it someone has ptsd let's say\nthey're ptsd for more and there's ptsd\nyou don't have to just go to war to have\nptsd you could have bad relationships\nyou could have trauma there's a lot of\ndifferent things but let's just say\nsomeone goes off to war\nand when they come back home they hear a\nloud noise it could set their ptsd off\nand their anxiety and their panic attack\ncomes up and the reason why is because\nthat part of the brain has literally\nbeen trained to be on alert for some\ntime six months a year two years while\npeople are overseas then they come back\nwhere that threat doesn't exist and that\npart of their brain they just can't turn\noff and that's when they have to seek\nmedical advice and attention for that so\nhow do we work through now that we know\nhow to work through the neocortex side\nof it how do we work through the\namygdala side of anxiety\nyou can't use your thinking mind you\nhave to bypass your thinking mind and\nliterally directly affect your nervous\nsystem because your nervous system will\nreact how do you do it a couple\ndifferent ways that you can do it number\none is deep breathing right the actual\nnervous system you have to calm your\nnervous system down through deep\nbreathing so if you feel\nanxious and anxiety attack coming up\nsomething happens your body just reacts\nto it and it's not you fearing something\nin the future it just pops up sometimes\nwhen people have anxiety attacks there's\nnothing that really set it off it's just\ntheir body reacting to something and so\nyou can breathe through it and deep\nbreathing would be you breathe in for\nfour seconds hold for four seconds\nbreathe out for seven seconds so it's\nlike this\nand you do that until you feel your\nnervous system start to calm down again\nand you can start i mean it's it's like\nthe phrase is perfect when emotion is\nhigh logic is low and your emotions are\nhigh you can't really think through\nthese types of things so you've got to\nbreathe through it calm your body down\ncalm your brain down calm your nervous\nsystem down to realize there's no\nimmediate fear that needs to be in front\nof you there's no immediate attack\nyou're not about to die you're in a safe\nplace what just happened\nloud noise or something that sets you\noff\nthere's no immediate something there's\nno immediate danger that's in front of\nyou\nso you can do it through deep breathing\nanother thing that's that supposedly\nworks really well is working out now\nthat your body's in a heightened state\nis to go and actually exert physical\nlike actually and here's the interesting\nthing is that if you ever watch a this\nis super interesting what you'll notice\nis if you watch a\nchase on national geographic of an\nanimal an animal gets chased by you know\nlet's say a\nlittle tiny rabbit gets chased by a\ncheetah right and the cheetah loses them\nvery quick a lot of animals what they'll\ndo is they'll actually shake they'll do\na quick shake right after the chase is\nover and the reason why is because\nthere's so much adrenaline and cortisol\ngoing through their body that they're\nactually trying to shake it out of their\nbody\nand so they have pent up energy that\nthey need to get out so sometimes when\npeople have really anxious thoughts or\nsomething coming up to be able to get\nrid of that helps a lot and the way to\ndo that is to exert yourself physically\nand that usually helps another way that\ni've actually never tried with an\nanxiety attack but i've tried it\nwhenever i'm stressed out or something\ncomes up is wim hoff who is considered\nthe ice man he does breathing techniques\nand teaches you how to breathe he does\nsomething where he does 30 deep breaths\nso it's 30 deep breaths like this\ndoes 30 of them and then on the 30th\nbreath breathe all the way in\nall the way out\nand on the 30th breath you sit there and\nyou do as many push-ups as you possibly\ncan and what it does is it actually\nsupposedly resets your nervous system uh\nand so for me\ni've done this before and i'm super\nstressed out i've got a lot of my plate\nmy brain's all over the place and i just\ncan't seem to focus on what it is i need\nto focus on is what i will do is i will\ndo 30 deep breaths exhale as deep as i\npossibly can so there's nothing inside\nof my body and then i'll do as many\npush-ups as i possibly can what's really\ncrazy is that when i do this i can do\nmore push-ups than when i am actually\nbreathing because you might sit there\nand think well if i'm going to be doing\npush-ups i need to breathe or i'm going\nto pass out right well of course you\nneed to breathe eventually but for me\nwhen i've whenever i've done this i have\nso much oxygen inside of my body i'm\nover oxygenated in my body and my\nmuscles in my blood that i can actually\ndo more push-ups than if i just do\nnormal breathing while i'm doing it and\nwhat i realize is after 40-50 push-ups\nwhich sometimes i can get to about 45-50\npush-ups before i need to breathe again\nit's like my nervous system has gotten\nrid of all of the anxious feelings and\nthe cortisol and the adrenaline it's\nworked all of it out\nand i'm back to normal and i feel normal\nagain\nso you know what you can do is you can\nuse these two different techniques\ndepending on what it is that you feel\nlike you're working for so if you feel\nanxiety coming through ask yourself what\ntype of anxiety is it is it the\nneocortex thinking brain side of it or\nis it the amygdala automatically\nreptilian just react fight-or-flight\nmechanism inside of your brain that's\nworking towards it and you can work\nthrough it if it's the neocortex\nremember it's the thinking part of your\nbrain you can think through it you can\nuse meditation you can show your brain\nhow ridiculous this fear of the future\nwhatever it is\nand you can work through it with your\nthinking part of your brain if it's the\namygdala you've got to bypass the\nthinking part of your brain you've got\nto do deep breathing you've got to do\nthe workout or you've got to try the\nwim hof breathing technique with the\npush-ups and both of those can help you\nanother thing that supposedly really\nhelps that i forgot about with the\namygdala side is cold showers take a\nreally really cold shower your body will\nreact and because it sees that as a\nthread and something that it needs to\nwork through but you know we could do a\nwhole other episode on on\non cold showers and cold baths because i\nlove those as well but figure out yours\nwith yourself is it the the neocortex\nthinking side or is it the amygdala just\nreaction side and depending on which one\nit is you can listen to this episode and\nyou can figure out a way to work through\nit to help yourself get past the anxiety\nthat you feel inside of your brain if\nyou do this enough it will actually\nstart to rewire your brain so that you\ndon't have these thoughts you don't have\nthese feelings and you can go on without\nhaving to worry about your anxiety\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well 90\nof the that you're worrying about means\nnothing\nso why are you focusing on it"
