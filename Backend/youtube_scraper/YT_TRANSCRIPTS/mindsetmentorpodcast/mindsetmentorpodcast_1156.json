    "transcript": "inhale\nreprogram who you want just have no\nexpectation there's a pretty good chance\nyou might cry out of half you might go\nthat makes no sense to me exhale\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe most important thing that you can do\nevery single morning i'm gonna give you\none thing and one thing only that you\nreally need to focus on we all hear\nabout how you should have an incredible\nmorning routine that lasts 30 minutes or\nan hour or two hours and that's\nbeautiful and i think that if you have\nthe time you should definitely have an\nincredible morning routine but if you\nhave time for nothing else this is the\nmost important thing that you should do\nevery single morning to set yourself up\nfor success\nand before i dive into it i want to tell\nyou this as soon as you wake up in the\nmorning your brain is in an extremely\nbeautiful spot\nso there's different wavelengths that\nyour brain can be at there's gamma\nthere's alpha there's beta there's delta\nthere's theta now out of those the most\nimportant one that we're going to be\ntalking about is theta now from zero to\nseven years old is when you're a child\nto seven years old\nthe majority of the time your brain is\nin something called theta state which is\nbasically like hypnosis when you get\nhypnotized your brain goes into theta\nstate that's why children can learn so\nquickly is because their brain is at a\nvery important state of their life\nthey're just seeing things happen and\nthey're learning and they're seeing\nthings happening and they're learning\nand they're just it's going straight in\ntheir head it's going straight in their\nheads going straight in their head\nwith basically no filter and so that's\nwhy they can learn so quickly\ntheta state when you wake up in the\nmorning you're in theta state now as you\ncontinue to go about your day you start\nto go up in levels and you come out of\ntheta state but theta state is the most\nimportant time to reprogram who you are\nreprogram your beliefs your brain your\nthoughts your patterns your habits your\ntraits that you have and so that's what\nwe're going to talk about is how to\nreprogram a little bit the way that you\nand to set yourself up from the very\nbeginning of your morning to change the\nway that you feel throughout the entire\nday\ni want you to do this before you have\ncoffee i want you to do this before you\nlook at your phone and i want you to\ntake\nfive or ten minutes to do this you can\nif you could take longer please do but\ntake five or ten minutes to do this\nplease please please don't look at your\nphone as soon as you wake up in the\nmorning that immediately takes you out\nof theta state and gets you into more of\na heightened state\nplease don't have your coffee first\nthing in the morning wait a little while\nuntil after you get this done\nyou're in a beautiful theta state and we\nwant to make sure that we take advantage\nof that and um here's what i'm going to\nteach you i'm going to teach you a very\nvery simple\ngratitude meditation and before i teach\nit to you there's two different states\nthat your body can be in your your\nnervous system so there's something\ncalled a sympathetic your sympathetic\nnervous system and there's something\ncalled your parasympathetic nervous\nsystem these are going to be very\nimportant so that you can understand why\nthis meditation works so well so your\nsympathetic nervous system prepares your\nbody for physical activity that is more\nof a heightened stressful state it\nincreases your heart rate and it's\nbasically known as fight or flight that\nis your sympathetic nervous system when\nit clicks on\nyour parasympathetic nervous system is\nthe exact opposite of that it is uh it\nrelaxes your body and it slows your\nheart rate\nnow why is this important because what\nwe're going to try to do with this\nmeditation this gratitude meditation is\nto set you off on the right foot by\nturning on and keeping on your\nparasympathetic nervous system as long\nas we possibly can and once again it's\nthrough a very very simple gratitude\nmeditation it's to help you change your\nthoughts to help you change your focus\nto help you change your feelings and to\nhelp you change your perception of the\nworld and i learned a very simple\nmeditation when i did my 10-day silent\nmeditation retreat it's called vapasana\n10 days silence you can't\ntalk you can't journal you can't read\nyou can't look people in the eyes it's\nliterally either you meditate or you\ntake a nap that's basically all you can\ndo for 10 days straight and\nthere's two things that you have to know\nabout meditation because most people\nreally resent meditation because they\ndon't feel like they're doing it right\nthey don't feel like they're getting\nsomething out of it and there's two\nthings you need to know about meditation\nbefore you dive into it the first thing\njust have no expectations\none of the worst things you could do\nprobably the worst thing that you can do\nis to have some sort of expectation of\nwhat you need to\nget out of your meditation you know you\nneed to feel like you left your\nmeditations or western minds of like if\ni'm gonna do something i need to feel\nlike i got something out of it i need to\nsee results right away in order for me\nto go back and do it again\nit's not really the way it works so you\njust really have to release all\nexpectations if you sit there and you\nfeel exactly the same after hey at least\nyou did it have no expectations is\nnumber one the second thing is there is\nno right or wrong way to meditate all\nyou have to do is this okay you find a\ncomfortable position\nwhatever it is it could be sitting it\ncould be laying down it could be sitting\nin a chair it could be legs crossed\nwhatever it is you find the most\ncomfortable position that you can\nwithout\nyou know feeling so comfortable that\nyou're going to fall asleep\nand as soon as you find that position\nyou do not move\nat all not even a muscle if you get a\nlittle itch on the inside of your nose\nyou can't touch it\nyou can't do anything you have to stay\nas still as possible once you find that\ncomfortable position you are now a\nstatue\nand the way that you start your\nmeditation the simple way to start your\nmeditation is just with six deep breaths\nand what i'm going to take you through\nis a meditation that i made up you know\nthey taught us how to observe our breath\nwhich i'll talk about\nbut it's just super simple you take six\ndeep breaths in through the nose\nyou hold for four seconds after you\ninhale and you exhale so it's just\nsomething like this ready inhale\nhold\nexhale and you do that four times hey if\nyou're enjoying this video do me a favor\nand hit that like button down below it\nhelps with the youtube algorithm so that\nmore people can see this message because\nit helps us get it out organically so\nhit that like button and i appreciate\nyou\nthe goal of it just so you know\nis to have your exhale be longer than\nyour inhale so you do that six times and\nthis right here there was a japanese\nstudy that found out that six deep\nbreaths six deep conscious breaths can\ncompletely change somebody's state from\na heightened sympathetic state in your\nnervous system to turning on your\nparasympathetic to calming your body\ndown\nsix deep breaths not three not five not\nfour six\ndeep breaths\nconscious breaths will completely change\nyour state and then what you do after\nthat is you just sit silently for 30\nseconds a minute whichever one it is\nthat you want and you just observe your\nbody observe the feeling of your body\nall too often\nwe're focused on everything that's\nhappening outside in the external world\nand we forget about what's happening\ninternally so it's just a second to sit\nthere 30 seconds a minute to sit there\nand just observe what's happening in\nyour body\njust to feel it\nto feel the movement to feel the breath\nto feel the heartbeat to feel the the\nmovement of the digestion that you have\nall these things that we don't really\npay attention to with these amazing\nthings that are happening inside of our\nbody all of the time without us even\nhaving it having to think about it at\nall\nand you observe the feeling for me what\ni like to do is i like to observe\nthe buzzing inside of my body you\nobserve the energy that's inside of your\nbody and you just feel\nwhat it's like\nand the reason why i do this is because\njust so you know you are 99.9999\nenergy\nnothing empty space you are point zero\nzero zero zero one percent physical\nmatter\nnow you might go that makes no sense to\nme because when i look in the mirror i\nclearly see my body and yes you do but\nyou have to realize what you're actually\nseeing\nis\nyou know if you go if you take in you\nlook at your zoom in and zoom in and\nzoom in and zoom in and zoom in through\na microscope\nyou're made up of atoms and atoms are\n99.9999\nnothing one of the things that's really\ncrazy is uh my girlfriend and i went and\nwe got this\nthis scan of our bodies where it scans\nyour whole body tells you your body fat\ntells you everything\nand it tells us how much our bones weigh\nand i'm almost 200 pounds as a guy my\nphysical body is almost 200 pounds my\nbones themselves only weigh seven pounds\ni was like what the hell that's crazy\n200 pounds of 7 pounds so that's 3.5\npercent of me right there but if you\nwere to zoom in if i were to be put into\nashes you were to zoom in it would be\nnothing nothing nothing nothing nothing\n0.01 physical matter pretty crazy isn't\nit when you really stop and you think\nabout it\nyou realize that you are mostly nothing\nso what i do is i focus and just observe\nmy body observe the energy the piranha\nis what the yogis always call it the\npiranha that's inside\nand then what i do is this\ni think about gratitude and i try to\nfill myself up with the feelings of\ngratitude what does it feel like to be\ngrateful\nin this moment\nfor\njust life i don't allow myself to be i\ndon't i don't think about being grateful\nfor anything not for anyone\nnot for any money not for any\nstruggles not for any growth not for any\ni don't try to find something to be\ngrateful for\ni simply try to be grateful for this\nexistence for the opportunity to live\nthis life because\nit's beautiful it's amazing and so i try\nto focus on just the beautiful little\naspect of being here and simply existing\nso it's not something outside of me that\ni'm looking for to be grateful i am\nsimply feeling grateful just for being\nhere and i try to fill myself up with\ngratitude and if you focus on this\nfeeling and just trying to feel the body\nand then fill it up with gratitude\nthere's a pretty good chance you might\ncry out of happiness i've done it quite\na few times or i just cry for no reason\ni'm like this is beautiful this life is\namazing\neverything is amazing\njust being here simply existing\nwaking up today is just a gift and you\nfill yourself up with this everything\nthat you possibly can\nand then what do you do\nthen after you go through that you start\nfocusing on the things that are outside\nof you you start focusing on things that\nare outside of you your body\neverything that you have\nthe people around you the struggles the\ngifts the lessons\nthen you can start focusing on the\noutside because really the world starts\nfrom the inside and then goes to the\noutside so the problem is we mostly\nfocus on the outside and try to change\nthe inside let's try to change the\ninside first and then go to the outside\nso you focus on what you're grateful for\nafter so you just sit there and you're\ngrateful and grateful and grateful just\nfor simply existing\nand then you can think about the things\nthat you're grateful for\nright\nthen you think about things outside of\nyou this could literally be done\nin two minutes if you really wanted to\nif you have\nyou know a stressful day at work and\nyou're like oh my gosh i gotta meditate\nyou can literally sit there take those\nsix deep conscious breaths and then just\ngo\ni'm gonna fill myself up with gratitude\nand you just try to fill yourself up you\ntake a big deep breath you let it go you\nrelease it and boom\nyou've now switched yourself from\nfight-or-flight mode from sympathetic\nnervous system to parasympathetic\nnervous system\nit stops the release of cortisol it gets\nthe cortisol out of your body and\ncortisol is one of the main reasons why\nthere's so many heart issues and heart\nattacks right now is because cortisol is\nwhat is you know considered the stress\nhormone there's so much stress nowadays\nand the cortisol stays inside of\nsomebody's body and it literally eats\nthem up from the inside it is it is\nlinked to premature death into heart\nattacks so when you sit there and you go\nman i'm really stressed out today or\ni've got a lot of my mind i can't think\nclearly whatever it is if you just take\na minute and then just consciously take\nsix deep breaths and then fill yourself\nup with gratitude just simply for\nexisting\nand then breathe it all out you'll\nrealize that you're in a completely\ndifferent state than you were and what\nyou do is you do this every single\nmorning\nand then you can go about your day then\nyou can have your coffee then you can\nlook at your phone\nbut most importantly what it does is it\nshifts your focus straight in the\nmorning because most of the time people\nwake up they immediately go to their\nphone and their their phone and go and\nthey're\nthey're off to the races think about all\nthe stuff they have to do the problems\nthat they have the fires that they have\nto put out they think about all of those\nthings that's not what's important in\nlife what's important in life is this\nthe body\nus our existence\ntake care of yourself fill up your own\ncup first before you go fill someone\nelse's cup if you want to add some other\nstuff to your morning routine add it\nbeautiful do as much you can to try to\nimprove yourself but first thing in the\nmorning that you need to do is fill up\nyour own cup take care of yourself fill\nyourself up with this gratitude six deep\nbreaths think about what you're grateful\nfor there's the fact that you're alive\njust life then you can think about all\nthe other things that are outside of you\nthat are beautiful\nand if you do this\nfor 30 days in a row i challenge you to\ndo do this for three days in a row\nyou'll realize that this simple\ngratitude meditation is rewiring your\nbrain to be\nhappy\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well i'm\nnot what i think i am\ni'm not what you think i am i am what i\nthink that you think that i am"
