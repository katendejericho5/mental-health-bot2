    "transcript": "writing articles making youtube videos\ncoaching people shopify for episodes\nas i said there's a million ways to make\na million dollars\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to make money online and i'm gonna\npreface it by saying this i have nothing\nto sell you normally if you hear people\ntalking on podcasts or on youtube videos\nor on facebook about how to make money\nonline they usually have something to\nsell you i'm just gonna warn you with\nthat i have nothing to sell you i just\nwant to if you know anything about me i\nhate that people are stuck in the rat\nrace and i hate that people are wasting\ntheir lives at a job that they hate so\nif they can break out of that rat race\nand make money through some other for\nform whether that's online or whether\nit's doing something else as long as\nit's something that they love to do\ni am a massive proponent of breaking as\nmany people free from that rat race as i\npossibly can and so i remember years ago\nprobably\ni probably started on the journey of\ntrying to figure out how to make money\nonline about six maybe seven years ago\nactually probably eight years ago\nactually about eight years ago 2012 i uh\nquit my job and i went and backpacked\neurope for for three months by myself\nand at that point in time i thought to\nmyself there's got to be ways to make\nmoney online so i started researching it\nkind of getting into it but i never\nactually really figured it out and so i\ntried to make money different ways and\ntry to make money differently try to\ngive make money different ways and so i\nwanted to make this episode so that we\ncan talk about how there are different\nways to make money online as i always\nsay to people there's a million ways to\nmake a million dollars uh people always\nthink there's these limited ways to make\na million dollars to become successful\nor even to be able to just make six\nfigures people think there's only a few\nways to do it there's millions and\nmillions and millions of ways so i'm not\ngoing to give you a direct answer of\nlike this is exactly how you make money\nbut i'm going to give you a ton of\nsuggestions because i've been in this\nspace for you know about five years now\nand i've seen\nmany many many ways to make money online\nand so i want to kind of crack your mind\nopen\nand allow you to take some notes and\nallow you to go man i want to research\nthis i want to google that\nbecause ultimately\nif you start to figure out what it is\nthat you want to do\nand uh and that starts to get you a\ncouple dollars online five dollars 20\n100 000 a month\nthen you're going to start diving deeper\ninto it and deeper into it and as you\nget better at something you make more\nmoney at it and eventually you could\nprobably replace your income with your\nsalary or you know day job that you have\nnow\nso\nthe problem\nthat most people have and why it's so\nhard for people to make money online is\nbecause the majority of us were raised\nby people who don't make money online\nright like my mom was a\nrealtor\nshe drove trucks she did a bunch of\ndifferent things to make money and so i\nalways have this parent had this\nparadigm of you know you got to go into\nwork to make money and when you have\nthat paradigm it makes it really hard to\nbreak out of that to go i'm going to\nmake money online i'm going to figure\nout different ways to make money online\nbecause the internet really wasn't a\nthing i'd even have a computer until\nwhere i was probably 14 years old right\nso\nwhen you look at that you realize that i\nwas raised under an umbrella of you've\ngot to go to work to make money\nalso a part of that means that\ntime equals money the if i want to make\nmore money i'm going to have to put more\ntime in and what you tend to realize is\nat the beginning of starting a business\nonline that is true\nuh but as you get better and better and\nbetter it's actually less time and more\nmoney which for most people especially\nme my paradigm was like i have to work\ni've got to go put in work and work and\nwork i'm a recovering uh work addictive\nperson like i was addicted to working i\nused to work 110 hours a week when i was\n21 years old when i ran my first office\nwith a marketing company so\nso you have to realize the first part of\nbreaking through and making money online\nis getting past the paradigm of is it\neven possible\ngetting past the paradigm of in order\nfor me to make more money i have to work\nmore because a lot of people really hold\nthemselves back from making more money\nbecause they've got a family and they if\nthey equate\nif i'm going to make more money it's\ngoing to require more time they'll never\nwork harder and start that business\nbecause they think it's going to take\ntime away from their family and so\nthat's the first thing the second thing\ni want to tell you is this is that we\nare raised in a school system that is\ndesigned to create workers really it's\nnot designed to create entrepreneurs or\nto create scientists or to create\npeople who think outside of the box it's\nvery much\ndesigned you do what you're supposed to\ndo you sit inside of this box for the\nallotted amount of time when the bell\ngoes off then you can ring if you want\nto talk you've got to raise your hand if\nyou want to go out and go to the\nbathroom you've got to raise your hand\nthere's one person that's in control of\nthe entire room and you have to listen\nto them they're the one that's in charge\nand so it's really designed to create\nfactory workers and then what happened\nis then we started creating universities\nand then we what happened was the the\nnext thing is you've got to go to school\nright like if you don't go to in america\npeople always say like if you don't go\nto school like what are you doing if you\ndon't go to college what the hell are\nyou doing like i am a college dropout\nright so at the point of time when i\ndropped out people like what the hell\nare you doing that doesn't make any\nsense you've got to be successful you've\ngot to go and go to college and the only\nreason why you go to college is to what\nnot to be an entrepreneur is to get a\njob\nand so we're raised in this paradigm by\nour parents because usually just by our\nparents that's the way that they were\nraised because their parents had to go\nto work so we're raised that number one\nwe have to go to work we're raised\nnumber two that we have to go and get an\neducation so we're raised by our parents\nand our education system to be workers\nmost of the time\nso\nlet's dive into the different ways to\nmake money online because i want to dive\ninto that first because what really\nholds people back from making money\nonline\nis literally the fact that they don't\neven believe it's possible because of\nthe way that they're raised by their\nparents and also the way that they were\neducated so\nlet me talk about all the different ways\nthat i've met people and friends that i\nhave and how they make money online\nas i said there's a million ways to make\na million dollars i have front friends\nthat run facebook ads so literally they\njust specialize i have friends that make\nmillions of dollars\njust specializing on running facebook\nads for other people and other\nbusinesses their only job is just to\nmaster facebook ads i have a friend that\nliterally makes about 17 million dollars\na year just running other people's\nfacebook ads\nthis is a real thing another way that\nyou can make money online writing\narticles for people there's a lot of\npeople that hate writing myself included\npeople will pay other people to be\nfreelance writers for them another way\nto make money online making youtube\nvideos now the thing i'm going to say is\nthis is you're not going to make a ton\nof money with youtube videos until you\nactually grow a following but one of the\nguys that i follow on youtube he\nliterally shows you how much he makes\nand he's got about 2.3 million people\nthat follow him right now he makes about\nthree to four hundred thousand dollars a\nmonth\njust off of the ads on his youtube and\nhe teaches finance to people he teaches\nhow to save more money teach about\ncredit cards teachers about housing all\nof those things\ndo you have any specialty in that well\nguess what if you were to really get\nfocused on it you could possibly make\nmoney teaching people that\nyou can make money coaching consulting\ni'm sure you have some form of a\nspecialty you can make money coaching\npeople online whatever your actual\nspecialty is you can make money setting\nup a shopify store so you can set up a\nshopify website to sell products whether\nyour products or somebody else's\nproducts you can be a third party person\nthen you can make a bunch of money doing\nit that way you can set up an etsy store\nif you want to you could set up both of\nthem if you want etsy if you create\nthings by hand if you make jewelry if\nyou do bracelets if you do i mean\nanything creative painting you can sell\non etsy how else can you make money\nfacebook ad revenue if you put videos up\non facebook you know if you're putting\nvideos up on youtube number one\nyou're going to get paid off of that ad\nrevenue you could also take those videos\nand put up on facebook if videos go\nviral what happens is facebook will\nplace ads inside of your videos and then\npay you\n55 of how much that entire thing\ngenerates i have friends that make\nmillions and millions of dollars just by\nputting videos up on facebook yes this\nis a real thing millions of dollars off\nof putting videos up on facebook i know\none person makes over a million dollars\na month\nby creating viral videos and putting\nthem up on facebook\nyou can also do sponsorships if you grow\na following if you grow a social media\nphone you've heard of influencers if you\nhave an instagram following a facebook\nfollowing a youtube following companies\nwill pay to sponsor you if you have a\npodcast with a good amount of listeners\npeople will pay to have you talk about\ntheir company right you could start a\nclothing brand and you could sell you\nknow certain funny shirts if you want to\nand put that up on shopify and sell them\nthrough facebook ads or put them up on\netsy you could teach uh people any\nany specialty that you have you could\nsell courses like i literally if you\ni've i've met people that sell courses\nof so many different random things you\ncould possibly think of how to get\nbetter doing jump ropes how to get\nbetter at uh the weirdest one that i've\never found was a guy that played\nuh i met him at a networking event and\nhe played a really rare\num\nit was like a french\nflute or something like that i don't\neven know what it was but he played a\nreally rare one and he literally taught\npeople he was one of the best in the\nworld at this instrument and he had this\nreally small but hardcore following and\nhe taught them how to play\nthis flute or this trombone or whatever\nthe hell it was i never even actually\nsaw it he just explained it to me and he\nmade a few thousand dollars a month just\nteaching that to his small following\nthat he had right so there's ways to\nmake money that way\nyou could do affiliate marketing\naffiliate marketing means you sell other\npeople's products so whether you get\nreally good at facebook ads and you\nstart selling other people's products or\nyou happen to grow your own following\nand you start putting more eyes onto\nother people's stuff so you could do\naffiliate marketing you could do\npodcasting\nyou could write other people's emails\nthere's a lot of i have friends that\nmake tons and tons of money as\ncopywriters they get really good at how\nto sell through the written word and\nthen they actually do copywriting on\nwebsites for people and they also do\ncopywriting through emails from people\nand then they get a percentage of every\nsingle sale that comes in you can get\nreally good at copywriting if you want\nto um there's friends that i have to\nmake millions of dollars selling\nsupplements that's actually i know a lot\nof people that make\ni don't know probably about 10 people\nthat make\na few million dollars a year just\nselling supplements online uh like i\nsaid

that\nthing is hey if you're liking this video\nmake sure that you give it a thumbs up\ndown below hit that like button so that\nit spikes youtube algorithm and more\npeople can see videos like this\nthere's literally a million ways to make\na million like i could talk all day long\nof all these different people one of the\nvery first people the very first\nnetworking event that i went to um that\nwas around what they call internet\nmarketing making money on the internet i\nmet a guy who was one of the shyest\npeople i've ever met\nand he was running facebook ads and he\nwas telling me what he does and he\nwasn't looking me in the eyes he was\nvery soft-spoken\nand\nwe had a conversation he told me he died\nand he told me what he did and stuff and\ni was like oh that's cool well then\ngo and get into another conversation\nwith another person who i knew that was\nat this networking event\nand he's like oh man you were just\ntalking to you know this guy and i was\nlike yeah and he's like do you know how\nmuch money that guy makes and i was like\nno he goes he makes about a million\ndollars a month running facebook ads for\npeople\ni was like i'm sorry he he like profits\na million dollars a month or like his\nbusiness like generates a million\ndollars in revenue and then that goes\ninto product sales and all those things\nhe goes no he\nprofits\naround a million dollars every single\nmonth and this was the shyest\nperson and and i was like i'm very\ncompetitive and i was like\ndude if that guy can do it i can do it\nit's nothing against him but it's just\nmy competitive nature going well dude\nyou could do it too\nand so i started getting into it and\nresearching and i started going to as\nmany events as possible because people\nlike well how do you know these people\nthat do all of these crazy things i just\ngo to events and go to events and go to\nevents now i personally hate\ni honestly honestly hate networking i\nthink it's awkward\nbut what happened was i started\nnetworking and\nwhat i always say is there's when i go\nto a networking event there's usually\nabout 95 of the people are kind of a\nlittle bit weird they want to give their\nbusiness cards they want to talk to you\nabout things that don't really matter\nthey're trying to sell you their\nservices about five percent of people\nare really badass and those are the\npeople that you want to find and so when\ni go to a networking event my only goal\nis to find one person who i really truly\nconnect with and go get coffee with them\nthe next few days after that and see if\nwe can develop a friendship and get to\nknow each other um\nby doing that i've met people who are\nincredible and then i've gotten from\nthose people that i've met that are\nincredible they have friends that are\nincredible as well so that's how i kind\nof developed my network of people who\nare in this industry and you know people\nwho have sold 10 20 50 60 million\ndollars in products online\ni have friends that literally their\ncompanies do over 100 million dollars\nevery single year\nand it's not me trying to brag in any\nsort of way because it's not my\ncompany's doing 100 million a year but\nit's me telling you the only way that i\nmet those people was by going to\nnetworking event a networking event a\nnetworking event there's an event here\nin austin that's called internet\nmarketing party every single month i\nwent to that every single month for\nyears um going to events right so i'm\ngoing to give you some some events that\ni recommend that you check out uh\ntrafficking conversions is a big event\nthat happens usually in february or\nmarch in san diego every single year\ntrafficking conversion is like 5 000\npeople\nand they teach you all kinds of\ndifferent ways to make money online\nso trafficking converges is great funnel\nhackers live is another one that's put\non by click funnels click funnels makes\nlanding pages um so those are the two\nthat i that i've personally been to and\nare the best that i know of and highly\nrecommend there's another one if you're\ninto social media called social media\nexaminer\nthey have an event that happens every\nsingle year i think in san diego as well\nthat you might be interested in\ngoing to webinars there's a ton and a\nton of ton of really smart people that\nhave webinars and i'm going to warn you\nwhen you go to a webinar is a pretty\ngood chance that person's going to try\nto sell you on buying a product at the\nend but i've been to hundreds and\nhundreds and hundreds of webinars just\nto see what people do just to get an\nidea get see if i can steal something\nand be like oh i really like the way\nthey said i really like this thing so i\ngo to you know events i go to networking\nevents i go to uh webinars all of these\nways to learn and what i realize is that\nsometimes when you really find what it\nis you want to do you got to spend money\nto make money like there might be a\ncourse\nof someone telling you exactly how they\ndid it and if that's what you truly want\nto do i recommend just spending the\nmoney and learning from them if they\nseem like they're legit and they seem\nlike they're they're actually doing what\nthey say they do\nor you could spend the next five years\ntrying to figure it out right so i\nalways recommend just spend the money on\nthe course and i've spent a lot of money\non courses a lot of money on mentorships\nand a lot of money usually my budget is\naround a hundred thousand dollars a year\njust on mentorship and just on my\nmasterminds that i join in networking\nevents to be around people who are\nincredible and growing their businesses\nand i know you might not be at that\npoint yet but you could go and spend a\nthousand dollars and go to a massive\nevent and connect with some really\nincredible people and start to get\nbetter from there\nwhat i will say is this is it's very\naddicting right once you make that first\ndollar online your life is different\nforever that's the important thing to\nrealize once you make that first dollar\nonline i remember my very first time\nthat i made a dollar online i'm gonna\ntell you the story to uh to kind of give\nyou some inspiration so you can think\nabout it so um when i first started this\npodcast um i\nthere was somebody that said hey listen\ndid you know that it seems like your\npeople probably read books they probably\nlisten to audiobooks if you go to\naudible.com\nyou can actually get us a link and if\npeople sign up for free for audible for\n30 day trial\namazon will actually pay you because\namazon owns audible amazon will actually\npay you 15\nfor people to sign up for free i was\nlike wow that's pretty cool and so\nwhenever i would talk about a book i\nwould say hey if you want to go ahead\nand sign up for amazon just go to this\nwebsite and it would put my link in\nthere and they would sign up for free\ncost them absolutely nothing to try it\nout for 30 days and i got paid 15\nbecause obviously amazon\nhas some sort of statistics on how many\nthe do free trials become you know how\nmuch that customer's worth to them\nso they'll pay 15 and i\nwoke up one morning i put a podcast out\nyou know whatever then i woke up one\nmorning and i had made 15 while i was\nasleep and i was like oh\nmy god i got paid while i was sleeping\nand for somebody who was raised by a\nmother who worked one two three jobs at\na time sometimes\nto\nto instead of having to go to work to\nmake money i made money when i was\nasleep and i was like what in the hell\nis this world i was addicted i was like\ni got to learn more about this i want to\nlearn more and it's crazy i think that\nwas only about four years ago and in the\npast four years after really getting\nobsessed with these things my companies\nbrought in about four or five million\ndollars in sales\nbecause i became obsessed with it but i\nwent from the paradigm of having to work\nmy tail off to make money\nto learning that you don't have to work\nyou just have to really understand and\nmaster what it is that you do\nand so if you're out there and you're\nlike you know what\ni need to figure out how to make money\nonline listen to this over and over and\nover again go through every single\nbullet point that i said all of the\ndifferent ways to make money i literally\nwrote all of them down right here\nrunning facebooks\nfacebook ads writing articles making\nyoutube videos coaching people shopify\nstores etsy stores revenue ad from\nfacebook videos sponsorships run\nclothing cor clothing brands selling\ncourses affiliate marketing podcasting\nwriting emails\nselling supplements courses on harmonica\njump rope jumping selling on amazon\nfreelance on upwork social media\nmanagement youtube writing kindle books\nconsulting freelancing how i make money\nis is i was able to build a really large\ncoaching business also a really large\nfollowing and was able to figure out how\nto build a really large coaching\nbusiness from a following so i teach\ncoaches literally how to make money\nonline so i teach fitness coaches life\ncoaches wellness coaches nutrition\ncoaches couples coaches mindset coach\nmindfulness meditation anybody that's a\ncoach i can teach them how to grow their\nbusiness online and so that's what i do\nbut you might want to do that or you\nmight do something completely different\nit doesn't matter as long as you find\nout what you want to do\nand you go hardcore into whatever that\nthing is because if you have a family\nand you have children wouldn't it be\nnice just to be able to hang out with\nthem\nmost of the day\ntake them to school do whatever it is\nyou need to do and make money doing it\nor to wake up and actually have money in\nyour bank account that is an opportunity\nthat is 100\nreal you just have to get past the\nparadigm of it not being real and then\ngo hardcore into research like i did\nfigure out what is that you want to do\ngo to as many network events you\npossibly can connect with people meet\npeople and eventually it might be two\nthree four five six seven years down the\nroad\nyou will have realized that you found\nyour own little niche of something that\nyou love and you're making more money\nyou thought possible working way less\nthan you thought possible spending more\ntime with the people that you love and\nmaybe even travel in the world which is\na cool thing as well\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well how\nmany lives have not been impacted\nbecause you haven't started yet\nhow many lives could you impact how many\npeople\nneed to hear your message"
