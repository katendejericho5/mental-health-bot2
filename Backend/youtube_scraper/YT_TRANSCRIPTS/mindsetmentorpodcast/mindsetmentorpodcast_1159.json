    "transcript": "how many lives have not been impacted\nbecause you haven't started yet\nhow many lives could you impact how many\npeople\nneed to hear your message\n[Music]\ntoday i'm going to be talking about how\nto start a successful podcast or how to\nstart a successful business from a\npodcast or from your passions period and\nthis actually marks right now you\nlistening to this marks the 800th\npodcast that i've done of the mindset\nmentor and\n800 is an insane number to think about\nbut i'm gonna take you along the journey\nof what it was like to build this\npodcast a successful podcast and also a\nsuccessful business from it and it's\nbeen about almost five years now that\ni've been on this journey and uh today\nwe just hit 35 million downloads of the\npodcast i had to go back and look\nthrough all of my numbers and and i went\nback and looked through all of my\nnumbers and i wanted to see just because\nas you know nothing starts off massive\nlike people can look at the podcast the\nbusiness or some other company and think\noh my gosh i want that success or i want\na million followers on facebook or\nwhatever it is but i'm only at 47 right\nnow that's impossible and what you have\nto realize that everybody starts at zero\neverybody starts at zero dollars\neverybody starts at zero followers\neverybody starts at zero downloads it's\nabout putting the work in and being\nconsistent in everything that you do and\nso i'm going to give you the five keys\nthat i have to building a successful\nbusiness that you love\nand that could be a podcast that could\nbe coaching that could be you know\ndoctor's office whatever it is that you\ntruly want to do and that's we're going\nto go over i went back and looked at my\nstatistics and i launched this podcast\naugust 24th of 2015\nand i had\na whopping 44 downloads that day\nand i want to share this with you\nbecause\nmost of the time people think oh if\nsomeone has a successful podcast or a\nsuccessful business it must have been\nmassive right away\nand that's just not the case\n44 downloads is what we started with\nand that was the start and i just\ndecided to keep going and the one thing\ni said to myself is just i just won't\nquit and that will help me win and i'll\ntalk about that a little bit more when i\ndive into my five keys uh in just a few\nminutes but it's crazy to think that in\nless than five years we went from 44\ndownloads in one day\nto now five years later over 35 million\ndownloads of this podcast and lots of\npeople like to keep their podcast number\nsecret like behind the wall of like oh i\ndon't know how many downloads are doing\nthey're not talking about it i don't\nthink that's i think it's ridiculous to\nto not tell somebody how much your your\npodcast is doing uh so it's crazy i\nthink that we went from 44 downloads\nfive years ago to 35 million five years\nlater and now we're averaging about 2.5\nto 3 million downloads per\nweek i'm sorry per month right now which\nmeans the next you know we did 35\nmillion the first five years we'll do at\nleast 36 million in the next 12 months\nand\ni'm going to give you my five keys of\nwhat i think really helped me build this\nto hopefully give you some inspiration\nso that you can go out and build your\nown\nso\nthe first thing is this out of my five\nkeys the number one thing that i say is\nto make sure that your business or your\npodcast or whatever it is that you truly\nwant to be doing is something that you\nlove and i mean\nlove to your core because all too often\nwhat we're actually doing is not truly\nchasing what we love what we're doing is\nwe're chasing a little bit of what we\nkind of love\nbut more than anything else we're\nchasing money that's what we're truly\ndoing is chasing money and kind of doing\nsomething that we love so you know a lot\nof times people say this seems like a\ngreat business opportunity there's\npeople making a bunch of money doing\nthis i'm gonna jump on and do it and\nthen they jump onto it and they start\nmaking money but what they realize is\nit's not something that they truly love\nso they resent the business that they've\nbuilt the last thing that you want to do\nis resent something that you're putting\n20 40 60 80 hours a week into because\nit's gonna be really hard to continue\ndoing it for me i'm absolutely obsessed\nwith personal development like in my\nfree time if i'm sitting around it's\nusually me reading a book or me going\nonto youtube and finding somebody that i\nwant to listen to or\na mentor or guru or someone else that's\nout there that's that's really\nversed in what it is that they do i just\nlove human psychology i love the brain i\nlove personal development and i love\njust coaching people and then i love\nteaching it like i love it like it is\npeople always ask like i don't do any\ndrugs i don't really drink alcohol very\nrarely maybe like a glass of wine a\nmonth i'm like no because coaching\npeople in teaching and learning the\nstuff and doing what i'm doing is my\ndrug it's like crack to me and the\nreason why is because then i get emails\nfrom people saying how much i've helped\nthem how much they've changed your life\nand when you get an email like that\nyou'll never be the same because you're\nlike oh my gosh i'm actually impacting\nsomeone else's life so the first thing\nthat i say\nis whatever that business is that you're\ngoing to be doing or whatever that\npodcast is that you're going to be doing\nit needs to be like an arm of you like\nthis podcast is my it's like my third\narm like it is a part of me it is\nliterally something that i feel is a\npart of me and\ni can't even believe that i'm 800\nepisodes in i can't believe that it's\nbeen five years but it has been one of\nthe most consistent things in my life\nover the past five years\nthree times a week every single week and\nso that's the first thing is before you\neven start\nmake sure that you're starting doing\nsomething that you absolutely love\nbecause when you to to be successful it\nrequires you to work your tail off and\nto work your tail off if you have\nsomething that you really love it\ndoesn't feel like work and so you can\nlove it work your ass off at it and when\nyou work your ass off at it you can make\na lot of money and truly that's what\nyou're what you're trying to do and\nthat's that's the thing people don't\nreally realize they're like well there's\nno money to be made in xyz\nthe thing about it is if you chase money\nyou're not going to work as hard but if\nyou chase what you love you'll work\nreally hard just because you love it and\nin turn you'll make a lot more money so\nkey number one is you have to do\nsomething that you love\nkey number two is this it's super simple\njust start\none of the things that really holds\npeople back is not even starting\nthey start thinking too much they get up\nin their heads and they think and they\nthink and they think and the beautiful\nthing is that you don't have to believe\nin yourself i always say this\nyou don't have to believe in yourself to\ntake action\nright that's a beautiful thing when i\nused to be a sales manager i had an\noffice and i trained a few thousand\nsales reps one of the things that holds\npeople back the most in sales is making\ncold calls and so you know they would\ntake their phone and they wouldn't be\nable to make as many phone calls as they\nwanted to because they were thinking too\nmuch and they're like i don't know if\npeople are going to answer i don't know\nif i believe in myself if i get a sales\nappointment i don't know if i'm gonna\nmake a sale i'm like listen it doesn't\nmatter you don't have to believe in\nyourself to literally push some numbers\non a phone and then talk to somebody on\nthe other line all you have to do is\njust push some numbers read the script\nthat's in front of you and you'll\neventually start setting up appointments\nyou don't have to believe in yourself at\nall to take any of that action\nwhat's the beautiful thing about that\nyou don't have to believe in yourself at\nall to ever take action so you just\ngotta start one of the things that\nreally holds people back is the imposter\nsyndrome who am i to start this business\nthat i love who am i to talk about this\nin my podcast you know i almost didn't\nstart this podcast\nwhich is crazy to think because tony\nrobbins\nexists i thought who in the heck would\nlisten to me when they could listen to\ntony robbins like tony robbins is like\nthe\nmindset guy he is the motivation guy he\nis the pinnacle of personal development\nwhy would somebody listen to me\nand i had the imposter syndrome kick in\nand i almost didn't start the podcast\nit's crazy to think that 35 million\nsets of ears wouldn't have listened to\nmy podcast had i not\ndone it how did i listen to that little\nvoice inside of my head how many lives\nwould not have been impacted\ni'm going to ask you this how many lives\nhave not been impacted because you\nhaven't started yet\nhow many lives could you impact how many\npeople\nneed to hear your message\nthink about that for a second\nbecause it'll it'll grow faster than you\ncould possibly imagine so you just gotta\nstart i remember before i started my\npodcast i read an article that says the\naverage podcast only lasts for seven\nepisodes because the average podcast\nhost gives up\nafter seven episodes and i thought to\nmyself oh my god that's such a low\nnumber to give up\nafter seven episodes like you really\ncan't see success after seven episodes i\nprobably had a couple thousand downloads\nmaybe at seven episodes and so i thought\nto myself if that's the case\ni'm going to double that before i ever\neven start\nso i made a deal with myself i will\nrecord 14 podcast episodes because\nthat's double before somebody quits so\nif the average one starts at seven and\nthey give up at seven i'm gonna go to 14\nand just see what happens and i recorded\n14 episodes before ever launching and i\nlaunched it and then that gave me space\nto promote and to put it up on facebook\nand put up on instagram and try to get\npeople listed to try and try and try to\nget more people listen to it which made\nmy user base grow very quickly in the\nbeginning was because i didn't have to\nworry about the recording side of it all\ni had to worry about was the promotion\nside of it and so one of the things that\nreally hit me i saw a video not too long\nago with jared leto and jared leto just\nso you know is a\nmusician won a bunch of awards a\nmusician i think his band is called 30\nseconds 30 seconds to mars or something\nlike that\nsomewhere something along those lines i\ndon't know exactly i think it's 30\nseconds to mars or 30 seconds from mars\nuh whatever it is he's won a lot of\nrewards he's a great singer he's also an\naward-winning actor as well so he's\nsucceeded at two things that's really\nhard for anybody to succeed at and i\nremember watching him he was in an\ninterview and he said one of the things\nthat he realized as a child is that most\npeople just don't start and if he just\nstarted he's already way ahead of\neverybody\nthink about that so many people\nlistening right now or watching this\nvideo want to start a podcast but won't\nif you just start you're already ahead\nof all those people\nso that's number two and that brings me\nto number three\nif you just don't stop\nyou're already ahead of everybody else\nthat gives up so most people don't start\nand most people who do start give up\nwhich means that if you just don't give\nup\nyou'll be light years ahead of everybody\nelse\nright it took about three years for my\npodcast to really see success three\nyears of work and work and work if you\ndo the math three years that's what 450\nepisodes before my podcast like really\nexploded so three years of work and work\nand work and work and work and it was\ndoing pretty well and then something\nhappened where it just exploded and i\nwas like this is a freaking rocket ship\nthat that i'm just trying to hold on to\nbut it wasn't right away it took three\nyears to get there\nso what if i told you that you could\nhave the business of your dreams and\nmake the money of your dreams and the\nsuccess of your dreams but you got to\nput three years of hard work before you\never see it would you do it would it be\nworth it to you\nbecause usually that's about how long it\ntakes for someone to really start to see\nsuccess three four five years\nbut if you put in the work the success\nwill eventually come and so just as\njared leto says most people don't start\ni'm gonna go ahead and finish that\nsentence and that phrase and say most\npeople give up that do start so if you\njust start and you just don't give up\nyou are light years ahead of everybody\nelse in the world\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nso that's number three just don't stop\nman just do it just go out do it every\nsingle day show up like i can tell you\nthis for the past five years i have not\nmissed a monday wednesday or friday\nepisode in five years i was just like\ni'm gonna be consistent i'm gonna be\nconsistent i'm gonna be consistent\nthere's days where literally my podcast\ni've uploaded it and it didn't pop up\nlike for some reason there was there's a\nproblem with the system and it didn't go\nout i got emails at like 8 30 9 o'clock\nfrom people who listen to my podcast\nthat i've never spoken to before like\nhey rob are you okay the podcast didn't\ncome out because people were expecting\nit and it held me accountable to holy\ncrap people are expecting this i've got\nto put this out\nso you just don't stop once you start\nokay step number four is you've got to\nbe authentic you've got to be truly\nyourself who you are you've got to be\nyourself\none of the things that i see with a lot\nof people is they have like their their\nnormal personality and then they have\ntheir\nbusiness or\npodcast personality or their facebook\nvideos personality you can't do that\nyou've got to be the same person because\nbeing fake even if it's just a little\nbit fake gets very tiresome after a\nwhile where you just get tired of\nplaying this role this character that's\nnot truly you and one of the things that\ni always hear from people like if\nsomebody listens to my podcast and then\nthey go into one of my coaching programs\nand they work with me for a while\nthey're like you're literally the same\nperson in your podcast as you are on\nyour your zoom calls and you are on your\ncoaching calls all that stuff and i'm\nlike yeah because i want to show up and\nbe the same person every single every\nsingle\ntime like if you hang out with me on the\nweekend if you listen to me on my\npodcast if you see my viral facebook\nvideos if you talk to me on a zoom call\ni'm the same person but you'd be really\nreally surprised to learn that a lot of\npeople are not\na lot of people that you might see that\nhave podcasts they put on a face they\nact like they're somebody else you've\ngot to be truly authentic to who you are\nand what i mean by that is not just who\nyou are but how you speak like if you if\nyou speak normal and then you go out and\nyou have to you have to get on your\npodcast and you have to speak eloquently\nand use big words that make people feel\nlike they're not understanding what\nyou're saying you're gonna people are\nnot gonna be attracted to that if you\ncuss cuts be yourself be who you are\nright i've had to realize and i went\nthrough this process of really realizing\nthis myself\nis that\ni\nlove to cuss like i just love to i think\nit's i just think it's a great way to\nto put emphasis on certain things right\nand for a long time i didn't cuss this\npodcast and the reason was because i\nwould get a few emails and say hey you\nknow i love your podcast my kids and i\nlisten to it on the way to school you\nknow they love your podcast they always\ntalk about listening to rob dial on the\nway\ni was like man i don't know if i want to\ncuss then if kids are because they're\ngoing to be listening to it and then i\nrealized i had done about 400 episodes\nand if somebody doesn't want to hear me\ncussing they can listen to my first 400\nepisodes if somebody wants to just\nlisten to me and they don't want to be\noffended by words which are just sounds\ncoming out of my face there's no reason\nto ever be offended by a word that's\njust part of your programming\nbut that's a whole other episode i've\nalready covered that in past episodes of\nyou know how you're programmed to think\nthat a word is bad when it's just a\nsound coming out of your face\nbut i love to cuss so i truly want to be\nauthentic and give you everything every\npart of me because if i love to cuss and\ni'm not cussing i'm not giving you me\ni'm not giving you all of me and so i\nwant you to to be truly authentic in if\nit's a podcast if it's a business if\nit's growing a following on facebook be\nwho you are because there's something\nsome receptor that's deep in someone's\nbrain it's like a sixth sense where if\nyou're being a little bit fake they're\nnot attracted to what you're putting out\nso if you're trying to build a following\nif you're trying to build a business if\nyou're trying to build a podcast\nwhatever it is and you don't feel like\nyou're truly being authentic to who you\nare\npeople are not gonna get attracted to it\nand you're gonna be like why are people\nnot listening to me why are people not\ncontinuing to come back why is my\nmessage not getting out there it's\nbecause people can\nthey can sniff the inauthenticity you've\ngot to be you you've got to be yourself\nyou've got to be authentic to who you\ntruly are\nand then the fifth tip that i can give\nyou for starting a successful business\nsuccessful podcast growing a successful\nfollowing is to connect with your tribe\nthis is a huge thing that i see that\npeople really mess up on they grow a\nfacebook following for instance and then\nthey never talk to the people who follow\nthem they start a\npodcast and they never talk to people\nwho follow them they start a business\nand they never talk to the people who\ngrow who have bought products from them\none of the things that i did about 30\nepisodes in was i opened up my calendar\nit was literally here's my calendar link\ni made the announcement and said let's\njust talk and i started getting on the\nphone with people and hearing who i was\ntalking to and what they were struggling\nwith and i talked to like 80 people it\nwas literally two weeks straight of\nphone calls talked like 80 people and it\ngave me\na much deeper understanding of who my\nfollowing is\nwhat they're dealing with how i can help\nthem and i think that that was a massive\nstep for me of helping take this to\nanother level was because i deeply\nunderstood them it wasn't me thinking\nthat i understood them even though i\nnever met them it was me having real\nconversations with them and getting to\nknow who they are what their struggles\nwith how many kids they have what their\nfamily is like how they were raised\nwhich allowed me to be able to create\ncontent that they would that i knew\nwould connect with them so if you're\ntrying to start a podcast\ntalk with your people if you're trying\nto start a following talk with even if\nthree people follow you ask them if they\nwant to hop on a phone and just chat or\nif you have a business how often do you\nyou know if you have a a shopify store\nand you're you're drop shipping stuff to\npeople's houses how often are you\nhopping on the phone with them and just\nhaving a conversation to see how you can\nprovide more value\nright there's so many businesses that\ndon't do this they don't connect with\ntheir people\nso that would be number five is connect\nthe people and uh hell i'm gonna give\nyou a number six\njust popped up in my head because i feel\nlike i truly want to\nand this is it is to be obsessed with\ngiving more value than anybody else in\nthe marketplace be obsessed with giving\nmore value than anybody else in the\nmarketplace be obsessed with giving\nvalue\neverybody wants to make money money's\ngreat you can make a lot of money that's\nfine but do you want to hear a secret to\nmaking a lot of money\ngive a lot of value money is just a\nbyproduct of the value that you give the\nworld let me say that again money is\njust a byproduct of the value that you\ngive the world if you go out there and\ngive more value than anybody else that's\nout there\nyou're gonna win\nyou always will and that's the thing\nthat i've always told myself people are\nalways like why do you make so many\npodcasts why do you make so many videos\nwhy do you put up so you know 12 posts a\nday on facebook and three posts a day on\ninstagram and why do you make so many\nvideos and he makes like because i want\nto win at the value game i want someone\nto go rob cares more than anybody else\nthat i follow and\ni really truly feel like i do like i\nwant to impact whether somebody ever\nbuys any product for me later on down\nthe road doesn't matter to me but if\nsomebody listens to my podcast they\nwatch my youtube or they watch my\nfacebook or they watch my instagram if\ni've given them some value i've to help\nchange their life in some sort of way\nmaybe they're having a crappy day they\nget onto their instagram they see my\ninstagram post i have a video about xyz\nand that video about xyz helps them feel\nbetter and then they go into their\noffice and because the fact that they're\nin a better mood they treat people\nbetter and then everybody else around\nthem treats everybody else better and\nit's a ripple effect the money doesn't\nmatter to me the money comes that's just\nthe way that it goes but for me\ndude i'm going to give more value than\nanybody else in the marketplace that's\njust what i'm going to do because that's\nwhat i truly want to do because i\nlove what i do and i truly want to\nimpact people and when i first started\nthis podcast about two months before i\nstarted it i went to a podcast event and\ni told people about it other podcasters\nwe spoke about it everybody said the\nsame thing how do you plan on monetizing\nyour podcast like how do you plan on\nmaking money off of it and i said this\nto every single person i don't care\nso many people started podcasts because\nthey found it as another way to make\nmoney so many people started podcasts\nbecause it was another form of\nadvertising for their business\nmy idea was this i'm going to be going\nto act like on facebook and facebook\nbefore they ever started any advertising\nthey grew as big as they possibly could\nbefore they tried to make any money and\ni said i'm going to be like facebook i'm\ngoing to grow my podcast to as big as i\npossibly can and give more value than\nanybody else out there and then i'll\nfigure out how to make money from it\nand so what i say is this go out there\nand give more value than anybody else\nthat's in your category and you'll win\nyou'll win every time i've never seen\nsomebody\ni'm like literally thinking i can't\nthink of any person\nthat i've seen on instagram or facebook\nor podcasting or youtube or any of those\nthings\ni've never seen somebody who is the\nnumber one creator that creates and\ngives and gives and gives and gives and\ngives and hasn't been wildly successful\nfrom it i have not seen it happen today\nand i don't think i ever will see it\nhappen and the reason why is because i\nfeel like it's just you got the good\nvibes the universe rewards you for\nhelping people and when you're out there\njust giving value giving value giving\nvalue money is going to get thrown into\nyour lap\nwhat's crazy if you do it for two three\nfour five years\nyou'll develop 10 sources of revenue\nthat come from places you never thought\nwas possible\nso\ni think it's just important to just love\non people\njust be you be true and authentic to who\nyou are and then just don't stop\nright so number one\nmake sure it's something that you love\nto do the business the podcast the thing\nthat you're talking about on instagram\nor facebook make sure it's something\nthat you love like you truly love not\nkind of love it but like i will\ndie for this message just the way that i\nfeel about it number two just freaking\nstart just do it man stop asking you\nknow ready fire aim just do it go stop\nthinking about the is my is my logo\nright is my slogan right is my music\nright all of those things can change who\ncares just freaking start already number\nthree don't stop\nmost people don't start and most people\nwho start stop just don't stop and\nyou'll win the game you'll be the only\none there that's at the end of the race\nit's a marathon\nright number four be authentic be true\nto who you are\nand number five connect with people that\nfollow you and the number six the one\nthat i wasn't even planning on talking\nabout is give more value than anybody\nelse\nand you'll win\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well how do\nyou get out of your head during this\npandemic what are the top three books\nthat you would recommend do you believe\nin aliens is the next question
