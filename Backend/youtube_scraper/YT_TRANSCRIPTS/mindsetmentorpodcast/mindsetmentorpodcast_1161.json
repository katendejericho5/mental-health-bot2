    "transcript": "it's okay to not know what your true\npurpose in life is right now but it's\nnot okay to not be in constant pursuit\nto find what that is every single day\ntoday we're going to be talking about a\nsimple question to find your purpose\ni hear this\nalmost all of the time pretty much every\nsingle day i get a message on instagram\nor facebook or through email and it has\nsomething to do with rob i don't know\nwhat my purpose is i don't know what i'm\npassionate about what should i do with\nmy life how can i find it how can i get\nout of this job that i hate and follow\nmy true passions if i don't know what my\npassions are so today that's what we're\ngoing to be diving into and uh i'm going\nto ask you the question and i want you\nto\ngo on a journey with me here and play\nalong and i want you to you know one\nthing that i always say is if i'm going\nto ask you a question i want you to\ndream and i want you to think about your\nlife act like you're four years old do\nyou remember when you were four years\nold and anything was possible in the\nworld well you grow up and then you\nstart learning what's quote unquote\nrealistic and you start you know start\nholding yourself back because of what\nyou think is realistic and what's not\nrealistic i want you to pretend like\nyou're five years old right now anything\nis possible there are no restrictions\nyou could be an astronaut you could be a\ncowboy you could be a princess whatever\nit is that you want to be and i want you\nto go along this scenario with me and i\nwant you to really truly dream and don't\nhold yourself back you ready\ni want you to pretend that you wake up\ntomorrow\nand you get a notification on your phone\nand you look on your phone you're like\nwhat the hell is this this got to be\nwrong this is my bank saying this i got\na notification from my bank i'm going to\ngo ahead and go online so you get online\nyou sign into your bank of america\naccount or whatever account that you\nhave\nand it's not wrong\nyou were just given\n500 million dollars you have 500 million\ndollars sitting in your bank account\nright now\nwhat do you do\nwhat\ndo you\ndo you have 500 million dollars you\nnever have to worry about money ever\nagain\never you don't your children's dough\nyour children's children don't you don't\nhave to worry about ever money ever\nagain so what do you do well first off\nyou're probably gonna do what most\npeople do you go buy the things that you\nalways wanted to buy first right you buy\nthe house that you've always wanted to\nbuy maybe you buy one in florida you buy\none in california you buy one that's\ndown in the caribbean maybe you buy one\nin italy you go take all the trips that\nyou want to you know you go to italy you\ngo to europe you go to thailand you go\nto australia you take your children with\nyou you buy a couple of those houses you\nfill them with all the clothes you've\nalways wanted you buy the purses and the\nshoes that you've always wanted the\nwatches that you've always wanted the\ntoys that you've always wanted you buy\nall the toys for the kids that they've\nalways wanted you buy everything for\nevery person that you've ever wanted you\nbuy your mom that new house you buy your\nmom the new car you buy everything that\nyou can you literally buy all of the\nstuff that you've always wanted right\nbecause that's what people tend to do\nbut then what you're given 500 million\ndollars let's say you spend 5 million\ndoing that you still have\n495 million dollars you've bought\neverything that your heart could\npossibly desire all of the things that\nyou thought that you wanted and then you\nget to the point where you realize\nthings do not fulfill you you don't feel\nany different and you've got all of this\ntime left on earth you're not dead yet\nso what do you do\nhow would you fill your time if you had\n495 million you have everything you've\never wanted you never have to worry\nabout money again you're safe you get\nall of the food that you've ever wanted\nall of your needs forever are taken care\nof\nafter getting all of those things\nwhat\nwould you\ndo\nhow would you fill your time\nwhat would you put your time into what\nwould you put your energy into what\nwould you put your money into\nwhat would you be putting your putting\nout in your life if you've never had to\nworry about money ever again\nsee a lot of people say this they say\nwell i would spend most of my time with\nmy family beautiful great i love that\nyou would spend most your time with your\nfamily but i'm going to tell you this\nyou would get to a point where you're\nbored right you'd still spend time with\nyour family but the one thing that i do\nknow about coaching hundreds and\nhundreds of humans is that humans have\nthe innate desire to create\nthat's one thing that i've realized\nabout humans the second thing is that\nhumans have the innate desire to give\nback to help others what lights them up\nthe most is creating stuff being\ncreative and also helping other people\nso what would you do\nfor me if i had all the money in the\nworld\ni had all the stuff i ever wanted to buy\ni'd still be doing what i'm doing right\nnow why just because this is what i love\nlike i love doing this if i made no\nmoney doing this i would still be doing\nit i would still have the camera set up\ni still have the microphone set up i\nwould still be putting this out there\ni'd still be helping people i'd still be\ncoaching people i'd still be learning\nabout person of um and the human brain\nand how the human brain works\ni'm just i'll be working hardcore on\nmyself my personal vomit on my spiritual\ndevelopment studying the human mind the\nhuman psyche recording videos and\npodcasts and writing books\ndoing events in person i'd be doing what\ni'm doing now\nwhy because that's what lights me up\nbut what would you be doing because\nyours might look way different than mine\nand that's beautiful that's okay\nbut what would it be\nsee nothing makes people feel better\nthan creating\nand helping other people\nso what would you do in that situation\nwould you start a business would you\nrecord videos would you start a podcast\nwould you become a coach would you start\na charity would you donate your time\nwould you go help people in different\ncountries\nfree people what would you do what is it\nthat you would do\nnow\nthe beautiful part of this question the\nreal benefit of this question is that\nnormally what most of us are doing with\nour lives\nthroughout the majority of our lives\nis in the pursuit of money\nand that right there\nyou've already got\nso you don't have to pursue money\nanymore so what would you do what would\ntruly light you up inside now i\nunderstand this is a tough question\nand i'm not expecting you to know the\nanswer right now\nbut if you journal through it and you\nstart thinking about over the next\ncouple days and think\nif i did have all the money in the world\nand i wouldn't have to go on this\npursuit of happiness or pursuit of money\nexcuse me what would i do what would i\ndo with my time because normally like i\nsaid what we do is we pursue money we\nmake choices to get money\nmaybe we start a business that we truly\naren't 100 passionate about but we know\nwe can make a lot of money do it or at\nleast make some money doing it or maybe\nwe get into a job that we truly don't\nlove and it's not what we want to be\ndoing but we did it for the money maybe\nwe went to school to get the job that\nwould pay us the amount of money that we\nwant but it's not truly what we want\nit's not truly\nour passion and the beautiful benefit of\nthis question is it cuts out all the\ncrap it cuts out all of the fillers\nit takes out the pursuit of money\nbecause you've already got it\nso now what do you do what's going to\nlight you up inside it cuts down to what\nare your true\npassions\nand that's what you truly need to figure\nout often like i said we start the\nbusiness or we get into a job just to\nmake money you ain't got to worry about\nthat anymore so what are you doing with\nyour time\nhow are you spending your energy what\nare you creating\nbelieve me you weren't born to just\nwork\nmake money pay the bills and die\nyou were born to do something more but\nhave you ever actually taken yourself\noutside of the box that you've been\nraised in and that you live in and asked\nyourself what the hell do i truly want\nwith my life\nwhat is it that lights me up inside what\nis it that makes me feel good what would\nyou do would you paint\nwould you make music\nwould you create an album\nwould you figure out what the full\nexpression of who you are\nis\nand bring that out to the world here's\nthe thing that i know\na lot of people don't do what they truly\nwant to do because they're afraid of\nbeing judged by others\none thing that i know sometimes is that\ncash is confidence and sometimes people\nhave so much confidence when they start\nmaking money that they start creating\nstuff and they don't care what anybody\nelse thinks about them and it doesn't\nhold them back anymore so if not only\nyou had all of the money in the world\nbut also you had all of the confidence\nin the world what would you do what\nwould you create how what would you put\nyour time and energy into you know if\nyou want to spend all the time in the\nworld with your children well when they\ngo to school what would you do with\nyourself you're not just going to sit\naround and play on instagram right\nyou're not going to buy any more things\nbecause you've already bought all the\nthings so what are you going to do\nand here's the thing i understand that\nthat\nin this moment right now you're not\ngoing to be able to immediately most of\nyou know what your true passion and true\npurpose is\nbut this is a start in the right\ndirection the reason why this question's\nso important as i said is because\nmajority of the time we do what we do\nin the pursuit of some money like we're\nlike kind of passionate about something\nbut we know we can make money doing it\nwe're kind of passionate we're kind of\ndipping our toes into the water what our\ntrue passion is but we're not fully\njumping in this question cuts out all of\nthe crap you've got all the money what\nwould you do you've got all the money\nand you've got all the confidence in the\nworld what would you do\nbecause if you're not doing that right\nnow once you figure out what it is\nyou're not living your life to your full\npotential you're not living your full\nexpression of yourself\nit's okay\nnot to know what your true purpose is\nright now i say this all the time and it\nreally connects with people it's okay\nnot to know what your true purpose is in\nlife right now is but it's not okay to\nnot be in constant pursuit to find out\nwhat that is every single day\nlet me say that again\nit's okay to not know what your true\npurpose in life is right now but it's\nnot okay to not be in constant pursuit\nto find what that is every single day\nbecause if you're not searching if you\ndon't know what it is and you're not\nsearching for it then what are you doing\ntoday what are you doing with your free\ntime what are you doing with your life\nand i don't mean to sound this as if i'm\ntalking down to you but what i truly\nreally mean is if you don't know what it\nis why are you not searching for it why\nare you not trying to find it because\nultimately like i said we weren't born\njust to pay the bills and die we were\nborn to do something amazing have you\nfound out what that amazing thing is\nor are you just stuck in the rat race\nand you just go to work you come home\nyou heat up some food you watch netflix\nyou go to bed you wake up and do the\nsame thing every single day what are you\ndoing\nyou were not born to just make money pay\nthe bills and die\nyou were born to thrive you were born to\ncreate something beautiful there's so\nmuch potential in you but the only\nperson that can bring it out is you\nso either you let it stay there and you\ndie with it without living up to your\nfull potential\nor\nyou figure out what it is\nrealizing you might not get it today you\nmight not get it tomorrow you might not\nget it this month you might not get it\nthis year but eventually if you keep\nthinking about it every day and every\nday and every day and trying new stuff\nand trying new stuff and trying new\nstuff that eventually you'll find it you\nwill it might take you time it might\ntake you years to find it but as long as\nyou try to find it and you eventually do\nand then go on the pursuit of that you\nwill live a fully 100 fulfilled life\nby the time that you get to the end so i\nwant you to write this down and i want\nyou to take some time and think about\nthis today\nyou wake up tomorrow\nyou're given 500 million dollars\nyou ask yourself this question\nafter i buy everything that i want\nwhat do i do with my time\nthat's it cuts out all the crap and\nallows you to figure out what you truly\nwant\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well you\nhave to live a fulfilled life even if\nyou make less\nbecause would you rather have your\nchildren be happy\nor successful"
