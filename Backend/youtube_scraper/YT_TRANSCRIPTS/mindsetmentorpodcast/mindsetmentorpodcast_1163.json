    "transcript": "97\nof the that you're worrying about means\nnothing\nso why are you focusing on it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to deal with anxiety in these\nuncertain times that we're in and i'm\nactually going to give you five keys\nthat i came up with five strategies of\nhow to get past your anxiety\nand what i want to say first before we\ndive into it is this is anxiety so you\nknow is actually not depression\ndepression is considered a chemical\nimbalance inside of your brain anxiety\ncomes from your thoughts\nmost of the time anxiety actually comes\nfrom your thoughts about the future\nwhether that's worrying about something\nthat's you know possibly going to happen\nor could possibly happen or might happen\nand uh or you know the anxiety of not\nbeing in control of the current\ncircumstances that are happening in the\nworld so you're you feel like you don't\nhave any control which is giving you\nanxiety but anxiety comes from your\nthoughts and so i'm going to give you\nthe five strategies of how to overcome\nthat and the first one the most popular\none the one that really makes the most\nsense for a lot of people is actually an\nacronym and the acronym is halt h-a-l-t\nand that stands for hungry\nangry lonely\ntired and so if you feel like you're\nvery anxious today it's really important\nto ask yourself these questions number\none am i hungry right now\nnumber two am i lonely number or number\ntwo am i angry number three am i lonely\nor number four am i tired because here's\nwhat happens\nall of these things that we're talking\nabout\nchanges the way that you think and if\nyou change the way that you think you\nchange the way that you feel and so if\nyou're hungry or maybe you've not even\nhungry but you just haven't eaten well\ntoday maybe you woke up you had a lot of\nsugar your you know your blood sugar\njumped and then just dropped right down\nand plummeted and now you feel like crap\nsome of the times that i noticed when i\nhappen to feel the most anxious\ni don't really feel anxious a whole lot\nbut sometimes when it does happen i'll\ntake myself through this and see what i\nfeel usually i forgot to eat or i\nhaven't eaten at all for that day it's\nlike two o'clock three o'clock i\ngot up started on phone calls with the\nteam started work and started recording\npodcasts all of this stuff and i\nrealized\nit's two three four o'clock sometimes\nand i forgot to eat and i'm like why do\ni feel so bad and the reason why is\nbecause my body is literally craving\nsome nutrients to make it feel better\nso that's the first thing to think about\nif you're feeling anxious\nare you hungry\nokay the next thing is this are you\nangry did something happen to make you\nfeel like you're angry\nif you're angry that's going to\nobviously that that comes from the way\nthat you think so that's going to change\nthe way that you feel so there might be\nsome sort of you know if you get angry\nwhat's going to happen those thoughts\nare going to create something\ninside of your body that's going to call\nneuropeptides neuropeptides\nof the messenger from the brain to the\nbody that body is going to then create\ncortisol it's going to create adrenaline\nand that's going to get your heart rate\nto spike\nand that alone can make you start to\nfeel anxious maybe you watch the news\nthat morning and you shouldn't have\nwatched the news or you saw something on\ninstagram that just really drove you\ncrazy or you saw something else that was\nhappening in this world that made you\nfeel like it was going to crap and\nyou're like oh my god i'm not in control\nof this it's really driving me crazy\nmaybe you're angry about current\ncircumstances next thing are you lonely\nhave you been alone for a long time one\nof the things that people look past\nbesides the fact of improving themselves\nis improving all of their relationships\nwe are beings that love to be around\nother beings if you haven't seen anybody\nin a few days maybe you haven't left\nyour house maybe you haven't gotten sun\non your skin whatever it is that\nloneliness can actually start to make\nyou feel anxious because you think oh my\ngod is it going to be like this forever\nso am i lonely\nor last one am i tired did i get a full\nnight's sleep last night\ntruthfully did i get a full night's\nsleep maybe i did\nsleep for seven and a half eight hours\nbut maybe it was just terrible sleep i\nwas up a lot i had to go to the bathroom\nthen i was coughing and you know i had\nmy allergies going crazy maybe i need a\nnap\nso that's the first thing to take\nyourself through as you're trying to\nfeel where this anxiety could be coming\nfrom hungry angry lonely tired now if\nyou happen to have multiple of those\nthe more of those that you have in your\ncurrent moment so maybe you haven't\neaten all day maybe you saw something\nthat really pissed you off on instagram\nand you know really made you mad from\nlike the second that you woke up when\nyour cortisol is actually at its highest\nand maybe you also had a you have a\ncrappy night's sleep\nthree of those out of the four you're\nmore likely to feel anxious\nand so what can you do now that you know\nhungry angry lonely tired what can you\ndo to try to fix it in this moment and\nrealize you're not going to feel like\nthis forever the way that you feel is\njust like a cloud that's just passing in\nthe sky right it will eventually pass\nthis too shall pass everything shall\npass you're not going to feel anxious\nforever but maybe now that you know\nthose are four things that can make you\nfeel anxious maybe now you can go\nthrough it and make a plan of how to not\nfeel anxious in that moment you can\nsolve your problems from there so that's\nthe first strategy is go through halt\nh-a-l-t\nsecond strategy is this\nyou're breathing\nright when we start to change our state\nwhether that's from happy or angry or\nanxious whatever it is when we start to\nchange our state the first thing to\nchange believe it or not is our\nbreathing and so if you're feeling the\nanxious feelings maybe you should check\nin on your breath check in on your\nposture you know a lot of times we're\nanxious we keel over a little bit and we\nhave\nlike real short breaths that probably\nsounded really creepy in this microphone\nbut who cares whatever it's just\ninstead of\ngreat breathing it's\nand that alone the breathing the amount\nof oxygen in your body and the amount of\ncarbon dioxide in your body will change\nyour state change the way that you feel\nand so there was a a japanese study that\nwas done to found find out how to change\nsomebody's state as quick as possible\nand they found that six\ndeep breaths alone\ncan change somebody's state from anxious\nto peaceful\nanxious to calm\nand so think about that for a second if\nyou're feeling anxious check in with\nyour chest check in with your breath\nam i sitting up straight am i breathing\ndo i need to sit and close my eyes and\njust take six really deep breaths\nbecause if you can it will change your\nstate\none way that helps is this is uh\nfour seven eight so that's four seconds\nin breathe in for four seconds\nhold for seven seconds\nand breathe out for eight seconds so\nit's gonna look like this you breathe in\nhold\nbreathe out\nif you do that alone four in\nseven hold eight out\nsix times your state will change\ncompletely almost every single time\nunless there's like something really\nhitting the fan in your life\nbreathing will change your anxiety\nchange your state faster than almost\nanything else that will\nand it'll help all the time it doesn't\nhelp just when you're anxious like\nsometimes i notice that i'm just in full\nhardcore work mode all day long and i'm\nlike man my brain is all over like i\nneed to just\ncalm down for a second and i'll force\nmyself to sit there it takes literally a\nminute\ntwo minutes at most to just sit there\nand take six deep breaths and what i\nrealize is by like breath four i can see\nfeel myself chill out and then by breath\nfive and six i'm like what number am i\non i always seem to forget because i\nbecome so relaxed in those moments so\nthat's a huge thing so check in with\nyour breathing that's step number two\nstrategy number three\nis anxiety i actually did an entire\npodcast episode on this so you can go\nback and listen to that podcast but\nanxiety and excitement are the same in\nthe human body the only thing that\nchanges them is your thoughts around\nthem so what i mean by that is when\nyou're anxious what happens your heart\nstarts to beat faster\nyour body starts to uh create cortisol\nyour brain waves start to change it's\nthe exact same thing\nthat happens when you're excited is\ncortisol starts to go through your body\nyou happen to have your heart start\nbeating faster your breathing changes as\nwell and for a lot of people and this\nseems crazy believe me i understand that\nthis seems crazy but i can't tell you\nhow many emails i've gotten of people\nwho have tried this and been like holy\ncrap this actually works and this isn't\nsomething that i made up this isn't just\nan idea of mine this is actually studied\nby psychologists and scientists is next\ntime you feel anxious and you check in\nwith yourself maybe halt isn't working\nmaybe breathing isn't working is tell\nyourself this when you're anxious tell\nyourself i'm excited i'm excited i'm\nexcited i'm excited i'm excited you're\nactually tricking using your brain to\ntrick your body based off of the way\nthat you feel to think that you're not\nactually anxious about something that\nyou're excited i'm i understand i even\neven saying this sounds dumb in my head\ni promise you it works i can't tell you\nhow many times i've gotten emails and\ni've gotten instagram messages and all\nthis stuff it's like holy crap rob that\nthat changing anxiety to excitement\nthing actually works and it does so if\nyou're at the point where you can't\nchange it you're trying to figure out\nyou're trying to figure out you're\ntrying to figure out do it all you got\nto do is just literally sit there and\nsay i'm excited i'm excited i'm excited\ni'm excited i'm excited you will stand\nup and you will feel better about your\nsituation because you've repurposed the\nfeeling inside of your body based off of\nthe thoughts that you decided to change\nas well so that's number three change\nyour anxiety to excitement step number\nfour\nis to focus on what you can control\nhere's one of the things i notice i get\nquestions about anxiety\npretty much every single day through\nemail through instagram whatever it is\nand usually when someone says i'm\nanxious they're saying i'm anxious\nbecause of xyz that's happening in the\nworld or because my boyfriend left me or\nbecause of the fact my mom and dad are\ndoing this or because i see all of these\nprotests because of the fact that i see\nyou know the bad that's happening in the\nworld what tends to happen is you're not\nanxious about what you can control a lot\nof times you're anxious about what you\ncan't control\nnow here's the thing\nyou can't control it\nso what's happening is you're having a\ncontrol issue you're having a control\nproblem where you're literally having a\nbreakdown an anxious breakdown from\nthings out of your control which i get\nit i've had it before too\nbut there's nothing you can do about it\nwe've already covered that because you\njust said you can't control it right so\nwhat do you do you start focusing on\nwhat you can control so you could say oh\nmy gosh i'm worried about all of the\nterrible things that are happening in\nthe world right you're probably watching\nthe news if you're having a lot of\nanxiety\nall these terrible things that are\nhappening in the world right now i just\nfeel so bad about it i feel so anxious\nabout i don't know what to do the first\nthing to do is to go can i control those\nthings that i'm feeling anxious about\nand look at all of them and you think to\nyourself can i control them\nno i'm looking at them\ndoesn't look like i can control them\nokay what can i control i can control\nwell as rob said i can control my\nbreathing maybe i should focus on my\nbreathing i can control my thoughts\naround what's happening in the world\nmaybe i should change my thoughts i can\ncontrol what i do in this very moment\nokay well then let me change that what\nwould make me feel better right now\nwhat are things that make me happy\nmaybe going and playing with my kids\nmaybe going and going for a run or doing\na workout focus on what you can control\nbecause one thing that i find majority\nof the time when someone's having\nanxiety they're having anxious thoughts\nis they're focusing on things that are\ncompletely out of your control and if\nthey're completely out of your control\nthey will always be completely out of\nyour control there is absolutely nothing\nthat you can do about those things so\nyou can either allow those to push you\nover the edge of anxiety and make you\nfeel even worse or you can reframe what\nyou're thinking about and go you know\nwhat\nyeah those things are happening in the\nworld those things\nthey are the way that they are but\nthere's nothing that i can do at this\nmoment so what can i do i can focus on\nme i can focus on my breathing i can\nfocus on my body i can focus on going\nfor a run or doing jumping jacks or\ngoing for a workout i can change my\nstate and i can only focus i can only\nchange myself i can't change anybody\noutside of me i can't change the world\nevents i can't change any of those\nthings so why don't i focus on the\nthings that i can change the thing that\ni can change me my thoughts my body my\nreactions my breathing all of those\nthings so if you're feeling anxious\nfocus on what you can control\nand then number five\none of my favorite things to have people\nask themselves right when you're feeling\nanxious\nask yourself this one question ready\nin this moment\nam i okay\nit's that simple\nin this moment am i okay because anxiety\n99 of the time comes from things that\nare\npossibly going to happen in the future\nmaybe they'll happen in the future maybe\nthey won't happen in the future and so\nif you're focusing on what you can't\ncontrol you're focusing on things into\nthe future which aren't presently in\nthis moment\nthen you're of course you're gonna have\nanxiety so you ask yourself this one\nquestion in this moment am i okay right\nnow in this second\nbecause here's what happens people sit\nthere and they go oh you know what well\nhere's what's happening\nwhat's happening is i've got bills to\npay i might not be able to pay my bills\nnext month\nokay i get it but ask yourself in this\nmoment am i okay because here's what's\ngoing to happen your brain will go\nsquirrely you'll go okay\nin this moment am i okay i am\nbut i've got to think about my bills\ni've got to pay them yes of course you\ndo\nbut in this moment am i okay\nyes i am okay\nbut i really still need to figure out\nhow to pay these bills of course you do\nyeah no crap you do we got that but in\nthis moment and sometimes you just have\nto pull yourself back and pull yourself\nback and pull yourself back in this\nmoment am i okay and the answer to that\nis\nyes\nin this moment you have food water\nshelter clothing maybe a few people that\nlove you you've got this podcast or this\nvideo that you're watching or listening\nto if you're listening on the podcast\nyou've got what you need in this world\nyou're going to survive you're not going\nto die you're going to be okay\nin this very moment this second right\nnow am i okay\ni am\nokay well that should take some stress\naway maybe i should focus on my\nbreathing because if you come from a\nplace of calm cool collected\nyou're usually going to find the city\nyou're going to find the answers to the\nproblems that need to be solved but if\nyou're coming from a place of stressed\nout and anxious and don't know what i'm\ngoing to do it's going to be a lot\nharder to figure out what you need to do\nwhen emotion is high logic is low\nso if you are freaking out about the\nfuture\nthat's a really bad place to try to find\nsolutions for the future but if you can\nsay in this moment am i okay i am\nokay let me focus on my breathing let me\ncome from a place of calm let me try to\nlower my state maybe make sure you know\nh-a-l-t and my hungry angry lonely tired\nlet me try to solve these problems let\nme get from a better state and when i am\nin a better state my logic will be\nhigher because when emotion is high\nlogic is low so how do i get to a state\nwhere i'm calm cool collected i can look\nat my current circumstances and then i\ncan figure out how to change them for\nthe better here's the crazy thing i've\ngot statistics i want to tell you guys\njust so you know\nthe average person has about 60 000 and\nthis is from the national science\nfoundation this isn't from like you know\njoeshmo.com that just puts out some\nrandom articles the national science\nfoundation says that the average person\nhas about 60 000 thoughts per day\nout of those thousands of thoughts about\n80 of them are negative\nholy crap 80 of them are negative\n95\nwere exactly the same repetitive\nthoughts from the day\nbefore they're thinking the same\nnegative thoughts every single day\nso another interesting study from the uh\nstudy of it was actually 2005 from\ncornell university scientists found that\n85 of what people worry about never even\nactually happens\nso if you're sitting there being anxious\nand worrying about what could happen in\nyour future 85 percent of what you worry\nabout won't even happen\nsecondly 15\nof the things that did happen\n79 of the people said that 15 of the\nthings that did happen\nwere easier to handle\nthan they actually thought they would be\nso 79\nso 85 percent of things you worry about\nnever even happen\n15 of those things that do happen\n79 of the time you actually realize\nthey were easier than you expected them\nto be\nin conclusion that means that 97\nof our worries are baseless and result\nfrom unfounded pessimistic perception\n97\nof the crap that you are worrying about\nmeans nothing\nso why are you focusing on it 97 of them\neither won't happen or when it does\nhappen and won't be as bad as you think\nthat it is so how can you take yourself\nfrom the state that you're in calm\nyourself down and figure out how to get\nthrough the things that could possibly\nbe happening in the future from a state\nof peace calm cool collected in a great\nplace versus sitting there anxious not\nmaking the best decisions because when\nemotion is high logic is low so those\nare the five\nstrategies that i have for you number\none\nhalt hungry angry lonely tired number\ntwo check your breath check your\nbreathing number three change your\nanxiety to excitement by telling\nyourself that you're excited number four\nfocus on the things that you can control\nand number five ask yourself this\nquestion right now in this moment am i\nokay\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well the\nissue is not that you're over thinking\nthe issue is what you are thinking about"
