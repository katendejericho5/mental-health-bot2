    "transcript": "if you continue to eat what the media\nand news feeds you and all that\nnegativity you're going to have to deal\nwith the sickness that comes from it\ntoday i'm going to be talking about how\nthe news is brainwashing you and\nlisten i'm not talking about the news\nthat's happening right now this has\nnothing to do with just the current\nevents and what's been happening in the\nworld\nthis has to do with what the news has\nbeen for a very long time we can all\nagree that the news has been an absolute\ndumpster fire\nfor 20 30 40 years it used to be back in\nour grandparents days it used to be a\nway to be informed a way to learn about\ncurrent events\nbut i'm going to tell you right now the\nnews does not keep you informed of\nanything at this point if anything it\ndoesn't keep you informed it keeps you\nconformed conformed to stay in your\nhouse conformed to be afraid conform to\num\nto think negatively to worry about the\ncurrent state of the world and i'm going\nto talk to you about why the news is\nactually brainwashing\nyou\nin what you think\nin the the main reason why i want to\ndive into this is because people\ndon't realize\nthat everything that you see\nhear\nlisten to\nuh read\neverything that comes into your\nawareness changes the way that you feel\nthroughout every single day it changes\nthe way that you think\nand so let's start off with that basis\nreal quick every single thing that comes\ninto your awareness through something\nthat you read something that you hear\nsomething that you see\nwhatever it is\nchanges the way that you think which\nchanges the way that you feel because\nyour feelings come from your thoughts\nand so if we're talking about the news\nif you watch the news you would\ndefinitely 100 percent think that the\nworld is getting worse\nright\ni mean it seems like everything is going\ncrazy right now it seems like\neverything's going nuts but here's the\ncrazy thing about it if you watch the\nnews it's always\nseem like something is going wrong it's\nalways it seems like something was we're\njust on the edge of absolute human\ndestruction\nright it's not like it just started\nbeing this way it's not like the news\nwas amazing a few years ago and then the\npast couple months it's been like an\nabsolute just terrible\nno it's been like this for a really long\ntime it seems like the world is getting\nworse but nothing can actually be\nfurther from the truth\nand i'm going to tell you why there was\na harvard professor\nhis name is uh steven pinkler and\nstephen pinker\nactually went through and did all of the\nstatistics on\nwar and cause of death and dying of\nstarvation and dying for more and dying\nfrom everything she could possibly do\nand found that there has never been a\ntime in human history where it has been\nmore safe to be alive than right now\nnow if you think about that if you watch\nthe news it it literally seems like\nwe're going to hell in a handbasket but\nif you look at the statistics you\nrealize that this is the safest time to\nbe alive now realize i understand that\nthere's crap happening in this world\nthere's a lot of stuff happening in this\nworld there's people's opinions and\npeople are on one side then people are\non the other side and then there's\npeople that are seemed divisive where\nwe're getting getting split up and it\nseems like there's protests and things\nlike there's always stuff that's\nhappening it seems like it's getting\nworse but it's never been a better time\nto be alive as a human now if you look\nat it as just like a small microcosm you\ncan look at one thing and be like oh my\ngod it's so bad right now but if you\nlook across the entire board across the\nentire world there's never been a better\ntime to be alive as a human so then it\nreally makes you ask yourself if it's\nnever been so\nsafe when i watch the news it's so\nnegative why is the news so negative so\nlet's go ahead and talk about right now\nwhy the news is so negative why does the\nnews focus on negative news instead of\nfocusing on\npositive news why does it focus so much\non negative news when there is amazing\nthings that are always happening every\nsingle day and here's what you have to\nrealize the the new stations understand\nthe way the human brain works now if we\ntake a step back from the news station\nand just look at them a news station is\na business and business has to have\nrevenue come in how does the news make\nits revenue the news makes its revenue\nthrough everybody with me now\nadvertising dollars so the more people\nthat are watching the news the more\nrevenue aka the more advertising dollars\nthat are coming in so the news is not\ngoing to just put up positive stuff the\nnews is going to put up stuff that it\nknows that you're going to have a hard\ntime looking away from\nand then human brain naturally goes a\nlittle bit negative let me explain to\nyou why the human brain goes a little\nbit negative\nlet's say you know your brain really\nhasn't changed that much over the past\n20 30 40 50 100 000 years it's\ndefinitely changed but it hasn't changed\nnear enough as much as technology has\nchanged in the past hundred thousand\nyears so let's say a hundred thousand\nyears ago you and your friend\nyou know john let's say your friend's\nname is john 100 000 years ago you know\nyou're walking down a path and you know\nyou're wearing a little loin cloth and\nyou know you're walking down you're\ngoing to go to the lake because you guys\nneed to go get some water for your tribe\nand you're walking and john goes and he\nsees some berries he's a little bit\nhungry maybe you're not hungry at this\ntime so john goes and picks some\nblackberries you know maybe they're not\nspecifically black bears but they're a\nblackberry he picks it throws his mouth\npicks another one throws in his mouth\nkeeps on walking down the path\nthen you get to the lake and john keels\nover and dies\nyou want to remember\nthose blackberries that he had\nthe reason why is because you want to\nstay away from them you want to stay\naway from anything that's going to make\nyou die\nright obviously we all want to\nand so naturally your brain is going to\nthink more about the things to stay away\nfrom than it will thinking about all the\nbeautiful amazing things in life\nwhy because it kept our species alive\nlet's give another example\nlet's say you're hanging out with your\nfriend\nlet's say you're hanging out with your\nfriend harriet a hundred thousand years\nago right you and harriet you're gonna\ntake a walk down to the that uh that\nriver that you and john went down to and\nuh you're gonna walk down there because\nyou know you got some some apples you\ngotta wash some apples so harriet's over\nthere she's down at the river she's\nwashing her apples off and then boom\nshe gets struck by an alligator\nalligator pulls her she's gone she gone\nforever you'll never see harriet again\ndo you want to remember that or do you\nwant to remember the apples that you\nwere watching\nyou're going to want to remember not to\ngo back to this place because harriet\nwas killed you know hundred\nthousand-year-olds harriet uh\nharriet 100 000 years ago was killed by\nan alligator at this river\nso your brain is designed to focus on\nwhat we would call quote-unquote\nnegative things because if you can stay\naway from those if you could focus on\nthose negative things you can stay away\nfrom them if you could stay away from\nthem what do you do you live because all\nyour brain really cares about is your\nsurvival\nso that is why the human brain\nworks the way that it does\nso if i own a news station and i have a\nwhole bunch of positive news that comes\nin and a whole bunch of negative news\nand i need the humans who watch the news\nmy news station to be addicted to it\nbecause the more people that watch the\nmore revenue that comes in the more\nadvertising dollars am i going to put up\nabout how this beautiful story happened\nwhere you know this little boy saved\nthis this woman that was crossing the\nroad that was in her 80s and she fell\nover no what do i want to talk about i\nwant to talk about the homicides i want\nto talk about the murders the drive-bys\nthe unsolved mysteries the things that\nare terrible in this world because\nnaturally the same way that your brain\nwants to focus on harry getting by the\nalligators or john dying from the\nblackberries it's going to turn that\npart of your brain on that's in survival\nmode that goes i\nneed to watch this\nyou want to stay alive and so how does\nthe news do this well number one they\nput up a bunch of negative stories\nanother thing that they do\nis they do things called open loops an\nopen loop is actually a marketing\nstrategy based off of psychology and if\nyou ever watch the news they use open\nloops like crazy an open loop would be\nsomething like this let's say i'm about\nto give a talk and i want to keep\neverybody who is watching the talk\nengaged in my talk i'm going to say guys\nwhat i'm going to do is i'm going to\nteach you my five tips on how to\nyou know\nmaster your mindset\nbut before i do that what i want to talk\nto you about is\nwhat happened is i opened a loop now the\nhuman brain wants that loop closed\nnow you go i want to know these five\nfreaking strategies to master my mind\nright that's what the human brain does\nit wants to close\neverything that it can close it wants to\nclose that loop and so what does the\nnews do what do what do they do they say\nthere's been a recall on food locally in\naustin texas because 200 people have\ndied more on that in 15 minutes\never heard anything along those lines\nwhen watching the news of course you\nhave because they know if they open a\nloop what are you more likely to do\nyou're more likely to stay for another\n15 minutes because you want to see that\nloop closed because you don't want to go\nahead and get the food that's been\nrecalled accidentally eat it and die\nis this making sense to you and so the\nnews is designed to be as negative as\npossible\nand so if you're watching the news guess\nwhat you're going to think\nyou're going to think really freaking\nnegative you're going to think that\nwe're on the end of we're we're really\nclose to dying as a human we're about to\ndestroy this entire human race right\nthat's what you'd be thinking to\nyourself you'd be thinking we are\nso close\nto dying\nwe're so close like what's what's going\nto happen i don't know what's going to\nhappen i want to make sure that i watch\nthe news to make sure that i don't die\ni want to make sure that i know exactly\nwhat's going on because if i don't know\nwhat's going on maybe i'll have you know\nthis food that's going to kill me it's\ndesigned to keep you\nready\naddicted\nbecause negativity is extremely\naddictive think about this for a second\nwe all know somebody in our lives who\nwatches way too much news\nthink about that one person i'm going to\ngive you a second who is that one person\nthat watches the news way more than\neveryone else you know okay now you've\ngot that person i want you to think of\nthis question i want you to answer it\nwould you say that they're a positive\nperson or would you say that they're\nmore of a negative person if they lean\ntowards one side is it more positive or\nmore negative\nit's more negative one thing that's\nreally interesting is that i find that a\nlot of older people who sit at home\nduring the day and they watch a lot of\nnews they tend to be very scared they\ntend to be very negative and what do\nthey do they pass that on to their\nchildren they then text their children\nhey this is going on you should be aware\nof this hey this is going on you should\nbe aware this hey this is going on you\nshould be aware of this all day long\nand here's what most parents tend to do\nand i know a lot of parents to do this\nare you ready most parents will text\ntheir children and say hey beware of xyz\nmake sure that you're paying attention\nto this\nand here's what it is they say and\nwe all\ni mean i know so many people whose\nparents are like this just so you guys\nknow\nthey\nare in so much fear that they pass their\nfear onto their children\nand they disguise their fear\nas love\nlet me say this again\nso many parents not this isn't everybody\nbut i'm just going to give you an\nexample because you might be out there\nand this might be one of your parents so\nmany of your parents so many parents\nthat are out there excuse me i'm like i\nsay your parents\nso many parents that are out there uh\nthey have\na very negative mindset or they worry\ntoo much and they you know they think\nabout all the bad things they watch the\nnews or whatever it is that it might be\nand what actually happens is then they\npass that on to their children through\nsending them text messages or having to\ncall them every saying a single day or\nmaking sure everything's right or\nsending them all the negative things\nthat happen\nyou know so they make sure that they\nstay away from it and what happens is\nthe parent is fearful they pass that\nfear on to their child and they disguise\ntheir fear as love i'm only doing this\nbecause i love you i want you to stay\nalive i'm only doing this because i want\nyou to be aware of what's going on i'm\nonly doing this because of xyz\nthis is going to be an eye opener for a\nlot of people\nmaybe your parents do it to you maybe\nyou do it to your children\nbut it's not doing any good for anybody\nbecause the human brain is addicted to\nnegativity you know and\nof course you can look there's a lot of\nstuff that's crazy that's happened in\nthe world there's a lot of you know what\nis it 15 000 people a day i think die of\nstarvation you know there's a lot of\nthings that are bad that are happening\nin the world there's protests are going\nthere's people that are being killed\nthere's people that are you know in\nslavery still if you look at certain\ncountries it's it's crazy they think\nthat there's approximately 10 million\nchildren right now that are in slavery\nand a good majority of them are sex or\nin sex slavery like that's that's\nridiculous if you think about that's\ncrazy so there's always bad things\nhappening in the world\nand they're terrible and we wish that we\ncould do more about it\nand we still can but at the same time we\nhave to realize that there is still\nway way way way way more good than bad\nbut just because the nose doesn't show\nthe good doesn't mean that the good\nisn't happening i want you to be very\nvery understanding of that\nso what do we do what do we do in this\nsituation with ourselves\nwe pay attention to everything that's\ncoming into our awareness we become in\ncharge of what we allow into our brains\nstop watching the news instead listen to\npodcasts turn on youtube read a book\nhang out with people who inspire you go\nout into nature\nbe in charge in very intentional is as\nto what information comes into your body\nwhat you consume not just food\nhear see touch taste\neverything in your awareness be very\nvery aware of what's coming into your\nbody like i said not just the food but\neverything that's coming into your body\nthat's affecting your mind you need to\nbe very aware of it and be very in\ncontrol of it uh don't ex the way i\nalways explain it is this is if let's\nsay that you go you have a garage in\nyour house right and you go drive your\nford f-150 into\nthe garage you turn it off you go inside\nyou go through you have some dinner with\nthe family you go to bed you wake up and\nyou go into the garage\nwhat are you expecting to be in the\ngarage\na ford f-150\nwhy is that because that's what you\nparked in the garage would you ever\nexpect i'm going to go out into that\ngarage and there might be a ferrari or i\nmight be in that go in the other garage\nand be a toyota corolla no why because\nyou parked the freaking truck in the\ngarage\nso of course there's gonna be a ford\nf-150 in the garage\nso if you take all of this negative news\nand put it in your brain why would you\njust expect that you're gonna be\npositive\nno what you park in your garage aka your\nmind will be in your garage aka your\nmind the next morning so you've got to\nbe very diligent of what you allow into\nyour awareness the people that you hang\nout with the stuff that you watch the\nthings that conversations that you hear\nall of that you need to be very very\naware of and i wanna i wanna leave you\nwith something which puts a whole lot of\nperspective into your life my life\neverything and uh and people are\nthinking that the world is getting worse\ni'm gonna go ahead and let you listen to\nthis\nand realize how the world has changed\nand so\nthere was an article that i read and it\nsaid you know we've probably think that\nit's a mess out there it's hard to see\ndiscern between what's a real threat and\nwhat's a simple panic in hysteria for a\nsmall amount of perspective in this\nmoment imagine that you were born in\n1900\nmany would think that it's pretty simple\ntime of life\nbut by your 14th birthday world war 1\nstarts and ends on your 18th birthday\n22 million people will die in that war\nincluding many of your friends who\nvolunteered to defend freedom in europe\nlater that same year the spanish flu\nepidemic hits the planet and runs until\nyour 20th birthday\n50 million people die from it in those\ntwo years yes\n50 million\non your 29th birthday the great\ndepression begins unemployment hits 25\nthe world gdp drops 27\nthat runs\nuntil you're 38 years old\nthe country nearly collapses along with\nworld economy if you were lucky you had\na job that paid 300\na year\na dollar\na day\nwhen you turned 39 world war ii starts\nyou aren't even over the hill yet but\ndon't try to catch your breath if you\nlived in london england or most of the\ncontinental europe bombing of your\nneighborhood or invasion of your country\nby foreign soldiers along with their\ntank and\nartillery was a daily event\na daily event\nthousands\nof people\njoined the army and try to defend\nliberty with their lives between your\n39th\nand 45th birthday\n75\nmillion people will die in that war\nat age 50 the korean war starts 5\nmillion more people will die at age 55\nthe vietnam war begins and doesn't end\nfor 20 years\nfour million people will die in that\nconflict on your 62nd birthday there's\nthe cuban missile crisis a tipping point\nin the cold war life on your planet\ncould have ended\nsensible leaders prevented that from\nhappening\nso\nyou have to realize\nthat's what your life would be like if\nyou were born in 1900\nso thinking about your life right now\nyour current circumstances and what you\nhave to deal with\nis the world a little crazy yeah why\nbecause humans are a little crazy and\nthey always will be\nbut it doesn't mean that it's bad or\nit's worse than it's ever been before it\njust means that it's something that we\nneed to learn to work with but i will\npromise you this as crazy as it seems\nit's never been safer to be a human\nnumber one and number two there is\nalways always always always always more\ngood happening in the world than bad\nbut you get to choose what you want to\nfocus on if you continue to eat what the\nmedia and news feeds you and all that\nnegativity you're going to have to deal\nwith the sickness that comes from it\nso you can be in charge of what comes\ninto your body and if you're in charge\nof what comes into your body what you\nconsume\nyou will realize that you change the way\nthat you feel every single day because\nwhat you think about\ndepends on what you're consuming\nand when you think about something it\nchanges the way that you feel so if you\nwant to feel better all you got to do is\nthink better and to think better you\njust got to consume better\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if\nyou're focusing on all of the input your\ninput is just negative negative negative\nnegative the output of the way that you\nthink and the way that you feel all day\nlong is going to be negative that's just\na fact"
