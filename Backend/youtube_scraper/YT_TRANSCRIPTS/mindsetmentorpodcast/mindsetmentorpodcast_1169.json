personality\nbecause all too often people think this\nis my personality this is who i am this\nis who i am stuck with this is who i'm\ngoing to be the rest of my life and i'm\nhere to tell you that your personality\nwho you are who you think you are is one\nof the most malleable things that are\nout there in the world but you've been\nacting as if it's a piece of concrete\nand it can never change i am this way\ni've been this way since i was younger\ni'll be this way forever and i'm here to\ntell you that is absolutely 100\nnot the case and we're going to talk\nabout it and i want to tell you this\nbefore we even dive into it is that you\nare wearing a dirty shirt you are\nwearing an old\ndirty torn worn out shirt you are i am\nwe all are and what exactly does this\nmean when i say you're wearing an old\nshirt well let me explain i was i was\nwatching uh queer eye the show with my\ngirlfriend and if you haven't watched\nthe show it's real good show where they\ngo into someone's house they fix up\ntheir house they fix up their\npersonality they fix up their wardrobe\nthey fix up their look everything and\nthere was a show that we were watching\nthat they were they had a asian woman\nthat she was sitting there\nand she was talking about how she's just\nalways been this way because she was\ntaught when she was younger that she\nwasn't pretty and she just held on to it\nso she somebody told her at one point in\ntime in her life that she wasn't pretty\nand now she's in her mid-30s and she is\njust under the assumption that she isn't\npretty and the reason why was because of\nsomething that she was told when she was\na child\nand i want to talk to you about that\nbecause all of us\nwere basically given a shirt as a child\nand told put this on\nand what happened is we put it on and we\ndecided to put this one on for some\nreason and we've been wearing it for a\nlong time even though it doesn't fit us\nanymore it doesn't\nreflect who we truly are it's dirty it's\ngross it's torn it's never been never\nbeen washed\nand\nshe was told that she was ugly and\nbecause the fact that she was told as a\nchild she was ugly she believed it and\nevery single day she basically put on\nher ugly shirt\nand thought\nwell i guess i'm just ugly and so even\nif she grows up to be beautiful and\namazing she's still going to think that\nshe's ugly because she's still what\nshe's still wearing that shirt so\ni want you to realize that all of us are\ngiven a shirt at some point in time we\nput the shirt on we wear it and we think\nthat that is us not realizing that that\nversion of us\ni mean the version of you right now\nthat's either sitting or watching in\nlistening and seeing this\nthe version of you right now does not\nhave to be the same version of you in\nfive minutes you can be a completely\ndifferent version of yourself and that's\nwhat really tricks people out because\nthey think well i am who i am and this\nis who i'm gonna be forever so the\nquestion i have for you is what shirt\nare you wearing that you have outgrown\nthink about that are you wearing the i'm\nnot good enough shirt i'm not smart\nenough shirt the ugly shirt the\noverweight shirt the um\nyou know never be good enough shirt the\ni'm not good at math shirt what shirt\nare you wearing that doesn't make any\nsense and by wearing this shirt you're\ncreating the reality around you now\nyou've heard me say before that your\nthoughts create your reality but this\nshirt that you're wearing\nchanges the way that you interact with\npeople in the way that you interact with\npeople changes the way that they react\nto you so let me give an example\nsomebody could be ugly as a kid i wasn't\nthe best looking kid right i could be\nugly as a kid\nand let's just uh let's not even take it\nas me let's just take it as a let's say\nthat little johnny is ugly right he's\nugly he's told that he's ugly when he's\na kid maybe a kid bullies him maybe his\nalcoholic uncle tells him he's an ugly\nlittle kid or a pudgy little kid and\nhe'll always be ugly the rest of his\nlife maybe his parents say it whatever\nit is and he puts on this shirt this\nugly little boy shirt\nand he wears it the rest of his life now\neven if johnny grows up to be\nlooking like a model\nhe's still going to have what the\nconfidence of somebody who is ugly\nand so we've all seen it before we all\nknow somebody\nexcuse me who is uh a great looking\nperson but they don't carry themself the\nsame way that a normal great-looking\nperson would you're like there's just\nsomething\noff and you can tell that that person\ndoesn't have a lot of confidence even\nthough they might be good looking what's\nhappening is little johnny could be\nthis beautiful man this handsome man\nthis model-esque looking man but he's\nstill wearing the what the ugly shirt\nand so what he's doing is he's going out\nand interacting with people wearing this\nugly shirt and when you interact with\npeople with less confidence or you act\ndifferently their reaction to you will\nbe different so what's happening is\nthose people are actually reflecting\njohnny's own beliefs of himself\nand he can't get out of it he's wearing\nthis shirt he thinks a certain way about\nhimself and because of the fact that he\nthinks this way about himself he goes\nout into the world and people react to\nhim\nin a different way than if he went out\nthere with confidence with swagger with\nbeing you know i'm here i'm good looking\ni'm going to dominate the world whatever\nit is because we know when someone walks\nthe room and they're confident you know\nwhen a confident person walks through\nthey have this this feeling that of just\nconfidence that's there\nbut johnny for instance might be wearing\nthe ugly shirt even though it might be\ngreat looking might be going on not\nbeing confident at all so no matter how\ngreat he looks he's carrying himself a\ndifferent way and people will treat them\ndifferently based off the way that they\nare another example of that is the\noverweight shirt\nyou know all too often there's little\nkids that are overweight and they are\ngiven you know somebody says oh look at\nthis chunky little kid he's so cute with\nhis big old cheeks whatever it is\nand they hear that and they put on the\nfat shirt they put on the overweight\nshirt and they wear that shirt forever\nand they don't think and you know\nbecause the fact that they're wearing\nthe shirt they could be 35 years old and\noverweight and they've always been\noverweight what happens they say to\nthemselves they once again they go out\ninto the world with the habits and\ntraits and interact with people as an\noverweight person so\nan example of of exactly what i mean by\nthis is somebody could say listen i\nwanna you know smoke could be 35 years\nold let's use johnny as an example but\ninstead of him being a\nugly kid he was an overweight kid well\nnow he grows up he's 35 years old he's\noverweight and he thinks to himself well\nthere's no reason for me to work out\nbecause it's just in my genes my whole\nfamily is overweight\nyou know i want to be healthy but\nthere's no reason i just don't have the\ngenes for it there's no reason for me to\neat healthy because the fact that i've\nalways been fat so why would i eat\nsomething healthy when i'm not going to\nnot be fat because all i know is being\nfat\nand so they're overweight and they're\nwearing the overweight shirt and going\nout into the world with the overweight\nhabits and traits not actually ever\nchanging those\nin you know diets have never worked for\nme they've never worked for my family\nand so there's no reason for me to put\neffort into it now that might be the\ncase maybe your family does have maybe\nthere is something in your jeans that\nmakes you a little bit overweight it\ndoesn't mean that it's impossible it\nmeans it might be harder to lose weight\nbut it's not impossible nothing is\nimpossible the actual transition of who\nyou are and to who you want to be is not\nimpossible\nand so you have to think about that am i\ncarrying this shirt with me that i need\nto take off this ugly shirt this\noverweight shirt this i'm not good at\nmath shirt because i failed a math test\nin second grade and i put that shirt on\nand now i've been failing classes you\nknow i failed all of my math classes i\nfailed it was so hard for me to do\nbecause i put on a shirt in second grade\nwhen i failed that first math test\nright i could wear the son of an\nalcoholic shirt if i wanted to and say\noh yeah well i'm just the way that i am\nbecause my dad was an alcoholic it's a\nreally great story around this about\nabout two twin brothers\nand those two twin brothers basically uh\nthey grow up\nthey have an alcoholic father when\nthey're a kid they're two identical twin\nbrothers and one of them grows up and he\nbecomes a successful ceo and the other\none grows up and becomes an alcoholic\nand they go up to both of them and they\nsay why are you\nthe way that you are so they go up to\nthe alcoholic and they say why are you\nan alcoholic and he says i'm an\nalcoholic because my father was an\nalcoholic so then they walk up to the\nsuccessful ceo and they say why are you\nnot an alcoholic\nand he says i'm not an alcoholic because\nmy father is an alcoholic\nboth of them have the exact same\ncircumstances\nbut they're wearing different shirts not\none of them is wearing the victim shirt\nof i am this way because my dad was\nswaying i will forever be this way\nthat is my mom's biggest fear is that i\nwill turn out to be an alcoholic because\nthey say that there's an alcohol\nalcoholic gene which i'm just calling\n[ __ ] on i will never have it and if\ni have it it's not going to affect me\nlike that's just my overall thought of\nthe entire thing in general right so\nit's not like the people like oh well\ni'm an alcohol because my father's not\ncalling my his father's not clark well\nsame with mine my father's an alcoholic\nand his father was an alcoholic as well\nthat's being broken with me\nright so i put on the shirt of i will\nnever be an alcoholic and i'm not going\nto let that affect me in fact i'm going\nto use this instead of something that\nholds me back something that propels me\nforward\nso what shirt are you wearing\nexcuse me because none of it is true\nnone of it\nthe only thing that is true is what you\naccept\nas true because when you accept it is\ntrue you're gonna go out into the world\nand you're going to actually\ngo out and take actions and have the\nhabits and traits of\nxyz whatever it is that you're actually\nbelieving it\nbut you if none of it's true\nwhy are you still waking up every single\nday and putting on that shirt\ndoes that shirt serve you anymore or is\nit time for you to go out and get a\ndifferent shirt\nthink about that for a second what if\nyou just decided to put on a different\nshirt and not put on the same\nold\ni'm just overweight and i'm going to be\nthis way forever since you were six\nyears old and that first person called\nyou fat and you finally had the\nawareness that you were bigger than\nother kids\nand you've just perpetuated that the\nwhole time\nbecause now that you know you've been\nputting that shirt on now that you're\nlooking in the mirror going oh my god i\nhave this shirt on you can change it if\nyou were wearing the ugly shirt uh\nlittle johnny he's just ugly if you were\njust wearing the ugly shirt how about\nyou wake up and you put on the i love\nmyself and i'm beautiful shirt every\nsingle day and you look at yourself in\nthe mirror and you tell yourself a\nhundred times i love you i love you for\nall of the flaws for everything i love\nyou\nbecause we all know somebody who's not\ngood looking\nbut they've got just confidence and\nyou're like what how the hell did that\nhappen like we all know somebody is like\nthat right\nthe reason why is because they decided\nnot to put on the ugly shirt they\ndecided to put on the confident i'm\ngoing to conquer the world shirt and\nwhat i look like doesn't matter and\nwhat's crazy about it is the confidence\nmakes them even better looking\nthat's the real crazy thing about the\nwhole thing\nif you're wearing the overweight shirt\nwhy don't you just put on the i'm going\nto lose weight no matter what shirt\ni'm going to diet i'm going to not even\ndiet i'm going to eat healthy i'm going\nto eat healthier i'm going to take out\ncertain parts of my diet that i know i\nshould have taken out a long time ago\ni'm going to eat healthier i'm going to\ngo to the gym a few times a week i'm\ngoing to hire a trainer it might be\nharder for me than the average person\nbut damn it i will do it\nwhy don't you put on that shirt\nthis is also just so you guys know this\nis the reason why people lose a bunch of\nweight like somebody can lose 100 pounds\nand then gain it back is because they\ncan get very very\nroutined and disciplined for an amount\nof time and lose a hundred pounds but\nthey never actually take the shirt off\nso what do they do they eat a couple\nextra cupcakes\nthey you know go to a drive-through when\nthey know they shouldn't they do this\nover and over and over again it's not\nlike they gain you know they lose 100\npounds and they gain 100 pounds back\nright away but they lose 100 pounds and\nthen three years later they back to the\nsame size that they were is because the\nshirt\nnever actually changed which is how they\nview themself in the mirror never\nactually changed\nit's the same reason why people who are\nyou know they say\nthe\nyou know poor get poorer is because poor\nis a mentality\nyou know i've been poor i know what it's\nlike poor is a mentality i know a lot of\npoor people i know a lot of rich people\nas well both of those are mentalities\nit's the shirt that they're wearing oh\ni'm poor my whole family's been poor\nwe've been like this forever we're\nalways going to be like this that's a\nshirt that you're wearing you could take\nthat shirt off and you can change at any\ntime\nyou know the i'm not good at math shirt\nexcuse me going crazy today with my\ncough uh the i'm not good at math shirt\nokay so you might be not be great at it\ndoesn't mean you can't improve at it you\nknow when i remember what happened with\nme and i'm really good in math and\nreally good at just seeing numbers and\njust doing them and the reason why is\nbecause i remember in third grade i\nswitched to a different school so\nbetween second grade and third grade\ni switched from about i wish switch from\na bad school and a bad part of town to a\nbetter school\nand i guess a better part of town and\nwhen i got to third grade i realized\nthat i was a lot stupider than all the\nother kids and we had these things that\nwere called split classes which means\nthat my third grade class my teacher\nactually taught second grade and third\ngrade so there were second grade kids\nthat were smarter than i was and they\nwere really good in math and we used to\ndo this thing called the math minute and\nliterally i remember this the first math\nminute that i did there would be all of\nthese different equations you know it\nwas like multiplication edition all that\nstuff whatever you're doing in third\ngrade\nand i remember going through them\nand i got destroyed like everybody\nfinished it you were supposed to finish\nas fast you can and the person who\nfinished the fast it was the winner and\nyou tried everybody tries to get it done\nin a minute right i remember i was\nterrible at it so i had this little\nthing that had you know you would push\nit would say one times one and you push\nit down and it would say one but you\ncouldn't see it until you pushed it down\nand say one times two and it was a graph\nthat went from one to one times one to\none times ten and then it went down to\nthe bottom for ten times one to ten\ntimes 10. and so literally from 1 to 100\nall of those numbers you could memorize\nand so i went through and i literally\nremember hitting that thing and\nmemorizing and memorizing because i was\nlike i'm not going to be\nbeat i'm not going to be stupid anymore\ni remember literally thinking that and i\nwent from terrible at math to really\ngood at math only because i was fed up\nbeing stupid\ni didn't realize it then in third grade\nbut i was just changing my shirt\nyou can change your shirt at any point\nin time\nwhat else do we have alcoholism runs in\nmy family i'm not gonna wear that shirt\nanymore i'm gonna wear the\nmy father was an alcoholic i'm not gonna\nbe a damn alcoholic shirt that's the\nshirt that i'm gonna wear there's a\nreally great book that's called psycho\ncybernetics it was written a while ago\nand\nit's been a while since i've probably\nabout 16 years since i've read it i\nremember my very first mentor told me to\nread it and it's about\na um\nthe whole story is is about like in the\nearly years of plastic surgery there was\na plastic surgeon he would notice that\npeople would come in and he would fix\nsomething super small on them like a you\nknow like a mole or just a tiny bump on\ntheir nose and he would fix it and then\nthey would come back you know after\ntheir surgery a few months later\nwhatever it was and they would be a\ncompletely different person only because\nhe removed a mole and what he realized\nwhat it it wasn't the actual mole\nthat was that was you know holding\nsomebody's personality in place it was\nsomeone's perception of themself that\nheld them back in place and so he would\nchange this little tiny thing about\nsomebody they would come back and be a\ndifferent person with more confidence\nyou know more outgoing they'd look him\nin the eye they'd shake his hand more\nand he realized that it had nothing to\ndo with their physical appearance it had\neverything to do with their perception\nof themselves based on their physical\nappearance\nand so the book cyber cybernetics talks\nabout that and realized that surgery\nwasn't even actually necessary what was\nnecessary is people's own\nperception of themself changing\nso the question that i have for you\nis what shirt do you need to take off\nwhat shirt have you been wearing your\nentire life that no longer fits and you\nknow what probably didn't even fit in\nthe first place and it's dirty and it's\nworn out and it's keeping you in the\nsame place perpetuating the same habits\nattitudes and traits that you've been\ndoing the exact same way your entire\nlife and it's time for you to take off\nthe shirt and put on a new shirt so the\nquestion i have for you because we all\nhave shirts we need to take off and put\non a new one\nwhat shirt do you need to take off\nthink about that for a second\nwhat shirt do you need to take off\nthe next question i have for you is what\nshirt do you need to put on and replace\nit with\nnow here's the thing that's that we all\nneed to know\nyou're not going to wake up tomorrow\nyou know having thought that you were\nugly your entire life and wake up and\nyou're going to put on the i'm beautiful\nshirt and you're going to think that way\nforever\nno no no the brain likes to fall into\nold habits and traits that it's been\ndoing for years and years and years\nit's very easy for the brain to continue\nto do what it's always done it's very\nhard for it to start to change so you\nactually have to change the shirt every\nsingle day and you have to change your\nperception every single day and you have\nto be very diligent on changing your\nperception of this\nit won't change in one day it's a\ncomplete reprogramming but here's what's\ncrazy when you do something over and\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain\nyour brain\nactually starts to change the chemicals\nin your brain and actually change the\nstructure of your brain and when it\nchanges the structure of your brain it\nchanges the function of your brain it's\ncalled neuroplasticity\nso you can do this every single day\nevery single day every single day if you\nthink i'm ugly i'm ugly and you wake up\nevery single day and you tell yourself a\nhundred times in the mirror and you look\nyourself in the eye and you say you're\nbeautiful you're beautiful you're\nbeautiful i love you i love your\nmistakes and you say the same thing over\nand over and over and over again a\nhundred times every day for the next\nyear your perception of yourself will\n100 shift because you are actually\nmaking chemical\nstructural and functional changes in\nyour brain by doing that but you have to\nbe very diligent on it\nso\ntwo questions here and i'm gonna\nactually go really deep with you in just\na second because we're not done\nwhich shirt do you need to take off that\nyou've been wearing for way too long\ndoesn't fit you and probably never did\nwhat shirt do you need to put on\nand now the next thing i have to ask you\nwhich is going to mess a lot of you up\nsorry to do this to you\nwhat shirt are you making your children\nwear\nthink about that for a second\nyou have been giving your children a\nshirt their entire lives\neverything that you do and say to them\nyour perception of them is changing\ntheir perception of themselves\nso what shirt have you maybe\nunintentionally be given your children\nand you didn't even realize it\ni want you to think about that and i\nwant you to ask yourself what shirt do i\nneed to give them\nmaybe i've been giving them the shirt of\nyou're just not good at math\nmaybe i'll be given the shirt of yeah\nwell you know our family is just\noverweight that's the way it is\nand then they're overweight because of\ntheir perception of themself\nmaybe you give them the perception of\nyeah our family's just not that athletic\nour family is not that smart you're\ngonna be the same what shirt are you\ngiving your children what shirt would\nyou prefer to give them now if you don't\nhave children\nwhat shirt are you giving out to\neverybody else\nbecause here's the interesting thing and\ni don't want to dive into in this\nepisode because it can get a whole other\nepisode on song um there's a very i\nthink it's calvin cooley that says this\nhe says\ni'm not what i think i am\ni'm not what you think i am i am what i\nthink that you think that i am\nso we actually build ourselves in our\npersonality based off of other people's\nperceptions our perception of the way\nother people perceive us\nso your children aren't just building\ntheir own\npersonal reality personality\noff of themselves and what they see but\nthey're also building it off of what\nthey see you of how you interact and\ntalk with them and so does every person\nthat you love that you talk to every\nsingle day\nso you're handing out shirts every\nsingle day as well by the way that you\ntreat people the question is\nis it the shirt that you want them to\nwear\nso\nthere's a really great quote that i want\nto leave you with that the buddha said\nand the buddha said just as a snake\nsheds its skin we must shed our past\nover and over again\nthe same way that you have to the snake\nsheds that skin you now need to shed\nthat shirt\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well\nif you believe\nthat the world is going to\nyou will see all of the ways\nthat the world is going to"
