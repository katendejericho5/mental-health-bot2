    "transcript": "how do you get out of your head during\nthis pandemic what are the top three\nbooks that you would recommend do you\nbelieve in aliens is the next question\nyou want me to be honest with you\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be diving into a\nquestion answer session just for the\nhell of it i don't know how long this is\ngoing to go but i uh put up a post on my\ninstagram and ask you guys hey if you\nhad one question that you could ask me\nof how i could help you what would it be\nand uh i got a lot of questions i got a\nlot of interesting questions and i\npicked the ones that i feel like would\nbe the best for you guys\nif we get into it there are some\ninteresting questions uh questions about\naliens\nthere are questions about living with me\nfor a week so hey you know we might get\ninto that at some point in time we'll\nsee where we go uh so i'm going to go\nthrough these and this could be a longer\nepisode i have a feeling this will be a\nlonger episode but i think it will be\nfun i think it's be kind of a free flow\nand uh if you guys want to ask me\nquestions follow me on instagram ask me\nquestions on there and i'll try to dive\ninto it so the first question which i\nhad a couple questions that were along\nthe lines of something like this and\nthey were what do you do when life has\nturned your life has been turned upside\ndown by the pandemic how do you find a\nway to get back on track\nanother question though something around\nthis is how do you get out of your head\nduring this pandemic the fear the\nanxiety the depression\ni've got one very simple answer for all\nof you with the pandemic and\nthe answer is to just accept\nright if you are feeling fear and\nanxiety\naround everything that's going on the\nunknown\nthe problem is you're not accepting your\ncurrent reality what you're really\nwanting to happen is you're wanting to\ngo back to the way that it was and at\nthis point in time for the unforeseeable\nfuture it's not going to go back to the\nway that it was it's going to be\nthe way that it is\nfor\nyou know\ni don't know however long it's going to\nbe\nand uh you know i understand that some\npeople are losing jobs and uh if you've\nlost your job i understand that sucks\ni've lost jobs before too\nbut what is the secret accept\nand move on\nokay now what not to look in the past\nand go oh my god i wish i wouldn't have\nlost my job but to look at and say okay\ni have lost my job\nis there anything i can do about that\nright now no okay well what can i do\npriority number one will be to find\nanother job\nso if you're out there and you've lost\nsomething or something has changed for\nyou i feel for you i get it i understand\nbut that's happened and there's nothing\nthat you can do about that because\nwhatever you're having stress and\nanxiety over uh with the current\npandemic you probably if the pandemic\nwasn't going on would take those exact\nsame feelings and put it into something\nelse you probably have stress and\nanxiety around your relationship or the\ncurrent circumstance in the world or\nsomething else besides just the pandemic\nthe pandemic is you know if you guys\nhave heard me say it over and over again\nthe way you do one thing is the way you\ndo everything so if you're stressing\nanxiety and feeling anxiety around the\npandemic you're probably feeling stress\nand anxiety around something else and so\nuh the the number one thing that i could\ntell you is if you're out there um\nyou're just gonna have to accept\nuh the phrase that i say all the time\nwhich i tend to get quoted on a lot\non instagram when people type up on\ninstagram and then tag me in it is uh is\nthis\nyour stress and anxiety will be in\ndirect proportion\nto how much how much stress and anxiety\nyou feel will be in direct proportion to\nhow much you're resisting the way that\nthe world is\nright your stress and your anxiety will\nbe in direct proportion like they'll be\nliterally exactly the same around how\nmuch you're resisting the way that the\nworld is so if you're resisting a lot\nand you're having\na lot of resistance to the way that the\nworld currently is well then you're\ngoing to have a lot of stress and\nanxiety that is equal to that so if you\nwant to get rid of your stress and\nanxiety what do you need to do you need\nto just accept\nit is the way that the world is\nis it the way that you want it probably\nnot but the quicker that you accept it\nthe quicker that you can work through it\nso that's what i would say is accept it\nis the way that it is the world is\nperfect the way that it is it's changing\nit's changing into being even more\nperfect uh but you have to realize it's\nuh you know what i always say is that\nthe you have you can either think that\nthe world is happening to you or you can\nthink the world is happening for you so\nyou could say this pandemic is really\nscrewing up my life right now\nor you could say you know what the\npandemic is actually shifting up my\nfoundation and making me go out and find\nnew opportunities maybe it's making you\nget rid of that job\nor getting you fired from that job that\nyou hated so that you can go and\nactually do something that you truly\nlove so the world's either happening to\nyou or it's happening for you i am under\nthe belief that it's always happening\nfor you and so if it's happening for you\nwhat are you supposed to learn from this\nthat's going on right now so that's what\ni would say\ngreat questions there's a few of them\nthat came in like that\nuh this one says\nif there was one piece of advice you\ncould bestow great word as if we're in\nthe 1800s if you could bestow on people\nif there was one piece of advice that\nyou could bestow on people that you wish\neveryone would follow\nwhat would it be\ni'm torn because i have two pieces of\nadvice\num the first piece of advice that i\nwould give you\nis to\nwork on yourself harder than you do\nanything else\nright to work on yourself harder than\nyou do anything else in the world\nbecause the more that you work on\nyourself\nthe better that you're going to be and\nthe better that you are the more that\nyou can go out and change the world so\nthat would be the first thing that i\nwould say\nand the second thing that i would say\nespecially with the world's current\ncircumstances is to\nto not be so\nuh\nso concrete in your opinions\nbe open\nto somebody shifting your found the\nfoundation of your life to changing your\nopinion there's a lot of people that are\njust so against their opinion being\nchanged and when they get challenged\nthey get angry they start pushing their\nopinion other people what i would say is\nbe open to somebody changing your\nopinion be open to living\nbe open to seeing things from other\npeople's perspectives\nright be empathetic to the fact that you\nmight not know everything in fact\nyou don't know anything and neither do i\nwe know a very very very little amount\nthere is a uh it actually reminds me i'm\ngonna pull up my phone so i could tell\nyou this quote that i found today once\nagain guys this is just a different one\nwe're just gonna go free flow so i'm\njust gonna be you know a little bit all\nover the place uh and the the quote says\nthe more i learn\nthe more i learn that i have a lot more\nto learn\nright it's like the more i learn\nthe more i learn that i have a lot more\nto learn it's like the the the older i\nget the more i realize that i don't know\nanything it's like i i learn more but as\ni learn more i realize that i don't know\nmuch at all and so\nuh that would be a big piece of advice\nthat i would give you guys is to just be\nopen to other people's\nsituations\nyou know i don't i'll give you an\nexample i am a white man in america i\nknow nothing of what it's like to be a\nblack man a black woman gay i know\nnothing of what it's like to be anybody\noutside of america to be raised in you\nknow yemen which is this country that's\njust being destroyed right now with war\nand famine i know nothing of what it's\nlike so who am i to act like i know what\nyour life is like i don't but i'm\nwilling to sit down and listen to you\nand to have you change my opinions and i\nthink that's kind of a cool thing to be\nable to sit with someone have their\nopinions so\nthat would be it two things two pieces\nof advice number one i would work on\nyourself hardly work anything else and\nnumber two be open\nto having other people change your\nopinions don't be so so firm in them\nuh next question that came in that i\nthought was good was what is your\nfavorite quote and how does it keep you\ngoing\nuh my favorite quote i have a lot of\nfavorite quotes but this is the favorite\nquote that popped into my head\nimmediately is uh the cave that you fear\nto enter holds the treasure that you\nseek\nthe cave that you fear to enter holds a\ntreasure that you seek what do i mean by\nthat exactly i mean that\nwhat you are most afraid\nto do is what you need to do\nwhat you're most afraid to do if you do\nit will be the thing that changes your\nlife\nyou know that's um\nit's the reason why and you guys hear me\ntalk about them quite often uh why i\nthink psychedelics are so amazing for\nlots of people not everybody but for\nlots of people it's because whatever it\nis that you need to do or need to work\npast or you need to conquer\nin order to get to the next stage of\nyour life or to let go of your ego or to\nstop with your control problems or\nwhatever it is when you do psychedelics\nthey're\nyou're faced with them\nlike we all have our demons in some sort\nof way\nyou're faced with them\nwhether it's a control problem whether\nit's a trauma that you haven't fully\nhealed from whether it's you haven't\nfully grieved from someone's death\nwhatever it is it's in front of you and\nthe reason why is because it's like the\nhighest version of yourself coming down\nand saying\nthis is it in order for you to progress\nand become who you truly can become you\nneed to work through this first\nand um\nthat's why i love the quote uh the cave\nthat you fear to enter holds a treasure\nthat you seek\nthe next question which i found was\npretty funny says can i come live with\nyou for a week just to pick your brain\nclosely and\nand for free uh the answer to that is no\neven if you paid me i wouldn't want you\nto come live with me for a week not\nbecause i don't love you but because the\nfact that uh\ni'll just be honest with you that\ndoesn't sound fun it doesn't sound fun\nin my opinion uh i don't really want you\nto come live with me um\nbut you know i put enough\ni put enough content out there for you\nto basically see what my life is like\nand to understand what's going on in my\nbrain just continue to watch this\nwherever you're watching this or listen\nto this wherever you're listening to it\num\noh and then the other the other part of\nit said i believe a weak consultation\nwith you would change my life for good\nit probably would um\nmaybe hopefully i would hope so if\nyou're with me for a week and you didn't\nget anything from it uh i think that\nthere's probably uh an issue on my side\nuh so\nfor all of you guys that wanted to come\nlive with me sorry that is not uh there\nare no open invitations to live with me\nuh for a week\nuh next one uh says i see you have on\none of your new clothing line shirts how\nsoon will they be available\nfor those of you guys that are listening\non the podcast you're not watching the\nvideo on instagram or youtube i am\nwearing the shirt because what happened\nwas i took a picture a selfie and i\nposted it and said hey if you have\nquestions for me in my podcast comment\nthem down below\nthis is actually the first look so you\nguys can see this\ni'm not going to talk too much about the\nbrand at this point this is actually a\nsample shirt this is the very first\nsample shirt that exists in the world\nfor those you guys that can't see it go\nto my instagram follow me and you can\nsee it\nand it says be the change\non the front of it it's a black shirt\non the side it has our logo which is a\nred heart that's kind of very\nimperfectly drawn on purpose and the\nreason why is because you know we'll\ntalk about it more as the time comes\nbut the reason why it's a hard on your\nsleeve is because\nwe want to promote people wearing their\nhearts on their sleeves um because\nwe think that you know authenticity is\nwhat's needed in the world there's also\none more surprise that's actually on the\ninside of this shirt\nbut\ni'm not going to tell you what it is yet\nbut there's a surprise on the inside of\nshirt down by the crotch\nthis is true there is um\nyou know it's it's not my crotch it's\nthe crotch of the shirt uh so\nthere is something on the bottom inside\nof the shirt i'll give you a quick look\nif you're watching there it is that was\nit that's all you get to see um so\nwe'll make the full announcement i'll\nmake the full announcement but how soon\nwill they be available um\nprobably the next 60 days so uh for you\nguys that have been like man where is\nthe because i've gotten a lot of\nmessages i get like 30 emails a week\nthat are like hey where when's your\nclothing line being launched um it's uh\nit's still going on it's just that we\nwanted to make sure we got the highest\nquality shirts possible so these shirts\nare not like shirts that you can get\nat uh on basically anywhere online uh we\nwent directly to the manufacturer uh to\nget these shirts these aren't just like\nthe cheap you know uh american apparel\nor next level shirts or anything like\nthat like we are the only company in the\nworld besides this company that makes\nthis shirt that's able to use this\nso we went directly to the source and\ntalked to the ceo\nso\nnext question which came up a couple\ntimes how do you find the right circle\nof friends\nthis is a great question because first\noff\ni didn't have i had a good circle of\nfriends years ago\nbut about five years ago i really\nswitched my circle of friends like i\nbecame really really diligent on making\nsure that i was hanging out with the\nright people and\nwhat i did to find my circle of friends\nis i asked myself the question where\nwould the perfect friend be hanging out\nright so uh networking events so i went\nto meetup.com and on meetup.com i tried\nto figure out the perfect person that i\nwould be really good friends with where\nwould they be hanging out what would it\nbe doing um i found a\na bunch of different networking events\nthat i went to a bunch of things that i\nwent to\nand the way that i found my group of\nfriends was i found one networking event\nthat was\nthe one i related to the most it's\ncalled internet marketing party it\nhappens here in austin and uh i actually\nyou know i what's cool about it is you\ncan't see it in the video but right\nabove me right here is the thing where i\ni spoke at internet marketing party the\nvery first internet marketing party that\ni went to i was like i'm going to speak\non that stage one day\ni mean it took me four and a half years\nbut i spoke on the stage and there's a\nlittle right above me if you ever look\nat my instagram stories you've seen it\nwhen i'm sitting here uh right above me\nis the\nsigned every single person that was at\nthe event signed it but\nwhere i found my best circle of friends\nwas actually by going to internet\nmarketing party every single month every\nsingle month every single month and just\nconnecting with as many people as i\ncould and finding finding one person\nthat was it my goal was to find one\nperson that i truly connected with every\nsingle month and what i would do is i\nwould get their number and i would ask\nthem if they wanted to go get coffee we\nwould go get coffee\nif we clicked you know we'd develop a\nrelationship and what happens is when\nyou birds of a feather flock together so\nif you connect with someone who's a good\nperson to connect with you go and get\ncoffee with them they've got other\nfriends that you probably want to\nconnect with and you can connect them\nwith your friends they can connect you\nwith their friends you can go back and\nforth and what you realize is you start\ndeveloping this friend network that's\npretty incredible so what i would say is\nfigure out where all these people that\nyou truly want to become friends with\nare hanging out go there go to\nnetworking events meet people don't be\nthe person just giving and handing out\nbusiness cards that's not the correct\nway to network what i would say is go\nahead and literally take um\nbut you know spend time with people if\nyou're not connected with someone the\nfirst like 10 minutes you know\nexcuse yourself go to the bathroom go\nget a drink whatever it is you need to\ndo and then start talking to someone\nelse your goal is to connect with just\none person on a deeper level and then\ntake them to coffee later that week so\nthat's how i've developed my my circle\nof friends\nit's kind of cool because in in about\nthree years about three years it took me\nmaybe even less two years probably uh i\ndeveloped the friends group where i was\nlike oh my gosh this is the friends\ngroup i always wanted like really\nincredible heart-centered spiritual\npeople who are also freaking killing it\nand doing multi-million dollars\nmulti-million dollars in in business and\nthey're doing it for all the right\nreasons you know are you going to find\npeople you don't like in there\nabsolutely there's like 95 percent of\nthe people that i don't like in there\nyou know people are just doing it for\nmoney and they want to do that type of\nstuff but it was just like for me it\ntook me some time you kind of sift\nthrough and you find the people that you\nconnect with and those are your peeps\nthat's who you stay with so that's how i\nfound the right circle of friends\num\nnext question says when did you realize\nyou needed to wake up and make a change\nin your life\num when i was about 19 years old uh is\nwhen i started selling cutco knives\nwhich you guys probably know if you've\nbeen listening to the the mindset mentor\npodcast for a while\nand um\ni heard my first coach and paid him 500\na month when i was 19.\nand uh when i really realized there was\none moment in my life where i remembered\ni remember like waking up\nand being like oh my god this is\ni need to do something\nand uh i was partying a lot i was 19 i\nwas partying now you guys have to\nrealize i\nwas like a professional partier from 16\nyears old\non and like i was in what i mean\nprofessional party like i came from the\ncity where i had the\nthe highest underage drinking per capita\nin the united states uh we\nuh i'm gonna go ahead and just tell you\nguys this because whatever i might as\nwell you guys know i'm fully authentic\nuh i was part of a surf crew\nand uh we were the surf crew that was\nlike it was it was like in the people in\nour school we surfed right and we all\nhung out it was just the surfers we were\nknown um because we saw it in a surf\nmovie as team tdtf is what we went by uh\ni don't i don't think i've ever said\nthis in a public setting so this is\nhilarious team tdtf is what we went by\nwhich stood for too drunk to [ __ ] i\nswear to god this is a true story i'm\nnot even kidding you so where that came\nfrom is we were watching a surf movie\nand the surf movie they went by team two\ndrunk to [ __ ] and we're like that's\npretty cool we should go buy that and we\nwere also known as the people who threw\nall of the parties in the city so like\nif you had your parents oh my gosh i\ncan't believe i'm sharing this this is\nso funny um if you had your parents\ngoing out of town you called us and we\nthrew the party for you\nwe actually threw a party um god i can't\ni just literally i feel like i'm like on\ntruth serum i'm saying stuff i've never\nsaid before\num\nwe threw a party one time that was so\nbig the cops got called and there was a\nmile and a half of traffic and um\nand there was about 1100 people that\nwere there uh it was all completely\nunderage drinking for sure that's what\nit was and so am i proud of it no is it\npart of my life yes am i being honest\nwith you guys yes i'm not going to tell\nyou i was a perfect person for a long\ntime i'm still not a perfect person i'm\ngoing to just be brutally honest with\nyou guys as much as i possibly can\nso\nthat's where i came from and i was\npartying and blacking out smoking a lot\nof weed drinking a lot of alcohol\ni mean it was it was intense\nhow serious we took partying right\nand uh so team tdtf once again we got it\nfrom a surf movie we thought it was cool\nso everybody knew when your parents were\nout of town you called someone in tdtf\nand we would throw the party for you um\nso\nwhen did i realize i realized when i was\nstill partying at 19 years old and this\nis why i'm telling you this whole story\nabout my past i was still 19 years old i\nwas partying i wasn't even legally able\nto drink\nbut i kept i i had a one-on-one coach i\npaid him 500 a month and i kept\nshowing up late to the phone calls or\nnot hitting the assignments and i wasn't\ntaking it as serious i could even though\ni was paying him 500 a month which at 19\nyears old is like all the money in the\nworld i was paying 350 a month for rent\ni was paying more for my one-on-one\ncoach than i watched for rent\nexcuse me and um\nand one morning he said to me and he\ndoesn't even remember the saying this to\nme this is what's funny i don't remember\nanything he said to me in our two years\nof working together\ni mean there was a lot of stuff that was\nsaid that changed my life but i don't\nremember anything off the top of my head\nthe one thing i remember is one morning\ni still remember sitting in my car\nand he said the phrase and you may have\nheard me say this before\num he said to me the phrase about being\na ceo and he said rob i've got a\nquestion for you\nif a business fails\nwhose fault is that\nand i was like\ni mean it's the the ceo's fault\nhe's like yeah that's right and if the\nbusiness succeeds\nwhose fault is that\ni was like i don't know probably the\nceo's fault as well and he's like yeah\nthat's right\nhe goes now let me ask you a question\nsee he set me up he set me up is what he\ndid so let me ask you a question\nwith your life\nif you get to the end of your life\nand you see your life as\nsomething you regret\nas a failure\nwhose fault is that\ni was like it's\nit's my fault\nand he said\nif you get to the end of your life and\nit was a massive success\nwhose fault is that\nand i said it's\nmy own fault he said right\nhe said so what you don't realize is\nthat you\nare not treating your life as if you're\nthe ceo of your life\nwhat you're doing\nis you're blaming other people you're\nmaking excuses you are living your life\nas if you know you just get another shot\nyou don't get another shot you have to\nlive your life as if you're the ceo of\nyour life plain and simple that's all\nthat there is and right now your\nbusiness is failing\nand i was like\noh my god\nand from that moment on\ni literally stopped blaming other people\ni was a professional excuse maker like i\nwas so\ndamn good and persuasive of giving you\nan excuse i was i was like a\nprofessional so good at it\ni just stopped from that moment on and i\nwas like everything that happens is my\nfault from that moment on and that piece\nof advice changed my life\nso\nthat was the moment that i can think of\nwhen i really\nrealized i needed to wake up\nnext question says what are the top\nthree books that you would recommend\nthe top three books i would recommend\nand uh\nnumber one\nwould be uh think and grow rich by\nnapoleon hill\nthat is my favorite book for what lis\nfor me made me wake up and really start\nto take life seriously and realize that\nsuccess is not something that's just\nlike\nfor the for the one percent or for the\nfew people that are born with the silver\nspoon like success\nis k you're every every single person is\ncapable of success\nand there's steps to getting there and i\nrealized when i read that book oh my god\nthese are the steps to be successful if\ni literally just read this book and do\nevery single thing that this book says\ni'll be successful what's crazy is that\ni read that book 14 years ago\nand if you fast forward to today i would\nsay\nyeah it worked like it it\nit worked\nand so i would say that book\nchanged my life\nmade me realize that i could be\nsuccessful no matter where i came from\nno matter what i look like no matter\nwhat it is that i want to do i could be\nsuccessful so that's the first one i'd\nrecommend the second one that i would\nrecommend is called the one thing by\ngary keller and jay papasan\nand the reason why i would recommend\nthat book is because\ntoo many people\nspend their lives like build they build\nmultiple businesses at once they always\nhave a plan b\nin case plan a doesn't work out\nbut the one thing\nincredible book talks about how you\nshould put all your eggs in one basket\nbecause you always hear don't put all\nyour eggs in one basket and this is\nwritten by gary keller who's a\nbillionaire he runs you know he owns\nkeller williams which is the largest\nreal estate company in the world\nand he talks about the one thing put all\nyour eggs in one basket so people say\ndon't put all your eggs in one basket\nhis phrase is basically put all your\neggs in one basket and take care of that\nfreaking basket put a hundred percent of\nyour effort into that thing\nright so outside of your family or\nwhatever it is a hundred percent of your\neffort goes into that thing that's how\nyou become successful uh that changed my\nlife because that's what got me to where\ni am now because i quit all of my plan\nb's and i said i'm going to succeed at\nthis\nno matter what\nand you know that's that's what really\nchanged my focus\nand then the last one i would say which\nmight surprise some people is actually\ncalled uh it's recently became my my\nthird favorite book like in my top three\nuh because i just read it within the\npast 9 months and it's called\nconversations with god\nand the reason why i would recommend\nthat book\nis because\nuh\ni was i'll just be brutally honest with\nyou about um you know being raised with\nmy religion and all that stuff um\nand here's the thing no matter what you\nbelieve in it's cool of me like it's\nit's all\nyou know whether you're\nyou know catholic christian whether\nyou're jewish whether you're muslim you\nknow whatever it is that you might be i\nknow there's a lot of different\nreligions whether you're just spiritual\ni think that all of them are right in\nsome sort of way you know all of them is\nto get you to\ngod whatever you might say and that's a\nthe even the phrase god for a long time\nwas hard for me to speak and i'll tell\nyou why in just a second\nbut um\nthey're all\nit's like they're all ice cream\njust different flavors all of them get\nyou to god hopefully\num just different flavors of how to get\nthere now you know some people be like\noh but mine's right and theirs is wrong\nand mine's right and theirs is wrong\nwhatever cool believe whatever you want\nto believe but once again just try to\nsee something from other people's\nperspective and have them change your\nopinion if it's possible don't be so set\nin your ways you know be open to change\nor to at least other people's opinions\nyou don't have to change your opinion at\nall\nbut when i was raised catholic\ni know a lot of people that are\nrecovering catholics\na lot it seems like uh i always felt\nlike\ni'm just this is cool these are these\nanswering these questions is cool\nbecause i'm being brutally freaking\nhonest like i'm saying stuff i've never\ntalked about before so um we're gonna\nkeep doing this and you know it is\nlonger we're already at like 24 25 26\nminutes something like that but we're\ngoing to keep going um\nbecause this is fun i want to keep doing\nthis with you guys and uh and so\nbasically uh and let's do this if you\nwant to ask me questions email me rd rob\ndial dot com\nso email me rd like rob dial rd rob\ndial.com ask me questions um and then\ni'll finish answering this question so\num rd robdial.com is weird to email the\nbetter your question the better my\nanswer so don't give me an entire life\nstory um send me an email or send me a\nvideo that's you know 30 seconds or less\nwhich would be cool as well actually\nsend me a video 30 seconds or less to my\nemail the better your question the\nbetter my email uh the better my answer\nwill be um so\ni always felt\ni always felt being raised catholic\nthat i was terrified\nand the reason why was because i felt\nlike and this is not me bashing you know\ncatholics in any sort of way this is\njust my opinion of the way that i saw\nthe way i was raised you know all of\nthis stuff\num i always felt like i had to be\nscared into believing in god\nthat's the way that i saw it and for\ni'll take you on my my journey of\nspirituality and god i guess as we go\ndeeper into it so\num\nso i always felt that i was terrified i\nremember seeing a um\na meme one time it was a you know a\nsketch and it was two escalators one of\nthem was going up and the other one was\ngoing down and it said you know there\nwas a sign that said choose your path\nand one of them said to god and the\nother one said to hell and i felt like\nmy entire childhood i was always worried\nabout every single decision that i was\nmaking because i was terrified i was\nmaking the wrong decision and god was\nwatching me at all point in time\nand if i screwed up i was done i was\ngoing to hell and it was this terrible\nplace that i would stay forever it\nscared me and the reason why i was so\nmessed up from it was because\nevery time i read the bible or heard\nthe uh\nthe priest talk he talked about how much\ngod loved me\nand i had this internal struggle of if\ngod loves me so much\nwhy\nwould i be forced to in like damnation\nlike why is it either i if something\nloves me so much why would it force me\nto\nbe screwed from the second like i was\nborn with original sin according to what\nthey're saying and so i really struggled\nbecause what what i always felt was god\num didn't feel\nright to me it didn't feel it\nit felt\nlike the god that was what it was that\nwas talked about to me\nwas a lot scarier than what it truly was\nand so i've so you know i stopped going\nto church in my teenage years i went\nback to church i found a place that i\nliked and i went back to church for a\nlittle while\nmainly because i connect with a preacher\nand i like you know playing guitar and i\nplay guitar in their band there's a few\nthousand people that were there every\nsingle weekend so that was kind of a\ncool thing and then i got out of it and\ni almost became like atheist for a\nlittle while of like ah when we die we\nbecome worm food right and um\ni was that way for a few years and i\nstarted if i'm honest with you i started\ngetting a little bit more spiritual\nthrough meditation and through all that\nand um i started getting spiritual\nthrough meditation through growing and\nlearning and i started doing\npsychedelics and i did psychedelics and\ni was like oh my god\ni\ni don't get it but i unders i feel it\nlike i feel the whole thing of the\nconnection of god in the universe and\nall those things when before a couple\nyears prior i was like you know all of\nthis stuff is just random right it just\nthings grew things happened over\nbillions of years but then i like felt\nlike i was like close to god and i could\ntalk to god i was like right there and\nit's i know it sounds crazy i get it but\njust be open-minded when i talk about\nthis\nand uh and then i read conversation with\ngod and i was like oh my god\nliterally this is\nthe god that i've always felt was behind\nthe scenes of all of the religions and\ndogma and all of the rituals and things\nyou have to do like behind all that was\nthis this\nentity this thing and so\nyou know that's a really long answer\nthat i went way off course but i wanted\nto tell you guys like things that i've\nnever told you before because i think\nthis is fun and so conversation with god\nwas really eye opening for me and it\nchanged a lot of stuff for me because i\nwas like oh\ni feel like this is the god that i've\nalways thought existed so\nthose are the three books that i would\nrecommend number one uh think of rich by\nnapoleon hill number two is the one\nthing and number three is conversation\nwith\ngod next question says do you believe\ngreat because i'm just going to keep\ngoing like let's just keep going you\nknow if you're bored of me\ngo to another episode that's cool you\nwon't offend me but if you guys want to\nroll with it let's roll with it you guys\nare my rider dies i understand it we're\ndrinking the same kool-aid let's do it\num\ndo you believe in aliens is the next\nquestion and the answer is yes uh i do\nbelieve in aliens have they ever been to\nearth before i don't know maybe maybe\nnot uh\nbut\nprobably maybe they might even be living\naround us right now right like that's\nthe crazy thing like aliens could be\nliving around us it could be another\nperson like another human that you know\nthat's what's kind of that's kind of\ncrazy isn't it think about that for a\nsecond like maybe an alien is someone\nthat you know\nthat's something that's kind of i like\nto think about really crazy out there\nstuff when i sit quietly and think about\nmyself maybe it's somebody that i know\nmaybe someone i know is an alien they've\ncome\nto give me a lesson oh that would be\ncool right so there's that\nmaybe aliens are some animals have you\never seen some of the animals on this\nearth have you ever seen a freaking\noctopus have you ever seen what an\noctopus can do an octopus has eight\nbrains that's some crazy [ __ ] right like\njust think about that for a second\nwhat\nit has eight brains one for each leg\ni mean they change colors they're super\nintelligent they're i mean they could be\naliens i don't know\nbut i think that somewhere if you look\nat if you want to have if you want to\nhave your mind\nblown like completely open one video\nthat i want you to look up is called the\num\ni think it's called the largest photo\never taken\nphoto\nlargest photo ever taken by nasa\nand uh it is it has 20 yeah if you if\nyou google or youtube largest photo ever\ntaken it is it pops up it's got 23\nmillion views right now it's called\ngigapixels of andromeda\nand if you watch this video you'll\nrealize how many billions not even\nbillions trillions and trillions of\nstars and galaxies and planets there are\nand just statistically speaking there's\ngot to be something else that's out\nthere like just there's got to be\nsomething\nright if you talk billions and trillions\nand trillions and trillions like beyond\nwhat you can possibly\nfathom\nthere's something out there there's got\nto be that's just my opinion but hey\nyou might have a different one\nthat's pretty cool though who asks what\nis what the hell does that have to do\nwith anything it has nothing to do with\nthe mindset mentor do i believe in\naliens i do\nuh and i think that i think that if\nhumans\nyou want me you want to go down a little\nbit deeper this i think that if humans\nget to the point where we're about to\ndestroy ourselves i honestly think that\naliens could step in and save us from\ndestroying ourselves\ni think that if an alien is here\nthey are way more intelligent than us\nand they're not going to be here to kill\nus they're going to be here to save us\nthink about that one for a little while\ntoday\nnext one says if you could change one\nthing in the world what would it be\nmore empathy\nthat would be would it be i kind of\nanswered that in the last question not\nthe last question but earlier in the\nquestion um\njust seeing things from another person's\nperspective just having more empathy\ngiving someone a hug\nmore love man like just\nmore love\nwhat's the biggest accomplishment that\nyou've made so far\num\ni would say biggest accomplishment\nthat's kind of a really cool one is\nuh once we passed a billion views on\nfacebook uh so we hit over a billion\nviews between all the videos that i've\nmade\num\nand it took about two and a half years i\nthink we're almost at about two billion\nviews now i haven't checked but once we\nhit that i was like wow\njust to just to think\nlike even just to think about it right\nnow blows my mind like a billion\nviews like a billion people there's only\n7.5 billion people on the planet that\nmeans there's a i mean obviously people\nhave seen my videos a couple times so\nthat doesn't really count but just to\nthink\nof a billion humans watching something\nthat i've\nmade like that\nthat's freaking crazy\nso i think that that's really cool where\ndo you see yourself 10 years from now\num\nyou want me to be honest with you\ni've gotten to a point in my life where\ni've set a lot of goals i've failed at\ngoals i've succeeded at goals\ni've done well i've done bad i've done\nall of those things\ni do believe that setting goals are\nsuper important for people and i spent\n14 years of my life being hardcore\ninvested in the goals now what i'm\ntrying to do is to try to actually take\naway\nand stop focusing on goals um and to\nkind of just go with the flow of the\nuniverse and all of these you know these\nwoo-woo things that i talk about um so\nwhere do i see myself in ten years\num\ndoing what i'm doing now but probably on\na bigger scale um\ni'll probably have written a couple\nbooks that's the next thing that i'm\nworking on uh is writing a book\ni have i go with my gut feelings on\neverything that i do\nand um\ni don't care to write a book i honestly\ndon't care to write a book at all if i'm\nbeing 100 honest with you like i don't\neven like writing\num\nbut from a non-ego perspective\num i will be honest with you um i'm\ngoing to write a book and i feel like i\ndon't know if it's going to be the first\none the second one whatever it is i\nthink that it will make a massive impact\nin the world and this is from a\ntrying to take my ego out as much as i\npossibly can i just feel like the stuff\nthat i teach\nwhich i haven't even shared on my\npodcast which is what's crazy um the\nstuff that i teach and like my close\ngroups and the courses that i teach and\nstuff um\nis so\nadvanced and out there that i don't know\nanybody else that's teaching it but when\npeople understand it i feel like it\nchanged their life like when people go\nthrough and they watch the first four\nlessons that i have they're like holy\n[ __ ]\ni didn't even know you taught anything\nlike this so\num you know my podcast is great like i\nlove the podcast i love making these\naudios for you guys to listen to on the\npodcast i love making the videos for you\nguys to watch on facebook and youtube\nand instagram\nbut um\nit's more for the masses like it's it's\nkind of like 101 like person involvement\n101 102 103. um\nthe book that i'm going to write is like\npersonal development 601\nso\ni think that the book is probably a big\nthing i think 10 years from now\num\ni have this thing where i i\ni'll be honest with you i\nknow\nhow big\nwhat and this is not from an ego\nstandpoint i know how big it feels like\nmy mission is is going to be\nand it's so big it kind of scares the\n[ __ ] out of me but and and here's the\nthing that i'll say though just because\nit scares me doesn't mean that i won't\ndo it like i will 100 do it um i will\n100 stay on this path um it scares me\nto have to become more public and more\nout\nin facing the public and in growing\nbecause\nyou know when you look at\nit's it's it's kind of nuts if i'm being\nhonest with you of growing a following\nof 2.5 million people like that's\nthat's scary like it literally is scary\nsorry i'm moving around a little bit\nbecause i'm in the same position for 30\n40 minutes now\nso my my chair is kind of creaking but\nit's kind of scary um because then you\nstart thinking about personal safety you\nstart thinking about\nbeing seen everywhere like i'm a private\nperson i love being private i don't\nreally you know when people come up to\nme it's cool and i'm like this is\namazing but i couldn't imagine that on a\nmass scale\num\nso\nwhere do i see myself in 10 years um i\njust see myself having a bigger impact\nin the world\ni see it being a massive impact on the\nworld and\nit scares me but i won't let fear\nstop me from what i'm truly supposed to\nbe doing in this world\nthat's the way that i see it\ndo you ever\nget days where you struggle to remain\npositive\num\nto be honest with you no not at this\npoint in my life um i've been working on\nmyself for a long time and\num i i think that if i struggle to\nremain positive it comes from my my lack\nof acceptance to the way that it is like\ni spoke about earlier in this episode\nwhere it's like sometimes you just gotta\nlet go\nwhatever man i'm not in control\nuh the first time i did ayahuasca which\nis a psychedelic from peru i realized\nthat i had a control problem\nand i still\ni mean it still exists but it's probably\n20 of what it was two and a half years\nago three actually three years ago this\nthree years ago last month\nand i just learned to kind of just\naccept just let things go\nwhen you have a control problem\neverything's more stressful everything\ngives you more anxiety all of that stuff\nbut when you\njust accept and let go and know that the\nworld's happening for you and that\neverything will work out\nlike everything will work out like if\nyou think about your entire past\neverything's worked out like you're\nstill here you're still alive you've\nmade it through everything\nand when you just accept and go you know\nwhat i'm just going to let go\nare things going to happen in my life\nthat i don't want yeah\nare things you know are bad things going\ngonna happen yeah are people going to\ndie that i don't want to yeah but\nthat's the beauty of life\nisn't it\nlike it's only beautiful\nthe the great things are only beautiful\nif you go through the crappy things\nlike life is only great\nyou can only appreciate the good if\nyou've been through the bad and so do i\nwant to go through them no but do i know\nthat that\ndo i believe\nthat everything that happens to me is a\nperfectly crafted curriculum for me\nto grow and become the best version of\nmyself yes that's what i personally\nbelieve\nso\ni'm just going to let go\nlet things be the way they're going to\nbe and just trust\nthat everything that happens to me is\nexactly the way it's supposed to be and\nthat it's all\nperfect\nand so i don't really struggle with\nremaining positive because i think that\neven when the shitty stuff happens to me\nit's all done for me it's all part of my\nperfectly correct correct perfectly\nwhat the hell did i just say a minute\nago perfectly\ncrafted\ncrafted curriculum it's my perfectly\ncrafted curriculum and if crappy stuff\nhappens to me that's what was supposed\nto happen to me and\nthat's just the way that i choose to\nlive my life\nso this was fun\ni wasn't expecting to do this but i just\nsaid hey you know what i'm recording\nright like i was literally in the middle\nof recording for those of you guys that\nare watching the video i had my lights\nall on and i was like i didn't plan any\nmore episodes but i kind of want to keep\ntalking clearly because i've been\ntalking for 42 freaking minutes
