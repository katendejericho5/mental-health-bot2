reality\nnow what do i mean by you create your\nown reality well what channel are you\ntuning into every single day let me give\nyou an example if i go in and i go to i\nalways think of when i think of this i\nthink of like an old tv remember the\ntv's used to be able to turn the knobs\nfor some of you older people for young\nbucks you may have never seen these but\nthere used to be tvs where you could\nturn the knob and it would click from\none station to another\nright and whatever station you tune into\nyou're going to pick up that station\nright so if i want to tune into\num\nyou know like i'll just use this as an\nexample if i want to turn into fox news\ni can go to that channel but if i want\nto go to cnn i can go to that channel if\ni want to go to espn i can go to that\nchannel\ni want you to realize that at every\nmoment in time no matter what's going on\nin your life you are tuning in\nto some channel\nand you\nare actually in charge of what channel\nyou're tuning into\nnow this for some of you guys is gonna\nbe like yeah no [ __ ] that makes a lot of\nsense for some of you guys it's gonna be\na giant wake-up call for whoever you are\nthat are out there i'm gonna tell you\nnumber one i'm gonna talk about the\nchannels that you're tuned into and then\nafter that i'm going to teach you how to\nchange the channel if it's not the life\nthat you want so if your current reality\nis not the reality that you want well\nwhich means if you're watching this or\nif you're listening to this\nyou are probably wanting to improve your\nreality right so if you're wanting to\nprove your readout it means you probably\nwant to change it means the only way to\nchange is actually change the channel\nthat you're on so you know for instance\nif i'm sitting there and i want to watch\nsome sports\ni can click it over to espn but i can't\nstay\non national geographic channel and be\nlike why won't i why can't i watch the\nbasketball game why is this not the\nbasketball game is not coming on the\nbasketball dm is not coming on it's not\ncoming on it's not coming on\nand get pissed off that it's not on it\nwhen in reality if i want to watch the\nbasketball game i need to simply change\nthe channel so if i'm miserable\ni need to change my channel to be happy\nif i'm unsuccessful\nand i want to be successful i need to\nchange my channel to the success channel\nif i want more love in my life i need to\nchange my channel you\nliterally create your own reality this\nwhole thing that you're in you're\ncreating it and you may have heard\npeople talk about this before it might\nsound weird and willy of like you create\nyour own reality you literally do create\nyour own reality everything around you\nis a fabric of your\nmindset and what's going on inside of\nyour head\nwhy do i say this well because if you've\nnever heard me talk about the brain\nbefore there's something called the\nreticular activating system inside of\nyour brain the reticular activating\nsystem is a part of your brain\nthat literally filters out everything\nexcept for just this tiny little sliver\nso at any moment in time right now\nyour brain can be taking in up to two\ntrillion bits of information now your\nbrain can't handle that so it filters\nout most of it but two trillion bits of\ninformation\nso if i sit and think about all of the\nthings that are around me i'm just going\nto talk about real quick all the things\nthat are around me that i can see so i\nhave my computer right here i have my\nmic right here i have a camera that's in\nfront of me i have a light that's over\nthere i have two lights that are next to\nme i have the desk that i'm on i've got\neverything that's on the desk i've got\nsticky notes i've got my phone that's\nsitting here with the charger\nthere's a million things that are\nliterally in my line of sight that if i\nwanted to look at and focus on i could\nfocus on but i'm focusing on pretty much\nnone of them because i'm trying to give\nthis message and not think about\nanything else that's just what i can see\nhow about everything that i can hear i\ncan hear the fan in the room i can hear\nthe fan on my light i can hear my voice\nechoing off of the walls i can hear my\ngirlfriend talking downstairs i can hear\nthe the cars passing by outside there's\na million things that i could focus on\non things that i could hear\nnow what if i were focusing on\neverything that i can feel i can feel my\nshirt that i'm wearing i can feel my\nshorts i can feel the seat that i'm in i\ncan feel the desks that my arms are on i\ncan feel the wind just you know the\nlittle bit of the wind from the fan\nbrushing against my face\nthere's trillions of bits of information\nthat could come into your brain at any\nmoment in time\nbut your brain filters out almost all of\nthem\ndo i know how much it goes from 2\ntrillion bits of information\nto 200 bits of information per second\nwhich means that it's focusing it's only\nfocusing on what's relevant to your\nbrain\nand i always use this example because it\nmakes the most sense to people\nif you've ever gone like friends i got a\nnew truck last year\ni didn't notice trucks ever when i had\nbefore i got my truck i got my truck and\ni noticed trucks everywhere literally i\nwas like holy crap where all these\ntrucks coming from now have you ever\ndone that before where you buy a new car\nand you just see that car everywhere\nwhy because your brain is not focusing\non it the reticular activating system is\nfocusing on it and it literally still\nit's still at to this point even though\ni've known about the reticular\nactivating system i've been teaching\nthis for years and years and years it\nstill blows my mind the other day i was\ni was looking at old pictures on\nfacebook i went through someone someone\nthat i know\nfrom high school in middle school died\nand i was looking through his profile\nand out of nowhere i was just looking\nthrough and i was seeing all these\npeople i haven't seen in years and i\nmean years 10 15 years i haven't seen\nthem sometimes even longer for some of\nthem\nthe next day\nliterally about 24 30 hours later maybe\ni'm at the coffee shop that's down the\nstreet from us\nand i'm sitting there and a guy walks by\nwith his dog\nand i immediately went oh my god that's\nryan baldwin what is he doing here in\naustin\nand then he turned and i went oh that's\nnot ryan baldwin and then i went why\ndid my brain think about him i haven't\nseen him in like 16 years\nand then i realized the reason why my\nbrain\nthought it was him was because i saw him\nin a picture the day before and so it\nstill blows my mind the reticular\nactivating system in the way that it\nworks so\nwhy do i give you this story because if\nyou watch the news you will think that\nthe world is imploding\nit's not\nif you watch the if you go to the\nprotests and you're around all the\npeople there at the protest you will be\nseeing that the world is changing and\nyou'll probably have some more um\nmore optimism to the future\nif you go into nature\nyou'll realize that the world is the\nsame than it's always been it's still\ncalm it's still beautiful once you get\naway from all those things\nif you believe\nthat the world is going to [ __ ]\nyou will see all of the ways that the\nworld is going to [ __ ]\nif you believe and you're hopeful that\nwe're going to have a better future and\nyou're hopeful about how beautiful our\nfuture could be you will see all of the\nways\nwhere the world is getting better\nif you're a trump supporter you will see\nall of the things that you think make\nhim great and you'll also see all of the\nthings that you think are making you\nknow the other news stations that are\ntrying to tear him down and maybe the\nfake news or whatever it is\nif you hate trump then you will see all\nof the ways where he screws up and all\nthe ways where you think that he's an\nidiot and you'll see all of the ways\nthat the news stations are trying to\nbuild him up you are creating your\nreality\nthis stuff all around you is all created\nin your mind based off of what you're\ntrying to focus on\nif you have a victim mentality of i am a\nvictim then you will think that\neverything is happening to you and that\nyou are just getting beat up every\nsingle day by the world if you have a\nchampion's mentality you will see that\neverything in the world is happening for\nyou\nit's all what you want to see\nthe question is what\ndo you\nwant to see\nbecause whatever you focus on\nyou will see you will create you are\ncreating your reality it's freaking\nmind-blowing isn't it\nit is when you really start to think\nabout it you create it the question is\nwhat reality do you want to live in\nif you want to continue thinking that\nyou're a victim and that the woe is me\nmentality and everything just happens to\nme and that this world is such a\nnegative place and that god or the\nuniverse or whatever it is hates me and\nmaybe the next life around\nyou're going to find all of the ways\nthat things are negative and everything\nthat's screwed up if you want to search\nfor all the things of the reasons why\nthe life is beautiful you'll find them\nyour brain is like cosmic google it will\nfind whatever you ask it to find\nhow do you focus on what you how do you\nget it to find those things whatever you\nfocus on\nif you want to watch the news\nyou're going to see how the world is\ngoing to crap\nif you walk outside and talk to someone\nyoung\nyou're gonna go wow i'm really hopeful\nfor the future because this young person\nseems to have more empathy than any\nperson that i grew up with\nit's all what you focus on you\ncreate your reality there's trillions of\nbits of information that could come into\nyour brain per second your brain filters\nout everything but 200\nwhat do you\nwant those 200 to be\nsee\nif you want more\nhappiness in your life\nfocus on the things that make you happy\nif you want to be more happy in your\nlife focus on the things that are you\ncan be grateful for in the morning you\nset your articular activating system\nwith everything that you do every\nthought that you have everything that\nyou see everything that you see everyone\nthat you talk to everything that you\nhear everything that you touch you're\nliterally creating this reality are you\nfearful\nwell\nare you\ndo you wake up and you you worry too\nmuch\nit's because that's what you're setting\nyour reticular activating system to look\nfor you're looking for things to be\nafraid of\nare you scared\nif you are you're probably looking for\nthings to be scared of\ndo you have anxiety\nyou're probably searching for things to\nworry about you're you're worrying too\nmuch about the future you're living too\nmuch in the future\nand\nprobably worrying and having anxious\nthoughts about things that never usually\neven happen in the first place\nright\ndo you want more peace\nwell\nwhat would bring you more peace wake up\nevery single morning and ask yourself\nthe question\nwhat would make me feel more peaceful\nwhy don't i focus on bringing those\nthings into my day today\ndo you want more happiness\nlike i said a few episodes ago make a\nlist of all of the things that make you\nhappy and then focus on how you can\nbring as many of those things into your\nday as possible\ndo you want more love\nwhat would make you feel more loved\nwhat do you need to do to feel more love\ndo you need a person or can you find\nlove in yourself can you do things that\nyou love if you were more grateful if\nyou were more happy or do you feel like\nyou'd feel more loved\nbecause here's the thing\nif you don't like your reality it's your\nfault\nyou've created it now i understand for a\nlot of you guys that are listening\nyou've never even thought about this\nbefore but now you're going oh crap this\ndoes make a lot of sense a light bulb's\npopping up\nso you've created your reality that's\nokay no big deal because if you've\ncreated it\nright now based off of past thoughts\nthat means that you can also\ncreate your future based off of present\nthoughts\nand off of other future thoughts\nso if you're trying to change it if you\nwant to feel happier\nif you want to feel more peace if you\nwant to feel more grateful if you want\nto think about how beautiful life is why\ndon't you wake up every single morning\nand set your reticular activating system\noff of what you feel that you want\ni'll be honest with you i woke up the\nother day and i went on to face or if\nwas it facebook instagram i don't even\nknow which one i was on it was about 15\nminutes i felt like [ __ ] for the next\ncouple hours because i saw the way that\npeople were talking to each other the\nway they were treating each other and\nthe stuff that was going on the news i i\naccidentally set my reticular activating\nsystem to feel like [ __ ] that day\nand so i noticed it a couple hours like\nliterally after it after about 15\nminutes of looking i was like why did i\ndo this to myself i literally just\nwanted to go out and send a text message\nand somehow i got into that infinite\nspiral of social media\nand i noticed oh my god i just set my\nreticular activating system to feel like\ncrap\nwhat can i do to reprogram myself for\nthe day and then so i said okay what\nwould make me feel better listening to a\npodcast reading a book going on to you\nknow youtube and looking at some of my\nmentors and people that maybe i call a\nfriend and have a conversation with them\nrealize the people that you're talking\nto\nare setting your reticular activating\nsystem\ni don't talk to a whole lot of people i\ntalk to a whole lot of people right now\nbut i have a very very small friends\ngroup and the reason why is because i've\ngotten rid of people\nand that sounds wrong gotten rid of\nmakes it sound like i completely got\nthem out of my life i don't talk to very\nmany people throughout the day there's\nonly a few people and the reason why is\nbecause those people set my reticular\nactivating system\nto have the life that i want to have\nit's a small circle i talk to my best\nfriend dean every single day at least\nonce a day two to three four times a day\nsometimes we talk throughout the day why\nbecause we've been pushing each other\nfor 14 years to create the lives that we\nwant there's very few people that you\ncan do that with so if you have someone\nthat's in your life that's negative ask\nyourself are they setting my reticular\nactivating system to a place that i\ndon't want it to be at\nand if they are how can i spend less\ntime with them and start spending time\nwith people who would actually make me\npositive who are pushing me who are\nmotivating who make me want to be better\nbecause ultimately every single bit of\ninformation all five of your senses\nare setting your reticular activating\nsystem in some sort of way it is\ncreating your reality you are creating\neverything that you see around you this\ngiant video game simulation\nright that's what it basically is\nyou're setting it but now you can't act\nlike you're not\nnow that you know you can never unknow\nit once you see it you can't unsee it\nnow you've seen it\nthey always say when you're in the jar\nyou can't read the label you've been in\nthe jar for a long time probably let's\ntake you out of the jar now you've seen\nthe label and now you know that you have\nto change your reality to what you want\nto be so if you want to create the life\nthat you want to create\nyou\nare creating it based off of what you\nfocus on\nthe question is\nwhat do you need to focus on and what do\nyou need to stop\nfocusing on\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well one of\nthe things that i realized is that i\nbelieve that psychedelics will change\nthe world and if i have such a large\nplatform why in the hell would i not\ntalk about it"
