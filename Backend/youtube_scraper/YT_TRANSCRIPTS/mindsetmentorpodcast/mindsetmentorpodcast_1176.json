going to be negative\nthat's just a fact\n[Music]\nwelcome to today's episode of the\nmindset mentor podcast i'm your host rob\ndyle and today we're going to be talking\nabout how to stay out of negativity in\nhow to get into positivity based off of\nthe things that you're doing thinking\nand obviously the information that\nyou're consuming\nso if you're listening to last episode\nthat i put out where i talk about the\nworld is feeling really heavy right now\nthat to me is very obvious and you know\nhow do we if we feel these heavy\nthoughts how do we lighten the load so\nthat we feel better because ultimately\nwe don't want to stay feeling heavy or\ndepressed or sad all day long\nwe want to try to lighten the load and\nmake ourselves feel better so that we\ncan go out there and serve the world at\na higher you know with our higher\npurpose that we truly want to go after\nand it comes down to what you focus on\nand if you've been listening to me for a\nwhile you've heard me talk about what\nyou focus on matters you can't i always\ncan say that the the mind is like a\ngarden you can't go into a garden and\nplant strawberry seeds and expect that\nsomehow tomatoes are going to grow the\nsame way that you can't focus on\nnegativity and all of the negative stuff\nhappening all day every day and just\nexpect that you're going to feel\npositive if you just focus on the\nnegativity you're never going to feel\npositive it's negative seeds that go\ninto your mind are going to obviously\ncreate negative trees negative plants is\na way of thinking of it now let me be\nvery clear though uh what i am not\nsaying is not to be informed i'm not\nsaying that i'm not saying be completely\nignorant and naive to what's happening\nin the world um and not pay attention to\nit that is the that is not what i'm\nsaying that's the exact opposite of what\ni'm saying but what i'm saying is to be\nvery very clear of to what you do want\nto consume\nso your mind you know consume whether\nyou see whether you talk about something\nwhether you hear something what you're\nconsuming into your mind\nso that therefore you can have the\noutput that you really want so the input\nis going to create the output if you're\nfocusing on all of the input your input\nis just negative negative negative\nnegative the output of the way that you\nthink and the way that you feel all day\nlong is going to be negative that's just\na fact and so i'm going to give you a\ncouple of tips and we're going to talk\nabout some things that you should really\nthink about and be very clear of the\nfirst thing if i'm going to give you a\nreally big tip\ntry to stay off the social media as much\nas possible right now um and i don't\nmean once again don't be informed if you\nneed to be informed through social media\nplease do but don't accidentally end up\non you know\nnancy's facebook and she's just talking\na whole bunch of crap and reading\nthrough all of that crap and then\nreading through all of her comments and\npeople back and forth and yelling at\neach other makes you feel like crap uh\nif you feel that way then i don't want\nyou to go on to nancy's facebook or\naccidentally see her posts uh one thing\nthat i will 100 recommend for you is\nthat you know exactly what you want to\nbe on if you're going to be on social\nmedia you're going to go to exactly\nwhatever it is that you want versus just\nscrolling through and seeing number one\nwhat people are posting but number two\nthe comments stay away from the comments\nbecause that's just where you really\nstart to feel bad and you start seeing\npeople say stuff and the things that\nthey're saying and the you know how\nignorant and naive some people can be\nand then you just start thinking about\nall day i spent literally the other\nmorning like five minutes on social\nmedia and i felt like crap for like the\nnext two or three hours and i was like\nman i need to be really cognizant of\nwhat i'm doing on social media and be\nvery diligent that if i'm gonna be on it\ni'm not just scrolling and accidentally\ncoming across people's stuff\nthat\nare just ignorant in some ways you know\nignorant and naive because some people\njust can't see other people's sides of\nthe story they have their own opinion\nthey stick to it and then they won't\nsee life from other people's viewpoints\nyou know and so if you're going to be on\nsocial media try to stay on social media\nthe way that you want to be on it versus\njust accidentally coming across stuff in\nand please don't look in the comments\nsection that's where you don't want to\ni've never seen somebody be like you\nknow what i'm really glad that i read\nthrough all of those comments well i'm\nreally glad i'm god i'm glad i got into\nthat bickering match on somebody's\nfacebook post please don't do that so\nthe first thing is stay away from social\nmedia as much as you possibly can second\nthing try to stay away from the news as\nmuch as you possibly can because here's\nthe thing that i do know is that the\nnews sensationalizes evil it makes takes\nall of the evil and all of the bad and\nit puts it out there and the reason why\nis because the human mind\nconcentrates on negative and they know\nin the re let me just talk to you real\nquick about why the human mind\nconcentrates on negative the reason why\nis because if you go back hundreds of\nthousands of years 20 40 50 000 years\nwhen we were hunters and gatherers we\nhad to remember the negative things we\nhad to remember where our friend was\nkilled by a lion so therefore we\nwouldn't go past that place again\nwe had to know you know what type of\nberries our friend john ate you know i'm\nsure there wasn't a guy named john 50\n000 years ago but we had to remember\nwhat berries he ate so that therefore we\ndidn't remember it again so we needed to\nremember the negative because the\nnegative staying thinking about it kept\nus alive but nowadays it's it just makes\nyou feel bad you know you don't have to\nworry about being attacked by a\nsaber-toothed tiger or by eating the\nwrong berries from whole foods so\ntherefore obviously\nwhen when the news knows this is how\nhuman psychology works they're going to\nput out the negative because then you're\ngoing to watch the negative because you\nneed to focus on it that animalistic\npart of your brain wants to focus on the\nnegative\nand so they always put out the negative\nthe more people that watch the more\nmoney that they make off of their ads in\nthe that's the way that they make their\nmoney\noff of all of the ads everything they\nput out there so the news will\nconcentrate and sensationalize the bad\nand the evil so if you want to feel\nbetter\nstay away from the news that's a huge\ntip i'm going to give you\nanother thing i'll tell you as well\nstay away from negative people like if\nyou know that your uncle sam is that's\nfunny that i use that uncle sam if you\nknow that your uncle sam is the guy who\nloves to talk about the negative or\nabout the conspiracy theories or he's a\nbig supporter of someone that you're not\na supporter of and every time you talk\nto him you feel like then don't\ntalk to him stay away from him i'm not\nsaying you got to kick him out of the\nfamily if you love him but there are\njust some people in your life that you\nshould probably spend a little bit less\ntime with because it makes you feel\nbetter when you're not around them so if\nyou're around somebody that makes you\nfeel bad\nafter you're done with them after you're\ndone hanging out with them you don't\nwant to be around them anymore so why\ndon't you just try to stay away from\npeople like that as much as possible and\nwhat you're really trying to do is\nyou're trying to create your own bubble\nand in this bubble you are in control of\nall of the stuff that comes into your\nmind everything that you see hear feel\nevery single aspect of your life you're\ncreating your own bubble for you to go\nout and be the best version of yourself\nbecause if you're the best version of\nyourself you're going to be able to\ncreate a better environment and be able\nto impact the world and other people\naround you as well so create your own\nlittle bubble so you know what are you\nlistening to are you happening to listen\nto you know positive podcasts like this\nand you know going on to youtube and\nlistening to things that are positive\nand you know having conversations and\nwho are you hanging out with who are you\nlistening to so who are you listening to\non the internet on tv through everything\nthat you listen but also who are you\nhanging out with that you're also\nlistening to because every single person\nwhether you're physically in front of\nthem or they're just talking to you when\nyou're listening to them or you're\nlistening to a conversation\nwill dictate the way that you actually\nfeel\nfor instance i know that we've all\nlistened to\nsomething maybe it popped up on the news\nmaybe it popped up on a podcast i don't\nknow and you listen to it and it makes\nyou feel worse hearing about it right\nbut then you've also listened to\nsomething before where you listen to it\nand when it gets done you're like man\ni'm fired up i feel good about myself i\nwant to go out and do some good in the\nworld i want to go out and do something\nwith my life\nwouldn't you rather feel the second way\nexcited fired up wanting to go out and\ndo something with your life versus\nhearing something and it bringing you\ndown\nthat's just by what you're hearing so\nwhat are you listening to who are you\nlistening to you know another thing is\nwhat are you watching\nare you watching you know all of the\nstuff and reading all the stuff in the\ncomments and the news feeds and all\nthose things or are you taking time\ngoing on to youtube and focusing on\nthings that you know\nyou will\nfeel better after listening to them or\nyou'll feel more excited or you feel\nmore educated or you're learning the\ngreat thing about being alive right now\nis that there is so much information at\nyour fingertips in this very second you\ncan literally pick up your phone and\nlearn anything that you want to right\nnow\nso why don't you go and actually be in\ncharge of the things that you're\nlearning every single day what are you\nreading are you reading through the\nnewspapers are you reading through the\ncomments or are you sitting down with a\nbook that you want to read and you're\nyou're actually being very diligent on\nyou know what i do want to read this\nbook i do want to read a book that's\ngoing to make me feel better and i'm\ngoing to feel like i learned something\nand i'm actually progressing\nand i'm taking my mind to the mental gym\nso therefore when i'm done i'm stronger\nmentally and i'm able to go conquer the\nworld and help everyone around me and\nhelp my community\nyou know so what are you listening to\nwho are you hanging out with what are\nyou watching what are you reading once\nagain i want to be very clear i'm not\nsaying don't be uninformed i'm just\nsaying make sure that you're not\nconforming so don't be uninformed but\ndon't conform to other people in what\nthey want from you make sure that you're\ncreating your own bubble of what you\nwant to learn of what you want to be a\npart of what you believe in and whatever\nyou feel from your heart is what you're\nsupposed to be doing is what you're\nsupposed to be doing so how often are\nyou listening to\nis that is this what i'm supposed to be\ndoing right now or could i be doing\nsomething better for myself could i be\nlearning something better for myself\nonce again not saying don't be informed\na hundred percent be informed but make\nsure that you're very diligent of\ncreating the bubble that fosters the\nmindset the life the reality that you\nwant to create\nand as i said in the last episode the\nworld needs leaders\nso much right now so what i want you to\nthink about is what i'm watching\nlistening to reading who i'm hanging out\nwith are they creating me into being the\nleader that i want to be or are they\nholding me back\nand making me stay in the same place\nbecause of fear all of the\nfear-mongering that's out there or\nbecause i don't feel motivated when i\nread through the comment section because\nthe better that you are the better that\nyou will be able to go out and serve the\nworld that's the most important thing\nthe one thing that i know about humans\ni've worked with tens of thousands of\nhumans over the years is that we feel\nthe best we feel the most alive when we\nare impacting other people's hearts when\nwe're impacting other people we're\nlooking at somebody and no matter how\nmuch you don't have to go out and impact\nmillions of people's lives but if you go\nout and impact one person's life today\nor tomorrow or this week you're making a\ndifference\nyou're making a change\nbut you can't give away what you don't\nhave\nif you have a cup that's not filled up\nyou can't help somebody else so you've\ngot to fill your your your cup up first\nand i want you to do this i have an\nassignment for you if you're up to it i\nwant you to take a pen and paper and ask\nyourself three questions three questions\nthree simple simple questions and i\nlearned this from p diddy way back in\nthe day when he used to have a tv show\nthat was called uh what's it called\nmaking a band and he did this thing\ncalled stop start continue and i started\ndoing this years ago like 14 years ago\nwhen i was running teams and i would\nhave my team to come together and we\nwould go over this and stop start\ncontinue is three simple questions and i\nwant you to write them down and answer\nthem and ask yourself how you can take\nthese three simple questions and put\nthem into your life and implement\nwhatever you get from answers that\nyou're about to answer here\nso number one is what do i need to stop\ndoing after listening to this episode\nwhat do i need to stop\ndoing\nmaybe i need to stop scrolling through\nmy facebook news feed and looking at all\nof the people yelling at each other and\nbashing each other and not listening to\neach other and throwing out their\nopinions in the comments what do i need\nto stop\ndoing make a list of things you need to\nstop doing second thing what do i need\nto start doing you know what i need to\nstart doing i need to start replacing my\nsocial media time with reading a really\ngood book that i've been wanting to read\nthat's what i need to start doing and\nwhat do i need to continue doing i've\nbeen doing a really good job at waking\nup in the morning and going through my\nmorning routine and focusing on my\nmeditation i need to continue with my\nmeditation\nbecause it helps me start the day off\nright\nso what do i need to stop doing what do\ni need to start doing and what do i need\nto continue doing and you take the\nanswers to those three\nquestions and all you do is you look at\nyour schedule and say okay where can i\nstart doing this where can i take out\nthese things i need to stop doing and\nwhere can i make sure i continue doing\nthese things\nlife is not that hard it's actually very\nsimple we make it much more complicated\nthan it needs to be so think about that\nwhat do i need to stop doing what do i\nneed to start doing and what do we need\nto continue doing because ultimately if\nyou're listening to this or if you're\nwatching this however you're consuming\nthis\nright here\nyou're a leader in the world you're\nlistening to this because you're a\nleader in some capacity\ni want to help you\nbecome the leader that you deserve to be\nand that the world needs and in order to\ndo that you need to be very very clear\non what you need to stop doing what you\nstart doing what you need to continue\ndoing and work on creating yourself to\nbe the best that you possibly can be\nbecause once again the better that you\nare the better that you can serve the\nworld\nso that's what i got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode
