    "transcript": "look i know he cheated on you but you\nhave to remember this it's not your\nfault\nif he cheated on you then he just wasn't\nright for you do you know how i know\nthat because if he truly loved you he\nwould never put himself in a position to\nhurt you and listen i understand how you\nfeel i've been there but when someone\ncheats on you the natural thing to think\nis it's my fault there must have been\nsomething wrong with me or there must\nhave been something that i did wrong but\nyou got to know that you didn't do\nanything wrong\nin fact the phrase that fits perfectly\nhere is that it's not you it's him\nbecause the whole thing is his fault\nand it's important that you stop blaming\nyourself\nit's time to stop feeling like there was\nsomething that you could have done to\nprevent this from happening\nyou know you need to realize that you\nare enough and that you got to stop\nfeeling like you're not enough because\nof it and i know it's hard to see now\nbut one day you'll look back on this\nmoment\nand actually see that it was a blessing\nin disguise because you no longer have\nto waste any more of your precious time\nwith a shady person\nbecause his dishonesty was present in\nyour relationship way before he ever\ncheated on you\nyou have to believe and know that you\ndeserve better\nand guess what he made it really easy on\nyou by finally showing you his true\ncolors so you know try to be grateful\nthat this happened because\nyou no longer have to spend time with\nsomebody that you put first but someone\nthat puts you second you no longer have\nto give 100 to someone who only gives\nyou 60.\nyou no longer have to feel like you are\nnot enough\nsimply because you're not getting all\nthat you deserve\nyou have to stop settling for someone\nwho loves you sometimes who appreciates\nyou sometimes or who shows you that they\ncare\nsometimes and if you miss him remember\nthis\nit's important not to go back to what\nbroke you don't text him when you're\nlonely\ndon't give him the chance to hurt you\nagain\nbecause now you can go out and you can\nfind someone who values you all of the\ntime\nand i understand that being cheated on\nis super hard but believe me you'll look\nback on this moment\nand you'll realize that this is\nsomething that you're grateful for\nbecause no relationship is ever a\nfailure\nyou can learn from every single one of\nthem\nyou can know what you do want but more\nimportantly you now know what you don't\nwant in a relationship\nyou know how you don't want to be\ntreated you know what you won't put up\nwith you know how you want to be valued\nand you know that you are worth more\nthan he gave you\nand you no longer have to settle\nfor anything less than a guy that gives\nyou 100\nall of the time so\nplease don't think that him cheating on\nyou was your fault because that's not\ntrue\nit's definitely not that you weren't\ngood enough for him\nit's that he wasn't good enough for you\nso remember that\n[Music]\nyou"
