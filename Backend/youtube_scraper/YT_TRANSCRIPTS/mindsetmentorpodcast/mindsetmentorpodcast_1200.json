    "transcript": "what if i told you that one of the most\nimportant lessons that you can ever\nlearn about life you can learn from a\nlobster\nnow see what most people don't know is\nthat a lobster is actually a really soft\nanimal that lives inside of a hard shell\ncalled an exoskeleton and this\nexoskeleton does not grow\nso eventually the lobster will have to\nphysically break out of its own shell\nand it knows that it's time because it\nstarts to get extremely uncomfortable in\nits current shell so it goes inside of a\nrock hides from predators breaks out of\nits shell and regrows another larger\nshell and each time it goes through this\nprocess it actually becomes more\ndifficult to break through its shell\nbecause the new shell is harder than the\nolder shell was\nand this is an extremely stressful\nprocess for the lobster to have to go\nthrough and the lobster is one of the\nfew animals in the world that never\nstops growing until the day it dies so\nit does this over and over again\nso the stimulus for growth for a lobster\nis discomfort and stress\nnow if lobsters had doctors like humans\ndo they go to the doctor say hey doc i'm\nstressed out all the time i also feel\nuncomfortable the doctor would say hey\nno worries here's some pills take those\nand you'll feel better and the lobster\nwould never grow\nsee this is how growth works for us as\nwell for us to grow we must sometimes go\nthrough some stressful things\nwe might have to be uncomfortable and\nbreak out of our shell every once in a\nwhile\nbut every time we do we grow and we\nbecome stronger and more resilient in\nthe process\nand that makes it harder to break us\nthe next time and if more stress comes\nwe must fight through it knowing that\nwe'll grow and will become stronger on\nthe other side\nthink about this for a second what was\nthe hardest time in your life\ni bet it was hard i bet it was stressful\ni bet you didn't want to go through it\nbut here you are\nstronger on the other side more\nresilient having gone through it it made\nyou who you are today\nso next time you go through something\nthat's really hard know that you'll be\nokay you'll get through it and it'll all\nwork out in the end it always does\nand you'll come out stronger on the\nother side\nso just remember\nbe like the lobster\ndon't run from the hard times break\nthrough them\nand until the day you die\nnever stop\ngrowing\n[Music]\nhey everybody thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you loved it\nplease do me a favor hit that share\nbutton down below so that more people\ncan get more messages like this and if\nyou want to follow along you can go\nahead and follow my page i have new\nvideos that come out every single week\nbut until then i appreciate you and i\nhope that you guys have a great day"
