    "transcript": "visualization is one of the most\noverlooked things that i think that we\nhave that's a free tool that we use\nevery single day and there's a part of\nyour brain called the reticular\nactivating system which anybody ever\nbought a card and you never see the car\nbut then you buy it and you see it\neverywhere right anybody had that happen\nbefore\nwell there's billions of bits of\ninformation that are coming into our\nbrains or could come into our brains at\nany point in time there's everything you\nsee here feel touch taste smell\nbut your brain is filtering out\nliterally everything except for 200 bits\nper second so it's filtering out\nbillions of bits of information every\nsingle second as you guys are sitting\nhere so the power of visualization the\nreason why i think it's so important is\nbecause of the fact that you're training\nyour brain what to look for on the path\nto whatever it is you're trying to get\nso\nthe way i like to explain is three\npoints it's like a gps you get into your\ncar you put in the destination and your\ncar will get you to the destination\nright sometimes there's detours\nsometimes things will come up but your\ngps that's how it works and that's\nwhat's designed to do so there's three\npoints that you want to think about with\nvisualization and it's gps goal is the\nfirst thing path is the second thing and\nscreen is the third thing so your goal\nwhat is the goal that you're working\ntowards what are you trying to get to\nthat's usually the clearest part of it\nyou know what you want and deep down\nsome of you might be you might be\nputting down goals that are lower than\nyou actually want because you don't want\nto be disappointed\ndon't do that go for the goal that you\nactually really want and so that's the\ngoal that you're going to think about\nthat's the first thing\nthe path is the second part that's the\none that's a little bit fuzzy when you\nget in your car it might say you're\ngoing to go this way but then you look\nand you realize there's a detour there's\na crash i've got to go a different way\nyou hit the detour button the path is a\nlittle bit different and with the screen\nthe way you want to think of it is this\nif a movie's playing right you want to\nsee the movie of your future every\nsingle morning and so when you know what\nyour goal is of what you want to do with\nyour life you have a rough idea of what\nthe path is then all you need to do is\nremind yourself of it every single\nmorning and then see the movie the\nscreen every single morning for 10\nminutes and it's that simple so as\nyou're going through this process and\nyou start to get those feelings of i'm\nnot enough though i can't i can't get\nthat big goal and you want to go a\nlittle bit lower don't allow yourself to\ngo lower allow yourself to be dream as\nbig as you possibly can and think as big\nas you possibly can and see that goal as\nif you were actually there and what's\ngoing to happen is your brain is going\nto activate the reticular activating\nsystem and people places things\nopportunities will start to come into\nyour life because your brain's not going\nto filter them out anymore right you're\ngoing to start to see the people that\nyou need to make the connections with\nyou're going to see the opportunities\nthat will get you to that goal and your\nlife will start to fall into place and\nthis is why people are so obsessed the\nlaw of attraction how does it work it's\nno super crazy thing the law of\nattraction is your brain not filtering\nout the opportunities in the people and\nthe places and everything that can get\nyou to the goal that you were trying to\nget to in your life so as you're going\nthrough this process as you're\nvisualizing today and every single day\nallow yourself to think big see the path\nas it starts to change but then remind\nyourself of the movie screen every\nsingle day as you're doing it and if you\ndo this every single day you will notice\nthe future that you dreamed the big\nlofty goals that seemed impossible will\njust somehow start finding themselves\nlike literally finding their way into\nyour life\n[Music]\nhey thanks so much for watching and\nsharing this video if you want to learn\nhow to develop your own iron mind join\nmy 60 day iron mind challenge over the\ncourse of 60 days myself and a group of\npeople are going to be challenging\nourselves every single day to grow\nourselves into the person that we want\nto become so if you want to join in on\nthis free challenge go to ironmine60.com\nand get all the information there but\nuntil the next video i appreciate you\nand i hope that you all have an amazing\nday"
