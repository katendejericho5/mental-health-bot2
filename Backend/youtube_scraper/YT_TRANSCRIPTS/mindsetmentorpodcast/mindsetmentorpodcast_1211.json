morning routine and\nhow it's going to help you in your life\nbefore we dive into today's video though\nif you want to go ahead and keep up with\nall the videos i put out i put out new\nvideos every single week make sure you\nhit that subscribe button and then right\nnext to it hit that little bell so that\nyou get notified whenever i put out new\nvideos also comment down below where in\nthe world you're watching this video\nfrom because we have people from all\nover the world and i love to see where\nour community is\nokay so if we're diving into how to\ncreate the perfect morning routine the\nbest way to start is to dive into the\nbook called the miracle morning which is\nwritten by my good friend hal elrod this\nbook has sold over a million copies and\nit is self-published if that doesn't\ntell you how successful this book is i\ndon't know what will because the most\npeople who put out published books\nthrough big publishing companies don't\nget anywhere near a million copies howe\nmade this book on his own published it\non his own and sold over a million\ncopies of it so we're going to dive into\nhis six key points to creating the\nperfect morning routine today and you\nmight be asking why why do i want to\ncreate a morning routine well if you\nlook at the most successful people in\nthe world they have morning routines if\nyou look at richard branson if you look\nat tim cook steve jobs when he was alive\nbut then also if you look at and i don't\nwant to think just successful people as\nfar as money i also want you to realize\nsuccessful people as far as you look at\nthem and they could be happy they could\nbe successful they could be spiritual\nthe pope has a morning routine\nthe dalai lama has a morning routine\nthere's so many people that you would\nsee as successful in life as far as they\nhave great lives whether that's money\nspiritually relationships and they have\na morning routine and you might ask\nyourself why do i want to develop a\nmorning routine that might be the first\nquestion in your head\nwell most of the time what we do is we\nstart our day in reaction mode we wake\nup a few minutes before we have to leave\nand go to the office\nwe shower up real quick we get ready and\nwe're gone and we're starting our day on\nsomeone else's time we're starting our\nday for in reaction mode and we're\nleaving to go to the office or leaving\nto go do something that's on someone\nelse's time\nbut it's nice to wake up and have 30\nminutes\nan hour\ntwo hours just to yourself for your own\npersonal development for whether that's\nmentally whether that's physically it's\nyour own development and starting your\nday on your time maybe before your kids\nwake up maybe before your your spouse\nwakes up maybe before your roommates\nwake up and you have this time to\nyourself\nspecifically designed to work on\nyourself and as we're diving into the\nthe six key points from the book the\nmiracle morning\nthere's an acronym for it it's savers\ns-a-v-e-r-s\nso when you're trying to create the\nperfect morning routine there's six\ndifferent things that you can put into\nyour morning routine now in the book he\nrecommends that you do 10 minutes for\neach of these things for each one of\nthem\ns-a-v-e-r-s ten minutes for each one of\nthem\nhey you could do ten minutes if you want\nto or i recommend if you look at them\nand you say okay out of these six\ni like these three the most\nmaybe you could wake up an hour early\ninstead of spending 10 minutes on each\nof the six maybe you spend 20 minutes on\nthe each of the three that you like the\nmost it's completely up to you it's your\nmorning routine you don't have to rush\nthrough it it's what you want to do\nthat's the the most important thing so\nwhat is the first s stand for it stands\nfor silence\nright so often\nwe wake up we go immediately to our\nphone we start uh getting ready talking\nto people hopping on the internet\nhopping on phone calls going to the\nemails whatever it is the silence can be\nsilenced with your eyes open\nmaybe you're just sitting there enjoying\na cup of coffee on your back porch and\nyou're just giving yourself 10 to 20\nminutes of just sitting\nsilently and just enjoying yourself and\nenjoying your own time and enjoying your\nday\nit could also be meditation this is a\nreally good chance to start meditating\nand meditation is not that hard and this\nthis is not going to be talking about\nhow to meditate but meditation is\nliterally just being alone with yourself\nclosing your eyes in it doesn't have to\nbe you have no thoughts because most\npeople think oh i'm not meditating\ncorrectly that's why i'm not doing it\nit's just taking time to silently be\nwith yourself if you think of when your\nbest ideas come most people say their\nbest ideas come when they're either in\nthe shower or when they're on the toilet\nand sometimes when they're driving their\ncar\nthe reason why is because there's there\nis\na focus\non just doing the task at hand just\nwashing your body right that's if we're\nsaying you're best that he's coming to\nshower well you don't have the internet\nthat's taking up your time you don't\nhave people talking to you you might not\nhave music going and so there's very few\nstimulus coming through and you're just\nthere with your thoughts that's when\nyour best ideas can come through\nwell why don't you create the exact same\nspace in your meditation you can sit\nthere and you know you're not trying to\nstop your thoughts just observe your\nthoughts notice them\nidentify okay that was a thought and\nwhat you'll notice is that as you start\ngetting better at this meditation the\nsilence in the morning some of your best\nideas will start coming through i'll say\nmy best ideas i had an amazing actually\nif i'm being completely honest i\nmeditated as soon as i woke up this\nmorning i had an amazing idea\ncomplete being completely honest with\nyou that's when all of my best ideas\ncome through is when i just stop\nbeing distracted so the first part the\nfirst part of the acronym savers is the\ns which is silence also known for\nmeditation\nthe second thing which is the a\na stands for affirmations\nand affirmations don't have to be you\nknow the universe is sending money to me\nfrom all areas of the globe like most\npeople think you they are if you've ever\nwatched the secret an affirmation is\njust a simple reminder\nyou know so an affirmation could be i'm\ngoing to wake up\nand lead with love in everything that i\ndo and every person that i interact with\nthat could be an affirmation today i'm\ngoing to work really hard towards making\na hundred thousand dollars this year\nthat can be an affirmation today i'm\ngoing to put 100 of my focus into each\nconversation with that i have that can\nbe an affirmation so the best thing to\ndo is come up with three to five\naffirmations of what you want to work on\nreminders of ways ways that you want to\nimprove and get better and this can be\npart of your morning routine and things\nthat you tell yourself over and over\nagain every single morning just the\nsimple reminders okay\nnext thing is the v\nv stands for visualization visualization\nis extremely extremely important and the\nreason why is because visualization\nallows you to be able to see the future\nthat you want to create\nand then what's exciting about it is\nwhen you go back into your normal day\nand you're excited because you've seen\nwhat the future can be\nand now you have more motivation to go\nand create that future so there's a\nthing called the reticular activating\nsystem inside of your brain if you've\never bought a new car and you never see\nthat car anywhere but then after you buy\nit you start seeing it everywhere the\nreason why is because your reticular\nactivating system the reticular\nactivating system is basically the thing\nthat filters out all of the bits of\ninformation that come into your brain\nall day long\nand allow you to get just the most\nimportant things so within one given\nsecond this second right now you have\nover 2 trillion bits of information that\nyour brain could pick up on\n2\ntrillion bits of information per second\nbut your brain filters out everything\nexcept for 200 bits per second\n200 so that means it filters out almost\n2 trillion bits of information per\nsecond because it's only allowing in\n200.\nthe reticular activating system is the\nthing that filters out all of the stuff\nthat you don't need so the reason why\nyou see that car all the time even\nthough you never saw it before was\nbecause now that car holds a place in\nyour brain the reticular activating\nsystem notices that car whenever the car\npasses now\nwhat does this have to do with\nvisualization well\nwhen you visualize what you want\nwhat happens\nyou start seeing people places things\nand opportunities pop up in your day\nbecause of the visualization you're\ntelling your brain in the morning what\nyou want it to focus on\nthat's the point of visualization and\nyou know people always say synchronicity\nman i was thinking about that today and\nthen this happened i was thinking about\nthis person and then they called me\nit's the reticular activating system\nyou're basically turning that part of\nyour brain on to what you want it to\nfocus on so instead of thinking about\nthe negative things and the things you\ndon't want start visualizing the things\nthat you do want and you'll start\nnoticing them pop up inside of your day\nthat's the importance of visualization\nthe fourth part of this morning routine\nis exercise it could be working out it\ncould be yoga it could be\ngoing for a walk with your dog it could\nbe just moving a little bit more maybe\ndoing some stretches\nsome form of exercising in the morning\nthere's a ton of different studies that\nshow that exercising in the morning\nusually helps people's brains\nbecome more productive and work better\nthroughout the day but then also it\ngives them more energy throughout the\nday so it's important to start your day\nwith even 10 minutes of yoga 10 minutes\nof stretching taking your dog for a\nreally quick walk\nexercise is a key point to your morning\nroutine\nthe fifth point to your morning routine\nis the r which stands for reading you\nknow take 10 minutes or read five pages\nread 10 pages read 30 pages is\ncompletely up to you\nbut read in the morning because what\nhappens is your brain starts to instead\nof starting your day off on oh crap i\ngotta take a shower i gotta go get ready\nand then you hang out\nrun out of the house when you're reading\nyou start becoming more inspired you\nstart thinking about what the future\ncould hold for you based on the stuff\nthat you're reading if you read\nsomething that's non-fiction\nyou learn something immediately in the\nmorning\nwhich might make you want to learn stuff\nmore throughout the day so start your\nday off with reading as well take 10\nminutes take 20 minutes it's up to you\nand the last part the sixth one stands\nfor scribe which i know how and scribe\njust stands for\njournaling that's all that it is his he\nwas you know he had savor and then he's\nlike savor jay doesn't make sense i\ncan't use journaling and his wife ursula\nuh was actually the one who said oh why\ndon't we go ahead and look it up and you\nknow they looked up journaling writing\nand they said scribe oh perfect savers\nso if you're trying to figure out why\nsomebody would use the word scribe it's\nbecause it makes sense in the acronym\nsavers s a v e r s\njournaling taking 10 minutes 15 minutes\nto write down what was great about\nyesterday what can i do to make today\ngreat what are three things that i'm\ngrateful for this morning start your day\noff and if you just want to make it easy\njust ask yourself three things that\nyou're grateful for this morning they\ndon't have to be big things it could be\nthe fact that the outside there's\ntrees that take all of your carbon\ndioxide and turn them into oxygen and\nyou have\nbreath today it could be that you still\nhave your health\nall of your children are healthy you\nhave great relationships\nwhatever it is the sun's shining\nthey don't have to be big things to be\ngrateful for start your day off by just\njournaling three things that you're\ngrateful for if you want to dive deeper\ninto it start to ask yourself good\nquestions where do i want to be in a\nyear five years ten years what's the\nnumber one thing that's holding me back\nwhat can i do to get past it\nwhat do i want in my life what do i want\nin my relationships in my bank account\nin my career in my real in my finances\nin my materialistic goals whatever it is\nit's completely up to you just start\njournaling scribing the things that you\nwant in your life\nbecause now what happens is when you\nwake up in each day you're not being\nreactive\nyou're being proactive by finding the\nthings that you want in your life and\nfiguring out how to create those and\nbringing them into your life\nso that is the way to create the perfect\nmorning routine these are the six parts\nof it so savers s-a-v-e-r-s\nsilence affirmations visualization\nexercise reading and scribing aka\njournaling are the keys to creating the\nperfect morning routine you can take 10\nminutes\nand you could you know this could be\nyour hour-long routine take 10 minutes\nfor each one of them and that's six\nthings times 10 minutes that's one hour\nor you could look at this and go you\nknow what\ni think to just make it easy on myself\ninstead of feeling i have to do all of\nthem\ni could just do three of them put 20\nminutes for each one of them so i don't\nfeel like i'm rushing you know i really\nwant to read so maybe i'll put reading\nin there i want to journal because i've\nheard about the benefits of journaling\nand i really need to start meditating so\nthen i'm going to put my meditation\nthere\ngive 20 minutes to each one of them and\nthen once you get good at waking up and\ncreating this morning routine then you\ncan expand it then you can wake up\nearlier but make it as easy as possible\nfor you to wake up and start doing these\nthings so that's what i've got for you\nif you love uh
