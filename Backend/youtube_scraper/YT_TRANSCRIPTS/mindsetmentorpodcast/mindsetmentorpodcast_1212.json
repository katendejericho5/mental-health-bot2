    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how successful\npeople think and i'm going to tell you\nthe three ways that successful people\nthink differently from unsuccessful\npeople now if you like this and you want\nto get more videos make sure you\nsubscribe to my channel and hit that\nlittle bell that's right next to it and\nyou'll get a notification weekly\nwhenever my new videos pop up because i\nput up new videos multiple times per\nweek so the one thing about success and\ni don't mean just success as far as\nmoney i also mean success as far as\nhappiness or relationships or any of\nthese things\ni see success in all of those just\ndifferent types of success but\nsuccessful people think differently\nand the great thing about success\nwhether that's money happiness\nrelationship all of those things is that\nyou don't have to have a specific\nbackground you don't have to be a\nspecific sex or\nrace or be from a specific country in\norder to get success in all areas of\nyour life the way that you want to\nthere's no specific\ntown where you go oh yeah this is where\nall the successful people come from\nthere's no specific race where you say\noh only these people only this race are\nsuccessful right the best thing about\nsuccess\nis that anybody can be successful it\ndoesn't matter what your past was if you\ndo the right things you can be\nsuccessful success is one of the most\nstudied things in the world for the past\nhundred years people have always wanted\nto know how do you get more successful\nthey started to realize obviously if you\ngo back and read the book my favorite\nbook is called think and grow rich\nit literally shows you\nstudies of successful people and what\nthey've noticed were the traits and\nhabits that made them successful\nthat were common among all of them and\nso\nthe first thing that you need to realize\nis that\nif it doesn't matter what race or sex or\ngender or any of those things that you\nare\nwhat what matters what matters is the\nway that we think in the way that we\nprocess the world around us the thing\nthat you'll notice is that successful\npeople process the world differently\nthan unsuccessful people do the first\nthing that i've noticed that successful\npeople think about differently than\nunsuccessful people is the unknown\nto people who are unsuccessful the\nunknown is something scary\nthe reason why is because maybe they\ndon't believe in themselves enough maybe\nthey haven't gotten enough results to\nbelieve in themselves and so the unknown\nmeans that they have to have fear of the\nunknown because something might happen\nsome they might get judged they might\nhave something happen to them that they\ndon't want to happen successful people\ndo not view the unknown as scary they\nlook at it with excitement because they\nrealize this is an opportunity for me to\ngo in and figure out more about myself\nand work on myself and get better\nthroughout the process\nand that tags along with number two the\nsecond thing that successful people view\ndifferently than unsuccessful people is\nchallenges\nunsuccessful people look at a challenge\nand say this right here is an\nopportunity for me to fail\nor what if i fail or what if i get\njudged\nsuccessful people view challenges as\nthis is an opportunity to grow because\nthey know that you will not grow without\na challenge a muscle will not grow\nunless it is put under a challenge\nunless it is put under something that is\nchallenging to lift right if i go into\nthe gym and lift 10 pounds every single\nday the exact same amount 10 pounds 10\nreps 10 pounds 10 reps nothing will\nchange in my muscle i have to strain it\nyou could put 40 pounds under it and try\nto get as many as i possibly can and i\ndo 40 for a while and it gets challenged\nand it will start to grow and then i go\nin and do 45 pounds as many as i\npossibly can then do 50 pounds as much\nas i possibly can and it will grow you\nare the exact same way you have to\nrealize that the only way to grow as a\nperson and to get better is through a\nchallenge and so challenges you should\nnot view them as an opportunity to fail\nyou should view them as an opportunity\nto grow and get better if you think\nabout the most challenging thing that\nhappened in your entire life you didn't\nwant to go through it and you weren't\nhappy as you were going through it most\nlikely\nbut if you think about the way that the\nthing that changed you the most in your\nlife the thing that was the that\nyou the opportunity where you grew the\nmost the part where you really grew the\nmost it's usually the exact same thing\nthat we're talking about that biggest\nchallenge that happens to you throughout\nyour life\nand the last one the third thing that\ni've noticed that successful people and\nunsuccessful people view differently is\nthemselves\nunsuccessful people view themselves and\nthey think of their weaknesses and they\nthink of their flaws and they think of\ntheir problems and they don't believe in\nthemselves because they're too busy\nfocusing on those weaknesses and how\nthose weaknesses hold them back\nsuccessful people view their weaknesses\nas a to do it's on their to-do list my\nweakness is this i must improve this\nthey don't look at their weakness as\nsomething that holds them back they look\nat their weakness as something that\nneeds to be improved and in improving it\nwill drive them to be better and so you\nhave to ask yourself these questions how\ndo i view the unknown how do i view\nchallenges and how do i view myself how\ndo i talk to myself in my head\nand what you start to realize is maybe\nyou think about some things the same way\na successful person does\nmaybe you'll think about some things the\nway an unsuccessful person does and then\nso if you find these things that you\nthink about like an unsuccessful person\nyou then sit down with a pen and paper\nand you ask yourself what is it why is\nit that i'm so afraid of the unknown\nwhy is it that i'm so afraid of\nchallenges why is it that i don't think\nhighly of myself and you write it down\nthe pen and paper you ask yourself these\nquestions you force yourself to answer\nthem the best way to journal is to ask\nyourself a question with pen and paper\nand to force yourself to answer it with\nthat pen and paper and you'll start to\nrealize things about yourself that you\nnever even realized\nand you think you have great\nself-awareness wait till you sit down\nwith a pen and paper ask yourself\nquestions for yourself to answer it you\nwill really start to develop extreme\nself-awareness\nso those are the three things that\nsuccessful people think about\ndifferently than unsuccessful people so\nif you like this video make sure you hit\nthat subscribe button right next to it\nhit that little bell so that you never\nmiss another
