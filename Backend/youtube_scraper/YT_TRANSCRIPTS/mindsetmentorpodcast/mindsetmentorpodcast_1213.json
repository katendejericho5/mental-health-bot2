    "transcript": "i want you\nto be the hero of your own story\nyou to be the hero of your own movie\nimagine right now\nis when your movie starts we all love\nthe movies of the underdogs we all have\nthe the comeback story like the pursuit\nof happiness right the pursuit of\nhappiness we love that because we can\nsee him hit rock bottom\nwe can see him with the sun crying\ninside of a bathroom in a train station\nthat's his rock bottom and you can see\nthat mindset change of this is not going\nto be this way forever i will do\nsomething in this exact moment to make\nsure that my future is different than my\npresent moment is right now\ni want you\nto act like your story is exactly the\nsame no matter where you are no matter\nwhere you've been no matter all of your\nscrew-ups and everything that you've\ndone wrong i want you to pretend that\nright now\nyour story has flipped on and you have\nan audience watching you they're on your\nside they want you to win they want you\nto succeed\nimagine that every day walking around\nthat there's just a documentary a\ndocumentary\nthe group of just i don't know\ncompletely messing up the word right\na group of people that are doing a\ndocumentary on your life\nand everybody's watching are you going\nto make the right decisions are you\ngoing to just think about how much\ndifferent your life would be if every\nmoment of your life there was a crew\nvideotaping your every single moment\neverything that you did wouldn't you\nmake different decisions wouldn't you do\nthings\nthat would be a lot different wouldn't\nyou not skip\nall of the different things that you you\nknow cut corners and skipping different\nthings that you know that you should do\nand waking up late if there was a crew\nfollowing you around wouldn't you do\nthings different\nbe the hero of your own story your past\ndoesn't matter your present doesn't\nmatter if you're listening to my voice\nand you're sitting there and you're\naddicted to drugs you're addicted to\nalcohol you can make the change at this\nvery second\nyou can be the hero of your own story\nyou can act\nlike you're the person that's in that\nmovie pretend that that movie\nis you you are that person in that movie\npretend\nthat everyone's watching you and\neveryone's rooting you on and then you\nask yourself this question if if my life\nwere a movie if it was that rock bottom\npoint if it was that turning point in\nthe movie what would that star of the\nshow do what would will smith do at this\nmoment just like he did in the pursuit\nof happiness what would the star of my\nmovie do\nfigure that out get a pen and paper\nwrite it down and do that do whatever\nthat thing is\nthat's what you need to think about\nthat's what you need to focus on\nyou take a pen and paper and you say how\ndid i make mistakes how did i screw up\nand what you do is you figure out all of\nyour mistakes all of your scrubs and you\ndon't dwell on them you don't think man\nthere's so many ways that i screwed up\nthe reason why you're writing down your\nscrew-ups and every mistake that you've\nmade is so you don't do them again and\nso you can now make change and go a\ncompletely different direction that's\nwhat you have to think of what would\nwill smith do is what you have to think\nabout right what would he do in this\nsituation\nif he was the star of my movie what\nwould he do you figure that out and all\nyou have to do is do that\nsee too many times people like to play\nthe victim\noh well this happened to me in my past\nand my mom treated this me this way my\ndad treated me this way and all of these\ndifferent things and i wasn't raised\nwith the the right influence the best\npart about\nbeing alive in this day and age with\nwith podcasts and youtube and the\ninternet and everything that we have is\nthat information\nis readily available no matter what it\nis that you want to do you can find the\ninformation to get you to improve it\nwhatever it is whether it's\nself-improvement or whether it's\nimproving it anything that you want to\nget better at\nthere is a master out there that is\nwilling to teach you\nthe thing about that is you can either\nplay the hero in this story and go and\nfind that information\nand go out and actually start changing\nyour life or\nyou can continue to play the victim\nright there's only two things that you\ncould be in this situation either you're\nthe victim\nyou're complaining about all the things\nthat have happened to you you're\ncomplaining about the passion you're\ncomplaining about\nand worrying about all of the things\nthat you've done and people judging you\nyou could be the victim\nor you could be the hero\nthe best part about it is that you are\nthe one that makes the choice\neither you're going to be the victim\nand you're going to to continue down\nthis path that you've been on or you're\ngoing to be the hero\nyou make the choice of which one it is\nand then if you go out\nand you look at that pen and paper and\neverything you wrote down you see all\nthe mistakes you learn from your\nmistakes and if you go out and you\nhappen to make more mistakes you learn\nfrom those mistakes and you write them\ndown\nbecause here's the deal no matter what\nage you are\nno matter where you are in your life no\nmatter all of the mistakes that you've\nmade in the past\nall of the mistakes all of the people\nthat you may have screwed over and all\nthe things that you've done wrong\nyou can make the decision in this\npresent moment to be the hero of your\nown story\nto write down your mistakes to learn\nfrom your mistakes to improve and to\nmake the decision that i am going to\nspend the rest of my life getting me to\nwhere i want if your children were\nwatching your movie your documentary\nwould they be proud of their father or\ntheir mother\nthat's what you have to think about if\nyour mother or father was watching if\nyour brother sister spouse boyfriend\ngirlfriend\ncousins were watching this would they be\nproud of you and the decisions that you\nmake you're in control of the decisions\neither you can be the victim\nof your story and play the victim card\nor you can be the hero\ni hope that you choose\nto be the hero\nso once again if you like this video\nplease do me a favor hit the smash\nbutton if you have any questions
