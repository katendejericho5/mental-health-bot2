    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nprobably the most common question i get\nasked is how do i stay\nmotivated and if you like this video i\nput out videos every tuesday and\nthursday make sure you hit that\nsubscribe button down below so that you\nnever miss another episode because my\nbelief is that the harder that we work\non ourselves and our mindset the easier\nthat the external world becomes to\nnavigate so\nso we're talking about\nhow to actually become motivated and\nstay motivated there's a big difference\nthat i need to talk about the first\nthing is that everybody wants to be\nmotivated but motivation is like a spark\nmotivation is like a match you just pull\na match and it goes for a little while\nbut within a few seconds it's completely\nburned out you don't want motivation\nwhat you want is drive if motivation is\nthe spark if it's the match drive\nis the log that continues to burn you\nwant to be driven because we all know\nwhen you meet somebody who's driven you\nknow they're drip like you can see it\nthere's something in their eyes and\nyou're like man this person's going to\nplow through a wall to get what they\nwant that's what you want you want to be\nable to have that drive that no matter\nwhat happens you keep going right that's\nwhat you're looking for is how to be\ndriven so driven that nothing ever will\nstand in a way no matter how crazy it is\nso how do you get that\nit's very very simple\nyou have a strong why\nright\nyou have a strong why when i was younger\ni had i hired my first mentor paid 500\nbucks a month to have my first mentor to\nhave phone calls with him and he\ncompletely changed my life is one of the\nbest investments probably actually was\nthe best investment i've ever made in my\nlife\nand what he used to say is if the why is\nstrong enough the how will reveal itself\nif you're why behind what it is that\nyou're going for is strong enough if\nyour emotional attachment to your goal\nis strong enough the how to do it will\nreveal itself if your why is strong\nenough your how will reveal itself so\nwhat do i mean by your why your strong\nemotional attachment to whatever this\nthing is that you're going for\nwell everybody has your you have your\ngoal that you're working towards right\nbut do you know why you're going for\nthat goal\nhave you sat down and figured out your\nstrong emotional attachment to that goal\nand so this is the example i always like\nto give because it usually puts things\ninto perspective it makes a lot of sense\nfor people if you take person a into\nperson b right\nperson a wants to make a hundred\nthousand dollars person b wants to make\na hundred thousand dollars same goal\nthey want to make a hundred thousand\ndollars this year person a wants to make\na hundred thousand dollars and that's\nall they know person b wants to make a\nhundred thousand dollars but they have a\nwhy and let me tell you what their why\nis their why is that they live in a bad\npart of town they have two kids and a\nwife and he wants to take his children\nbuy a house you know he wants to make\nthis hundred thousand dollars so he can\nput a down payment on a house take his\nkids and his wife and move into a better\npart of town and here in america if you\nlive in a better part of town sadly it's\njust the way that it works you know if\nyou live in a better part of town your\nchildren will most likely get a better\neducation\nso you have person b who wants to know\nhis wife and kids are what he's working\nfor he wants to take his kids and his\nwife put a down payment on a house in a\nbetter part of town and be able to have\nhis children get a better education\nbecause if they get a better education\nthere's a chance they might get into a\nbetter college there's even a chance\nthat they might go and get a full ride\nscholarship and have everything paid for\ndon't even have to pay for school and\nthat could completely change their life\nmaybe they live in a dangerous part of\ntown and he knows that that dangerous\npart of town there's a chance that those\nkids are in danger\nso whenever things get hard\nwho do you think is going to keep going\nno matter what well person a wants to\nmake 100 000 as well\nbut when they don't have a why behind it\nthey just want to make a hundred\nthousand dollars person b\nevery single time that something bad\nhappens he gets hung up on on the phone\na customer slams a door in his face he\ngets a cancelled order he thinks to\nhimself i might not be able to do it\nhe's going to think of his children's\nface he's going to think of his wife's\nface and say i'm not doing this for me\ni'm doing this for them\nand guess what if your goal is big\nand audacious enough you will have\nfailures you will have bumps in the road\nbut if you have a strong emotional\nattachment and you can see those faces\nyou know where you can see your goal or\nsee who you're working for see what\nyou're working to do\nthen when you have those failures it's\neasy to get back up person a might fail\nhave a failure and say that's not that\nbig of a deal i don't make need to make\na hundred thousand dollars i'm okay with\n50 i'm still alive at 50. i'm still\npaying my bills at 50 and\nyou know have a little bit of extra\nmoney to have some fun on the weekends\nwith my friends but person b\nman no matter what happens they're gonna\ngo through a wall\nto make sure that they make that money\nbecause he knows that in his mind\nin a sense his children's life is on the\nline and he's the only person that's in\ncontrol of their destiny at this point\nin time\nright that's the difference\nbetween between being motivated and\ndriven because you might listen to my\nwords you might see my videos or listen\nto my podcast or see the pictures i put\nup and all of these things and you might\nget a spark of motivation\nbut when things get hard that spark's\ngoing to be dead\nright that that match is going to be\ngone\nyou want to be driven from within that\nmotivation that comes from looking and\nseeing all the stuff that i do is\nexternal motivation you want internal\ndrive an internal drive comes from\nhaving a very very strong why\nso what do you do once you know this why\nyou tell yourself i'm doing so person b\nto even get even get the stronger y he\nwould say i'm going to make a hundred\nthousand dollars this year this is the\nreason why because i want to take my\nfamily out of the spot that they live in\nbecause my children's lives might be in\ndanger i know that they're not going to\nget the best education i want to put a\ndown payment on a house i want to be\nable to get them in a better part of\ntown because i know they'll get a better\nbetter education which means they can\nget into better colleges means that\ntheir life could be completely different\njust for me working my freaking tail off\nfor one year\nright\nand what they do what he does\nis he sees that piece of paper he wakes\nup every single morning\ngets done brushing his teeth and he\nreads that piece of paper out loud to\nhimself every single morning and then\nbefore he goes to bed every single night\nhe reads that piece of paper he reads\nthat mission statement\nof why he is doing what he's doing to\nhimself every single morning and every\nsingle night and it's impossible to\nforget and guess how easy it is to\nbecome driven from within\nwhen you have that written down and you\nstick to this so if you're trying to\nfigure out how to be quote unquote\nmotivated\nyou want to be driven and the way that\nyou become driven is you find out your\nwhy behind your goal your strong\nemotional attachment to it\nand then what you ask yourself is\nwhat's the reason why i'm doing it who's\nwho's behind this is it just for me or\nis this for other people and you get\nthat strong emotional attachment you\nwrite it down you read it to yourself\nevery single morning and you read\nyourself every single night and watch\nhow quickly your life will change when\nyou're doing something ex for for the\nfor the internal drive versus external\nmotivation that's what you're searching\nfor and that's how you do it so if you\nlike this video once again i put out\nvideos every tuesday and thursday hit\nthat subscribe button right here
