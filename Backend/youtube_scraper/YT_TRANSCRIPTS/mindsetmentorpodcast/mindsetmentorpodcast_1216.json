    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about is\nthe five major habits that I have found\nalmost every successful person has now\nthe first one which I think is probably\nthe most important but for some reason I\nI find that almost every single\nsuccessful person does this and Tim\nFerris in his new book talks about that\nhe's interviewed hundreds and hundreds\nof millionaires and billionaires and\ninfluencers and some of the most\nsuccessful people in the world and the\nfirst thing that he says that 85 to9 %\nof them wake up early and have some sort\nof morning routine and so if you if you\njust look at some of the people that I\nwas able to find out have morning\nroutines you have Jack dorsy who started\nTwitter he wakes up at 5:30 every single\nmorning and he's a multi-billionaire\nRichard Branson who obviously founded\nvirgin and many companies and is a\nmulti- multi-billionaire as well says he\nwakes up at 5:45 every single morning uh\nhe actually opens his shutter so that\nthe sun when it comes in it comes into\nhis room room and makes him wake up um\nyou also look at Tim Cook who is the the\nCEO of Apple he says he wakes up at 4:30\nevery single morning you look at Howard\nSchultz who's the guy who founded and is\nthe CEO of Starbucks he wakes up at 5:30\nevery morning so the number one thing\nthat I find that most successful people\nextremely successful people do is they\nwake up early and they have some sort of\nmorning routine and you might ask\nyourself why would they wake up early\nthe reason why is because that's the\ntime where they can focus on themselves\nwhen you go into the office or you go\ninto work usually you're on someone\nelse's time whether you own your own\nbusiness and you're on all of your\nemployees time making sure make making\nsure everything's in place and\neverything's going the right way or\nnumber two is you're you're on your\nboss's time if you work for somebody so\nif you have to leave your house at 8:00\na.m. and you wake up at 7:30 you jump in\nthe shower and all of those things you\nleave at 8: you're waking up immediately\nwaking up to go into somebody else's\ntime that's what you're doing you're\nfocusing on somebody else as soon as you\nwake up in the morning these people like\nto focus on themsel so they wake up a\ncouple hours early they meditate they do\nmorning routines they Journal they have\nworkout exercises they have a routine so\nthey wake up a couple hours early to\nwork on themselves before they do\nanything else it's just like when the\nthe plane is going down they say put the\noxygen on yourself first when you wake\nup in the morning focus on yourself\nfirst because that will then make\neverybody else around you and make your\nlife better as well so the first thing\nis obviously a morning routine the\nsecond thing that I found with the most\nsuccessful people is they are very very\nbig on not only making goals but\nactually writing their goals down and\nthis is key because 40 years ago Harvard\ndid a study and they found out that out\nof everyone that was in their classes or\nstudents that were there only about 3%\nof them actually wrote their goals down\non a piece of paper now some people knew\ntheir goals or what their goals were but\nnot all of them only 3% of them wrote\nthem down with a piece of pen and paper\nand wrote it down and what they found 30\nyears down the road they went back and\nlooked at them was that that 3% that\nwrote down their goals were 10 times\nmore successful than the other 97% 30\nyears down the road so if you could take\na page out of their book for some reason\nwriting down your goals makes it seem\nreal in your brain it makes you clarify\nexactly what you want it Mak makes you\nput a date and a deadline on exactly\nwhat you want sometimes it makes you\nlook at it and say well now that this is\non piece of paper I need to actually\nmake a plan of how to hit these goals\nversus them just floating around in your\nbrain so if you have goals or New Year's\nresolutions that you're working on don't\njust let them float around in your brain\nput them on a piece of paper put a\ndeadline to it put a goal down on the\npiece of paper and figure out when\nyou're going to do it the plan of what\nyou have to do to get there how you're\ngoing to get there all of those things\nare important so the most successful\npeople write it down on a piece of paper\nbecause when it's in your brain it's\njust kind of floating around your brain\nbut when it's on a piece of paper it is\nphysical and it is now something that is\nreal and exists in the world so the\nsecond thing they do is they write down\nall of their goals the third thing that\nI found with most successful people is\nthey have a habit of creating mentors\nlike going out and actually finding\nmentors or actually finding coaches to\nmake them be better at whatever it is\nthat they're working towards and there\nwas a study that I found said that the\naverage millionaire over the course of\ntheir lifetime has had seven very\nserious mentors or coaches now why is\nthat important because if you're trying\nto get really good at something or\nyou're in a certain industry why not\ntake your time your money your energy\nand invest it into getting a mentor or a\ncoach who's been doing it longer than\nyou because here's the thing they could\nteach you 20 years of experience of what\nthey've done right what they've done\nwrong most importantly and they could\nteach you all of that in a much shorter\nperiod of time then it would take you to\ngo out make mistakes and learn for\nyourself so basically what a coach or a\nmentor does is it shortens your learning\ncurve you know what they learned in 20\nyears in the industry you might be able\nto learn in two years that gives you an\nextra 18 years to get better at whatever\nit is that you're focusing on so if you\ndon't have a mentor you don't have a\ncoach ask yourself how can you find a\nmentor or coach whether that's someone a\nlot of people say I wish I could find a\nmentor that I don't have to pay for but\nwhen I was 19 years old I paid $500 a\nmonth which was more than I paid in rent\nto have my very first Mentor which at\nthat point in time I thought I was crazy\nmy friends thought I was crazy too but\nit was the best decision I ever made\nbecause it got me to be successful a lot\nquicker than if I had just tried to go\nout and figure it out myself and when\nyou pay to have a mentor versus just\nhaving a friend who is a mentor but when\nyou have a paid Mentor they actually\nbecause of the fact they're accepting\nyour money they actually feel some sort\nof responsibility for your success so\nthey're more likely to help you along\nthe way of success and go out of their\nway to help you be more successful as\nwell so the third thing that I found for\nthe most successful people in the world\nis that they always have mentors and\ncoaches the fourth thing that I found as\nfar as a habit is positive self-talk\nthey believe in themselves they have\nself-confidence and I want to tell you\nthis nobody's born with self-confidence\nconf confidence is something that you\npick up along the way to success but\nwhat they seem to realize is that they\nbelieve in themselves and when they\nbelieve in themselves they're much more\nlikely to get there and the the way that\nI like to think about it is this my\nfavorite analogy dealing with the way\nthat we think in our minds has to do\nwith a garden so the the analogy is\nthink of your mind as a garden and you\nthe only person that can tend to this\nGarden nobody else can it's impossible\nto go out and plant strawberry seeds\nseeds in that garden and expect that\nsomehow you're going to grow tomatoes\nit's impossible you can't put strawberry\nseeds in the ground and get tomatoes\njust like you can't plant negative\nthoughts or talk to yourself negatively\nin your head and expect that you're just\ngoing to have positive life or a\npositive outcome or a positive attitude\nright you have to learn that when\nbecause let's be honest most of us are\nreally really harsh on ourselves we\nwould never talk to somebody that we\nlove the way that we talk to ourselves\nin our own heads\nthat should not be the case though so\nwhen you start to notice yourself\ntalking down to yourself you need to\nimmediately stop it and replace that\nthought with something positive because\nat this point in time if you've been\ntalking down to yourself for a while\nit's it's somewhat of a habit and the\nonly way to actually break a habit is to\nstop it as soon as you get into the\nmiddle of it as soon as it starts you\nyou try to stop it as quickly as\npossible and what you have to realize is\nyou can't always control your first\nthought at this point because that's\nyour automatic thought but you can\nalways control your second thought so\nthat's something that you need to\nconcentrate on have positive selft talk\nto make yourself believe in yourself\nmore than anything else and the fifth\nthing that I found for the most\nsuccessful people in the world is that\nthey read often the average CEO reads 60\nbooks per year 60 and we're talking\nabout CEOs these are people who are\nalready at the top of companies read 60\nbooks per year that's more than one per\nweek and so if you look back at the past\nyear how many books have you read this\nyear if you want to be successful don't\nyou think you should just take a page\nout of a successful person's book and\nfollow these five steps and go all right\nwell if they read 60 books in a year\nmaybe I could read once a month and then\nmaybe you start after you start going\nonce a month maybe you decide I could\nprobably do once a week or twice a month\nwhatever it might be but you realize if\nthese people are successful there's\nsteps to being successful take a page\nout of their book and do exactly what\nthey do right these people are constant\nLearners and one of the things my my\nfirst Mentor used to talk about was\nKaizen it's a Japanese word for constant\nNeverEnding Improvement we should all be\non this journey of Kaizen of constantly\nNeverEnding Improvement trying to\nimprove every single day and the people\nthat are already at the peak of Peaks\nthese CEOs are still constantly trying\nto improve themselves and make\nthemselves better so don't you think\nthat we should if we're not where we\nwant to be at this point so once again\nthose are the the five things number one\nis they wake up early number two is that\nthey write down their goals and they\nmake them physical number is that they\nhave mentors and coaches number four\npositive selft talk they believe in\nthemselves they have confidence they\nfigure out what's going on in their\nbrain and they make sure they wire it\nthe way that they want to with\npositivity and the fifth thing is that\nthey read very often so if you like this\nepisode please do me a favor please give\nit a thumbs up give it a like if you\nhave any comments please them type them\ndown
