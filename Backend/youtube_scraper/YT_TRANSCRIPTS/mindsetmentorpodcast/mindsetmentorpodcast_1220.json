    "transcript": "it's a\nweird time that we live in right now\nisn't it it seems like we're stuck in\nthis weird paradox where we have taller\nbuildings but shorter tempers we seem to\ndrive on wider freeways but have\nnarrower viewpoints we spend more money\nthan we ever have but we spend less time\nwith the people who we actually love we\nhate our jobs but we spend more time at\nwork\nwe have more dads but honestly we seem\nto have less fathers we have more\ndegrees but less sense we have more\nknowledge but less wisdom there's more\nexperts in every single field\nbut we have more problems we have more\nguns but we feel less safe we have more\nprescriptions but less wellness we\nsmoke too much we drink too much we\nspend too recklessly and we laugh too\nlittle we get angry too quickly we watch\ntoo much tv we don't read enough and we\nprobably don't pray enough either we've\nincreased all of our possessions but\nwe've lowered our value we've learned to\ntalk more but forgotten how to take a\nstep back and actually listen to a\nfriend in need we don't seem to love\nenough\nwe seem to hate too much we're really\nquick to judge\nreally slow to accept somebody we've\nbeen all the way to the moon and back\nbut we have trouble crossing the street\nto meet a new neighbor and have a chat\nwe've conquered outer space but we\nhaven't conquered inner space we've done\nlarger and grander things\nbut they haven't really been better\nthings necessarily we talk about how\nwe're going to\nclean the air but continue to pollute\nour souls we're quick to accept that\nfriend request\nbut we're really slow to accept somebody\nwho doesn't look like us we have more\ninformation at our fingertips than we\never have but we learn less and less\nfrom it we've built more computers that\nhold more information but we feel more\nempty we're more connected than we ever\nhave been but one in five people suffers\nfrom loneliness\nwe can swipe left we can swipe right but\nwe're left with relationships that just\ndon't feel right we spend a ton of time\non social media but\nnot enough time on social justice these\nare the times of fast food slow\ndigestion tall men short characters we\nhave more food than we've ever had\nbefore\nbut less nutrition these are the days of\ntwo incomes but more divorce\nbigger fancier houses but most of them\njust\nseem to be broken homes these are the\ndays of throwaway morality one night\nstands overweight bodies and pills that\ndo everything from cheer to quiet\nto kill\nit's a time when technology can bring\nthis message directly to you and you can\neither share this insight or you can\njust choose to hit delete so how do we\nstop it how do we break this cycle\nthat we all\nseem to be stuck in right now i think\nwhat we need to do is need to remove\nourselves from it and quiet our minds\nand ask ourselves what do we want to\nchange\nas gandhi said we need to become that\nchange because everybody seems to want\nchange\nbut very few people want to change it\nrequires the self-awareness to take a\nstep back\nlook at ourselves\nand ask what adjustments we need to make\nand for us to actually make those\nchanges\nbecause we can't change everybody else\naround us but if we change ourselves you\nand i we might inspire others to do the\nsame as well\nand\nyou never know that may actually be the\nripple effect that the world needs right\nnow\nthey say if you scratch a cynic you'll\nfind a disappointed idealist and i would\nadmit that somewhere underneath all of\nthis to the little flicker of a flame of\nidealism that would love to see it all\nchange"
