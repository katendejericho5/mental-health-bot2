    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to today's episode today i'm\ngoing to talk about why you should stop\nbelieving in yourself now\nlet me explain exactly what i mean by\nthis most people don't get to where they\nwant to go or sometimes they don't even\nstart\nbecause deep down they just don't\nbelieve\n100 percent in themselves they don't\nbelieve that they can do it\nbut i'm going to share a little bit of a\nsecret with you you don't have to\nbelieve in yourself\nin order\nto take action\nyou don't have to believe in yourself in\norder to take action\nmost people think that they have to\nbelieve in themselves before they start\ngoing down this road and i'm going to be\nhonest with you\nmost of the time especially in the very\nbeginning you're not going to believe in\nyourself you're going to doubt yourself\nall of the time you're going to doubt\nyour skills\nyou're going to doubt your mindset\nyou're going to doubt the path that\nyou're going down the the the road that\nyou're traveling you're going to\nevery single thing you could possibly\nthink about if you're going down a\njourney if you're following your passion\nif you're becoming an entrepreneur if\nyou're starting a job most of the time\nyou're not going to believe in yourself\nthe only thing that's going to keep you\ngoing\nis your excitement for the goal that\nyou're going towards\nmost of the time you're not going to\nbelieve in yourself let me tell you\nwhere belief comes from\nbelief\ncomes from results\nbut the problem with that\nis that you can't get results\nunless you take action\nyou can't get results unless you take\naction and therefore you can't believe\nin yourself until you get results\nso therefore most of the time when\nyou're in the very beginning stages of\nwhether it's a business or whether it's\nyou're following your passion or you're\ntrying out in a new sport or you're\nstarting to play a new instrument or\nwhatever it might be\nyou're not going to believe in yourself\n100\nbut that doesn't matter because you have\nto get the results\nin order to get the belief so therefore\nyou don't have to believe in yourself in\norder to go out and take action you\ndon't have to believe in yourself in\norder to push yourself to go towards\nwhatever it is that you want\nwhat's going to keep you going is this\nclear goals number one\nand number two\nis a strong why behind those goals\nthat's what's going to get you going in\nthe very beginning not your belief in\nyourself if you have a goal that is so\nclear and you're so driven to get there\nthen belief doesn't actually matter\nbelief doesn't matter at all if i told\nyou that you know you had to make a\nmillion dollars this year\nyou probably wouldn't believe in\nyourself too much if i said you have\nwhat's the percentage chance\ni always say these on webinars when i'm\nwith people what's the percentage chance\nof you making a million dollars legally\nthis year\nmost people say oh it's it's five\npercent it's it's ten percent\nit's point one percent it's zero percent\nand then i say what's the percentage\nchance of you making a million dollars\nthis year if your entire family's life\nis on the line\nand everybody says it's a hundred\npercent\nand what that shows you\nis that you don't have to have a belief\nin yourself that you can make a hundred\nor that you can make a million dollars\nwhat you have to have\nis a strong why towards that goal why\nyou're going towards that goal why\nyou're going to push yourself to get\nthere\nright if your entire family's life is on\nthe line you don't have to believe in\nyourself at all all you have to do is\njust take action and wake up every\nsingle day\nand eventually you will get there but\nthat also shows you how much we restrict\nourselves\nwhen the only thing that changes between\n30 seconds of oh there's no way i can\nmake a million dollars this year\nand i will 100 make a million dollars\nthis year it's not the belief that\nsomebody has themselves it's the why\nbehind what it is that they're going for\nso when you're new at something when\nyou're trying something new when you're\nbecoming an entrepreneur when you're\nleaving your job when you're becoming a\nparent all of these things you're not\ngoing to believe in yourself but you\ndon't have to believe in yourself in\norder to create action\nin order to get belief you have to get\nresults but in order to get results you\nhave to create action therefore your\nfirst job more than anything else is to\nget your butt off the couch\nrealize that believing yourself means\nabsolutely nothing all you have to do is\njust keep going and just keep getting up\nand keep pushing eventually you're going\nto start to get results and eventually\nyou're going to start to believe in\nyourself more but that belief is not a\nprerequisite\nfor getting up and doing it\nand that's the one thing that you have\nto realize you don't have to believe in\nyourself\nin order to be successful at something\nyou"
