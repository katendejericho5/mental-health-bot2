    "transcript": "the doctors told him your heart will\nexplode please don't do it\nthat's what roger bannister heard when\nhe decided to try to break the world\nrecord for running one mile see doctors\nsaid that it was physically impossible\nto run a mile in under four minutes\nand yes they told roger bannister that\nhis heart would explode in the process\nwhy\nbecause no one had ever done it before\nit seemed like an impossible feat one\nthat was more than the human body was\ncapable of achieving\nand for the longest time\nno one even tried to run a mile in under\nfour minutes because they accepted that\nit was impossible\nbut that was until may 6\n1954 when roger bannister ran the mile\nin just under four minutes\nand guess what\nhe didn't die\nand on that day he made the impossible\npossible\ndo you want to know the most amazing\npart about that story though within four\nyears\nof running that four minute mile 20 more\npeople recorded a mile in under four\nminutes\nthink about that for a second for\nthousands of years\nno human ever ran a mile in under four\nminutes and then once one person proved\nthat it was possible\n20 more people did it now did the human\nbody magically evolve over those four\nyears so that people could run faster no\npeople finally believed that it was\npossible because someone else had done\nit\nin their minds it switched from\nimpossible to possible\nproving that people were limiting\nthemselves based on what others had said\nor based on what others had done\nit all starts up here before it can\nhappen out here\nthis is very important for us to realize\nbecause how often do we not go after\nwhat we truly want for ourselves because\nof what we think is possible for\nourselves or because it seems impossible\nbased on what we've done in our past\nand how often\ndo we not go after our goals because of\nother people telling us what we can and\ncannot do\nsee in order for us to do something that\nwe've never done we must first believe\nthat we can do it up here\nwe have to focus on the goal that we\nhave for ourselves and block out all of\nthe people who try to tell us what is\npossible\nso\nwhat do you want to do\nwhat is it that you've been holding\nyourself back from doing based on what\nyou've done in your past or what other\npeople have said to you or your own\nself-limiting beliefs\nbecause just like the four-minute mile\neverything in this world was once\nimpossible\nuntil one person prove that it was\npossible\nso\nwhat's your impossible\nbecause your limits\nare just decisions\nnot facts\n[Music]\nhey everybody thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you loved it\nplease do me a favor hit that share\nbutton down below so that more people\ncan get more messages like this and if\nyou want to follow along you can go\nahead and follow my page i have new\nvideos that come out every single week\nbut until then i appreciate you and i\nhope that you guys have a great day"
