    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode i'm gonna\nwarn you if there's children around uh\nyou might want to not listen to this\nepisode right now because it's a pretty\ngood chance i might cuss because this is\nsomething that i am passionate about so\nlisten to this at another time if\nthere's children around what i'm going\nto talk about today is procrastination\nand how procrastination is a bunch of bs\nand the reason why i might cuss is\nbecause uh this subject really gets me\namped up and this is what i'm going to\ntell you procrastination does not exist\nprocrastination is a fancy word made up\nby lazy people\nfor just not really giving a damn\nlet me say that again procrastination is\na fancy word for not giving a damn\nbecause here's the deal if something is\nimportant to you you will figure out a\nway to get it done\nif something is important to you you\nwill figure out a way to get it done\nlet me tell you exactly what i mean by\nthat what i mean by that is this if i\nsaid hey what's the chance of you making\none million dollars this year what's the\nwhat's the chance of you making 1\nmillion this year\nwhat's the percentage chance you might\nsay oh it's a one percent chance a zero\npercent chance a half a percent chance\nif i say what's the chance of you making\na million dollars this year\nand if you don't your entire family gets\nkilled\nwhat's the percentage chance of you\nmaking a million dollars this year the\npercentage chance at that point in time\neverybody always says it 100 100 200 500\n1000 i've heard all those numbers before\nwhat changed the goal didn't change the\ntime frame didn't change what changed\nwas your why behind it if you're not\ndriven if you're not motivated to get up\nand do what needs to be done in order to\nget to where you want to go the reason\nwhy if you can't get up and do it is\nbecause you really just don't care\nyou don't care\nprocrastination is a fancy word for not\ngiving a damn\nso you might say okay that's great well\nhow do i actually start to care\nin order to do anything\nyou have to have a strong why\nyou will not do some you can be excited\nabout something for a little while but\nyou will not continuously do something\nand keep working hard\nand own your business or you know start\nyour business and keep getting kicked in\nthe face and failing and failing and\nfailing and failing and all of those\nthings you won't continually get up\nevery single time unless you have a why\nsomething that is so strong behind that\ngoal that's going to make you get up\nsomething that you're you're driven by\nto be honest with you and you may have\nheard me say it before even though i run\na podcast called mwf motivation i\npersonally am starting to hate the word\nmotivation and the reason why is because\npeople act like there's just some\nmotivational fairy that comes and\nsprinkles motivational dust all over you\nin order to get done and the truth\nof that is it doesn't exist when you're\nlooking to be dr motivated what you're\nreally looking for is to be driven\nto have something that you're so driven\nfor that nothing's going to hold you\nback\nand so if you say oh man i just keep\nprocrastinating i don't know how to stop\nprocrastinating\nask yourself do i really\nfreaking care about it\nand if you don't\ndo something else\nand if you do care about it\nask yourself this question what is my\nwhy\nif your goal is to make a hundred\nthousand dollars this year let's just\nuse that as an example why is that what\nis your why what is your strong\nemotional attachment to that goal of\nmaking one hundred thousand dollars if\nit's just monetary reasons monetary\nvalue you're not going to be that driven\nmost of the time but if you say hey i\nwant to make my why for making a hundred\nthousand dollars this year is because i\nwant to take my children out of the\napartment they're in and move them into\na house in a better school district so\nthey can be raised better than they can\nget better education than i got\nthat's a strong why that's something to\nbe excited about i want to make a\nhundred thousand dollars this year\nbecause i want to take my mom to italy\nbecause she's never left the country\nbefore that's a strong why\nand so you have to ask yourself whenever\nyou figure out what your goal is\nwhenever you know what your goal is find\nout that why that strong emotional\nattachment that is going to make you get\nup when you want to stay in bed\nthat's going to make you make the extra\nphone calls when everybody keeps hanging\nup on you that's going to make you get\nup and do the work that needs to be done\nwhen you've been rejected all freaking\nday so if you ask yourself if your\nquestion is oh listen i know what i need\nto do i just don't know how to do it i\ndon't know how to make myself do it you\nhave to ask yourself do i really care\nbecause procrastination does not exist\nyou either care\nor you don't care\nprocrastination is a fancy word for not\ngiving a damn\nand if you want to get to where you want\nto go in life\nyou need to figure out what the real\nreason is or else you're going to\nprocrastinate\nforever\nso if you like this episode please do me\na favor click the subscribe button and\nplease share this with someone that you\nlove someone that you think could get\nsomething
