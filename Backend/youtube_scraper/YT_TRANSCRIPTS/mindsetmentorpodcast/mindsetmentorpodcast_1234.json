    "transcript": "today i have a very very simple question\nfor you what do you want in your life\nsee most people have a decent idea of\nwhat they want in their life but they're\nnot really specific of exactly what they\nwant and that's the reason why most\npeople aren't where they want to be and\nit's because most people aren't even 100\nsure of where you want to be let me give\nyou an example if my friend said come\nover to my house and i didn't ask for\nhis address and i didn't know where he\nwas there's a pretty good chance that\ni'll never make it to his house and\nthat's how most people treat their goals\nin their life they don't have the exact\naddress of where they want to go and so\nthe example that i always give people is\nwhen you get in your car you set your\ngps to the destination that you want to\ngo if i were to get in my car in austin\ntexas and want to go to my friends in\nhouston i can't just say houston texas\nbecause it will drive me my gps will\ntake me to houston but it won't take me\nto my friend's house the more direct you\nare with what you want in your life the\nmore likely you are to get it the more\ndirect that you are with the exact\naddress that you want to land at with\nyour gps the more likely that you are\nthat you're going to get there a perfect\nphrase to remember that deals with this\nis that you can never hit a target that\nyou can't see if i were to take the\nnumber one archer in the world give him\na bow and arrow and give you a bow and\narrow there's a pretty good chance he's\ngoing to beat you every single time but\nif i blindfold him and spin him around\nyou're probably going to hit the target\nmore times than he does why not because\nyou're better but because you can\nactually see the target and that's how\nyour goals should be you don't have to\nbe better you don't have to be able to\ndo all of the things that others can't\nyou just have to know exactly where\nyou're going and what you want your\ndestination to be so what i want you to\ntake from this episode is to become very\nclear on what you want in your life\nbecome very clear on your goals don't\njust say i want to lose weight this year\nwhat does that mean how much weight do\nyou want to lose do you want to lose 20\npounds 30 pounds because if you just\nwant to lose weight losing one pound is\nstill losing weight don't say i want to\nmake more money this year give an exact\nnumber of how much money you want to\nmake don't say i want to be healthier\nthis year give an exact definition of\nwhat healthy is and don't say i just\nwant to be happier you have to be very\nclear on exactly what happy is and what\nwould make you happy the more clear you\nare on what it is that you want in your\nlife the more likely you are to get it\nso become very very clear on what it is\nyou want in your life and what your\ngoals are set your gps your gps to where\nyou want to go and there's a much much\nbetter chance that you'll end up getting\nthere"
