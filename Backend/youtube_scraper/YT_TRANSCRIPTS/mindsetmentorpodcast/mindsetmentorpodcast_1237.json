    "transcript": "you are not an emotional person\nyou have identified yourself with a\npattern of thinking\nnow let me explain exactly what i'm\ntalking about a lot of people watch this\nvideo and say i'm an emotional person he\ndoesn't know what the hell he's talking\nabout but let me explain this to you\nand this goes back to when you're\nactually a child\nand so when you're born\nyour mother has a flood of chemicals\nthat runs through her brain one of them\nis called oxytocin oxytocin is known as\nthe cuddle chemical\nand what happens is this is why it's so\nmuch easier for a man to leave a child\nthan for a woman to leave a child is\nbecause when a woman gives birth there's\nactually this thing called oxytocin that\nruns through her brain it is what makes\nthe woman chemically fall in love with\nthe child before ever even seeing it\nso what happens is as you're growing up\nas a child as you're zero one two years\nold your mom has this oxytocin more than\nnormal running through her brain so you\ncan you can mess up a lot as a kid you\ncan pee on the floor you can knock stuff\nover you can break stuff and your\nparents will go and clean it up\nno questions asked but then eventually\nwhat happens\nis this oxytocin starts to run out of\nthe brain and go back to normal levels\nand you knock something over on accident\nas a little kid does and your mom snaps\nfor a second it might not be a big snap\nbut it's enough to shock you as a little\nkid\nand what happens is your immediate\nreaction is oh my my mom is pulling her\nlove away from me and you start to cry\nbecause that's the only thing that a\nchild cares about is if their parents if\nthey have their parents love and if your\nparent yells at you your immediate\nreaction is oh my gosh i'm not going to\nhave my parents love and what probably\nhappened if you're a quote unquote\nemotional person\nis that you started to cry and your mom\nsnapped out of it she said oh my gosh\nwhat am i doing she wanted to go pick\nyou up she picked you up and cuddled you\nand you realized in that one second\nmaybe you were one two years old maybe\nthree years old\nthat if i cry\ni get my mother's love aka if i cry\ni get what i want we all have seen\nchildren who cry\nwhen they don't need to cry they fake\ncry because it is a learned pattern it's\na learned habit\nthey know i cry i get what i want i cry\ni get what i want now some people\ngrow out of this pattern or habit some\npeople never realize\nthat it's not natural and they never\ngrow out of it\nso if you see yourself as an emotional\nperson there's a pretty good chance that\nthis is actually a connection that you\nhave from your childhood now a pattern\nor habit is not hardwired into your\nbrain it can be reversed\nyou are able to program it into your\nbrain from a child you're able to\nreprogram it to something else\nso what you do is this next time you\nnotice emotions start to come out right\nyou identify the pattern or habits you\nwant to break that might be emotions or\nbeing emotional\nand what you do is you make a new\ndefault that you go to so next time you\nfeel you know what sets you off it's\nsomebody yelling at you or somebody\ncutting you off it's somebody doing\nsomething or your life not living up to\nyour expectations and that's when the\nemotions start to come what you do\nis you notice you become self-aware very\nself-aware this is what sets me off and\nwhen it starts to go down that path you\nhave to immediately become self-aware\nclick yourself out of it and go to that\ndefault whatever that default is maybe\nif you if somebody yells at you or you\nlet's say this let's say somebody puts\ntoo much input at work and you start to\nshut off you start to become emotional\nand start to freak out a little bit you\nknow that that is your pattern or habit\nwhat do you do you have an automatic\ndefault that you go to that automatic\ndefault could be listening to your\nfavorite song right so as soon as you\nget all that stuff put on your plate you\nfeel all of those emotions start to rush\nthrough you you put in your headphones\nand you listen to your favorite song and\nmake yourself break out of that pattern\nor habit because a pattern or habit can\nalways be reversed but you have to catch\nit in the moment before your brain\nstarts going down that route that it\ncontinues to go down\nevery single time the only way to break\na pattern a habit is to break it\nin the middle of that actual\nneurotransmitter firing from one place\nto another so figure out what the\npattern is you're trying to break and\nthen figure out what your default\npattern will be that you're trying to\nreplace it with so what happens is your\nbrain will actually start to reverse\nitself next after\nhundreds and hundreds or thousands of\ntimes of this happening if you start\nputting on that favorite song that\ndefault and that default puts you into a\ngood state you could see somebody put a\nton of work on your plate\nand it will actually not affect you\nmight even make you happier because what\nyou've done is you've reversed\nthe emotions from being anxious or sad\nor pissed off or whatever it might be to\nhappiness instead\nso you can always reverse your patterns\nor habits but you have to become very\nself-aware\nand you always have to have the default\npattern or habit as well"
