friday so if you like it\nplease hit the like button if you want\nto subscribe hit the subscribe button if\nyou have any questions or comments\nplease put them down below\nokay so when we're talking about the\npain of hard work versus the pain of\nregret\nwe all know that hard work sucks hard\nwork really sucks and that's why it's\ncalled hard work because it's\nit's hard obviously\nbut the only thing worse than the pain\nof hard work is the pain of regret now\nthese are two separate things the pain\nof hard work is something that happens\nright now the pain of regret is\nsomething that happens later on\nand\nmost of us with the way it is in in\nthese years 2017 2018 coming up\nwe all want everything immediately we\nwant everything right now everything's\ninstantaneous\nwhen i was younger it used to be really\nhard to find the answer to something\nbecause you'd have to go to the you'd\nhave to go into the actual library find\nthe encyclopedia and look something up\nnow if you have any question about\nanything you can find the answer within\nan instant because all you have to do is\ngoogle it we're used to instant\ngratification\nhard work\nand the pain of regret is the complete\nopposite so the pain of regret comes\nfrom being lazy from not being motivated\nfrom uh\ndeciding that you don't want to do\nsomething really should some sort of\nprocrastination\nlater on that's now that's the the\ninstant gratification is is not doing\nsomething when you should do it later on\nthough is when you have the pain of\nregret the pain of hard work is going\npast\nthe instant gratification\nknowing that you will get delayed\ngratification later on whether that be\nwith money or whether that be with the\nsuccess that you want or looking back in\nyour life and actually being proud\nsometimes hard work is really hard\nyou're going to lose sleep sometimes\nyou're going to lose friends when you\nwork really hard you're going to miss\nimportant events sometimes as well\nyou're going to miss your friends\nbirthdays you're gonna miss different\nthings sometimes you'll have to travel\nand you won't be able to be there for\ncertain moments\nbut you have to know in the long run\nthat this hard work is going to pay off\nthe only thing worse than the pain of\nhard work is the pain of regret think\nfrom right now in this very moment that\nyou're in\nwhere do you want to be 20 years from\nnow\nwhat do you want to be doing 20 years\nfrom now what's your profession what's\nyour family look like who are you\nsurrounded by how much money do you have\nin the bank what does your business look\nlike 20 years from now if you're looking\nback what is if if you put yourself in\nyou know 20 years from now when you're\nlooking back\ndo you want to think about the time when\nyou worked really hard and you've\nactually got to where you are to set\nyour family up to set your life up to to\nlook back and be proud of what you did\nbecause of the hard work\nor 20 years from now do you want to be\nlooking back with regret thinking\nman i could have done something better\nwith my life i could have brought the\ngreatness out inside of me i could have\ndone what i knew that i was capable of\ndoing but i was just so afraid i was so\nlazy why didn't i make myself do that i\ncould have set up my children in my\nfamily in my spouse's life so much\nbetter had i just made that decision\nthat i was gonna go for what i wanted to\ngo for\nbecause here's the thing\nas best as you and i know it we only\nhave one life we have one life to live\nthat we know of do you want to get to\nthe end of it\nand wish that you could have done more\nthat pain of regret\nif you want to become motivated if you\nwant to get your tail up and actually do\nsomething\nbe motivated\nby not wanting to regret what your life\nhas become in 20 years\nbecause here's the thing your life could\neither be exactly the same in 20 years\nor it could be amazing it's probably not\ngoing to go backwards because you've\nalready built yourself to the person\nthat you are and who you are right now\nis able to attain the level of success\nthat you currently have\nso you're probably not going to go\nbackwards but if you don't do anything\ndifferent if you don't make any changes\nif you don't push yourself out of your\ncomfort zone\nnothing's going to change you're going\nto be in the exact same position\nso when you look back 20 years from now\nare you going to regret that you didn't\ndo everything that you could\nto make the greatness that you had\ninside of you come out are you going to\nwish that you had a better story to tell\nyour children or are you going to go\nyeah\nthere was a lot of sleepless nights\nthere was times when i had to say no to\ngo out and partying there was times when\ni missed a couple birthday parties but\nlook at what i have done look at what\ni've done for myself for my family for\nmy friends for everyone around\nand the best part about success is this\na lot of people think in this day and\nage that in order to be successful you\nhave to screw people over you have to\ndo things you don't really want to do\nand\npush people out of the way and for some\nreason there's this thought of in order\nto be successful i have to screw a lot\nof people over and a lot of people think\nin their head well i don't want to be\nsuccessful just because of that one\nreason\nthere's an article that i was reading\ntalking about the new billionaire and\nwhat they say is that the new\nbillionaire\nfrom now on is going to be the person\nthat figures out ways to help a billion\npeople because they say if you can help\na billion people and make one dollar off\nof those billion guess what you're now a\nbillionaire\nthe new billionaire the new currency\nthe new billionaire what you're going to\nin order to be that person you have to\ngive so much value to the world in order\nto receive it now you might be listening\nto this and saying i don't want to be a\nbillionaire i just want to bring out\nwhat i know what is inside of me\nwell then you have to plant the seeds\nnow you have to plant the seeds\nright now and do the things that need to\nbe done in order to be sitting under\nthat tree in 20 years that you're proud\nof you know there's a phrase and the\nreason why i'm saying this is that the\nphrase says the best time to plant a\ntree assuming the best time to plant a\nseed for a tree is 20 years ago\nthe next best time is right now so what\nare you doing with your current present\nmoment that you're in\nare you holding yourself back because\nyou're so afraid of the greatness that's\ninside of you\nyou know our greatest fear is not that\nwe are inadequate our greatest fear is\nthat we're\npowerful beyond measure as a quote says\nby maya angelou we're so powerful that\nit actually kind of scares the crap out\nof us and so we think that we need to\nplay small for people because we don't\nwant to make other people uncomfortable\nby us playing all out\nbut what you have to realize is that\nwhen you play all out when you're on\nfire out in front of the world\nit will set other people on fire there's\na phrase that i used to live by and\nstill love and says if you set yourself\non fire people will come to watch you\nburn what that means is that when you\nset when you literally light yourself on\nfire from the inside out and you're so\nmotivated and so driven towards\nsomething people look at you and say\nhey that's really inspiring maybe i\ncould do that as well\nsee we're fearful that if we go out and\nwe play all out that for some reason\npeople are going to look at us and feel\nbad about themselves or they're going to\nlook at us and judge us but they look at\npeople who are on fire and they say\nmaybe i could do that too\nright i'm just an average person he's\njust an average person maybe i could do\nthat as well\nso there's only two things that you have\neither the pain of regret or the pain of\nhard work\nright the pain of regret or the pain of\nhard work where you are now is a\nreflection\nof your past decisions\n20 years from now\nit will be a reflection of your\ndecisions now over the next 20 years\nwhat are you going to do to make the\nnext 20 years of your life as great as\npossible are you going to make the\ndecision because it all starts with the\ndecision are you going to make the\ndecision that you will no longer hold\nback the greatness that's inside of you\nthe best time to plant a seed was 20\nyears ago the next best time is right\nnow\nwork hard for what you believe in that\nwill help other people that will bring\nvalue to the world and you will not get\nto the end of your life and wish that\nyou had done more you will get to the\nend of your life and realize that you\ndid everything that you possibly could\ndon't get to the end of your life and\nregret that you could have done more\nso if you liked this episode
