    "transcript": "did you know that 36 million people will\ndie next year of starvation that is one\nperson per second so if you see this\nticker that's going off in the video\nthat's how many people will die\njust in the time that you are watching\nthis and one out of every 10 of those\nwill be a child and with this holiday\nseason you and i could end their\nstarvation let me show you how according\nto worldhunger.org\n795 million people are hungry right now\n81 million of those are in need of\nemergency food assistance so imagine\ngoing through this holiday season not\nworried about gifts not worried about if\nyou will get through your family holiday\nparty with your crazy aunt but worried\nabout if you will have enough food to\nkeep your children alive to see the new\nyear that is the sad sad reality\nfor many people on this planet so how do\nwe solve this problem what's the easiest\nway for us to help well according to the\nunited nations it would cost between 30\nto 60 billion dollars to end hunger for\nan entire year americans alone will\nspend over 600 billion dollars just on\ngifts this holiday season that's 10\ntimes what would be needed to end world\nhunger for a year so if you normally\nspend 500 on gifts\ncould you donate 50 of those dollars if\nyou normally budget 200\non gifts could you donate 20 of those\ndollars\nand that's just americans\nimagine if everyone in the world were to\ndo this we could end hunger for years to\ncome could you just imagine that for a\nsecond not one mouth would go hungry on\nthis beautiful planet if we were just to\ntake 10\nof what we're going to give in gifts\nthis holiday season and this video is\nnot sponsored by any charity or any\ncompany but i've personally done my due\ndiligence to see what would be the best\ncharity for us to donate to if we all\nwere to gather together and do so and i\nfound one called action against hunger\nthey're extremely transparent about\nwhere their money goes\nand they also have extremely high\nratings on all of the websites that i\ncould find and from now until the end of\nthe year they will match your donation\ndollar for dollar making your donation\ngo even further and they estimate that\nit only costs about 45 dollars to save a\nchild's life i have linked their\ndonation page in the comments below also\nif you would like other options at the\nend of this video i will put up other\nurls of very reputable charities that\nyou can donate to so if you can find it\nin your heart to donate this holiday\nseason please do but either way please\nshare this video so that we can raise\nawareness on how we can help solve this\nproblem because no matter what you're\ncelebrating this holiday season there's\none thing that we can all agree on\nand that's that no person deserves to go\nhungry\nhappy holidays\n[Music]\nyou"
