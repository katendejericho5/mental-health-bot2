button if you\nhave any questions or comments please\ntype them down below and also if you\nlove this please hit the subscribe\nbutton so that you'll never miss another\nepisode now i've had conversations with\npeople who say things along the lines of\nit's bad to take you know to think that\neverything in the world is positive talk\nhow everything is positive because\nnegative things happen you shouldn't\nignore the negative things and i'm not\ntrying to tell you to ignore the\nnegative at all actually i'm actually\nmore than anything else telling you to\nfocus on the negative and try to figure\nout a way to turn that negative into\nsomething positive but the easiest way\nto think about it is this think of your\nmind\nas a garden\nyou're the only person that can tend to\nthis garden you're the only gardener of\nthis garden\nit's impossible for you to take tomato\nseeds\nplant them in the ground and expect that\nstrawberries are going to grow\nit's impossible it will never happen\njust like you can expect to have\nnegative thoughts come into your mind\nall day long and expect that you're just\ngoing to have a positive life\nif you're tending to this garden if\nyou're the only one that can take care\nof it you're also the only person that\ncan pull all of the weeds\njust like if you're in control of your\nmind and everything that pops up all of\nthese negative self-doubt\nterrible thoughts that pop into your\nhead maybe ways that you talk down to\nyourself all of those weeds need to be\npulled we need to get rid of all of\nthose weeds\nwe need to focus on our mind\nas if we're the only person they can\ntend to this garden and take care of it\nas if we're trying to make the most\nbeautiful garden that we possibly can\nyou cannot take tomato seeds put them in\nthe ground and get strawberries\nyou can't have negative thoughts you\ncan't have negative things happen you\ncan't have self-doubt you can't talk\ndown to yourself and expect that you're\njust going to have this positive life\nyou have to be in control of this\nyour thoughts are not random your\nthoughts are things that pop into your\nhead\nbased on the way that you've thought in\nthe past\nin the way that you currently still\nthink so what do i mean by that you\ncan't really control your first thought\nat this point right now the thoughts\nthat pop in your head those automatic\nthoughts\nthose are based off of the way that\nyou've lived in the past so you can't\nnecessarily\nchange your thoughts right away you\ncan't control that first thought but you\ncan always control that second thought\nso if the first thought pops in your\nhead is extremely negative if that's if\nthat's the first thought that pops in\nyou can immediately go no i'm not going\nto allow that i'm going to turn this\ninto something positive i'm going to\ntake this negative situation and turn it\ninto something positive i'm going to\ntake this talking down to myself or the\nself-doubt and and tell myself that i am\ngood enough i'm gonna actually prove to\nmyself how that self-doubt is actually\nwrong\nyou have to think of your mind like a\nlike a muscle really to be honest with\nyou\nyou go to the gym and you do a lot of\nbicep curls\nyou're going to eventually get larger\nbiceps and if you start to go into the\ngym and you pick up larger weights and\nlarger weights\neventually that muscle is going to grow\nwhat i am talking to you about is like a\ngym for your mind when the negative\ncomes in how can i be so\nstrong how can i have the mental\nfortitude to turn this negative into\nsomething positive i'm not going to\nignore the negative in fact i'm going to\nput time into thinking about that\nnegative and think of how i can actually\nturn that negative into a positive how\ncan i take this negative and turn it\ninto a positive that's what you have to\nthink about that's what you have to\ncontrol\nso that's the first part of negativity\nis negativity that's happening in your\nmind self-doubt that's happening in your\nmind\nnow i know some of you that are out\nthere\nare saying well you know i do really\ngood with my own positivity but i have a\nlot of people in my life that are\nnegative i have negative people in my\nlife what do i do about that\nwell there's a couple different options\nnumber one i would say get rid of them\nif there's negative people in your life\nthat throw their negativity onto you\nthat make you feel like less of a person\nor that just really bring you down all\nthe time if it is possible\nget rid of them you don't have to break\nup with them and if they're a friend\nthat you've been friends with for a long\ntime you have to be like hey i'm done\nwith you\nbut you could just try to stop hanging\nout with them or if it's someone say for\ninstance that's in your family\nmaybe you just spend less time with them\nbecause their negativity if you allow it\nto\ncan affect what comes into that that\nnegativity is going into your mind and\naffecting the way that you live the way\nthat you are so you either get rid of\nthem or you spend less time with them\nthat's completely up to you if it's a\nfamily member spend less time with them\nit's okay if it's your parents\nyou can still spend less time with them\nand if there's absolutely if you're if\nyou happen to be watching this um and\nyou say well you know what\ni live with my parents there's no way i\ncan get away from that negativity\nwell if you can't get rid of them\nand you can't spend less time with them\nthen what you should do is see that as a\nchallenge see their negativity as a\nchallenge just like you go into the gym\nand you lift heavier weights the more\nheavy the heavier you get the bigger\nyour muscles gonna get right the more\nnegativity that comes into you and the\nharder that you work of not letting that\nthat negativity enter your mind and\nturning that negativity into positivity\nthat that challenge will make your\nmuscle your mind muscle\nstronger\nhow can you take their negative and turn\ninto something positive as well see that\nas a challenge now also dealing with\nnegative people\ni want to talk about your top five they\noften say that your net\nwork\ndetermines your net worth\nhow the people that you hang out with\nwill dictate how much money you make\nthey always say that if you hang out\nwith five alcoholics you will probably\nbe the sixth\nif you hang out with five millionaires\nyou will probably be the sixth so if you\nhang out with a lot of negative people\nguess what of course their negativity is\nentering into your mind of course it is\nharder for you and so maybe what you do\nis you take a pen and paper and you\nwrite down here are the five people\nthat i spend the most time with\nthese are the five people that i spend\nthe most time with day in day out each\nday and each week and you look at them\nand you say is this person right here\nnumber one two three four and five and\ngo to each one of them\nare they bringing are they making my\nlife better are they pushing me to be\nbetter or are they bringing me down\nare they pushing me to be the best\nversion of myself or are they pulling me\ndown to their level of negativity\nor their their level that i don't want\nto be on\nwhat you do is you start finding out who\nyou should spend more time with\nwho you should spend less time with or\nhopefully no time with if you can get\nrid of some of them\nand what you do is you now realize\nthere's a couple open spots in my top\nfive and with those couple open spots in\nyour top five what do you do you try to\nfind somebody to replace them how do you\nfind that person why don't you start\ngoing to go to meetup.com\nfind people that are interested\ninterested in the same thing that you're\ninterested in go to networking groups go\nto go to different events or places\nwhere people that have the same passion\nand interest\ngo that have the same interest as you\nm that could be a conference that could\nbe a a seminar you can find if there's\ndifferent meetups you can go on facebook\ngroups there's almost a facebook group\nfor everything so if there's certain\nthings that you like well then you can\ngo and try to find those people at those\nthings that you like\nbecause here's what you have to realize\nyour mind is like a garden\nyou are in control of your thoughts\nthey're not random things and once again\nyou can't control your first one but you\ncan always control your second one if\nthat negativity pops in you immediately\ngo no i'm going to change it to\nsomething positive i'm going to think of\nsomething positive and eventually your\nfirst thought will be much more positive\nbecause you've been so diligent with\nthat first thought\nand then that second thought\nyou'll notice that you're actually going\nto start to become more positive over\ntime it won't happen overnight won't\nhappen the next couple weeks but over\nthe next couple months you'll notice\nthings changing because your mind is\nlike a garden you cannot put tomato\nseeds in the ground and expect for\nstrawberries to grow just like you can't\nhave negative input coming into your\nmind and negative thoughts and\nself-doubt and all those things and\nexpect that your life is just going to\nbe positive and you can't hang out with\nnegative people all day long and expect\nthat you're going to be positive\nyou have to get rid of those people you\nhave to get rid of those thoughts\nwhenever the weeds pop up in your mind\nyou have to pull them and you are the\nonly person that's in control of it you\nhave to guard your mind diligently and\nyour life will start to change you will\nstart to be more positive and what\nyou'll notice is that the more positive\nyou are the more amazing your life\nbecomes\nso once again if you like this episode\nplease do me a favor please hit the
