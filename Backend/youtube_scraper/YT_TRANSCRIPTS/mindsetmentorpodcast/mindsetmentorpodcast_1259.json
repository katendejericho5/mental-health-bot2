    "transcript": "i find that most people spend most of\ntheir time planning and overthinking um\nand so i i work with a phrase most\npeople know the phrase like ready\nready aim fire you get ready you take\nyour gun you figure out you make sure\nit's in the right spot and then you fire\num but i like to do ready fire eight\nmore it's like i think of what it is\nthat i want to do i put a couple hours\nmaybe a couple days if it's really big\ninto it\ni fire and then after i go i make\nadjustments on what it is because i feel\nlike most people\nlike to call themselves a perfectionist\num they're like oh\ni'm not i have this project i really\nwant to do it but it's not ready yet\nit's not perfect because i'm i'm a\nperfectionist right and so i think that\na lot of people like to mask their fears\nof rejection fear of failure a fear of\nsuccess whatever it is that's their real\ncore fear of what's holding them back um\nbut they put the mask up of oh but it's\nnot out yet because i'm a perfectionist\nand so for me i know that i'm the exact\nsame way and so instead of allowing that\nfear of rejection or failure of success\nwhatever it might be\ni just plan something very quickly\ni put it out there and then i just make\nadjustments from there so i literally\ntry to execute as quick as possible\nbecause most people i think just\ni've done it spend too much time\noverthinking\nand not actually executing and so\nwhenever i do something that's like\nready fire aim\nyou"
