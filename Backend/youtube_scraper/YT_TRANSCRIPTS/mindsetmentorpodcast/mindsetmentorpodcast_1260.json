    "transcript": "there's one time that i remember um\nfirst thing that immediately popped into\nmy head with the question of dark times\nwas i remember he was supposed to pick\nme up i was probably nine or ten years\nold he was supposed to pick me up at a\nbaseball game and uh this was before\ncell phones kids had cell phones\nand so i was sitting on the bleachers\nand we were the last baseball game of\nthe day and um it was at night and i was\nsitting on the bleachers and i was\nwaiting for him to come pick me up and i\nif if you know like the lights that they\nhave at night they're on timers and so\nit just clicked off and so i was like it\nwas like a movie where like it should\nhave been a movie scene right i'm\nsitting there i'm nine years old the\nlights click off and out of nowhere it\njust started raining like a movie scene\nwould be and uh he never came and just\nnever showed up in the first place and\nso\nthe only way that i got home was i\ndidn't have money for a payphone there\nwas a payphone but i didn't have money\nfor it\nwas that one of my teammates parents\nwere driving by and they saw me sitting\nthere by myself and we went to their\nhouse called my mom my mom thought that\ni was already picked up so she came and\ngot me\num\nand so for and my mom did like\nan amazing job like the only reason why\ni'm not crazy is because of her\nbecause i should have with a lot of the\ndark things that happened i should have\nin my childhood wasn't terrible\ni think because of her she was able to\nkeep me sane but i also think that uh\nthose are the times that made me this\nthose those things that i went through\nmade me the strongest i think i think\nthat the dark times\nmade me stronger but i also think that\nit's not really necessarily what happens\nto you it's also the way you perceive it\nand i think that as a child i probably\nperceived a lot of it as actually even\nworse than it really was\num because i was so in my head and when\ni was younger i think i was probably\nmuch more negative\nby the way i viewed stuff and i remember\nactual thoughts in my head of like i\njust wish you would die because it would\nmake my life easier um and then when you\ndid pass away i was like oh my gosh\nthat's not what i wanted that's that's\nthis is way more permanent than i was\nexpecting as a kid you know and so um\ni think that\nthat going through those made me\nstronger i had a conversation with my\ncousin\nand we were talking about dark times and\nin\nhaving to go through those types of\nthings\nand i think that\nevery person\nis given certain levels of trauma or\nchallenges the way i like to look at it\nin order to\ni think it's the universe testing us to\nsee if we're able to work through it and\nso if my belief is that we're in this\nconsciousness in order to make ourselves\na little bit better than when we first\ncame on to it onto the planet and so\nthese challenges are put here in order\nto make us more enlightened\n[Music]\nbut some people look at them as\nchallenges and those challenges hold\nthem back forever some people look at\nthose challenges and say i'm going to\nuse this as a stepping stone to make\nmyself better\nso i don't i don't look at my childhood\nand the things that i went through and\nthe things that were darker as a bad\nthing i actually think of them as a good\nthing\nwhat i always tell people is the worst\nday of my life was also the best day of\nmy life\n[Music]"
