    "transcript": "but i hate the word motivation now like\ni used to love the word motivation but\nthen i started getting emails from\npeople asking me they say\ni'm searching for motivation i wake up\nsometimes and i just don't have it as if\nlike this this motivational fairy comes\nand sprinkles motivational dust and if\nyou're lucky you wake up and you have\nmotivation right like that's that's the\nway most people view it um\nbut i don't think people are really\nsearching for motivation i think what\npeople are searching for is drive and\nwillpower to do something that needs to\nbe done because most of the time we're\njust holding ourselves back the only\nreason why we're not as successful as we\nwant to be\nis because of the fact that we're just\nholding ourselves back from being there\nand so the the thing about motivation is\nit's very fleeting so sometimes i'll\nhave motivation sometimes i won't have\nmotivation but if i have a goal that i\nstrongly believe in and that i really\nwant to get to\nthen\nif i wake up in the morning i don't have\nmotivation it doesn't matter because i'm\nso driven towards my goal\nthat it's i'm going to get it done\nanyways even if i don't want to even if\ni'm tired i'll chug a cup of coffee and\njust do it anyways\nyou"
