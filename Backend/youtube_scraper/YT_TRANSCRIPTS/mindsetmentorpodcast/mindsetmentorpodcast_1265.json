    "transcript": "the first book that really changed my\nlife\nwhen I was 19 I hired a mentor which I\npaid more to have a mentor to talk to\nhim once a week I paid $500 a month\nwhich was more than I paid in my rent to\nhave somebody to be my mentor and my\ncoach and the first book he recommended\nthat I read was thinking Grow Rich by\nNapoleon Hill and that book is like for\nme it's almost 100 years old but it's\ngot pretty much everything that I think\nevery personal growth book needs it's\ngot everything that you need and so that\nbook was the first one it was just like\nthe foundation of personal growth the\nfoundation of becoming successful and in\nmaking me realize that like anything\nelse being successful\nhappy all of those things there's having\na successful marriage having a\nsuccessful business financial success\nbeing happy as a person being great\nparent there's there's legitimate steps\nto every single one of them it's not\njust like this weird obscure thing where\nhopefully you can figure it out you can\nread this book and go oh this is the\nsteps to getting to where I want to go\nand so that made me realize when I read\nthe book that oh I should probably read\na lot more of these books because the\nall of the knowledge that I need is\nalready out there so that's like my\nnumber one favorite book my number two\nis called the one thing which is by Gary\nKeller and Jay papasan and\n[Music]\nthe thing that I think most people have\nis they always have a plan B just in\ncase plan a doesn't work out and they'll\nput some time most of their time in a\nplan a but then they'll put some of\ntheir time in a plan B just in case plan\na doesn't work out and so the example\nthat I was give is LeBron James the\nbasketball player when he was coming up\nhe didn't play basketball and then also\nplayed volleyball in case basketball\ndidn't work out right he put everything\n100% waking hours into just becoming the\nbest that he could and so greatness\ncomes from putting everything into plan\na and just forgetting about Plan B and\nWill Smith says there's no reason to\nhave a plan B because it distracts from\nplan a and so if I have a hundred\npercent of my energy every single day\nand I put 60 percent into plan a and 40\npercent into Plan B I will never get to\nthe point of greatness of whatever it is\nI'm working for whether I'm an artist\nI'm a musician I'm a speaker\nbut if I just cancel everything out\nbecause they say don't put all your eggs\nin one basket and then in the book they\nsay put all your eggs in one basket and\nwatch the basket and that's the way that\nI think of it where it's like put all of\nmy eggs in one basket and I'm gonna make\nmistakes I'm gonna screw up but\neventually I'm just gonna be able to\nmove around and figure out what I need\nto do in order to get to the spot that I\nwant to be and so that was mm-hmm that\nwas the second book and the third book\nwas called the power of now by Eckhart\nTolle and so I feel like I'm very much\nin the moment most of the time but\neverything that I'd ever thought about\nbeing in the moment and\nmindfulness was finally put into a book\nand so I was actually talking about this\nin my friends last night I showed them\nmy my actual book that's on my Kindle\nand every single page is almost\ncompletely highlighted because there's\nso many insightful things about just\nbeing present about the fact that\nworries don't matter about how to\nrelease yourself from fear and limiting\nbeliefs and all of those things and it\nwas finally in a book where I could read\nit and consume it and go okay this is\nthis is what it's all about and I've\nread the book twice in the past two\nmonths and both two the second time I\nwent through I was like I don't even\nnotice this and so every time I read it\nI feel like it's I'm getting something\nnew from it so so I would say those are\nmy my three favorite books\nyou"
