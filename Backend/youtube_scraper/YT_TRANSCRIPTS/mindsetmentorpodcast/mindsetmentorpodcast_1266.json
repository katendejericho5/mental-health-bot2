    "transcript": "so i think a lot of people have anxiety\nbecause they think about stuff that\nhappened to them when they were younger\num they think about how their parents\nmight have treated them or\nyou know something terrible that might\nhappen to them when they're younger and\nthat causes them anxiety because they're\nholding on to in the present moment but\ni think a lot of anxiety really comes\nfrom worrying about what might happen in\nthe future and so i always tell people\nwhen i hear people when i have coaching\nclients and they're like but i'm worried\nabout this i'm worried about this\ni say to them you might we might get off\nthe phone right now you might go and get\nin your car decide to go get a sandwich\nand just get hit by a truck and that's\nit it's the end\nso you were worrying about something\nthat never came to fruition in the first\nplace\nso to cause anxiety in the present\nmoment and to realize that there's\nnothing you can do about the future\nright now except for just try to be the\nbest that you possibly can be at this\nsecond\nis ruining your present moment\nand that's the only thing that you have\nif you have 10 more minutes to live and\nyou don't know it what's the\nwhy waste these 10 minutes worrying\nabout something that's not actually\ngoing to happen in the future because\nmost of the time anxiety worry and fear\nis all something that never actually\nhappens in the first place"
