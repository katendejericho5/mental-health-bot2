    "transcript": "when i think about it i realized that we\nhave\nanimal brains right tens of thousands of\nyears ago\nwe had to worry about stuff right if we\nwere inside of a cave we had to worry\nthat if we were about to leave that cave\nthere might have been a lion out there\nthat would attack us\nbut we're not we're in the middle of new\nyork city right now we're not gonna walk\nout and a lion's gonna be walking down\nwall street like it's just not go it's\nnot something we have to worry about\nanymore so worry and fear and all of\nthose things kept us alive kept our\nspecies alive\nbut modern day our brain doesn't have to\nworry about lions and being attacked and\nif we're going to get food and all of\nthose things we have everything that we\nneed and so our that little part of our\nbrain is still trying to find stuff to\nworry about and if you can take your\ntake yourself out of it\nand as he says in the power of now watch\nthe thinker just sit down and act like\nyou're you know your thoughts your\nworries your feelings are just you're in\na movie theater and you're the only\nperson to move through and you're just\nwatching these things come by on the\nscreen\nand you look at it and you're like i\ndon't i don't like that thought\nyou don't put any emotion to it you\ndon't judge yourself but you look at it\nand go as if you're somebody else just\nyou know watching yourself and go i\ndon't really like that what would i\nprefer it to be and then you just\nreplace it with whatever you would\nprefer it to be and for me\nthat kind of relieves anxiety and fear\nand worry just knowing that\nthat part of our brain exists but it\ndoesn't have to i can't control my first\nthought a lot of the stuff that we do is\non instinct but if i don't like my first\nthought i can always change it so you\ncan't control your first thought you can\nalways control your second thought and\num if worry pops up i go do i like that\nno i don't like that what would i prefer\nit to be and i just try to immediately\nreplace it with with something else"
