    "transcript": "[Music]\nand so one day i decided to meditate for\n15 20 minutes and have a pen and paper\nin my hand and so i just sit there\nquietly and everything that comes into\nmy head i just put on a piece of paper\nand i just write it down i don't open my\neyes i just keep my eyes closed and so\nit looks like scribble whenever i get\ndone but i just put everything that's in\nmy brain onto there and so a lot of\ntimes i'm very scatterbrained as most\npeople are\nand that's when i'll do my to-do list\nmeditation where i'll go okay i need to\nthere's a lot of stuff going in my brain\ni need to take all of it and i need to\nput it on a piece of paper\nwhen i get done with it\nit's like extreme clarity there's\nnothing else running in my brain because\neverything that my brain was worrying\nabout is on that piece of paper so it\ndoesn't need to worry about it anymore\nand then i look at it and i say okay\nwhat's priority number one like what's\nthe most important thing that has to be\ndone today okay it's this and so i go\nokay this is number one this is number\ntwo this is number three\nand if i get just number one done for\nthe day\nthat's it's it's a successful day and\nthe reason why is because i used to take\nto-do lists i think a lot of people do\nthis i would take my to-do list and try\nto knock out as many things as possible\nwhich means i'm going to get the easiest\nthings done but then at the end of the\nday you feel like you got nothing done\neven though you checked off 30 things\noff your to-do list was because you\ndidn't take the most important things\noff of the list"
