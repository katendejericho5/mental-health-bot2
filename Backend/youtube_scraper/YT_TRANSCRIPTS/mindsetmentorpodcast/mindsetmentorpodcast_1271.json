    "transcript": "i think that once\nhe actually passed away my father\nactually passed away i think that\nit was it was it's it stopped being a\nfear of death\nand it started becoming the fear of the\nlife unlived is really what it was\num so\ni really think that the fear of death\nstopped at that point in time\nwas because i looked at his life and\nsaid you know he's a great person but\nthere was he was a dreamer but he was\nnever never executed any of his dreams\nand so i realized\nhe was a life unlived he did not do\neverything that he wanted or that he\ncould have\nand so my fear\nwent from the fear of death to the fear\nof getting to my life and regretting\nwishing that i would have done more\nwishing that would have impacted more\npeople's lives\ni remember\na couple weeks after my father passed\naway my mom and i were talking about it\nand i was like i feel like i should go\nspeak at a meetings or i should talk to\nalcoholics and make them realize that\nyou know what they're doing\nis not affecting just them what they've\nbeen through in their past experiences\nand not affecting your stem there's\nother people around them there's\nchildren they're loved ones that that\nare going through the same thing they're\ngoing through in a different way\nand so\ni think i immediately once my father\npassed away realized that this is this\nis what i've been given\ni need to make a positive out of this my\nfather's dead\nnothing i can do about that\nthat's a bad thing\nbut i could also turn this bad thing\ninto a really good thing and so my\nmission has been how can i get my voice\nout to as many people as possible to try\nto impact as many people as possible\nbecause that negative has turned into an\nextremely positive thing since that\nhappened 16 years ago\nbecause of the way that i viewed it and\nrealizing that i'm going to make sure\nthat when i die that negative\nis\ncom it's it's nothing compared to how\nmuch positive actually came from it\n[Music]"
