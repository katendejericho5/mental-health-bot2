    "video_title": "BEST DAY EVER - Split, Croatia",
    "transcript": "So today was an amazing day! Lauren and I\nare in Split, Croatia right now. This\nmorning we had to wake up really really\nearly in order to catch a boat ride out\nto go to five different islands to go\ncheck them out and on the way out there\nit was an extremely extremely bumpy ride\nto the point where there was 12 of us on\nthis little tiny boat and to be honest\nwith you we probably should not have\nbeen on that boat in as big as the seas\nactually were but we did eventually make\nit over to where we were supposed to be\ngoing so the first island that we went\nto is an island and called Vis, I\nbelieve that's how you pronounce it, and\nthe city that we went to is called\nKomiza\nand Komiza is this really small little\ntown that's actually in the Guinness\nBook of World Records for more\nregistered boats inside of the city than\nactual people who live there so then we\nhad to leave after an hour and after an\nhour we went and we want to round the\nisland of Vis to the opposite side and\nso there's actually a secret blue cave\nthat only I guess locals know about that\nthey took us to and we were the only\nones that were there and the famous blue\ncave you can't jump in the water you\njust have to go through in a boat but\nthis blue cave that they took us to we\nwere actually able to go snorkeling it\nwas a bluest water I've ever seen in my\nentire life in the way that the Sun came\nin and hit the water made the water glow\nin this really deep blue color probably\nthe coolest place I've ever snorkeled in\nmy entire life and then after we left\nthere we went to this private island\nwhere we had about an hour or an hour and\na half to hang out on where Lauren got\nto go lay out and then I was finally\nable to get my drone to connect you can\nsee that the really green waters but\nalso really deep blue waters as well as\nevery spectrum of colors that you could\nthink between green and every single\nspectrum of the color of the blue as\nwell\nafter there we went and we had three\nhours on an island called Hvar alright so\nwe have made it to Hvar which I\nthink I lost Lauren she was behind me\nand now she's gone well there she is\nright there she's coming this way yeah\nand then after that we ended up leaving\nthat was the entire tour that we had for\nthe entire day took about 12 hours for\nthe entire tour and then after that we\nwent to a place called Diocletian's Palace which is the palace that is\ninside of Split and it's got a small\narea where it's a little square that\neveryone tends to hang out in every\nsingle night everybody gets bottles of\nwine and they drink and then their\nstreet performers that come out\nit's a seventeen hundred year old palace\nand in the 1700 year old palace 3500\nyear old Sphinx and so today was one of\nthe best days ever and it's only because\nof the fact that we decided to pack up\ncome over and start traveling so\nwhatever it is that you want to do with\nyour life whether it's travel whether\nit's work somewhere with us be happy\njust remember that you're in complete\ncontrol of whatever you want to do it's\nyour life you get one of them so make\nthe absolute best out of everything that\nyou have because this is one of the best\ndays because we decided that we were\ngoing to make it one of the best days so\nwe'll see you guys later\nOh"
