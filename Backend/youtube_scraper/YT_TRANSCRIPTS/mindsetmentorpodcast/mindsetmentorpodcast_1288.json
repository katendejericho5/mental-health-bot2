    "transcript": "are you addicted to overthinking now you\nmight listen to that question and say\ni'm not addicted to it i just happen to\noverthink sometimes i can't really\ncontrol it but what is an addiction an\naddiction is something that you no\nlonger have control over it has control\nover you do you want your mind to have\ncontrol over you probably not because if\nyou're over thinking you're probably not\nover thinking about the positives in\nlife you're probably thinking about the\nnegative things that could be happening\nin the future and that leads to worry\nthat leads to limiting beliefs that\nleads to fears that leads to you\nnot creating the life that you want and\nholding yourself back negative thoughts\nfears worry limiting beliefs all come\nfrom one thing and one thing only over\nthinking and overthinking can be an\naddiction it can have control over you\nso where exactly does that come from it\ncomes from thinking too much in the\nfuture in other words\nnot being in the moment so then you\nmight be asking okay\nhow do i get control of my mind then\nthe way you get control of your mind is\nto bring it to the present moment to\nstop thinking in the future so how do\nyou bring your mind into the present\nmoment\nyou do whatever you're doing and bring\nyour conscious thought to it and notice\nas much about it as you possibly can for\ninstance if you happen to be washing\nyour hands think about the feeling of\nthe soap think about the warmth of the\nwater think about the smell of the soap\ndon't think about the future or anything\nelse but washing your hands if you're\nwalking up your stairs for instance you\nbring yourself to the present moment and\nyou notice the way the carpet feels on\nyour feet the way it might be warmer it\nmight be cool inside of the house you\nbring your mind to the present moment\nultimately what you're doing is you're\nallowing yourself to enjoy and to notice\nthe senses that are being used in the\npresent moment and you're taking control\nof your mind and not letting it do\nwhatever it wants to do and here's what\nyou'll notice it's essentially like\nliving like a three-year-old again why\ndo three-year-olds have so much fun\nbecause they're so in the moment that\nnothing else bothers them they have no\nworries they have no fears they have no\nlimiting beliefs or judgments\nthey're in the present moment and\nthey're experiencing everything for the\nvery first time so what you'll notice\nwhen you do this is that you will bring\nmore joy out of yourself because you're\nin the present moment enjoying little\nteeny tiny mundane things that you\nnormally wouldn't enjoy but you're\nbringing your conscious thought to them\nand not allowing your mind to go all\nover the place because overthinking is\nan addiction but it's an addiction that\nyou can break"
