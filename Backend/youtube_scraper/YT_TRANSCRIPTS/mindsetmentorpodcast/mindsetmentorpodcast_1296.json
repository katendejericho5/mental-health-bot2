    "transcript": "is being a perfectionist ruining your\nlife let me give you an example of what\nI mean do you delay things because\nthey're not perfect yet have you not\nstarted because you're still waiting for\nthe perfect time have you ever started\nsomething but then not finished it\nbecause you just would not it's not\nperfect it's not what you wanted it to\nbe\nare you someone who's - who wanted to\nstart a blog or you wanted to start a\nYouTube station or you wanted to start a\npodcast or you wanted to start any of\nthese things but you haven't started\nbecause it's just not perfect yet it's\nnot the perfect time or the content\nyou've been making is imperfect or are\nyou an artist or a musician or any of\nthese things that is just not it's not\nperfect yet you want to work harder you\nwant to make sure the stuff that you're\nputting out is perfect right I\nwant to share a phrase with you that\nwill help you out\ndone is better than perfect getting\nsomething done is better than making\nsure that it's 100% perfect they did a\nstudy not too long ago and found out\nthen when someone sinks thinks they're\ndone they're about 95 percent of the way\ndone what someone thinks that they've\ndone a perfect job they've done about 98\npercent so the difference between done\nand the difference between perfect is\nusually only about 3% but sometimes that\nextra 3% can hold somebody back from\nfollowing their dream it can hold\nsomebody back from actually starting\nwhat they want to start and so you have\nto ask yourself is perfectionism ruining\nyour life is it getting in the way of\nyour true potential\nanother question to ask yourself is this\nare you really a perfectionist or is\nthat just a fear that's being masked by\nperfectionism I'll give you an example\nof what I mean you might have the fear\nof failure or the fear of success or the\nfear of rejection or the fear of being\njudged not being good enough or smart\nenough or pretty enough or fit enough\nfor one of those things but you're\ntelling yourself you're a perfection\nso therefore you don't start in order to\nactually not come in contact with the\nreal fear that's happening and so you\nhave to ask yourself that question\nnumber one am I actually a perfectionist\nnumber two is that my perfectionist or\nis it just a fear that's being masked as\nperfectionism because in reality\nperfectionism doesn't really exist we're\nall\nperfectionists\nbut what really is happening is\nperfectionism is just you holding\nyourself to a standard that you might\nnot be at yet and if you don't push\nyourself to at least finish stuff you'll\nnever actually get to the standard that\nyou want to be it we all have really\nhigh standards for us so we all want to\nshoot for the moon and have really great\nthings that we accomplished would that\nbe a blog or a website or a song or a\npiece of art but unless we actually get\nout there and do something we'll never\nget anywhere near it and so the phrase\nthat I want you to remember for today is\ndone is better than perfect\nyou"
