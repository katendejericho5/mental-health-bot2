    "transcript": "is your past holding you back\nfrom your true potential\nwhen you think about your past are you a\nvictim\nor are you a victor\nand let me explain what i mean by that\nmost people when they think about their\npast sometimes they've had good past\nsometimes they've had bad past if you've\nhad a bad past\nare you still a victim of that past\nare you still a victim of that past or\nhave you overcome that past and become\nthe victor of it\nhere's the thing most people like to\nplay the victim card they like to have a\npass they don't like to it just happens\nand they stay with it forever they stay\nwith the victim mindset all their life\ni'm going to tell you something though\nif you have had a bad past you're not a\nvictim\nyou are a\nvolunteer\nand i understand some people that's\nreally going to piss off but let me\nexplain\nwhat i mean by that\nyour past happened to you if it was\npainful\npain is inevitable you're going to have\nsome people are going to have painful\npast you're going to have pain happen to\nyou you might be going through pain now\nand you're probably going to go through\npain in the future\npain is inevitable\nsuffering\nis not\nyou have to be a volunteer in order to\nsuffer pain will happen to you\nsuffering is not something that has to\nhappen so when i say you're a victim\nthat means that something could have\nhappened to you in your past but when i\nsay that you're a volunteer that means\nthat you allow it to still hold you back\nyou allow it to still be painful today\ndid it happen whatever it was\nyeah it did\nbut you don't have to allow that to hold\nyou back anymore you don't have to allow\nthat\nto still take up time in space\nmental capacity in your brain every\nsingle day\nyou are allowing it to happen and i get\nit\ni've been through painful stuff you've\nbeen through painful stuff but it\ndoesn't have to hold you back anymore it\ndoesn't have to hold us back anymore\nwe're in this together right\nwe're in this together you don't have to\nsuffer from what happened to you in your\npast anymore i'm gonna let a secret out\nto you though if you don't get rid of\nthis suffering\nit will hold you back forever you get\none\none life to live\ndo you want\nsomething that happened to you in your\npast that you cannot change\nto hold you back for the rest of your\nlife you get one chance\ndo you want this event that cannot be\nchanged to hold you back you can't\nchange the event can you no but what you\ncan do\nis change the way that you view the\nevent\nchange the way that you think about what\nhappened to you\nright that's how you become a victor for\nme personally if you know my story my\nfather was an alcoholic and he passed\naway when i was 15 years old\nyeah that could hold me back i could\nallow that to hold me back i could allow\nthe pain that i went to through to still\nexist\nand to make me suffer for the rest of my\nlife but instead\nwhat i decided to do and please don't\ntake this is me bragging this is not me\ntrying to act like i'm better than you\nor anybody else i'm just giving you my\nexample of what happened with my life\nis i took that\nwhat was a terrible thing\nand allowed it to be a great thing for\nme one thing that's weird for people to\nhear is i always say this the worst day\nof my life was when my father passed\naway the best day of my life was when my\nfather passed away\nand it wasn't because he was out of my\nlife anymore it was because of the fact\nthat i came to the realization that i\nget one chance to live on this planet\ni'm gonna do everything that i possibly\ncan and i wake up with a hunger to do\neverything that i possibly can because i\nknow that day is approaching and it\nmight be approaching quicker than i\nrealize\nso what did i do i can't change the past\nbut i can change the story that i'm\ntelling myself\nabout that painful moment in the past it\nhappened\ni can't change it\nit happened for you whatever it is you\ncan't change it but what you can change\nis the story that you're telling\nyourself\nif it happened in the past you're not a\nvictim of it\nif you're still allowing it to hold you\nback\nyou're a volunteer\nbecause pain is inevitable suffering is\nnot the way that you change from a\nvolunteer slash victim to a victor is\nyou change the story that you're telling\nyourself about the event\ninstead of that being something that\nholds you back\nit can be something that pushes you\nforward\nand so ask yourself what's holding me\nback what painful event is holding me\nback what's the story that i'm telling\nmyself about that painful event\nand how can i change that event that's\nholding me back the story that i'm\ntelling myself about this event\nhow can i change that story into\nsomething that's going to empower me and\nsomething that's going to propel me\nforward\nand that is how you switch from a\nvolunteer slash victim\ninto\na victor\nso if you like this episode please share\nit with someone that you know\nif you know someone that would get\nsomething from it please share it with\nthem also hit the subscribe button\nand i appreciate you and i hope that you\nhave an amazing day\nyou"
