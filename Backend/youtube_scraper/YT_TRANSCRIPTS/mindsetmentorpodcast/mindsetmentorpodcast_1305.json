    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nlowering\nyour standards\nnow\nthis might seem counterproductive it\nmight seem like something that i would\nnever talk about but the problem with\nhaving extremely high standards or\nsetting your sites way too high\nis that you become too intimidated and\nyou don't even take any action at all\nand so think about it would you rather\nhave really high standards and do\nnothing or would you rather have lower\nstandards that don't intimidate you but\nyou can actually get going because you\ndon't become demotivated\nfrom looking at those standards\nintel when it was one of the biggest\ncompanies in the world and it was really\ncranking as a company and their sales\npeople were some of the best sales\npeople in the world they did a study to\nfind out why their sales people were so\ngood they actually had the lowest quotas\nin the entire industry\nthe reason why was because they felt\nthat if they gave them lower quotas they\nwouldn't be as intimidated and they\nwouldn't be as scared\nand so therefore it'd be easier for them\nto create action\nand so you have to think about this\nanother example of this is tim ferriss\nwho's a writer he talks about his goal\nevery single day is just to write two\ncrappy pages not great amazing pages two\ncrappy pages he gives himself a very low\nstandard\nand what he finds if he just writes two\ncrappy pages and that's his standard it\ndoesn't have to be something amazing\nthen some really amazing writing comes\nfrom that\nit's not something that holds him back\nhe doesn't get into his own head and try\nto be a perfectionist and then not start\nhis writing each day because the fact\nthat he's too intimidated\nanother example of this is neil strauss\nwho is another famous writer that says\nwriter's block does actually not exist\nwhat it is is its performance\nstandards that are blocking you from\nbeing creative\nand so what i want you to think about if\nyou think about your goals for the year\nyou think about\nyou know your goals for the year might\nbe huge\nbut that might actually intimidate you\nto think that far ahead and to think\nthat big so instead can you take your\ngoal for the year and mark it into\nsmaller little chunks what about the\nnext 30 days\nthat's not as intimidating when you\nthink 30 days ahead so take your goals\ntake whatever it is that you're working\ntowards and take it into smaller less\nintimidating chunks so that therefore\nyou don't become demotivated from doing\nit and it actually allows you to create\naction versus holding yourself back by\nlooking at these massive goals"
