    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to today's episode today we're\ngoing to be talking about mentors what\nis a mentor\nwhy you want to find a mentor and also\nif you should pay for a mentor and\nreally what a mentor is and what it'll\ndo for you so\nwhat is a mentor first off it's somebody\nwho's either further along in life than\nyou or they could also\nbe someone who's younger than you but\nthey have a specific skill set or\nsomething that you're further along in a\nbusiness that you want to get good at a\nmentor is someone who is just further\nalong than you are there's somebody who\nwill shorten your learning curve and\nmake it easier for you to be successful\nat whatever it is\nit could be for instance i've had\nmentors for years my very first mentor\nwhen i was 19 years old i paid 500 a\nmonth to have a mentor that taught me\nhow to get good at becoming number one\ntreating myself like i was running a\nbusiness and got me better at my\nbusiness and took me for making\nseventeen thousand dollars a year to\nwithin a year and a half of coaching\nwith him to making a hundred and seventy\nseven thousand dollars per year so that\nperson has not only made me money in\nthat aspect\nbut man they've made me money\nmillions of dollars over the past 10\nyears 11 years 12 years since i\noriginally started coaching with him so\nmentors are extremely extremely\nbeneficial they don't have to be just\nfor business they don't have to be just\nfor money\nit could be that you could find someone\nwho has a really good relationship a\nreally good marriage and you and your\nwife or you and your husband start\nhanging out with them more and they\ncould be mentors as far as a\nrelationship goes so mentors can be for\neverything i have mentors that teach me\nguitar i have mentors that teach me\nvocal lessons for singing i have mentors\nthat teach me a\nrecording uh program that's on my\ncomputer i have mentors i have a mentor\nfor physical\nfor working out for dieting for all of\nthose things and then i have mentors\nthat are further along than me in\nbusiness i have mentors that are further\nalong than me and just psychology and\nthey just keep me you know they're\nhappier they're healthier they're more\non point than i am and i want to be\naround those people so a mentor is just\nsomebody who is further along than you\nare now\nwhy would you want to have a mentor\nthere's a ton of different reasons\nnumber one these people are going to be\nin your top five there's someone that\nyou might not hang out with as much but\nyou know the five people that you hang\nout with the most um is going to be you\nif you hang out with five alcoholics\nyou're probably going to be the six if\nyou hang out with five millionaires\nyou're probably going to be the six as\nwell so it's extremely important to\nthink of the people that you hang out\nwith the most uh so the first thing that\nthat mentors will do is they will make\nyou up your game when you hang out with\nsomebody who is i have a a couple people\nthat i don't spend a ton of time with\nbut a few times a year\nthat are worth over a billion dollars\nwhen you hang out with somebody who's in\nthat realm\nof just\nmental capacity and business capacity it\nmakes you up your game it makes you\nbecome better whenever you're around\nthose people when you see the stuff they\ndo or the stuff they have\nit also makes you go man maybe i'm\nmaybe i'm dreaming a little bit small if\nthis is this shows you human potential\nand so it completely makes you up your\ngame\nby having them uh so like i said upping\nyour game is one of them uh also another\nthing that you have to think about is it\nputs you in the right frame of mind\nright they're the type of person who you\nmight hang out with every single week or\nyou might hang out with them every\ncouple months but they put you in the\nright frame of mind\nby\nyou know you might be able to listen to\nthem talk about something that\nthey think completely different than you\nor you might have something that could\nseem as a negative and they might be\nable to find an opportunity for it to\nactually be positive for you so there's\nsomeone who can take your mindset\nand really make you think in a different\nway and that's always a good thing is to\nhave someone challenge you and to make\nyou think in a different way\nanother thing that's really good about\nhaving a mentor is being around them is\nit makes you\nmakes you take action being around them\nwhether they tell you to take action and\nyou want to be held accountable because\nyou don't want to be the person that\ntells them the story a mentor a story\nabout something and they say hey here's\nwhat i think you should do and you don't\ndo it and the next time you talk to them\nthey ask you about it and you don't have\nit done it makes you take action because\nit is an extra level of accountability\nof someone who's going to be holding you\naccountable to your goals what you want\nand what you say you want to do as well\nthey help you make the right decisions\nbecause you can ask them they they could\nhave been through what you've already\nbeen through and so you could say hey\nhere's what i'm dealing with what should\ni do and that mentor will be able to say\nhey here's what i would do or here's\nwhat i did do when i was in your\nsituation and they help you make the\nright decisions\none of the biggest reasons why you want\nto have a mentor is they help you save\ntime and energy and in reality they also\nmake you more money in the long run like\ni told you before i went from making 17\nto 177 000\nby having this mentor that's that's 10\ntimes my income so not only should they\nsave me time and energy they should make\nme more money and i'll talk about that a\nlittle bit later but saving time and\nenergy is this\ninstead of going out and failing and\nmaking mistakes and going through life\nfor business or finances with trial and\nerror\nyou get to talk to these people who have\nalready been through what you've been\nthrough they might be 10 15 20 years\ndown the road further than you are and\nby having one conversation with them\ncould save you two or three years\nthat's a huge deal of why you want to go\nout and find mentors\nalso what happens is they help you they\nhelp push you but also maintain your\nmotivation\nthis is one thing when you're around\nsomebody who's super successful you get\nmotivated to be as successful for them\nas them like i told you if i hang out\nwith someone who's a billionaire i'm\ngoing to be much more motivated when i\ncome back on monday after hanging out\nfrom them on the weekend and see all of\nthe stuff that they have or all of the\nfun that they have or the trips that\nthey take or the life that they have it\nmotivates me to start doing more work\nthan i already do\nanother thing that you have to think\nabout as well is a mentor also opens you\nup to their circle of friends\nthis is big this is really big to think\nabout when you become friends with or\nyou have a mentor who's successful guess\nwho they hang out with\nother extremely successful people\nso there's a chance that when they start\nliking you they start hanging out with\nyou more than they think hey\nyou know we're going to go out and we're\ngoing to go get some dinner you should\ncome with us\nit opens you up to more people who are\nsuccessful as well\nalso another thing that's really good\nabout mentors is their secrets\nright if someone's a millionaire or a\nbillionaire they have secrets in\nbusiness they have secrets in life they\nhave secrets and happiness and finances\nand all of these things\nif they like you\nthey will open you up to their secrets\nwhich will make you go further along as\nwell\nall in all what a mentor really does is\nit makes you learn faster it shortens\nyour learning curve now\nyou might be asking that sounds really\ngreat how do i find a mentor well\nthere's a couple different ways number\none\nyou could try to find a free mentor\nwhich is what most people do because\nmost people are cheap and even though\nthey say they care about their success\nthey don't really care about their\nsuccess as much as they think they do so\nthey go super cheap you know they'll\nspend\na 500 bucks a month on a brand new car\nand phone bills and all of these things\nbut they won't spend 500 bucks a month\nto talk to a millionaire right\nit doesn't make any sense but let me say\nthis there's free you could get free if\nyou wanted to\num and there's pros and cons to free and\npaid but the way you find someone who's\nfurther along than you are if you want\nto find someone who's free or someone\nwho might who's free right now who might\nturn into a paid mentor is you have to\nget yourself out there that's the first\nstep to finding a mentor you have to do\nnetworking i personally\nhate going to networking events but i\nforce myself to go to them because i\nknow there's people out there that are\nway more advanced than i am that are\nreally good at what they do and i could\ntry to build a relationship with them so\nhow do you find them\nyou can go to meetup.com you could\nsearch your area you could go on google\nyou could go on facebook there's a bunch\nof different ways but in order to find\nsomebody you have to put yourself out\nthere you have to have to put yourself\nout there\nyou could also pay for a mentor as well\nand so there's pros and cons to both the\npros of a free mentor free obviously\nright\nthe pros of a paid mentor\nis that that person\nfeels accountable for your success and\nthis is what most people don't think\nabout\nwhen someone's a free mentor a quote\nunquote free mentor to be kind of just\nlike a\nsemi friend or acquaintance they don't\nfeel liable for your success they don't\nfeel like you have to succeed or it's\ntheir fault\nwhen you have a paid mentor they have\nthe extra level of accountability of\nmaking sure in their head if you're\npaying them\nif they're a good mentor they better\nfreaking make sure you get some results\nand that's how you have to think about\nit they need to make sure you get\nresults and in their head if they're a\ngood person they're going to work harder\nthey're going to give you more time\nthey're going to answer your text\nmessages they're going to answer your\nemails they're going to talk to you more\noften and that's the benefit of a paid\nmentor\nwhat's the cons of a paid mentor exactly\nlike i said they're not going to\nhold your hand and hold you accountable\nwhat's the the cons of a paid mentor uh\nthe fact that you have to pay money\nthat's fine that's basically it of it so\nthe pros and cons a free mentor is free\nbut they're not going to be on top of\nyou and making sure you get things done\nin that extra level accountability that\nmost people really need\nthe pros and cons of a paid mentor is\nthat this paid mentor is going to make\nsure you are successful they feel\nliable for your accountability so if\nyou're not succeeding at the level that\nyou should be if you're not making money\nat the level you should be they're going\nto put more time into you\none thing that my first mentor and i\npaid 500 bucks a month for them\ntold me is that by coaching with me i\nshould make you more money\nand so you have to think about it that\nway if you're paying 500 bucks or 600 or\n700 bucks a month\nyou should be making that money back and\nnow here's the thing you won't make that\nmoney back right away in six months down\nthe road you should be making that money\nin a year you should be making that\nmoney two years down the road the\nshifting that they're going to do inside\nof your mind inside of your daily habits\nwill make you that money back 100\nmy first coach when i was 19 years old\nrocked my freaking world changed my life\nchanged my daily habits changed\neverything which 11 years down the road\nnow 12 years down the road now my life\ni'm a completely different person than i\nwould be so it's not going to pay off\nright away\nbut if they're a good mentor it will\ncompletely pay off in the way that you\nlive your life on a day-to-day basis so\nthat's what a mentor is that's the\nbenefits of having a mentor and that's\nhow to find a mentor so all in all this\nis important put yourself out there be\naround people who are better be around\npeople who will hold you accountable and\nbe around people who make you think\nbigger and naturally you will start to\nchange stuff in your life"
