    "transcript": "[Music]\ntoday what we're going to be talking\nabout is being productive versus just\nbeing busy and I'm sure you've felt this\nway before where one day you go in you\nwork and you work you're working really\nhard but no matter how hard you work at\nthe end of the day you still feel like\nyou did not get anything done or you\ndidn't get enough done and this is one\nof the big differences between being\nproductive versus being just busy so an\nexample of this if you think about it if\nyou make a to-do list of everything that\nneeds to be done for the day most people\nwhat they like to do is check off as\nmany boxes as possible they think that\nif they check off as many boxes as\npossible they will have gotten a lot\ndone for the day but what happens when\nyou do that is when you're just\nconcentrating on checking off boxes what\nyou're doing is you're getting all of\nthe easy tasks all the easy things that\nneed to be done for the day but that\ndoesn't mean that you're going to get\nall the productive stuff done and so the\ndifference between being productive and\nbeing busy is instead of looking at your\nto-do list and thinking how can I get as\nmany boxes checked off as possible is to\nlook at your to-do list and say what is\nmy number one thing that has to be done\ntoday what is my number two thing what\nis my number three thing and you\nprioritize the most important things\nthat need to be done each day and what\nyou do is you don't go to bed until\nnumber one two and three are done and if\nnothing else gets done for the rest of\nthe day it will still feel like a\nproductive day the reason why is because\nyou are concentrating on the things that\nmatter the most right now not focusing\non getting laundry under doing the\ndishes you're concentrating on things\nthat are going to make you productive or\nmake you more money right now a great\nquestion to ask yourself if you're in\nstress or if you want to make more money\nis just ask yourself the question how\ncan I make money right now what can I do\nright now that might get me more money\nin my pocket at this second or in the\nfuture that's the difference between\nbeing productive versus just being busy\nbeing busy is just getting things done\nlittle tiny tasks being productive is\ngetting things done that matter and\nthat's the difference between a\nsuccessful person and an unsuccessful\nperson an analogy a way to think of this\nis if you're a lion are you running\naround chasing Antelope or you running\naround all day long chasing field mice\nlittle tiny things they're not going to\nfill you up but if you chase an antelope\nyou get that one big thing done for the\nday you get those two big things done\nfor the day you're going to feel\nproductive at the end of the day if you\ndo that if you do this every single day\nyou're going to be very productive over\na week over months over years you're\ngoing to be extremely productive and so\nnext time you you you feel that you're\nbusy you feel like you're doing a lot\nyou feel like you're you're just\nstressed out because you have so much to\ndo ask yourself the question what's the\nmost important thing right now am I am I\nbeing productive or am I just keeping\nbusy and that's the key to being\nextremely productive and getting the\nthings done that matter getting your\nto-do list together and prioritizing the\nmost important things that need to be\ndone right now"
