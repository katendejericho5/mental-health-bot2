    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome today what we're going to be\ntalking about is winners versus losers\nand how football in every single sport\nis the perfect analogy for life now i\ngot inspired to do this because of last\nnight's football game super bowl 51\ni'm personally not a patriots fan or not\na tom brady fan either and not up until\nlast night at least when i watched the\npatriots come back from 25 points back\nand i realized at that point in time\nthat winning\nis a mindset winning is a habit\nand most people most teams wouldn't have\nthe mindset of yeah we can come back\nwhen it's 25 points back\nin the third quarter\nbut some people just have it in them\nwhere it is impossible for them to lose\nthey will not allow themselves to lose\nthey would either die\ntrying to win\nor they'll win and that's just kind of\nthe way that some people think about it\nand winning is a mindset winning is a\nhabit\nbut you know it also is a habit and a\nmindset so is losing and i feel like\nmost people have a loser's mindset and i\ndon't mean that i hope it doesn't come\noff the wrong way but what i mean is\nthat most people in that situation would\nhave counted themselves out would have\nsaid this isn't for me we're not good\nenough to win this game\npeople would say the exact same thing\nthis job isn't for me running my own\nbusiness isn't for me this isn't really\nmy passion and they give up\nbefore they get to the finish line\nbefore the bell goes off most people\nwould have given up\nwinning is a habit winning is a mindset\nso the question that i have for you\nis what's your mindset like if you were\nin that situation would you have given\nup because i feel like that game was the\nperfect analogy for life the difference\nbetween winners as loot and losers is\ntheir mindset when things are not going\nthe way they want them to go\nmost people give up\nbefore they get to success most people\ngive up\nbefore the final bell goes off\nand i you have to realize that once you\ngive up in your head the game is already\nover and that's what i loved about last\nnight's football game was even though\nthey were down by 25 points\nthey still didn't give up they didn't\ngive up until the end of the game they\ndidn't give up until the final bell went\nover and they scored the touchdown in\novertime that's when they finally said\nokay now it's over because in their mind\nit's not over until it's over\nwinning is a habit\nwinning is a mindset\nlosing is also a habit\nlosing is also a mindset\nand so the question that i have for you\nis this\nwhen your backs against the wall when\nthings start to get hard\nwhen it seems like it's impossible for\nyou to overcome this insurmountable task\nthat's in front of you\nwhat's your default\nis your default to to fight as if you're\na caged animal up against the wall and\nto fight and push and do whatever you\ncan to get out of it\nor is it to just decide to give up\nbecause the difference between winners\nand losers is that losers give up\nwinners\nwill not give up until they win or until\nthe final bell goes off\nthat's the difference\nand so i want you to ask yourself\ndo i have the winner's mindset\ndo i have the habits of a winner\ndo i go and go and go until the final\nbell goes off or do i have a loser's\nmindset\ndo i quit\nbefore things go the way i want them to\ndo i quit\nwhenever i get the first little bit of\nfailure or whenever my back's against\nthe wall\nbecause here's the deal it's a mindset\nit can be switched if you want to be\nsuccessful all you have to do is just\nnot\ngive\nup\nthat's it your skills will improve you\nwill gain momentum\nbut your skills won't improve and you\nwon't gain momentum unless you put the\ntime in that's needed in order to get to\nsuccess\nand so when you think about last night's\nfootball game when you think about that\nand you watch somebody overcome 25\npoints behind\nthey have that sort of belief in\nthemselves\nand here's the deal\nyou have to have that sort of belief in\nyourself as well and it only comes from\ngoing out there and starting to push\nyourself becoming better gaining\nconfidence that's how you become a\nwinner\nif you have a loser's mindset now it\ndoesn't have to be that way forever you\ncan decide right now that you're going\nto start making adjustments that you're\nnot going to give up to anymore that\nyou're not going to allow yourself to\nquit when things get tough and that\nyou're going to fight and fight and\nfight until the final bell\nrings"
