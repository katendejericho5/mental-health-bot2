    "transcript": "my name is rob dyle today we're going to\nbe talking about sensory deprivation\ntanks if you like this episode\ndo me a favor consider subscribing but\nhere we go\nall right so today we're going to be\ntalking about sensory deprivation tanks\none of my favorite things also known as\nfloat tanks\nand a sensory deprivation tank as crazy\nas this is going to\nsound is exactly what you would think it\nis it is a tank that deprives you of all\nof your senses so i'll kind of give you\na quick idea of exactly what it is\nand i'll give you the benefits of it and\nit's going to sound crazy to you i\npromise\nbut when you hear the benefits you'll\nstart to understand why they're so\namazing why they're starting to rise in\npopularity why i love them and why i\nthink that you should give it a shot as\nwell so what is a sensory deprivation\ntank to give you an idea there's a bunch\nof different sizes\nbut personally i am claustrophobic so if\nthese were too small i would not be able\nto get in them the place that i go to it\nhas the same length and width of a queen\nsize bed and i can stand up inside of\nthe entire tank itself\nnow the tank is a tank that has about 12\ninches of water in it and you float\ninside of the water there's 1200 pounds\nof epsom salt\ninside of it and it's gonna sound crazy\nbut just trust me\nwhat you do is you get inside of it\nnaked\nit's don't worry it's it's got 1200\npounds epsom salt it's also got a\nprofessional\nuh pool cleaner uh pool filter that's on\nit as well\nand they put 1200 pounds of epsom salt\nand the skin the temperature your skin\ntemperature is somewhere around 93.8\ndegrees or something like that your core\ntemperature is 98.6 degrees but your\nskin temperature is like 90 let's say\nit's 93.8 right well the water\ntemperature\nand the air temperature inside the tank\nis 93.8 degrees at z whatever the exact\ntemperature of your skin is\nit's the exact temperature and the\nreason why is because you're trying to\ndeprive\nyour body of its senses\nso if the water and the air are the same\ntemperature as your skin\nthen\nobviously you're not going to feel\nanything when you shut the door it's\ncompletely pitch black so you can't see\nanything\nthe tank itself is also\nsound proof which means you can't hear\nanything obviously you're not tasting\nanything and you're not smelling\nanything either so what you do is doing\nis literally depriving your body\nfrom its five senses\nso you're depriving your body of its\nfive senses and you might ask what's the\nbenefit of that\nthink about this in our crazy days that\nwe have nowadays the average person just\nso you know i saw a study the other day\nsaid the average person in the 80s had\nhad a an attention span of about 20\nminutes\n20 minutes in the 80s\nthe average person nowadays has an\nattention span\nof you ready just take a guess in your\nhead how long do you think that it is\nit was 20 minutes a long time ago what\ndo you think it is now\neight seconds\njust think about that for a second\neight seconds\nwe have so many\ndifferent types of way that our\nattention is stolen from us there's\nadvertisements everywhere there's\nbillboards everywhere there's signs\neverywhere there's facebook there's\ntwitter snapchat they're instagram\nthere's people who want to walk in your\noffice there's all of these things\nand so the good thing about the sensory\ndeprivation tank is it finally allows\nyou to just be with yourself and relax\nnow\ni realize this most people hear this and\nthey go an hour in a tank being\ncompletely deprived of senses absolutely\nnot i cannot do it and the first thing\nthat i have to say to you is because you\nare afraid\nof what you're going to find inside of\nyour head\nthe reason why you are afraid to do a\nsensory deprivation tank if that sounds\ncrazy to you is because you're afraid to\nfind out what's inside your head it's\nprobably the same reason\nwhy you haven't started meditating like\nyou want to or that you know that you\nshould that's the reason why most people\nwon't use a float tank\nand so the the benefits of the the float\ntank itself and like i said most people\nare saying i can't do that in case you\nwant to know some of the benefits also i\nsaw an article not too long ago that\nsteph curry\nevery single week goes to use a float\ntank to completely disconnect from\neverything and so\nwhen you say oh man i have to go into\nthis float tank for an hour and this\npeople always ask how long is it 15\nminutes 20 minutes no it's anywhere\nbetween 60 to 90 minutes is on average\nwhat i do that's what most people do but\nyou can actually go longer if you want\nto as well\nso\ni understand you're listening to that\nyou're saying that's crazy what are the\nbenefits well think about it your entire\nlife since the second you were born\nyou've never had a second\nwhere you haven't had some type some\ntype of sensory\ncoming in some type of stimuli coming in\neven if you sit\ndown\nin complete silence you're still hearing\nthe cars outside\nyou're still hearing the wind\nyou're still feeling\nthe feet your feet on the ground you're\nstill feeling the seed underneath your\nbutt you're still feeling all of these\nthings so\nsince the second you were born you've\nnever once been deprived of senses\nimagine what it would be like to give\nyour brain a break\nand so you have to think about that\nthat's one of the benefits of doing it\nso\nit allows your brain to really finally\nrelax and it's exactly like meditation\nthe first couple times you do it well\nthe first time i did it\nmy brain was all over the place but i'll\ntell you more about my experiences and\nhow they how it went for me but\nit's more like meditation on steroids\nthe reason why is because you don't have\nanything you can listen to you don't\nhear any birds chirping you don't have\nyour your dog rustling around in the\nbackground that can steal your attention\nyou have nothing that can steal your\nattention from diving deep into your own\nbrain\nand figuring out what's really going on\nin there and the reason why most people\nare not going to do it or they say they\ncould never do that\nis because they're afraid of what\nthey're going to find inside of their\nbrain\nthey're afraid and that's the same\nreason like i said why people don't\nmeditate because they know the benefits\nbut they're afraid of what they're going\nto find in the inside of their brains\nso what's crazy though is that our\nbrains are so here's what's what's\npretty nuts about it our brains are so\naddicted to stimuli to constantly\ngetting some type of stimuli all day\nlong that a lot of people actually go\ninto these float tanks and start to\nhallucinate\nhallucinate that's the word i was\nlooking for hallucinate different things\nthey'll start to see different things\nthey'll start to hear things that\nweren't there\ni swear the last time i was last\nsaturday i was in one the last time i\nwas in it i heard music\ncoming on because once your float is\nover your hours up they start to music\nstarts to come on just a little bit\nuh i swear i heard music there was\nabsolutely no music going on i finally\nstarted to start to i started to see\nhallucinations things going in between\nmy eyes i thought someone turned a light\non because it was so bright how bright\nit looked you know when your eyes are\nclosed and you can you could tell\nsomebody just turned a light on i saw\nthat when my eyes were closed and i\nopened up my eyes and it was still\ncompletely black\nand so a lot of people actually\nhallucinate but it allows you to\nhallucinate it allows you to relax it\nallows you to go into deep deep deep\nstates of meditation my best ideas that\ni've ever had my idea for the podcast\ncame from being inside of a float tank\nwhere i was like you know what i should\nactually do that my idea for my group\ncoaching came from being inside of that\nmy last one that i went on this past\nsaturday i got an amazing idea which i\npersonally know is going to make me tens\nif not hundreds of thousands of dollars\nso\nthat's one of the benefits because you\nget to cut through all of the surface\nlevel crap that's coming into your day\nevery single day and start to dive\ndeeper into your brain and deeper into\nyour subconscious and you start to\nactually get the really good ideas when\nyou do that\nother things that are that are benefits\nof going to a float tank it lowers\ncortisol\nwhich is a stress hormone it lowers your\nheart rate it normalizes your blood\npressure levels it restores your normal\nbreathing rate and also it normalizes\ndigestive functions as well and with\nthere being 1200 pounds of epsom salts\nin it as well it's also really really\ngood for your muscles and it's really\ngood for your muscles to to start to\nrelax because there's a lot of magnesium\nthat's in there and the magnesium that\ngoes into your muscles allows you to get\nrid of soreness a lot a lot quicker so\nlet me tell you about my experience with\nthem the first time that i've done it\ni've probably done it\nseven or eight times now um and i've\ndone an hour every single time uh but\nthe first time i did it it was all right\nit wasn't anything special it was like a\nlittle bit of a meditation but it was\nkind of getting used to being inside of\na tank\nand doing this for the very first time\nthe second time that i did it was\nactually the craziest experience out of\nall of them and so the second time that\ni did it\nthe easiest way to explain the way that\ni felt was about 30 minutes into it i\nrealized that i could legitimately not\nfeel my legs and i could not feel my\nmuscle or my my hands and my arms and so\nthere was a mini panic attack in my\nbrain for a second because i was like\nholy crap did i just and i wasn't moving\nyou the point is not to move obviously\nbecause if i move i'm going to feel the\nwater\nrushing against my skin and that's going\nto kind of break the little meditation\nthat i was in\nso i didn't move and there was a mini\nfreak out at first like holy crap i\ncan't feel my arms and legs and then the\nsecond thing i thought was this is how\nit's supposed to be and the easiest way\nto explain it\nis it it was kind of like if you were i\nfelt like i was a sugar cube and you\nknow how you put a sugar cube in water\nand it slowly dissolves i felt like my\nbody was slowly dissolving and the only\nthing that i could feel was the water\nagainst my face because it comes up to\nyou know about your cheeks it doesn't go\ninto your eyes or anything like that but\nit comes up to you know about your\ncheeks or so\nand uh\nand the other only thing i could feel\nwas my heartbeat on the water so i could\nfeel the waves that my heart was making\nso all i could feel was my heart\nbeat\nin my face those are the only two things\ni could feel in my body for about 30\nminutes and i was like this is the\ncraziest experience i've ever had and\nthis this is what really sold me on holy\ncrap i should keep doing this because\nthis was an amazing experience so then i\nget out and it's really nice place it's\nlike a spa more than anything else\ni get out i go and take a shower it was\nthe best shower i've ever had in my\nentire life it was like everything\nit was it was honestly like the closest\nthing i could if it's basically the\nexact equivalent of um you know it\nreally is honestly if you if you start\nto think about the benefits of it it's\nbasically the the natural equivalent of\nsomebody doing mali i guess you could\nsay because what it is is it's actually\neverything feels amazing if you've ever\nseen someone that like does ecstasy or\ndoes molly whatever and they're like oh\nmy gosh everything feels amazing that's\nreally how it was i got in the shower\nand i was like whoa this is crazy this\nis the best feeling shower i've ever\nfelt\nand then i got out got into my car\nand i was about to pull out of the\nparking lot and i was like oh my gosh\nthese cars are going so fast and the\ncars are it's a it's on a small little\nroad they're probably going 35 miles an\nhour\nbut because of the fact that i deprived\nmy brain of the senses\neverything was so much crazier the\ncolors were deeper the cars looked like\nthey were moving faster i remember\ndriving home and i was gripping the\nsteering wheel and this is a true story\ni was like man this steering wheel i've\nnever actually\nnoticed how the steering wheel feels in\nmy hand\nand so it's it's\nbasically like doing\nnatural drugs i didn't do any drugs or\nanything like that this was my own brain\nthat was doing these things\nand so you have to think about if if it\ndoes that for your brain\nwell then how good of ideas can come\ninto it how\ngood of ideas can come from it and so\nfor me\nwhat i thought was man\nif it can do all of these things well\nthen let me go into a float tank and use\nit as a planning session i'm going to go\nin with a very specific idea so\nsometimes i go in with no\nintention at all\ni just go in use it as a meditation and\nit's very calming very relaxing\nfeel extremely relaxed by the time that\nyou leave\nso it's like a spa experience\nbut also at the same time\nbesides the fact that it's relaxing is\nit is a very great way to get into your\nbrain and start having a planning\nsession so sometimes i'll go in and i'll\nsay okay this part of my business my\nmarketing how i'm marketing on facebook\nlet's say that's an example i want to\nthink about how i can become a better\nmarketer on facebook for my business or\ninstagram or all of these different\nthings or whatever they might be\nand this is where some of my best ideas\ncome from is because i am deep into my\nsubconscious brain my brain is at\ndifferent wavelengths than it normally\nis different frequencies and this is a\nlegitimate thing it's it's at a lower\nfrequency\nand so therefore i'm able to come up\nwith much much better ideas because i\ndon't have the the normal day-to-day of\nemails and facebook and all of these\nthings that can steal my attention and\nso my best ideas come from that\nso my second one was definitely\ndefinitely my craziest one\nso\nthat's basically what a float tank is a\nfloat tank is just a tank that you get\ninside of it's called a sensory\ndeprivation tank or it's called a float\ntank and so if you're looking to find\none in your area if you haven't live in\naustin texas the place that i go to is\ncalled zero gravity\nbut if you don't live in and i don't\nhave any affiliation with them at all\ni'm just telling you just because\nthey're an amazing place and they make\nthey actually make their tanks there\ntheir tanks are amazing and it's uh you\nknow it's they have\na\nmasseuse that you can get they have\nmassage chairs there they have tea and\nthe nicest people in the world and they\nhave crazy neon colors and it's it's an\nawesome awesome place\nbut if you don't live in austin texas\nthe best way to find one is google\nsensory deprivation tank\nand then put in the city that you live\nin and the place that i went to had a\nintroductory offer it was three\nfloats for 99\nwhich was cheaper because what they want\nyou to do is try it out a few times\nbecause sometimes the first or second\none you're still kind of nervous from\nbeing in these tanks but i would\ndefinitely recommend it at least try it\nout and go in it with no intention just\ngo in it with i'm going to try this out\ni'm going to deprive myself of senses\ni'm going to use this as a relaxation\nbecause my brain has never once had a\nbreak in its entire life my entire life\nand so go in with that intention\nthink about it i promise you if you're\nnervous about it it's because you're\nafraid don't be afraid of it don't say\noh i would never do that or i oh i can\nnever do that\nbecause think about it most people don't\nmeditate because they like oh i can\nnever do that but in reality what they\nmean\nis that i don't have the willpower to\nsit still for 20 minutes\ni don't know what i'm going to find in\nmy brain that's the exact same thing\nwith a sensory deprivation tank give it\na shot\nand send me an email or comment at any\nspot that you have wherever this video\nis that you're watching it or wherever\nyou're listening to this as well and let\nme know if you've done it let me know\nwhen you do it and let me know what you\nthink because i am super super curious\nto see what you guys think so if you\nenjoy this episode please do me a favor\nand share it with someone that you love"
