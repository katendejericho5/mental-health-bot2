    "transcript": "[Music]\nin the book the compound effect darren\nhardy talks about success\nbeing like\na hand pumped well\nwhen you first start pumping the well\nyou have to realize that that water is\ncoming from hundreds of feet out of the\nground and you're not going to get any\nwater for a long period of time\nthat is how success is you're going to\nput in a lot of work sleepless nights\nday in day out and you're not going to\nsee any success for a while that is\nwhere most people give up\nyou're also going to get to a point\nwhere you're pumping for a while and\nwater starts trickling out and little\nspurts of water start coming out\nthat's another place where most people\ngive up in their their journey of\nsuccess\nthey give up because they say i've been\nputting in all of this work for so long\nand this is all that i get this little\ntiny bit\nand they give up\nbut then they don't realize\nwhere you really see success is when\nyou're pumping for long enough you put\nthe hard work and you've put in the days\nand hours and the weeks and the years\nthe little tiny habits and then the\nwater starts flowing and it starts\nflowing so much that you don't even have\nto pump as hard anymore the water will\ncontinue to flow\nat max rate without as much effort being\nput in\nthat's the point of success that most\npeople never get to and they never see\nand that's what you have to focus on the\nnext time you're working towards\nsomething don't give up before you see\nresults and when you start to see\nresults and they're smaller than you\nwere expecting don't give up there\neither realize that eventually just like\npumping the well success will start\nflowing\nto you in massive quantities\nbut you just have to keep pumping and\nkeep putting the effort in day in day\nout and eventually you'll get to the\npoint where you can take your foot off\nthe gas a little bit and it's not going\nto slow down the amount of success that\ncomes to you"
