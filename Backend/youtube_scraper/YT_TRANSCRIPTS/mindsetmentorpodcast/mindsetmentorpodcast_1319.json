    "transcript": "welcome today what we're going to be\ntalking about\nis\nto stop thinking and to turn off your\nbrain and just\ndo\nwork and this is something that came to\nme\nabout a month ago or so when i really\ndid not want to go to the gym i have a\ngoal of going to the gym five times a\nweek and uh on my mirror i have a dry\nerase marker and i write down workout\nfive four three two one and when i go my\nfirst day i check off the five so i know\nthere's four days left when i go the\nsecond day i check off the four so i\nknow there's three days left and this is\na process that i go through\nwhere i just have it up on my mirror so\nevery time i go to the bathroom i see\nhow many more times i have to personally\ngo to the gym in order to hit my goal of\nfive times per week and about a month\nago i hit a wall and i was like i do not\nwant to go to the gym today there's just\nsomething about it i don't want to go to\nthe gym\nand inside of my head i said demand\ngreatness\nthis is your goal you have to do it you\nset the goal so now you must go for it\nand not give any excuses\nwhen you set a goal and your goal is to\ndo something and you want to demand\ngreatness from yourself you have to get\nrid of all of the possible excuses and\nwhen excuses pop up you have to say i\ndon't care about these excuses i'm going\nto go anyways you look them in the eye\nand you say yep i see you excuse i see\nyou\nbut that doesn't matter i'm gonna do it\nanyways\nand sometimes you just have to show up\nand put in the work\nshow up and put in the work we can all\nagree that most of the time when you\nhold yourself back one of the main\nreasons why you hold yourself back is\nbecause you're too in your head you're\nthinking too much you're giving excuses\nyou're thinking about ways you could\nfail you're thinking about ways that you\ncould possibly be rejected that\nis when you end up not being as great as\nyou can\nthat is when you\nend up giving excuses of why you\nshouldn't do things\nwhat you should do is learn how to\nget yourself to the point that when you\nfeel like you don't want to do it you've\nbuilt up the mental training this\npodcast my group coaching everything\nthat i do my one-on-one coaching is all\nabout mental training how can you train\nyour brain like it's a muscle every\nsingle day to do things that you don't\nwant to do so when you see obstacles\ncoming your way it's just an experience\nwhere you go nope i'm going to plow\nthrough this thing because i've seen\nsomething like this before\nit's all mental training\nand this is why journaling and goal\nsetting and knowing what you want is so\nimportant 2017 is coming up\nand in 2017 we're going to talk about\nhow you\nneed to have your goals completely set\nup and completely done my group coaching\nwe're going to go over our new year's\nresolutions we're going to go over\neverything we're going to do a full\nresolution planning\nand how to set goals how to journal them\nhow to plan them and how to accomplish\nthem\nthis is why setting goals is so\nimportant is because if you set goals\nand you know exactly where you're going\nand you're clear on exactly where it is\nthat you're going and you work backwards\nand you make a plan it makes it very\neasy because all you have to do at that\npoint in time is to click off your brain\nnot think and just do the work that\nneeds to be done you know what you want\nyou make a plan and you just put in work\njust\nput\nin\nwork\nthat is how things get done things don't\nget done from thinking about doing\nthings or thinking about if you should\ndo things or think about reasons why you\nshouldn't do things or coming up with\nexcuses of why you shouldn't do things\nthat's not how things get done that's\nnot how greatness is made that's not how\ngreatness comes from your life by making\nexcuses or by thinking too much\nso a habit that i want to give you\nthrough this podcast the habit that i\nwant you to think about today or jot\ndown in your journal on your phone\nis how can i learn to develop willpower\nto just do work to just get things done\nand to stop thinking about it if you\nheard my episode in a few months ago\nwhere i talked about things are either\nblack and white either you do something\nor you don't do something and that is it\neither you do something or you don't do\nsomething if you're there's no in\nbetween there's no gray area\nyou might say what if i'm thinking about\nit what if i'm going over all the\npossibilities what if i'm thinking about\nall the different things that could\nhappen if you're thinking\nthat means that you are not doing so you\neither do something or you don't and by\nthinking too much you are absolutely\ndefaulting to not\ndoing it\nand that is the important thing to do\nmental training what i mean by mental\ntraining is getting yourself to the\npoint if you've noticed i talk a lot\nabout mental training getting yourself\nto the point of doing things that you\ndon't want to do you've heard me harp on\nit a lot lately and the reason why if\nyou can do things that you don't want to\ndo it makes it very easy to do the\nthings that you should do\nor the things that need to be done\nor all of those things are easier the\nreason why i wake up in the morning and\njump into a cold bath it was 40 degrees\nthis morning and i was in it for six\nminutes why because i don't want to do\nit if i can eat that frog first thing in\nthe morning if i could do something that\ni don't want to do first thing in the\nmorning then the rest of the day is easy\nthe rest of the day is easy\nmark twain says if you can wake up every\nsingle morning and eat a live frog then\nthe rest of your day is going to be good\nif you can conquer your one thing that\nhas to be done your one most important\nthing that you keep procrastinating on\nand did you keep putting off you could\nget it done right away first thing in\nthe morning the rest of your day feels\namazing and it's already productive\nbecause the most important thing is\nalready done so the one thing that i\nwant you to ask yourself\nright now listening to this episode is\ndo i think too much\nand is that holding me back\ndo i think too much and is that holding\nme back\nand if you can become extremely\nself-aware of the fact that you're\nthinking too much the next time when you\nthink too much guess what's going to\nhappen you're going to go oh i'm\nthinking too much i need to just stop\nand put in the work\nbecause by thinking too much once again\nyou either do something or you don't do\nsomething if you're thinking about it\nyou are not doing it\nso that is very important for you to\nknow\nwith that i'm going to be going more in\ndepth on this episode today\njoin me on facebook\nmwf excuse me it's facebook.com mwf\nmotivation i'm going to be going more in\ndepth on this and i'm going to give you\nthe three
