    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the mwf\nmotivation podcast\ntoday i'm going to be talking about two\nquestions why not\nversus why\nnow\nand before i dive in i don't want to i\nwant you to know that the power of your\nquestions in your life the questions\nthat you ask yourself whether you\nrealize it or not will dictate the\nanswers that you will get will dictate\nthe life that you have\nnow that being said we're constantly\nasking ourselves questions in our head\nall day long whether we realize it or\nnot why am i so a lot of people they\njust like completely break themselves\ndown and i've been in that position\nbefore why am i so stupid why can't i\nget it right why does nobody love me why\ndo i keep failing why am i so afraid of\nthis why am i so afraid of success\nwhat is my problem why do i always do\nthis to myself\nwhy does this always happen to me\nwe're subconsciously and sometimes\nconsciously asking ourselves these\nquestions all the time\nthe questions of why not why am i not\ngood enough\nwhy am i not finished\nwhy is this not perfect\nand a lot of times we call ourselves\nperfectionists\nwe find reasons why this is why why we\ncan't get it done or why it's not done\nyet or why it's not perfect\nyet we haven't taken you know why we\nhaven't taken action because it's not\nthe perfect time\nwe're waiting for things to be perfect\nwe're waiting for the perfect time we're\nwaiting for the perfect chance waiting\nfor the perfect person to come into our\nlife all of these things and i wanted to\nask you a question i want you to answer\nit as honestly as you possibly can\nare you a perfectionist do you see\nyourself as a perfectionist answer the\nquestion yes or no are you a\nperfectionist you sometimes identify\nyourself as a perfectionist\nokay now that you've answered that yes\nor no answer this question\nare you really a perfectionist\nor are you using\nperfectionism as a front for your real\nfear\nare you using perfectionism as a front\nfor\nuh being afraid of failing\nor of being afraid of judged\nbeing afraid of what others will say\nafraid of what others will do\nafraid of succeeding\nso are you a perfectionist\nin reality or is it just a front\nfor a fear that's in the back of your\nmind\nask yourself that question because most\npeople say they're perfectionists but\nnobody's really actually a perfectionist\nwhat they're doing is they're just not\nfinishing because they don't want to\nshow their painting to somebody or they\ndon't want to speak in front of people\nwhatever it might be because they're\nafraid of what might happen afraid of\ngetting judged afraid of what others\nwill say all of these different things\nthey're usually not a perfectionist\nperfectionism\nis actually\nhindering their success\nquote-unquote perfectionism i'll say\nmost of the time you'll find out that\nyou're not a perfectionist you're just\nusing it as\nyou're acting like that's the reason\nbeing a perfectionist\nis the reason why you're not getting it\ndone so how do we get past that how do\nwe get past the front of being a\nperfectionist when in reality we're\nreally all full of it we're not\nperfectionist because that's just a\nbunch of bs\nwell the first thing\nis we need to change our questions and\nthe second thing\nis that we need to write this down done\nis better than perfect\ngetting something done is better\nthan getting something done perfectly i\ncan't tell you how many times i've\nrecorded episodes of my podcast and then\n10 minutes later being like oh\nwhy in the hell did i forget to leave\nthis out like i forgot to put that in\nthere it'd be so much better if i put it\nin but then i say to myself it's done\ndone is better than perfect\nso what do we do we change the questions\nthat we ask ourselves\nright we change the questions from the\nwhy not questions to the why now\nquestions the quality of your life\ndepends on the quality of the questions\nthat you ask yourself\nso instead of the why not questions that\nyou were asking yourself that we went\nover at the beginning of the episode we\nneed to switch it to the why now\nquestions questions like why is now the\nbest time to start\nwhy am i ready right now\nwhy am i completely capable enough to\nget this done now\nwhy are the right people in my life\nright now why do i have the right skills\nright now\nwhy now why now why now why now\nwhy should i start right\nnow\nand you ask yourself these questions and\nyou'll start getting answers to these\nquestions because you're not focusing on\nwhy not you're focusing\non why now if you ask yourself the why\nnot questions you'll find all of the\nreasons of why you should not start\nright now no matter how prepared you are\nno matter how good you are whatever it\nis that you want to do you'll always\ncome up with some bs answer of why you\nshould not start right now\nso when you switch your questions to why\nnow questions you start seeing all of\nthe positives in life all of the\npositive reasons to start right now\nall of the opportunities that are in\nfront of you that you have not been\nfocusing on\nit's like if you have a really good\ncamera you'll notice that a really good\ncamera will focus on just one object and\nit will blur everything else out it's\nfocus\nright so if you're asking yourself why\nnow questions you're focusing on all of\nthe why not questions excuse me you're\nfocusing on all of the reasons why not\nto that's what you're focusing on\nbut if you just turn the dial just a\nlittle bit\nit'll blur out the reasons why not to\nand you'll focus on all of the\nopportunities that are right in front of\nyour face that you have not been seeing\nso what you want to do by asking\nyourself the correct questions is to\nblur out all of the reasons why not to\ndo something\nand get into focus all of the\nopportunities and all the reasons to do\nsomething you blur out all the quote\nunquote perfectionist questions all of\nthe reasons why you should hold off or\nyou shouldn't do it now or why now is\nnot the right time\nin order to go down the road of success\nyou have to take the first step\nand the longer that you wait to get\nthere the longer that you take to take\nthat first step the longer that it's\ngoing to take you to get there to be\nsuccessful so the why now questions\nallow you to ask yourself these\nquestions to take the first step\nand to actually be in charge of keeping\nthe steps rolling as well\nso from this episode what i want you to\ntake is that just by shifting your focus\na little bit just by turning the knob a\nlittle bit\nif you ask yourself why now instead of\nwhy not\nit's just a tiny shift\nthe only difference between why not and\nwhy now is you're turning the t into a w\nthat's it they're so close to being the\nexact same thing but if you can turn\nthat knob on the focus and focus on all\nof the reasons why now\nyou'll blur out all of the reasons why\nnot why you should wait\nand so what i want you to get from this\nis write down why now why should i start\nnow why am i ready now why am i capable\nenough now why do i have the right\nskills why do i have the right people in\nmy why do i have the right people in my\nlife right now\nand if you start asking yourself the\nright questions\nyou'll start having your life changed\nbecause the quality of your questions\nwill dictate the quality of your life\nso with that i hope you enjoyed today's\nepisode if you're interested in any\ngroup coaching or one-on-one coaching\nsend me an email rob\nmwfmotivation.com and i'm gonna leave\nyou the same way i leave you every\nepisode make it your mission today to\nmake somebody else's day better i\nappreciate you and
