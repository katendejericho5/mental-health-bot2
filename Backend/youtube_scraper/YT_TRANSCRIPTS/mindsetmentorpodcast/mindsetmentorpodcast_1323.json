    "transcript": "hello beautiful people what i'm going to\nbe talking about today\nis how to make millions if not billions\nof dollars which is what it seems like\neverybody in the world is focused on and\neverybody wants to do\nbut the problem with that is that\nwhenever i talk to someone who's already\nin that position who's already a\nmillionaire and i've uh connected with\nthree billionaires just this past year\nalone it always seems like\nwhat they focus on is not the same thing\nthe rest of the world focuses on what it\nseems like is that people who go out\ninto the workforce\nwhat they focus on is how much money can\ni make how can i take the job\nthat gets me the most money how can i go\nfor the degree that's going to get me\nthe most money and then they go out into\nthe workforce focusing on how they can\nmake the most money they take the job\nthat pays five thousand dollars more\njust because it's more money and they\nend up hating it but that's the wrong\nprocess if you want to become rich it\nseems to be very simple from the people\nthat i've connected with that are\nextremely successful and what all of\nthem say is pretty much the exact same\nthing you don't focus on money because\nmoney is not what you're actually going\nfor what you focus on is providing as\nmuch value as you possibly can to as\nmany people as possible\nmoney\nis the byproduct of providing\ntons and tons of value\nto as many people as possible it's like\npeter diamandis says he says don't worry\nabout becoming a billionaire figure out\nhow you can\nprovide value to a billion people\nand then at one point in time in your\nlife you could probably charge them one\ndollar for that piece of value\nand you will then become a billionaire\nthat's why if you look at people that we\nwe look up to the most like elon musk or\nlike steve jobs or all of those whether\nyou like them or not they were never\nfocused on the money the money was never\npart of the equation the money came when\nthey provided immense amounts of value\nto people across the world\nvalue is the destination that you should\nbe focusing on so if you're thinking to\nyourself how can i make as much money as\npossible you're already going down the\nwrong road\nwhat you should be thinking you should\nbe asking yourself is how can i provide\nas much value to as many people as\npossible\nand another reason why you want to focus\non value versus just money and digits in\nyour bank account\nis because think of it this way would\nyou rather have a lot of people at your\nfuneral\nor would you rather have a lot of digits\nin your bank account when you die\nwhich one is more important\nlet's say you become rich when you die\ndo you want to be known as the person\nwho was really good at making money and\nhad a lot of toys\nor do you want to be known as a person\nwho impacted many many people's lives\nand just so happen to make a lot of\nmoney doing it\nthere's only one reason\nwhy people\nget where they want to be in life and\nthe reason why is because they're\nputting\npeople don't get to where they want to\nbe in life is the reason why is because\nthey're putting money in the forefront\nand they're constantly thinking about\nhow they can make more\nwhen they should be thinking about one\nthing and that's value\nso the thing that i want you to realize\nis that if you want to be successful if\nyou want to be happy if you can focus\non providing as much value to as many\npeople as possible\nand just focus on that you'll notice\nthat eventually the money will start\ncoming in because money is a byproduct\nof adding value to people's lives"
