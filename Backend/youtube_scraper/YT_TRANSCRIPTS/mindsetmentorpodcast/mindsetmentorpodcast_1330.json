    "transcript": "do you know the main difference between\na successful person and an unsuccessful\nperson the main difference is what\nhappens between their ears what happens\nin their mind an unsuccessful person\nnever takes control they never Master\ntheir mindset a successful person\nMasters their mind and takes control of\neverything that happens to them an\nunsuccessful person thinks that the\nworld happens to them everything happens\nto them and they react to it a\nsuccessful person person thinks that the\nworld happens for them now the\ndifference between the two of them is so\nsmall and most people never take control\nof their mind they never think of their\nmind as something they can take control\nof I'll give you an example it's my\nright hand if I want to squeeze my fist\nI can squeeze my fist why because it's\npart of my body I can make it do what I\nwant it to do now if I went to go\nsqueeze my hand and I couldn't squeeze\nmy hand that would be a small freakout\nmoment because my body would not be\nworking the way that I meant it\nto so that's because it's part of my\nbody your brain is part of your body you\ncan take control of your brain but most\npeople live their entire lives letting\ntheir brain control them and run all\nover the place it's not supposed to work\nthat way you can't control your first\nthought that comes into your head but\nyou can always control your second you\ncan't control your fears that have been\ninra in you since you were young younger\nbut what you can do is take control of\nyour fears and figure out how to work\nwith them to be successful we all know\npeople that are successful that have had\nway worse stories and way worse\nupbringings than you and I so what's the\ndifference between them and everybody\nelse the difference is they didn't let\ntheir\nstory become their entire life they used\ntheir story they played their hand they\nplayed their life with the cars that\nthey were dealt and they figured out a\nway to get there anyways what they\ndecided was that if they're on the route\nto success and things get in their way\nthey're not going to stop that route\nthey're just going to make a detour and\nfigure out another way to get there\nthey're the masters of their mind they\nfigured out what makes them tick they\nfigured out the habits and patterns that\nare best for them to have and the best\nones to get rid of as well so I want you\nto take that with you and realize that\nyou're in control of everything either\nyou decide to take control of your life\nor you give up control and just see what\nhappens to you but I hope that you\nchoose to take control and to M your\nmind and to read and to invest into\nyourself into making sure that you get\nto where you want to go so with that I\nhope that you have an amazing day"
