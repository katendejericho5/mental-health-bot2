    "transcript": "what's the difference between 300 and\n299 you might say that's an easy answer\nit's obviously only one but that's\nactually not true the difference between\n299 is 300 is a heavyweight champion of\nthe entire world versus everybody else\nthat's out there and not too long ago I\nhad billionaire Price Line founder Jeff\nHoffman on my podcast and he told me the\nstory about Evander Holyfield who he's\nfriends with and he was there watching\nEvander do this workout this crazy\nworkout that almost no human in the\nworld could do and it involved 300 sets\nand Jeff was counting for him and then\nEvander came up to him at the end he\nsaid was that 300 or was that 299 I I\ndidn't quite get it and Jeff said I\nthink that was 300 and he said was it\n300 or was it 299 Jeff said I'm pretty\nsure it was 300 and he went back Evander\ndid and did one more set this one crazy\nset to make sure they did 300 and Jeff\nthought this was a crazy idea and he\nsaid what why did you go back and do\nthat I'm pretty pretty sure that you did\n300 and he said the difference between\n300 and 299 is the heavyweight champion\nof the world and everybody else that's\nout there so what you could take from\nthe story is that if you want greatness\nif you want greatness out of your life\nif you want your life to become\nsomething special you need to put in\n100% every single time you do something\nand not come up short not allow yourself\nto come up short so that's the\ndifference between 300 and 29 9"
