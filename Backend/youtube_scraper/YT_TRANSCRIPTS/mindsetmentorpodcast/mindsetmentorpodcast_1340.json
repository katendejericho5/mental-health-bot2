still want to\nyou can go to MWF motivation calm /\nepisode 118 I'm going to put a link to\nmy schedule you can book 20 minutes to\nspeak with me because I'm trying to get\nmore of an idea of all of the people\nthat listen so that I can therefore find\nout about your life and then also make\nthis podcast better as well also I will\nbe announcing it soon into the future\nbut if you are interested in the group\ncoaching that I just started because I\nhave obviously the free podcasts and\nthen i have my one-on-one coaching which\nis much more expensive i wanted to make\nsomething in the middle for everybody\nthat was quite affordable so if you're\ninterested in the group coaching we\nalready have quite a few people that are\nin the group it's growing super fast and\nit's just really cool to see all of the\ninformation that everyone sharing but\nthen also at the same time the stuff\nthat I am starting to teach as well in\nthere so it's a little bit more in-depth\nit's like the podcasts on steroids\npeople keep saying so today what I'm\ngoing to be talking about is my least\nfavorite four-letter word in my least\nfavorite four letter word the one that I\nthink is the most offensive four-letter\nword out of all of them is the word luck\nand I hate the word luck and the reason\nwhy is because I don't believe in it I\nhate it I don't believe in it I don't\nthink that luck exists I don't think\nthat someone is just inherently lucky I\ndon't think that someone is luckier than\nsomebody else I don't think that just\nbecause someone missed in a car accident\nthey almost got hit that they were lucky\nI hate the word luck because I feel like\nit just takes away all control of your\nlife and says that hey I'm not in\ncontrol of anything I'm not the captain\nof this ship I'm not in control of what\nhappens to me if something good happens\nto me then I'm lucky if something bad\nhappens to me that I'm unlucky because\ntoo many people in the world fall back\non the word luck too many people use\nthat word for people who are successful\nand say man they must have gotten lucky\nthey must have had a sick they're so\nsuccessful because they got lucky\ncertain things panned out for them the\nway that they wanted to they say stuff\nlike I wish I was as lucky as them I\nwish my cards played out the way that\ntheir cards played out I wish I could\nhave their luck people say stuff like\nthat and the world luck sucks it\nhonestly just a bunch of BS\nbecause there is no chance you are up to\neverything that happens you have to have\ncomplete control and rods you are\ncomplete control of your life and if\nsomebody is more successful than you are\nthey are not luckier than you what they\ndid was they replace that four-letter\nword luck with a different four letter\nword and that word is work to replace\nthe luck with the work they put the work\nin they did all of the hours they did\neverything that they need to be\nsuccessful and that's why they got there\nand if you're not there the reason why\nisn't because they're lucky the reason\nwhy is because they put more work in I\nthink that the word luck and the word\ntalent those are the two most insulting\nwords that could be said to somebody\nthat's successful luck is an absolutely\ninsulting word to someone who's\nsuccessful the reason why is because\npeople wouldn't look at them 5 10 15\nyears down the road but like back in\ntheir past and go wow they were lucky\nyou know they weren't they weren't there\nwhen they were struggling to eat her\nwhen they were struggling to pay their\nbills or when they were going into debt\ntrying to build their business they\nweren't there for that I remember one\ntime someone saw a picture of I was\nshowing someone that I know a picture of\nmy house and they said something to the\neffect of why that must be nice you're\nlucky and I was like so pissed off at\nthat point and I didn't say anything but\nthe reason why is because if I happen to\nown a house no matter how big no matter\nhow small it is whatever the house is\nI'm not lucky that I got this house it's\nnot it must be nice because that person\nhas the exact same opportunity that I do\nin every single 24 hours the only\ndifference is what we choose to do with\nthose 24 hours because that whole it\nmust be nice thing nothing was given to\nme in this world you know I could also\nmake excuses that I had a lot crappier\nof an upbringing than some other people\nnot my upbringing necessarily because of\nmy my family and everything was great\nbut things happen to me in the past and\nI could use excuses and say that oh I'm\nunlucky for the reasons that all of\nthose things happen to me you know they\nweren't they wouldn't look back at me in\n2010 when I was living in a one-bedroom\napartment and the only things that I had\nin my one-bedroom apartment were a\nmattress on the floor and books that\nwere just laying across every single guy\nI had stacks of books that were on the\noutside because I couldn't even afford\nto have a bookshelf I couldn't go to\nwalmart\ntwenty or thirty dollar bookshelf put my\nbooks on you know in 2010 when I lost\nfifty thousand dollars at the age of 24\nI lost fifty thousand dollars that i had\nin the bank in like a matter of two and\na half months it was just gone and i\nwent from fifty thousand dollars in the\nbank to in debt and they weren't there\nat that point in time when I used to eat\nfor two months straight I ate spaghetti\nwith pasta and the reason why was\nbecause I could go to Walmart and I\ncould buy a box of spaghetti for 88\ncents then I could get a box or a actual\ntin of spaghetti sauce for a dollar 88\nthat doesn't look lucky that doesn't\nlook nobody would look at that and go\nthat must be nice no because that sucked\nthat's just the way that it is but the\ndifference is I just decided to keep on\nputting in the work to build what I\nwanted to it's the exact same way\nforever you're saying all the person\nthat's successful as well they wouldn't\ncall me lucky when I remember the exact\nsame month my air conditioning went out\nis the middle of summer in South Florida\nwhere it rains every single day and it's\nsuper hot and super humid and I used to\nhave to wear a suit every single day to\nmy office and I was 24 years old and my\nAC went out in my car and I couldn't\nafford to buy another AC so I decided\nthat I would leave my house every single\nmorning before the Sun came up and then\nleave my office every single night after\nthe Sun went down because I didn't want\nto get stuck in the Florida heat because\nit was way too hot then I had black\nleather seats in my car that doesn't\nlook nice that doesn't you wouldn't call\nthat lucky and that's not luck and\npeople don't see that side of success\nand it's insulting to people who are\nsuccessful because they're assuming that\nthat person didn't have the struggles\nthat they had to go through there\nassuming that the person didn't get\ndrunk through the dirt every single day\nthey weren't there when they were\nfighting to get bought they weren't\nthere when they were trying to eat they\nweren't they were there trying to be\nable to pay their bills or going into\ndebt just so they could keep their\nbusiness afloat they weren't there for\nall of that and also when you say\nsomething's lot someone's lucky you have\nto think of the way that works in the\nlaw of attraction when you say that's\nlucky it's it's someone's lucky and I\nwish I had that luck what you're\nbasically doing is pushing that away\nfrom you whatever their success they\nhave that you're jealous of or that\nperson is jealous of I'm not accusing\nyou i keep seeing you but whatever that\nperson has your they're pushing it away\nfrom them think about the law of\nattraction the implications of saying\nsomeone is lucky so you have to\nlease the word luck with work instead of\nsaying man that person's lucky you got\nto say man that person probably worked\nthey are freaking tail off in order to\nget to where they are because that's\nwhat they did but the best part about it\nis that's what you can do to you can\nwork your ass off if you really want to\nthere's an insane amount of struggle on\nthe way to success and that's why most\npeople aren't successful because it\nsucks to get there the morning get there\nit's nice but when you're on your way\nthere it absolutely sucks and most\npeople would never go through all of\nthat struggle in order to be successful\nand that's why most people don't most\npeople use the word luck is an excuse\nmore than anything else ninety-nine\npercent of people using an excuse and\nthen they cry about how unjust it is\nthat this person or that certain people\nmake ridiculous amounts of money in the\nworld I don't look at billionaires and\ngo man that's so unjust that's so unfair\ndo they make that much money and you\nshouldn't look that way either because\nwhat happened is they work their tail\noff to get there that's how they got\nthere they worked their tail off by\naccumulating as much knowledge as they\npossibly can training putting everything\nthey possibly could into it and then\nthey got to where they want to that's\nthe thing it's not unjust that some\npeople have tons of money it's done just\nthat some people don't work as hard as\nthese other people and some people say\nwell you know there isn't enough money\nin the world it's unjust there's not\nenough money in the world of course\nthere's enough money in the world you\nhave to have an abundance mindset you\nhave to run if someone becomes a\nbillionaire and they make a lot of money\nwhat are they going to do more of\nthey're going to spend more money which\nmeans that that's just going to be\nrecycled back into the economy and\nsomebody is getting paid from that\nbillionaire for some type of service or\nsome type of product that they have\nthere's more than enough money in the\nworld someone that makes a lot is also\ngoing to spend a lot and somebody in the\nworld is making money off that so it\nmight as well be you or us realize that\nyou're in control of your life you're in\ncontrol of your finances if your bank\naccount is massive and you're excited\nabout it that's your fault that your\nbank account is massive if your bank\ncount sucks or and you're in debt that's\nalso your fault you have to take control\nof everything and take luck in being\nunlucky or whatever that's stupid phrase\nthat you want to use is you have to take\nthat out of your vocabulary completely\nif anything sucks in your life the\nreason why it sucks is because it's your\nfault if anything is great in your life\nthe reason\nwhy is because it's your fault but the\nbest part is you can change everything\nin an instant if you just change your\nmindset of the way you view things you\ncan always change it so if you start\nusing the word luck replace it with work\nthat persons not lucky that person\nprobably worked the freakin tail off to\nget to where they are but the best part\nis you can work your tail off to get to\nwherever you want to as well with that\nonce again if you want to schedule time\nwith me go to MWF motivation calm /\nepisode 118 you can book 20 minutes into\nmy schedule and if you liked this\nepisode please share it with someone\nthat you know and with that leave you\nthe same way I love you every episode\nmake it your mission today to make\nsomebody else's day better I
