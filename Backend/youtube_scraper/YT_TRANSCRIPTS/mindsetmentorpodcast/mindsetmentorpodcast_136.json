    "transcript": "so what have you discovered about how to\ndiscover or find your purpose at this\nstage of life and is there a formula you\nteach people the thing that I hear more\nthan anything else is that most people\ndon't know what their passions are they\ndon't know what their purpose is how\noften do you do something new and\nthey're like not very often and I was\nlike so so here's the the key to it is\nit's okay right now if someone's\nlistening not to know what their purpose\nis it's okay to not know what their\npassion is but it is not okay to not\nwake up every single day and not be in\nconstant pursuit to find what that\npassion is if you don't know what it is"
