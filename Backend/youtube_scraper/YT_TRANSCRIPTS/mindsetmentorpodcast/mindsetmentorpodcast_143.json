    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto take you through a process to\nunderstand your mind understand your\nthoughts and ultimately calm your mind\ndown so you can have more peace let's\ndive in imagine that there's a bird and\nhe's flying around and he's free and\nhe's so soaring through the the air\nthere's there's nothing in his way it's\namazing and then one day he's like I'm\ngoing to take a break and he comes down\nhe finds a nice little Lake to sit on\nland lands on this nice calm lake and\nhe's enjoying it and he enjoys that it's\nit's calm it's tranquil and decides you\nknow what this is a peaceful Lake like\nI'm going to stay here so he stays there\nfor a little while and he ends up\nstaying there for so long that he\nforgets that he can fly and so what\nhappens is he forgets that he can fly\nhe's been resting on the water for such\na long time that he begins to start\nthinking that he can't leave the lake\nand because of the fact that he can't\nleave the lake he starts to identify\nwith the L with with the lake and he\nforgets that one time you know he used\nto fly he forgets that he could\nliterally fly away right now and this\nbird that was you know is still capable\nof flight has become a creature of the\nwater right it's now like a fish it is a\ncreature of the water and it's fine when\nthe water's calm because when the\nwater's calm the birds enjoys it the\nit's it's nice it's tranquil it's\npeaceful the sun's out he can hang out\nbut when the water gets choppy the bird\nstruggles you know it gets really choppy\nthe waves go everywhere it's too windy\ngets water in its mouth and then it\nfears that it might drown and it ends up\nstressing the bird out of course because\nwhen it's calm that's amazing it it it\nwants it to be calm all the time but\nwhen it gets a little bit crazy it\nstresses the bird out it ends up making\nthe bird want to control the state of\nthe water hoping and wanting to control\nto make sure that it is calm all the\ntime but it doesn't realize that any\nattempt that it it it has to\nmanipulate the the water manipulate the\nair manipulate the wind the waves are\ncompletely impossible and it's even\ncounterproductive if you're being honest\nand so a bird can I control an entire\nbody of water and so to put effort in to\ntry to control this thing is completely\nunnecessary and and so what happens is\nthe bird has to remember that it can fly\naway again it has to disidentify itself\nwith that Lake that it has been on for\nso long years maybe and so when you look\nat it I'm going to dive deep in this\nstory and talk a little bit more about\nit the story behind the B the bird is\nbasically a metaphor for our human\ncondition and specifically our struggle\nto maintain a sense of control over our\ninternal State and to try to control our\nmind you know as humans we think that\nthe things that we think are us we tend\nto identify with our mind we tend to\nidentify with our thoughts until we get\nto a point hopefully you can get to this\npoint or you already at this point where\nyou realize you're not your thoughts\nyou're the Observer of those thoughts\nyou're like the Silent Witness behind\nthose thoughts you are in in other terms\nyou are the Consciousness behind the\nmind the mind is programmed there's\ncertain things I don't know if you've\never done it before where your mind will\nautomatically say something in your head\nand you're like where the hell did that\njust come from that's not who I want to\nbe that's not who I am that was just a\nprogramming that was a conditioning that\njust came out and I'll give you an\nexample if it's not connecting with you\nor you're like hold on how am I not my\nmind okay think about this for a second\nhow am I the Consciousness behind my\nmind that doesn't make any sense that\nsounds too woo wooy right I don't want\nyou to move your lips I don't want you\nto say a word but in your head I want\nyou to say the word happiness okay don't\nsay it out loud just say it in your head\nwe're all going to say it together in\nour mind on the count of three 1 2\n3 did you say it I'll give you one more\nchance ready say happiness without\nsaying it outside outside of your mouth\nin your head I want you to say happiness\none 2\n3 do you do it okay now my question is\nwho said\nthat who said that because you you said\nsomething without moving your lips and\nthen the crazier part about it is not\nonly did you say it without moving your\nlips you also heard it you heard it\nwithout a sound so who said it in who\nheard it you said something without\nsaying it and you heard something\nwithout hearing it you are the\nConsciousness behind all of it that's\nwho you are you know when you ask\nsomebody one of the things I love to ask\npeople is who are you and I talk to\npeople and they're like oh well I'm a\nmother I'm a wife uh my name is Stacy\nI'm 37 years old I went to University of\nSouth Florida I have a degree in in\nscience and uh this is my religion and\nthis is my job and they start naming off\nall of these things they're she is not\nany of those things those are just\naccomplishments that's an age that's a\nname that she was given at Birth but\nlike when you were were born were you a\nwife were you a mother did you have\ndegrees any of those things so those\nthings don't make you who you are\nthey're just things that you've\nexperienced things that you've done\nlabels that you've Picken up across the\nway you know just as the bird is not\nlike a creature of the lake you are more\nthan all of your programmingsoftware\nwe put ourselves in a box based off of\neverything that's ever happened to us\nand we think that's just who I am that's\nwho I'm always going to be and as a\nresult we put ourselves in a box we\ndon't think that we can get outside the\nbox we become a victim of our own minds\nrather than the Consciousness and the\npower that's behind all of it and so\nfirst thing I want you to understand\ntoday as we start to dive into your\nthoughts is that you are not your\nthoughts just as the same as the bird is\nnot the water he can fly away at any\ntime but he's been on the water for so\nlong for years for 10 years for 20 years\nthat he thinks that he is the water and\nforgets he can fly away you've been\nidentifying with your mind and with your\nthoughts for so long that you forget\nthat you are not them it's just a piece\nof you the same way that if I look at my\nhand I'm like I'm not like I am my hand\nno my hand is just a part of me same way\nthat my mind is a part of me but it is\nnot all of me so anytime you get caught\nup in your mind you need to remind\nyourself first off that you're free from\nit just like the bird you know if you\nlook at the bird you start to\ndeconstruct the whole story The Bird's\nflying in the air it lands on a lake it\nhangs out for a really long time it\nforgets that it can fly and so it starts\nto identify with the lake the bird\nforgets it can fly it's been programmed\nout of it the same way that we have all\nbeen programmed out of who we are now\nthe water that this bird lands on is the\nsame as your mind you can rest on your\nmind like the water and when the water\nis calm just like the bird we're like\nthis is awesome I feel great but when\nthe water gets choppy when your mind\ngets choppy you start to get stressed\nyou start to get anxious you start to\nstart to freak out about something you\nget angry you get sad you're like oh my\nGod this is insane I don't want to be\nthis way and you struggle same way that\nthe bird starts to struggle and almost\ndrowns the bird wants to keep the water\ncalm tries to find every way it can keep\nthe water calm but it can't control the\nwater it thinks it can but it can't same\nway that we want to have control over\nour mind and so whenever our mind is\nanxious we're like no don't be anxious\ndon't be anxious don't don't feel like\nthat don't be angry and so we actually\nstart to battle with our mind that\ndoesn't make any sense we have to let\nour mind do what it's going to do it's\nlike the a storm coming in and the bird\nbattles with the water it's not going to\nstop the storm what can the bird do it\ncan just kind of hunger down and wait\nfor it to\npass so you forgot that you were the\nConsciousness behind the mind and maybe\nyou've never even been told that you're\nthe Consciousness behind the mind the\nsame way that the bird forgot they could\nfly you the thing behind behind the\nthoughts behind the programming behind\nthe personality behind what your parents\ntold you behind Society behind all of\nthe that we're given across our\nlife right we're behind all of that\nthing and when we fight when we feel\nanxiety or stress or any of that\nfighting it only makes it worse what you\nresist persists and life is up and down\nit's all over there's some days that are\nreally good and it's calm there's some\ndays that are kind of a show\nright and when you're looking at it that\nway and you're trying to make it not be\na show you're like I really just\nwant it to be calm again and you get\neven more anxious because you're wanting\nit to be what it's not currently at this\nmoment waves come in you're like oh\nI hate this right what can I do about\nthis why does this always happen to me\nso I want you to understand that that\nthat the whole metaphor behind this\nthing is for you to start to understand\nthat you can distance yourself from the\nMind from the thoughts from the thing\nthat you have identified and thought\nthat you are when you are extremely\nstressed and you extremely anxious those\nare just thoughts that are going on in\nyour head can you take a step back and\nsay okay I'm noticing my anxiety I'm\nnoticing can I let this pass I was on a\ncall yesterday and one of the ladies\nsaid hey when I notice that I'm anxious\nI I I just want it to go away how do I\nmake it go away and I said you don't\nmake it go away what you do is you let\nyourself process it so the same way that\nthe bird can't stop the storm can't stop\nthe waves coming in it just has to let\nit pass the problem is that when we have\nanxiety or stress any of those things\nand we fight it it makes it harder and\nit it it adds in another layer of an\nanother problem because now it's I'm\nanxious and on top of that I don't want\nto be anxious now I have two things that\nI'm battling and so when you start to\nthink about it you just have to\nsometimes take a step back and you have\nto say okay hold on I'm just going to\nlet this pass like there's a lot of\ntimes and it's not as much anymore but a\ncouple years ago I used to wake up and I\nused to feel anxious a lot I would just\nwake up because you know there's a lot\nof stuff going on there's this freaking\nbig business that I'm running I have\nemployees I have Revenue that has to\ncome in I have all this stuff that goes\nout I have to like there was just so\nmany things and I would feel anxious\nfrom like the moment I woke up and I\nwould hate it and I would fight it and I\nwould try to do rituals and I would try\nto do like everything that I possibly\ncould to calm it down now I just go okay\nlet me be aware let me be aware the the\nConsciousness behind this thing Rob is\nexperiencing a little bit of anxiety\nright now he just just needs to take a\nbreak he just needs to sit down and he\nneeds to let this pass and what I would\ndo is I would give myself 5 minutes just\nto let myself feel it and I would just\ngive myself five minutes just let Rob\nfeel it for a little while and I'd sit\nthere and I would feel it and then what\nI would do is I would then after a\nlittle while it would it would because I\nwasn't fighting it it would start to\nkind of go away it was like my body\nneeded to process it and then let it go\nand it's like it was just like a passing\nCloud it was just a passing Cloud that\nwas just going back just a little\nrainstorm that was going by on a CL on\non a sunny day and so I was just okay\nlet me just wait till this Cloud passes\nnow when we resist and we fight the\nanxiety or the stress it tends to make\nall of those things worse but when we're\nlike okay I'm going to give myself five\nminutes I'm going to breathe\nintentionally I'm going to sit there and\nI'm going to feel I'm going say okay\njust I'm just going to let it go and\ninstead of resisting I'm letting it go\ninstead of resisting I'm letting it go\nwhat happens is is is after a while it\nstarts to get a little bit better and\nthen I'm like you know what I'm I'm just\ngoing to put down on a piece of paper\nwhat I'm anxious about and see if I can\nmake a plan that will make me feel\nbetter I'm anxious about this thing I\nhave to do today okay what would make me\nfeel better what else would make me feel\nbetter what if I did some breathing what\nif I just breathe for a little while and\ntry to get my nervous system to calm\nback down cuz my nervous system is at a\nheightened State and what you start to\nrealize after a while is that the same\nway that the natural state of the lake\nfor the bird when it's a sunny day is\ncalm the same thing is with the mind the\nnatural state of your mind is calm\nnow you might be sitting there going\nthere's no freaking way CU my mind is\ncrazy it's insane it's all over the\nplace but I promise you this the natural\nstate of your mind is calm you know when\nyou look at a baby a newborn baby even\nthough they cry when they want milk and\nall that stuff when their eyes are open\nand they're they're sitting there then\ntheir natural state is calm that is all\nof our natural States but we've been\nprogrammed to think that we have to do\nthis thing or we've got to go to the\nnext thing or we need to succeed or we\nneed to do this next the secret to the\nmind is not trying to control it it's to\nstop resisting it and to stop fighting\nit and to let it do what it's going to\ndo and eventually it will calm down it\nmight take five minutes might take 10\nminutes but eventually it will start to\ncalm down the more that you fight it the\nharder it gets and the longer it\npersists you know like Alan Watts has\nthis quote that he says he says you\ncan't force your mind to be silent right\nlike think about that for a second you\ncan't force your mind to be silent that\nwould be like trying to smooth ripples\nin water with a flat iron water water\nbecomes clear and calms down only when\nit's left\nalone same as your brain it becomes\nclear and calms down only when it's left\nalone not when you're trying to fight it\ntrying to make it better trying to make\nit be different and really what it comes\ndown to and this is really really hard\nfor a lot of people to grasp and it was\nhard for me to grasp for a long time as\nwell is it comes down to surrendering\nit's not about controlling it's about\nallowing you know we always think okay I\nneed the next steps I need to okay I\nfeel anxious what is my step by\nstep-by-step process to not feel this\nway I am pissed what is my step by- step\nbyep process to not feel this way\nsometimes you just got to surrender to\nit not try to control it it's about\nallowing it's about not forcing it not\nresisting it because when you resist I\nkeep saying it you resist to persists\nthe less you try to control and fight\nthe mind the more it starts to calm\nitself down it's kind of like a child\nthrowing a temper tantrum sometimes the\nnatural state of your mind is calm and\nso then you start to think about it and\nmaybe you understand this and that's\ngreat to hear now I start to think about\nwhat can I do to help my mind be in more\nof a state of calm right I can't control\nit when I'm in it but is there is it\npossible for me to create more calm or\nhave a\nuh an environment that's more uh\nconducive for a calm mind right so like\nif I'm the type of person who's never\nmeditated and I notice that I'm really\nan I throughout the day maybe I'm going\nto try to start a meditation practice\nmaybe I'm going to learn meditation you\nknow people always think that they're\ndoing it wrong with meditating and they\nwould think like I can't get to a point\nwhere I'm not thinking meditation is not\nno thoughts meditation is just watching\nyour thoughts it is once again\ndistancing yourself from your thoughts\nseeing that you are not your thoughts\nand not getting caught up with them so\nit's not a state of no thought it's a\nstate of watching your thoughts and\nbecoming aware and distancing yourself\nfrom them right the mind can get Crazy\nLife can get crazy but can we distance\noursel from it just kind of get a little\nbit more awareness so we could do some\nmeditation and and try to create more of\na calm environment we can do some\nbreathing and breath work I talk about\nit all the time in this podcast and\nbreath workk can start to help you\ncreate a little bit more of a calm\nenvironment within you can I look at my\nexternal environment and say like man\nlike some people get really stressed out\nunconsciously when their house is a\nmess some people don't care but maybe\ncould say can I create an environment\nthat is a little bit more calm for\nmyself instead of waking up and\nimmediately listening to slip knot maybe\nwhat I could do is get up and I can\nlisten to something that's more calming\nthe music that we listen to the\nenvironment that we're in creates the\nfeeling that we're going to have as well\nmaybe there's other people in your\nenvironment that stress you out and make\nyou anxious can you distance yourself\nfrom them maybe there's people who make\nyou more calm make you more grounded\nmake you more centered and not so\nflighty can you find more more time\naround those people and so we can't\nreally control our mind but we can try\nto assist our mind in being a little bit\nmore calm because the mind can get Crazy\nLife can get crazy it can be more waves\nit can be hurricane level W waves\nsometimes can\nit but what's the best thing to do if a\nHurricane's going over your\nhouse what's the best thing well if you\ncan leave before it gets there of course\nbut if the Hurricanes go over your house\nand you can't leave what do you do you\nhunker down you stay inside you don't go\noutside and try to calm the hurricane\ndown no you just have to allow the\nhurricane to pass it's the same thing\nwith your emotions it's it's about\nfeeling them it's about allowing them to\nexpresss because when you stop fighting\nthem when you stop resisting them they\ndon't stay as\nlong and when they don't stay as long\neventually you start to build up this\nmuscle and it's really odd I've noticed\nWithin Myself I've noticed within a lot\nof people that I've coached is they just\nas you start to work with your mind and\nunderstand your mind and understand how\nit works and and not identify with it\nthere's just another level of peace that\nstarts to come in and I have in no way\nMaster this thing please don't ever\nthink I don't know if I'll ever Master\nthis thing but what I've noticed is as I\nstart to distance myself from my\nthoughts not identify with them and when\nthey do come up and I am stressed or\nanxious or mad or whatever I say okay\nI'm stressed okay I'm anxious okay I'm\nmad I'm G to allow myself to feel this\nway for five minutes and then I'm going\nto go and I'm just going to go about my\nday when I don't resist them usually\nthey end up kind of workings out and I\nfind myself naturally in a state of calm\nwhich is the bird on the lake in\npeaceful Tranquil Waters which is\nultimately what we're all trying to feel\nbut when the waves do come in because\nthe waves are always going to come in at\nsome point in time they might not come\nin as much don't identify with them let\nthem come through let them work through\ndon't identify and think that you are\nthose waves you are those bad thoughts I\nam a bad person don't identify with them\ntake a step back and just allow it to\npass so that's
