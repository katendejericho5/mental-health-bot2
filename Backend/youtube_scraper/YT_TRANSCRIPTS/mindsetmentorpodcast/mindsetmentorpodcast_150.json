    "transcript": "one of the most important things\nthroughout my day is my energy and I\nnoticed that at different points in the\nday I have a lot more energy and at\ndifferent points in the day I have a lot\nless energy and so really what it comes\ndown to is knowing when your energy is\nat its highest knowing when your energy\nis at its lowest and then working from\nthere and so for me like I know how my\nenergy works after years of going\nthrough this and I plan my entire day\nbased off of how I know I'm going to\nfeel majority of the time in those hours\nand so I plan my day based off of where\nI know my energy typically is because\nI've been following myself and my energy\nfor years now and I plan my entire day\nbased off of that"
