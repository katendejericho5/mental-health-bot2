    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto give you a secret to improve\nexponentially in a very short period of\ntime especially compared to the rest of\nthe world let's dive in today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to quickly\nget ahead of everybody else that's out\nthere in society I'm going to teach you\nhow to get light years ahead of people\nin a very very short period of time and\nI like to watch people and watch what's\nhappening in society and watch what\nhappens when things are happening and\nwhen something good happens bad happens\nlike I'm just so interested in humans\nand so I study humans a lot and I try to\npay attention to them and when when you\nlook out into the world what do you like\nwhat do you notice because one of the\nthings that I really am noticing I'm\nnoticing a lot of things but one thing\nthat's that's becoming extremely obvious\nfor me is that humans are becoming more\nand more addicted to technology and I\ndon't mean technology and like a good\nway like they're using it for business\nthey're using it for them to be able to\ncreate amazing things I mean that\nthey're more addicted to their phones\nthey're more addicted to watching their\nTV they're more addicted to playing\nvideo games all of that and if you can\nnotice this and you can find where you\nfit in the world and you find whatever\nindustry that you want to get into you\ncan dominate basically any industry and\nyou can get ahead of your competition\nand I don't like to view the entire\nworld as competition that's not really\nwhat I prefer but if you run a business\nif you own a business you do have\ncompetition if you are a salesperson\nthat's selling a product you you do have\ncompetition and when you see what\neverybody else is doing I like to look\nat what everyone else is doing most of\nthe time and do the exact opposite the\nreason why is because that means that\nyou're going to be an outlier in some\nsort of way like I remember when this\npodcast when I first started this\npodcast in 2015 most podcasts at that\npoint in time were an hourong interview\nepisodes once a week and I was like I'm\ngoing to be completely different I'm\ngoing to make 15-minute episodes three\nto four times a week and when you see\nthat I just decided to go a different\nway well I guess the podcast decided\nbecause of that stood out in some sort\nof way and so what I like to do is look\nat what everyone else is doing and do\nsomething different when you look at the\naverage person they spend 3.2 hours a\nday watching Netflix or some form of\nsomething on their TV they spend 4.1\nhours per day on their phone they spent\ntwo and a half hours on social media two\nand a half hours on social media that's\nover 15 hours of their life over the\nnext week is going to be doing that\nand human attention man has gone down\n33% in the past 20 years so if you want\nto become a superh human do the exact\nopposite of what everybody else is doing\nand this is the key part of today is to\ntrade your entertainment for education\nand action trade being entertained for\neducation and action when most people\nare looking at cat videos and trying to\nwatch people you know chug an entire\nSprite on Tik Tok you are Bec becoming\nsmarter you're reading a book that can\nfurther your knowledge so that a year 5\nyears 10 years from now you are light\nyears past everybody else in society you\nare taking action in your business while\nyour competition is trying to be\nentertained by other people making funny\nvideos so you have to take a step back\nand just watch like just just I don't\nknow if you've noticed like I I always\nwatch people but just watch when people\nare walking down the street they're\nalmost always on their phone they're\nalways just right here looking at this\nthing that's right in front of their\nface they're so addicted to it if you\ncan step back from what everybody else\nis doing you will be a different form of\nhuman in 10 years than everybody else\nthat's been so addicted to this phone\nand looking at it what I'm seeing people\nare doing is they're trying to do the\nopposite they're trying to just hang out\nthey're trying to watch TV they're\ntrying to not do a whole lot and now you\nknow it's I just want to be honest with\nyou as I'm saying this too it's not like\nit's not like I I never turn on my TV\nand it's not like I don't have a cell\nphone and I don't have social media and\nI use a landline I I use all of them but\nI try to be way more intentional of how\nI'm using them and why I'm using them so\ninstead of letting myself fall into my\nphone or fall into my TV or fall into\nsocial media I'm trying to intentionally\nuse it how I need to use it right so for\nme like I I can sit on my phone at when\nI'm winning at a doctor's office and I\ncould be on social media but actually\nwhat I do is I have over the past you\nknow let's see seven eight years now I\nswitched over over to Kindle mostly and\nso in Kindle you can highlight aspects\nof books and you can highlight the parts\nthat you like the most then you can go\nback and I can see books that I read\nfive years ago that I thought were\nreally good and when I have 15 20\nminutes at the doctor's office instead\nof scrolling on Instagram and looking at\na bunch of what I do is I go to\nKindle and I read all of my notes of the\nthings that I thought were best from\nbooks that I read so I'm basically\nrereading books that I read years ago so\nI'm trying to continue to see if there's\na way to get myself to be smarter to\nlearn more to grow more to be better\ninstead of just falling back into just\nbeing reactive and just scrolling\nscrolling scrolling right I've decided\nto try to remove myself from all that\nI've also tried to be decided to stop\nbeing more of a a Creator or start to\nstart being more of a Creator on social\nmedia versus so much of just a consumer\nof it instead of me consuming on social\nmedia the only thing that I use social\nmedia for now is for creating and\nputting stuff out there I know that\nbeing on my phone and being on social\nmedia all of that stuff makes me less\nfocused and it makes me more distracted\nin fact I've noticed that when I look at\nmy phone in the morning it makes me feel\nmore anxious throughout the day so I'm\ntrying to distance myself from that damn\nthing and so I'm consciously removing\nmyself from all of these things if I\nspend 4.1 hours a day on my phone and I\nlive for another 50 years that's 8.3\nyears of my life looking at my\nphone what a freaking waste staring at a\nscreen doing nothing with myself and so\nrecently what I've been trying to do is\ntry to distance myself as much as I\npossibly can I've told you guys over and\nover again this podcast when I'm at home\nwhen I'm getting work done I put my pH\nphone in a drawer in the kitchen it's\nabout 40t away and so when it's not\naround I don't tend to think about it as\nmuch when it's off to the side and it's\nwith an Arms Reach it's an eyesight I\nfeel my attention being pulled towards I\nfeel myself wanting to check that thing\nI am not immune to the addiction of the\nphone but what I'm trying to do is I'm\ntrying to remove remove myself from that\nand so you know I check my phone when I\nneed to I go into the kitchen and I\ncheck my phone and then I put it back\ninside of the kitchen drawer and you\nknow I'll go back and check it in an\nhour or two and so I've gotten my phone\ndown phone time down to around two hours\nper day on my phone just because of the\nfact that I do this and I run my entire\nbusiness from my phone you know we have\n30 people in the company over 30 people\nin the company and more than 75% of them\ndon't live in Austin which is where I\nlive and so I have to use it I have to\nuse it as much as I can to be able to\nyou know be in contact with them do what\nI need to do sometimes instead of using\nslack on my phone I use slack on my\ncomputer and so I'm always just\nconstantly thinking in my mind how can I\ntake action that move the needle just a\nlittle bit more in my life instead of\njust being entertained so when I when I\nsay this like what about for your own\nlife how can you take action that really\nmoves the needle in your life whatever\nthat means whether that's your health\nyour wealth your Fitness your\nrelationships all of those things versus\nversus just sitting around and being\nentertained imagine if you fast\nforwarded you're 90 years old and you're\non your deathbed do you really think\nyou're going to be like I'm so glad that\nI spent so much time on my\nphone no I I'm so glad I watched so many\nfunny videos while I was just sitting\naround and all of my life was just\nsitting there waiting for me I'm so glad\nI was looking at videos while my\nchildren were you know two years old\nplaying and I just didn't pay attention\nto them because I was too busy on my\nphone now I'm not saying never be\nentertained but I'm just saying can you\njust lower it a little bit can you\nremove yourself can you consciously just\nremove yourself a little bit more like\nsure I'm sure the cat videos that you\nwatch are hilarious they're definitely\nentertaining but you know it's probably\nway better than a cat video is watching\nthe sunset in grease because you did\ntake action in the past and created the\nlife that you want so it's like do you\nwant to watch cat videos or do you want\nto have a glass of wine while you're in\nGreece watching the sunset that's a\npretty easy decision isn't it the only\ndifference is the cat videos requires no\naction it requires no movement and there\nis no resistance to do it working really\nhard to be able to afford to go to\ngrease and to be able to enjoy yourself\nrequires action it requires intention it\nrequires hard work and most people are\nnot willing to put in the work they want\nto take the easy route that's just\nnatural for us to do as humans and so if\nyou really want to change your life if\nyou really want to distance yourself\nfrom every everybody else it's out there\nyou will become more and more superhuman\nin the coming years if you stop doing\nwhat everybody else is doing if you\ndecide to remove yourself from the video\ngames if you decide to remove yourself\nfrom watching TV all the time if you\ndecide to remove yourself from being on\nsocial media all day if you decide to\nstart reading a book instead if you\ndecide to start spending some time with\nyour loved ones instead spending some\ntime going on a run and getting your\nyour Fitness better people are all\ntalking about like you know the the\ngoggles that you can wear and jumping\ninto the metaverse and all of that I'm\nI'm just going to be honest with you and\nthere's there's no judgment for me I'm\njust not personally taking a part of it\nI don't I just do not give a to be\nhonest with you right it's like the\nuniverse that I currently live in I like\nI don't need a metaverse I love the\nUniverse I currently live in you know\nI'd rather travel to an amazing place\nthan visit it on my couch with some\ngoggles on you I'd rather eat pasta in\nItaly versus you know play Virtual with\nsomeone that lives in a different\ncountry you know so it's like I see the\nthe way that it looks at humans are\nprogressing and I'm starting to go like\nI like to to fast forward myself into\nthe future as much as I possibly can and\nsay like if this continues going where\nare we going to be if this continues to\nhappen where are we going to be and then\nI'm thinking to myself is that what I\nwant like do you really want to spend\nlike I said if you fast forward to end\nof your life would you really be proud\nof the life that you buil bu if you\nspent the majority of your time watching\nNetflix is that really like fully a life\nlived is that fully a life enjoyed are\nyou were you fully present with your\nchildren were you fully present with\nyour loved ones I promise you this it's\nyou you won't feel like it's fully\nfulfilled at that point in time if you\nspend the majority of your time doing\nthat you know I'm I'm just looking at\nwhere the world is going and I'm going I\njust really don't want to be there I\ndon't want to put goggles on and pretend\nlike I'm hanging out with somebody when\nI could literally just hang out with\nsomebody I don't want to look at\npictures of something and move my head\naround to see it I'd rather hopefully go\nsee it\nmyself I don't care to scroll on social\nmedia I care to try to make myself just\na little bit better every single day and\nso you know you can see where the world\nis going you can start to fast forward\nyour brain like what is becoming of it\nand can I start to plan ahead now so\nthat I can I can get to work and and\ndistance myself from the pack and stand\nout in some sort of way and I'm not\nresisting and saying oh back in my day\nI'm just watching what's becoming and\nwhat's coming in the future and I'm just\ntrying to plan ahead to see where I\ncould make myself stand out a little bit\nmore where I can make myself a little\nbit more outstanding versus just\nfollowing what everyone else is doing\nand if you're listen to this podcast\nyou're not the type of person who wants\nto be the same as everybody else you\nwant to be different majority of people\ndon't listen to podcasts like this they\nlisten to entertaining podcasts and they\nlisten to comedy podcasts which are\ngreat and murder podcasts which I've\nnever listened to one but you're here\nbecause you're there's a part of you\nit's like I want to learn I want to grow\nI want to get better because I know if I\nlearn and I grow I can improve my life I\ncan improve my family's life I can\nimprove the world in some sort of way\nnone of us are improving the world if\nwe're constantly scrolling on our phone\nnone of us is are improving our family's\nlife if we're just constantly watching\nNetflix the only way for us for us to do\nit is for us to consciously step up and\nsay what do I want my life to be look\naround you and say is this something\nthat I want to take part in if you do do\nit if you don't then do something\ndifferent and once again I'm not trying\nto tell you and I I don't want this\nepisode to seem like I'm trying to tell\nyou not to entertain yourself not to\nhave fun and to be some weirdo that just\nworks and reads and works out all day\nlong that's not what I'm saying in any\nsort of way sure watch some TV I don't\ncare sure scroll on some social media I\ndon't care but spend the majority of\nyour free time instead of being in front\nof a screen trying to improve yourself\nin some sort of way you know having some\nsort of Coach to help you get better at\nsomething if you want to get better at a\nsport or get better physic physically in\nyour Fitness read a little bit more try\nto journal a little bit more try to\nmeditate a little bit more work on your\nown personal self because if you work on\nyourself the world become a better place\nyou will enjoy it more and you will help\nyourself you will help your children\nyou'll help your spouse you'll help the\nworld around you become better as well\nultimately if everybody did that I think\nthe world will probably be a better\nplace so where is the world going I\ndon't know not really sure I got an idea\nof where it's going I could be right I\ncould be wrong ultimately though I know\nwhere I'm I'm going and that's the most\nimportant thing and so for you to figure\nout what you're going and how you're\ngoing to get there and what you're going\nto need to do and not do to get there is\nextremely extremely important and so\nhopefully you will trade your\nentertainment for education at least a\nfew extra times this week and if you do\nthat that's how you will set yourself\napart so that's what I got for
