    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today is a\nfullon master class on habit formation\nand destroying habits that you want to\nget rid of let's dive in did you know\nthat about half of what you do is a\nhabit so there's a study that was done\nat Duke University that found that\napproximately\n40% of our daily actions are driven by\nhabits instead of new decisions there\nwas also another study that was done at\nHarvard that founded about uh\n48% of what it is that we do our habits\nand when we are just doing this you have\nto think about that's nearly half for\nthose two right which means that we are\nunconsciously doing about 50% of what we\ndo throughout the day we're not even\nconsciously paying attention to it's\njust habits of stuff that we've been\ndoing for so long some of them are good\nsome of them are bad some of them are\njust whatever you don't you don't really\nneed to put a label on it but when you\nlook at a habit what is a habit exactly\nthey are basically automatic routines\nthat control all of our daily actions in\nsome way and it could be the the Act of\njust brushing your teeth something that\nyou've done thousands of times or it can\nbe a really complex cognitive process\nlike how we react to somebody that looks\nlike someone that we used to know and we\nreact to them based off of past traumas\nthat have happened to us and so when you\nlook at it the first thing I always ask\nmyself is why right so I ask myself that\nabout myself all the time why am I this\nway why do I do this why do I act this\nway why did I do that but when I look at\nthis and I look at habits the first\nquestion I have for myself is why does\nour brain make a habit like what's the\nactual point because our brain and our\nbody are not going to do something\nthat's not efficient and good for us to\ndo so when you look at it critical\nthinking and actually having to use your\nbrain to think okay I'm going to get\ndone here I'm going to walk down the\nstairs okay I'm going to take my key out\nof my pocket I'm going to get in my car\nI'm going to drive I'm going to turn\nleft here and you're actually doing all\nof the critical thinking um it is the uh\none of the most energy assuming things\nthat your body does your brain only\naccounts for about 20% of your or 2% of\nyour body weight but 20% of your energy\nis used by your brain a day which is why\nyou can have a day where you're just\nsitting around you're working and your\nbody rarely even\nmoves so the physical body doesn't do a\nwhole lot but you did a whole lot of\nmental work and then you're exhausted at\nthe end of the day right so habits help\nreduce all of the cognitive load of just\nthe everyday tasks that we have which\nthen help us you know focus on other\nthings and so when you look at it habits\nare extremely important to our lives and\na lot of us have built really good\nhabits over our lives and all of us have\nbuilt really bad habits in our lives as\nwell and it's about the the act of\ntaking a step back and saying okay is\nthis one that I want to keep or is this\none that I want to change and with\nhabits they help us carry out tasks with\nnot a whole lot of mental effort which\nthen free up other cognitive resources\nto do more complex things or to do new\nthings and so it's good but it's also\nbad it's it's a double-edged sword on\none hand it's it's really important for\nour mental efficiency but on the other\nhand it can lock us into patterns and\nbehaviors um that can make it really\nhard for us to change especially when\nthose habits are unhealthy and we really\nwant to change them but we're kind it's\nkind of ingrained into us we need to\nkind of rip them up at the roots and so\nwhen you understand the science of of\nhabit formation um it's it isn't just\nabout knowing why we do what we do but\nit's also about it's about that and why\nwe do it but it's about understanding it\nand understanding it enough to then make\npositive change in our lives to put in\nthe right habits and get rid of the bad\nhabits so then we start to think about\nhow exactly are habits formed and how\ncan we use habit formation to build\nlasting habits and get rid of all the\nbad habits right and so habits are like\nI said they're they're they're basically\nbehaviors that we perform with little or\nno conscious thought and according to to\nscience they are the product of a\nthree-step process and it's called it's\ncalled a habit Loop and the first guy to\nfind this was a a um Professor named Dr\nCharles doig he wrote a book called The\nPower of\nhabits even though I love the book\nAtomic habits it's it's kind of a ripoff\nfrom The Power of Habit they add an\nextra step to Charles doig's original\none and then he wrote an entire book\naround it both are great books but\nCharles doig is the OG in this and so\nbasically this is how it works okay\nthere is a QE and the Q is the trigger\nthat initiates the habit and it can be\nan external en environmental cue but it\ncan also in and what I mean like\nexternal CU it could mean like the\nlocation it that you are it could be a\nnotification on your phone um it could\nbe someone else walking in those are all\nexternal cues but it could also be an\ninternal cue like a specific time of day\nor when you start to a specific\nemotional state when you start to Fe\nfeel a certain way right it could be\nsomebody says something to you and it\nchanges the way that you feel and now\nthat's the internal cue for you and so\nwhen you look at like for instance\npeople that are addicted to cigarettes\nthey're they're addicted to cigarettes\nof course for the nicotine but nicotine\nyou only stay addicted to for a 100\nhours so you're looking at basically\nfour days that you can stay addicted to\nnicotine and that it's in your system\nand so most people are addicted to\nnicotine but what they're actually\nreally addicted to more than anything\nelse is the cue of the thing that\nhappens that makes them want a cigarette\nand so they could for instance wake up\nand have a cigarette first thing in the\nmorning for the past 10 years while\nthey're reading the paper\nand they're so used to that that as soon\nas they wake up in the morning that's\nthe first thing that that's the cue and\nthen they have to go into the routine\nthey want to go into the routine most\npeople this is how it works with coffee\nright we wake up go to the bathroom have\nwater and then immediately want coffee\nbecause we've been doing it for 10 or 15\nyears maybe longer and so for me my\ncousin has been addicted to cigarettes\nfor a really long time and it's really\nhard for him to break the habit of\nsmoking cigarettes cuz he's worked at\nthe same restaurant as a chef for 10\nyears and so he goes on his his\ncigarette break and he goes to the exact\nsame location which is an outdoor area\nin a a bench that they have out there\nand smokes a cigarette and so he's just\nused to it so it's yeah he does want to\nhave a break and have a cigarette but or\nto have a break period but then he goes\nto the same area and that environmental\nqueue being at work being at the exact\nsame location is actually what triggers\nhim wanting to have the next thing and\nwhich is the cigarette um you know a lot\nof people will drink and then they they\nhave a cigarette with a drink and that's\njust that's the QE example you know the\nthe example that I said earlier of of\ncoffee is probably everyone who drinks\ncoffee can't relate to that one you just\nfeel like you want in the morning that\nis the cue and so with with external\ncues there's way more external cues than\nyou realize and you're not even really\nconscious of you're being influenced by\nyour environment all of the time when\nyou sit down on the couch most people\nsitting down on the couch that is a cue\nto do what to watch TV and you're just\nused to doing it you just sit down on\nthe couch you turn on the TV you turn\noff your mind for a little bit now try\ntaking the TV off the wall and putting\nbooks on the uh on the coffee table and\nit's going to feel awkward the first few\ntimes you sit down and you don't turn\nthe TV on because you're in that habit\nLoop of the queue is right here and now\nyour environment is changed hopefully we\ncan get that environment change to\nchange the actual routine so that can be\nan external Quee an internal Quee can be\nlike you get stressed rest and you want\na glass of wine or you want a cigarette\nor you do work you do something to not\nfeel a stress and so these internal cues\ncan also influence the next thing which\nis the routine so the first thing is the\nque the next thing is the routine and\nthis is the behavior itself that we want\nto change and so it's whatever it is\nthat you do it could be the cigarette it\ncould be the glass of wine it could be\nthe coffee whatever it is for you uh it\ncould be you know getting anxious those\nare that's that's the routine that your\nbody naturally goes into and so that's\nthe thing that we're trying to change or\nif we wanted to be stronger we and we\nwant to develop a really good habits the\nthing that we want to reinforce it's\ntypically what we think of when we think\nof habits and the routine is basically\nthe Habit itself so it's Q routine and\nthen the last part of it is the reward\nevery single habit that you have has\nsome sort of reward to it whether you\nrealize it or not every habit does it\nmight not seem like it's a reward to you\nor a reward that you want but it has it\nso you know this is the positive\nreinforcement that follows the routine\nit's the reason why you keep doing the\nbehavior and eventually form a habit out\nof it and so the reward satisfies a\nparticular craving and makes our brains\nassociate the routine with something\nbeneficial so prompting us to repeat the\nBehavior Uh when the que is encountered\nand so that's how the Habit Loop happens\nit's the Q something internally or\nexternally triggers us to then want to\ngo to The Habit which is the um root\nroutine and then we get some sort of\nreward for it usually it's dopamine any\nof that type of stuff so I'll give you a\nfew examples and show you kind of how\nthis works right so a routine a cue\nexcuse me could be getting stressed out\nsomething happened at work so the\nstressed out and your you're at home and\nsomething happened at work and you're\nthinking about it while you're at home\nthat's the cue this feeling of stress\ninside of your body the routine for a\nlot of people is eating until they're\nuncomfortably full or having too much\nsugar and so there that's the routine\nand a lot of people don't realize\nthere's a lot of uh feelings and\nemotions that that eating can actually\ngive people uh when you digest digestion\nis the most energ energy consuming thing\nthat your body does it is the most\nenergyc consuming thing that your body\ndoes and so your body has to send a ton\nof energy to digesting that food that's\nwhy a lot of times you get tired after\nyou eat and if you have a lot of energy\ngoing to that food that's less energy\nthat's going to the brain which makes\nyou feel more relaxed so you're not\nconcentrating on the stress same way\nthat you know for some people it might\nbe food other people it might be a\ncouple of drinks you know you have it\ncould be the exact same thing right Q\nyou get stressed out at work routine you\ngo and have a couple glasses of wine\nwhen you get home the reward is that\nyour brain the when you have a drink it\nturns off the prefrontal cortex part of\nyour brain with is is the executive\nthinking and other parts of your brain\nas well which then just make you more\ncalm so the same way that drinking can\nmake somebody calm eating a lot can make\nsomebody calm because it requires so\nmuch energy from your body that it\nactually turns off some of the energy\ngoing to your brain so you can't keep\nthinking so much about all the stuff\nthat's stressing you out okay so that's\nan example of of a a QE routine reward\nuh another thing that that people do\nsometimes is nail biting and the cue for\nthem is feeling nervous or bored or\nanxious about something and because of\nthat what they started doing and they\nstarted learning this in childhood is\nthey bite their nails in the act of\nbiting their nails and focusing because\nit is such a a small and minuscule thing\nthat you have to do and the act of it is\nit's a distraction from uncomfortable\nemotions and so instead of actually\nfeeling and thinking about your emotions\nyou can go to biting your nails because\nof the fact that that's that's requiring\nyou to it's distracting you from the\nuncomfortable emotions so if you have\nchildren that breite their nails there's\nusually that them distracting themselves\nfrom uncomfortable emotions or thoughts\nor feelings and so those are those are\nkind of like bad ones and we've talked a\nlot about bad habits but you can also\nhave good habits as well like you can\nuse the Habit Loop for good habits as\nwell and so let's say that you want to\nstart having a daily exercise habit\nright so what you would do is you would\nyour queue could be coming home from\nwork and without fail if you just want\nto give yourself like 14 days in a row\nof just trying this and seeing if you\ncan get it to kind of Click when you\ncome\nhome immediately put your workout clo on\nand do a 30-minute workout go for a run\nwhatever it is so the Quee is coming\nhome from work the routine is uh\nchanging into workout clothes doing a\n30-minute workout the reward is the\nadrenaline's going through your body the\num the endorphins that are going through\nyour body the feeling of being\naccomplished being proud of yourself for\nshowing up instead of beating yourself\nup and saying oh my gosh you didn't work\nas hard as you could have it's like hey\nI'm proud of you and your body starts to\nrelease dopamine and when your body\nreleases dopamine your body wants more\ndopamine so it starts saying hey this\nthing that we just did before is really\ngood for us so this is something that we\ncontinue to keep focusing on so another\nthing that that could be good for you is\nuh healthy eating right so you get the\ncue of feeling hungry around lunchtime\nand normally you would run over and go\nto get fast food or you would get\nMcDonald's or something and instead of\ngoing and taking that route you decide\nthat you're going to get a chicken salad\nand so you get yourself a chicken\nsalad and you enjoy a tasty meal and you\nstart to feel good about yourself and\nyou tell yourself that you're proud now\nI wrote about this in my book level up\nwhere uh the actual celebration of\nyourself can be rewarding you don't have\nto have something do something it's can\nliterally just be like I'm closing your\neyes and saying I'm so proud of you for\nmaking the right decision so proudy for\nmaking the right decision and that will\nrelease dopamine and this is called the\ndopamine reward system that's what I\ntalk about it's my probably my favorite\nchapter in the book chapter 12 dopamine\nreward system and setting up your life\nbased off of dopamine reward systems\nbecause when you get dopamine you want\nto come back and do it again again so\nthen now you're starting to get more if\nthe word is correct addicted to enjoying\nand making a healthy choice and being\nproud of yourself for making the Healthy\nChoice than the bad choice of fast food\nlet's say that you want to start\nmeditating right the cue can be whenever\nyou start feeling stressed whenever you\nstart feeling anxious instead of eating\ninstead of drinking instead of smoking\ninstead of scrolling on social media all\nof those things to distract yourself in\nsome sort of way you're going to sit\nwith it the routine is sitting in in a\nquiet place and meditating for 15\nminutes and taking deep breaths in\nthrough the nose and out through the\nmouth and the reward is the way that you\nfeel after and so you feel really good\nyou feel calm you feel centered you feel\nmore at peace and in your head you're\ngoing that was a really good idea I want\nto keep doing that and so that's the\nQuee the routine the war that you can\nhave for for meditating and so this\nhabit Loop is is deeply deeply rooted\ninto human neurobiology and so when we\nencounter a q the interesting part about\nit when we encounter the queue our brain\nactually releases dopamine which is a\nneurotransmitter that triggers our\nreward system and then drives us to\nperform the habitual routine to achieve\nthe next reward whatever that reward is\nplus when we get that reward our brain\nreleases more dopamine and when we get\nthat into our we're we're basically\ndopamine fiends we all want dopamine we\nall get in different ways good ways bad\nways everything and so when we actually\nget the queue our brain releases a\nlittle bit of dopamine and dopamine is a\nchemical of motivation we we want to go\nand get the next bit of dopamine which\nwe know if we follow the routine we're\ngoing to get the reward and reward is\nalso going to be part of the dopamine\nsystem and so it's it's really really\ninteresting we start figuring out how\nthe human brain works and this process\nis is um facilitated by a part of the\nbrain that's called the basil ganglia\nwhich plays a central role in the\nformation of habits and each time we go\nthrough the Habit Loop the connection in\nour brain gets stronger making the Habit\nmore ingrained and automatic within us\nand so this it's known as something\ncalled he's law which you know basically\nsays that neurons that fire together\nwire together the more they fire\ntogether the more we do something over\nand over and over again this is why\nrepetition is the the uh the mother of\nall skill so the more that they fire\ntogether AKA sends an electrical signal\nfrom one place to another the stronger\nthe wiring actually becomes and this is\nwhy people who are older seem really set\nin their ways it's not that it's\nimpossible to change at any age because\nit's not impossible to change it's just\nthat they're more resistant and so it's\nreally uh interesting when you start to\nto dive in and start to think about it\nand when you look at this you go yeah\nit's really not that that difficult if\nI'm if I have some sort of habit that\nI'm trying to change what is my QE can I\nget rid of the queue if it's in my\nphysical environment can I get rid of\nthat queue so that I I'm not tempted as\nmuch if not maybe I can change it and\nstart to become aware of what is my cue\nwhat is my routine what is my reward\nthat I feel whenever I have a bad habit\nsee if you could change their queue see\nif you could change the routine all of\nthat become aware just become more aware\nof what's going on and then the second\nthing that you can do is if you're\ntrying to create new habits how can you\nstart a queue how can you make sure that\nyou have uh the routine and how can you\ncreate a reward system and like like I\nsaid you can actually go back to another\nepisode I make called do dopamine reward\nsystem uh where I explain it much more\nin depth but it really shows you that if\nyou want to be intelligent and uh\ndiligent and sit there and actually plan\nit out you can change the habits that\nyou don't want anymore and you can\ncreate the habits that are going to be\nmore beneficial for the future that\nyou're trying to create and so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories and tag me in\nat Rob dial Jr and also
