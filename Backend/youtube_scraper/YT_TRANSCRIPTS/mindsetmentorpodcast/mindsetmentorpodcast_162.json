    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode today I'm\ngoing to give you five tips to stop\nbeing so lazy let's dive in I used to be\nsomebody who was very lazy and in fact\nthere are definitely times where I am\nlazy uh but it's just doesn't go\nthroughout my entire day like after 6 o'\nI'm pretty damn lazy when it's during\nthe week so when I was younger though I\nwas a very lazy kid and uh didn't really\ndo anything or care to do anything\ndidn't want to go to work didn't want to\ndo any of that stuff and so I do think\nthat you can be lazy and also still\nsucceed and I do think that laziness is\nnot a trait that you have to have\nforever I think it's something that you\ncan be sometimes it's kind of like\nsomebody you could you know sometimes if\nyou're an introvert you can turn it on\nand be an extrovert for a party that you\ngo to and then turn it back off well\nyour laziness can be the exact same\nthing I believe and so if you're a lazy\nperson if you're a procrastinator if\nyou're a self- sabotager all of those\nthings this episode is for you because\nyou know I know that in order to get the\nlife you want it requires effort and if\nyou're being too lazy you're not putting\nthe effort in you're not going to get\nthe life that you want\nand so let's dive into those five\ndifferent things number one I want you\nto start being honest with yourself I\nwant you to just stop lying to yourself\nand I want you to admit to yourself I am\nlazy or I have been lazy and then tell\nyourself I'm not going to be lazy\nforever it's like a you know a 12-step\nprogram the first thing is you have to\njust admit you know you have to stop\nlying to yourself call it what it is\nonce you admit it once you become aware\nof it then you start to work to overcome\nit I personally have a different\nViewpoint than I think most people\npeople do I think that humans are just\ninherently lazy I think most people are\ninherently lazy I think there's some\npeople that I see that have so much\nenergy and I'm like I wish like if I had\nthat person's energy I feel like I'd be\n10 times further than I'm in life but I\njust ain't got it and I think that most\npeople don't have it are there some who\nare blessed with copious amounts of\nenergy sure am I one of them no are you\none of them I don't know probably not as\nwell I think the majority of people\ndon't have a ton of energy and I think\nthat most people are kind of lazy you\nknow if we were to like in here in in\nthe summer in Texas it gets so hot like\n107Â° for like 45 days in a row it is\ntorture to be outside and it is torture\nto be in the sun I think if we went back\na 100,000 years ago and we viewed it\nwhoever happened to be living in Austin\nTexas at that point in time I bet you\nthe majority of the day they're probably\nhanging out under\ntrees probably ours they probably W wed\nup woke up early in the morning they\nthey did their hunting they did their\ngather they did everything as the sun\nwas coming up and then around 1 2:00\nthey probably went and hung under some\ntrees waited for Sunset you they might\nhave taking some naps you know a midday\nnap as a a caveman or cavewoman and then\nthey would go out and do their thing as\na sun starting set as it was cooler\nagain and it is natural for us as humans\nto take the path of least resistance\nwhich when we're trying to build the\nlife that we want can seem lazy and so\nthe first thing I want you to do is just\nadmit to yourself that you are lazy\nsometimes and that's okay okay there's\nnothing wrong with it I don't want you\nto shame yourself I don't want you to\nguilt yourself cuz that's completely\nunnecessary I want you to say hey if I\nam lazy this is something that I want to\nwork at this is something I want to\nchange you know I can be lazy anytime\noutside of 9:00 a.m. to 5: p.m. if\nyou're trying to build a business if\nyou're trying to get something done and\nthen stop blaming anything that's\noutside of yourself everybody we like to\nblame the external what we have to do is\nwe have to look at it we have to take\nfull acceptance yes I am lazy but it's\nsomething that I'm going to change I'm\ngoing to change it and I'm going to\nallow myself to be lazy outside of my\nworking hours but during my working\nhours I'm going to be a machine I'm\ngoing to figure out how to get done\nwhatever it is I need to get done okay\nso that's the first thing just accept it\nbecome okay with it first therefore you\ndon't have that internal resistance like\nyou you tend to do all the time right\nnumber two is to take your goals and to\nmake them bite siiz one of the things\nthat I realized in in for years I would\ndo New Year's resolutions with people\nand we would do you know planning\nsessions and I would do a webinar and\nwe' do all the the the planning for the\nyear and I'd help people come up with\ntheir goals and then I realized as I\nstarted talking with different types of\npeople is that some people are motivated\nby that and then some people because\nit's a year away it feels far away it\nactually feels de more demotivating for\nthem and to sit down with somebody and\nthen say you know let's plan out the\nnext 10 years it could be extremely\ndemotivating them because their brain is\nmore process driven and they start\nthinking about all of the things that\nthey have to do over the next 10 years\nin order to get to wherever it is that\ntheir their goal is and then in their\nhead they start to get so overwhelmed\nbecause they think they need to get all\nof those things done over the next 10\nyears done today and then it becomes too\nmuch for them so if you're that type of\nperson and you're motiv more motivated\nby short-term goals then take your goals\nand make them shortterm you can make\nthem this week what do I need to do this\nweek to get further and then if you want\nto give even more shortterm you can go\nto today and then if you're really just\nan overthinker and you want to make it\neven more shortterm it could be what do\nI need to do in the next hour what do I\nneed to do next\nnext five minutes to get me closer and\nthen you just focus on those things and\nso I always give this example just\nbecause it makes very easy but you know\nif you if you are a sales rep and you\nwant to make $100,000 this year if\nyou've been a sales rep for a while you\nknow your numbers you know with this\namount of calls I get this many pickups\nand with this many pickups I get this\nmany people closed and with this many\ncloses I make this much money and so if\nyou come at it and say okay I want to\nmake $100,000 a year okay well how much\nis that per month okay that's just over\n$8,000 a month in order for me to make\n$8,000 a month in commissions how much\ndo I need to be bringing in how many how\nmuch sales do I need to be bringing in\nover the course of a a month let's say\nthat's 40 sales for you okay 40 sales\nand there's four weeks in this month so\nI need 10 sales a month which is\nbasically two sales a day can I get two\nsales a day well let's see if I do 50\ncalls I'll usually get about two sales\nokay so all I need to focus on every\nsingle day for the next year is just\ndoing 50 calls a day and now that's the\nonly thing that you focus on instead of\nfocusing on oh my gosh this goal seems\nso big it seems so far away and all you\ngot to do is just focus on the calls\nthat you need to do today and some days\nyou're going to get less than two sales\nand some days you're going to get more\nthan two sales but over the course of\nthe entire year you should average out\nto make about the $100,000 that you want\nto and so now you're focusing on a very\nsmall thing that you need to do every\nsingle day versus thinking about\neverything that you need to do every\nsingle day for the rest of the year you\nknow it's hard to focus on something\nthat's too far in the future and so it's\nbetter for us to to break it up into\nsmaller goals and so that will help you\nstop procrastinating it help you be a\nlittle bit less lazy Okay the third\nthing and this one's a fun one is to\nfind your why and the reason why I love\nthis is because I've got a new story uh\nand I always I always tell this story as\nwell because it's just it's it's it's so\nperfect and um you'll care you'll care\nabout your goals and you'll kind of\nmaybe get there but when you care about\nyour goals and you're sitting there and\nyou're like really invested in your\ngoals you're more likely to get there\nand uh the example I've given so many\ntimes and I'm going to tell you this\nstory and I'm going to tell you a new\nstory because it's funny how it relates\num I was used to give speeches and I\nwould be in rooms of people who you know\nmake $100,000 a year $200,000 a year and\nthey're pretty consistently been making\nthat amount for a while right and I\nwould sit in that in their rooms and i'\nwould say hey what's the chance of\neverybody you know what's the chance in\nyour room of you making a million\ndollars this year and everybody was like\n0% 1% 2% and I say what's the chance of\nyou making a million dollars this year\nand if if you don't there's a gun to\nyour head and everyone that you love is\ngoing to die including yourself and\neveryone let's say 100% 100% a th%\nthere's no way that I won't hit my\ngoals okay cool well did the T did the\ngoal change no did the time frame change\nno what changed what changed is the why\nbehind it it's 100% possible to hit that\nmillion dollars a year it's 100%\npossible for you to hit the goal that\nyou want to but you just don't have a\nstrong enough why behind it so the other\nday uh one of my uh team members called\nme and he's like hey you know how you\nalways tell that story about making a\nmillion dollars a year I was like yeah\nhe's like I got a crazy story to tell\nyou he's like so there's a guy that I\nwent to college with and one of my\nfriends called me up and he's like hey\ndo you remember uh Joseph and he's like\nyeah of course I remember Joseph he's\nlike I got a crazy story to tell you\nhe's like so Joseph is addicted to\ngambling and he got himself $40,000 in\ndebt with lone sharks and the lone\nsharks called him up a a couple months\nago and they said hey if you don't pay\nus the $40,000 by the end of this month\nwe're going to kill you and this it's\nlike real story now like this example\nthat I've been giving for years is like\na real Story in real life I'm talking to\nmy team member and I'm like so what\nhappened he's like so he literally\nworked all day every day for 30 days\nstraight and obviously he slept and all\nof that but he started getting creative\nand he started going to junkyards and\nwhen he went to the junkyards he would\nactually take off you know different\nbumpers that were made out of different\nmaterials that he knew could melt down\nand he ended up finding copper and\nfinding you know steel and finding all\nof these different things that he could\nand he started buying and reselling\nthings different parts that he would\nfind on cars because the guy was knew\nabout cars so he would find different\nparts he would go to different you know\nhe'd go and find a good part inside of a\ncar that was abandoned and then he would\ntake it to take it off take it to\nmechanic shop and he would sell it and\nso he got super creative and then just\nworked and because of the fact that he\nonly had 30 days and there was a\ntimeline he worked his ass off and he\nmade over\n$40,000 in that month and paid off his\ndebts the crazy part about it the guy\nhad never made in his entire life more\nthan $50,000 a year and he made\n$40,000 in a month why cuz his life\ndepended on it what would your actions\nlook like what would your days look like\nif your life depended on it think about\nthat for a second how would your be life\nbe different if you started going at\nyour success that you want the life that\nyou want as if your life depends on it\nand I was like man that's crazy I was\ntalk my team I was like that's crazy\nbecause if he were to just continue to\nwork like that he'd make\n$480,000 a year because if he made over\n$40,000 that month he's probably going\nto get better at it so he's probably\ngoing to hit like if he wanted to go for\na year at that pace maybe he has to you\nknow scale it back a tiny bit because\nmaybe he was going a little bit intense\ncuz he had a very short timetable but if\nyou want to scale it back a little bit\nhe might make 450 500 ,000 a year doing\nexactly what he did and so it's just a\ngreat example because I always give the\nmillion dollar example when I'm giving\nspeeches and this is a real life example\nof lone sharks who are going to kill\nthis guy if he didn't come up with the\nmoney and he worked his ass off and he\ncame up with it it's just like I don't I\ndon't have enough time to think about my\ninsecurities or to not care or to\nprocrastinate or to be too busy it's\njust I've got to get it done and I love\nthat cuz I think everybody and I don't\nlove the fact he got himself in that\npredicament but I love that everybody\nlistening has that opportunity to work\nthat hard to do it as they want to do if\nthey really truly want to okay so that's\nnumber three number four is to remove\nall of the distraction that you possibly\ncan I I wrote about this in my book\nlevel up and I I said that the people\nwho have the the the that are the most\nconsistent at taking action are not the\nones with the best willpower like people\nthink they have this amazing willpower\nit's that they've built an environment\naround them where their willpower is not\ntested and so you know when you're when\nyou're being lazy when you're\nprocrastinating when you're not doing\nwhat it is that you need to be doing\nyou're not just sitting there staring at\nthe ceiling you're doing something else\nyou're doing something that's why\nrecently I've not really said\nprocrastinating as much as I used to I\nI'm reframing procrastinating into uh\navoidant behavior is because when you're\nprocrastinating you're doing something\nand that something is to avoid whatever\nit is that you're trying to avoid so\nthat is an avoidant behavior and so\nyou're doing something the question is\nwhat are you doing in anything that is a\ndistraction to you needs to be removed\nso you know when I get really sit down\nto like get productive work done I like\nto call it deep work uh that comes from\nCal newport's book called Deep work my\nphone is my greatest distraction it is\nand I know that it is and so what I do\nis I I take my phone and I put it inside\nof my kitchen drawer and I leave it in\nthere when I'm really trying to do deep\nwork so that therefore I don't even have\nthat distraction around me um when you\nsit down at my computer I have no\nnotifications that pop up on my computer\nyou email me I don't see it if you slack\nme I don't see it if you text me I don't\nsee it so that therefore the only thing\nI can do is what's in front of me and\nthen when you start think about\ndistractions there's obviously\ntechnology there's obviously different\nother things people can be a really big\ndistraction if you work from home your\nchildren can be a really big distraction\nyou know so why don't you try to see if\nyour spouse say honey I need two work\ntwo hours of really deep work can you\nmake sure you take care of the kids for\nme um and don't let them come in the\nroom then if you work at an office put a\nsign on your door or put headphones on\nwhatever it might be uh if your kids are\nloud in the other room and they're\nthey're typically yelling and screaming\nput your headphones on get noise\ncancelling headphones turn on some music\nso you can't hear them and so what\nyou're trying to do is is create an\nenvironment whether it's an hour a day\nwhether it's two hours a day three hours\na day whatever it might be for you to\nfully get rid of all of your\ndistractions and the only thing that you\ncan do is the thing that you need to get\ndone and then you just give yourself I'm\ngonna work on it and I'm gonna work on\nthere are no other options I can't get\ndistracted and and what I would\nrecommend is completely clearing off\nyour desk so that the only thing that's\nup there is your computer maybe an\nexternal monitor headphones on your ears\nand then just get the work done and so\ntry to remove all of the distractions\nyou possibly can try to get anything\nthat that will lower your willpower out\nof the way so that the only thing you\ncan do is that and it's funny because\nyour brain will bounce around and wants\nto go do something else yesterday I was\ncreating a a PowerPoint for a speech\nthat I had to give and as I was creating\nit my brain did what brains to do it was\nlike oh my gosh there's this thing I\nforgot to do and I kid you not I\nliterally took off my headphones and I\nstarted walking to the door and then I\nwas like hold on I don't need to go get\nmy phone right now because that's going\nto distract me so I started walking back\nto my computer and I was like I could\njust do it real quick and so I started\nwalking back to the door and I was about\nto open the door I was like no no no no\nno you can always do that later just go\nback and don't break your distractions\ndo what you were doing don't get out of\nthe flow and I was like okay I'm not\ngoing to do that so I put my headphones\non so even I struggle with this where I\nwas like I was I was like I'm going to\ngo get my phone no I'm not going to get\nmy phone oh I'm going to get my phone no\nI'm not going to get my phone and so\nit's trying to remove as many\ndistractions as you possibly can now if\nmy phone was next to me I would have\njust picked it up and I would have been\nlost for the next 10 or 15 minutes and\nso how can you remove as many\ndistractions from your area from your\nlife as you possibly can and then the\nlast one that deals with this perfectly\nif you're going to sit down you're going\nto get work done you're going to need to\ndo the pomodora technique I'm not going\nto go deep into the pomodora technique\nI've talked about it so many damn times\nin this podcast I have a entire episode\nthat that talks about the pomodora\ntechnique that you can go back and\nlisten to but essentially it's very\nsimple when I sit down to work and do\nreally really deep focus I use a\npomodora technique it's 25 minutes on 5\nminutes off so for 25 minutes I can do\none task and one task only and I the\nonly other thing I do have on my desk is\na timer and I set it for 25 minutes and\nI do 25 minutes of dedicated work on one\nthing and one thing only then after I'm\ndone I get myself five minutes off in\nthose five minutes off don't look at\nyour phone don't go talk to somebody\nthere's only a couple things that you\nshould be doing you could go for a walk\nif you want to you can go outside and\njust stare at nature and stare at tree\num you could close your eyes do some\nbreathing do some meditating whatever it\nmight be but the point is to is your\nbrain is so stimulated in those 25\nminutes is not to go do something else\nand stimulate it but is completely to\nDes stimulate your brain so there is no\nstimulation coming in and so it's 25\nminutes on 5 minutes of absolutely\nnothing 25 minutes on 5 minutes of\nabsolutely nothing and what happens is\nyou start to focus on being more\nproductive focus on being more focused\nbecause the both productivity and focus\nare things are like a muscle that you\ncan build within yourself you become\nbetter at it and so you might be lazy\nright now it's okay that you're lazy\nright now I was lazy for a good portion\nof my life but then I started building\nup it's like going to the the the gym\nit's like building up muscles I was\nbuilding up these muscles to be more\nFocus to be more productive get more\nstuff done and it's like a light switch\nsome you know sometimes I walk into the\ngym and I work out sometimes I don't go\nto the gym and I'm not working out so\nit's the same thing sometimes I need to\nsit down I need to get focused I need to\nget stuff done and there are no no\nexcuse for no excuses for for getting\nthose things done and sometimes I'm\ncompletely off I'm lazy I'm watching TV\nand I allow myself to just to you know\nbe a a lazy Rock for an hour or so and\nso it's like turning on and turning off\nyou can be lazy you cannot be lazy but I\nguarantee you this if if if your life\nreally depended on it if someone that\nyou loves life really depended on it if\nthere was a really strong why behind it\nthere would be no such thing as laziness\nfor you you would just get it done when\nit needed to be done without any\nquestions asked without any distractions\nand that's something that you can build\nin yourself you can turn on whatever you\nwant to so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nyou're probably going to love this new\nthing I have coming out called mindset\nMentor plus it is a uh something I\ncreated to help you fully integrate\nevery single episode into your life so\nyou're not just listening to it\npassively but you're actually actively\nlistening to it and engaging with it and\nwhat's going to come with it is every\nsingle episode of this podcast that we\ncreate is going to come out with\ndetailed worksheets of exactly what we\ntaught deeper stuff information so that\nwe can go more deep deeper into the\ntopic than we did in the podcast uh\nbecause obviously we don't have a whole\nlot of time to go in the podcast because\nthese are only 15 to 20 minute episodes\nthere's going to be prompts in\njournaling so that you can journal and\nactually start to figure out how each\nepisode integrates

eventually be\nthousands of people in it um that you\ncan connect with and become friends with\nand maybe some people live in your area\num Aller less than you probably spend on\ncoffee every single month and the people\nwho are the founding members are going\nto get a discount so to sign up for the\nweit list so that you could be a\nfounding member and be the first to\nlearn about it go to mindset\nwaitlist.com right now once again\nmindset waitlist.com and then we'll\nemail it out to you uh before we\nannounce it to anybody else so if you're\ninterested go to that website and with\nthat I'm going to leave you the same way\nI leave you every single episode make it\nyour mission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
