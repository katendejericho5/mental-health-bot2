    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you a few different ways to\nstop self-sabotaging yourself let's dive\nin the success or the failure of a\nbusiness is coming down like 98% of\ntimes to the mindset of the business\nowner and so I always say to people I\nalways ask the question do you think\nthat if there was a switch just like\nright on the side of your head in the\ntemple and you could do on and off and\nif you clicked it off it would turn off\nall of the fear all of the stories all\nof the the the the amydala the thing\nthat's bringing the fears into your your\nlife all of your limiting beliefs you\ncould flip this little switch and turn\nall of those things off do you think you\nwould be more successful and it's always\na resounding yes of course which shows\nthat the people who are in the room\nbasically all of us you know make our\nlives harder than it needs to be if we\nwould be more successful if there was a\nswitch we could turn off our fears and\nour limiting beliefs and our stories\nabout ourselves and so today I'm going\nto talk about those stories those belief\nbeliefs the um the the self- sabotage\nthat we have and um we're going to talk\nabout how you fight for what you don't\nwant and you fight for your insecurities\nmore than the things that you actually\nwant and um I was thinking about this\nbecause I had a team member and we were\njust talking about his life we were\ntalking about his goals and I noticed\nthat as he was explaining his life goals\nto me and what he was working towards he\nkept throwing these little little teeny\ntiny reasons why it was going to be hard\nor why it was going to be difficult for\nhim or why he might not succeed at it\nand he was telling me about his goals\nand what he wanted but then he had these\nlittle things of like yeah but it might\nbe hard and and you know why it might\nnot work out all of the challenges that\nwould pop up all the reasons why he\nwasn't ready why now wasn't the right\ntime everything and I had to stop him\nlike in the middle of it and I was like\nyou're not going to hit your goal and he\nwas like what cuz like I'm the mindset\nMentor you know I'm supposed to be the\nguy who like gets people all excited\nthat's why I hate being called a\nmotivational speaker CU that's not what\nI'm here to do I'm not here to motivate\nand so he's like what do you mean and I\nwas like from from what I see if I were\nto guess your future and I would put a\nlot of money down in this you're not\ngoing to hit that goal that you're\ntelling me about and he's like okay I\nwas like you want to know why because\nyou have not given\nme one really good reason why it's going\nto work out you haven't given me any\ngood reason why it's going to work out\nbut I've been listening to you talk and\nyou've been telling me all of the\nobstacles all of the reasons why it's\nnot going to work out why now is the\nright time why you're not qualified why\nyou're not ready you're finding all of\nthe obstacles in your way and you're\ntelling me about the obstacles and not\nonce have you told me about the\nopportunities that are lying in front of\nyou you're focusing on the obstacles\nyou're not focusing on the opportunities\nand so that's what we tend to do is we\ntend to to focus on all the obstacles\nthat could be in front of us and we\nnever focus on the actual opportunity of\nwhat could become of us of our life of\nour families\nif we do the thing that we ultimately\nwant to do and if you know the way you\ndo one thing is the way you do\neverything this isn't something that\njust happens you know in in the case of\nmy um my employee this isn't something\nthat just happens here it happens all\nover in your life it happens in your\nrelationship it happens to your bank\naccount it happens to your mindset it\nhappens everywhere and I was like you've\ngiven me 10 to 15 in the past like seven\nminutes 10 to 15 small reasons why it\nmight not work out but not one good\nreason why it's going to work out you've\nbasically sold me on why you're not\ngoing to succeed you've sold me on why\nyou're not going to to win the race and\nyou haven't even put your foot on the\nstarting line and I was like do you do\nthat often he's like yeah yeah I guess I\ndo I was like how's that working for you\nlike well not really well you know and\nso so it's really important for us to\nstart to to and to be honest with you\nlike he was completely unaware he was\ndoing it it was very unconscious like\nsubconsciously coming out and I had to\nbring it to him and he's like\nyeah I guess I do kind of do that often\nand so it tends to be you know there's a\nlot of reasons why this is but there's a\ncouple reasons why it happens for most\npeople the first reason why is because\nuh the belief we have in ourselves which\nstems from our childhood you know it\ncomes from our parents it comes from\nother children it comes from our\ninternal story that we build you know\nafter being the worst player on a\nbaseball team and we started telling\nourselves I'm not good enough I'm the\nworst it's all these millions of little\nteeny tiny events\nand happenings in our past that build up\nthis personality of who we think we are\nthis identity of who we think we are\nit's not who we are it's who we think we\nare it's our perception of oursel and so\nwe have this story and and you can you\nknow like think about some of you guys\nhave had parents that have and I've\nheard many stories over the course of my\nyou know professional career doing this\nwhere people talk about how their\nparents talk down to them about how they\nweren't smart enough about how they\nweren't good enough about how nobody in\nour family is athletic so you won't be\neither and there's all these little\nteeny tiny um stories that come from\nparents that children kind of pick and\nchoose which ones they want and they\nkind of take them in they kind of build\nthem into their own identity then\nthere's also other children there's\nbullies that you know you might might\nhave been not really good at sports and\nthen there was a kid that was in your\nclass that was really good at sports and\nhe used to make fun of you for not being\ngood at sports and then he built this\ninternal story of you know not being\ngood enough to do anything or maybe you\nfail a class and the kid sitting next to\nyou is is kind of a little shitty kid\nand he's like oh you're stupid and then\nyou start thinking that you're stupid to\nyourself like this is this is what\nhappens and so we build up this whole\nthing and so then as my my team member\nspeaking to me all of these little teeny\npieces of his story I'm starting to\nnotice and I'm listening to and I'm like\nyou've counted yourself out and you\nhaven't even started started anything\nyet and so it's super important to\nunderstand that and the second reason\nwhy I find a lot of people do this and\nwe tend to self-sabotage is uh if in\nwhen you don't hit your goal you don't\nfeel as let down\nand so because of the fact that you're\nthinking to yourself oh I really want\nthis but then you're telling yourself 10\nto 15 reasons why it's probably not\ngoing to work out you self-sabotage and\neither don't start or you give up in the\nmiddle of it because you're going to\nlose anyway so you might as well not\nfinish because if you're going to lose\nanyways why put any more why put an\nounce of energy more and then if you do\nend up putting the effort through and\nend up going through and you don't\nsucceed the way that you want to you\ndon't feel as let down\nso you are like that's okay because I\nknew I was going to it's it's it's hard\nto get yourself really excited about\nsomething and then be let down by it and\nnot have it right it's easier to be like\nOh I'm probably going to fail and then\nwhen you do fail you're like well at\nleast I wasn't excited about it but if\nyou're focusing on it not working out\nit's not going to work out it's a\nself-fulfilling prophecy is what it is\nand I don't know about you but I would\nrather talk to myself like talk well to\nmyself and build myself up and get\nmyself excited and try to build my\nconfidence and fail at something then\ntalk down to myself and fail so that I\ndon't feel as let down at least I didn't\nfeel like the entire time I was\ntrying to do it right I was building\nmyself I was trying to get better so I'd\nrather talk talk myself up and fail then\ntalk down to myself and tell myself it's\nnot going to work out and then fail and\nnot feel as let down by doing it cuz\nthen you're just beating yourself up the\nentire time for most people you'd rather\nbe miserable and right in your failure\nthen uncomfortable and possibly be wrong\nand succeed it's the weirdest thing that\nI see is that because of the fact that\nyou have failed so many times you're\nmore comfortable in Failure than you are\nin success and so you you'd rather be\nmiserable and then think you're not\ngoing to succeed and then not succeed\nand you're right about your failure than\nreally uncomfortable for an extended\namount of time to go do something you've\nnever done before and possibly be wrong\nabout yourself and succeed at it it's\nthe craziest thing and most people don't\nwant to be miserable that are miserable\nbut it's\ncomfortable so they go back to the\nComfort even though they don't want to\nbe there they go back to the Comfort so\nin this case I'm sitting down and I'm\nI'm talking to my my team member and I\nwas like tell me why it's going to work\ntell me about all the opportunities in\nfront of you and tell me how this it's\nan amazing opportunity and build this\nthis amazing story for me and he Ed\nsaying it will work because of this and\nit will work because of that and these\nare the opportunities that are in front\nof\nme but there was like no passion behind\nthere's there's no belief behind it I\ncould tell that he felt like he was full\nof and I was like stop stop stop\nstop stop I was like I don't believe you\nand if I don't believe you you don't\nbelieve you so stop and I want you to\nstart over again I want you to tell me\nas if you're trying to sell\nme on why this is going to work with you\nwhy is this going to work make me\nbelieve it tell me the opportunities\ntell me as if I am a investor and I'm\ntrying to invest into your future why is\nthis going to work with you like sell me\non this\nopportunity it's going to work because\nof this and it's going to work because\nof that it's a great opportunity because\nof this because of\nthat and you have to understand\neverything as he started to actually\ntalk about it and start to talk about it\nhe started believing in it more and I\nstarted believing in it more and as he\nstarted believing in it more his\ntonality changed and his body language\nchanged everything about him changed\nbecause he actually started speaking it\ninto existence starting believing it and\nas he started believing it he started\ngetting more excited and his body\nlanguage changed he started to sit up a\nlittle bit more he started his hands\nstarted moving more and I was like does\nthat feel different for you his exact\nanswer was I literally feel different in\nmy body so what would your life be like\nif you went and looked at everything\nthrough the lens of opportunity not the\nlens of obstacles all too often I see\npeople fighting for reasons why they\nwill not succe I see people I see people\nall over the world fight for their\ninsecurities I've told a story before in\nthe podcast but years ago I ran an event\nfor all business owners and um and I\nturned to to the person I was running\nDean I was running the event with him\nand I go watch I'm going to try to\ntrigger somebody and I was like just\nfollow my lead he was like all right\ngood for it and then so I said I said\nwho here thinks it would be awesome to\nmake a million dollars a month and\neveryone's hand goes up and I was like\nwhy aren't you making a million dollars\na month\nyet and it was silent for a while and I\nwent to each person that I could until I\nuntil somebody I could tell was like a\nlittle bit agitated and I was like you\nknow tell me you know what would it you\nknow why aren't you making a million\ndollars a month oh because I've got this\nproblem I've got this problem why aren't\nyou making a million dollars a month\nthis problem this problem and I got to\none person and there was a lady and and\nI was like why aren't you making a\nmillion a month and I could tell that\nthere was something bubbling to the\nsurface and I was like you look a little\nbit triggered are you triggered and\nshe's like I am triggered and I was like\nokay why are you triggered and she's\nlike well I'm like I I can't do it\nbecause of this and because of that and\nyou know you're my coach and you're not\neven consistently hitting a million\ndollars a month so if you're not like\nwhy aren't you hitting it and then she\nstarted like getting kind of aggressive\nand I was like this is what I was\nlooking for right and so um and she's\nshe's telling me you know before she\nstarted saying to me like why aren't you\nat a million dollars every single every\nsingle month um we were talking about it\nand she was like I'm not going to do it\nbecause of this and I could tell that\nthat looking at the opportunity of her\nbusiness being bigger than she could\npossibly imagine started triggering her\nin some sort of way and then she started\nfighting for her insecurities fighting\nfor why she's not going to and she was\nunconsciously selling me on why it's not\ngoing to happen ever and I was like okay\ngreat thanks for that and I had her come\nup to the she was she was like so into\nit I was like come on up like come up to\nthe front let's talk about it and she\nwas up in the front she was freaking out\nand all this stuff not freaking out she\nwas just she was very triggered you\ncould tell um and we had known each\nother for a long time so it was nothing\nbut love and I was like Hey do you see\nhow you're fighting for your\ninsecurities and she was\nlike I guess and I was like when I asked\nyou why aren't you making a million\ndollars a month you started aggressively\ntelling me like you're telling your body\nlanguage and your tonality all of this\nand what you did was sell me on your\ninsecurities sell me on why it's not\ngoing to work I was like I've never seen\nyou that aggressive for why it is going\nto\nwork so why don't you sell me on your\nopportunities the same way with the same\namount of passion with the same amount\nof emphasis into everything I was like\ndo you think that you're not going to\nsucceed kind of often she's like yeah I\ndo I was like do you have your\ninsecurities come up a lot throughout\nthe day when you're trying to build your\nbusiness she's like absolutely all of\nthe time she's like it's harder to to\nstop my mind from talking to me\nthan it is to build my business but my\nbusiness isn't growing because I can't\nstop my\nmind and so I was like if you can sell\nme so passionately on why you can't do\nsomething can you sell me passionately\nand why you can't do something there's\nso many people that are out there in\nthis world that are fighting for their\ninsecurities just so they can be\nright that's the crazy part about it\nthey'll fight for the reasons why it\nwon't happen so that when it doesn't\nhappen they were right versus I'd rather\njump off in a possibility and be wrong\nand succeed right your brain will\nnaturally go negative I've said it\nthousands of time in this podcast a\nbrain left to its own devices will go\nnegative so you have to be intentional\nabout finding the positive you need to\nstart noticing this you need to be\nintentional you need to be more uh\nbecome more self-aware of when your\nbrain starts to go towards the negative\nwhen your story starts to tell you why\nyou're not good enough why you're not\nsmart enough why it's not going to work\nout why you're going to be alone forever\nwhatever it might be you need to get\nbetter at selling yourself on the\nreasons why it will work and you switch\nyour your mindset around it it's in\ncognitive behavioral therapy it's called\ncognitive reframing you have to be aware\nof all of the stuff that you want to\nchange first you can't change anything\nthat's outside of your awareness but\nwhen something's inside of your\nawareness you can you can change it and\nso become aware and start journaling\nokay next time this happens this is what\nI'm going to do and come up with a plan\nthen become aware of when it does happen\nwhatever it might be you talking down to\nyourself why it's not going to work uh\nwhy it's you're you're self- sabotaging\nand whatever it might be that's popping\nup so you have to become aware in the\nmoment next and then you need to\nintentionally change your thoughts and\nyour actions around that thing\nintentionally change your thoughts and\nyour actions that's cognitive reframing\nand you need to repeat this over and\nover again you need to become the\nbouncer of your mind it is I promise you\nit is very tedious it is so damn tedious\nI've been doing it for so long in my\nlife but it is so important and if you\nstart changing your thoughts over and\nover and over and over again I always\nsay you can't control your first thought\nbut you can always control your second\nthought and if you control your second\nthought enough over years not two or\nthree months but over years your second\nthought will eventually become that\nfirst thought that you wanted to become\nit's so tedious but it's so important I\ntry to challenge my thinking as often as\nI possibly can it is it is a debate in\nmy head almost all day long it's a\ndebate when I notice my old story that I\ndon't want anymore that I got through\nchildhood and through adolescence and\nthrough teenage years and college and\nall of that and I look at it and I say\nis that\ntrue is that true or is it just my\nperception and I want to you know is it\ntrue is in cognitive behavioral therapy\nthey say to test the validity of your\nthoughts so I'm t is that true that I\nwas just thinking that thing about me or\nabout my success or who I'm going to be\nor the people around me or my family or\nwhatever it is is that true or is that\njust my\nperception guess what it's always my\nperception and if perception is just a\npart of the whole story what else could\nbe true that is outside of my perception\nis there another side to the coin that\nI'm now not allowing myself to see and\nI'm testing every single thought and\nonce you test it enough you'll realize\nit's like a house of cards you just give\nit one good flick in the whole thing\ncomes falling down your whole belief\nsystem just come falling down and then\nyou can start to rebuild your belief\nsystem way that you want to believe your\nbelief system and so the reason why you\nself- sabotages is because of you know\nwho you are how you are raised things\nthat you picked up along the way and a\nlot of it is very very\nunconscious but your job as an adult\nlistening to this podcast to become very\nconscious of your belief system and the\nbelief system that you want to change\nand as they start to pop up actually\nstart to change them and that is\nultimately what's going to help you\nchange your mind mindset which help you\nchange your life so that's all I got for\nyou for this episode if you love this\npodcast you'll also probably really love\nsomething I got coming up it's
