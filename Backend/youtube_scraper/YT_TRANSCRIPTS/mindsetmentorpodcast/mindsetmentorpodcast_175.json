    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you my top two secrets to help\nyou be more successful let's dive in I\nfeel lucky in the fact that I've checked\noff a lot of boxes in my life and uh I\nconsider myself at this point in time in\nmy life to be qualified to to give this\nadvice of what it actually takes to\nchange your life completely and to get\nto where you want to go and to become\nsuccessful and uh this isn't one of the\nkeys but the first thing that I think is\nvery important for every single person\nis for you to Define what success means\nto you right because what means success\nmeans to me is different than you then\nis different than every other person and\nso I think the first thing is like\ndecide what the target is that we're\ntrying to shoot for so that's the first\nthing I think is super important before\nwe dive into the keys is is really just\nlike figure out what success is for some\npeople might be making $10 million for\nsome people might be being the best\nmother they possibly could or being the\nmost present father that they possibly\ncould or to go out and do um more work\nfor their community so it's like what\ndoes it mean to you is the first thing I\nreally want you to figure out and then\nthe first key that I have for you which\nis something that I have found uh I\ndon't know if I did it consciously or\nunconsciously if I'm being honest with\nyou I think I just kind of started\nfollowing what felt right like I really\ntruly trust my intuition and I trust\nwhen I get a feeling to listen to that\nto be quiet to it and and to try to\nfollow it and so my first key that I\nnever hear anybody talk about you could\nread all of the success books all of the\nhow to get rich quick books or whatever\nthe they are that are out there I\nnever hear anybody talk about this and\nthe biggest key that that I think I\ncould give you is alignment is what is\nalignment for you like what is it that\nyou feel is the absolute best path for\nyou not the path that has been\nprogrammed into you by your parents or\nby Society or by how much money you\nthink you should be making or by\nfollowing the the the best major that's\ngoing to pay the best for you but like\nwhat feels like the actual thing that\nyou want to do in this world and you\nneed to follow it and so it's really\ninteresting for me is that I ended up\nyou know quitting my job in 2012 I\nbackpacked in 2012 for 6 months or for\nthree months by myself and then I went\nback to Tampa where I was from and I was\nlike I feel like I'm supposed to be a\nmusician like I really more than\nanything else in this world want to be a\nmusician and so I moved over to Austin\nbecause it was either Austin or\nNashville because both of them are big\nmusic cities and uh I didn't want to go\nto Nashville because it was too cold and\num and so I was like all right I've\nmoved to Austin I've heard some really\ngood things and this before it blew up\nand uh I moved over here and started\nmeeting people and started getting the\nmusic scene and all of that you know\ntook took music lessons took voice\nlessons bought equipment microphones uh\naudio interfaces all of this stuff and\num and I was really hard coring it for\nyears and then I just had this feeling\nthat I should start a podcast in 2015 so\nthree years after being I was like I\nfeel like I need to start a podcast the\nbest part about it was that everything\nthat I needed to do inside uh of being a\nmusician was almost completely\ntransferable to to being a podcaster as\nwell like this microphone that I'm using\nright now is the exact microphone that I\nhad and the same microphone I've been\nrecording on for almost a decade at this\npoint uh I had an audio interface that\nwas already there so I already had the\nthe microphone I already had the audio\ninterface I already had the programs to\nmake make it on there I had been taking\nvocal lessons for years so I was my my\nspeech was was pretty good at that point\nin time um I had done public speaking\nfor years so it just kind of fit and\nthen as I was writing podcasts out I\nrealized that as I write wrote podcasts\nout it was the same way that I I made\nmusic it was the same way that I did\nsongwriting and the way I would obsess\nover making sure that everything was\nperfect in it and there would flow and\nand all of that and so even though I\nthought like Oh My ultimate life goal is\nto be a musician which I'm still\nobsessed with music it really was once I\nstarted podcasting it scratched that\nitch that I had for creativity and and\nthen I really started falling in love\nbecause this is ultimately a thing I\nlove more than anything else\nand so all I did though and the reason I\ntell you that story is all I did was\nbecause I followed What felt right not\nbecause it was logical for me to go hey\nI'm going to move from the city I've\nbeen in the majority of my life halfway\nacross the country to a city I've never\nbeen to where I know one person doesn't\nmake any sense but I followed What felt\nright and then when I decided to to\nstart a podcast I followed What felt\nright and that's what I mean by\nalignment is what feels right there's so\nmany people listening to me right now in\nyour profession\nand where you live and the people you\nsurround yourself with don't feel right\nand you won't take a step back or maybe\nyou haven't taken a step back to\nactually look at it from a 50,000 foot\nover you and be like does this feel\nright does this relationship feel right\ndoes this job feel right does this\nprofession does this major all of this\nstuff where I live does all of this feel\nright and actually start to follow what\nfeels aligned with you when you find\nsomething that feels aligned with you\nit's so easy to put in the work because\nsuccess whatever that means to you\nrequires hard work it does and there's\nno way around it you can either decide\nthat you're going to work on and change\nyour life or you can sit on the couch\nand do nothing with yourself right or\nyou can pretend like you're being\nproactive but really what you're doing\nis you know being busy and stuff like\nsuccess requires work business success\nrequires work relationship success\nrequires work Health and Fitness success\nrequires work uh parenting success\nrequires work work and the biggest thing\nthat I see that that people make the\ndecision that they're going to do is\nthey build a business or they follow a\nmajor or they work for a company simply\nbecause they're chasing money my first\nyear of college I went and got a degree\nor started going towards a degree uh\nsimply because I knew that that degree\npaid well and then after a first year I\nwas like this doesn't feel like one\nsomething I want to do and I just\nnaturally followed my intuition again it\nit requires hard work to be successful\nand you can either work hard doing\nsomething that you don't enjoy and you\ncan eventually make a lot of money doing\nit but you're still going to have you've\nalready gone down that path you either\ngot to get off of that path or continue\ndown that path to doing the thing that\nyou don't want to do anymore or you can\nreally start to take a really hard look\nat your life and say what is it that I\nwant what is it that feels right what do\nI want my life to be in 20\nyears and then you go okay that's the\nthing I want to be doing and you can\nwork hard doing something that you love\nthat feels align with you and the best\npart about that and it's cliche I get it\nit's completely cliche but when you\nreally love what you're doing it doesn't\nfeel like work are there parts of it\nthat are hard and and it's it's\nchallenging of course 100% you're not\ngoing to get around that in any case in\nyour life but it it it feels fun to do\nit feels exciting to do and you don't\nfeel like you're working so you don't\nhave to struggle your way to success you\nnaturally just want to get you're more\ncurious about learning about that thing\nand getting better at that thing and the\nmoney almost never comes right away but\nover the long term\nit comes and it's usually way more than\nyou expect like I've told the story of\nthe Chinese bamboo a ton of times and uh\nyou know you plant a Chinese bamboo seed\nand it you give it the water and the the\nnutrients and the everything it needs\nthe right soil gets the sun year one it\ndoesn't come up through the ground year\ntwo it doesn't come up through the\nground year three doesn't come up\nthrough the ground year four doesn't\ncome up through ground year five doesn't\ncome up through ground and then year six\nit grows 80 feet in 6 weeks sometimes\nit'll grow 2 feet e in a day they say it\ngrows so much you can actually like see\nit\ngrowing now that's kind of how success\nis is it usually doesn't come right away\nand it doesn't come as it never comes as\nfast as you want to I promise you that\nbut when it does come it's way more than\nyou thought it could be and that's\nwhat's cool about it success is a\nmarathon and if you love what you do if\nyou're interested in what you do you can\nlast if you don't love what you do and\nit doesn't feel aligned with you you\nwill burn out the only way you burn out\nis not by doing too much the way that\nburnout is not doing enough of what you\nlove sure if you don't love it you could\nlast for 5 6 seven years but 10 15 20 30\nyears no it's going to be hell if you\ndon't love what you do and this is why I\nalways see people that are like\nextremely wealthy and people are like\nthey're so rich why don't they just\nretire is because most of them the end\ngoal was never the money it was just\nthey were they work put so much work\ninto it because the fact they actually\nloved it or they were interested in or\nthey wanted to solve a problem for the\nworld it was usually never about the\nmoney it's usually about the passion the\nwanting to you know solve a specific\nproblem in the\nworld and it's fun to them so they just\nkeep on doing it it's like I would this\nis fun it's like a game I'd rather do\nthis than stay at home and do nothing\nand so you really got to start to think\nlike what is it that feels the most\nalign for you and you've got to start to\ntrust that and it it doesn't ever make\nsense looking forward doesn't make sense\nat all looking backwards all of the dots\nconnect moving here to to Austin Texas\nCU I want to be a musician made no sense\nit felt right but it made no sense now\nthat you know it's been over a decade\nsince I've been here and I see how my\nlife has changed and moved around and\nhow everything fits perfectly into\nexactly the the way that it should for\nthis puzzle that the past decade 15\nyears have been of my life I'm like oh\nmy God I can't believe how perfect all\nof this worked out for me and so you've\nreally got to take a step back and be\nlike what feels most aligned for me\nthat's the first thing you need to be\naligned truly need to be aligned my\nnumber two key to success is not sexy at\nall I rarely hear it as well and it\nmight surprise you a little bit here it\nis my number one key to success as hard\nas it or my number two key to success as\nhard as it is is\npatience and I'll explain why in this\nepisode as we continue to keep going\nthrough it but it's not that sexy right\nyou guys are like H patience you know\nthere's a there's a a few other key\nmindset shifts to make to be a little\nbit more patient you know we live in the\nworld where everything is immediate you\ncan get whatever it is that you want\nright now you know if you want something\nyou know luxury bracelet you could\nprobably get it overnighted to you if\nyou wired the money to them today and\nit's going to be at your house tomorrow\nmorning you want food to be delivered to\nif you want to be driven somewhere\nsomeone will come pick you up within the\nnext five minutes you know if you want\nyour food delivered to you can get in\nthe next 15 to 30 minutes everything is\njust immediate knowledge is immediate at\nthis point right you can just Google\nsomething immediately know success\nthough is not immediate and a lot of\ntimes we think that just because\nsomebody pops out of nowhere they be\nbuild a massive company or they're\nmassively successful or they're a\nmassive musician out of nowhere you\nthink that it just happened overnight\nand it didn't it was you don't see the\n10 to 15 years of hard work sometimes\neven more than that accumulating skills\naccumulating Talent accumulating\nknowledge to get them to where they need\nto be so it looks like this immediate\nmeteoric rise but in reality it was a\nreally slow burn for a long time it was\nthat that not even that bamboo just not\neven popping out of the surface for the\nlongest time and as I get older I can\nsee all of these micro decisions that I\nmade that paid off and I was just\npersistent and I was patient and um it's\nreally kind of wild because I'm I can\nlook back to when I was you know half my\nlife ago when I was 19 years old and be\nlike wow I can't believe the choices\nthat I made and I just trusted in them\nand then I just continue to be\npersistent and patient and eventually\nit's all been paying off but you know\nthat's like 20 years that it's been\ngoing so most of us want like success\nnow but you know before you can be be\npatient you have to decide what is that\nyou want which is why the alignment\nthing is so important like before I\nstart driving my car I have to decide\nwhere I want to go otherwise I'm just\ndriving around and wandering around too\nmany people are just wandering around in\ntheir lives and they're they're pissed\noff that they haven't gotten what they\nwant yet and then you ask them what they\nwant and they can't even tell you in a\nfull sentence right so once you've\ndecided what is that you want you have\nto get rid of all other options you have\nto make up your mind you have to burn\nthe ships you have to to focus on plan a\nthere should be no plan B because it\ntakes away from plan a and then it's\nit's either I get it or I die trying and\nyou make the decision I just will not\nstop at this this is where a lot of\npeople stop they go oh yeah I'm just I'm\njust gonna I'm just GNA I'll give it a\nfew months no you're not going to get\nwhat you want in a few months it doesn't\nwork like that people work for 3 months\nand then they give up you want to\nsucceed just stop stopping going back to\nme starting the podcast again I remember\nreading an article before I started the\npodcast and it said the average podcast\num has seven episodes and then the\nperson gives up and so for me like when\nI decide to do something it is I'm going\nto do this forever so I like I'm going\nto do this podcasting thing and if I\njust don't stop I'm sure I'll figure it\nout I'm sure I'll figure out my flow I'm\nsure I'll figure out what what type of\nstuff that I can create that that I like\nto make but also people\nenjoy and so you've just got to decide\nwhat it is and this decided yourself I'm\njust going to I'm going all in on this\nthing and I'm either going to succeed or\nI'm going to die trying and then the\nnext step is to get moving it doesn't\nmatter how fast you go as long as you're\nheading in the right direction you know\nI always say that that success takes a\ncertain amount of time it takes a\ncertain amount of effort and you don't\nknow how much time and how much effort\nit takes you've just got to let the time\npass and you've got to make sure that\nyou're putting in the effort like I\nalways say like if if success was a mile\nlong mile from you right now you could\neither crawl that entire mile you could\nprocrastinate as you're going through\nthe mile you could walk the mile or you\ncould run the\nmile it's going to take you a mile you\nknow success is one mile away you know\nthis is obviously analogy but uh if the\nfaster you put in success the more the\nfaster you put in effort the more effort\nyou put in the faster that you're going\nto see success and so as long as you're\nheading in the right direction that's\nthe most important thing the only thing\nthat you can really fully control goal\nwhen you're trying to work towards what\nit is that you want to go is the\ndirection that you're heading and the\neffort that you put in the more effort\nthat you put in the more likely you are\nto succeed and the faster you are likely\nto succeed as well but all you need to\nfocus on is the daily effort not that\nyou're not there yet not that I don't\nknow if this is going to work but you\njust put the effort in and eventually\nthe effort's going to build upon itself\nyou're going to get to where you want to\ngo everything has a certain amount of\ntime in this universe in order for it to\nbe here in order for it to manifest\nright like a a baby takes 9 months to be\nborn sure there's premature there's some\nthat go a little bit further but most\nbabies take nine\nmonths the universe has decided that and\nso the universe has decided it takes\nnine months for a human child to be born\nwell the universe has decided the effort\nin the time that it will take for you to\nsucceed you don't know how much effort\nit's going to take you you don't know\nhow much time it's going to take but you\ncan't control how much time it's going\nto going to take the only thing that you\ncontrol that situation is number one\nheading in the right direction and\nnumber two is the effort and the effort\nis where I usually see most people fail\nis they don't put in enough effort they\ndon't put in they haven't made the\ndecision that this is what I'm going to\ndo they haven't made the decision that\nI'm going to wake up every single day\nand just do this thing and eventually it\nwill pay off if you just don't stop at\nwhatever it is that you want you will\nabsolutely 100% become world class at\nthat thing no matter what that thing is\nand if you're interested in it I\nguarantee there's other people who are\ninterested in it and they might want to\nlearn from you or they might want to\ncome and see you or they might want to\nuh you know you might be able to come up\nwith an idea as you start becoming world\nclass at something as an idea to make it\nyou know something you can you can\ninvent or create to make it more\nefficient or to make it better whatever\nthat thing might be but you can't see\nthat Viewpoint until you put in the\neffort to be able to see that Viewpoint\nthe only thing that you can control in\nthat situation that you're you should be\nfocusing on most is the effort putting\nin the effort not scrolling on Instagram\ninstead of putting in the effort not I\ndon't know if I'm good enough versus\ninstead of putting in the effort not\nprocrastinating and self- sabotaging\ninstead of putting the effort it's the\neffort put in the effort and then just\nbe patient and I know it's not that fun\nit's not that fun you always want it to\nhappen faster than it will but I promise\nyou this and I can tell you from my\npersonal experience and many many many\nmany many people that I've seen that\nhave that have become world class at\nsomething or successful at something or\nor great at something is that you\ncontrol the effort and all you have to\ndo is just take a step back and say I\njust trust it eventually I'm going to\nget there and we always want it to\nhappen faster than it will it will\nalways almost always take longer than\nyou want it to but when it does happen\nit will be 10 times better than you\nthought it was going to be so all you\nhave to do is number one make sure\nyou're aligned number two make sure that\nyou're patient and then obviously part\nof the patience is you got to put the\nwork in that's the the key between the\ntwo of them as well so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode uh if you uh\nlove this episode if you love this\npodcast um I'm about to launch something\ncalled mindset Mentor plus uh so you can\nstop just listening to this podcast but\nyou can also fully integrate it into\nyour life and um we're going to be\ngiving out with everybody in mindset\nMentor plus
