    "transcript": "so here's a really really simple\nstrategy to be successful write down all\nof your goals reason why I say that is\nbecause Harvard did a study in the 1970s\nwith all of their graduating class and\nfound out that only 3% of those students\nwho were graduating wrote down their\ngoals but 10 years later they followed\nup with all of those students and found\nout that the 3% that wrote down their\ngoals were more than 10 times more\nsuccessful than the entire 97% combined\nthey didn't write down their goals and\nso that brings the question why is that\nwell cuz when you write down your goals\nit makes them real it makes them\nphysically exist in this world and when\nit's on paper it makes it so much easier\nto be planned so if somebody wants to be\nreally successful it's real simple just\nstart by writing down your goals"
