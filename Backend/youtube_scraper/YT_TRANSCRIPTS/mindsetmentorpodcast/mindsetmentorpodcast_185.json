    "transcript": "welcome today I'm going to be giving you\nseven tips to be more disciplined in\nyour life so that you can take the\naction you need to to create the life\nthat you want to Let's dive in more\ndiscipline that you do have throughout\nyour life the more you can get yourself\nto do more and not have to really\nnecessarily Force but it's just\nsomething that you naturally do because\nyou're building same way that you can\nbuild confidence within yourself\nnobody's born with confidence you can\nalso build discipline within yourself\nbecause nobody's born with discipline\nnow when you when you look at actually\ndiscipline itself it's actually kind of\nimportant that we really start to dive\ninto what is discipline because if I ask\neach person on the street that I pass\nwhat is discipline to you it's going to\nbe a little bit different of an answer\nbut when I talk about discipline I\nsimply the easiest way to put it is\nbeing able to get yourself to take\naction especially when you don't feel\nlike it take action regardless of how\nyou feel and I don't mean like if you're\nsuper sick or in the hospital you have\nto get work done but I mean like you're\nsitting around it's a normal day you\nfeel fine you're on your couch you're\nlike I need to do something oh I'm not\ngoing to do it boo I don't really feel\nlike doing it today and then you don't\ngo to the gym or you don't make your\ncold calls or you don't build your\nbusiness whatever it is it's the feeling\nof the the resistance of I don't want to\ndo this and then leaning into that\nresistance versus building a muscle of\nLeaning away from the resistance because\nat this point it's a habit to give up\nit's a habit to throw throw in the towel\nwhen things feel a little bit difficult\nand so at this point you might have over\n10 20 30 years built up the quote\nunquote muscle of giving up when things\nget tough now we want to talk about how\ndo you build the muscle of leaning in\nwhen things get tough doing it\nregardless of how you feel following the\nmind and what the mind says versus the\nbody of being like Oh I'm tired the Mind\nknows you need to do it but there's a\ndisconnect somewhere in there and so\nlet's go the through the the seven ways\nto help you okay the first one is to do\nthis thing that I call focusing on\nopportunity not obligation you're not\ngoing to love everything that you have\nto do like for me I love this podcast\nbut there are aspects of it like the\nplanning out of the podcast all of the\nresearch that I have to do you know it\ntakes 15 to 20 minutes to record a\npodcast but it takes like an hour hour\nand a half to plan and research an\nentire podcast right so I love coming\nhere turning on the cameras turning on\nthe microphone speaking\nthere's also part of I don't really love\nyou know and that's the whole planning\nand and putting it all in order and\nhaving to do all of that but what's\nreally important of it is that is the\nobligation is I have to do that the\nopportunity is this is going to go out\nto potentially millions of people and\nsome people's lives are going to change\nfrom it and so you have to remind\nyourself of your why so the obligation\nalways needs to be done right the\nresearch the putting together that needs\nto be done the opportunity is man it\ncould go out to millions of people and\nchange people's lives another thing\nthat's an example of like obligation\nversus opportunity is like obligation is\nyou you have to eat healthier you have\nto go to the gym that's the obligation\nbut the opportunity is hey I could be\nhealthier I could be in less pain and I\ncould live longer so you're still going\nto have to do the obligation but you're\ngoing to be focusing on your why why you\nactually want to do it and so I'm going\nto have a question for you at the end of\neach one of these seven and I got two\nquestions for you on this one is where\nare you not taking action where you\nshould be and what opportunity should\nyou be focusing on right so like what's\nsomething you've been wanting to do and\ninstead of doing it you've been focusing\non the obligation of like this task that\nyou have to do versus the long-term\noutcome or results that you're going to\nget from doing that thing that you need\nto do so that's the difference between\nopportunity versus obligation obligation\nwhat you have to do it still needs to be\ndone but you're focusing on quote\nunquote how hard how tough it's going to\nbe versus hey what is this going to get\nme that's the difference um so that's\nthe the first thing number two is to do\nthe small things really well I'm a a\nreally big believer on mastering the\nsmall things you know if you look at the\nbest athletes in the world if you look\nat Steph Curry before every single\nbasketball game he does the exact same\ndribbling technique in mastering the\nfundamentals athletes Master the\nfundamentals they focus on the small\nthings and so success is doing the small\nthings the right way day in day out and\njust being consistent with that so like\nwhat are the small things required for\nyou to get what you want I always talk\nabout the act of like you know finishing\nthe task that you do so for instance\nwhen you get done with sleeping finish\nthe ACT make the bed it'll take you 45\nseconds but and believe me I'm the type\nof person that's like I don't really\ncare you know like I don't use my\nbedroom except for sleeping right I\ndon't really care cuz I don't walk in\nthere and see it but it's the simple Act\nof I need to finish what I started right\nit's a small things do the small things\nreally well if you end up uh eating\nsomething wash the dish immediately and\nput it away wash it dry put it away just\nget into the act of doing those small\nthings is it going to change the world\nif you make your bed absolutely not is\nit going to change the world if you wash\none dish absolutely not but you're\ntraining yourself to finish what you\nstarted which is a huge part of being\ndisciplined so the question I have for\nyou on this one that you can Journal\nthrough is what are the small things\nthat I need to master every single day\nwhat are the little teeny tiny things\nthat you know you should be doing okay\nnumber three is to design your\nenvironment uh this is super super\nimportant I wrote about this in my book\nmy book's called level up if you want to\nget it and in level up I say that there\nfor me there's a difference between Rob\nwith sugar in the house and Rob without\nsugar in the house if you've been\nlistening to this podcast for a while\nyou probably we know I got a sweet tooth\nand when I have sugar I just want to\nfinish an entire bag of something right\nand so for me the the thing that I wrote\nabout inside the book was that but then\nalso what I said is the most disciplined\npeople the people with the highest\nwillpower are not necessarily more\ndisciplined or have higher willpower\nthey just don't test their willpower\nthey design environments for their\nwillpower to not be tested you know if\nyou need to get work done and you only\nfind yourself on your phone whenever\nyou're needing get work done throw your\nphone in a in another room and don't\nallow yourself to go into that other\nroom and now you just got to sit and do\nsome work and so how can you design your\nenvironment to not test your your\nwillpower not test your discipline but\nmake it easier for you to be able to do\nwhatever action is that you need to do\nso like for me if I have a piece of\ncandy I want the entire bag so what do I\ndo I design my environment I just don't\nbuy any\ncandy if you look at my desk literally\nthere's when I when I'm working there's\nnothing on my desk it's my computer\nstand it's my uh my trackpad and it's my\num keyboard and then there's an external\nmonitor that's it there's nothing else\nthat's on it I can't go and search\nthrough my phone I can't you know doodle\nsomething on a piece of paper like it's\nit's the only thing that's in front of\nme because then I have no other option\nbut to do what needs to be done waste I\nput this in my book too but you know if\nyou waste too much time on the couch\ntake all of the cushions off the couch\nand throw them in your closet in the\nmorning because if you ever sat on your\ncouch without cushions I guarantee you\nit's not comfortable if you waste your\ntime by having too much time on social\nmedia you can use apps to help you with\nthat there's one app that's called one\nsec o n c I'm not affiliated with them\nanyway I should be based off how many\npeople I've sent to it but if you're on\nInstagram too much it when you click on\nInstagram it will delay 10 seconds\nbefore it actually pulls up Instagram it\ntells you to go through a breathing\ntechnique to breathe in and breathe out\nand it shows you how to do it on your\nphone and a lot of times you can open up\nyour phone unconsciously go to Instagram\nand find yourself on Instagram for 17\nminutes but if you go to Instagram and\nthen you see there's a 10-second delay\nit says at the bottom do you still want\nto go to Instagram yes or no and you\njust click no and then it just closes it\nall out so that's a way to help you with\nsocial media or you can use something\nlike you know uh there's apps called an\napp called Freedom you can use on a\ncomputer that doesn't allow you to go to\ncertain programs certain websites if\nit's a certain time of the day you know\nif you want to go up and and wake up and\nand go for a run put your running shoes\nin your entire outfit and your underwear\nand your socks next to the sink so that\nwhen you wake up you brush your teeth\nand you just get clothes on you\ncould just wear those clothes to bed if\nyou wanted to make it easier for you to\ndo this stuff how can you design your\nentire environment how can you design\nyour entire environment design your\nenvironment to support you taking action\nokay so the question you can journal on\nthis one is what what in my environment\ndo I need to change in order to make\ntaking action easier on\nmyself okay tip number four to help you\nget there make your body move just the\nthere's study after study after study\nthat shows basically that when you're\ninactive it makes it easier to stay\ninactive when you're active it makes it\neasier to stay active so if I'm finding\nmyself inactive I need to break the\nactual habit of inactivity\nand get my body moving in some sort of\nway you know I almost never feel like\nworking out but after working out I can\nusually make myself go a little bit more\nI'll be like all right I'm going to do\n45 minutes and then 45 minutes I'm like\nI could probably do another five I\nactually want to do more sets more reps\nand feel amazing after pushing myself\nfurther but at the beginning of it\nbefore I actually start I'm like I don't\nwant to freaking do it and when I first\nwalk in I'm like I don't even want to be\nhere but at the end of it I'm like I\nfeel amazing I can go a little bit more\nso what happened I forced my body to\ncreate action I force my body to find\nenergy and in that action chem chemicals\nchange in my body and you know in my\nbody then sent a message to my brain\nthat gave me more drive to keep going\nbecause action creates more action and\ninaction creates more inaction and so\nget your body moving and so what I would\nrecommend is is make the barrier to\nentry as low as you can so I don't think\nthat you need to go and just do an\nhourlong workout every single day but if\nyou need to get your body moving in some\nsort of way whether that's to go to a\nworkout or whether that's to literally\njust get some work done how can you\ndesign your environment to change and\nactually make it easier to take that\naction what is a what is a five minute\nmovement that I can do to get my energy\nflowing and what I would do is go on to\nYouTube and type in five minute\nhigh-intensity interval workout or five\nminute yoga routine or five minute uh\nband workout something that's going to\nget your heart rate up in 5 minutes\nbelieve me if you start doing these\ndon't underestimate these these YouTube\nhigh-intensity interval workouts in 5\nminutes you can get yourself sweating\nand so I would go online and try out a\nfew of them find the one that you really\nlike and have that be the pattern\ninterrupt when you find yourself being\nlazy and sitting around and doing\nnothing you're like I got to get up I\ngot to figure out what I need to do this\nhas to happen I'm going to put it on and\nI'm going to go so you don't have to\nthink about it it's saved in your\nbookmarks you just click it because the\nmore that you have to think the more you\nhave to do the less likely you are to do\nsomething I don't have to think about it\nI just go to bookmarks I go to the one\nthat I pick that I like and I just make\nmyself move and after those 5 minutes\nyou're going to feel like taking more\naction so that's number four number five\nis basically just do a countdown and go\nso Mel Robbins wrote an entire book on\nthis it's called the 5c rule me it's\ninteresting this is something that I\nused to do when I was younger I was I\nused to be really really shy and um in\neth grade I realized I'm never going to\nhave a girlfriend if I don't talk to\nanybody and so what I would force myself\nto do is I would I would figure out the\nfirst you know what the sentence was\ngoing to be this is not not just around\ngirls but this around everybody right I\nwould figure out the first sentence and\nthe first word of what I was going to\nsay would be and I would go 3 2 1 and I\nwould say the word and if I said the\nword I'm GNA look really weird if I\ndon't finish the sentence so then I just\nhad to finish the sentence there's still\nsometimes that I do this if I have to\nhave a real tough conversation with a\nfriend or employee or my wife I'll I'll\nliterally go through the 321 process and\nthen force myself to say it because then\nI'm just I've just jumped in I'm in the\nend I'm not dipping my toes in I'm in I\ndon't know if I should say this I don't\nknow if I should say this do it 3 2 1 go\nand I should literally make myself say\nthe word now we we're in the\nconversation we've got to do it and um\nit's ingrained into us by a lot of us by\nour parents counting down three two oh\nyou don't want to know what's going to\nhappen when I get to zero and you're\nlike I don't and you just do whatever is\nyou're supposed to do it also with the\ncountdown doesn't allow us to just sit\naround and think it's just countdown go\nand so the question I have for you on\nthis one that you can Journal through is\nhow can I incorporate countdown into\naction how can I incorporate the\ncountdown action in there okay number\nsix this is something that I used to do\nwith every one of my clients that I\nworked with ask yourself how can I make\nthis easier um the one thing that we\nwould do is at the end of every one of\nmy one-on-one coaching calls that I had\nwith with people we'd have assignments\nand we'd have goals that they wanted to\nwork on before we talk next week and um\nwhen you look at life and success and\nhappiness all of those things are not\ndifficult we make them way more\ndifficult and so what I wanted to have\nmy clients do is they would come up with\ntheir assignments we'd figure out what\nthey want to work on we'd mutually agree\non it and then would say how can you\nmake it easier on yourself to do\nXYZ so instead of just saying here's the\nthing it's like humans naturally want to\nfind the easy route can I find the easy\nroute to taking the action that's\nnecessary if you can make everything\neasier why not make it a little bit\neasier to take action and so I want you\nto look at the stuff that you need to do\nand what actions you need to take and\nsay like how can I make this easier on\nmyself how can I design my environment\nhow can I make this easier how can I do\nall of this so the question I have for\nyou on this one to journal through is\nhow can I make my actions easier how can\nI make whatever is you're working\ntowards how can I make uh building this\nbusiness easier how can I make getting\nmyself to the gym easier right and then\nthe seventh one is to get an\naccountability partner and you've heard\nme explain this many times I also said\nthis inside of my book as well where I\ntalk about getting an accountability\npartner a lot of times and for years\nthis is what I thought an accountability\npartner has to be somebody who you know\nif you say you're going to the gym five\ntimes a week they need to be the person\nthat goes to the gym with you five times\na week and also has the same goals as\nyou if you can find that that's great\nand I definitely recommend having that\ntype of person but you can also have\nbecause I have had a a lot of people\nover years say oh well I don't have any\nsupportive friends my friends don't want\nthe same things that I do what do I do I\nsay find your most annoying friend and\nif your your goal is to go to the gym\nfive times a week just call them up they\ndon't have to be in shape they don't\nhave to have ever gone to a gym before\nthey don't have to have any want to go\nto a gym but you say hey my goal is to\ngo to the gym five times a week and I'm\ngoing to send you a selfie at the gym\nevery single time if I ever miss a day\nfive days out of seven days if I ever\nmiss a you know and only go four times\nthen every time that I don't send you a\nphoto I have to send you $100 I'm going\nto send it through venmo zel cash app\nwhatever is use I'm going to send it to\nyou if that's your most annoying friend\nthey are going to be on your ass asking\nyou about hey did you go to the gym this\nweek how many times did you go to gym I\nonly got four photos I supposed to get\nfive it's Sunday now and so you can get\nan accountability part it's just\nsomebody's constantly checking on you\nthey don't have to have the exact same\ngoals as you if you can find someone who\nhas the same goals as you and you can\nalso find another one that's your most\nannoying friend you're not going to want\nto pay your most annoying friend $100\nand once you do have to do it one time\nyou're like no way I'm not doing that\nagain and so get an accountability\npartner that can help support you and so\nthe the question I have for you on this\none is who can I use as my\naccountability partner and how often\nwill we talk what's the agreement\nbetween us and so when you look at these\nquestions I'll go through the questions\none more time so you can write them down\nif you missed them Journal through these\nquestions and see how you can build this\ninto your life so where are you not\ntaking action where you should\nbe what opportunities should you be\nfocusing on what are the small things\nthat I need to master every single day\nwhat in my environment do I need to\nchange in order to make taking action\neasier on myself what is a five minute\nmovement that I can get do to get my\nenergy flowing how can I incorporate the\ncountdown action and then who can I use\nmy as my account accountability partner\nand how often will we talk you have to\nunderstand that that the discipline is\nsomething that you build within yourself\nand these are just seven different tips\nseven different ways to help you build\nmore discipline within yourself so\nthat's all I got for you for this\nepisode if you love this podcast I have\na announcement you're absolutely going\nto love something I'm about to launch\ncalled mindset Mentor plus um
