    "transcript": "how do you attract the perfect partner\nright people always ask this question\nbut I think the question is inherently\nflawed the real question should be how\ncan I build myself right now into the\nbest partner that I can be see here's\nthe reason why when you are the best\npartner that you can be when you're\nsingle you can then attract the best\npossible person that aligns with the\nperson that you have become see cuz so\nmany people are looking out into the\nworld for the perfect partner but that's\nnot the right way to do it looking\ninside and becoming the best partner\nthat you can become will make you more\nlikely to attract the person who is the\nbest partner for you so the secret with\nthis is that you must become in order to\nattract"
