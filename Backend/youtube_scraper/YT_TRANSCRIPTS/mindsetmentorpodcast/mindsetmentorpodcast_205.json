    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you three techniques to get\nmore done in less time let's dive in\ntoday I'm going to be teaching you how\nto be more productive how to get more\ndone in less time and uh how to stop\nbeing such a busy bee I guess you could\nsay um you know I've I've worked with a\nlot of people over time and I have this\nday that kind of pops up and is is told\nto me all of the time and you've\nprobably felt this way before which is\nhey I worked so much but I don't feel\nlike I'm getting anything done you ever\nhad one of those days where you're just\nworking working working and you're\nslaving away and you're doing something\nat the end of the day you're like man\nI'm exhausted but I don't feel like I\ndid\nanything if so you are probably being\nbusy and not being productive so there's\na massive difference between busy and\nproductive busy is just doing things\nprodu like being productive productivity\nis Conquering the most important things\nand um let's be real you waste a lot of\ntime don't you like we all do it's funny\nbecause I'll talk with people and\nthey're like I'm so busy I'm so busy I'm\nso busy I'm like show me your calendar\nand they're like well I don't really\nkeep a calendar I kind of have like a\nlittle bit here most people that I have\nfound are absolutely terrible with time\nmanagement so it's not that they don't\nhave enough time it's usually that\nyou're not not really good at managing\ntheir time um we all want a perfect life\nwe all want to make money and travel the\nworld and have fun and buy some cool\nthings and you know donate a bunch of\nmoney to the world and have great\nrelationships we all want a perfect life\nbut what's really interesting about\nbeing a human is that you only get 24\nhours every single day you and every\nsingle person on this Earth gets 24\nhours that will never change you cannot\ncontrol time the only thing that we can\nchange is how productive we are when we\nwant to get something done now this is\nnot an episode about hustle culture and\nwork your ass off all day long I used to\nbe that person and I'm telling you don't\nbe that person learn from my mistakes\nthat's not how you get to success let me\nsay that again you can get to success\nbut you're going to hate your life on\nthe way over there and so what I\nrecommend is like having a time where\nyou click on to be productive to get\nstuff done whether that's your business\nwhether that's work whether that's you\nknow helping the children get something\ndone with their schoolwork whatever it\nmight be when you click in you're in\nthere is nothing else that you're doing\nwhen you click out you're out you're not\nthinking about it you're not going back\ninto it so today we're going to dive\ninto how to get a lot more done in less\ntime because when you look at the\naverage person that works an 8 hour day\nthey only usually get about two to maybe\nthree hours of productivity done which\nmeans that they're wasting time or\ntrying to multitask or trying to do a\nwhole bunch of other things for five\nhours out of the day and so we're going\nto talk about some stuff about how to\nget more done based in Psychology based\nin studies to teach you what has\nactually been proven to work and um and\nI'm going to teach you these different\ntechniques to kind of help you uh do\nmore and less time the first one the the\none that a lot of people don't know\nabout you've probably heard about it is\nsomething called the 8020 rule the parto\nprinciple and so you have to understand\nour brain um is a very energy consuming\norganism or organ is what it is your\nbrain consumes more energy per pound\nthan any other organ in your entire body\nright now digestion takes more energy\nthroughout the day but as far as the\nactual brain itself and for how big it\nis it actually takes the most amount of\nenergy and so what I think about is how\ncan I use every bit of energy to be as\nproductive as possible when I'm trying\nto be productive because our brain has\nlimited capacity to process information\nwe have limited energy throughout the\nentire day how can I bring as much of my\nbrain power to what matters most and so\nthe way to kind of really think about\nthat is to to realize what am I\ndedicating my time to in the 8020 rule\nthe parto principle is basically this um\n80% of the results that you get in your\nlife this could be your business this\ncould be the company that you work for\nthis could be your clients in the\nrevenue that comes in your relationships\ncome from 20% of your actions so like\nfor instance if I have run a business\nwhich I do and I help a lot of people\nwho do run businesses right if I run a\nbusiness there are a million things I\ncould be doing every single day but 20%\nof those actions are the most important\nactions 20% will usually give me 80% of\nthe results they might even give me 90%\nof the results but 20% and you know it\ndoesn't have to add up to 100 because\nI'm talking about 20% of my actions and\nwhich is actions on the other side I'm\ntalking about results 20% of your\nactions that you do on a daily basis in\nyour business are the most important\nthings you should be doing so if you're\na CEO and you've got employees you\nshould find a way to delegate\neverything except for those 20% of your\nactions if you are a\nsalesperson usually your commissions and\nyou look at your commissions throughout\nthe entire year usually 20% of the\nclients are the majority of your\ncommissions if you're in relationship\n20% of the things that you do are going\nto bring the majority of the connection\nthe happiness The Joy between you as\nwell and so what we want to do by\nlooking at this is we want to identify\nand concentrate on the tasks that are\ngoing to give us the most significant\nresults it's crazy to me when I work\nwith business owners how much time they\nwaste doing stuff that does not matter\nbecause they either are afraid of taking\nthe big action because the big action\ncould yield some failure and that would\nmake them feel bad about themselves or\nbecause they have problems de\ndelegating this happens all the time and\nso when you're focusing on the most\ncritical task you what you want to do is\nyou want to minimize as many\ndistractions you can so that you can\nreally like optimize your cognitive\nresources and be in it as Cal Newport\nsays you want to be able to do deep work\non those things and you really want to\nstart putting a whole lot of deep work\ninto that and so the the thing that I've\nshared which is a very simple thing that\nI recommend that everybody does every\nsingle morning is you make a to-do list\nevery single morning if you're a\nbusiness owner if you're a mother if\nyou're a father if you are somebody who\nis a high school athlete whatever it\nmight be that you're doing if you're a\ncollege student write down all of your\nto-do\nlist and then what I want you to do to\nmake it very simple because you cannot\nget you probably won't get your entire\nto-do list done today is you find and\nyou Circle the three most important\ntasks this is what I do every single\nmorning when I'm meet with my team\nis with my energy I want to put all of\nmy energy or the majority of my energy\ninto the biggest I call it I always tell\nmy team the biggest levers that I can\npull what is the biggest lever that I\ncan pull right now I could be working\nuntil midnight 1:00 a.m. every single\nday but I don't and so with the time\nthat I have if I'm going to get done at\n5 six o'clock what's the biggest lever\nthat I can pull right now that can make\nthe biggest impact in the business so\nyou make your to-do list and you Circle\nthe most important the three most\nimportant tasks\nthen you get a 3x5 card an index card\nand you write down number one and you\nrank them number one number two and\nnumber three just work on number one\ndon't do anything else except for number\none this this helps you identify the\nbiggest needle moving lever pulling task\nthat you could possibly do for today and\nwhat you want to do is you want to just\nwrite all of them down the three things\nand if you if you don't do anything else\nexcept for get number one done it's a\npretty damn productive day if you get\nnumber two done as well and number three\ndone as well you had a really great day\nbut all of the other things you can\neither delegate you can eliminate or you\ncan do another time that's it you\ndelegate them you eliminate them or you\ncan do another time and that's really\nwhat it comes down to is identifying\nwhat are the most important tasks that I\ncould be doing so that's the first thing\nis the 8020 R the parto principle the\nnext thing that I recommend people do is\nto batch batch as much as you possibly\ncan when you're doing stuff and so for\nme like I'm creating content today today\nis one of my content creation days and\nso I woke up in the morning and I did\nyou know I checked in with my team after\n10 o'clock because in the morning is\nwhen I am the most creative for me and\nso I looked back and I was like okay I\nknow I need to plan episodes today I\nneed to record episodes today and so\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\nlook through all of my ideas I have this\nmassive list of ideas that I've been\nputting together over years and years of\nrecording on this podcast and I just see\nwhich one hits home with me this morning\nand then I find the one and then what I\ndo is I start writing them all out I\nstart putting bullet points and and\nstarting to make a flow of the podcast\nand I'll do two episodes in the morning\nmorning late afternoon-ish uh late\nexcuse me late morning as well and then\nI come to the studio and I record two or\nthree podcast episodes whenever I come\nto the studio when I first had the\npodcast this is not even me lying and\nthe podcast used to come out only three\ntimes a week I used to record the\nepisode the night before sometimes\nmajority of the time I record oh my God\nI got to put an episode out tomorrow\nwhat should I talk about I just play out\nreal quick and I put it up it's way\neasier to to plan and and record and to\nbatch them I'm in the flow of writing\nI'm in the flow of writing I'm going to\ngo ahead and get them done I'm in the\nthe flow of recording I'm going to go\nahead and get them done so like\nyesterday I planned planned two episodes\nI recorded two episodes and then I\nplanned six reels for Instagram and then\nrecorded six reels for Instagram so that\nover a few hours I'm doing the biggest\nneedle moving thing that I can do uh and\nthat is you know have more people aware\nof the brand more people aware of the\nbusiness and so what can you do to batch\nwhat it is that you do you know instead\nof saying oh I'm going to do an email\nhere and then 20 minutes later I'm going\nto check my email here I think the\naverage person I saw a study that says\nthey check their email 32 times a day\nholy that's crazy what if you just\nchecked your email in the morning and\nyou got emails done and then you didn't\nlook at them again until 4:00 and then\nyou got emails done from 4 to 5: right\nlike how can you learn to start batching\nthings that you're doing often and then\nwhat you do is you look at your schedule\nand you schedule and batch the most\nimportant tasks and I do this every\nevery single Wednesday and Thursday I\nrecord and then sometimes Wednesday\nThursday and today is Friday three days\nin a row plan record plan record because\nI'm trying to get ahead because if you\nlisten episode two or three episodes ago\nmy wife is pregnant so I'm going to take\nsome time off from recording so I'm\nactually trying to get ahead so that I\ncould take some time off for recording\nonce the baby comes so that's the next\nthing is to batch so 8020 princip which\nis called the parto principal there's\nbatching and then the last one is you if\nyou've been listening to podcast for a\nwhile I love getting messages from you\nguys saying that you never did this\nbefore you started doing it and it\ncompletely changed your productivity\nbecause it completely changed my\nproductivity as well it is called the\npomodora technique I have an entire\nepisode on it if you want to go back and\nlisten to the pomodora technique but\nreally what it comes down to is it is is\nimpossible for a human to multitask\nthere are many studies that show that\nmultitasking is just single tasking and\nyou're switching between two things at\none time when you switch there is a um\nlittle bit of a delay in time it could\nbe up to 15 minutes for you to get your\nbrain into like fully be in that thing\nand so multitasking they showed it it\nmakes people Dumber it also makes the\nquality of your work worse Google it\njust check is is multi multitasking good\nor bad um but you know there was a study\njust to kind of give you an idea that\nwas done at Stanford that found out that\nheavy multitaskers performed worse on\ntasks that required attention and memory\nthan those that were focused at one task\nat a time and so the research you know\nreally supports the idea that\nprioritizing your high impact tasks and\navoiding multitasking makes you more\nproductive and so with the pomidor\ntechnique is you you basically identify\none thing that needs to be done and you\nshut out the rest of the world you put\non your headphones you put your phone in\nanother room so that you don't\naccidentally go for it you turn off all\nof your notifications on your computer\nyou put a sign on the door that says\ndon't bother me because I'm getting\ndone and literally you take 25 minutes\nand you put 25 minutes I wrote about\nthis in my book level up of how to do\nthe pomodora technique and how to do\nwhat I call pomodora plus which is a\nwhole other technique that I've kind of\nkind of built over years and so you do\nthe pomodora technique it's 25 minutes\non 5 minutes off and in those 25 minutes\nyou only do one thing and you bring 100%\nof your brain power and that's like as\nCal Newport would say that's where you\nactually put in the Deep work and so you\nput in deep work for 25 minutes now if\nyou if you get done at those 25 minutes\nyou can go to your next task but if you\ndon't get done you just go back to that\ntask again until that task is done and\nso it's 25 minutes on 5 minutes off\nbecause in those 5 minutes you need to\ngive your your brain a full rest when I\nsay full rest that means you don't look\nat your phone you don't you don't do\nmuch you can go outside you can go for a\nwalk for 5 minutes or you could just sit\nat your desk close your eyes and breathe\nfor five minutes you're giving your\nbrain a rest it's like lifting really\nheavy weight you got to take a rest for\na few minutes and then you go back into\nlifting really heavy weights and the\npomodora technique will absolutely\nchange your life and your productivity\nis so damn simple but it works so well\none thing one thing only 100% of your\nbrain power to this one thing and so if\nyou really start to think about it if\nyou can figure out a way to start using\nthe 8020 rule to identify the biggest\ntasks that need to be done today that\nwill be the most productive things that\nyou could do you batch out the things\nthat can all be done like oh I need to\nrecord three episodes four episodes this\nweek well I can just get all of those\ndone in one day or two days you batch\nthem but then when you sit down to work\nit needs to be I have an entire chapter\nin this my book you can read about it\nand level up but it needs to become a\nritual it needs to become a thing where\nit's h instead of like a I got to\nget sit here and get work done it's like\nit's a ritual not a habit habits or\nhabits you know routines or routines but\na ritual like feels important it is\nimportant that I bring 100% of my brain\npower to this task you will get more\ndone and you will be light years ahead\nof other people years down the road\nbecause most people as I said only get 2\nhours of productivity done maybe 3 hours\nof productivity if you can get 5 hours\ndone you're light years ahead of people\nin a year and you're in a completely\ndifferent Universe five years down the\nroad and so what's most important is to\nstop being busy start being productive\nand to start focusing on the needle\nmoving tasks and getting those crossed\noff your list every single day and then\nbringing 100% of your brain power when\nyou're doing those things to bring the\nbest of yourself and everything that you\ndo so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share on
