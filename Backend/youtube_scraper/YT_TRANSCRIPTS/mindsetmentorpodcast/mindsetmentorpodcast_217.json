    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be talking about how to set yourself\nfree how to not feel like your mind is\nin control how to not be offended by\nother people's words and opinions all of\nthat we're going to talk about Freedom\ntoday let's dive in I'm going to talk\nabout how to not be triggered by other\npeople other people's opinions other\npeople's words any of that stuff now let\nme take a step back before you dive into\nit when you look at words the\ninteresting thing about words is this\nit's kind of a paradox words can have so\nmuch\npower but words can also have absolutely\nno\npower and you know somebody could come\nup to you and call you a name and it\ncould completely set you\noff they called me this thing and it set\nme\noff a a person could come up to you and\nsay something else and it doesn't set\nyou off and then they go say the exact\nsame thing to somebody else and it sets\nthem off a person interestingly enough\ncould come and say the same thing to you\nthat sets you off but in a different\nlanguage and it would have no power over\nyou would it would do nothing to you and\nso really what it comes down to is is it\nthe\nwords is it the other person or is it\nme think about that for a second I get\nmessages all of the time on Instagram\nand one of the the the one of the ones\nthat I get the most is how can I not let\nothers ruin my mindset how can I stop\ncaring about other people's opinions how\ncan I not worry about what other people\nare going to think of me how can I not\nlet somebody ruin my mindset think about\nthat for a second does the other person\nactually ruin your mindset no the other\nperson does not ruin your mindset you\nruined your mindset what that person\nsaid to you didn't ruin your day what\nyou\ndeed is what ruined your day what you\nthink about the other what the other\nperson said to you is what ruined your\nday the story that you have built up in\nyour head about what the other person\nsaid to you has ruined your day if the\nperson who came up to you and said\nsomething completely different in\ndifferent language the exact same thing\nin different language you would have no\nreaction so it's not the words it's what\nyou think of the words and this is\nincredibly important because words can\nonly hurt you to the degree in which you\nalready believe them\nand so like for instance I'll give you a\ncouple of examples one of the things you\nknow we're at over ton of of episodes\nover 1400 1500 episodes of this podcast\nso far right and when you look at it the\nfirst about 650 episodes I didn't cuss\nat all and then I realized that that\nwasn't actually me like I love to cuss I\ndon't see anything wrong with it at all\nnow was I raised to think that there was\nsomething wrong with cussing absolutely\nI was raised to think that something was\nwrong with cussing it was bad to say\ncertain words and then I grew up and I\nrealized that I was just trained to\nbelieve something I was trained to\nbelieve a set of beliefs and patterns\nand I took a step back and I was like is\nthat actually what I believe do I really\nthink that a word is quote unquote bad\nno words only hurt to the degree of what\nyou already believe them like I'm not\ngoing to go cuss at somebody directly in\ntheir face I'm not going to do that but\nif I'm not speaking to my full\nexpression what am I doing I'm holding\nmyself back in some sort of way and so I\nget messages it just happens all the\ntime hey Rob I love your message but it\ncould you stop cussing no because what\nyou're asking me to do is change myself\nso that therefore it doesn't offend you\nright and it's very important for you to\nunderstand like are you changing\nyourself for other people are you not\nbeing true to yourself for other people\nam I going to lose followers because of\nit sure less listeners sure but I'm I'm\nokay because of the fact that I'm being\nmy full true authentic self\nand so you know if you're out there and\nyou're like I don't like cussing the\nfirst question to ask yourself is\nwhy and then the next question I ask\nyourself is where did I learn it and\nthen you start to realize as you and the\nthe thing I really want you to to to\nstart to get from this podcast is to be\nvery curious as to why you are the way\nthat you are why you believe what you\nbelieve is that actually your full-on\nbelief or is that a belief that was\ngiven to you and it was somebody else's\nbelief that you just took on right just\nsomething to think about and and just be\nvery curious as to why you are the way\nthat you are cuz I used to not cuss cuz\nI thought there was something wrong with\nit I thought it was bad and I started\nthinking to myself is it true that this\nis bad or is it that somebody else that\nwas probably no smarter than you and I\ndecided one day this is bad people can't\nsay this now when you start to think\nabout that you really start to kind of\ntake a step back and be like well damn\nif I if I think about that if words can\nonly hurt to the degree that which you\nalready believe them if if somebody says\na cuss word and you believe that it's\nbad well then you are giving up all of\nyour sovereignty as a human being to not\nfeel to maybe get mad or to get\nemotional about what somebody said\nyou're giving up all of your sovereignty\nas a completely Sovereign being to what\nsomebody else\nsays and this really started hitting\nhome for me I've given this example many\ntimes in the podcast but it really the\nreason why I've given it so many times\nbecause it really clicked for me at this\npoint I have a friend Ryan and he was\ntalking at an event probably seven eight\nyears ago and he was talking about his\nbusiness and he was talking about he was\nin his 20s his business was doing\nmillions of dollars a year he was\nincredibly successful from the outside\nlooking in and um he was on a walk with\nhis mentor and his mentor was like man\nbusiness is going so well how do you\nfeel and he's like I don't know man I'm\njust not liking it anymore he's like\nwhat do you mean he's like every time I\nget a a a message from a customer\nservice message saying your product\nsucks you suck whatever it might be he's\nlike I just want to shut it all down and\nhis mentor said yeah it's because you're\ninsecure and he's like what do you\nmean he's like you're insecure he's like\nif somebody walked up to you right now A\nlady walked up to you and she said hey\nyou have pink hair what would you think\nhe's like I think that'd be crazy and he\nsaid why he said because I don't have\npink hair he said so when somebody says\nsomething to you that you don't believe\nit doesn't offend you right he's like no\nhe goes but if somebody says something\nto you that you do believe it offends\nyou and brings up your insecurities so\nmaybe you do feel like your product is\nin inferior maybe you do feel like\nyou're inferior and maybe when somebody\nsays that to you it brings up that\ninsecurity of being inferior not being\ngood enough or not being smart enough or\nnot being accepted you know if someone\ncomes up to you and they call you fat\nwhat would you think he's like I would\nlaugh because I don't view myself as fat\nhe's like yeah but if somebody else gets\nhighly offended by it it's because they\nare probably already believing those\nwords about themselves and this right\nhere is is the definition of being\ntriggered and I've said it over and over\nand over and over and over again but\nbeing triggered is a\ngift it doesn't feel good in the moment\nyou want to go up to that person and\nsmack the hell out of them but if\nsomebody triggers you they are showing\nyou where you are not free so instead of\nslapping the hell out of them they\nactually deserve a high five they\ndeserve a hug because that person is\nshowing you where you are not free where\nyou are stuck at some place in time with\nsome belief that's probably not serving\nyou you know so going back to to the\nwhole thing of of talking about Ryan and\nhim feeling like he was inferior and his\nproduct being inferior he was being\ntriggered at that moment because he felt\nlike he wasn't good enough like he\ndidn't deserve to be at the place that\nhe was at and because he didn't feel\nlike he deserve to be at the place that\nhe is at he was he was unconsciously\nfinding all the places to prove that he\nwas not worthy of that when you're\ntriggered they are showing you a place\nwhere you are stuck in your own head\nwhere you're stuck in time where you're\nstuck in the past they are showing you\nuh they're they're showing you a place\nwhere you have been given up giving up\nyour sovereignty in some sort of way\nbecause words are just words that's it\nthey can have so much meaning or they\ncan have no meaning and when they have\nso much meaning like I love you what's\nmy belief around love that's a great\nthing that I feel that way but if\nsomeone says I hate you and I really\nstart to\nfeel not to feel not feel good enough\nand not feel accepted and retriggers me\nin some sort of way it's relating back\nto some place in your childhood where\nyou probably are still stuck there and\nit's something that you need to work\nthrough and so what you would do is take\na step back and be like why am I\ntriggered by this thing why do I feel\nthis way where did I learned this where\ndid it come from and a lot of times what\nyou're going to realize that you are a\nset of patterns and beliefs that you\nlearned from other\npeople and sometimes you need to take a\nstep back and say do I still want to be\nthat way you know there are great Parts\nabout you maybe the things that you love\nfrom your parents and the love that you\ngive and the accepting and such a good\nperson all of those things exist and you\nlearn a lot of great stuff from your\nparents and from your childhood but\nthere are some things that we pick up\nalong the way that are no longer serving\nus and if we're triggered by somebody we\nare not free in that moment and and\nprobably my favorite quote one of my top\nthree favorite quotes um is El Elanor\nRoosevelt and and I've said this over\nand over and over again on the podcast\nis she says no one could make you feel\ninferior without your\nconsent nobody can make you feel\ninferior without your consent so you\ncould be mad because somebody said\nsomething to you but you're consenting\nto being mad and you know Victor Frankle\nwho went through probably one of the\nworst of the worst of of human\nexperiences uh he was a a psychologist\nthat went through aitz in Nazi prison\ncamps said uh in one of his books is one\nof his most famous quotes is between\nstimulus and response there is a space\nand in that space is our power to choose\nour response to choose our response he\nsays and in our response lies our growth\nand our freedom so between stimulus and\nresponse between somebody saying\nsomething to you and you reacting\nthere's a space it might be a\nmillisecond but in that space you have\nthe power to choose what your response\nis going to be are you going to be\noffended are you going to be mad are you\ngoing to be sad or are you going to\nchoose something different and in our\nresponse lies our growth and lies our\nfreedom so what are they what are both\nof those quotes showing you that you are\nthe gatekeeper to your\nfreedom you are the one that's in\ncontrol of how you feel and it's never\nwhat happened to you it's always how\nyou're perceiving what happened to you\nand when you can really start to\nunderstand that you really start to\nunderstand the importance of working on\nyourself working on your mindset working\non your the ways that you're triggered\nworking on your your nervous system\nworking on your presence all of\nthat you cannot give your control away\nto someone\nelse and based off what they do or what\nthey\nsay you can't you can't give it away\nthey're not in control you're deciding\nto give it away oh yeah go ahead and\ntake it go you know you said this thing\nto me I'm going to go ahead and I'm\ngoing to just decide you can yeah piss\nme off it's okay right another thing\nthat that Victor Frankle says that I\nthat I really love is he says everything\ncan be taken from a man but one thing\nthe last of human freedoms and that\nhuman freedom is to choose one's\nattitude in any given set of\ncircumstances to choose one's own way\nand so this is a man once again went\nthrough Nazi prison PR uh Nazi prison\ncamps and he says the quote everything\ncan be taken from a man but one thing\nthe last of all human freedoms which is\nthe ability to choose one's attitude in\na given set of circumstances to choose\none's own way so we have to choose how\ndo we want to be for me I used to not be\nsuper short-tempered but I used to get\npissed off pretty easily and now it's\njust like I've I've worked on that I\nwould notice the feeling start to Bubble\nUp inside of my body of like oh here's\nthe feeling of getting pissed off and\ninstead of going through and following\nthrough on what I used to do it was I'm\nfeeling this feeling I'm aware of this\npattern that I want to interrupt I need\nto do something different so what did it\nturned to it turned into breath work it\nturned into calming myself down deep\nbreaths I'm not going to allow this to\npiss me\noff I'm going to be the one that's in\ncontrol I'm going to be the one that's\nin control of how I feel but once again\nthe words only hurt to the degree that\nwe already believe them and so that\nperson is showing me I I\nI like to view everything like this\nentire life that we're living as a game\nit's just the game of life and if I am\nthe player of the game then the universe\nin my belief is always coming to me with\nnew challenges to to help me grow and\nhelp me improve and so when I look at\nsomeone who pissed me off or is in the\nprocess of about to piss me off I can\nlook at it and I can\nsay okay\nthank you Universe for coming through\nthis person to me to show me where I'm\nnot free and how I need to improve let\nme choose how I actually want to react\nin this moment and we get to choose our\nreactions in every single moment I\nrecently if if you haven't been\nfollowing me my Facebook got hacked and\nwe lost over a 100 I lost over 300,000\nfollowers in a 5-day period because the\nperson who hacked my Facebook was\nposting inappropriate stuff on my\nFacebook Stories and people started\nunfollowing me now if this was Rob 7\nyears ago I would have been\nlivid because I would have just thought\nabout you know this person is doing this\nto me all of this stuff and I started\nnoticing hey this this is this is\nbubbling up the anger is bubbling up how\ndo I want to react in this I'm going to\ndo everything I can to try to get it\nback and we did get it back but I'm\ngoing to do everything that I can to try\nto get it back but I am going to be in\ncontrol of how I feel and how I act and\nhow I react In This Moment am I going to\nreact the best version of myself for\nmyself for my team for everybody if I'm\njust livid throughout the entire thing\nno of course\nnot do I know that when emotions are\nhigh logic is low yes I do know that so\nif I'm livid am I going to make the best\ndecisions no of course not but if I can\nsit there and I can allow and I'm not\nsaying just ignore your feelings I'm not\nsaying that but allow my body to process\nthose feelings to breathe it out to move\nit if I got to move my body shake it do\nsome push-ups whatever it is go for a\nrun to get those that energy out I'm\ngoing to then choose how I want to react\nso we need to understand that we are the\nones that are completely in control of\nhow we feel at every single moment and\nwe need to be there to be the person\nwho's consciously there sitting and\nthinking and we need to release our\nattachments to those triggers because we\ndo want to be free you're listen this\npodcast because you do want to be free\nall humans want more want freedom more\nthan anything else freedom in their\nreality freedom in their external\nreality but also more than anything else\nFreedom within their internal reality\nwhich I don't think a lot of people\nthink of you know try to tell a\n2-year-old that they can't do something\nhow does that work out all they want is\nto be free to do what they want to do we\nall want that it's built into us we\nthink we want money and sure you can\nhave money but what we want is the\nfreedom that we think comes from having\nmoney but more than anything else what\nwe really truly want and what I think we\ndesire is freedom in our own minds\nthat's why you're here that's why you're\nlistening to to this you want freedom in\nyour own mind so the next time that you\nfind yourself triggered you find the the\nfeelings of whether it's whether it's\nRage or whether it's sadness or whether\nit's just just anxiety whatever it is\nstarting to flood into your body take a\nstep\nback breathe for a few seconds and then\ntake a pen and paper out and put your\nthoughts down on a piece of paper why am\nI triggered right now where did I learn\nthis from what's the story going on in\nmy my head a lot of times we get\ntriggered and we build an entire story\naround it which could be true it could\nbe false but most of the time it's false\nand then what you're doing is you're\nstarting to build awareness within\nyourself versus allowing yourself to go\ndown a\na a old set of patterns that you\nprobably want to let go of\nso going back to what I originally said\nwords have so much power they do but\nthey also have no power and you're the\none that's in control of what you give\npower to and what you don't give power\nto nobody can make you feel inferior\nwithout your consent and so I want you\nto understand this is your next level to\nmaster in some sort of way to try to get\nbetter at to try to improve because you\nare the one who's in control of the ship\nso try not to be triggered and when you\nare triggered thank that person in your\nhead thank the universe for saying hey\nthank you for showing me where I'm not\nfree 104 I'm going to work on this so\nthat's what I got for you
