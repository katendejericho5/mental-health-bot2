    "transcript": "so this is the best secret I can give\nyou to have a better memory so there was\na study done back in 2014 and\nresearchers found that the students who\ntook notes by hand performed better on\nconceptual questions compared to those\nwho took notes with their laptops the\nresearchers also found that the\nhandwriting group had better recall and\ncomprehension than that laptop group so\nwhat it shows is that the physical act\nof writing something down by hand helps\nwith memory retention and the\nresearchers also propos that this may be\ndue to the fact that handwriting\nrequires more mental processing as the\nstudents needed to selectively condense\ninformation rather than just typing\neverything out verbatim so if you want\nto have a better memory just start to\nwrite stuff down"
