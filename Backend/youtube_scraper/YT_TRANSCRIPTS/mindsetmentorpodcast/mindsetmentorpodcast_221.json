    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto take you behind the scenes of my life\nand I'm going to tell you what I am\nworking on right now in order to grow\nand improve myself and going to give you\na massive Life update in myself as well\nlet's dive in um I wanted to give you\nall a life update of what's going on in\nmy life but also personally what I have\nbeen focusing on for the past 6 months\nor so to really see as the the next\nMountain that I'm going to be climbing\nuh to try to grow and try to improve and\ntry to get better um it's it's\ninteresting because obviously I have a\npodcast and I have people who listen to\nit it's interesting how many people\nthink that I'm like this human that has\nno problems that I'm different than\neverybody else and I must have conquered\nall of my uh things and my superstitions\nand my traumas and all of that I just\nwant to tell you guys and I I hope you\ncompletely understand it every time I\ntalk I'm just a normal human I'm always\nworking on myself I'm not perfect I\ndon't intend on ever being perfect ever\nI never think that this this\nself-development thing that we're on\nthis journey will ever end I think that\nthat it's a journey that goes until the\nday we die and I'm always finding uh new\nthings to work on when I find one thing\nthat I feel like I've got a pretty big\ngood grasp on that I've been working on\nit's always like something else pops up\nin my life and uh that is the Journey of\nlife and so with me what I'm currently\nworking on right now I kind of wanted\ninstead of this to be a\ninstructional uh podcast like a lot of\nthe other ones are I want to kind of\ngive you an idea of what I'm working on\nin my viewpoint on a lot of things uh\nwith changes in my life of things that\nhave happened recently so if you follow\nme on Instagram uh you probably already\nknow this if you don't follow me on\nInstagram you probably don't know this\nand I'm about to tell you something that\nmight blow your mind uh my wife is\npregnant it's going to be our first kid\nand so if you want to see more behind\nthe scenes and how that's going and how\nI'm uh dealing with all that uh you can\nfollow me on Instagram it's Rob dial Jr\nr o b d i a l Jr um it's a boy it's our\nfirst kid ever and uh she is Cur ly at\nthe moment of this recording due in 28\ndays um I am super excited about it I've\nnever been as excited about anything in\nmy entire life uh I am ready to be\nchallenged I'm ready to be humbled I'm\nready to learn uh I ready to try not to\n up as much as I possibly can but\nreally I'm just ultimately ready to pass\nalong uh the best that I can to a\nanother little tiny human and I see it\nas like the culmination of all of these\n19 years of work on myself and in 9\nyears of this podcast and coaching\npeople for a long time it's kind of the\nculmination of like now I get to\nactually see if I can help somebody\nwho's growing from a tiny baby to an\nadult uh and if any of this stuff\nactually works with them as well and so\num for me the thing I've been working on\nthe most is this I know that trauma gets\npassed along in families until someone\nhas the strength to feel it uh I know\nthat and uh for for me look looking at\nat my family stuff from my father stuff\nfrom my mother stuff from everyone that\nI've that I've come in contact with but\nyou know for me when I look at just my\nfather for instance which you know he\nwas an alcoholic his father was an\nalcoholic and um my father's father\nended up killing himself uh because of\nall the pain that he was in and my\nfather saw that my father became an\nalcoholic because he never really fully\novercame his demons that he had from his\nfather and so for me since I was a a a a\nchild I and probably about 15 after my\nfather passed away I saw the lineage of\nhow all of this was working and I was\nlike I know I'm not going to pass this\non to my kids and I'm going to do\neverything that I can to not pass this\non to my kids and so what I really\ndecided uh a long time ago is I'm going\nto start to look at all of my things and\nI'm going to work at them I'm going to\nlook at them headon and I'm going to\nwork with it and um I made a commitment\nyears and years and years ago um that my\nP and my family's past and my family's\ntraumas would not become my children's\nand it's a it's a really important thing\nfor us all to understand for anybody\nelse that's out there uh whether you\ndecide to have children or not but\nespecially if you decide to have\nchildren the quote that I said a minute\nago which is uh trauma gets passed along\nin families until somebody has the\nstrength to feel it if you don't want to\npass along your traumas to your children\nthen you're going to have to be the one\nthat has the strength to feel it and it\ngoes back to the quote another quote\nwhich is uh the cave that you're afraid\nto enter holds the treasure that you\nseek so there's all caves that we all\nafraid to enter um but really that's\nthat's the that's that is what we want\nin life is inside of overcoming whatever\nit is that we're afraid of entering and\nso you know way back in the\nself-development journey I just decided\nI'm going to do it I'm going to I'm\ngoing to go and I'm going to face these\nthings head on and I think every parent\nshould think and really plan out who\nthey want their children to be and you\nknow there's there's definitely you know\neducation we want to educate children\nand have them become the smartest they\ncould possibly be but but besides that\nthere's also values uh that they want\ntheir children to have and I don't think\nmany people sit down with a pen and\npaper and ask thems what values do I\nwant my children to have how do I want\nthem to speak to other people how do I\nwant them to speak to thems how do I\nwant them to interact with the world\nwhat do I want them to think about the\nworld do I want them to think that the\nworld is a scary place and that you know\nuh they need to to watch out and they\nneed to be fearful of other people or do\nI want them to to be open and loving and\nwhatever it might be you need to look\nand and as if you were sitting down to\nplan a business you would never start a\nbusiness without a business plan at\nleast putting some stuff on paper I\nthink it's the same thing whether you\nare wanting to have children or where\nyou whether you currently have children\nsitting down at the pen and paper and\nlike asking yourself what is it that I\nwould like to pass on to my children\nwhat would I like them to be like uh\nwhen they grow up and they're adults how\ndo I want them to treat themselves and\ntreat their people that they work with\nand treat their spouse and treat their\nchildren and look at that and make an\nentire list and then ask yourself the\nquestion after you look at the list do I\nembody all of these and I'm going to be\nbrutally honest with everybody none of\nus will embody every single one of those\nthings and if you look at those things\nand you see okay I'm doing pretty good\nhere I'm doing actually yeah I could use\nsome work on this one I could use some\nwork on this one if not if you don't\nembody all of the things that you would\nlove for your children to embody your\nchildren to be then it's time to get to\nwork and that's really how I've been\nseeing it you know the past seven or\neight months at this point a uh in the\nmorning is what I've been doing you\ncould call it meditation you could call\nit prayer I don't know what it what it\nis but it's literally just me sitting\nand speaking to the universe um is for\nthe past seven eight months every\nmorning uh I've been I've been\nmeditating and that I've been saying\njust help me let go of what I no longer\nneed right help me let go of what I no\nlonger need help me let go of anything\nthat I do not want to pass along to my\nson and the reason why is because uh we\nall develop fears and limiting beliefs\nand patterns within\nourselves that um made sense at some\npoint in time you know it it's it's\nalways a fear that pops up or a Lim\nbelief that pops up made sense at some\npoint in time it was a protection\nmechanism for us in the past but as\nadults we can look at it and say do I\nstill need this do do I want to pass\nthis on to my children or is this\nsomething I need to to work through and\nso for me it's been hey help me help me\nlet go of what I no longer need help me\nlet go of it help me um help me let go\nof anything that I don't want to pass\nalong to my son and I've been spending a\nlot of time in silence thinking about\nthose things and giving myself\nopportunity to think about who I am who\nI want to be who I want my my child to\nbe how I want to interact with them and\nuh and it's just been a lot of if you've\nbeen hearing me over the past few months\njust talking about I've been I've been\ngoing outside and just sitting in\nsilence like yesterday I went outside\nand I sat by the pool for about 30\nminutes and just sat there there was no\nphone just me and my dog and I was just\nwatching the clouds pass and I was just\nthinking about what I want my life to be\nhow I want to how I want to help uh this\nchild grow but also like what are some\naspects of myself that I don't want them\nto have right like what do I not want to\npass on to my kids I currently have and\nif they're there how do I need to work\nthrough them so that therefore whatever\nit is that I don't want to pass along um\nit's maybe not something I can fully get\nrid of but it doesn't rear its ugly head\nas often as it does currently because\nlike one thing for me I'll just be be\nbrutally honest with you I'm the type of\nperson that can be go go go go go in\nbusiness and I didn't always used to be\nthis way I built myself into a person\nit's like go go go go go go go in\nbusiness but when you build yourself\ninto someone who's go go go go go go go\num and it's meeting meeting meeting\nmeeting meeting and it's a lot of stuff\nbeing being done it's makes it hard to\nturn it off sometimes and children's\nnervous system learns how to be from an\nadult's nervous system from their their\nparents nervous system especially in the\nfirst uh few months is the child's\nnervous system is learning by actually\nfeeling your nervous system and so do I\nwant to be go go go go go on my business\nand then sit down and have a quiet\nmoment with my son and I can't even stop\nand be present um and I can't stop in in\nand be there or I have to be doing\nsomething else or have to be thinking\nabout the next thing that I have to do\nyou know I was the type of person for a\nwhile where going on vacation was hard\nfor me because I could not turn my brain\noff of what need to be done in business\nand the next idea and all of that stuff\nand so I've been slowly uh and\nconsciously unprogrammed that I don't\nwant my child to learn an anxious go go\ngo go go nervous system a nervous system\nthat um can't be present in in this\nmoment so I've been working on turning\nthat on while I'm working because that\nis a really good thing when you're\nworking but turning it off when I'm not\nif you listen to an episode I did uh\nabout a week or so ago a little while\nago I was talking about you know your\nnervous system being on your nervous\nyour your sympathetic and your\nparasympathetic nervous system and and\nbeing go go go and then turning it off\nand being go go go and turn it off the\nsame way that when you're working out\nyou can be lifting heavy but you also\nneed rest in order to lift heavier the\nnext time you go in and so I've been\nworking on on that uh because for me I\njust didn't want to not be present\nwhenever I decide that I want to be\npresent my since since I was a child and\nhaving a father that wasn't present my\nnumber one goal was to be a father who\nwas present and so I can be there\nphysically right but am I there\nemotionally and like literally actually\nthere A lot of times people are not and\nso you know I've been working on turning\nit on while I'm at work and turning it\noff while I'm not at work and you know\num to to not feel like I always have to\nbe doing something else a lot of times\npeople struggle with meditation because\nthey feel like there's something else\nthey should be doing they need to be\nthey're thinking about their kids and\nthinking about work and they're thinking\nabout what the the things they need to\nChuck off for the to-do list and they're\nnever actually fully ever in the present\nmoment because when they sit down to try\nto be present their mind is always\nsomewhere else you know when I one of\nthe goals that I have is when I sit down\nwith my children I want to be able to\nbring as much presence as I possibly can\nand so I've been working on that I've\nbeen doing a lot of breath work recently\num I've been doing a ton of breath work\non YouTube to calm my nervous system so\nthat I can be go go go and then I can\ncalm it and I can be go go go when I\nwant to be and I can so I can it's like\na switch instead of it being something\nthat's always on it's I can flip it on I\ncan flip it off and so I've been and\ntraining my nervous system to calm\nitself down and every single day for at\nleast seven months now uh I've been\ndoing at least 15 minutes of breath work\nevery single morning and on average I\nprobably do it two times a day breath\nwork and then there's some days\nespecially on on Tuesdays when I have a\nlot that's going on I usually do it at\nleast four times a day and so um you\nknow I'm somebody we a lot of people say\nlike I don't I'm too busy to do all of\nthat right I'm super busy as well but I\nfind that when I find some time even if\nit's just five minutes to do some breath\nwork and be present it actually makes me\nmore productive when I do go into my\nbusiness the thing that that's super\nimportant I want everyone to understand\nthat's that's listening is that the real\nwork that we have like and it took me\nyears and years and years and years and\nyears to understand this I thought the\nreal work for the longest time was to to\nbuild a business to be successful to\nmake money to have stability to have\nsecurity all of that stuff which all of\nthat is fine and it was always about\nachievement and it was always about\ndriving it was always about getting to\nthe next Mountaintop uh the real work is\nyour own in\nconnection and we think that it's\nexternal we think that it's\nachievement\nbut when you really start to think about\nit it's not that the real work and\nhopefully you can understand this you're\nat a point in your journey where you can\nreally get it deep in your bones the\nreal work that you have to do and your\ntime here is on your own interconnection\nanything that is disconnecting you from\nyourself is what you need to work on\nanything that is making you feel a lack\nof acceptance for yourself a lack of\nlove for yourself is the thing that you\nneed to work on\nright and to to feel like you don't need\nsomething something like you win in my\nopinion this is my opinion you win at\nlife when you need\nnothing you don't have anything that you\nhave to go do you could still have you\ncould still here's the crazy part about\nit I used to think like if I need\nnothing then I'm going to be brok and\nI'm not going to have a business and I'm\nnot going to be successful I'm not going\nto be able to have what I'm not going to\nwant to do anything anymore I won't want\nto travel I won't want to you know\nchallenge myself all of that was\ncompletely false you went at life when\nyou need nothing but you can still go\nout and play without coming from the\nplace of like I need to go succeed or I\nneed to achieve or I need to make money\nor I need to buy something or have Fame\nin order to fill a void within my soul\nwhich is I don't feel worthy and I need\nto go outside to find love because\nwhatever you're searching for from the\nexternal world is what you're really\nsearching for from yourself you know a\nlot of times and I've I I know a lot of\nvery successful people and I've done\nthis within myself as well uh we think\nthat achievement is going to fill the\nvoid within oursel but this is a very\nimportant point I want you to think\nabout this and really let this settle in\nif for the next 30 Years you worked your\nass off you got everything that you\nwanted you had all the fame the success\nthe happiness The Joy all of those\nthings you made all of the money you\nwanted to you traveled to all the place\nyou possibly could you had houses and\ncars and clothes maybe you had a\nplane right if you had everything that\nyou wanted and you fast forward 30 years\nfrom today you would give all of it away\nto be where you are right now\neverything I'm 38 years old right now if\nI was 68 years old and I made a hundred\nmillion and did all of the cool I\ncould possibly do I would give every bit\nof it at 68 years old to be back where I\nam at 38 years old right now so what\ndoes that say the present moment is the\nmost important moment in your life what\nis taking you away from the present\nmoment a lot of people are trying to do\nsomething else they trying to go further\nalong they're trying to figure out what\nthe next thing is that they need to do I\nhave come to realize\nthat and it goes back to a James Taylor\nquote it's like a song in the 70s he\nwrote the purpose of life is to enjoy\nthe passage of\ntime and so one thing I've been trying\nto do is trying to enjoy the passage of\ntime with no external stimulation in any\nsort of way no phone no books none of\nthat stuff to be able to sit outside sit\nwith my dog hang out not even have to\ntalk to anybody but to enjoy that moment\nas much as I possibly\ncan think about that for a second just\ngo back to what I said you would give\neverything that you\nhave 30 years from today to be back in\nthis moment this exact moment exactly\nwhere you currently are which shows us\nthat the present moment is the most\nimportant moment of your entire life and\nthe the the purpose of our life is to\nenjoy the passage of\ntime what is getting in the way of us\nenjoying the passage of time is it is it\nour fears is it our limiting beliefs is\nit our selft talk is it the fact that we\nfeel like we should be further along is\nit we feel like we need to achieve more\nwe need to be more in order to be worthy\nof\nsomething whatever is in the way of you\nenjoying the passage of time is what is\nstealing your presence from the present\nmoment so for me that's what I've been\nworking on I just want to be more\npresent because ultimately I think\nthat's the best thing that I can do to\nuh serve myself to serve the world to\nserve my son to serve my family my wife\neveryone around me is to be as present\nas I possibly can with every person that\nI sit down with so it's not an easy\nmountain to\nclimb but that's what I'm working on so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me
