    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode today I'm\ngoing to teach you a sneaky little thing\nthat your brain does to hold yourself\nback and I'm going to teach you how to\nget past it let's dive in today I'm\ngoing to be talking to you about one of\nthe biggest problems that I see with the\nhuman mind it's a good thing but for\ntrying to be successful and get outside\nof your comfort zone and build the life\nthat you want it is your biggest hangup\nmost of the time one of the biggest\nthings that I see that stops people from\ntaking action and creating the life that\nthey want is the this thing if you can\nunderstand this first off and you can\nMaster it it will be so much easier for\nyou to take action to do the things that\nyou need to do and stop holding yourself\nback very rarely do I talk to someone\nand they don't know what they need to do\nto create the life that they want\nusually everybody has a pretty good idea\nof what is they need to do to create\nwhatever life it is that they want\neverybody listening this podcast has\nsomething different that you want to\ncreate in your life\nlife\nbut you probably aren't doing it and if\nyou are doing it you probably aren't\ndoing it to the full capacity that you\ncould and so a lot of times it's not\nthat we don't know what we need to do\nit's just that we're not doing it and\nthe most the most important decision\nthat we can make is whether we decide\nthat we're going to go for the life that\nwe want or we're not because it it takes\nthe decision like you got to you can't\nsit on the fence you've just got to\ndecide I'm either going like there's a\nfork in the road I'm either going to\nstay exactly as I am in the same place\nand I'll fast forward in 20 years and my\nlife is going to look pretty close to\nwhat it does right now or I'm going to\nchange and it requires a decision you've\nheard me say this many times in the\npodcast the root word in Greek for\ndecision is decader which means to cut\noff to cut off all other options I am\ngoing to go down this path of creating\nthe life that I want to and that is it\nand so if you do decide that you want to\ncreate the life that you want to want to\ncreate the relationship that you want to\nthe family that you want to the body\nthat you want to the health that you\nwant to the business you want to all\nthat stuff you've got to understand how\nyour brain is going to work and it's\nthis little thing that I always call\nOpportunity versus obligation okay\nthere's always opportunity that we have\nout there of what our life could be if\nwe do this thing but we usually don't\nfocus on the\nopportunity of what it could be in one\nyear or 5 years or 10 years we usually\nfocus on the obligation and the\nobligation usually makes us a little bit\nnegative and not want to do it what you\nhave to understand about your brain is\nit's got this incredible protection\nmechanism built in and that protection\nmechanism built into it is to try to\nkeep you inside of your comfort zone to\nkeep you alive that is awesome for\nStaying Alive it is terrible for\nbuilding a life that is amazing the the\nreason why is because if you're going to\ngrow yourself you're going to expand\nyourself you're going to have to get out\nof your comfort zone and that is\nabsolutely terrifying to the human brain\nbecause the brain will almost always try\nto pull you back and so you can\nconsciously want to build the life that\nyou want but your brain is going to give\nyou things and make things pop up and\ngive you certain feelings that your body\nis going to create to try to keep you in\nthe same place it is kind of a little\nbit of you versus your brain in a lot of\ncases\nso like for instance I'll give you an\nexample of like opportunity versus\nobligation you know you're going to go\nto the gym and you're uh you know you're\nskinny little person you're trying to\nput on some weight right you're trying\nto put on some weight you're trying to\nput on some muscle the the opportunity\nversus the obligation right the\nobligation is that you have to put your\nbody under\nstrain and it's a lot easier to do\nnothing life is there's always an\nopportunity to do nothing and it's\nalways easier to do nothing and if\nyou're a skinny person like I was a\nskinny little guy for a long time and I\nremember hitting the gym really hard one\ntime so hard that when I worked my\nbiceps I wasn't able to put my arms down\nlike they were stuck at like 90Â° because\nit hurts so much to put it lower and so\nin my mind that hurt that that was a lot\nof pain I don't want to go do that again\nit's easier to do nothing and so what\nhappens is our brain will immediately go\nto oh yeah we working out whether it's\nputting on muscle or trying to lose\nweight oh yeah working out yeah that's\nthat's a lot of strain that's a lot of\nit's easier to sit on the couch and so\nyour brain is focusing on the obligation\nwhat you have to\ndo your but you that's that's your\nunconscious is automatically going to go\nto that and it's going to go yeah you\nknow what maybe I should stay on the\ncouch you have to always start thinking\nabout the opportunity the focusing on\nwhat you want to be well the opportunity\ncould be that that I lose 30 lbs and I\nfeel like there's less weight on my\nknees and I feel better about myself and\nI look great in a bikini this year or it\ncould be hey I'm going to put on some\nmuscle so when I go to the beach and I\ntake my shirt off I look good and I have\na six-pack right so it could be losing\nweight being proud of the way that you\nlook gaining muscle all of that stuff\nthere's always an obligation of what has\nto be done which is what your brain\nusually focuses on and tries to make it\nfeel as painful as possible because if\nit feels as painful as possible thinking\nabout it you're you're less likely to do\nit but you have to consciously make\nyourself think of the opportunity of\nwhat can come from that right so I'll\ngive you another example right let's say\neating healthy is another one the\nobligation is you have to stay away from\ncertain foods that maybe taste\namazing right now is there good healthy\nfood hell yeah there's great healthy\nfood and this is where most people\nusually don't eat healthy because\nthey're like I don't want to change like\nI really like the taste of whatever this\nthing is a bag of Skittles I really I\nreally love I don't know you guys but I\nreally love the taste of ice\ncream the obligations is I have to stop\neating ice cream that sounds like I\ndon't want to do that oh no I don't want\nto do that right but so that's the\nobligation of I have to give these\nthings up or I have to prepare my meals\nthat takes a whole lot more energy to\nprepare my meals to eat healthier to to\nmeal prep for myself it's easier to just\nwatch Netflix and see what what goes on\non in the world on Netflix it's easier\nto do that than it is to meal prep for\nthe week that's the obligation right our\nbrain will always go to the obligation\ntry to make it look as painful as\npossible so therefore what do we do stay\nin the same place we have to know our\nbrain's going to do that we have to go\nno no no I'm focusing on the opportunity\nI'm focusing on the fact that I'm going\nto live longer for my for my kids I'm\ngoing to walk my daughter down the aisle\nbecause I'm not going to have a heart\nattack early I'm going to be able to\nplay with my grandkids at 65 years old\nright that's the opportunity most of the\ntime though we're focused on right here\nright now that's usually what your brain\nwants you to do you have to get up and\ngo to the gym or you have to get up and\nmeal prep or you're not allowed to have\ncertain certain meals that you're used\nto we have to consciously to fast\nforward oursel into the future and say\nno I'm going to make this decision\nbecause it's better for me and it's\nbetter for me long term and I might not\nhave\nany\nany any right now I might not have any\ngratification in this moment but\nlongterm I will have gratification from\nit so it's instant gratification versus\ndelayed gratification I would rather\nhave the delayed gratification let's say\nyou're in sales right and you've got to\nmake phone calls because you want to be\nable to you know buy a new house for\nyour family so the obligation is you got\nto put in some work right now right I\nknow salespeople I've trained over 2,000\nsales people I've had to do this before\nit is hard to get yourself to go all\nright I got to make a 100 calls right\nnow God that sucks\nright so the obligation is you got to\nput in some work you got to call people\nup you got to have some people say like\nnot even answer you got to have some\npeople actually reject you oh God do you\nknow how painful that is maybe some\npeople are going to hang up on you so\nyour brain immediately goes to that\nobligation no no no that's going to be\npainful right brain a lot of times\nimmediately goes to negative negative\nnegative negative almost always a brain\nleft to its own devices will go negative\nsome people are going to hang up on you\nyou're going to get rejected it's going\nto make you feel like it's going to\nbring up all of your\ninsecurities but that's what our brain\ngoes to that's the obligation we still\nhave to make the phone calls of course\nbut now I need to consciously take\nmyself and be intentional and fast\nforward into the future of how making\nthese phone calls is going to help me\ncreate the life that I want you know\nwhat I'm going to be able to make enough\nmoney to buy my first house to put my\nchildren we're going to move to a better\npart of town they're going to get a\nbetter\neducation yeah that's that's way more\nimportant to me than someone rejecting\nme I'm going to take my family on a trip\nyou know I've been telling my wife that\nwe're going to go to to Spain for five\nyears and we haven't had the money to do\nso so I'm going to start to think about\nhow amazing it would be to be in Spain\nwhich then makes I'm thinking of the\nopportunity while I'm doing the\nobligation you know what I'm going to\nbuy my mom a car my mom's never had a\nnice car before I'm going to buy my mom\na nice car car and you start thinking\nabout that and all of that I promise you\nmakes the hard worth hard work worth it\nbut a lot of times we're not focused on\nthe opportunity what do we focus on the\nobligation what we have to do waking up\nearly the obligation is you got to get\nout of your warm comfortable amazing bed\nand I don't know about you guys but like\nthe second that I wake up my bed is the\nmost comfortable place in the universe\nand I have to get out of it to get up\nearly to do like a workout and\nmeditation and stuff\nG yeah it's much easier to stay in bed\nand just not do that I have to leave the\nmost comfortable place in the universe\nto go do a\nworkout to do a morning routine oh it's\nso much easier to stay in bed hey just\nstay in bed so the obligation is yeah\nyou got to get out of this comfortable\nspot yeah you got to go put in some work\nH it's so much easier just to stay where\nyou are rob you might as well just stay\nwhere you are don't worry about it just\nstay where you are but\nthe opportunity could be think about how\nmuch better you're going to feel after\nyour morning routine I don't know about\nyou but but when I miss my morning\nroutine because of something happening\nwhatever it might be you know life gets\nin the way sometimes I don't feel as\ngood I just feel better when I have a\nmorning routine when I take some time to\nmyself when I have some time to to have\nsilence to do meditation do breath work\nto do some some reading to get a workout\nin you and if I do have that time I feel\nso much better after morning routine\nthat is the opportunity you know what I\nactually treat people better if I get my\nmeditation in that is an opportunity\nthat's there as well you know I I uh\ntrain a lot of coaches on how to how to\ngrow their coaching business as well and\nso you know I always talk about we were\ntalking about this a couple weeks ago\nwhere it's like doing sales calls and\ngetting somebody onto a phone call and\nchatting with them the obligation is you\ngot to put some work in you might get\nrejected someone might say no sometimes\nthat doesn't feel very good and you can\nlook at that you can be like yeah\nthat sucks but that's and that's the\nobligation and that can bring up your\ninsecurities and that's the reason why\nsomebody doesn't want to make calls or\ndo whatever it is they want to do is\nbecause they might get rejected and if\nthey get rejected it's going to bring up\ntheir insecurities and they're going to\nstart to feel not good enough not smart\nenough childhood things are going to\ncome up when they're bullied and they\nstart feeling the same way whatever it\nmight be it's easier to not do all those\nthings so the obligation is you have to\ngo and possibly get rejected the\nopportunity is what if somebody says\nyes and you work with that person for 3\nmonths or 6 months and you change that\nperson's life well at that point in time\nnow we're talking about a big\ndifference so there's always going to be\nthings that you have to do that's just\nthe way that life is there's always\ngoing to be things that you exuse me\nthat you that you should do or could do\nor need to do or whatever it is I don't\nknow the correct phrase because have to\nyou don't have to do anything you could\njust sit on the couch and stare at the\nceiling if you want to but there's\nalways going to be things that need to\nbe done in order to get the life that\nyou want and you have to get to a point\nwhere you make a decision to do the hard\nthings and if you don't want to do the\nhard things then just make the decision\nnow that you're not going to do the hard\nthings just stay as you are forever if\nthat's the case and that's what you\nthat's what you decide then do it but\nmake the decision don't be on the fence\nanymore it's either I'm going to change\nmy life or I'm going to stay the same\nmake the decision of what it is that you\nwant to do it's like my very first\nmentor\nused to always say this it was like the\nfirst real phrase I guess in in\nself-development and and working on\nmyself that kind of got hardwired into\nme and it's you're either green and\ngrowing and brown and dying there is no\nstaying the same because if you're the\nsame now VI I'm let's say that again if\nyou're the same in five years as you are\nright now you're older but you're not\nany more wise you're not any further\nalong so it's not even really staying\nthe same it's actually kind of going\nbackwards and so you're either green and\ngrowing or brown and dying so you have\nto make the decision are you going to\ntake the route where you're going to be\ngreen and growing or you going to take\nthe route where you're going to be brown\nand dying it's completely up to you this\nis your life this is completely your\nlife no one can make you do anything\nthat you don't want to do but at some\npoint you have to grow up and put the\nwork in if you do want to change your\nlife no one's going to come and save you\nthere's no night and shining armor\nthat's going to say hey you know what\ntake a nap I'll go ahead and build your\nlife for you I'll build that perfect\nbusiness I'll build the perfect body for\nyou I'll do all I'll I'll just go ahead\nand stay inside of your bed I'll go\nahead and do your morning routine for\nyou no one's going to come and save you\nand we're owed nothing the universe owes\nus nothing all we got to do is we got to\nput in the work to create the life that\nwe want so what I want you to do is\nunderstand that if you're starting to\nthink man I I want to take this action\nbut I'm not doing it why the hell am I\nnot doing it you're probably not\nfocusing on the outcome that you want\nyou're probably not focusing on the\nopportunity that's in front of you\nyou're focusing on oh I have to do this\nthing oh I've got to I've got to put\nsome work in I've got to strain myself\noh it's going to be a little bit hard I\ndon't know if I can do this your\ninsecurities and your fears and limiting\nbeliefs might be coming up but it's it\ncomes back to that phrase when you think\nabout quitting remember why you started\nwhen you think about quitting remember\nwhy you started why are you doing in the\nfirst place why are you wanting to grow\nyour business why are you wanting to\nmake these sales calls why are you\nwanting to get up early why are you\nwanting to eat healthy why are you\nwanting to work out\nwhen you think about quitting remember\nwhy you started and if you do that that\nis a perfect example of focusing on the\nopportunity versus the obligation so\nthat's I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories tag me at Rob\ndial Jr robd a l Jr and with that I'm\ngoing to
