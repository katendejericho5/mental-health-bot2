    "transcript": "one of the hardest pills to swallow is\nthat you will lose yourself if you're\nalways trying to please other people and\nyou will lose people when you finally\nChoose Yourself but if somebody leaves\nyour side because you decided to step\ninto your truest self then they were\nnever there for you in the first place\nthey were there for themselves and it's\nbetter to lose them now than to have a\nfake friend forever"
