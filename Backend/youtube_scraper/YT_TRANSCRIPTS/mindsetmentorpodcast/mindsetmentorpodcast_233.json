    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about doing a spring\ncleaning in every single aspect of your\nlife and doing a massive Purge to help\nyou get closer to your goals and to make\nyour life a little bit more effortless\nlet's dive in it is a\nspringtime and right now people talk\nabout spring cleaning and going through\nand making their house prettier and all\nof that stuff and getting rid of things\nand purging things that they don't\nnecessarily need anymore and what I'm\ngoing to talk about today is really good\nfor the spring but I actually recommend\nthat you do it uh at least two to four\ntimes a year and um every six months to\nevery quarter is what I would recommend\nand it is to look around your life and\nto purge anything that is not serving\nyou anymore and so a couple episodes ago\nI talked about the mental diet that\nyou're on and how you actually pay\nattention to everything that comes into\nyour brain now let's start to talk a\nlittle bit more about your physical\nenvironment that's around you cuz all\ntoo often we hang on to things just to\nhave them and um this is something that\nwe're going through right now in my life\nif you follow me on Instagram uh you\nprobably know this if you don't follow\nme on Instagram uh which I know a lot of\npeople don't uh my wife is pregnant and\nshe's actually due in uh about a month\nand uh we have she's been doing this\nthing called nesting and if you don't\nknow what nesting is we've been cleaning\nout every single spot in our entire\nlives we're cleaning out what was the\nguest room and now it's going to be the\nnursery we're cleaning out my office\nwe're cleaning out our entire house and\nshe just wants things to go cleaning out\nthe garage all of the entire house is a\nspring cleaning and uh that's what I\nspend my weekends doing now which is\nawesome but um if you don't follow me on\nInstagram you probably didn't know so\nnow you do know my wife is pregnant we\nhave a a boy a mini mindset Mentor\nthat's going to be coming in in May and\nso um one of the things that that we do\nthough and uh and more than anything\nelse is we hang on to things and we\nrealized damn we have a lot of stuff we\nneed to get rid of like stuff that we\njust don't really need anymore more\nstuff that we can donate and all too\noften we do this in our lives we just\nhave things we have thoughts we have\nhabits we have people that we kind of\nkeep around just because we think H\nmaybe I might need this shirt that I\nhaven't worn in seven years but um the\nway I like to think about it is that\neverything that you own owns a piece of\nyou and everything that you have in your\nlife owns a little teeny tiny spot in\nyour brain and the the way I like to\nthink about is if it's not\nhelping you move forward if it's not\npropelling you forward in life it could\nbe weighing you down and so when you\npurge when you do a spring cleaning\nyou're able to move faster you feel\nlighter life becomes a little bit more\neffortless and uh some of you have have\nnever done this before which means that\nwhen you do you are going to feel like a\ndifferent person and so it's called a\npurge It's called Spring cleaning\nbecause we're in the spring right now\nand the idea is to do this to take one\nday of your life take this weekend if\nyou have nothing planned on Sunday take\nthis weekend and do nothing but just get\nrid of things and get rid of whatever is\nnot serving you and I'm going to teach\nyou all the different categories you\nknow of course there's like t-shirts and\nall that stuff but there's other things\nbesides like just the spring cleaning\nside of it um this is mental this is\nemotional cleaning as well uh so first\noff we're going to talk about the\nphysical objects because those are easy\nto get through right before we dive into\nthe actual real deep stuff go through\nevery single room in your house the\nrooms the garage the office the car\neverywhere which is what I've been doing\nwith my life recently and Purge\neverything that does not serve you stop\nhoarding things everything that you own\nowns a piece of you it owns a piece of\nyour brain and uh you will start to\nnotice that when you get rid of things\nyou will feel a little bit lighter and a\nlittle bit more free and so what you\nwant to do you maybe have never done\nthis before but you want to design your\nenvironment to support you and your\ngoals you you know if you have a family\nand you want to become closer can you\ndesign your environment to support you\nand becoming closer to your family and\nif you if you are single and you're\nworking towards your goals and you live\nin a a one-bedroom apartment can you\ndesign your environment if you're if\nyou're growing your first business ever\ncan you design your environment to\nsupport you in your goals you know for\nme when I had a one benjam apartment\nwhen I was single when I was growing one\nof my first businesses it was it was all\ndesign designed around how can I support\nhow can I design my environment to help\nme in in getting closer to my goals\nright so there were books everywhere and\nall it was was just basically a\nbookshelf there was no TV because that's\nnot helping me and supporting me and\ngrowing my business but there was a\nwhiteboard on the wall so I could sit on\nmy couch and I could brainstorm and I\ncould think and I could have friends\nover and we could brainstorm and think\nand so can you design your environment\neveryone who's listening is in different\nstage of their life can you design your\nenvironment to support you in your goals\nthat's the first thing that I want to\nbring in now let's start to talk talk\nabout other things when you think about\nwhat's going on in your brain think\nabout the thoughts that you think and\nyou want to take a pen and piece of\npaper and you want to write down\neverything write down every room in your\nhouse write down everything that you\nhave in there that you can get rid of\nthat you can let go of what you're going\nto do with them but now let's start to\ntalk about what goes on in your\nbrain are there thoughts that you think\nthat are no longer serving you that you\nshould maybe do a mental spring cleaning\ninside of your brain are there thoughts\nthat you think are there fears that you\nhave are there limiting beliefs that you\nhave that are holding you back from\ncreating the life that you want does\nthere happen to be maybe a story or a\nnarrative that you have about yourself\nthat's holding you back do you have a\nstory or narrative about your parents\nand the way that they treated you as a\nchild that's holding you back do you\nhave a story or a narrative about your\nspouse or your significant other or your\nchildren or your brother or sister your\nfamily members that are holding you back\nin some sort of way that you've been\nholding on to for 17 years and it's time\nfor you to get rid of can you go through\nand actually start to think about the\nthoughts that are going on in your head\nand say does this serve me and if it\ndoesn't how can I get rid of it how can\nI let go of it so that's the first thing\nis the the mental side then I want you\nto start to think about the actions that\nyou take the habits that you have and\nstart to think about does this help me\nor does this hurt me has this just been\nlingering for years if you have habit of\ngoing to bed really late you're just\nlike oh I'm just a night owl that's just\nthe way that I\nam okay or have you trained yourself to\nbe that way I remember watching a video\none time with with Rick Rubin who's like\nprobably the best uh music producer\nthat's ever existed and uh I remember\nlistening to it he's like I thought for\nthe first 50 years of my life I was just\na night owl and he goes and then I just\ndecided to start being a morning person\nand I realized that I had trained myself\nto be a night owl and so I retrained\nmyself to be a morning person so can you\nstart to think about the habits that you\nhave waking up late or waking up late is\nthat helping you is that hurting you\ngoing to bed late it's that helping you\nor hurting you the when you work out\ndon't work out the walks that you do or\ndon't go on the habits that you have the\nactions that you take are those helping\nyou or are those hurting you if they're\nserving you and they're they're serving\nyou for the greater good and and moving\nyou towards the life that you want hold\non to those things if they're holding\nyou back from the life that you want\nmaybe those are some things that you\nshould start to let go of and replace\nwith something else that's going to be\nhelping you what about the standards\nthat you have for yourself do you have\ncertain standards that are helping you\ncool keep those do you have certain\nstandards that are hurting you cool\nmaybe that's something that you used to\nstart to let go of you know like if if\nyou're the type of person who shows up\nlate to calls shows up late to meetings\nshows up late to F family and friend\nevents you know that's probably not the\nway that you want to be viewed by other\npeople I literally had a um I was\nwatching a a sales call that one of my\nteam members had had done it was a zoom\nthat was recorded and the guy said uh on\nit he said I I I was I was on an\nenrollment call and I was on a call with\nanother company that's a competitor of\nyours and the guy showed up 10 minutes\nlate he didn't apologize he just showed\nup 10 minutes late and he said to\nhimself yeah I'm not working with these\npeople just because of the environment\nit wasn't let oh some people can't show\nup late it was there there's no apology\nand he was you know he believes in being\non time and that was just a a mini part\nof him so it's like hey maybe if you're\nshowing up a little bit late maybe if\nyou're you're not following through and\ndoing what you say you're going to do\nmaybe those things are kind of holding\nyou back in some sort of way because the\nway you do one thing is the way you do\neverything so what are your habits what\nare your actions what are your standards\nthat are helping you and what are the\nones that are hurting you and can you\nkeep the ones that are helping you and\nserving you and can you let go of the\nones that are not then we should talk\nabout the people that you surround\nyourself with right your friends your\nfamily your significant\nother the people that you follow on\nInstagram as I spoke about a couple\nepisodes ago are they helping you are\nthey hurting you are they celebrating\nyour success do they not care about your\nsuccess do they find holes in your\nsuccess you just start to go through and\nstart to think about hey man like like\nI've got people right here that I've\nbeen around in my life for a really long\ntime and every single time I'm around\nthem I start to feel worse about myself\nI start to feel drained when I think\nabout being around them okay well is are\nare they helping you or they hurting you\nis that relationship serving you are you\nserving them in that relationship start\nto go through and actually and start to\nthink with a fine tooth comb like what\nshould I do okay what about the food\nthat you consume the food that's inside\nof your house is it helping you is it\nhurting you we uh we had a a baby shower\na couple weeks ago and uh we had all of\nthe cake come back to our house and we\nhad all of the uh the treats and stuff\ncome back to our house and I don't have\nany self-control when it comes around\nthose things I I so what I do personally\nis I keep all of that out of the\nhouse when it was in the house and then\neveryone came over and my mom was over\nat the house and she was staying there\nand my wife family was staying at the\nhouse it was all there I don't have\nreally great self-control I have great\nself-control until I have sugar after I\nhave self-control no self after I have\nsugar I'm sorry I have no self-control\nso I had to get rid of all of that stuff\nonce everybody left I had to throw all\nof it away I said either take it if you\ndon't want to take it it's getting\nthrown in the trash cuz I just know how\nI am so when you look around that the\nfood that's inside of your house is it\nserving you is it helping you become\nhealthier become the person you want to\nbe is it hurting you in some sort of way\nare you like me where you got sugar\nproblems and if there's too much sugar\nyou eat it that's that's what I do and\nso I know with myself uh there's a\nthere's a difference there's I wrote\nthis in my book there's a difference\nbetween Rob uh that has Skittles in the\nhouse and Rob that doesn't have Skittles\nin the house and my willpower is\ndifferent and that's me like I know what\nmy willpower is so do you know what's in\nyour house what's helping you what's\nhurting you all that stuff uh what about\nyour finances when you look at the way\nthat you think about your finances the\nhabits that you have around your\nfinances the fact that maybe you've\nnever done a budget before and you're 40\nyears old and you have money coming in\nyou've never sat down and said okay I\nneed to look at where my money's going I\nneed to look at how I'm allocating my\nmoney I need to look at all of this\nstuff and you start to look at your\nfinances are are your habits your traits\nyour actions helping you in becoming the\nperson that you want to be and and maybe\nbecoming more financially free or\nfinancially stable or getting out of\ndebt or is it hurting you do you end up\nspending more money that you need to do\nyou end up going into Target more times\nthan you need to and you meant to go buy\none thing but you end up spending $300\nat Target because you found a bunch of\nreally cool stuff that you liked right\nare your finances that you currently\nhave are they helping or hurting you if\nyou're looking at your life you're\nsaying this is the amazing life that I\nwant to create this is how much money\nthat I\nhave is where I currently am going to\nhelp me get to where I want to be or do\nI need to start maybe figuring something\nelse out do I need to learn something I\nneed to get a new skill set in order to\nmake myself more valuable in the\nmarketplace start to see what you can uh\ndo some spring cleaning on you know oh\nmy gosh I'm spending this much money on\nthese things yeah I don't really need to\nbuy I don't need

a lot of\npeople don't do this but I promise you\nwhen you do this type of stuff it's\ngoing to help you so much what about the\npossessions that you own all of the\nthings that are in your\nhouse think about that what about your\ngoals and your vision do you have your\ngoals up do you have your vision have\nyou thought about it have you started\nthinking about every single little thing\nthat's inside of your life what you\nreally need to start thinking to\nyourself is is ask yourself if you're\ntrying to figure out like should I keep\nthis should I not keep this I'm not\nreally sure ask yourself the question\ndoes it serve me does it serve me when I\nlook at my possessions these this thing\nright here that's in front of me does it\nserve me when I look at the TV\nsubscriptions that I have does it serve\nme when I look at social media and the\npeople that I'm following on social\nmedia does it serve me when I look at my\nliving situation does it serve me when I\nlook at the things
