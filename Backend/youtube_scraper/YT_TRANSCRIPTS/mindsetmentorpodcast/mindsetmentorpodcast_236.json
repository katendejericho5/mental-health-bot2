    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode today I'm\ngoing to teach you how to do less how to\nslow down but also how to get more done\nlet's go ahead and dive in I started in\npersonal development when I was 19 years\nold and I started my first business uh\n17 years ago and um I was uh 20 years\nold I'm uh 38 now so it's about to be 18\nyears since I I started my first\nbusiness and when I was younger the only\nthing that I knew was go go go go go and\nit was something that I built into\nmyself over time before I started my\nfirst business and de you know\ndiscovered self-development I was\nincredibly lazy and uh it's just the I I\nhad no Direction nothing to be excited\nabout nothing to want to put work into\nand when I found something that I was\npassionate about the only thing that I\nknew is that if I wanted to be\nsuccessful I had to be going at all\ntimes I had to be working on all the\ntime and in the moments when I was at\nhome in the shower my brain had to be\nthinking about work all of the time\nthere was almost no off switch and from\nuh basically 21 to 25 years old I worked\naround 110 hours a week every single\nweek so it was basically uh on average\nit about 9:00 a.m. I'm sorry 7:00 a.m.\nto 900 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. I was in my\noffice every single day 7 days a a week\nand so it was like 7:00 a.m. to 9900\np.m. 11:00 p.m. every single day because\nI thought that's what I was supposed to\ndo I thought that's what that was the\nonly way to get to success now I can\ntell you at this point in time it's\ndefinitely not and it's actually the\nfastest way to burn yourself out I\ncompletely burned myself out and I went\nfrom running a super successful business\nto running it into the ground because I\nwas just done with it I didn't want to\ndo it anymore and uh now that I've been\ndoing this for you know 17 18 years at\nthis point and um I'm 38 a secret to\nsuccess that I have found that I don't\nhear anyone really ever talking about is\nrest and um I'm not talking about taking\na nap sure you take it na if you like\nthat's completely fine but what I'm\nreally talking about is there's there's\ntwo sides to your to your nervous system\nright so your nervous system you have a\nsympathetic ner part of your nervous\nsystem and you have the parasympathetic\nnervous system right the sympathetic\nthere is no good or bad in this too just\nso you know sympathetic nervous system\nthat's the side of you that is fight or\nflight that is the side of you that is\ngo go go go running from something\nwhatever it might be fight ORF flight\nthat is for me the sympathetic nervous\nsystem was the part of me that was\nturned on 110 hours a week and it was go\ngo go go go the other side of that is\nthe parasympathetic nervous system and\nparasympathetic nervous system system is\nrest relaxation and the way I like to\nschedule my days now and I actually have\nbeen doing now quite recently and it's\nworking really really well for me over\nthe past year or so is this is the way I\nlike to think about it if you go into\nthe gym and you work out chances are you\ndon't work out and you're there for an\nhour chances are you're not working out\nin in straining your body all one hour\nthat you're there right it is a uh\nstrain and a rest for a minute a strain\nand a rest for a minute and a strain and\na rest for a minute that is actually how\nI plan out my days now and so what I\nfind is I can go from it's it's a lot\neasier to to go for for Sprints\nthroughout the day for me than it is to\ntry to act like it's a marathon like it\nhas been where it's like I got to have\nmy sympathetic nervous system and I got\nto be go go go go go for nine hours a\nday it's a lot easier if I'm go go go go\ngo for a Sprint and I get a whole lot\nmore done and I go further in that\nSprint for about 45 minutes to an hour\nand then I take about a 5 or 10 minute\nbreak and then I go go go go go for an\nhour and I take about a 5 or 10 minute\nbreak and I'll tell you what I do on\nthose breaks just to kind of help reset\nmy nervous system but really what it\ncomes down to is is taking that break to\nallowing my brain to rest for a minute\nto be alone with my thoughts because if\nyou were just go into the gym and you're\njust lift heavy the entire time you're\ngoing to weaken that muscle very quickly\nin that gym session that you have but if\nyou go go go go rest go go go go rest\nyou can lift a lot more reps it's the\nexact same thing is you can you can put\nin a whole lot more reps and more\nquality reps of work and getting things\ndone when it is Sprint rest Sprint\nrest and so it's it's basically the rest\nis just simply existing with nothing\nthat you have to do and now I know if I\nwere to rewind 10 years ago 15 years ago\nand try to tell this to Rob he would be\nlike that's the dumbest thing I've ever\nheard because those five or 10 minutes\noff I'm not being productive and that's\nthe way I used to have it in my head and\nI used to think that about meditation\nand I hear people say it all the time to\nme with meditation where it's like in\nthose 10 minutes of meditating I could\nhave been productive so it doesn't seem\nlike meditation is productive to me but\nif you can Sprint harder and further\nbecause of the fact that you\nrested doesn't that mean that the rest\nis a really important part of the Sprint\nof course it is the problem is is that\nwe think oh I'm not being productive oh\nI could be doing something else and so\nthis is really hard for a lot of people\nthis is really really hard for me just\nto give you an idea lots of people\nmyself included are go go go go go\nbecause they stru struggle with being\nalone with their thoughts they struggle\nto be able to turn it off you know for\nme it was a struggle to turn it on until\nI found something I was passionate about\nand then it was a struggle to turn it\noff and I was like damn what's the\nwhat's the the healthy balance that's\nwhat we all really need to find there\nwas a study that was done and I've said\nthis before in the podcast and they gave\npeople an option to either be alone with\ntheir thoughts for 15 minutes or get an\nelectric\nshock seems like it'd be a pretty simple\nchoice right be alone with your thoughts\nfor 15 minutes or choose electric shock\n30% of women chose electric shock\ninstead of being alone with their\nthoughts and 60% of men chose electric\nshock let that one like just think about\nlet one let that sink in for a\nsecond 30% of women would rather take an\nelectric shock than be alone with their\nthoughts for for 15 minutes and 60% of\nmen would rather take an electric shock\nthan be alone with their thoughts for 15\nminutes and you have to realize one\nthing that I I like to learn a lot from\nis nature we're a part of nature we are\nyou might live in a house but you we\nhumans come from nature and the world\ngoes through Seasons humans go through\nSeasons as well we go through Seasons\nthroughout our entire year where things\nare going good things are going bad\nthings are up things are down there's es\nand flows of Life all the time but\nthere's also es and flows of your day\nit's not spring forever it's not winter\nforever you know in the winter the trees\nand the plants have to lose their leaves\nand contract in order to expand and grow\nin the spring a tree has to grow has to\ncontract in order to grow and expand in\nthe spring right it has to contract it\nhas to lose its leaves but because of\nthe contraction it's able to grow\nstronger the next spring\nso everything expands and contracts\nexpands and contracts you can't always\nbe\nexpanding you can't you have to be\ncontracting at some point and so the\nsame way that there's some weeks that\nare amazing there's some weeks that are\nbad there's some days that are amazing\nthere's some days that are bad every day\nthat we have there's expansion there's\ncontraction there's expansion\ncontraction and rest can be a quick\n10-minute breath work or meditation in\nthe middle of the day uh I been on this\nkick for about the past eight months\nwhere I'm doing uh meditation and breath\nwork for about 15 minutes a day four to\nfive times a day just what it looks like\nfor me now you might go okay well hold\non if he does it four times a day and\nit's 15 minutes that's an hour of his\nday that could be productivity now you\nhave to understand when I get done with\nmy breath work and meditation and then I\ngo back into working I am way more\nproductive than if I just go from task\nto task to task to task\nmind you I understand as I'm saying this\nI can feel Rob 15 years ago being like\njust be productive like you just\ngot to be productive like just yelling\nat myself but Rob 15 years ago was a\nwhole lot less wise than than Rob is\nright now a whole lot less successful\nand I know a whole lot more and I can\ntell you that I get more done when it is\nSprint rest Sprint rest Sprint rest so\nit doesn't have to be 15 minutes\nactually in fact I would recommend don't\ndo 15 minutes like me at the beginning\njust try 5 minutes you can go on to\nYouTube and you can type in breath work\nfive minute breath work and you just do\nthat breath work and you use it as kind\nof like a reset where you don't have to\nbe doing things your eyes are closed\nyour brain can rest a little bit you can\nbreathe get more oxygen into your body\nbecause most people usually don't\nbreathe fully like we should we have\nreally shallow breath so we're not even\ngetting as much oxygen into our blood\nflow and so rest can be those little\nmini micro rest sessions throughout the\nday before you switch to another task\nyou get done with a meeting 7 minutes\nbefore your next meeting and you were\nexpecting to be in it okay give yourself\n5 minutes off close your eyes it could\nbe breath work it could be putting on a\nrelaxing song that's 5 minutes long and\nyou don't even have to put on a timer\nbecause when the song ends you know that\nyou're still good and you have you know\ntwo more minutes to get on your call\nrest can also be turn turning off work\nat 6:00 p.m. and enjoying your life and\ndeciding you know what I am working to\nbe able to grow myself but I'm also\nworking in order to be able to provide a\nlife for my family but I'm working so\ndamn much I'm not even living life with\nmy family you know I have a a friend who\nis uh pretty successful um he's run you\nknow he's exited I think seven or rate\nbusinesses at this point um and you know\na couple of them over $100 million doll\nyear businesses and um he said something\none time where he had ridiculously\nsuccessful businesses doing really well\nand he said that one night he came home\nafter midnight and his wife was still up\nand they already had all of the money\nall the things they needed and she said\nto him she said you can keep doing what\nyou want or you can keep doing what\nyou're doing but you can't pretend that\nyou're doing it for us anymore I was\nlike holy right where it's like she\ndidn't say you have to stop but what she\nsaid is you can't pretend the reason why\nyou're pushing so hard even even though\nyou have so much successes for the\nfamily anymore and so for some of you it\ncould be turning off at 600 p.m. and\nenjoying time with your family because\nthat rest being fully off of work or\nyour business will then make you better\nwhen you show up in the morning to run\nyour business rest can be planning a\nweekend trip with the family and not\ntaking your cell phone with you it's\nokay your wife has a cell phone if\nyou're or you're you're if you're the\nbusiness owner and you're the the wife\nthe your husband has a cell phone right\nyour partner has a cell phone I bet\ndon't bring yours I recently just went\non a a vacation in Mexico I didn't bring\nmy phone with me anywhere I left it\ninside of the safe because I was like\nI'm not going to do any of it and then\nwhen I came back I was like ready to go\nready to\nwork and then we think to ourselves and\nthe thought might be running through\nyour head but if I slow down won't I be\nless motivated I won't get to where I\nwant to be w't I be less motivated if I\njust kind of chill a little bit\nmore okay let me ask you a question is\nit easier to go for a run after a night\nof really good sleep or after a night of\nshitty\nsleep after a night of really good sleep\nwhy because you rested so if you turn\noff work you turn off your business at\n600 p.m. 7 p.m. whatever it is that you\nwant and you just disconnect fully\nyou're going to be more rested your\nbrain's going to be more rested from not\nhaving to think about the business all\nthe time so that when you go into the\noffice you're rested now I get it\nbecause I have been the guy many times\nthat's up working at 11:00 p.m. midnight\n1:00 a.m. CU I just have so much that I\ncould do there's always moments where\nyou could always if you're a business\nowner or if you're uh pretty high up in\na business you could be working all day\nlong you be working all night long\nbusinesses can all there's always\nsomething that can be done but if you\ndon't contract you're not going to be\nable to expand at the level that you can\none of the reasons if you've been stuck\nfor a while in your business I coach a\nlot of business owners one of the things\nI found is that if you are stuck in your\nbusiness right now if you've hit a glass\nceiling it's probably because of the\nfact that you haven't contracted so you\ncan't expand and so you're trying to\nexpand you're trying to expand but\nthere's nothing left the Tank's running\non E you got to give yourself a little\nbit of a break and you have to realize\nit's not taking a step back that's what\npeople think and so you've got to change\nyour mindset on it it's not taking a\nstep back it's like a bow and arrow\nyou've got in order for the arrow to be\nlaunched you have to pull the arrow back\nand the harder that you pull an arrow\nback the farther it's going to fly so\nit's not taking a step back it's pulling\nthe arrow back to shoot an arrow you got\nto pull it back and the further that you\npull it back the further that it flies\nwhich means when you turn off work even\nif it's just for five minutes multiple\ntimes throughout the day turn it off\ncompletely you're pulling the arrow back\nso that there therefore when you do go\nback into work or you do go back into\nyou know after that 5 minute break\nyou're able to be more productive study\nafter study after study after study\nafter study show that quick meditation\nsessions meditating throughout the day\nmakes you more\nproductive so when you go into work\ntomorrow you take that little bit of\nbreak it can fly further when you notice\nyourself midday not a 100% mentally\nthere in the situation in like in the in\nthe room and in and you're in a meeting\nand you're like I'm not here\nfully you got to look at it have you\nbeen go go go go go have you been in\nfull expansion mode do do you need a\nmoment of contraction for me there's\nmany different types of breath work and\none thing I'll recommend is I'm not a\nbreath work facilitator at all but you\ncan go on to YouTube right now and type\nin 10 minute energy breath work to get\nsome energy from it and you can get you\ncan relax from breath work and there's\nthere's definitely ones for that and you\ncan do energy for breath work if you\ndon't feel like you've got as much\nenergy maybe you just need a quick break\nif you don't feel like you're 100% there\nin the middle of the day sometimes your\nbrain just needs to file things away\nwhen you go to sleep there's a part of\nyour brain called the hippocampus that\nreplays the entire day and files things\naway and it files them away 30 to 60\ntimes more than they happen throughout\nthe day so you know one thing happens\nit's like and it files it away 30 to 60\ntimes so that it's basically locking it\ninto your brain over and over and over\nagain but when you actually start to sit\ndown and you close your eyes and you do\njust a a a quick rest session your brain\nwill start to file things away 20 times\nfaster and so it actually allows your\nbrain to not be so overthinking to not\nhave so much in it but it allows it\nstart to file it away when you take\nthese breaks a quick meditation or just\ngoing out with going outside without\nyour phone staring into the distance\njust staring at a tree doing breath work\ndoing a\nquick meditation allows your brain to be\nable to rest and start to file things\naway so if your brain's going crazy\nthroughout the day and you can't stop\noverthinking\nmaybe you need to file some things away\nmaybe you need to give your brain a\nlittle bit of a break and then come back\na little bit more productive so trust me\nI understand I get it because Rob back\nin 2006 2007 2008 2009 would been like\nthis doesn't make any sense Rob now is\nlike this works there's studies that\nshow it and I know I have my own\nanecdotal evidence that it works for me\nas well so give it a shot give yourself\na quick 5 minute 10-minute break\nmultiple times throughout the day and\nyou're going to see those little rest\nsessions allow you to Sprint quicker\nfaster longer and be more productive in\nthe times when you sit down and work so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories tag\nme in at Rob dial Jr r o d a l Jr and\nI'm going leave the same way I leave you\nevery single episode make it your\nmission make somebody else's day better\nI appreciate you and I hope that you\nhave an amazing day"
