    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to go on a mental diet\nand to get rid of anything that is not\nhelping you inside of your brain to make\ncreating the life that you want to a\nlittle bit easier let's dive in today\nI'm going to be talking to you about\nyour diet I'm not going to be talking to\nyou about the diet the food that goes\ninto your body I'm going to talk about\neverything else that you consume I'm\ngoing to talk about your mental diet and\num I thought about this episode I was\nalready thinking about this episode and\nthen my chiropractor came and was\nworking on me uh this week and uh we\nstarted talking about a mental diet and\nthe the what we consume and and I want\nyou to just just think about this for a\nsecond let's let's go back to food right\nimagine that you eat shitty food all day\nlong like you eat just the worst food\nthat you possibly can lots of Grease\nlots of sugar all of that and you start\nfrom the morning you eat it afternoon\neat it dinner eat it how is that going\nto make you feel do you think that there\nis a possibility that if you wake up and\nyou have a shitty breakfast and you have\na a greasy gross breakfast that's really\nhigh in carbs and really high in sugar\nis it going to affect you and your\nenergy throughout the day is it going to\ncarry with you the rest of the day is\nthere any way that you could eat that\nshitty food and it would have no effect\non you at all no absolutely not you know\nhopefully that when you eat something\nit's going to affect you in a positive\nor negative way right now I want you\nunderstand that there's not really much\nof a difference between the food that\nyou consume and everything else that you\nconsume I get a lot of people that come\nto me and they send me messages on\nInstagram and I read a lot of Instagram\nmessages and I try to help people um as\nmuch as I can and you know if there's an\nepisode that's help them that they've\nthat they asked me about and I'm like\nhey you could go listen to this this\nmight actually help you but so many\npeople want to improve their lives uh\nbut they won't work on themselves or\nthey put in the work on themselves\nexcuse me but they never actually check\ntheir environment they never check\neverything else so they're like oh I'm\ntrying to grow myself I'm reading books\nI'm going to conferences and then I\nstarted talking to them a little bit\nmore and I realized like everything else\nbesides them in their environment is all\nover the place and it makes it it's not\nimpossible to become the person that you\nwant to become or um you know impossible\nto to fix your mindset when you're in an\nenvironment that's terrible it's not\nimpossible but it is much harder that's\nfor sure you are a product of your\nenvironment you think how other people\nthink around you and whatever else you\nend up consuming and there's a lot of\nstuff that you might be consuming at\nthis moment uh that aren't really\nhelping you in many ways and in fact\nmight actually be holding you back from\nbecoming the person that you want to\nbecome you know the good thing is is\nyou're listening to this podcast so\nhopefully you're listening to this\npodcast and and other podcasts and\ntrying to put information into your\nbrain that will help you become who you\nwant to\nbecome I personally try not to allow\nmyself to be influenced by anything\noutside of what I want to be influenced\nby like for instance when I wake up in\nthe morning the very first thing that I\ndo after I brush my teeth after I go to\nthe bathroom after I drink water is I\nalways do my breath work in my\nmeditation and I have noticed you know\nI'll go on to YouTube and I and I listen\nto breath work and meditations on\nYouTube YouTube and that's how I I do it\nevery single morning you know sometimes\nyou go to the homepage of YouTube and\nthey have something really interesting\nlike you know I'm like oh man like\nLauren's not here yet she just went to\nthe bathroom let me go ahead and and\nlook at this brand new Lamborghini that\njust came out or whatever it might be\nand I'll click on the Lamborghini and\nit's a a 45 second short video that's on\nYouTube and then I'm in the middle of my\nmeditation and 15 minutes later I think\nof a Lamborghini or I think of the car\nthat just popped up or I think of\nwhatever it is that I just watched and\nand I think to myself\nwhatever I wake up in the morning and I\nlook at something or I talk to someone\nor I uh see something on Instagram\nwhatever it is that it might be I am\nallowing that thing to own a piece of my\nbrain for the rest of the day because it\npops back up it's just like you know\nit's part of your articular activating\nsystem at that point in time like if I\nsay hey you know let let me know how\nmany red cars you see on your drive to\nwork today you're going to notice all\nthe red cars but if I don't say it\nyou're not going to notice those red\ncars and so it's part of your ticular\nactivate system your brain will look for\nanything that it's been you know\nconditioned to look for throughout the\nday and so there's no way that I could\nuh I could watch terrible TV and trash\nTV and follow people on Instagram and\nsee that in the morning and not be\ninfluenced by it the rest of the day or\nhave it take I I see it as stealing a\npiece of property in my brain for the\nday and you start to think about it\nyou're like do I want that person that I\nfollow on Instagram to own a piece of my\npiece of property in my brain\ntoday and so the way I like to think\nabout is I don't allow myself at this\npoint anymore to be influenced anymore\nbefore a meditation and so I try to keep\nmy phone off for a couple hours after I\nwake up I don't want to think about work\nI don't want to get text messages I\ndon't want to look at emails I don't\nwant to look at Instagram none of those\nthings and so I want you start to think\nabout I'm going to go through with you\nsome of the things that you might be\nconsuming that you might not even know\nare really affecting you so the first\nthing obviously uh is the news I have a\na friend whose grandma is so fearful and\nI've known her for a while and every\ntime I see her she thinks the world is\ncrumbling like absolutely going to\nlike she's so fearful and I ended up\nfinding out I was like man your\ngrandma's so fearful why is she always\nso afraid and talking about oh this is\nso scary that's happening in the world\nand oh that's so scary he's like every\ntime I go to her house she has a news on\nand she has a news on all day long and\nwe tell her stop watching the news and\nshe won't stop watching the news and she\nhas become afraid to leave the house\nbecause the news makes this poor lady\nthink that the world is completely\nterrible and she needs to be afraid all\nof the time so she's afraid to leave the\nhouse you know she's in her late 80s\nalmost 9s so when she was younger the\nnews was trustworthy now it's not really\ntrustworthy what you decide to follow\nand the the the news that you decide to\nbring into your brain is saying Hey I\nwant this to own a piece of real estate\nin my brain if that's what you want\ncompletely fine I understand if that's\nwhat you want but if it's not what you\nwant maybe you should start to reassess\nit's completely cool and once again\nthere is no right or wrong it's\ncompletely up to you and what it is that\nyou want I know it is that I want now\nyou just need to figure out like what\ndoes it do how do I want to be\ninfluenced how do I want to be thinking\nthroughout the day do I feel myself very\nFe very fearful when I leave the house\noh my am I listening to something that's\nmaking me fearful and I'm am I following\npeople that are making me fearful just\nsomething to think about another thing\nthat you want to start thinking about is\nother people that are around you people\nthat you surround yourself with just\nthink about the people that you surround\nyourself with you know there's the\nphrase and I'm sure you've heard it\nbefore I've heard it a 100 thousand\ntimes which is you are the average of\nthe five people that you spend the most\ntime\nwith you literally become the people\nthat you spend the most time with so I\nwant you to look at the people that you\nspend the most time with and you know\noutside of your your family and your\nyour children and your wife and husband\nor whatever it might be and your your\nfriends and look at your friends and say\nyou know are these people helping me\ngrow and helping me get to who I want to\nbe or are they holding me back in some\nsort of way and just start thinking\nabout and you don't have to just cut\npeople out of your life or say oh no I\ndon't want to be around that person but\njust start thinking about who you spend\ntime with and the other people that are\naround you right think about the people\nthat you surround yourself with are they\nhelping you become the best version of\nyourself are they hurting you you know\nwhen you have a success do these people\ncelebrate you or are they trying to poke\nholes in all of your success you know I\nhear sometimes where people people say\nthat the the people that they're closest\nto their boyfriend their girlfriend\nsometimes they'll they'll want to\ncelebrate something with them and they\nthat person just talks about their\nthe the thing that the win that they\njust had in their life that's\ncrazy I don't know about you guys like I\nwant the people I surround myself with I\nwant to be able to build them up and I\nalso want to be built up I want to feel\nbetter I want people to celebrate with\nme and um you know if you're having\npeople around you don't that don't\ncelebrate your successes or bring it\ndown maybe you should just re-evaluate\nthat relationship and uh you know see if\nit's really helping you uh next thing\nyou want to think about as well that's\nsuper super important is your social\nmedia right like for me uh who you're\nfollowing is is super super important\nlike for me I'll just be honest with you\nguys I am spending less and less and\nless time on social media um I am only\ngetting on to it uh because of the fact\nthat I have business that I run on it\nand I also put you know content out\nthere because I want to impact the world\nI know most people are going to social\nmedia and so instead of avoiding it I'm\ntrying to put out content to hopefully\nhelp other people that are out there um\nif I didn't have any business uh that\nwas running on social media and I wasn't\nputting out content to help people I\nwould definitely 100% not be on social\nmedia at all I would have no accounts\nand so the reason why is because I just\njust don't see the value in it anymore\nif I'm being honest with you but if\nyou're going to be on social media have\nyou taken an assessment of who you're\nfollowing on social media because when\nyou follow someone you are allowing them\nto once again own and occupy a part of\nyour brain so you know I said this a\ncouple years ago probably I noticed that\nI was I was feeling kind of like\none day and I wasn't feeling really good\nI was like man I feel like kind of\nanxious I don't feel good I feel kind of\nsad like I don't know what's going on\nand I thought about and I was like oh my\ngosh there's people whose stories I was\nlooking at when you know the world was\nkind of crazy and they were just it was\nDoom and Gloom and then it was this side\nagainst that side and I was like I got\nto start unfollowing people and that day\nI unfollowed like 600 people cuz I was\nlike I'm just not going to follow these\npeople anymore because I've noticed that\njust seeing a 15-second story from this\nperson makes me feel worse and I had no\nidea before then and so you have to\nrealize that when you're following\nsomeone on social media you are in a way\nsaying I want to allow this person to\nhelp me or hurt me in the way that I\nthink I I'm going to take part of what\nthey say and how they act and I'm going\nto put into my brain and so you've got\nto take it real serious what it is that\nyou're putting into your brain and what\nyou're consuming when you think of\nreality TV right like what TV are you\nwatching are you watching reality TV\nlike that's that's one of the trashiest\nmental diets that you could be on and uh\nand I have you know I've had this\nconversation with my wife before too\nwhere she's like oh it's not really that\nbig of a deal and I was like it is kind\nof a big deal because you're watching\npeople treat each other this way like\nyou can't think that that doesn't\ninfluence you in some sort of way\nthroughout the day\nyou can't think that doesn't influence\nyou there's there's no way to think that\nwatching trashy TV doesn't influence\nyour brain in any sort of\nway right and so it doesn't it's it's\nlike eating you can't just eat fast food\nand it doesn't and it goes in and\nnothing happens it's the exact same\nthing you can't just watch things you\ncan't just talk to people you can't see\npeople yell at each other or drama and\nall that stuff and not think that that\ndoesn't affect you in some sort of way\nthroughout the day and affect you in the\nway you feel you know and so you got to\nstart to think about that like what what\nis it about is this is this thing that\nI'm consuming because I am deciding to\nput it into my body I'm not physically\nputting it into my body like I do when I\neat but I'm deciding I'm I'm actually\nconsuming and putting this thing into my\nmind is this TV show is this news is\nthis stuff that I'm watching helping or\nhurting me in any sort of way you have\nto understand that there is not a huge\ndifference in the the way that you can\nthe food that you consume and the and\nthe diet that you're on physically and\nthe the food that you put in your mouth\nand the the the the mental food that you\nconsume with who you surround yourself\nwith who you follow on social media how\nyou act um the reality TV the news all\nof that stuff it's going to affect you\nin some sort of way so for me like I'm\nvery here's another big thing the music\nthat you listen to right I love some\nsome music that is trash music sometimes\nand I'll list to it sometimes I'm not\ncompletely off it sometimes you got to\ngive yourself a little little snack if\nyou want to you know when when you've\nbeen really good with your diet and so\nit's okay it's not a huge thing but also\njust just be a little bit more aware\nwhen you're listening to music and the\nstuff that you're repeating out loud the\nwords that you're the the lyrics that\nyou're repeating out loud because lyrics\nin a song essentially that you're saying\nout loud are like affirmations So when\nyou say those things out loud is that\nhow you want to think about yourself is\nthat how you want to think about other\npeople is that how you want to think\nabout the world if it is awesome but if\nit's not maybe there is something that\naffects the way that you you know you\nthink and feel like for me like I have\nch made a big change recently and\nstarted listening to a lot of uh there's\nmusic where they'll take uh great\nphilosophers and you know spiritual\nteachers and all that stuff and they'll\nput it over slow EDM type music and so\nit's music and you're listening to it\nit's got a little bit of a beat to it\nbut you're also listening to to a uh a\ngreat philosopher or somebody who in my\nmind has a pretty good grip on life and\nthe way that it is and I'm allowing that\nto come into my brain and so the same\nway that you are what you eat you are\nwhat you consume and you're always\nconsuming something the only time you're\nnot consuming something is if you're\nsitting down and it's completely silent\nthat's way more important than consuming\nanything in my opinion but when you sit\ndown and you you decide to to read\nsomething or to to scroll through inst\nor to watch something on the news or to\ngo to a website or to put on a song you\nare allowing a part of your brain to be\noccupied by that thing that you are\ndoing it doesn't just go in and go out I\npromise you that and so if you want to\nchange who you are and the way that you\nact and who you surround yourself with\nstart to go through and just make an\nassessment and once again you don't have\nto get completely rid of everything if\nyou don't want to but I would start to\nscale back on the things that you feel\nare not helping you if it doesn't serve\nyou maybe you should spend a little bit\nless time with it so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in at Rob\ndial Jr r o b d a l Jr and that's the\nonly way that we really grow and uh\nimprove and impact more people's lives\nso you know if you've ever gotten any\nvalue from this podcast I would greatly\nappreciate if you would go ahead and\nshare it so that more people could find\nit who have never listened to it before\nand with that I'm going leave you the\nsame way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomeone else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
