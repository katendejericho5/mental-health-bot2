much more than\nthat it it's loyalty and it's being\ncapable of building something together\nand it's having a great teammate and\nit's having someone who who shows up for\nyou on the good and the bad days do we\nhave someone who is capable of\nevolving that to me is the biggest\nquestion welcome everybody to the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so you never miss\nanother episode and I'm excited today\nI'm in the house of Matthew hussy and\nwe're going to be talking about his\nbrand new book that is called love life\nhow to raise standards find your person\nand live happily no matter what I've\nknown about you for a long time man I'm\nexcited to sit down and uh and meet you\nand get some time to talk to you yeah\nthe feeling is mutual I've uh I've known\nabout your podcast for a long time\ncongratul on it thanks ma'am and\ncongrats on this book that's going to be\ncoming out I uh I want to talk to you\nabout we we're talking right before we\nstarted about um it's really interesting\nI think you you kind of started off\ntalking about like how to get the guy\nand you have a lot of female followers\nand about 65% of the people who follow\nme are women and so I think it's going\nto be really it's going to hit home with\na lot of women that are out there of how\nto um you know be better in their\nrelationships how to find somebody but I\nhave a really stereotypical question to\nstart us off with but I'm really curious\nyour answer on it so my wife and I were\ndriving a couple months ago we were\ntalking about a relationship that one of\nher friends is in uh and she doesn't\nreally want to be married anymore but\nshe doesn't want to get out of the\nrelationship and um she's kind of in\nthat stuck place that a lot of people\nfind themselves right and um and I said\nshe she said well you know what though\nshe really loves him and I go yeah but\nis she in love with him and she goes\nwell what does that mean and so we had a\nreally deep conversation around like\nwhat the difference between Love Like\nLoving somebody and being in love with\nsomebody and I'm curious your\nperspective as someone who's been a\ndating coach and and done this for over\n15 years what's the difference between\njust loving a person and being in love\nwith somebody\nromantically oh big one to\nstart I\nuh that's a great question because in\nlove is a it's a very emotive term and\nit's also it could be a very dangerous\nterm depending on how it's\napplied you know there are the people\nthat chase this very you know this high\nthat they get at the beginning of a\nrelationship and there's this desire to\nsustain that and the kinds of highs that\nwe're often trying to sustain aren't\nalways the healthiest highes or even if\nthey're not unhealthy they're not always\nsustainable at least in that form\nthere's a difference you know the the\nit's a bit like I don't know the if you\ntake the Olympics mhm the people who run\nthe 100 meters are trained to run 100\nmet and it's fast twitch muscle yeah but\nthen there's the\nendurance uh training that is required\nfor a marathon and if someone tried to\nSprint their way through a marathon oh\nyeah it would be it would be over very\nfast so you kind of com I think you have\nto be very careful about comp comparing\nwhat is an endurance sport of long-term\nrelationships to that fast\ntwitch excitement of a 100 meter fling\nor you know a relationship that maybe\nlasts a year and and one of the I think\none of the dangers in general is\nthat people compare what they feel in a\nstable and I'm not suggesting that's\nwhat your mutual friend is doing but\npeople compare the what they feel in a\npeaceful healthy relationship to what\nthey felt when they met someone on\nvacation mhm and it just felt like it\nhad all the promise of something perfect\nright or even not just a vacation\nromance but a romance that lasted a few\nmonths the the number of people that I\ncoach in my line of work that are have\ncreated a story around how right someone\nwas was for them that they had an\nincredibly passionate\n3mon kind of I suppose we'd call it\nrelationship a situationship fling\nwhatever word you want to use but a\npassionate Kind of Love Affair for 3\nmonths and then that person disappeared\ndecided that they weren't ready to\ncommit decided that they really wanted\nto focus their attention on their work\nor on traveling or on something else and\nthen they look back and they go but that\nwas my person that was it felt so right\nI've never felt a connection like that\nbefore and the the truth is a long-term\nrelationship is just so much more than\nthat yeah it's you\nknow it's loyalty and it's being capable\nof building something together and it's\nhaving a great teammate and it's having\nsomeone who who shows up for you on the\ngood and the bad days someone you feel\ntruly supported by someone who sees you\nsome who genuinely sees you and gets you\nand can make space for your darker sides\nthat come out when you're actually being\nvulnerable in a relationship instead of\ntrying to be impressive all the time\nright and and by the way probably in 3\nmonths you don't even know their darker\nside you don't know who they are really\nyou just know the impact they've made\nthere's a big difference\nbetween the you know genuine character\nof a relationship and who someone is in\nthat relationship and the impact someone\ncan make\nin a short space of time early on impact\nis not character and someone comes off\nof a date and they go I had the greatest\ndate it was incredible I just feel like\nthere's something real here and it's\nlike what you know and I'm not this\nisn't me being cynical it doesn't mean\nthat that date might not lead to\nsomething very serious down the line but\nit's not something you should take too\nseriously right now because you don't\nknow that person's character character\ncan only be measured over time all you\nknow is the impact they have made\nso I say that just to set up the context\nof when people are in\nrelationships and they are longing for\nsome kind of you know I want to\nre-experience that high I want to\nre-experience that\npassion I think we have to put things in\ntheir proper place which is it there's a\ndifferent kind of energy required to run\na marathon now that's not me saying you\nshouldn't have passion in a longterm\nrelationship it's not me saying you\nshouldn't have chemistry with your\npartner and and I think\nthat it's worth assessing is the amount\nif I'm deep into a\nmarriage and it feels like there's a lot\nto lose here but I also don't feel\nsatisfied MH I think it's worth asking\nis the amount of passion and\nchemistry and love that I have right now\nenough to sustain me over the rest of my\nlife and if the answer is no I I just\ncan't be happy in a relationship that\nhas this level of Love chemistry\npassion\nthen\nokay have I done anything to try to to\ncreate that you know when I look back on\nthe last say three years or even just\nthe last year of our relationship\nhave we done anything to Foster that\nyeah and the answer from your partner's\nside might be no but the answer from\nyour side might also be no M\nand when you're deep into something\nbefore we tear down the house unless\nit's a truly abusive relationship in\nwhich case there's a different answer\nbut if it's just if you're not sure if\nit's good enough MH\nthen I think looking at a period of time\nwhere you say what would it look like if\nI genuinely tried to create the kind of\npassion and chemistry and love that I\nwant to have in this relationship and\nthat can't be you know 5 years yeah cuz\nthat's too long but it probably isn't\none month yeah so I think figuring out\nthat amount of time that you actually\ngive your all to it and you also ask the\nsame of the other person because I think\nyou can get through a hell of a lot\ntogether if you have someone else who is\nalso an incredible teammate in trying to\ncreate an amazing relationship that's\nwhy I think one of the greatest values\nin any relationship is just teamwork\nyeah if you have someone who highly\nvalues teamwork you're going to be okay\nin a lot of ways because even if you're\ndifferent and even if you come up\nagainst struggles and\nconflict you're going to be able to\nsolve problems together and I think that\nwhat she's articulating is problem it's\nlike a it's a challenge but then do I\nhave someone who's coming to the table\naccepting that challenge and and we both\nsit together and go hey let's bring our\nall to this there's something missing\nright now from our\nrelationship I'm not as happy as I want\nto be yeah I feel like there's something\nspecial that along the way we have you\nknow detached from or we've you know\nlost sight of and I want us to bring it\nback back mhm and look in 6 months or\neven in 3 months you'll have a better\nidea of a whether that's possible but on\nan even more fundamental level you'll\nhave a sense of whether the person\nyou're with cares at all about trying\nright to bring that back with you and\nthat is that's almost a bigger question\nto me in some ways because what the the\nreal dead end is if you say that to\nsomeone and they look at you you like\nyou're a crazy person or they look at\nyou with indifference or they pretend\nthat it's not there because that that\nthen is a real problem cuz what you\ncan't have in a relationship is one\nperson trying to solve a problem right\nand the other one being like if I just\nignore this it will go away right or I\ndon't really care that you're unhappy\nI'm fine M and I don't want to do\nanything that that is a real problem and\nthen you've got a then I think you've\ngot an even bigger question Mark than\nthe one you brought to the table at\nfirst yeah so it's a long-winded answer\nno it's it's really good there's a\nthere's so many questions that come from\nthat that are really intriguing to me so\none of the things that I'm I'm really\ncurious of I and I get a lot of messages\nbecause obviously everything I do is is\nmindset self-development and what you're\ntalking about specifically is both of\nthe partners coming to the table and\nsaying we want to work on this thing\nwhich I think is really important um\nbecause if one person doesn't show up\nthen you kind of have your answer of of\nwhat how that person's going to be for\nthe your life uh one question that I get\na lot that's very similar to that it's\nnot necessarily specifically on the\nrelationship and I'm really curious your\nthoughts on this people will start\nlistening to my podcast and like I want\nto start working on myself they're\nworking on for three months 6 months a\nyear and they're like I really want my\nhusband I really want my wife to start\ngetting into person I really want her to\nstart growing and uh and there's a lot\nof resistance most times of like they\ndon't want to change I'm curious in your\nthoughts do you think that it's possible\nfor someone to be like really into\nwanting to learn and grow themsel and\nchange thems and the other partner being\nlike I just want everything to stay\nexactly the same do you think that that\nthat that's a a relationship that can\nlast um I'm just curious your your\nthoughts on it personally with that it's\na great\nquestion I get this question all the\ntime Matthew all the time so like you're\ngonna you're GNA answer like thousands\nof people's relationship questions with\nthis specifically so I'll comment it\nfrom two angles okay one is if we remove\nlike\nself-development yeah as a kind\nof I don't know\na an entire kind of world of books and\npodcasts and this that and if we remove\nthat from the equation and we just say\ndo we have someone who is capable of\nevolving that to me is the biggest\nquestion yeah can this person evolve are\nare they willing to be more self-aware\ndo they take\nself-awareness seriously and\nself-awareness isn't their willing to\nread the books I'm reading yeah\nself-awareness is they are someone\nwho looks at themselves in the context\nof the conversation we're having and\nsays that's an interesting thing you\njust said you know it's challenging to\nme because that you know you've just\nsaid something that you know you've just\ntalked about something that you wish\nthat I could do differently or that\nyou've said something that you think is\naffecting our relationship can I put\neyes on\nmyself and try to improve that that to\nme is its own thing\nand that doesn't have to have anything\nto do with this person being interested\nin the same kind of tranches right of\nself-development you are they don't I\nthink it's unreasonable to expect\nsomeone to care about the podcast yeah\nthat we care about or to care that\nbecause we read a book on you know\nchildhood trauma that suddenly is top of\nmind for us because we read it last need\nto read the childhood trauma book yeah\nlike you now need to care about this\nlike them reading a book on golf yeah\nand being like you now have to care\nabout this you know like you need to\ncome on golfing L golfing sessions with\nme now and and and almost I'm just I'm\nthinking of this in real time but\nif if they just read a book on Golf and\nthey want you to care about that that's\nunreasonable right but it's reasonable\nfor them to want a partner that cares\nabout their\nhealth or about being active mhm because\nin a relationship where one person cares\nabout health and being active and the\nother one is at the Other Extreme of\njust constantly you know damaging their\nbody or doing being extremely\nunhealthy that is going to create some\nkind of conflict M even in the kind of\nsense of like hey you're i' I'm doing\nall of these things to try to maybe be\nmy best for you or I'm trying to do all\nthese things to try and make sure I live\nas long as possible and I feel like\nyou're not you're not and you know I'm\ngoing to lose you far sooner if we're\nnot careful then you're going to lose me\nand that's you know I don't want that\nand there's there's like deep Rifts that\ncan come from that even in the way you\nraise children right but you don't have\nto care about golf right and so I I\nthink that the reason I say this is\nbecause I think there is sometimes\npeople get lost in the self-development\nworld right and they start thinking that\nanyone who hasn't read this book there's\na bit of a like oh you haven't read that\nbook you don't know about attachment\nTheory oh well you know it's like they\nthis person might be one of the wisest\npeople you've ever met and they've never\nread any of the books you're talking\nabout because they've live the life and\nthey pay attention and they're bringing\nthis beautiful experience to the table\nand this wisdom to the table and and and\nso I I just sometimes I hear people and\nit always like makes me like just tense\nup ever so slightly because I'm like I\nwhen I hear people say you know I just\nI'm doing all of this self-growth work\nand they're not yeah it's like well\nthat's good for you but by the way were\nyou doing that 3 years ago right were\nyou even doing it a year ago like it's\nas soon as something's top of mind for\nus we're like everyone needs to care\nabout this and why haven't you read this\nand it's something like it's all over\nour Instagram and it you know we it's\nworth having some\ncompassion for someone who maybe isn't\nat that place in the journey yet or\nhasn't even you know doesn't learn in\nthat same way mhhm because in a way\nthat's a form of having compassion for\nourselves 5 years ago yeah or 10 years\nago before we'd discovered any of that\nwe wouldn't have wanted to be written\noff at a time when we hadn't approached\ncertain\nthings but and it's a giant\nbut if you get the sense that the person\nyou're with has zero\ncuriosity and curiosity is a value\nthat's important to you if they have\nzero openness and openness is a value\nthat's really important to you because\nyou're a very open person if\nself-awareness is not something they\nvalue if being you know having\nconversations with\nyou about just different subjects you're\nnot asking them to go read the book you\njust want to have a conversation about\nthe things you're learning because\nyou're excited about it if they can't if\nthey're not interested in taking an\ninterest\nin things that matter to you yeah then I\nthink those things become the much\nbigger issue so yes someone who's growth\noriented matters\nimmensely I don't want anyone to come\naway from this answer going also I can\nbe with someone who's not growth\noriented no it matters immensely but\nhave compassion for people who haven't\ndone the exact same reading or learning\nas you because it doesn't mean they're\nnot bringing something beautiful to the\ntable and it doesn't mean they might you\nknow if you've over indexed in a certain\narea mhm where you know you you've done\na lot of therapy and a lot of this a lot\nof that and you can you are fluent in\nthose subjects\nMH well make sure you're paying\nattention to a wisdom or a way of seeing\nthe world or a\nlife that you have no reference points\nfor sure that brings an awful lot to the\ntable just in a a different way you know\nevery wise person isn't on Instagram\nyeah most of them aren't actually um you\nbring up a really good point which is\nthere's a phrase that I always I\nremember which is the most righteous are\nthe newly converted that's why I feel\nlike most people are you know um and so\nI think the the biggest thing to\ndistinguish from what you said is it's\nnot that they have to be interested in\nself-development just the same way that\nthey you don't have to be interested in\ngolf but if there are certain aspects of\nthe the relationships that you want to\ngrow and improve do they have the\nself-awareness of they want to also\nimprove it as well and also I guess the\nwillingness to want to deepen the\nconnection if there happens to be\nsomething that's kind of wedging in\nbetween the two of you yeah that's\nexactly right and I think to that extent\nto sum both of those questions up\nteamwork and and growth are I think two\nof the most beautiful values and perhaps\ntwo of the biggest pred iors of the\nsuccess of a relationship is is those\ntwo qualities yeah yeah it's it's funny\nwhen you say that cuz you know I've been\nI've been so into like working on myself\nand trying to heal my traumas and stuff\nfor a long time and with my wife we've\nbeen together for 10 years now and I\ntried to buy her the books and I was\nlike go to the conferences with me and\nshe just wasn't reading it and then I I\nwas like all right I guess she just\ndoesn't care no big deal I guess that's\nnot her thing and then about five years\ninto our relationship she just really\ngot into it came out of nowhere you know\nand it was just like just worked the way\nthat it was but we have an amazing\nrelationship now and I can't imagine had\nI been like well she's just not\ninterested in the same thing that I'm\ninterested in this isn't going to work\nout you know and giving up within those\nF first five years when she wasn't into\nit yeah I I think that's a really really\ninteresting point and the you know makes\nme think the the\ngreatest uh the greatest transference of\nanything you've learned is just the way\nthat you are and if you have done all of\nthis work on yourself that makes you\nmore peaceful for example cuz you used\nto be you know a very anxious person all\nthe time and\nconstantly afraid of things or stressing\nabout things and now all of a sudden\nthere's just a very peaceful energy\nabout you people are going to ask you\nhow you did that right it's like when\nyou lose weight and people like how' you\ndo it how' you do it yeah you didn't for\nthat's exactly right you didn't need to\ntell them about a program up front just\npeople are like that's amazing and and I\nthink the same is true of our energy you\nknow we think about it in in weight loss\nterms it's a very literal pH you know\nvisual representation of change but we\nforget sometimes just how much someone's\nenergy shifting is how powerful that is\nand when you're in a room with it could\nbe a family member at Christmas mhm when\nyou're in a someone comes who you\nhaven't seen in a while and they come to\nChristmas dinner and there's just a\ndifferent energy about them MH you want\nto know like what H are you good like\nwhat happened that's some you seem like\nyou're in a really good place you seem\nmore powerful you seem more grounded and\nyou kind of you know people who aren't\ncurious people will you know not care or\nthey may even try and R you up a little\nbit because they don't you know it just\nmade them feel uncomfortable that you've\nchanged but but curious people will want\nto know like that's amazing I I want\nmore of that yeah and when you want more\nof something that someone else has you\nyou do want to start knowing who did\nthey go to what did they read what are\nthey looking at and that's to me that's\nthe greatest that's the greatest sales\nthat can ever happen in a relationship\nthe greatest sale that could ever happen\nin a relationship is just your partner\nis impressed with who you're becoming\nand at a certain point someone's going\nto look at you and you know the C the\nright kind of person's going to look at\nyou and go I want some of that for\nmyself\nor even I I need to step up my game a\nlittle here cuz I feel like we're out of\nsync you're in a really good place and\nI'm the one who's yeah kind of dragging\nbehind so I think there's also in a in a\npositive way there can be a little bit\nof that too in a relationship and if\nyou're the person that then says without\nany sense of I Told You So if you're\njust the person that says I can give you\ntheir number or if you want to do it I\nthis is where I started and I really\nloved it you know if you can come to it\nwith that kind of Grace and\nand generosity and humility that's a\nbeautiful thing but I think when we're\ntrying to pass TOS to each other there's\na gross lack of humility a lot of the\ntime oh yeah for sure in the uh in the\nfirst answer that when we were first\ntalking you said uh you had brought up\nlike having a fling with somebody in\nthree months and how we can make it to\nbe this amazing thing and I'm I'm really\ncurious to this\nquestion what do you think\nmakes what do you think makes it so hard\nwhen you're in a relationship with\nsomebody and there's unrequited love\nlike why is that so hard for us why is\nthat so addicting why does why do we\nwhen we feel rejected we have to go for\nthat person what's what's the reason\nbehind that I think there's\num I I like to think of it in a couple\nof different ways so there's the\nchildhood trauma response mhm that's\nhappening where if we were abandoned\nif we were made to feel like we had to\nearn someone's love in childhood\nyeah there is this pattern that it sets\nup for our nervous system it's not even\na conscious pattern it's just a we our\nnervous system becomes wired in a\ncertain\nway and you know you you take a example\nof a child who felt like they had to\nearn love and then every time they did\nthe thing whatever it was their parents\nsuddenly showered them with praise and\nlove and it's that kind of Link\nsomething up oh I I need to do all of\nthese things in order to be worthy of\nlove you know if you had a parent that\ndisappeared in terms of either\nphysically or disappeared just in terms\nof their love towards you MH and then\nyou you were anxious and you were scared\nand of course when we're at that age it\nreally is like like that's Survival you\nyou really feel like oh I'm going to die\nif I don't have this love mhm these are\nthe people that are taking care of me or\nkeeping me alive in the world when\nsomeone\ndisappears and then they return and all\nof a sudden they give you love it's like\nyeah you can breathe again I'm okay I'm\nokay I'm safe oh my god it feels so good\nand so that sets up a pattern for people\ntheir nervous system becomes wired for\nthat and if and that oh that's what love\nis so now later in life You' got someone\nwho is inconsistent with their messages\nmhm or with the attention they give you\nand you get anxious and scared and you\nfeel like you're going to die if this\nperson doesn't text me back what I'm I'm\nyou know how am I going to get through\nthis I can't sleep I can't eat I can't\ndo anything I'm and then all of a sudden\nthey say what are you up to tonight out\nof nowhere oh God I can breathe again\nokay and my oh my God I I really like\nthis person yeah it's it's you know our\nnervous system recogniz it recognizes it\nand it doesn't mean it makes us happy\nbut it's familiar and when something is\nfamiliar like that it you know that's\nwhat we gravitate towards I talk about\nthis in the book that that there's a a\nchapter that I write called there's two\ntwo of my favorite chapters there\nthere's they live together they could\nalmost I feel like they could be a\nlittle book on their own but there's a a\nchapter called um uh never\nsatisfied and then there's a following\nchapter after that called how to rewire\nyour brain mhm and never satisfied the\nkind of Crux of that chapter is we when\nwe go through our love lives feeling\nlike we're just never happy I'm either\nwith someone who excites me who\ndevastates me yeah or I'm with someone\nwho feels like the things I should be\ngoing after but BS me to\ntears and I just never find happiness\nanywhere and you know when people feel\nthat there's a kind of desperation that\ncomes it's like you know Copus rolling\nthe boulder up the mountain and\nconstantly getting away from him there's\na um cus uh wrote a lifetime of futile\nlabor is like the worst kind of\npunishment because it we become\nhopeless and it's for so many people in\ntheir love lives they become hopeless\nbecause they're like nothing works I'm\neither getting my heartbroken or I'm\nconstantly doubting if this person is\nthe right person for me because I don't\nfeel what I want to feel but a lot of\nthe time when we say that it's that we\nwe're not feeling what we're familiar\nwith we're not feeling what we're used\nto what our nervous system is trained\nfor so that the my first answer to that\nquestion is that we have to do that work\nto look at what is this thing that I\nkeep chasing mhm\nthat my nervous system is responding to\nand how and is it serving me and how do\nI start to actually retrain my nervous\nsystem which is what the whole chapter\nre how to rewire your brain is about how\ndo I retrain my nervous system so that I\nstart\nto value a different thing not just on a\npsychological level but on a on a\nphysiological level and that requires re\ntraining firstly it requires retraining\nin what we think is possible or what we\nthink is even out there because if we\nkeep finding people that don't want us\ndon't like us back are inconsistent with\ntheir\ncommunication you know treat us as\ndisposable we start to think that that's\nall there is right you know the the I\nyou know there's a idea that I write\nabout in the book in a that's popular in\nself-development you know that idea of\nthe race car driver on the track if you\ndon't want to crash don't look at the\nwall because your car goes where your\neyes go right and I write about that in\nthe book but in a kind of in a more\nnuanced way which is that what we have\ncome to expect in life becomes our war\nand if you keep training yourself to go\nfor people who treat you badly you just\nstart to think the world is full of\npeople like that right right it's like a\nguy who only hangs out in the VIP\nsection of nightclubs thinking that all\nwomen just really care about bottle\nservice that you know like you you you\nare starting to think that your wall is\nthe world right and it's not the case\nbut in order to get ourselves out of\nthat we have to\nstart\nretraining what we respond to even\nbefore it feels good to do that and we\nhave to start getting curious about\nrealities outside of the reality we've\nbeen experiencing for so long so so\nthat's part of it the other part of it\nthat we have to be careful of outside of\nthe kind of trauma response that I'm\ntalking about is just\nthis the basic\neconomics that our brain does in life\nmhm which is to say if something is rare\nit must be\nvaluable and we look at that without\nbeing Discerning or discriminating we\njust think oh it's hard it's rare it's\nvaluable it's like diamonds and air mhm\nyou know we we're told diamonds are rare\nso we think that they're valuable\nmeanwhile when you look at the scale of\nimportance between diamonds and air\nright there's no comparison it's a\nanyone who sees it like that goes oh\nthat's hilarious there's no it's so\nridiculous thinking diamonds are really\nimportant compared to like there's thing\nthat's all around us so we don't even\nthink about it but if someone took away\nyour air tomorrow yeah 30 seconds to 60\nseconds so so when you apply that to the\nworld of\nlove are you chasing diamonds or\nair air is the thing that will keep you\nalive forever diamonds uh you know it's\na it's a kind of idea it's a construct\nof something that feels important\nbecause it's rare because it you know\nand therefore valuable so I I do think\neven for people without\ntrauma in that way there is sometimes\nthe mistake that's made that says the\nperson that wants me is available and\ntherefore I can take that for granted MH\nbut the person that I thought was great\non a date that now isn't texting me back\nright that oh they're a diamond you know\nthere's there's something there that\nthat person's important and we think and\nwe have to suspect ourselves when they\nbecome important for no other or let's\nsay they become more\nimportant when they become more scarce\nyeah cuz that's a pattern that will set\nyou up for so much heartbreak and it by\nthe way has nothing to do with the value\nof that person anyone playing hard to\nget is\nfree anyone can do it MH and it has no\nbearing on their value yeah it's just a\nmind trick so someone can be and this is\nwhere it gets really messed up this is\nwhy this is a where our wall as I said\ncan become our\nworld let's say you constantly make that\nAssociation that someone who's rare is\nvaluable\nmhm you might then encounter let's say\nsomeone who what is in their like\nselfish phase of\nLife most people have gone through it\nyou know there are a certain point in\nlife they're not ready to give or\ncompromise for anybody maybe they're\nbuilding their career maybe they're just\nhigh on life right now and they're just\nlike I'm just dating Whoever Whenever\nwhat they are in a selfish phase doesn't\nmean they're horrible person it just\nmeans they're in a selfish phase and you\ncome across someone like\nthat and in that phase it doesn't mean\nthey're not Charming it doesn't even\nmean they're not nice it doesn't mean\nthey're not a fun person to be around it\ndoesn't mean they weren't great to your\nfamily the time they met them doesn't\neven mean they didn't introduce you to\ntheir family you know like all they\ncould do all of the right things but\nthey're incredibly selfish right now and\nso when it really comes down to it you\nwant them to come with you to the\nairport to pick up your sister and\nthey're\nlike I got like 10 other things that are\nmore important to me than the thing\nthat's important to you right and so\nthey don't care or when it comes to I\nwant to be in a relationship with you\nthey're like yeah let's see I'm good for\nnow because that they're just not\nwilling to do any of that\nnow 5 years from now that person might\nbe in a different place in their life\nlet's say at the same time as you meet\nthat selfish person you also meet\nsomeone who is in their non-selfish FA\nof\nLife 5 years ago they were the selfish\nperson you would have been really\nattracted to but today they they're\nactually in their available phase yeah\nbut because they're in their available\nphase it's not it's not as it's not as\nrare it's not as fun right it's not fun\nthat way so we find ourselves going if\nthis\nperson that isn't giving me the time of\nday if this person that I really like\nthat is I have such a great connection\nwith was only ready right for a\nrelationship I'd be the happiest person\non\nEarth but but we're not seeing all of\nthe people that were there 5 years ago\nin that selfish phase and are available\nnow because it just doesn't trigger that\nsame mind trick of they don't feel rare\nthey don't feel as important because\nthey're actually turning to meet us yeah\nand so that's how you can have someone\nwho\nconsistently in a weird way that person\ncan end up being not that every person\nwho's selfish becomes non-selfish but\nevery but every one of them who does\nit's like they actually can end up\noutgrowing us if we're in that place\nbecause they might end up becoming a\nmore available person but people who are\navailable are not on our radar in the\nsame way that people who are not so I\nknow that's a for some people out there\nthat might be a bit of a Trippy idea but\nit's a good example of how it without\neven realizing it our W becomes our\nworld right man that's so interesting\nand um I'm like thinking back to\nrelationships that I've had in the past\nI'm like oh [ __ ] man that makes so much\nsense now it it makes so much sense that\nthat we go for something that feels more\nrare because it tends to be more\nexciting and for some people they've\nbeen programmed for chaos based off of\ntheir childhood and Chaos even though it\ncan\nfeel chaotic obviously can feel\ncomfortable um you said something that\nthat's that's really interesting so you\nsaid that the two chapters what's the\nname of the first one never satisfied\nNever Satisfied okay so I'm really\ncurious I'm I was talking to my wife\nthis morning and I was like I'm so glad\nI'm not dating right now you know like\nwe we met in 2014 we've been together\nfor 10 years and um and one of the\nthings that I did about probably five or\nsix months into our relationship is I\nstarted started unfollowing every hot\nInstagram model that I followed before\nwe started in our relationship not she\nnever told me to any of that stuff but I\nstarted notice myself comparing right\nand I I was like I don't want to compare\nit's not it's not uh it's not valuable\nit's not doing anything for me it's not\ndoing anything for her and um and so\nlike I really feel for people who are\nalways on Instagram they're always\nseeing edited people and people\ntraveling to all these great places and\nthey can kind of get people on an app\ntonight if they want to almost like Uber\nEats like I'm hungry I can just get some\nsome food here um do you find that you\nknow if you've been doing this for 15\nyears social media has been around for\naround the same amount do you find that\nthat social media and these apps are\nperpetuating the feeling of not being\nsatisfied with people because there's\nalways someone else that could be out\nthere 1,000%\nyeah you know you can't your brain\nisn't capable of like just seeing these\nthings over and over and over again and\nnot internalizing as some kind of\nreality or standard that you should be\ncomparing either yourself to or your\npartner to or your relationship to or\nyour life\nto and and yes we can be we can train\nourselves to be as aware as possible\nRight but so much slips through our\ndefenses and I I can't even trust myself\nto go on Instagram without and stay on\nit for the amount of time I said I would\nstay on it cuz you're on it 20 minutes\nlater on accident what what am I doing\nyeah and so\nyou it starts with deciding what's most\nimportant to us M and then guarding the\ngates to that thing if peace is\nimportant let's go all the way up to\nlike the clouds if peace is important to\nyou and being single and hooking up a\nbunch has never brought you\npeace and so you\nsay where I really am likely to find\nmore peace is by being in a loving\nhealthy stable relationship\nMH then you might say okay then I need\nto find that but one of the threats to\nthat is this dopam mean fueled roller\ncoaster oh yeah of new attraction and\ngorgeous people and you know so you go\nokay that's that's something that is a\nthreat to that\npiece in the same way that you know\ndrugs are a threat to a a LIF lived you\nknow a more stable\nmanageable level of happiness it it's\nlike that's a that's a Temptation I'm\nI'm going to understand that as a\nTemptation and I'm going to take it\nseriously therefore I think that's a big\nthing that a lot of people don't do is\nthey don't take it seriously enough MH\nthat this this gets into my mind and it\nit's like Inception right it plants this\nidea it's like a virus yeah there's oh\nthere's these extra ordinarily perfect\nand beautiful people out there and and\nthen the the comparison that that\ninvites and not just comparison\nentitlement the level of entitlement\nthat it creates is one of the reasons I\ndon't think this just affects people in\nrelationships I think it's such a\ndangerous thing for single people when I\nsee when I both men and women when I see\nlike anger online mhm I see a in their\nlove lives I see a lot of\nentitlement you look at communities of\nmen that are really resentful and bitter\nthere's a lot of entitlement in those\ncommunities there's a lot of I\nshould be with this kind of person this\nper this level of attractive should want\nme this is the only one that I deserve\nthis type of person exactly and and I\nthink a lot of that entitlement comes\nfrom a standard that gets set online mhm\nthat is completely divorced from reality\nand while we're very Savvy these days\nand certainly even younger people than\nus are in some ways even more savvy than\nus to how much [ __ ] there is\nonline there's\nstill our brains don't filter everything\nso there's still just a level of beauty\nand a level of excitement and a level of\nbody and that\nwe start just thinking is more normal\nand it takes us out of the reality of\nour life so yeah I think it's a I think\nit's a problem and I think if if you're\nnot taking it\nseriously then it's a problem that's\nprobably going to creep up on you\nwithout you even realizing it and I\nthink it I I I don't have data on this\nbut\nit it\nseems just clear to me from the from\nwatching it that it must have created a\nmuch much greater level of relationship\ndissatisfaction sure for people to be\nlooking at that stuff constantly yeah\nand even comparing themselves to the\nrelationships they see not just oh I\nthere's this really hot person online\nwho I think is hotter than the person\nI'm with and does that mean that I\nshould be making different decision does\nthat mean that I've settled does that\nmean like there's all of those thoughts\nthat happen for people but it's more\nthan that it's we see someone else's\nrelationship and they just seem [ __ ]\nhappy all the time right and it doesn't\nregister for us that that's not real\nyeah you know our brain doesn't just go\nthat's not real our brain especially by\nthe way you might look at someone who\nvery clearly has this very fake and\nmanufactured life or body or whatever it\nmay be and you go oh that's fake but\nwhen you're favorite couple online oh my\nGod yeah is posting pictures and videos\nand so happy you don't think of that as\nfake you just think of that as a\nrelationship that's way better than\nyours right it's like reality TV\nactually is that actually reality not\nreally it's sced and even if that couple\nis\nauthentic the the moments they're\nposting might be\nauthentic but that doesn't mean they're\nalso posting the moments where they are\nauthentically having problems right sure\nand that's not their fault it's not no\nwe don't owe it to people me and my wife\ndon't owe it to the audience to air our\nfight from last Tuesday you don't\nInstagram live your arguments no no you\nknow like it's it's no we don't owe that\nbut the mistake is in thinking we never\nhave that right and only seeing one side\nmhm of things and that's you know that's\nthe real danger even people who are\nbeing authentic online are not\nauthentically they're not portraying the\nother authentic moments in their life\nthat would create a sense of balance\nright so yeah we're we're comparing\nourselves to you know it's the ultimate\nit's the every everywhere version of\ncomparing you know you're behind the\nscenes to someone else's highlight real\nwe're we're just doing that in every\nsingle way and it justes us thinking our\nlife sucks I think I know right I know I\nthink your phrase of entitlement is\nactually really it's interesting cuz I'm\nlike we're in Hollywood right now I've\nbeen here for a week\nand there if you see people that are\nlike online they're the most beautiful\npeople in the entire world right I\nhaven't seen that many goodlook people\nsince I've been here but you would think\nthey would be here somewhere right like\nand it's funny as a were talking about\nI'm like yeah there's I I don't know the\nlast time I've seen someone that's like\nas beautiful as some of the people that\nyou see online so it's like okay so\nmaybe that's not reality that's the\nfirst thing and the second thing with\nthe entitlement is hilarious because\nit's like even if they did exist you\nprobably couldn't pull them in the first\nplace right like if that person did\nexist right and the last piece I think\nis really interesting is I think there's\nalso studies that show that people who\npost online about the relationships all\nthe time usually are in worse\nrelationships like people who are the\nhappiest relationships don't tend to\npost that much yeah well that's kind of\nanother version of the people that are\nmost morally righteous are usually the\nones doing the worst things behind the\nscenes you know it's like a it's kind of\na\ntruism of of life in general and so no I\nI totally agree with that I think the\npeople that have the people that have it\nare they don't often feel the need to to\npost about it as much yeah no and and\nand it is funny me and Rodi kind of\nlaugh like this there's this idea of\nlike seeing people men or women and just\ngoing I bet they look amazing on\nInstagram like I feel like that person\nlooks great on and by the way it doesn't\nmean they don't look great in real life\nit just means there's a you can see that\nthere's a kind of way that they're\npresenting themselves or look that's\nengineered for all of the ways that you\ncan enhance yourself even further when\nyou start applying filters and all of\nthe things that you can do so yeah it's\nan interesting world now it's funny it's\nin personally I she look like a human\nwhich is what's great you can see her\nhumanness um I'm real Curious uh for you\nand uh I had one of the things you said\nearlier was um when you're around\nsomebody you can feel like oh you're\nmore peaceful and I um was over at\nLewis's house Lewis house the other day\nand a few years ago um we were we were\ntogether and he was on my podcast and\nthen after we were talking about\nrelationships and I could tell like\nthere was some some chaos and stuff\nright like he was just he was saying it\nto me but there was an underlying energy\nand then when I just saw him this this\npast time a couple days ago I said man\nlike you feel different like your energy\nfeels different not like there's\nanything wrong before you weren't saying\nanything wrong but like you just feel\nmore peaceful and General and um he's\nlike yeah man I just feel more peaceful\nlike there's not you know it's not like\neverything in business was great but\nthen there's chaos in relationships and\num I think that's a really big point\nthat that's interesting for me of like I\nalways hear that relationships have to\nbe hard and we had this conversation\nleis and I and I'm curious um your\nthoughts on it do you feel like a good\nrelationship has to be hard cuz any time\nI hear someone's been together for 40 50\nyears like oh yeah was so hard it was so\nmuch work not saying that it wasn't it\ndoesn't require effort but do you think\nthat a great relationship has to be hard\nlike that's a prerequisite firstly it's\nso funny you say that about Lewis\nbecause he I I actually when I was\ntalking about that idea of going home\nfor Christmas and you know people around\nyou notice you're more\npeaceful I was had Lewis in my mind\nreally because he we went to a\nmastermind last year and there was just\na very similar\nof people just really admiring M the\nthat the energy that he brought so he\nwas so funny you had the same experience\nthat's immediately popped into my head\nwhen he said peaceful I was like he's\nway more peaceful now 100% And and by\nthe way when you see that the first\nthing you ask Louis is what did you do\nwhat have you been doing yeah yeah\nso I'm not a lover of\nthe phrase when it's right it's easy mhm\nbecause I think\nit it can get applied in the wrong way\nit can make us feel like there's\nsomething wrong if we're having an\nargument there's something wrong if\nwe're really butting heads over\nsomething there's something wrong if\nwe're you know like we're struggling\nthrough something together mhm and there\nare you know some of the best\nrelationships I've ever known have those\npeople have struggled through some\nreally difficult things together and not\njust facing a challenge outwardly\ntogether but facing a challenge towards\nyou know within them right the\nrelationship it I suppose it depends on\nwhat kind of hard\nexists right\nthe if you goes back to the teamwork\npoint if you have two people who are a\nteam MH and they're like wow we really\ndon't agree on this but I love\nyou and let's figure this\nout I'm really struggling with you right\nnow but I love you and let's figure this\nout what can we do and we both really\nare seeking to solve this problem\ntogether that's one thing\nbut when you're in a relation I I was\nwith um Dr Ramy last night um the world\nleading expert on narcissism who just\nwrote a book called It's not you and I\nwas moderating her book event here in\nLos\nAngeles and one of the things she was\ntalking about was this idea\nof love as sacrifice\ncompromise and\naccommodation you know the belief that\nlove is giving your all\nmhm is something that takes a very dark\nturn in narcissistic\nrelationships because if you're\nif your\nRelentless propensity to give and to\naccommodate and to compromise for\nsomeone and to sacrifice for\nsomeone meets a force that endlessly\ntakes MH then right in a relationship\nlike that it's not one day I'll give\nenough that they'll finally see my value\none day I'll compromise enough that\nthey'll finally compromise\ntoo that they'll finally reciprocate\nit's just a vacuum and it will devour\nyou it's a it's like um who's the\nthere's a woman who wrote the book on\nthe opioid\ncrisis I wish I could remember her name\nbut she said you know the with with\nopioids people think there's a like the\ntypical thing with drug addiction is\nthat there's a rock bottom M when you\nhit that Rock Bottom you Ricochet back\nup but with opioids there is no Rock\nBottom there's you find out that Rock\nBottom has a\ntrapo and that trapo has a basement and\nit just keeps going and and that that is\nthe same in these kinds of relationships\nyeah there is no there is no Rock Bottom\nthis person will destroy your life\nso some beautiful relationships are very\nhard at times because life is very hard\nand there we all come up against\nsituations where life offers challenges\nto our relationship you two really love\neach other and you want to be together\nbut you know you've got a while that you\nhave to do long distance before you can\nbe in the same place you know me me and\nmy wife Audrey we were long distance for\nGood 2 years her being in London and me\nbeing in Los Angeles nothing about that\nwas easy MH it was hard but it was a\nhard that we were willing to do together\nMH so if we' have told ourselves if if\nit's you know you know if it's the right\nthing it should be easy it we would have\nmissed out on the love of our lives but\nwhat's the hard and do you approach\nwhether the hard is out there or in here\nand between each other how do you\napproach the hard do you approach it as\na team do you approach it with a growth\nmindset because if you do I think that\nhard becomes it be it actually ends up\nbecoming the thing that you look at as a\nrepresentation of how strong the\nrelationship is without that hard you\nyou often never really know for as long\nas it's just plain sailing yeah so it's\nit's it's good because it doesn't have\nto be easy it doesn't have to be hard\nbut the main thing I keep hearing behind\neverything that you're saying is there\nneeds to be somebody who's on your team\nit needs to be a joint venture and\nyou've both got to be willing to to put\nin the effort when the effort is\nneeded and um yeah I think what's really\nimportant about that\nis you know I think one of the things\nthat holds a lot of people back in\nrelationships is is communication and\nvulnerability um I think that a lot of\nrelationships that I had in the past\nthat I I was a part of ruining was me\nnot being being able to open up because\nof you know childhood trauma that I had\nyou know I had I kind of had this\nsubconscious feeling of like if someone\nloves you they're probably going to\nleave you just because of patterns with\nmy dad and so that was something that I\nhad to really work on with with my wife\nand um and being like she's not leaving\nthis is crazy like this is but she she\nloves me she's still here and um and it\nwas like a like you're saying it was\nlike a repatterning of me actually more\nthan anything else repatterning my\nnervous system to be like feeling safe\nin non-chaotic\nsituations which doesn't seem like you\nwould need it but I think a lot of\npeople do need it and um and I'm really\ncurious your perspective on it with uh\nwith people who are out there and uh I'm\nthinking specifically about someone that\nI know who is going through relationship\nproblems you know the husband um\nemotionally cheated on her uh with\nsomebody else and um they want to work\non it but they're still not opening up\nin communicating and it's really\ninteresting because they are uh they're\nmarried but they're not getting\nthemselves to a place where they can\ncommunicate and they're not\ncommunicating at the level that they\ncould communicate and I think a lot of\npeople are really afraid of being\nvulnerable even with someone they've\nbeen with for like 10 or 15 years like\nthinking to them but if they really knew\nme like they'd probably want to leave me\ndo you find that pretty often with\npeople even if people have been in\nrelationships for a while like I If they\nonly really truly knew me they probably\nwould leave me and so there's there's\nlike you kind of know me 90% of the way\nbut you don't know that 10% and um I\nfound that me communicating that 10%\ntook a lot like a lot to get out of me\nbut we think someone's going to leave\nand when they don't you go oh holy [ __ ]\nI am safe do you find that that a lot of\npeople are holding back in their their\nclosest relationships and do you find if\nsomebody really does allow thems to go\nthe 100% that it it makes them\nI don't want to say the phrase lock in\nor last because whoever knows what's\ngoing to happen but do you feel like it\nmakes that that Bond tighter well I want\nto commend you on saying what you just\nsaid firstly Rob because it's really\nthat's really really powerful what you\njust articulated and your audience is\nvery lucky to have you in that respect\nbecause that's a very healing thing what\nyou just said and it's so it's so honest\nand it's so vulnerable\nand it's so human and it's that there\naren't enough especially men out there\nlet alone women who are willing to say\nthose things not not least in front of a\na giant audience hundreds of thousands\nof people yeah thank you genuinely I'm\nreally that's really just impressive\nthank\nyou I had the same thing\nyeah I uh your wife's giggling in the\nbackground that's the best part she\nknows this all too well no I I the truth\nis Rob I always thought I was a\nvulnerable guy I never I never\nassociated with not being\nvulnerable you know I guess I would hear\nbrne Brown's stuff and I'd be like yeah\nawesome hell yeah yeah great I don't I I\nthink that it's taken me a long long\ntime to to truly be\nvulnerable it both publicly and\nprivately you I think I spent my 20s\ntrying toig feel like I knew it all or\nat least trying to portray that image of\nknowing it\nall and and it wasn't that I was you\nknow what I was doing I was I was very\naware that what I was doing was helping\na lot of people but I just also knew\nthat there were parts of me that I was\nworried the audience wouldn't right like\nme or love me anymore if they knew those\nthings or if I showed those weaknesses\nand those\nflaws and I I also didn't realize the\nextent to which I was doing that in my\npersonal life I think that what I I was\nalways telling stories about myself and\nthought I was opening up when I did that\nbut we can all tell stories that make us\nlook great of course yeah you know like\nit's it's the funny it's kind of the\nfunny thing about a lot of\nself-development right is that our\nstories just they're all a hero's\njourney story they're not a story of\nI've got this deep dark thing that I\nthink makes me weak or pathetic or\nhideous and if I tell you I don't know\nif you're going to still be here it's\nnot that it's always like you know I was\nstruggling and now I'm doing great yeah\nhere's how I developed the habits that I\nmade me a millionaire or whatever say\nhere's how how bad I was back then it's\nalways back then right you know so that\nthat that's not real that's not\nvulnerability right that's I'm awesome\nmhm look what I've done vulnerability is\nso much you know vulnerability because\nit's scary when you do it you don't know\nhow it's going to go you hope it's going\nto go the way you want but you don't\nknow you're just you're just allowing\nyourself to be seen and that took me\ntime I remember it early on in our\nrelationship\nwe you know I remember getting like at\nthe very beginning of our relationship\ngetting jealous about something mhm and\npicking a fight over it there was I can\ntell you right now Rob there was no\nvulnerability in the way I had this\nfight yeah it was just my worst side\ncoming out right it was me being\njudgmental and uh a little controlling\nand a little\num uh and and just hot-headed and and I\njust I look back on it and I'm just like\nif I look back on that guy in that\nmoment it's just a scared person right\nor it's a person that feels like in that\nmoment they're not enough or they're\nthreatened their safety is threatened\nand God forbid you know any of that\nabout me cuz if you knew that you'd\nthink I was pathetic yeah and weak and\nugly and you know and yuck MH you know\nand I don't want that by the way I'd\neven had that in the past I'd revealed\nsomething vulnerable in a situation just\nlike that and and the the irony is I had\ntried being a little more vulnerable mhm\nand it\nbackfired I I someone literally looked\nat me and told me that it made me\nunattractive really so it's even worse\nand it really for a minute there it\nreally messed up my it it took the most\nscared part of me and it rewarded its\nbelief that if you let this stuff out\nthat this is going to go horribly for\nyou people say they want vulnerability\nno know they want great they want strong\nthey want I'm a warrior who cries in sad\nmovies\nsometimes and I am never doing that\nagain yeah that is the last time you\nknow and and so\nit that that unfortunately kind of re\nwounded me in that\narea and\nit I had to learn that with my wife in\nwhen we were dating that I could be more\nhonest about something that had hurt me\nmhm or scared\nme and that she wouldn't not just she\nwouldn't run away but she wouldn't stay\nand now think that I was\nunattractive cuz that was a in some ways\njust a big just as big a fear right\nyou'll you'll still be with me but now\nyou'll be looking at everyone else as\nmore exciting than me yeah you'll lose\nrespect for me in some way and now the\noutside world other men will remain\nmysterious and attractive and strong\nfrom a distance and I'm the weakling\nthat you know you know like that's the\nthe core of this thing and and and if\nI'm that then it confirms everything I\nthink about not being good enough and\nyou won't think I'm enough and you'll\neventually have contempt for me and\nyou'll leave me or you'll cheat on me or\nyou'll flirt with other people or what\nthere's a whole thousand teenage\nfeelings yeah of course in there\nand and I I had to bit by bit learn to\nallow myself to actually be seen and\nto understand that by being seen for\nthose I want to say darker parts of me\nbut not just darker in the negative\nsense but just\nthose those more raw and vulnerable\nparts of me I had to learn that\nit it she wouldn't just stay but that it\nwouldn't\nerase all of the other things she saw me\nas it wouldn't\nerase all of the times I had actually\nbeen very sure of myself mhm or\nconfident or you know playful or sexy or\nyou know bold it wouldn't suddenly make\nher go no none of those things are true\nnow that I've seen this yeah it would\njust be a way of her fully holistically\nseeing meh and integrating all of that\nis it you know it's work\nthat that there are psychologists out\nthey're doing with people is that you\nknow Shadow work that helps them\nintegrate their darker parts into\nthemselves right so that when I look\nback on that thing that I did that I\nfeel shame for or regret for instead of\ndetaching myself from that and\nfracturing myself I can view that\nholistically and I can view it as part\nof me and integrate it I can see what\nwas going on behind that that led to the\naction that I now regret or despise or\ndon't you know can't stand to associate\nwith but I see the me behind that and\nwhat was really going on and I can\nintegrate that part of me and still find\na way to love and have compassion for\nthat part of me well what if you applied\nthat to your partner too what if you\ngave them the opportunity to fully\nintegrate all of you into their vision\nof you and and the relationship and who\nthey see you as and to truly view you\nholistically what I learned was that\nrather than make me rather than this one\nthing that came out in that moment\nbecoming the truth of who I am like uhoh\nshe found out yep instead it was oh no I\nsaw it's like I have this you know\nobject and I turned it and it shined\ndifferently on this side and if I turn\nit again it shines and oh this is all of\nyou it didn't erase the other parts it\njust allows me to see you for the whole\nthat you are and and love you even more\nand when she extended compassion even to\nthe parts of me that I was at the time\nunable to extend compassion to myself\nfor that for me was an extremely healing\nthing and it makes me sad to think of\nthe version of me that never experienced\nthat you know if there was a world where\nI never came across the the person the\nlearnings the tools to do that and went\nthrough life thinking that I was having\nthese kind of open vulnerable\nrelationships but never really getting\nto the good stuff never feeling totally\nseen never feeling totally accepted it\nmakes me feel so sad for that version of\nme and and I feel sad for that in other\npeople who are in marriages who feel\nlike God if you if you only knew you\nwould hate me or you would despise me or\nyou I wouldn't be good enough for you\nanymore if we\ncan start to encourage people\nto F you know first\ntry to make peace with those parts of\nthemselves so that they can begin to\nview themselves holistically instead of\nallowing this thing to be the one truth\nof who they are and even to have\ncompassion for the thing that was behind\nthat action and where that came from um\nif we can do that for oursel first and\nfor many people they're able to do that\nthrough\ntherapy then it also allows them to\nbring that to their partner mhm in a way\nway that your partner's still some of\nthat they're going to have a reaction to\nand let's face it some of us some some\nof us have done things in relationships\nthat that would hurt our partner to know\nor it would you know it's like even more\ndifficult when it's like the thing that\nI am judging myself for is something\nthat could damage our relationship or\nwill damage our\nrelationship um but but the pro the the\ndanger is that we spend our whole lives\nhaving fractured ourselves and our and\nnever giving our partner the chance to\nsee who we really are and and the irony\nwe could do a whole other episode on\nthis\nbut the irony is that when\nsomeone when we're able to truly be\nvulnerable not just I did this or this\nis something in my past\nbut this is all of me that was behind\nthat and this is you know where I\nbelieve it comes from for me and this is\nwhat I'm scared of and this is what I'm\nstill scared of today and this is then\nit allows our partner to actually start\nto\ncontextualize some of the things that we\nhave done in our life that we have maybe\nhated ourselves for or regretted or felt\nshame over for a very long\ntime but with greater context someone\nelse can help us also\nto offer some compassion to ourselves\nyeah that's so [ __ ] good just like CU\nbecause when you actually sit and think\nabout it it's like what we're all\nlooking for is love and what we're\nreally looking for most of the time is\njust love from oursel and I think a part\nof that is just acceptance of all parts\nbut sometimes we need someone to mirror\nto be our mirror and I think that maybe\none of the\nhighest maybe one of the most important\nparts of being in a real deep intimate\nrelationship that nobody actually ever\ntalks about is that if you can get\nyourself to the point where you can\nspeak vulnerably fully 100% the parts\nthat you don't love and accept if you\ncan see that person love and accept that\npart of you it allows you to get the\nhealing that you are never able to give\nto\nyourself yeah yeah we do have to do a\nwhole of that episode you're ex you're\nyou're exactly right that's that's\nexactly right and really all that person\nis doing is is mirroring the kind\nof uh corrective relationship that has\nto happen within right yourself but they\nbecome a kind of\nrepresentation of that and and and it's\nyou know it's a bit of a chicken egg\nthing right because we we don't always\nhave the luxury of having someone like\nthat in front of us at this moment which\nis where I think you know therapy or\ncoaching can be really valuable because\nthat can that can kind of be an\ninterim before having found a\nrelationship with someone that beautiful\nin spirit\nMH\num but it it can come I think it it's\none of those things that can come from\neither direction you can start from the\ninside out you can offer yourself the\npossibility of it happening from the\noutside in but you you can't give\nyourself that opportunity unless you're\nprepared to be brave in the first\nplace yeah we're going to have to do\nanother episode everybody if you guys\nare on YouTube and you want another\nepisode you're going to have to comment\nit down below so the book everybody is\nlove life by Matthew hussy how to raise\nyour standards find your person and live\nhappily if you're listening this today\nthat it comes out this book comes out\ntomorrow and uh you

worldwide live virtual event\nand it's the kind of event people would\nnormally have to invest in this is for\nme a celebration I've the last book I\nwrote was 10 years ago and this is a\nit's a big moment for me I'm I'm much\nmore vulnerable in this book than I've\never been you know there a lot of\nstories from my personal life I dig in\nmuch deeper to the things that hold us\nback in love to the reasons we struggle\nto find love love to the reasons we\nstruggle with our own\nconfidence and and ultimately why we\nstruggle with our happiness because I\nI'm a big believer there's three\nrelationships we're always going to be\nin one is a relationship with other\npeople the second is a relationship with\nourselves and the third is a\nrelationship with life itself th those\nare three relationships you're going to\nbe in till the day you die in one way or\nanother and the quality of those\nrelationships is going to be the quality\nof your life yeah so undoubtedly the the\nbiggest audience for this book are going\nto be people who want to find love mhm\nbut people are going to people are going\nto get so much out of this coming from\nwherever they're coming from there's\nchapters on overcoming heartbreak\nthere's a chapter on how to leave a\ntoxic or abusive relationship there's\nchapters on Purely dedicated to your\nrelationship with yourself and your\nconfidence or what I call Core\nconfidence um you know the whole book\nfinishes on a chapter on what I call\nbeing happy enough um even even while\nyou're on the road to finding love so\nit's
