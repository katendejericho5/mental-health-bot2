    "transcript": "welcome today we're going to be talking\nabout how to change the identity that\nyou have of yourself because when you\nchange your identity you change the way\nthat you interact with the world let's\ndive in when you look at your identity\nand who you think you are not who you\nare but who you think you are you think\nthat you are a person that you are not\nnow that might sound kind of crazy but\nyour personality and your identity are\nnot real they are not set in stone they\nare made up by you in your perception of\nyourself your perception of yourself\nthrough other people by other things\nthat you've done and when you look at\nthe word I've said this hundreds of\ntimes in the podcast over the past nine\nyears now the word\npersonality the root word in Greek is\nthe word for mask and it was the mask it\nwas Persona and the mask was the mask\nthat they would wear in the Greek\ntheaters whenever they were in theater\nplaying a character and so personality\nthe root word for it is Persona which\nmeans the character you're basically\nplaying and so the the other example I\nlike to to give people is it's kind of\nlike the shirt that you're wearing it's\nlike somebody gave you a dirty t-shirt\nwhen you were a child by telling you\nthis is who you are this is how you are\nwhatever it might be and you put on that\nt-shirt not knowing what like what your\nlife is or who you are and you said oh\nmy gosh I guess this is who I am and you\nneed to learn to take your shirt off you\nneed to go topless for a little a little\nwhile we we all need to go topless and\nlet me explain what I mean I've told the\nstory before but it it kind of all\nclicked for me at this moment in time um\nprobably about four or five years ago I\nwas in my condo in downtown Austin with\nmy girlfriend the time my wife now and\nwe were watching uh queery and there was\nthis lady and she was like 30 something\nyears old and they had done the full\nmakeover and they had you know fixed up\nher house and they put makeup on her and\nthey gave her a haircut and they give\nher a new wardrobe and everything and\nthey were having a conversation with her\nand she said said something along lines\nof like yeah but I'm still ugly and so\nthey started talking to her and they're\nlike hey you know like where did you\nlike why are you so set on being so ugly\nlike why won't you even let yourself see\nyour beauty and she's like it's just cuz\nI'm ugly and they're like who told you\nthat and she ended up saying that her\nAunt when she was like 6 years old told\nher she was ugly and she thought that\nshe was ugly when she was younger\nbecause somebody told her that she was\nugly a person that's older and quote\nunquote smarter and so children just\nkind of sometimes take advice from older\npeople and I was like and and she she's\nbeen carrying it with her for the past\nlike 30 years and I remember turning to\nmy wife and I was in the kitchen at the\ntime I was listening to her I was like\nthat's crazy she's like what I was like\nit's basically like her aunt gave her a\ndirty t-shirt and said wear this t-shirt\nand that dirty t-shirt said I'm\nugly and she got it at 6 years old she's\nlike 35 years old now and she hasn't\neven looked down and realized that she's\nwearing somebody else's shirt she's\nwearing somebody else's belief she's\nwearing somebody else's words and for\nthe past 29 years her life has been what\nshe's thought of herself her identity\nand her personality has been built\naround ugly an ugly child when in\nreality she never looked down and said\nwhose shirt is this like do I do I want\nto continue to wear this shirt and for a\nlot of us that are out there this is one\nof just so you know this is one of my\nfavorite subjects to talk about because\nI think if people can\nlearn really learn like deep in their C\nand deep in their bones that their\npersonality and their identity is a\nbunch of and it's not real and\nit never has been real and they weren't\nborn that way but it is something that\nwas placed upon them by somebody else or\nit's something that we created within\nourselves based off of the way we see\nthe world around us and based off the\nway that we see and perceive other\npeople interacting with us you know\nsomeone in your childhood could have\nsaid something to you and said hey this\nis your shirt and you've been wearing it\never since and it doesn't fit anymore\nand it's dirty and it's torn but every\nday we unconsciously wake up and we put\non this dirty t-shirt that is not us\nthat was given to us by someone else and\nwe can just decide to unconsciously keep\nputting this t-shirt on or we can wake\nup and we can say to ourselves I am\ngoing to be somebody different I am not\nwho the whatever I've built myself into\nbe I'm going to be who I want to to\nbuild myself into being From This Moment\nforward and so think about that for a\nsecond What shirt are you wearing are\nyou wearing the I'm not good enough\nshirt I'm not smart enough I'm ugly I'll\nalways be overweight um I'm going to be\npoor forever I'm not going to be a great\nparent money's hard to come by what\nshirt what belief what systems are built\ninto your head that were built by\nsomebody else most likely and by wearing\nthat shirt you're creating a reality for\npeople to treat you a different way it's\nlike the phrase and I love this phrase\nif you wake up in the morning and you go\nout into the world and you meet an\n you just met an but if\nyou wake up in the morning and all you\ndo is meet well then you're the\n what does that mean it means if\nyou are an and you go out into\nthe world you're going to change people\naround you to then treat you badly\nbecause you're treating them badly so we\nchange the way that people interact with\nus but if we wake up and we say I'm not\ngoing to be this this shy I'm not good\nenough I'm stupid you know what I'm\ngoing to do I'm going to I'm going to\ntry on the T-shirt today of I'm\nconfident I know what the I'm doing\nI'm awesome and I'm amazing and if you\nwalk into the world and you wear the shy\nquiet not good enough and you are\ninteracting with people that way and you\ngo into the world you're completely\ndifferent people will change I'm telling\nyou people will change the way that they\ninteract with you when you change change\nwho you are and who you believe your\nidentity\nis you know if if you grew up like I\nhave you ever seen this before have you\never seen somebody that is like for\ninstance like a beautiful woman right\nshe's she's grown up and she's this\nbeautiful person but she might have been\nlike maybe she like peaked really late\nin life she was like little ugly kid\nwhatever it might be and she was like\nthe ugly kid she was made fun of in\nschool she could be 30 years old and\nincredibly beautiful but because of fact\nthat she was made fun of and she was\ncalled ugly when she was younger she\nstill thinks that she is and she won't\neven allow herself to see her beauty and\nso she can walk into the world this is\nan example you probably know people like\nthis or you've seen people like this\nbefore she can walk into the world and\npeople will treat her differently\nbecause of the lack of confidence people\nwill treat her differently and interact\nwith her differently because of her the\nway that she views herself which then\nreinforces the identity that she has of\nherself we will always see what we're\nlooking for and by the way that we\ninteract with other people it will\nalways reflect back to us what we think\nof ourselves what we think of the world\neverything and then so no matter how\ngreat somebody could look if they could\ncarry thems with not confident and\npeople reflect and treat that treat them\ndifferently because of that right so\nthat happens I've seen many times before\nright and uh like if you're wearing the\noverweight shirt right oh if I'm wearing\nthe overweight shirt I was a fat kid\nwhen I was growing up and I was made fun\nof for being the fat kid and I'll always\nbe the fat kid and and I'm just that's\njust the way that I am I have a good\nfriend who struggles with weight loss\nand it goes up and down and up and down\nand up and down we've had deep\nconversations about this before\nspecifically because he was always made\nfun of for being the fat kid and he\nstill has that shirt being worn in his\nhead and he because of that he has these\ndecisions that he makes where he will do\nreally good and his diet and his workout\nfor like two weeks and then he just goes\noff the rails because it doesn't line up\nwith the identity he has of himself and\nhe hasn't gone through the process of\nactually trying to change his identity\nand wake up in the morning and and\nspecifically meditate and set his GPS\nfor who he wants to be today the fit\nperson the person who's working on\nhimself the person who's working on\nbeing healthy that's no longer the fat\nkid whatever it might be right and so if\nyou're sitting there like oh like I've\nI've been overweight my entire life well\nif you think that you're always going to\nbe overweight and you've been overweight\nyour entire life well then there's not\nreally any reason for me to eat health\nbecause it'll always be this way no it's\njust it's in my genes my mom's\noverweight my dad's overweight my\ngrandparents right I never worked out\nbefore but why start it doesn't matter\nthere's no point of working out because\nI'm always going to be this way and so\nwhat happens is our actions reflect our\nidentity of oursel our actions reflect\nour identity of oursel if oh I'm poor\nright like I was raised pretty poor I've\nwe didn't have any money at all so if I\ncontinue to wear that shirt why would I\never work hard to try to get what I want\nbecause I'll always be poor anyways so\nit's easier not to work hard than to\nwork hard you know that's this is one of\nthe reasons why poverty is so hard to\nget out of is because it's it's kind of\nand I had I have a friend Garen uh Garen\nJones and he's he uh is incredible like\nhe's incredibly successful now and he\nwas raised really poor in in a bad part\nof Houston and you know has a crazy life\nstory you can go back and it was on my\npodcast a few years ago incredible life\nstory like nuts right and uh and he said\ngrowing up in poverty and then wanting\nto become rich is like trying to learn a\nnew language like it's to it's it's a\ncompletely different language and so he\nhad to start to learn that language and\nso you know if you're around a bunch of\npeople who are in poverty and you you\nwere raised that way well it might be\nhard for you to start to understand how\nto be wealthy but it doesn't mean it's\nsomething that you can't learn it's like\nlearning a new language there's just\nsome differences that you have to figure\nout so if you're wearing that shirt I\ndon't I don't want to wear that poor\nshirt anymore what's the shirt that you\ncould wear the maybe you're wearing like\nI'm the I'm the not good at math shirt\nI'm stupid shirt right I could I could\nwear the I'm a son of an alcoholic shirt\nyou know and I love the story of the the\nthe two twin boys and they're born to a\nson of an alcoholic father they fast\nforward 30 years and one of the the\ntwins is an alcoholic and the other one\nis a successful business owner and they\nwalk up to the alcoholic son and they\nsay hey why are you an alcoholic and he\nsays I'm an alcoholic because my my\nfather was an alcoholic and then they\nwalk up to the successful one and they\nsay why are you not an alcoholic and he\nsays I'm not an alcoholic cuz my father\nwas an alcoholic so it's it's all about\nhow we view the world and how we view\nourselves none of the identities and\nnone of the uh personalities that we've\nbuilt ourselves are true but if you wake\nup every single day and you put that\nshirt on we've unconsciously put that\nshirt on every single day now I'm trying\nto make you more conscious of waking up\nand putting on the I'm ugly I'm poor I'm\nstupid I'll never be good enough I'll\nNever Be Loved whatever your shirt might\nbe what if for just one day just one day\nyou just tried on a different t-shirt\nwhat if you stopped wearing that that\nshirt that's not your size anymore\nthat's dirty that's ripped that doesn't\nlook good on you you got a little bit of\na gut hanging out of that shirt cuz it's\ntoo small right you look like winning\nthe Poo what just for if one day you\njust said you know what I'm going to try\nto be out conscious as POS I'm going to\nput on a new shirt and I'm going to try\nto be as conscious as possible to be\nsomebody else just see what what\nhappens you know that if you look at it\nif if you're wearing the ugly shirt what\nif you wore just for\ntoday I love myself and I'm beautiful\nshirt and people think I'm beautiful how\ndo you think that maybe your external\nworld would change if you are the one\nthat changes in that way cuz we all know\nsomeone who might be like we all know\nsomebody who's not the best looking but\nthey just have confidence and that\nconfidence makes them better looking\nmakes them more attractive right what if\nyou tried on that shirt what if you were\nwearing the overweight shirt the fat kid\nshirt or whatever you shirt you've been\nwearing and you you wear the shirt of\nhealthy and I'm going to lose weight I'm\nI'm healthy and I'm losing weight it\nmight be harder you know I'm not saying\nthat every person it's it's the easy for\nevery single person to lose weight it's\ngoing to be harder for some people to\nlose weight than other people everybody\nhas different body types but it's not\nimpossible to get into the shape that\nyou want so what if it was the I am\ngoing from the overweight shirt or I'm\nfat shirt or whatever it might be to I\nam healthy and I'm working on myself and\nI'm going to lose weight and I am going\nto walk into this world as somebody who\nis like that and this is one of the\nreasons why people lose weight and they\ngain it back is because it doesn't line\nup with their identity and so they can\nlose 50 PBS but they still have that\nidentity of being the overweight kid and\nso that goes back eventually it's why\npeople win the lottery and then blow all\nthe money because they didn't know how\nto make the money in the first place so\nthey blow it because it gets them back\nto where they were they never actually\ntake off the shirt that they've been\nwearing their entire life they don't\nknow that there is a deep identity a\ndeep personalties that that is below all\nof this it is in our subconscious mind\nthat we actually need to rework and\nchange you know the poor shirt the ugly\nshirt the overweight shirt this not good\nat math shirt the alcoholism runs in my\nfamily shirt you know it's it's\ninteresting there's a book I read years\nago it's called psycho cybernetics it's\nit's probably from like the 50s 60s and\num it's about this guy who is a a\nsurgeon and he said it was really\ninteresting to see how people would get\nsurgery and it could be something small\nlike like removing a mole from their\nface and they would come back a couple\nweeks after getting it done and some\npeople were the exact same person and\nsome people were just a completely\ndifferent person like they thought that\nmole was the thing that made them ugly\nand they come back they were they have\nthey're no they're not confident with\nthe mole they think they're ugly they\nget the mole removed as if it's just\nmagic surgery and they come back and\nthey're confident and they're holding\nhimself differently and they're dressed\ndifferently just because that not\nbecause of reality not because the mole\nall of the problems are in the mole but\nbecause of the fact that their\nperception of themselves changed and\nwhen their perceptions of themselves\nchanged how they inter interacted with\nthe world around them Chang as\nwell and he realized that the as he's\nyou know a surgeon realizes that the\nsurgery wasn't actually even necessary\nwhat was necessary is the way that they\nview themselves and so I want you to\nthink about this what shirt have you\nbeen wearing since your childhood what\nidentity what personality what belief\nsystem have you been wearing since you\nwere a child and you need to take\noff like what shirt do you want to put\non and what's the strategy to wake up in\nthe morning is it to wake up in the\nmorning and to you know brush your teeth\nand then right after brushing your teeth\nyou repeat a mantra to yourself 20 times\nwhile looking yourself in the mirror is\nit sitting down and meditating um and\nand repeating that Mantra is you're\ngoing for a run and in that 10-minute\nrun all you're doing is just repeating\nto yourself over and over and over again\nthe thing that you want to believe about\nyourself right now understand this won't\nchange in one day if you're 35 years old\nyou have 35 years of programming right\nso it's a complete programming it won't\nchange in one day but it's about waking\nup and saying I don't want to believe\nwhat I have been believing I'm ready to\nchange my identity I'm ready to change\nmyself I'm ready to change my\npersonality and I am going to brainwash\nmyself into being the person that I want\nto\nbe what is it start to figure it out\nstart to journal through it start to\nbecome more of that person now for those\nof you guys that are parents think about\nthis for a second not trying to get you\nmad or screwed up right what shirt are\nyou making your children wear what are\nyou saying to your\nchildren that is making them think that\nthey're a certain way What shirt are you\nmaking those around you where your\nemployees your husband your wife your\nparents because what you say to people\nabout them a lot of times people will\ntake in and so if you're trying to help\npeople around you be very aware of how\nyou are changing people's identity\naround you as well how you are either\nhelping them change into the identity\nthat they want or you're helping\nreinforce an identity that might not be\nan identity for them that might not be\nan identity that's helping them in their\ngreatest purpose that they can step into\nand really what it comes down to you\nknow Buddha has a quote that says just\nas a snake sheds its skin we must shed\nour past over and over again so what\nskin what shirt what personality what\nidentity what belief systems do you need\nto shed think about that journal through\nit and start to step into being the\nperson that you want to be so that's I\ngot for you for today episode if
