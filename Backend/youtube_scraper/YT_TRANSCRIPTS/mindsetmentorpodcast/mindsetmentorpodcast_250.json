    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be diving into how to develop\nmore discipline within yourself so you\ncan take the action that you want to\ntake to create the life that you want\nlet's dive in and the first question\nthat I always think for anything is why\nso you clicked on this episode that is\ntitled something along the lines of how\nto have more discipline and you think to\nyourself huh I should listen that I\nthink I could use a little bit more\ndiscipline why do you want to be more\ndisciplined what is it that you think\nabout when you think about being more\ndisciplined is it that I want to be more\ndisciplined in making a 100 phone calls\nin my sales job I want to be more\ndisciplined to eating the right food I\nwant to be more disciplined to uh\nturning off my phone when uh I come home\nso that therefore I can have family time\nI want to be more disciplined to go to\nthe gym five times a week I want to be\nmore disciplined to get up when my alarm\nclock goes off I want to be more\ndisciplined to go to bed when I should\ngo to bed so I can wake up earlier why\ndo you want to develop more\ndiscipline what do you think would\nchange in your life if you started to\nbecome more disciplined you probably\nthink to yourself my life would be\nbetter I would probably make more money\nI would probably be in better shape I\nwould probably be happier my children\nwould be happier so you can see that\ndiscipline is a positive thing because\nthe word discipline uh can have a\nnegative connotation because we think to\nourselves like if you know somebody\ndoesn't do something your child doesn't\ndo something you discipline them or your\ndog doesn't do what it's supposed to do\nyou discipline it so we I think\ndiscipline has this this negative kind\nof feeling behind it but discipline is\nactually one of the best things that you\ncan do for yourself and so today we're\ngoing to talk about how to be more\ndisciplined and I want you to understand\nthis before we dive in is that\ndiscipline is like a muscle it is a\nhabit that you build within yourself\nnobody is born disciplined there's no\nvery disciplined two-year-old and\nthey're just like I'm gonna do this\nthing like there's no there's no\ndisciplined person that's born into this\nworld and the reason why I can say this\nis because I feel like now I am a very\ndisciplined person um but I was\nextremely undisciplined and I was a lazy\npiece of for a long time and then I\ndeveloped a why behind it like I I saw\nwhere my life was I saw where my life\nwas going if I continued down the same\npath that I was already on and I thought\nto myself well I want to go down a\ndifferent path I want a different life\npath I want something to be different\nthan that\nso I'm going to need to develop to some\ndiscipline I'm going to need to get\nbetter at taking action to doing what\nneeds to be done and sometimes doing\nwhat I don't want to do uh for the\ngreater good of myself and for my life\nand so I developed it over time and the\nthe interesting thing about discipline\nis that discipline you don't have to\nhave it for the easy things you don't\nneed any discipline at all to do the\nthings that are easy to sleep in you\ndon't need discipline for that to eat\nsomething that's really tasty but not\ngood for you you don't need discipline\nfor that to not go to the gym you don't\nneed discipline for that to decide to\nstay home and not grow your business you\ndon't need discipline for that to not\nmake cold calls you don't need\ndiscipline for that ultimately you need\ndiscipline to do the things that are\nactually good for you that are good for\nyou that are good for the people around\nyou that are good for your your mind\nyour body your soul you need discipline\nto do those things you need discipline\nto sit down and meditate for 10 minutes\nright because there's so many other\nthings you could make excuses for but\nyou know that when you sit down for 10\nminutes and you meditate with nothing\nelse that you end up being a more calm\nbetter version of yourself around your\nchildren around your employees you need\ndiscipline to do the good things you\nneed discipline to do the things that\nare harder right you don't need\ndiscipline for the easy things you need\ndiscipline for the hard things but these\nare the things that you know\nshould be\ndone you need it and the the way that I\nwant to to frame your mindset and to\nchange your mindset around discipline is\nthat when we hear the word discipline I\nthink it's kind of a hard thing and it\nfeels kind of like constraining right\nlike for me I always think very visually\nso when I think of like discipline I\nthink of almost like a a normal\nconnotation that it has kind of in\nsociety is discipline is kind of like a\nstraight jacket like you can't do\nanything else you have to do this you\nhave to be mean to yourself you have to\nkind of White Knuckle your way into\ndiscipline no not really that's the way\nthat we normally think about it but I\njust shared with you that you need\ndiscipline to do the things that are\ngood for you and so in a sense I want to\nreframe your mindset around discipline\nand realize that discipline is a form of\nself-love discipline is a form of self-\nLov because you are doing what you know\nis good for you in the long run\nyou're focusing on something in the\nfuture it's like planting a seed you\nknow that this the you're not\nimmediately going to get the tree but\nyou know that if you plant a seed now in\nfive years you'll be able to sit under\nthe the the shade of that tree and\nprotect yourself from the sun right so\nyou're focusing on delayed gratification\nwhen you work out you don't immediately\nsee the results when you eat healthy you\ndon't immediately see the results you\ndon't see immediate results most of the\ntime when you have to do something that\nrequires discipline because you're\nfocusing on delayed gratification versus\ninstant\ngratification we live in a society where\nwe get everything immediately nowadays\nwe immediately get almost everything\nthat we want we get an answer when we\nwant to figure something out we get food\ndelivered to our house we get someone to\ncome pick us up and drive us somewhere\nif we want to use Uber and so we really\nare so used to instant gratification but\nfor our lives and the things that make\nour lives better better it's almost\nalways delayed gratification is\nnecessary you put in the work now and\neventually you get the fruits of your\nlabor everything works its way out in\ntime you know now that I'm slowly each\nyear getting closer and closer to 40 I\nam now starting to realize that\neverything works its way out in time if\nyou take good actions for yourself\nconsistently time will be your best\nfriend if you take good\nactions for yourself and you fast\nforward 10 years from today time is your\nbest friend you're going to live longer\nyou're probably going to be happier\nyou're going to be healthier you're\ngoing to be wealthier you're going to\nhave a greater life if you take bad\nactions for yourself time is your worst\nenemy it will catch up and and as I\nstart getting to the age of almost at 40\nI look at people I can see people on\nFacebook and Instagram that I grew up\nwith that I went to elementary school\nhigh school middle school with and I can\nsee now people just by looking at them\nand go yeah that person looks really\ngood they probably took care of them for\nthe past 20s something years since I\nlast saw them and I can see other people\nand go yeah it doesn't look like they\ntook care of\nthemselves time catches up we like to\nact like it doesn't we like to prepare\nPR prepare we like to PR God I can't\neven say pretend we like to pretend like\nit's not going to catch up to us it's\n catching up at some point in\ntime time is either your best friend or\nit's your worst enemy so discipline when\nyou think about it is not about being\nperfect it's not about the straight\njacket it's a form of like you know what\nI am going to eat healthier to take care\nof my body because I want to live longer\nbecause I do want to have more energy\nbecause I want to be able to play with\nmy grandchildren right so it's it's not\nabout being perfect or about being this\nlike badass productivity machine you\nknow like the overly aggressively\nmasculine go out and get get it\ndone bro like it's not about being that\nit's about going you know what I'm going\nto show up for myself and it's not about\nbeing perfect it's not about beating\nmyself up when I and when I'm not\nperfect it's about winning that battle\nmore than losing so I'm going to I'm\ngoing to have more wins in the win\ncolumn than in the losses\ncolumn yeah I'm going to try to do the\nbest that I possibly can I'm going to\nshow up for myself I'm going be more\ndisciplined and so let me give you some\nsome ways to help you be a little bit\nmore discipline and to start to develop\nthe muscle the same way that you know if\nyou don't go to the gym but you decide\nthat you want to start going to the gym\nyou're going to have some weak muscles\nthat's okay but as you lift you're going\nto be sore for a couple days the first\ntime that you lift heavy uh but you'll\neventually start to get there you'll\neventually start to get better and\nyou'll eventually start to have this\nmuscle grow and so I'm going to give you\na couple tips just to kind of help you\nget a little bit better with your\ndiscipline the first thing that's a very\nsimple thing to help you get better with\nyour your discipline is to challenge\nyourself to finish everything that you\nstart you know the way you do one thing\nis the way you do everything so if the\nway you do small things is also the way\nyou do big things and so I always\nrecommend try to do the little things\nthe best that you possibly can because\neventually you're building that muscle\nof this is just who I am this is how I\nshow up uh this is so if I get used to\nfinishing the small things I'll get used\nto finishing the big things so for\ninstance like doing the dishes right you\nend up going and and eating some food\nyou end up taking that dish and just\ncleaning it finish the act of eating\nyour food which means finishing the dish\nclean it by hand put it inside the\ndishwash whatever you need to do\nsleeping finish the act of sleeping make\nthe bed it's these little things that\nimpact the big things when you can start\nto develop the feeling of finishing what\nyou start because all too often what I\nfind with people is that people are\nreally good at starting things most\npeople have no problem starting things\nthey'll start it and they'll excited\nabout it the problem that most people\nhave is finishing things the follow\nthrough is where most people usually\nfollow fall off in some sort of way so\nif you can give with the little things\nand you can get good at at finishing\nthose things you get really good at the\nbig things as well just finish what you\nstart don't allow yourself to stop\nsomething early that stopping early is a\nhabit\ntoo following through is a\nhabit stopping too early and not\nfollowing through is probably not the\nHabit that you want to develop within\nyourself and that muscle might be strong\nthe giving up early muscle might be\nstrong what we're trying to do is we're\ntrying to make the following through\nmuscle stronger now okay so that's the\nfirst thing second thing that I would\nrecommend to help you be better at\ndiscipline is to to plan ahead and plan\nahead not as a form of oh I got to plan\nahead to get all this done and make\nsure I'm as efficient as possible no\nplan ahead to make it easier on yourself\nyou know plan your workouts ahead so\nthat when you walk up walk into the gym\nyou don't have to think as much you just\nliterally take action on what it is that\nyou need to do so plan ahead in some\nsort of way if you're trying to eat\nhealthier plan ahead your meal plans\nplan ahead in some sort of way to look\ninto the future versus being like Oh my\ngosh here I am I'm at the gym what\nshould I do oh now I gotta think about\nit now I got to find something oh do I\nwant to do legs today do I want whatever\nit is try to figure out a way to plan\nahead for the sole reason to make it\neasier on yourself to take the action\nthat you need to right I always think to\nmyself how can I make it easier when I\nused to do one-on-one coaching and my my\nclients would always say Okay I want to\ndo this this week I would always say how\ncan how can you make it easier on\nyourself let's try to figure out the\neasiest way to do it let's try to figure\nout the path of least resistance to get\nyou to the destination that you want so\nthat's the second thing is to try to\nplan ahead the third thing is to design\nyour environment to make it easier once\nagain for you to take action if you need\nto right so design your environment if\nyou want to wake up when the alarm clock\ngoes off well go ahead and take your\nphone and put on the other side of the\nroom that's designing your environment\nthere's also a an alarm clock I saw the\nother day that as soon as your alarm\ngoes off it's got wheels on it it'll\nfall off of the counter or off of the\nthe side table it'll roll around and you\nactually have to go and pick it up and\nturn it off as it's rolling around and\nrunning all over the place well that's a\nway to design your environment to make\nsure that you get out of bed whenever\nthe alarm goes off design your\nenvironment how can you make it easier\nhow can you remove Temptation you know\ncan you remove the the processed food\nfrom your house if you're trying to eat\nhealthier can you remove the sugar if\nyou're somebody who loves sugar like me\nI love sugar right I I don't have\nanything that's processed inside of my\nhouse or any sugar that's inside of my\nhouse if you want to stop drinking\nremove all of the\nalcohol and then as far as the\nenvironment goes can you also just try\nnot to get around people who will\nchallenge your discipline you know if\nyou're trying not to drink well then\nprobably good to maybe distance yourself\nat least for a little while from your\nfriends that love to party and they are\nthe ones that will always try to push it\non you if you have that or if you have a\nfriend that doesn't eat as healthy and\nyou want to start eating healthier for\nthe next 30 days maybe distance yourself\na little bit from them so how can you\ndesign your external environment to make\nit easier on yourself to take the action\nthat you need to that's number three\nnumber four focus on progress not\nperfection you will not be perfect and\nwhen you me mess up make adjustments\nwhen you mess up don't be an to\nyourself because all too often I see\npeople that will mess up in some sort of\nway they do like for instance they'll\nwork out they'll be on their their meal\nplan they'll do everything they need to\ndo they'll they'll be reading they'll be\ndoing the morning routine for 17 days\nand then they screw up one day and then\nthey get into self-pity and guilt and\nshame and beating themsel up and they\ndon't get back on track because of all\nthe shame and the guilt and everything\nno you're going to mess up when you mess\nup make adjustments what what made you\nmess up how can you avoid it next time\nstop judging yourself so much you're a\nhuman not a robot you're not going to do\neverything perfectly so focus on your\nprogress not your Perfection and so if\nyou if you did 17 days of of doing\nsomething well and you screwed up one\nday and the only thing that you're\nfocusing on is the one day where you\nscrewed up why not look at the progress\nthat you made and look at the 17 days\nwhere you actually did well and so\nthat's number four is to focus on\nprogress not Perfection and then the\nfifth one please reward yourself you are\nmore likely to show up tomorrow if\nyou're rewarding yourself for all the\nlittle things that you do so one of the\nthings I recommend like for some reason\nthis this episode I've been talking a\nlot about like meal prep and to be\nworking out and stuff right is to reward\nyourself please if you're eating really\nhealthy have have one cheat meal a week\nlike for me I eat really healthy but I\nhave one sheat meal a week where I'm\nallowed to go and eat pizza cuz I\nfreaking love it and I eat so much of it\nand I love it so much that I'm like all\nright I'm good for the rest of the week\nand then I look forward to the cheat\nmeal on Saturday nights where I'm like I\ncan't wait for Saturday night when I can\nhave that cheat meal and I love all the\nstuff that I eat like eating healthy can\nactually be really delicious too it's\nnot like you only eat you know piece of\nlettuce or anything like that so reward\nyourself in some sort of way if you eat\nreally well have a cheat meal if you\nmake a 100 calls and you get 100 calls\ndone have a piece of chocolate whatever\nit does to to make your brain it's\nactually something and I wrote about it\nin my book you can get my book if you\nwant to it's called level up but the\nentire last chapter chapter 12 is on\nyour dopamine reward systems and\ndeveloping a dopamine reward system to\ncelebrate yourself and to get your brain\nto actually start to fall in love with\nthe process of doing the things that you\nwant to have done and want to be done\nand so you actually develop a dopamine\nreward system so that you are more\nmotivated to do it again and so once\nagain it's in my book level up uh is\nwhat it's called it's available\neverywhere it's chapter 12 you can read\nit and I've also done episodes before\nabout dopamine reward systems but really\nit's about rewarding yourself so that\nyou want to show up and take the same\naction again tomorrow because all too\noften what do we do we go to the gym and\nthen instead of rewarding oursel for\ngoing to the gym then we look at oursel\nin the mirror and you're like ah you\ncould have worked out harder well you\nshould have shown up earlier so you you\ncould work out longer um you still look\nfat oh you still don't look good and\nthen instead of actually rewarding\nyourself and celebrating yourself and\nbeing proud of yourself you're still an\n to yourself right I hear this\nall the time from people so how can you\nreward yourself how can you celebrate\nyourself how can you get yourself to\nactually start to love the process of\nbeing more disciplined and taking the\naction that you need to so ultimately\ndiscipline is not something that is\nstruggling and white knuckling and\nforcing yourself to just to do something\ndiscipline is another Act of selflove\nbecause you need to develop discipline\nto do the things that are ultimately\ngoing to be the best for you in your\nlife so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your Instagram\nstories tag me in it Rob dial Jr R obdi\nA ljr the only way that we grow is from\nyou guys actually sharing this podcast\nand uh ultimately my only goal of this\npodcast is to help more people because I\nthink more people need to work on\nthemselves in this world and the world\nwould be better if more people worked on\nthemselves so if you would help us by\njust sharing this podcast more people\nwould be able to find it who have never\nheard of it before and hopefully we can\ncontinue to keep helping people in\nchanging the world in our own little\nspace of the world so if you do that i'\nwould greatly appreciate it and uh with\nthat I'm going to leave the same way I\nleave you every single episode make it\nyour mission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
