    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto give you a fstep process to stop\nbeing overwhelmed and to stop your\noverthinking let's dive in it seems like\npeople are getting more overwhelmed than\nnormal in fact I would say it seems like\nto me what I've noticed is that people\nare more overwhelmed or seem overwhelmed\nor anxious or stressed since 2020 it\nseems like people are just getting more\noverwhelmed and stressed in general and\nso there's a lot happening in the world\nright now there's a lot happening in the\nworld everywhere\nand I don't know if we're ever going to\nget to a point in our lives where\nthere's not a lot happening in the world\nwhen you have 8 billion people there's\nalways good there's always bad it's just\nalways going to be that way there's\nalways people fighting there's always\npeople doing things there's always\ncountries that hate each other there's\nalways people getting elected and other\nsides yelling at them and there's always\nstuff\nhappening but with a lot that's\nhappening right now what we need to do\nis to figure out how to emotionally\nregulate ourselves\nI've done episodes in the past on how to\nself sooth and how to get good at that\nbut I want to just give you a really\nsimple five-step process to really start\nto allow yourself to not be so\noverwhelmed because a lot of times if we\nare not being conscious of our\noverwhelmed it kind of takes over to be\nso stressed and be so anxious all the\ntime so I just want to give you a simple\nfive-step process just to really help\nyou out the first thing is go to your\nbreath the first thing that I always do\nI am human as much as any other person\nalive I get stressed I get anxious I get\noverwhelmed I just happen to have a\ncouple Tools in in my tool belt that I\ncan pull out and help to get myself out\nof that state faster than I used to\nbefore the the first thing that I always\ngo to is my breath I do breath work at\nleast two to three times a day sometimes\nit's for calming down sometimes it's for\nenergy sometimes it's to get into\nmeditation depending on what it is just\nanother tool in the tool belt right the\nquickest way to change your State you've\nheard me say it so many times in this\npodcast is six deep breaths the breath\nis always the first thing to change in\nany state change that we have as humans\nso if our breath is a first SC change\nlike if we get overwhelmed if we get\nanxious if we get stressed our breath\ngets shorter and as our breath gets\nshorter we get less oxygen as we get\nless oxygen we become more stressed out\nand so it perpetuates the thing that\nwe're trying to actually reverse and so\nthe first thing I always do is is now\nthat I'm aware that I feel stressed or\nanxious or\noverwhelmed I go to my breath and I do\n60 breaths it's in through the nose out\nthrough the mouth and when I breathe out\nthrough the moue is like breathing out\nthrough a straw the longer that you can\nexhale the more it actually slows your\nheart rate down so your breath changes\nbut your heart rate also changes when\nyou become overwhelmed or stress as well\nso by breath I can start to regulate my\nbreathing and I can start to regulate my\nheart rate those that alone is going to\nmake your state change there was a study\nthat was done years ago I think it's a\nJapanese study that found that six deep\nbreaths can change someone's State\nalmost immediately so as you're doing\nthis breath think of something that you\nlove think of Somebody That You Love\nthink of something that you're grateful\nfor start to bring in the positive\nemotions right and you have to\nunderstand when our emotion is high our\nlogic is low so we don't make good\ndecisions when we're in an overwhelmed\nState when our emotion is higher logic\nis low which means that even when we're\nmore stressed or more overwhelmed we\nmake worse decisions which then\nperpetuate again the way that we feel\nand so the first thing I always go back\nto six deep breaths in through nose out\nthrough mouth I breathe out through a\nmouth I try to make my exhale anywhere\nbetween 6 to 10 seconds okay then what I\nlike to do personally is what I have\nfound is if I can get a pen and paper\nand I can just flood that piece of paper\nwith everything that's going on in my\nhead it helps a lot I was on vacation\nlast week I was gone for an entire week\nI left my phone in the safe I didn't do\nanything business and then I came back I\nback got back on Sunday night Sunday\nnight I fell asleep at about 10:00 I\nwoke up at 1 and I could not fall back\nasleep and so I had to use this strategy\non myself cuz I immediately went into\nwork mode I immediately started thinking\nabout all the things I needed to do and\nwe're in the middle of hiring people so\nI started thinking about the hiring\nprocess all of that right so all of this\nstuff started coming into my head so all\nI did was I got myself out into my\nliving room I did some breathing Tech\ntechniques and I wrote down everything\nthat was going on in my head I had to\nget it out of my head everything all the\nBS that you got to do everything that's\nstressing you out all of your thoughts\nall of your feelings all of your fears\nallow the mind to release all of it so\nthat you can just leave it on the page\nfor me a lot of questions came up which\nwas an interesting thing what are we\ngoing to do about this what are we going\nto do about that what are we going to do\nabout leads what are we going to do\nabout this what did we used to do a year\nago compared to what we now and I\nstarted comparing and I was like there\nwas just so many questions that came\nthrough and I had literally two pages\nstraight of just\nwriting now did that make it go away no\ndid it relieve me a ton because I was\nlike okay now I've got it and so this is\na tactic that literally I used myself\nthree days ago and so um it helps it\nreally does help and it's something I do\nall the time then what you do is you\nlook at everything that you put down you\nlook at your entire to-do list and you\njust ask yourself one question what's\nthe next best action to take what is the\nnext best action to take because a lot\nof times when we get overwhelmed what\nwe're doing is we're thinking about\ndoing our entire to-do list right now in\nthis moment right you've done this\nbefore you have a to-do list of 24\nthings and you're thinking to yourself I\nneed to get all of them done and you're\ngetting overwhelmed because you're not\nthinking about the one thing you need to\ndo now you're thinking about all of the\nthings you need to do now but you're\nthinking about them in this very moment\nas if you can do all of them at once and\nyou can't usually when you're feeling\noverwhelmed you're think about all of\nthe different things that need to be all\nthe actions need to be taken the the 12\nthings that you need to do in your\nbusiness the seven things that you need\nto do for your kids when they get home\nthe 18 things that are going wrong in\nyour life right now the 43 things that\nare going wrong in the world right now\nit's too much your brain does not have\nthe processing power the same way that\nyour computer can be overwhelmed and\nslow down when you have way too many\ntabs open your brain the exact same\nthing your brain as a human can only do\none thing at a time multitasking is a\nlie and so part of why you're so\nstressed out and so overwhelmed is\nbecause you want everything to be done\nnow and it's not possible you can only\ndo one thing at a time so you you can't\ndo all things and so if you're\noverthinking and you're overwhelmed by\nthese things a lot of times it's because\nyou're thinking about everything and you\ncan't do everything and you have to be\nokay with that and so you've got to look\nat it and say what is the next best\naction I could take if there's one thing\non my to-do list that can relieve me\nfrom from the most amount of stress the\nbiggest lever that I can pull right now\nwhat would it be and then you do that\none thing and it kind of goes back to\nthe the the book that I've mentioned a\nfew times children's book and it's also\na children's movie I think it's on Apple\nTV which is called the boy the mole the\nfox the horse and there's a moment where\nthe little boy is starting to feel he's\nwalking through the forest and he's\nstressed out there's a storm that's\ngoing through and um the boy says I I\ncan't see through the forest there's\njust so many things there I can't see\nthrough the forest and the horse goes\ncan you see your next step and he says\nyes and he says just take that that's\nexactly what overwhelm is that's just a\ngreat little story from a a child to\nmake children understand it which is\nwe're seeing the entire Forest we're\nseeing the storm that's hitting Us in\nthe face we're seeing all of that at\nonce when reality we just need to look\ndown and can we see our next step can we\nidentify the next step yes okay just\ntake that it's one freaking step at a\ntime we think that we have to do 10\nthings at once you could do one at once\nokay so those things will start to allow\nyour your mind to calm down a little bit\noh God it's not so crazy all right so\nthat's number three what's the next\naction I could take what's the best\naction I could take what's the biggest\nlever I can pull okay number four is to\nget your physical body moving whatever\nit might be do jumping jacks go for a\nrun go for a walk a lot of times when\nwe're feeling overwhelmed we're thinking\nabout all the things that need to be\ndone but we're not doing any of them so\nwe're we're literally sitting on the\ncouch stressing the hell out and doing\nnothing whatever it needs to happen you\njust need to get your physical body\nmoving you know it's it's usually when\nyou're sitting on the couch doing\nnothing that the overwhelm hits you\nright it's usually when you're in the\naction of moving like like Tony Robbins\nalways says progress equals happiness\nwhen we're progressing and have that\nforward motion of we actually feel like\nwe're progressing and and we're checking\nthings off of our to-do list and we're\nyou know we're not done with the the\nto-do list we're actually not done with\nthe first action on the to-do list but\nwe can see the light at the end of the\ntunnel for that first action we start to\nfeel better so what is the action that\nneeds to be taken and then start to move\ntowards whatever it is like don't do the\naction yet just get your physical body\nmoving right if we're sitting on the\ncouch and we're overwhelmed just get up\ndo something get your heart rate going\nright now that we've we've regulated our\nbody we've regulated our mind a little\nbit now it's time to actually get the\nphysical body moving because action\ncreates more action inaction creates\nmore inaction and so what we need to do\nis get up and get our physical body\nmoving we don't need to check anything\noff of the list yet nothing yet that's\nwhat we're going to do in the next step\nwe just got to get up and get our\nphysical body moving whatever it is that\nyou need to do you need to become you\nneed to have some sort of practice that\nyou have when you find yourself getting\noverwhelmed and so you can go through\nthese these steps but what is your one\nstep is it I'm going to get up once I've\nidentified once I figured all this out\nI'm going to do a 100 jumping jacks I'm\nGNA I'm going to go for a a 10-minute\nwalk maybe I'll go run on my treadmill\nfor five minutes whatever it is to get\nyour body physically moving so we know\naction creates more action so if I'm\ngoing to take a little bit action it's\ngoing to turn into more\naction\nand then last thing number five very\nsimple take action on the one thing now\nthat you have some you have a you have\neverything cleared out it's all out of\nyour head now that you've got a little\nbit of a plan now you know what the best\naction to take is now that you've gotten\nyour physical body moving and you you've\nhave some body movement ride that\nmomentum to the most important thing\nwhich is to now take action to do one\nthing and one thing only and to set your\ntimer and I have episodes on this in the\npast if you want to go listen to it it's\ncalled the pomodora technique set your\ntimer for 25 minutes and make a a mental\ncontract with yourself that you're not\ngoing to do anything in this world\nexcept for that one thing for the next\n25\nminutes that's it you set a timer you\ndon't look at your phone again you don't\nwrite things down you say this is the\nthing that needs to be done needs to be\ndone I'm going to do this one thing and\nyou have to be the person that starts\ngetting really good at doing the one\nthing just doing one thing become like a\nsniper rifle not a shotgun right a\nshotgun just blast little pellets all\nover the place a sniper rifle you can\nsee something and you can hit it from\n300 yards away and you can hit that\nthing that's what you need to start\ndoing you start to start becoming very\nsurgical on what is the next action that\nI can take that is going to make me feel\nlike I'm progressing that's going to\nrelieve my stress that's going to\nrelieve my overwhelm I'm going to put on\na Time timer I'm going to put on my\nheadphones I'm going to give myself 25\nminutes and I'm going to do nothing else\nexcept for this thing then after that\nI'm going to take a five minute break\nand then I say to myself is that thing\nfinished like if you did finish the task\nwell then go to the next task if you\ndidn't finish the task in those 25\nminutes but you made really good Headway\nall right well let's go for another 25\nminutes you know it's it's hard to get\noverwhelmed when you're only thinking\nabout one thing it's hard to get\noverwhelmed Med and it you're you're\nliterally just thinking about one thing\nand one thing only you're not putting\nthe extra stress in yourself the extra\noverwhelmed the extra overthinking\nyou're going okay I've got this one\nthing I got to do I'm going to focus on\nthis one thing and that's simply it I\nwant you to understand though that uh if\nyou feel overwhelmed that is a natural\nthing humans we feel overwhelmed a lot\nif you're feeling overwhelmed too often\nwell then you need to have a process\nlike this of of doing some breathing of\nputting your thoughts down a piece of\npaper identifying the most important\nthing getting your body moving and\ntaking the right action and um you know\nwhat it really comes down to is a\nretraining process a lot of us what we\nhave done I noticed this when I was\nyounger and I I wasn't really a person\nthat was like I would say a high\nperformance person is I had patterns\nWithin Myself And when I would find\nmyself getting stressed or overwhelmed\nmy pattern was to\ndisconnect was to do something else was\nto procrastinate it was to not do the\nthing because thinking of the thing\nbrought in too much stress and overwhelm\nin the first place so me actually the\nfeeling of oh my God now I got to dive\ninto this thing made me think I was\ngoing to get more stressed and\noverwhelmed but as I started actually\ntaking the action started doing the\nthings that need to be done I realized\nit relieved my stress and overwhelm and\nas I started to notice that it relieved\nit I started to to work to develop new\npatterns Within Myself to take action on\nthe things that need to be done to not\nbe overwhelmed and now it gets to the\npoint where do I have stress and\noverwhelm yeah of course everybody does\nanxiety of course everybody does but\nwhen I notice them when I become aware\nof them you know I can't I can't change\nanything that I'm not aware of but when\nI become aware of it I can change it so\nwhen I become aware of okay I feel like\nI feel a little bit tight in my chest I\nfeel a little bit like you know like I'm\nI'm shortness of breath I feel my my\nheart's just pumping like crazy okay I'm\nnot going to let this take control\nbecause I'm it's taking control of me\nright now I'm going to take a step back\nand I'm going to be in control of this\nI'm going to do my breathing I'm going\nto follow the five-step process and what\nyou real is if you have this actual\nprocess this practice that you use you\nwill be able to remove your stress your\nanxiety your overwhelm your overthinking\nmuch much faster than you have been able\nto in the past and that is the simple\nsimple five-step process to stop being\nso over overwhelmed so if you got like\nthis
