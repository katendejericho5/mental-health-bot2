    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be diving into how to actually\ntruly find your true self and who you\nwant to be let's dive in it's kind of\ngoes hand inand with the last episode\nthat we had um where I talked about the\nkey to self-love is self-acceptance and\nif you haven't listened to that episode\nyou can always go back and listen to\nthat episode after this one if you want\nto before if you want to it's completely\nup to you um but in today's episode I'm\nreally going to talk to you about why\nyou really as a person and uh as someone\nwho has an identity and develops a\npersonality why you actually need to\nlose yourself in your lifetime so that\nyou can come back around and find\nyourself hopefully find yourself uh in\nyour lifetime now the the reason why I\nsay this and the reason why I am hopeful\nfor you uh is because you have now\nbecome aware if you listen to this\npodcast you're somebody who's into\npersonal growth you're into\nself-discovery you're into personal\ndevelopment and you've gotten to the\npoint where you realize that in order to\nmake your life better in order to\nimprove your life you need to work on\nyourself one of the things that you'll\nfind throughout your journey of\nself-development I've been on mine now\nfor 19 years one of the things that\nyou'll find is that it's actually really\nthe path of self-development is really\nthe path of self-discovery of\nrediscovering who you truly are and\nbecoming more and more of your truest\nself because when you look at the the\nJourney of life you you are in your\ntruest form at Birth that is a a perfect\nhuman obviously you know the baby has\nnothing they're as far as like knowledge\nthey're knowledg less about this world\nbut they're perfect they haven't been\nchanged they haven't been told that\nthey're not good enough not smart enough\nnot pretty enough they haven't developed\nthoughts uh because thoughts come from\nlanguage and they haven't developed any\nof that so they are kind of in it they\ntheir purest form as a human and as I\nmentioned in the last episode as time\ngoes goes on we are changed from our\ntruest self we are um Changed by our\nparents we are changed by Society we are\nchanged by our peers we are changed by\nourselves comparing ourselves to other\npeople we're Changed by seeing\nadvertisements in thinking to ourselves\ndamn I must not be good enough so I need\nto change myself so that I look more\nlike her that I look more like him oh my\nbody doesn't look good enough and and\nreally it it kind of turns into this\nsituation where we mold ourselves into\nsomebody that we think we need to be in\norder to fit in and order to be accepted\nso we're conditioned and we're\nsocialized to fit in and that's from\nonce again everyone from our parents to\nevery single interaction that we have\nthings that we see things that we think\nall of that stuff and so we're\nconditioned and socialized to fit in AKA\nwe are domesticated right and so what\nhappens is in this case we break from\nfrom our true selves and we break away\nfrom the truest version of who we are\nand honestly like I said in the last\nepisode I don't think that there is any\nother way I don't think that there is a\nway to raise a child that doesn't break\nfrom their true self if they're going to\nbe in society if they're going to be\naround other people if they're going to\nit's just natural for all of this to\nhappen and it's also natural for us just\nto compare ourselves to other people and\nI believe that it is the one of breaking\naway from your true self at childhood\nand going off of this path of your true\nself I believe actually is is is the\nmost important part to eventually\nhopefully being able to identify who you\ntruly are and going on that path of\nrediscovery I believe this is how you\nfind yourself because you cannot find\nyourself your true self and work towards\nthat every single day unless you have\nlost yourself first this is just the way\nthat life go goes and um for me since I\nbecame aware of this and and got so far\noff track of who I truly was one day I\nbecame aware of this and hopefully\nyou're starting to become aware of this\nand hopefully this episode helps to\nbecome more aware of it is now my path\nis not how do I become the best version\nof myself how do I become better how do\nI make more money how do I do all of\nthis stuff my thing is how do I how do I\nstart going more and more on the path to\nbecome my truest version of myself not\nthe path that I not not who I think I\nshould be not who other people have told\nme I should be not um that I was\nconditioned to think that I should be\nwhen I was a child but like how can I be\nmy truest self no matter what and I am\nnot there yet but I have been on this\npath for years now to try to uh get back\nto my truest self and I think that if I\nlook at myself and you could probably\nlook at yourself as well I can think of\nmany times throughout my lifetime where\nI lost\nmyself you could probably think of many\ntimes in your lifetime where you've lost\nyourself you know I can think of many\ntimes where I thought that I should be\nsomebody else and I should be someone\nthat I maybe didn't want to fully be\njust so I could fit in you know I\nremember I've said this before in the\npodcast I can remember um in Middle\nSchool the exact moment on the school\nbus where we were um in the exact moment\nwhen I said something that was really\nmean to another kid on the school bus\nand I said it because I thought that\nother kids would think it was funny and\nI felt terrible after I still feel you\nknow 20-some years later 27 years later\nwhatever it might be I still feel\nterrible about it CU I was like damn\nthat was such a shitty thing to say you\nknow I was like what 11 years old 12\nyears old and I said this thing and I'm\nlike man I can't believe I I still feel\nbad about that and I said it because I\njust wanted to be accepted and I didn't\nfeel accepted why like why did I want to\nbe accepted well I think if I look at\nmyself and and how I was subconsciously\nas a kid I think I probably didn't feel\naccepted by my father fully because he\nwas an alcoholic and because he would\nnot be around and there was some some\nemotional neglect that came from that\nand so because of the fact that I didn't\nfeel fully accepted there I wanted to be\naccepted somewhere else and so I think\nthat happens for all of us we all lose\nourselves in so many ways throughout our\nlife and we lose ourselves to then have\na moment of is this who I am is is this\nwho I want to be or do I want to be\nsomebody else you know we get into\nrelationships and uh we fall for people\nwho end up hurting us in the long run\nright I'm sure many people listening\nright now I've person personally done it\nhave have gotten into a relationship\nwith somebody and we have a pretty good\nidea this ain't going to go very well\nand they end up hurting us in the long\nrun and sometimes we change ourselves\nlike so many people change who they are\nin a relationship with somebody in order\nto fit in in order to feel like that\nperson accepts them and a lot of times\npeople want to change the person that\nthey're in a relationship with and so we\ntry to change other people they try to\nchange us and we kind of become these\nlike chameleons where you know I'm this\nway in front of this person I'm this way\nthis way in front of my mom and I'm this\nway in front of my girlfriend I'm this\nway in front of uh other people I'm this\nway in front of my friends and if we're\nconstantly being somebody else depending\non who we're around that's not our true\nself our true self would be and this is\nwhy it's a path of rediscovery we find\nout who we truly are and we are that\nperson in front of every single person\nno matter who they are like it's not\nlike oh you know I've got to be this way\nin front of her I've got to be this way\nin front of him I've got to be this way\nin front of this group of people oh I'm\non a podcast I've got to be this way\nit's got to be I need to figure out who\nI am and once I figure out who I am I\nneed to try to stay in as firm in that\nperson that I could possibly be because\nwe change ourselves so think about that\nif have you ever lost your ourself in a\nrelationship I'm sure many people have\nand so what happens is we lose oursel in\nthe relationship and then the\nrelationship ends and then we're like\nwait who the hell am I like I I have a\nfriend specifically she was dating a guy\nuh years ago and he was really into Star\nWars and she got really into Star Wars\nand she went and saw all the movies and\nhad all these things and they were\ntogether for like I 3 or four years\nwhatever it was and they went through a\nbreakup and she was like I hate\nStar Wars right but she went to all of\nthe things and she acted like it she she\ntried to make herself like Star Wars and\nshe never actually liked Star Wars right\nand so how many of us do this in so many\nways how many of us you know when we're\nin Middle School we're in high school we\nchange ourself and mold oursel and make\noursel you know we're like a chameleon\nlike everybody else we wear the same\nthings as them we talk the same way we\nhave the same interests as them in high\nschool and middle school so that we fit\nin with a group of people so that they\nwill once again accept us you know like\nin high school uh I used to smoke a lot\nof weed even though I never really like\nthe way that I felt because I hung out\nwith all of the Surfers and everybody\ndid right and so I was like all right I\nguess this is just I guess this is the\nwhat we do you know and so I did it even\nthough I didn't really like how I felt\nso that was me like just putting myself\nand saying hey I'm going to be this way\ncan you guys all accept me right and\nthen I took that that that smoking and\ndrinking and all that stuff and I\ncarried it into college and I was\ndrinking and partying like crazy because\nthat's what everybody did when in\nreality I think what I was really just\ndoing and I think this is what a lot of\nus do in reality I was just drinking and\npartying to numb the fact that I didn't\nfeel like I knew who I was anymore I was\nnumbing the fact that that I I think a\nlot of us uh numb and struggle with\nself-acceptance because our truest self\nthat's deep down below all of that\nconditioning that we've had our truest\nself doesn't accept our conditioned self\nso like our conditioned self is who\nwe've grown oursel into our true self is\nwho we truly are from birth and we know\nthis person's behind the scenes it's\nlike that voice that's in the back of\nyour head that intuition I think the\ntruest self is actually doesn't accept\nour conditioned self and so what happens\na lot of times is we numb\nourselves in in all of those things in\nlife and there's so many of them that\nhappen over and over and over again\nthousands of times throughout I'm sure\nour childhood adolescence you know uh\nCollege High School all of that all of\nthem are super freaking hard like\nthey're incredibly hard to go through\nthose to go through some of those but\nthe important thing is is they are\nincredible lessons if we allow them to\nbe the problem is that I don't think\nmost people understand this I don't\nthink most people understand that all of\nthose tough moments where we do lose\nourselves where we do get kicked out of\nthe crowd where we do get made fun of\nfor being a certain way whatever it\nmight be I don't think enough people\nunderstand that those are lessons and\neven if you didn't extract the lesson in\nthat moment like sometimes somebody does\nbreak up with you you realize you've\nlost yourself and you go you know what\nscrew this I'm going to be alone for six\nmonths and I'm going to ReDiscover who I\ntruly am sometimes we do do that but\nsometimes you go through and you might\nhave been broken up with or had a\nterrible breakup six six years ago and\nyou can now look back and say okay it's\nbeen six years how did I lose myself who\ndid I become do I want to be this person\ndo I want to change this person do what\nis my truest self want to do I think\nthat we need to get completely lost in\norder to find ourselves and what we need\nto do is we need to lose like every\npiece of who we are in order to build\nourselves back up from scratch and say\nhold on let me let me let me just wipe\nthis slate clean let me figure out who I\nam you know I didn't realize this until\nI was in my 30s and most people are we\njust do what we're told you know we\nwe're in school and before school we\njust do what our parents tell us to do\nwe get into school and in first grade\nthey say hey You' you've got to get good\ngrades so you can get into second grade\nand then you got to get good grades you\ngot to be a good boy and girl so you can\nget into third grade and then you get\ninto middle school and you've got to get\nin you've got to get get your grades in\nmiddle school so you can get a high\nschool and you definitely got to get\ngood grades in high school so you can\nget into a college right you can get\ninto a good college and then you've got\nto do really well in college so that you\ncan do you know get a good job and then\nonce you get a good job then you can\nclimb the corporate router so you got to\ndo really good and we just kind of we\nkind of just follow this path we kind of\ndo what we're told and or do what we\nfeel we're supposed to be doing based\noff of what all of society is reflecting\nback to us and at some point in time we\nwake up and we're like what the am\nI doing with my life this is this is\nwhere a midlife crisis comes from is\npeople wake up and say what am I doing\nhow did I get here I don't want this you\nknow they just wake up one day and they\nhave a life that they feel like they\ndidn't want or create for themselves\nthey just kind of followed the herd and\nthat is a a really really hard moment\nbut the moment is a moment of\ntransformation if they let it be and\nthat's when we really have to stop\nlooking externally and we really have to\nstart searching internally you know what\nwhat parts of the old me of my\nconditioned self need to die it's like\nit's like you know shedding of a skin a\nskin needs to a snake needs to shed its\nskin as much as it possibly can you know\nlike I I remember uh and I've told this\nbefore on the podcast the one of the\nmost life-changing conversations I ever\nhad with uh was with one of my first\nmentors Matt and I was running an office\nfor this company that had 700 offices we\nwere the number one office in the United\nStates we were killing it the company\nwas like a $ 250 million year company\nand we were number one out of 700 and\nsome odd offices I was 21 I thought it\nwas just hot I thought I was\nkilling I thought I was awesome and he\nhe calls me up he's like hey can we go\nget lunch I'm like yeah we meet at\nChipotle we sit down and like a\nimmediately he wasn't he was very short\nto the point but said it with love he's\nlike hey I don't know how to tell you\nthis but a lot of people don't like you\nI was like what like in my mind I'm\nkilling I'm like running in a born\noffice I thought I was great he's like a\nlot of people don't like you because uh\nbecause you present yourself uh in a way\nthat is not who you truly are like this\nwas a conversation where he made me\nrealize I was not being my trueu self\nhe's like I know your heart I know who\nyou are and you don't present that to\nother people and I think it's because\nyou're afraid of being vulnerable and so\nmy whole thing was I would show you know\nI would I would say things that were\nwere a little bit more Brash and would\nkind of cut people deep so that\ntherefore they wouldn't come back and\ncut me because I was so vulnerable and\nso weak and so afraid of being wounded\nthat I was like I'm going to hurt you\nfirst so you don't hurt me and I was\nprotecting myself because my my sense of\nselfworth was so fragile and I started\nthinking of like oh my god do I want to\nbe that person how did I get this way\nfirst off like I was think thinking that\nI like how did I become this way is that\nwho I truly am is this who I want to be\nno like this part of me needs to shut\noff I need to get rid of this and it\nwasn't like a get rid of it one day kind\nof thing that part of me has been\nfalling away for that conversation was\nyou know now 16 years ago so 16 years\nI'm just just continue to keep shedding\nit right because I was 21 at the time so\nthat's 21 years of building up and so\nI'm slowly still shedding it and you\nknow it's it's crazy how many ways we l\nlose ourselves you know so many of us\nlose ourselves to and become somebody\nthat we need to be for our parents and\nfor society and so many of us lose\nourselves in romantic relationships and\num you know become somebody that we're\nnot hoping to please the other person\nand you lose yourself and then you have\nto refine yourself and it's all of this\nis just a path of rediscovering who you\ntruly are you know have you ever lost\nyourself in a relationship with a family\nmember where you have to act a certain\nway with your mom because you know how\nshe's going to react you have to act a\ncertain way with your dad and you make\nsure you don't cuss in front of Grandma\nand all this have you ever lost yourself\nin friendships where you become a\nchameleon to everyone else around you\nand then you you end up not liking\nyourself or you become a chameleon in a\njob and you've got to be a certain way\nso that you're accepted and you you have\nto make sure that you get a certain job\ntitle like that actually matters or you\nyou go and get a degree that you don't\nwant because your parents told you to or\nbecause um everyone that's that's looks\nlike you has the same one or if you\ndon't if you're not a a doctor or a\nlawyer you're a failure or you know\nyou're a guy so you should do this or\nyou're female sh you should do this and\nwe have all of these things of what we\nthink we should do and think we should\nbe versus actually just checking in with\noursel and saying who am I truly and who\ndo I want to be and so really the way\nthat you actually start to to find\nyourself is to first off the the first\nway like if you're driving your car the\nfirst way to realize uh and start to to\nget on the right path is to realize oh\nmy gosh like I'm way off of course I\nneed to get back on course so the first\nthing you need to become aware of is\nlike have I lost myself in some ways and\nif you have okay great you know we can\nwork through that we can start to it's a\nprocess we can do it and you start to\nask yourself like how have I lost myself\nhave I changed myself for other people\nand then in reality who do I truly want\nto be you know and start thinking about\nlike if if I were to be able to be at my\nfuneral and I were to see what's being\nsaid about me at the eulogy what would I\nwant people to say about me what would I\nwant people to say about my not not\nabout what my job title was or what how\nmuch money I made or how much I did you\nknow had cars or clothes or whatever it\nmight be houses in certain locations you\ndon't want that that's not what you want\npeople say about you at your funeral\nnone of that matters what are the\ncharacteristics what are the habits what\nare the traits how did you make people\nfeel and start to develop this version\nof yourself of like hey this is who I\nfeel like I truly am like these these\nare my values these are my\ncharacteristics my traits that I say\nthis is who I know it feels true inside\nmy body that I truly am and then what\nyou do is you wake up and you look at\nthat list and you become more of that\nevery single day and if you do that\nevery single day and you become a little\nbit more a little bit more a little bit\nmore eventually you'll fast forward in 5\nor 10 years from today and you'll\nactually be the person that you want to\nbe and it be the person that you truly\nare not the person that you've been\nconditioned to be so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you
