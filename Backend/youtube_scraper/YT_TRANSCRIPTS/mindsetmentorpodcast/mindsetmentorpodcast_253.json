    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to get better at\nself-love and self-acceptance I'm going\nto teach you how to get better at but\nI'm also going to teach you why we all\nhave the feeling of lack of self-love so\nthat we can fix it we can get better and\nwe can improve let's dive in so many\npeople struggle with self-love and um I\nhad a conversation I was on a zoom call\nuh from mindset M University the other\nday and a lady had brought this up and\nshe was she was asking about selflove\nand and how do I get better at loving\nmyself and I understand after talking\nwith so many people that we can be so so\ncruel to ourselves like we can be so\nmean to ourselves in our heads a lot of\npeople listening out there are meaner to\nyourself than any bully has ever been in\nyour entire life and that's okay for now\nbecause now you're aware of it and\nsomething you cannot change something\nthat you're not aware of but now that\nyou are aware of it uh that you need to\nget better at self-love and\nself-acceptance now it's something that\nwe can start to to transition into\nworking on and really what it comes down\nto is we need to get better at accepting\nourselves I think self-love is a great\nphrase but I think the problem is not\nthe love I think the problem is the lack\nof acceptance of ourselves we feel like\nthe version of us that we are should be\ndifferent and I'm going to talk about\nwhy that comes up I'm going to talk\nabout how to get better at it it's not\nreally a about love what it is is about\nself-acceptance there's a aspect of\nmyself that I don't accept and because\nof that it is a barrier to me loving\nmyself right the barrier to self-love is\nself-acceptance to accept yourself fully\nas you are the good the bad the\nBeautiful the ugly all of that because\nbehind self-judgment is love and the\ndoorway to get there is the acceptance\nand so I really believe that the natural\nstate of a human is love and so like for\ninstance I don't see I don't see babies\nor you know toddlers with self-love\nissues which means it's somehow it's\nlearned that we we can't accept\nourselves as we are and so then I I\nalways think to myself whenever I find\nsomething that people bring up a lot and\nI'm working on with myself I always take\na step back and I'm like why if if I\nwant to accept myself more yeah I want\nto know how to do that but first off why\nis it so hard to accept ourselves like\nwhy is it so hard for me to accept\nmyself and if you can really start to\nunderstand this and what I'm going to\ntalk about today um it could absolutely\nchange your life and your perspective on\nyourself and everyone else around you\nand as I've been doing a lot of you know\nover the past 19 years of working on\nmyself as I've been working on myself as\nI've been helping other people who are\nworking on theirselves what I've come to\nrealize by watching watching people by\nthinking it you know about what's going\non is we have been socialized so that we\ncan fit in with the world so that we can\nfit in with society and our parents are\nput under pressure to socialize us to\nmake us fit in right and a child does\nnot fit in with our social constructs it\ndoesn't and the children are naturally a\nlittle bit wild they're a little bit\nloud they don't fit in with the way that\nwe're quote unquote supposed to act act\nin public you know I I was reminded of\nthis a couple years ago when I was at a\ndinner and we were in a a pretty nice\nrestaurant it was my my friend and his\nchildren were there and his son was\nprobably 2 and a half three years old\nand in the middle of the dinner he just\nscreamed as loud as he could that was\nthe natural emotional feeling for that\nchild at that moment for some reason but\nI'm telling you at dinner it did not fit\nin and and I was it was just very\napparent to me of like and he was like\nHey shh no no no you can't do that here\nlike this is a quiet thing and so there\nthere was nothing wrong and and mind you\nI'm not trying to tell anybody who's a\nparent that you're doing it wrong I'm\nnot trying to tell you any of this I'm\njust trying to help you become a little\nbit more aware of of yourself first off\nand then also maybe just the way that\nyou interact with your children right\nand one thing that that tends to happen\nwith a lot of parents is a lot of\nparents will um emotionally reward or\npunish a child based off of how they act\nso it's kind of like hey if you're good\nyou get my love if you're bad I remove\nmy love and a lot of us have been raised\nby parents who use this tactic probably\nunconsciously on us to make us do what\nwe wanted they wanted us to do now mind\nyou children are crazy like they are\npretty nuts right like you got to keep\nthem alive you got to you got to\nsometimes they want to jump off of a\n10-ft wall or something like that so you\ndo have to make sure that you keep them\nalive but when you you start to think\nabout it if a child who doesn't really\nhave the uh the processing that we do\nand the knowledge that we do as adults\nif a if a parent unconsciously does the\nsame things that their parents did to\nthem which is hey if you're good you get\nmy love if you're bad I remove my love\nthere's no reasoning process for this in\nthe child's head a child doesn't really\nfully understand everything yet because\nthey're still young a child realizes\nthat certain ways that it is are\nnaturally not\nacceptable and it's not conscious it's\njust very subconscious and everything's\ngoing in and out but if I act this way\nI'm I'm a good boy if I act this way I'm\na bad boy if I do this if I'm loud in in\na in a restaurant my Mom feels like\nshe's pulling her love for me or my dad\nfeels like you're pulling love for me\nit's not really something that they\nconsciously think about it just kind of\nall happens and um there was a stat that\nI read back in 2009 that really like\nblew this all out of the water for me\nand really started making me understand\npeople more and it is the average child\nis reprimanded eight times more than\nthey're\npraised the average child is reprimanded\neight times more than they're praised\ndon't do that no you can't do that you\ngot to be quiet you got to sit down you\ngot to do this and so if you take a step\nback what is the child subconsciously\nthinking most of the time eight times\nmore than I am good enough they're\nthinking to themselves unconsciously I'm\nnot good enough the way I am and that's\nwhy literally every single person's core\nParadigm that I've ever worked with\nthousands and thousands of people is I'm\nnot enough and the biggest fear is if\nI'm not enough then I won't be loved and\nso the child unconsciously has to change\nitself so that it can fit in with\nsociety and with the way that the\nparents want that child to be and so if\nyou think of that the child has to\nchange itself which means that there's\nparts of itself it has to actually adapt\nwhich means we start developing this\nfeeling of I don't accept myself the way\nthat I am I've got to change I've got to\nbe different and so we the child has to\nlet go of a lot of aspects of itself\nbased off of what the parents tell them\nbut all the child really cares about is\ndoes my mom love me does my dad love me\nand when I'm having fun and I'm running\naround in public and my mom yells at me\nI must have done something wrong there's\nan aspect of myself that is wrong now a\nkid could be you know I've seen it many\ntimes running around and screaming and\nstuff like that and the parent\nreprimands the child in public because\nthey're too loud or because they're\nbeing too rambunctious or crazy or\nwhatever it is it might be and so the\nchild gets reprimanded in its full\nexpression having fun laughing having a\ngreat time and its full expression the\nchild is in reprimanded which makes them\nthink in my full expression in my truest\nversion of who I am my mom yelled at me\nAKA retracted love for me so therefore\nthis aspect of myself is wrong I am not\naccepted as I naturally am if I am\nacting uh if I'm not acting right then I\nmust be wrong so you're seeing what I'm\npicking up and how how I'm kind of\nbringing this in is that we naturally as\nchildren being socialized and being you\nknow as I always say domesticated more\nthan anything else we kind of learn not\nto accept ourselves as we are because\nthere must be something wrong and so\nthisen happens so frequently I mean so\nso frequently as I become aware of this\nas I coached people you know for almost\ntwo decades at this point everything I'm\nstart I see it I see it all of the time\neverywhere I go you know I see it in\npublic I see it in uh friends that have\ntheir children and stuff like that and I\nhonestly don't know I don't know I've\nbeen thinking for a long time I don't\nknow if there's a way around it I don't\nknow if in order to keep a Child Alive\nthere we can like you have sometimes you\nhave to be a little bit more firm so\nthat they don't do something dangerous\nlike running to the middle of the road\nright right but what happens is we all\ntypically learn from a very young age\nduring this socialization process that\nwe are in some way not good enough as we\nare and we must act a certain way in\norder to be accepted or in order to get\nour parents love or in order to be the\nway that we need to be to fit in and we\nhave to act a certain way even if that\ncertain way is not\nme and that result the result of that is\na feeling of like unworthiness because\nof this socialization and so your your\nperson personality from the beginning\nhas been built upon repressing who you\ntruly\nare we're going way deeper than you\nthought you were going to go today we're\njust talking about self- Lov right but\nour personality the foundation of our\npersonality of having to change oursel\nis built upon this repression of who you\nactually truly are somehow I am bad and\nI need to look to my parents to see if I\nam right or to see if I get their\nvalidation now it's not all the parents\nfault because then we also have to go to\nschool and school is the exact same\nthing we have to be a certain way for\nthese teachers and we have to get a good\ngrade or else we a stupid kid and then\nwe we somehow get into this you know\ncomparing our grades to everyone else's\ngrades and the top in the class and the\nlowest in the class and all that and we\nstart developing a whole other set of\nparadigms around it of identities around\nit if I'm the smartest kid or I'm stupid\nor I'm not good enough you know I\nremember when I was a kid and uh I was\nin second grade from second to third\ngrade I switched class I switched um\nschools and when I went to third grade\nit was at a small school and it was so\nsmall that there were split classes\nwhich means that my teacher taught\nsecond grade and she taught third grade\nI was in third grade and I was the only\nkid in class in third grade that\ncouldn't read the second graders were\nable to read and I wasn't I remember\nthinking to myself I am so stupid I just\ndidn't pick up reading until later on in\nlife I wasn't good at it and so I I\nwasn't my brain just wasn't processing\nit for some reason but because of the\nfact that I was behind all these other\nkids I felt stupid right so that's\nanother example of that's no one else's\nfault that's not my parents fault that's\nnot a teacher fault any of that stuff\nbut it was me being around other\nchildren comparing myself and and all of\nthat and so as we get older we have\nother things so we have our parents we\nhave Society we have the rest of our\nfamily sometimes it's older brothers and\nolder sisters that can can help with\nthis Paradigm that we're creating right\nand so as we get older we then start\nseeking others approval so not just our\nparents approval but others approval do\nyou love me you know if I get good\ngrades and if I'm number one in the\nclass and if I beat everyone else Do You\nLove Me Do I Do I look sexy enough for\nyou did I get enough likes on Instagram\nor Tik Tok if I make a lot of money will\nyou accept me and so we we're always\nkind of getting in this this feeling of\nof seeking others approval versus\nseeking approval from ourselves and so\nwhat I have found is is we're trying to\ndo or BEC something a lot of times to\nfeel accepted like I remember in Middle\nSchool it was like every kid became a\nchameleon in in order to fit in with\neveryone else and want to be the same\nand to be accepted so we abandon our\ntrue selves in order to fit in with\nother kids and so what we're trying to\ndo is we're trying to become something\nelse so that we can feel accepted and\nthat means that we do have to abandon\nour true selves so the the issue is can\nwe validate ourselves based off of who\nwe are as a person and nothing else now\nthat you have an idea of how we've built\nourselves into this feeling of there is\nsomething wrong with me I don't accept\nmyself I don't love myself you can start\nto see I bet through me giving you these\nstories of these how you became a little\nbit of how you are and as you start to\ndive deeper into this more more stories\nmore memories are going to come up in\nyour head you're going to be like oh my\nGod I remember when this happened with\nmy father I remember when this happened\nwith my older sister I remember when\nthis happened in school and you'll start\nto understand yourself more and and\nreally what it comes down to like I said\nis is okay I've I can understand now\nsome of the reasons why I don't accept\nmyself and how I have built myself into\nthe person who doesn't accept myself and\nif I don't accept myself I don't love\nmyself it's there's there's things in\nthe way it's the barrier and so can\nwe every person myself included everyone\nlistening this can we get to the point\nwhere we can we can accept and we can\nvalidate ourselves based off of who we\nare as a person nothing else not our\nlooks not how much money we have not our\ncars not our jobs not our bodies not our\nsocial media followings all of that can\nwe get to acceptance without having to\ndo anything else you know there's this\nand I've said this before on the podcast\nthere's this meditation I used to do a\ncouple years ago it's with a a spiritual\nteacher his name is Muji um and he used\nto say in the meditation he would say\nyou have no pockets you have no\nStorehouse and what he means by that is\nyou came into this world naked by\nyourself you're going to leave this\nworld naked by yourself you're not going\nto be able to bring anything with you\nthere's there's nothing you can throw in\nyour pockets in your Storehouse you\ndon't have them uh on your your your\nactual physical body right what he's\nsaying though behind that is there is\nnothing that you can do there's nothing\nyou can say there's nothing that you can\nachieve there's no amount of money that\nyou can have there's no amount of\nproperties that you could buy there's no\namount of sexual partners that you could\nhave that could make you more or less\nthan what you currently are right\nnow if you can really get that to lock\ninto your head it'll make this process\nof self-acceptance so much easier is\nbecause there is nothing that I can do\nto make me better there's nothing I can\ndo to make me worse I am who I am and\nthis is who I am right now Society will\ntell us oh yeah well you're better when\nyou make more money you're better when\nyou have a successful job and all of\nthat but really what it comes down to is\nyou're not seeking anyone else's\napproval with self Lov you're not\nseeking other people's approval you're\nnot seeking society's approval you're\nseeking approval from who from\nyourself and so you have to learn to\ndisapprove uh you have to learn to let\nme try to phrase this correctly you have\nto learn to see your disapproval of\nyourself when it pops up and you have to\nsee to yourself okay yeah I'm not I'm\nnot accepting myself as I currently am\nright now you have to learn to accept\nyourself as you are by yourself and um\nit really comes into looking at all of\nthe parts of M who who you are and\nlearning to accept it now it's very easy\nto accept the good parts of you the the\nfun parts of you the beautiful parts of\nyou the exciting parts of you the one\nthat's outgoing the one that's loving\nthe one that's funny it's very easy to\naccept the quote unquote good quote\nunquote bad\neven though neither one of them are good\nor bad but we as humans tend to\ncategorize things so it's easy to love\nthe quote unquote good sides of us it's\nhard to love the bad sides of us and so\nwe usually look at the bad sides of us\nand naturally say I want to change this\nabout myself I want to change\nthis but can you learn to accept it can\nyou learn to accept that you're short or\nthat you fat or that you're skinny or\nthat you have no money or that you have\nacne or that you're negative sometimes\nor that you have negative thoughts or\nthat you have a short temper or that\nyou're selfish sometimes can you or that\nyour your judgment can you learn to\naccept first no judging now this is very\neasy to say and it's very hard to do but\nit takes this self-awareness of going\nyeah I need to get better at accepting\nmyself because what you'll realize is\nthe quote unquote I keep saying quote\nunquote because there is no bad and\nthere is no good within you but can you\nlook at the quote unquote bad sides of\nyou and learn to accept them because if\nyou resist them it makes them stronger\nif you accept them they slowly start to\ndissipate and you really don't have they\nthey don't have any more control over\nyou and you can look at yourself and say\nyeah I am I am kind of I am kind of\nshitty sometimes okay like I understand\nthat that probably was just a mechanism\nthat was built within me a protection\nmechanism when I was a child to be more\nselfish or to be a little bit judgmental\nor whatever it is that I am that I need\nto accept I can see that I was a\nprotection mechanism that I built up in\nchildhood unconsciously and I don't even\nknow where it came from and I don't need\nto know where it came from but can I\nlook and I can say I I can still love\nthat part of me you know and and learn\nto just appreciate like you don't go\ninto a forest and you you start judging\nthe trees oh that one's fat that one's\nshort that one's skinny no you just\nappreciate all of them as they are but\nwe judge ourselves so much don't we we\njudge others for better and For Worse\nand we get a lot of insecurities from\nthat and we live in a state of a lot of\npeople judging themselves and a lot of\npeople judging other people but mostly\nwhat we do is we judge ourselves more\nthan anybody else you have to allow\nyourself to be a human being you're not\nperfect right you're up in some\nways so am I we all are it's just the\nway that it goes we're flawed exactly as\nwe are so can we learn to accept\nourselves with all of our flaws with all\nof our upness uh and not have to\nachieve and not have to buy something\nand not have to accept oursel only when\nwe're wearing makeup we're only we a\ncertain weight and really what it comes\ndown to is is can I ReDiscover who I\ntruly am I'm I'm on this path of life\nand I have try to change myself for\nother people and turn myself into a\nchameleon in a lot of different ways can\nI ReDiscover who I truly am what I want\nto be what I love and ReDiscover your\ninner child in some sort of way like\nwhat do you what do you love do more of\nthat what did you love to do as a kid do\nmore of that you know like I I always\nthink about I've said this before in the\npodcast too but like I I realized\nprobably six seven years ago that like I\njust really love being outside in nature\nsome people don't I just really love it\nand I had a conversation with my mom and\nsister and they're like yeah I used to\nsleep outside on the porch we had a a\nscreen in porch in Florida and I used to\nsleep on this couch we had outside like\nused to sleep on the couch all the time\noutside I was like oh my God I\ncompletely forgot about that memory and\nso now I know like the house that I live\nin now we're surrounded by property\nbecause of the fact that I wanted to be\nin nature more because it made me feel\nhappier inside the inner child that I\nhave and so it's like can you start to\nthink about like what is it that I love\nwhat is it that was fun to me what is it\nI used to paint so much when I was a kid\nand then I remember that one kid told me\nthat I was my paintings were ugly and I\nstopped doing\nit my dad said that you got to stop\npainting you start playing sports cuz\nyou know pansies paint or something like\nthat real boys they go out and they play\nmanly Sports whatever it is that your\nyour parents could have said to you or\nSociety or children or bullies or\nwhatever it is that might have said to\nyou you have to learn to go like what's\nmy I'm going to go on this path of\nrediscovery myself and no matter what I\nfind on this rediscovery I need to\naccept myself because there is nothing\nthat you can do that will make you more\nof who you are there's nothing that you\nneed to prove there's no change that you\nneed to do within yourself you just have\nto learn to accept yourself more and if\nyou learn to accept yourself more the\nnatural thing that flows in through that\ndoor is love and so if you want the key\nto self-love it's self-acceptance how\ncan you learn to accept yourself more so\nthat's I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please do me a\nfavor share it on your Instagram stories\ntag me in at robd Jr r o d a ljr uh the\nonly way this podcast grows is from you\nguys actually sharing it and so I\ngreatly greatly appreciate it it um if\nyou share it if you would put the\nmessage out there so that we can try to\nhelp more people change their lives\nbecause that's ultimately all I really\nwant to do so if you do that I would\ngreatly appreciate it and with that I'm\ngoing to leave the same way I leave you\nevery single episode make it your\nmission to make someone else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
