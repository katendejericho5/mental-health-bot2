    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about anxiety and\nhow if you use anxiety correctly it can\nactually Propel you to Greatness let's\ndive in today I'm going to be teaching\nyou how you can actually use anxiety as\na way to prel you to Greatness now when\nyou look at anxiety anxiety is a\nemotional response to a perceived threat\nor challenge most of the time and so\nbeing anxious about something is being\nanxious about an imagined future this is\nreally important okay A lot of times\nwe're anxious because we think that\nthere's something in the future that we\nfear like oh my gosh if I build this\nbusiness then what happens if I fail and\nthat can be true but anxiety is an\nemotional response to a perceived threat\na perceived threat which means it's\nimagined it doesn't actually exist and\nso when you look at life life is\nextremely unknown and uncertain there\nis trillions of uncertainties that are\ngoing to come up over the course of our\nlife and humans don't really like that\nbecause uncertainty is seen as a threat\nto the human brain because the human\nbrain wants to plan and figure out every\nway to get around any type of threat\nbecause your brain is designed to to\nkeep you alive and so um there's\nactually a philosopher from the 1800s um\nnamed kirkyard and he actually says as\nthat anxiety is the dizziness of freedom\nand what he means is that there's so\nmany uncertainties so many unknowns that\nit can actually really kind of set us\noff and we want stability we want\nsecurity but there are so many unknowns\nthere's unknown and uncertainty as a\nwhole and there's an infinite amount of\nunknowns across your entire life and so\nif we're being real as\nhumans we really have very little\nknowledge of what the hell we're doing\nhere in life right so it's like the\npeople who who raised us and the people\nwho are running Society don't really\nhave any idea of what we're doing here\neither they're just kind of doing what\nthey feel like they're supposed to be\ndone and keeping economies running and\nbusinesses running and all of that stuff\nand uh when you really start to look at\nit and you come back to like the person\nas a whole um we all have a lot of\nunknowns and and we're trying to fit\ninto boxes that were created by other\npeople\nand anxiety is I'm going to take a\ndifferent flavor of anxiety today and\nstart to talk to you about it but your\nanxiety can be transformed when you\nstart to discover your\npassions really interesting thing\nbecause think about this for a second if\nI'm living a life that I don't want to\nbe living once again if if we go back to\nwhat I said at the very beginning the\nvery first thing I said is anxiety is\nthe emotional response to a perceive\nthreat or Challenge and we're anxious\nabout something that we're imagining in\nthe future a lot of people people I\nthink are anxious about the future that\nthey're going to be stepping into if\nthey continue on the exact same\npath so a lot of people are anxious and\nhave anxiety around the future because\nthey're going I don't even know if I\nlike my present moment I don't want to\nbe at this job in 10 years but I don't\nknow what to do if I don't have this job\nI don't know how I'm going to pay the\nbills if I don't have this job but I\ndon't want my boss's job my boss sucks\nhis it looks like what he's doing sucks\nI don't want to do that I don't want to\nstay in this industry I don't want to do\nthis and they're getting anxious I think\na lot of times because they're thinking\nabout the future and the fact that they\ndon't even want that future but they\ndon't know what else to do and so we can\nuse anxiety as a way to actually\ntransform our lives and help us discover\nour passions the anxiousness that we uh\ncan feel thinking into the future is US\nthinking about the future doing this\nthat we're doing until we die and not\ndiscovering our passions or our purpose\nI can tell you 100% before I started\nthis podcast and I was you know 26 27\nyears old I was making great money but I\nlooked at my manager and I was like I\ndon't want her job I don't want to be\ndoing this in 10 years and I\nremember starting to get really anxious\nabout it because I was like that's not\nwhat I want I was like what the do\nI want then I need to figure it out cuz\nI'm not doing this forever and so the\nthe anxiousness that we can feel is is\nour body's way of saying we need to\ndiscover our passions and our purpose\nnot letting ourselves settle to find\nwhat re and not find what really makes\nus alive and so when you start to think\nabout the anxious feeling is kind of\nyour body's way of saying hey this is\nnot the path for you this is not what\nyou want to be doing you need to do\nsomething else we don't want this future\nyou don't want this future we need to do\nsomething too many people are trying to\nfit into somebody else's life they're\ntrying to make themsel they're trying to\nfit the anxiousness is coming from\ntrying to be a a square peg and fit into\na round hole and you're like this isn't\nworking this isn't working but my mom\ntold me I was supposed to do this when I\nwas 17 years old I need to become a\ndoctor I need to become a lawyer I need\nto become an engineer I need to take\nthis I need to take over the family\nbusiness and so you're trying to fit\nyour your infinite being that is\ncompletely unique into somebody else's\nmold of what e either they are or what\nthey think you should be too many people\nare trying to live someone else's life\nanother thing that the kirar said was uh\nThe crucial truth of life is to find\ntruth which is true for me to find the\nidea for which I am willing to live and\ndie for so think about that for a second\nhe talks a lot about anxiety and he says\nthe crucial truth of life is to find a\ntruth which is true for me to find the\nidea for which I am willing to live and\ndie anxiety is a natural part of life\nbut it is our response to it that will\neither give us a full and fulfilling and\namazing life or an empty and regretful\none if we decide that we are just going\nto continue down the path of who we\ncurrently are and what we've currently\nbeen and trying to fit ourselves into a\nmold that doesn't feel right it will\njust lead to more anxiousness if we\ndecide to use that anxiousness to create\nchange in our lives then we can find our\npassions and try to live a fulfilling\nlife if we do nothing it will lead to\nmore anxiety and ultimately\nDespair and listen I get it we have the\nfreedom to do anything that we want in\nthis life but sometimes that freedom to\ndo anything that we want in life and in\nthe infinite amount of paths keeps us\nfrom doing anything at all so we must\nlearn to move forward just a little bit\nno matter how slow the worst thing we\ncould do is just stay in the same place\nmy uh my very first uh Mentor used to\nalways say you're either green and\ngrowing or brown and dying and so if we\nfeel like we're progressing like even\nTony Robin says it prog progress equals\nhappiness when we feel as a human like\nwe're progressing towards something\nwhether that's progressing towards the\nlife that we want the business we want\nthe relationships we want or that we as\na human are just progressing a little\nbit we feel better about ourselves we\nfeel better about life no matter how\nslow you just have to learn to move\nforward a little\nbit and your anxiety will start to quiet\nmuch more as you take a step forward and\nso the the important piece of this\nthough is that you can't look at any\nother person's life and say that's what\nI'm supposed to be doing you can't look\nat any other person what they've told\nyou that you're supposed to do and say\nthat's what I'm supposed to be doing you\nneed to find your own subjective truth\nand follow through with it without any\napproval from the outside\nworld cuz you know what feels right like\nyou know what feels right no one can\ntell you what you should do with your\nlife you know what feels right and the\nproblem is you've been trying to silence\nit and silence it and silence it and do\nwhat other people have been telling you\nto do or do what Society tells you to do\nor do what you think will make you money\nbut you've been silencing it for so long\nthat that's silencing the thing that\nfeels right is now turning into an\nanxious feeling so really what it comes\ndown to is if this is hitting home with\nyou a path of self-discovery like\nrediscovering yourself a lot of people\nalways ask me like I'm I'm very big on\nintuition I'm very big on feeling I'm\nvery big on following my gut and a lot\nof people are like how do I develop that\nstrength how do I develop my intuition\nhow do you don't need to develop\nintuition do you want to know the truth\nyou just need to shut up and sit quietly\nfor a while and you start to understand\nyourself more and for me this is what I\nI kind of started to realize is that I\nwas I was moving and doing things so\nmuch that like I didn't even give my\nintuition time to kind of speak up and\nso really what it comes down to is\npeople always like how do I develop my\nintuition I don't think it needs to be\ndeveloped I think it needs time it needs\nspace to speak up is what really it\ncomes down to you know what feels right\nonly you know what feels right and so\nwhen was the last time you checked in\nwith yourself in silence and not just\nlike one meditation session but like\nsaying to yourself like I want to know\nwhat I want to do with my life I want to\nknow what my passions are I want to know\nwhat feels right for me and do it over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain it's like you might get one little\npiece of the puzzle imagine that your\npassion is like a thousand piece puzzle\nand your your your intuition is going to\ngive you one\npiece for every single time that you\njust sit silently and be with yourself\nand you get one little piece it's not\nlike the entire puzzle is going to be\ndone immediately which is what everybody\nwants in this world I want to be done\nnow right like uh that that annoying\nlittle girl that's uh that's in um Wily\nWonka in the Chocolate Factory right\nyou're like I want it now right that's\nnot how the world works that's not how\nyour intuition works it's like imagine\nthat every time you just sit quietly\nwith yourself you're just given like\nanother puzzle piece and another puzzle\npiece and every time you journal and sit\ndown and say what do I want what do I\nwant to create in my life what would\nwhat are my passions what do I want what\nmakes me curious what seems fun to learn\nabout and we just write these down it's\nlike the the universe just gives us\nanother puzzle piece another puzzle\npiece you will start to discover what\nfeels right and it might be out of\nalignment with what everybody thinks\nthat you should\ndo and that's where really people start\nto struggle because they're like well I\nI don't I want I want love and\nacceptance for my mom and from everyone\nelse around me I'm not saying that you\nshould just disappear and not hang out\nwith them anymore but what I'm saying is\nonly you know what feels right and if\nsomeone doesn't accept you for what\nfeels right for you for your full\nalignment into your true purpose of what\nyou feel is your true purpose in life\nand they don't accept you are they\nreally there for you you know a lot of\ntimes our anxiety comes from trying to\nfit into someone else's box right it's\nyour body telling you this is not right\nfor you do something\nelse you're trying to conform in your\nbody saying no no no do something else\ndo something else and when was the once\nthe anxiety starts to get a little bit\nmore and a little bit more it's like\nit's screaming at you it's like your\nbody being like for the love of God\nchange something cuz you can't do this\nforever and that's why it's hard to take\naction because number one either that\nwhat you're doing you're you're getting\nanxiety because this thing is not right\nfor you or the unknown is so scary for\nyou that you're focusing on all the\nnegatives life will not\nbe it'll never get easier it'll never\nget less scary you just have to get\nstronger and have the tools to work\nthrough those things as they come up and\nmost of the world is unaware of this and\nso if somebody it's it's really hard to\nfind people who are aware of this type\nof stuff and so it's really a personal\nJourney no one can go on this journey\nwith you this is your journey most of\nthe world is unaware of it and most of\nthe world is numbing and they don't know\nwhy they don't know why they're numbing\nbut in reality a lot of people are\nnumbing because of the fact that they\nare trying to to take this this fully\nunique being that they are and fit into\na box that someone else has\nbuilt and so they numb and people take\npills and people take drugs and people\ndrink to numb their feelings you know\nthat their body is trying to say to them\nof of you need to change something\nthey're scrolling they're on Instagram\nall day long they're constantly on on\nyou know shopping you're trying to eat\nto calm yourself there's many ways to\ncome to to to calm yourself and feel\nlike you're calming yourself and really\nmore than anything else it's it's just\nyou trying to uh to numb yourself from\nthe feeling of I'm not doing what I want\nto in my life and so you might be eating\nyou might be drinking you might be\nworking too much that was my thing that\nI did for a long time I was a workaholic\nbecause I was just not doing what I\ntruly wanted to\ndo and so really what I would recommend\nfor everybody is if if if this is really\nstarting to like hit home with you give\nyourself more time time with yourself if\nyou want to listen to your intuition\nlisten to your feelings be quiet more\noften you can you can meditate if you\nwant to you can sit outside in silence\nyou can journal and ask yourself what do\nI want and you can start to ask yourself\nthese questions what is it that I want\nin my life and get better at journaling\num if you want to get better at\njournaling I have a a free free course\non it that'll give you journaling\nquestions and show you how to do it's\nmindset uh what is it mindset\njournal.com is what it is I think I\nthink that's what it is I'm pretty sure\nI wasn't planning on talking about it\njust popped up in my head mindset\njournal.com I think is where it is and\nso uh you just start writing down and\nyou start asking yourself questions and\nstart to discover yourself and really\nlike get curious if you if you feel\nanxiety pop up get curious about anxiety\nif you want to get better at anything\nyou have to learn about that thing you\nwant to get better with your anxiety and\nworking through it read books about it\nlearn about it learn about yourself\nlearn about how to work through it get\nreally curious about it get obsessed\nwith it if you can start to see this\nthing as you start to learn about\nanxiety and it's not this thing that\njust is this this uh this invisible\nforce that's keeping you down as you\nstart to learn more about it you start\nto figure out ways to work through it\nand you start to see it from other\nangles versus just this like instead of\nthis like invisible heavy Cloud that's\njust on top of your head all day long\nyou can start to see it from other\nangles start to pick it apart a little\nbit more and when you can start to pick\nit apart and start to see it from other\nangles it doesn't have as much control\nover you it has way less control over\nyou and so really what it comes down to\nis like what if the anxiety that you're\nfeeling is your body saying wake the\nhell up do something different this is\nnot what we want to do your mind your\nheart your soul your brain this is not\nwhat we want to do we want to do\nsomething different then you go well my\nGod what the hell do we want to do well\nthat's where you have to start going on\nthe path of self-discovery what are you\ncurious about what do you want to learn\nmore about what lights you on fire what\nmakes what feels really good what is\nyour eeky guy right have an episode on\neeky guy i k i g a i of like the four\nplaces where they intersect to find out\nyour purpose eeky stands Japanese for\nyour reason for being what is your\nreason for being and at this moment I\nunderstand most people listening right\nnow don't know that's fine but now you\ncan now that you know that you don't\nknow but you know that it's out there\nnow you can start to try to discover it\nthere are very few things in this world\nthat are more important than discovering\nyour reason your passions your purpose\nthe things that light you up the most\nand if you start to to follow those\nthings what you'll notice is your\nanxiety will become less and less and\nless and less and less and that is the\nway that your anxiety can help make a\nchange and actually help you lead\nyourself to Greatness so that's all I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please do me a massive\nfavor share it on your Instagram stories\ntag me in at
