    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be diving deep into how to\nspeak better to yourself and how to have\nmore selflove let's dive in let's just\ntalk about how to have a little bit more\nself-love cuz I hear it so often like I\nhear so many people I get so many\nmessages I I read and talk to a lot of\nyou guys on Instagram as you guys send\nme messages and there's just so many of\nyou if I'm being honest they're just\nkind of to yourself right like\njust just beat yourself up for things\nthat you do things that you don't do the\nway that you did something way that you\ndidn't do something for the things that\nyou're thinking for the things that\nyou're it's just like it's just like\nlife is hard enough you don't have to be\nsuch an to yourself like why is\nwhy is self- Lov so important because it\nreally helps you and starts to help you\nbuild confidence or if you don't have it\nif you are negative to yourself it hurts\nyou and it hurts your confidence and so\nthe way I always say is like I like to\nthink of confidence of like jingle\nblocks right when you start to to speak\npositively to yourself when you start to\ndo things that are in a uh in heading in\nthe right direction in alignment with\nthe life you're trying to create it's\nlike taking another little jingle block\nand you're just putting them out there\nand you're stacking these confidence\nblocks but as you start talking to\nyourself it's like pulling one of them\naway and so a lot of people like how do\nI have more confidence and almost always\nwhen I ask somebody who ask me that\nquestion how do I have more confidence\nusually their selft talk is is something\nthat's really that needs to be fixed\nit's it's not in a good place and so\nwhen you talk to yourself in a really\ngood way or in a bad way it in turn\naffects the actions that you do or do\nnot take it also affects the way that\nyou carry yourself in in every moment\nlike if you are when you see a confident\nperson walk in the room you can usually\ntell because of the way that they holds\nright I'm not talking about a cocky\nperson I'm talking about a confident\nperson you can just tell in the way that\nthey carry themselves but you can also\ntell\nwhen a unconfident person walks in the\nroom someone who's not confident in\nthemselves someone who who talks trash\nto themselves you can see in their body\nlanguage it affects the way that that\nyou interact with other people it\naffects the way that other people\nperceive you and so it's not something\nthat you're born with it has to do with\nthe actions that you take the things\nthat you do but also the way that you\ntalk to yourself and it will also if if\nyou're a single person right now it will\naffect if you do or do not find the sign\nific other that you really want to or\nthe significant other that you want to\nattract because you attract someone that\nis like you you attract someone that is\nequal to you on their growth scale most\nof the time you know this is a vast\ngeneralization but usually an extremely\nconfident person is not going to be\nattracted to someone who is not\nconfident right usually they want\nsomebody whose energy matches them in\nsome sort of way where they can walk\nthrough the world and be confident like\nmen out there I know you can relate in\norder for you to attract a badass\nConfident Woman you are going to have to\nbe on another level of confidence and\nbadass as well right so like attracts\nlike and so I want you guys to all\nunderstand that it all comes back though\nto self-love and so in today's episode\nI'm going to talk about self-love I'm\ngoing to talk about how to get better at\nself- Lov and self-acceptance and then\nalso how to speak to yourself better as\nwell um and I'm going to give you some\ntips on all it right so um I want you to\nto go on a journey with me I want you to\njust imagine for a moment a child right\nwe're just going to build a fake child\nin front of us and I want you to imagine\nthat that child is talked down to their\nentire lives their parents talk down to\nthem their teachers talk down to them uh\nthey talk down to themselves they're\ntold that they're stupid they're told\nthat they're worthless they're told that\nthey're unlovable they're told that\nthey'll never amount to anything day in\nday out most of the day right it's\nterrible but what's crazy is it\nhappens how wounded do you think that\nchild would\nbe like very wounded right and and if\nthey're so wounded how do you think that\nthat will affect them and that what they\nbelieve in themselves as they grow up\nthey're probably not going to believe\nthem themselves much they're probably\nnot going to have much confidence\nthey're probably not going to carry\nthemselves very well they probably won't\ntake risks because they don't think that\nthey can follow through and they\nprobably probably won't won't live the\nlife that they ultimately want you can\nsee it right you understand it well what\nthe is the difference between you\nand that\nchild think about that don't just think\nbecause you're older that something is\ndifferent oh I'm older so I can take I\ncan take a criticism better I can when\nmy someone tells me that I I look stupid\nor that I'm unlovable or that I'm uh\ntalk down to the they talk down to me\nand I talk down to myself just because\nyou're older don't think that\nsomething's different right there's\nthere's very little difference between\nyou and that\nchild the the the the little bit of\ndifference between you and that child is\nthat they can walk away from their\nabuser but you are your abuser if you\ntalk negatively to\nyourself the child can walk away from\ntheir abuser you cannot and so you've\ngot to start to think about that is a\nlot of people and I I've said this\nbefore and it really of hits with people\nI want I say like imagine when you were\na kid and there's that bully right like\nthat was just like the biggest\nto you like for me I remember\nspecifically the biggest bully\nto me in high school is a kid named\nAnthony right I won't say his last name\njust because you know I'm not going to\ndo that but Anthony was an right\nand I remember him and if I think like\nwho was the biggest bully to me when I\nwas a kid he's the first one that pops\nup into my head who's the first one that\npops up into your head maybe it was\nMiddle School maybe it was Elementary\nSchool maybe it was high school maybe it\nwas your you know your parents who was\nthe biggest bully to you when you were a\nchild the teacher who was it I want you\nto understand that you are way more of a\nbully to yourself than that person ever\nhas been that person isn't a bully\nthey're gone they haven't they they're\nnot constantly abusing you inside of\nyour head like a lot of people listen\nthis podcast are if you talk down to\nyourself if you talk negatively to\nyourself you are your biggest abuser you\nare your biggest bully most people\nlistening to this are a bigger bully\nthan anyone has ever been to them in\ntheir entire life and I want you to I\nwant you to think about that I don't\nwant you to guilt yourself and shame\nyourself because now you're having\nawareness of it but I want you to just\nbecome aware and just let it sink into\nyour bones of like wow yeah I have been\nreally mean to myself and I don't\ndeserve that I don't I deserve better I\ndeserve speaking to myself better so\ndon't\nguilt and shame yourself and beat\nyourself up and ab ab abuse yourself\neven more by saying oh you're an\nyou shouldn't talk to yourself that way\njust become aware and say I'm going to\nchange it you know I've I've given this\nexample many times before but um years\nago uh J Shetty put up a video and he\nhad these these ladies come in I've\ntalked about this many times in the\npodcast because I think it's the most\npotent example physically of how this\nhow this works and um he had these women\ncome in they're probably in their 30s\nand he gave them a pen and paper and\nsaid I want you to write down everything\nthat you say to yourself all of the\nnegative things that you say to yourself\ninside of your head they write them all\ndown and they write them down and then\nhe says okay come over with me to\nanother room and he has him go to\nanother room and in that other room\nthese girls that are you know 25 30\nyears old these ladies they're younger\nsisters are in the room and they're like\n11 12 13 years old and he says okay I\nwant you to read what you put on that\npiece of paper and I want you to talk to\nthem and tell them everything don't\ndon't say this is what I wrote I want\nyou to talk to them them the way that\nyou talk to yourself and everything you\nhave on that piece of paper and these\nwomen were just like appalled oh my God\nI would never do something like that\nright what's the difference to you doing\nit to\nyourself you would never talk to someone\nthat you love the way that you talk to\nyourself so why do you talk to yourself\nthat\nway you know like if a friend just\nimagine that if a friend calls you up\nand says hey I'm going through a really\ntough time right now\nand they they just explain what they're\ngoing through what would you how would\nyou be there for them how would you\nsupport them probably way different than\nthe way that you support yourself right\nwhen you're going through a hard time\nwhen you do something wrong oh I just\nyour friend calls you up hey I just went\non a date and it didn't do really well I\nthought he was really cute I thought he\nwas great but you know he told me he\ndidn't want to see me again you wouldn't\nbe like yeah well that's also because of\nthe fact like you know you're you're\ngetting a little bit fat you you've\ngained about 10 pounds in the past\ncouple years you're not taking care of\nyourself as well you're also starting to\nbreak out a little bit on your face also\nand like you wouldn't talk to them that\nway but if something happens like that\nto you you then go look in the mirror\nand you start talking trash to yourself\nright so how would you talk to somebody\nthe way that how would you talk to\nsomeone that you love that's going\nthrough something as if they come to you\nthat's the way that you should you\nshould support yourself but so few\npeople supports that way so like what do\nyou what do you say when you look in the\nmirror when you look in the mirror after\ngetting a shower you like oh my gosh you\nlook bad here you look fat here you\nwould you're you're stupid you're\nunlovable what you're you're getting a\nlittle getting a little foa over here\nyou know whatever it might be what do\nyou say to yourself or do you sit there\nand you look at yourself and you're like\nhey you're doing a good job I know we're\nstill improving we're not where we want\nto be yet but I believe in you we're\ngetting better you know you're still\neven if your your body's still changing\nit's like oh yeah yeah that you might\nstill be overweight but it's like you've\nalso lost a pound in the past two weeks\nI'm proud of you for losing a pound\nright how can you support yourself the\nsame way that you would support a friend\nthat called you and needed support CU\nyou need a lot of support we all need a\nlot of support all too often we get\ncaught up in comparison and we compare\nourselves to other people and this what\nsocial media really sucks at right we\ncompare ourselves naturally to other\npeople it's just a natural thing to do\nand comparison is the thief of\njoy you know you don't love your your\nbody because you're looking on Instagram\nyou tell yourself that you have you know\nfat ass because you're comparing\nyourself to a photoshopped model that\nyou saw on Instagram or damn even right\nnow ai like AI models are are taking off\non Instagram they're not even real\npeople and there's people that are\nfollowing AI models that don't know that\nthey're AI they're never never been a\nreal person and they're comparing\nthemselves they're human body to a\nartificial intelligence built person who\nhas the perfect body with the perfect\ndimensions and all of that of course\nyou're going to be comparing yourself\nand talking trash right but it's like\nmaybe you should get off of social media\nfor a little while you know you talk\ntrash to yourself because you\nprocrastinated you went online and now\nyou're comparing yourself to the one\nfriend that you have from high school\nthat just you know bought a massive\nhouse or you're comparing yourself to\nthe one friend in high school who's you\nknow now traveling all over the place\nand you're stuck at your desk job or\nyou're pissed off that you're driving\nyour you know 12-year-old Kia and you're\nthinking about how that that 20-year-old\nBitcoin millionaire just put up pictures\non his Instagram of the lambo that he\njust bought and you're comparing\nyourself constantly to these other\npeople if you find yourself comparing\nand it it's stealing your joy from Life\nmaybe you should delete Instagram for a\nlittle while try it out see how it works\nfor you you have to understand and you\nhave to get better at just accepting\nWhere You Are\nis where you are that's a fact like in\nthis moment nothing can change because\nyou are where you\nare but the only thing that can change\nis from what we do right now from this\nmoment forward and I do know that one\nabsolute fact is it is harder to get\nmotivated and go to the gym and build a\nbusiness and be a better person and\nlearn and to stop procrastinating and to\nwork harder it is harder to do all of\nthose things when you feel like and\nguess what when you talk trash to\nyourself it makes you feel like\ndoesn't make you feel good does it so if\nwe want to if we are comparing ourselves\nand then we're we're saying well I want\nto build a business just like you know\nmy friend from high school built a\nbusiness and then you start talking\ntrash to yourself it's going to make it\nreally hard to start building that\nbusiness and take the right action but\nhow do you feel when someone's telling\nyou how great you're doing we all love\nwords of affirmation how much better\ndo you feel when your friend comes over\nand they're like oh my God your body's\nlooking good you're looking great have\nyou lost a few pounds how proud they are\nof you that you're taking action how\nmuch they love you how does that make\nyou feel it oh like there's not a human\nin the world that's like I hate that\nright it makes you feel good imagine if\nyou had that every day imagine if you\nhad that one friend who's just positive\naffirmations in your ear all day long\nhow much easier it would be to take\naction right and it could be but it\ncould be you instead of of that person\nand so you've got to start to understand\nand and become very aware of the way\nthat you talk to yourself a lot of\npeople what I found have have become\ntheir patterns of talking to thems\nnegatively have become so normal that\nthey just don't even notice it\nanymore it's just become it's like when\nyou hear about the the story of the the\nold fish swimming by the two younger\nfish and he says Hey water's great today\nisn't it and the two younger fish look\nat each other and he like what's water\ncuz they're just young they don't know\nthat they're in they're just in it it's\nliterally who they are it's a part of\ntheir life they're just in water all the\ntime some people have such negativity\nsurrounding them and also surrounding\nthem inside of their own head that they\ndon't even notice it anymore but they\njust notice they don't feel good so\nyou're either your biggest fan or your\nbiggest\ncritic you know like you you have to\nstart thinking about this is like if I\nsaid to you here's a pen and paper I\nwant you to write down all of the bad\nthings that you say to yourself all of\nthe ways that you're hard on yourself\nall of the ways that you talk trash to\nyourself you have to understand that if\nthat's the majority of what's going on\nin your head you will get what you focus\non the most and if you focus on the\nyou will get more I promise you\nthat and so if you're looking at that\nlist and you're looking at that list and\nseeing all the bad things you say to\nyourself and then you're starting to see\nthat all of these things are still\naround all of these things are starting\nto get stronger they're going to keep\npopping up because that's what your\nbrain is focusing on all day long and so\nuh what I would recommend is taking that\nlist of all of the bad things that you\nsay to yourself you write it down and\njust force yourself to write all of it\ndown so you can physically see it on\npaper because it makes a difference when\nit goes from in your head to want a\nphysical piece of paper where you can\nsee it and you're like dang no this is\nnot good I don't want to do this anymore\ntake that piece of paper after you do it\nrip it out and burn it and then what I\nwant you to do is I want you to write\ndown all the ways that you want to speak\nto yourself you know all of the things\nthat you're proud of yourself for every\nI used to have my clients do this years\nago when I I would work with one-on-one\nclients and I would have them write down\nI called it I called it their their\nawesome list I said you need to come up\nwith 100 things that you like about\nyourself that you've accomplished that\nyou've done well I don't care if you got\nthird place in a spelling G spelling\nspelling be in fourth grade write it\ndown every accomplishment everything\nthat you like about yourself everything\nthat you do well and I want you start\nfocusing on those things cuz what you\nfocus on you will get more of and if\nyou're focusing on all of the\nyou'll get more and you'll have\nmore things to judge yourself on you be\nmore things to be mad about but if you\nstart focusing on your accomplishments\nand what you like about yourself you\nwill start finding more things that you\nlike about yourself and naturally you'll\nstart speaking to yourself a little bit\nbetter and so ultimately you have to\nrealize the way that you speak to\nyourself might be one of the most\nimportant things of either helping you\ncreate the life that you want or holding\nyou back from creating the life that you\nwant and if you can just become more\naware like those two little fish were of\nthey're swimming in water if you become\nmore aware of there's a there's a\nconversation that's happening in my head\nall day long you become aware of that\nand you start to shift it you will\nabsolutely shift the course of your life\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a massive favor uh share it
