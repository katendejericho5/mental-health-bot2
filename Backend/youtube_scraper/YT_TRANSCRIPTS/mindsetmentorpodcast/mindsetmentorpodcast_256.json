    "transcript": "if you don't like cussing this is not\nthe episode for you because I am going\nto probably say the word quite\na lot right I'm going to talk to you\nabout how to stop all the how\nto stop all of the BS that goes on in\nyour mind that is so ridiculously\nunnecessary and it's holding you back\nfrom creating the life that you want and\nI'm going to give you one tip that one\nof my mentors gave me a few years ago\nthat works so well it's so ridiculously\nsimple but it works so well when you're\ntrying to get yourself out of the moment\nout of overthinking out of um anxious\nthoughts anxious feelings all of that\none of the things though that I hear the\nmost from people on why they're not\ndoing what they need to do or taking the\nright action uh to build the life that\nthey want to one of the things that I\nhear the most from those people who say\nthat is uh because of something that's\ngoing on in their mind they\nare basically thinking about their fears\nthey're thinking about their negative\nself talk the thing about the negative\noutcomes that could happen and so it's\nreally interesting the longer that I\nwork in mindset the simpler that it\nbecomes and the more that I can start to\nsee these these patterns in people and\nwhenever somebody's dealing with\nsomething where they are not taking\naction they're self-sabotaging they\ndon't have the life that they\nwant very and I mean very very rarely is\nit reality that's the\nproblem like 99.99 99% of the time it's\nwhat that person is thinking there's a\nstory that's going on in their head and\nthat thing is the actual problem it's\nsomething that's going on in their mind\nand so basically here's what's happening\nright and I I I talked about this kind\nof in the the book my book level up I\nkind of talk about this where it's like\nwe're all creating we wake up in the\nmorning in reality is perfectly fine\nit's okay we have food Water Shelter\nclothing a few people that love us but\nwhat we do is we wake up the morning and\nwe create all of our fears and all of\nour limiting beliefs that are not\nactually there in reality they're in our\nmind and we act like they are in reality\nand so basically every single morning we\nwake up and we create the boogeyman\nwhich is our fears our limiting beliefs\nwe create the boogeyman he's not really\nthere and then instead of actually doing\nwhat we need to do to create the life\nthat we want we spend majority of our\nenergy fighting the Boogeyman and the\nboogeyman is not even actually there\nit's pretty crazy isn't it like we spend\nthe majority of our energy thinking\nabout our fears thinking about our\nliving beliefs overthinking all of that\nstuff versus actually just taking the\naction that we need to so we wake up in\nthe morning we create the boogeyman we\nfight the boogeyman all day long and\nthen we go to sleep and we wake up in\nthe morning and we create the Boogeyman\nand when we wake up in the morning and\nwe create him and we fight him all day\nlong and we use all of our energy\nthinking and worrying and fears and\nlimiting beliefs and I don't know if I\ncould do this I don't know if I'm smart\nenough all of those things versus is\njust going hey I'm in my head I need to\nget out of here I need to create the\nlife that I want how do I do so we're\nalways in our mind it's the overthinking\nit's the negative selft talk it's too\nmany fears in our heads it's afraid of\nwhat the future might hold it's being\nscared of not being accepted it's being\nscared of being judged other people's\nopinions not wanting to stand out blah\nblah blah blah blah blah blah it's all a\nbunch of it's not real it's not\nin reality it's not here but you're\nacting like it's here and you're acting\nlike it's in reality like 99.9% of\npeople are listening right now you are\nYour Own Worst Enemy you are your\nthoughts you need to be able to start to\nchange them and that's what we're going\nto talk about today as well and because\nthese thoughts are going on in their\nheads and might be going on in your head\nwe wake up and we think about those\nthoughts instead of actually doing the\nthing to create the future that we want\nI want you to understand where you\ncurrently are in your life right now is\nbecause of all of your actions in the\npast that's the first thing needs to be\naccepted before before we go any further\nright where you are right now is based\noff of all of the actions that you\ncurrently made in your past there is no\none else to blame so hopefully you're\nnot playing victim you're not playing\nthe blame game because if you are then\nthere's nothing we can do to help you\nbecause you're just going to blame\neverybody else and not take any\nresponsibility so as soon as you decide\nto take responsibility well now we can\nactually start to work through this and\nmake\nchanges if you like where you are it's\nbecause you took the right actions so if\nyou don't like where you are it's\nbecause you took the wrong actions if\nyou do like where you are it's because\nyou took the right actions it's pretty\nsimple life is very black and white\neither you get the life that you want to\nor you\ndon't your actions are going to decide\nwhich one you end up at if you don't\nlike where you are it's because you took\nthe wrong actions if you like where you\nare it's because you took the right\nactions right and everybody I understand\nhas different life circumstances some\npeople started off worse than other\npeople some people started off in the\nmiddle some people started off better\nthan other people right yeah that\nhappened right that's just the way that\nit is you can't do anything about it but\nit is your responsibility that whatever\nwhatever hand you were dealt in life it\nis your responsibility to do something\nwith it and if you think about all of\nyour worries and fears and limiting\nbeliefs and overthinking all of that\nstuff is in your head none of it's in\nreality but you think that it is because\nit feels like it is but it's not it's\nfalse it's in the mind it's not physical\nit's not in reality so let me give you a\ntip\nthe thing that I want you to do is when\nyou notice yourself bullshitting\nyourself when you're bsing and you\nnotice yourself overthinking you notice\nyourself negative selft talk we notice\nyourself being fearful uh worrying too\nmuch um self-limiting beliefs whatever\nit might be what I want you to do is\nstart talking to yourself out loud in\nthe moment as if you're talking to\nsomebody else this works so well you\nmight seem kind of crazy who gives a\ndamn what I want you to do is start\ntalking to yourself out loud let me\nexplain okay sometimes when I wake up in\nthe middle of the night to go to the\nbathroom and I I I'll have a thought\nsometimes I'll pop into my head about\nwork am I to-do this or whatever it is\nand once my brain clicks into that mode\nit's off like a racehorse like it's\nreally hard for me to turn my brain off\nonce I get into work when I get into du\nlist when I get into that all the stuff\nI need to do what's going on tomorrow\nwhat I forgot to do ideas and some times\nI've been I've sat in bed and I've been\nlaying for like two hours my brain has\njust been going and I'm like damn it\nlike I should be sleeping right now and\none of my mentors gave me this tip and\nthis is how I started creating this a\nfew years ago is to say out loud to\nyourself to your brain not right now\nwhen your brain goes off in a tangent\nthat you don't want it to say not right\nnow and it sounds stupid and I it's when\nhe first told it to me I was like it's\nstupid but guess what it works it's so\nstupidly simple\nsomehow it works right and sometimes the\nthoughts are gone and I can immediately\nfall asleep and sometimes I have to say\nit a couple times and I notice myself go\noff on a tangent again I have to say it\nagain and since I've learned this and\nI've explained it to so many other\npeople other people have come back to be\nlike oh my God this actually works I\ndon't know why it works but it works so\nyou could try this now this is the way\nthat you're going to do it right if you\nnotice that you are let's say for\ninstance you don't like your negative\nselft talk you notice yourself talking\n to yourself and you're just Your\nOwn Worst Enemy stop all the BS in the\nmoment and when you notice yourself\nlying to yourself and saying things that\nare rude and saying things whatever that\nyou don't want just say out loud that's\nnot true stop lying to me once again act\nlike there's somebody else that's here\nstop lying to me I don't accept the\nwords you're saying there's something\nreally interesting that happens in the\nbrain when you start talking out loud to\nyourself it's not the same as being\nbecause you're not in your brain anymore\nlike in your brain your brain can create\ninfinite possibilities right but now\nwhen you speak out loud in the moment\nyou're in the moment there's something\nto it it's it becomes different as if\nthere is another person so you find\nyourself negative selft talk and no I\ndon't accept the words that you're\nsaying that is not true don't talk about\nRob that way as if there is someone else\nright this is not disassociating or\nthere's no you know you don't have to\nworry about disassociating fully from\nyour body what you're trying to do is\nyou're actually trying to change your\npattern immediately in the moment\nbecause all too often we get stuck in a\npattern then we're off the races right\nif you own let's give a couple more\nexamples right if you own a business and\nyou're sitting there and you're thinking\nto yourself about all of the ways your\nbusiness might fail I've done this\nbefore and you start thinking about oh\nmy God and what if this happens and\nrevenues they come in and then I have to\nlet go of people but they have families\nand I don't want to let go of people and\nthat's a big responsibility and so many\npeople do this and they their business\nfails because the only thing they ever\nthink about is their business failing\nversus actually what they need to do to\nmake it succeed so it's like you might\nbe thinking about your business failing\nand maybe you had a bad week last week\nand you start thinking to yourself oh my\nGod I don't know if I can afford two or\nthree more bad weeks and so you're\nsitting inside of your retail shop now\nthe lights are on you're paying the\nbills everything is okay right now but\nyou're off in some really negative\nfuture stop the BS in the moment and\nwhat you say to yourself is something\nlike this is not true this is an\nimagined future my business is running\nrevenue is coming in we're doing good\nwe'll be okay and you actually start to\ntalk out loud to yourself as if there\nwas somebody else across the table from\nyou saying oh will your business is\ngoing to fail where you're not going to\nbe able to pay your bills you're not\ngoing to be good enough and whatever it\nmight be you act like you're talking to\nsomebody that's across the table from\nyou bring the facts to your brain to get\nyourself out of the\nimaginary your business is not failing\nright now your bills are paid bring it\nto the present moment where everything\nis fine right you're that's the crazy\npart about our brain is that you're\nyou're sitting in your retail shop the\nlights are on the bills are paid you\nhave a little bit of cash in the b in\nthe company bank account the business is\nnot failing but for some reason you're\nin your freaking head think about all\nthe ways the business could fail so you\nget yourself out of it in the moment\nstop the this is not true this\nis an imagined future I do not accept\nyou talking about this\neverything is good the lights are on the\nbills are paid everything will be good\nI'm a good business owner I'll figure it\nout and so you actually start to talk to\nyourself out loud to immediately change\nyour pattern if you're starting to get\nanxious about\nsomething first off anxiety comes from\nImagining the future no one has anxiety\nbecause they're imagining amazing future\nyou realize that right nobody's like oh\nmy God I have so much anxiety cuz my my\nfuture seems so positive right they have\nanxiety because they're imagining a\nfuture that is scary it is a defense\nmechanism it makes sense I've done you\ncan go back about a month or two ago and\nI did an episode on anxiety anxiety is a\npositive thing because they kept our\nspecies alive but when it takes over\nyour entire life it's not a positive\nthing right so when you have anxiety\nyou're worrying about the future you're\nnot thinking about all the amazing\nthings that's happen in the future so\nyou stop the in the moment that\nfuture is not true this and you say to\nyourself out loud that is not true right\nnow I am safe right now I am 100% safe\nright now I am grateful for this thing\nand this thing and this thing stop all\nthe BS in the moment you're getting\nyou're imagining a future that does not\nactually align with reality how often do\npeople get anxiety when they're sitting\non their their couch in their living\nroom when everything is fine like I mean\nlike the exact second they're sitting in\nin is fine not oh I have to pay bills\nnext week the exact second that they're\nsitting in is\nfine but people can cause and I've done\nthis many times in my life so I get it\nthey can cause so much anxiety when in\nthe present moment everything is okay it\nmight not be amazing it not might be\nwhat they want but it is okay and they\nare safe so you've got to learn to stop\nit while it's happening you've got to\nlearn to bring yourself the present\nmoment cuz you're not usually present\ncuz everything is fine in the present\nmoment you might say oh but I'm worrying\nabout paying the bills next week yeah\nwhen right now or next week next week\nokay well you're not in the present\nmoment and guess what I bet that if\nyou're in a better mental state you can\nyou can probably come up with better\nsolutions to make sure that you can pay\nyour bills right yeah you can isn't that\nfunny when you're in a shitty mental\nstate it's really hard to start getting\ncreative of how you can pay your bills\nso in the present moment the bills are\nnot due next week the bills are due so\nyou know when your emotions are high\nyour logic is low if you're really\nstressed and you're really anxious\nyou're not going to come up with really\ncreative ideas of how you can pay your\nbills or what opportunities might be out\nthere maybe you can oh yeah I could\ndrive for Uber for a week and I could\nprobably get the extra 200 bucks that I\nneed right you're not in the present\nmoment that's next week in this present\nmoment\nI've done it before I'm sitting there\nI'm just I'm just I'm off in a distant\nland in my brain of just like going\neverywhere and then I'm like hold on\nhold on hold on hold on and I'm talking\nto myself I like Hold on shut shut the\n up shut the up Rob Rob just\nshut\nup everything is fine I say this all\nloud to myself you're fine you're\nsitting on your\ncouch and you've got air conditioning\nand you've got thing like everything is\ngreat your your belly is full\nyou've got people that love you in your\nlife shut up cuz you're not in the\npresent moment and it's like sometimes\nit's like a it's like a a rude awakening\nit's like you know what it reminds me of\nthe visual for those of you guys that\ncan't see me and you're you know you're\nnot watching on YouTube I shook my hands\nlike I was sh holding on to somebody and\nshaking him it's like the moment in\nBilly Madison where he takes that little\nthe little chunky kid and he takes him\nby his face and he's like don't ever say\nthat he like starts to shake him and his\nbig old cheeks are moving all over the\nplace that's kind of what we're doing to\noursel uh if you don't know what I'm\ntalking about watch Billy Madison you\nknow exactly what I'm talking about he's\nlike don't ever say that and he's\nholding him and his little his little\nface is shaking his cheeks are going all\nover the place uh that's kind of what\nyou're trying to do you're trying to\nshake yourself awake and be like get\nyourself back here and worrying ain't\ngoing to pay your bills sorry guys it's\nI I have never worried myself into\nmaking money I've never worried myself\ninto paying an electric bill being in\nthis moment being creative being in a\ngood space mentally physically\nemotionally will help me figure out how\nto take action to be able to pay the\nbills and so it's really important for\nyou to start talking out loud yourself\nto get yourself out of your head because\nyour head is always either in the future\nor it's in the past very rarely is it\nright here in this moment but when you\nstart talking out loud speaking out loud\nis in this moment so you talk to\nyourself not right now this is not true\nstop lying to yourself This is imagined\nyou are safe right now you are paying\nthe bills you will figure it out you are\nsmart I know you can do this whatever it\nis that you need to say to yourself to\nget yourself out of your head just\nremember the old phrase when you're in\nyour head you're dead right you're off\nin a distant land you're not helping\nyourself but when you're here you're in\nthis present moment you can figure out\nhow to get done whatever it is you need\nto get done and you can get yourself out\nof those anxious States those stressful\nstates that just take up so much of\nyourself cuz ultimately what we're doing\nis we're waking up we're creating the\nboogeyman we're fighting the boogeyman\nall day long\nthat's a lot of energy versus just\nwaking up saying what do I need to do\ntoday to get one step further in the\nlife that I want to create and then\nactually start taking those actions so\nstop bsing yourself that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode
