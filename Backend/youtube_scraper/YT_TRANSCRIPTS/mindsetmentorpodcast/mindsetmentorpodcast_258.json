    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about a mindset\nshift that could completely change your\nperspective on life let's dive in it\ncould make your life way more positive\nand it's it's wild I'm glad that I I I'm\nglad that I chose mindset and I got so\nobsessed with it when I was younger is\nbecause the older that I get and the\nmore that time goes on the more that I\nrealized that it is the most important\nthing that we could focus on our per our\nour mindset the way that we look at\nourselves the way that we look at our\nlives the way that we look at other\npeople around us influences every single\naspect of our life and really what we're\ndoing when we talk about mindsets we're\ntalking about\nperspectives looking at something\ndifferent than maybe the way we've\nlooked at it our entire life and if we\ncan look at something a little bit\ndifferently uh you know it's like it's\nlike Wayne Dyer's phrase when you change\nthe way you look at things the things\nyou look at change and it's it's such a\na a simple phrasee but it's really Pro\nprofound if you think about it when you\nchange the way you look at things the\nthings that you're looking at change and\nso you really start to understand that\nperspective of your life perspective of\nyour challenges perspective of yourself\nperspective of the people around you and\nwhat perspective you're looking at what\nlens you're looking at the world through\nmight be the most important thing that\nyou get pay attention to and so today\nI'm going to talk about um the idea of\nwhat if and I want you to come on a\njourney with me and just just try this\nout for a day and just see if it changes\nyour perspective on life okay we're\ngoing to talk about how the world is\nconspiring to make your life amazing the\nworld is conspiring to make your life\nbetter every single day now it might not\nbe giving you all of the best things but\nit might be giving you challenges so\nthat you can grow so that your life can\nbecome better because of your growth you\nknow we've all heard the phrase paranoia\nbefore right well and and that's like\nthe idea of like the world is out to get\nme everybody's out to get me and\neveryone is out to get that person who's\nparanoid well there's also a phrase that\nis the exact opposite of paranoia and\nit's actually called pronoia so instead\nof looking at the lens of the world\nbeing out against you you're looking\nthrough the lens of the world being for\nyou as everything that will ever happen\nto you is for the greater good of you\nand for the greater good of the world\nand so pronoia\nwas actually coined by a sociologist\nnamed Fred goldner uh in the 1980s and\nit's derived from from the Greek words\nPro which means in favor of and Noya\nwhich translate rly roughly basically to\nthe mind so PR mind everything is is\nworking towards you in your betterment\nand so I understand that it can sound\nreally naive and overly idealistic to be\nlike oh my God everything is perfect\nit's it's and it's let me take a step\nback it's not even everything's perfect\nit's everything is is perfectly out\nthere to make the world better for me\nand make my life better it seems naive\nand it can seem naive but then when you\nstart to think about it um it's all\nabout really holding a mindset of making\nsure that you are proactively positive\nlike you are proactively positive when I\nsay proactively positive it doesn't mean\nignore the negative it means look at the\nnegative through a different perspective\nand see if you can turn that negative\ninto something positive it's about\nunderstanding that no matter what\nthere's always going to be positive\nthere's always going to be negative in\nlife but maybe the things that we're\nviewing as negative are actually chances\nfor us to grow and improve maybe there\nis a silver lining to every dark cloud\nit's a way of looking at the world and\nsaying okay yeah I've got this obstacle\nthat's in front of\nme and it does suck and it's not what I\nwant right now but it's a chance for me\nto be able to grow it's like the the\nbook The obstacle is the way instead of\ngoing around the obstacle you go through\nthe obstacle the obstacle is there for\nyou and it's really looking at the world\nand looking at everything and trying to\nfind the benefit for you in every single\nsituation that happens to be good also\nevery single situation that happens to\nbe bad and you know when you when you\nreally take a a look at these things it\nreally if you if you really search and\nyou try to find the positive and the\nbenefit and everything you can find it\nand a lot of times some of the best\nthings that have happened to you years\nago were the worst thing that ever\nhappened to you to you right so like I\nalways tell people like and I've said\nthis before in the podcast the best day\nof my life and the worst day of my life\nwere the same day and that was the day\nthat my dad died and uh it was the worst\nday in my life because he was the first\nperson that I ever knew that passed away\nbut it was the best day of my life and\nobviously is worse because you know\nthere's a lot of other things like my\ndad died right there's a lot that goes\nwith that it makes sense why it was the\nthe worst day of my life but on the best\nday of my life it wasn't the best\nbecause I wanted him to die that's not\nthe reason why was because the entire\ncourse of my life changed my perspective\nof life completely changed when I was\nlike oh my God this is going to end like\nmine is going to end one day too and I\nneed to do everything I can to get the\nbest out of it and I remember about 3\nweeks after my father had passed away um\nwe were driving the car and my mom had\nasked I was I had my Learners permit so\nI was driving the car my mom was next to\nme we're at stoplight we're at a\nstoplight in Sarasota I still remember\nexactly where it was it was at Proctor\n41 for anybody who lives in Sarasota and\nI was at Proctor 41 I was at the\nstoplight my mom said hey so now that\nit's been a few weeks like what do you\nthink about your father's passing away\nand I was 15 years old and I remember\nsaying to her I think that if Dad were\nto know how much good were to come from\nthis he would be okay with passing away\nand I don't know where it came from I\nit's like I wasn't even that kid it was\njust some some some bit of wisdom I\nguess came through that 15-year-old kid\nand I would not do what I do now had my\ndad not passed away now we can look at\nthose things and be like oh my dad was\nan alcoholic he passed away and I can\nlook at that and I could say I could\nfind all the negative in it of course I\ncould or I could say you know what I'm\ngoing to take this thing that sucks that\nI don't want it to be what it is and I'm\ngoing to make this one of the best\nthings that's ever happened to me and so\nI think it's about looking at life and\nyou could probably do this as well you\ncould probably look back to something\nthat was a really freaking hard time in\nyour life 7 8 10 15 years ago and you\ncan look at it and be like going through\nit was one of the worst things that I've\never gone through and I would never want\nto go through it again but I would never\ngo back and change it because you\nchanged and you grew and you learned by\ngrowing going through those things so if\nthat's the case it's easy to see that\nthe best things in life are are for us\nbut if that's also the case we could\nalso see that the worst things in life\nare also for us right and so going\nthrough those challenges is never easy\nbut are you grateful for them now of\ncourse you are you're so grateful for\nthem now and so all of your life\nexperience is whether they're good or\nwhether they're bad it's not always easy\nto go through things like life is tough\nand life is it's it's amazing sometimes\nand it's hard as hell other times and\nit's a struggle other times right but\nit's easier way easier if you know that\nsomething great will come from it you\nknow about almost two years ago now um\nand I've I've shared this before on the\npodcast but it's another idea just into\nmy mind in the way I try to look through\nit look at things and I try my best to\nlook at things this way and um do I am I\nperfect at it no do I am I better than I\never have been yes do I still struggle\nyes so it's uh I'm human but I remember\nuh about two years ago now our our dog\nToby passed away he was 13 and a half\nyears old and then um our our vet knew\nToby very well and um we had to take\nbear our other dog in he was a puppy at\nthe time to go and get uh fixed and the\nthe doctor had to come in after he knew\nthat Toby had passed away 4 days earlier\nand he had to have the conversation with\nme of like hey I've got to put bear\nunder you know that there's risks\nassociated with this and I was like yeah\nI get it and it was like n hours until\nwe heard from the\ndoctor and I was just having such a\nrough week with Toby passing away and I\nthought to myself as I'm waiting to hear\nfrom the doctor I don't want anything to\nhappen to Bear but I trust so much in\nGod or the universe or life or whatever\nit is that's out there that if something\nwere to happen to Bear it is something\nthat I'm supposed to learn I'm supposed\nto grow\nfrom but I just really don't want to\nlearn a freaking lesson this week right\nI've already learned lessons this week\nfrom from everything with Toby I don't\nwant to learn another lesson right so\nthat was like the the thing that was\ngoing through my head of like just\nhaving faith just having trust of just\nlike whatever happens is supposed to\nhappen and I can be okay with that and\nit it it brings so much besides being a\npositive mindset and helping with that\nand finding the best in things it also\njust allows you just to trust a little\nbit more and like let go of so much\ncontrol and wanting to force things and\ncontrol things and always and we because\nwe can't control these things like we're\nnot in control of that whatever happened\nwith be wasn't in control of you know\nlike could I have said no don't you know\ndon't fix them of course I could say\nthat but once it happens it happens and\nso it's really just\nlike the letting go sometimes which I\nhave found over the past few years has\nreally uh brought a lot of peace to my\nlife is not trying to control everything\nand just trying to let go when you look\nat the people in your life too there are\npeople in your life that you love and\nthey're amazing and they teach you\nlessons many lessons in life of how to\nbe more loving how to be more open some\ndifficult things as well but you know\nthey they teach you they're there for\nyou to learn and grow and improve and\nand and there's also other people in\nyour life that are very freaking\ndifficult right um and those people who\nchallenge you and who trigger you um are\nactually a gift for you as well because\nif I am triggered by somebody it is\nshowing me where I'm not\nfree I am still mentally hung up in that\nplace because whatever triggers me if\nsomebody says something and it triggers\nme that person could say the exact same\nthing to somebody else and it would not\ntrigger that person which shows that\nit's not the actual thing that's being\nsaid it's me right and so when we're\ntriggered I've said this before instead\nof wanting to punch somebody who\ntriggers you you should give them a high\nfive because because they're actually\nhelping you understand where you are not\nfree you can hate them if you want\nthat's completely your prerogative if\nthat's what you want to go and you want\nto hate them or you could thank them and\nbe like this is this is you are showing\nme where I'm not free this is the\nuniverse God whatever it is coming to me\nthrough this person that's really\npissing me off so that I can see where\nI'm not free right so it's the universe\ncoming to you through them to help you\nsee where you're not free and it is an\nopportunity for growth oh my gosh thank\nyou for pissing me off so much cuz it's\nshowing me where I still need to improve\nand there's a lot of those places right\nand you know like and I get it someone\nsomeone in my family has paranoia\ndisorder and um he's had it since he was\nlittle and he's always thought that the\nworld was out to get him to the point\nwhere even one of my aunts has told me\nwhen she was a little girl um she went\ntrick-or-treating with him and uh you\nknow he was in his I think he's like 11\nor 12 years old and um he had her he had\nmapped out the entire\nneighborhood on a piece of paper and\nsaid hey write down what you get what\npiece of cand do you get from every\nsingle house just in case someone tries\nto poison us and so he's always kind of\nhad this paranoia disorder and um and\nthat's a disorder and it's it's\nsomething that he has to De with every\nsingle day and obviously I'm not talking\nabout us being that but what I'm saying\nis what if we could try to change our\nthought process to to be a little bit\nmore positive a little bit more like we\ncan we can really get addicted to a\nthought process like we can get addicted\nto a thought process you know someone\nmight not have paranoia disorder but you\nknow somebody can get addicted to the\nthought of the world is out to get me\nnow how do they get addicted to that\nthought well when I think something\nspecifically my body is going to create\nvery specific chemicals right so in this\ncase if it's something that is very\nstressful a very stressful thought my\nbody is going to release adrenaline and\ncortisol adrenaline and cortisol\nadrenaline cortisol and we can become\naddicted to the thought process because\nwe become addicted to the chemicals that\nit creates and so really what it comes\ndown to is I could become addicted to\nthose chemicals of adrenaline and\ncortisol and stress and and there was a\npoint in my life about six years ago\nwhere I was like man I think I might be\naddicted to stress you know I I I\nstarted unraveling all these places in\nmy life where I made things more\nstressful\nI drank way too much caffeine because it\nwould get me all stressed and amped up\nin order to do things right and so it's\nlike I we can get addicted to those and\nI realize like man I might be addicted\nto stress and I started unraveling that\nand working through it and trying to to\nremove myself from it so if we can get\naddicted to the feelings and the the\nchemicals running through our body of\nadrenaline and cortisol and when we\ndon't have it the next day we want it\nagain we can also start to shift and\nit's not like an overnight thing but\nit's something to be very aware of and\nsay okay yeah if I if I am addicted to\nstress maybe I should have less coffee\nmaybe I should you know try to set up my\nlife to be more peaceful maybe I should\nstop hanging out with people who are\njust like obviously some people trigger\nyou and you learn from it some people\nare just toxic maybe I should stop being\naround toxic people right but we could\nalso become addicted to other chemicals\nas well we can become addicted to uh\nserotonin which is a feel-good chemical\nand feels amazing we can become addicted\nto oxytocin and actually want those to\nfeel and that's the feeling of love and\nthe cuddle chemical that call it right\nso we can start to feel what feels\nnormal inside of our body and for a lot\nof a stress and uh anxiety and\nadrenaline and cortisol feels normal to\nus and we might not want anymore but it\nfeels normal and then we can go you know\nwhat what would feel better though is if\nI could start to work on myself and get\nthe normal feeling Within Myself to be\noxytocin to be serotonin to be\ndopamine the Feelgood chemicals that I\nwant I don't know about you guys but I\nwould love to feel good more every\nsingle day and so then you start to ask\nyourself like how do you do how do you\ndo that and so for me one of the things\nI realized that was really making me\nstressed was I always was thinking about\nthe next thing I would wake up and\nbasically from like the moment that I\nwake up I would I would just think about\nall of the that I had to do and all\nthe stuff I wanted to be done and I\nwould immediately go into it and I would\ntry to meditate and when I would\nmeditate I would just think about all of\nthe stuff that I had to do and\neverything that I needed to do and all\nof that so I was like always on the go\nalways trying trying to do something and\nI was trying to get moving so then I was\nlike what is the what's the difference\nof that of like the difference of not\nfeeling good where I am because I had to\nbe somewhere else mentally physically\nall of that and I was like I just need\nto be grateful for what I have and so\nI've shared this on the podcast before\nbut one of the things that I've been\ndoing a lot recently is I'll do my\nmorning routine and it's not crazy\nthere's not 74 things that I do I wake\nup I go to the bathroom I drink water I\ndo breath work I meditate and usually\nthat's about it and then some days I'll\nread some days I'll Journal a lot of\ndays what I do is I just go outside with\nmy coffee and I just sit in silence and\nI just sit and just think about all of\nthe things that I have to be grateful\nfor and I just try to bring up and I\nstart thinking about challenges I've had\nin my life and I could be grateful for\nthem and the house that I live in and\nyou know my wife and and my family and\nthe health that I have and people around\nme have and you know the weather\nsometimes and it's it's kind of crazy\nI'm going to say this but it's kind of\nnuts but there's some moments some days\nwhere I'll just sit outside and I'll\nstart tearing up while drinking my\ncoffee because I'm so grateful\nfor everything that I have now when I\nfeel that good FYI those are the\nchemicals of Serotonin those are the\nchemicals of oxytocin those feel really\ngood and when you feel them guess what\nyou want more of those so then you start\nsaying what did I do to make myself feel\nthat way and how can I start doing it\nmore and so what I think it comes down\nto is is how can you start to cultivate\ngratitude in your life and you know\nhaving the steps starting taking the\nfirst steps towards pronoia is just the\nthe the feeling of like man everything\nhas worked out for my benefit and if I\nreally zoom out and look at my life I\ncan be like holy this thing is kind\nof perfect how everything has fallen in\nplace to get me to where I am and you\nmight not be where you want to be yet\nand that's fine but you can still be\ngrateful for where you are you can be\ngrateful for the journey you could be\ngrateful that you know 50,000 people\ndidn't wake up yesterday and you woke up\ntoday that's something to be that's the\nbiggest thing to be grateful for if you\ncan't find anything that's something\nhuge to be grateful for so can you find\nthree or five things that just make you\nfeel grateful inside of your body inside\nof your mind and can you start to shift\nyour perspective that when you have a\nchallenge come up in your life\nacknowledge that this might actually be\nan opportunity for you to grow and get\nbetter this might be the universe coming\nto you to help you get stronger so that\nyou can be better later on in life\nrather than see it as something that's a\nsetback you know and so you can start to\nsee with pronoia just the the world as a\nfriend and not really as an enemy you\nknow each challenge that we have gives\nus a chance where we can learn we can\ngrow we can evolve we can get better and\nso if we can start to see our obstacles\nthrough that lens it can really\ntransform um our response to whatever\nchallenges or adversities or perceived\nadversities\nthat come up to us and so really what it\nis and what I want to challenge you to\nis why don't you just try for today or\nfor this week just thinking to yourself\nwhat if everything is perfect it's all\nworking out for my good and maybe\ninstead of being paranoid that things\nare going wrong what if I just be\npronoia and just think man every single\nthing from the best thing that's ever\nhappened to me to the worst thing that's\never happened to me is given to me for\nmy greater good so that I can grow\nevolve and become the best version of\nmyself if you just shift your\nperspective and that way your life will\nchange so that's all I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nif you love this podcast please do me a\nmassive favor just share this somewhere\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Jr r
