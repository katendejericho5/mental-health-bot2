    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you the stepbystep process to\nabsolutely changing every aspect of your\nlife in the next 6 months let's dive in\ntoday I'm going to be teaching you how\nto completely change your life in the\nnext six months and I'm going to give\nyou just a couple steps I'm going to\ngive you three steps of exactly how to\ndo it and the most important step will\nprobably be something that you may have\nnever thought of before and so this is\nfor anyone who uh who doesn't have a job\nthis is for someone who does have a job\nbut you don't enjoy it this is for\nsomeone who who does have a job and it's\nokay but you just want something\ndifferent I'm going to dive in and talk\nto you about how to massively overhaul\nyour life in six months cool let's dive\ninto it okay number one you have heard\nme say this if you've been listening for\na long time is you have to get very\nclear on exactly what it is that you\nwant in this life life most people have\nno freaking clue what they want they\nhave a little bit of an idea they have a\nlittle bit of a vision little bit but\nit's like it's like looking at something\nthrough like a one of those uh it's the\nthing that I'm thinking of immediately\nis is uh putting frosting that frosting\nuh tape over a glass window right and\nlike you could see Shadows walk by but\nyou don't know who it is that's walking\nby that's it's kind of like people when\nthey're looking at their vision and\nlooking at the life of what it is they\nwant to create most people have a very\nvague Shadow idea of what it is that\nthey want to create but if I said say it\nto me in detail they don't really know\nand so what you have to do is you have\nto get very clear on exactly what it is\nand when you think you know what it is\nGo deeper and go deeper and say tell me\nmore tell me more and the reason why is\nbecause the clearer that you are the\nbetter that you can visualize it and\nyou're going to visualize it every every\nsingle day you have ultimately\nbrainwashed yourself into believing that\nthe life that you don't want or the life\nthat you want is not possible right now\nand what you're going to do is you're\ngoing to brainwash and brainwash and\nbrainwash yourself into believing it's\npossible visualization is great to be\nable to see what you want to believe it\nto manifest all of that stuff but\nultimately what you're doing is you're\ntrying to trick yourself into believing\nthat this is actually possible\nbecause there's a point of you there's a\npart of you that doesn't believe that\nit's possible for you to create the life\nthat you want and so when you visualize\nit every single day every single day\nevery single day your brain starts to be\nlike man this is possible because I keep\nseeing it every single day and then you\nbecome more excited to go for it and\nhere's what I want you to do in in in\ngetting very clear of what exactly what\nit is that you want I want you to learn\none really high income skill maybe it's\na skill skill that you already know uh\nand you've been doing it for 10 years\nand you need to just really Master this\nskill maybe it's a skill that you know\njust a little bit and you're like you\nknow what if I could get better at this\nthing I could charge really high prices\nto do whatever it is or maybe it's\nsomething that you don't have an idea of\nthis yet and you have to go out there\nand actually start to search for it and\nyou want to develop one high income\nskill it could be running Facebook ads\nso that you can run Facebook ads for\nother people's Instagram and Facebook it\ncould be writing\narticles it could be making YouTube\nvideos it could be coaching people and\nbecoming a consultant it could be\nShopify stores it could be Etsy stores\nit could be Facebook ad Revenue it could\nbe sponsorships on Instagram or Facebook\nor YouTube it could be uh how to uh run\na clothing brand online it could be\nselling courses it could be affiliate\nmarketing it could be podcasting it\ncould be writing emails for other people\nwho have large lists it could be selling\nsupplements it could be selling on\nAmazon it could be freelancing on upwork\nit could be social media management it\ncould be YouTube it could be writing\nKindle books it could be Consulting it\ncould be freelance writing there's so\nmany there's a million ways to make a\nmillion dollars you just have to decide\nwhich one you want to dedicate your time\nto and so you just decide you know what\nI'm going to I'm going to literally just\nflip my life on its head in the next 6\nmonths and I'm going to learn one high\nincome skill and I'm going to become\nobsessed with it I'm going to buy every\nbook that I can from him I'm G watch\nevery YouTube video that I can from him\nI'm GNA uh read every book that I\npossibly can and you take six months to\nstart learning and mastering one\nskill and you start figuring out how to\nmake money doing it because if you can\nMaster One High income skill people will\npay you for your services and you are\npaid in the marketplace based off of\nyour knowledge and what you know and\nwhat you can do and changes that you can\nmake in the world or other people's\nbusinesses or lives whatever it might be\nand then what you're going to do is\nyou're going to start a business with\nthat skill okay so that's number one\nnumber two is you're going to make a\nplan and you're going to make a business\nplan and you're going to get very clear\non what it is that you need to do to\ngrow that business to whatever it is\nthat you wanted to right get really\nclear on what it is that you need to do\nto create the life that you want the\nbusiness that you want the money that\nyou want the happiness that you want the\npeace that you want deep down in your\nsoul the love that you want between you\nand your family you're going to start to\nactually make a plan of how to not only\nlike keep all of the plates spinning in\nyour life but how to make sure that\nevery single one of them is running at a\nlevel 10 no more more like running at\nlevel six or level seven anymore or a\nfour but like how what does it look like\nfor everything in your life to be a home\nrun and you might be sitting there and\nthinking like well I don't know if\nthat's possible it is but who do you\nneed to become in order to make that\npossible some people say like I can't G\nbe be a great father and I can't be a\ngreat business owner at the same time\nand that none of those things are true\nthat's just a mindset a fake mindset\nthat you have around it's a scarcity\nmindset because scarcity means it's\neither this or it's this abundance is it\nis this and it is this and so it is\npossible for you to be an incredible\nparent and an incredible business owner\nbut maybe you just need to expand\nyourself and you need to learn you need\nto grow yourself in order to make both\nof those realities possible in your\nreality and so what you're going to do\nis you're going to get very clear on\nwhat it is that you want and then you're\ngoing to get very clear on what it is\nthat you need to do to get it right you\ncan figure it out stop acting like you\ndon't know we all know or have a pretty\ngood idea of what it is that we need to\ndo to create the life that we want we\njust don't do it and so you have to know\nknow exactly what is that you want and\nthen what you have to do is you have to\nmake a plan to in order to get it and\nunderstand that your plan is not set in\nstone your plan will change and change\nand change along the way things are\ngoing to come up that were unforeseen\ncircumstances and you're going to need\nto make a little bit of a change no big\ndeal change your plan a little bit and\nonce you change it start going with that\nplan it will be okay to take detours\nalong the way as long as the destination\nstays the same and ultimately that is\nyour North Star that you're always\ntrying to head towards is is the life\nthat you're trying to create the\nbusiness you're tring trying to create\nthe happiness you're trying to create\nall of those things and then what you do\nis you get so\nobsessed with this life you want to\ncreate whatever this life is cuz it's\ndifferent for everybody listening you\nget so obsessed and it becomes what I\nlike to call your Magnificent Obsession\nyou're just so obsessed with this thing\nthat what you do is you put every ounce\nof energy besides the fact of like you\nknow feeding your children and taking\nthem to school and all that but you put\nevery ounce of energy into that thing\nthat you're trying to create you become\nobsessed with it and it's really wild I\num I got a voice message this morning\nfrom from one of my teammates uh team\nmembers that that works in my company\nhe's been here for for three years and\nhe told me this awesome story and I\nalways say uh to people you know like if\nI always say stuff like um I used to say\nthis a lot when I when I used to speak\nat events I would sit in front of a\ngroup of people and I would say hey\neverybody in the room what's the\npercentage chance that you make a\nmillion dollars this year and I'd be\nlike you tell me and they would say 0%\nand 0% and 1% and 0% and 2% then some\ncrazy person which would usually be the\nhighest number almost always was 5% oh I\ncould do it 5% and then I say okay\nwhat's the percentage chance of you\nmaking a million dollars this year\nlegally and if you don't everyone that\nyou love dies and everyone's like\nbecause it's the most extreme example I\ncould give you right everyone's like\n100% 100% 100% 100% a th% and I said\nthat's\ninteresting the gold didn't change the\ntime frame didn't change what changed\nyour why your motivation for doing it\nand so I get a voice message this\nmorning from one of my team members and\nit was great cuz he he's like hey I got\nto tell you a story that that goes\nexactly what you're talking about about\nhaving a strong why and having\nmotivation towards something he goes I\ngot a I got a call from one of my\nfriends from college and he said Hey do\nyou remember I'm just let's just say his\nname is Chris right his name is not\nChris but his friend goes hey do you\nremember Chris from college and he goes\nyeah and he goes like Chris was kind of\nlike a not motivated guy he didn't do\nmuch with his life and and he's he's\nexplaining it to me he goes Chris was in\ndebt\n$40,000 uh in gambling debt to some\nbookies who were pretty like hardcore\npeople like the stuff you see in movies\nright and at the beginning of\nFebruary they said you have to pay us\nthe\n$40,000 by the end of this month or\nelse you know things are going to happen\nand there's extreme things that would\nhave happened had he done had he not\npaid them right and so this guy goes oh\nmy god I've got like 20s something days\n28 29 days to be able to pay these\npeople $40,000 I don't have it and so\nwhat did he do he started come thinking\noutside of the box and being not being\nthe same version of himself but going\nholy if I've never done it before\nI've got to do something different so he\nstarted thinking outside the box and so\nwhat he started doing no joke was\ndumpster diving to find things he would\nfind things and then he would sell them\nto pawn shops and then he's like I need\nto make more money I need to figure out\nwhat else I can do and so he started\ngoing to junkyards in finding things\nthat he could sell and so he went to\njunkyards and he was he was getting\nbumpers in junkyards and then selling\nthem for more money in other places and\neBay and all of this stuff he got super\ncreative and guess what he made over\n$40,000 and was able to pay the bookies\nthat he owed why because he owed them\n$40,000 or he could possibly\ndie and I said to him my my team member\nwho's on the team I said what's crazy\nabout that is he could do that every\nsingle month and he would make over\n$480,000 for the year he would make over\nalmost a half a million dollars a year\nif he just decided to be creative and\nhustle as hard as he hustled because he\ndidn't have time he had to hustle he\ndidn't think about his worries he didn't\nthink about his fears he didn't think\nabout his limiting beliefs it's like hey\nI need to do this because I want to live\nand he was able to luckily pay them back\nand be able to do it but it just shows\nyou like he decided he's going to have\nto do something different he's going to\nhave to be somebody different and his\nwhy behind the goal was so strong he\nfigured it out and it's like one of my\nfirst mentors my first coach uh used to\ntell me all the time when your why is\nstrong enough your how will reveal\nitself this guy wanted to live that is\nthe strongest why you could come up with\nhow is going to reveal itself and so\nthat's what you have to figure out\nnumber two is to make a plan and to get\nto have a strong why as to why you want\nto create that and then number three\nwhich is the one that you probably\nhaven't heard too many times I want you\nto disappear for 6 months tell everyone\nthat you know that you're going to\ndisappear for 6 months tell your friends\nI'm gone I can't watch football with you\nI don't care about March Madness I've\ngot to disappear for 6 months because\nI'm going to change my life if they get\nmad about it they were never a true fan\nanyways your truest like your your true\nfriends they shouldn't they should be\nlike yeah man I want you to go do\nit Go disappear become something\ndifferent I can't wait to see you in six\nmonths you can you know go back to your\nnormal scheduled hanging out once you\nfinish but here's what you're going to\ndo you're going to disappear you're not\ngoing to exist anymore you're going to\nstop going to parties you're going to\nstop hanging out with friends stop doing\nanything that does not get you closer to\nthe goal that you wrote down on your\npiece of paper now obviously once again\nas I said a few minutes ago if you have\nchildren you have things that you have\nto take care of right you do have\nchildren that you have to attend to you\nhave to make sure they have everything\nthey need you have your family you have\nto pay the mortgage you have to do all\nthose things anything outside of the\nabsolute necessary you're going to\ndedicate yourself to over the next six\nmonths outside of that in the free time\nto learning that skill to getting better\nat it and to figuring out how to grow a\nbusiness to completely change your life\nand change yourself and I promise you\neverything that once was the way that it\nwas will be exactly the same in 6 months\nI went in in 201 17 I travel with my\ngirlfriend at the time now my wife\nfor 6 months and we left the country we\nwere gone for 6 months when we came back\neverything was exactly the same every\nperson was exactly the same nothing was\ndifferent you can do anything for 6\nmonths we're talking about a complete\nrewiring of yourself and who you are and\nyou will improve as you go you won't be\ngood at these things when you first\nstart but you keep going that's why you\nhave six months and what you're trying\nto do is you're trying to take these six\nmonths to make a complete reset of who\nyou are of who you thought you were\nthese 6 months if taken seriously will\ncompletely change your life now I know\nI'm just being flat out honest most\npeople listening to this podcast

change my life and\nNow's the Time that I'm going to change\nmy life when you bring your head up in\nsix months you will be a different\nperson and then you fast forward five\nyears your life is vastly different than\nif you just decided to stay on the same\npath that you've been on this entire\ntime it's only six months you can do\nanything for six months and I promise\nyou if you dedicate the next 6 months to\nyou learning growing disappearing and\njust focus on that thing and taking care\nof the most important things with your\nfamily and with your bills and with your\njob and all those things but every free\nmoment is going towards you trying to\nbecome the new version of\nyourself it's game over you're a\ndifferent person it's a different life\nand I promise you you're going
