    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you a stepbystep process for\nyou to become the best version of\nyourself let's dive in today I'm going\nto talk to you about how to become the\nbest version of yourself and how to\nbecome the type of person that can\ncreate the life that you want and um now\nif if if you're listen to this podcast\nI'm gonna make a guess right you are\nlistening to this because you want more\nin life whatever more means to you you\nwant more whether that's more money more\nhappiness more joy more peace more\ntraveling more fun more success more\nquality relationships you want more and\nyou know that in order to get more you\nhave to change you've gotten to the\npoint where you're probably not wanting\nto blame anybody else anymore and you're\ngoing well damn it if my life is going\nto be different I have to be different\nbut\nyou know you want this life that you\nwant in the future and it feels like\nit's it's possible but it's just a\nlittle bit out of your grasp and you\ndon't have it yet because you are not\nthe person who can get it yet because if\nyou were you would have already achieved\nwhat it is that you want to achieve you\nhave to understand that if you were the\ntype of person who could create that\nlife that you see in the\nfuture you would already have that life\nif you were the type of person who you\ncould have it and so you know hopefully\nor by the end of this episode you will\ndefinitely know that it is not the\nexternal world that that needs to change\nit is not circumstances that need to\nchange it is you that needs to change\nand so what I would recommend is if you\ncan grab a pen and paper go and grab a\npen of paper because we're going to work\ntogether it's going to be a working\nepisode working session if you're\ndriving your car if you're at the gym\njust think really deeply about the\nquestions that I'm going to ask you here\nthis is an exercise that I take people\nthrough a lot of times when they're on\ncoaching calls with me or they're at\nevents that I'm running and I want you\nto think of your perfect life in 10\nyears whatever that means to you and I\nwant you to get as detailed as you\npossibly can because a lot of times\npeople are like I'm like what do you\nwant they're like I don't really know\nwhat I want right you've got to get very\nclear on what it is that you want\nbecause you're not going to be able to\ncreate it if you don't know exactly what\nit is and so I want you to Envision your\nperfect life in 10 years and if you got\na pen and paper just start jotting\nthings down and and start writing things\ndown as I'm talking if you're at the gym\nyou're working out start allowing your\nyour your Visions to start coming\nthrough start allowing yourself to\ndaydream a little bit while you're doing\nthis what does your perfect life look\nlike in 10 years how happy are you how\ndo you talk to yourself where do you\nlive you know what is what does the\nperfect house look like in 10 years\nwhat's the location look like like is it\na is it a a a small condo in Manhattan\nis that the perfect place for you is it\na townhouse is it a a huge mansion\nthat's Spanish style is it modern do you\nhave property do you have no property\nare you on a mountain are you on a river\nare you you know in the middle of\nnowhere what does it look like to you\nyou have to see it you have to get clear\nwith you got to be able to like taste it\nand touch it with your mind almost right\nwhere is it located what's your family\nlook like what's your relationships look\nlike what does your bank account look\nlike and I want you to detail as much of\nit as you possibly can and the key to it\nas you're doing this is to make sure\nthat you act like a four-year-old and\nwhat do I mean by acting like a\nfour-year-old is that don't be realistic\nbecause there's no such thing as\nrealistic there really isn't there is no\nsuch thing as being realistic being\nrealistic means taking other people's\nexpectations and planting it onto\nyourself and so when you're four years\nold remember being four have you ever\nbeen around a four-year-old like it's\nlike magic they can do anything and they\nhave this mindset where there is nothing\nthat can hold them back and so for this\nmoment as you're you're writing down\neverything that you want allow yourself\nto be four years old again don't\nrestrict yourself allow yourself to have\nfun with it okay and if you need to\npause me as we're going through today's\nepisode so you can Journal through it no\nproblem pause me I'll be here literally\nforever whenever you want to push play\nagain okay the next thing I want you to\nask yourself is when you're looking at\nthis life imagine that it's not you\nimagine that it's somebody else right\nwhen you're looking at this life and\neverything that you that you want in the\nfuture what are the traits of someone\nwho could create that life if somebody\nhas gone and created that life or\nsomebody could create that life in the\nfuture describe that person to me in as\nmuch detail as you possibly\ncan everything what time do they wake up\nwhat do they do on a daily basis um what\ndo they eat do how often do they work\nout how do they take care of their body\nhow do they take care of their soul how\ndo they take care of their mindset what\ntype of people do they surround\nthemselves with how do they speak to\nothers how do they speak to themselves\nhow do they walk through the world what\ntype of energy do they have how do they\ncarry themselves how do they how do they\ninteract with themselves and how do they\ninteract with the world and what you\nwant to do is you want to get into as\nmuch detail and don't pretend that it's\nyou at all I want you to see okay\nperfect life\nand if somebody were able to create this\nperfect life who would it be what would\nthey be like and describe that person in\nas much detail as possible sometimes\nit's good to disassociate yourself from\nyour dreams so that you don't put any\nrestriction on it and you just say this\nperson that has created that life this\nis as much as I can tell you about them\nokay and then what you're going to do is\nyou're going to figure out what what is\nthe difference between that person who\nyou just described in you now what's the\ndifference between the two of them and\nyou start figuring out okay if that\nperson created that life all I really\nneed to do is wake up every single day\nand start becoming that person more and\nmore start acting like that person start\nthinking like that person start speaking\nlike that person start speaking to\nothers like that person start speaking\nto myself like that other like that\nperson and you literally start to say I\nneed to become that person more and more\nevery day right so what does that person\ndo that you do not\ndo maybe they don't stay up late maybe\nthey don't sleep in maybe they don't eat\nlike maybe they don't talk\nnegatively to yourself maybe they don't\nstay in contact with toxic in contact\nwith toxic people right and you start to\nfigure out what's the difference between\nme and what's the difference between\nthem and you start to plan out what\nchanges you need to make within yourself\nin order to create that life and you can\ndo a little um what I like to call stop\nand continue okay stop st and continue I\ngot this from years ago like 15 years\nago I got this from uh from P Diddy when\nhe used to have a show I think it was uh\nI think it's called Like Making the Band\nI'm pretty sure the band was Danity Kane\nand um and they create and this is me\nlike just pulling from my memory if I'm\nnot correct that's what someone told me\none time right but I remember he had\nthis thing where he would um have the\nband members sit down with each other\nand they would have open and honest\nconversations and they would say stop\nstart continue so um so Stacy I want you\nto stop doing this Stacy I want you to\nstart doing this and Stacy I want you to\ncontinue doing this and I took that when\nI was first a brand new manager and I\nstarted molding it for people to be able\nto do for themselves and so what I want\nyou to do is say okay in order for me to\nshift myself into who I currently am\ninto that person person what do I need\nto stop doing and you start writing all\nthe things that you need to stop doing I\nneed to stop talking trash to myself I\nneed to stop eating crappy food I need\nto stop staying up late I need to stop\nsleeping in I need to stop saying that\nI'm going to do something and not\nfollowing through right so you write\ndown all of the things that you need to\nstop doing that are holding you back\nfrom from creating the life that you\nwant then you ask yourself what do I\nneed to start doing and once again\neverybody you can pause me as you're\ngoing through this if you're taking\nnotes and you're journaling and you want\nto use this as a working session what do\nI need to start doing okay I need to\nstart going to bed earlier I need to\nstart waking up earlier I need to start\ndoing my morning workouts every single\nmorning I need to develop a morning\nroutine these are all of the things I\nwant to start doing I need to start\ntaking out uh taking um all of my meals\nplanning them out and getting them done\nand prepped by the beginning of the week\nwhat do you need to start doing in order\nto be more like that person and what do\nyou need to continue doing that you're\nalready doing pretty well and you're on\nthe right path and you don't put any\nemotion into this you don't put any\njudgment into this you don't put any\nshame into it it's literally just as if\nyou were just making business decisions\nwhat do I need to stop doing to start\nwhat do I need to stop doing so that I\ncan become more like that person that I\nsee that has that perfect life the life\nthat I want what do I need to start\ndoing to be more like that person and\nwhat do I need to continue doing to be\nmore like that person as well and what\nyou realize and it's really interesting\nas you start to realize it is that it's\nnot necessarily\nwhat you have to do like there's\ndefinitely things that you have to do in\norder to become successful and in order\nto change and all of that but it's more\nthan anything else it's who you need to\nbe right so it's not necessarily what\nyou need to do it's who you need to be\nyou need to wake up every morning and be\nthat\nperson just be that person every single\nday you know this person is now the new\ngoal that you shoot for every single day\nto put that person I I love um one of\nthings that I love and I think is so\nimportant is that is Tony Robins says\nthis in in one of the videos that I've\nseen him say and he says when you see\nthis guy that's in front of you this\nisn't how I was born I built this\n and that's how he actually\nsays he's like I built this\nthat you see in front of me that's\nexactly what you need to do is to build\nthat version of you that person that you\nsee that has the life that you want is\nnow your new goal to shoot for every\nsingle day to be more like that person\nevery single day that life that you saw\nthat is the perfect life to you that's\njust a byproduct of this person and who\nthey are and what they do every single\nday and so when you are the type of\nperson that that can create that life\nyou automatically are going to start to\ndo the things that you need to do so\nobviously you can't just sit there and\njust meditate on being this person you\nhave to go out into the world and do\nthings but as you start to develop this\ncharacter that you want to turn into you\nactually start to take the actions that\nthat character would take so you don't\nreally necessarily need to worry about\nwhat you need to do you still need to do\nthe things but you worry about who you\nare and who you're becoming more than\nanything\nelse who you are and who you're becoming\nand you start using this person as like\nyour North Star like your Guiding Light\nand you start to say okay like maybe you\nwake up oh my God I'm so tired I want to\nhit the snooze alarm you ask yourself\nthis question would the best version of\nmyself in 10 years hit the\nsnooze would the best version of myself\nin 10 years stay up late with the best\nversion of myself in 10 years have an\nextra whiskey whatever it might be that\nyou're doing and you use this as a kind\nof way to decipher and figure out in\nthis weird world that we live in and\nwe're creating what's the best action\nfor me to take and what's next not the\nbest action for me to take CU all too\noften I hear from people on coaching\ncalls oh I just I'm self-sabotaged\nself-sabotage self-sabotage\nself-sabotage self-sabotage is going\nwell I could become I could cre take the\nright action to become the person I want\nto be or I couldn't you know what it's\neasier not to so I'm just not going to\nthat's what self-sabotage is taking the\nsame actions over and over again that\nkeep you stuck in the place that you're\ncurrently in how do you get out of\nself-sabotage take different actions\nthat are just completely different than\nwhat you normally would so you use this\nperson as your North Star what's the\nbest what would the best version of\nmyself in 10 years du would they be\ndoing what I'm doing now like if you're\nif you're trying to become more\nself-aware and you sit there and you say\nwith the best version of myself in 10\nyears be doing this if the answer is yes\nkeep doing it go for it do exactly what\nyou're doing if that's what they would\ndo if you're sitting there and you're\nsaying would the best version of me in\n10 years do what I'm doing right now if\nthe answer is no ask yourself what would\nthey do don't shame yourself don't be an\n to yourself don't beat yourself\nup don't guilt yourself that's what\npeople tend to do oh my God I'm not\ndoing what I need to be doing boohoo and\nthen they get all mad at themselves no\njust okay so reassess okay it's not okay\nthis is not what they would be doing\nokay what would they be doing and then\nyou just stop what you're doing\nimmediately and you just start doing\nwhat they would do it's not it's not\nhonestly rocket science but what it is\nis it is a way to first off start to\nplan out the life that you want plan out\nwho you need to become and then have a a\na practice of self-awareness\nof what it is that you need to do in the\nmoment to become that person more and so\nyou start to really dive into it is you\nit's the question is kind of like the\nquestion I've said many times which is\nwhat was taught to me by one of my first\nmentors which is is what I'm doing right\nnow getting me closer to or further for\nmy goals like I I wrote this in my book\nin the book if you guys want to buy it\nit's called level up it's everywhere\nwhere where books are available if you\njust search for level up but the\nquestion is is what I'm doing right now\ngetting me closer to or further for my\ngoals if it's getting me closer to my\ngoals then I'm just going to keep doing\nit if I'm if it's getting me further\nfrom my goals I need to stop it\nimmediately but it's this this\ndeveloping of the self-awareness to look\nat myself in the moment take myself out\nof my body look at myself as a third\nperson and say okay is this thing that\nI'm doing right here getting me closer\nto my goals or in what the context we're\nsaying today would the perfect version\nof me be doing what I'm doing right\nnow yes awesome perfect keep doing it\nthat's getting you close to your goals\nwould the perfect version of me be doing\nwhat I'm doing right\nnow not necessarily they wouldn't okay\nwhat would they be doing don't beat\nyourself up don't guilt yourself don't\nshame yourself just make a quick change\nwhat would they be doing oh they be\ndoing this okay I'm going to take this\naction with a perfect version of me hit\nthe snooze\nbutton damn it no they wouldn't what\nwould they do they would wake up and\nthey would go through the morning\nroutine all right well then I'm just\njust going to do what they would do and\nyou're not you're not building yourself\nbased off of some some person that that\nis has a status that you feels\nunattainable of like oh my gosh there's\nthis billionaire that I follow that's\nvery successful I want a life like\ntheirs because sometimes it just feels\nlike they're too far away it feels like\nsometimes I found with people is people\nget demotivated when they find somebody\nthat's so far away oh my gosh this guy's\nworth a billion dollars and he's the\nperson I want to follow and then you\nwake up in the morning you're like would\nthis person do this and you're like\nscrew it this person's so far ahead of\nme I'm never going to get there\nbut if you look at the perfect version\nof yourself knowing that you could be\nbuild yourself into that you say would\nthat perfect version of me do this and\nthen what is the practice to make you\nmore aware of when you fall off the path\nlike what is the practice is it you know\nsetting an alarm every 30 minutes in\nyour phone randomly and whenever it goes\noff you just go what am I doing and you\njust become more aware so that you're\nnot just in autopilot because according\nto Harvard about 48% of what we do on a\ndaily basis is\nautopilot and that autopilot has gotten\nyou to where you are and so if we want\nto change our lives we're going to have\nto change what it is that we do on\nautopilot sometimes and so you have to\ndevelop some sort of practice to make\nyou more aware of when you fall off the\npath and then immediately get you back\non the path and really what it's about\nis is acting as if you already are that\nperson what would your life be like if\nyou took that person and planted them\ninto your day today and started becoming\nthat person if you started Act acting\nlike that person doing what that person\ndoes talking to yourself the way that\nperson talks to himself talking to other\npeople the way they talk to them paying\nattention to who they surround\nthemselves with and you just start\nbecoming that version of you and you\nfast forward to 10 years from today with\nhaving this self-awareness practice you\nwill create the life that you want and I\nguarantee you it's going to be even\nbetter than you could possibly imagine\nin your life but what it comes down to\nis you deciding that you are going to\nchange into the person that you actually\nwant to be doesn't matter what anybody\nelse wants what it matters is what do\nyou want what are you trying to create\nand what do you need to do to get there\nbut most importantly who do you need to\nbe in order to get there so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories tag me in at Rob\ndial Jr r o d r o b d a l Jr the only\nway this podcast grows is from you guys\nactually sharing it so if you would do\nme a massive favor if you get value from\nwhat I put out there you want to help us\non the podcast but also help us help\nhelp us change the world and you know\nhave more people become aware of the\npodcast because there's more people in\nthis world who don't know this podcast\nexist than do um just do me a favor\nshare it so that we can try to keep\nimpacting more and more people and uh\nand with that I'm going to leave you the\nsame way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission and make\nsomeone else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
