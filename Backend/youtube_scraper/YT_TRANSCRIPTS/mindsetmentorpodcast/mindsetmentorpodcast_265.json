    "transcript": "welcome today I'm going to teach you the\nstepbystep process of how to accomplish\nthe life that you want without focusing\non your goals let's dive in I've been\ncoaching people uh what are we at 18\nyears now at this point and I have told\npeople to write down their goals I have\ntold people to focus on their goals\nevery single day and goals are great\nthey are important but goals are\nextremely overrated uh go goals can\nactually become really demotivating if\nyou are really far away from those goals\nyou know so sometimes people are like\nall right I'm going to write down my\n10-year goal and they might get excited\nabout it some people write down their\n10-year goal and it actually becomes\ndemotivating because they're like oh my\nGod I'm so far away I'm so far behind\nthere's so many things I need to do to\nget there I'll never get there and they\ndon't do anything and it becomes\nparalysis by analysis and so today I'm\ngoing to teach you what to focus on what\nto pay attention to\nand what to work towards that is way\nmore important than your goals and\nyou're going to walk you through an\nexact process I'll give you a couple of\nexamples that will help you learn how to\nhit your goals by not making them the\nmost important thing so you'll still\nhave goals you'll still hit your goals\nbut you won't be focusing on your goals\nin any sort of way so here's the very\nsimple four-step process okay the first\nthing is you have to decide what it is\nthat you want it's it's crazy to me how\nfew people actually know what it is that\nthey want and they very rarely know what\nthey want they they for sure know what\nthey don't want but rarely do they\nactually get really clear on what they\nwant so the first thing that you do need\nto do is you do need to figure out your\ngoals and then we're going to build\nsomething else around them so you don't\nhave to focus on them right so you have\nto figure out your goals and the more\nclear that you can get about what it is\nthat you want what is that you're\nworking towards what is that you're\ntrying to accomplish the more likely you\nare to hit it and so I always say this\nbut when you're writing out your goals\ndon't say I want to lose weight because\nif you lose one pound you accomplish\nyour goal but I'm pretty sure you didn't\nwant to just lose one pound don't say I\nwant to make more money say I want to\nmake exactly this amount of money or I\nwant to save exactly this amount of\nmoney because if you make $1 more you\nmade more money which means you\nbasically hit your goals but I'm pretty\nsure that's not what you wanted and so\nget very detailed about your goals and\nwhat exactly what is that you want how\nyou know you're going to hit it how you\nknow like if you did hit it how would\nyou know that you got there and so the\nmore clear the better once you feel like\nyou have gotten clearing your goals get\neven more clear and now you're really\nclearing your goals so that's the first\nthing decide what is it you want second\nthing is to make a plan on what you need\nto do to get there now mind you this\nplan will not be perfect I promise you\nthat so if you're sitting around like I\nneed to make the perfect plan plan and\nthat's what's holding you back from\ntaking the as as you need to your plan\nwill never be perfect but it at least\ngives you somewhat of a road map to get\nstarted so some people they figure out\ntheir goals and then they get caught up\nin the plan and they don't take any\naction because they have to get you know\nso in the minutia of their plan no no no\nyou just need to come up with some sort\nof plan knowing that there's probably\ngoing to be detours along the way third\nthing is you need to figure out what\ndaily actions need to to be taken in\norder to hit that goal this is where it\nreally starts getting important you\nfigure out what daily actions need to be\ntaken in order to hit that goal and so\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to\ngo from our goals to our daily actions\nand the daily actions are way more\nimportant than the goals and so let's\nsay for instance that you want to lose\n10 pounds right well cool that's the\ngoal that is the results based goal that\nyou're shooting for but what daily Act\nneed to be taken in order to hit that\ngoal maybe it's hey I need to get 10,000\nsteps in every single day maybe that's a\ndaily action a non-negotiable of what\nneeds to happen maybe it's 30 minutes of\nmoving my body whatever that might be\nany sort of movement of the body is fine\nso it might be yoga one day it might be\nworking out another day whatever it\nmight be you figure out what daily\nactions need to be taken in order to hit\nthat goal and then number four you're\ngoing to make this really easy on\nyourself okay okay cuz all too often\nwe're making it way too hard on yourself\nwe're going to wake up every single\nmorning and we're going to make a plan\nand we're going to take 5 minutes and\nhere's what you do you put down your\nto-do list for the day and you're going\nto have this to-do list that is 10\nthings that's 17 things for some of you\nguys it's 47 things and you're going to\nfigure out what the top three things are\nfor the day that's it and what you're\ngoing to do is you're going to take an\nindex card a 3x5 card and you're going\nto write number one most important thing\nis this number two most important thing\nis this number three most important\nthing is this and you're going to put\nyour to-do list off to the side you're\ngoing to take that index card you're\ngoing to put in your back pocket and\nyou're going to work on number one and\nyou don't go to number two until number\none is finished and then you can go to\nnumber two and then you go to number\nthree after number two is finished and\nwhat you start to realize is that\ninstead of focusing on all of the things\nthat don't matter you're going to focus\non the three things that do matter cuz\nwhat I have found with a lot of people\nis that your to-do list is so long you\nwant to start Crossing off the easy\nthings so that your to-do list feels a\nlittle bit smaller but in reality that's\nnot helping you accomplish the big goals\nthat you want to in life you ever had a\nday where you're so busy all day long in\nlike 7:30 hits and you're like I got to\nlay down and you were busy all day long\nbut you have this feeling like you got\nnothing accomplished well the reason why\nis because you weren't checking off the\nboxes of things that actually really\ntruly matter and I I talk about this in\nmy book level up and the the the whole\nthing that I talk about inside of the\nchapter in level up is results based\ngoals versus action-based goals a\nresults based goal is the result that\nyou're looking for and that's how we\nstart our goals which is I want to lose\n30 lbs that is a results-based goal I\nwant to make $100,000 that is a results\nbased goal I want to save $12,000 this\nyear that is a results based goal all of\nthose is where we start but we need to\ntake our results based goals and turn\nthem into action-based goals which is\nwhat are the daily actions that need to\nbe taken so if I want to lose 30 pounds\nthat's the result what is the action\nbased goal that needs to be taken like I\nsaid it might be 10,000 steps a day it\nmight be 30 minutes of movement every\nsingle day so we have to take our\nresults based goal and we need to turn\nthem into daily action based goals and\nit's pretty simple we really tend to\nover complicate things goals only really\nneed three things and I say this all the\ntime in the podcast because I try to\nmake things as simple as possible for\neverybody goals need three things they\nneed direction they need action and they\nneed\ntime the time part is where most people\nstruggle because they want it now and\nlife just doesn't happen now you're not\ngoing to walk into a gym do one workout\nand then be pissed that you wake up in\nthe morning you don't have a six-pack\nyet right you know that things take time\ngreat things take time so let's say with\nyour direction action time with your\ngoals right am I heading in the right\ndirection am I taking the right action\nlet's that time work its way out let's\nsay that I want to lose weight let's\nfigure out how much I get very clear\nexactly what it is how much I want to uh\nhow much weight I want to lose all right\nwhat's my direction okay I'm going to do\nmovement every single day I'm going to\ndo four heavy lifting workouts a day I'm\nsorry four heavy lifting workouts a week\nand then I'm going to do three sessions\nof yoga but at least I'm getting my body\nmoving every single\nday and another thing I need to focus on\nwith my direction is I know what meals\nI'm going to be eating this week so I'm\ngoing to plan out my meals for the\nentire week and I'm going to you know on\nSunday I'm going to make my Monday\nTuesday Wednesday Thursday meals on\nThursday I'm going to make my Friday\nSaturday Sunday meals so I know what\nmeals I'm going to be eating and I'm I'm\ngoing to be planning them out I'm going\nto be cooking them then what I'm going\nto do to make sure I'm heading in the\nright right direction is I'm going to\nremove all the food that doesn't fit and\ndoesn't help me get to the weight that I\nwant to get to it's really uh a diet is\nreally a lifestyle change it's your\nmovement it's your mindset it's the food\nthat you're eating it's your environment\nChang Ching to make it easier for you so\nit might be like hey I'm going to still\nwatch Netflix for an hour every single\nday like I have been but what I'm going\nto do is I'm going to make myself uh I'm\ngoing to be on my my bike my pelaton and\nI'm going to have to while I'm watching\nNetflix I have to be on my bike fine\nwell at least you're still able to do\nsomething that you enjoy but you're also\ndoing something that's helping you get\nto your goal by focusing on the right\naction so those are the direction right\nam I heading in the right direction I\nknow my four workout out s that I'm\ngoing to be doing every single week I\nknow those three yoga sessions I'm going\nto be doing I know the meals I'm going\nto be eating I'm going to move all the\nthe food that doesn't fit now action\nwell I need to make sure that I show up\nto the gym I need to execute on the plan\nokay what else do I need to do the\naction I need to make sure that I'm\nprepping those 21 meals throughout this\nweek so I've got my direction and then\nthe next thing I have to do is I I have\nto take the the right action and I don't\nneed to focus on tomorrow I don't need\nto focus next week I need to just focus\non today what's the action that I need\nto do today and then time it just has to\nwork its way out and this is the one\nthat we all want to control but it's the\nonly one that we can't\ncontrol am I heading in the right\ndirection am I taking the right action\nweight just doesn't fall off overnight\nand so if I just know hey I'm heading in\nthe right direction of a healthier\nlifestyle I'm taking the right action of\na healthier lifestyle eventually I'm\ngoing to get to where I want to be right\nlet's say that um let's say that my\nother thing is you know know it\ndirection action time I want to save\n$6,000 this year you I've been really\nbad with saving money so I'm going to\nsave $6,000 this year and um if I do the\nmath that's $500 a month okay $500 a\nmonth so what's the direction well I'm\ngoing to stop eating out so much I'm\ngoing to stop going to coffee shops I\ncan make coffee in my house I'm going to\nstop doing those things I'm going to\nautomatically deduct a certain amount\nfrom every single paycheck I'm going to\ncheck my bank account every single day\nI'm going to make sure that I'm heading\nin the right dire\nDirection okay now what about the\nactions that I need to take well I have\nto actually physically go and set up the\nautomatic deduction whether that's in\nperson at the bank whether that is\ntalking to my employer whether that is\ndoing it online I need to actually take\nthe action of setting up the automatic\ndeduction so am I heading in the right\ndirection am I taking the right action\nnow we got to make sure time works its\nway out not all the money will be in my\nbank account right away but if I'm\nheading in the right direction taking\nthe right action eventually I'm going to\nget there and so at this point when\nyou're doing this your goals almost\nbecome unnecessary now they're necessary\nbecause they see they give you like a uh\nyour your result Bas goals they give you\nkind of like a uh I guess you could call\nlike a a shining star in the distance\nlike it's our North Star that we're\ntrying to go towards but I don't need to\nfocus on the Northstar I just need to\nlook at my feet and I need to say hey am\nI taking the one step closer and one\nstep closer and one step closer towards\nthat Northstar right I care more about\nbeing an action taker than a goal\naccomplisher because you know if as long\nas I'm taking the right action the goal\nwill eventually get accomplished once\nagain being somebody who's been working\non this for a long time it almost never\nhappens as fast as I wanted to because\nin fact when I set a goal I wanted it to\nhave happened last week like I said it\ntoday and I'm like damn it why didn't\nhappen already right so it almost never\nhappens as fast as I want to but I know\nthat if I'm taking the right action it\nwill eventually happen whether that is\nthis week this month this year this\ndecade if I'm heading in the right\ndirection I'm taking the right action\nI'll eventually get there and so goals\njust need those three things they need\ndirection action time we need to sit\ndown we need to get very clear on what\nthey are and then we need to do is we\njust need to take the right action\ntowards it goals take time become\nsomeone who checks off their top three\nthings every single day become someone\nwho takes action become someone who\ndoesn't overthink anymore because there\nis nothing to overthink okay I've got it\ndown I've just got to do the thing\nconsistent daily action is what is going\nto compound and absolutely change your\nlife all I'm worried about is being\nconsistent with my daily action every\nday it blows my mind how much BS\nsomebody will make up in their mind to\nstop them from taking the action that\nthey need to create the life that they\nwant right decide what it is that you\nwant figure out those goals you have\nthat Northstar that thing that you can\nwork towards make a plan of what it is\nthat you need to do to get there and\nthen just figure out what daily actions\nneed to be taken in order to hit those\ngoals and then just wake up put your\nTodo list down put your top three things\non a 3x5 card and just accomplish those\nthree things even if you get\nnothing else but the number one most\nimportant thing done every single day\nyou are heading in the right direction\nyou're taking the right action you're\nmoving towards the right place what it\nis for you is you need to just make sure\nokay I've got my goal but I just need to\ntake one step closer one step closer one\nstep closer one step closer there's a uh\nfor those of you that are overthinkers\nout there um I know go ahead and raise\nyour hand the overthinkers there's a lot\nof you out there right but um there's a\nuh a really cute quote from a book that\nuh that's also a movie and um it's\ncalled the boy the mole the fox the\nhorse and there's a point where this\nlittle boy is is in the forest and he\nsays to the the horse he says I can't\nsee my way out of the forest and which\nmeans like there's too much there's\nthere's there's so many things that I\nneed to do the life has just become so\ncomplex so he says I can't see my way\nout of the\nforest and then the the horse says well\ncan you see your next step and the boy\nsays yes and he says just take the next\nstep all too\noften we think so much about what needs\nto be done and very rarely just take the\nnext step and take the right action so\ndon't think about it so much just make\nsure that you're going what's my next\nstep not what's step number two what's\nstep number five what's step number 100\nwhat is the next step and if I just take\nthat step and I have my action-based\ngoals in place I will eventually get to\nthe point where I go oh my God I\naccomplished my goal I lost the 30b I\nsaved the\n$6,000 I built the business that I\nwanted to whatever your goal is for you\nso just make sure use the four steps in\norder to hit your goals and then just as\nI said make sure you're heading in the\nright direction take the right action\nand let time work its way out so that's\nall I got for you for today's episode if\nyou love this episode
