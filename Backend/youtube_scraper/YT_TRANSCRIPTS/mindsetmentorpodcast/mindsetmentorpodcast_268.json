    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to improve at being a\nmeditator step by step let's dive in you\nknow I've been meditating since 2009 I'm\nstill not great at it I am way better\nthan I was before I'm getting better um\nand that's okay because I I have no\nattachment to mastering meditation I'm\nnot a monk I'm not trying to become the\nbest meditator that's ever been alive I\njust do it for the benefits and the way\nthat I feel when I do it you know I've\ndone a I've done a 10day silent\nMeditation Retreat uh it's called vasana\nand um I uh you can't speak you can't\nlook people in the eyes you can't\nJournal you can't uh work out you can't\ndo yoga you can either meditate you can\nsit in you know the sun outside or you\ncould sleep that's basically all the\noptions that you have for 10 days and um\na lot of stuff comes up when you don't\nhave anything that you can keep yourself\nbusy with um I've done week long Dr Joe\ndespen advanc treats where you meditate\nand it's like basically meditation boot\ncamp and um I've been doing it for a\nwhile and the first time I started\ngetting into it is because I read about\nit in a book and I started thinking why\nI can try this out and so you know if\nI'm still not great at it why do it\nthat's the first question that probably\npops up right if you've been doing it\nfor so long and you're getting a little\nbit better but you're still not\nmastering it why do you still do it um\nand the reason why is because I see so\nmany benefits and it's pretty crazy I uh\nyou know I do events and I do zooms and\nI get live in front of people in many\ndifferent ways and it's crazy to me how\nfew people actually still meditate every\nsingle day like how few people do it you\nknow like people who listen to the\npodcast will come to an event they'll\ncome to a zoom that I'm running and it's\nlike 5% of people when I ask the\nquestion how many people meditate every\nsingle day it's like 5 7% of the people\nit's so\nlow I'm just really Blown Away why that\nis so why meditate in the first place I\nguess I kind of need to tell you the\nbenefits of it so you can actually see\nbecause a lot of people they say like oh\nI feel like it's a waste of time they\nfeel like they're not being productive\nlike there's something more productive\nthey could be doing and as somebody who\nis Hardcore on efficiencies and\nproductivity I get that feeling um but\nit's it's like the phrase I heard\nsomebody say one time if you don't have\n30 minutes to meditate you need 3 hours\nto meditate cuz you got to chill the\nhell out right and so why would you\nmeditate well there's a lot of really\ngood reasons to meditate there's a lot\nof studies um and I was I was\nresearching a lot of them for this\nepisode and I'll give you a couple of\nthem that really show you the benefits\nof it because I want you to actually\nstart doing it before I tell you how to\ndo it right so um there was a study that\nwas published in Consciousness and\ncognition back in\n2010 and found out that brief daily\nmeditation enhances your attention it\nenhances your memory it enhances your\nmood and your emotional\nregulation and they found this in\nnon-experienced\nmeditators and they found that even\nshort periods of meditation can have\nimmediate benefits on enhancing\nenhancing your cognitive functioning so\npeople like oh I'm not being productive\nwell if if you can enhance your\ncognitive function your attention span\nyour memory your mood and your emotional\nregulation I think that's pretty good\nright and this was done in nonex\nexperien meditators okay so it helps\nwith with your cognitive functioning\nalso helps with your depression there\nwas a research that was done at Harvard\nthat investigated how mindfulness-based\ncognitive therapy changes brain activity\nin the structure of the brain in people\nwho are depressed\npatients and so the study aimed at\nunderstanding how meditation affects\nintros setion which is body awareness\nand rumination which are both critical\nin depression and by focusing on on uh\nby focusing attention on the present\nthrough meditation they found that it\ncan actually help break the cycle of\nnegative thoughts that are very typical\nin depression so it's been found to help\nwith depression as well and it also\nhelps with brain aging so it slows the\nAging of your brain down there was a\nstudy that was done in 2016 and it\ncompared the the it compared brains of\n50 long-term meditators along with 50\ncontrols and they found that meditators\nbrains on average appeared about 7 and\n1/2 years younger than those who did not\nmeditate suggesting that meditation\nactually might slow down your brain\naging so I get it for those you guys are\nlike I have to do I'm busy I got a\nbusiness I've got a family I've got\nstuff that's got to be done I don't have\n10 minutes I get it but you do and\nthere's a lot of benefits in it and it\nmakes you a better person it makes you a\nbetter parent it makes you uh slower to\nreact and not blow up on people and so\nit is very important I think for\neveryone to do it so for the 95% of\npeople that are listening that don't do\nit every day try it out just it's 5 10\nminutes not really a big deal so let's\ntalk about how to how to meditate um\nonce again I've been doing it for 15 16\nyears at this point and um I'm not a\nmaster but I know some things that have\ndefinitely helped me over the time that\nI've been doing it um I personally have\nfound that I like to do breath work\nbefore\nand so uh I'll give you a couple\ndifferent tips but uh I've gone straight\ninto meditating for years and I have\nfound that my brain can go all over the\nplace if I go straight into meditating\nand I'll sit for 20 minutes and for 20\nminutes all I'm thinking about is my\nto-do list I've had it happen many times\nright and so what I found is what calms\nme down a whole lot more and kind of\ngets me out of my head and into my body\nis doing breath work and it can be very\nsimple breath work it can be six deep\nbreaths which if you've been listening\nthis podcast for a long time you know\nthere was a Japanese study that found\nthat six deep breaths changes the state\nof people very quickly and so it's just\nin through the nose breathe out through\nthe mouth and a long exhale like you're\nbreathing out through a straw that's a\nvery short version of it that takes\nabout a minute two minutes at most um\nthere's somebody who I have no\naffiliation with but I've been loving\nhis YouTube videos over the past six\nmonths and uh he's got a YouTube that's\ncalled breathe with Sandy and it's just\nthis guy that just does breath work and\njust puts up free episodes and about 15\nminutes 10 minutes there's some 5 minute\nones um all the way up to 40 minutes and\nso I like to do about a 15minute session\nof breathe with Sandy and then do about\n15 minutes of meditation um it doesn't\nmatter what you do I just find that it\nhelps me get out of my head and into my\nbody you can do six deep breaths you can\nlook up breathe with Sandy you can do\nsomething else you can do box breathing\nyou can do whatever it is that you want\nbut I find that breathing kind of gets\nme out of my head into my body and\nallows me to kind of be more present and\nnot just be everywhere else next thing\nthat I have found that works really well\nand this is what I learned in the 10day\nsilent Meditation Retreat that I did\nyears ago um you know about six seven\nyears ago at this point that I did this\nis to get yourself in a meditation\nposition uh I recommend not laying down\nuh because if you're laying down you're\nprobably going to fall asleep and that's\nnot the point that's not meditation\nthat's a nap and take it from someone\nwho's taken many ACD accidental naps\nwhen trying to meditate that's not a nap\nor that's not that's not meditation\nthat's a nap right so you know how to\nget into a meditation position you could\njust sit and put your feet on the floor\nand your hands on your knees whatever it\nis that you want I recommend sitting up\nand here's the thing you can set a timer\nyou can listen to a song that's a\ncertain amount of time you find your\nposition and then here's the thing that\nbugs people the most do not move a\nmuscle after you find yourself in your\nposition because what I have found is\nthat your brain is so used to\ndistraction that when you start to get\ninto deep meditation your brain wants to\ndistract you how does it distract you by\nhaving a little itch on your nose by\nfeeling like there's a little itch that\nhappens to be in your earlobe and so\nwhat happens is if you if you distract\nand go and itch that thing well then you\njust got out of your meditation and so I\nalways say if a fly were to land on your\nface you're just going to let him walk\naround and you're not going to be like\noh my God he's so dirty but I don't know\nwhere that F's been what if he was in\nthe trash get over it you're not going\nto die it's not a big deal if he lands\non your face or she lands on your face\nlet him walk around and what we're\ntrying to do through this meditation is\nto build the muscle we're so reactive\nall day long we're reactive to our text\nmessages to our emails to other people\nbarging in we're trying to build the\nmuscle of not being reactive because our\nreaction muscle is so damn strong\nand so you just sit there and you don't\nmove a muscle if you get sore let\nyourself be sore it will go away\neventually if you have an itch let it be\nthere it'll go away eventually if a fly\nlands in your face let it be there it\nwill go away eventually and so what\nyou'll notice is you sit in your\nmeditation position and your brain goes\nwild it goes bonkers the point of\nmeditating like if you're sitting there\nand you meditate for 5 minutes and\nyou're like oh my God my brain was\neverywhere the point of meditation is to\nnot think I'm sorry the point of\nmeditation is not not to think the point\nis to not think nothing the point of\nmeditation which I don't hear people say\nenough is to observe your\nthoughts observe your thoughts what\nyou'll notice is whatever happens in\nmeditation is actually what is always\nhappening in your brain but you're just\nnot allowing yourself to observe it\nright so the way I like to describe\nmeditation and observing your thoughts\nis Imagine That you're just sitting on a\nmountain right and you see down below\nthere happens to be a um a road and\nthere's just cars that are just driving\nby every once a while on that road and\nyou're just sitting on the mountain\nyou're just watching the cars go by that\nis what meditation is it is becoming\nmore aware of your thoughts not\nidentifying with your thoughts but\nbecoming aware of what's going on in\nyour mind but you're just so damn busy\nall day that you're not actually aware\nof what's going on in your mind right\nyou're you're just becoming more aware\nof yourself whatever comes up during\nduring your meditation is your normal\nself meditation is not bringing it up\nit's showing you what your normal self\nis so like if if you get anxious during\nmeditation it's because you're anxious\nprobably throughout the day mind you I\nhave dealt with this right I have sat\ndown to meditate and then had 15 minutes\nof just being anxious as and I was\nlike why am I so anxious I don't know\nwhat's going on and I start getting\nanxious about being anxious and then I'm\nlike\nokay this is what's normally going on\nthroughout the day but I'm just so damn\nbusy I'm not allowing I'm running from\nit and so I'm just going to sit here and\nI'm just going to just watch my\nanxiousness and if it wants to stay here\nit can stay here but I'm just not going\nto resist it and what's really\ninteresting when you have that\nanxiousness and you don't resist the\nanxiousness it slowly starts to go away\nand it doesn't what you resist persists\nand so it's just like all right Rob we\ngoing to be anxious throughout this\nmeditation today what's funny is when I\nwhen you just let go like when I let go\nand I'm like I'm going to be anxious\nthroughout this\nmeditation it's like it's like dropping\na little sugar cube into water it slowly\nstarts to just disappear and dissolve\nand your anxiousness sometimes not\nalways I promise you sometimes you're\ngoing to have a 20-minute meditation\nyou're just anxious throughout the\nentire time and you're like what the\n did I do that for right you're just\nstarting to learn yourself is what\nyou're trying to do so if you get\nanxious during your meditation which\nonce again I've had happened before\nyou're probably just anxious throughout\nthe\nday it's the way it goes and we're\ntrying to get away from those things and\nnot resist them anymore right the\ndifference is you're just not keeping so\nbusy that you're able to hide from it if\nyou get distracted throughout your\nmeditation you're probably easily\ndistracted throughout the day if you get\nangry during your meditation you\nprobably are living with anger under the\nsurface you might have a fuse in some\nsort of way if you have your brain\nbouncing from one place to another to\nanother to another to another to another\nto another which I have had in so many\nmeditations what you're realizing is\nthat your brain is like that your brain\nis like that all day long and you're not\ntrying to resist it you're not trying to\nfight it you're not trying to wrestle\nthat brain down you're just allowing it\nto be for a little while and you're\nstarting to become more aware of what's\nbubbling under the surface all day long\nit's just we try to be so busy through\nthroughout the day that we try to run\nfrom it a lot of times what you're\nbasically doing is you're becoming aware\nof your thoughts and you're also\nstarting to train your brain so so two\ndays ago I went out into my by my pool\nand I did some breath work and after the\nbreath work uh that I was doing I was\nyou know laying down uh sorry sitting\ndown on a um like one of whatever the\npool chairs right and I was sitting\nthere and I did my breath work and then\nI was sitting there and I noticed my\nbrain go okay get up\nand I was like nope like I was about to\nget up I was about to open my eyes and I\nwas like no no no I'm just going to make\nmyself stay a little bit longer my mind\nis not the one that's in control here I\nam the one that's in control you might\nbe like well hold on are you your mind\nwell that's a whole deeper discussion we\ncan go into but I noticed my mind want\nto go to the next thing which I do all\nthe time all day long I'm always\nhurrying to the next thing I was like\nhold on we're gonna chill here for a\nminute right I see training your brain\nthe same way that I see training a dog\nright so I've always mention I've\nmentioned bear for so so long now Bear's\nyou know three and a half about to be\nfour years old and when he was a puppy\nhe was my very first puppy I've ever had\nand I had to train him and so you know\nthere is there is negative reinforcement\nthere's positive reinforcement humans\ndogs most animals react better to\npositive reinforcement and so like you\nknow when bear would pee inside and take\nthem outside you pee inside and take him\noutside pee inside and take him outside\nover and over and over again you don't\ndo it here do it outside you don't do it\nhere you do it outside you don't do it\nhere you do it outside and eventually he\ntrains himself by me doing that he\nstarts to understand it I'll say it\nbetter that way right and so your mind's\nthe same your mind you're going to go\nokay I'm going to focus on the breath\nand you go you just focus on the\nbreathing and then two seconds later\nyour mind is off doing something else\nand your brain goes for a little while\nand what do you do you just go hey oh my\nGod three minutes later you notice your\nbrain's somewhere else don't get mad at\nyourself don't guilt yourself don't\nshame yourself just nicely bring your\nback your your mind back to your\nbreathing and then 30 seconds later your\nmind's off talking about something else\nand you notice 5 minutes later you've\nbeen for 5 minutes you've been thinking\nabout something else and not even paying\nattention what do you do you just bring\nyour mind nicely back to the present\nmoment you bring your mind nicely back\nto the present moment to your body to\nthe the way that your skin feels sitting\nfeels the way that the breathing feels\nand it runs off and you bring it back\nand you runs off and you bring it back\nand\neventually your brain starts to actually\ncalm down a little bit and I'm going to\ntell everybody this\nwe need more moments of\nSilence because we are so overstimulated\nand people are becoming so anxious in\nthis world we need more moments of\nSilence it's not being\nunproductive it's\nself-care and that's really important\nlike if you would have told this to Rob\n10 years ago he'd have been like all\nright dude off right but I'm just\ntelling you right now moments of Silence\nare not un being unproductive\nmoments of Silence even if it's just 3\nminutes in between meetings is\nself-care so instead of thinking I'm\nbored start thinking to yourself I'm\nrelaxing I'm relaxing my mind I'm\ntraining my mind I'm relaxing my\nmind same way that you go and you get a\nmassage you're you're relaxing yourself\nit's self-care right meditation silence\nbeing bored for a little while every\nonce in a while is\nself-care and I just want every everyone\nto start to understand that to sit down\nto close your eyes because people are\nalways like well can I go can I do a\nwalking meditation if you want but don't\ncall it meditation right meditation is\nsitting down and closing your eyes and\njust being with yourself because about\n60% of our brain is dedicated to\nvisually looking around in visual\nstimuli right and finding things\nvisually so when you close your eyes\nyour brain doesn't have as much to\ndistract itself with and so all we're\ntrying to do is become aware of our\nthoughts become aware of our mind and\nstart to train oursel to be bit more\ncalm a little bit less anxious a little\nbit less angry and everything's okay and\nit can all exist in your emotional\nregulation there's study after study\nafter study after study that shows that\npeople who meditate are better with\ntheir emotional\nregulation because they know how to be\nwith themselves most people don't know\nhow to be with themselves and they're so\ndistracted nowadays and so really what\nit comes down to is there's no such\nthing as a bad meditation for years I\nthought that I was I had bad meditations\nthere's not it's just more awareness and\nmore awareness and just allowing\nyourself to relax a little bit more it's\nnot boredom it's relaxing it's selfcare\nand so give it a try let me know how you\nthink of it send me a message on\nInstagram let me know how your\nmeditation went if it goes terrible let\nme know if it goes great let me know but\nreally what it's about is finding your\nposition doing some breathing and then\nnot moving a muscle for an extended\nperiod of time and you do it for years\nand years and years and you'll start to\nnotice your self- improve so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode do me a favor please\nshare it on your Instagram stories tag\nme it Rob dial Jr r o b d i a l Jr the\nonly way this podcast grows is from you\nguys sharing it and so I greatly\nappreciate from
