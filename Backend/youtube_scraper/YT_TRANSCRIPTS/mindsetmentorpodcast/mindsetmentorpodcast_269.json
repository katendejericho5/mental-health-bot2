    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto talk to you about why you should stop\nshoting all over yourself let's dive in\nnow I didn't say all over\nyourself I say shoting all over yourself\nuh what I'm going to teach you today is\nsomething that can absolutely change\nyour life if you actually start\nunderstanding it and implementing it\ninto your life it is a way of speaking\nto other people but especially the way\nthat you speak to yourself and about\nyourself so for those of you guys that\nare out there I do a lot of coaching um\nI have something called mindset mental\nUniversity where I actually help people\nwho are you know every single week we\nhave coaching calls I also have\nsomething called business breakthrough I\nteach people how to grow coaching\nbusinesses and one of the things that I\nhear a lot recently and it's been so\nmuch that I'm like I got to talk about\nthis is people using shame and guilt\nwords like shaming themsel and guilting\nthemsel over and over and over again and\nso what is a a shame or guilt word or\nphrase it's something like I should have\ndone this I shouldn't have done that I\nneed to I have to I must all of those\nhave shame in guilt kind of in the\nunderlying tone of them and most people\ndon't realize that they're using those\nwords oh I should my business should be\nfurther along than it is right now\nreally is it no then it shouldn't be\nfurther than it is right now because\notherwise if it was supposed to be\nfurther along then it would be and so\nyou know if something were supposed to\nbe different in this world it would be\nif you were supposed to be further along\nyou would be you have to understand that\nso when people start saying should you\nhave to realize what they're doing is\nthey're actually guilting themsel and\nshaming themsel in some way and so we\nall do this just FYI it's just kind of\nsomething that we all do but if you can\nstart to become aware it you can start\nto change your your patterns you can\nstart to change your words you start to\nchange your phrases in the moment but\nthe one that I hear more than any of the\nother ones is the word should and one\nthing I hear from so many people is\nwhere their lives should be they say\nsomething like oh I should be making\nmore money I'm I'm 35 years old I should\nbe making more money um you know I'm\nabout to turn 40 I should have kids by\nnow uh I'm 5050 years old I should have\nmy life figured out you have to realize\nlike where just think about that for a\nsecond you should be making more money\nyou should have kids by now you should\nhave life figured out where the hell did\nthat come from where did it come from\nbecause what you're doing is you're\ntrying to live up to expectations that\nare clearly not in reality because\nthat's not the way that life is\ncurrently right now so where the hell\ndid that come from where did your should\ncome from have you ever stopped like\ntaken a step back and actually thought\nabout that okay I'm really thinking that\nI should be further along like one of\nthe things that happened with that was a\nreally interesting thing about Lauren\nand I's relationship is we didn't get\nengaged for seven and a half years and\neverybody was like well you should be\nmarried by now you should be engaged by\nnow and I was like who the are you\nto tell me where my relationship should\nbe right so it's like other people's\nexpectations placed on top of our lives\ndoesn't do us any good and then our own\nexpectations placed on top of Our Lives\ndoesn't do us any good as well and so it\nwas really an interesting thing because\nI think Lord and I have a great\nrelationship we just did an episode that\nyou guys can go back and listen to\ntogether and um and we didn't get\nengaged for seven and a half years but\nwe lived together we traveled the world\nmany times we had a whole lot of fun and\nI remember different people in my family\nbeing like well you you've been together\nfor for six years you should be married\nI'm like no I shouldn't be I can do\nwhatever I want it's my life right so\npeople had these expectations I remember\npeople going up to Larn and being like\naren't you aren't you afraid like\nshouldn't you shouldn't you guys be\nmarried by now and like it was really an\ninteresting predicament to see other\npeople's paradigms of what our\nrelationship should be placed on top of\nour\nrelationship and that has nothing to do\nwith us that's other people's\nexpectations that's other people's\nframes thoughts um paradigms fears\nwhatever it might be placed on top of us\nand we have to be very aware of when\nthat's starting to happen other people\nare trying to place their expectations\non top of us and you know when we're\nalso placing expectations on top of\noursel but if you ever stopped and\nactually thought about it before like if\nsomebody else is telling you where you\nshould\nbe is that really your life if you're\nsitting there and you're shaming\nguilting yourself telling yourself well\nI should I should be here by now I\nshould have this figured out have you\never just stopped and thought about that\nlike where did it come from because it\ncame from somewhere it's someone's\nexpectations that were placed on you at\nsome point in time like just stop and\nthink about that not just what am I\nthinking but why am I feeling this way\nwhere did you learn it because it was\nlearned from somewhere you know did you\nlearn it from your parents a lot of our\nshoulds we learn from our parents did\nyou learn it from your siblings did you\nlearn it from school did you learn it\nfrom teachers did you learn it from\nbosses of where you should be and I want\nyou to understand life is hard enough as\nit is you really want to make it harder\non yourself by being an to\nyourself based off of where you think\nthat you should be but you're not\ncurrently there right now because if\nyou're the type of person who's\nlistening to this podcast you're\nprobably somewhat of an overachiever\nsomeone who's trying to improve thems\nand that being said that means that you\nwant to be further along than you\ncurrently are but you're not further\nalong than you currently are so life is\nhard enough as it is do you want to be\nan to yourself because you're\nnot where you quote unquote should be\nbased off of your expectations that were\nplaced on you from other people's\nexpectations early in\nchildhood because this is you shaming\nyourself when you should be your biggest\nfan and so often I hear people that\ntheir struggle in life is not reality\ntheir struggle in life is their own\n mind of saying I'm not far along\nenough yet like their their reality is\nfine they've got food Water Shelter\nclothing they've got a couple people\nthat love them they've got some friends\nthey have a pretty decent life like if\nthey actually take themselves out of it\nit's a pretty decent life majority of\npeople listening you have a pretty\ndecent life it's not terrible it might\nnot be where you want it to be as of yet\nbut it's pretty good but what happens is\nwe get in our heads and we think I'm not\ngood enough I'm not smart enough I\nshould be further along than I currently\nam why do I not have more money why do I\nnot have more success oh my gosh that\ngirl that I graduated with you know 10\nyears ago has has so much more success\nthan I am what the hell am I doing with\nmy life when in reality reality is\npretty damn good the turmoil is in your\nown\nmind and the turmoil is you shaming\nyourself and telling yourself that you\nshould be someone else when in reality\nyou should be the biggest fan that you\nhave you should be the one that's on\nyour side\nso who think about this for a second who\nshould all over you and decided that you\nshould wear their should and make it\nyours and who shs did you take and make\nyours there's so many shs that so many\npeople have like I said there's there's\nthe what you you should be doing when\nyou should be married when you should\nhave kids what you should be doing with\nyour life what you should be doing with\nyour education what you should do for a\njob where did your should come from I\nhad a friend who told me you know his\npar parents are immigrants and he told\nme um everyone in in in my uh\nneighborhood and the way that my parents\nhave viewed basically and raised me my\nentire life was that I would either be a\ndoctor a lawyer or a\nfailure a doctor a lawyer or a failure\nright like just think about that for a\nsecond like that's somebody else's\nshould so where did your should come\nfrom you should be in a relationship by\nnow who gave you that should who should\nall over you if you were supposed to be\nin a relationship by now guess what you\nwould\nbe you would be but you're not oh you\nshould be married by now okay who gave\nyou that should who should on you if you\nwere supposed to be married by now guess\nwhat you would be oh you should be a\ndoctor you should be a lawyer you should\nbe an\nengineer really who gave you that should\nwho should on you if you were supposed\nto be a doctor or a lawyer or an\nengineer guess what you would be you\nshould make a certain amount of money\nyou should live in a certain certain\npart of town you should call your mother\na certain amount of times per day per\nweek you should just take everyone\nelse's expectation put them on top of\nyourself who gave you those\nshoulds you should have a house you\nshould have kids you should be saving\nyou should be taking the safe route you\nshould go to school you should believe\nwhat your parents believe you should go\nto church you should be happier you\nshould follow everyone to do and what\neveryone else does you should have a\nbigger house right there's so many\nshoulds and all too often people don't\ntake themself out of their own heads\nlook at reality and be\nlike reality is pretty nice it's not\nterrible for the majority of people\nlistening you have food Water Shelter\nclothing you have the internet you can\nlisten this podast\nyou got some pretty decent things going\non there's a lot of things to be\ngrateful for and when you take yourself\nout of your own head and you look in the\nexternal you're like hey it's pretty\nit's pretty all right man like I have a\nlot of things that I should be grateful\nfor but then when you get in your own\nhead and you're thinking I should be\nthis I should be that I should be this I\nshould be that well my mom doesn't AC me\nif I don't if I don't act this way my\ndad doesn't accept me if I don't do this\nand my sister and my my aunts and\neveryone just places expectations on top\nof other people\nand Nobody Does it just FYI Nobody Does\nit to to be rude or to be an to\nyou it's just a lot of other people's\nfears what they do is they project them\nonto you as\nexpectations but don't take other\npeople's expectations and make them\ntheir own like make them your own you\nknow there's we also have on top of that\nsocial and societal\nconstructs of what you should do what\nyou shouldn't do based off of who you\nare based off of your age based off of\nyour skin color based off your gender\nbased off your sexual preference there's\njust so many shoulds and what we're\ndoing is we're taking ourselves in our\nour free being that we could be anything\nand this infinite creator that we could\npossibly be and we're putting oursel in\nour a box unconsciously and trying to be\nwhat other people want us to be being a\npeople pleaser sometimes but the real\nquestion you should ask yourself that\nnot many people asks is what do you want\nlike what do you truly want what do you\nwant to be what do you want your\nrelationships to look like what do you\nwant your bank account to look like what\ndo you want your life to look like what\ndo you want your body to look like what\ndo you want your mindset to look like\nlike what do you want it's crazy how\noften I'll talk to somebody and they'll\ntell me all of their their and I'll\nsay well what do you want and they're\nlike well\nI I and I'm like what do you want and\nwhat they usually do is they can't come\nup with what they want but then they\nstart telling me about other people's\nexpectation what their their family want\nwell my mom thinks this and my dad\nthinks this and you know if you know\nwhere I come from then then this thing\nand what happens is people have never\nreally taken a step\nback and being like what what do I want\nwith my life what do you want if it\nisn't hurting anyone else and it feels\nlike your true authentic self you should\ndo what you want to do that's my should\nI'm going to give you you should do what\nyou want to do is it selfish no it's\nself-preservation\nwhich I don't think people talk about\nbecause that seems like a lot of people\nthat I talk to the people around them\nare trying to make them what they want\nthem to be they want them to live up to\ntheir standards and their expectations\nThat's not\nhealthy I'm going to tell you this\nbecause no one else will really tell you\nhonestly I don't give a about what\nyour mom thinks about your life or your\ndad or your family or Society or where\nyou should be I I don't care about how\nmuch money you have I don't care if\nyou're married I don't care if you're\nsingle I don't care if you're divorced\nif you're religious if you're not\nreligious what you do and what you don't\ndo the only thing I care about with\npeople that I sit down and talk to is\nwhat do you want to do and are you doing\nit you know when you look at the number\none regret of people who are on their\ndeathbed the number one regret of people\nwho are on their deathbed is that I wish\nI lived a life that was true to myself\nand not the life that others expected of\nme I wish I lived a life that was true\nto myself and not the life that other\npeople expected of me you know I think\nthat as Tony Robbins says success leaves\nClues I also think that quote unquote\nfailure leaves Clues regret leaves Clues\nand so when you look at people who are\non their deathbeds and you see like if\nyou want to if you want to be a\nbillionaire would don't you want to\nlearn from someone who is a billionaire\nif you want to be a millionaire why you\nwant to learn from someone who's being a\nmillionaire if you want a incredible\nrelationship with your spouse wouldn't\nyou want to learn from someone who's got\nan incredible relationship with her\nspouse if you want to be an incredible\nparent wouldn't you want to learn from\nsomeone who's an incredible parent\nabsolutely but if you want to have an\nincredible life wouldn't you also want\nto learn from people who are at the end\nof their lives and said this got in the\nway of me making my life incredible yeah\nof course and the number one regret of\npeople who are on their Death Beds is\nthat I wish I lived a life that was true\nto myself and not the life that other\npeople expected of\nme and so there's all of these shoulds\nand there's all these expectations that\nother people place on us which is fine\nbut we have to be adults at some point\nin time and we have to say I'm not going\nto blame anybody else anymore I'm not\ngoing to say it's my mom's fault it's my\ndad's fault because I was raised this\nway and they put their expectations on\nme and this is my what what I'm supposed\nto do and we have to say you know what\nI'm an adult I'm 30 years old I'm 40\nyears old I'm 40 52 years old however\nold you are and you're going to say you\nknow what I'm going to I'm going to take\nall of these shs that I'm placing on top\nof myself that have never been mine in\nthe first place but I just started\nregurgitating thems regurgitating them\nto myself I'm going to stop shoting all\nover myself you know what I'm going to\ndo I'm going to stop living my life for\nother people and start living it for\nmyself because when I do live it for\nmyself I'm not saying if you have\nchildren like just leave them on the\nside of the road obviously what I'm\nsaying is when you start living a life\nthat's true to yourself when you start\nbecoming in more alignment with who you\nare when you start following your\npassion you become a better person to be\naround you become a better parent you\nbecome a better spouse you become a\nbetter brother sister whatever it is\nthat you might be so when are you going\nto follow what you truly want to do and\nrealize that where you are is where you\nare if you say I should be somewhere\nelse no you shouldn't cuz if you were\nsupposed to be there you would be there\nreality is what reality is stop\nresisting it so much accept it you can\nmake changes to it but in this moment\nright now\nit is what it is but when are you going\nto follow your passion when are you\ngoing to find out what it is that you\ntruly want when are you going to accept\nwhere you currently are and stop\nthinking that you should be somewhere\nelse or further along or trying to live\nup to someone else's expectations if\nyou're listening this you're old enough\nto understand this is your life if other\npeople don't like what you're doing but\nyou're not hurting other people but\nyou're in full alignment with who you're\nsupposed to be then it is none of their\ndamn\nbusiness\nso when are you going to start following\nyour passion when are you going to\naccept where you currently are and stop\nthinking that you should be somewhere\nelse or further along and start actually\nliving the life that you truly want what\ndo you want what is it okay stop shoting\non yourself and start following that\nthing so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease do me a favor share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in at robd\nJr orb d i a
