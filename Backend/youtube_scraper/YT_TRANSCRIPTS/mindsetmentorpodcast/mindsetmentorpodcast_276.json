    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to create\na better day every single day let's dive\nin today is very simple it is not rocket\nscience it is not something that's going\nto blow your mind and as you hear it\nyou're going to go yeah that makes sense\n yeah I knew that oh yeah damn I\nknew that as well but then really the\nquestion comes back to are you actually\ndoing it sometimes we have to hear\nsomething a hundred times or 4,000 times\nbefore we actually do it so today I'm\njust going to talk about three ways to\ncreate a better day and let me say this\nbefore we dive in we all want to feel\ngood we do like that that's really what\nit comes down to I want to feel good and\nI want to feel good every day and I\nwould like to feel good as much of the\nday as I possibly can you know we all\nwant to feel good we all want happiness\nwe all want success we all want love and\njoy and peace and money and travel we\nwant to do some cool all of that\nbut more than anything else I think we\njust want to feel good even if you don't\nhave a million dollars in your bank\naccount and you haven't traveled the\nworld if you're sitting on your couch\nand just sitting there and you feel good\nlike hey I don't need anything right now\nthat's an amazing moment and we all want\nmore of those amazing moments and we\nthink that different things are going to\nmake us feel good we think that money is\ngoing to make us feel good we think that\nachieving things things are going to\nmake us feel good we think that sex is\ngoing to make us feel good that alcohol\nis going to make us feel good and you\nknow whatever it might be for you we've\nall got our different flavor of trying\nto find that thing that's going to make\nus feel good but a lot of us go in\nsearch of those things that are going to\nmake us feel good and we we search for\nit we try to get it and we get there and\nwe realize damn it I still don't feel\ngood and they usually don't make us feel\ngood so the goal of my life\nand I've been doing this for about two\nyears and I've been having to trying to\nput myself and think this way and give\nmyself this perspective the goal of my\nlife is to try to be more and more like\na dog every single day that's it's that\nsimple right dogs are just happy they're\njust happy no matter what most of the\ntime right they love you no matter what\nwhen I come home it is the greatest\nmoment of my dog's life every single\ntime I just want to feel the way that my\ndog feels when I come home as much as I\npossibly can and I have come to realize\nby you know about to be 38 years old\nthat going in in becoming a successful\nis not going to make me feel that way\nmaking money is not going to feel that\nway uh going out in and having sex is\nnot going to make me feel that way doing\ndrugs is not going to make me feel that\nway alcohol is not g to make me feel\nthat way none of those things are going\nto give me that feeling as much as I\npossibly can it might feel like for a\nmoment like oh my God a super success\nand H I hit the top of the mountain and\nnow I'm happy right but then the next\nday it drops again or an hour later it\ndrops again so like when I come home and\nit is the greatest moment of my dog's\nlife I immediately go yeah I want more\nof that in my life I want to feel that\nway right so how can I be more like that\nI know that the money in the\nachievements and buying is not\ngoing to make me feel that way so what\nwill well that's what we're going to\ntalk about today okay the thing I want\nyou to understand is when we feel good\nwe come from a better place when we feel\ngood we come from a better place when\nyou feel good you are a better person\nand when you're a better person you're a\nbetter parent you're a better employee\nyou're a better business owner you're a\nbetter uh brother sister mother whatever\nit is that you might be when you feel\ngood you are a better person when you\nfeel like you are a first person so\nshouldn't we all try to put feeling good\nand being in a place of peace and joy\nlike at the driver seat of the things\nthat we want like we can go and we can\ncreate a morning routine and we can have\n17 different boxes that have to have to\ncheck in order to get there sure and\nI've done it before where I'm like oh\nI've heard that morning routines make me\nfeel better let me put 47 different\nthings that I have to do in my morning\nroutine and then I just feel like it's\nanother freaking checklist and then my\nmorning routine actually start to dread\nand so for me instead of saying hey I'm\ngoing to do 47 things in the morning in\norder to optimize my day I've been\ntrying to simplify my life I've been\ntrying to go the whole route of less is\nmore and what I'm going to teach you as\nI said is so simple it's so simple but\nare you doing it we live in a really\nfast-paced world that's go go go go go\nyou can't stay that break next speed\nforever and this right here what I'm\ngoing to talk about today is a step back\nfor everyone to step back you have to\nlearn if you haven't already that you\nhave to prioritize\nyourself you do all of the stuff we're\ngoing to talk about today will lower\nyour stress it's going to lower your\nanxiety and it's and focusing on just\nlittle tiny incremental small\nimprovements every single day will\ncompound to massive shifts over time\nthis is really easy to do which means\nthat it's also really easy not to do and\nso each day the three things the three\nbuckets that I have to fill before I go\nout and try to do something in the world\nis I have to do something for my mind I\nhave to do something for my body I have\nto do something for my soul now some of\nyou are going well yeah of course I\nknew that right like we Mind Body Soul\nlike I've heard about that that sounds\nlike something that would be on a wall\nyou know at some Farmhouse and love your\nmind and body and soul yeah I get it but\nthen the question is like are you really\nwaking up with the intention of doing\nsomething for your mind and waking up\nthe intention of doing something for\nyour soul and waking up the intention of\ndoing something for your body every sing\nsingle day oh probably not so each day\nwe should be doing something preferably\nin the morning for our mind our body and\nour soul and that's it everything else\nin life seems to work its way out right\nor it becomes easier to deal with\nespecially for me when I have filled my\ncup first you have to fill your cup\nfirst so that you could pour into others\nthroughout your day so let's talk about\nit your mind what would it look like to\nfill your cup for your mind I'm going to\ngive you some examples but for you like\nwhat does it mean for you what do you\nwant to do when you wake up in the\nmorning if you want to you could have 17\nthings that you need to do on your\nmorning checklist and your morning\nroutine or you could just have three\nsomething for my mind something for my\nbody something for my soul right so mind\nyou can read you can Journal you can\nlearn a new language you can learn a new\nword and use that multiple times a day\nright so for me when I wake up I used to\nsay oh I I have to read I have to\njournal I have to meditate I have to do\nthese things no if like I'm trying to\nfill my bucket some days I wake up and\nI'm like you know what I just really\nfeel like reading I feel like reading\ntoday and then some days I wake up and\nI'm like I don't feel like reading today\nand so guess what I don't do I don't\nfreaking force myself to read what do I\ndo I just decide you know what I'm going\nto journal today or you know what I'm\ngonna learn a new language or I'm gonna\ntake 30 minutes and I'm going to work on\nlearning an instrument like I play\nguitar so some days I'm like you know\nwhat I'm going to do something for my\nmind and I know that chall chenging my\nmind is done through learning guitar\nscales so I'll take a metronome and I'll\ntry to learn a guitar scale and I'll go\na little bit faster I'll go a little bit\nfaster and I'll go a little bit faster\nright if you play piano you can learn\nsome jazz chords you could challenge\nyourself just a little bit and just\ncontinue keep challenging yourself it\ncould be painting in the morning if you\nwanted to it could be doing a puzzle it\ncould be Sudoku it could be practicing\ngratitude it could be finding different\nbrain games right it really what it\ncomes down to is how can you how can you\nhave a list of things that you enjoy\ndoing for your mind or that are\nintriguing to you like maybe you're like\nyou know what I really do want to learn\na new language but I haven't put time\ninto it maybe that's on the list and\nmaybe you wake up tomorrow and you're\nlike I actually do want to learn a\nlittle bit more Spanish so I'm going to\ntake 15 minutes and try to learn some\nSpanish because when you're growing\nyou're either green and growing and or\nbrown and dying and when you feel like\nyou're growing you feel more excited you\nfeel better and so I would recommend\ntrying to do something for your mind\nevery single day make a list of all the\nthings you could do for your mind and\nthen just choose in the morning based\noff of how you feel don't force yourself\nto do any of these things okay and and\none thing I'll give you too is like try\nto stay away from some screens like I've\nconsciously been removing screen time\nfor my life like removing Instagram\nremoving being on anything Reddit\nFacebook all of those watching less TV\nwatching being on my computer\nless the real world is not on the\nscreen the real world is around you and\nyou're missing it every moment that\nyou're on screen and so if you want to\ndo something better for your mind as\nwell be on your phone less be on less\nscreen time okay so that's the first\nthing is your mind the second thing is\nyour\nbody right your body I'm going to try to\nhelp you shift your your mindset around\nyour body real quick okay start treating\nyour body like it is someone else that\nyou are in charge of taking care of\nsomeone else is you're in charge like if\nyou have children and they're you have a\ntwo-year-old right you are in charge of\ntaking care of that child and it is your\nduty and you want to create the best\nhuman that you possibly can why don't\nyou treat yourself the exact same way\ntreat your body the exact same way if\nthis is the task that you were given\nfrom the moment you were born was to\ntake care of this body treat your body\nlike someone else that you're in charge\nof taking care of right if you have a\ndog right you want to take care of your\ndog you want to give your dog the best\nand you like I said like I treat my dog\nprobably better than any person I've\never met I'm just going to be honest\nright and then you go well do I treat\nmyself as good as I treat my dog right\njust treat your body the same way that\nyou would if you were in charge of\ntaking care of somebody right your body\nwants to move and we are so stagnant\nnowadays like your body wants to move\nyour body was designed to move if you go\nback 100,000 years our ancestors weren't\njust sitting eight hours a day and\nthere's been a lot of uh studies and I\nactually researched a few things\nresearchers analyzed different uh 13\ndifferent studies of people that were\nsitting and their sitting time and their\nactivity levels and all that and they\nfound out that those who sat more than\neight hours a day with no physical\nactivity had a risk of dying that was\nequivalent to those that had obesity or\nsmoked every single day so sitting being\nstagnant not moving this body of yours\nthis physical body that you're in charge\nof taking care of is the equivalent of\nbasically smoking is the equivalent to\nbeing obese so give yourself 30 minutes\nof movement every day and so you can say\nto yourself oh I have to work out I have\nto lift every single day and I have to\nand you have to go force and force and\nforce you could just say you know what\nI'm gon to have a list of things I could\nwork out I could do you know Primal\nmovements animal flow I could do yoga I\ncould do stretching I could do hiking I\ncould do 10,000 steps I could walk two\nmiles around my you know my neighborhood\nwith no\nphone I could do 30 minutes of just like\nclosing my eyes one thing I've been\ndoing recently is I will I'll put on my\nnoise cancelling headphones I'll put on\na 45 minute like meditation song and\nI'll just do deep intentional movements\nlike I I just it it's like sometimes I'm\nlike my body wants to move in weird ways\nand I'm like screw it I'm just going to\ngo in my garage and I'm just going to\nmove my body and I just get out all the\nlittle kinks that are there right it\ncould be breathing that you need to do\nand doing breath work right you know\nthere so much stress nowadays breath\nwork helps so much it could be meal prep\nfor the day so you don't get off track\nit could be making sure that you have a\ng gallon of water so that you can stay\nhydrated so many people are just so\ndehydrated so it's not about forcing\nyourself to have to do certain things\nevery single day it's like saying hey I\nhave a list of things I could do for my\nmind which one do I want to do today I\nhave a list of things I want to do for\nmy body which one do I feel like doing\ntoday and then you have your soul and so\nwhat does it mean to you like the the\nperson that's inhabiting that body of\nyours you know it might be meditation\nwhere you just meditate it might be\nprayer for some of you it might be\nspending time in nature like just going\nout and and being in nature it might be\nsitting in Silence with no plan like\nyesterday I had a gap of about uh about\n20 minutes in between calls and it was a\nbeautiful day outside and I was like you\nknow what I'm going to go sit outside in\nthe grass with my dog and I just sat\noutside in the grass just doing nothing\nfor 20 minutes you know how rare that\nhas been for me over my life just\nlike just some\nrelaxation it could be sitting down and\nhaving some gratitude it could be\nreading spiritual book and then\njournaling on it it could be listening\nto spiritual guides or spiritual leaders\nwhatever it feels right for you and so\nit's like have a list of all these\nthings you could do and then just see\nwhat feels right when you wake up in the\nmorning and don't force yourself to do\nany of them and so you just pick from\nyour list of all of these things that I\ncould do for my mind all of these things\nI could do for my body all these things\nI could do for my soul and then I wake\nup in the morning and I see what I feel\nlike doing you know I'm about to be 38\nlike I said and I have made a lot of my\nlife really hard thinking that I need to\ndo a million things a day and I\nhave to do this and I have to force\nmyself and I have to struggle my way to\nsuccess and I have to do all of these\nthings and I have to make sure I get it\ndone and if I don't get it done then I\nshame myself or guilt myself really what\nit comes down to is how can I do less\nbut get more from everything that I do\nhow can I do less it comes down to how\ncan I set myself up for success and\nreally what I think it comes down to is\nhow can I fill my cup first you know for\nme I have people around me that I have\nthat I take care of I have employees\nthat work for me I have you know a wife\nand I have things going on in my life\nand if I want to show up better to all\nof them if I want to be a better son if\nI want to be a better husband everything\nif I want to be a better business owner\nI need to fill my cup first I need to do\nsomething for my mind my body and my\nsoul and I need to do from a place of I\ndon't need to do anything let me take\nneed out of it but I want to do\nsomething that fills my cup every single\nday that makes me feel better that that\nis enjoyable and I don't have to feel\nlike I have to force myself to get 17\nthings done 17 different things done\nwithin 90 minutes or else I'm a complete\nfailure in the morning and my morning\nroutine sucked right so some of you guys\nout there are parents you yes it is very\nimportant for you to be a parent it's\nthe most important job you'll ever have\nbut you have to fill your Cup first it\nwill make you a better parent so many of\nyou are trying to pour from an empty cup\nand you can do it for a while you really\ncan but it's going to catch up to you at\nsome point you you will burn out it's\nnot that you're when you're when you\nburn out it's not that you're doing too\nmuch it's that you're doing too little\nof what actually fills you up think\nabout that for a second when you burn\nout it's not that you're doing too much\nand you're all over the place it's that\nyou're doing too little of the things\nthat actually fill you up and once again\nas I said all of this it's not rocket\nscience it's really not but but if it it\nis so easy to do and if it is so easy to\ndo it is also very easy not to do and so\nit requires you to decide to be\nintentional to say you know what I am\ngoing to wake up just a little bit\nearlier and I am going to work on myself\nI am going to be the person who does\nthis I know that when I fill my cup up\nI'm going to be a better person I'm\ngoing to be a better parent and that is\nreally important to me and so it's about\nbeing\nintentional which is just one of the\nthings that a lot of people are really\nlacking nowadays intentionality be more\nintentional about what fills you up and\nI promise you you will have a much\nbetter day every single day so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode and you don't\nwant to miss another episode of this do\nme a favor subscribe to it so you never\nmiss it again and with that I'm going to\nleave you the same way I leave you every\nsingle episode make it your mission to\nmake somebody else's day better I\nappreciate you and I hope that you have\nan amazing day"
