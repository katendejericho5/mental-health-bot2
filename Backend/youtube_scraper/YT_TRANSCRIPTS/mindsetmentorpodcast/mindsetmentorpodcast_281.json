today's episode and so\nLauren welcome to the podcast thanks I'm\nexcited to be here and do this I'm\nexcited to have you here um let's talk\nabout the question that everybody always\nasks us which is how we met and so\nLauren how did we meet we met on a wine\ntour M which is perfect because we love\nwine mhm and um we met the mutual\nfriends mhm I don't was it somebody's\nbirthday yeah it was our friend Teresa's\nbirthday okay so it was a\nbirthday to like a a party bus situation\nthat I was actually late for but I came\nwith a girlfriend we met up with all of\nyou guys and I uh yeah I was running\nlate that day which is why I didn't make\nit to the party bus on time M and I was\nhungry and I like plot myself down\neating like all of the like meats and\ncheeses that I could find and then\nthat's when you walk walked up yeah and\nthen uh my friend who I walked up with\nNathan at the time asked for some meat\nthat you had and so you started sharing\nyour meat and cheeses with us yes and um\nand we uh we didn't exchange numbers\nafter the party we ended up going our\nseparate ways and I was texting our\nmutual friend and saying hey you guys\ncould show we're at some bars downtown\nthis is when I used to party right we're\ndown on Sixth Street we're actually on\ndirty 6 if you've ever been to Austin\nand I was like come to this bar and then\n20 minutes after we left magically you\nguys would be at that so you guys never\nactually met with us we just kept\nmissing you kept missing us minutes yeah\nand then um and then we ended up going\nto a uh it was me you and our friend\nAllan yeah um ended up going about a\nweek later to to brunch and we went to\nbrunch and uh we had a really good day\nwe went to a bar we were all watching\nfootball and we were playing uh you know\ngiant Jinga and then you\nleft me and Allan because you had\nanother day to go on with another guy I\ndid but to be fair I wasn't on a date\nwith you I wasn't I mean I was going to\nbrunch with you and Allen uhhuh and yeah\nI had had another I mean that was like a\nlast minute thing too it's not like\nwe're going to meet this weekend and\nwe're going to go to branch and then I\nwas like okay cool so I'll plan my\nsecond date of the day for later no like\nit I just happened to already I had been\ntalking to somebody else for a little\nbit and had a date planned with him that\nnight so uh my wife left me to go on\nanother date is what we're saying when\nyou say it like that now it's it sounds\ncrazy but it really wasn't um but was\nreally interesting about the whole thing\nis uh I uh I turned to my friend at the\ntime and I was like don't worry he's\ngoing to [ __ ] it up and that night guy\n[ __ ] it up he got too drunk he started\nyelling getting belligerent and you were\nlike I'm not dealing with this I was out\nyeah you were out uh pretty much\nimmediately which was awesome so um and\nthen what happened was we didn't have\neach other's numbers and uh you got my\nnumber from a mutual friend of ours and\nyou just text me out of nowhere and um\nand you were like hey what are you doing\nthis weekend and um so you hit me up and\nthen we didn't meet up and I kept trying\nto basically say like hey do you want to\ngo on a date you want to go like keep\nkeep trying to to do it and then the\nfollowup was strong the followup was\nstrong and then you just kept basically\nghosting me yeah well I also lived in a\ndifferent city so at the time I was\nliving in San Antonio and you were here\nin Austin so\num yeah I don't know I was like at a\npoint in time where I was really into\njust like living my life single MH I\nwasn't really looking for a\nrelationship and it wasn't that I was\nlike actively trying to ghost you it\njust kind of kept falling off my radar\nyeah than sorry I was like he's so sweet\noh my God I'm going to get back to him\nlater and then I just didn't yeah so um\nso uh the thing about it is I was always\nin sales and so I always knew from from\nbeing in sales you just keep following\nup until somebody says no so you had\nnever said no to me and I was like all\nright well she kind of she got my number\nshe was kind of she was interested I\nguess I'm going to keep following up I\nthink this chick's awesome I think she's\nreally beautiful and I was like I'm\ngoing to just keep following up until\nshe says no and she never said no and\neventually we went on a date and uh that\nwas July I'm sorry that was January 11th\nof 2014 so we've been together for 10\nyears now and um you were like your your\nkind of your intention was I'm going to\ngo on it because you had been single for\na while I'm going to go on a date with\nthis guy and it's probably going to\nprove that I I don't like this guy like\nhe's great he's good but I just don't\nwant to date right now I didn't have\nanything to lose so I figured like let's\njust go for it yeah so we wanted a date\nand what happened I liked you and then a\nlot and then you left the next day I\nleft the next day for 6 weeks to go\ntraining for a company I was with so\nthen Lauren liked me and I liked her and\nthen the very next day I I left to go to\nTampa for training for a company that I\nworked with back then uh for 6 weeks\nwhich was perfect okay because we did\nthe old school like talking on the phone\nfor hours sounds super corny and it's\nnot something I'm into by any means I\ndon't actually like talking to people on\nthe phone um so it was like the little\nritual like I would get off work and\nthen we'd talk to each other I think you\nwere watching like Dexter or something\nat that point and you would like watch\nbreak B I was watching break okay and\nyou would tell me about it and we would\njust talk and talk and like all the\nlittle giggly cute and you time and I\nwas 27 yeah MH so we got to know each\nother really well because all we did was\ntalk for like the first six weeks MH and\nso I think that was actually huge\nBecause by the time we saw each other\nfor our like technically second date\nyeah I remember being so nervous because\nI like knew you and I really cared like\nI had a lot invested a lot of time\ninvested in like getting to know you and\nso I liked you and then seeing you again\nin person was like oh my God he's\nactually here yeah but it was fun yeah\nso and we came into the relationship as\ntwo completely flawed individuals with\ntwo completely different perspectives of\nlife and ways that we were triggered you\nknow I was 27 she was 25 and so we still\nto this day we will never say that we\nhave anything figured out or anything\nperfected we're going to give our\nperspective of life and love and\nrelationships and you know maybe people\nget some value out of it\num but uh you weren't into personal\ndevelopment at all no and it was\nsomething that I like eat sleep and\nbreathe at that point um and you weren't\nreally into it and um and at that point\nin time what we're going to talk about\nas we go through this episode today\nbesides learning us is we're going to\ntalk about what we've learned about\nourselves and about being in\nrelationship with another person and one\nof the things that that I want to dive\ninto is you at the beginning of the\nrelationship saw a heightened emotional\nstate as a um equaling like interest\nright and so um so walk us through that\nand I'll kind of give my perspective of\nit so with past relationships that you\ncame in you were used to some some\nheightened States some yelling some all\nof that stuff and you equated that with\nlike hey that means passion that means\nthat someone's interested that means\nlove in some sort of way right yeah I\nthink you actually said it really well\num earlier it was kind of like the more\nemotion that came through\nwhich was really kind of like just like\ndrama or passion meant like there was\nsomething you were fighting for and you\nare so chill and very grounded and so I\nwas I was working pretty hard to try to\nget something out of you yeah to show me\nthat I was worth fighting for oh yeah\nyeah or that you cared because that's\nhow I perceived it at the time and I had\nno idea right because I'm like I I\nwasn't very self-aware at that point I\nwas 25 years old just like used to\nwhatever my past relationships had been\nso it was an interesting\nthing getting your response or lack of\nat first because to me it felt like you\ndidn't care yeah yeah and um and for me\nI've just never really seen the reason\nto yell at somebody or to to um to be\nthat way and so I've always just thought\nyou know kind of like the Golden Rule\nlike you treat people how you want to be\ntreated and so but there's also it's we\ncan we're going to talk about in other\nepisodes like it's just very hard to\noffend me um yeah just because of of I\nthink I just have after you know 19\nyears of working myself just a really\ngood idea of who I am and for someone to\nget mad at me is just their perspective\nor you know whatever it might be and um\nwe had one moment I'm curious your\nperspective of it and how it I feel like\nit shifted after one moment specifically\nwhere um I was sober cuz I was driving I\ndon't love this story we don't have to\ntell the whole details but the deta the\nvery\nhigh is that you had been drinking we\nwere at a pool party I was completely\nsober you had come over and said\nsomething to me and you were trying to\nget emotion out of me like you're were\ntrying I said something rude like let's\njust be clear I I want you can say what\nI said if you want to but no it doesn't\nmatter she had said something very rude\nand my response to you is I I looked you\ndead in the eye and your friend Nicole\nwas right there and I said number one\nnobody speaks to me that way and number\ntwo we're going to have a conversation\nabout this later when we leave I was\nlike and um it wasn't and that was\nhaving me having grown up I would have\nthere's many other relationships where I\nwould have just taken what you said and\nbe like there's something wrong with me\nbut I think I just got to the point\nwhere I knew what I wanted I knew how I\nwanted to treat somebody I knew how I\nwanted to be treated and I feel like\neverything shifted after that moment and\nyou really didn't equate okay really\nheightened emotion with actually caring\nor be Worthing you know something to to\nfight for right well because you were\nright and I could clearly see what I did\nwith was wrong and you dealt with it in\na very direct and mature way so there\nwas no like you know oh my God I have to\ndefend what I did oh my gosh like I\ncan't believe he said that to me or\nwhatever it's just like you put me in my\nplace at that point when I needed to be\nput in my place cuz I was being a brat\nand I was being rude and so I was like\noh there's just no room for that m in\nthis relationship and so I respected it\nit made perfect sense yeah and and like\nabout 10 minutes later you actually\nwalked up to me and apologized and so we\ndidn't even have to really go into it\ndeeply we did a little bit in the car\nyeah and so one of the things that we\nwere thinking is how did we come into\nthis relationship and and what do what\nhow do we come in as flawed individuals\nand one of the things that we learned\nand I think that was one of the things\nthat you really learned was that um just\nbecause someone's not yelling or quote\nunquote passionate extremely highight in\nemotions doesn't mean somebody doesn't\ncare right and doesn't mean that\nsomebody doesn't think that you're worth\nfighting for um on the other side me the\nway that I came into the relationship\nship in the way that I had not been good\nin other relationships was I didn't know\nhow to let myself be vulnerable and so I\nthink that you had sensed that there was\na wall up and it was really hard for me\nto like fully open up right yeah and I'm\nsuch like an open book and I give love\nvery quickly\nand freely and you were different yeah\nso I think that as much as my natural\ntendency was to try to just like be\nvulnerable and open up to you I sense\nthat you weren't completely so then I\nkind of started to match that a little\nand it created a little bit of a wall a\nbarrier between us which over time it\ndid do a little bit of a toll on us I\nthink what really helped you know we\nmoved in with each other about a year\nand a half in what really helped me kind\nof understand my um problem with\nvulnerability was I went to a poker\ntournament and in a poker tournament the\nguy who sat next to me was a\nrelationship therapist\nand it was probably about a year and a\nhalf 2 years into our relationship and\nhe's like oh you're girlfriend and you\nshould come in and I was like that\nsounds cool let's just see what this guy\nhas to say yeah and so we went in and um\nI think what was really cool about going\nin in senior relationship therapist was\nthat he kind of made I think I left that\nI remember driving after and being like\nOh my God I feel like I know myself so\nwell and I feel like Lauren knows me so\nwell yeah it definitely helped it it\ndefinitely helped us cuz I felt like we\nwere kind of not seeing each other fully\nand sometimes you know and it's it's not\nlike there's anything wrong with a\nrelationship it was just like we went\ninto of like hey let's try to see how we\ncan improve and understand each other\nbetter and um you know he had\nrecommended a couple books for us one\nthing that I do remember he specifically\nlike hit me really hard was I was\ntelling him about my childhood and I was\ntelling him about my father and you know\nand stuff and he said he said yeah you\nwere neglected as a child and I was like\nno I wasn't like cuz in neglect I'm\nthinking in my mind like I had food I\nreally remember this moment I like saw\nsomething click in you when he said that\nand I was like yeah he and so I was like\nno I wasn't like I everything was fine\nlike I was thinking like neglect means\nlike somebody wasn't there that I wasn't\ntaken care of or you know um that there\nwasn't food or water or any of that\nshelter and and he goes no you were\nemotionally neglected and I was like oh\nyeah that makes sense and he said so you\nguys basically have different um love\nStyles and he he taught us like how our\nnervous systems react to each other and\nhe said Rob if and there's a a book that\nthat there's an audio book that\neverybody can listen to if they want to\nis called wired for love and he had us\nlisten to that the same guy who wrote\nthat also wrote the book attached uh\nyears down the road which he talks about\nattachment Styles and the way that he\ndescribed it is there's three different\nuh ways that someone's nervous system is\nwired for love based off of their\nchildhood and and for you the um the\nphrase was you are an anchor so there's\nan anchor there's an island there's a\nwave an anchor is someone who's like\nvery firmly set you know both your\nparents are still together um and so you\nwere kind of like felt like love was in\nthe household for me I was an island\nwhich which means like I was used to\nbeing alone and um you get used to being\nalone when you're a child and so you\nknow my mom had to work a couple\ndifferent jobs uh my father wasn't\nalways there I was what they call a\nlatch key kid so like I would walk home\nyou know after after school bus and I\nlet myself in at like 9 years old and I\nwas just used to being alone and then W\nof someone who bounces in between Island\nand anchor and um and I remember\nspecifically because you would come in\nand want to give me love like\nimmediately and it didn't feel safe and\nthe reason why it didn't feel safe is\nbecause in the way he explained it is\nthat you need to give Rob's nervous\nsystem time to get used to your nervous\nsystem because he's so used to being\nalone that you can't just fly into a\nroom be like oh my God I'm so glad to\nsee you and and it and um you know\nobviously that's changed a lot over past\n8 years\nbut um for you to understand like his\nnervous system is not accepting yours\nimmediately yeah that was huge for me to\nhear because I I remember still even\nlike hearing him tell us that I couldn't\nunderstand it because it was so I mean I\ncould understand what he was saying but\nto wrap my head around how I needed to\nsupport that was something that took me\na little bit of time because it was so\ndifferent from my own experience yeah\nfor sure and I think that was actually\none thing that really kind of that was\nprobably one of the biggest moments\nfirst in our relationship ship was uh\nwas both of us going yeah we should work\non this thing and try to get better at\nit which I think is um you know putting\nan effort is something that I think a\nlot of people want to see in a\nrelationship and so you know we got the\nAudi book wired for love um we got the\nuh the five love languages we started\nfiguring out Each Other's Love Languages\nso that it wasn't like like one of your\nlove languages is is um a of service\nright and so that's the top one right\nit's your top one so like you she thinks\nour cleaning lady is the most amazing\nperson in the world they've never had a\nconversation she doesn't even speak the\nsame language as her but she loves our\ncleaning lady uh Flora because she does\nacts of service for us right best and so\nfor me like even reading that was like\noh I didn't even realize so like you\nknow the other night you were we've been\nI've been like fresh squeezing orange\njuice right and so like yeah and so like\nyou were in the bathtub and I was like\noh I'm going to give her some orange\njuice and so I made her some orange\njuice and brought it to her cuz that is\nan active service it was great I loved\nthat right and I didn't realize that\nthat is how you feel loved which I think\nis really important when people are in\nrelationships is we tend to to give love\nthe way that we want to be loved but\nit's not always exactly the same and so\nit's kind of like with Love Languages\nthey our languages like you could be\nspeaking a different language than\nsomeone that you're in a relationship\nwith oh yeah it's very common and so um\nI think that's important for people to\nunderstand is I think what you know that\nwhat that was kind of a catalyst kind of\na changing point for us because of the\nfact that we both saw each other putting\nin effort and I think that that made\nboth of us realize oh this person wants\nto be with me they want to work on this\nthey want to get better versus just try\nto keep things the same all the time\nright and then for me too because I\nwasn't really into personal development\nlike I had said before my level of\nawareness was kind of low but I also\nhadn't done a deep enough dive into like\nwell why is Rob the way he is so it\nhelped give me New Perspective because I\nhad a better understanding of you and I\nwanted for you to feel loved and I\nwanted for you to feel safe accepting\nlove so it was also like just a huge aha\nmoment for me to see more of who I was\nwith and how I played an actual like\nvery important role in your life in\nsupporting you because and I wanted to\nsupport you yeah so it became more\nexciting actually I think too to um to\nwork on the relationship yeah and then\num you know about 2 and a half years\ninto our relationship we decided to go\ntravel for 6 months yeah and um you\nended up leaving the com at you were\nwith which was scary as [ __ ] for me\nright which was very scary you had never\nhad a business before I had had\nbusinesses before uh before that and so\nI helped you grow a social media\nmarketing company about 6 months before\nleaving and so I'm curious with with\nstarting the business and also traveling\nwhat do you feel like that did for you\nbut also for the relationship as well so\nhe' been together for about three 3 and\na half years at that point yeah 2002 and\na half 17 2 and a half okay so I um I\nknew it was going to make her break us\nbecause we were kind of at this point\nwhere like we'd been working on things\nbut I mean I'm not going to pretend like\nI was already thinking like Rob is the\nman I'm going to be with for the rest of\nmy life I wasn't sure I was also\nterrified to leave what I at that point\nin time I believed I was leaving my\ncareer and everything I'd worked hard\nfor right to start this thing on my own\nand then also like moving way out of my\ncomfort Zone to travel for 6 months\nwhich I had already done I traveled by\nmyself for 3 months so I was definitely\nweighing I was definitely more in my\ncomfort zone than you were yeah I had\nalready started businesses before I had\nalready traveled for 3 months by myself\nyou had never started a business before\nand you had never traveled for an\nextended amount of time yeah so I was\njust jumping in and also I mean like it\nwas just going to be me and you you and\nI and I didn't know what that was going\nto be like just you and I for six months\naway from home and so I was like this is\neither going to make us or break us by\nthe end of the trip I mean it made us\nbecause the relationship that we came\nback with versus the one we left with\nwas completely different you supported\nme in so many ways from helping me\nbelieve in myself with my business but\nalso like I had breakdowns in like every\nnew city we went to along the way it was\nlike the travel days were always the\nones that got me remember that I would\nhave like a literal breakdown every\ntravel day so we would typically spend\nabout 10 days in any City yeah and it\ngot really hard when we were in Prague\nand I was like I don't know I want to\nleft yeah my family had come to visit us\nwhile we were in um Italy and then we\nleft to go to uh Prague we'd been in\nItaly I think already for like about a\nmonth so I had established some sort of\nlike normaly there but then like kind of\nlike shook everything up again already\nsaw my family for the one time I was\ngoing to see them over the 6 months and\nthen yeah so like you supported me\nthrough all of that and that was just\none of the components that shifted\neverything in our relationship but also\nlike experiencing so many things being\nout of my comfort zone but feeling safe\nwith you that was huge is that I never\nfelt unsafe or like I didn't think that\nyou couldn't take care of us while we\nwere doing it and so coming back with\nyou and the relationship that we had at\nthat point it completely made our\nrelationship yeah I forgot that you had\nso many breakdowns until you just said\nit cuz I'm like I'm like there were so\nmany\nuh there was the first day when we were\nin New York and we stayed in New York\nfor a couple days and then we were about\nto leave to sleep night CRI yourself to\nsleep that night cuz you missed Toby so\nmuch yeah I was like Toby's going to\nthink I abandoned him and I literally\ndid for six months right you didn't AB\njust went on a trip so that was a long\none right right right you did have a\nbreakdown in prag I remember you had a\nbreakdown we went to Croatia there was\nmultiple breakdowns was like heat and\ndeu to break down to we very tired we\nalmost missed our flight and so um\nyeah I didn't even think about that is\nis I think that I think that the main\nthing that you probably saw is like\nsupport and not being like you're\nridiculous get out of here and yelling\nat you for another breakdown after\nanother breakdown every 10 days after we\nwe'd be on another trip somewhere you\nwere a very\ngrounded solid constant for meh among\nall of the like chaos that was going on\nin my mind and like around me I felt\nyeah and so then and and it was it was\ngood because we were together for six\nmonths and we had like no fights we had\nno no nothing went crazy I mean we were\non this trip where we were just staying\nin the tightest closest Little smallest\nplaces all the time working together day\nyeah we I don't think there was a single\nday actually throughout that entire trip\nthat we weren't together so no there\nwasn't and that's pretty wild when you\nthink about a couple being together mhm\nonly with one another for 6 months\nstraight yeah and I didn't feel like I\nlike so we came back around Christmas\nyou went to Florida and I went to San\nAntonio and I legitimately missed you\nmhm after I'd been with you for 6 months\nstraight like that that means something\nyeah yeah so that was another big thing\nthat changed for us and then um what\nalso I think changed and we're just\ngoing through different parts of our\nrelationship and how it's changed and\nhow we've changed through it um was both\nof us doing psychedelics separately um\nand so I went and did psychedelics uh\nbefore you had ever done psychedelics\nand so I'm curious I'll give you my\nperspective of you and and I want to\nhear your perspective of me and then\nalso tell you what I changed I feel like\nchanged within me so when I went and did\npsychedelics um what do you feel like\nthe shift was within me what dides you\nnotice um well there were some key\nthings but your self-awareness went up a\nlot mhm you also became more conscious\nof like your sense of control or your\nfalse sense of the control yeah that you\nreally wanted to have but just you know\nlike all of us don't\nhave um and I think you\nalso as psychedelics will do bring you\nin touch with your true self and there's\na much more loving side of you that\nexisted that you just hadn't really\nallowed to like emerge or show up as\nmuch and so that was one of the big\nshifts in helping you get closer to that\ntrue loving version of you and it's I\nmean since then obviously there's been a\nlot between then and now but that was\none of the first big shifts I think I\nreally noticed in you which was amazing\nbecause\nI love to give love and obviously I love\nto receive it\nand it was coming through much more at\nthat point after the psychedelics yeah\nyeah I would say that um probably a\nthing that psychedelics and I don't\nrecommend it for everybody but for\npeople who are Further Along on their\nJourney it can help and I think that\nwhat it did for me was it allowed me to\nkind of see past this false identity I\nhad created for myself and kind of be\nlike oh I'm not that person I'm this you\nknow I I remember thinking like what\nhappened to that like sweet little boy\nthat like used to pick flowers for his\nmom like where'd he go you know he's\nbecoming he's become so like so uh rigid\nand harsh and Brash and and that's not\nmy true self that's my conditioned self\nso how do I get back to like who I truly\nam yeah and so um and yeah my my sense\nof control changed completely because it\nthe you know it was really the first\nnight was really really hard because I\ntried to control it and it got so bad\nand I was like why was it so bad and it\nwas like it you know the messages that I\ngot was it was so bad because you try to\ncontrol everything and you're going to\nruin every relationship that you have if\nyou try to control everything and uh the\nreason why is because people bring\nvariables and you just have to be okay\nwith the unknown yeah and I was like oh\nit all starts to make sense and so it's\nnot about just doing the psychedelics\nbut it's also about the integration of\nwhatever you learn into your real life\nand that's actually what kind of started\nand then so you know I had I had worked\non myself and and put a whole lot of\nwork on myself and I slowly started to\nfeel like my\nfalse constricted really tight I got a\njust like White Knuckle my way through\nlife started to kind of slowly dissolve\nand still slowly dissolving you know\nseven years later um but you went and\ndid it uh years after the first time I\ndid it a couple years after the first\ntime I did it and what was really\ninteresting about our relationship is\nyou at this point still had never been\ninto self-development yeah and so it\ntook you it took you 5 years into our\nrelationship before even started\nthinking about it so for people that are\nout there that that always send me\nmessages and they're like well my spouse\ndoesn't like to read and they don't like\nto go to conferences well my girlfriend\ndidn't for the first 5 years of our\nrelationship and I have been obsessed\nwith trying to improve myself for you\nknow you started in getting into it 13\nyears after I did right so it was like a\nlong time and um my whole thing was just\nlike hey maybe it's something that I'm\ninto and and I can just accept that it's\nnot something that she's into and that's\nwhere I got to IID bought you books I\nhad said hey let's go to conferences\nlet's do these things let's hire coaches\nand you're like no I'm good because\nyou're original perspective on\nself-development was what I thought\nbecause especially like what I'd seen\nwith you I knew your past\nand I mean of course you would throw up\nlike that uh Tony Robbins I'm not your\nGuru and I would watch it and I'd be\nlike wow these people have gone through\nsuch intense traumatic situations and\nyou lost your dad and he was you know to\nalcoholism and I mean I looked back on\nmy\nown you know life and childhood and it\nwas just great there's like no big\ntraumatic events nothing really terrible\nthat happened so I believed that perfect\nbut it wasn't it was trauma fil right\nbut you know of course when I hear other\npeople's stories and hearing story I\nthought oh my God these people have this\nlike major stuff that they had to go\nthrough no wonder they're into personal\ndevelopment CU they need to heal that\nbut I I don't have\nanything y don't have anything wrong\nwith me I didn't think I was perfect but\nI just didn't think that um I don't know\nit's almost like I didn't think I\nqualified for it or something right so\nthen um the universe rocks you as the\nuniverse does um and uh you had a friend\nand her her two daughters pass away\nright and um it was interesting because\nwhen I had come back from doing\npsychedelics it was you and three of\nyour friends were sitting outside that\nweek and like asking me all of these\nquestions and like oh my God you seem so\npeaceful it seems like you've gotten so\nmuch from it then you know the things\nhappen happened with one of your friends\nand her two daughters and then all four\nof you decided to go do it do\npsychedelics and I'm curious how that\nshifted your perspective of you of life\nbut also of love in general yeah well\nthere was just I mean it was a lot at\nonce um because I lost my friend Nicole\nand her two daughters in January MH and\nby March we went on our trip to Costa\nRica and\num you know there's a lot that happens\nand a lot that you think about when you\nlose somebody M that you're close to and\nso it made me ask a whole bunch of\nquestions and think things through\ncompletely differently and then going\ninto doing psychedelics like literally\njust flipped everything on its head and\nI became so much more aware of myself\nand also completely opened me up to\nspirituality in a new way and so it was\nlike holy [ __ ] I came back from that\nfully seeing okay there's a lot that I\nneed to work through there's a lot that\nI did work through but I need to\nintegrate it now and um there's this\nwhole other\nrealm like Dimension there's so much\nmore beyond what is here in front of me\nwhich I think that in itself too was\njust like oh my God like energy and and\njust everything made so much more sense\nbecause I learned about it while I was\nthere but I experienced it and so that I\nthink was the biggest shift for me to\nstep into personal development yeah yeah\nand then so then you it was crazy like\nyou just decided to start getting into\npersonal development so you started\nreading books and learning about\nyourself and you know getting a\ncertification in heart math and you got\nall of these different things that you\nstarted doing and um and so it shifted a\nlot for you and that was I think a big\nchange for both of us and I think that\none of the biggest pieces to cuz you\nknow a lot of people say like there's\ntwo different sides either relationships\nare supposed to be hard or relationships\nare supposed to be easy and I don't\nthink that it's either one but I do\nthink that it becomes easier if both\npeople are working on themselves I think\nthat our relationship became a whole lot\neasier when it was me working on\nbecoming the best version of myself and\nyou working on the best version of\nyourself and us realizing that if we\nwere triggered it was not the other\nperson's fault it was just something\nthat happened and we became triggered\nwhich is our fault versus blaming it on\nthe other person I'm just glad you\nwaited for me to get into this cuz if I\nwas you I might have been like ah you\nknow you do your thing you be on your\npath but it it is challenging so I\nunderstand when there's people that come\nwith the question of you know what do I\ndo if my partner isn't into this because\nyou start to notice the things that are\nholding you back and you could see it\nmaybe you know what's happening for them\nand you want to help them but you can't\nmake anybody do anything but it you know\neverybody comes around obviously I am an\nexample when the time is right and you\nyou know you just have to trust that\nit's going to happen exactly as it's\nsupposed to you can't force it and you\nwouldn't want to because then it\nwouldn't be authentic and the only\nreason why it becomes\neasier when both people are working on\nthemselves is because both people wanted\nto yeah yeah and I I think that's a big\nkey point and that's really what people\nare looking for when they start getting\ninto self-development is I'm starting to\nwork on myself it'd be really nice if my\npartner put in the same amount of effort\nfor themsel because I think our\nrelationship would be better but um and\nI'll tell you you know when we when we\nget into it in just a second of like why\nwe each decided to be with each other\nwhy I decided to to stay because that's\na piece of it and we'll talk about that\nat the end but um you know there were so\nmany benefits of being in the\nrelationship anyways and so many\nbenefits of you that I was like okay\nmaybe this is just my thing like some\npeople are into golf and some people are\nnot I was like maybe this is just my\nthing that I'm into is just improving\nmyself and yeah I did have a a little\nbit more turmoil in my my childhood than\nyou did so maybe that's just the way\nthat it goes and um and I do think that\nour relationship got a lot better after\nwe both just went well I'm going to work\non myself and I'm going to be dedicated\nto this thing yeah um another thing I\nthink that was really big in our\nrelationship that's been very different\nthan everybody else's is we never ever\nreally cared about other people's\ntimelines and so you know everybody else\nhas these these different timelines of\noh yeah you've been together for a\ncouple years now it's time to get\nengaged and so we never really gave a\n[ __ ] about that we always were just kind\nof like Hey we're having a great time\nwe're traveling you know we were going\non long trips every single year\nbasically we both worked from home we\nspent I mean at this point in time we've\nprobably spent more time physical time\nin each other's presence than a couple\nthat's been together married for 50\nyears cuz we're together all day every\nday basically yeah and um and so like\nmost people were like oh you know we had\nso many family members they were like\nwhen are you guys going to do it when\nare you guys going to get married when\nyou're going to get engaged and so we\ndidn't get engaged for seven years um\nand then we didn't get married until you\nknow uh 9 years n almost 9 years um and\nso uh we never really went by anybody\nelse's timeline so I have an idea of of\nwhy I think that is for me in my\nperspective but I'm curious your\nperspective of like our timeline\ncompared to other people's timelines\nwell I think if you compare it to other\npeople's timelines they would think we\nyou know took things really slowly or\nother people's expectations yeah I mean\nto be honest I think something\nthat's really important is just to do\nwhat feels right to you and that's all\nwe ever did was just what felt right to\nus I think you and I also fall under the\nsame belief that marriage isn't really\ngoing to change anything right um so we\nreally like had everything we wanted\nwith just being together and I mean we\nhad already been living together for a\nwhile we had bought a house there wasn't\nreally anything that was holding us back\nfrom\nfeeling totally safe with each other\nbecause of all this work we've been\ndoing you know I didn't we weren't\nlooking for something outside of us to\nchange what was happening between us\nyeah so the marriage wasn't going to\nchange anything so I I don't think that\nthat's or I think that that's why we\ndidn't feel like rushed yeah and you\nknow I've just never really cared what\npeople think all that much yeah you\ndon't care about that there is zero% of\nRob that cares what anybody thinks about\nhim ever which is nice it's been a good\nexample for me because I haven't always\nfelt that way and I can't say I truly do\nyet there's still parts of me that care\nbut yeah not like you working on it yeah\nI mean I just feel like and it goes back\nto like I I do believe in and we can\ntalk about this in a future episode but\nI really truly believe like deeply in my\nintuitive sense that I do have I think\nmy intuition is very strong it is very\nstrong and um it's never really swayed\nme in any sort of way and so for\nsomebody who doesn't know me as well as\nI know me to try to tell me what I\nshould do with my life or how I should\nact has never really reson ated with me\nso true and so I think that a lot I\nthink that for a lot of people it just\nbecomes you become more confident in\nyourself you become more confident your\nintuition in your path in life the more\nthat you work on yourself the more that\nyou are like hey yeah this is who I am\nand as we're on it and there was never a\nmoment where I was like oh man like we\nwe should hurry up and and go by other\npeople's timelines and then um it\nhappened perfectly exactly as it should\nyeah and um I'll I'll say this then we\ndecided to get married yeah and as we\ndecided to get married then we were like\nshould we do a wedding should we not do\na wedding family people wanted us to\nhave a wedding you know then we started\nthinking about how many people would be\nthere and what it would look like and\nstuff and so then you know we talk to\nother people that are like well yeah we\ndidn't want to have a wedding but we did\nbecause my parents wanted us and we\nstarted talking to people who we started\nrealizing that some people had rushed\ntheir relationship because of other\npeople outside of them that wanted them\nto rush the relationship like their\nparents or their family then we found\nother people sometimes the same people\nwho had didn't they wanted to just go\nand a lope somewhere but they had this\nhuge wedding there was a huge hassle\nwith a whole bunch of people that they\nkind of knew and didn't really know and\nthey felt obligated to invite someone\nbecause their mom said this person used\nto watch you when you were 3 years old\nand I haven't seen you haven't seen them\nin 30s something years and um we were\nlike you know what like let's just go\nand get married one day and so um we uh\nwe decided I called up my friend who's\nthe friend who you and I actually went\non the brunch that you yet Alan who\nwe're both really good friends with um\nand Alan's already like an ordained\nminister or whatever the phrases yeah\nand I call him up and I was like hey do\nyou want to marry us next week and he's\nlike sure and so it was me you him and\nthen John who's behind the camera right\nnow who's the videographer he was there\ntaking pictures and bear and so\nbasically me you and Allan and we did\nthe ceremony and then we went to our\nfavorite restaurant and it was perfect\nexactly as we wanted it we got married\nand we didn't have to do the whole\nhassle but we did kind of what we wanted\nto do yeah we before that we did a um\ncacao ceremony it was a love and\ngratitude ceremony on 22222 mhm in Tulum\nin Tulum that was fun and then we also\ndid afterwards after the uh the legal\nceremony with Allan we we had like a\ndinner with our closest family and\nfriends it was just like a celebration\nof30 people at our house yeah but it was\ngreat because I think what we wanted was\njust to bring the people that we love\nthe most into one space to have them all\ntogether cuz that to me was like the the\ncoolest part of a wedding is that you\nget to have all these people in one\nplace together to celebrate and so we\ndid that that's what we wanted to do so\nit all looked a little different than\nwhat like the classic wedding situation\nlooks like now but it felt right for us\nand I wouldn't have had it any other way\nyeah it was great one the one thing that\nI've noticed though is that as were we\nwere talking about making this episode\nis that we've noticed that with every\nlike major life event I feel like we've\nactually be come closer in everything\nthat we've so you know with the doing\npsychedelics with traveling with seeing\nthe guy who is the therapist with\nstarting a business starting your\nbusiness with um us getting engaged with\nus getting married uh a year and a half\nago Toby your dog passed away your dog\noriginally my dog as well passed away\nand um every life event that tends to\nhappen I feel like it can uh test a\nrelationship but with testing\nrelationship can also make the\nrelationship stronger and I feel MH I'll\ngive you my perspective you give me\nyours that everything that's ever\nhappened to us our relationship just\ntends to get more and more strong I\nthink we actually find more ways to love\neach other through everything that\nhappens yeah it really has and it's been\nkind of like the silver lining of the\nharder things because it gives you an\nopportunity it's given me an opportunity\nto see you in a new light because\nthere's like a new depth that we reach\ntogether it it's always been like really\nbeautiful and it's it's cool because our\nrelationship is so amazing and it\ndeserves this like certain level of\nrespect one of the most quality\nrelationships I've ever had if not like\nthe most quality relationship and so I\nfeel like it deserves a lot of respect\nand when these things happen the respect\nthat comes out of you and the respect\nthat I want to like show up with when\nyou know somebody that you love so much\nis going through something or they\nreally need you it's like you just step\nup because it means so much yeah and so\nit's been yeah like even through like\nthe harder things it's created really\nbeautiful opportunities to step up right\nyeah yeah I would 100% agree with that\nand um you know what I want to uh finish\nus off with is um and obviously now you\nguys have you know about 40ish minutes\nof getting to know me a little bit\nbetter getting to know Lauren a little\nbit better no this is long for you guys\nyeah this is long for for the this\npodcast right um so if you guys have\nquestions that you want to ask us I\nactually you can go to ask robobin\nlauren.com and you can just put\nquestions down that you want us to\nanswer in future episodes or topic ideas\nuh the more detailed your questions uh\nthe more that we can actually give\nreally detailed and thorough answers so\nif it's like why are you together that's\na hard thing to answer but if it's like\nmore indepth um we can try to do it\nwhether it's on relationships whether\nit's on life whether it's on you know\nbeing a man or being a woman or you know\nour masculine sides our feminine sides\nany of those types of things whatever\nquestion you guys have you can go to ask\nrobobin lauren.com and uh and I'll\nfinish it off uh with why we decided to\nbe with each other because someone had\nsent us a message and said how did you\nknow that Lauren was the one and I was\nlike I personally don't believe that\nthere is just one person in this earth\nthat's made for you I think that you\nfind somebody that you align with very\nwell and you decide hey this is a person\nI'm going to work with this is a person\nthat's worth me putting in the effort\nand the\nuh the the having hard conversations\nwhen hard conversation you be had and\nand putting in the effort so um I\nchanged that question instead of like\nhow did you know she was the one because\nI don't think there's like one moment\nwhere I was like oh my God she's the one\nbut I think it's just a lot of little\nmoments that kind of showed me um yeah\nthis is what I want this is what I want\nmy children to experience all of that so\nI'm curious with you um you know for you\nfirst and then I'll go uh why did you\ndecide to be with me well I think I've\nkind of actually touched on this a\nlittle bit but the main things are\nsafety MH I've never felt more safe with\nanybody I mean obviously I felt a lot of\nsafety with my parents but with you that\nwas never a question what do you mean do\nyou mean physical safety or emotional\nsafety both actually and I'm glad you\nasked that because it was both safe to\nbe vulnerable safe to be myself\nphysically like I knew you would never\nput us into some you know crazy\nsituation MH um I trusted you a lot\nyou've always given me plenty of reason\nto trust you never really given me any\nreason not to which is huge and then\nalso I just have so much fun with you\nand I genuinely enjoy being around you\nclearly a lot you know for large\nquantities of time you make me laugh and\nI just I think also you've always\nmanaged to impress me I've always been\nlike wo because always want to take\nthings to a level that I might have\nnever even imagined\nyou so as and that's exting that's so\nfreaking and fun so it's it's it was\nlike for me it's it's all of those\nthings all together that was like this\nis a no-brainer yeah mine was uh and\nI've told you this before is I was like\nwow this woman loves so deeply and so I\nI I think that one of the reasons why I\nwas able to experience you with Toby is\ncuz I was like oh my God if she loves\nthat dog which I love that dog so much\ntoo as deeply as she does and gives love\nso freely and so amazing like how\namazing would it be for her to like to\nfor me to start to be able to experience\nthat and know it and be able to like oh\nmy God can I open myself up to it is it\nsafe to open myself up to it but also\nlike what would it be like to raise\nchildren in that environment of Just\nLike Love is is omnipresent right and so\nfor me I think that was the main thing\nobvious viously we have a lot of fun we\nget along real well we almost never have\nfights we might have little like\nbickering things that last 15 seconds at\nmost yeah but um but I think the main\nthing was was I was like yeah I think\nthat I feel in going back to safety I\nfeel emotionally safe there's and this\nis something that we're going to talk\nabout the next time that we talk about\nwe have another episode that's going to\nbe called something like what is love\nwhen we talk about love which is um I\ndon't feel like you ever tried to change\nme or tell me that I couldn't do\nsomething right um and so that's big for\nme because I like doing crazy [ __ ] and I\nlike doing things that people have never\ndone before that I've never done before\nand every time I'm like hey I want to\ntry this thing you're like okay cool go\nfor it right and so I think I felt very\nsupported in never it was always just\nyou know I see love as acceptance almost\nas interchangeable and I think that I\nalways just felt like I was always\naccepted as I was you never wanted to\nchange me you never wanted me to be\ndifferent you never wanted me to be who\nyou wanted to to be wanted me to be but\njust like hey I'm going to love him as\nhe is and so I felt like that was\nomnipresent and then I was like that's I\nsee how much she loves that dog and I\nwant my children to be uh raised in that\nuh in a house that feels that yeah so\nthat's my answer I love that I love that\ntoo so everybody um once again if you\nhave questions for us you can go to ask\nrobobin lauren.com we're going to do\nsome more of these I don't know how\noften we're going to do them maybe once\na month maybe twice a month who knows um\nbut you can uh go ahead and go to that\nwebsite and um we'll start talking a\nlittle bit more there's you know there\nmight have been we planed this over\nbreakfast so there might have been\nthings that we missed I'm sure there's\nthings that we missed over our\nrelationship and um once again we never\nthink that we're perfect or that we've\ngot it all figured out absolutely at all\num really what it comes down to is we're\njust going to authentically share who we\nare as people and ourselves and\nhopefully people can say oh man I\nlearned something from that yeah that\nwould be great that's what we got for\nyou for today's episode everybody if you\nlove this please share it with a friend\nshare it on your Instagram stories
