    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you three different ways to\nreprogram your subconscious mind to\ncreate the life that you want let's dive\nin I'm going to be giving you three ways\nto reprogram your mind listen you're\nhere because you know if you want your\nlife to be different you have to change\nright if you want your life to change\nyou have to change\nbut then it starts getting really hard\nit's not really easy to change uh the\nkey to achieving success in any area of\nyour life comes from your ability to\nchange yourself and a lot of times\nchanging yourself comes from changing\nyour mind first reprogramming your mind\nto change your old patterns to change\nyour old beliefs your old programs and\nyour thoughts your habits and your\nbeliefs are your driving forces behind\nyour actions and that will then\ndetermine your outcome so if you can\nunderstand the psychology and the\nscience that's behind mental\nreprogramming then you can start to take\ncharge of your life and create the\nfuture that doesn't look like your past\nbecause if you do nothing and you just\ncontinue to do the same things that you\nhave been doing nothing will change your\ntomorrow will look exactly like\nyesterday until the day you die and so\nin this episode we're going to really\ntalk about how to reprogram your mind to\nkind of get anything that you want and\nI'm not going to just tell you from like\nsome Foo fooy woo wooy type of way hey\nyou can get anything you want like I'm\nactually going to teach you proven\npsychological techniques and use\nscientific evidence because I'm a a very\nskeptical person if you're listening to\nthis podcast you probably the type of\nperson that's like that as well and so\nuh that's probably why you're attracted\nto this podcast because you're probably\nvery skeptical but also wanting to\nimprove yourself and so we're probably\nboth Skeptics and so I'm going to show\nyou through science and through\npsychology how to actually start\nreprogramming your brain so the first\nthing that I want to talk about that\nbefore I teach you how to do it is you\nhave to really understand what it is\nthat we're trying to change you have to\nunderstand your mind before we dive into\nthe process of reprogramming you got to\nunderstand how the mind works right and\nso the Mind consists basically of two\nparts when you break it down there's the\nconscious mind and there's the\nsubconscious mind the conscious mind is\nresponsible for just day-to-day thoughts\ndecisions actions in the moment and the\nsubconscious mind really stores a lot of\nmemories it stores beliefs it stores\nhabits and it kind of works very\nautomatically and it's you know below\nthe mind which is why they call it the\nsubconscious mind so let's dive into the\nconscious mind first the conscious mind\nis our thinking mind it is the mind that\nyou know that exists that thinks\nthroughout the day it's the voice that\nyou hear inside of your head oh man I\nshould go get the kids before I you know\ngo ahead and do this oh yeah well that's\nthat's your that's your conscious mind\nthat's your thinking mind it's where we\nprocess information it's where we make\ndecisions where we talk to oursel but\nthe crazy part about the conscious mind\nis that it accounts for roughly about 5%\nof our cognitive activities throughout\nthe day and so it's it's very limited\nand it's just basically like okay tell\nme what to do and I'll do it okay tell\nme what to do and I'll do it and so you\nmight ask yourself like how how is it\nonly responsible for 5% I know all of\nthe thoughts that I'm thinking\nthroughout the day well no you don't you\nknow all of the conscious thoughts and\nso this is why we can often really\nstruggle when we are trying to change\nourselves and we're trying to change our\nhabits and we're trying to change our\nthought patterns as we are only mostly\naware of our conscious mind our and our\nconscious mind can only handle so much\nat once and we normally do not slow down\nenough to analyze our subconscious most\npeople keep so busy that they don't slow\ndown enough and sit in silence and just\nshut up for a little while so that they\ncan actually start to analyze their\nsubconscious mind to analyze their\npatterns that they have that are\nhappening below the surface if you want\nreal change you can't just do it with\nthe conscious mind you have to dive into\nthe subconscious and so when you look\ninto the subconscious mind so let's talk\nabout the subconscious mind for a second\nso the subconscious mind is responsible\nfor approximately\n95% of our mental activities it operates\nautomatically it stores memories it\nstores your beliefs it stores your\nhabits and you usually operate off of\nthose things and you know sometimes\nit'll just be an immediate action you\nknow like you know um to when the stove\nis on to avoid it with your hand you\ndon't have to consciously think I don't\nwant to put my hand on the stove no your\nyour brain knows that you've you've been\nburned before in different ways you know\nto avoid that but the most important\nthing that it's responsible for is for\nregulating your emotions and also\ncarrying out the majority of your daily\ntasks because they found that\npsychologists have found that\napproximately 50% of what we do is\nbasically on autopilot like we're not\nreally paying attention if you've ever\ndriven home from work and you were going\nto stop and and get some milk and then\nyou get home and you're like oh my god I\ndidn't even stop and get milk and you're\nlike wait I don't even really remember\ndriving home yeah cuz your your\nsubconscious mind your your autopilot\nwas working and so our subconscious has\na massive massive impact on our lives\nand very rarely do people actually dive\nin and try to focus on it and so it's\nreally important for us to focus on\nreprogramming this part of our mind if\nwe want lasting change because that's\nwhere our habits that's where our\nbeliefs are all stored and so there's\nthere you have to understand that\nthere's throughout the day millions of\nbits of processing happening every\nsecond in your mind below your conscious\nthought of hey maybe I should go and\npick up coffee on the way to work right\nthat's your conscious mind but below\nthat there's millions of bits of\nprocessing happening every single second\nbelow that conscious mind below\nconscious subconscious that's what it\nmeans so if you're not paying attention\nto it you usually don't even notice the\nsubconscious and sometimes your brain\nwill say for instance react to a person\nor a location or a smell and you didn't\neven know happen until after it happens\nand you're like oh my god I didn't even\nnotice that I just did that your\nsubconscious reacts and then a lot of\ntimes your mind your conscious mind\ncatches up a lot of times it's an\nimmediate thing it's an immediate\nthought automatic thoughts automatic\nfeelings and then your mind your\nconscious mind is like oh okay I see\nwhat we just did like if I tell you\nright now focus on your right thumb your\nbrain was processing your right thumb\nthis entire time I've been\nspeaking but it was filtering it out so\nthat you could be listening to me so you\nbe thinking of something else so you\ncould be driving your car it wasn't\nthinking about your right thumb but when\nI tell you right now hey think about\nyour right thumb you can go from\nsubconsciously processing your brain is\nprocessing your right thumb at all\npoints in time it's just filtering it\nout to now you can actually start to pay\nattention to it and so really what you\nhave to understand is the mind so before\nwe start to change our mind we've got to\nunderstand the conscious we've got to\nunderstand the\nsubconscious once again subconscious is\n95% of our processing throughout the day\nthat's 19 times stronger than the 5%\nconscious mind and so you've got to\nstart to understand it to change your\nbrain now a lot of people if you're just\nnewer in self-development are going to\nbe like but I've been this way my entire\nlife I just am this way well you can\nchange yourself at any moment you can\nchange your brain at any moment there's\na science behind it's called\nneuroplasticity Neuroscience has proven\nthat our brains are not hardwired\nforever the phrase you can't teach an\nold dog new tricks is you can\nteach an old dog new tricks might take\nlonger because it's an old dog and an\nold brain but anyone can learn and\nchange thems at any moment um so we have\nto understand that um and so the the\nchanging of your brain and the ad\nadaptation of your brain is known as\nneuroplasticity uh it is super important\nI have an entire chapter of it in my\nbook level up it's chapter 11 where I\nliterally dive into neuroplasticity and\nhow to actually change your brain um and\nand when you change your brain it means\nthat your brain can form new connections\nand reorganize existing ones and so what\nthat does that allows you to learn new\nskills it allows you to change your\nhabits it allows you to change your\nlimiting beliefs anything that that\nmight be existing and so like if you're\na negative person like I used to be a\nvery very negative person um and I hated\nit I was very pessimistic I could find\nthe holes in anything and and I just\ndidn't like being that person and for a\nlong time it was just very easy for me\nto be negative something would pop up I\nwas just an I would be negative\nwhatever it was and I consciously had to\ntake years of trying to change it trying\nto reprogram your trying to change it\nand now it's it's crazy for me to think\nI've been working myself now for 18 19\nyears and it's really hard for me to be\npessimistic at this point it's hard for\nme to not try to find a silver lining in\nsomething no matter what it is that\nhappens and so it doesn't happen right\naway but it it it allows you to be able\nto change because uh in Neuroscience the\nmost famous phrase in Neuroscience is\nneurons that fire together wire together\nyour neurons just send electrical\nsignals between each other and so when\nthey say fire together that means send\nelectrical signals to each other so\nthere's parts of your brain that are\nquote unquote the negative alleys that\nare just very easy for your brain to go\ndown that alley and so you might not\nreally have much of a positive alley for\nyour brain to go down but if you start\nworking on it and trying to find the\ngood and trying to find the good and\ntrying to find the good and stop paying\nattention to the negative it'll actually\nweaken the signal between the negative\nneurons quote unquote negative neurons\nand start strengthening the signal\nbetween the positive neurons which over\ntime doing it over and over and over\nagain repetition is a very key part to\nwhat we're going to be talking about\nhere today if you do it over and over\nand over again it makes the actual quote\nunquote positive neurons the positive\nAlleyways uh much stronger than the\nnegative ones over time so you might be\nsitting there and say so Rob we can\nchange our brains through\nneuroplasticity if we can change our\nbrains through neuroplasticity can we\nlike rewire our brains for success or\nrewire our brains for happiness or\nrewire our brains to feel more love or\nmore gratitude absolutely you sure can\nand we just need to be very clear on\nwhat's happening in our brain at all\npoints in time we need to become very\naware um and so we need to be clear on\nwhat thoughts are going on in our heads\nwhat behaviors we have what habits we\nhave that we need to change in order to\neventually change our lives and so a lot\nof times most people are just kind\nof living their lives unaware they're\nkind of just uh walking zombies they're\nnot aware and consciously in their self\nas much as they could be and so as you\nstart to bring this awareness you start\nto notice things about yourself that you\ncan change over time but if we\nconsistently practice these new patterns\nour brains will eventually adopt them\nand they will become the new norm and so\nthere's really three parts to this\nbefore we go into the the the\nrepatterning um in exactly how to do it\nbut there's three simple parts that I\nalways talk about right the first thing\nis the awareness right number one what\ndo you want to change about yourself and\nwhat do you want those new things to be\nso you've got to become aware you know\nwhat I'm negative as hell it makes and\nI'm I'm spewing my negativity and\nvomiting my negativity all over other\npeople I don't want to be negative\nanymore okay what do I want to be I want\nto be positive I want to be grateful I\nwant to be more loving cool that's\nawareness well now when you notice\nyourself start to become more negative\nand pop up and be NE in moments\nawareness needs to come back in so you\nhave to have the awareness which is\nnumber one number two is practice and\nnumber three is repetition so let me\nexplain it and then we we'll dive into\nit so awareness number one two practice\nthree repetition awareness what do I\nwant to change and what do I want to\nchange it to when I notice myself go\ndown the alley that I don't want to go\ndown two what is my practice what am I\ngoing to do to get myself out of that\nold awareness that I was in or the old\npatterns that I was in and what am I\ngoing to change them to and number three\nrepetition I do it over and over and\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain hundreds and hundreds thousands\nand thousands hundreds and thousands of\ntimes and eventually you start to just\nrepattern yourself so awareness what is\nit that you want to change and you\nbecome aware in the moment practice what\nam I going to do so let's say that your\nawareness is that you are very\njudgmental and you don't want to be\njudgmental anymore okay cool well then\nwhen I notice myself be judgmental what\nis my practice and I've said shared this\nwith you before I've done this where I\nwould found myself being very judgmental\nwhen I would judge somebody my practice\nwas in that moment I would force myself\nto say three things that were positive\nabout that\nperson so awareness I'm noticing that\nI'm negative and I'm being judgmental on\nthis person what is my practice that\nI've already decided I'm going to say\nthree positive things about this person\nand then three so that's awareness\npractice number three is repetition I'm\ngoing to do it over and over and over\nand over and over again every single\ntime I notice myself being judgmental so\nthat's what you have to understand\nawareness practice repetition okay now\nlet's talk about the tech techniques to\nreprogram your mind the first one is\ncalled cognitive restructuring cognitive\nrestructuring is a technique that's used\nin cognitive behavioral therapy CBT uh\nthat involves identifying and replacing\nirrational and negative thoughts with\nthe thoughts that you want kind of like\nwhat I was just saying right there with\nokay I've noticed that I'm judgmental\nnow I need to replace with what I want\nand so this process helps you um\nrecognize the impact of your thoughts\nand the patterns that you have on your\nemotions on your behaviors on the world\naround you and really starts to um equip\nyou with the tools that are necessary to\nchallenge and change those patterns I've\nsaid this many times in the podcast but\nwhen you notice a uh a thought come into\nyour head get really good at challenging\nthat thought like test the validity of\nthat thought and just start to challenge\nyourself try to see the other side try\nto play devil's advocate for the other\nside of where you're normally thinking\nand so when you start to to do um\ncognitive restructuring it's here's\nsomething I've noticed about myself that\nI don't want anymore I'm going to\nidentify them and I'm going to replace\nthem uh in the moment when I notice them\npop up with the thoughts that I want I'm\ngoing to do it over and over and over\nagain and there are tons and tons and\ntons of studies that have shown the\neffectiveness of cognitive restructuring\nin treating variety of of psychological\ndisorders so like depression anxiety uh\nobsessive compulsive disorder and so\nwhen you actually start to get really\ngood at practicing cognitive\nrestructuring you can reprogram your\nmind to think whatever it is you kind of\nwant more positively less judgmental\nmore loving more more grateful which in\nturn is going to give you a greater\nsense of confidence and makes you more\nlikely to take action uh which is a cool\npart about it so you can't always\ncontrol your first thought but you can\nalways control your second thought and\nif you change your first thought to your\nsecond thought over and over and over\nand over and over again hundreds and\nhundreds and thousands and thousands of\ntimes eventually that second thought\ntakes the place of that first thought\nso let me say again you can't always\ncontrol your first thought because\nthat's an automatic thought Cog\nbehavioral therapy calls it ants\nautomatic negative thoughts but you can\nalways once you become aware of your\nfirst thought control your second\nthought because the first thought is\nusually subconscious the second thought\nrequires conscious decision- making in\nthat moment so like some people I've\ntalked to before in coaching like I\neverything up I always SC screw things\nup right and you start to feel down on\nyourself when you think that well take a\ntake a step out of your own head look at\nyourself and say is that thought of I'm\nI everything up is that thought\ngoing to support me in doing what I want\nto is it going to support me in growing\nmy business to a million dollars this\nmonth no okay replace it with three\npieces of data that show that you're not\na failure okay let me take a step back\nlet me let me and once again this is\nawareness and this is practice it takes\na little bit longer this is why most\npeople don't do it okay I've noticed\nthat I you know had this thought if I\n everything up that's not going to\nhelp me get to where I want to in life I\nneed to replace that thought that that\nfirst thought with three pieces of data\nthat show that I'm not a failure okay\nnumber one I graduated in the top 20 of\nmy high school okay cool good for you\nwhat's the second thing um I had a goal\nof losing 20 pounds last year and I did\nit awesome I am a incredible father okay\nperfect you're doing great there you go\nthat's cognitive restructuring you\nidentify the bad thoughts when they come\nup and then you replace them if you want\nyou know imagine your mind being a\ngarden you're the only one that can be\ntending to this Garden you've got to\npull the weeds whenever the weeds pop up\nyou've got to pull the weeds and that's\nwhat we're doing so that's the first\nthing is cognitive restruction the\nsecond thing is\nvisualization right let's be real\nvisualization seems corny you close your\neyes and you think about what it would\nlook like and feel like to achieve your\ndreams okay hippie cool but science have\nshown many times over and over again\nthis stuff actually works visualization\nis extremely powerful tool that could be\nused to reprogram your subconscious mind\nonce again the one that controls 95% of\nyour thoughts and feelings so it\ninvolves creating mental images of\nwhatever it is that you want the goals\nthe actions and then feeling it in your\nbody in this moment how proud of\nyourself would you be if you did that\nright so you first have to know what you\nwant in order for you to visualize it\nthough so like I've always given the\nexample many times of of me and my\ngirlfriend at the time now wife going to\nItaly but I visualized it every single\nday for 6 months and then we were in\nItaly in 6 months I was like we're going\nto be there we're going to be there\nwe're going to be there so I did it for\n6 months and then we ended up moving\nthere for 6 months and so you know\nvisualize that house that you want in\nthe beach how proud of your like feel in\nyour body how proud of yourself you\nwould be if you did that visualize\nyourself you know traveling to Spain\nwith your children and going and seeing\nthe sagata Familia or whatever it is\nthat you want to go and see with them\nlike visualize yourself there with the\npeople that you want to be there with\nover and over and over like you don't\nsit down visualize once you do it every\nsingle morning until you're basically\nbrainwashing yourself into believing\nthat it's possible because by\nvisualizing ourselves achieving the\ngoals that we want we train our\nourselves to basically believe that it's\npossible cuz all too often you're just\nbelieving that it's not possible and\nthat's why you're not taking the action\nthat you could so when you're\nvisualizing it over and over and over\nagain you believe it's possible which in\nturn increases your motivation you work\ntowards harder towards it you become\nmore committed and you actually achieve\nwhat is that you want and it's shown\nover and over and over again that more\noften than not we just don't believe in\nourselves and so this is a way that we\ncan start to believe in ourselves and\nbrainwash oursel into actually believing\nit's possible and there's scientific\nstudies that have shown over and over\nagain that visualization improves\nperformance in almost any part of life\nyou know there's a study that was\npublished in the Journal of Applied\nsports psychology they found that\nathletes who practice visualization um\nexperience significant improvements in\ntheir performance um and so like\nparticipants used uh imagery as a\npre-performance routine and those that\nactually used it showed the greatest\nImprovement in their in in this case was\ngolfing performance and so they they had\nthem visualize making the putt over and\nover and over again and then they went\nout and the people who had the greatest\nImprovement were the ones who visualized\nmaking the putt so that's number two and\nnumber three is affirmations\naffirmations are just statements that\nyou say to yourself you are constantly\naffirming yourself in some sort of way\nall the time all day long\nquestion is are they positive\naffirmations are they negative\naffirmations and you repeat them over\nand over and over again you actually\nstart to reape your reshape your\nsubconscious beliefs and your thought\npatterns you know and if and all day\nlong just do them after you brush your\nteeth do them every single day in the\nmorning you do them right after brush\nyour teeth in the evening right after\nbrush your teeth do them find out the\nway what do you want to say to yourself\nwhat is the the new thought patterns\nthat you want in your head because\nresearch on the effectiveness of\naffirmations reveal\nthat uh it leads to improvements in\nself-esteem into uh stress reduction and\noverall well-being and there was a study\nthat was published in the Journal of\npsychological science that found that\nparticipants who engaged in\nself-affirmation activities exhibited\nincreased activity in the brain regions\nassociated with self-referential\nprocessing which is uh means the you\nknow the way that you think about\nyourself and the way it relates to the\noutside world and the evaluation of that\nand the results show that affirm have a\nprofound impact on the mental state and\ncontribute to a more positive outlook\nfor people so you have to brainwash\nyourself in in and visualizing what is\nthat you want and also speaking exactly\nwhat is that you want so you can\nbrainwash yourself into believing\nwhatever it is that you\nwant I mean we've basically all been\nbrainwashed to believe what we currently\nbelieve why don't we now take control of\nour own brainwashing and why don't you\njust brainwash yourself into believing\nwhat you want to believe and to doing\nwhat you want to do so essentially\ncognitive restruct uh cognitive\nrestructuring visual visualizing and\naffirmations are you brainwashing\nyourself you've been brainwashed by\neverything that's ever happened to you\nnow this is your opportunity for you to\ntake control and actually start to\nbrainwash yourself so that you can\nreprogram your brain the way that you\nwant to be so that's all I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please do me a huge favor share\nit on your Instagram stories tag me in\nat Rob dial Jr r o d i a ljr the only\nway this podcast grows is from you guys\nsharing it and so I'd
