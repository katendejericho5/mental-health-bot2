    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to actually step back\ninto your humanness how to feel and\nprocess your feelings and emotions\nunderstand them better so that you can\ngo out there and actually be more human\nlet's dive in I'm going to teach you\nfrom my own past struggles because this\nis something that I really struggle with\nfor a really long time uh and I always\nlike to say it on the podcast I am in no\nsort of way a perfect human I am just\nanother flawed individual trying to\nfigure out the this whole life thing and\nuh as I start to figure more stuff out I\nstart to share more stuff with you guys\nI always like to use myself as the\nguinea pig and one thing that I learned\nis that I had picked up a defense\nmechanism uh early in my childhood my\nteen years and uh it kind of carried\nwith me for a little while and uh one\nthing that I notice in other people\nbecause of the fact that it's like oh I\ncan see this in myself I know how to\nwork through it then I start to see it\nin other people is that one thing that I\nnotic in this defense mechanism that we\nall kind of build in ourselves is that\nwe we tend to block out a lot of\nfeelings and a lot of emotions and for\nme I blocked out a lot of my feelings\nand a lot of emotions for years and\nyears and years and you know I think\nhaving a alcoholic father and you know\nthings that came from it and him saying\nhe was going to pick me up sometimes and\nnever showed up um stuff that I\nexperienced before the age of 10 before\nmy parents got divorced just kind of\nmade me start to block out some emotions\nand I think a lot of people do this you\nknow then there was him passing away at\n15 years old and like 4 days later I\nwent back to school and I told nobody I\nthink I just\nlearned not purposefully it wasn't\nsomething I did consciously in any sort\nof way I just learned not to allow\nmyself um to feel my feelings and then\njust to to have things happen in my life\nand then just to go on about my day\npushing them all away and to the point\nwhere actually you know at one point in\ntime there was one day where I actually\nwondered I was like do I just not have\nany feelings towards anything at all\nlike I had pushed them away for so long\nthat I was just kind of numb to feelings\nI was kind of numb to everything and I\nhad to go on this path of like\nrediscovering my humanness and so I\nthink a lot of people do this I think\nthis is something that we all kind of\nnaturally do you know a lot of times you\nknow you can have something really bad\nhappen to you like somebody somebody\nthat you really love dies and it hurts\nso much that what you would rather do is\nbe busy and instead of actually feel it\nlike we've all heard someone do this\nbefore we we have done this before right\nsomeone is going through a lot of pain\nthey're going through a lot of grief and\ninstead of actually feeling it and\nprocessing it and letting go of it and\nreleasing it they say something like\nwell I just need to keep myself busy\nright now AKA I don't want to let myself\nfeel the pain we all know someone who's\ndone this before or have personally done\nthis right I'm just yeah I just got to I\njust got to keep busy right now\nwhich basically means I need to stay\nbusy so that I don't feel my pain I\ndon't process my emotions but if you\ndon't feel it if you don't process it it\nstays with you and I realized that some\nof the most emotional people in the\nworld actually do this um because their\nemotions can be so strong I had someone\nthat was in a coaching group of mine\nabout 3 or four years ago and uh she was\nlike you know what like I just don't\nfeel as deeply as others I don't I don't\nunderstand when people feel deeply about\nthis and by that time I had been\ncoaching her for about 6 months or\nsomething like that and I said no that's\n I think that you actually feel\ndeeper than others and you're afraid of\nit and so you've learned to shut it off\nand you know there's childhood traumas\nand things that came about uh that made\nher be that way but she after IID said\nit she's like oh my God I think that\nyou're right it's not that I don't have\nthe emotions is that the emotions are so\nstrong I don't know how to handle them\nand I've just learned to repress all of\nmy emot emotions and so when you look at\nbeing a human being a human is this\nincredible experience this whole life\nthing is crazy right it is\namazing it is hard it is beautiful it is\na show it is all of these things\nand one of the beautiful things about\nbeing a human about being born into this\nbody that you're born into is that you\nget to experience feelings and emotions\nand that's one thing that most animals\nand most living beings on this Earth\ndon't really get to feel they don't\nreally get emotions they don't really\nget feelings to to work through and\nthere's a lot of highs in life and\nthere's also a lot of lows and one thing\nthat I have realized is you can't\nexperience the highest of highs if you\ndon't allow yourself to experience the\nlowest of lows the amount that you\nrestrict the low in your life and the\nway that the amount that you allow\nyourself to experience and you restrict\nthose low feelings you will also\nrestrict the high feelings in the exact\namount as as well and so if you really\nwant to feel the highest of highs in\nlife you also have to let yourself feel\nthe lowest of lows when they when they\ncome in and I remember for me about uh\nyou know let me think what year is it\nyeah about 13 years ago I remember I was\ngoing through something that was really\nreally tough and it really like hurt so\nbad for months and months and months and\nI remember even though I was going\nthrough so much pain that I was going\nthrough I remember taking a step back in\nmy mind and being like this is crazy\nthat I can feel this much like even\nthough this sucks and it's painful and I\ndon't want to be going through it how\nbeautiful is it that I have the capacity\nto feel this deeply towards anything and\nit hurt but at the same time I was like\ndamn even the hurt can be so beautiful\nwhere it's like I can't believe that I\ncan feel this deeply about anything and\nusually instead of let instead of\nletting ourselves feel that deeply we\ntry to close off and not allow oursel to\nfeel it and I don't know how it happens\nin everyone's life but somewhere down\nthe line lots of us are programmed to\nstop feeling and to stop showing our\nemotions not everybody is this way but\nlots of people that I have found are\nprogrammed accidentally not on purpose\nto just stop feeling and I believe that\nour body is made to release these\nemotions to not hold on to those\nemotions emotions are not meant to stay\nin you forever they're meant to to work\nthrough you and for you to release them\nand so I've given this example a couple\ntimes and I recommend that you actually\ngo and look at these two videos on\nYouTube one of them is called um I think\nit's called polar bear trauma if you\nYouTube Polar Bear trauma you'll see it\nand there's a video of uh these\nresearchers in a helicopter and they\nhave to shoot a polar bear with a\ntranquilizer and so it's it's awake but\nit's very sedated right and it starts to\nlike shake it looks like it's it's\nbasically convulsing right and the the\npolar bear is convulsing like literally\nshaking as if it's having a seizure and\nthen it just takes a you know after\nconvulsing for a few minutes it just\ngoes takes a deep breath and starts\nbreathing really deep and the guy who\nsitting in front of him and that's the\nresearcher says um you know he's going\nthrough such a heightened traumatic\nexperience his body is releasing all of\nthe the cortisol all of the adrenaline\nthat's built up in his body so that his\nbody doesn't hold on to it and so his\nbody is really convulsing to release the\ntraumatic experience so the traumatic\nexperience doesn't stay inside of him\nthen there's another video um that if\nyou if you go to YouTube and you type in\nimp poish stress you'll actually see\nthis video of this it's probably I think\nit might be a Jaguar that attacks this\nImpala and it's got its head basically\nin its mouth and the um the animal gets\nscared off and the Impala is laying on\nthe ground for a couple minutes and then\nit starts doing the same thing the polar\nbear does it starts having a seizure it\nstarts convulsing and it's you know\nsitting on the ground laying on the\nground it's convulsing for a little\nwhile it's shaking and shaking and\nshaking and then it stops and you can\nsee it take a deep breath and then it\ngets up and runs away and so it's built\ninto us to release Trauma from our body\nrelease the the heightened emotions the\nextra cortisol the extra adrenaline so\nit doesn't live inside of our bodies and\nthis is something that we naturally do\nas well so a polar bear that lives in a\ncompletely different place than the\nworld then in Impala does the exact same\nthing and this is something that we know\nhow to do to release emotions and let\nthem work through us so we don't have to\ncarry on with them how do we do it well\nchildren do it all the time children\nthrow temper tantrums when it's a very\nheightened experience now mind you\nchildren don't process the world the\nsame way that we do one of the biggest\nthings that I see that parents make huge\nmistakes of is is treating their\nthree-year-old or four-year-old as if\nthey're a 27y old and they're processing\nthe world the the same way they're not\nwhat can be tra itic to them is\nabsolutely nothing to us and so you know\nchildren will throw tamper tantrums and\nat a certain age it's fine it's not a\nbig deal when they're a newborn but at a\ncertain age the parents are like I've\nhad enough of this and most people's\nparents just say hey enough of the\ntemper tantrums and they make them stop\nand I think that we subconsciously\nlearn that those feelings and those\nemotions and expressing those emotions\nare bad and so we learn okay I feel this\nfeeling of I need to let go of this\nemotion but I I I don't I'm just going\nto hold on to it and we kind of learn\nthat you know I'm not blaming anybody\nchildren do what they do parents do what\nthey do but I just want you become aware\nof maybe your children if they're\nthrowing a temper tantrum now obviously\nthey might be trying to get what they\nwant but maybe there's also emotions\nrunning through them that they're trying\nto get rid of and so the um the\nimportant thing to really think about is\nthat most of us have been taught to re\ndepress and depress our emotions instead\nof Express them right so when we when we\ndepress them and when we repress them\ninstead of Express them it can lead to\ndepression there's just so much emotion\nthat's inside of our body we don't know\nwhat to do with it we don't know how to\nrelease it and it's just easier to do\nalmost nothing so what do we do we're in\nthis situation some of you guys\nlistening are like man I completely\nrelate to that what do I\ndo well you've got to give yourself\npermission to feel again that's the\nfirst thing give yourself permission to\nfeel to have emotions and to be a human\nand realize there's nothing wrong with\nit coming from somebody me who cut off\nhis feelings for a very long time I'm\ngiving you full permission to feel again\nand when you take you know I always love\nto use the example that Wayne D always\nuses when you take an orange and you\nsqueeze the orange you put a whole bunch\nof pressure on that orange orange what\ncomes out of it orange juice does when\nyou put pressure on that orange whatever\nis inside of it is going to come out of\nit well when you have a lot of pressure\nput on you what comes out when it's\ngetting to be too much when life is just\nboiling up and things just feels like\nyou're you're spinning a million plates\nyou don't know how to keep it all\ntogether what comes out of you is it\nanger is it sadness is it just rage is\nit crying is it\nconfusion\nlots of times the the circumstances in\nyour life that are causing so much\npressure that are making you feel like\nyou're under pressure they're not\ncausing the feelings of anger sadness\nrage crying confusion any of that stuff\nbut it's getting to a threshold where\nyou can no longer hold on to these\nfeelings there's so much pressure on you\nor feels like there's so much pressure\non you that whatever's inside of you is\ngoing to come out the same way that\nwhenever you squeeze and put pressure on\nan orange orange juice has come out\norange juice comes out why because\norange juice is what's\ninside well whatever comes out of you\nwhen there's a lot of pressure put on\nyou is what's actually living inside of\nyou at all points in time once again the\ncircumstances of your life don't create\nthose feelings most\ntimes but that pressure is what helps\nyou release those feelings you know when\nyou go on to uh if you ever happen to be\na type of person wants to go and um you\nknow go on a psychedelic Journey do\nSpirit Journey something like that when\nemotions come up one of the things that\nthey always say is they say what's\ncoming is going so what is coming up in\nthose Journeys is actually what your\nbody's trying to get rid of what's\ncoming is going it's trying to release\nall of that stuck energy that you have\ninside of you so we all really need to\nmake space for our humanness again we\nneed to make some space to be human\nallow yourself to feel allow yourself to\nbe again so how do you do that well I'm\ngoing to give you a couple different\ntips number one I'm just going to give\nyou a huge tip and this is coming from\nsomeone who's very busy you know has the\npodcast that he runs has a whole other\nside business with 30 employees stop\nbeing so busy like stop being so\nbusy a lot of times people are keeping\nthemselves so busy and so distracted so\nthey don't have to feel anything and so\nthey will be working all the time\nthey'll be busy with their children\nthey'll be on their phone all the time\nthey'll be distracted they'll be\nwatching TV like give give yourself some\nspace give yourself some\nsilence like give yourself an opening\nfor you to finally get back to Feeling\nAgain don't be so busy that's the first\nthing the second thing is allow yourself\nevery once in a while to throw an adult\ntemper tantrum now don't do it around\nanybody else but I'm just going to give\nyou permission to do this okay we all\nneed to get better at expressing versus\nrepressing our emotions and repressing\nthem and allow not you know not allowing\nthem to come\nout now I'm not saying that you need to\ntake this and directed at somebody else\nbut allow yourself to express all of the\nemotions in the moment or as close to\nmoment as possible so it doesn't stay\nwith you because if it stays with you it\nwill eventually come out and it'll\nusually come out at the wrong time so\nthe problem is a lot of times it comes\nout your your emotions and your things\nthat you've been repressed for so long\ncome out on the people that you don't\nwant it to so you know you might get a\nlittle bit stressed things are going off\nat work and then what happens you blow\nup on your children when you get home\nbut that anger is probably misplaced\nfrom something that happened to you\nyears ago a breakup that you didn't heal\nfrom something that your parents did\nwhen you were 12 that you never fully\nexpressed and your children are\nbasically just collateral damage for\nyour feelings that you never let\nyourself feel think about that for a a\nsecond a lot of times your children your\nspouse the people that you're closest to\nthat you love the most become collateral\ndamage for the feelings that you've been\ndepressing in your body in your life for\nso long and you never let yourself feel\nit's not their fault so what do we KN\nwhat do we need to do we need to we need\nto be able to have adult temper tantum\nevery once in a while everyone's out of\nthe house and you've just had a\nstressful day children aren't there wife\nisn't there and you just really need to\nget something out of you whatever it is\nyou need to do to have an adult temper\ntantrum to work out as tough as you\npossibly can to scream as loud as you\npossibly can into a pillow to punch your\nbed to beat a pillow against the bed to\nuh go to a kickboxing class to run until\nyou start to cry because it's so I don't\nknow what it is but whatever it is for\nyou figure out what feels the most uh\nauthentic for you to be able to get that\nout whatever it is that feels best for\nyou in that moment do it right just make\nsure you get it out of you make make\nsure first off that you're safe and\nsecond off that no one else is around\nyou that can make them feel unsafe and\nthen whatever it was it won't come out\nat the wrong moment at the wrong people\nand you could say you know what I'm I'm\nnot going to hold on to this anymore I'm\nnot going to hold on to this anger that\nI have towards this person towards my\nfather from when I was 9 years old I'm\ngoing to allow myself to feel it and\nexpress it it might be screaming it\nmight be crying it might be screaming\nand crying I don't know what it is but\nbut you have to allow yourself to get\nback to feeling your feelings and\nfeeling your humanness and one of the\nthings that you'll start to notice is as\nyou allow yourself start to release a\nlot of these things if you think you're\nthe type of person has a short\ntemper you don't have a short temper\nyou'll notice years down the road when\nyou start expressing all this stuff that\nyou don't really have much of a temper\nthe short temper was just a buildup of\nall of these emotions that you never let\nyourself feel all this Anger from your\nchildhood and your teenage years and\nbeing bullied that you never let\nyourself feel you didn't have a short\ntemper you just didn't process your\nemotions correctly you're not a a sad\nperson it's just maybe you didn't\nprocess those that sadness when you were\nyounger and so allow yourself just to\nkind of reconnect give yourself\npermission to be a human again uh\nbecause I promise you you can feel at a\nmuch deeper capacity than you know and\nas you start to get better at expressing\nyour emotions you'd also start to\nunderstand your emotions a whole lot\nmore and that is for a whole other\nepisode\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a massive favor there's a lot of\npeople in this world right now that are\ngoing through the exact same thing and\nneed to hear this if you could share it\non your Instagram stories and tag me in\nit Rob dial Jr r o d i a l
