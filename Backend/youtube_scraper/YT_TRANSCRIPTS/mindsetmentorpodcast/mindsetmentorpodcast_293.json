    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be teaching you how to build a life\nthat you love let's go ahead and dive in\nisn't the purpose to not struggle our\nway through life but to actually love\neverything that we do to love the\npassage of time to love the people that\nwe around love the situations that we in\nlove the challenges that come up it\nseems like it's the purpose right just\nto love life so why don't enough people\nlove their lives most people I find that\nmost people\ncontent they're okay they don't love\ntheir lives they don't hate their lives\nthey're content but there's this\nunderlying slight aggravation that they\nhave and I don't know about you but if\nI'm going to live this life I would like\nto have a life that I feel I love as\nmany aspects of as I possibly can it's\nfilled with stuff that I love I don't\nwant to do anything in my life that I'm\nnot in love with I want to be excited as\nmany moments as I possibly can in this\nlife that I live and I've been building\ntowards that I've been working towards\nthat it's not perfect yet but it's\ngetting really really good and I want to\ntell you exactly how to do it because I\nthink that's what we all should be doing\nI'm here to tell you though that the\nlife that you love is not just going to\nfall at your feet if you just do the\nsame every single day and have zero\nintentions and zero Clarity and zero\nDirection you're not going to love every\naspect of it but if you wake up in the\nsame way that you\nmeticulously if you were one of the best\npainters in the world You' be meticulous\nabout every single millimeter every\nsingle inch and making sure every single\npart of it was perfect before you put\nthat and actually sold it for a million\ndollars why don't you do the exact same\nthing with your life go through every\nsingle aspect of it and make sure that\nit is exactly what you want it to be I'm\ngoing to say something I think is is um\nis going to surprise a lot of people but\na life that you love doesn't just happen\nit doesn't but most people sit around\nand they're like I said they're content\nbut they're aggravated and they're like\nwhen is something going to change when\nis something going to change and my\nanswer is when you change that's\nwhen it's going to change your life\nisn't just going to change one day you\nwake up it's like oh my God my life is\namazing and I love it right you don't\njust wake up and one day it's all\nperfect it's built and it's built\nextremely intentionally extreme\nextremely\nmeticulously you have to plan it you\nhave to check that plan every single day\nand you have to execute on\nit I have a a friend that I talk about\noften in the he's a friend he's a mentor\nof mine who um I talk about often in the\npodcast and I've never mentioned his\nname on purpose but he's worth by the\ntime he was he was 40 years old he was\nworth over $100 million and I have never\nmet up with him to go get coffee and he\ndoes not have his journal with him and\nhe has his journal and in his journal is\nhis planner and on the very last page is\nall of his goals for the year and so not\nonly does he set his goals for the year\nhe also looks at it every single morning\nand goes over and tracks how he's doing\nand then he also brings it everywhere\nwith\nhim and then no joke like it's I'm I'm\ncurious how this guy got this life that\nhe has now and you know he's extremely\nsuccessful but he's also got one of the\nbest marriages I've ever seen he's\nextremely close to his kids and because\nhe was so meticulous in planning his\nlife he was able to basically quote\nunquote retire way early and now he\nspends the majority of his life just\nhanging out with his wife and children\nhe still works and he still works very\nhard but he doesn't have to work he does\nit because he wants to because it's fun\nand he does that while his children are\nat school and then when they're off of\nschool he's off of work and so I he's a\ngreat example for me to see of he is\nsomebody who has meticulously planned\nout his life he's paid attention to it\nevery single day he's taken action\ntowards it and he's built this amazing\nlife and everything in your life I want\nyou to know is changeable you are not\nstuck you might feel like you're stuck\nsometimes but you're not stuck you can\nchange your life at any moment now do\nsome things take longer yeah you know\nyou can't just immediately leave your\njob today if you don't enjoy it if\nyou've got bills to pay and a family and\nall that but can you make a transition\nyou know like a over the next two years\nsure and so it's really important for\nyou to start thinking about everything\nin my life can be changed so if there's\nsomething in my life that I don't like\nwell then I can change it and if I say\noh well you know I just have this job I\ndon't enjoy it but I did get my degree\nin it 12 years ago and so I'm just going\nto do this for the rest of my life oh wo\nis me I wish that I didn't have to do\nthis no that's your fault if you're\nstaying there what if you made a list of\neverything that you love and everything\nthat you need to change in your life and\nyou went through every single aspect of\nyour life and you figured out what you\nlove about it and you figured out what\nyou need to change in it right so like\nfirst off your sign significant other\nand you write down your significant\nother's name and then you ask yourself\nwhat do I love about them what is\namazing in our relationship that I love\nand then you ask yourself what needs to\nchange in our\nrelationship be real with yourself and\nthen you go to your relationship with\nyour family what do you love about your\nrelationship with your family what needs\nto change in your relationship with your\nfamily your relationship with your\nfriends what do I love about my\nrelationship with my friends what needs\nto change in my relationship with my\nfriends what about my job or my career\nor my company what do I love about my\ncompany what needs to change in my\ncompany what about uh people that you\nwork with or employees that you might\nhave what do I love about them what\nneeds to\nchange what about the house that you\nlive in what do I love about my house\nwhat needs to change about the house\nwhat about the car that you have what do\nI love about my car what needs to change\nabout my car what about the clothes that\nyou have what do I love about my clothes\nwhat needs to change about my clothes\nwhat about my mindset what needs to what\ndo I love about my mindset what needs to\nchange with my mindset what about my\nmorning routine what do I love about my\nmorning routine what needs a change in\nmy morning routine and you go through\nevery single aspect of your life you\nfigure out what you love about it you\nkeep whatever it is that you love and\nthen you figure out what needs to change\nand that at that moment is now on you it\nis now on you to make the change that\nyou want to and if you don't make the\nchange well that was your choice and if\nyou do make the change that was also\nyour\nchoice from the moment you wake up every\nsingle morning to the moment you go back\nto bed think about every single thing\nthat you do everything everyone that you\ncome in contact with every action every\nthought what's going on in your head and\njust write it down and say what do I\nlove about this what needs to change and\nthen you start making\nadjustments the life that you love is\nnot that far out of reach it just takes\nus to not be on autopilot so much it\ntakes you to be more intentional and\nhave more attention and intention in\nyour life and everything that's going on\nand realize that it like I said it might\nnot happen right away changes take time\nbut if change is going to happen you\nhave to be the person that does it but\nif I told you that you could have the\nperfect life for you in 10 years would\nthat excite you hell yeah it would\nexcite you that'd be the most exciting\nin 10 years you could have the perfect\nlife it might it might be okay right now\nit might be pretty good right now it\nmight be terrible right now but I'm\ntelling you what if in 10 years you\ncould have the perfect life would that\nexcite you would you want to hear more\nwell you'd have to realize that it could\ntake 10 years but if you were to get\ndown to the nitty-gritty and go through\nevery single aspect of your\nlife everything and say you know what\nwhat about this what about this what\nabout this what about this it'll\nprobably take you a year 2 years 3 years\n5 years at most before you open your\neyes and go holy this is amazing I\nlove this life that I've built and the\nthing is it's not the destination it's\nstart it's you're going to start to love\nit more and more and more the more that\nyou put time and intention into it and\nso I want you just to understand it\nwon't happen unless you actually put the\nintention into it and it's like you know\nlike imagine you just started a business\ntoday if you started a business you\nwould what would you do you'd start have\nyou'd have a business plan you'd have\nyou know quarterly reviews you'd have\nweekly reviews you'd have morning\nhuddles with your team start treating\nyour life like it's a business like\nyou're it's the business you're the CEO\nof this business and start creating a\nbusiness plan what is my business plan\nof this life and let's have quarterly\nreviews and let's have weekly meetings\nand let's have a morning huddle that's\nfive minutes where I say what am I going\nto do today what would make today\namazing it blows my mind because so many\npeople take their jobs more serious than\nthey take their lives I see it all the\ntime more people more more people take\ntheir their jobs in the company that\nthey don't own more serious than they\nactually take their\nlife they will show up for their boss on\ntime they'll show up and make sure they\nget things done when they say they're\ngoing to do something they'll do it and\nthen they go home and they don't have\nany plan they don't know what their what\ntheir direction is what they want to do\nand when they say TOS hey I'm going to\ndo this thing they don't actually do it\nso many people take their job more\nserious than they do their lives but\nit's really simple it's simple but it\ntakes time right you have to ask\nyourself and get extremely clear the\nmore clear the better what do I want in\nmy life what would a life that I\nabsolutely love look like or as I like\nto say what would a full yes life\nlook like where you wake up and you're\nlike yes this is amazing it's\npossible it might not feel like it at\nthis moment because we've never been\ntaught this we've never had had anybody\nsay this to us but it's possible to wake\nup and feel that way so it's plan it\nplan it out figure it out get really\nclear on what does it look like what\nwould a full yes life look like to\nme what would a life look like and what\nwould my relationship with my spouse\nlook like relationship with my children\nwhere would I live uh what would I be\ndoing with my time how would I spend my\nfree time how much money would be in my\nbank account how would that money have\ngotten into my bank account what would I\nspend my time working and doing and you\nstart to get really really clear\nand then what you do is you start to\nplan it out and as you plan it out you\ncan actually get step by step by step\nexactly how to do it and then what you\ndo is you review it as often as you\npossibly can and you make adjustments\nbecause I guarantee you this if you sit\ndown right now to make a 10-year goal\nand a 10 10-year plan that thing is\ngoing to need to move and shift many\ntimes over the next 10 years and so it's\nit's important to make sure that you do\nthat but it's also really important to\nsit down and make really meaningful\ngoals this is one thing that I don't\nthink people\ntake enough time to do like they'll say\noh you know what I want to buy a new\nhouse I want to lose 30 lb those are not\nmeaningful goals I mean meaningful goals\nin the fact of\nlike I want to take my family to Spain\nin three years and maybe you're broke\nright now and you've been struggling to\npay the bills recently but you're like\nin three years I want to take my entire\nfamily to\nSpain okay that's a goal of mine that's\na meaningful goal that's a goal that\nmakes me feel excited and feel\nalive let me figure out exactly how I'm\ngoing to make it happen because it might\nnot be possible yet but you can make\nadjustments in your life to make it\npossible that's a meaningful goal my\ngoal is to my son's about to start a a\nbaseball league I want to go to every\nsingle one of his baseball games this\nseason because last year I was only able\nto go to two of them and I was busy\ntraveling so a meaningful goal to me is\nto show up to all of my son's baseball\ngames this season right and start\nfiguring out what are meaningful goals\ngoals because we're taught to strive and\nto achieve and all of that is great but\nit's like what what brings the most\nmeaning to your life what are the goals\nthat make you feel the most alive it's\nyour\nlife shouldn't this be the thing that\nyou take more serious than anything else\nlike this is this is the thing that you\nshould take more serious than anything\nelse but all too often because of the\nfact that it's it's our life and it's\nwhat we've always had we don't really\ntake it that serious it's like asking a\nfish what it's like to be in water fish\nis like what are you talking about cuz\nit's always been surrounded by water it\nnever thinks about the water well you've\nalways been in this body you've always\nbeen the person you've been you\ncurrently are right now so it's like\nwhat if you take a step back and be like\nokay let me look at this life is this\nthe life I actually have is this is the\none that I have is it the one that I\nwant is it the one that I want to have\nin a year or two years or five years\nthis relationship that I'm in is it the\none that I want to be in in a year two\nyears or five years this the stuff\nthat's going on in my mind the way that\nI talk to myself is this the way that I\nwant it to be in a year or two years or\n5 years it's your life this should be\nthe thing that you take more serious\nthan anything else and so what I think\nit really comes down to is if you really\nwant to build a life that you love you\nhave to get very intentional about every\nsingle thing that you do in your life\nand you go through and you ask yourself\nin every aspect of my life what do I\nlove and write it all down because those\nare all the parts that you want to keep\nand then what needs to change and you\nbecome very intentional about taking the\nweeds plucking the weeds keeping flowers\nthe things that you love and then\nplacing new flowers in there cuz\nultimately it's your life no one is\ngoing to come and save you but if you\nput time and attention and planning and\nvision and\nClarity and you put it all down and you\nstart taking action towards it you will\n100% build a life that you love so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor share it on
