    "transcript": "welcome today we're going to be talking\nabout how to build a life that has no\nregret so that when you get to the end\nof your life you are excited about what\nyou created versus dying with regret\nlet's go ahead and dive in I use death\nas a way to motivate me to get the most\nout of my life to enjoy it more to do\nmore to achieve more to have more fun to\nmore have more love all of that and so\num it's really important I think to look\nat what people are doing when they're at\nthe end of their life and think like hey\nwhat do they do well what did they think\nwas good what do they think was bad and\nhow can I learn from that because just\nas Tony Robbins always says success\nleaves Clues I think that failure also\nleaves Clues I think that regret leaves\nleaves Clues as well and so there was a\nbook that was written years ago called\nthe five regrets of the dying and I I've\nbrought this pod I've brought this this\nbook up many times in this podcast but\num over an eight-year period there was a\nlady who worked in hospice care when\nhospice is basically when someone's you\nknow terminally ill they're going to die\nthey know that they're going to die and\nover eight years this nurse worked with\npeople and she would got really close\nrelationships with some of them and as\nthey were towards the end of their life\nthey started sharing some secrets with\nher and they started sharing happiness\nand love stories and amazing things but\nthey also shared a lot of regrets and so\nshe wrote a book on the five regrets\nthat she heard the most and I think it's\nreally important for us to know because\nif we can if success leaves Clues then\nregret and failure also these Clues so\nwhy don't we listen to these people who\nwent through their entire life and were\nat their deathbeds and went I wish I\nwould have done something different so\nthat we can make sure that we don't do\nthe same things that they did and so the\nfirst one and the most common one was\nthat I wish I lived a life that was true\nto myself and not the life that others\nexpected of me this was the most common\none is that I wished I lived a life that\nwas true to myself and not the life that\nother people expected of me isn't that\ncrazy most people live lives that allows\nthem just to fit in they don't follow\ntheir passions because they're too\nafraid of what other people might think\nor say when I ask people what their\nbiggest fears are one of the biggest\nfears that always almost always comes up\nis the fear of rejection and so a lot of\ntimes what people will do is they will\ndo what Society or what their parents or\nwhat other people think that they should\nbe doing and not actually follow their\npassions they want to be an artist or\nthey want to be a musician but their mom\nthinks they they should be an accountant\nbecause you can't make any money as an\nartist so then they become an accountant\nand their dreams slowly\ndie and so the main regret is not having\nlived a life that was true to themselves\nisn't that crazy to isn't it crazy that\nwe allow what other people think of us\nto come in the way of what we truly want\nand it's like we just kind of fit in a\nlot of times and you know it's like that\nthat Jim Carrey quote that says your\nneed for acceptance will make you\ninvisible in this world and so how can\nyou look at this and be like what is it\nthat I want not what my mom wants not\nwhat my father wants not what Society\nwants not what my spouse wants like what\ndo I want to do with my life you know we\nhave one life at least you know maybe\nthere's a heaven maybe there's a hell\nmaybe there's reincarnation maybe\nthere's not I don't know I've never been\nthrough any of those things but I do\nknow that I am here and I am Rob dial in\nthis moment and I know that I have this\none shot in this life and so we have one\nlife and we're floating on this tiny\nlittle rock through infinite amounts of\nspace through trillions and trillions\nand trillions of stars and planets and\nall kinds of other stuff and we let some\nother people's opinions or thoughts of\nus stop us from doing the one thing that\nwe want to do in this life isn't that\n crazy if you think about it not\neven and there usually the people who\nyou're you're whose opinions you're\nworried about if you look at their life\nyou're like yeah their life isn't even\nthat great right so like if you wouldn't\nwant to trade places with them why are\nyou going to take their advice you know\nand there was a uh a lady that was uh\nnamed Grace that she was talking about\nand uh the lady was one of the ones that\nregretted of not living a life that is\ntrue to herself and she said to the\nauthor she said live true to your own\nheart don't ever worry about what other\npeople think promise me that before I\ndie and so when we look at this what can\nwe learn from it knowing that if you're\nlistening to this and I'm speaking this\nthat we're currently still alive we need\nto figure out what it is that we want in\nour lives we need to figure out first\noff what is it we want and then we need\nto actually live life on our terms not\nhurt people or you know push people away\nor doing any of that type of stuff but\nit's like hey we want to live a life\nthat's on our terms if people don't like\nit hell with them that's just the way\nthat it goes this is your One-Shot at\nlife do what your passion about do what\nyou want to\ndo what is in the back of your mind that\nyou've been thinking about for so long\nbut you just haven't had the courage to\ndo you know if you can't stop thinking\nabout it don't stop working for it\nfigure out what what is the thing you if\nyou're you're 50 years old and you had\nthis passion when you were 23 years old\nand you gave it up for whatever reason\ncan you start to ReDiscover it and so\nthat's the first thing is that I wish I\nlived a life that was true to myself and\nnot the life that other people expected\nof me second one is that I wish I\nwouldn't have worked so hard you know\nand this is a that she said in the book\nthat a lot of this was what she heard\nfrom a lot of men and although you know\nI do really speak about working hard and\nI do love the fact that you can work\nhard and create your dreams and\neverything there does need to be balance\nat some point in time uh you know I did\nepisode a little while I was talking\nabout how yeah I worked 110 hours a week\nfor 3 years and I realized that's not\nlife cuz life is what is outside of work\nand so she was what was really sad is\nshe she talks about a man who worked\nreally hard uh for 15 years with a\ncompany so that he could save for\nretirement so that him and his wife\ncould go travel and then when he was\nsupposed to retire he decided to stay\none more year just to make sure that\nthey had enough money saved he figured\nhey I've worked for 15 years what's one\nmore more year my wife and I we still\ngot years left I'm going to go and get\none more year and then I'm going to\nretire and then my wife and I are going\nto go travel and she waited his whole\ntime that he was working where he was\nfinally going to\nretire and then three months before that\nfinal year that was the extra bonus\nfinal year three months before the final\nyear was over she died and him and his\nwife never got to travel and he was\nfilled with so much grief because all\nshe wanted to do was travel with him and\nto experience life with him and they\nshould have done it for 9 months but he\ndecided to delay it an extra year and\nthey never got there traveling and she\ndied three months before and so he was\nuh when he was at the end of his life he\nwas really sad because he said man I\nhave this I had this woman that was just\nwaiting for me to travel and she was so\nexcited and she wanted to experience\nlife with me and she didn't because I\nwanted to work harder I wanted to make\nmore money I wanted to feel like I\nachieved more and so he's you know\ntalking about how he had this wonderful\nwoman that waited so patiently for him\nto retire and then he was sitting there\nDying by\nhimself and so it's just something to\nthink about where it's like work hard\nwhen you're supposed to work hard sure\nbut also don't make your your work your\nlife so what can we learn from this it's\nokay to love what you do it's okay to\nwork hard it's okay to be really\npassionate about something but you also\nhave to just know that you have to have\nbalance your work is not your life your\nlife is what happens outside of your\nwork also don't work card just for\nmaterial things like never let buying a\nmaterial thing be a driver in your life\ndon't don't be like you know what I'm\ngoing to spend less time with my family\nso I can get a nicer car or so I can get\na a nicer house you know it's like Fight\nClub that that phrase advertising has us\nChasing Cars and clothes and working\njobs that we hate so we can buy stuff\nthat we don't need and so that's what we\ncan learn from it a little bit of\nbalance yeah sure work hard but also\nmake sure that you live your life so\nthat's the second one number three was\nthat I wish I had the courage to express\nmy feelings and in this she actually\ngives an example of a man who she took\ncare of who was a holocaust Survivor and\nhe went through so much in the Holocaust\nthat what he learned was to put up walls\nand to not fully let people in and he\nrealized at the end of his life he was\nreally sad because he felt like he never\nreally let anybody in he just kept his\narmor up all of the time and he was\nreally regretting because he felt like\nhis wife and his children never really\nknew who he was and turn he also felt\nlike he didn't really know who he was\nand so he's at the end of his life and\nhe saw yeah the Holocaust was a terrible\nthing that he had to go through but then\nhe actually carried it with him and what\nhe learned from the Holocaust and put of\nthese walls in this armor and didn't\nfully let people in and that was a\nreally big regret of his of like you\nknow what I wish I would have let my\nwife know who I am I wish I let my\nchildren know who I really am and so he\nregretted not being vulnerable with them\nand letting his true self out and so\nwhat can we learn from this when we look\nat it well you know we live in a societ\nespecially speaking as a man where um a\nlot of times we're told our feelings\naren't valid we're this isn't just from\na man's perspective it also happens with\nwomen as well but um you know we're\ntaught our feelings aren valid we're\ntaught that we're supposed to to shut up\nand just get stuff done and not pay\nattention to it but what happens is we\nend up you know going through life and\ngetting scars and a lot of times when we\nget scars we put up armor to protect\noursel and the the word vulnerability\nactually means to when you look at the\nroot word in Greek actually means the\nability to be wounded and so we have to\nunderstand that yeah we need to open\nourselves up we don't have to open\nourselves up to everybody and be\nvulnerable to everybody but are there\nsome people who you trust who you know\nhave your best intentions in life that\nthat really want the best for you that\nyou can show your true self to that you\ncan fully Express and not hold it all in\nand so that was number three is that I\nwish I had the courage to express my\nfeelings number four is that I wish I\nhad stayed in touch with my friends and\nso the author had all of these people\nthat were at the end of their lives and\nas they were at the end of their lives\nthey started thinking about how many\npeople that they knew that they haven't\nseen in so long that weren't showing up\nto say goodbye to them and they thought\nman I wish I would have stayed in touch\nwith my friends and a lot of them said\nthat they worked so hard that they\nactually lost touch with the friends who\nmattered the most and they were lonely\nat the end of their lives because they\nlet those friendships slip away and they\ngave up the friendships to work you know\nthey got busy with work they got busy\nwith family raising children and they\nregretted not keeping in touch with some\nother friends and letting everyday life\num come ahead of some of those\nfriendships so it's not like you don't\nhave to have a list of 30 people that\nyou need to stay in touch with but do\nyou have like a core group of people who\nactually you want to stay in touch with\nthat maybe you've lost touch with like I\nI know that a lot of you listening right\nnow you're going damn there's this one\nperson I haven't talked we've sent some\ntext messages we've sent some some funny\nmemes to each other over the past couple\nyears but we haven't really like had\nface Toof face uh time time and I'd\nreally like to rebuild that relationship\ncan you reach out to them today and so\nwhen we look at this what can we learn\nfrom it let's stay in touch with the\npeople who matter the most you know when\nwhen you get all of the money in the\nworld you won't be able to buy those\npeople back if those people are out of\nyour lives you won't if they die you\nwon't be able to pull them back with all\nof the money all the billions of dollars\nyou can make you know and so let's not\nlet everyday life and working and family\nget so busy that it gets in the way of\nother relationships right so who's a\nfriend that you miss that you haven't\nseen in a while\nreach out to them today do it do it\nright now take your phone out send them\na text hey how's everything going we're\njust thinking about you we should talk\nsoon go get some coffee if they're local\nor we should do FaceTime if they live in\nanother city so reach out to them today\nactually reach out to them right now as\nyou're listening to me um find some time\nto talk and and work on becoming close\nagain and then the fifth one which is\nreally just a a sad one and interesting\none is that I wish I let myself be\nhappier this one's really challenging\nbecause you know with with\nadvertisements constantly telling us\nthat we're not good good enough we're\nnot smart enough we're not thin enough\nwe're not pretty enough uh we don't have\nthe right cars and clothes and houses\nand we're not enough until we buy all\nthe that they have it's easy to\nthink that we're not enough and not\nallow ourselves to be happy the great\nthing about happiness and I've really\nbeen focusing a lot me personally as of\nrecently on my happiness and the great\nthing about it is that happiness is a\nchoice and this isn't some\nlofty fairy dust sprinkling phrase that\nI'm using happiness is really a choice\nlike there's some moments where I I can\nI can find myself getting like deep dark\ninto thoughts and like oh my God I got\nso much and this thing's wrong in\nthe business and this thing's wrong here\nand all this stuff I take a step back\nand I can notice some stress and I'm\nlike yeah but life's amazing\nlike and I'll go outside and it's it's\nnot based off of how much money is in my\nbank account or the people around me I\nshould look and I'm like man it's\nbeautiful it's a sunny day I I I have\nfood in my stomach I have water I have a\ncouple people who love me and it's like\nif we need you take yourself out of it\nit's like oh yeah you know what things\nare really good and as we try to we we\nwe achieve we we strive to achieve and\nAchieve and achieve a lot of times the\nachievement because the thing that we're\nworking towards we're not there yet we\nfeel like they're I'm not good enough\nyet because I'm not there yet and so we\ncan allow ourselves to be happy and\ngrateful at any moment and realize that\nwhat we currently have is enough and we\ncan learn to to to be grateful for all\nthose things we can learn to uh love\nourselves eles through selft talk and\nlearn to let go of the past and forgive\nourselves for things that have happened\nand forgive other people so that we can\nlet go of that anger that's still inside\nof us because we can't change anything\nthis from the past but we can learn from\nit and we can decide to be grateful and\nbe happy where we currently are and\nthere's so many people that get to the\nend of their lives and wish that they\nwould have let themselves be happier\nthat's the actual phrase in the book is\nthat I wish I had let myself be happier\nnot I wish I was happier I wish I let\nmyself have been happier you know and\nI've always heard ramda say it but like\nhe always says death is like taking off\na tight shoe it's just like we're so\nwe're so just you know white knuckling\nour way through life sometimes when\nsometimes we just need\nto take a deep breath just kind of chill\na little bit and so what can we learn\nfrom this make a list of things that\nmake you happy you know I've said this\nmany times in the podcast I had a friend\nthat was in really deep\ndepression and um years after I met him\nhe was already out of the depression and\nhe had built his successful business and\nhe's you know just got done writing a\nbook all these cool things and um he had\nsaid a phrase that I I don't think I'll\never forget he says I will not let my\nhappiness or my depression be left up to\nchance and so what he did is he made\nthis thing called a happy list and all\nthese things that make him happy the\nbiggest things or smallest things and he\nwould look at his happy list every\nsingle morning and he would look at his\nschedule and he would say how can I\nschedule in some of these things to make\nme happy and then he just became happier\nas he started doing it so it's a choice\nso what can we do to start bringing more\nthings they make us happy and so these\nare the five things that people die with\nwith regrets if we really want to be\nsmart why don't we try to avoid these\nthings why don't we try to make our life\num be better by knowing uh you know this\nis what people have died with in have\nregrets so the first one is I wish I\nlived a life that was true to myself and\nnot the life that other people expected\nof me number two is that I wish I hadn't\nworked so hard number three is that I\nwish I had the courage to express my\nfeelings number four is that I wish I\nhad stayed in touch with my friends and\nnumber five is that I wish I let myself\nbe happier so that's all I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please do me a favor right now\ntake out your phone uh share this
