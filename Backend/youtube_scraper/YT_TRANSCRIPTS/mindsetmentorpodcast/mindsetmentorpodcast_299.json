    "transcript": "and so one of the things I found with a\nlot of people is they wake up and they\ngo straight into reaction mode and\nthat's not the way to to really be\nproductive and to start actually getting\non a front foot and starting to move\nforward in the direction that you want\nand so at the night before give yourself\nfive minutes get out of journal and look\nback and on how today was for you how\nwas today what did you do well what\ncould you improve upon and then what you\ndo after you look back on today is you\nlook forward on tomorrow and you prepare\neach morning you visualize your day you\nprepare the of what you want your day to\nlook like and so instead of just going\nto bed waking up and being in reaction\nmode you wake up and you already know\nwhat you have for today you already know\nbecause you planned it the night before"
