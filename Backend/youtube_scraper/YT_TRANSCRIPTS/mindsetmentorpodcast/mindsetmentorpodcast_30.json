    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to be happier I'm going\nto teach you how to be more grateful I'm\ngoing to teach you how to focus on what\nit is that you want not what it is that\nyou don't want let's dive in my goal for\nthis episode is hopefully to reframe\nyour mindset in some way to help you\nthrough your day today and to have more\ngratitude for what you have and I'm\ngoing to take you through something that\nI've been doing a lot recently that has\nmade me so much happier and feel so much\nbetter every single day whether it's a\ngood day or whether it's a day where\njust hits the fan and it's all over\nthe walls it's just I I still feel this\noverwhelming sense of happiness and\npeace and so I want you to understand\nfirst off that if you take yourself out\nof your own head and take yourself out\nof your patternings and your your fears\nand your limiting beliefs and all that\nstuff life is amazing and I really want\nyou to understand that when I say it's\namazing I don't mean that it's perfect\nuh I don't mean that there's not some\n going down right now there's always\n going down and there always will be\nlike go back a 100 years there was a\nwhole bunch of happening go back\n500 years it was even crazier go back a\nthousand years 2,000 years people were\nnuts in the stuff that they were doing\nright so I want you to understand that\npeople are people people are as humans\nwe are animals and animals do have\nanimal Tendencies so there are some\ncrazy Rogue animals that do some crazy\nstuff\nbut what I really want you to do is I\nwant you to look at your life and\nunderstand that you can have more\ngratitude for everything that you have\nand the more gratitude that you have the\nbetter that you can show up for the\nworld the better that you can show up\nfor yourself the better that you can\nserve the world and the more changes you\ncan make in your life for the better I\nremember I was watching something like\n10 years ago and uh it was a comedian\nwho has now been you know basically\ncanceled so I won't say his name but he\nwas talking about how everything is\namazing and nobody's happy and he was\ntalking about he remembers the first\nflight that he was on where there was\nWi-Fi and they announced like Wi-Fi is\ngoing to be on the plane flight and\neveryone was like oh my God this is\namazing this is crazy and everyone was\nexcited and then the guy next to him is\nusing the Wi-Fi and he's all excited and\nthen like 20 minutes later the Wi-Fi\nstops working and the guy and the guy\nnext to him says this is and\nhe's like it was insane that this guy\nwas mad about something that he didn't\nknow existed 20 minutes ago and you know\npeople tend to think like Airline\ntravels the worst thing in the world\neveryone's like oh my God you know I got\nto get onto a flight and going to the\nairport's the worst thing everybody\nshould be amazed like I'm always amazed\nby by PL like we're on a plane that's\ngoing 600 miles an hour and it's this\nliterally this piece of aluminum that\nhas two giant fans that's making us go\nthis way it's a chair in the sky you\nknow 30,000 ft and you can go from New\nYork to LA in five or six hours like\nthat used to take 20 or 30 years and and\nyou and and we just think like oh this\nis the worst thing no this is the most\namazing thing you know another thing\nthat that we have that's just so amazing\nand there's so many amazing things when\nyou take yourself out of your own body\nand just like look at around you you\nrealize there's so many amazing things\nlike take for instance your phone if you\nlook at your phone it has a camera on it\nit has a camcorder like there used to be\na time when I was a kid when a camera\nand a

you forget the\nwallpaper's even there it's it's like\nyeah plane getting on a plane that's\namazing but we just forget that it's\namazing your phone it's amazing but you\nforget that it's amazing like I remember\nI was I had taken a like think about how\ncrazy this I had taken a plane flight\nfrom my house over to Italy and we went\n600 miles to get there then we're\nfinally there and I'm sitting there on\nmy phone and I got a notification while\nI was having a capino in Rome that there\nwas Motion in my front yard from a town\nthat was thousands of miles away and I\ncan take a look and I can go oh there's\nthe Amazon guy at my house and I can go\nthrough the speaker on my security and I\ncan say through the through the the the\nspeaker on the Ring Hey can you leave\nthe package on the doorstep and he\nleaves the package on the door like\nthat's if you actually think about it\ninsane that I can take a plane flight\nover to another country that used to\ntake I don't know 5 six months to get to\nif you were to take a boat and then take\na a horse to get there I can get there\nwhat 12 hours then I can see somebody\nand talk to somebody that's at my house\n8,000 M\naway and it's just like we don't even\nthink about how amazing these things are\nyou know like it we I can then text\nsomebody like a friend back home from\nItaly and they can get it near\nimmediately like my grandparents my\ngrandparents my father my grandfather\nwas in in World War II and they used to\nwrite letters to each other all the time\nlike they have this box that when they\nboth passed away we we knew that existed\nand we found it and it was all of these\nletters that they wrote to each other my\ngrandfather would write to my\ngrandmother from another country and she\nwouldn't get it for weeks and then she\nwould write him letters back and not\neven know if he's still alive and he\nwouldn't get it for weeks now we can\nliterally text somebody and they\nimmediately get it we can do FaceTime\nwith somebody and they can immediately\nget it my grandparents I had a\nconversation with them about the Great\nDepression about like what was like and\nit was insane what the Great Depression\nwas like for them like my grandparents\nwere my grandma was telling me you know\nshe was uh first generation American her\nparents came over from Poland and they\ncame over and her her father had a a\nshoe store and he had a grocery store\nand when the Great Depression happened\nhe felt so bad for everybody he just let\neverybody have the groceries that were\ninside of his grocery store and\nobviously his grocery business went out\nof his grocery store went out of\nbusiness so he had to figure out how to\nstart feeding his children and so they\nhad an empty lot next to their house and\nhe just had to figure out how to garden\nand he had to start gardening and my\ngreat-grandmother had to start gardening\nthen my grand great-grandfather had to\nfigure out a way to be able to start\nfishing so that he could feed his family\nlike there was no government support at\nthis time and they just talked me about\nhow hard it was like our life has gotten\nso good if you're listening to me right\nnow your life is so good you can think\nof your life it might be great it might\nbe good it might be terrible right now\nbut I guarantee you\nit's still amazing if you really give\nyourself some\nperspective if you're listening to me\nright now the quality of your life is a\naund if not a thousand times better than\na King's life was 500 years ago think\nabout that for a second your life right\nnow you would probably not trade to be a\nking 500 years ago in the 1500s your\nlife is way better you kidding me you\nlive better than a king did you have\nfood you have Water Shelter clothing\nsafety you don't have to worry about\nsomeone coming and attacking your castle\nand then all of us are like but I want\nmore I don't have enough I want to make\nmore money I want to make more things I\nwant to do more stuff I want to eat more\nfood and I want you to understand that\nthere's there's this thing that I've\nrealized over the past I don't know 19\nyears of working on myself is that you\nwill not be given more than you\ncurrently have if you Cann not be\ngrateful for what you have I don't claim\nto know how the universe works I don't\nknow but one thing that I I do know from\nat least anecdotal evidence uh in my own\nlife and what I've seen in other people\nthat that I know closely that are\nsuccessful or people who have a great\nlife that they love is that you will not\nbe given more than you currently have if\nyou can't be grateful for what you have\nif you think about it if you're not\ngrateful for what you have you're kind\nof like an adult that's a child that\nconstantly complains the universe or God\nor life or whatever it is that's out\nthere isn't going to trust you with more\nand until you become a good Steward for\nwhat you already have and so really what\nyou need to do is you I I would hope\nthat you do this and this is what I've\nbeen doing a lot\nrecently once I found out you know last\nyear that that Lauren was pregnant that\nwe're going to have a baby I started\nthinking about like all of the stuff\nthat you know all the things that could\ncome up from it I started thinking about\nhow amazing life is and how all of the\nthis just the challenges that I've had\nand the blessings that I've had and\nevery good and bad and all that stuff\nand just like how amazing it all was and\nso the one thing that I've been been\nfocusing on every day\nfor you know about the past year now is\nto set and the way I see it is in what\nI've been calling is like set my GPS for\nhow I want to feel today right and so\nI'm setting my GPS every single morning\nfor how I want to feel and so every\nsingle morning for about a year now I do\nbreath work and you could do you could\nfind breath work on YouTube and then\nthen you can go through and do it and\nthen what I do is I mentally and\nemotionally and physically all of that\nstuff set my GPS for how I want to feel\nsure there's things I want to accomplish\nthere's things I want to do for the day\nand there's my to-do list and there's my\nschedule and there's my business and all\nthat stuff but really what matters is\nlike how do I want to feel today when I\ndo my to-do list when I go into my\nbusiness when I talk to my employees\nwhen I'm on Zoom when I'm going and talk\nto somebody that at the cash register\nhow do I want to feel what is the the\nthe underlying feeling through all of\nthat and so what I've been doing a lot\nrecently is I've been and it's very very\nsimple been waking up I've been doing\nbreath work and then what I do is I\nthink of how I want to feel for the day\nand I just focus on on one feeling it\ncould be happiness it could be gratitude\nit could be Joy it could be love it\ncould be peace it could be calm whatever\nit is and I just imagine that there is a\nhole in the top of my head and that\nwhatever that feeling is is a liquid and\nI'm just pouring through the top of my\nhead and then what I do is I find three\nthings that I can be grateful for and I\njust start there and what's interesting\nis I my my goal is to only find three\nthings to be grateful for but once you\nfind one thing to be grateful for you\nstart finding a lot of other things to\nbe grateful for\nand it goes to the next thing and to the\nnext thing and to the next thing it\ndoesn't have to be like Oh I'm grateful\nfor my house or for the amount of money\nin your bank account it could literally\njust be I'm grateful for the sun coming\nout today I'm grateful for my breath I'm\ngrateful for my uh my air conditioning\nI'm grateful for my heartbeat I'm\ngrateful that I slept well last night\nI'm grateful for the breeze on my face\nwhat I found is that is that if you wake\nup in the morning and you think about\nwhat you don't have you will go through\nthe rest of your day focusing and\nfinding things that you don't have if\nyou start your day focusing on lack you\nwill find all of the lack that exists in\nyour life and we all have lack in our\nlife but if you start your day and you\nstart focusing on what it is that you\nhave and what you can be grateful for\nyour brain just naturally starts finding\nmore things to be grateful for and\nwhat's crazy about it is it just kind of\nsnow it's just it's kind of like an\navalanche just kind of keeps going and\ngoing and going and going going it's\nlike it starts off just like a little\ntiny bit of snow falling and then it's\nlike a whole lot of snow falling in this\nAvalanche and it's like I'm going to\nfocus on three things to be grateful for\nand then you realize 3 hours later that\nyour brain is still finding all these\nthings to be grateful for and so instead\nof going through your day with this\nfeeling of\nlack like I've done many times for years\nof my life I go through the day feeling\nof all of this abundance of everything\nthat I have and everything to be\ngrateful for and how great my life is\nand when I set myself up and I set my\nGPS for how I want to feel that way I\nfeel amazing throughout the day what you\nfocus on you will receive more of and\nyou will notice more of if you focus on\nwhat you don't have if you focus on your\nproblems if you focus on all of that\nstuff you will get more of those things\nand you will notice more of those things\nbut if you focus on what you're grateful\nfor you will get more things to be\ngrateful for and you will find more\nthings to be grateful for because\nultimately we think that something needs\nto happen externally outside of us to\nmake us feel a certain way like oh well\nif she acts this way then I will be\nhappy or if I get that bonus then I will\nbe happy or if I get this thing but\nthat's not the truth the it doesn't\nmatter what happens externally outside\nof you it is all an internal game when\nyou finally understand that this entire\nlife is just an internal game that\nyou're supposed to be playing and that\nyou just need to master your reactions\nto the world and figure out how you want\nto show up it doesn't matter what's\nhappens outside of you because it's it's\nyour reaction that that that changes the\nway that you feel and change the way\nthat you think and change the way you\nsee the world and so ultimately what I\nwould recommend for you is to try try to\nwake up every single morning and remind\nyourself of how amazing this life is\nthere are so many things to be grateful\nfor and if and I say this all the time\nbut if you have nothing else to be\ngrateful for you woke up today and\n150,000 people who are alive yesterday\nare not alive right now so if you have\nnothing else quote unquote nothing else\nto be grateful for you can be grateful\nfor the fact that you at least woke up\nbecause I guarantee you all 150,000\npeople if they had the opportunity would\nimmediately train change positions with\nyou right now if they could so you have\nsome stuff to be grateful for you just\ngot to search for it you got to find it\nand you've got to remind yourself of it\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories tag\nme in at Rob dial Jr r o d i a ljr and\nuh with that I'm going to leave the same\nway leave you ever single episode make\nit your mission to make somebody else's\nday better I appreciate you and I hope\nthat you have an amazing day"
