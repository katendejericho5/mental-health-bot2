    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the problem\nwith the way you've been setting goals\nyour entire life and the correct way to\nset your goals to become more addicted\nto take the action you need to to hit\nthem let's dive in today we're going to\nbe talking about your goals and we're\ngoing to be talking about how you know\ngoals are great but they're very very\nflawed and mind you I've been coaching\npeople now um about 18 years and what I\njust realized a few years ago was the\nwith them so for me like for 15 years I\nwas doing it wrong and I'm going to tell\nyou what I did wrong and how you cannot\ndo them wrong because they're completely\nF uh flawed more than anything else and\nwhat I used to do is I used to say hey\nyou know what I'm going to do and I I\nwould work with somebody and I'd be like\nhey let's write down your 10-year goal\nand people get excited about a 10-year\ngoal but the problem with that is that\nit seems so far away that for some\npeople especially a process driven mind\nit can actually be very demotivating\nbecause they don't think about\njust today they think about all\n3,650 days in the process of exactly\nwhat needs to be done in order to get\nthemselves to their goal in 10 years as\nif they have to do all of it today right\nfor some of you process driven people\nyou know what I'm talking about it's\nparalysis by analysis and so what we're\ngoing to talk about today is we're going\nto talk about the difference between\nprocess of your goals versus outcome of\nyour goals uh we want the outcome of our\ngoals we want to you know if we're like\nhey I want to have a multi-million\ndollar business that's the outcome that\nwe want we want the outcome but what we\nneed to focus on is the process and we\nneed to create goals around the process\nas well and so we what we what we really\nneed to do is we need to create goals\nwith the focus of what it is that we\nneed to do every single day to get us to\nthat outcome and I wrote about this in\nmy book and um you know if you if you\nbuy my book now I get paid nothing for\nit so I just think you should buy it\nbecause I think it's really good CU I\nput a lot of I put three years and 16\nrounds of edits into it but I talk about\nthis in my book my book is called level\nup if you want to buy it it's wherever\nbooks are available you can buy it I\ntalk about the difference between\naction-based goals versus results based\ngoals action-based goals versus results\nbased goals results based goals are when\nI lose 10 pounds I'll be where I want to\nbe um that is a results based goal when\nI make a million dollars in my business\nthen I'll be where I want to be those\nare both results based goals the result\nlosing 10 pounds the result making a\nmillion dollars a and that those are\nfine those are great and that's I did it\nfor years that's what I focus on but\nwhat we need to focus on is we and we\nneed to create around those our action\nbased goals what action do I need to do\ntoday in order to get me closer to\nlosing those 10 pounds what action do I\nneed to do today in order to get me\ncloser to making that million dollars in\nmy business what what actions do I need\nto take that are in alignment with where\nI want to go and I need to act in\nalignment with a type of person that I\nneed to be you know you want your you\nwant your actions to reflect the type of\nperson that you want to become and the\nreason why I have an entire chapter in\nthis in my book it is actually chapter\n12 is because we need to when we figure\nout what our goals are our outcome based\ngoals our results based goals then we\ncan create action based goals around\nthem and then we tap into something in\nour brain that's called the dopamine\nreward system and so uh what is dopamine\nmost people think that dopamine is a\nfield good chemical in the brain uh\ndopamine usually is categorized with\nserotonin as the feel-good chemicals in\nyour brain but dopamine is actually the\nchemical of motivation it is a very\nexternal based chemical which is I got\ndopamine I want to do whatever it is\nthat I need to do in order to get more\ndopamine uh serotonin is the chemical of\nHere and Now grateful for what you have\ndopamine is a chemical of more if you\nlook at the most addictive drugs in the\nworld they're all dopamine uh dopamine I\nthink the way you pronounce this\ndopaminergic uh based drugs and so which\nmeans like if you look at Like Cocaine\nfor instance when someone does cocaine\ntheir dopamine goes up by about 250% and\nwhen it drops guess what they want more\ndopamine and so we all are in some sort\nof way addicted to dopamine when you\ncheck your phone you get hit with\ndopamine when you um you know your your\nteam wins the game or scores a touchdown\nyou get hit with dopamine when you\ncelebrate yourself you get hit with\ndopamine it is the chemical that's\nreleased when we get excited about\nsomething when we celebrate something in\nsome sort of way um and that's really uh\none common trait that uh we all have\nanother when and when you look at like\ncommon traits for instance I always\nthink back like whenever I see someone\nwho is an incredible achiever I'm always\nalways like what what's common among\nlike what are they doing what what makes\nthem different than other people one of\nthe common traits that I see among the\ngreatest Achievers in our lifetimes\npeople like Kobe Bryant people like\nMichael Jordan people like the greatest\nthe greatest CEOs that are out there um\nthey they work really hard they're\ndedicated they're obsessed all of those\nare definitely true but more than\nanything else I think they fell in love\nwith the\nprocess and they fell in love with how\nthe process of going to create something\nmade them feel and I know people are\nalways like I know someone who's worth\nabout $4 billion and he works harder\nthan almost anybody else that I know and\npeople are always like why don't why do\nyou stop why don't you stop working and\nthe thing is he never did it for money\nhe loves the process of waking up\ncreating something and building\nsomething every single day that's what\ngives him dopamine and so it was never\nabout the money the money was just a\nbyproduct of the of the fund that he was\nhaving by Bill\nright and so the the most successful\npeople that we look at the greatest\nAchievers are usually people that just\nlove the process they like doing what\nthey're doing people who don't\nunderstand are like well if you're so\nrich why don't you just retire because\nit was never about that in the first\nplace they get joy a lot of times from\nactually going and creating something\nand and achieving something and so um\nmost of us don't know but when you look\nat someone like Kobe Bryant who I write\nabout inside of my book um he developed\na dopamine reward system that was\nattached to the process and so um I'll\ntalk more about that but what is a\ndopamine reward system it is a way to\nget your brain to release some dopamine\nafter you accomplish a task that is part\nof your process so instead of focusing\non an outcome or you know a results\nbased goal if we focus on a a process\ndriven goal a process driven goal means\nthat we could get dopamine which our\nbrain loves and our brain wants to get\nmore of multiple times today versus\nversus when I lose 10 lbs in 4 months\nand so um in the context of a dopamine\nreward system dopamine is released in\nresponse to a rewarding or pleasurable\nstimuli the good thing about rewarding\nor pleasur stim rewarding or pleasurable\nstimuli is that those both are\ncompletely subjective they're completely\nup to you and when your brain releases\ndopamine it signals to the brain that\nthe behavior that led to the reward\nshould be repeated in the future\nso let me say that again when your brain\nreleases dopamine and your the dopamine\nsignals to the brain that the behavior\nthat just\nhappened that whatever caused that\nreward should be repeated in the future\nand so um it's really important to\nunderstand because this is uh when you\nlook at dopamine dopamine dopamine\nreinforces the neural connections that\nwere involved in the behavior of\nwhatever it is that you just did making\nit more likely that behavior is going to\nbe repeated in the future and so this is\nthe problem with results based goals\nversus process based goals right so the\nproblem with the results based goal is I\ndon't release dopamine until I achieve\nmy\ngoal if my goal is months down the road\nor years down the road my brain's not\nreleasing dopamine which means that I'm\nnot falling in love the process which\nmeans that I'm not going to it's going\nto make it harder for me to show up the\nnext day and it's you know that could be\nyears down the road until I achieve that\ngoal I know I have felt this way in\nbuilding my business I will not be happy\nuntil we get to this I will not\ncelebrate myself until and so it's not\nmotivating you because it's not\nreleasing\ndopamine dopamine is the chemical of\nmotivation the chemical of wanting more\nso this is why action-based goals are\nmore important than results based goals\nsure you know you could say I want to\nlose 10 pounds that's great but if you\nwait until you lose 10 PB until you\nrelease dopamine you'll probably give up\nbefore you lose those 10 PBS but if you\ncreate a action based goal around it\nwhich is every day I just need to do\nsome form of movement that could be yoga\nthat could be running that could be\ngoing for a walk that could be going to\nthe gym that could be lifting heavy and\nthen every single time that I do it then\nI will celebrate myself I will be\nexcited about myself I will say\ncongratulations you're doing such a\ngreat job I'm so proud of you just that\nlittle bit of Celebration no joke this\nis literally found by scientists and\npsychologists that just that little bit\nof celebrating yourself releases\ndopamine which makes you want to do it\nagain because the action that happened\nbefore the brain released dopamine is\nactually starting to get high hardwired\nbecause the brain wants to get more and\nmore dopamine and so this is why um\naction-based goals are way more\nimportant to celebrate immediately while\nyou're doing it because the dopamine and\nreleasing the dopamine means you're more\nlikely to do it again and so it's not\nabout achieving the\ngoals what it's more than anything else\nit's about falling in love with the\njourney and so we're trying to trick our\nbrain into falling in love with the\njourney and if you fall in love with the\njourney guess what happens you'll\neventually achieve the goal that you\nwant to there's many people that I know\nthat were overweight I have one friend\nspecifically who is 100 pound overweight\nand um she loves working out now she was\nway overweight and now she loves working\nout the act of working out because she\nshowed up for herself she showed up for\nherself she released dopamine she\ncelebrated herself she liked the way\nthat she looked in the mirror she was\ngetting a little bit better and she\nstarted to become a little bit addicted\nto the process and now she wakes up at\nyou know 4:00 in the morning and wakes\nup and before her kids wake up and works\nout every single\nmorning she lost 100 pound and so she\nfell in love with the process and in\nfalling in love with the process the\nresults ended up coming so instead of\nsaying I'll only be happy when I hit the\ngoal it's like I'm going to celebrate\nmyself I know I'm going to consciously\ncelebrate myself so that my brain will\nlease dopamine and I will want to fall\nin love with the process and do it more\noften and you make the goal\nokay I'm going to lose 10 pounds and\nthen you just focus on the actions that\nyou need to take the results don't\nreally matter what matters is the\nactions that you need to take right uh\nbecause we have we have problems and\nthis is why it's really important for\nyou understand we have problems as\nhumans with delayed gratification we\nwant everything now but that's not how\nthe world Works everything great takes\ntime but we can hijack the system and\ngive us instant gratification now for\nthings that won't happen for a while and\nso if you're saying well I only want I I\njust want to you know I'd rather eat a\npizza right now uh versus working out\nwell Pizza is going to release some\ndopamine you're going to start loving\nthat pizza right but you could also say\nto yourself I'm going to work out I'm\ngoing to celebrate myself and it's also\nbeen found that if you have a tiny P\nlike just one square of chocolate after\na workout it also releases dopamine\nright like don't eat an entire candy bar\nbut we can hijack the system and give\noursel instant\ngratification from the the dopamine\nby celebrating our by and we celebrating\nour after doing the thing that we needed\nto do the action that will get us closer\nto our goals and so you know if you look\nat that you can say oh my gosh like\nhumans are not good with inst in we're\nnot good with delay gratification we\nprefer instant gratification okay can I\ngive myself instant\ngratification right now I can when you\nlook at something like delayed\ngratification you go to the gym now you\nsee results months down the road go to\ncollege for four years then you get a\ndegree that's four years down the road\nand then you save for retirement and\nyou're retired 20 30 years those are\nabout delayed gratification instant\ngratification um you know you really\njust think about it and you're like okay\nI'm getting rewarded right now for what\nit is that I want a lot of times the\nproblem is that we are wanting a reward\nimmediately that doesn't line up with\nour long-term goals can we reward oursel\nimmediately by taking an action right\nbefore that reward that lines up with\nour long-term\ngoals you know with delayed\ngratification the reward comes way later\non down the road and it makes it easy to\ngive up because it's like well you know\nI got to work so hard to lose these 10\npounds it's so far down the road to lose\nthese 10 pounds an immediate reward\nisn't going to happen just from going to\nthe gym you're not going to wake up and\nyou're immediately going to have abs but\nthe immediate reward is you celebrating\nyourself it's looking yourself in the\nmirror and saying I'm so proud of you\nfor doing this this is amazing and hey I\ngot you a little tiny piece of of\nchocolate go ahead and eat this piece of\nchocolate and then your brain releases\ndopamine and you go hey you know what I\nkind of like that I'd like to do that\nagain tomorrow habits become easier when\nyou can find pleasure in doing them they\nbecome really hard if you have to force\nyour way to do it and I've I've forced\nmy way to habits many many years and\nit's really hard to do but when you can\nenjoy your your way there it makes it so\nmuch easier to create habits and it can\nbe as simple as just being proud of\nyourself for showing up and taking a\nstep in the right direction and a lot of\ntimes times doing the things that you\nreally didn't want to do and so it\nsounds insane I get it it sounds like oh\nI gosh I can just celebrate myself and\nand I start falling love with the\nprocess it sounds like something woo woo\nand way out there but it's actually\nbased in science there's multiple books\nthat's written written about this BJ fog\nwho is a um uh professor at Stanford\nwrote a book called tiny habits and um\nand so it just shows that the process of\nactually figuring out how to create\nhabits how to develop a dopamine reward\nsystem how to break how to celebrate\nyourself and with that dopamine reward\nsystem it will make you more likely show\nup tomorrow and so the problem with our\ngoals is that we focus too much on the\nfuture and that future could be like I\nsaid in the very beginning of this\npodcast episode let's sit down and write\nyour 10year goal but 10 years is 10\nyears from today it seems way too far\naway is what I found so it's like how\ncan we celebrate today how can we\ncelebrate today how can we celebrate\nmult multiple times 20 times a day\ninstead of cing celebrating yourself\nafter you get done with the gym and you\nget done with your workout celebrate\nyourself after every single set that you\ndo and then you get dopamine 10 20 30 40\n50 times during a workout after the\nworkout it makes you more likely to show\nup the next day and so what it comes\ndown to is yes you definitely want\nlong-term goals you definitely want to\ncreate New Year resolutions you\ndefinitely want to have a five-year goal\na 10 year goal all of that but what you\nreally need to do after developing the\nthe the results based goal is to find an\naction-based goals and then you figure\nout what are those goals that you need\nto have for today that need to be done\ntoday multiple times today that I can\nhave an opportunity to celebrate myself\nbecause if I can have an opportunity to\ncelebrate myself I can actually have an\nopportunity to get myself addicted to\nthe process yes this is possible to\nbecome addicted to the process of what I\nneed to do that will eventually get me\nto years down the road achieving my\ngoals so that is a new way to create\ngoals if you love this episode please do\nme a favor share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in it Rob dial Jr r o\nd i a l Jr uh the only way this podcast\ngrows is from you guys sharing it so I\ngreatly greatly appreciate every single\ntime that you share it and allow more\npeople who have never heard of it before\nto actually find it again so if you'd\nshare it I would greatly appreciate it\nand with that I'm going to leave you the\nsame way I leave you
