    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to develop\nan alter ego another version of yourself\nto help you take action and create the\nlife that you want let's dive in today\nI'm going to be talking to you about\ndeveloping your dark side now it doesn't\nalways have to be just dark just so you\nguys know but that's what we're going to\nkind of dive into is we're going to talk\nabout what it would look like to step\ninto the most badass version of yourself\nand we're going to talk about the idea\nof an alter ego and uh to basically see\nwhat it would be like to pretend that\nyou are someone else to uh it's it's\nbasically like wearing a mask that you\ncan wear at all times or anytime that\nyou feel like you need it and so the the\nreason why it's it's important is\nbecause when I say as I'm actually\nsaying this out loud to you guys just a\nsecond ago to pretend you are someone\nelse the very first thing that popped in\nmy head is we're all pretending to be\nwho we currently think we are because\nwe're not who we think we are we're just\nplaying this character every single day\nand we're waking up and subconsciously\njust deciding to be this character every\nsingle day and you know when you look at\nyou've heard me say before if you've\nlisten to this podcast for a while when\nyou look at the word personality the the\nactual root of that is Persona and\nPersona was the mask that Greek actors\nwould wear in theater on stage and so\nwho you think you are is also just a\nmask that you are wearing and pretending\nto be nowhere is it written into the\nfabric of this universe that you have to\nbe who you currently are like you can't\nchange bodies you can't change the the\nphysical aspect well I guess you can't\nchange the physical aspects you can lose\nweight you can gain weight you can gain\nmuscle all that stuff but you can't like\nchange out your body for someone else's\nbut you can absolutely 100% change out\nyour personality at any moment because\nyour personality is just a set of\nbeliefs of who you think that you are\nand you know that your personality is\nbuilt based off of all of the people\nthat you interacted with up until this\nvery moment what your parents said to\nyou uh what your Society said to you\nwhat you learned from other people at\nany point you can decide to be someone\nelse and if you've been listening this\npodcast long if you know that one of my\nfavorite podcast one of my favorite\nepisodes uh one of my favorite quotes\nexcuse me uh is that you're under no\nobligation to be who you were five\nminutes ago Alan watt says that all the\ntime you were under no obligation to be\nwho you were 5 minutes ago and so that\nthere's aspects of yourself that you\ndon't necessarily feel fitt into your\nfuture change them you're not a tree you\ndon't have to stay in the exact same\nspot you can change at any moment and so\nuh how can you release who you are how\ncan you get to the point where you start\nto step in to the person that you could\nbe step into the person that you could\nbecome and so when I say Alter Ego it\ncould be a couple different things it\ncould be hey I'm going to decide to be\nthis Alter Ego all of the time or as\nI'll give you a couple examples of of\nother people who have used it you can\nuse your Alter Ego your dark side at any\ntime that you want to so you can be who\nyou currently are normally and then you\nget into a point where you're like maybe\nyou're just you're you're sweet and\nyou're amazing around your family and\nthen you get into the boardroom and\nyou're just an assassin right that could\nbe you if that's what you want and so\ndeveloping an alter ego can help you\nfind uh hidden potential to achieve\ngoals that quote unquote you right now\nmight not be able to do because that's\njust not something that you quote\nunquote you do it might be out of your\ncomfort zone you might be oh you're just\nshy oh you're just not that type of\nperson so it's like all right what if we\ndevelop this Alter Ego that when you\nwant to click it in you can just\nimmediately be that person and act as\nthat person would be um not just be like\noh well that's not me that's not what I\ndo no it's like hey I'm going to be\ndifferent I'm going to decide to be a\ndifferent person and we can all tap into\ndifferent sides of us and different\npersonalities at any moment when we need\nto you know it's like when I when I see\npeople and I talk to them and I coach\nthem and say sit down with them a lot of\ntimes I'm realizing wow this person just\nthinks that that's who they are and I\ncan my job as someone who's coaching\nsomebody is to see through their\n to see through who they think\nthey are oh I am this way because of\nthis I am this way because of this I'm\nlike no you're choosing to be that way\nbecause of things that have happened to\nyou in your past it is 100% a choice but\nyou could change at any moment if you\nreally truly want to and this can really\nstart to help you get past what you\nperceive as your\nlimitations what you perceive as your\nlimitations and I had a friend FaceTime\nme yesterday his name is Nick Stanton\naaso Nick is an incredible speaker he's\non stage with Tony Robbins all the time\nhe speaks in front of 9,000 people and\njust lights up the entire crowd he was\nborn with no legs he was born with one\narm and on that one arm he's got one\nfinger and you could look at him and\nthink like I was talking to him\nyesterday and we were FaceTime and I was\nlike you have every excuse to be\ninsecure you have every excuse to be\nlike I can't do this you have every\nexcuse used to be like I'm not going to\nget on stage in front of 9,000 people\nthose could be perceived limitations but\nhe doesn't perceive any of that as\nlimitations when in reality there's\nother people out there who have had not\na whole lot of challenges in their life\nand they have all the working arms and\nall of the working legs and things are\nokay and they're like I can't do this\nbecause of this and it's all just\nlimitations that we place on oursel and\nwe perceive to be in our way but they're\nactually not really there in front of us\nand this isn't some crazy thing that\nsome weirdo will do where they're like\noh I'm going to be somebody else right\nthere's many many examples over years\nand years and years of famous people\nthroughout the years who have had alter\negos years ago Beyonce created an alter\nego called Sasha Fierce to help her\novercome her shyness and become a more\nconfident performer uh Lady Gaga created\nuh Joe Calderone and Lady Gaga created\nthe altero Joe Calderone as a way to\nexpress her masculine side David Bowie\nis known for having Ziggy star\nand he created the alter ego Ziggy\nStardust to help him achieve success as\na musician and to be more out there and\nbe a better performer and be more\nflamboyant and more theatrical and you\nknow it helped him develop his music\nside you have examples also of of many\ndifferent movies Bruce Wayne always was\nBatman Clark Kent Superman you know if\nyou look at people that are out there\nthat are speakers like David gogin he\nhas goggin whenever he needs to go to\nhis dark side whenever he's in the\nmiddle of a 200 mile run and he's\nsitting there thinking I don't think I\ncan do this he clicks into another side\nof him that he calls goggin which is\njust a straight up assassin and he's\nlike I'm going to get there if I break\nall of my bones I'm still going to\nfigure out a way to do it you know Kobe\nBryant had the Black Mamba and so this\nisn't like a thing that I'm just making\nup this is something that is actually\nlegitimately something you could do I\nhave a friend who actually wrote a book\non Alter Ego in in developing that alter\nego and so when you look at yourself how\ndo you create your Alter Ego how do you\ncreate how do you decide how you want to\nbe how do you create that alter ego and\nand really what it it comes down to and\nwhat I want you to think about is what\nare the qualities of and traits that you\nwish you had right not the the ones that\nyou have or any of that what are the\nones that you wish that you had oh you\nknow what I wish I was more outgoing I\nwish I was uh not so afraid of\nXYZ and so it's like what are you take a\npen and paper and you write down what\nare the qualities what are the traits\nthat you wish you had the traits that\nwould help you\nsucceed and then what you do is you\nstart create uh you start creating an\nalter ego that embodies your best\nqualities that you have like the\nqualities that you want to keep and the\nones that you want to create you're\nbasically creating a Frankenstein\nversion of a human you who you want to\nstep into so if you're like you know\nwhat I want to be more confident okay\nwell I'm going to develop an alter ego\nwho is just confident as can be not\ncocky just confident\nokay I'm going to develop an alter ego\nthat whenever they decide to do\nsomething they do it they finish what\nthey start I'm going to develop an alter\nego that no matter what gets in my way\nI'm going to plow through it normally I\ngive up on things that I'm going to\ndevelop an alter ego that just doesn't\neven know what giving up is I'm going to\ndevelop a Alter Ego that has a No Matter\nWhat attitude matter what happens I'm\ngoing to do it you know what also I'm\ngoing to do though as you know it could\nthink just dark siding could be hardcore\nbut it could be like I'm going to\ndevelop an alter ego that is Kinder I'm\ngoing to develop an alter ego that is\nmore loving um my uh VP of operations on\nmy team her name is Britney and uh\nBritney uh was you know raised by by her\nher uh father is hardcore military and\nso she was she was really like taught\nmilitary stuff and she developed a\nreally really strong um masculine sign\nto her and uh and it worked decently in\nbusiness for a while and then she\nstarted to realize she was overly\nmasculine she was too hardcore and so\nshe wanted to develop the more loving\nside of her in business and so when she\ncame over to our our our company she we\nstarted talking about Alter Egos and\nlike who does she want to be now that\nshe's left this company that she was at\nfor nine years and she doesn't want to\nbe as masculine as she was she could\nbring a masculine inside she could bring\na feminine inside she could build this\nthis version of self of who she wants to\nbe and she developed what she calls and\nit's you know we're going to talk about\nnaming your Alter Ego the love Sergeant\nwhich is like she's she comes from a\nplace of love all the time she's very\nloving but she's also very you know\nformal and hardcore like a sergeant\nwould be and being on time and so the\nlove Sergeant is her Alter Ego that she\nsteps into whenever she's working and so\nit doesn't have to be like just a\nstraightup killer hardcore dark side but\nit's more of like who do you want to be\nmore right so like you can develop if\nyou really want to you can develop\nmultiple alter egos you could you could\nhave an alter ego um or even just the\nversion of you that you truly want to be\nwhen you're at home with your family\nwith your kids and you can have the most\nloving version of being a father or a\nmother that you've ever had but then\nwhen you get on a sales call at work\nyou're just a straightup assassin\nwhatever it might be you can have\nmultiple ones it's like a shirt that you\ndecide to wear you know if you're going\nto the gym you're not going to wear your\nsuit to the gym you're going to wear\nyour workout outfit and when you go to\nthe office then you'll be wearing your\nshirt and tie and so you can decide to\nkind of flip through them if you want to\nthey're are no rules to this game\nthere's no rules to this life thing\neveryone acts like there's rules because\nyou know Society has quote unquote rules\nthat someone no smarter than you made up\na long time before you were ever born\nright so make a list of all of the\nqualities that you want your Alter Ego\nto have and then as I said you must name\nit so to help bring it to reality you\nhave to remember it right and you have\nto give it some sort of name so what is\nthe name that you're going to give\nyourself that Alter Ego okay and then\nwhat you want to do to help it help\nbring it into reality is to have an item\nthat helps you remember it so um my\nfriend who I was talking about who wrote\nthe book Alter Ego whenever he wants to\nstep into his alter ego he has a set of\nglasses that he puts on like nice\nglasses that he wears on stage and then\nwhen he goes home he takes the glasses\noff and he's his you know version of\nhimself that he wants to be at home with\nhis wife and his children when he gets\non stage The Confident version of\nhimself the alter ego wears glasses so\nhe's got a name for it and he's got a\nphysical to help him remember so you\nknow something that you puts on his\nglasses but it's something you could see\nand feel it could be you know like a\nreally amazing ring that you put on it\ncould be a necklace that you put on it\ncould be a set of glasses like him that\nremind you to step into that um and and\nto see it and feel it and just to\nremember to have you step into who that\nversion of you is and it's like you know\nif you dress up sometimes like if you\ndress up you put on a suit and tie if\nyou're a guy if you're a woman you put\non a dress you present you first off you\nfeel and you present differently\nbased off of just the clothes that\nyou're wearing it happens for most\npeople so why can't you do the same\nthing here you know this isn't just for\nfor famous people and for athletes and\nall of that I know uh an executive coach\nin her Alter Ego is to overcome her fear\nof public speaking and um she her what\nit was she developed an alter ego to\nhelp her overcome her fear in her public\nspeaking and she named it and she's\nbecome an incredibly successful keynote\nspeaker but she started off being ter\nterrified of public speaking and she's\nlike the the version of me that I want\nto be the alter ego needs to be somebody\nwho walks on stage and they're confident\nall right now she's a super successful\nkeynote speaker she gets paid like\n$75,000 a talk now I just want you to\nstart thinking about this uh because and\nbe aware like your your old self is not\ngoing to die easily it'll continue to\npop up over and over again and you'll\nnotice yourself slipping into Old fears\nand old limiting beliefs and old\nthoughts that no longer serve you and\nI'm not good enough and I'm not smart\nenough and I'm not pretty and I didn't\ncome from a great family and all of\nthese things and it's like you've got to\nbe able to notice it and click back into\nwho you were and you need to really kind\nof develop a a really Keen sense of\nawareness and so the first thing is your\nawareness you need to be aware of when\nyou need to change your your your\npersonality into your alter ego but also\nwhen you slip back into old versions of\nyourself that you're trying to change so\nyou need to have the the\nawareness second thing that you need to\nis the practice which is the naming\nstepping into that uh putting on like I\nsaid a piece of jewelry or glasses or\nsomething physical that makes you think\na watch that makes you think of stepping\ninto that person and then it needs to be\nrepetitive it needs to be something that\nyou do start to do often you do it over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain like mind you fy it's not going to\nyou're not going to be a different\nperson uh completely in a week of doing\nthis but do this for a year you're going\nto see massive changes in yourself um\nyou know Kobe Bryant his alter ego the\nblack Mamba he named after he saw uh\nKill Bill um in 2003 and you know his\noncore personality was this Fierce\nRelentless competitor who is willing\nwilling to strike at any moment just\nlike a a black mamba would and the way\nto motivate himself to get in the right\nmindset of for games is he would tell\nhimself he was stepping into the black\nmamba right and he believed that by by\nreally deciding to adopt this\npersonality of black mamba he was able\nto tap into his full potential as a\nbasketball player and he was known for\nhaving these really hardcore intense\ntraining that he did that nobody else\nwould do and his his ability to maintain\nfocus and mental toughness when he was\npracticing and he was on the court uh he\ncredited actually to his alter ego\nhelping him to achieve those qualities\nso how can you understand that for\nyourself like how can I tap into this\nAlter Ego to help me get past of my\nperceived limiting beliefs and fears so\nthat I can tap into a new version of\nmyself um there's an interview that that\ncubby Bryant did with GQ Magazine where\nhe explained that the Black Mamba\npersonality helped him separate his\npersonal life from his basketball life\nbecause you know he loved his his wife\nand his daughters and he was like I\ndon't want to I I I love that version of\nme but that version of me can't exist on\nthe court right there can't be a loving\nversion of me on the court and so it\nallowed them to to suus focus really\nlike solely on the task at hand of just\nbeing an assassin on the court\nhe also said that the difference between\nKobe Bryant and the Black Mamba was that\nthe Black Mamba was really calm and\nfocused Under Pressure where he said\nhimself he wasn't when he was off the\ncourt um and so that's really like a key\nfactor that he was able to develop\nwithin himself when he was in really\nreally high pressure situations and so\nwhat it comes down to is the idea of\nacting as if and I hear people being\nlike Oh act act as if it's stupid okay\nit's not actually in my opinion it's not\nI've coached many people have had this\nreally really help them to decide to\njust act as if you're somebody else\ndifferent today like decide who you want\nto be and just like you wear a T-shirt\nand you wear it for a day like just try\nit on and see if you like it you know if\nyou're very shy and you want to be more\nconfident and you want to be more\noutgoing and you want to walk into a\nroom differently when you go to\nStarbucks today try that shirt on walk\ndifferently see if you if you if your\nbody responds differently to your mind\ndeciding to be someone different when\nyou go out there normally you just be\nvery quiet whenever you're checking out\nand and you're at Starbucks why don't\nyou have a conversation with a person\nthat's behind the counter if somebody\nelse is waiting with you go ahead and\nhave a conversation with them just see\nwhat it's like to try to be somebody\nthat you're not if you don't like it you\ncan always go back to the old version of\nyourself but why don't you just kind of\ntest the boundaries of who you are cuz\nas you really start to test the\nboundaries of quote unquote who you are\nwho you think you are\nyou'll realize there are no boundaries\nthey're just these these the straight\njacket that you've put yourself in and\nsaid this is who I am and this are my\nbeliefs and this is how I act you can\nchange it at any moment if you truly\ndecide that that's something that you\nwant and one of the ways to do that is\nthrough your Alter Ego so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this
