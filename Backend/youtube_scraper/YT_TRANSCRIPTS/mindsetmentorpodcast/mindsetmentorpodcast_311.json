    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to use your ego for\ngood to help you create the life that\nyou want let's dive in now we live in a\nworld where ego has a really bad\nconnotation if you think about it like\nwe hear things like oh man his ego is\nway too big or her ego is taking over uh\nthat's you know that's just his ego\ntalking that's that's her egoic side\nright and we think of ego as being this\nreally bad thing but is it possible that\nwe could identify our ego first off\nidentify the ego and then use it for\ngood once we identify what we could use\nit for good for is it possible that we\ncould do it I think that it is um I do\nthink that it's possible that our ego\nwill never go away I think one of the\nmain problems that people have is that\nthey try to fight their ego they\nidentify aspects of themselves in their\nego that they don't like and then\ninstead of accepting that their ego was\nlike that and that that's kind of built\ninto their programming and their system\nthat they fight it but there's a pretty\ngood chance that it will never go away I\nthink it's a full on possibility like\nfor and this took me years to understand\nlike probably 15 years of working on\nmyself of realizing there's parts of\nmyself that I didn't like and I would\nfight them and I would fight them I\nfight them and I I didn't like them and\nthen 15 years later I'm like I'm still\ndealing with the same and then I\nthought to myself and I started doing\nyou know uh learning about different\nfrom different spiritual people across\nthe world and I realize that they're all\nbasically saying like your ego is there\nthe problem is not your ego the problem\nis that you're fighting it and you're\nnot accepting it and I think it's now\npart of our psychological makeup right\nand um if we can't get rid of the ego if\nwe accept it if we see how there's bad\nsides of it if we see how there's good\nsides of it can we take the good side of\nit and try to use it as much as we\npossibly can and I think that there is\nand and the way that this really came\nalive for me I've shared this story\nbefore in the podcast is is when I was\nwriting my book um level up I was\nediting and editing and changing it\naround and and trying to make it the\nbest that I possibly can and went\nthrough like 15 16 rounds of edits on\nthis this book adding to it subtracting\nto it adding to it subtracting to it and\nchanging words around to make them a\nlittle bit better and like looking and\nfine-tuning almost every single sentence\nand I remember sitting here in this\nexact same tra that I'm in right now and\nthinking to myself I'm just trying to\nmake the best book that I can and um you\nknow I want to create a better book that\nimpacts more people's lives and uh if\nsomeone reads it it could change their\nlife and they're more likely to\nrecommend it and then somebody else will\nbuy it and it will change their life and\nall of that is true that is exactly what\nI did want with writing my book and then\nI took a step back and I played Devil's\nAdvocate because I like to I like to\nplay Devil's Advocate K with myself a\nlot and I think a lot of people like to\nto say something and say something about\nthemselves or to themselves and then\nthey take it as truth I like to actually\nplay Devil's Advocate as much as I\npossibly can and go okay yeah you do\nwant to write the best book you do want\nto write the best book but you also do\nwant to sell a lot of copies you do want\nto be your New York Times bestselling\nauthor and you know you know if a lot of\npeople buy it you're going to make a lot\nof money off of it and so are you trying\nto write the best book to impact the\nmost life lives or you trying to make\nthe best book so that you could get a\nlittle badge on your shirt that says\nyou're a New York Times bestselling\nauthor look at me and I thought about it\nand I was like both I guess so there's\nnot bad in that right is there anything\nwrong with those no there's nothing\nwrong with either one of those but is\nthere a case where both of those are\ntrue and I can use my egoic side for\ngood and what I realized is that my ego\nthat wanted to sell more books was\ncoming in and helping me create a better\na better book and I was like damn this\nis interesting and this is what I I do\nthis to myself all the time so if you\nwant to know what I do in my free time I\n psychoanalyze myself as what I\ndo because I'm I'm just like every other\nperson that's out there like we all got\nthings going on right so I thought to\nmyself okay wow this is interesting is\nmy ego helping me create a better book\nand if I create a better book then it\nwill change more people's lives and if\nit changed more people's lives more\npeople are likely to recommend it if\nmore people recommend it then more\npeople are going to buy it and then I\nwill actually make more money off of it\nso my ego this thing that's supposed to\nbe so bad is actually in some\ninteresting way helping me help more\npeople just like huge Revelation for me\nand I realized that if I could take my\nego I can identify different aspects of\nmy ego things that are quote unquote bad\nand we've been told that that are bad\nand we can we can realize there's good\nsides of them there's bad sides of them\nall that but if I can find the good side\nof them and I can Wrangle it and I can\nuse it when it needs to be used not have\nit run rampant all over the all over the\nplace but just use it when it needs to\nbe used I can use it to create a better\nlife but it's got to be directed\ncorrectly right it can't just run wild\nyou know it's like it's like a bull a\nbull is a very dangerous animal a bull\nthat has been raised around humans to do\ncertain jobs s can pull a plow and it\ncan help create more food for a village\nsame animal the difference is the way\nthat it's trained and the way that it's\nused complet you know completely the\nsame animal completely different\nscenarios one is used intentionally when\nit is need to be used the other is\ndangerously running around so you know\nthere's there's there's that aspect of\nmy ego where I realized like yeah okay\nthere was I guess I guess you could call\nit selfishness I guess you could call it\num you know wanting to to be quote\nunquote important wanting to make money\nwhatever it is that that side of me I\nwas like can I use this side of my ego\nand use it for good right what else is\nis I'm a I'm very competitive I'm a\nsuper competitive person like has been\nto a fault for many many aspects of my\nlife right so if you're out there and\nyou're extremely competitive it's not a\nbad thing but it can be if it's not\nharnessed and used correctly so if\nyou're if you're miserable until you win\nor until you beat somebody well yeah of\ncourse then that means it could be a\nreally bad thing like I've been that way\nbefore where I hated losing more than I\nloved winning and so if you're miserable\nthen it's not really a good thing so if\nI'm if if if I'm out there or you're out\nthere and we're comparing ourselves\nconstantly to other people on Instagram\nis that a bad thing yeah probably but\ncan you take that competitive side of\nyour ego and can you turn it into\nsomething good when it's needed to be\nused sure like if I'm in sales and uh I\nI'm in an office with 20 other sales\npeople when you sit down and I need to\nmake sales calls and I can see the\nrunning list of you know sales calls\nthat everyone's made I could sit there\nand go okay I I I need it's time to turn\nmy competitive side on because I want to\nmake more sales calls than anybody else\nbecause if I make more sales calls I'll\nget on phone more clients and then\nprospects and then I will get more\nclients and then I will make more money\nso when you sit down to make sales calls\nyeah it can be used really well it can\nbe uh you know used if if you're really\ncompetitive against others you could use\nit in that way I want to be number one\nin in calls for the for the month I want\nto be number one in in sales and\ncommissions for the month you could use\nit at that point but if you leave the\noffice and then you're miserable all day\nbecause John ended up making more money\nthan you you know the guy who sits next\nto you then you're like well that's not\na good thing but if I can use it and\nturn it on on when I need to and turn it\noff when I don't need it then it becomes\na really good thing and you know the\nother thing too is like you don't also\njust you can use your competitive side\nnot always just to be competitive\nagainst other people but you can use it\nto be competitive against yourself\nbecause that's actually the one that\nreally matters more anything else when\nyou want to you know say you're you're\ncreating content for Instagram and\nyou're trying to create content for your\nbusiness well you can get competitive\nwith your old self and say I'm going to\ncreate the best possible content that\never created better than any content\nthat I've ever created before and I'm\ngoing to be competitive against myself\nyou could also use this in in the sales\nexample I just gave the most amount of\ncalls I've ever made is 125 calls in a\nday can I beat myself and can I use that\nfor good if uh you know the most my\nbusiness is ever brought in in a month\nis\n$112,000 can I be competitive against\nmyself and try to bring in more this\nmonth right so that's how competitive\ncould be a bad thing if it's not used\ncorrectly but it could could also be\nused in a really good way let's say that\nyou've identified that you're a you're a\nlittle bit of a selfish person\nselfishness can seem bad but you could\nalso use selfishness for your time you\nknow if you're a business owner um one\nof the things that I found is that a lot\nof people are people Pleasers and so uh\none of the things that that people\nPleasers tend to struggle with when they\nstart a business is not saying yes to\neverybody and so you could be selfish\nwhich could be bad if you just hoard all\nof your money and don't share it that\ncan be bad but you could also be selfish\nwith your time if you're a business\nowner that's something that you should\nstart to pay attention to oh yeah\nselfish with my time when I'm a business\nowner that's actually a good thing you\nknow when you're growing your business\nthis is super important selfishness when\nused correctly can help you set\nboundaries and there's a lot of people\nthat really need help with boundaries so\nit's really about identifying this and\nrealizing are there bad aspects of\neverything sure can we find some good to\nuse it the correct way yeah I'm going to\nuse my selfishness to be able to set\nsome boundaries with other people on my\ntime so that I can spend more time in my\nbusiness or more time with my children\nwhatever it might be essentially what it\nis is it is a tool for your tool belt\nright when you need to get a nail into a\nwall a hammer is absolutely the best the\nbest thing to use but when you have a\nscrew that needs to get into a wall a\nscrewdriver would be better for you and\nso it's not about using the hammer for\nevery every single thing that you need\nto do around the house but it's like hey\nhow can I have a tool for my tool belt\nso let's talk about how you can use your\nego for good right you can use it when\nit's needed but don't allow it to use\nyou you know you want to own the ego not\nbe owned by the ego so when I say your\nego or your egoo egoic side what's the\nfirst thing that you think about what\nare the aspects of yourself that you\nthink about when I say your ego is it\nyour your selfishness is it your\njealousy your judgmental side you and\nhow arrogant you can be sometimes your\ninsecurity you being self-centered\ndefensive the attachments that you have\nresistance to change your perfectionism\nwhat is it that pops up for you the\nfirst thing that you need to do is you\nneed to first off identify what it is\nand then what you need to do when you\nidentify is you need to accept that it\nis part of you it's like your arm like\nI'm looking at my arm I've got some\nfreckles I got a big old Freckle right\nhere that's on my arm for you guys that\nare watching on video on YouTube right\nthere's big old frecks right here you\nmight have a hairy arm you might have a\nfreckly arm but I don't cut this arm off\nbecause it's not quote unquote\nperfect no it's there you know and it\nhopefully is going to be here forever\nand your ego will probably be there\nforever as well so what I need to do\nfirst off is accept yeah I've got you\nknow what I got some I got some little\nfreckles on this arm I'm very Irish and\nwith that I've got I've got a ton of\nfreckles all the way up my arm right so\nit's just the way that it goes so we\nneed to accept that that's just a part\nof who you are that selfish side of\nmyself is just a part of Rob and I need\nto accept it and I have accepted it and\nas I accept it and I realize it's\nprobably going to be there\nforever then I can go okay well is there\nis there parts of this that I can kind\nof turn down and parts of this that I\ncan kind of turn up and use whenever I\nneed\nto right because you cannot teach the\nego to be anything anything other than\nuh\negotistical so it's like oh yeah like\nRob's selfish sometimes that's kind of\nhow I am sometimes right uh how can I\nuse that for good I can be selfish with\nmy time I want to spend more time with\nmy wife I want to be selfish with that I\nwant to spend more time in my business I\nwant to be selfish with that so the\nfirst thing that we need to do is we\nneed to accept it it's there because all\ntoo often what we're doing is we're\nactually fighting it and if it's a part\nof us fighting it won't do anything\nexcept for stress you out and that's\nwhat usually people end up doing is they\nend up like fighting themsel all day\nlong okay so that's the first thing\nidentify it and accept it second thing\nyou need to do is to change your\nrelationship with\nit get out of pen and paper and write\ndown is there some good in this is there\nis it possible that there's some good in\nthis and if it's going to be there how\ncan you change your relationship with it\nso instead of being in constant battle\nwith it can I change my relationship\nwith it and see it as although it has\nsome bad that's come from it a lot of\ngood has probably come from it as well\nlike if you can trace back and think\nabout that can you find some good that's\ncome from that egoic side of you that\nthing that you just mentioned can you\nfor a second press pause close your eyes\nnot if you're driving and find the good\nthat's come from it or you know if you\nhave a pen and paper can you journal\nwhat good has my ego created in me or in\nthe world or in my life it might be hard\nto find but really what it it comes down\nto is starting to see the good and the\nbad and starting to see the good that it\nhas created because You' probably only\nseen it through the lens of it being bad\nit's hard to find sometimes because I'm\nasking you to look through a different\nlens than you've probably ever looked at\nit in your entire life and so that's the\nsecond thing you want to make sure that\nyou do and then the third thing is to\nuse it for good so now that I've\nidentified the places where it could be\nused for good now I'm going to actually\nstart to use it like a tool in a toolbox\nlike I said how can you end up using it\nfor good and then also start to become\nvery aware of when the bad will pop up\nbecause you probably have some patterns\nwhere the bad egoic side of you is going\nto pop up and you can notice it oh my\ngosh I'm being selfish you know I I I\ndon't really need to be selfish in this\nmoment right I probably should be more\ngiving in this moment and start to\nbecome aware of the parts of it that you\nwant to kind of tune down and turn down\njust a little bit but also become aware\nof like hey I really need to use this\nright now I really need to bring this in\nyou know I'm I'm competitive and I need\nto make some some money this month so\nI'm going to try to beat everyone's ass\nthat's in this that's in this sales\ncompany right okay turn it on let's go\ntry to use it to make you some money to\nget you to be number one whatever it is\nthat you need to but then you know when\n5:00 gets you leave the office don't\nbring it with you just turn it off okay\nwhen you need to put a nail into the\nwall you use the hammer right but you\ndon't use a hammer when you need to\nscrew that nail into the wall that's the\nsame thing as your ego it's the same\nthing if if you can use it for good the\nsame way that you can take that bowl you\ncan attach a cl to it and you can use\nthat thing for good to feed an entire\nVillage that's the same bull that if\nit's not trained it's going to be\nrunning all over people right we've all\nseen bulls that are in the the Rings\nwhen people jump on top of them and the\nguys in clown outfits get launched into\nthe air right that's not the ego that we\nwant we want the ego that is tame that\nis used correctly it's a tool in your\ntool bout and when when you are ready to\nuse it intentionally you could become\naware and go oh yep I need to turn this\nside on to me again oh you know what I'm\nbeing a people pleaser I need to be be\nselfish with my time I need to make sure\nthat I take care of myself first and so\nwhat you do is you you accept it first\nyou become aware of it you become aware\nof it you accept it you change your\nrelationship with it and then what you\nstart doing is you start using it for\ngood and that is really how you can\nstart to identify different parts of\nyour ego befriend your ego and start to\nuse it to help you move along in your\nlife so that's I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a huge favor please share right\nnow on your Instagram
