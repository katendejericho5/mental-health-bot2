    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto talk to you about how not getting\nwhat you want most of the time ends up\nbeing a blessing in disguise so I'm\ngoing to teach you how to reframe your\nmindset to stop worrying so much to\ntrust a little bit more and to be\nhappier today we're going to be talking\nabout why sometimes when you don't get\nwhat you want it ends up being a\nblessing in disguise sometimes the\nuniverse does you a favor by not giving\nyou exactly what it is that you wanted\nand today I'm going to offer you a\nperspective and I'm not going to say\nthat this is factual I'm not the type of\nperson that say Hey this stand on top of\na soap box and say hey this is absolute\ntruth you should believe this but I just\nwant you to just take the next 15\nminutes with me and just play with this\nidea that I'm about to give you and just\nsee how it lands if you want to choose\nto believe it or kind of believe in it\ngreat if you want to just throw it to\nthe Wayside no big deal I just want to\nkind of offer you a different\nperspective and see if I can change your\nmind a little bit on the way that the\nworld works you know for me I believe\nthat I am part of this massive greater\nplan that I don't know and I don't\nunderstand now you guys could call it\nGod you could call it Universe you could\ncall it life something I believe is out\nthere there's no religion attached to it\nfor me but you know it's a common\nexperience that we as humans can can get\nreally frustrated or mad when something\ndoesn't go our way when we don't get\nwhat we wanted life does not go as we\nexpected it to happen we all have hopes\nand dreams and desires if you listen to\nthis podcast you do have some sort of\nhopes and dreams and desires and you do\nwant to improve yourself and you do want\nto get better and it can be really hard\nwhen we have a plan and then it goes to\n it doesn't go the way that we want\nright it's like that phrase um whatever\nit was I can't think of it off top of my\nhead but it's something along the lines\nof like uh we make plans and God laughs\nright it can be hard when life doesn't\ngo the way we want we wanted it to go\nthis way but I don't know about you guys\nI didn't create the universe and I'm\ndefinitely not smart enough to know how\nthe whole thing works and so I'm not\nsmart enough to be like hey it should\nhave gone this way do I have ways that I\nwish things would have happened sure but\nsometimes it's really worth taking a\nstep back and considering that there\nhave been many times in your life where\nyou didn't get what you wanted and you\nfast forward 5 years or 10 years and go\noh my God I'm so glad that I didn't get\nwhat I wanted cuz had I gotten what I\nwanted I would be in a completely\ndifferent re completely different life\ncompletely different circumstance and so\nreally it turns into to be a blessing in\ndisguise a lot of times um and you know\nthe universe or whatever it is is this\nvast incredibly complex system that\noperates on its own principles its own\nlaws and let's be real none of us down\nhere are smart enough to understand it\nit is unpredictable able and we really\njust are trying our best we're just\nwe're just holding on down here right\nand many people believe that there's a\ngreater purpose and\nplan but they still have a whole lot of\ntrouble whenever they're sitting around\nand things don't go the way that they\nwanted them to when we don't get what we\nwant we feel freser we feel angry we can\ncuss at the sky and we might wonder why\nthe universe is not giving us the thing\nthat we wanted that we've been working\ntowards that we think that we deserve\nsee you start to think about that way\nand you start to see that maybe it is a\nlittle bit crazy you know we see other\npeople that are achieving things that we\nwanted and they it seems man they grew\ntheir business so fast what's wrong with\nme why why isn't why am I not getting\nthis thing why am I not getting what I\nwanted and then we step back and we can\nquestion our Worth and be like I don't\nknow if I'm good enough I don't know if\nI'm going to be able to do this thing\nand we feel like we failed in many\ndifferent ways but what if we took all\nof that took all of the things that\nhappened and we just decided to shift\nour perspective just a little bit and\njust change our perspective just a tiny\nbit and see what happens you know what\nif we looked at the situation from a\ndifferent angle that's really what I try\nto do with as many things as I possibly\ncan I have a perspective on life and\nsometimes my perspective makes me happy\nand sometimes my perspective makes me\npissed off depending on the circumstance\nright but when I notice that I don't\nfeel good based off of my perspective I\ntry to see if there's a way that I can\nchange my perspective and so the example\nI always give people is if this is your\nperspective and then You' found exactly\nwhat your perspective is and I said to\nyou okay imagine that you're on the\ndebate team and now you have to debate\nthe opposite side the opposite\nperspective what would that be so like\nfor instance oh my dad was this way when\nI was a child and I'm so screwed up\nbecause of that okay cool now I and\nyou're I want you to debate instead of\nwhy you're so screwed up for it I want\nyou to debate on why that was perfect\nand now you've got to see it from a\ndifferent perspective perspective most\nof the times when I coach people all I'm\nlistening to is their and I'm\njust trying to help them see a different\nperspective because they they are going\nthrough so much pain and struggle and\nturmoil based off of only their\nperspective of circumstances that are\ncurrently happening and that were\nhappening in the past so what if we were\nable to see the life's decision to not\ngive us what we want as something that\nhappened for us as an act of kindness\nrather than a punishment or some sort of\nsetback because there's many reasons why\nnot getting what you want can actually\nbe a really good thing sometimes life\nmay be protecting us from a really bad\nsituation so you know for\nexample you know maybe you had a\nrelationship like I can think of a\nrelationship right now off top of my\nhead right an ex-girlfriend that I had\nand when we broke up and I found out all\nof these different things I was so hurt\nby it I was so frustrated by it that was\nuh you know how many years years ago\nlike 18 years ago at this point 15 years\nago something like that oh my God I am\nso happy that it didn't work out but 16\nyears ago when it was happening I was so\nfrustrated I was like why is this not\nworking out right so it may be that the\nuniverse is protecting us from that\nperson but we don't know about it until\nwe you know fast forward years and years\ndown the road so if maybe for instance\nyou really want a job and you really\nreally really want that job and then you\nend up not getting it and you're really\nmad and you feel bad about yourself and\nyou think man I'm not good enough I'm\nnot qualified enough and then 6 months\nlater you know that job uh that company\ngoes out of business and you're like oh\nmy God thank God I didn't get that job\nright you've had that happen before\nsomething along those lines right or you\nreally want to get into a relationship\nwith someone or you really want you\nreally want to be with somebody that\nyou've been with before and then you\nbreak up and then you can't stop\nthinking about them and then you realize\nyou know they get they they get married\nand then two years later they get\ndivorced because they cheated on their\nspouse whatever it is and we're like oh\nmy God good thing I didn't stay with her\nwe can always see when we look back oh\nyeah man that's really good I see thank\nGod for for you know making that go\ndownhill quickly so it may be that we\nhave our wants and expectations but\nthere's a greater plan that's happening\nbehind the scenes once again maybe you\nbelieve this maybe you don't but just go\nalong on this journey with me life may\nhave a greater plan in store for you you\nknow you might have your site set on a\nparticular goal or achievement or amount\nof money that you want to make or a job\nthat you want to get and then you find\nout that you know another opportunity\npresents itself and you end up going\nthat way and ends up being way more\nrewarding way more fulfilling for you in\nthese cases not getting what you want\nwas actually a gift like me thinking\nback to my ex-girlfriend not getting\nwhat I wanted which was to to be able\nfor us to work out was a huge gift I'm\nsure you've got that if you look back\nyou can actually see many circumstances\nthat were really hard for you to go\nthrough but thank God it happened\nexactly the way that it happened right\nso you've got to start to see that so I\nwant you to think of one perspective as\nI'm talking to you what is one perspect\none what is one thing that happened to\nyou where you were really struggling as\nit was going through you or going you\nwere going through it but it might have\nbeen 5 years ago 10 years ago whatever\nit was and now that you fast forward to\ntoday you go oh my God I'm so glad that\nit didn't happen the way that I wanted\nto you can see that right so if that's\nthe case the next time you have\nsomething really hard happen to you can\nyou remind yourself that maybe the same\nthing is happening maybe you're getting\npushed into the right direction maybe\nthere's something better for you maybe\nthere is someone that's better for you\nright it can be a really great chance\nfor us to find a different perspective\nand it can be a great chance for us to\nbuild more awareness in oursel you know\nsometimes it's just a matter of timing\nyou know if you're like I want my\nbusiness be at a million dollar a year\nand you're at $100,000 a year maybe\nyou're not ready yet maybe you're not\ngood enough yet maybe you need to get\nbetter maybe you need to get more mature\nmaybe your skill set is not there and\nyou need to work on your skill set I\nalways tell people that if you don't\nhave what you want yet just be better\nnot in a bad way just be better how do I\nneed to improve what do I need to\nimprove Within Myself in order to get\nbetter what is it I had a uh and and\nreally what it comes down to is when you\nnotice that usually it's a knowledge Gap\nthere's something that you need to learn\nto get better and to improve at and\nthat's really something that to think\nabout is like if I'm not where I want to\nbe what do I need to learn I had a uh a\nsales rep I was telling this to um a\ngroup that I coach called mindset\nmentary University earlier this week and\none of my sales reps uh he was brand new\nabout five months ago and he was brand\nnew as a sales rep we hired him on\ntrusted in him and about three weeks in\nhe sends me a voice message he's like\nhey man like I'm really struggling I\ndon't not getting the results that I\nwant I don't know what to do I feel feel\nbad about myself I feel bad about my\nresults I said be a sponge learn more\nwhen you realize that you aren't where\nyou want to be ask yourself what do I\nneed to\nlearn fast forward five months he\nliterally just finished last month\nnumber one right because he just became\na sponge and learned and learned and\nlearned and so there might be like\nyou're not where you want to be yet\nbecause the universe is saying hey you\nneed to learn more you need to be better\nyou need to get better you need to get\nmore knowledge into your head you need\nto get more experience you need to get\nmore skill you need to mature more that\nmight be what the case is it's forcing\nyou to grow you know it's not always\neasy to see a silver lining when you're\ndisappointed when you're let down it's\nnatural to feel sad or frustrated when\nthings don't you know go up to the way\nthat you want it to be and your hopes\nand dreams and desires are not coming\ntrue but it's really important to to to\nmake sure that you know that your\ndesires and your goals are just your\nexpectation the way that you think that\nit should be and if you fast forward\ninto the future\nit will all make sense if you were in\nthe future if you were 10 years from\ntoday all of it would make sense you\nwould go you know what I'm seeing why\nI'm not getting what I want because I\nneed to get better I need to learn more\nI need to get more skill set I need to\nimprove myself I don't need to talk\nto myself about how I'm not good enough\nwhat do I need to do is make myself good\nenough that's the key to it and so you\nknow like I said if you go back and you\nthink of one experience in your life\nthat you've had and you think back to a\ntime when you really wanted something\nyou didn't get it how did it turn out\ndid you eventually realize have you\neventually from this perspective from\nthis 5 10 years down the road can you\nsee that it worked out for the best if\nyou can see that it'll help you start to\ncultivate trust in life's plan for you\nand it working out now I'm not just\nsaying just sit at home and just you\nknow hope for the best I'm saying you\ngot to learn you got to get better\nyou've got to improve your skill set\nyou've got to put some work in you've\ngot to take some\naction but stay open in new\npossibilities just because one door\nclosed doesn't mean that all doors are\nclosed you know keep an open mind a\nlittle bit be a little bit more persp uh\nmore receptive look for new\nopportunities that might pop up you\nnever know I might be coming down the\nline for you and really when you when\nyou start to think about it you start to\nto see yourself in struggles and you say\nto yourself what am I supposed to learn\nfrom this you know like I trust I give\nthis example to uh a group I was\ncoaching uh I think it was this week as\nwell and um I was saying this example\nbecause I think it's really important so\nfor me like I really do trust TR and\nwhen you worry a lot worry is a lack of\ntrust I just trust that whatever happens\nis supposed to happen even if it's not\nwhat I want which is usually the way\nthat it works out right and so for\ninstance two years ago our uh we had two\ndogs one of them was Toby the other one\nwas Bear Toby passed away two years ago\nand Toby we had been going to the same\ndoctor in Austin for years and years and\nyears and he knew Toby really well and\num and you know when Toby passed away we\ntook his body and he uh to the doctor\nand the doctor was in charge of you know\nget him cremated and all that stuff\nabout four days after Toby passed away\nwe took bear our puppy at the time in to\nget fixed and you know he had to come in\nthe doctor to come in and have that\nconversation with us of like hey you\nknow there is a risk he knew that Toby\nhad just passed away but he was four\ndays later he's like hey there's there's\na risk I just want you guys to know that\nhe had to have that doctor conversation\nwhen you put a dog under there's always\nrisk and I was like yeah I know and so\nwe drop him off he goes and gets fixed\nand everything like that\ndon't hear back from the doctor for like\nseven hours right drop him off in the\nmorning and I can feel myself start to\nworry you know I can feel the worrying\nand I had to take a step back and I had\nto really like question myself like do\nyou trust that everything works exactly\nthe way that's supposed to and I was\nlike yes and if something happens to\nBear do you trust that there's something\nthat you're supposed to learn that is\nexactly as you're supposed to happen I\nwas like yes I do trust that if\nsomething happens cuz I'm getting all\nthe lessons from Toby's death I'm\ngetting there's other lessons for me if\nsomething happens to\nBear but I just really don't want to\nlearn a lesson today that was my\nresponse to it but I do trust and what\nmade me stop worrying was the trust that\nexactly what's supposed to happen\nexactly what's going to happen if you\nworry too much worry is a lack of trust\ndo you can you find more ways to trust\nin the flow of the universe that you are\nin just learn to trust let go a little\nbit more and see how it happens remember\nthat life has a plan that you can't\nfreaking comprehend you can't always see\nit and most of the time you can't see it\nat all until you look backwards and you\nhave to trust that everything that\nhappens to you happens for a reason and\nyou maybe you're just being guided\ntowards something that's better for you\nwhen you don't get what you want maybe\nthere's something that's actually better\nfor you that's coming down the line it's\nalways happening for you it's never\nhappening to you and whenever something\ndoesn't happen the way that you want to\ntake a step back and ask yourself what\ncan I learn from this how can I grow\nfrom this how can I improve it's\nimportant to remember that that that\nwhat you not getting what you want it's\nnot a punishment or a reflection of your\nworth or you're not good enough and\nthat's why you didn't get it it's simply\njust part of the EB and flow of life\nlife es life flows like it's EB and flow\nit's like sometimes it's really good\nsometimes really bad when it's really\nbad it won't be really bad forever when\nit's really good it won't be really good\nforever but\nreally life might just be doing you a\nfavor by not giving giving you what you\nwanted even though it almost never feels\nlike it in the moment so next time you\nget really frustrated you get\ndisappointed try to take a step back try\nto see a bigger picture try to try to\ndebate from a different perspective like\nI said maybe this is all working out in\nyour favor maybe you are actually being\nguided towards something better at all\nmoments in time which means sometimes\nyou're not going to get exactly what you\nwant what is meant for you will never\npass you by so if it is if you are\nsupposed to have it you will have it if\nyou were supposed to be there you'd be\nthere if that\nrelationship that you're continuing to\nthink about was supposed to succeed it\nwould have\nsucceeded so you've got to start to\nthink about that maybe what I should\nstart doing is stop white knuckling my\nfreaking\nlife and just trust a little bit more\nbecause it's all going to work out I\npromise you that so that's what I got\nfor you
