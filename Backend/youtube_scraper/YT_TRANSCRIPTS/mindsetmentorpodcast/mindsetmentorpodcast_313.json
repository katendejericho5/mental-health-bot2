    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to let go of your anger\nand your resentment that you continue to\nhold on to that's holding you back from\ncreating the life that you want let's\ndive in why would we want to do this why\nwould we not want to just stay mad at\nsomebody who did something to us and why\nwould we not want to just stay mad at\nall the people so that we can keep our\nwalls up and know hey I need to protect\nmyself against this\nperson well the first reason why I think\nis because if we're being honest like\njust let's just be real with each other\nit's so damn stressful to just hold on\nto all the anger and resentment and some\npeople listening to me right now have\nbeen holding on to anger and resentment\nfor most of their life and they've been\nholding on to it for so long they they\nit's become a piece of them they they\nfight for their insecurities they fight\nfor their anger and oh you don't know\nwhat they did to me you have no idea\nright and it becomes a part of them\ntheir insecurities their the the the\nparts of them that they don't want\nanymore they hold on to and they fight\nfor so much you know I talk with so many\npeople that are 40 50 60 years old and\nthey're still\ncomplaining and blaming other people\nabout something that they're you know\ntheir mother did in 1993 oh I'm this way\nbecause you know on Christmas day in\n1993 my mom did this thing like dude\nthat was over 30 years ago are you still\nholding on to it you know or their\nbrother was you know an and beat\nthem up 20 years ago whatever it might\nhave been 20 years ago and you're still\nholding on to this thing he beat you up\none time 20 years ago and you've been\nbeating yourself up every single day\nsince think about that for a second\nwho's the real bully your brother who\nbeat you up 20 years ago or you who's\nbeen beating yourself up every single\nday for the past 20 years based off of\nthe way that you started to perceive\nyourself because of the way that you\nwere beaten up by by your brother maybe\nyou thought that you weren't good enough\nor you weren't smart enough or you\ndidn't deserve to be accepted or that\nyou don't\nmatter who's the real bully them for the\none time that they did something to you\nor two times or five times they did\nsomething to you whatever it might have\nbeen that happened or you that continues\nto carry that event with you and I\nrealize this can be this could be really\nhard for people to confront because like\nI said it becomes part of our identity\nit's like our badge of honor sometimes\nof oh yeah this happened to me I was\nscrewed over this thing happened but for\na lot of people\nlistening to be honest with you you are\nthe real bully in your life you have\nbeen way worse to yourself than anybody\nin your life has been and when you\nreally understand that you get that\nperspective you can start to see things\ndifferently because really all life is\nabout is about seeing things that have\nhappened to you or are happening to you\nright now from a different perspective\nthan you have been seeing them because\nit's time to let go\nit's time to to to let go of the things\nthat have happened to you and you know\nthink about this to say something like I\nam this way because of the way that my\ndad treated me as a\nkid if you say that and you really see\nthe perspective like take yourself out\nof your own head and let's just look it\nas if it was somebody else and then\nsomebody else says I am this way because\nof the way my dad treated me as a kid\nthat person is playing the role of the\nvictim and they've been wearing that\nrole of the victim their entire life I\nam this way because of what my dad did\nhe did this to me I am playing role of\nvictim if you play the role of the\nvictim you're never really in control of\nyour life you're never really truly\nfully in control of your life maybe\nthat's why it's been so hard for you to\nstep up and make real lasting change in\nyour life is because you you don't feel\nlike you're in control of your life you\nstill feel and have the perspective of\nvictim and you took that from childhood\nor teenager whatever it is that might\nhave happened to you right and because\nyou've never put yourself in the\ndriver's seat you cannot be in full\ncontrol of your life because you just\ncontinue to blame others you cannot be\nin control of your life if you continue\nto blame other people for other things\nthat have happened right the things that\nhave happened they happened you can't go\nback and change it now it is what it is\nthe only thing that you can do is change\nyour perspective on what has happened\nyou are either a victim in your life or\nyou are the creator of your life and if\nyou say I am this way because of this\nperson whatever it might be then you\nhave decided probably unconsciously that\nyou were going to be the victim in your\nlife and so with this podcast episode\nhopefully you have you will decide that\nyou're going to stop playing the victim\nfor certain things and you're going to\nactually be the Creator in your life\nthink about this way one of the things\nthat I love is is uh Wayne Dyer says\nthis really really well he gives a great\nanalogy um he speaks about anger and\nresentment like a snake bite and one\nthing that he says is he says there are\nno Justified\nresentments there's no Justified\nresentments what if your anger towards\nsomebody your resentment towards\nsomebody was not justified if you carry\naround whatever whatever happened you\ncarry around resentment or you carry\naround anger about anything or anyone\neven the worst person in the world to\nyou the person that cheated the kids\nthat bullied you when you were little\nyour mom your dad your brother sister\nwhatever might have been the the uh your\nex that the ex husband that did XYZ to\nyou what if you just flipped your\nperspective to you have no right to be\nangry and you have no right to be\nresentful the thing happened it happened\nit's in the past it's your job to figure\nout what to do with it anger is the acid\nthat burns the vessel I think it was\nMark Twain that said that anger is the\nacid that burns a vessel by holding on\nto anger and resentment you are only\nhurting\nyourself you know and you've got to\nthink about that the way that that Wayne\nDyer says it is that nobody dies from a\nsnake bite you might listen that be like\nwell that's like if somebody\ngot bit by a rattlesnake right now and\nthey didn't get the venom out of the\nbody or get whatever is they needed the\nAntietam they would die sure but here's\nthe thing that you have to understand no\none dies from the snake bite they die\nfrom the Venom once you are bitten\nyou're bitten you cannot be unbitten\nso it's not the bite that does it it's\nthe Venom that's coursing through your\nveins that's actually going to kill you\nbut when you get bit by a snake you\ndon't sit there on the ground and then\nget mad at the snake and blame the snake\ndo you no what do you do your main\nobjective is what do I need to do to get\nthis venom out of my system as soon as\npossible what do I need to do to get\nthis venom out of my system as quick as\nI possibly can you don't sit around and\ngo oh well yeah my leg hurts and my leg\nhurts because of that snake it's that\nsnake's fault that my leg hurts no no no\nyou don't care about the blame game at\nthat point in time it's get this venom\nout of my body now well the snake is\nthat person who quote unquote Did You\nWrong in some sort of way the person who\ncheated on you whatever it was it\nhappened and it cannot unhappen I don't\nknow if that's a word but I just made it\nup it cannot unhappen the Venom though\nso the snake is that person the Venom is\nthe anger in resentment that you choose\nto hold on to I say those words very\nspecifically you choose to hold on to\nthem it might be unconsciously but now\nit is conscious that is the anger in the\nVenom it's your\nchoice that thing that is making you\nsick that thing that is holding you back\nfrom stepping up your life is the thing\nthat you need to get out of your body\nyou need to get out of your\nConsciousness and so you're holding on\nto this Venom and then blaming the snake\nversus saying how can I get this venom\nout of myself as quick as possible how\ncan I get this anger and resentment out\nof my mind out of my body out of my\nConsciousness so that I can move on with\nmy\nlife think about that for a second it's\nreally important for you to understand\nthat right you want to get rid of the\nVenom you don't want to blame the snake\nand so I'll give you an example of my\nlife like I I love giving my life as an\nexample because as I teach these things\nI'm talking to you but I'm also always\ntalking to myself at the same time and\nI'm always thinking about my life so\nlike for instance my dad is the one that\nI could bring into here if this is your\nvery first podcast ever episode you've\nnever heard of me before uh my father\nwas an alcoholic parents got divorced\nwhen I was 10 years old from him being\nan alcoholic he passed away when I was\n15 from liver failure and from all of\nthat and I don't hate my dad now many\npeople have been through a situation\nwhen they did have an alcoholic father\nthey did have alcoholic parents or\nparents that were drug addicts or\nwhatever it might be I don't hate my dad\nI don't I love him and the reason why is\nbecause I I don't see him as the adult I\nsee them as the hurt child who didn't\nunderstand what he was doing because\nwhen you do meet an adult that which is\npretty much every adult just F FYI when\nyou do meet any adult you're basically\nusually looking at a wounded child in\nsome sort of way that has built\nprotection mechanisms in order\nto try to get by in our society\nwhich could be kind of crazy right so we\ndevelop protection mechanisms right my\ndad's protection mechanisms just happen\nto be alcohol to numb himself and to\nnumb his feelings from you know his\nfather's suicide and so that's really\nwhat it comes down to and so I don't\nhate him in any sort of way and when I\nmeditate every day I meditate on how\ngrateful I am that my life has gone\nexactly as it is and one of the things\nthat I meditate and and try to bring\ngratitude towards as much as possible is\nall of my challenges because using my\npain like I'm I'm grateful for the\nchallenge I'm grateful for all of the\npain that I've had because using my pain\nfor my own healing and trying to heal\nthat pain and my own pain and everything\nthat I have from it and and being able\nto use that healing and teaching that\nhealing to other people through the\npodcast through coaching through\neverything else that I do has been one\nof the greatest blessings in my entire\nlife so instead of being anger and\nresentful for towards it I'm grateful\nfor it now I could still be blaming him\nI could still be pissed off at him you\nknow he he never taught me how to be a\nman he wasn't there for me he chose\nalcohol over me I could take that Story\nand there's a lot of people that do\nstill have that type of story towards\ntheir parents or towards somebody else\nand they're blaming and blaming and\nblaming but what does that if I were to\nsay Hey you know I'm still so mad at my\ndad he chose alcohol over me he wasn't\nthere for me there were times when he\nsaid he was going to pick me up and I\nwould sit outside with my fishing pole\nto go fishing with my dad and he would\nnever show up yeah that's what happened\nit's a reality but if I'm mad at\nhim for it what does that do for me does\nit hurt him it doesn't hurt him he died\n23 years ago it does nothing to him it\nonly hurts me it only hurts me if I\ncontinue to hold on to that anger and\nresentment and it's the same thing for\nyou whatever it is whatever this event\nor this person that's popping up in your\nlife that you are still holding your\nanger and resentment towards it only\nhurts you it only hurts you you not them\nyou you and you continue to hold on to\nit and make that part of your identity\ndon't you get that don't you see how\nridiculous it is when you take a step\nout of it and you're like why am I doing\nthis to myself because once again as I\nsaid anger is the acid that only Burns\nThe Vessel it does nothing for them\nnothing to them does nothing for you\nyou've got to just let go of it get rid\nof the Venom that's coarsing through\nyour veins and you've got to learn if\nI'm being truly honest of how to forgive\nand I have an entire episode on\nforgiveness so you can go back and\nlisten to that episode where I dive\nreally really deep into the forgiveness\nand the importance of it and also how to\ndo it but forgiveness is not something\nthat you do for someone else that's what\nthe the misconception I have a friend\nwho was talking about their mom the\nother day and they were saying I will\nnever forgive this person and we were\ntalking about how ridiculous that is I\nwill never forgive this person\nwhy because because it's it's it's part\nof your identity to be the person that\nwas hurt by this person because you feel\nlike if you forgive them that it will\nthen let them off the hook no you don't\neven have to look them in the eyes and\nsay I forgive you what you do and what\nthe reason why you forgive is you\nforgive for yourself so you can let go\nof it it's like that phrase um the\nmountains that you're carrying you were\nonly meant to climb right like we all go\nthrough hardships we all have mountains\nthat we have to climb in our lives\nthings that are really hard some people\nthey climb the mountain they go down the\nother side and they go on about their\nlife some people climb the mountain they\nput it in their backpack and then they\nbring that thing with them that hard\nthing becomes part of they become\ncallous and hard right but you forgive\nsomeone for\nyou not for them so that you can let go\nof the burden that you've been carrying\nfor so long you don't need to go up to\nthe person look them in the eye and say\nhey I forgive you that's not what I'm\nsaying you don't even have to include\nthem if you don't want to you need to\nforgive them for your own heart so that\nyou can I mean you could close your eyes\nand you could you could really feel into\nit and it's not going to be a one time\nthing I promise promise you this it's a\nit's a slow release kind of thing is the\nway I think about it's like you're\nyou've been you've been stressing so\nmuch and you're so built up it's like\nyou got to slowly release and you might\nhave to meditate over this and journal\nover this you know multiple times but\nyou can close your eyes and you can\njust start to forgive people forgive\nthem for that thing that they did you\ncan write them a letter if you want to\nand get very detailed in the letter and\nthen you can burn it they don't ever\neven have to know that you forgave them\nbut you need to learn to let go believe\nme everything that happened is perfect\nnow mind\nyou I don't think that that that's gonna\nthat's going to be hard for some people\nto accept but it doesn't mean that\nwhatever happened to me happened exactly\nway that I wanted but I personally trust\nthat everything that happens to me\neverything that happens to me is\nactually happening for\nme that's something really interesting\nto think about is like okay yeah like\nwhen I think of the short term and I\nthink of things that are happening right\nnow where I'm like damn I really wish\nthis wasn't happening I've had many\nmoments in my life but then I fast\nforward 10 years and I look back on a\nmoment and I go oh I can see how it was\nperfect I can see how how my life has\nbeen a perfectly crafted curriculum for\nme to learn and grow if I am willing to\ntake a step back when something really\nhard is happening and ask myself what am\nI supposed to learn from this\nthing you know who else you need to\nforgive yep you need to forgive\nyourself right you need to forgive\nyourself\nthink about that for a second you know\nhow often you're just beating yourself\nup for something that you did in the\npast how long ago was that I mean you\nhave to understand this that as hard as\nit is to accept Everyone is always doing\nthe best that they can in the moment\nthat they do something and so if you\nscrewed something up in the past you did\nthe best that you could in that\nmoment how do I know that because if\nthere was something if there was\nsomething better that you could have\ndone based off of your your current\nConsciousness at that moment you would\nhave done it right now now if it\nhappened 5 years years ago and you're\nlooking back 5 years older 5 years more\nmature judging yourself for something\nhappened 5 years ago it's because you\nhave now expanded your Consciousness\nmore you expanded your knowledge more\nand now you can see HDE and sight's 2020\nyeah I probably should have done that\nthing but you can't go back and change\nit and so once again you're you're\nblaming the snake this snake just\nhappens to be you you're blaming the\nsnake and blaming the snake and blaming\nthe snake versus saying yeah I need to I\nneed to get this out of my body I need\nto get this anger and resentment towards\nmyself for something that I quote\nunquote screwed up the idea of screwing\nup is is is the crazy part about it too\nbecause you did what you did with the\nknowledge that you had you know if I\nlook back at it you know I have a lot of\nthings that I've screwed up in my past I\nhave relationships that I've screwed up\nin my past and I can look back and I can\nresent myself for all of the the\nscrew-ups that I had in my past or could\ngo you know what yeah I did screw some\nstuff up I was pretty bad but you know\nI'm learned lessons from those\nrelationships what I wanted what I\ndidn't want what how I wanted to show up\nhow I didn't want to show up and all of\nthat led me to my life to my wife and so\nif you zoom out 10 or 15 years you go\nyeah that makes sense it was\nperfect and you've have to have to learn\nto start to accept things that have\nhappened to your past and learn to\nactually start to uh forgive\nyourself for things that you have done\nfor things that you didn't do because\nyou can never truly move on from\nsomething unless you forgive yourself or\nthat person extract the lesson that you\ncan from it and leave with that lesson\nand integrate it to become a better\nversion of\nyourself in the long run you can always\nfind perfection in the journey if you're\nlooking from the right perspective it\nall happened exactly way it's supposed\nto happen and the reason why you can\nknow that it happened exactly way it's\nsupposed to is because that's what\nhappened so if you can learn to accept\nit stop fighting reality and stop stop\nfighting your past and let go of your\nanger and resentment you'll notice that\nyour path of what you're trying to do\nbecomes so much easier because you're\nnot caring so much burden and so much\nweight with yourself so that is how you\nstart to let go of your anger and\nresentment so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please do me a massive favor\ntake your phone out right now share this\non your Instagram stories if it impacted\nyou in any sort of way that is the only\nway that this
