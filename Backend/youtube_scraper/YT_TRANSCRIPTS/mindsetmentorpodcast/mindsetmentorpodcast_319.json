    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to talk about how to mentally and\nphysically start to escape the rat race\nso you can be free let's dive in we live\nin a world that is dominated by\nconsumerism and we if we're being honest\nwe have all you and I have been raised\nin it our entire lives so we have been\num whether it was consciously or\nunconsciously brainwashed to be a\nconsumerist to consume to want more to\nconstantly be wanting more stuff in\nthings and it's like the the idea I\nthink it's the Buddhist call it's like\nthe Hungry Ghost right you could feed a\nghost but it's just going to go through\nthem and they're going to continue to be\nhungry never going to fill up a ghost\nbecause it's just going to fall on the\nfloor you know we have been taught to\nconstantly want more and more and more\nand I have been caught up in this in my\nlife as well I came to the realization\nat about 32 years old that the first 32\nyears of my life were really focus on\nhow can I make money and the reason why\nI wanted to make money was because we\ndidn't have money when I was was a kid\nmy father's an alcoholic and I saw that\nthere was lack of what felt like safety\nbeing around him and I thought to myself\nwell money will give me safety and uh so\nI started trying to make money and\nstarted making that like my number one\nfocus in life obviously I wanted to be\nhappy and I wanted to be fulfilled and\nall those things but really it was like\nhow can I make money and I wanted to buy\nstuff and I wanted I thought that that\nwas going to make me happy and don't get\nme wrong like buying stuff is fun like\nI've bought some really cool in my\nlife I've bought some nice things I like\nnice things\nthere's nothing wrong with that I'm not\ntrying to actually say that there's\nanything wrong with that in this episode\nbecause there's really not but as much\nas I am uh talking to you in this\nepisode believe me I'm also talking to\nmyself and reaffirming these things in\nmyself as I'm saying it and uh what I\nwant to talk to you today about is is\nkind of the path to Freedom the path to\ngetting to a point in your life where\nyou don't have to work anymore just\nthink about that for a second is it\npossible for you to get to a point where\nwhere you don't have to work anymore and\ndo you believe it's possible cuz if you\ndon't believe it's possible then you'll\nnever get there you won't be able to see\nhow it can be possible and how you can\ncreate it if you don't see the\npossibility of it you'll never create it\nright and so mind you all of us live in\na world where the majority of our\nparents still work or they worked their\nentire lives or most of their lives so\nfor me my mom she still works and you\nknow so I've been raised by a mom who\nwas always working and so there's a part\nof me that has always thought I'm going\nto have to work forever now do I want to\nwork forever if if I choose to but I\nwould rather be able to be free if I\nchoose that as well and so it's really\nabout opening up your mindset to\nsomething different and really that's\nkind of the main point there's a couple\nthings I'm going to talk to you about\nand teach you today but the main point\nis I really want you to open up a part\nof your brain maybe your creative side\nto seeing something that maybe you've\nnever seen before because today isn't\nabout like saving money I'm not going to\nteach you how to save money or how to\nget better with a budget like that's not\nwhat I'm going to do I'm going to\nactually try to have you see a different\nperspective that maybe you've never seen\nbefore and to be able to see that\nperspective and hopefully by the end of\nthe episode start to say you know what\nthere's some there's some value in this\nI think that maybe I could do this maybe\nI'll start to think about this more\nmaybe I'll start to plan this more\nbecause it's not about just saving money\nthat's not what I'm saying it's really\nabout a fundamental shift in your values\nand your perspectives that you have\naround money that's what today's really\ngoing to be about and um that you have\naround things and buying stuff and\nBrands and all of that and um that you\nhave around a really shifting your\nperspective that you have around being\nfree and not having to rely on being\npaycheck to paycheck or not having to\nrely on anyone else or having to rely on\na company and um the first thing that we\nreally need to cover as someone that's\nobsessed with a human mind like I am is\nwe have to understand the real\npsychological appeal of consumerism like\nwhy does it exist in the first place and\nthere's a lot of uh there's a couple\ndocumentaries there's a documentary\ncalled A Century of self it's really\nlong it's like hours and hours long but\nthey basically start to talk about how\nyears ago before advertisements they\nused to say Hey you know they used to\nsell based off of what you need hey\nhere's a tractor you need a tractor and\nthen they started taking uh Sigman\nFreud's psychology and putting it into\nit to make you feel like not do you just\nneed this but you want this thing and\nyou should buy it because you want it\nand without having it you're not enough\nand so there's a lot of\npsychological uh back and forth that\ncomes about with consumerism and so um\nof buying more things of having more\nthings of other people's perception of\nyou when you have more things the desire\nto have more things and all of this and\nso the first thing that we need to\nrealize is that we have since we were\nchildren been seeing ads you know if you\nwatch Nickelodeon like I did as a kid we\nhad ads and ads and ads and ads and ads\nof things that we quote unquote needed\noh you need this so you can be cool you\nneed gak you need all of these you need\nthis tool you need this board game so\nit's kind of been whether it was\nconsciously or unconsciously done we've\nkind of been brainwashed into being\nconsumers I'm not going to say there's\nany like Overlord that's creating this\nthing but I'm just saying we have to\nunderstand that\nso we've been we've been since we were\nchildren seeing you need this you need\nthis you need this you need this and so\nwe've been thinking I need more need\nmore need more need more and when you\nunderstand the the Neurology of desire\nyou can really see that consumerism uh\nTaps into the brain's reward\nsystem some of the best psychologists in\nthe world work for some of the largest\nadvertising corporations in the world\nneurologically when we purchase\nsomething new our brain releases\ndopamine and dopamine is the chemical of\nmotivation the chemical of wanting more\nwhen you get dopamine you want more\ndopamine and so when we purchase\nsomething we our brain releases dopamine\nthat's why you can have a little bit of\na high and be excited 15 minutes after\nbuying something and that dopamine\ncreates a sense of pleasure and it\ncreates a sense of wanting to reinforce\nthat and do it again and this cycle can\nlead to habitual spending as we\nunconsciously seek this dopamine Rush\nsome people when they don't feel good\nwhat is it called retail therapy who the\nhell made that phrase up oh yeah the\nadvertising companies right so it can\nturn into this thing of like I don't\nfeel good I need to go shopping or\nyou're just buying stuff and not even\npaying attention to it or seeing like do\nI actually really need this thing or I\njust kind of want this thing and so\nbreaking this cycle really understands\nuh requires us to just sit back and\nunderstand like what's actually going on\nin our head why do I actually want this\nthing is it because there's a need\nthere's a necessity for it or is it just\nbecause I want it and it's fine to want\nthings but it's not fine to be adct\naddicted to purchasing things\nunconsciously to try to fill a void and\nI'll talk about that as well so\npsychologically when you look at\nconsumer culture it also exploits our\ninnate d uh desires for status for\nsocial belonging and self-esteem when\nyou look at like thousands of years ago\nyou look back to like the ancient\nEgyptians the ones that had the highest\nstatus were always the ones that were\nwearing the gold and so it's like this\nisn't anything new the social status to\nbe the king or to portray yourself as\nbeing the person who has more money or\nmore status is something that's always\nkind of been done it's kind of like the\nif you look at a group of of animals\nthere's usually an alpha male there's\nusually the one that's kind of got its\nstatus and for us we don't really have\nalpha males and Alpha females and all\nthat stuff but it's more of like hey how\ncan you show this and it's very lowkey\nand it's it's done in our psychology\nit's done through advertising and\nthere's so many studies on social\npsychology that show how material\npossessions often serve as symbols of\npersonal success and social status but\nthis pursuit of wanting more things\nreally often leads to a Perpetual state\nof\nwanting I okay I got this thing what's\nthe next thing okay I got this thing\nwhat's the next thing and this desire I\ndid a podcast episode a few months ago\non desire this desire can really cause a\nlot of suffering whenever you get\nsomething you want another thing\nwhenever you get something you want\nanother thing and that desire for\nwanting the next thing is actually what\ncauses so much suffering inside of us\nand we we'll never really truly feel\nfulfilled because of the fact that we\nalways feel like we need the next thing\nit's really more than anything else it's\na momentary thrill and we've all done\nthis before every one of us has done\nthis right you buy something and you get\nexcited and then an hour later you feel\nexactly the same way that you did\nyesterday there's no difference it's\njust a momentary thrill and that\nmomentary Thrill is a dopamine Rush that\nyou get from it I want you to understand\nthis people always like debate can money\nbuy happiness I can tell you absolutely\n100% the answer is no I will debate\nanybody on this I've tried it it doesn't\nwork I have done so much studying on\nhumans and and coaching with people and\nI've I've looked at all of the\npsychological research there's never\nbeen any proof that buying stuff makes\nyou happy that having money makes you\nhappy nothing you can ever buy will ever\nmake you happy or fulfilled or worthy\nand lots of times what people are doing\nis they're buying things to try to fill\na void that we feel within ourselves\nlike we a lot of times are trying to\nfill a void that we feel within\nourselves and we think that by buying\nthings is going to fill that\nvoid never will there's nothing outside\nof you that can ever fill a void inside\nof you and so the real work is not\nbuying the thing the real work is\nexploring within ourselves why we feel\nthat there's a\nvoid H something to think about isn't it\nwhy is there a void in the first place\nwhy do we feel like we need to by these\nthings and so really it's important\nthat's what I want to dive into before I\nstart teaching anything else is why in\nour brain do we feel like we need to buy\nstuff and why have psychologists and\nadvertisement companies been able to use\nour own brains and what they know about\nthem against ourselves because\nessentially what they've been doing\nthey' they've been exploiting parts of\nourselves to end up continuing to buy\nmore things so the first thing is we\nneed to mentally before anything else\nmentally get oursel free from feeling\nlike we need to buy something right like\nwe need to buy food and water sure like\nthose things I get but like another\nshirt maybe not you've already got some\nshirts right and so when you start to\nlook at it you start to say well well\ncould I live a simpler life and mind you\nI don't care what you buy and what you\ndon't buy I don't care how much money\nyou have or how much money you don't\nhave I don't care if you have stuff\neverywhere or if you're a minimalist it\ndoesn't matter to me what matters to me\nis are you happy are are you fulfilled\nand do you feel good within yourself and\nwhen you look at the studies\nneurologically you can see that living a\nsimpler life actually can reduce stress\nand anxiety the way that I've always\nthought about it is is that everything\nthat you own occupies a tiny piece of\nyour brain every single thing that you\nown and this is not scientific proof\nthis is the way that I've always\npersonally thought about it everything\nthat you own owns a tiny piece of your\nbrain even if it's that thing in the\nback of the closet somewhere that you\nhaven't seen in 3 years that you\ncompletely forgot about because if you\nsee it you're like oh my God yeah I\nforgot about this thing it's not like\nyou completely forgot about it or else\nbe out of your brain so it's still\noccupies a part of your brain somehow\nstill occupies a part of that memory so\nthe more things that you own the more\nthings own\nyou the more things that you own the\nmore things that own you the key to\ngetting free from the rat race is\nfiguring out a way to not feel like you\nalways have to buy something and to live\nbelow your means whatever that means for\nyou to live below your means there's a\nquote that I love that talks about this\nand it says people who live below their\nmeans enjoy a freedom that people stuck\nin the consumerism lifestyle can't begin\nto\nimagine I'm going to say that again for\nthe people on the back who missed it\npeople who live below their means enjoy\na freedom that people stuck in the\nconsumerism lifestyle cannot begin to\nimagine and so really what I want you to\nstart thinking about is how can I remove\nmy mind from cons consumism and then how\ncan I make a plan to be free and not\nhave to work right so that's really what\nwe're going to dive into now is is that\nand I want you I want you to think about\nthis question I was posed this question\nby a friend who is extremely successful\nand does not have to work at all and uh\nactually doesn't really work he's like\n42 years old and he just doesn't work\nbut he's extremely successful and he\nasked me the question what do you need\nto be free and I was like what do you\nmean he's like how much do you need to\nbe making in order to be free\nI was like I don't know he's like well\nyou should figure it out what do you\nneed to be free and when he says free\nthe the way he described it to me is not\nfree in the fact that you have to work\nto make this money but whether it's but\nyou need to be able to have money to do\nsomething with in order to put into\nInvestments to have that passively make\nyou money so you don't have to work at\nall and you're guaranteed to bring in x\namount of dollars per month and so you\nmight say like oh I need $10,000 a month\nlet's just put that number right I need\n$10,000 a month to support myself my\nfamily my four kids and my wife let's\nsay that's your number okay if you\nfigured out the number what do you need\nto do how much do you need to have what\ndo you need to do with those investments\nin order to make $10,000 a month\npassively I don't know what the answer\nis what is it for you it might be the\nstock market it might be real estate it\nmight be uh hard money lending what is\nit I don't know and this is the thing\nthat's really important is you need to\nfigure it out and you need to figure out\nhow to do it right so how much do you\nneed to be free and how much do you need\nto bring in to be free of all of it so\njust not have to work again and now I\nmind you I understand this you need to\nfigure it out and you need to figure out\nprobably how to make more money and how\nto invest your money and you need to\nfigure out a budget so all of these are\nreally important and I'm not going to\nteach any of this FYI because I'm not\nthe best person to teach it there's\ngreat people out there that teach you\nhow to make more money how to invest\nyour money how to figure out a budget\nall of that stuff and right now you\ncould live in the middle of Idaho and\nmake $3,000 a month and be like I don't\nknow how the hell I'm going to do it\nthat's fine but you can figure it out\nthe beautiful thing about it being the\nyear that it is and the fact that we\nhave the internet and everything out\nthere is that all of the knowledge in\nthe world exists at your fingertips so\nyou might not know it now but you can\nfigure it\nout if you decide not to figure it out\nthat's your choice\nbut you can't say that there's no way\nfor you to figure it out right you can\nuse if you're listening this you have\nthe internet in some sort of way you can\nfigure out how to make money on the\ninternet you can figure out how way to\nto switch jobs if you need an education\nfor something else you know figure out\nthe stock market be a day trader get\ninto cryptocurrency I don't know what it\nis but it's about figuring it out for\nyourself figure it out figure out how to\nmake more money figure out how to invest\nyour money and figure out how to budget\nthat money you have to realize and I say\nthis all the time money is just a giant\ngame and whether you decide to learn how\nto play the game or not you're still in\nthe\ngame it's like being on a basketball\ncourt playing basketball your entire\nlife and going well I'm not going to\nlearn how to play doesn't matter you're\nstill on the basketball court money is a\ngame you must learn how to play if you\nwant to free yourself from the game\notherwise you will be played and that's\nreally what it comes down to I realized\nthis years ago as like I don't know\nanything about money I don't know\nanything about the psychology around\nmoney I don't know anything about\ninvesting I don't know anything about\nmaking money but I better freaking\nfigure it out because I don't want to be\nstuck here forever I want to get to a\npoint where I am free and I am playing a\ngame and really what it comes down to is\nlike what do you need what is your\nnumber what's your your freedom number\nthat you need to be making every single\nmonth passively in order to be free so\nthat you could say hey I'm still working\nbecause I want to and because I'd be\nbored if I didn't but I don't have to\nright because Financial Security\nsignificantly impacts our mental health\nand well-being there's so much stress in\npaycheck to paycheck and it can take\nsuch a toll on your mental health it can\ntake there's so many studies around\naround money and anxiety and money and\ndepression and how uh money problems\ncauses divorces and so when you can say\nokay what do I need to make and then can\nI live below my means can I not just buy\nthings to buy things can I live below my\nmeans can I figure out what to do with\nmy money can I figure out how to make\nmore money can I figure out how to\ninvest my money and I might say hey I'm\nnot going to be free in the next two\nthree four five years\nbut I'm going to be free in 10 well it's\nmuch better to be free in 10 years than\nnever isn't it and so what it comes down\nto is what do you need to learn in order\nto get yourself to where you want to go\nand I realize it's a it's a big world to\nlearn but really what it comes down to\nas I said what I want to do is I want to\nopen your mind up to there being a\ndifferent possibility something\ndifferent because we all not all most of\nus saw our parents work their entire\nlives so we think to ourselves we need\nto work our entire lives I want you to\nunderstand we live in a beautiful world\nwhere there's amazing things happening\nand there is knowledge at your\nfingertips you can figure out how to get\nyourself free of it but you've got to\ndecide that it's something that you're\ngoing to do and you got to say you know\nwhat I don't need to buy all the\ntime I'm going to live below my means\nI'm going to figure out how to take make\nyou know take a $500 a month and invest\nit I'm not going to spend $500 like I\nremember when when my uh my wife and I\nfirst started dating we were like a year\ninto dating and she was only making like\n30 $5,000 a year she was working for an\nad agency and uh she's like I have no\nmoney I was like okay I was like well do\nyou want me to help you with your budget\nshe had never done a budget before and\nshe's like yeah I go cool let's go ahead\nand and print out all of your\ntransactions for the past three months\nbecause what happened was in all honesty\nasked you what happened first I said how\nmuch do you make every paycheck she told\nme and I was like okay how much is your\nphone bill how much is your rent how\nmuch is your car how much is your\ninsurance and I was like Lauren there's\nlike $400 missing and she's like no not\nand I was like there's definitely $400\nmissing and she's like well I don't know\nwhere it's going and I was like okay do\nyou want to do your budget with me like\ndo you want me to do you want some help\nand she's like yeah and I said all right\nprint out all of the last three months\nof transactions and this is when she\nused a debit card before she use her\ncredit card I told her F your credit\ncards because there's reasons behind\nthat but you know uh she got points and\nwe could travel with them and all that\nstuff but she printed out the last three\nmonths of her ATM uh you know her\ntransactions on her her ATM card and we\nwent through it and I saw this stuff and\nafter 3 months of transactions going\nthrough it took us a couple hours to go\nthrough and I go yeah I found where your\nmoney went and she goes where and I go\nyou're spending approximately $400 a\nmonth at Target and she's like what and\nI was like yeah and she I was like why\ndon't you just stop walking into Target\nand she's like okay she literally just\nstopped walking into Target and she was\nsaving $400 a month and she was making\n35 Grand a year right just being a\nsingle girl working you know she had a\nroommate at the time and so I want you\nto understand like there's ways to\nfigure this stuff out it just requires\nyou to do something different than\nyou've always done and to live below\nyour means because living below your\nmeans really does create a buffer\nagainst the the financial stress the\nmental stress um and gives you a real\nsense of control and security and so\nliving below your means is what's going\nto set you free and I'm going to bring\nyou back to the quote that I said before\npeople who live below their means enjoy\na freedom that the people stuck in\nconsumerism lifestyle can't begin to\nimagine so live below your means first\nand then figure out a way out of the\ngame and that is how you get yourself\nout of the Rat Race so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on\nInstagram stories tag me in it Rob dial\nJr r o d i a l Jr and if you love
