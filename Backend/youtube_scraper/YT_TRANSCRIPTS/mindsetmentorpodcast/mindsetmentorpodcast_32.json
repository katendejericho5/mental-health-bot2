    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you about perfectionism where\nit comes from how it shows up in your\nlife and actually psychologically how to\nremove it from your life so you can get\nbetter let's dive in perfectionism holds\nso many people back it's held me back\nfor years and it's something that I've\nhad to battle with and try to overcome\nbut when you look at it perfectionism is\nthis Relentless Pursuit for flawlessness\nand when you think of it that way it\nsounds great but if you are a person who\ndeals with perfectionism you know that\nit's not you know you know it it's not\ngood at all perfectionism and this\nconstant need to always feel like you're\nperfect comes at the cost of many mental\nand emotional well-beings that exist out\nthere and so today I'm going to talk to\nyou about perfectionism I'm going to\ntalk about you know why we develop this\nthis adaptation this behavioral\nadaptation called perfectionism you know\nwhere it comes from but I'm also going\nto start to talk about how it shows up\nin your day-to-day life and then I'm\ngoing to teach you how to actually\novercome it so I always tell you this\nwhenever I think of something and I'm\nalways think about creating an episode\nI'm always thinking about you know\nsomething that people deal with my first\nquestion always Pops in my head is why\nlike why where does it come from why do\nwe develop this thing and so\nperfectionism begins pretty much where\neverything else begins begins in\nchildhood and it is considered a\nbehavioral adaptation to your\nenvironment and psychological factors as\nyou're growing up the need need to be\nperfect I need to be perfect or else and\nwhere does it usually start yes you know\nyour parents it's parental\nexpectations the conditional love that\nwe all get and I want you to understand\nthis I I never want to feel like I'm\ntrashing parents that's not what I'm\ntrying to do but when we look at who we\nare and why we are the way that we are\n95% of the time it comes from the people\nwho raise us in some sort of way and\nit's not like they went and did this to\nus on purpose\nnothing against parents but you know I\nfeel like I bring up parents every\nsingle episode and I'm not trying to\ntrash them but and it's not easy to be a\nparent but nobody's perfect and most\npeople don't understand the psychology\nof themsel and they definitely don't\nunderstand the psychology as they're\nraising a child and so it's you know\nit's the way that the parent is but also\nat the same time it's also the child's\nfault you know children don't fully\nprocess the world the same as adults and\nso their interpretation of the world is\nnot always correct and so we just have\nto understand how the child interpreting\nthe world and the parent doing their\nbest come together to make you who you\nare and we have to understand that as\nmuch as any parent loves their child um\nunless that parent is\nincredibly emotionally aware secure and\nintelligent most of the times parents\nend up raising their children under the\ncircumstance of conditional love it's\nlike you do this and I love you I give\nyou affection you don't do this and I\nwill reprimand you or I will retract my\nlove from you and most people don't\nrealize that that's the way that they\nactually parent one of the ways that is\nthe most prominent way that parents\nparent their children is do what I say\nor else and that or else for a child\nfeels like retraction of love which is\nthe most detrimental thing to a child is\nmy my love is being my parents love is\nbeing taken away from me I no longer\nfeel safe I no longer feel secure and so\ntake a second and just think about how\nthat can affect a child because all the\nchild cares about is does my mom love me\nand does my dad love me and if they\nlearn that they do something or don't do\nsomething either or and it feels like a\nretraction of love from their parents\nthey're going to want to stop doing that\nthing because that feels like\nconditional love it's not\nunconditional and so you know I'm going\nto give you a couple of examples of how\nchildhood uh creates perfectionism and\nso let say you know if we uh if we look\nat it first off the thing I want you to\nunderstand is is as far as conditional\nlove goes there was a study that was\ncalled parental conditional Regard in\n2004d and it was called psychological\ncost in uh it was done in yeah like I\nsaid 2004 and so the study explored how\nparents uh use conditional love and\nwhere parents offer more affection and\napproval in response to a child's\nachievements and how that contributes to\nthe development of perfectionism and\nother maladaptive behaviors as well and\nso really what they found is a\npsychological cost of conditional regard\nand it increased internal pressure for\nthe child and as they were a child and\nalso became an adult and it lowered\ntheir self-esteem as a child as well and\nso some children become perfectionists\nas a strategy to feel like their\nparents' love will not be taken from\nthem and so they have to do what they\nwant their parents to do they have to be\na certain way they can't mess up or else\nthey feel like their their parents love\nis going to be taken from them and uh\nthis is just like I said it's a\nbehavioral adaptation perfectionism and\nthere's many other behavioral\nadaptations but today we're just me\ncovering perfectionism and so let me\ngive a couple of examples of what can\nhappen in child's uh childhood that\nmakes them become a perfectionist you\nknow let's say a child grows up in a\nhousehold where love and approval are\ncontingent on achievements I have worked\nwith many people and have some friends\nwhere praise and affection will be given\nto them when the child brings home\nexcellent grades or when they win a\ncompetition or in sports and they are\npraised and the parent shows them so\nmuch love and so much attention and\nthey're happy for them but that same\nparent might show disappointment and\nwithdrawal of their love and approval\nwhen the child falls short or when they\ndon't get an A or when the child uh\ndoesn't win a game or a competition and\nif this conditional love teaches a child\nthat their worth is tied to their\nsuccess and so what that does is it\ncreates a perfectionist mindset where\nyou know I have to do anything that I\npossibly can to succeed to get my\nparents approval so that is a very\ncommon way that perfectionism comes\nabout another way that perfectionism\ncomes about is if your parents are alsoo\nperfectionist or one of them is and and\nwe tend to model after our parents so\nchildren you know obviously mimic the\nbehaviors and attitudes of their parents\nand so in a family where one of the\nparents shows perfectionism uh\nTendencies or they set unrealistically\nhigh standards for themselves and for\ntheir children the child learns to\ninternalize these standards they see\nwhat their parents are doing and say\nokay this is how I'm supposed to be and\nso they get this feeling of I'm not good\nenough unless I'm perfect I'm not good\nenough unless I achieve hey real quick I\nwant to introduce you to something\ncalled mindset Mentor plus if you love\nthis podcast you will absolutely love\nwhat I'm about to talk about I designed\nmindset Mentor plus to help you actively\nintegrate every one of these episodes\ninto your life and here's how it works\nwith every episode of this podcast that\ncomes

also come with\njournaling questions challenges\nassignments and so much more so that\nyou're not just listening to these\npodcasts passively but you're actively\nintegrating them into your life that way\nyou improve much faster I also do\nmonthly Q&A sessions in there and much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription and so they can observe the\nparent stress over minor mistakes and\nhow they how they beat themselves up and\nmaybe like a incessant need for order\nand for the house to be perfect whatever\nit might be and that can instill really\nsimilar perfectionism traits in the\nchild as well and I can give you a\ncouple of examples of people that I've\nseen uh I had a client one time and um I\nwon't tell you his name but he was over\nin the the UK and his father was in the\nuh the military over in the UK and um he\nhad this thing where he couldn't stop\nworking like he kept working and working\nand working and working and working and\nhe was trying to make everything perfect\nand he wasn't getting as much time with\nhis children as he wanted to he had two\nchildren under the age of five he wanted\nto spend more time with them he wasn't\nable to spend much time with them\nbecause he was always working and we\nstarted going through and figure out why\nwas working so much what who he was\ntrying to prove himself to all of this\nand it boiled down to after working with\nhim for a few weeks that what he was\ntrying to do is prove that he was was\ngood enough for his father and the\nreason why was because his father had\nthese incredibly high standards for\neverything needed to be perfect to the\npoint where when he would go and put the\nmilk box away his dad would go in and\nopen up the fridge and adjust the milk\nbox so it was perfectly aligned with the\ndoor and so he got this this idea of\nlike oh my God if if I can't even put\nthe milk away correctly I can't do\nanything correctly and it developed this\nfeeling of perfectionism inside of him\nuh this is not always this but you know\nI don't want to make a vast\ngeneralization but I see this a lot not\nin every case but I see this a lot with\npeople who have parents that are in the\nmilitary they the people who are in the\nmilitary a lot of times think well you\nknow the military's done so much for me\nI'm going to raise my children the same\nway that the military raised me but a\nlot of times what that does not in every\ncase once again but a lot of times that\nI've seen with people who have parents\nthat are in the military is there are\nthese impossibly high standards that\nthey can never get to and so it's just\nthis constant stress of always needing\nto be perfect always need need to be\nexact and it just ends up being really\nreally hard for a child to do and it\nbecomes really hard to unprogram someone\nas they become an adult and so that's\nanother example of of how children can\nsee their parent be so hardcore on being\na perfectionist and they can pick it up\nfrom them as well um another example as\nwell that is is you think of like a\nchild who frequently faces criticism um\nfrom their parents for their mistakes or\nyou know any shortcomings they develop\nperfectionism as well as a defense\nmechanism and so what happens is\nwhenever their their their parent\ncriticizes them or whatever it might be\nfor for mistakes or\nshortcomings the child develops this\nfear of criticism which leads them to\ntry to be as perfect as they possibly\ncan and attempt to avoid negative\nfeedback because negative feedback or\ncriticism feels like once again the\nwithdrawal of love from their parents\nand so over time this can create a\nreally intense internal pressure to be\nFlawless in every aspect of life um and\nso when you look at it there's there's\njust many examples where this can happen\nin childhood that create somebody to be\nthis way uh if you think of a child who\ngrew up in a house where there was a lot\nof you know they they developed this as\nA coping strategy this this\nperfectionism so maybe they grew up in a\nhouse with a lot of instability or a lot\nof trauma or uh chaotic fighting and\nfamily environment uh it can also be\nbullying at school and so they try to to\nbe perfect so that therefore they they\nkeep the peace you know quote unquote\nkeep the peace of their parents so they\nkind of try to make everything's perfect\nso therefore their parents don't blow up\nwith them or they try to be perfect so\nthat they know they're not really seen\nby other children so therefore they're\nnot bullied and so you know in some\ncases it can even be physical or\nemotional abuse from the parents and so\nit's like I need to keep the peace I\nneed everything to be perfect so that\ntherefore this doesn't happen and\nsometimes it could be emotional or\nphysical abuse that one parent does to\nanother parent and so the child keeps\ntries to feel like they keep the peace\nwith everybody everything has to be\nperfect all the time because I don't\nwant my dad to physically abuse my\nmother and so this happens over and over\nand over there's many different ways\nthat it comes from but really if you\nfeel like you're perfectionist you\nshould ask yourself where do you think\nthat it came from in your childhood do\nyou think it was one of these and and\nhopefully listening to this something\nhopefully it sparked something inside of\nyou you can see where it's coming from\nfor for you um now as far as this goes\nhow does it show up as an adult when we\nlook at being a perfectionist how does\nit show up an adult as an adult well\nnumber one it's relationships uh\nperfectionism and perfectionists often\nstruggle with intimacy and vulnerability\nin relationships and there's a few\nreasons why um they might fear showing\nany imperfections because that could\nlead to rejection and so what they do is\nthey they it results in having a\nemotional distance like I need to look\nperfect to them and you know I have this\nfeeling of I can't let them in or I\ncan't let them get close because they\nthen they'll know they're real me and so\nit's it ends up being gets in the way\nand kind of throws a big wall in between\nyou and the other person because it's\nlike I got to keep them at a distance\nbecause if they get too close and they\nknow the real me they'll know that I'm\nnot perfect and then they won't love me\nuh it can also show up as constantly\nstriving to be the perfect partner like\ngiving themselves away for the other\nperson and being exactly what the other\nperson wants them to be um sometimes it\ncould also end up being overly critical\nof their loved ones imperfection so\nbecause they're such perfectionist they\ncan look at their other um spouse or the\nboyfriend or girlfriend whoever they're\nin a relationship with and then\nconstantly notice their imperfections\nthey tend to have really high\nexpectations of themsel and criticism of\nthemsel but also of their partner as\nwell and uh that can really get in the\nway of a relationship another place\nwhere it tends to show up is in business\nor at the workplace at work a\nperfectionist might set really\nincredibly unattainable high standards\nfor themselves and that can lead to a\ncouple different things number one it\ncan lead to procrastination because they\nthey have such high standards that they\nfear not meeting those standards and\nthat cause them to delay in their tests\non the opposite side of that they might\noverwork themselves to try to meet their\nimpossibly high standards and that can\nlead to burnout reduce productivity and\nnot getting to where they really want to\nand um you know sometimes the way that\nit shows up is like attention and detail\nand possibly high standards impossibly\nHigh details everything's got to go\nperfect and they go over the details\nover and over and over and over again\nand burn themselves out with it uh it\ncan also show up of of this inability to\ndelegate you know it has to be perfect\nso I have to do it I can't let anybody\nelse do this I had this for a while when\nI had my first business and it rained\ninto the ground right\num it can also really stifle your\ncreativity or your Innovation because\nsometimes what happens is we know what\nwe're good at we know what we can do and\nto be Innovative and be creative means\nwe have to do something different and we\ndon't want to do anything that we've\nnever done before because then we have\nto be a beginner at it and we don't want\nto fail because we're perfectionist\nright so that can be another way that\nshows up in the uh in the business and\nin the workplace as well another place\nwhere it shows up is your mindset and\njust the way that you're thinking about\nyourself you know a lot of times\nperfectionists have this All or Nothing\nmindset where it's they they view any\nminor mistake as total failure and it\nleads to this really negative self-image\nand low self-esteem of themsel and it's\nit's what what's called Black or White\nthinking if you go back to the episode I\ndid a week or two weeks ago about um\ncognitive distortions this is Black or\nWhite thinking and that black or white\nthinking can can hinder their\ndevelopment because they're unable to\nrecognize how they're having these\nlittle tiny incremental improvements\nbecause they're just not seeing those\nthey're seeing all the places where they\nquote unquote failed and so you know\nother places where it can show up as an\nadult is the fear of failure you know we\ncan have this fear of making mistakes\nand that can lead for some people\nchronic anxiety stress and\nperfectionists often experience really\nintense fear or failure which can\nparalyze them and prevent them from\ntaking risks or trying new things uh it\ncan also show up in really low\nself-esteem because they they tend to\nfocus on their perceived flaws and\nshortcomings rather than any strengths\nor achievements that they might have and\nthen the other thing like I said it\ndefinitely shows up a lot of times in\nprocrastination and so let's talk about\nhow to now that we've we've all kind of\ngone oh yeah Rob seems like I'm a\nperfectionist because pretty much most\npeople are at this point uh are a\nperfectionists in some sort of way how\ndo we overcome this perfectionism how do\nwe work through it how do we start to to\nfigure out how to get better the first\nthing is self-compassion some some\nmindfulness some some self-compassion\nokay you have to realize at the age of\nthat Che at right now you have things\nthat have happened to you in your past\nand some of them are good some of them\nare bad some of them are just you know\nneutral we need to reparent ourselves\nand this is something I've been bringing\nup a lot lately which is you know I'm 38\nyears old if something happened to me\nwhere my father didn't show up for me or\nhe wasn't there or he you know had this\nincredibly high standards when I was 9\nor 10 years old I'm basically stuck in\ntime in my brain at that 10 years old\nand I will be honest with you I wasn't\nincredibly emotionally intelligent at 10\nyears old I wasn't intellectually\nintelligent at 10 years old at 38 I can\nsee things way different than I saw them\nback then and so it's time for us to\nkind of reparent ourselves and have more\nself-compassion you know the the\nperfectionism is a behavioral adaptation\nfor something that happened as a child\nwell you're an adult now give yourself\nwhat you feel like you didn't have that\ncreated that adaptation in the first\nplace and usually what that is is\nself-compassion usually that's\ncompassion and usually that's acceptance\nand just accepting yourself Flaws and\nAll there's no such thing as perfect you\nknow that we all know that and so it's\nlike how can we look at oursel with more\ncompassion more acceptance there was a\nstudy that was done and it was called\nself-compassion perfectionism and\nacademic burnout burnout in Asian and\nEurope European American college\nstudents a cross-cultural study and it\nwas done in 2005 and the research went\nthrough and found that\nself-compassion uh you know it kind of\nexplored the role of self-compassion in\nreducing the negative effects of\nperfection perfectionism and the more\nself-compassion that somebody had for\nthemsel the more acceptance that they\nhad for themsel it actually took away\nthe feelings of perfectionism and the\nfeelings of academic burnout and so it\nshowed that higher levels of\nself-compassion were associated with\nlower levels of perfectionism and\nburnout which indicated that the\ninterventions of focusing on mindfulness\nfocusing on self-compassion can be\neffective really in um in mitigating the\nharm and the harmful effects of\nperfectionism and so that's the first\nthing just be nicer to yourself don't be\nsuch an second thing is I know\nyou want to achieve and you want to\noverachieve but start setting realistic\ngoals set some small realistic goals for\nyourself and then remind yourself that\nthat done is better than perfect one of\nmy uh mentors used to always say that is\ndone is better than perfect just get it\ndone because if you want it to be\nperfect it'll probably never be finished\nso like let's just set goals and let's\njust make sure that we focus on things\nbeing done and then the last thing that\nI really want you to do is I want you to\nI want you to embrace failure as a\nlearning opportunity I always say this\nwhen someone joins uh this program I\nhave called business breakthrough it's\nwhere I teach people how to grow their\ncoaching businesses is the the phrase\nthat I say in the very first second\nvideo whatever it is is it up\nand figure it out be okay with messing\nup if you're just holding yourself back\nCU you don't want to mess up you're not\ngoing to get anywhere you have to mess\nup you have to mess up you have to mess\nup failure is just a lesson and you'll\nnever get that lesson if you don't fail\nand so you've got to look at failure as\na as an opportunity to to learn to grow\nto improve you will never be a graceful\nMaster if you're not willing to be a\nfoolish beginner and so don't call\nyourself an impostor don't bring\nyourself down just realize I'm going I'm\ngoing to get better at this and if you\ndo fail it's not the end of the world\njust use it as a way to learn and grow\nand get better and so it's really just\nimportant for you to understand that if\nyou feel like you're a\nperfectionist it's some sort of\nBehavioral Adaptation you created as a\nchild now it has some probably some good\nthings happening in your life right now\nit has some bad things happening in your\nlife right now ultimately if you want to\nchange it there are steps to change it\nall you have to do is you have to give\nyourself more compassion more self-love\nyou have to give yourself more\nacceptance more mindfulness and just\nstart to work through it and say I'm\ngoing to reparent myself I'm going to\ngive myself what is that I didn't need\nand then at that point you don't have to\nbe perfect because there's no one that\nyou're trying to prove yourself to\nanymore because you've already become\nenough for yourself so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on\nInstagram
