    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the root of\nwhy you suffer and how to help yourself\nstop suffering let's dive in I want to\ntalk to you about the difference really\nquickly between pain and suffering\nbecause we kind of put the thing two\nthings together but they're twoo\ncomplete different things so pain is\nbasically the life there is pain pain is\ninevitable um and pain is not always in\nyour control so things happen in life\nyou will you know people get in car\naccidents people you love will die\npeople will get sick um there's many\ndifferent things that will happen\nthroughout your life that are painful\nand pain is inevitable and uh it's not\nalways in control but suffering is in\nour control suffering is our decision\nit's usually an unconscious decision but\nis actually our decision where we\ncontinue to suffer and um there's a\ncouple reasons why we suffer and you\nknow the reason that we kind of suffer\nI'm going to start way back in childhood\nand I'm going to to kind of give you my\nidea and what I've noticed about people\nbecause for me doing what I do now for\n18 years so literally almost half my\nlife basically I'm always thinking like\nwhy are people this way why is it that\nso many people have this feeling deep\ndown inside them this Paradigm this\nidentity of I'm not enough I'm not good\nenough or smart enough or pretty enough\nor I'll never be successful never make\nenough money I might not be able to\nsupport my children what if this happens\nwhat if that happens and so so if we go\nback to Childhood when you look at a\nchild and you look at a young child\nthey're them they true selves like if\nyou ever see like a a one-year-old a\ntwo-year-old a three-year-old they are\ntheir true selves and it you know things\nhappen and you know if if if you're\nchanging a baby's diaper and they are 6\nmonths old and you have your your coffee\nnext to you and their leg kicks the\ncoffee and knocks it off the table\nyou're not going to yell at the child\nthey're 6 months old they don't know\nwhat they're doing same thing might\nhappen maybe they're a year old they're\nstarting to learn how to walk they go\nand they knock coffee off the table\nyou're not going to yell at them because\nthey're still not really knowing what\nthey're doing but at some point in time\nthat exact same thing or something like\nit this just an example could happen to\na three-year-old or a four-year-old\nwhere they can knock something off and\nthe parent will yell at them or and it's\nlike they should know better is kind of\nthe way that they're treated right or a\nchild is being too loud they're\nscreaming in a restaurant and the parent\nends up you know hushing them they scorn\nthem for it in some sort of way or\nthey're they're running around public\nand they're being they're loud and\nrambunctious and truest version of thems\nand they get yelled at to stop running\nto be quiet the average child is\nreprimanded eight times more than\nthey're praised which means that the\naverage child thinks to themsel I am not\nenough eight times more than they think\nthat they are enough and the problem is\nbecause of children's\nperception they think when they're being\nyelled at that it is a retraction of\nlove from their\nparents and so they want to get their\nparents l so they start thinking to\nthemselves subconsciously we all think\nthis to ourselves we've all been through\nthis process most likely I need to\nchange myself for me to not be\nreprimanded as much so that I can get my\nparents' love right you following me and\nso what we do is we change ourselves\nwe're not as loud we're not as\nrambunctious we become who we need to\nbecome in order to fit in and so what we\nhave done is we have in in a sense at\nsome point in time all of us abandoned\nour true self in order to fit in and so\nwe learned that our true self does not\nfit in with our parents at first this is\nour perception of it even if your\nparents are just very loving but they're\nan average parent which is reprimanded\nchild eight times more than their praise\nand sometimes you got to repr children\nthey're crazy they want to jump off of a\nwall and they could injure thems and so\nthey're thinking TOS like I I'm not\nsmart enough I don't know what I'm doing\nI'm not good enough my parents are\nretracted my love and all of this is\nsubconscious but we learn first off that\nour true self does not fit in with our\nparents is kind of what we think and\nthen we get old and we realize that our\ntrue self doesn't fit in with society\nand we've got to change ourself and mold\nourself we think to fit in and so\nthere's a uh a a guy named uh saurin\nKirkland I'm saying the name Kirk\nkirkgard I can't pronounce his last name\nit's a it's a heck of a last name uh\nhe's a a Danish philosopher and he\nbasically broke down the way that most\npeople kind of go through and become\nsomeone that they're not and so what\nhappens is we get to this point of\nunconsciously we think to ourselves I\nwish to be someone other than I am right\nso as children we change ourselves from\nchildhood to fit in first we change from\nour parents uh then we change so that we\nfit in with other children and then we\ngo into middle school if you guys\nremember Middle School is really hard\nand you have to fit in with all the\nother kids and try to be part of a crew\nand be like them and act like them high\nschool is the same way and then we go\nand we go to college and we either do\nwhat our parents tell us to do we do\nwhat we think Society wants us to do or\nsomething that we can do to make money\nso that we could keep up with the\nJoneses all of it is some different\ndisguise of fitting in and fitting in\nbasically means abandoning our true self\nnot being our trueu self and being\nsomething that we think we need to be in\norder to fit in so we become what we\nthink we need to become in order to fit\nin with other people with Society with\nother children with our parents as a\nchild and this is also why so many\npeople become people Pleasers as well we\nare like you know as as a if someone's a\npeople pleaser like I'm going to abandon\nmy true self so that I can please this\nperson and so when you decide usually\nsubconsciously especially as a child and\nthen as you get older it can be actually\na conscious thought I want to be\ndifferent than I am I want to be someone\ndifferent than I actually truly am I\nwant to be different than I am\none of two things happens number one we\ntry to become someone else and so we\nbecome someone else and we try and we\ntry and we try and we fail at becoming\nsomeone\nelse and we realize we can't become\nsomeone else we are the same that we've\nalways been and then what we do is we\ndespise oursel for it we get kind of mad\nat oursel I why can't I change myself\nwhy can't I be someone else and this\nwill all make sense I pulled all\ntogether but I fail at becoming someone\nelse and I myself for not being able to\ndo it I despise myself for failing I\ndespise myself for being for for not\nbeing who I want to be why can't I just\nbe different why can't I be different\nthan I am why can't I be more of this or\nmore of that or why can't I look more\nlike this or more like that or less like\nthis or less like that we want to change\nourselves the foundation of this thought\nis I don't want to be who I\nam so we can either go and we can try to\nchange oursel and we can fail at trying\nto be someone else or the other route we\ncould succeed at becoming someone else\nand we abandon our true self and so we\nbecome someone completely different than\nwe truly are I lose myself in a\ncharacter that I have to play and it's\nkind of like you've heard me say it over\nand over again and I talk about it in my\nbook level up where I talk about Jim\nCarrey when he ends up being a method\nactor and he ends up playing Andy\nKaufman and he loses himself in the role\nand months down the road after he stops\nplaying Andy Kaufman he's like I don't\nremember who Jim Carrey was and that was\nlike the The Awakening his spiritual\nawakening of like he realized that Jim\nCarrey was just a character that he was\nplaying it wasn't his true self and so\nwe can succeed at not being ourselves\nand we can succeed and abandon our true\nselves and be someone else and we lose\noursel in a character they have to play\nbut the foundation of that is exactly\nsame as the foundation of the other one\nthe foundation is I don't want to be who\nI am I don't want to be who I am either\nway I lose my true\nself and this is where you really start\nto see and it starts to the pieces start\nto come together either way I lose my\ntrue self I disconnect from who I truly\nam that little boy that's inside of me\nthat I was when I was 2 years old and 3\nyears old and I would go on a walk with\nmy mom and I'd pick up flowers for her\ni' pick up rocks and I give it to her I\ndisconnect from who I truly am we lose\nthat version of oursel which is our\ntruest version of\noursel and we disconnect from who we\ntruly are either we disconnect from who\nwe truly are and we become somebody else\nor you know pretend like we're someone\nelse or we try to become someone else\nand we fail at it and then we despise\nour true s for it and when I disconnect\nfrom who I truly am that's never going\nto make me happy it will never bring me\ntrue peace to not be who I truly am it\nwill never bring me true peace to be\nsomeone other than I truly am resisting\nyour true self is the thing that causes\nso much turmoil inside of you and so we\nget so far away from who we truly\nare that we don't really know who we are\nanymore and you might be listening this\npodcast because you started to become\naware of that took me years to become\naware of like who the am I like I\nI've been playing this game to be\nsomebody else and acting like I want to\nbe this and I don't I don't want to be\nwho I am but I want to be my true self\nand I don't know who my true self is and\nI don't know who who I've been\npretending to be and it can be a a rude\nawakening and a lot of people can have a\na midlife crisis of like I what did I\nwhat is this this life that I built\nisn't even a life that I truly want it's\nlike a life that I felt like I was\nsupposed to build and so we get so far\naway from who we truly are that we don't\nreally know who we truly are anymore and\nmaybe I have to you know make myself\ntough because the world is tough and it\nwill beat me up but really deep down\ninside I'm just that soft emotional\nbeing that just wants love like one of\nthe things for me that I realized years\nago uh I I kind of woke up to the fact\nthrough a root Awakening and I've told\nthis story many times before but one of\nmy mentors took me out and uh to lunch\nto Chipotle we had burritos and um you\nknow I was like 21 years old I was\nrunning the number one office in a\ncompany that was you know had 700\noffices and he's like hey man I don't\nknow how to tell you this but a lot of\npeople don't like you I was like what\nare you talking about like I thought it\nwas hot I was I was awesome I was\nrunning the number one office in in the\nUnited States in this $200 million\ncompany I thought it was great he's like\na lot of people don't like you I was\nlike what do you mean and he's like the\nperson that you present is not who you\ntruly are he's like I've known you for a\ncouple years now I know your true self I\nknow who you truly are and you're you're\nyou're really not the same person that\nyou present and I was like what do you\nmean by that I started to realize that I\nwas presenting this really Brash\naggressive person and I would you know\ntry to cut you first so you would never\ntry to cut me because because I was so\nweak and so afraid of being vulnerable\nthat I wanted to essentially keep people\nat a\ndistance so that you couldn't see my\ntrue self right because I didn't know\nwho my true self was I was afraid of my\ntrue self and so deep down it's like I I\nI would try to hurt someone first and\nkeep them at a distance keep them at\narms length right when really deep down\nI was just that little boy that soft\nemotional being that just picked flowers\nfor his mom right and the only way that\nyou will find true peace is to be who\nyou truly are to stop resisting all of\nthe ways that you truly are to stop\ntrying to be someone that you're not and\nto fully accept who you truly are\nbecause ultimately we all get lost and\nthe only way to really truly find\nyourself is to Lose Yourself you cannot\nfind yourself if you don't lose yourself\nfirst so if you are the type of person\nwhere you're out there and you're\nlistening to me and you're like oh my\nGod I'm so lost this makes sense I don't\nknow who the I am you're in the\nperfect position cuz you have to Lose\nYourself yourself to find yourself to\nescape despair anxiety depression all of\nthat that we can get from it I must I\nmust accept my true\nself and you know saurin the the\nphilosopher said that despair vanishes\nwhen we stop denying who we are who we\nreally are and attempt to uncover and\naccept our true self despair vanishes\nwhen we stop denying who we really are\nand we attempt to uncover and accept our\ntrue self so we must go on this path of\nself-discovery and it's not like an\novernight thing it's probably the rest\nof your life it's a year long years and\nyears and years it's a journey to\nReDiscover you know I'm about to be 38\nyears old right I've I've had 38 years\noff the path it's going to take me at\nleast 38 years try to try to find myself\nback on the path right so what is that\n76 hopefully I'll find myself fully by\n76 but there's it's a journey there is\nno destination to it and so we must all\ngo on the path of self-discovery and now\nwhen I say when I say to you except who\nyou truly are I mean and I really mean\nwho you are every aspect of you and the\nquote unquote good and the quote unquote\nbad both of those neither is there is\nthere is no good side of you and there's\nno bad side of you because the title of\nbad makes us want to resist it makes us\nwant to get rid of it but in all aspects\nI mean the whole organism of who you are\nthe labeling of the good and bad is part\nof the problem so accept that there are\nsides of you that are great\nonce again I'm labeling I understand\nthere's sides of you that are great\nthough there's sides of you that are\nsweet sides of you that are loving there\nare sides of you that are great to be\naround there's sides of you that are\nreally nice and some people get to see\nthat right you've got to accept those\nsides of you but if you're going to\naccept those sides of you you've also\ngot to accept the sides of you that are\njust a little bit shitty sometimes right\nwe're all a little bit selfish we're all\njudgmental we're all arrogant in some\nways we all can be Brash and rude and\nyou know thinking of ourselves all of\nthat stuff so there are great parts of\nyou once again I'm labeling and I\nunderstand that the labeling is just not\nhelping here but I'm just using it as an\nexample there's great sides of you and\ntheir shitty sides of you the path is\nreally accepting the good sides but more\nthan anything else is really accepting\nthe other sides of you the lack of OB of\nAcceptance in them is what's causing the\ninternal resistance to see the selfish\nshot of you and be like I don't want to\nbe that anymore is actually causing even\nmore resistance but when you see the\nselfish side of you and you say yeah do\nyou know what there is a selfish side of\nme that exists that's okay because\nthat's just part of Being Human there is\na judgmental side of me that's okay it's\npart of Being Human there's an arrogance\nout of me it's okay that's part of being\nhuman and it's kind of like a symphony\nyou know like there's a symphony of\naspects of different parts of our self\nbut you know the selfish side doesn't\nhave to be you know doing a solo in the\nsymphony all day long it could come up\nsometimes and go away sometimes\nsometimes there is benefit in being\nselfish sometimes there's not sometimes\nthere is benefit in being judgmental\nsometimes there's not and so it's about\naccepting every single aspect of our s\nnow really what it comes down to is when\nwe look at the the the basis of the real\nproblem the foundation was I don't want\nto be who I am and that's what causes\nall of the problems so if I don't want\nto be who I am is what causes all the\nproblems what mindset would fix all the\nproblems I love myself as I\nam the love and acceptance that you're\nsearching for from other people in this\nworld is actually true the love and\nacceptance that you're searching for\nyourself I love every part of me the\namazing Rob and the shitty Rob right as\nAlan watt says the scoundrel you have to\nlove every single part of you now I know\nwhat's coming up in some of your minds\nbecause this happened to me is if I\naccept myself if I love myself will I\nlose motivation why don't I get lazy\nwhat am I just going to sit around and\njust pure Bliss I don't and that like\nnothing's going to become of my life no\nno no you won't lose motivation if my\nlove if I love myself will I get lazy\nlike that's pretty wild to actually\nthink about right as if we have to hate\nourselves and who we currently are in\norder to be\nmotivated that doesn't make any sense it\nmakes moving and in all honesty the\nmotivation doesn't change but it makes\nmoving through this world so much easier\nbecause you don't feel like you have a\nbackpack that's just this weight on your\nyour back all day long and it makes when\nyou just decide to love and accept\nyourself every aspect of yourself it\ndoesn't make you less motivated but it\nmakes it so much easier to move through\nthis world so instead of feeling uh\ninstead of feeling like life and success\nis like pushing a boulder up a hill and\nall of that it's just kind of like you\nknow it feels a little bit easier it's\nlike jumping in a river and letting the\nriver just kind of take you it's full\nalignment and it's picking up the great\nthings in life that pass you along in\nthe river it becomes much more\neffortless life becomes much more\neffortless because there's not that\ninternal resistance fighting who we are\nat all moments and we think you know and\nI've caught myself here before we think\nthat becoming successful will make us\nfeel better it won't I promise you that\nthere's many successful people that end\nup killing themselves because it doesn't\nmake them feel any better about\nthemselves nothing changes depending on\nhow much money you have in your bank\naccount money in your bank account is\njust a thing just like I'm wearing a you\nknow a white colored shirt right now\nthat's just a thing it's not it doesn't\nmake me who I am so the white colored\nshirt doesn't make me who I am just as\nfar as the money in my bank account\ndoesn't make me who I am so becoming\nsuccessful we think will make us feel\nbetter but nothing changes you know\nbuying the house that's all big and nice\nwe think will make us feel better but\nnothing changes the car the clothes the\nmillions of dollars in the bank account\nall of those things nothing changes you\nstill feel the same internally nothing\nyou could ever do or achieve can make\nyou more or less than what you currently\nare are you more of a human now or less\nof a human now than if you made a\nmillion dollars in a year no no million\ndollars a going to make you more or less\nof a human it just happens to be a thing\nright are you more of a human when you\nbuy a house no and like there's a\nmeditation i' I've brought in quite a\nfew times it's from a guy named Muji m o\noji that I've done it's like a 20-minute\nguided meditation I used to do years ago\nand one of the things he used to always\nsay is you have no pockets you have no\nStorehouse and what he means by that is\nthat you are this naked human with\nnothing on you you have no pockets you\nhave no Storehouse when you came into\nthis world you were naked when you leave\nthis world you're going to be naked and\nyou will not be able to bring anything\nwith you you have no pockets to bring\nwith you into the Afterlife you have no\nStorehouse to bring with you in the\nafterlife so nothing that you could do\nwill ever make you more than what you\ncurrently are right\nnow so you know if you'll die naked\nexactly as you came that means that\nnothing could ever add to you or take\naway from you which means that as you\ncurrently are you're already perfect the\nonly thing that's actually missing is\nyour acceptance of yourself which\nultimately is what it comes down to\nacceptance of yourself as you are all\naspects of yourself no matter what\nlisten to this one again try it on
