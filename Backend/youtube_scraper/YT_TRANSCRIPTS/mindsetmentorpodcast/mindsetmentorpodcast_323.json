    "transcript": "welcome today I'm going to be talking\nwith scientific proof of ways to\nactually change your brain to be more\npositive let's dive in this is not going\nto be anything that's weird and out\nthere I'm going to slam you with\nscientific proof today to the point\nwhere you're going to be like is he\nstill telling me more studies and the\nanswer is yes cuz I really want to\nhammer in home that actually thinking\npositive can change the structure and\nfunction of your brain and I'm going to\ntell you exactly how to do it I'm going\nto not just going to sit here and be\nlike a motivational speaker that can't\nroot anything back in science no no no\nwe're proving it today because research\nhas shown over and over and over again\nthat positive thoughts have a massive\nimpact on the structure of your brain\nand when the structure of your brain\nchanges the function of your brain\nlongterm will change as well in fact\nit's very similar to how um physical\nexercise gradually changes the body if\nyou do it over and over and over again\npositive brain workouts help form new\nneural Pathways that can disrupt your\nnegative thinking patterns leading to\nlong lasting changes in your cognitive\nfunction which help you think better and\nactually help your brain work better and\nso to understand how this works let's\nfirst take a look at just the brain\nitself your brain is basically this\nlittle this little mushy thing that's\nmade up of billion ions and billions of\nneurons which are specialized cells that\ntransmit information throughout the\nbrain and the nervous system and these\nneurons are connected through things\ncalled synapses which help them\ncommunicate with one another and when\nyou think a thought or you perform a\ncertain action or task in some sort of\nway your neurons are going to fire in a\nparticular pattern that corresponds with\nthat thought or with that action and\nthere's a real famous phrase the most\nfamous phrase around neurology is neur\nNE that fire together wire together fire\ntogether basically just means an\nelectrical signal and then they wire\ntogether which means they create an\nelectrical connection and over time\nrepeated patterns of thought or behavior\npositive negative whatever it might be\njust repeated patterns of thought and\nbehavior can actually change the\nstructure of your brain and this is\nknown as neuroplasticity this is what\nallows your brain to adapt and learn new\nthings throughout your entire life so\nwe've all heard the phrase you can't\nteach an old dog new tricks completely\nfalse you definitely can it's just as\nyou get older it becomes a little bit\nharder to learn things or to change but\nit does not mean that you cannot change\nso for example you know if you if you\nsit and you decide I've never played the\npiano before but I'm going to sit down\nfor an hour a day and I'm going to\npractice the piano every single day the\nareas of your brain responsible for\nprocessing music become more developed\nand more efficient I have an entire EP\nnot an episode I have entire chapter in\nmy book my book level up that is\nspecifically around neuroplasticity and\nit is so fascinating to me how we can\nchange our brains whenever we put\ndedicated practice into something and\nhow people who have the P who play the\npiano their brains end up changing and\nbeing different people who drive taxis\nin London their their brains end up\nbeing different because they have to\nmemorize every single Road that's in uh\nthat's in London and so the same is\npositive for I'm sorry the same is the\nsame is true for positive thoughts so\nthe same way that if I decide to learn\npiano my brain is going to change if I\ndecide that I'm no longer going to be\nnegative my brain is going to change\nit's not going to change overnight but\nit's going to change if I continue to\nkeep being very intentional and when you\nconsciously focus on positive thoughts\nyou activate certain neural Pathways in\nthe brain that correspond with those\nthoughts and over time those Pathways\nbecome stronger and stronger and\nstronger and as they become stronger\nthey become more efficient and as they\nbecome more efficient it actually makes\nit easier for you to access positive\nthoughts and emotions in the\nfuture that's what's crazy you could be\nnegative as hell right now but decide\nI'm no longer going to be negative I'm\ngoing to find the good in everything I'm\ngoing to be positive and as you do it\nover and over and over those neural\nPathways become stronger and stronger\nand stronger and as they become stronger\nthey become more efficient which makes\nit easier for you to access positive\nthoughts and emotions wow that's pretty\ndamn crazy right this is why positive\nthinking is often referred to as a brain\nworkout it's just like an a real workout\nlike physical exercise strengthens your\nmuscles positive thinking actually\nstrengthens your brain once again I'm\ngoing to give you science don't you\nworry I'm not just saying this as some\nlike rah rah high five motivational\nspeaker because that's not what I want\nto be and this is why you can meet\nsomebody who's always happy and you're\nlike what the how are you always so\nhappy right like I like how do you do it\nright like I've thought them you're so\nhappy all the time you're so positive\nall the time right but you also can meet\nsomebody and they're always always sad\nall the time they're always negative all\nthe time and you're like this person's\nnot fun to be around all of that whether\nit's the sadness whether it's the\nhappiness when there's a positive all of\nit is just a habit it's just a habitual\nway of thinking and if this is true for\npositive thinking then the opposite must\nalso be true negative thinking can also\nhave a really huge impact on your brain\nas well when you consistently think\nnegative thoughts you activate neural\nPathways that correspond with those\nthoughts same way that you do with\npositive they're just ones and over time\nthose Pathways become stronger and more\nefficient making it easier for you to\naccess negative thoughts and emotions in\nthe future and this is why negative\nthought like negative thought patterns\nnegative thinking being a little\nNegative Nancy can be so hard to\nbreak you can see someone and it's just\nlike they they're so miserable and even\nif they don't want to be miserable\nanymore they it's so hard for them to\nstop being miserable it's hard to break\nbecause as you continue to keep doing\nthem over and over and over again it\nbecomes easier to do and they become\ndeeply ingrained in the structure of\nyour brain but the good news is is that\nwith with a lot of time well well first\noff with awareness of what you are\nthinking how you're acting in time and\nattention and intention you can disrupt\nthese negative thinking patterns and\nconsciously start focusing on thoughts\nthat are more positive when you\nintentionally choose to think positively\nyou activate different neural Pathways\nin your brain that correspond to those\nthoughts you activate different neural\nPathways than the negative thoughts and\nneurons that fire together wire together\nand over time these Pathways become\nstronger and more efficient and\neventually they disrupt the negative\npatterns making it easier for you to\naccess positive thoughts and emotions\nand recently I told you guys about like\nI used to be such a Negative person I\nused to be such a pessimistic person I\nwas such a Negative Nancy and over time\nI was like I don't want to be this way\nanymore this is not who I want to be in\nthe future like just just a negative\nlittle person nobody want I don't want\nto be that and so I started changing the\nway that I thought every time I thought\nnegative I'd force myself to find the\npositive every time I thought negative I\nforced myself to find a positive over\nand over and over again the same way\nthat you train a dog if it goes potty\ninside you take it outside it goes potty\ninside You Take It Outside over and over\nand over again eventually the dog just\ngoes oh I I go potty outside right it's\nthe same way that you train your brain I\nwas negative I'm going to be positive I\nwas negative I'm going to be positive\nover and over and over again eventually\nyour brain just starts neing neing\nlearning new neural Pathways and so\nreally that's what it comes down to and\nyou might be like all right cool hippie\nbut is there real science can we root\nthis in real science or you just saying\nrahah high five go do it be positive it\nchanges your brain and there's no\nstudies behind it oh ready there are\nmany many studies I've researched the\nhell out of this just to make sure that\nthe most pessimistic person that's out\nthere the most analytical person and and\nthe most skeptical person allinone would\ngo well damn yeah this actually seems to\nhold it seems to hold water I'm guessing\nthis that this is the truth okay so I'm\ngoing to give you a bunch of different\nstudies you ready one study published in\nthe Journal of psychiatric research\nfound that practicing positive\naffirmations for just four weeks led to\nsignificant changes in the brain in\nareas that were associated with\nself-related processing and emotional\nregulation participants in the study\nreported feeling less anxious\nand more self-confident after practicing\npositive affirmations and these changes\nwere reflected in their brain\nactivity want another study let's keep\ngoing another study published in the\nJournal of social cognitive and\neffective Neuroscience found that when\nparticipants were trained to focus on\npositive images instead of negative ones\nthey experienced changes in the brain\nactivity in areas associated with\nemotional regulation and intentional\ncontrol these changes were still present\n6 months after the training ended\nsuggesting that the effects of positive\nthinking are actually longlasting there\nwas another study neuroimaging Studies\nhave shown that positive thinking can\nincrease activity in the prefrontal\ncortex of your brain which is the part\nof the brain that's responsible for\nexecutive functions such as\ndecision-making planning and impulse\ncontrol another study that came out have\nshown or many Studies have shown that\npositive thinking can actually decrease\nactivity in the amydala which is the\npart of the brain that's responsible for\nfear and other negative emotions so\npositive thinking actually decreases the\nblood flow in the amydala which means\nless fear is going to pop up a study\nthat was in the Journal of cerebral\ncortex I don't even know that was a\njournal the cerebral cortex Journal\nfound that people who practiced\nmindfulness meditation had greater gray\nmatter gray matter density in the the\nprefrontal cortex of their brain which\nis associated with cognitive control and\nemotional regulation research has also\nshown that positive thinking can\nincrease the production of\nneurotransmitters such as dopamine and\nserotonin which are both associated with\nfeelings of happiness and well-being and\nbeing more motivated Studies have also\nfound that positive thinking can improve\ncognitive performance in tasks such as\nproblem solving decision-making and\nworking memory a study that was\npublished in the Journal of oh God let\nme try my best psychon neuro\nendrocrinology that might be the longest\nword I've ever seen psycho that's one\nword everybody psychon neuro\nendrocrinology found that people who\nwrote about positive experiences had\nlower levels of stress hormone cortisol\nthan those who wrote about negative\nexperiences research has also shown that\npositive thinking can improve physical\nhealth outcomes such as reducing\ninflammation and improving\ncardiovascular house that's a crazy to\nthink about positive thinking reduces\ninflammation in your body and improves\ncardiovascular health so it's not just\nyour brain that that changes your body\nalso changes all right we're almost done\nwe got a couple more okay\nneuroplasticity Studies have shown that\nthe brain is capable of changing and\nadapting throughout our lifetime and\nthat positive experiences and thoughts\nhelp shape the processes and the\nefficiency of the brain uh a study that\nwas published in the Journal of Nature\nNeuroscience found that people who\nreceive positive feedback during a\nlearning task had increased activity in\nstriatum which is associated with reward\nprocessing and reinforcement learning\nso does positive thinking actually\nchange your brain scientifically the\nanswer is yes that is the most studies\nI've ever put into one podcast episode\nof course it's important to note that\npositive thinking alone is not some like\nmagic cure all for all mental health\nissues I'm not saying that when\nsomething comes up and you know you're\nfeeling like complete that you're\njust like hey everything's going to be\nokay everything's going to be okay\neverything's going to be okay that's not\nwhat I'm saying what I'm saying is is\nthere a way for us to try to start\nsearching for a little bit more\npositivity when something happens can we\nlook at it through a positive light if\nsomething negative happens in our life\ncan we look it through a positive light\nso that not not so that we ignore the\nnegative but so that we can actually\ntake on the negative in a more of a\npositive way so it's not a cure all for\nmental health issues for instance for\npeople that have like clinical\ndepression positive thinking exercises\nmight not be enough to alleviate their\nsymptoms but there's many stes that show\njust practicing positive thinking can be\nhelpful as a a complement to forms of\ntherapy that they might have or\nmedication that they might be using and\nso how do we start actually taking this\nand now that you've realized that it\nworks how do we take this positive\nthinking and we put it into your daily\nroutine well let's let's dive in I'm\ngoing to give you a few different\ntechniques and some tips to help you the\nfirst thing as corny as it sounds is to\npractice gratitude right take a few\nminutes a day to just write down three\nthings that you're grateful\nfor all too often our brain goes to\nnegative it looks for what is wrong in\nour environment and it does that as a as\na way to keep us safe it searches for\nwhat is wrong and so what we need to do\nif that's the case is we need to search\nfor what is right we need to search for\nwhat we can be grateful for and so what\nwe need to do is we need to find three\nthings that we're grateful for early in\nthe morning not late at night but early\nin the morning when your brain is still\nkind of waking up it's still kind of in\nTheta State because Theta is the most\nprogrammable state that you can be in\nand so uh a simple exercise like this\ncan just help shift your focus from\nwhat's wrong in your life to what's\ngoing right or what you can be proud of\nor what you can find that's good and it\ndoesn't have to be huge things doesn't\nbe like oh my God I bought a new house\nit could be like hey it's a beautiful\nsunny day outside um I get to go have\ndinner with a friend tonight could be\nsomething like that right that's the\nfirst thing practice gratitude next\nthing is use positive affirmations I\ngave you multiple studies that show that\npositive affirmations actually start to\nchange the way that you view yourself\nand so instead of saying you know don't\nlie to yourself but if you say I am\ncapable and I am confident or if you\nfeel like you're unlovable I am worthy\nof love I'm worthy of respect and repeat\nthem to yourself all throughout the day\nbecause all too often we have a\nnarrative that's going on in our heads\nand it's not really a story that's uh\nhelping us and so really what it comes\ndown to is how can I change the\nnarrative that's going on in my head you\ncan also write them down uh on sticky\nnotes you can place them all around your\nhouse your workspace\neverything next thing is how can you try\nto surround yourself with more\npositivity can you start spending can\nyou can be more intentional with who you\nspend your time with right the people\nthat you spend your time with you have\nreally negative people around you\nthey're going to you know change your\nmental health so can you spend more time\nwith people who lift you up who make you\nfeel good about yourself avoid negative\npeople and start to to get into the the\nenergy of more positive people another\nthing is to practice\nmindfulness sit down be quiet and become\naware of your thoughts you know a lot of\npeople think that sitting down and\nmeditating is about trying to turn your\nbrain off it's really not what it's\nabout is to take out all the the the\nthings that you're seeing all the things\nthat you're doing and to take a moment\njust to be with yourself and it's not\nabout getting rid of your thoughts it's\nabout observing your thoughts so when\nyou sit down and you meditate you start\nto become more aware of your thoughts\nyou start to become more aware of your\nemotions you're just trying to be with\nyourself a little bit more which can\nhelp you develop much more of a positive\nmindset oh man I'm noticing that when I\nsit down and meditate I'm immediately\ngoing to anxious thoughts anxious\nfeelings okay what do I need to do to\nchange that another thing you can do\nthat really helps is to start getting\nbetter with your your selft talk uh a\nlot of times most people that I come in\ncontact with are not really the nicest\nthey're kind of shitty to them M\nthemselves and so when you catch\nyourself with negative thinking and and\nand having negative thoughts challenge\nyourself to change them with with\npositive thoughts that immediately come\nback so if you you say something\nnegatively about yourself and you notice\nit become aware of it immediately\nreplace that with three positive things\nthat you like about yourself right and\nthat's slowly how you start repatterning\nyourself so if you start thinking you\nfind yourself thinking I'm not good\nenough well counter that with I'm\ncapable I'm deserving of success what\nelse that you that you need to here how\ndo you need to be your best friend how\ndo you need to be the person that's in\nyour corner that's building yourself up\ninstead of breaking yourself down\nremember practicing positive thinking\nit's a process it's not going to happen\novernight you're not going to be\npositive today and wake up tomorrow and\njust immediately be like oh my God I'm\nso positive but when you're really\nconsistent consistent with it when you\npractice it all the time you can\nactually change your mindset you can\nactually change the structure of your\nbrain through those long lasting changes\nand when you change the structure of\nyour brain the function of your brain\nchanges and the cognitive function that\nhappens inside of your brain actually\nstarts to change and adjust as well so\nhope I prove to you that there's\nscientific proof that positive thinking\nactually changes your brain for the\nbetter so with that I'm going to leave\nyou the same way I leave you every\nsingle episode make get your mission\nmake somebody else's day better I\nappreciate you and I hope that you have\nan amazing day"
