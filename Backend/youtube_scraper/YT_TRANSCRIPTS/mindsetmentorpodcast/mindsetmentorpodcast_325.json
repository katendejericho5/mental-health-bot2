    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be teaching you how to actually\nchange the way that you feel and change\nthe actions that you take to create the\nlife that you want through repatterning\nyourself every single moment let's dive\nin so this isn't going to be based in\nsome weird pseudo science this is\nactually going to be based in Psychology\nand cognitive behavioral therapy and I'm\ngoing to give you a specific behavioral\ntechnique to Tech technique my goodness\nto actually start to change yourself and\nrewire your brain so you know when you\nlook at life often times what we do most\ntimes what we do is that we take actions\nthat line up with how we feel so it's a\nreally important part probably the most\nimportant part to understand for today\nwe feel a certain way and almost always\nwe take actions that line up with how we\nfeel and that's all good it's all great\nwhen you're having a really good day\nwhen the sun is shining you've had your\ncup of coffee you got a good night's\nsleep and you're like yeah today's\nawesome it's great in those cases but\nwhat about the days when you weren't\nquote unquote feeling it as much you\nknow you you've been there before where\nyou're not we've all said it I'm not\nreally feeling it today maybe you got\nreally crappy sleep maybe you don't feel\nall that upbeat maybe it's sun's not\nshining and you don't really feel like\ntalking to anybody you're like I just\ndon't really want to talk to somebody\nand then your phone\nrings you're like uh I'll just send it\nto voicemail and then you know you call\na friend that you supposed to have\ndinner with tonight you're like hey I I\ndon't really feel like going out tonight\nI just I'm just going to stay home and\nyou decide to to stay home and it's a\nlittle teeny tiny thing like this right\nhere is a very small example but it's a\nlittle teeny tiny thing oh you don't you\ndon't really feel up to it so you don't\nanswer your phone you don't get back to\npeople you cancel the dinner that you\ngoing to have your friend it's it's\nteeny teeny tiny things and most of the\ntime they go unnoticeable but but you do\nthis all day long you unconsciously make\ndecisions based off of how you\nfeel what happens though when you end up\nbringing this to work oh yeah you don't\nreally feel all that good and now you\ngot to go to work and maybe you're a\nmanager and you have some people that\nyou really do care about on your team\nand you're not really feeling it today\nand so you you know what you cancel that\nmeeting that you had with your team to\nhelp them improve and get better you\ndon't do that one-on-one meeting with\nyour most important team member and then\nwhat happens when you end up getting off\nwork and you are supposed to go work out\nwhat happens to your Fitness routine ah\nyou know what I'm G to skip the gym\ntoday just not really feeling it today\nwas just so long wasn't a great day our\nfeelings will always influence our\nactions and if we're not conscious of it\nwill create our entire life because your\nthoughts create your feelings your\nfeelings create your actions your\nactions create your results and your\nresults end up making your entire life\nand you know it can even be something\nlike having a bad day at work which\ninfluences how you feel and now you\nbring that home and put it on your\nfamily and you put it on your spouse and\nyou put it on your children and they get\nthe bad end of your\nemotions and then when you calm down you\nregret how you acted this problem the\nproblem is that uh it's the problem is\nwhen you act consistent with how you\nfeel those actions and feelings become\nmore hardwired into you as you continue\nto do them and be they become a pattern\nfor you and clearly this is not a\npattern that you want now before we go\nany further I want to say this because I\ndon't want to be misunderstood in this\nI'm not saying don't feel your feelings\nI'm not saying don't feel your emotions\nI'm not saying become a a shell of\nyourself and just push away all feelings\nand emotions and all your humanness I'm\nnot saying that I'm saying what I really\nwant you to be aware of is how little\nteeny tiny\nfeelings make you change the way that\nyou act so for instance let's say that\nyou're you're you feel sad or you're in\na low State and you decide to isolate\nyourself it's a Saturday I'm not really\nfeeling today I'm kind of sad today I\ndon't know why I'm kind of melancholy\nkind of in a low state I'm going to\ndecide to stay in today I'm going to\nisolate myself and most times\nisolation leads to more sadness and so\nif you're staying in your room your\nmessage to your brain might be I'm sad\nwhich makes you more likely to stay in\nanother day and then can increase the\nsadness of how you feel when being\naround someone that you really care\nabout and cares about you might actually\nhelp you get out of that feeling of\nsadness or Melancholy or the low State\nmuch quicker when we take actions that\nline up with how we\nfeel often times what we're doing is\nwe're adding fuel to the fire when we\ntake actions that line up with how we\nfeel which is what we unconsciously do\nall day long often times it's like\nadding fuel to the fire so what do we do\nwell there's a thing in Psychology\nthat's called uh behavioral activation\nand behavioral activation basically\nmeans when we identify how we feel and\nwe don't want to feel that way we do the\nopposite of how we feel once again not\nsaying don't be a human not saying don't\nfeel your emotions what I'm saying\nthough is that sometimes when it ends up\nbeing too long and it just continues to\nkeep going you're actually digging the\nwhole deeper so we identify how we feel\nand if that feeling is not how we want\nto feel we do the opposite of how we\nfeel because when we act in ways that\nare the opposite of how you're feeling\nthe feedback loop to the brain does not\nconfirm the emotion and in most cases it\neases that emotion and can even change\nthe way that you're\nfeeling so this is really important by\nacting how we feel we are confirming\nthat\nfeeling okay when we act how we feel we\nare confirming that feeling but by\nacting the opposite of how we feel we\nare not confirming it in our brain and\nin turn makes it easier for us to change\nthat\nfeeling interesting right right so if we\nwant to start repatterning oursel we\nneed to actually start acting the\nopposite of how we\nfeel start acting different than how we\nfeel and so I'll give you a lot of\nexamples today so you can just kind of\nsee how you fit within yourself and so\nif you feel like isolating yourself then\nwhat you really need to do is when you\nbecome\naware you know what I feel like staying\nin I feel like isolating myself I don't\nfeel good I feel kind of sad today call\na friend to come over and hang out with\nyou that will make you feel better or\ncall a friend and and or FaceTime with a\nfriend just to chat hey I'm feeling kind\nof sad today can I talk to you so\ninstead of isolating that could in turn\nmake you perpetuate that and continue to\nbe sad and continue on to isolate and\ncontinue to feel sad and continue want\nto isolate you end up breaking that\ncycle and you do something different you\ndo the opposite of how you feel if\nyou're feeling very lazy today oh I\ndon't feel like doing very much today\nwhat's the opposite of that get moving\nif you don't feel motivated to go and do\nsomething start small find the little\nteeny tiniest task that's the first step\nto doing something if you feel negative\ntake a step back and practice some\ngratitude think about all the amazing\nthings that you've been blessed with in\nyour life if you feel judgmental towards\nsomeone if you're scrolling on Instagram\nand you're like oh my God this woman oh\nmy God this guy whatever it might be and\nyou're feeling really judgmental and you\nbecome aware oh my God I'm judging make\nyourself compliment that person out loud\nif you find someone that's in front of\nyou and you're judging them in person\nyou're in the grocery store and you're\njudging that person in your head walk up\nto that person and give them a\ncompliment repattern the way that you're\nfeeling and the way that you're acting\nif you're feeling anxious you got a lot\ngoing on and you feel a whole lot of\nanxiety inside of you slow down do some\ndeep breathing repattern yourself if\nyou're starting to feel a certain way\nand you want to eat a lot of junk food\nor you want to eat a lot of sugar eat\nsomething really greasy fast don't eat\nneed anything repattern that side of you\nif you're really pissed off and you're\ninfuriated because something happened\nsomebody cut you off on the way to work\nforce yourself to\nsmile there's proof that shows when you\nsmile it actually starts to train change\nthe chemicals in your brain feeling too\npessimistic find something positive\nforce yourself to find something\npositive if you feel like a little\nNegative Nancy and you're all up in your\nfeelings and your own everything sucks\nand the world sucks and my husband's\n and my kids are loud and I don't\nlike the way that I look and I don't\nlike the way I feel and you get yourself\nall negative and you're finding all of\nthe negative in the world sit down and\nwatch your comedy if you feel like\nyou're worthless go out and help\nsomebody\nelse the reason why this works is a\ncouple different reasons why number one\nthe first thing is endorphins right so\nwhen you take action your body is going\nto react in some sort of way depending\non what action that is right so for\ninstance if you feel like staying in bed\nbut you're like\nokay I feel like staying in bed you know\nwhat I'm going to go for a run instead\nI'm going to do the opposite of it your\nbody will naturally react to that your\nbody will naturally release endorphins\nwhich are feel-good chemicals and those\nendorphins make you feel better in the\nmoment but the interesting thing about\nit is it also makes your brain and body\nwant to do it again in the future and so\nnext time you find yourself feeling like\nstaying in bed you actually are going to\nbe more motivated to get out because\nyou've already had the endorphins and\nyour brain starting to go hey remember\nthat time we went for a run instead what\nif we did that again so the first thing\nis endorphins so the next reason why\nthis works is something that's called\ndopamine rewards I actually wrote an\nentire chapter about something that's\ncalled a dopamine reward system inside\nof my book I think it's chapter 12 level\nup if you want to get the book it's\ncalled level up but basically dopamine\nrewards is this when you don't feel good\nbut you do something regardless you will\nmake your brain release dopamine so\nlet's say for instance let's go back to\nlike being a Negative Nancy right and\nyou're a Negative Nancy oh my gosh I'm\nin my feelings and you decide that\nyou're going to watch a comedy instead\ndopamine is a Feelgood chemical and that\nfeel-good chemical is actually going to\nmake you feel better in the moment the\nother thing that it's also going to do\nbesides that is it it's actually the\nchemical of motivation and so you could\nsit there and feel like you're having a\nreally shitty day and be like Oh I'm in\nmy feelings and life sucks and blah blah\nblah and you watch a comedy and watching\na comedy makes you feel good and that\nFeel Good Makes You release dopamine\nthat dopamine makes you feel good in the\nmoment but it's also the chemical of\nmotivation when you feel that chemical\nof motivation it actually makes you more\nlikely to go out and take action so you\ncould literally go from being a a\nnegative little to watching a\ncomedy to actually getting up and taking\nout sh like you want to you breaking the\npattern that you no longer want to have\nand it makes you more likely to do\nsomething different\nand the interesting thing about dopamine\nis that we're basically when you look at\nwhen you look at all the books around\ndopamine and all the the neurologists\nand what they're saying is we're kind of\nall dopamine fiends like we all want\ndopamine and when we get dopamine we\nwant more dopamine and so we'll continue\nto do things like take more action to\nfeel more dopamine and so that's another\nchemical that's really important to\nunderstand when we break the patterns\nthat we have and then that turns into\nthe next thing which is neuroplasticity\nwhich is your brain's ability to change\nitself but it does not change itself if\nnothing changes either you deepen the\nold wiring that you have which is just\nthe pattern that we've been in we act\nhow we feel we act how we feel we act\nhow we feel or you change the wiring and\nover time the new patterning becomes\nstronger than the one that you had\nbefore and it doesn't the important\nthing to understand is it doesn't change\nfrom just doing it once it changes from\ndoing it over and over and over and over\nand over again and I will give you an\nanecdotal example I am the perfect\nexample of this I was such a negative\nlittle before I found you know\nself-development and wanting to get\nbetter and and improving myself and\nreading and and all that I could find\nthe bad in anything like anything you if\nyou had something positive to come and I\ncould find I could just cut that thing\ndown I was like that I was so bad like\nif you like you came to me you're like\nRob I just won the lottery I'd be like\nGH that's neat and stuff but you may\nmuch you're going to have to pay in\ntaxes taxes you know what the government\ndoes with taxes they spend it on war and\nthen they just quote un quote lose\nbillions of dollars like I goes just\nsuch a Negative little right like I\nand now for me it's really hard for me\nto find the negative in something and\nnaturally my new patterning and mind you\nI'm 18 years of working on myself my new\npatterning is basically like when\nsomething negative pops up quote unquote\nnegative or a challenge pops up it's way\neasier for me to immediately go to\nwhat's the Silver Lining what good can\ncome from this but the point of all this\nis to repattern yourself the things in\nyour life do not change unless you\nchange your feelings will not change\nunless you change your actions will not\nchange unless you change and so the\nimportant thing is to start identifying\nokay well when do I like how I feel and\nwhen do I not like how I feel or how do\nyou know what what patterning happens\nwhen I when I do this or I hang out with\nthis person I don't feel good or when I\nhave don't have good sleep or if I go to\nbed late I don't I wake up and I don't\nfeel good you start noticing first first\noff the the ways in your environment\nthat you don't feel good and then you\nstart asking yourself well how can I get\nrid of those things in my environment or\nshift my environment in some sort of way\nso that I don't even have to not feel\ngood then you start to ask yourself well\nwhen is it that I don't feel good do I\nfeel angry because of this thing or do I\nfeel um unmotivated or do I feel lazy or\nwhatever it might be but the first thing\nmore than anything else is awareness and\nto become very aware of yourself and the\nreason why you probably haven't changed\nthis with yourself is because you\nprobably number one you probably weren't\nuh you didn't know you could change it\nand number two you just weren't aware\nright you just weren't aware so the\nfirst thing is awareness how do I\nfeel and is this how I want to feel is\nthis how I want to feel like this this\nsadness this Melancholy this this\nisolation that I'm feeling whatever it\nis is this how I want to feel and if I\ndon't then I ask myself what is the\nopposite action that I can take to\nrepattern myself and so it's important\nfor you to identify right now when what\nis the feeling that you don't want to\nfeel and then what is the opposite\naction that you can take to repattern\nyourself because it's really important\nfor us to all understand you know the\nbeautiful thing the thing that I love\nmost about being a human is our ability\nto change ourself at any moment I have a\na my very first tattoo is a I only have\ntwo tattoos actually sorry it's my\nsecond tattoo I'm lying my second tattoo\nis right on my wrist and it's the Roman\nnumeral for the number 10,000 it's a a\nRoman numeral x with a line above it and\nbecause because it it goes back to the\n10,000 hour rule which is the ability to\nbe able to master anything I love that\nhumans have the ability to be able to\nmaster anything that they want to\nmaster that's an amazing part about\nbeing a human the only thing is that it\ntakes in order to master yourself it\ntakes about 10,000 hours of dedicated\npractice which shows you it requires\nhard work to work on yourself it\nrequires hard work for you to change\nyourself but but it means that you can\nalways change yourself at any moment\nit's a difference between a fixed\nmindset this is how I've always been and\nthis is how I'll always be versus a\ngrowth mindset which is I can be\nwhatever the I want to be right you\ndon't have to be who you've always been\nyou can change you can do whatever it is\nthat you want to change do whatever it\nis you want to do you could change\nwhatever is you want to change so how do\nyou want to change how do you want to\nfeel and then what actions would you\nneed to change in your life in order to\nfeel the way that you want to feel and\nso if you can identify those you can\nstart to pattern yourself change\nyourself and create yourself into\nwhoever you want to be so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please do me a huge\nfavor share it on your Instagram stories\nand tag me init Rob dial Jr r o d i a l\nJr and with Adam leave the same way I\nleave you every single episode make it\nyour mission to
