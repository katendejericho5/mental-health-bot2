    "video_title": "The Addiction of Overthinking",
    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to\novercome your addiction to overthinking\nlet's dive in when you actually start to\nthink about uh overthinking in in the\nprocess of it really what it comes down\nto is why do we overthink and so let's\ngo back real quick I want to actually\ntalk about something that's a really\ngood book that I love it's a book called\nThe Power of Now and what he talks about\nis kind of in his spiritual awakening he\ngot to a moment where he was kind of\nconsidering suicide and um the he he\nthought to himself this this this\nsentence that kind of freed him from I\nguess it started a spiritual journey and\nthe fre the the sentence that freed him\nwas I can no longer live with myself and\nso he thought to himself that he was\nthinking about suicide and he thought to\nhimself I can no longer live with myself\nand that sentence kind of took him out\nof him out of his own head and was able\nto look at it from a different\nperspective and he thought if I cannot\nlive with my\nmyself then there must be kind of like\ntwo of me in here there's the\nI and there's the self that I cannot\nlive with only one of them is real and\nso there's the I which is your true self\nwho you truly are and then there's the\nself which is your conditioned self who\nyou've built yourself into being over\nyears who you were taught to be who\nSociety taught you to be who your\nparents taught you to be what is right\nwhat is wrong what your religion taught\nyou to be and the interesting thing\nabout the I is there's nothing that you\ncan do or not do that can add or\nsubtract from who you actually\nare if I asked you who are you you would\nstart to list all of the things that you\nthink that you are oh I'm a mother I'm\n43 years old I'm an HR Specialists my\nname is Sally but none of those are who\nyou are behind all of it because when\nyou were born you weren't a mother when\nyou were born you weren't 33 years old\nwhen you were born your name wasn't\nSally that's what someone said that your\nname was when you were born born you\nweren't an HR specialist and so the I is\nthe true self that's behind all of it\nand the self is a false construct of the\nmind your thoughts are not\nyou you are not your mind now this can\nreally be a shot at your ego but so many\nof us are so stuck in our heads and we\noverthink so much that we think there's\nsomething wrong with\nus but you have to be able to\ndisidentify yourself from your mind your\nmind is like a tool that's the way that\nyou want to think about it just like a\nhammer when you need to hammer in a nail\nyou're going to go find a hammer but if\nI give you a screw there's a better tool\nfor that it's a\nscrewdriver but if you think about this\nyou know it's like me saying another\nexample of you are not your mind it's\nkind of like me saying you are not your\nbig toe it's just a part of\nyou so why don't you learn to start\nobserving\nyourself and observing your\nthoughts asking yourself if you actually\nare those thoughts and then\ndisidentifying yourself from those\nthoughts in anything that you don't want\nto be because all of your thoughts\ncreate your reality so start observing\nyour thoughts start observing and\nchanging your thoughts so that you can\nchange your reality what it comes down\nto is that overthinking is an addiction\nwhat is an addiction it's something that\nyou can no longer control it's something\nthat controls you and so you know\nexample I always give people and if\nyou're not able to watch me on YouTube\num you can't see me but I'm taking my\nright arm and my right arm is flailing\nall over the place and it's moving all\nover and what if I went out and my I was\ntalking with somebody and my right arm\nwas going all crazy and they're looking\nat me and they're like what's going on\nwith your arm I'm like Oh my arm's just\ngoing crazy I have no control over it\nthat would be kind of crazy right\nbecause my arm you know besides the fact\nof me having some sort of neurological\ndisease or or issue there my arm should\nbe able to be controlled\nby myself because it is a part of\nme and so it's the exact same thing with\nyour mind your mind might be like your\narm flailing all over the place where\nyou've been letting it run all over the\nplace but it doesn't mean that you can't\nstart to control it you can't start to\nwork through it so if it is overthinking\ntoo much it's something that you can\nwork with it's not something that has to\nbe that way forever and in fact if you\nactually I always say this like\noverthinking is only a problem when\nyou're overthinking about all of the\nnegative things in your life and all the\nthings you don't want but if you were\nsitting around waking up and you were\nlike I was like man what's your problem\nand you're like oh I'm overthinking all\nof the beautiful things in my life that\nwould never\nhappen so what you need to start doing\nis realizing there is you there is your\ntrue self there is the I that is there\nand then there is the there is the ey\nthat is behind it and then there's the\nself the one that you have built you\ncould also say another way of saying I\nis your true self your this is where it\ngets you know the the words kind of get\ninto it right there's the I which is the\ntrue self and then there's the self\nwhich is the uh conditioned self who\nyou've been built yourself into being\nand so when you have the eye sitting in\nthe background and sitting there you can\nstart to watch The Thinker the voice\nthat you hear inside of your head we all\nhave a a voice that's always going on\ninside of your head and if you're\nsitting there going I don't have a voice\nthat's going on inside of my head that's\nthe voice that I'm speaking of we all\nhave a voice that's always constantly\ngoing it's narrating Our Lives it's\ntelling us stories and we all have the\nability to stop that voice when we\nbecome more aware of it and to start to\nobserve it you don't have to identify\nwith it this is why why meditation can\nbe so hard for so many people is because\nwe sit down to meditate and our brain\njust doesn't stop and we think that the\nproblem is that I can't turn my brain\noff and I can't stop thinking but that's\nnot how you're supposed to meditate when\nyou talk with monks and you talk with\npeople who are over in India and gurus\nthey say that the point of meditation is\nnot to stop thinking or stop the mind\nthe point of meditation is to observe\nyour thoughts to take a step back to\nbecome the eye and to look at what the\nself the conditioned self is thinking\nand saying at all points in\ntime and maybe there's too much worry in\neverything if you worry about the future\nit's based on your past and it's based\nin your conditioned mind the result is\nyou are viewing the future Through The\nEyes of your past and it distorts your\nview a little bit you mind can be your\nown wor enemy but it can also be your\nbest friend and so let me let me show\nyou something if you're if test this\nwith me okay if you're driving please\ndon't do this because you're going to\nhave to close your eyes but if you're\nyou know at home and you're putting on\nyour makeup and you're listening to me\nor you're in the shower or you're making\nfood or whatever you might be doing if\nyou're in a safe place do this for me\njust close your eyes and I want you to\nsee a red\ntriangle and once you see that red\ntriangle right in front of you and and\nonce you see it it can be try to make it\nas as clear as you can it might be a\nlittle bit clear it might be very foggy\nbut just try to see a red\ntriangle and then what I want you to do\nis I want you to change it to a blue\nsquare can you see a blue square in\nfront of\nyou so see the blue square try to see\nthe edges try to see whatever is that\nmight be right in front of you just\npretend it's right\nthere and then open your\neyes The Observer of the red triangle\nand the blue square is the same Observer\nof your thoughts all day\nlong you can look at the red triangle\nyou can create the red triangle and you\ncan let them come and\ngo you can decide to change it from a\nred triangle to a blue square the same\nthing you can also do with your\nthoughts so the same way that you're not\nthe red triangle you're also not your\nthoughts but you can go you know what I\ndon't want to look at a red triangle\nanymore I want to look at a blue square\nand you can start to change it the same\nway that you could say I don't want to\nbe negative inside of my head anymore I\nwant to be more positive I don't want to\ntalk down to myself I want to give\nmyself more self-love it is that easy to\nchange it just requires you to be more\nintentional of observing your thoughts\nas much as you possibly can you must\nthink consciously consciously think and\nconsciously view your thoughts like\nthat's what you have to start\nconsciously thinking and constantly\nviewing your thoughts because most of\nthe time it's all unconscious\nthoughts and when you actually start to\nthink about it you say you know what I\ncan probably change it my\nunconsciousness my unconscious thoughts\nI'm going to try to make them conscious\nlike let give you an example right right\nnow you are unconsciously\nbreathing but now that I'm saying it I'm\ngoing to say consciously\nbreathe I can change from un conscious\nto conscious the same way that I am\nunconsciously thinking throughout the\nday and now I can consciously start to\nthink when I say that you can as well\nyou can free yourself from your\nmind you can be there you can observe it\nyou can change your thoughts that you do\nnot want but don't judge don't judge\nyour thoughts don't guilt yourself don't\nshame\nyourself but just disidentify with them\nyou're not them if you quote unquote\noverthink no big deal your brain will\nnot stop thinking that's not something\nthat you're going to be able to do\nyou're you don't want your heart to stop\nright you don't want your lungs to stop\nbreathing why because both of those your\nheart is made to beat you don't want it\nto stop your thoughts I'm sorry your\nyour your lungs are made to breathe\nthat's what it's made to do your brain\nis made to think so when you watch or\nlisten to your thoughts you become aware\nof your thoughts just as you become\naware of what's going just as just as\nthe The Thinker that comes in and just\nthe you just watch watch The Thinker a\nlittle bit start to watch and be\ninterested why do I think that way why\ndo I say that to myself where did that\ncome from and just start to become very\ncurious of\nyourself and then start to realize that\nGod keep saying it over and over and\nover again that you are because I'm\ntrying to really brainwash into your\nbrain you are not your thoughts you're\nnot and when you realize that you're not\nyour thoughts your thoughts will lose\npower over\nyou so how do you start to get more\ncontrol over your mind well when you do\nsome mundane task I want you to bring\nyour mind to that present moment moment\nand focus on it so let's say that you\nare washing your hands that's just some\nreally mundane task we all wash our\nhands hopefully you wash your\nhands I going to some men's bathrooms\nand men go pee and then they just walk\nthe hell out I'm like that's gross dude\nI'm not shaking that guy's hand ever\nright so hopefully you're out there and\nyou're washing your damn hands and when\nyou wash your hands and you're doing\nsomething really mundane just try to\nbring your conscious awareness to it\ninstead of thinking about something else\nthat's off in the distance because our\nmind always tries to go somewhere else\nbring your mind here try to train it to\nbe more present so you've got what do\nyou got you got the sound of the water\nbring your mind here can you hear the\nwater as you're washing your hands what\nelse do you have you have the smell of\nthe soap can you try to smell the soap\nyou got the warmth of the\nwater all of those things are in the\npresent moment when you bring your\nsenses into paying attention to\nsomething you're doing you're bringing\nyour mind to the present moment and not\nallowing your mind to run all over the\nplace right when\nyou're creating food and you're sitting\nin your in your your kitchen you're\nstarting to create different recipes put\nthem together notice the smell don't\nthink about what you have to do next\njust notice the smell notice the heat\ncoming from the oven notice the sounds\nthat you hear start to bring yourself\nmore consciously here when you go and\nyou're done cooking the food you're\neating the food notice what you feel and\ntry to bring your mind to to be here\nwhen you're doing those things notice\nwhen you're sitting down in your chair\nwhat it feels like notice that the fork\nin your hand notice the the taste in\nyour\nmouth it's essentially Living Through\nThe Eyes of a three-year-old the place\nthat we all want to get back to that\nbeautiful innocent right it's just like\nyou're so innocent at that point that\ninnocence is what we're trying to get\nback to which is youve see a\nthree-year-old they're like oh like\nthey're looking everywhere everything's\namazing they're just like they're here\nthat's what we're trying trying to get\nback to and so what I want you to do is\nI want you to disidentify with your mind\nyour sense of self should not come from\nyour\nmind it shouldn't because it's not who\nyou are you're none of those things you\nwere you were here and you were a person\nway before you were given a name way\nbefore you had a job way before you had\nkids way before you had accomplishments\nway before you had anything else that's\nwhat we're trying to get back to and I\nunderstand it could be a shot at your\nego it can kind of wake people up\nthey're like this it's kind of clicking\nbut it's not fully clicking I get it you\nmight have to listen this again but but\nit's it's a shot at the ego because the\nego is a false sense of your mind it's a\nfalse construct of the mind and your ego\nis based off of your past and it's hard\nto let go of because then we start to\nthink about well who am I then because\nwe want to know who we are wants to have\nsomething to identify with so it's hard\nto let go because your ego is really\nlike well I am this person I do love\nplaying pickleball I do like driving my\ncar I am a HR\nspecialist do you need extra thoughts\nlike do you need extra proof that you're\nnot your thoughts and your thoughts are\nnot you if you stopped thinking would\nyou still be\nalive would you if you stopped thinking\nwould you still be alive yeah of course\nso therefore thoughts are not\nsomething that thoughts are just\nsomething let me put it a better way\ntherefore thoughts are just something\nthat your body does the same way that\nwhen you eat food it digests it the same\nway that when you smell something that\nyou like you you your mouth starts to\nsalivate it is just something that your\nbody does the problem is that we develop\nthese these narratives of this is who I\nam and so if you're really uh if you\nhave talked to yourself in your own\nhead then that that's what's going on in\nyour head the same way that you know\nyou're breathing it's just something\nthat's going on in your head but then\nwhat happens is we develop a story\naround what's going on in our head and\nthen we start to say well I'm just\nreally mean to myself and then when we\nbecause so something's happening it's\nsomething's happening inside of our head\nwe develop a story this where gets real\ncrazy we develop a story around what's\nhappening and then we make that our\nidentity when in reality it's just\nsomething that we're doing yeah you're\ntalking a little bit negative to\nyourself now you're saying you're\ncreating a story and a narrative around\nit I am mean to myself now after you've\ndone that and you do it long enough you\nstart to create an identity around that\nand a personality around it around being\nmean to yourself so the thing I want you\nto do is to extract yourself from it and\nrealize that is not you that's just just\nsomething that your body does same way\nthat you're breathing it's just\nsomething that your body does you are\nnot your\nthoughts you're not and so what I want\neveryone to kind of do is is to start to\ndisidentify yourself with your mind if\nyou're driving and you turn this off and\nyou just start to sit in some silence\nand you\nnotice that you're starting to worry on\nyour way to work that's not you that's\njust something that you've been\nconditioned to do you've you've done so\nmuch worrying over the course of your\nlife it's just easy for you to slip back\ninto woring that's not you that's not\nwho you are no big\ndeal let the Mind do that or you could\ndo the same thing as a red triangle and\nthe the blue square hey I don't want to\nworry anymore I'd rather enjoy my ride\nlet me just think about what I'm\ngrateful for right now what makes me\nhappy what's what can I be grateful for\nyou know what I'm grateful for I'm\ngrateful for my kids I'm grateful that I\nhave this car that I'm driving in\nthere's few people out side of the road\nI see right now they're they're sitting\nat a bus stop at least I have a car and\nwe can just decide in the moment to\nchange the thoughts and if we can decide\nto change the thoughts that means that\nit's not us the same way that if I don't\nlike that I'm wearing a blue shirt I can\ngo ahead and turn into a white shirt I'm\nnot the blue shirt I'm not the white\nshirt it's just a choice and so you can\nchoose to change your thoughts you can\nchoose to change your breath you can\nchoose to change all of that and so\nreally what it comes down to is\ndisidentify yourself with your\nmind overthinking Is Not a Bad Thing CU\nyou cannot overthink you're thinking at\nthe exact same Pace as everybody else is\njust your problem is you're thinking\nabout things that you don't want to\nthink about anymore so dis disidentify\nyourself from your mind start to ask\nyourself what thought what I would what\nthat's what I prefer and then once\nyou've become very aware of something\nthe next thing after awareness is\npractice start putting into practice oh\nI noticed myself uh thinking negatively\nwhat did I say I was going to do I was\ngoing to bring myself to uh remind\nmyself of three things that I'm grateful\nfor and then start thinking positive and\nthat's the practice when I notice my\nawareness oh it's clicking in again\nbecause we're going to get lost all the\ntime oops clicking in again what am I\ngoing to do I'm going to go back to\nthree things I'm grateful for and then\nbe positive oh it's clicking in again\nI'm being negative what am I going to do\nagain oh I'm going to think about three\nthings I'm grateful for and then I'm\ngoing to go back and being positive and\nthis is what it comes down to if you do\nit enough over and over and over and\nover and over again you actually start\nto repattern parts of the brain I used\nto be really pessimistic when I was\nyounger I could give you every excuse in\nthe book and I could tell you every\nreason why something wasn't going to\nhappen the way that we want it to and I\nwas real negative and then I just\nstarted repatterning it over and over\nand over again and now\nbut being honest with you like it's just\nkind of hard for me to be negative it's\neasy for me to just go the positive\nroute but it's just a repatterning of\nthe way that we think and what does that\ntake it takes a lot of work it takes a\nlot of time it takes a lot of intention\nand attention but it's something that we\ncan all do so if you're addicted to\noverthinking of course we all are quote\nunquote addicted to thinking because\nit's something that we do all the time\nbut all of you have to really under\nunderstand is that you're not your mind\nyou're not your thoughts change your\nthoughts and you'll change your life as\nwell so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your Instagram\nstories tab me and at Rob dial Jr r obdi\na l Jr and with that I'm going leave you\nthe same way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomeone else's day better I
