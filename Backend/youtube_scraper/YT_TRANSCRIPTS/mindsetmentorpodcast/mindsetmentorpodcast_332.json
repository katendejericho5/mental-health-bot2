    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the benefits\nof having mentors and coaches in your\nlife and also how to find them to help\nyou progress to get to where you want to\ngo let's dive in I read a stat uh years\nago probably about 10 years ago at this\npoint that said the average millionaire\nsomebody who has a million dollars in\nnet worth has had no less on average\nthan seven mentors before they become a\nmillionaire and so when you start to\nthink about a mentor first off let's\ntalk about what a mentor is what is a\nMentor cuz you can go out there and you\ncan pay for a mentor or you know I can\nalso see coach like a coach is a mentor\nin some way um so you can go out there\nand you could pay for one you could find\none that's a friend and they could be\nfree and all of that but really what is\na mentor the way I look at it is\nsomebody who is a mentor is somebody who\nhas applied knowledge in something that\nyou want to get better at so you know\neven if we just say like I want to get\nbetter at running a business well I can\nhave a business Mentor who is successful\nmore successful than I have maybe\nthey've exited a couple companies which\nmeans that they have knowledge\nspecifically around the thing that I\nwant to get better at which is business\nwhat also could help with mentors maybe\nI um maybe I hire a fitness Mentor\nFitness coach somebody who who is really\nin shape and is in better shape than I\nam they have applied knowledge towards\nthat specific thing and I'm willing to\nbe able to work with that person or pay\nthat person or work for them for free or\nwhatever it might be in order to get\nsome of that knowledge for them now why\nis it important to have a mentor well\nbasically what's happened is they've\ngone down the road of seeing what works\nseeing what does and going through trial\nand error over years they might have had\ntheir own mentors they might have just\nscrewed it all up themselves and\neventually figured it out but eventually\nwhat happened is they got to where you\nwant to go and they can basically hand\nyou the road map not physically but they\ncan hand you the road map and say this\nis what you need to do to get to where I\nam essentially what they do is they\ncollapse time they shorten your learning\ncurve in I don't know if you're on the\nsame page as me but I am more than\nwilling to pay somebody to teach me the\nthing that I want to get better at\nwhether that's business whether that's\ncoaching whether that is learning how to\nplay guitar how to sing better uh a\nfitness coach a nutritionist coach um\nsomebody who's going to help my wife and\nI get better and closer in our\nrelationship so these are people who\nknow something and I'm willing to either\npay them or spend time with them or work\nfor them or there might be some sort of\nexchange where I am learning what they\nknow and the way I like to think about\nis this is uh we had uh my VP of\noperations over in her fiance uh were\nover this weekend and we were talking\nabout how her fiance Julian loves\ngrocery shopping and I'm like that's\nfunny I hate grocery shopping I try to\nget in and out as fast as possible and\nbasically this is the example that I\ngave them is when I walk into a store I\nknow I need like this thing this thing\nand this thing and so I will walk up to\nthe very first person who works in that\ngrocery store and I will say hey I need\neggs I need bread I need steak where are\nthose things okay eggs are over there\nsteak's over there Bread's over there\ncool can you take me there if they are\nable to I'll ask them to take me there A\nlot of times they these just offer to\ntake me there that is exactly what\nhaving a mentor does for you is you can\ngo up to him and say hey this is what I\nwant how do I get there and not spend\ntime years going up and down the aisles\nlooking and searching for the thing that\nyou're trying to get out of life all of\nthat takes time and so it's like you\nknow and the thing about it too is like\nif I walk up to somebody I'm like hey I\nneed peanut butter where's the peanut\nbutter he's like the peanut butter is on\nuh aisle four and I go on aisle four I\ncan look left and right and I still\nmight not find the peanut butter I'm\nlike a let me turn around I missed it\nright we do that too that's what life is\nand so really the the the important\nthing going up and asking somebody\nexactly they know they know where it is\nwhy because they have been there they\nknow where it is they can save you time\nyou don't have to search you don't have\nto mess up you don't have to walk down\nthe wrong aisle they collapse time I\ndon't know about you guys I'll just be\nhonest with you I got to do I got\nthings to do I got people to see I got a\nlife to create I want to get there\nsooner than later and for somebody who\nis very frugal I am willing more than\nwilling to pay somebody to teach me how\nto do the thing I want to improve at and\nthis is what a mentor does so whatever\nit is if you say if I ask you what do\nyou want to get better at you're like I\nwant to get better at this thing I\nguarantee you there is someone in the\nworld who has already gotten to where\nyou want to go with that thing and I\nguarantee you whether they're just a\nreally nice person they want to teach\nyou for free or you can work for them\nfor free in some sort of way or there's\nsome sort of value exchange or bartering\nsystem or you just say hey\nwhat would it cost for me to pay you to\nhelp me like to help me with this\nwhatever it might be it's just a quicker\nway of getting to where you want to go\nthat's really what it comes down to like\nan example if if you're in California\nlet's say you're in LA and you want to\ngo to Hawaii you can take a boat to get\nthere or you could take a jet to get\nthere or you could take a kayak to get\nthere one could take months one could\ntake hours a mentor is the equivalent of\na jet for traveling they get you to\nwhere you want to go quicker is it more\nexpensive to take a boat than it is I'm\nsorry is it more expensive to take a jet\nthan it is to take a kayak yeah but you\nsave time and time is money and so\nmentors collapse time a mentor is\nsomeone who's done something that you\nalready do a business the relationship\nmoney mindset body whatever it is and\nthe reason why I fully believe in\ncoaches and mentors is because I hired\nmy first Mentor when I was 19 years old\nI paid somebody $500 a month and he\nabsolutely changed my life I was 19\nyears old this was in 2006 I've looked\nit up that's like the equivalent of $750\nright now a month at 19 I didn't have\nthe money but what did I have I I had a\ncredit card and I I had a credit card\nand I had a desire to have a different\nlife that's what I did have and he\nabsolutely changed my life I don't know\nwhere I would be had I not hired him\noriginally what happened was I had\nstarted in a sales company and I knew\nnothing about sales I was terrible at\nsales and I wasn't making money that I\nwanted to and I said this guy is in the\nhall Fame in this company that I'm in I\nwonder if I can pay him to teach me what\nhe knows so I'm brand new sales rep\nlearning from someone who's in the Hall\nof Fame did he teach me sales yeah but\nmore than anything else he taught me\nabout life he taught me about psychology\nbecause sales of psychology he helped me\nwith setting goals he helped me with\nstop making excuses he completely\nchanged everything of who I was and he\nwas successful in the business that I\nwas in so my question to you is is why\ndon't you just try to learn from the\nbest why don't you try to go up to\nsomebody who is where you want to be and\nsay hey what can I do to learn from you\nyou've got something in your brain how\ndo I download it it's kind of like in\nThe Matrix where they upload you know\ntake all the information upload into to\nNeo's brain that's what we're trying to\ndo how can I how can I download all the\ninformation from your brain how can I\nupload it into my brain and by hiring\nthis guy he changed my mindset he\nchanged my bank account he changed my\nrelationships uh he changed my\nrelationship with personal development\nabsolutely changed my life in many ways\nand so what I try to do is I try to have\nmentors in as many areas of my life as\npossible at this point right now I have\nabout nine different mentors for\ndifferent things and I'm willing to pay\nfor it now I understand I wasn't always\nwilling to pay for it so there were\ntimes where I had to say Hey you know\nmaybe I can do this thing for you I've\nhad mentors before where you know i' I I\nI can specifically remember one who\nhelped me when I was brand new in in\nlearning marketing\nand he was really really good at\nmarketing I knew nothing about marketing\nand how to start making products and\nselling them\nonline but the beautiful thing was I had\njust started a podcast and it was\ngrowing this back in 2015 and I had\nabout a 100 episodes under my belt I was\nlike six months in at that point in time\nand he was thinking about starting a\npodcast and we were in a conversation we\nmet at another person's house and I knew\nyou know we had talked and I knew he was\na super successful guy killing it in\nmarketing and you know I was like you\nknow we were talking and he was like\nyeah I'm thinking about starting a\npodcast and I was like Hey man' like\nwhen we're leaving I was like let me get\nyour number maybe we could talk about\nstarting a podcast and see if I can help\nyou out he's like oh man that would be\nawesome and then so what I did I didn't\nhave money to pay him I didn't I was\nbroke at the time I actually at that\npoint in time literally was jobless and\ntrying to start my business so there's\nno Revenue coming in so I sent him a\ntext message a couple days later hey man\nso great to meet you over at this\nperson's house um you know when do you\nwant to jam out and and I can try to\nhelp you with growing your your podcast\nhe's like oh man that'd be awesome can\nyou come over and talk with me and my\ngirlfriend um because they were starting\nthe podcast together can you come over\nand see us on on Thursday went over on\nThursday I was over their house for like\nseven hours right didn't ask for\nanything from him and what's cool about\nit is that the law of reciprocity and\nthis isn't the reason why I was doing\nbut the law of verity he was like how\ncan I help you and I was like man well I\ndon't really know about this this is\nwhat I'm kind of thinking about doing\nand so I helped him start his podcast\nand he helped me start with marketing\nand now he's a really good friend of\nmine like we've known each other now for\neight almost N9 years at this point I\nguess and it just kind of gives you an\nidea of I didn't have the money to pay\nhim so if you're sitting out there like\nI don't know how I'm going to pay people\nto do this is there some sort of\nenergetic exchange sometimes not all the\ntime but sometimes you can find someone\nthat is very successful with what you\nwant to get better at and them just\nseeing your desire to want to learn to\ngrow to improve will make them be like I\nwant to help this person I can see it in\ntheir eyes I I can notice myself in them\nlet me try to help them out sometimes\nthat can happen but what I always say\nand this is the thing that people make\nmake a massive mistake of every single\ntime is you need to offer to help them\nfirst is what I think is really\nimportant the amount of times like it\ndrives me crazy the amount of times I\nget emails from people they're just like\nRob love your podcast how can I get on\nit and I'm like there's no value\nExchange in that that's that's that is\ntaking is what it is hey I've got\nsomething I want to promote I want to\npromote my book or whatever it is how\ncan I get on your podcast not how can I\nhelp you in any sort of way and so I\nwould just say if you want people to be\nmore receptive of it try to see if you\ncan help them in some sort of way put\nyourself out there if you don't have if\nyou don't have money try to see if you\ncan have some time try to see if there's\nsomething some knowledge you can help\nthem with right so for me like what I do\nis I teach people how to grow businesses\nwhy because I've already done it and\nI've messed up all the stuff I've found\nout what works and what doesn't work and\nso someone could spend five years trying\nto figure it out or they could just\nlearn from someone like me who runs a\nyou know $5 million year business and\njust get to thean a butter quicker right\nthat's kind of what it is now people\nalways ask me a question like what's the\ndifference between having a paid mentor\nand what's the difference between having\na free Mentor I think that both of them\nare great I have had many of both but I\ncan give you a little bit of an idea of\nwhat the difference is between the two\nokay free mentors are great because\nthey're free they don't cost you\nanything I have many friends in my life\nwho are incredible mentors people who\nare extremely successful um but you know\nthere's massive benefit to it but\nthere's a there's quite a few downsides\nto it as well so like I have friends\nthat are 10 15 years older than me and\nextremely successful in real estate\nwhich is something that I'm trying to\nget better at and I'm you know I've have\nmy own properties and stuff so I'm\ntrying to get better at that and trying\nto learn from\nthem I don't pay them you know we we\nhelp each other out we hang out you know\nwe can be around each other um they they\nmake me hold myself to a higher level\nbut because of the fact that I'm not\npaying them I don't see them every\nsingle week I don't see them all of the\ntime and they don't really feel\nobligated to help me succeed they want\nto see me succeed they will they will\ntake time out we'll go get coffee we'll\ntalk we'll chitchat all of that stuff\nbut you know I might not talk to him for\ntwo months three months six months\nsometimes and so that's a good example\nof that that's what a free Mentor would\nbe is I'm like yeah he's my friend we're\ngood friends I could call him and say\nhey let's go get coffee and we can chat\nand I'll I'll definitely learn some\nstuff from him he'll probably learn some\nstuff from me but we're not talking to\nthere's no consistent Cadence of us\ntalking all the time\nso that's kind of like what a free\nMentor is a paid Mentor is really great\nas well um I just honestly prefer paid\nmentors because if somebody is is is you\nknow worth it as a coach they should\nfeel if they're a good person that they\nare obligated to help you succeed\nthere's an energetic exchange I'm paying\nyou money you have agreed to help me\nsucceed in this one thing so in many\nways I think that it's better uh another\nthing that that really helps as well is\nis that usually you're going to talk\nevery single week uh a good Mentor coach\nwhatever it might be that you have you\nshould be saying seeing each other on a\nvery regular Cadence what's good about\nthat is that you're seeing each other\nquite often and with that they should be\nholding you accountable too you know\nyour success in many ways is their\nobligation and so they should feel\nresponsible for your success and they\nshould have the opportunity to call you\nout when you don't do what you're going\nto you say you're going to do a lot of\ntimes what's really interesting about\npeople is We Will We Will um to succeed\nor want to do what needs to be done\nsimply because other people are watching\nus or because we know that our mentors\nor our coach you're going to be checking\non like oh my God I said I was going to\ndo this thing I better get it done\notherwise I look like an idiot so what\nit really comes down to and I think that\nthat's super important is like first off\nwhat do you want like what do you want\nin your life I think that's the thing\nthat a lot of people really need to get\nclear on is you might be listening to me\nand you're like that's cool like what do\nI get a mentor for well it depends on\nwhat it is that you want like what do\nyou want in your life do you want to get\nbetter at running a business is there a\nspecific Niche that you're in or Niche\ndepending on how you speak that you're\nin that you want to to get better at is\nthere somebody in the world who teaches\nthat who has the level of success that\nyou want that you can just pay to help\nyou get there there's massive Roi in\nthat is there somebody who's in a great\nrelationship or they're a relationship\ncoach or they are a um relationship\ntherapist they can help you with that\nthat's someone that that you can go find\nis there somebody who is a you know\nthere's a sport you want to get better\nat there's someone that's really good in\nyour area can you pay them and say hey\ncan I take lessons from you can you take\nlessons can you do sessions all of that\nso I think the first thing is like get\nreally clear on what it is that you want\nto improve at like if you were to say\nthis is the number one thing over the\nnext six months that I want to improve\nat what is that\nthing get really clear on what that\nthing is and then say is there somebody\nelse in my area that that teaches this\nis there someone that I'm aware of or is\nthere someone that's in my area and so\nthat's a really important thing to start\nto think about you can go on to Google\nand you can Google it you can go on to\nyou know if it's something even is like\nyou're like I want to get better at\ntennis there's an app that that I've\nused many times called thumb Tac and it\nused to just be made for people who were\nlike trying to find plumbers and trying\nto find air conditioning people and all\nthat stuff now you can type in like\ntennis lessons and it'll pop up and you\ncan see if there's someone there maybe\nif you want to get better at a language\nSpanish lessons you could type in\nSpanish and somebody will come to your\nhouse and teach you Spanish or do it\nvirtually and so really what it comes\ndown to is what do you want and then\nyou've got to search and try to find\nthat and then if you're asking for like\nwhat where would you find a free Mentor\nyou've got to ask yourself where would\nthat Mentor hang out put yourself in the\nlocation where they might be like for\ninstance if you're uh if and the way I\nwas like to think about this is is kind\nof like dating right if you were single\nand you're really into being extremely\nhealthy you're very healthc conscious\nand you're single and you're trying to\nfind somebody else who is also the same\nas you who's very healthc conscious\nyou're probably not going to try to go\nfind that person at the bar if you're\nnot somebody who really drinks because\nyou're going to find somebody at the bar\nwho drinks where would you go if you\nwanted to find somebody to to date that\nwas very health conscious like you you\nmight go to Whole Foods you might go to\nyoga classes you might go to um the gym\nyou might go to group fitness classes\nand you're going to put yourself in the\narea where that potential partner could\nbe it's the exact same thing for mentors\nit might take you some time but like\nwhere would my mentor hang out that\nteaches me how to do this thing and\nyou've got to put yourself in those\nplaces to start to find those people so\nthat is the importance of having a\nmentor I can't stress enough how worth\nit is to have free mentors paid mentors\nbecause ultimately they will collapse\ntime and help you get to success in\nwhatever it is that you want to be\nsuccessful in much much quicker so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories tag\nme in at Rob dial Junior r o d i a l Jr\nand with that I'm going to leave you the\nsame way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomebody else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
