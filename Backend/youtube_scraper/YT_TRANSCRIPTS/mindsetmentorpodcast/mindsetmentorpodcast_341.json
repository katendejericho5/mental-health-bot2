    "transcript": "lot of people ask how do I get confident\nright how do I build confidence in\nmyself and they think I have to go do\nsomething and I have to succeed that's\nnot necessarily the truth sometimes I\nthink a lot of our confidence comes from\nfeeling fear doing it anyways maybe not\nhaving the results that we actually\nwanted to but in turn looked at it and\nsaid I'm really proud that I showed up\nfor myself yes and that builds\nconfidence in you huge time when you\nshow up for you that's big the fear\nfailure is really thinking about my\nfuture self and saying would my future\nself be proud that I didn't take the\nshot or more proud that I actually did\ntake the shot I failed I learned\nsomething from it and it led to\nsomething even better after that failure\nor that loss"
