    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today I'm\ngoing to talk to you about two simple\ntricks and mindset shifts to improve all\nof your relationships let's dive in so\nthe first one which is um not easy\nactually neither one of these are easy\nbut this one's not easy but it's just\nsomething to continue to keep reminding\nyourself is that everyone's doing their\nbest everyone is doing their best at\nevery moment cuz if they could do better\nthey would do better which also means\nthat every person who's ever screwed you\nover and how your parents didn't give\nyou what you wanted to or whatever it\nmight be they didn't give you the love\nor the the the time or the attention or\nwhatever it might be every person that\nis currently in front of you that you'll\never meet is doing the best they\npossibly can but also everything every\nperson that's ever done quote unquote\nsomething to\nyou they were trying their best they\nwere doing their best it can be hard\nbecause if we're being real people can\nbe really damn difficult can't they they\ncan be and and it's really important to\nrealize that is them doing the best that\nthey can based off of everything that\nthey know everything they've been taught\nin everything that they've learned in\ntheir entire lives if they could be\ndoing better they would be doing better\nand so it's important to remember that\nevery single person has their own set of\nunique experiences emotions\ncircumstances history that greatly\ninfluences their behavior and their\nactions and the thing that I\nknow is being in the industry that I've\nbeen in for as long as I've been in I\nhave heard I me you could see somebody\nwho seems normal they they seem like\neverything's okay but then they tell you\nall of the stuff that's happening in\ntheir life right now and you're like oh\nmy God you poor thing or they tell you\nabout what happened in their childhood\nyou're like oh my God you poor thing you\nhave to understand that everyone is\ndoing the best that they possibly can at\nevery single moment if you knew all of\nthe stuff that that person's been\nthrough in their life it would probably\nbe easy easier to have compassion the\nproblem is we only see the adult man\nthat's an right in front of us\nand we don't see you know the the the\nsix-year-old little boy who was verbally\nassaulted by his father every single day\nwe're only seeing the adult we're not\nseeing that little wounded child inside\nof him that's still there that didn't\nheal yet and if we did and we did see\nthat little six-year-old child and what\nhe had to go through every single day of\nhis life it would be easier for us to\nhave compassion and one of the things\nI'm always reminding myself of as I'm\ncontinuing to work with people and\ncontinuing to to be just out in life is\nthat all adults that you come in contact\nwith are just wounded children in adult\nbodies it's the truth because most\npeople are not healed some people are\ntrying to heal themselves some people\nare unaware that they can even heal\nthemselves in the first place all adults\n99.99999% I'll say are just wounded\nchildren and adult bodies and they don't\nknow that those wounds are still making\nthem who they currently are and they're\nstill hurting them because they haven't\nhealed them there's many factors they\ncan impact a person's Behavior they can\nimpact a person's actions you know it's\nit's happened uh if you think about the\nall of the stuff that's happened in the\npast few\nyears it's insane some people have been\nthrough some right they've had\npeople they've they've had sicknesses\nthey've had people that have been close\nto them die some people have lost their\njobs they've lost everything\na lot has happened in the past few years\nand me mental health issues are just\nskyrocketing and so somebody might be\nstruggling in their life and you have no\nidea because they don't present that\nthey might be struggling financially\nemotionally uh they might be struggling\nin a relationship or their marriage they\nmight have had you might have a sick\nchild all of this but you have no idea\nwhat's going on in their life like I\nremember I had a mentor one time was\ntalking about how a lady had cut cut him\noff remember I was like 19 20 years old\nwhen he told me this he was like he was\na lady cut him off very like he scarily\ncut him off and he got really pissed off\nlike Furious right like this lady's\n crazy she almost killed me and\nthen he pulls up to the stoplight to\nlike give it to her right and he pulls\nup to the stoplight and the lady's next\nto him in her car crying and he thought\nto himself oh my God I don't know what\nshe's going through and the thought came\ninto his head she might be like rushing\nto the hospital to go see her\nchild so you never know what someone's\ngoing through in their life cuz a lot of\ntimes people present as if nothing's\ngoing wrong someone might be struggling\nwith mental health they might be\nstruggling with anxiety with depression\nand all of those things can greatly\naffect their behavior and their ability\nto make decisions and so really what it\ncomes down to is how can we not let\nother people's actions affect us and to\nbe able to give compassion as much we\npossibly can there may also be dealing\nwith like personal problems as well some\nsome might have financial problems right\nnow they might have just gotten fired or\nthey might be really close to getting\nfired they're worrying about getting\nfired uh they might have just lost their\nhouse they might have relationship\nissues with their children they might\nhave relationship issues with their\ntheir wife or their husband all of these\nthings can cause someone to act in ways\nthat they wouldn't normally act you know\nand their emotions can be very high and\nwhen emotions are high logic is low and\nsometimes people do things that are out\nof character for them and they don't\neven really know that they did it you\nknow they kind of black out and then\nthey're like oh my God what did I just\ndo why did I just do that you know it's\nimportant to really for all of us out\nthere and myself included I'm speaking\nto myself and I'm always speaking to you\nguys it's important for us to have\ncompassion for everyone because we never\nreally truly know what someone's going\nthrough in their lives in their mind\neverything and instead of immediately\njudging somebody and condemning somebody\nfor the actions and what they did what\nwe should try to do and what would be\nreally nice is if we could all I mean\nevery person in the world get better at\nthis what we should try to do is try to\nunderstand acknowledge the factors that\nmay have influenced their behavior and\nsay listen like I don't know what that\nperson's going\nthrough yeah they did do X Y and Z to me\nbut I have decided that I'm not going to\nlet this affect me and I'm going to you\nknow disconnect my feelings of anger or\nfrustration towards that person and I'm\njust going to give them love it doesn't\nmean you have to go up to him and be\nlike hey do you want a hug I'm not\nsaying that it could just be like\nenergetically I'm going to stop coming\nfrom a place of\nof anger and being pissed off and I'm\njust going to put myself into a state of\nlove and say hey I'm going to just send\nyou some good vibes and by doing so what\nwe do is we create a more empathetic\nunderstanding Society where people can\nfeel support they can feel valued rather\nthan judged and rejected I was saying\nthis earlier today on one of my zoom\ncalls that I was on with u mindset\nMentor university the the the weekly\ngroup calls that I do and I was saying\nwhen you think about somebody who pisses\nyou off whatever it is that pissed you\noff about that person whatever that\nwhatever they quote unquote did to you\nthere's a part of you that is the same\nas them so if they were rude in some\nsort of way there's still a part of you\nthat's rude you're not perfect if they\nwere mean in some way there's a part of\nyou that's mean and so a lot of people\nwant everyone else to change in this\nworld they want everyone else to change\nyou should change this and you should\nchange this but in reality you go back\nto the Gandhi quote and I really\nunderstand it started to understand the\npast few years is that uh is to to be\nthe change that you want to see in the\nworld because we can't change other\npeople we can change oursel and what we\nhate quote unquote hate or dislike or\nwhat makes us frustrated about other\npeople also lives inside of us because\nwe're not perfect beings and so what we\nshould do is be focusing on ourselves\nbecause the way that we change society\nis by changing ourselves if everyone in\nsociety just decided that they were\ngoing to change themselves the whole\nworld would be better but instead people\nare like you need to change yourself you\nneed to be different you need to act the\nway that I want you to act right so\nloving and supporting someone is better\nthan lashing out at someone and probably\nwhat they need in the first\nplace and when you uh when you get to\nthat point you allow someone to be able\nto change easier I'm not saying this is\neasy FYI I'm not saying that any of this\nstuff is easy all of this is hard one of\nmy favorite things is when I put\nsomething on Instagram some real talking\nabout something there's always somebody\nin the comments that says easier said\nthan done I'm like every in this earth\nis easier said than done because in\norder to say something all you have to\ndo is just move your lips so it's not\neasy but is something we should work\ntowards to be more compassionate\ncompassion makes us focus and try to\nfind the good in people even when it\nmight not be really immediately apparent\nso instead of focusing on someone's\nnegative actions instead we could try to\nfocus on their positive qualities and\ntry to see if there's a way that we can\nfind good in them cuz have you ever\n up in your life life I'm sure you\nhave wouldn't it be nice if when you did\nscrew up in some sort of way somebody\ninstead of lashing out at you instead of\njudging you guilting you shaming you any\nof that type of stuff actually try to\ngive you some love and support you and\ntry to help you get past that thing\nwouldn't it be better wouldn't you\nwouldn't it be nicer if when you screwed\nup someone focused on your positive\nqualities and the good that you have and\nthe good that you've done versus that\none action that you did the other thing\nis is when I talk about finding\ncompassion I also think it's really\nimportant to start finding compassion\nfor yourself you know there's a relation\nwhen I say improve your relationships\nyou also have a relationship with\nyourself at all points in time and so\nyou've got to realize if you are going\nthrough life and you're still regretting\nor guilting or shaming yourself for\nsomething that you did in the past can\nyou find compassion for\nyourself can you find compassion for\nyourself can you find compassion for\nother people you know when you find\ncompassion for someone else you don't\ncarry anger and hatred\nuh with that person home with you you\ncan learn to let it go it's like the the\nphrase anger is the acid that only Burns\nThe Vessel right so it's like holding on\nto a hot coal expecting that you're\ngoing to throw it at somebody you never\nthrow it at them and you're the only one\nthat gets burned so what we can try to\ndo is we can try to be a little bit more\ncompassionate and realize yeah like\nthat's just a hurt child that's right in\nfront of me and when we practice this\ncompassion we can feel a little bit more\nhappiness in our life because we're not\nholding on to these things we can feel a\nlittle bit more contentment in our life\nbecause we're not holding on to these\nthings and we can reduce our stress and\nour anxiety and just learn to let go and\nlisten I get it I fully get it as I'm\nsaying this it can be really difficult\nto have compassion for for other people\nsometimes because there are a lot of\npeople who are there are a lot\nof people who hurt and especially when\nwe've been hurt in the past and somebody\ncould have somebody that we're thinking\nof that maybe we're close to has hurt us\nin the past it's hard to have compassion\nfor them and we think well if I have\ncompassion for them they're just going\nto continue to step on me but what if we\njust have more compassion and that might\nus being in the energy of compassion\naround that person might be able to free\nthem from whatever it is that's are\ndestructive behaviors or at least give a\nspace to start allowing them to get past\nthat and compassion is a practice it's\nsomething that you work on it's\nsomething that you improve it's not\nsomething you're just born with and this\nis why it's important for you to\nremember that that uh anything that you\ndo to try to do good for yourself to try\nto do good for the world is improving\nthe world even if you just a teeny tiny\nbit in everything that you do and so\nevery single person you come in contact\nwith how can you try to just leave them\nbetter than you found them so that's the\nfirst one the second thing that will\ndefinitely help you and improve your\nrelationships is to make you realize\nthat no one can change your\nmood no one can change your mood I was\ntalking about this on on the on a live\nor earlier this week as well nobody can\nchange your mood nobody can make you\nfeel\nanything think about the last time that\nsomebody really pissed you\noff okay can you remember it can you\nbring it back up to the service can you\nfeel those feelings of being pissed off\nthem right now what was it that they did\nthat really pissed you\noff what was your reaction to it how did\nyou react after you found out that they\ndid XYZ to you what have I told you that\nit's not what they did to\nyou they did not trigger you you\ntriggered yourself it was what you were\nit's not what they did that triggered\nyou it's what you were thinking about\nwhat they did\nit was not what they did it was the\ninternal conversation that you're having\nwith yourself about what they did and I\nalways tell people I care less about\nwhat you do and what I really care about\nis the conversation that's happening in\nyour mind at all points in time because\nthat's the thing that's causing all of\nyour problems that's the thing that's\ngetting in the way of all of your\nrelationships no one can make you feel\ninfer without your\nconsent you know Elanor Roosevelt said\nthat years ago and I it's probably my\nmost most used quote in this podcast is\nno one can make you feel inferior\nwithout your consent which shows that\nnobody can make you feel anything nobody\ncan make you do anything your your\nlashing out your reaction to somebody\nelse has nothing to do with them it has\n100% everything to do with you they\ntriggered\nyou sure maybe but they just did a thing\nand then you were triggered by\nit and when you get triggered as hard as\nit is to kind of accept this when you're\ntriggered it's really a gift it is the\nuniv\ncoming to you through the form of this\n who is who is showing you where\nyou are not free the universe is coming\nto you to present you a lesson through\nthis\nperson it's not about what that person\ndoes to you it's about how you react to\nit and I always say you know Victor\nFrankl who went through a schwitz was a\npsychologist who went through ALS\nschwitz and some seen some of the worst\nthings that humans can do to each other\nsays he's got a famous quote that says\nbetween stimulus and response is a space\nmaster that space and you master your\nlife so between somebody doing something\nquote unquote to you and the way you\nrespond there's a little bit of a space\nit might be a\nmillisecond if you can master that\nmillisecond which is what you think\nabout it and how you're about to react\nto that thing you master your life you\nknow like maybe somebody like just\nimagine somebody comes up to you and\nslaps you right yeah that's that's a\ngood reason to be triggered they did\nsomething to you right but you know you\nmight be able to walk up to some\nenlightened being smack\nthem and what does it say you know I'm\njust thinking about you know how many\nancient text say something along the\nlines of you know when somebody does\nsomething to you turn the other cheek so\nsomebody else might not react the exact\nsame way that you do to it they might be\nable to have no reaction between that\nstimulus and the response it's just let\nit go when you realize that when you\nmaster your reactions your life really\nstarts to change master your reactions\nto being TR triggered quote unquote\ntriggered notice it see what it is feel\nit and start to say okay I'm starting to\nfeel really pissed off right now why am\nI feeling pissed off okay I'm feeling\npissed off because this person this just\ndid this thing to me okay is it because\nthey did that thing to me or is because\nof the fact that I'm thinking thoughts\noh they did this thing to me then\nthey're going to leave me and if they\nleave me I'm going to be alone forever\nand if I'm alone forever then I'm going\nto be sad I'm going to die alone and you\nrealize oh my God something happened and\nthen I created an entire story around\nthis thing that happened so you've got\nto learn to master your reactions so\nthose are two quick simple tips to\nimprove your relationships number one\njust realize everyone's doing their best\nthey really are I promise you that and\nnumber two no one can make your mood\nchange it's you that decides to change\nyour mood so that's what I got for you\nfor today's
