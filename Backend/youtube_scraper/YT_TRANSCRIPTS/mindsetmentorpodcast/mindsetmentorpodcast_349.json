    "transcript": "welcome to today's video hey you've been\nthrough some in your life haven't\nyou I'm here to tell you that you are\nnot broken in any sort of way you're\nperfect exactly as you are and I'm going\nto tell you a little bit more about that\non today's video Let's dive in life is\nhard and whether you have a hard life\nwhether you have what most people not\nconsider a hard life there's still a lot\nof really hard aspects of it maybe you\nhave trauma maybe you don't have a whole\nlot of trauma but there's also going to\nbe heartbreaks there's going to be\npeople who who die that you know there's\na lot of ups and downs of life and um in\nmy line of work um I've kind of seen all\nof it you know and I've seen the the\nbest sides of humans but I've also\nreally seen the worst sides of humans\nand I've had people share their stories\nwith me that have been through some of\nthe worst things that I could possibly\nimagine you know all kinds of abuse\nmental physical sexual abuse suicides\nmurders rapes neglect like there's\nthere's so many things that you could\nall of the dark sides of human I have\nbeen told stories of all of the terrible\nthings in the world and um the thing\nthat I want to talk about today is about\nhow no matter what has happened to you\nuh there's nothing wrong with you and\nthat just because something happened to\nyou in the past does not mean that you\nneed to continue to carry it with you\ninto your future um and you know maybe\nyou haven't had crazy trauma that you\nwould say like your life was pretty good\nit was decent you had some loving\nparents maybe they were still together\nmaybe they got divorced so it doesn't\nhave to be like this oh my gosh massive\ntrauma for it to leave a really deep\nemotional scar you know some people feel\nbad because they feel like their lives\nare pretty good and they feel like they\ndon't deserve to feel like they have\ntrauma you know their parents are still\nI I have a friend whose parents a couple\nfriends I can think of now uh two people\nspecifically who's both their parents\nare still alive uh both their parents\nare still together um and they had like\na pretty decent life they grew up like\nmiddle class and things are okay and\nthey feel like they don't deserve to say\nthat there was any trauma in their past\nbecause they've had a easier Road in\ntheir mind than the average person or in\nsome of the worst things that people\nhave gone through right and so they\nthink to themselves like well I don't\ndeserve to to to say that I've had\ntrauma but then when you start to talk\nwith them you realize like yeah you've\nhad you've had some trauma and you've\nhad some things happen to you in the\npast that have made you who you are you\nknow some people have like never been\nbeaten before but their dad worked all\nthe time and never gave them any love\nand so there was a the the father\nthought to thems I can think of one\nex-client that I have specifically whose\nfather worked all of the time and he had\na decent life middle class everything\nbut his father never really was there\nfor him because he was working so much\nand his father's way of showing love was\nproviding for the family making sure\neveryone was good but with that uh this\nguy developed emotional neglect that\ncame from it you know his dad wasn't\nthere and gave him the love that he\nreally truly wanted you know some people\nthey uh their mother their way that they\nwould um you know train them to to grow\nup and be the way that she wanted them\nto be would pull their love away when\nshe was mad you know there's there's\ndefinitely some some trauma that can\ncome from that there's trauma that can\ncome from not getting the love that you\nwant from a parent or having the love\npulled away by one of your parents um\nanother person I can think of as I was\nwriting this episode is I another person\nI know really well whose mother\ninstilled fear in her and uh they\ninstill she instilled fear into her\nbecause her mother always did that and\nso her mother so my friend's grandmother\nis extremely fearful my friend's mother\nis extremely fearful and both of them\ninstilled fear in their daughters um\nbecause of the fact that they thought\nthat's just the way that it was they\nwatched the news all the time anytime\nsomething goes wrong anytime there's\nsome plane crash in another country she\nsends sends it over to her and you know\nand and so there's been a lot of\nunconscious fear programmed into her\nthere's a lot of trauma that she has\naround that some people's trauma is\nneglect emotional neglect physical\nneglect and and we all have different\nforms of it and the all trauma in the\nbrain and in the body is trauma so\nwhether it is you know physical abuse or\nwhether it's my dad wasn't there those\nare still forms of trauma that can be\ninside of the body doesn't have to be\nstill inside the body but a lot of\npeople continue to carry those things\nwith them so quote unquote big trauma\nand quote unquote small trauma is really\njust a human measurement trauma at its\nsimplest form is not getting what you\nneed in your development and one way\nthat I like to think of trauma and a way\nto think of it as is a breakaway from\nthe state of love you know so if I'm\ntalking about like a car crash and you\nget PTSD driving a car that's not really\nthe trauma that I'm talking about I'm\ntalking more uh about you You Know Your\nParents emotional abuse when a parent\nemotionally abuses a child that's a\nbreakaway from the state of love when a\nparent um neglects a child emotional\nneglect or they they they pull away\ntheir love from their child both of\nthose are a breakaway from the state of\nLove physical neglect not getting the\nthe the the love that you want and\ngetting the U the caring that you want\nor getting the the food that you need\nall of those things can be a breakaway\nfrom the state of Love heartbreak as you\nget older is a breaka away from the\nstate of love and so the state of Love\nis really what I think we're born into\nand the way that we are but there's many\nthings throughout our life that break us\naway from this state of love and it\ncould be a big event that closes you off\nin your development it could be a\nsmaller event that closes you off in\nyour development it could be being\nbullied when you were younger but one\nthing and the reason why I'm diving into\nthis is one thing that I find with\npeople that's very very common is\nbecause of the fact that they have\ntrauma in their past their current self\nfeels broken they feel like there's a\npart of them missing they feel like\nthey're not necessarily whole they feel\nlike they're not worthy and they feel\nlike there's something wrong with them\nbecause of something that happened to\nthem in their past but really something\nthat happened in their past whether it\nwas quote unquote small or quote unquote\nbig is in the past so it doesn't\nnecessarily need to be in the present\nmoment which is means that we're holding\non to our trauma so there's a difference\nbetween trauma in something that is\ntraumatic I guess you could say\nsomething that's traumatic is an event\nGabor mon always says this Gabor mon is\na a psychologist who specializes in\naddiction he says the event is traumatic\ntrauma is US continuing to hold on to\nthat event after the event has passed\nright and so people feel broken they\nfeel like they're not whole they feel\nlike there's something wrong with them\nthey feel like they're not worthy they\nfeel like they don't deserve to be happy\nor they don't deserve to be healthy or\nwealthy or successful and what it is is\nsomething happened to us in our past and\nwe continue to keep bringing that thing\ninto our current reality and if we're\nnot careful we will bring it into our\nfuture and bringing that into our future\nis going to have some way of holding us\nback and the way I like to think about\nit is this right um let's say that\nthere's a a three-legged dog have you\never seen a three-legged dog I love\nthree-legged dogs and the reason why is\nbecause when you see a three-legged dog\nbesides the fact that they're missing a\nleg there's no difference between a\nthree-legged dog and a four-legged dog\neven the two-legged dogs they only have\nthe two back feets two back legs right\nthey are the same amount of happy as any\nother dog they are the same amount of\nlove as any other dog they are the same\namount of joy as any other dog so they\ncould have been hit by a car they could\nhave had a an owner that had something\nwrong with them and and you know\nwhatever it might be and they cause\ntrauma to their leg but that dog has\nthree legs now and they don't look ATS\nand think there's something wrong with\nme I'm not whole right it was an event\nthat happened they let go of it and we\ncould talk about well their memory blah\nblah blah whatever but really what I'm\ntrying to say is they had an event\nhappen to them they're not bringing that\nevent into their present moment but how\nmany people are still holding themsel\nback because they're identifying with a\nversion of thems that was 10 years ago\nsomething happened to them 10 years ago\nyou know uh my dog Toby passed away last\nyear and for the last year\nToby was losing his eyesight and he was\nlosing his hearing he was he was getting\nlike that it was the cutest thing ever\nbut he was the this the his paws were\nnot didn't have as much grip on his paws\nand we have you know tile floors and he\nwas so he was slipping so he had to put\nthese little like stickers that that\nbasically put tread on his his paws so\nthat he could stand up and not fall\nright and so we started to feel bad for\nhim like I felt really bad for him like\nthis guy this poor guy he's losing his\neyesight I can see the cataracts and\nwe're calling him and he can't he can't\nhear us and I felt bad for him but Toby\nnever felt bad for himself that feeling\nbad is a human\nconstruct they have no he did not have\none bit of thought that something was\nwrong with him he up until the day that\nhe died was just as happy as he always\nwas he didn't have as much energy but he\nwas just as happy as he always was and I\nwant you to understand if if the dog can\ndo that if an animal can do that we're\nalso animals as well can we remember a\nlot better than a lot of them sure but a\ntraumatic thing can happen to a dog and\nthey don't bring it into this present\nmoment a traumatic thing can happen to\nus and we we bring it into this present\nmoment and so like I said a lot of\nhumans say like I feel broken I don't\nfeel whole I feel like a part of me is\nmissing I feel like a part of me was\nstolen and I want you to understand that\nwhen we have that type of stuff happen\nall of that is just a story that we're\ntelling ourselves now I'm not saying\nthat you don't need to heal from your\ntrauma that's the exact opposite of what\nI'm saying what I'm saying is just\nbecause something happened in the past\ndoesn't mean that you need to bring it\ninto your future with you you're not\nbroken every person on this planet goes\nthrough some and just because\nsomething happened to you in the past\ndoesn't mean that there's something\nwrong with you and it's just a story\nthat you're telling yourself it's not\ntrue but you believe it and that's the\nimportant thing to understand is that\nyour story that you're telling yourself\nof I'm not good enough I'm not smart\nenough I'm not whole something was taken\nfrom me it was stolen whatever it might\nbe it's not true but we believe it and\nthe thing that we have to realize is the\nmore that we repeat the story over and\nover and over again the more that we\nbelieve that story you know and I've\nsaid this quote before but there's a a\nquote that says that if you tell a lie\nbig enough long enough and strong enough\nand you keep repeating it eventually\npeople will come to believe it person\nwho said that was Hitler if you tell a\nlie big enough and strong enough and you\nkeep repeating it eventually people will\ncome to believe it how often do we do\nthat to ourselves there's there's\nsomething wrong with me there's\nsomething wrong with me there's\nsomething wrong with me I'm even\nhesitant saying this out loud in the\npodcast right now because I just don't\nwant my subconscious to take this in but\nhow often do we say something to\nourselves you know something happened to\nyou seven years ago 17 years ago and\nyou're continuing to say I'm unlovable\nI'm not good enough I'm unlovable I'm\nnot good enough you know your your\nhusband cheated on you 19 years ago and\nyou've still been mostly single the the\nlast 19 years because you keep thinking\nI'm not worthy of love I'm unlovable so\nwhat happens is we have an event that\nhappens to us in the past and is\ntraumatic but we continue to pull this\nthing with us through our every single\nday and create a narrative around that\nthing to make us think that there's\nsomething wrong with us and that's the\ntrauma that we need to start to actually\nwork through and try to release and try\nto change our story around ourselves\nit's not that you're broken it's not\nthat you're unho it's not that you're\nunlovable it's not that you're unworthy\nor that something is missing it's that\nyou won't stop repeating the story and\nso if we're going to change ourselves\nand change our lives we need to put\nourselves in the driver's seat and not\nmake ourselves victims anymore what we\nneed to do is instead of being victims\nof our circumstan and victims of Our\nLives we need to start being the author\nof our story and say yeah that\ndid happen to me it did like for me yeah\nmy father was an alcoholic and he did\npass away when I was 15 from being an\nalcoholic and there was many things that\nhappened around there him going to jail\nand you know not picking me up when he\nwas supposed to pick me up and not being\naround and not necessarily taking care\nof me like you know a parent actually\nshould was was that traumatic yeah could\nI sit here and give an excuse as to well\nI don't have what I want because my dad\nyeah many people do or we could look at\nit and say just because that happened to\nme in the past in my you know chapter\nchapter 9 through chapter 15 of my life\nthat happened but I'm not going to\ncontinue reading chapter 9-15 cuz I'm on\nchapter 37 right now you can't allow\nthose things to become your identity\nyou've got to be very aware of when you\nstart to say oh there's something wrong\nwith us oh there's something wrong with\nme there's I'm unlovable I'm not smart\nenough this happened to me years ago you\nknow if you tell a child that there's\nmonsters under their bed every day\nthey'll be terrified to go to bed what\nmonsters have you been creating in your\nown life what ways have you been\ncreating monsters and then terrifying\nyourself from doing what it is that you\ntruly want to do because you're telling\nyourself a lie sure it happened in the\npast it's not happening anymore and if\nyou have trauma if you have something\ntraumatic that happened to you in the\npast\nwe all have it's our it is the the\nphrase I always like to to say in the\nquote that I got from I remember it was\nyears ago but it says uh it was not your\nfault but it is your responsibility all\nof those things that happened to you in\nyour past they're not your fault you\nknow most of them are not your fault you\nknow if you did something in a\nrelationship that could have been your\nfault but you know if you're a child and\nthings happened to you that's not your\nfault but it is your responsibility to\nwork through that thing you know for me\nlike it's not my fault that my father's\nan alcoholic it's not my father it's not\nmy fault fault that he never overcame\nyou know his trauma from when his dad\ncommitted suicide it's not my fault that\nhe passed away when he was when I was 15\nyears old but it is my responsibility to\nheal myself from those things it is my\nresponsibility to continue to keep on\nthe path and create the life that I want\nto that is my responsibility none of\nthose things were my fault but it is my\nresponsibility and you know the the\nproblem with with personal development\nand I I love personal development\nclearly obviously but when we start to\nnotice things that we want to improve in\nourselves and the way we want to learn\nand grow we can start to feel like we're\nstarting from a negative State like\nthere's something wrong like well I'm\nnot even normal because I've got XYZ\nwrong with me now we've all got\nsomething wrong with us we're all\nup right but your mess is your message\nit's the thing that you need to work\nthrough it's your responsibility to do\nit so then how do we start to solve this\nso I'm going to kind of give you some\nideas of how you can start to work these\nthings and solve it the first thing that\nI would recommend is to talk with\nsomebody and there's a quote that I want\nyou to remember is that shame breeds in\nthe dark so when you have these things I\nthink the I had a whole lot of Shame\nwhen I was younger about my father a\nwhole lot of shame I never told anybody\nabout my alcoholic father he embarrassed\nme he would show up to sports games\nbaseball games basketball games wasted\nand be that embarrassing parent that was\ninside of the uh at the games and stuff\nlike that and so I didn't when he passed\naway I didn't tell anybody and I didn't\ntell anybody for years about it and I\nrealized as I started get on my personal\ndevelopment Journey that shame breeds in\nthe dark is and the less that I share it\nthe more that it has control over me and\nthe more that I share it the more that I\nhave control over it in the narrative in\nhow I want to be so talk with someone\nwhether that's a friend whether that's a\ntherapist whatever it might be try to\ntalk with somebody the second thing is\nto start telling yourself a new story\ndon't say that it didn't happen I'm not\nsaying that but stop the story that\nyou're telling yourself and tell\nyourself a new one yeah this did happen\nto me and this was a perfectly designed\ncurriculum in life because I'm going to\ndo XYZ with it you know I I train a lot\nof coaches on how to grow their coaching\nbusinesses and one of the things that I\nlove the most is that there's a lot of\npeople who come in with traumas but\nthey've taken the trauma and said I've\nlearned a lot from it I've grown a lot\nfrom it and I'm going to use what I've\nlearned from it to help other people who\nhave gone through the same thing or are\ngoing through the same things and so\nyou've got to stop the story that you\ncurrent have you've got to tell yourself\na new one and you've got to repeat it\ndaily you know if you want to just keep\nyou just have to keep it going because\nyou know you've you've told yourself\nwhatever this lie is that you're not\ngood enough or you're unlovable there's\nsomething wrong with you that you're\nbroken 10,000 times so we've got to\nstart to rewrite that story and so\nthat's the the second thing third thing\nis to accept it accept that it happened\nto you accept that's who you are what\nyou've been through don't wish that it\nwould have been different it was perfect\nit was exact and you know Peter cron\nalways says what happened happened and\ncould not have happened any other way\nbecause it didn't it means that what\nhappened to you even though it might not\nhave been what you wanted it was it was\nwhat happened to you because there's\nsomething that you're supposed to learn\nfrom there's something you're supposed\nto grow from it instead of making it\nsomething that's that's holding us back\ncan we extract lessons from it and allow\nit to to allow us allow our learning\nfrom it and growing from it to get us\nbetter in our path of Life the fourth\nthing this one's a hard one forgive\nforgive the person not for them don't\nforgive them for them for them for\nyourself forgive yourself is another\nperson that you should forgive as well I\nhave entire episode you can go back and\nlisten to on forgiveness that I think is\nreally important where I just talk about\nhow forgiveness is the thing that's\ngoing to free you when you're life\nbecause something could have happened to\nyou 11 years ago and you're continuing\nto hold on to it you're mentally\nemotionally physically just still\nwrapped up in that thing when you\nforgive you allow yourself to get past\nit whether you're giving forgiving\nyourself for some mistakes that you made\nin the past or forgiving someone else\nfor something that they did to you in\nthe past it allows you to let go of it\nand then last one as I've been saying\nthroughout this podcast realize that\nyou're not broken your trauma builds you\nand you can build a new identity for\nyourself from that trauma what do you\nwant that new identity to be realize\nthere's nothing wrong with you you're\nperfect exactly as you are there's\nnothing that you could do or say to make\nyou more whole or more of a person or\nmore worthy or more acceptable than you\ncurrently are right now you've just got\nto understand deep in your bones that\nthere's nothing wrong with you but that\nyou're going to learn and grow and get\nbetter from what happened so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories tag me at robd\njunor r o d i a l Jr and with that I'm\ngoing to leave you the same way I leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission to make someone else is day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
