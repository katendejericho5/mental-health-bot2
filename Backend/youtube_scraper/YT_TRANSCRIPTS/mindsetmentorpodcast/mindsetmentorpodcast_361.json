    "transcript": "welcome to today's video we're going to\nbe talking about how to get through the\ntough times in your life but also not\njust how to get through the tough times\nin your life how to actually grow and\nimprove every single time you go through\nsomething that's hard let's dive in the\nolder that I get the more I realize that\nlife is beautiful life is hard life is a\n show life is up and down it's\nterrible sometimes and it's just\nabsolute hell and then sometimes it's\nabsolute pure Bliss it's like hell\nsometimes it's Heaven other times and\none thing that is absolutely for sure is\nno matter what if you're going to\ncontinue on and do this human thing for\na little bit longer you're going to have\nto go through some hard times you're\ngoing to have to go through some pain\nand when I was young I remember thinking\nto myself I I always played this victim\ncard of why is this happening to me and\nthen I would complain and I would think\nabout the situation that I was in and I\nwould think well why is it not this way\nI want it to be different I want\neverything to be different and it was\nalways this this kind of even if I\ndidn't necessarily specifically say it\nor think it was this this feeling of why\nis this happening to me and basically\nwithout knowing what I was doing was I\nwas making myself into this little\nvictim like a a child and I was like why\nis this happening to me as if I wasn't\nin control of of My reality in some sort\nof way as if you know somebody was\ncoming to save me and hopefully one day\nthey'll come and I'll just kind of sit\nhere and wait for it to happen but as uh\nI got older I started to realize looking\nback through through many different\nchapters of my life I realized that the\nmost important moments of my life the\nmost important growth moments of my life\nwere always without fail the hardest\nmoments of my life now I would never\nwant to go back to those moments ever\nagain but when I look back at them and\nI'm like d damn like those are the\nmoments where I learn the most I learned\nthe most about myself I learned the most\nabout life I learned the most about\nother people and as I look back at them\nI would never want to go back to those\nmoments ever like you can not pay me to\ngo back to those moments but you also\ncouldn't pay me to steal the lessons\nthat I learned from Life in those\nmoments as well and so it's really\nimportant to start thinking of life this\nway and reminding yourself that when you\nare going through hell just keep going\nlike don't stay there just keep going\nbecause on the other side of that inside\nof that as well is all of the lessons\nthat you need to grow and get better um\nI did not learn as much and the easy\ngreat moments of my life now I loved\nhaving great moments in my life but\nwhere I learned the most about life and\neverything was at the really hard\nmoments you know growing up with an\nalcoholic father I learned a lot I\nlearned a lot about human psychology\nwhen I was 6 7 8 9 years old people\nalways look at me and they're like\nyou've been doing this for for how long\nyou're 37 years old you've been doing\nthis now and coaching people for 17\nyears I'm like yeah I learned I learned\nhumans real soon I learned what you know\nI was watching what was going on with my\nfather I was watching what was going on\nwith my mother I was watching what was\ngoing on with my sister I was watching\nwhat was going on with myself and as a\nkid I was just really quiet I was really\nsilent I was always thinking a lot I was\nnever one of the kids that that blamed\nmy parents' divorce on myself I was\nalways like yeah I mean that makes sense\nthis guy's guy's an alcoholic he's doing\nthis to our family and so I learned a\nlot about human psychology I learned a\nlot about life I would not be doing what\nI do now had I not gone through all of\nthat stuff so having an alcoholic father\nI learned a lot going through my\nfather's death with him being the very\nfirst person that I ever knew uh that\npassed away going through that I learned\na lot going through both of my\ngrandparents death which their deaths\nwithin 17 days of each other and and\nwatching that whole process and being in\nthe room when my grandfather passed away\nand took his last breath I learned a lot\nthrough all of that you know going\nthrough breakups I learned a lot going\nthrough multiple failed businesses I\nlearned a lot going through uh moving to\na completely different state that I had\nnever lived in in my entire life I\nlearned a lot all of those moments were\nreally freaking hard and I mean like\nreally hard very hard but that's where\nthe the juice of that's like where the\njuice is that's where you learn about\nlife that's where I learn more about\nlife than I did in any other moment and\nI've had great moments of my life and\nI've traveled to amazing places and you\nknow when I'm if if I go and travel to\nItaly and I'm going and looking at the\nviews and sipping great wine and eating\ncheese and eating pizza and pasta and\nall of that and experiencing it it's\nbeautiful it's amazing but I definitely\ndon't learn as much about life as when\nI'm going through hard moments and I\nhave found that life that your life that\nmy life is the perfectly crafted\ncurriculum for whatever it is that you\nneed to learn whatever your soul needs\nto learn while it's here it is the\nperfect perfectly crafted curriculum\nthere it could not be more perfectly\ncrafted and I think we're just not\nlooking at it the right way that's the\nproblem and when you're sitting around\nand you're complaining about wanting to\nthings be different you're missing the\nmagic you're missing everything that\nyou're supposed to learn it's like when\nyou get to those hard moments in life\nthose are the tests those the studying\nfor the test that's where you're\nsupposed to learn the most it's not just\nthe field trips where you learn about\nlife and and one of the biggest shifts\nthat I ever made in my life that I hope\nyou can you can start to adopt this\nmindset in some sort of way uh but one\nof the biggest shifts I ever made in my\nlife was switching from the the thought\nof why is this happening to me and just\nbeing a complete victim of my\ncircumstance to switching it to what can\nI learn from this if my soul came here\nto Earth to learn something and I'm\ngoing through this thing what am I\nsupposed to get from it because if I'm\ngoing to go through and it's\ngoing to be as hard as it is I'm for\ndamn sure going to get whatever lesson\nI'm supposed to get right so what am I\nsupposed to learn from this what's the\ngift in this thing why is God or the\nuniverse giving me this lesson why does\nthis this more powerful thing than I can\nunderstand having me go through this\nwhat am I supposed to get from it\nbecause you only you only actually see\nlife through the lens of what you're\nthinking you know there's a u a video\nthat I made that actually I talked about\non a podcast and we made it into a video\nand it went crazy viral on Tik Tok and I\nwas talking about how if you go to\nGoogle and you type in is coffee bad for\nyour eyesight you will come up with tons\nof articles that show you how coffee is\nbad for your eyesight but if you also go\nto Google and type in is coffee good for\nyour eyesight you will get tons and tons\nof articles\nshowing you how coffee is amazing for\nyour\neyesight what does that show you\nwhatever you type into Google is what\nyou're going to find your brain works\nthe exact same way your brain is like\nCosmic Google whatever you ask of it you\nwill find the answers why is this\nhappening to me oh it's happening to you\nand your brain will find all the answers\nwhy it's happening to you it's happening\nto you because you're a bad person it's\nhappening to you because you're\nunlovable it's happening to you because\nyou're a failure you'll never amount to\nanything and that's only because you're\nasking the questions that are going to\nget those answers which means you're\nperpetuating your fears and you're\nlimiting\nbeliefs so what if we just change our\nquestions that we ask oursel how could\nthat change our perspective when we're\ngoing through the hardest moments of Our\nLives what am I supposed to learn from\nthis well you're supposed to learn how\nto not make that mistake again in the\nfuture you're supposed to learn the red\nflags in a relationship you're supposed\nto learn how to challenge yourself to\nthink different that's what you're\nsupposed to learn whatever you ask of\nyourself whatever you ask your brain\nyour brain will find the answers to it\nis the exact same as go to Google I know\nyou can go to Google and type anything\nthat you want to and you're going to\ncome back with some sort of answers this\nthe craziest thing I always say to my\nwife I'm like there's almost I I don't\nthink there's anything that hasn't been\nGoogled before with billions of people\nusing Google every single day they've\nthought the same thing and they've had\nthe same questions that I have and so\nyou've got to start thinking of it\ndifferent you know when you think of\nthose questions I want to go through it\nagain for you to really understand when\nyou sit there and you ask yourself you\nask your brain you ask your Cosmic\nGoogle why is this happening to me it is\nonly going to find the answers that make\nyou more of a victim and perpetuate that\nbecause you're not lovable that's why\nshe cheated on you because you're a bad\nperson that's why you got fired because\nyou're a failure that's why your\nbusiness isn't succeeding you'll never\namount to anything right and so it's\ngoing to find that it's going to\nperpetuate these fears and these\nlimiting beliefs that you're trying to\nget past so if you want to change your\nperspective and change your life you've\ngot to change the questions that you ask\nyourself man I'm going through a really\nhard moment right now instead of why is\nthis happening to me when you're going\nthrough it hey if there was like some\nchance that this Rob dial guy was right\nand there is something I'm supposed to\nlearn from it what am I supposed to\nlearn from\nthis see what comes up grab a pen and\npaper Journal it write it down what am I\nsupposed to learn from this breakout\nwhat am I supposed to learn from this\nperson dying what am I supposed to learn\nfrom getting fired what am I supposed to\nlearn from this business failing what am\nI supposed to learn from this health\nissue there's always a lesson that's\nthere for you the problem is you're just\nnot looking for it and it it really\ngives you an opportunity to get yourself\nout of your normal thinking and create\nnew Pathways in the brain to challenge\nyourself to think differently to not be\nthe same person how can you think\ndifferently about what's going on what\nif everything that has happened to you\nall the time is not happening to you\nit's happening for you what\nif I mean what if what what if and I\nknow it sounds corny I know it sounds\ncliche to be you know like a\nmotivational speaker and be like there's\na silver lining just search for the\nSilver Lining and it's super corny and\ncliche and I get it but it kind of is\ntrue you have to get yourself out of\nthis victim mindset of why why me why is\nthis always happen to me why do people\nalways do this to me and make yourself\nsuch a little victim and start start\nsaying like why is this happening for me\nwhat is this supposed to what am I\nsupposed to be learning what am I\nsupposed to be growing from this what if\neverything that was happening was\nhappening for you what if everything\nthat's ever happened to you was\nhappening for you what if you know\nwhether you believe in anything or\nwhether you don't whether you're believ\nin God whether you're an atheist whether\nyou're anything you don't know what to\nthink what if just think about this for\na second what if there was an unseen\nforce that was always looking out for\nyour best interest but you've just been\nmissing it how would that change your\nperspective on your\nlife and it really comes to the point we\nlike hey all right I'm going through\nthis thing I'm going to keep on going\nthrough it you're going through how keep\non going and it's really important to\nunderstand that before a breakthrough in\nlife there is almost always a breakdown\nand so what do you do when you're going\nthrough these moments well if you've got\nemotion that you need to process process\nthe emotion I'm not saying don't cry\ndon't get mad don't punch a pillow any\nof that I'm saying do all of that\nprocess your emotion but after you get\nthrough the emotion grab a pen and paper\nand just ask yourself questions instead\nof asking yourself the the victim\nquestions of why this happening to me\nask yourself questions where you can\nlearn from the question that you ask\nyourself so when you're going through\nsomething really tough you're going\nthrough a really tough moment in your\nlife ask yourself the question write it\ndown pen and paper what am I supposed to\nlearn from this and then come up with\nall of the answers oh you know what I'm\nsupposed to learn oh how to know what\nred flags look like in a relationship so\nI can avoid them in the future how to\nmake sure that I don't get back into a\nrelationship with someone who we've\nbroken up four times you there's always\nlessons to something especially in\nrelationships with yourself with\nrelationships with other people what am\nI supposed to be learning from this\nthat's a really good question to ask\nyourself what's another really good\nquestion how is this going to help me\ngrow how is this thing that I'm going\nthrough going to help me grow another\ngood question how will it make me more\nresilient another good question how is\nthis a\ngift another good question what do I\nwant to never forget about this what is\nthe what am I supposed to be getting\nfrom this thing and then what you do is\nyou start to find the lessons that\nyou're supposed to get from these\nmoments and so what do you do as a human\nyou take these lessons so instead of\neverything just living in your head you\ntake it from your head you put on piece\nof paper and then what do you do you\nintegrate the lesson in your life you\nwent through hell to learn the lesson\ndon't forget the lesson and then once\nyou've identified the lesson it's time\nto integrate into your daily life so\nthat when you let's say that the whole\nthing that we've been talking about is\nyou're going through a breakup and you\nhad red flags that's what you're\nsupposed to learn red flags how you were\nsupposed to act in relationship how they\nwere what you want in a relationship\nthose are things that you've learned\nwell now when you go and you actually\nhave a conversation with somebody that\nyou're interested in you start thinking\nto yourself okay I remember what\nhappened the last time I got into a\nrelationship let me go ahead and just\nsearch through my journal and see you\nknow compare my notes of this new person\nwith what I learned when I went through\nthe really hard time the last time and\nwhat you do is you start to integrate\nthese into your life and then when you\nnotice the red flags pop up again oh\nhold on I'm starting to notice some\npatterns here maybe I should remove\nmyself from this relationship or have a\nconversation with this person and let\nthem know what I'm seeing and seeing if\nthey're say seeing the same thing and\nreally it might mean that you need to\nchange thought patterns that's a good\nthing it might mean that you need to\nchange behaviors that's a good thing it\nmight mean that you need to take\ndifferent actions in your life that\nalign with the lesson that you learned\nthat's a good thing it might mean that\nyou need to take different actions in\nyour life that align with the future\nthat you're trying to create that's a\ngood thing and what I want you to\nunderstand like what if from the only\nthing I want you to take from this\nepisode what if whenever anything\nhappens to you good bad neutral you just\nstart thinking you know what this is\nperfect this is absolutely perfect this\nis perfect this is what I need this is\nwhat I want this is going to help me\ngrow in some sort of way there is some\nunseen force that is on my side that\njust wants me to win and what if\nyou started how would your life change\nhow would your perspective of every\nsingle thing that you do change if you\nstarted looking at the world through\nthat lens versus looking through the\nlens of why is this happening to me so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode uh\nplease share it on Instagram stories tag\nme in it Rob dial Jr r o d i a l Jr also\nif you love this podcast I'm guessing\nyou'll probably love my book that just\ncame out last month um it is uh\nliterally 17 years of
