    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to get\nbetter at taking action to create the\nlife that you want let's dive in if you\nactually think about it life is not hard\nyou are where you are right now and\nthere is a place in the future that you\nwant to be and the only way to go from\nwhere you are now to where you want to\nbe is to get your ass up and do what\nneeds to be done but why don't we do it\nand so I have a u I actually found this\nI was trying to figure out where it came\nfrom I don't know who who actually wrote\nit I found it on a couple different\nwebsites one of them was strangest loop.\nanother one was a guy named Gareth\nWilliams and it's this thing called\ndoing the\nthing and I'm going to read it to you\nit's an article that I think is perfect\nfor what we're going to talk about today\nand here's what he says preparing to do\nthe thing isn't doing the thing\nscheduling time to do the thing isn't\ndoing the thing making a to-do list the\nof the thing isn't doing the thing\ntelling people you're going to do the\nthing isn't doing the thing messaging\nfriends who may or may not be doing the\nthing isn't doing the thing writing a\nbanger tweet on how you're going to do\nthe thing isn't doing the thing hating\non yourself for not doing the thing\nisn't doing the thing hating on other\npeople who have done the thing isn't\ndoing the thing hating on obstacles in\nthe way of doing the thing isn't doing\nthe thing fantasizing of all of the\nAdoration you'll receive\nonce you do the thing isn't doing the\nthing reading about how to do the thing\nisn't doing the thing reading about how\nother people did the thing is not doing\nthe thing reading this essay isn't doing\nthe thing the only thing that is doing\nthe thing is doing the thing\nso when you look at that what the hell\ndoes that mean it means that all too\noften we know what we need to do to be\nsuccessful we do but but a lot of times\nwe aren't doing it a lot of the work\nthat I do so obviously I have this\npodcast and obviously I have a business\nwhere I teach people how to grow their\ncoaching businesses and then I obviously\nhave something called mindset Mentor\nUniversity which is a weekly call and\nthen I also can consult business owners\nas well I've worked with a lot of\nbusiness own owners over the years like\na lot thousands of business owners over\nthe years and it is very obvious to me\nafter working with a lot of business\nowners why 65% of businesses fail within\nit their first 10 years it's extremely\nobvious because it's the business\nowner's mind the business is always a\nreflection of the business owner and if\nthe business owner's mind is not in the\nright place then obviously the business\nis not going to be in the right place\nthey're not going to do the right things\nthey're not going to manage people\ncorrectly and they're going to holds\nback in some sort of way and all too\noften what we do is we get caught up\npretending we're doing the thing versus\nactually doing the thing like the\nexample that I always give if you've\nbeen listening this podcast for a long\ntime is you say hey you know what I'm\ngoing to do I'm going to I'm going to\ntrain for a marathon I've you know I'm\n45 years old I've never ran a marathon\nI've always thought it'd be great to run\na marathon I'm going to do that and so\nwhat do you do you go online and you\nresearch what are the best running shoes\nand you go and you start to see okay is\nit Adidas is it Nike is it Brooks what\nare the what's the best running shoes\nwhat's the best what running style do I\nhave and so then you go to like a\nrunning store and you hop on a treadmill\nand they watch you run and they say hey\nthis is you actually over pronate you\nneed these types of shoes you're like\nokay cool 150 bucks for these pairs of\nshoes cool you got your shoes and then\nyou're like you know what I need to do I\nneed to get some shorts I need to make\nsure I have some Shorty Short running\nshorts you know that I don't get my way\nso I can be faster when I'm running and\nthen I need to research some shirts and\nI need to go on YouTube and see what the\nbest shirts are and then I need to go on\nAmazon and buy those shirts and then\nwhat I should probably do is I should\nprobably go on YouTube and look up the\nlike the big Runners that are on YouTube\nmaybe they'll teach me how to run better\nand you know what I should probably do I\nshould probably read some articles I\nshould you know what I should probably\ndo I should probably subscribe to\nRunners magazine so that I can read\nabout Runners so that I start becoming a\nbetter Runner and now all of those\nthings do all of those things help in\nsome sort of way sure I'm sure they help\nin some sort of way but are they the\nmost important thing are they doing the\nthing no going and searching researching\nrunning shoes and running shorts and\nshirts and looking up Runners on YouTube\nand reading articles and subscribing to\nmagazines are not doing the thing the\nonly thing that's doing the thing is to\nput on your shoes get your ass outside\nand going for a run that's it but what\nwe do is we we it's it's really the\ndifference between being busy versus\nbeing productive have you ever had a day\nwhere you're like go go go you're\nworking you're working you're working\nand then at the end of the day you sit\ndown you're like God I was busy all day\nand I don't feel like I got anything\ndone you don't feel like you checked off\nany of the big things on your list I've\nhad those days before and the reason why\nis because you're you're doing things\nbut you're not doing the most important\nthings you're keeping yourself busy\nversus actually being productive and\nbeing productive means moving the needle\nright so you it's like we've all done\nthis before we make a to-do list it's\ngot 27 things on the to-do list and then\nyou're you have all of these things on\nthe to-do list that some of them are are\nextremely extremely important and\nbecause those things are so important\nand you know that there's such a big you\nknow they might be such a big boulder to\nmove that you're like well let me get a\ncouple things crossed off my schedule or\non my to-do so I feel better and so what\ndo you do instead you decide that you're\ngoing to uh empty the dishwasher because\nempty the dishwasher was there and you\ncan check this thing off real quick and\nso what you do is instead of going for\nthe big things the important things the\nmost what you do is you go for the\nthings that'll check off the most things\noff your to-do list when\nreally that's not not that\nimportant maybe yeah sure you do have to\nempty the dishwasher yeah you got to\nempty the dishwasher is that the most\nimportant thing that you could do today\nno so what are the most important things\nthat you do today when you look at that\nto-do list do you Circle number one\nnumber two and number three and do\nnothing else until you get those things\ndone because those things are the things\nthat need to be done those are doing the\nthings don't trick yourself and act like\nyou're doing what needs to be done when\nin reality you're just keeping yourself\nbusy and one way to really and this is\nsomething I've been using for years one\nof my very first mentors used to say\nthis to me all the time because you know\nwhen I was when I was new in sales I\nused to do this all the time I used to\nact like I was busy and so you know we\nwould have these things called phone\njams and we would go into the office and\nwe make aund phone calls and we had all\nI had tons and tons of papers with all\nof these different numbers and stuff and\nso I would spend like two hours I'd go\nto go make phone calls and I spent like\ntwo hours organizing my list and my\nmanager is like what have you been doing\nthe past two two hours and I was like\nwell I was organizing my list cuz I want\nto make sure I'm ready to make some\ncalls and he's like listen making calls\nis the only thing that matters that's\nall you got to do I don't care if your\nlist is organized I don't care if it's\ndisorganized just make a 100 phone calls\nthat's what it comes down to and so the\nthe question he used to always ask me\nand and that I've literally brainwashed\ninto myself over the past 17 years is to\nask yourself this question is what I'm\ndoing right now getting me closer to or\nfurther from my\ngoals don't yourself be honest\nyou know looking at shoe reviews is not\ngoing to make you a better Runner\nlooking at shoe reviews is not going to\nhelp you finish a\nmarathon sure you need good shoes I'm\nnot going to lie to you in that but do\nthat another time what you need to do is\nyou need to get up you need to go for a\nrun that's what you need to do if you're\na business owner doing all of the\nresearch some research might be\nnecessary but in reality what really\nneeds to be done how do you get more\nRevenue into your business if you're a\nsales person sure researching your\nclient uh might be something that you\ncould do re or I guess you could say\nyour prospect right researching a\nprospect could be something that you\ncould do um going and actually looking\nat the product and getting better\nknowledge of the product and more\nproduct conviction sure those things are\nimportant but what's the most important\nthing making the freaking phone call to\ntalk to a prospect or knocking on the\nnext door to make sure that you talk to\nthe next Prospect and and so what we do\nis we try to trick ourselves and it's\nvery subtle sometimes and You' got to be\nvery clear is what I'm doing right now\ngetting me closer to or further for my\ngoals if my goal was to make 100 phone\ncalls today and that's what I need to do\nand I'm sitting there and I'm and I'm\nlooking at the different product and the\nproduct numbers and I'm going well I\nneed to make sure that I am 100% sure on\nmy product that's not the most important\nthing what's the most important thing\ntalking to another person getting some\nRevenue into the business and really\nwhat it comes down to is you have to\nunderstand that in this life and at some\npoint in time hopefully we all wake up\nand we got to be an adult and we have to\nrealize with being an adult is that\nnobody no one is coming to save you\nnobody gives a damn about your success\nmore than you do and so if you're\nwaiting for like just magic to happen it\nain't going to happen sometimes you just\ngot to pull up your big boy and girl\nbritches and you just got to do the\nthing that you got to do you just got to\ndo the thing if it's going to be done\nyou have to do it you have to make a\ndecision that you are fed up with where\nyou currently are even if your life\nisn't that bad but you're just like it's\nnot my full potential you have to make\nthe decision of I am done with where I\ncurrently am you're fed up with living\nup to 50% of your potential and being\nmediocre and fitting in with everybody\nelse you're fed up with not bringing\nyour full self to every single thing\nthat you do you're fed up with letting\nyour fears and you're limiting beliefs\nthat you know don't even actually truly\nexist in reality they only exist in your\nhead but you're you're fed up with\nletting those things hold you back and\nstop you from taking the action that you\nneed to and when I say you have to make\nthe decision what I mean by making the\ndecision is ultimately that you need to\nconsciously make the decision that there\nis no that you're going to kill off your\nold self and there is no going back you\nif you've listened this podcast for a\nwhile I've said this multiple times the\nroot word when you look at the word for\ndecision is decader and deader actually\nmeans to cut off and that means to cut\noff all other options when you make a\ndecision I think the problem is a lot of\npeople are like yeah I'm going to make\nthe decision to grow my\nbusiness and then you decide to start a\nbusiness and then you start doing other\nthings or maybe you have a plan B just\nin case this bu business doesn't succeed\nno when you say decision when you mean\ncut off means you know let's go ahead\nand and quote Eminem success is my only\n option failures not there\nis no other thing that I'm going to do\nexcept for this thing until I succeed\nthat is the only way that you will get\nwhat you truly want out of life is when\nyou put 100% of yourself into to\nwhatever it is that you want to do even\nif it's you know growing a business if\nit's being the best husband you could be\nif it's being the best mother that you\ncould be you've got to bring 100% of\nyourself to the thing that you want to\nmaster and you've got to burn the ships\nand that's what they mean by the\ndecision to cut off deader to cut off\nall of the\nyou know there's the phrase the the\nstory of the Spanish conqueror who came\nover to I guess it was us or Central\nAmerica whatever it was and he could\nnotice that his his ship mates the\npeople that were on a ship is they were\njust not really in it and they were just\nkind of like thinking about turning\naround and so when they landed on Shore\nhe said burn the ships cuz they are\nWooden Ships burn the ships because when\nyou burn the ships you can't turn around\nyou can't go back to Spain you have to\ndecide it's either success or death\nthat's really what it comes down to and\nso you've got to have this decision in\nyour mind of I'm going to do the thing\nI'm not going to keep messing with\nmyself you know by scheduling out and\nyou know there some people that are like\noh I'm an overthinker I like to over\nplan and so I schedule and then I\nschedule my scheduling time and then I\nschedule for my scheduling for my\nscheduling time and they just schedule\nand schedule and plan and plan and then\nthey make a to-do list and then they\ntell all of these people oh you know\nwhat I'm going to do I'm going to start\nthis business you know I'm going to\nmessage my friends and tell I'm going to\nstart this business you know what I'm\ngoing to do I'm going to I'm going to\nput out an awesome tweet and tell people\nabout how I'm starting this business you\nknow what I'm going to do I'm going to\ncreate an Instagram store and I'm going\nto talk about how I'm going to start\nthis\nbusiness none of that is actually\nstarting the\nbusiness you're not it's it's really\nwhat it is more than anything else is\njust mental masturbation that's what\nyou're doing you're it's just mental\nmasturbation you're not you're not\ntaking any actual physical action to\nmove you closer to the goals of what\nyou're trying to create in yourself and\nthe life that you're trying to create\nand then so what do we do oh my gosh I\nget so down on myself and I guilt myself\nand I shame myself for not doing the\nthing that I need to be doing hating on\nyourself is not doing the\nthing it ain't stop doing it just do the\nfreaking thing already hating on other\npeople who are already successful oh\nthey must have screwed people over oh\nyou know what they probably come from a\nrich family oh you know and making up\nall of these excuses hating on other\npeople is also not doing the\nthing looking at all of the obstacles\nand be like oh my gosh it's just all of\nthese obstacles are just so stupid I'm\ngoing to hate on all the obstacles\nthat's also not doing the thing thinking\nabout what how amazing your life is\ngoing to be and how you're going to have\nall these people that are going to be\nlike oh my gosh I can't believe she's so\nsuccessful she's doing so well and\nfantasizing about all of the Adoration\nyou're going to get from it that's not\ndoing the thing either sitting down and\nthinking you know what I'm going to do\nI'm going to do some research on other\npeople who have done the thing I'm going\nto read some books on how they've done\nthe thing that's not doing the thing the\nonly thing that is doing the thing is\ngetting your ass up and actually taking\nthe action that you need to and so I\nwant you to understand don't\nyourself you've got to be honest am I\ndoing the thing I need to be doing to\nget me close to my goals is what I'm\ndoing right now getting me closer to or\nfurther from my goals if it is getting\nyou closer to your goals and it is doing\nthe thing then just continue doing it\nbut if it's anything else if it's not\ndoing the thing oh yeah you know what\nI'm just trying to cross off to do this\nyou know what I'm doing too much\nresearch instead of actually taking the\ncorrect action to bring Revenue into my\nbusiness anything other than doing the\nthing you need to stop doing and do some\nother time schedule your time out to\ntake the action that you need to pull up\nyour big boy and big girl britches do\nwhat needs to be done and take the\naction that you need to to build the\nlife that you want because no one else\nis going to come and save you and if you\ndon't take this action you're going to\nget to the end of your life and you're\ngoing to regret that you didn't take the\naction you needed to to create the life\nthat you want for yourself for your\nchildren for everyone that you\nlove and you're just going to live\nregret and that's not what you want I\npromise you that\ndoing the thing is the only thing that\nis doing the thing so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if
