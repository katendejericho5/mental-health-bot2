    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the fear of\nrejection and how to get past the fear\nof rejection so that you can make sure\nthat you go out and create the life that\nyou want let's dive in when I when I\nlook out into people that I've coached\nover the years and conversations that\nI've had and speeches that I've given uh\nthis is one of the if not the most this\nis probably number two of the things\nthat hold people back the most in their\nlife number one uh is usually like the\nfear of failure that's what I hear more\nthan anything else but fear of rejection\nis almost always number two and so it's\nthe fear of rejection when you start to\ndive into it this episode is going to be\ndifferent than you think that it's going\nto be I'm not just going to talk about\nthe fear of rejection there's going to\nbe a turn that you probably won't expect\nand I'm actually going to go really deep\ninto your subconscious and also your\nconditioning and your programming from\nchildhood and uh when we start off just\nbefore we dive into that though the\nstart off with the fear of rejection the\nfear of rejection makes sense when you\nlook at it as a tribal being you know if\nyou if you look back 100,000 200,000\nyears ago our species humans had to\nsurvive and the way to survive was being\nin a tribe so to be kicked out of that\ntribe meant basically guaranteed death\nto be kicked out of the tribe to not\nhave protection to not have hunting\nGathering someone to take care of the\nchildren all of that uh meant that you\nknow you were going to die your family\nwas going to die if you weren't in the\ntribe but what I want to dive into today\nis much much deeper than that it's not\nas much as of of today's episode is not\nas much of a safety thing like the\ntribal being side it's actually more of\na subconscious self-love thing more than\nanything else is what we're going to\ndive into today um so when you hear that\nit might not correlate right now like\nhow does the fear of rejection correlate\nwith me not loving myself or not\naccepting myself and so let's talk about\nit where this episode came from just to\ngive you an idea I was on my weekly uh\nlive that I have with a group of people\nthat I that's called\nmmu which is mindset Mentor University\nand uh in mindset Mentor University on\nthe zoom yesterday one of the members\nwas asking about the fear of rejection\nand I started going really deep like I'm\ngoing to today and they're like holy\n can you please do an episode on\nthat so that we can have this to listen\nto forever I was like sure I'll do an\nepisode so that's how we got here uh\nside note if you're interested in\nlearning more about mindset meary\nUniversity which is like my weekly Zoom\nCommunity uh and much more just email me\nRob robob dial.com and uh we can chat\nabout it um but when you look at it in\nin what I dove into with everybody is is\nlooking at rejection itself whenever I\nlook at something I try to actually pull\napart what that thing actually is okay\nand so when you look at the the fear of\nrejection okay when you look at the fear\nof rejection if we're afraid of being\nrejected what is the opposite of\nrejection the opposite of rejection is\nacceptance which means that we are\nafraid of\nrejection which means that we actually\nwant to be accepted so what you're\nsearching for for the fear of rejection\nis showing us what you're searching for\nis actually acceptance being accepted\nbut here is where it starts to get\nreally crazy and starts to take a turn\nyou might not think of okay when you're\nlooking out into the world and you're\nsearching for acceptance of other people\nso when you're you're afraid of being\nrejected that means that you're\nsearching for acceptance from other\npeople with me so far that makes sense\nwhy is acceptance important why is it\nimportant for you this year this day and\nage not being a tribal person why is it\nimportant for you to be accepted by\nother people do you want to know why\nhere's the reason why you're searching\nin other people what you're actually\nwanting from\nyourself what you're searching for from\nother people the acceptance that you're\nsearching for from other people the love\nthat you're searching for from other\npeople is actually because you don't\ntruly fully 100% love and accept\nyourself and so you're searching instead\nof instead of being aware of this and\ntrying to get it from yourself what\nyou're doing is you're trying to get it\nfrom other people which is basically\njust like pouring water into a holeless\nbucket like it's just a whole filled\nbucket it's just going to be coming out\nyou're not going to be able to actually\nfill yourself up with other people's\nlove if you don't actually love and\naccept yourself first okay so let's take\na a step back from that so if we go okay\nI have the fear of rejection why do I\nhave the fear of rejection because I\nwant to be accepted why do I want to be\naccepted from other people because I\nactually want to be accepted for myself\nso then we ask oursel why don't we\naccept ourselves right why don't we\naccept ourselves you don't accept\nyourself and you don't love yourself\nfully because you don't want to accept\nwhat you're not all right here's where\nwe start going deep I told you we were\ngoing to right you your true self does\nnot want to accept what you are not and\nso let me explain what I mean by this\nwhen you were a child have you ever seen\na child like a 2-year-old three-year-old\nchild when you were a child you were\nyour full self you were loud you were\nfun you would walk around naked you\ndidn't care what anybody thought about\nyou you did not give a damn about what\nanybody thought about\nyou so where did you start actually\ncaring right we all came into this world\nnot caring about what other people think\nof us and then somewhere along the way\nit was programmed into us that we need\nto care about what other people think\nabout us right and then take a wild\nguess who do you think the first people\nwe developed this relationship with was\nwere I guess you could say where we\nactually cared about this person wanting\nto accept US ah yes correct your parents\nand so because your parents need to\nsocialize children cuz all parents need\nto socialize children so that they fit\nin with Society\nuh or as I like to call it instead of\nsocializing them we domesticate children\nit's part of all of our processes of\ngrowing up and learning to fit in so we\nlearn not to be loud we learn don't take\nyour clothes off we learn don't touch\nthat we learn be quiet we learn every\nsingle piece of who we're supposed to be\nin the way that most parents do this\nsadly is through reprimanding children\nso the average child is reprimanded\neight times more than they're praised\nwhich means the average cons average U\nchild subconsciously thinks to themsel\nthere's something wrong with me eight\ntimes more than they think there's\nsomething right with me and obviously\nthis is unconsciously a child's not\nconsciously sitting there thinking in\ntheir mind there's something wrong with\nme they're just knowing that eight times\nmore they're doing things wrong eight\ntimes more than they're doing things\nright and because we follow our parents\nand we follow people older than us we\nbuild oursel into something in someone\nto be accepted by them this is what we\ncall your conditioned self and so now we\nstart to look at the two different\nversions of yourself so there is your\ntrue self which is who you were as a\nchild the things that you like to do the\ntoys you like to play with the being\nloud the doing all the stuff that you\ndid that was your true self how you came\ninto this world and then over time you\ndeveloped your condition self which is\nthe set of programs that were taught to\nrun through our parents through Society\nthis is how you're supposed to act this\nis how you're not supposed to act this\nis how you're supposed to talk this is\nhow you're not supposed to talk this how\nyou're supposed to dress everything so\nyou have two different versions of\nyourself right you have your true self\nand then you also have your conditioned\nself and so who you learn that you were\nsupposed to be who you're supposed like\nsupposed to be in in that case is\nbasically your condition self but this\nis where the problem lies this is who\nyou've become and this is why\nit's hard for you to love and accept\nyourself because you're trying to get\nyour true self which still exists inside\nof you there's still that little kid\ndeep down inside of you that is who you\ntruly are you're trying to get your true\nself to love and accept your conditioned\nself but your true self deep down inside\nof you subconsciously knows this is not\nwho I am this is what I've been told to\nbe this is what I've been told to do\nwith my life some people are conditioned\nway past childhood and they're condition\ninto this is what you need to go to\nschool for this is what you need to go\nto college for this is what you need to\ndo as your job and some people are still\nbeing conditioned by their parents at 20\n30 years old and so the the problem here\nand the reason why you have a fear of\nrejection is not because of anybody else\nit's because the internal battle between\nthe two sides of you it's your true self\nnot accepting your conditioned self and\nso what do we do we search for\nacceptance outside of us from other\npeople being like please just accept me\nplease love me cuz I don't know who the\n I am and so that's what we do we\nsearch for that acceptance from other\npeople you mold yourself into someone\nelse if you think about like think about\nmiddle school for instance right I don't\nknow about middle school for you but\nevery person that I talk to myself\nincluded middle school is like hell\nchildren are vicious and so we learn and\nmold oursel like I remember Middle\nSchool like we didn't have any money and\nI remember that was like the time when\nchildren you know 10 11 12 13 year old\nkids were starting to like Tommy\nhillfigure and I was like too poor to\nhave it we used to shop it like TJ Maxx\nand you know all of that and I was like\nI can't we couldn't afford that stuff\nand then so kids would make fun of me\nfor not wearing Like the quote unquote\ncool clothes so I thought there was\nsomething wrong with me like how many\ntimes has that happened over and over\nagain in our childhood where we're\nconditioned by our parents then we get\nolder and we go to school and we start\nto be conditioned by other kids at\nschool we're conditioned in middle\nschool then we get to high school and\nhigh school is fun for some people it's\nreally hard for other people and you\nbecome someone a lot of times to fit in\nso it's like you're conditioned by your\nparents and then you start conditioning\nyourself based off of who you want to\nfit in with and you try to start fitting\nin and by fitting in means that you're\nactually changing your true self so now\nyou're 20 you're 30 you're 60 years old\nand you don't truly love and accept\nyourself because you don't know who the\n you are anymore and so you search\nfor that love in other people and you\nhope that they will show you some\nacceptance sometimes we become a\nchameleon we act this way around this of\npeople you act this this way on this set\nof people but what you're truly\nsearching for out of all of this and the\nreason why you have the fear of\nrejection is because you truly are\nsearching for the love and acceptance\nfrom yourself you want to ReDiscover who\nyou truly\nare and to stop be this stop being this\nperson who you have been quote unquote\nconditioned or built into\nbeing but your true self will never love\nand accept your conditioned self why\nbecause because it's a character you're\nplaying it's not who you truly are and\nso your true self deep down inside that\nlittle child that's been waiting for you\nto come and ReDiscover it for years is\nsaying this is not who I am that person\nthat you're playing that character that\nyou're playing that role that you're\nplaying is not who I am and so we don't\nknow this like I would assume most\npeople have never actually thought this\nbefore and so we we feel a void within\nourselves and to try to fill that void\nwe go and try to some get somebody else\nto fill that void right like if you hear\npeople say oh it's my better half no no\nno it shouldn't be half of you and half\nof another person it should be your full\nself to a relationship and someone\nelse's full self to relationship\notherwise you're building a relationship\nof half and half uh and F fitting and\nmolding yourself into who that person\neither wants you to be or who you want\nyourself to who you think that you need\nto be and so it's a character that we've\nbuilt up over\nyears so what the do we do right\nwhat do you do so okay damn I guess this\nkind of make sense Rob I guess it kind\nof makes sense that I've lost my true\nself if I'm searching for my love and\nacceptance from other people and it's\nreally just love and acceptance I'm\nsearching for myself what do I do what\nthe hell do I do and you're not going to\nhave like you're not I'm I'm sorry but\nyou're not going to leave today's\nepisode and be like I've got it all\nfigured out because what really what you\nneed to do is use today's episode to\nReDiscover who you truly are to start\ngoing on the path of rediscovering who\nyou truly are and sometimes there's\nthings that are obvious to you oh my\ngosh and I was a kid I used to love to\ndo this you know what I want I haven't\ndone in a really long time I used to\nlove doing this sometimes it is a little\nbit obvious and sometimes it's not\nalways obvious sometimes it's very very\nsubtle and that's why it's like you're\nnot going to have it figured out by the\nend of this episode it's going to be\nhaving the awareness building the\nawareness of like who Am I who do I\ntruly who's my who do I truly want to be\nwhat's my inner child calling for you\nknow if you think of like yourself as a\nchild what were you like what were you\nlike as a child were you loud were you\noutgoing were you calm were you quiet\nwhen you see videos of me as a child\nlike I usually just was sitting there\nand I didn't I didn't say a whole lot of\nwords right and so like yeah there's\ndefinitely times where I can sit up here\nand I can I can talk and public speaking\nis one of my favorite things to do in\nthe world but majority of the time I'm\nnot talking I'm sitting I'm quiet I've\njust kind of rediscovered my quiet self\nso when you look at videos of yourself\nas a child what were you like what were\nyour hobbies when you were a kid what\ndid you love to do did you do dancing\ndid you did you paint did you build\nthings with your hands did you play\nsports did you play with Legos and what\nyou really need to do is start\nrediscovering and building the awareness\nof your childhood self because that's\nwho you truly are that's still inside of\nyou it's really sad that that little\nchild has just been sitting there in a\ncorner waiting for you to come back for\ndecades and to do the things that you\ntruly love to do now am I saying that\nyou need to just become a child and play\nwith you know Plato all day and quit\nyour job no that's not what I'm saying\nbut what I'm saying is can you take that\nlittle version of yourself the true self\nand start to integrate it into your\nadult self can there be a world where\nyour adult self is integrated with your\nchildhood self and you can just have\nsome freaking fun stop being so serious\nall the time and do the things that you\nlove think about the things that you\nlove to do before you were told who you\nshould be what else can you do you can\nask your parents you know like for me\none of the things that that was really\ninteresting for me that I I don't even\nremember if I'm being truly honest with\nyou but I had a conversation with my mom\nand we were talking about when I was a\nkid and uh when we lived in a duplex\nwhen I was a kid uh it was me it was my\nmom it was my dad and it was my sister\nmy sister though was always six years\nolder than me and so when she became a\nteenager obviously a teenager and her\nlittle brother that's six years older or\nsix years younger um don't really share\nrooms and so my my mom and dad had a\nroom and then my sister had a room and I\nslept on the couch so I never actually\nhad a room until I was about 13 14 years\nold um and so I didn't really have a\nroom and uh one of the things my mom\ntold me that I completely forgot about\nis we used to have a front porch that\nwas screened in and instead of sleeping\non the couch in the in the living room a\nlot of times what I would do is at night\nI would go outside and I would sleep\noutside on the couch that we had that\nwas inside of the covered area and\ninside of the screened area and I didn't\neven remember it much until it was\nbrought to my awareness and my mom was\nlike used to love sleeping outside and\nmy sister was like used to love sleeping\noutside and I was like I forgot how\nmuch I loved being outside and then I\nstarted looking at my surroundings and I\nwas like wait I live in downtown Austin\nin a\ncondo that's not really the surroundings\nthat I like like I love downtown Austin\nI love being there but I can't go\noutside and be in nature immediately and\nput my feet on the ground in the grass\nand then so when we moved into the house\nwe have now we moved into a house with\nthree acres I can't see anybody's\nanybody else's house from my house and\nit feels more like me and it was\ninteresting cuzz when we moved into the\nhouse there was like a little bit of\ntension that was just kind of there that\njust kind of slowly disappeared and I\nwas like man it's because I'm\nrediscovering these things that I truly\nlove that I completely forgot about and\nthat came because I had a conversation\nwith my mom and that reminded me of it\nso maybe you have a conversation with\nyour mom and start to figure out who you\nused to be and what you used to do and\njust start to ReDiscover and see if\nthere's some hobbies that you loved or\nmaybe some Hobbies you want to pick up\nand I'm going to say this it's not an\novernight thing this is like a a rest of\nyour life type of thing this is a\nrediscovery when you discover something\nyou're trying to discover something you\nhave to go on a journey for it so it's\nabout building the awareness of the\nreason why I'm afraid of being accepted\nafraid of rejection and why I care so\nmuch about other people's opinions is\nbecause I'm searching for Acceptance in\nthem and then I'm searching the\nacceptance that I'm actually searching\nfor in them is the acceptance that I'm\nsearching for myself and my true self is\nnot accepting my conditioned self and so\nthe natural path is to go Who Am I who\nis my true self what what do I love what\ndo I want to do and you start to go on\nthis path of rediscovery because always\nwhat you're searching for outside of you\nis actually what you're always searching\nfor inside of you and so that's why\nyou're afraid of rejection that's why\nyou care so much about other people's\nopinions because really what you're\nsearching for is what you want from\nyourself so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on Instagram\nstories and tag me in at robd Jr r o b d\ni a l Jr also if you love this
