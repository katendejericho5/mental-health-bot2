    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the\nconsequences the positive consequences\nand the negative consequences of\neverything that you do because time\nalways catches up and if you take the\nright action you're going to have\nconsequences that you really like if you\nhave the wrong action you're going to\nhave consequences you don't really like\nso let's dive in we tend not to think of\nthe long-term consequen of not working\nout we tend to think of not think of the\nlong-term consequences of building the\nbusiness that we want to or waking up\nearly to put more time into our\nself-development we tend to try to\navoid the negative conse let me say this\nwe TR tend to try to avoid thinking\nabout the negative consequences in life\nand so you know I always say like the\nthe negative consequences of our actions\nare always just a little bit out of the\nside of our view right it's like for\nthose of you guys that can't see the\nvideo it's like my fist is over here to\nthe right and I'm always looking over to\nthe left and it's like so often it's\nlike our negative consequences are right\nthere they're just out of sight and we\ntry not to look at them we try to act\nlike everything's going to be okay if I\ndon't take care of myself everything's\ngoing to be okay if I don't build my\nbusiness everything's ever going to be\nokay if I don't start working on my\npersonal development and really what\nwe're trying to do is we're trying to\ntake our head and then just turn it and\nlook directly at those consequences\nbecause what we tend to do is we tend to\nthink about the negative consequences of\nfollowing the life that we want we tend\nthink about the negative consequences of\nwhat it is that we want versus what it\nis that we don't want we tend to think\nof all of the negative consequences of\ndoing the thing that we actually truly\nwant to do with our life and we tend to\nthink of all the positive consequences\nof not doing what we want to do and so I\nI'll kind of break down what this means\nif you're like what the hell is this guy\ntalking about we're going to dive into\nit and but we don't send tend to to\nfocus on the negative consequences that\nare just right there and we're trying\nnot to pay attention to them the\nnegative consequences of not taking\naction of staying in mediocrity all of\nthat and I want to take a step back\nbefore we go any further and I want you\nto to realize that whenever you say yes\nto something anything you are\nautomatically saying no to something\nelse so whenever you say yes to sleeping\nin you're saying no to having a morning\nroutine or in you know going for a rhyme\nyou're saying no to reading those books\nin the morning and working on your\npersonal development so whenever you say\nyes to anything you are automatically\nsaying no to something else and so\nyou've got to start thinking about that\nwhen I'm saying yes to something when\nI'm saying yes I'm going to sit on the\ncouch and watch Netflix for 4 hours what\nam I saying no to you're saying no to a\nlot of other things so you know when\nyou're saying yes to watching the\nNetflix you're saying no to building\nyour business or you're saying no to\ncreating the wealth for yourself and for\nfor your family you're saying no to the\npeople whose lives you could change by\nyour business existing and so you have\nto understand that with every yes\nthere's also a no just the way that it\ngoes see what we tend to focus on though\nis relaxing or hanging out or\ndowntime oh I'm going to focus on some\nme time and then you sit and watch\nNetflix and trash TV for four hours\nright there's nothing wrong with hanging\nout with watching Netflix with\ndecompressing there's nothing wrong with\nthat but there's always consequences to\neverything that we do and there's also\nconsequences to everything that we don't\ndo and so if you are planning on you\nknow being really productive today but\nyou decide to sit on the couch and watch\nNetflix well there's negative\nconsequences that come with that and we\ntend not to we TR tend not to try to\nthink about those negative consequences\nyou know if you're saying yes to\nsleeping in you're saying no to a\nmorning routine you're saying no to\nmorning yoga you're saying no to morning\nmeditation you're saying no to to\nstarting that new book that you just\nbought you're saying no to journaling\nand getting to know yourself on a deeper\nlevel and life is full of consequences\nthere's positive consequences and\nthere's negative consequences with every\nsingle action that you do or do not take\nin life there's always consequences and\ntime will always catch up to you I say\nthis all the time but time is either\nyour best friend or your greatest enemy\nand as you fast forward 5 years 10 years\n20 years from today you're going to find\nout if you took the right actions today\nor if you didn't and so when you start\nto look at it and you say okay well yeah\nare there are there quote unquote\nnegative consequences to building my\nbusiness yeah it's it's going to take a\nlot from you right to to build their the\nthe business are there positive\nconsequences yeah but which ones are you\nfocusing on right so what are the\nconsequences of of building my business\nwell uh creating wealth for myself\ncreating Freedom are a couple positive\nconsequences what else doing something\nthat I love that makes me feel good that\nis fulfilling for me okay that's a\npositive consequence um working for\nmyself and not having to have anybody\nelse tell me what to do that's a\npositive consequence what else are\npositive consequences time Freedom um\nlocation Freedom being able to travel\nwhenever I want and not have to put PTO\ntime in doing what I want when I want\nwith who I want those are the positive\nconsequences of me putting my head down\ntaking the right action and building my\nbusiness are there negative consequences\nto it absolutely and that's usually what\nwe tend to focus on we tend to focus on\noh God I got to work so hard to build\nthis business oh I got to be I got to be\ndedicated oh no I've got to get out of\nmy comfort zone I've got to face\nrejection I got to go try to sell my\nproduct where people are going to say no\nto my face those are some negative\nconsequences I got to I got to face all\nof my insecurities CU as building a\nbusiness all of your insecurities are\ngoing to come up to the surface and so\nare there are there negative\nconsequences yeah are there positive\nconsequences yeah but what do we tend to\ndo that that stops us from taking action\nis we tend to spend all of our time\nfocusing on the negative consequences oh\nmy God what if somebody says no to me oh\nI don't want to get out of my comfort\nzone I don't want to work hard today I\ndon't want all of my insecurity to come\nto the surface and our brain gets\nfocused on that thing and doesn't think\nabout anything else it doesn't think\nabout the wealth it doesn't think about\nthe freedom it doesn't think about not\nhaving to work for someone else it\ndoesn't think about being able to do\nwhat I want when I and with who I want\nno it just thinks about all of the\nnegative consequences and when we're\nconstantly thinking about the negative\nconsequences is it going to be hard for\nus to take action yeah because the only\nthing that you're thinking about is the\n that you don't want to be doing\nyou're like I don't want to do any of\nthese things and so what do we do we\nfocus on the negative and then what\nhappens we end up not getting the life\nthat we want cuz we don't take any\naction so what are the consequences of\nnot building my business well same old\nlife nothing changed I have to work for\nsomeone else forever uh maybe I don't\nfeel fulfilled and I don't have the life\nthat I want maybe not creating wealth\nfor myself and for my family and being\nable to put my children in a uh better\nschools being able to pay for their\ncollege yeah those are some those are\nsome consequence of not building my\nbusiness and so it's it's it's good for\nyou to understand that there's always\npositive consequences there's always\nnegative consequences but if you're\ngoing to take action towards building\nthe life that you want you've got to\nstart focusing more on the positive\nversus thinking about the negative\ndoesn't mean the negative doesn't exist\nyou're still going to have to work hard\nyou're still going to have to wake up\nearly you're still going to have to get\nrejection and face rejection all day\nevery single day but you're doing it\nbecause you're constantly focusing on on\nthe end result that you're trying to get\nto the life that you're trying to build\nfor\nyourself let's give you another example\nare there um are there consequences to\ncreating a healthy lifestyle are there\npositive consequences to creating a\nhealthy lifestyle whether that be eating\nhealthier uh working out more going for\nruns more breaking a sweat more often\nare there positive consequences to that\nyeah you might be able to live longer\nthere's a pretty good chance you'll live\nlonger if you if you have a healthier\nlifestyle right right so you'll live\nlonger you'll be healthier you'll have\nmore energy you'll have more mobility in\nyour old age as you get older so if\nyou're 25 years old you don't really\ncare about your Mobility but as you\nstart getting 40 45 50 60 you can start\nto see oh man I should have worked out a\nlittle bit more I should have done some\nmore stretching should have done some\nmore yoga they always catch up time they\nalways catch up and you always think you\nhave more time that's the crazy part\nabout it so those are some of the\npositive consequences of a healthy\nlifestyle I guarantee everybody listen\nthis podcast wants to be healthy but we\nusually don't focus on the positive and\nthat the positive consequences what do\nwe focus on we focus on the negative\nconsequences of being healthier are\nthere negative consequences yeah there's\nreally hard work there's dedication\nthey're saying no to eating the food\nthat we would normally enjoy you know\nlike it's a bag of Hot Cheetos yeah that\n tastes really good doesn't it but\nit's full of fat it ain't good for you\nit's not real food that's IM\nfood so those are some negative\nconsequences waking up earlier so you\nhave time to go for a run working out\nwhatever it might be sweating GH having\nto take a shower after you work out so\nyou have less time because you got to\ntake more showers are there negative\nconsequences yeah there's a laundry list\nof negative consequences and that's what\nwe tend to focus on as humans we tend to\nfocus on all of the negative\nconsequences uh it's just what humans do\nI've been studying humans for a really\nlong time and working with humans and\ntrying to figure them out and reading\nbooks on them and we tend to focus on\nthe negative more than the positive it's\njust a natural tendency of humans now\nthe reason why we focus on the negative\nis because we want to avoid any\npotential threats coming into into our\nfuture so we focus on the negative so\nthe reason why people love trash reality\nTV is because it's so negative and your\nbrain just gets attached to it so when\nwe look at the the the healthy lifestyle\nagain are there consequences long-term\nconsequences to to not creating a\nhealthy lifestyle yeah for sure and\nthat's what we don't pay attention to\nusually there's there we tend to pay\nattention to the negative consequences\nright now which make us not take action\nwe don't pay attention to the negative\nconsequences in the future so what are\nthe negative consequences of not living\na healthy lifestyle not living as long\nnot looking as good as you could less\nenergy as you get older which will\npermeate into other parts of your life\ninto your relationships into your work\num maybe not being able to play with\nyour grandkids as you get get older not\nbeing as mobile yeah of course there's\nalways negative and there's always\npositive consequences to every single\nthing that you do there is no way around\nit but really what it is is what are you\nfocusing on and what are you what are\nyou taking action on because we like to\nturn a blind eye to the negative\nconsequences of our actions or lack of\naction we like to act like it's not\ngoing to catch up to us we like to act\nlike if I don't go to the gym if I don't\neat healthy if I don't do what I need to\ndo it's not going to catch up to me but\nwe all know in the back of our heads I'm\n in the future if I don't do this\nbut we're like oh I'm not going to pay\nattention to it you got to pay attention\nto it you've got to start being driven\ninstead of by your short-term fears\nyou've got to be driven by your\nlong-term fears and it's harder because\nit's not in this moment it might be 5\nyears down the road it might be 10 years\nmight be 20 years down the road but it's\ngot to drive you to take the action that\nyou need to to create the life that you\nwant whether that's the business you\nwant the family that you want the body\nthat you want the health that you want\nyou've got to start paying attention to\nthe consequences they're there they're\nright under your nose if you're looking\nlooking for\nbecause we like to turn a blind eye to\nall of the negative consequences of our\nactions or our lack of actions but it\ndoesn't mean that they're not there\nthey're still there whether we look at\nthe negative consequence or not they\nwill still always be there and you've\nheard me say it over and over again life\nis either hard now and easy later or\neasy now and hard later like this\nmorning I woke\nup had my trainer came over did a\nfreaking workout with him he kicked my\nass was it hard now yeah but why am I\ndoing it because I want to live longer I\nwant to have an extra 20 years I want to\nbe mobile later on in life I don't want\nto be one those hunched over old people\nthat can barely move around and so I'm\nchoosing hard now so that my life can be\neasier later because if I choose easy\nnow and I don't have a trainer and I\ndon't have somebody to work out with and\nI don't go to the gym and I don't eat\nhealthy it's going to be hard later and\nit's going to be hard later for longer\nthan it was hard now that's what's crazy\nabout it it's it's going to be hard\neither way but we get to choose our hard\nwe get to choose which one we decide\nthat we want to have we can't act like\nwe're the victim of our circumstances\nyou're never a victim of any of your\ncircumstances where you are right now is\nnot your parents fault it's not the\neconomy's fault it's not the president's\nfault it's not the wall Street's fault\nand the ups and the downs and all of\nthat we can we can try to external blame\nas much as possible but where you are\nright now is the fault of the version of\nyou 6 months ago a year ago two years\nago and the actions that that version of\nyou did or did not take so if you look\naround and you're like hey my life is\npretty awesome and it's great well that\nmeans that you made some hard decisions\nand took some hard actions in the past\nthat created a great easier life now but\nif you look around and life is kind of\nhard and you don't like where you are\nI'm sorry to tell you it's because of\nwhat you did or didn't do in the\npast that being said success leaves\nClues if I'm looking at my life and I'm\nsaying oh man I don't really like where\nI am I didn't take enough hard I didn't\nmake enough hard decisions in the past\nwhat am I going to do I'm going need to\ntake some hard make some hard decisions\nnow I'm gonna have to do some hard\nactions now I'm G to take some action\nnow I'm gonna have to do what I need to\ndo in order to make my life easier we\nhave to realize you have to realize I\nhave to realize we all have to realize\nwe have to realize that our actions\ncreate our\ncircumstance it does it always does and\nso you've got to ask yourself what are\nthe consequences of the actions that\nyou're\ntaking and you've got to really start to\nthink about them what are the positive\nconsequences and what are the negative\nconsequences and then you ask yourself\nif I fast forward 10 years what's my\nlife going to look like if I continue\ndoing XYZ and if you like what it's\ngoing to look like do it if you don't\nchange it do something different because\nthere's always consequences either way\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on
