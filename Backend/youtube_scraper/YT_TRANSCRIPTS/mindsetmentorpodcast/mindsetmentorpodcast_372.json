    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to talk about how to get really\nclear on exactly what it is that you\nwant in your life because if you can get\nvery clear on what is that you want in\nyour life you're more likely to work\ntowards it to get it to Vision it and to\nactually take action towards it let's\ndive in today we're going to be cussing\nso if you don't like cussing this ain't\nyour episode uh today we're going to be\ntalking about what the do you want\nlike what do you actually want in your\nlife what do you want I feel like it's\nlike uh what is it the notebook where\nit's like what do you want\nI feel like I I feel like part of my\nlife when I coach people is like what do\nyou want and they're like I don't know\nwhat I want I'm like what do you want\nright they never get really really clear\non what it is that you want it's crazy\nto me how many people don't truly\nactually know what it is that they want\nin their life a lot of them know what\nthey don't want I'm very clear on that\nlike they get very clear I don't want\nthis I don't want this I don't want this\nI'm like what do you want I just I want\nto make more money and and and have like\na nice house and that's about all of\ntheir vision and then then they get mad\nthat they don't have the life that they\nwant because they never actually get\nreally clear what the life that they\nwant is right it's like if you look back\nit's crazy to me when I look back\nthrough all of these ancient texts I\nlove reading all of these ancient texts\nbecause a lot of them say pretty much\nthe same things and one of the things is\nthat that you see consistently is\nsomething along the lines of asking you\nshall receive which basically means get\nreally clear on what it is that you want\nand then go out and get it right or ask\nfor it but it's like you if you're going\nto ask for you got to be clear on\nexactly what is that you want and and so\nso many people just don't get really\nclear on the life that they want to have\nand then they're mad that the life that\nthey have is not the life that they want\nbut it's because they didn't get clear\non exactly what is that they want and so\nyou have to find out and get very clear\non what it is that you want so that you\ncan decide what you don't want to do\nwhat you don't want to be how you need\nto change what actions you need to stop\ntaking or start taking and when you\ndecide and you've heard me say it over\nand over and over again this podcast the\nroot word for the word decide comes from\ndeader which actually means to cut off\nso you can cut off all other options cut\noff all of the version versions of you\nthat are in the way of holding you back\nfrom curring the life that you want so\nwhat do you want because most people\nhave an idea but they don't have a\nreally clear concise of this is exactly\nwhat I'm going to be getting in my life\nand it's crazy if you were to when we\nget done with today's podcast if you\nwere to take 20 minutes on your phone\nand just just put 20 minutes on your\nphone take out a pen and paper and say\nwhat do I want in my life and make sure\nthat you are as clear and concise as\npossible you'll be like okay I've got a\ngreat vision for what I'm trying to go\ndo but you've got to be very clear and\nconcise not I want to make more money\ntell me exactly how much money you want\nto make tell me how much you want to\nmake how you're going to make it how\nmuch you want to save how much you want\nto invest how much you want to be worth\nwhat you want your assets to look like\nwhen you say I want to lose weight\nthat's not that's not clear and concise\nbut it's like how much how much do you\nwant to weit what do you want to weigh\neverything and the main reason why why\npeople don't really get clear on what\nthey want is be why they don't really\nhave the life they want is because\nthey're not clear on what it is that\nthey want and so when you can sit down\nand actually write with pen and paper\nand make it real and physical and exist\nin this world it makes it so much easier\nto go okay I've got this now now let me\nmake a plan but if you don't have an\nidea of exactly what you want you're not\ngoing to be able to come up with any\nplan of exactly how you're going to get\nthere so what do you want in your life\nwhat's the reason why you're on this\nplanet right when you when you die how\ndo you want to be\nremembered when you're born you know\nwhat you want when you're hungry you cry\nwhen you're in pain you cry whenever you\nwant something you cry because you want\nto get it so you know how to you know\nwhat you want when you're younger but\nwhat happened along the way well\nsomewhere along the way as you were\ngrowing up it happens to basically all\nof us right somebody said to you as you\ngot older stop being so selfish or you\ncan't do that or be realistic oh you\nwant to be president no one in this\nfamily's even graduated college you're\nnot going to become president you can't\ndo that oh you want to be an\nastronaut you can't be an astronaut oh\nyou want to be a successful business\nowner nobody in this family's ever had a\nbusiness before you come from a bad part\nof town you're you're you come from a\nbunch of poor people we're always going\nto be poor whatever it is so we have\nthis very uh innate belief in oursel\nWhen We're Young because there's no\nreason not to believe in yourself and\nthen at some point in time it is\ndeprogrammed it is programmed out of us\nand this is your\nlife it is this is the life that you\nhave and maybe there's more lives after\nthis maybe there's reincarnation maybe\nthere's not maybe there's a heaven maybe\nthere's not maybe we come more warm food\nmaybe we don't maybe we get other lives\nI don't know I don't know and I don't\npretend to act like I know and anybody\nwho does pretend to act like they know\nprobably doesn't know cuz they've never\nactually gone through it right but this\nis what I do know and what you know is\nthat you are here and you do have this\nlife and so what I do want you to\nunderstand is you need to stop living\nsomeone else's dream not even someone\nelse's dream you need to stop living\nwhat someone else told you to live and\nto do what is that you truly want you\nknow people say get a real job maybe you\nwanted to have this amazing career and\nbe a a painter or a musician and your\nmom and dad was like no no no you should\ndo something different oh you're very\nartsy honey but you're not going to make\nany money doing that you should go to\nschool and be an engineer and how many\nparents did this to their children and\ntold them what to go to school for what\nschools to go to and and what job to\ntake and all of that and and and really\nmore than anything else we do it a lot\nof times to please them or they want you\nto do this so that they don't get\nembarrassed saying oh my son is an\nartist uh and not a doctor whatever it\nmight be but then you start to realize\nthat I'm either living somebody else's\nlife I'm living somebody else El's dream\nor I'm living within someone else's\nlimitations and we've built a life where\nwe are actually living inside of someone\nelse's box the box that they placed Us\nin not even the Box we made for\noursel so and I I get this because your\nparents do care about you hopefully\nright majority people listening your\nparents do care about you and they want\nyou to go the safe route they want you\nto go secure route so it does make more\nsense in their minds being older you\nknow to go to college than it is to be\nan artist\nso it's a more secure route but I don't\nknow about you the thing that 2020\ntaught me more than anything else is\nthat what we thought was\nSecure wasn't secure because 35 I think\nit was 35 million people lost their job\nin like a week or two that doesn't sound\ntoo damn secure to me so the problem\nwith secure is that RAR does it I want\nto say secure I mean quote unquote\nsecure is RAR doesn't mean fulfilling\nand you know when you look at the the\njob that you do and who you work for the\ncompany that you have whatever it is is\nis it fulfilling to you when you look\nthere and you're just like oh we build\nwidgets and we sell this product does\nthat feel fulfilling to you do you feel\nlike you're making the world a better\nplace you know what would you what does\nsound fulfilling to you Alan Watts says\nyou know a great question to ask\nyourself is what would you be doing if\nmoney were no object if you just because\na lot of times what we do is we we work\njust to make money but we don't like our\njobs and then we're just following\nmoney so if we follow that out you and\nthe part the quote that I that Alan watt\nsays is you know if you work just to\nmake money and you don't like your job\nthen you're just following the money\nthen you will be doing things that you\ndon't like doing in order to keep living\nwhich is to be doing things that you\ndon't like doing and he says it's better\nto have a short life doing things that\nyou love than a long life spent in a\nmiserable way and so you've got to ask\nyourself am I living a life that's\nactually truly fulfilling to me that is\nactually what I want or am I doing what\nother people told me to do or what was\nrealistic because if you remember and\nthe reason why I say it's been\nprogrammed out of you to quote unquote\nbe realistic and put yourself into some\nsort of boxes do you remember what it\nwas like being a kid or have you been\naround a kid recently like a\nthree-year-old you know like so many\nkids want to be a fireman they want to\nbe first female president they want to\nbe a pilot they want to be an astronaut\nvery rarely do I hear a child be like I\nwant to work a corporate job doing\nsomething that I hate never heard of a\nthree-year-old say that right they want\nto do something amazing and exciting in\nevery bit of them believes that it's\npossible but at some point in time we\nstop thinking that way we are programmed\nout of that thinking but we can program\nourselves back into that thinking and\nthe the reason why it's important to\nstart thinking this way is to to realize\nthat along the way people change their\nplans not based on personal interest but\nusually because of security quote\nunquote security\nbut then they end up living a life\nthat's unlived and that's why the number\none regret of people who are dying\naccording to the book The Five regrets\nof the dying is that I wish I lived a\nlife that was true to myself and not the\nlife that other people expected of me I\nlike to follow like Tony Robin says\nsuccess leaves Clues well failure also\nleaves Clues as well and so if we can\nlook at people who got to the end of\ntheir life and they knew that it was\nending and they have these regrets and\nthe number one regret of those people\nwas I wish I lived a life that was true\nto myself and not the life that other\npeople expected of me I don't know about\nyou but I look at that and I go\nthat I'm not doing that I'm going to\nlive the life that I want to live\nbecause that's their regret I don't want\nthat to be my regret success leaves\nClues well failure also leaves Clues as\nwell there's a lot of unhappy people out\nthere because they go the route that\ntheir family tells them to go or they\nthey go the route that they think\nSociety thinks that we should go and\nthen 10 20 years down the road they\nrealized that it's not direction that\nmade them fulfilled and they wake up\nthey're 45 years old they 50 years old\nand they think what the have I been\ndoing with my life right that's what a\nmidlife crisis is so I ask you what do\nyou want don't listen to this podcast\nepisode just go to the next one take\ntime ask yourself the question If Money\nwere No Object what would you do with\nyour time what's your passion what is it\nthat that would make you feel fulfilled\nthat would make you feel like that\nyou're doing something great in this\nworld you know if you can if you can\nfigure out that could you figure out a\nway to make it your profession cool you\nprobably could your passion doesn't\nalways have to be your profession you\nknow your profession can make you some\nmoney but it gives you more time to\nfollow your passion and so maybe your\npassion can be your paycheck maybe your\npassion doesn't have to be your paycheck\nbut you get a paycheck and you spend\nyour time doing that and when you get\nout of it you spend the majority of your\ntime outside of it actually following\nyour passion so what do you want do you\nwant to travel do you want to backpack\nEurope I quit my job in\n2012 and I saved up for an entire year\nyear and I was 26 years old and in 2012\nI backpacked Europe for 3 months I went\nall over the place and it was the most\nlife-changing best thing that I've ever\ndone it gave me so much Clarity in my\nlife I would not do what I do now had I\nnot had this three months alone there\nwas a lot of moments Al I think that\neverybody should take a solo trip\nsomewhere at some point in time in their\nlife doesn't have to be 3 months it\ncould be 10 days but when you get that\nalone time with yourself and you get to\nthink and you get to process you get to\nbe away from\neverything else you know I quit my job\nand I went around and I went to I went\nwent to to 25 different cities that were\ninside of Europe in three months and all\nover the place I got really clear on\nwhat is that I wanted and I was like I\ndon't want to I I want to have my own\nbusiness I want it to be online I want\nto be location independent so that I can\ndo this traveling because I'm obsessed\nwith this traveling thing and what's\ncrazy about it is when the whole year\nleading up to going and actually uh\ntraveling and going to Europe not one\nperson told me it was a bad idea it was\nwild I thought there would be so many\npeople be like Rob but you're so\nsuccessful at such a young age why are\nyou doing this not one person said I\ndon't think you should do it everyone\nsaid one of two things either number one\nI wish I would have done that when I was\nyounger or number two I did that and it\nwas the best decision of my\nlife cuz most people go the sensible\nroute they go sensible route and they\nnumb their own desires and they don't go\nand do the things that they want maybe\nit's traveling that you want maybe it's\nstarting a foundation I don't know what\nit is but it's it's really going to be\ndifferent for every person listening\nthis\nepisode but do you actually know what\nthe hell you\nwant you know stop saying I don't know\nand start figuring it out if you don't\nknow at this very moment well then spend\nevery morning while you drink your\ncoffee not on your phone not talking to\nsomeone else but journaling what do I\nwant in my life remember I was listening\nto a uh really really old speech and uh\na lady stood up and she said she said\nhow do I know what I want like I know\nabout manifesting I know about the\nuniverse but I don't know what it is\nthat I want how do I find it and the\nperson who was speaking um can't\nremember who it was that I was listening\nto said wake up every single morning and\nsay out loud I want to know what I want\nand I was like holy that's so\nsimple and it's so profound if you don't\nknow what is that you want wake up every\nsingle morning and say I want to know\nwhat I want I want to know what I want\nand you start setting your sights on\nthat thing and eventually you'll figure\nout what it is that you want this is\nyour life and it is ending one minute at\na time you deserve to have everything\nthat you want in this life you deserve\nto be happy you deserve to be successful\nwealthy joyful full of love and\ncompassion but if you follow your heart\nwhat's really interesting is that the\nmoney will usually follow too if you set\nyour s sites on money it will make it\nharder to make money but when you follow\nit is that you're truly passionate about\nit's really crazy is because you're so\npassionate about it it will be so easy\nto put in the Reps and to put in the\nhours towards that thing and usually\nbecause you do it so much just straight\nout of passion you end up doing a lot\nmore and because you're doing a lot more\nyou become better and because you become\nbetter you can actually figure out a way\nto make money getting it and doing that\nthing most people don't think that they\ncan make a living doing what they love\nmost people can so make a list of the 20\nthings that you love what would you do\nfor\nfree what do you just love to do and see\nif you can think of ways to make money\ndoing them like for me I'm weird in the\nsense that I love learning about people\nI love sitting and talking to people I\nlove I love talking to a person finding\nout their story and figuring out how\nthey got to be the person they are I\nlove reading books on psychology and\ntherapy and early childhood development\nI geek out on those things most people\ndon't want to read that I would do that\neven if I made I did it for I did\nit for 12 years I made no money doing it\nbasically but I just did it because I\nwas passionate about it and then one day\nI was like I'm going to start a podcast\nI feel like I'm OB I have a lot of\nknowledge that I could help people never\none day did I in my wildest dreams did I\never think it could be what it is now\nbut I was just so obsessed with it and\nthen one day I was like oh my God my\nbrain is filled with this stuff I might\nas well share it and then what you do is\nyou just literally figure out exactly\nwhat is that you want and once you\ndecide what is that you want you decide\ndead Dar to cut off there are no other\noptions you decide that you won't let\nanyone talk you out of it especially\nyourself people will tell you you're\ncrazy and they'll tell you to be\nrealistic\nfind what you want and make it your\nmission statement to find a mission\nstatement that that excites you and read\nit every single morning share your\nvision and people want to help you\nthere's a phrase that I used to always\nsay to myself uh when I first opened my\noffice as a sales manager and the\nfranchise that I owned and uh I don't\nknow where it came from but the phrase\nwas when you set yourself on fire people\nwill come to watch you burn and I love\nthat because I was like I'm going to\nfind the thing that sets me on fire and\nI'm going to share it with so so much\n passion that people are like I\nwant to be a part of that I want to see\nwhat what's going on over here I want to\nlearn from this person you know there's\na a great quote that that that I love\nthat's Henry David thorough that says\nmost people live a life of Silent\ndepression uh silent desperation and go\nto the Grave with a song still in them\nmost people live a life of Silent\ndesperation and go to the Grave with a\nsong still in\nthem don't go to the grave of the song\nStill In you another quote that I love\nthat's also close to that as well is Les\nBrown and Les Brown says the graveyard\nis the richest place on Earth because\nit's here that you'll find all of the\nhopes and dreams that were never\nfulfilled the books that were never\nwritten the songs that were never sung\nthe inventions that were never shared\nthe cures that were never discovered all\nbecause someone was too afraid to take\nthat first step to keep with the problem\nor be determined to carry out their\ndream figure out what is that you want\ndecide that you're going to do it and\ndon't let anybody talk you out of it so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram and tag me\nand at robd Jr r o d a l Jr and uh if\nyou're out there and you love
