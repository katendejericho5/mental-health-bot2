    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to build\nconsistency stay consistent and build\nmomentum when you're starting to change\nthings in your life and build a life\nthat you want to create let's dive in\nthe most underrated pieces of life and\nof success is the idea of momentum um I\ncannot tell you how many people reach\nout to me and say something along the\nlines of this Rob I need help being\nconsistent because I'm really good at\ndeciding to to set a goal in starting on\nmy goal but I almost always give up at\nsome point in time it's like 95% of\npeople have some sort of issue with\nconsistency and with once they start\ngetting momentum on their side keeping\nthat momentum going and you know if you\nare listening to this in December of\n2023 the way I like to think of this\nmoment right now is not to let your foot\noff the gas before 2024 a lot of people\nlike\nto yeah kind of take their foot off the\ngas oh it's the holidays I'm going to\nlet myself go a little bit and then in\nJanuary is when I'm really going to put\nmy foot down and start working out more\nand so they gain like 5 pounds and then\nnow they have to work off those five\npounds and that's what they lose in\nJanuary versus looking at December as a\nmoment to get a head start into next\nyear usually the way I like to look at\nit is when December hits is when I\nreally start putting my foot on the gas\nI really start making sure that I do\nwhat I need to do to set myself up to\neven be even more successful in January\nand for the the next year coming up and\nall too often what people end up doing\nis they get some sort of momentum on\ntheir side and then they just kind of\nlet their foot off the gas and all too\noften we either stop before we get that\nmomentum or right when we're starting to\nget some momentum but if we were to go\nanother week another two weeks another\nmonth is when really you start to see\nthat that the change that you're really\nsearching for starts to become easy it\nstarts become more of a habit it starts\nto become more programmed into you the\nway I like to think about about momentum\nis like pushing a car like if you've\never had a car breakdown to get the car\nmoving takes a lot like a lot to get the\ncar moving and then once you get it\nmoving it's a little bit little bit\neasier right and then you get it to a\npoint where the car is going you know 3\nor 4 miles an hour because you and\nsomeone else are pushing it and you\ndon't have to put as much effort into it\nthat's really what changed that's really\nwhat life is about is it takes a while\nto get going but once it gets going it\ngets so much easier and all too often\npeople quit before it gets to the point\nwhere it starts to feel easier and you\nknow it gets to the point where\nsometimes if you were to just let go of\nthe car it's still going to keep rolling\na little bit and you know the the way I\nlike to think about it is this is is a\ncar getting moving or also the other\nside is the what I'm trying to really\nthink about in the example that my mind\nalways goes to is like if I take a\nbowling ball and I go to the top of a\nhill and I let go of that bowling ball\nlet's say it weighs 15 lbs and 10t down\nuh the hill I put my hand out I can stop\nit it might hurt a little bit might be a\nlittle bit of of force that goes into my\nhand but I'm not going to break my hand\nif I stop it from rolling down the hill\n10 ft after it starts going but if I'm\nat the bottom of the hill and I put my\nhand out I'm breaking my hand what I'm\ntrying to do is to not stop before the\nmomentum gets in but to get that\nmomentum so that I feel the momentum on\nmy side and you know what I'm talking\nabout you've been at this some some sort\nof point in this in your life it could\nbe with working out for instance where\nyou know you you're just like you know\nwhat I'm just going to work out every\nsingle day for 30 days no no way if Anns\nbutts around it and you you start to get\na little bit of momentum on your side\nand then by day 31 day 32 it's like it\nactually feels weird not to go to the\ngym that's what you're trying to do\nwhere right now it might feel weird to\ngo to the gym it might feel foreign\nmaybe you haven't been in the gym in\nyears maybe you've never stepped in the\ngym but when you go every single day\nyour body starts to become used to it\nyour mind starts to become used to it\nand then not going ends up feeling weird\nand not like not there's there's been\ntimes in my life where I've gone 30 60\n100 days where there's some sort of\nmovement some sort of working on every\nsingle day and then I miss a day for\nsome sort of reason and I'm like I don't\neven feel right I feel like something's\noff that's what you're trying to get to\nin your life whether it's working out\nwhether it's growing your business\nwhether it's meditating whatever it\nmight be maybe it's going to bed early\nand and so you know with working out\nmaybe you don't work out right now um\nbut you know that you should you really\nwant to and you you say you know what\nfor for the month of December I'm going\nto work out every single day or maybe\nyou say January 1st I'm going to work\nout every single day for the month of\nJanuary and the first few weeks to be\nhonest with you you're going to have to\ndrag your ass to the gym you're going to\nhave to it's it's going to feel like\nforce and I like to use the word Force\nvery specifically because sometimes you\njust have to force yourself a lot of\ntimes you're not going to feel like it\nyou're not if you're searching and\nyou're waiting for motivation you're\ngoing to be searching and waiting for a\nreally long time and there's actually a\nlot of studies that been found that\nmotivation actually almost never comes\nbefore action action is usually what\nneeds to happen in order for you to\nstart feeling more motivated and so you\nknow it's like getting the car moving\nwhere you're going to have it's going to\nbe Force it's going to be a lot of\npushing it's going to take a lot of will\nin order to get yourself moving but it's\nthen after a while it starts to feel\nmore natural that is what you're\nsearching for that's when you've got the\nmomentum and that's when it becomes a\nlittle bit harder to stop and you're\ntrying to not allow yourself to stop and\nto keep that consistency going but\nwhat's going to happen is there's going\nto be a part of you that's it's we're\nalways at a battle with ourselves right\nlike like we are our worst enemies\nthat's what it comes to there's a part\nof you that really wants to work out\nthat really wants to change that really\nwants to do something there's also a\npart of you that's like I am fully\nresisting any change that you want to\nput in and so so you get to the point\nwhere you're working out for 2 or 3\nweeks you're doing really well and\nthere's another side of you that's like\ngive up stop and you know if if you've\never been in a really great workout\nroutine it can start to become addicting\nthat's what you want to get to where you\nstart to get used to you start to like\nit and so usually when you get to the\npoint of it's almost it's almost\naddicting you're almost in that flow is\nwhen the voice on the other side is\ngoing to push the hardest against you\nlike the example I was like to give when\nI think of a comfort zone like a rubber\nband right if you think of a rubber band\nif you pull it a little bit it'll kind\nof pull back but if you're really\npulling a rubber band to its uh its\nmaximum that's right there is like where\nit's really at the at the most is where\nit's actually pulling you back the most\ninto trying to get you to really go back\nto where you used to be and so your\ncomfort zone is the same where it's like\nif you're a little bit out of your\ncomfort zone there's not a whole lot of\nmental and physical resistance but when\nyou get very out of your comfort zone\nwhen you're going from never working out\nto working out 21 days in a row that's\nwhen you're at the max of your comfort\nzone and that's when it's going to try\nto pull you back in the most and that's\nwhen you've got to become aware of no\nI'm going to fight through this I'm\ngoing to keep going and and if you fight\nthrough that's when it starts to feel\nlike the car once it's moving where it's\nit's so much easier it doesn't take as\nmuch force but in the beginning yeah\nthere's going to be a lot of force so\nyou've got to search for momentum you've\ngot to always want momentum you've got\nto be aware of when the momentum's on\nyour side and to keep it going another\nexample of working out isn't isn't your\nthing would be like waking up early what\nif you are the type of person who\ndoesn't really wake up early or you want\nto wake up 2 hours early for you know\nthe first 30 days of the year is it\ngoing to be hard at first yeah your body\nis going to completely resist it even if\nyou have eight hours of sleep your\nbody's still going to be like ah yeah we\ndon't normally wake up at this time but\nthen you start getting a little bit of\nmomentum on your side it's not as\nforeign the first week might be kind of\nhard the second week it's a little bit\neasier it's not it's not as bad it gets\nyou get a little bit of mum on your side\nand then you know you go for 30 days 45\ndays 60 days you start waking up before\nyour alarm and it feels more natural\nthat's what we're searching for\nsearching for less resistance feels more\nnatural that's what we're really trying\nto get to you know if you're starting if\nyou're starting a business and you've\nnever started a business before even if\nyou have started a business before and\nyou're starting a business it's going to\nrequire you to get out of your comfort\nzone and it's going to in all honesty\ntake a lot of force in the beginning\nlike it is you forcing yourself to be\ndifferent like if you think that you're\ngoing to be the exact same person from\nrunning your business as you have been\nit's ridiculous you're going to have to\nchange you're going to have to mold\nyou're going to have to you know all of\nyour fears all of your limiting beliefs\nare going to come up I don't know if I\nget pay my bills I don't know if I'm\ngood enough for this I don't know if\nanybody would ever buy from me and so\nthere's a lot of force that you have to\ngo through is pushing the car and\ngetting it moving but then after you're\ndoing it for a few months 3 months 6\nMonths 8 months whatever it might be you\nstart to feel more natural you feel the\nmomentum on your side you could show up\nto the office and do what needs to be\ndone and not feel as much force nothing\nnew is easy at the beginning it's wild\nto me how many people think that just\njust uprooting parts of their life and\nchanging part of their life is going to\nbe easy everything at some point in time\nis a struggle so as long as you just\nknow that it's going to be hard as long\nas you just know that there's probably\ngoing to be a struggle you're not\nblindsided about it and you can figure\nout a way to work through it and go oh\nyeah that makes sense I'm I'm in the\nstruggle phase right now but you have to\nkeep going and you have to figure out a\nway to get that momentum in your side\nand to harness the momentum you know if\nyou're listening to me and your life has\nbeen stagnant for a while you have to\nget the moving process going and it will\nbe like pushing a car there will be\nForce there will be a lot of stuff that\nyou don't want to do and you don't have\nto it's this crazy thing where people\nare like well I don't believe in myself\nI'm my response to them is that you\ndon't need to believe in yourself in\norder to take action belief is not a\nprerequisite to taking action and you\nknow always try to figure out a bit way\nto be moving in action creates more\naction inaction creates more in action\nhumans we're not meant to be inactive we\nif you were to look at our I I would\nassume if I had a crystal ball and I\ncould go back 100,000 200,000 years I\nwould assume that our ancestors were\nprobably moving around a decent amount\nthroughout the day it wasn't moving\naround all day long but they weren't\nsitting down on a couch for 4 hours\nwatching Netflix doing nothing no and so\nour bodies are meant to move humans\nwe're meant to move we're meant to be\nthinking different we're meant to be\ngrowing we're either green and growing\nor brown and dying we're supposed to be\nexpanding oursel in some sort of way and\nso we've got to we've got to get a\nlittle bit of force in there and with\nthat Force we need to search for that\nmomentum you know it's like pushing the\ncar it's hard at first but then it\nstarts rolling and lots of people they\nwill get the car moving and then they\nstop and so really what it comes down to\nis once you feel that momentum you've\ngot to keep going you got to go I got\nthe momentum on my side now I'm really\nabout to break through you know and a\nlot of times people get excited the\nbeginning of something or they get a\ncase of the I deserve it oh I worked out\nevery single day for the past seven days\nI deserve to take today off or I did\nreally good on my diet for the past 14\ndays and I lost 5 pounds I deserve a\npizza I had a a great week of sales I\ncan take today off I uh I lost 10 pounds\nso I can you know go ahead and have ice\ncream for the next three days oh I made\nI made a lot of money in the past couple\nmonths I'm going to go and spend it and\nreally what it comes down to is this\nthing I wrote about it in my book it's\ncalled the emotional cycle of change\nand I put the actual diagram and the the\ngraph in my book uh level up\nspecifically because when I first saw it\nand first started learning the emotional\ncycle of change I was like this makes so\nmuch sense and there's basically five\nstages to getting to being successful\nand getting momentum on your side so\nstage one is what they call uninformed\noptimism and that's when you start\nsomething like yay new year new me I'm\ngoing to do awesome I'm going to do so\ngood at this and you're you're you're\nuninformed optimism you don't know what\nyou don't know but you're all excited\nbecause you don't know it you're like\nthis is going to be great right and then\nyou go and you do that thing for a week\nyou work out for a week and you know the\nfirst two days are exciting and fun and\nthen day three and four it's not as fun\nyou're like this kind of sucks day five\nand six you're like I don't know how I\ncan do this for 30 days whatever it is\nthat it might be and that's stage one\nwhich is uninformed optimism uninformed\noptimism very turn very closely turns\ninto stage two which is U uninformed\npessimism which is you still don't know\nwhat you don't know and you still don't\nknow but you have a little bit more of\nan idea but you're starting to see oh my\nGod this this this is going to go a lot\nlonger than I thought it was and so you\ngo from from uh uninformed optimism to\nuninformed pessimism now you're just\npessimistic you're negative and you\nwould think that that's the lowest of\nlows but it's not then you get to stage\nthree which is my favorite uh is called\nthe valley of Despair and when we end up\nin the valley of Despair that is when we\nusually quit and and if you can know\nthat everybody goes through all of these\ncycles of change stage 1 2 3 and four\nand five then you'll start to realize oh\nokay I'm in the Valley of Despair right\nnow and I've got to push through to\nsuccess I'm in the Valley of Despair\nbecause what happens is most people go\nthrough stage one stage two stage three\nand then they usually give up by stage\nthree and why do they give up on stage\nthree because they're in the valley of\nDespair they they think it's going to\ntake too long and then they look at a\nbrand new thing but they're looking at\nthat new thing Through The Eyes of stage\none which is uninformed optimism and\nuninformed optimism looks way better\nthan the valley of Despair and so what\ndo they do they quit at stage three and\nthey go into a new thing and now they\nstart at uninformed optimism then they\ngo to uninformed pessimism they go to\nvalve despair so that's why people quit\ndo something new quit do something new\nquit do something new quit do something\nnew quit do something new and then they\nnever actually get to success is because\nthey don't fight through the valley of\nDespair but as long as you just fight\nthrough the valley of Despair you start\nto get that momentum on your side and\nnow you go into stage four which is\ninformed op optimism which means you now\nare starting to feel better about\nyourself you're starting to feel like\nhey I've got this figured out I'm\nstarting to see the light at the end of\nthe tunnel here informed optimism I know\nwhat I don't know I know what I do know\nbut I'm optimistic that I'm going to get\nto the the place I want to be that's\nwhen you really start getting the\nmomentum in your side and then you hit\nstage five which is success and\nfulfillment which you know could be 3\nmonths down the road it could be six\nyears down the road depends on what it\nis that you're working for but you just\nhave to understand and you you should\nGoogle it if you want to or if you want\nto go into my book if you have it you\ncan look at the graph of the emotional\ncycle of change and if you start to look\nat it you go oh my god I've gone through\nthis so many times you\nknow whatever it is that you want is\ngoing to take a lot of work you have\nyour current life that you're in and\nyou're going to have to break through\nyour current life in order to create the\nlife that you want you know like what\nwould your life look like today if you\nnever gave up on anything that you\nstarted years ago your life would be\nvastly different and so really what it\ncomes down to is you're going to have to\ndo things you don't want to do you're\ngoing to have to take action nobody in\nthis world is going to come and save you\nyou're going to have to get off your\nbutt you're going to have to put on your\nbig boy big girl britches you're going\nhave to take some action you're going to\nhave to fight through some things that\nyou don't want to fight through you're\ngoing to have to get some momentum on\nyour side and then just make sure that\nyou never stop as soon as you get\nmomentum on your side don't ever stop if\nyou want to be more successful than\nanybody else that you know make a\ndecision and then just don't stop with\nthat decision and I promise you you'll\nget to where you want to be so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non Instagram stories
