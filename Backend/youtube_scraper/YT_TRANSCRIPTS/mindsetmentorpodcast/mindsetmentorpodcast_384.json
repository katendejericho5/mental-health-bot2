    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to use\nsomething called applied suffering to\npush yourself a little bit past your\ncomfort zone every single day and if you\ndo this enough it will make your life\neasier in the long run let's dive in we\nonly have a few weeks left until the end\nof the year and we go into 2024 and I\nwas talking with a friend of mine and\nhe's had quite a bit of growth in his\nlife and we were talking about like how\nhe can take it to the next level and you\nknow he's done courses he's hired\ncoaches um he has read books and he's\nlike man I just don't know what the next\nlevel is for me and I talked to him\nabout this idea of something is called\napplied suffering and you know I know\nhim really well and I know that his\ngrowth has been great but what he's been\ndoing to grow hasn't been that hard you\nknow it's been very knowledge based it's\nbeen courses it's been reading books but\nthere hasn't been any like applied\nsuffering and applied suffering means if\nyou go back to a few episodes ago when I\nwas talking about doing something that's\nthat's so hard that it changes you the\nidea is how can we have this this\nfeeling of I'm going to have applied\nsuffering because usually when we go\nthrough and we look back on our lives\nlook back on your entire life and ask\nyourself when did I have the most growth\nin my life and a lot of times what it\ncomes from is the hardest times in your\nlife and really what it comes down to is\nhow can I get myself to push for the\nsake of nothing else but pushing and the\nthing that that he you know that's funny\nabout him is he doesn't like restriction\nhe likes Freedom he likes you know he's\na very uh free soul and I told him that\nthe restriction and staying away from\nthe Restriction is actually the thing\nthat's keeping him from being free so\nsee he's trying to be free free but what\nhe's doing is he's constantly trying to\nstay away from being restricted and if\nyou're constantly trying to stay away\nfrom something whether that whether\nyou're you're you're addicted to\nsomething or you're trying to stay away\nfrom something that thing still has a\ngrasp on you in some sort of way you\nlike I remember Romas listening to him\nyears ago and he said whether you're an\nalcoholic or whether you're someone who\nis just like I will never have alcohol\nand I look down on every person who\ndrinks alcohol that thing that alcohol\nis just the example here but it could be\nanything still holds a place in your\nmind and still owns you in some sort of\nway and so when I was saying with him is\nhis he wants Freedom he wants to be free\nhe wants to be free and he's trying to\nrun away run away run away from from\nrestriction and I told him that the\nthing that's keeping him from being free\nthe most is trying to always get away\nfrom restriction and he thinks that he's\nfree but when you hate and you avoid\nsomething so much you're not actually\nfree so the next level of freedom for\nhim is applied suffering which is to\nrestrict himself and see if he can\nactually work through it and grow from\nit and so basically it is to do\nsomething that you don't want to do for\nyour growth and for knowing that there's\na better version of you on the other\nside of that you know mentally there's\nprobably something where if I ask you\nwhat is something that you don't want to\ndo what is something that is like\nthat not going to do it I want you to\nfigure out what that thing is and you\nknow that you mentally don't want to do\nit but deep down in your gut your gut's\nlike yeah man you should give it a shot\nright there's an intersection of the gut\nin the brain the gut feels like you\nshould do it the brain doesn't want to\ndo it now why wouldn't the brain want to\ndo it well because the brain is a safety\nmechanism your brain thinks no no no\nyou've got to only do things that are\ninside of your comfort zone because\nanything outside of your comfort zone is\ndanger and we don't want to hurt\nourselves but you know your gut knows\nyour growth is on the other side of what\nyou don't want to do\nthe cold showers the pushing yourself\nthe going for you know a run 10 miles\nevery single day and doing it over and\nover and over and over and over again\nfor 30 days straight for 60 days\nstraight for a 100 days straight it\ncould be working out every single day it\ncould be cold showers every single day\nit could be a new diet it could be\ngiving up coffee maybe you're you're\nanxious and maybe you're just going to\nforce yourself to meditate maybe you uh\nyou don't understand your emotions too\nmuch and you're not sure where\neverything comes from or maybe you have\na short fuse and maybe you need to to to\nforce yourself to journal but what it is\nis you've got to start to think about\nthat is what\nis what is the thing that you feel like\nyou need to do but mentally it scares\nyou what is it what's the thing that you\nfeel like you need to do but you have\nresistance towards it and then how\ndifferent would you be and how different\nyour would your relationship with it be\nif you did it for 30 days in a row\nlike if if you know you know what I've\nbeen really out of shape for a long time\nI'm going to work out 30 days in a row\nI'm just going to push myself to to the\nextreme for 30 days how would you be\ndifferent at the end of those 30 days\nhow would you be different if you said\nyou know what I'm going to do cold\nshowers every single day I'm going to\nfind the whatever it is find that thing\nthat is absolutely out of your comfort\nzone and do it every single day through\napplied suffering what does the other\nversion of you look like\nif you did that like let's go back to if\nyou were out of shape and you're trying\nto get yourself back in shape what would\n30 days of making yourself workout no\ndays off look like what would you look\nlike in 30 days what would what would be\nthe difference in your body in 30 days\nwhat would be the different difference\nin your mindset in 30 days what would\nthe difference in your relationship with\nyour body be in 30 days how would you\nhandle other challenges how would that\nworking out every single day influence\nthe way that you act in other places in\nyour business in your relationships you\nknow it doesn't take long to make\nsignificant change in your life and it's\nnever really too late to change you're\nnever too late to turn it around it\ntakes pushing yourself out of your\ncomfort zone into a new you is made and\ndoing it consistently over and over and\nover and over and over again because all\nin all if we're being real like life is\nreally just about sacrifice in whether\nyou decide to put sacrifice into your\nlife and sacrifice certain aspects of it\nor not there will be sacrifice so either\nyou decide that you want to do something\nthat is a sacrifice now or there'll be\nyou'll be sacrificing something later so\nlet me give you an example of what I\nmean if you want to build a brand new\nbusiness you must sacrifice something so\nit's crazy to me I've coached so many\nbusiness owners over years where they're\nlike I'm going to start this new\nbusiness but I don't want anything in my\nlife to change I'm like that doesn't\nmake any sense just close the business\ndown cuz\notherwise if if you don't change\nanything your business is going to fail\nso you might as well just let it go\nright so if you start a new business\nyou're going to have to sacrifice\nsomething you're going to have to\nsacrifice some time you're going to have\nto sacrifice maybe your current job you\nmight have to sacrifice some sleep you\nmight have to sacrifice hanging out with\nthe boys in the weekends you might have\nto sacrifice uh the toxic relationship\nthat won't that won't make it the new\nbusiness if you really want to to to\ngrow a new business you have to\nsacrifice right now not starting the\nbusiness though sacrificing later not\nhaving the business that you want later\nin the future not having the freedom\nthat you want not having the money that\nyou want whatever it might be so either\nyou're sacrificing now you're\nsacrificing later you know and it could\nbe not starting the business now the\nsacrifice later is mental health you\nhave to wake up and go to a job that you\nhate every single day maybe the\nsacrifice later is your bank account\nit's not where it could be maybe it's\nyour relationships because you don't\nhave as much free time because you\ndidn't put time in to grow in your\nbusiness business so you can't take\nthose trips you wanted to with your\nchildren maybe it's sacrificing your\npotential and it comes down to and I've\nsaid this over and over again uh but I\nhaven't spoken about in a while is life\nis either easy now and hard later or\nit's hard now and it's easy\nlater that's it there is your life is\ngoing to be hard at some point in time\neither it's easy now and you sit on the\ncouch and you watch Netflix and you\ndon't work out and you don't build your\nbusiness and that's easy now and you\nscroll on Instagram but if you do that\nit's going to be hard later or you say\nyou know what I'm going to use applied\nsuffering I'm I'm going to make it hard\nnow so that my life will be easier later\non down the road right so like your\nbusiness that's your current sacrifice\nyou have to sacrifice now that that is\nyou making it hard now maybe for having\nthat's hard now for easy later what was\nthat easy to look like maybe financial\nsuccess maybe it's more freedom maybe\nit's being able to travel maybe it's\ngiving your family an amazing life maybe\nit's giving your children a better\neducation so it's hard now starting the\nbusiness sacrifice yes but you get the\nfinancial success or the freedom or the\ntravel or creating a better life for\nyour children giving your family an\namazing life maybe your children get a\nbetter education because you can afford\nto send send them to certain places so\nthat would be easy now or I'm sorry hard\nnow and easy later but what would hard\nyou know I'm sorry what would easy now\nand hard hard later look like you know\nwhat I'm not going to start that\nbusiness you don't start and so the rest\nof your life you're stuck with a salary\nmaybe you don't have the freedom that\nyou want to to travel maybe you get a\nweek or two to go travel uh you have to\ngo to work every single day maybe you\nwon't be able to retire maybe you die\ndie with regret and wish you would have\ndone more so there's always a\nsacrifice either you sacrifice now or\nyou sacrifice later which one do you\nchoose you get to choose your sacrifice\nand so once again it's either hard now\nand easy later or it's easy now and hard\nlater so now you're aware of this you\nunderstand this you can't pretend that\nyou don't know this now I just let the\ncat out of the bag if you want to change\nyour life you have to make your life a\nlittle bit harder in some sort of way\nyou know if if you want to you know get\nin shape let's say let's use that as an\nexample you want to get in shape maybe\nyou're you uh just had something really\ntough happen physically and you're like\nI got to get in shape I got to get this\ntogether you're going to have to\nsacrifice you know you're going to have\nto sacrifice Netflix you're going to\nhave to sacrifice hanging out on the\ncouch you're probably going to have to\nsacrifice some naps you're going to have\nto sacrifice some time with friends you\nmight have to sacrifice alcohol you\nmight have to sacrifice that really\ntasty but shitty food that you've been\neating you might have to sacrifice\nputting yourself through some temporary\npain you might have to sacrifice hurting\nat the gym you might have to sacrifice\nbeing sore days\nafter so that would be applied suffering\nthat is hard now which will then make\nyour life easier later on down the road\nbecause you might be able to live longer\nyou might be more mobile you might be\nable to have uh have more fun with your\ngrandchildren because you can play with\nthem in the yard you might live an extra\n20 years that might make your life a\nlittle bit easier right and so it's like\nyeah it's harder now but it's going to\nmake your life easier\nlater and you know we all know if you\ndon't use it you lose it how many times\nyou see people that were not very Mobile\nin their 20s their 30s their 40s and\nthen you see them in their 70s and\nthey're not mobile at all because they\ndidn't get their bodies moving they did\nthey didn't use it so they lost it right\nso that would be an example of hard now\nand easy later\nbut let's say you decide you don't want\nto get in shape and you want to choose\neasy now how would that make your life\nharder in the future well you might have\na shorter\nlife ah that sucks you might live 10\nyears less you might be less mobile when\nyou get older you might not be able to\nplay with your grandchildren you might\nmight not be able to walk your daughter\ndown the aisle you might be tired and\nout of as much energy you might have\ndisease that comes because of it the\nbeautiful thing about life though is\nthat you get to choose your sacrifice\nyou get to choose your hard whether you\nrealize it or not you've been choosing\nyour hard your entire life but I will\ntell you this time is either your best\nfriend or it's your greatest enemy but\nin time everything works itself out so\nyou might be 30 years old and be like\nwell not a huge deal right now fast\nforward 60 years it's a big\ndeal and so you have to think about that\nyou get to choose your sacrifice either\nhard now and easy later or easy now and\nhard later you work harder to provide\nfor your family that's what you decide\nnot just you know for for for you but\nfor your entire family go I'm going to\ngo ahead and put myself through a\nimplied suffering I'm going to make it\nharder now because I know that I can\nmake it easier later you know if you're\nin sales and maybe you don't own a\nbusiness but you in sales in a company\nyou can either just hit your quota so\nthat you don't get fired or you could\nsay you know what I'm going to be the\nbest salesperson in this company\nwhy because I'm going to I'm going to\ngrow myself I'm going to learn about\nmyself I'm going to become better\nthrough this job you know what else I'm\ngoing to do I'm make a whole lot of\nmoney I'm going to take that money I'm\ngoing to invest it I'm going to be able\nto retire\nearlier there you go hard now or hard\nlater which one would you prefer\nrelationships they could be hard now or\neasy hard now and easy later easy now\nand hard later you know putting off the\nwork in a relationship what does that\nturn into tough\nconversations oh my gosh it might and\nand it's easier to have a tough\nconversation now believe me those of you\nthat have been in relationship for for a\nlong time it's easier to have a tough\nconversation now than to let things\nbuild up and have a tough conversation\nway way tougher conversation in three or\nfour or five years\nI want you to think about this think\nabout how much better your life could be\nif you chose the hard route every single\ntime if you broke through all of your\nlaziness and when an opportunity arose\nyou just took the path of more\nresistance how much better could your\nlife be in 10 years 20 years how much\nmore mobile could you be how much more\nmoney could you be have how much more\njoy could you have how much more peace\ncould you have if you chose the hard\nroute now how much better could your\nfamily's life be the people that you're\nclosest to in this world your Community\nwhen you step up it's not just your life\nthat improves that's what I want you to\nunderstand is we always think like oh\nwell I'm doing this for myself or you\nknow it won't really matter if I don't\ndo this for myself because it's not\nreally affecting anybody else no\neverything that you do or everything\nthat you don't do affects you and\neveryone around you it's not just your\nlife that improves or gets worse it's\nyour spouse's life it's your children's\nlife it's your parents life it's your\nsiblings life your family's life when\nyou step up and you push yourself to do\nsomething that's hard it will change\nyour life but it also change everyone\nwho you touch his life but when you\ndecide that you're just going to be lazy\nand you're not going to do the thing\nthat you need to do and you're not going\nto push yourself that also affects your\nfamily's life and so really what it\ncomes down to is what are you going to\ndo because you can have your life you\ncan have your life easy now if you want\nto but it's going to be hard later or\nyou can use applied suffering make your\nlife harder now challenge yourself grow\nyourself make yourself better ReDiscover\nthat that fire that motivation that you\nused to have that zest for life that you\nlost 10 years ago see if you can bring\nthat back into you and then also start\nto change yourself and change the\npeople's lives around you so do\nsomething that's hard that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you
