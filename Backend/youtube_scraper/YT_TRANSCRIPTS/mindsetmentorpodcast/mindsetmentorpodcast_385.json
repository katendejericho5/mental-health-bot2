    "transcript": "welcome everybody to the mindset Mentor\npodcast I'm your host Rob dial if you\nhave not yet done so hit that subscribe\nbutton so you never miss another podcast\nepisode today I'm sitting down with my\ngood friend uh and Buddy amazing author\nself-published now going into the\ntraditional route uh his name is Hal\nElrod if you guys don't know Hal I\nactually met back in 2006 uh he was on\nstage and uh was at a cut coat\nconference and talked about how he was a\ncoach and I was like hey I need a coach\nso I hired him and his best friend John\nberoff in 2006 to be my coaches and uh\nthroughout the process he started a\npodcast he wrote a book and he wrote\nthis book called The Miracle morning\nwhich you've probably heard of before\nthis is in all honesty probably the book\nthat started everyone talking about\nhaving a morning routine uh about 10 or\n11 years ago and uh it's kind of crazy\nhow I'll I'll tell you a story about\nthis I remember when it first came out I\nremember your first book and I read your\nfirst book and then I remember when this\nbook came out and it seemed like it was\nlike gaining some traction and you were\npushing it and you were pushing you were\npushing it and then I was like two or 3\nyears later I was like man he's still\npushing this book like is it is it is it\nselling like what's going on with it but\nI think what happened is you probably\nsaw what you saw you were on stage you\nsaw people coming up to you you saw the\nground like the the the Grassroots of\nhow it was moving yeah and so throughout\nyou you've wrote this book now 10 years\nago and you've basically as you told me\nalmost rewrote the entire book with the\nsame shell so it was originally 150\nPages it's now around 220 pages and the\ncool thing about it is when you wrote\nthe book 10 years ago it was when you\nwere kind of new at mirac morning yeah\nand now it's like you have 10 years of\nactually more than 10 years of you doing\nit personally years of me doing it 11\nyears of other people doing it years and\nit's and it's not [ __ ] which is what\nI love about it it's not like you're one\nof the people who like says do this and\nyou don't do it I've been to a Dave\nMatthews concert with you and your wife\nand halfway through Dave Matthews Ursula\nyour wife goes we got to leave morning\nso it's actually something that you\nreally truly do and and it's not like\nyou just preach it and don't fall\nthrough on it so what made you decide to\nto rewrite the book add more to it and\nyou know now have these stories of\nseeing it change people's lives why is\nnow the time to do this after selling\nyou know 2 million copies on your own\nyeah yeah it's so I've when when I was\nwriting the miracle morning and to your\npoint like I started doing the miracle\nmorning in 2008 I started sharing with\nmy coaching clients and like the light\nbulb went off after a few months I'm\nlike this is changing people's lives and\nmost of them were complaining that like\nI'm not a morning person Hal I'm like I\nknow I know neither was I try it and\nthen what ended up happening is the\nfeedback is like oh my gosh it's\nchanging my life and I went if it's\nchanging their life and they weren't\nquote unquote morning people and it and\nit changed my life and I wasn't a\nmorning person this could change the\nworld right this should change anybody's\nlife and I felt a sense of\nresponsibility like I have to share this\nright and so I have to write a book and\nI'm a slow writer took me 3 years to\nwrite the miracle morning nobody knew I\nwill I self-published it right 2012 um\nbut when I would during that process the\nbig book the the the most famous book at\nthat time was 4-Hour Work Week by Tim\nFerris yeah and two years after he wrote\nthat book which I loved right I read it\nI reread it I talked about it I shared\nit he wrote the 4-Hour Work Week updated\nand Expanded Edition and so even though\nI was literally writing the original\nEdition I was like oh this is so\ninteresting maybe one day in the future\nI'll write an updated edition of this\nbook I'm currently writing yeah and\nthere's two things number one is I\nalways say the miracle morning elevates\nyour conscious as a human being like it\nhelps you be more aware and intentional\nabout how your thoughts your words and\nyour actions are impacting your life and\nthe lives of every person that you you\ntouch you know friends family colleagues\nwhatever right whoever you're\ninfluencing through your interactions\nyou're becoming a better version\nyourself from the miracle morning\npractice and so in the last 15 years of\ndoing the miracle morning and 11 years\nsince the book published I would hope\nthat my Consciousness is elevated I'm\nmuch more aware and intentional um and\nI've been interacting with you you know\nmillions of I mean not literally\nmillions but there's millions of Miracle\nmorning practitioners and I've\ninteracted with you know tens of\nthousands of them over the last decade\nand I've learned so much not only in the\nway my own practice has evolved but from\nmembers of the community right like oh\nthat's a brilliant idea that's great and\nI've gone you know to meditation\nRetreats and really deepen like when I\nwrote the book it was very much like hey\nif you're new to meditation and\naffirmations I'm kind of new but I'm\nlike a level above if you will here's\nhow you do them and now it's like oh you\nknow I didn't know what I didn't know\nback then you've been doing it for 15\nyears for 15 years and so um so yeah so\nthis book I literally went through and I\nrewrote every page from a higher level\nof Consciousness if you will right um\nand I added over 70 pages of brand new\ncontent including two of the biggest\nrequests have always been or one of the\nbiggest requests is always when you can\ndo the miracle evening like what's your\nMiracle evening and I used to be\nembarrassed like I didn't have much of\nan evening ritual and then I kind of\nrealized studying that that wait how you\nend the day might be almost as important\nas how you begin the day for sure and so\nthe miracle evening is a you know a 20\nplus page chapter now and then the book\nI've had on my heart the last two years\nthat I've been working on as I've been\nrewriting this is called the miracle\nlife um and that book uh I didn't want\nto wait to give that content to the\nworld so there's a 20 plus page chapter\ncalled The Miracle life and that's\nreally about a paradigm for personal\nfulfillment a to Inner Freedom like look\nwe've all been blessed with one life I\nthink at the end of our Lives we're\ngoing to look back and go man I wasted\nso much energy being stressed afraid\ndepressed worrying about stuff that just\nlife happened why didn't I enjoy every\nmoment of that one life I was blessed to\nlive and that's what the miracle life is\nso that's awesome yeah that's it's\nreally interesting because it's like\nit's it's such like if somebody hasn't\nread the miracle morning I've it's funny\ncuz I I feel like it's just it's huge in\nlike every everybody's read it and then\nyou look at it's like 2 million is a lot\nbut there's so many people that haven't\nread it 8 billion that we still have to\nthere's a lot of people that haven't and\nso the the thing about it is it's it's\ncrazy because it's such an anomaly to\nsell you know a 100,000 copies\nself-published to do a million copies\nself-published is even crazier but to do\n2 million shows you like there's\nsomething about this book that's\nconnected with people that's changed\npeople's lives and that's what's so\nawesome about the whole thing is that\nlike I don't know if you ever sat back\nand been like holy [ __ ] 2 million copies\nself-publish is like one of the rarest\nthings that you could possibly do as far\nas an accomplishment so that's a huge\nthing but and I want you to realize that\nis like it's it's amazing that you have\ndone that for sure but the I want what I\nreally want to know about is like what's\nthe difference in like okay so you went\nthrough and there was Hal who wrote it\nand you were how old when you first\nwrote it yeah\n207 28 when I started and so you're how\nold Now 44 44 so it's like okay anybody\nout there is like like if you wrote a\nbook at 26 27 28 you have that knowledge\nthat's there but an extra 15 years 16\nyears of knowledge and wisdom that\nyou've gotten from it what do you feel\nare some of the biggest changes that you\nor adjustments that you made to the book\nthat's different where you read it and\nyou're like man this is good but I'm so\nyoung and I'm so there's there's like\nparts of it where you're probably like\noh man I could cringeworthy like it's\nkind like when you hear your your voice\nlike on video from a few years ago\nyou're like oh my God turn that off I\ncan't so Nas yeah when I reread my book\nI'm like this I was a how immature this\nis so cheesy like so I've wanted that's\nanother selfish reason I've wanted to\nrewrite it for a long time is when I\nread it I'm like I'm like rolling my\neyes I'm like how do people take this\nseriously right how is this sold 2\nmillion copies like literally why are\npeople buying this yeah I mean literally\nI'm like embarrassed and I'm like I want\nto rewrite this right now and luckily\nwell here's what's interesting as a\nself-published author one of the\nbenefits is I've uploaded a new version\nof the book like not a completely\nupdated but I've gone through and I have\nlike because I read you know there's\n32,000 reviews on Amazon now I haven't\nread all of them but I have read many\nthousands and I always wanted to look\nlike I'd read not just the five star to\nbe like oh people like it but I'd read\nthe one the two the three star almost\nmore so and go what are the common\nthemes where I I I I I I I didn't quite\nhit the mark or I'm you know I was toned\ndeaf in these areas and so over the last\n11 years I've updated I think three\ntimes where early on like after a year\nor two I was like okay multiple people\nare saying this same thing um and so I\nwould go in and I would change those\nparts and then I'd upload a new PDF to\nAmazon and there'd be a new book right\nso I was able to slightly do that over\nthe years but um the uh now it was\nliterally going through every I took\nabout took about eight months for me to\num rewrite like eight months of writing\nevery day as if it were a new book to\nrewrite it and then my editor who was\nalso the CEO and founder of Bin Bella\nthe my publisher I mean he he was like I\nwant this book book to be the best it\ncan be so how I don't usually do this\nhe's like I'm actually going to be your\neditor I was like awesome that's amazing\nand he was amazing and um and and so\nwhat was great is he would actually go a\nlot of some of the stuff I rewrote he\nwas like he actually would back he's\nlike Okay so this part way better you\nwent too far off on the rewrite like I\nthink you should change this back to how\nit was so there's some parts for sure\nthat like like the way I told a story is\nlike you told it better initially um\nthere's obviously some magic that's\nthere that you don't want to take the\nmagic out of it and that was actually\nthe a fear too right it's like okay this\nbook I I it it works yeah right if it's\nnot fixed don't bro that's actually\ndon't [ __ ] it up literally I\nlabeled this is funny so little bonus\ntip for people um when I when I the the\nword document the Microsoft Word\ndocument the manuscript that I was\nrewriting I labeled it if it's not\nbroken don't TMM for theming if it's not\nbroken don't fix it yeah like literally\njust remind me don't change too much but\nI'll give you an example so when I\nstarted when I wrote that meditation was\nnew to me when I wrote the first version\nyeah I've developed this meditation that\nI call emotional optimization meditation\nI don't know if I made it up or it's in\nmy subconscious from someone else I\nthink I made it up but but it's rather\nthan just clearing your mind it's\nactually identifying what's the optimal\nmental and emotional state that I need\nto be in today that would serve today\nand maybe if it's on the weekends with\nyour kids it's I need to be playful\nright or maybe if you had a fight with\nyour spouse it's I need to be at a pace\nof like love and forgiveness or on an\naverage day what you would teach is like\nI need to be focused today right for\nsure and so I identify what's the number\none mental emotional state that I need\nto embody today and then I use different\ntechniques to get into that state then I\nset my meditation timer and I I like the\nword marinate like I meditate or\nmarinate in that state so I'm\nprogramming my central nervous system my\nsubconscious to embody it and then now I\ncan show up at my best for the people I\nlove the people that I lead in that\nstate whether it's for my kids or my\nwife or my clients or whatever right so\nso that's an example like there's a\ndetailed in-depth part of that another\nlike you're like a chicken in a plastic\nbag you're just marinating marinating\nduring that meditation huh that's what\nyou're doing that's it that's awesome I\nlove that I love that idea so you were\nyou were continuing I didn't want to\ninterrupt you but that's the way I think\nabout it where it's actually like I hear\nso many times that people are like I\nstruggle with meditation I struggle with\nmeditation I struggle with meditation\nbut if you think about it instead of\nlike I'm going to turn my brain off it's\nlike I'm going to use my brain to think\nabout how I emotionally want to feel\nthroughout the day and just like\ndropping a a chicken inside of some\nlemon pepper inside of a bag I'm just\ngoing to marinate in that for the next\n15 minutes that's it so so okay so\nyou're continuing about about how you\nuse it yeah and by the way feel free I'm\nlong-winded so you interrupt anytime\nthat you want no worries um so yeah the\nother one is affirmations affirmations\nis my favorite and fact let me back up\nfor anybody new to the miracle morning\nso the miracle morning is made up of six\npractices right you know this but in\ncase anyone doesn't so so it's silence\nso the by the way the six practices are\nthe Savers the acronym s a v RS silence\naffirmations visualization exercise\nreading and scribing and if you actually\nif you look at those those are the six\nmost timeless proven personal\ndevelopment practices in the history of\nmankind like that you know that the\nworld's most successful people from\nOlympian Olympic athletes to you know\nmulti-millionaire entrepreneurs to you\nname it that they have sworn by for\ncenturies right I didn't invent any of\nthem but according to Robert kisaki he\nsaid how before the Savers no successful\nperson I'm aware of did all six of these\nthey might have done one or two maybe\nthree he said but the way you packaged\nthem and made it so easy to go through\nand do all six of the most timeless\npractices um but\naffirmations is my favorite of the\npractices like whenever somebody's like\ndo you have a favorite of the Savers I\nalways joke it's like politically\ncorrect to be like no they're all\nequally important you need all like my\nchildren love them children I love them\nall equally but I'm like honestly it's\naffirmations because the way\naffirmations have been taught for maybe\ndecades by self-help they're corny it's\nit's it's one of two problems either\nwe're taught to tell ourselves something\nwe wish were true that's not true to us\nright like I am a Millionaire right if\nyou're struggling financially you're\nlike I am financially free and your\n[ __ ] meter is going off the whole\ntime yeah your subconscious is like dude\nyou're lying what are you you're lying\nright and now you're creating an\nunnecessary internal conflict as if we\ndon't have enough of them the second\nproblem is we're taught to use this y\npassive language that makes us better\nfeel better in the moment cuz it's like\nthis imaginary everything's going to get\nbetter great example I am a money magnet\nright I hate that money flows to me\neffortlessly and in abundance right yeah\nand so I teach affirmations in this very\nspecific tangible measurable way so in\nthat\nbook like it's it's like a master class\naffirmations Workshop because the\noriginal book I thought I taught it well\nenough but it wasn't deep enough where\npeople were like I don't get like how do\nI get affirmations are hard for me and\nI'm like so again an example of like I\nwas able to it's like there's like 17\npages I think just on affirmations don't\nquote me I'm making that up but it's\nlike it's it's this really long you know\nand I give examples and then yeah so\nthat's awesome so then so it's s a v RS\nso uh in the the last s is scribe which\nstands for journaling scribing\njournaling yeah and so so it makes sense\nso wasn't sa J or sa J sa it was\noriginally literally when I was writing\nthe book it was SA plus J and that\nbothered me and and I was telling my\nwife one day I remember the moment I met\nher in the hallway she goes you look\nfrustrated what's up I'm like I've Got\nThis Acronym but it's like not really a\ncomplete acronym and it's kind of and\nshe goes why don't you get at thesaurus\nand see if there's another word for\njournaling perfect and it was scribing\nand I'm like that's amazing yeah so the\nthing that I like about it though is is\nand that's kind of what you said is that\nthere's six practices that you use and\nthese are six practices that if anybody\nimplemented any of them it would start\nto work with them so it's like silence\nsitting there in silence and meditating\ndoing affirmations doing visualization\ndoing exercises doing reading doing\njournaling all of those things are going\nto help you in some sort of way but what\nyou've kind of done is said hey if you\nhave if you wake up an hour early and\nthere's six of them take 10 minutes each\nand just do each one of them or 30\nminutes early do five minutes each or 6\nminutes early's a 6 Minute Miracle\nmorning literally like that's a whole\nchapter in the book on yeah you can get\nyes you can do at any point in time yeah\nwhat's the importance I'm curious of\ndoing all of them at at one time in the\nmorning versus just saying well I'm\ngoing to pick two or three of them yeah\nI'm GNA answer I'm going to answer that\nquestion and another question that is\nkind of could be wrapped into it which\nis a lot of people say okay the Savers\nI'm sold like doing the six most\ntimeless personal development sure but\nwhy in the morning can I do I'm not a\nmorning person can do in the afternoon\nor the evening right and um and here's\nthe answer is they'll benefit you in the\nafternoon or in the evening but when you\ndo them first thing in the morning\nthere's immediate benefits right when\nyou meditate it lowers your cortisol\nlevels there's over 1,400 scientific\nstudies that prove the benefits of\nmeditation in fact that was like 10\nyears ago there's probably 10 times that\nmany studies right um so if you wait to\nmeditate until the evening you you\nmissed out on lowering your cortisol\nlevels and gaining mental Clarity right\nand so when you do affirmations they\nfocus your mindset on what you're\ncommitted to what you're capable of what\nyou're going to do to get where you want\nto go that directs your focus for the\nday if you wait till the evening you've\nmissed out and you know if you exercise\nin the morning right more energy so all\nof the Savers benefit you immediately\nand then there's a lasting benefit after\nso when you start your day with a\nmiracle morning you put yourself in a\nPeak Physical mental emotional and\nspiritual state to win the day yeah and\nso that's why first thing in the morning\nso that's the big picture answer and\nthen in terms of doing some in the\nmorning some later I think that's fine\nlike the beauty of the miracle morning\nthere's a whole chapter toward the end\nof the book on customizing the miracle\nmorning to achieve your goals\nand if you you know if you just wake up\nand do one of the Savers that's still a\nmiracle morning right you're missing out\non the benefits of the others but um but\nyeah so I don't think there's a problem\nwith doing some in the morning what I\nalways what I always share in the book\nat the it ends with a 30-day challenge\nor now it's a 30-day Journey because I\nsay in the new book I'm like we have\nenough challenges let's let's go on a\njourney together right um but I say just\ndo all six yeah and for the 30-day\nchallenge or 30-day journey and then\nyou'll know you won't know what you\ndon't know if you don't do all 600 in\nthe morning and then you might be like I\nactually want to do this the exercise\nfirst like for me now I start every\nmorning with 60 seconds of jumping jacks\nM just because it gets the blood flow\ninto my brain now I'm thinking clear my\nmy my brain's turned on um and then I do\na full workout at the end of the miracle\nmorning I go out to the gym my gym and\nyou know and I work out um but but yeah\nso it's like doing all of them in the\nmorning then you'll know which ones\nbenefit you the most which ones you\nmight go you know what I'm actually\ngoing to move this one to after lunch or\nI'm going to double it up and I'll do a\nlot of people say they'll do Savers in\nthe morning and they'll do like a mini\nSavers later in the day or in the\nevening so yeah what's some of you know\nwhen you first wrote the book obviously\nit was like you had a little bit of\nexperience with some of your coaching\nclients and that was like a small sample\nsize but now you have this massive\nsample size you have 38,000 reviews or\nwhatever it is that came in 2 million\ncopies sold I'm sure you get emails all\nthe time there's people that download\nyour app there's all of this what are\nsome of the stories that were just like\nholy [ __ ] I can't believe this actually\nhappened from someone just waking up up\nin implementing Savers under their day\nyeah um and there's so many right and\nand I just went through I went through\nyou know to put them all the new ones in\nthe book um but they're really profound\nand and this is let me say this when you\nsaid man it's been like three years how\nstill talking about Miracle morning yeah\nthis is why yeah because I was still\nreading every new Amazon review that\ncame in it's like oh my gosh I was\ndepressed for the last 6 months I read\nthis book I'm on my third I'm on day 14\nmy 30 challenge I'm not depressed\nanymore like I am this has changed my\nlife I'm like how could I not keep\ntalking about this and sharing it with\nas many people as I can so I really\nthink this is my life's work like I've\nwritten other books and such so um\nhere's some of the stories so Mike Eaton\nand and for those that don't know there\nis a miracle morning movie right there's\na documentary uh and so we featured some\nof the stories in that movie one of them\nwas Mike Eaton Mike Eaton had been obese\nhis entire life uh made fun of in high\nschool um and uh and then and he had\nread he had tried diets you nothing\nworked friends like hey read the miracle\nmorning not to lose weight but just read\nthe miracle morning the miracle when he\napplied all the he Creations like I want\nto weigh this committed to do these\nthings so that I can lose the weight you\nknow and right he visualized himself all\nof the things within it's been a long\ntime since I I don't want to get the\nnumbers wrong but it's something along\nthe lines of within his first two months\nof doing the miracle morning he lost\nsomething like 50 lb now he's down like\n80 lb from like 330 I think to 250 right\nand he credits it's because of the\nmiracle morning so that's something\nwhere I wouldn't imagine losing weight\num another uh another guy who's in the\nmovie Keith minck and he's in the book\nKeith uh his son died at 3 hours old\nright so they had a child born and the\nchild died 3 hours later and him and his\nwife both went into a deep depression he\nwas the I believe he was the director of\nBusiness Development at Turner home\nbroadcasting at the time and he said he\nyou know basically he was\ndisenfranchised with his work cuz he's\nlike what's the point why are we even\ndoing this why should I live what it\ndoesn't matter um and I think it was\nlike a year of that and he books on\nGrief right someone said Hey try this\nthing the miracle morning it's changing\nmy life and in keone words in the book\nhe talks about his very first miracle\nmorning he was like oh I'm in control of\nthe way that I feel I don't have to be\ndepressed anymore over my son's\ndeath I'm I'm I'm I'm not depressed\nanymore like he goes it it didn't take\nmonths of the miracle morning it was the\nfirst miracle morning where he\ncompletely shifted his Paradigm around\nthe way he was experiencing the death of\nhis son um and you know and and then you\nknow he talked about 10 years later he\nstill does the miracle morning every\nsingle day and he talked about how it's\nevolved and he's evolved and you know\nand it was like the best example of like\nhow the miracle morning can change your\nlife in one day and continue to be\nchanging your life a decade later right\nand there's tons of stories of people\nthat like they finally overcame their\nprocrastination and wrote that book that\nwas on their mind the miracle morning\nhelped them start that business it\nhelped them you know run a Marathon I\nmean it's just you name it here let me\nsay this the way to put it is this\nwhatever you're whatever you want to\naccomplish in your life when you apply\nthe savors the miracle morning every\nmorning you become the person that you\nneed to be to accomplish that thing\nwhether it's losing weight making money\ntransforming your marriage you know it's\nreally Universal yeah I mean it comes\ndown to like if we just make it real\nbasic it's just being intentional with\nyour life and so many people are just so\nunintentional and they just wake up and\nI did this for years like for years and\nyears and years I woke up and when I\nstill worked for someone else and I had\nto drive into an office I'd wake up you\nknow 15 minutes before I had to leave i'\njump in the shower real quick on the way\nthere I'd stop at Taco Cabana and I get\nsome breakfast tacos and coffee and then\nI'd roll into there and I'd been up for\nlike 30 minutes and it was just like but\nit was just it was just as my ex first\ngirlfriend I ever had her dad used to\nalways say to me she used to always say\nit's same [ __ ] different toilet is all\nthat it was right it's just like every\nday felt exactly the same and just like\nI could I could take yesterday and I\ncould place it on tomorrow and all of it\nfelt exactly the same and I think the\nthe key to it is that you decide that\nyou're going to first off wake up\nearlier which is not always easy you\nknow or go to bed earlier so that you\ncould do it and it's easier to stay\ninside of your bed but it's it's\nliterally like from the moment your\nalarm clock goes off you go I'm going to\nchoose me today yeah and so many people\nhave not done that I was interviewed\nyesterday on a guy's podcast who said it\ntook him 50 years to wake up you know\nbut he was in depression and all this\nstuff it's like at some point he just\nwent you know what I'm going to choose\nme and that's kind of what what's\nimportant about is it's like all right\nit's going to be important for me to\nwake up in the morning and for me to\nchoose me and and actually start to put\nsome action to it and instead of being\nreactive to the world I'm going to be\nproactive I'm actually start to put some\nintention into my life yeah yeah it is\nit's how you start your day this was\nSteve\npavina uh uh who wrote the book personal\ndevelopment for smart people he said how\nyou start your day sets the tone the\ncontext and the direction of the day\nyou're able to create for sure you know\nand that's it yeah so then um with with\nthis I'm curious with uh with your\nchildren because what we were talking\nabout what I do want to talk about is\nhow this is going into school so do your\nchildren do this with you how old are\nyour kids first off to people who don't\nknow your children how old are they and\ndo they do the miracle morning with you\nhave they resisted it what does that\nlook like yeah they they my daughter is\n14 going on 20 25 um and uh my son is\nabout to turn 11 right so 14 and 11 and\nuh they do not do the miracle morning uh\nwe used to do the mirac morning when\nthey were younger uh and my daughter she\nbecame a teenager was like I don't dad\nand uh and so uh it is interesting being\na parent and seeing the phases right\nwhere I've talked to other parents where\nthere are times where your child you're\nlike whoa who are you like this isn't\nthe person I've been raising and you and\nthey you start feel like they're\nslipping away and then they come back\nyou know like it's really phases and I\nremember seeing that when my daughter\nwas like I don't know five seven years\nold I think and she like was this like\nall of a sudden from being a sweet girl\nto like just attitude and this and that\nI'm like Sophie and like and and nothing\ngot through to her and then it it it\nlasted for like a few weeks or a month\nyeah and then she was being nice again\nand I was like you're so sweet I was\nlike you you there was a period there\nfor a few weeks where you were really\nshe's like Dad that Sophia is gone and\nshe is never coming back and uh she has\nfor sure come back but but you learn\nlike she's returned she returns and then\nshe goes yeah um it's interesting but uh\nbut so yeah so they we've done the\nmiracle morning through phases um I'm\ntried to get my daughter to write the\nmiracle morning for teens the miracle\nmorning for kids and it's like she will\nthen she won't so it is funny so when I\npeople are like you know how how do you\nthe mirac morning with kids I'm like\nwhen you figure that out I'm like let me\nknow cuz I've actually struggled and we\nnow I will say um there are many parents\nthat and it's it's almost embarrassing\nfor you to be like I'm not the parent\nthat figure it out well no the good\nthing about it though before you say it\nis is like cuz first off the good thing\nthat I like about is that you're not\nforcing it onto your children which\nmeans they're most likely going to come\nback around to it and enjoy it because\nyou're not forcing it on to\nright which is the best part so you\ncould what you're saying but there's no\nreason to be like oh my God I'm the M\nmorning that my children should be like\nMasters At This M morning it's the Clos\nit's like dad's telling us to do this\nright yeah my wife doesn't listen to\nanything that I exactly I have people to\ntune in and listen to this it's the same\nwith my wife people go how do you get\nyour wife to do the miracle morning or\nyour spouse I'm like let me know when\nyou figure that out we've done probably\neight Miracle mornings together in our\nentire life God there's been times where\nshe's like I'm going to cuz when I was\non Robert kiyosaki's podcast years ago\nhim and his wife do the miracle morning\nand he said we grow close it helps us\ngrow grow closer so that we don't grow\napart oh my God and I sent that clip to\nmy wife and uh I'm like hey don't you\nwant to grow closer so we don't grow\napart and uh and then she's like yes\nlet's do Miracle morning and that lasted\nfor like you know a week or whatever and\nthen she's like I just you know so but\nit were so close right she's like I\ndon't want to do your Miracle morning\nthing yeah um anyway but uh but but I\nwill say this uh there is a book called\nThe Miracle morning for parents and\nfamilies that I co-authored with Mike\nand Lindsay McCarthy and I co both\nawesome people I know both of them\nawesome they came to me an event and\nshe's like hey my son Tyler and I think\nhe was six at the time and this was I\nknow he's probably 13 14 now um she said\nwe do the miracle morning with our kids\nevery day and he wanted to share his\naffirmations with you and I'm like okay\nand he comes up and he reads me his\naffirmations and they were in\nalphabetical order you know it's like\nthat's amazing and we start I start\ntalking I'm like how did you get him to\nthe miracle morning and so they I mean\nso they have an amazing system and they\ndo the miracle morning with their kids\nevery day and they have for like 7 years\nyou know so if you want to learn how to\ndo it um you know Miracle morning for\nparents and families yeah yeah that's\ngood I mean the thing about it man is\nlike I see too many people uh it's the\ntoo many people try to push things onto\ntheir children the more that you push\nsomething onto somebody the more they're\ngoing to resist it you know that was the\nthing I realized with with my wife when\nwe first started dating is I was like so\ninto personal development then I had\nthis podcast and I was like I'd buy your\nbooks and I'd be like let's go to a\nconference and she's like no I don't\nreally want to and then eventually after\na few years I was like okay she's just\nnot into it no big deal I guess this is\nmy thing no that's fine like some people\nlike basketball some people like\nfootball it's like it's just the way\nthat it is and so what was interesting\nthough is then I stopped trying to push\nit and then lo and behold she came back\naround she started doing her own\nroutines and start now we meditate every\nsingle morning we have our own routines\nand and stuff that we do and so it's and\nand now she's actually a coach which is\nlike crazy because she was an impersonal\nV at all the first few years and so\nshe's great I watched her on Instagram\nand she makes videos on Instagram and\nI'm like man that was really good you\nknow and so I think it's it's good when\nyou don't force it on to people um\nbecause Different Strokes for different\nfolks but the thing is like if\nsomebody's listening to this and they're\nlike man I I've really told myself\nbecause the amount of times that I've\nheard people say I'm I've I've been\ntelling myself for six months when I\nstarted morning routine and telling\nmyself I want to do a morning routine\nbut I'm just not doing I'm going to\nfinally wake up early that's one of my\nthings if it's something that resonates\nwith you I think it's like buy the\nmiracle morning book read it take what\nyou want from it try it out and as you\nsaid do it for 30 days go on a 30-day\nJourney because you can do anything for\n30 days you know and if you just try it\nfor 30 days and works for you continue\nto keep doing it if you hate it which\nyou won't but if you hate it don't do it\nagain but it's like I think what people\nneed to do is just try it and say okay I\ncould do anything for 30 days and if\nit's really important for me to change\nmy life why don't I just try it well and\nI'll tell you two things one is people\nalways ask like what if I'm not a\nmorning person right or what do you say\nto someone that says I'm not morning\nperson I say join the club we we\nconsistently every time we send out a\nsurvey to the miracle morning Community\nwhich is you know hundreds of thousands\nof people that are on the email list\nthey and I we always ask before miracal\nmorning before you read the book were\nyou a morning person did you consider\nyourself a morning person or not and it\nconsistently it's on average 72% of\nMiracle morning practitioners say I was\nnot a morning person and I never thought\nI could be one before I read the book\nand when I wrote the book that was my\nlike number one driving like guiding\nprinciple is how do I get someone from\nlike I've never been a morning person\nand I don't even want to be one cuz I\ndon't want to wake up early to I'm doing\nthe miracle morning for the rest of my\nlife and so I think that is the book\nliterally holds some\nhand both psych psych the psychology of\nit like how do you shift that mindset\nand overcome the limiting belief go I'm\nnot a morning person I've tried it\ndidn't work and logistically how do you\nset yourself up for Success like there's\na whole chapter in the book on it's\ncalled the snooze proof five-step wakeup\nstrategy right which is like how do you\novercome being you know a lifetime snoo\naholic is what I call it right um and\none of those five tips is you move your\nalarm clock across the room because if\nwhen the alarm goes off if you can reach\nover and turn it off while you're still\nyou know like 70% asleep right and just\nfall right back asleep you're going to\ndo it even for me if I fall asleep at a\nhotel room and I have the alarm next to\nthe I will snooze like I you know and I\ndon't even know I'm doing it right and\nthat's me and um and uh but if the alarm\nclock if you have to actually get out of\nbed and walk into your bathroom and turn\nit you're you're awake now you're up and\nso that's like one of the five you know\nsteps or whatever but like that alone is\na total game changer for sure right so\nyeah um it's funny Cu uh are you\nfamiliar with who Rick Rubin is yeah so\nhe's like one of the most people who\ndon't know out there he's like\nthe the best music producer that's ever\nexisted you know and his book and he's\nalso now one of the best authors his\nbook is amazing too and so he uh but he\nwas known for being a night owl like he\nhe told himself for years he's like well\nI'm just a night owl and you know he\nproduced music until like 3:00 in the\nmorning then he'd go to sleep and he'd\nwake up at noon yeah and he thought for\nyears he was just like I'm a night ow\nthat's just who I am and then one day\nhe's like what if I just decided to\nstopped being a night owl and just tried\nto go to bed early and he realized he\nwasn't actually a night owl it was just\nthat his Arcadian rhythms were just set\nincorrectly and he just restarted it by\ndeciding to be a morning person so it's\nlike everyone who's who stays up late\nlike I'm just a nightow and I think it's\nlike or you could stop having coffee at\n5:00 p.m. and maybe you'd fall asleep\nearlier yeah and starting your Netflix\nat 11:00 p.m. yeah so I think it's an\nimportant aspect of it of like try it\nout and see if you are still a night owl\nafter 30 days yeah well Pat Flynn um uh\nwho hosts smart passive income podcast\nright I I've always loved Pat from afar\nand um I reached out to him once when\nthe miracle morning came out I'm like\nhey Pat I'm a huge fan I'd love to be on\nyour podcast and he's like sorry we're\nnot taking any guests I'm like okay yeah\nand then I don't know maybe a year or so\nlater he reached out and he was like hey\nI keep hearing about Miracle morning\nmiracle morning miracle morning you got\nto be Miracle morning he's like so I'd\nlove to have you on the show now and I\nwas like yeah that's amazing and when I\ngot on the show I think it was before we\nstarted recording it might have been\nwhen we were recording but I think it\nwas before um but anyway he said said\nHal um I'm not I'm not a morning person\nI'm I you know I'm a night owl and he\nsaid I I get my best work done at night\nand he said I wake up in the morning\nwhen I I my alarm clock is my kiddos\nwhen they come in and start going daddy\ndaddy daddy that's when when I wake up\nso in my mind I'm like how am I going to\nconvince this guy that has the most\nheartfelt alarm clock yeah right like no\nno no you shouldn't wake up by your\nchildren you should wake up before them\nand just eliminate that from your life\nyeah with an annoying sound that\nstartles\nyeah not to mention you know he's one of\nthe most I mean he's as successful as he\ncould be he's running marathons he's had\na great family he's a great dad he's\nmaking you know seven figures I'm like I\ngot how am I going to convince him to do\nmiror morning right so I talked to him\nabout what we've talked about today\nright and by the end of the episode he's\nlike how you've convinced me that I\nmight be missing out on the next level\nof productivity by not starting my day\nwith the Savers he's like so I'm\ncommitting right now to you and my\naudience I will do the 30-day challenge\nI will document it on like social Med\nmedia like come with me everybody and uh\nand and we'll see what happens and I was\nlike amazing right and uh you know now\nhe's in the miracle morning movie like\nas he is a miracle morning practitioner\nright and it changed his life and I\nthink he said I forgot the stat but it\nwas on Instagram one day he like it's\nincreased my productivity by like 300%\ndon't quote me but it's something like\nthat you know so that's someone who was\nfull on night Al had no reason that he\nneeded to wake up early and when he did\nit actually enhanced his already awesome\nlife and Robert Kaki was the same way\nright you know worth $100 million super\nsuccessful does the miracle morning he\nsaid it transformed his marriage for the\nbetter he lost like I don't know the\namount of pounds but if you look at him\nPrem Miracle morning he is probably 50\nPBS heavier and now he looks he's felt\nhe looks healthy you know so that's\nawesome yeah talk to me about uh the\nthing that we were talking about right\nbefore we started though was how this is\nactually starting to get into schools\nwhich I think is awesome because and I\nwas I was surprised you said like\nactually the majority of them are\nactually elementary schools it's all\nacross the board but Elementary is\nactually where it's starting so how did\nit start start cuz you were telling me a\nstory and then what exactly is is\nhappening in schools with the miracle\nmorning so totally organic um Brianna\ngreenpan who is one of my closest\nfriends uh she was a coaching client\nbefore you were I think when or after I\ndon't know but when I was when I was\nfirst writing not writing when I came\nwith the miracle morning she was one of\nthe first people I taught it to and she\nresisted I'm not a morning person I'm\nnot and then she is like the biggest\nadvocate of the miracle morning she\nstarted the miracle morning Clubhouse\nroom um I know a couple years ago and\nsomebody came into that Clubhouse room\nthat was the principal and she said uh\nher name is Anisha Jacko she said uh I'm\nin New York City I'm in one of the worst\nschool districts like poverty you know\nuh stricken School District um we had\none of the highest attention rates\nsomebody gave me the miracle morning\nduring the 2020 pandemic my mental\nhealth was I was struggling and she said\nI started doing it and it changed my\nlife and I so then I shared it with all\nof our teachers I'm like you guys we got\nto do this together so we did a 30-day\nchallenge every all the teachers were\nlike this is amazing how do we roll it\nout with the kids so they started doing\na six minute Savers over the loudspeaker\nevery morning she would lead it and\nevery student would do a miracle morning\nto start their day M their detention\nwent from the highest rate in their\nentire like in their I don't know\nDistrict or whatever um to almost no\ndetention at all it's crazy I mean I\nwouldn't believe it if I hadn't she\nhadn't shown me the stats and I went out\nand visited her like so she shares this\nin the clubhouse room and Brianna's like\nthis is amazing and another woman speaks\nup she's like hey I'm a principal\ncan we exchange info how do we roll this\nout in our school and so totally organic\nyeah then over the next like 12 months\nBrianna brought the miracle morning to\nover 100,000 teachers and students in\njust New York City this was last year\nand now it's the number one selling\neducational product in the largest city\nin America or one of the largest cities\nin America um and we're just starting\nlike the the state of Rhode Island now\nis looking at adopting it in their\nentire state curricul\nwow so and here's the crazy part I told\nyou this in 2016 this is a lesson in\nmanifesting y all and I am very\nskeptical at manifesting but when this\nhappens I'm like I guess it's a\ncoincidence but I've seen so many of\nthese coincidences I don't know in 2016\nI wrote The 10year Vision for the\nmiracle morning right and this is 2023\nso we're what seven years into it and\none of the components I wrote is that by\n2026 the miracle morning is practiced in\nevery school in America and I was\nthinking like what are the benefits of\nright I know the adults that are\npracticing the miracle morning how\nchanging their life how would that apply\nto a student and I thought well if\nstudents are meditating every day and\nthey're getting they're finding peace\nwithin themselves and they're reading\naffirmations that remind them that they\nare Limitless and capable of anything\nand and I thought they could really\novercome their limiting beliefs and\ntheir self-doubt and the the\ninsecurities they face and and the fear\nthe things that cause them to bully\nother kids I remember I literally wrote\ndown it could be bringing an end to\nbullying right so I wrote that down but\nI actually left it at that I didn't\nmake a plan to how to get it in schools\nand then uh and then Brianna Greenspan\num ends up sharing it on the clubhouse\nroom with you know that principal and\nthen now it's spread through schools\nthroughout New York City over 100,000\nteachers and Educators and parents have\nadopted the miracle morning and it's\nspreading throughout the entire country\nand um yeah it's amazing and the reports\nwe're getting are you know bullying is\ndown detention is down mental health is\nup and and and it's gone beyond the book\nwhere now we're creating this entire\ncurriculum where Brianna and her team go\ninto schools and they teach the Stu\nteachers and the principal is how to\nroll it out in their school with their\nstudents in their classrooms yeah so\nwell this is I mean I know I have a lot\nof teachers that listen to me there's\nhundreds of thousands of people that are\ngoing to hear this so is there a way for\nuh if someone's out there they're a\nteacher they're a principal is there an\nemail or some way to get in touch with\nyour team then in that way so right now\nwe'll start with email we're in the\nwe're building a website where schools\ncan you know submit reest but support at\nmirac morning.com and if you're like hey\nI heard the podcast I I'm a teacher I'm\na principal I'm a parent I'm really\ninterested in bringing this to my school\nwe'll you know I'll get in touch with\nBrianna or our team and and we'll figure\nthat out yeah so thanks for yeah for\nsure yeah because I think it's important\nif it's if it's obviously doing that\nmuch with the the 100,000 kids imagine\nif you could get out to the entire\nUnited States and there's probably\npeople out there that are listening that\nhave Schools they're either part of a\nschool they're a teacher they're a\nprincipal maybe there's people that are\nheads of school districts and so if they\nread it first off I think the important\nthing is just buy it for yourself and\nread it and then if it changes your life\nthen you're going to go [ __ ] I should\nactually bring this to everyone else\nwhich is exactly what happened with that\nprinciple which I think is important um\nlast thing I want to I want to bring up\nis something that was that was really\nlife-changing for me and it's it's on\ntopic but a little bit off topic and um\nand I remember years ago you used to\nhave bracelets and I used to have the\nbracelets and uh and I want you to tell\na story just for people because I I\nthink this is a really good way to wrap\nup and just have people understand of\nwhere it came from the whole 5minute\nrule everything they came along with it\nand uh cuz I think it was a story of you\nbought a new car right like that's\nthat's how the whole thing came up in\nthe first place you had a new car and\nthen some things happen with it and then\nyour wife who was I think it's your\ngirlfriend at the time was like why are\nyou not more pissed off so I don't want\nto give the whole thing away which is\nwhy I'm being very vague in it but can\nyou tell that story and um and kind of\nwhat you learned from it because I think\nit's really important people to listen\nto and go oh man like I can implement\nthis into my day immediately yeah first\npart I'm not sure what story you're\ntalking about the one where you were\ndriving you were driving your car it was\nyour your dream car right and didn't you\nget into a car accident and your wife\nwas like I yeah you know that one is\nthat I know your stories listen you've\nbeen in a few car accidents So for\nanybody who doesn't know how's story cuz\nthis we didn't talk about it all like\nyou've already been dead before which is\ncrazy you've been in a coma you've been\ntold you weren't going to walk you got\npast all of that and so that's a whole\nother thing that we didn't even have\ntime to go into today but it was it was\nthe idea of of the F minute Rule and\ncan't change it and and just sharing how\npeople can take that into their day\ntoday so one of the most important\nlessons I've ever learned yeah it's\ncalled the five minute Rule and I I also\ncall it the can't change it philosophy\num and it started when I was in sales uh\nwe learned on our second day of training\nat Cutco where we've had our our history\nuh but my manager essentially said sales\nis a microcosm for life in terms of\nadversity yeah he said most people face\nrejection every once in a while you know\nrarely he said you're going to face it\nlike every day multiple times a day all\nthe and you have to have a tool to deal\nwith rejection with failure so on and so\nforth he said so when things don't go\nyour way most people they dwell on it\nthey get upset it ruins their day it\nruins their week it ruins their month or\neven people are suffering we're many of\nus are suffering over things that\nhappened like a decade ago we were\nchildren right like the trauma that we\nexperienced so on and so forth and so he\nsaid you need a tool you need a strategy\nto move through adversity quickly\nmentally and emotionally so you can just\nkeep going right and he taught us the\nfive minute role and he said when\nsomething goes wrong and again this was\nin the context of you know someone\ncanceling their order or not showing up\nto an appointment or you're not reaching\nyour goal for the week but I ended up\napplying this to the biggest most\nlifethreatening seemingly insurmountable\nchallenges I ever faced from my car\naccident to cancer and so on and so\nforth and I use it in traffic every day\nand you've had cancer too God you've had\nso much [ __ ] you've gone through and\nyou're lot you've died you've been in a\ncoma you've had cancer so so almost died\na few times so this is important like as\nas you're going into it so you have been\ndead for 6 minutes right so you're dead\nfor 6 minutes you were in a coma you a\nfew years ago I completely forgot you\nhad cancer overcame cancer and it's a\nvery rare form of cancer that not a lot\nof people live from right it's like I\nwas given a 20 to 30% chance of\nsurviving super low and so you can if if\nsomebody can can do it and like their\nboss is an [ __ ] and something happens\nthey can use this in their life you use\nthis for like the biggest events that\nhappen and so I just want to bring that\nin for people to understand like you\nactually truly live this way yeah this\nis whether you are using this to deal\nwith traffic and not letting it bother\nyou basically it's how to not let\nanything outside of you affect your\ninternal State that's what this is right\nand and and you can apply it and I I\nkind of feel like God has put me through\nthese life-threatening experiences\nchalleng to make so that most people can\nbe like okay all right if he was hit by\na drunk driver found dead at the scene\ntold he would never walk and broke 11\nbones in this work to not let that\nbother him yeah yeah and then had cancer\nhad cancer and did it again like okay I\ndon't really I don't have anything going\non that's too much worse than that right\nso um so the five-minute Ro again taught\nin training and he said when something\ngoes wrong you set your timer for five\nminutes on your phone and you give\nyourself five minutes to fully\nexperience the emotions that are coming\nout for you if you're angry if you're\nsad if you're frustrated if you're if\nyou feel hate whatever it is you give\nyourself five minutes to fully Express\nand feel those emotions don't suppress\nthem which is what some of us will do\nright so we either dwell on them\nindefinitely Or we suppress them and\nthen they come out sideways later either\nas cancer or yelling at our spouse or or\nwe get depressed or whatever and it's\nbecause all the it all pin up so 5\nminutes and you feel your emotions and\nwhen I first first learned that I was\nlike 5 minutes isn't long enough like I\nneed longer right and so he said after\nthe 5 minutes go off you say three\nreally powerful words and that's what\nthat wristband that you mentioned used\nto say can't change it can't change it\nit's acknowledgement\nokay I can't change what happened five\nminutes ago so right now I have a choice\nI can continue to dwell on it and be\nupset about it it doesn't change\nanything it just messes up my mental and\nemotional state or I can accept life\nexactly as it is I can go okay can't\nchange it it happened I'm going to\naccept it I might not be happy about it\nbut I'm going to be at peace with it\nbecause what other choice do I have and\nso the other it's either I'm upset I\ncontinue that or I'm I accept it and I\ncan just move on MH and so when I first\nlearned it I'm like 5 minutes isn't long\nenough and the first time I remember\nthis lady like didn't show up to her\nappointment and I was like I set my\ntimer for 5 minutes I'm I'm bitching and\nmoaning and stewing I'm like I can't\nbelieve she didn't show up I drove like\n40 minutes to get here I needed that\nappointment and timer goes off I'm like\ndude I'm still pissed like right so I\nwas like Justified I'm like see 5\nminutes isn't long enough but here's the\ncrazy thing that happened after I did it\nfor probably it was only like a week\nwhich was multiple times a day right 5\nminute roll 5 minute roll 5 minute roll\nand I got I was able to accept it faster\nand faster and faster and I literally\nremember it was about a week or two\nafter I started practicing the F minute\nroll and this woman canceled her order\nand it was the biggest order I'd ever\ngotten it it was the last day before\norders were due so I had no chance to\nmake it up it allowed me to not only\nreach my goal but become number one in\nthe office so I was like celebrating\nthat day I called my parents like Mom\nDad I was only 19 I'm like I just\nreached my go I'm the number one rep in\nthe office they're going to acknowledge\nme on on Wednesday at the team meeting I\ngoing to win like a trophy like it's you\nknow I was so excited and she calls that\nnight at 9:00 p.m. she like I'm so sorry\nmy husband came home he was mad I have\nto cancel the order oh my God I'm like\ndevastated and I set the timer for 5\nminutes at that point it was like second\nnature I whenever I felt emotional\nturmoil I would set the timer and I\nremember I was like I can't believe she\ncanceled it like I I'm not it and I'm\nnot going to get recognized I'm not you\nknow and I'm like this sucks this sucks\nlike what am I going to do I'm like the\nonly thing I can do is I can just you\nknow accept it and get on the cuz I\nalready practiced accepting what I\ncouldn't change so I literally I'm not\njoking I can remember it I'm like what\nelse can I do I I get to accept it and\nmove on and I pick up my phone and look\nat the timer and there's 4 minutes and\n32 seconds left so 28 seconds and I'm\nlike what's the point of me continuing\nto dwell on something that I can't\nchange and and this is an important\ndistinction I realize that every painful\nemotion we experience is self-created\nand perpetuated by our resistance to\nreality it's wishing that thing didn't\nhappen 5 minutes ago and the degree that\nwe resist it and wish it didn't happen\nand say it's unfair and we didn't\ndeserve it all that's not changing it\nit's just causing and perpetuating and\nfostering that emotional turmoil Y and\nso I went what's the point in in being\nupset for the next 4 and a half minutes\nwhen I could just accept it go relax\nand get on the pH tomorrow and in that\nmoment I realized oh not only is 5\nminutes enough time I'm not going to\never waste 5 minutes again being upset\nand I remember the distinction I'm like\nI'm going to do the 5sec rule give me 5\nSeconds to be like mother never you know\nand then be like well I can't change it\nI'm moving on and and so a year and a\nhalf later I woke up from a coma and I\nwas told I'm never going to walk again\nand I'll be honest it didn't take 5\nminutes it took like a few days of like\nprocessing this that one takes time but\nit took right like but to be fair\nliterally a few days and the doctor\nstarted saying they brought my parents\nin they're like we think how's in denial\nhe's like really happy and he seems\njovial like everything's okay we believe\nthat he can't handle his new reality and\nso my parents approached me and they're\nlike the doctors think you can't handle\nit and they said you need to face the\nemotions I'm like no I can't change that\nI was in a car accident and I said if\nI'm in a wheelchair the rest of my life\nguys I've decided not guys Mom and Dad I\nsaid I've decided I'm going to be the\nhappiest most grateful person you've\never seen in a wheelchair because I\ncan't change that I'm in a wheelchair\nbut I can choose my inner experience\nit's amazing and I only have one life\nand I'm going to enjoy every moment and\nthe day I was diagnosed with cancer and\ngiven a 20% chance of surviving it was\nlike I there wasn't even I didn't even\nneed five minutes you know and there\nwere for sure times I cried you know\nover the next few over the next year\nthinking about what if I die and my I'm\nnot here for my kids like for sure like\nit's not about like oh just everything's\nfine right right feel the but here\nhere's what it is let me this is\nwrapping tying a bow on this lesson it's\nabout being able to choose the emotional\nstate that best serves you at any given\nmoment no matter what's happening and\nsometimes it is\ngrieving sometimes it is feeling the\nfear so you can actually imagine what do\nI need to do to prevent the thing that\ncould happen that could cause that fear\nbecoming a reality right so for me being\nafraid of dying and leaving my kids\nwithout a dad that got me to do three\ncoffee enimas a week and take 70\nsupplements and do lymphatic massage and\nozone sauna and organic vegan raw diet\nlike dude I went all in on every\nholistic practice known to man and\nthat's why I'm still alive I believe not\nCU I did chemo but because I did\neverything that the doctors didn't tell\nme to do yeah that would support my\nliver and my immune system and detoxify\nme and you know and my mental
