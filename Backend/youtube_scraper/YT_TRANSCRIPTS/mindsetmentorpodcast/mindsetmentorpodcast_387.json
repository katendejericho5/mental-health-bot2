    "transcript": "do you have people around you that you\nlove and that you truly want to help\ngrow well in today's video we're going\nto be talking about the five best ways\nto bring out the best in people let's\ndive in this is for anybody who's out\nthere who is a leader someone who is a\nparent somebody who might be apparent in\nthe future someone who has significant\nothers someone who interacts with other\nliving breathing human people this is\nreally going to help you out with\nbringing out the best in the people that\nare around you and uh you know I think\nthe last tip is probably the most\nimportant one so I saved the best for\nlast but we'll go through number one\nthrough five uh in order uh number one\nthe first thing that I want you to try\nto start doing more around people is to\nfind reasons to recognize people versus\nreasons to reprimand them um in case you\ndidn't know there was a study that was\ndone years ago and they found out that\nthe average child is reprimanded eight\ntimes more than they're\npraised the average child growing up\nfrom their parents for those of you guys\nthat are parents who want to be parents\nare reprimanded eight times more than\ntheir praise which means that the\naverage person the average child growing\nup thinks I'm not good enough I'm not\nsmart enough I can't figure this out\neight times more than they think I've\ngot this under control and so really we\ntend to if we're being honest we tend to\nlove people the way that we were loved\nas a child and so if your parents were\nthe same where they reprimanded you and\ntold you what not to do and told you\nthings that you weren't supposed to be\ndoing and you felt like maybe you were\nreprimanded more what we tend to if we\nlove other people is we tend to\nreprimand them in some sort of way\ninstead of actually recognizing them so\ninstead of finding what's wrong why\ndon't we try to find out what's right\nwith people why don't we try to look for\nthe things that someone is doing well\nyou know like say for instance your\nhusband doesn't do the dishes wouldn't\ndo those damn dishes right instead of\nyelling at your husband every single\ntime that he doesn't do the dishes\nbecause when you yell at your husband\nfor not doing the dishes you are\nactually strengthening in him being a\nperson who doesn't do the dishes and\nhe's being reprimanded the same way that\nhe was reprimanded by his parents so he\nfeels the way he's always felt if you're\ntrying to break him out of what he's\nalways done next time he puts one dish\naway a single dish say thank you why\nbecause people want to be recognized\npeople want to be seen and what happens\nis instead of being yelled at and\nthinking that and this is big for not\njust people who are like oh I need to\nget my husband to do the dishes\nrecognizing your children for when they\ndo something right versus when they do\nsomething wrong what you want to do and\nthis is I mean this is literally the\nexact same way that you train a dog like\nwe when I we took our dog a couple years\nago when we got him when he was a puppy\nto go in in you know he had like 12\ndifferent classes he had to go to and\nwhat she said is don't recognize him\ndon't reprimand him when he does\nsomething wrong recognize him and give\nhim a treat and get excited whenever he\ndoes something right because that dog\nwill want more of that love from you\nit's the exact same way with humans it's\nthe same way that we train a dog we\nshould be training ourselves should be\ntraining humans and so people want to be\nrecognized they want uh positive\nfeelings they want good energy and so\ninstead of yelling at someone for doing\nsomething wrong whenever they do\nsomething right what you want them to\ncontinue to do in some sort of way\nrecognize them and it sounds crazy to be\nlike oh my God honey you put a fork away\nbut if you just recognize people what I\nwant you to get from it is just\nrecognize people when they do something\nright more often and what is really\ninteresting is that with positive\nreinforcement it always works better\nthan negative reinforcement and it makes\nsense when you really start to think\nabout it and it really makes them want\nto seek more positive reinforcement\nagain and so subconsciously I think well\nhey my mom my my my mom really\nrecognized me last time I did this I\nlike feeling recognized maybe I should\ndo this again or you know my my husband\nor my my wife really recognized me last\ntime I did this it felt good to be\nrecognized and to get love from her so I\nwant to do this thing again and so start\nto actually try to work through positive\nreinforcement more than negative\nreinforcement which is a a little bit of\na change for most of us because most\npeople on this Earth uh were raised with\nnegative reinforcement so let's try to\nbreak that cycle so that's the first one\nthe second thing I want you to do is you\nknow obviously if you're you're finding\nreasons to recognize them if possible\noffer public recognition when you can as\nwell I mean I don't want if if you have\nyou know Christmas coming up and the\nfamily comes over I don't want you be\nlike oh my gosh George put a fork away I\ndon't want you to do that cuz that's\ngoing to actually seem like a backhanded\ncompliment right but offer public rec\nrecogition in some sort of way the\nfamily's over and you love that your\nwife has been doing XYZ and she's been\nworking really hard to get her master's\ndegree well when the family comes over\nyou know in some sort of way can you\nthrow in like make it natural not forced\nU because if it's forced it could seem\nreally condescending but it's like oh my\ngosh yeah I'm so proud of her she's been\ndoing so well she's been she's been\njuggling being a mother and going to\nwork and getting her master's degree and\nI'm so proud of her for it right like\nmake it natural and and Don't Force It\nDon't Like find a way to do it but just\nsee if you can get it to flow into\nconversations you know don't don't make\nan announcement when your child takes\nout the trash that seems very\ncondescending but really what it comes\ndown to is how can you just get better\nat recognizing people to their face and\nthen the second one is how can you get\nbetter at recognizing people when other\npeople are around and and really what it\ncomes down to is people love to be\nrecognized and you will you know the\ntitle of this episode is how to bring\nout the best in people you will bring\nout the best in somebody if you're\nrecognized in the best parts of them\nbecause they will want to they are now\naware more aware of the best parts of\nthem and they're going to actually start\nto bring that out to the world a bit\nmore you know in in uh in my company\nevery All Hands meeting that we have we\nend every single All Hands meeting with\nabout 10 to 15 minutes and and what we\nsay at the end of them is hey who has\nsomeone that they want to recognize in\nthe\nteam who you know whether they they\nhelped you out or they did something\nright whether you've seen their energy\nbeen great or the way they've been\nshowing up for the company or for you or\nfor each other or for themselves who has\nsomebody that they want to recognize and\nwe just allow it just to free flow and\neverybody can unmute themselves on zoom\nand start recognizing people and the\nreason why is because people love being\nrecognized uh they live being recognized\nfor what they do they love being\nrecognized for who they are and really\nthat allows us to to see the you know\nwhen we're recognized it allows us to\nsee the better parts of ourselves\nbecause all too often most people are\nthinking about the the quote unquote bad\nparts of themselves and what they don't\nlike so allows us to kind of shine light\non the good parts of ourselves and the\ngood parts of other people okay number\nthree so that's number two number one is\nnumber one is obviously to recognize\nthem um find reasons to recognize them\nversus reasons to reprimand and the\nsecond one is offer public recognition\nwhen you can the third one is to be a\nmodel for the way that you want them to\nbe and so if we're looking at your\nchildren for instance you can't tell\nyour children that um you know they\nshould be more calm when you have a\ntemperature T like a a temper\ntemperature you have a temper problem\nright if you have a short fuse you can't\nget mad at your children for not being\nas calm as you want them to be and so a\nlot of times it's uh it's funny when I\npost something on Instagram almost every\nsingle post I put on Instagram somebody\nsays in some sort of way easier said\nthan done and I'm like yes of course\neverything in this world is easier said\nthan done and so it's easier to tell\nsomeone to be a certain way it's harder\nto be that way but if you want someone\nto to be the best version of themsel\nwhat does it look like for you to be the\nbest version of yourself and for you to\nbe the lighthouse because all too often\nwe're not being the lighthouse and if\nyou've never heard the the phrase before\nbe the lighthouse you know if you look\nat a lighthouse and you look at a\ntowboat you look at a tugboat the two of\nthose right both of them do the exact\nsame thing both of them get boats into\nthe harbor safely the way they do it is\nincredibly different right so the first\none is the the tugboat it goes out to\nthe other boats and it pulls them and it\nuses all of its energy and it forces the\nother boats to get into the harbor\nit gets them into the harbor but it does\nit a lot differently than a lighthouse a\nlighthouse stands in its place it shines\nand it does exact knows what it's\nsupposed to do it knows who it's\nsupposed to be and does exactly what\nit's supposed to do but it still gets\nthe boats into the harbor safely and so\nwhen they say being the lighthouse it\nmeans why don't you model the way that\nyou want other people to be why don't\nyou model instead of saying hey like a\nlot of times when people get into\nself-development they start trying to\nforce their spouse and their children\ninto self-development they buy them\nbooks they them conferences and all this\nstuff but in reality what's going to\nmake somebody want to get in\nself-development around you is by seeing\nyou change into the best version of\nyourself and then they go huh man they\nlook really happy I want I want someone\nwhat they have they look like they're\nreally peaceful I've been kind of\nstressed out recently maybe I should ask\nthem what they're doing so it's not a\nforce thing it's a hey I'm just going to\nbe the best version of myself and\nhopefully that inspires other people to\nbe the best as well um because all too\noften I get so many messages of like hey\nI'm new into personal development in the\npast 6 months I've been trying to get my\nhusband to be in it with me and he's I'm\nbuying him books and I'm telling him he\nneeds meditate and he's just resisting\nit he's making fun of it I'm like yeah\nbecause he needs to see the changes in\nyou the same way that if you saw haven't\nseen a friend six months and you see\nthem and they're like 30 pounds lighter\nyou're going to say oh my God you look\namazing what have you been doing what\nhave you been doing that's basically\nwhat you want other people to say with\nyou say to you by how you work on\nyourself so you have to be the\nlighthouse you have to in essence you\nknow Gandhi said it you have to be the\nchange that you want to see in the world\nbe the change that you want to see in\nother people be the change that you want\nto see in your children be the changes\nyou want to see in your spouse in your\nfamily you know if if you're not that\nchange and you're not the lighthouse\nyou're not the perfect version of it\nit's going to go in one ear and out the\nother oh Dad's telling me to try to have\nnot have a temper problem he's the one\nthat's freaking crazy they're not going\nto listen to you so you have to be a\ngood example of the advice that you give\nso that's number three number four give\npeople more autonomy whether it is in\nyou know your children whether it's in\nyour company whether it's in your spouse\njust give people more autonomy stop\nmicromanaging people so much let them\nhave their own power like give them\npower let them find it let them Discover\nIt micromanage micromanaging enables\nthem to always need you and some people\ndon't realize that that's an actual\npsychological condition where you want\nto micromanage your your children so\nthat they always need you so they then\nthey move move out of the house they're\ngoing to always need you and they'll\nnever quote unquote fully leave you\nright micromanaging enables them to\nalways feel like they need you by\nallowing somebody autonomy you're\nletting them build their own confidence\nin themsel which is ultimately what if\nyou truly love somebody whether it's\nyour child whether it's someone that you\nwork with whether it's your spouse you\nshould want them to build confidence in\nthems and to trust them to do what's\nright and trust that they will 100% m\nmess up at some point in time but\nwhatever they mess up on is what they\nwere supposed to learn and whenever you\ntry to overstep your boundaries and\nmicromanage people so that they don't\nmess up you're then pulling the lesson\nfrom them that they were supposed to\nlearn think about that you're getting in\nthe way and you know you can you can\nstill offer feedback to people I'm not\nsaying don't give feedback and don't try\nto help but there's also even better\nways to offer feedback like there's a\nthing called the feedback sandwich which\nis when you when you tell somebody that\nyou want to give them feedback and they\nmight negative feedback well the\nsandwich is this it's it's good it's bad\nit's good so you offer one thing hey I\nreally love you've been doing XYZ and\nyou you say a good thing one thing\nthough if I could give you a piece of\nadvice on something I think needs to\nchange that's the bad but this is\nsomething else I really love about you\nthat you've been doing so it's a\nfeedback sandwich recognize what they\ndid well bring in ways that they can\nimprove recognize another thing that\nthey did well but really what it comes\ndown to is can you stop feeling like you\nhave to control everything if you own a\nbusiness one of the things that will\nabsolutely destroy your business is if\nyou don't give people autonomy if you\ndon't uh delegate correctly to people\nand you just have to micromanage every\nsingle piece of the process um it will\ndestroy your company because you can't\nscale if you have to micromanage every\nsingle thing and um you know if you're\nnot a business owner but you're a parent\ndon't micromanage your children allow\nthem to mess up allow them to learn the\nlessons they're supposed to in their\nlife so that's number four and then\nnumber five I promised you was what in\nmy opinion is the best one is don't try\nto change people love them for who they\nare okay people already talk down to\nthemselves enough the I I want there to\nbe a study to find out what percentage\nof people talk down to thems and what\npercentage of them talking TOS is\nnegative and I'm just really curious of\nit I've never seen the study on it but\npeople already talk down to themselves\nenough if you really want to bring out\nthe best in someone learn to love them\nfor who they are you know there's so\nmany people out there that are trying to\nchange their children that are trying to\nchange their boyfriend they're trying to\nchange their girlfriend they're trying\nto change their their parents and\nthey're trying to change their spouse\nthey're trying to change everybody else\naround them versus discovering who is\nthis person cuz if you've ever seen like\nmy sister has four kids right from the\nmoment that they were able to walk they\nwere all extremely different people it\nwasn't like they all came out exactly\nthe same and then they just you know\nsomehow went somewhere else it was like\nthey came out and hey they were just\ncompletely different people and so all\ntoo often is we see this different\nperson maybe you have one kid that's\nreally calm and really chill and really\nand they have the other one that's kind\nof crazy well don't try to make the\ncrazy one like the calm one try to just\nsee if there's a way that you could\nbring out the best version of them\nbecause all too often we want people to\nbecome the best version of what we want\nthem to be that's not what they're here\nto do this person is not here for you\nyou know if you look at your children\nyour children aren't here for you they\ncame here through you and so it's not\nyour job to make them what you want them\nto be give them some Grace and\nallow them to to be who they can be and\nlove them for who they truly are don't\ntry to quote unquote fix them cuz fixing\nthem is ridiculous that's you trying to\ncontrol somebody and make someone what\nyou want them to be really what it is if\nyou take a step back and you think about\neach specific relationship that you have\nwith people you start saying like who is\nthe true version of them what is what is\nit that makes them amazing what is it\nthat makes them great and how can I love\nand recognize that part of them even\nmore so that they step more into that\nversion himself cuz all too often a lot\nof us we're just lost we're trying to\nfigure out our we're all just fumbling\naround in the dark trying to figure out\nwhat the hell we're doing as humans here\nright and so if we have someone that's\ntrying to fix us and change us and fix\nus and change fix us and change us all\nthe time it's just making us more\nconfused but if we have someone that\ncomes in and they says hey you know I\nwant to recognize you I want to love you\nfor who you are and I want to to\nbasically just be here for you and and\nhold space it allows that person to\ndiscover who they truly are who they\nwant to be and to to make it feel safe\nfor them to step into who they truly\nwant to be versus feeling like they have\nto be pushed into being somebody else so\ndon't don't try to change people try to\nlove them for who they actually truly\nare so those are my five tips to make\npeople better number one um to make\nbring out the best in people number one\nis to find reasons to recognize versus\nreasons to reprimand number two offer\npublic recognition when you can number\nthree be a model for the way that you\nwant them to be number five give them\nmore autonomy and number I'm sorry\nnumber four give them more autonomy and\nnumber five uh don't try to change them\nlove them for who they truly are so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Jr r o b d i a
