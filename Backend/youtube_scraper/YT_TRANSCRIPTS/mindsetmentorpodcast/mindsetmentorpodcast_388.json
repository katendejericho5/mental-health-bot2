    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto give you a secret to success I'm\ngoing to help you figure out a way to\nmake success make your life make\neverything that you want easier and less\nstressful let's dive in and I want to be\nreal with you life can be really hard\nlike let's just be real life life is\nit's amazing it's torture sometimes it's\nbeautiful it's fun it can suck um but it\ncan be really hard sometimes and\nmore than anything else it is a journey\nthat we're on and throughout this\njourney we we do some things right we do\nsome things wrong we get better we take\na step forward we take two steps back\nall of that but at some point all of us\neveryone listening to this podcast and\nmyself included at some point we all get\nto the point where we wake up we have\nwoken up in some sort of way and we we\nlook around our lives and we think about\nour lives and we realize that there is\nmore for us in some sort of way there's\nmore for for us there's more happiness\nthere's more joy there's more money\nthere's more peace there's more for us\nto be able to there's more experiences\nthere's more traveling there's more\neverything and we look at what we\ncurrently have and we say there's more\nfor me and if I want more I have to be\nthe person to work on myself if I want\nmore of the good things and less of the\nbad things less of the stress less of\nthe anxiety if I want more we get to the\npoint where we realize I have to be\ndifferent we discover that we have to\nevolve and I use the word evolve very\nspecifically I don't want to use the\nword become better because actually when\nI wrote out this podcast I wrote this\nbullet point I put become better and\nthen I deleted it and actually wrote\nmust evolve because better for me to\nthink to myself right now for you to\nthink to yourself right now I must\nbecome better better implies worse which\nmeans that as you currently are there's\nsomething wrong with you you're\ncurrently worse you're not worse you're\nnot there's nothing wrong with with you\nas you currently are you are exactly\nwhere you need to be the exact moment\nbut what you need to do is you need to\nevolve you're either green or growing or\nyou're Brown and dying and we need to be\ngreen and growing or else we're not\ngoing anywhere we're stagnant now I\ndon't know about you I don't want to\nfeel stagnant in my life but we want we\nif we want to have more joy more money\nmore love more peace more happiness more\neverything then we know that we must\nevolve as people and when you first\nstart on the Journey of self-development\nit's exciting\nyou're like I can't wait to improve\nmyself I can't wait to evolve I can't\nwait to get more to have more fun to\nhave more money to buy more cool to\nhave more happiness to have more love to\nbe a better person and then what happens\nis you go from this moment of living\nyour entire life mostly unaware and\nhaving almost no self-awareness to now\ntransitioning to this moment of having\nself-awareness and we what that\nself-awareness really truly is is you\nare now self aware of all of the\nthat needs to change and all of the\nstuff that needs to go and all of the\nstuff that needs to evolve and you start\nseeing all of your flaws and the things\nthat you need to work through and all\nthat and you're like oh my God it's too\nmuch this is a lot and what happens is\nyou go from being unconscious and\nunaware of yourself to now being aware\nand seeing all of your flaws and and\nsometimes judging yourself and shaming\nyourself and guilting yourself and now\nwhen you screw up you're aware of that\nscrew up and think to yourself man I was\naware of this I shouldn't have done this\nI shouldn't have follow into this this\npit cuz I know I do this and the way I\nlike to think about it is uh there's a\nBuddhist metaphor and they basically say\nlike imagine that you're at your\ngrandparents house right and your\ngrandparents haven't opened the attic in\n30 years and you decide that you want to\ngo into the attic and you go up into the\nattic and you look and there's a mirror\nthat you see in the attic and the mirror\nis just covered in dust and you want to\nsee how clear this mirror is you want to\nsee yourself in the mirror so you take\nyour hand and you start brushing away\nall of the dust and as you're brushing\naway all this dust to see yourself\nthere's all this dust that comes into\nyour face and you're coughing and you're\nsneezing and all of this dust is coming\nup in order for you to see your true\nself that metaphor is basically the\nexample of in order to you've gone\nthrough this life unconscious to a lot\nof different things but really what\nhappens is now you're starting to you're\nwanting to see your true self and in\norder to see your true self you have to\nget rid of all the stuff that is not you\nall of the dust and in fact I want you\nto realize this all of that stuff that\nis that's coming up all the things that\nyou're now aware of I want you to\nunderstand this there is nothing wrong\nwith you there's nothing wrong with you\nthe journey that you are on in your life\nis perfect for you it is absolutely\nperfect your life is a perfectly crafted\ncurriculum for you to go through what\nyou need to go through to learn whatever\nit is that you're here to learn on this\nplanet your your journey is designed for\nyou and is far more intelligent than you\ncan possibly understand so I want you to\nunderstand that where you are is perfect\nand in the circumstance you you are\ncurrently are you're currently in is\nabsolutely perfect for you but where I\nsee a lot of people go wrong and this is\nwhere I went wrong for years probably\nabout a decade and this is the the\nreally really big secret that I'm going\nto share with you today on\nself-development and improving yourself\nand you know\nbecoming a more invol evolved version of\nyourself where I see most people go\nwrong and where I went wrong for decades\nis trying to add things so we think I\nwant to improve myself I need to add new\nhabits I need to make sure that I wake\nup at 5:00 a.m. every single day and\nhave 40 things to do on my morning\nroutine checklist and I need to go to\nthe store and I need to buy every single\nself-help book that I possibly can and\nread the first 12 pages and then go to\nthe next one and read another 12 or 13\npage and then go to another one never\nfully actually finish a page and I need\nto go to conferences and I need to do\noff and all of these are great I mean\nI've done all of them I've done the the\nmorning routines the checklist the pried\n400 self-development or business books\nor mindset books or neurology books in\nmy lifetime and all of it is great and\nall of it's important but I want to tell\nyou that the secret to self-development\nthat took me over a decade to realize is\nthat self-development is not about\naddition self-development is about\nsubtraction and I didn't know this for\nyears I didn't know it it's subtracting\nall of the things from your life before\nadding anything else to it you know and\nand what I want you to realize is that\nwhen you look at it and you think about\nthis you realize self-development is\nabout subtraction you start asking\nyourself what do I need to subtract I\ndidn't know this for years a decade I\nhad way more\nknowledge than I ever had I had all\nthese books that I read I had done all\nkinds of stuff stuff but I felt the same\ninside of myself and the secret to\nself-development is doing less it's\nremoving things from your life before\nyou add anything to your life I didn't\nknow this for a very long time and so\nyou look at your life and you say well I\nwant to evolve AKA get better I want to\nget better in some sort of way and once\nagain I'm I'm using that lightly because\nonce again better implies worse but I\nwant to get better I want to evolve I\nwant to become a different version of\nmyself what are the things that I need\nto\ndo and we start thinking about the stuff\nwe need to add to our lives and the new\nhabits and the new working out every\nsingle day and all the stuff that we\nneed to do when in reality the very\nfirst thing we need to do is remove a\nlot of from our lives and we need\nto basically pull the weeds it's like\nyou're walking up to a garden you know\nif you're 27 years old 37 years old and\nyou're listening to this let's say\nyou're 37 and you're now becoming aware\nof yourself and starting to work on\nyourself it's like you have a garden\nthat's been sitting there by itself for\n37 years if you're going to try to to to\ncreate a brand new perfect garden in\nthat place what do you have to do first\nyou have to pull out 37 years of weeds\nand so when it's another way of thinking\nabout is like when your computer gets a\nvirus it has a virus you don't add a\nbunch of programs to it and hope that\nthose programs remove the virus no what\ndo you do you say oh my gosh my computer\nhas a virus you to identify the virus\nand then remove the virus as quick as\npossible so that the the computer can\nget back to its normal working order\nit's the same thing for you you need to\nremove the viruses from your mind you\nneed to remove the viruses from your\nlife you need to uninstall the programs\nthat are holding you back from being the\nperson that you could possibly\nbe and I'm going to say something that's\nreally uh surprising I think to some\npeople and some of you are going to\nquestion whether there's the validity of\nit um but success is not\nhard it's not I struggled for years to\ntry to get to what I thought successful\nmeans and whatever success means to you\nit could be could be business it could\nbe money it could be marriage it could\nbe relationship with your children all\nof that stuff whatever success means to\nyou and success can mean all of those\nthings none of them are hard success is\nnot hard I want you to understand this\nas a human on this Earth as a a living\nbreathing sentient being success and all\nthat it is is natural to be a human\nmeans to think something and to be able\nto create into reality that's that is\nwhat is natural for us but you have too\nmany shitty programs running that it's\nin the way of everything and this is\nwhat I came to rise for years is that I\nwas I was trying to force my way and\nWhite Knuckle my way and put 110 hours a\nweek into being successful when really I\njust had to take a step back ask myself\nif I was in alignment with my true\npurpose and what I felt like I should be\ndoing and doing what gave me energy and\nthen going down that\nroad success is natural for you the\nproblem is in order to get there we have\nto remove all of the that's in the\nway there's something incredibly\npowerful inside of you that you are\nkeeping covered up and for years you've\nunconsciously been doing this but you\nhave to remove these things and as you\nstart to find these things that need to\nbe removed I promise you this it doesn't\nfeel powerful at first it you start\nnoticing these things you start you\nstart feeling uh at first when you're\nstarting to work these you're not\nfeeling powerful you're feeling angry\nyou're feeling frustrated you're feeling\nsadness you're feeling anxiety you're\nfeeling all the stuff that's in the way\nand that is in the way and that is\nblocking you and all of that stuff are\nthe things that you need to remove in\norder to make yourself be more in\nalignment and make everything much\neasier in your life your power is\ncovered up with all of your\nprogrammingsoftware of your\nconditionings from your childhood all of\nyour dogmas that you've picked up in\nyour lifetime all of these beliefs that\nyou're trying to believe in to being\ntrue but they really don't hold a whole\nlot of weight beliefs in yourself\nbeliefs in everything that that that's\naround you beliefs in other people if\nyou could understand how powerful you\nare it would blow your mind but you have\nall of this that is in the way and\nthat is blocking you from your\npotential the way I like to think of it\nis this and I gave this example a few\nmonths ago but I like to think of it\nlike a river that's flowing if you've\never seen a a nice calm peaceful River\njust flowing that's like your life and\nand to jump in that is to just basically\nbe in the flow of life if you've heard\nthat phrase to be in flow to be in the\nflow of life but when you have all of\nthese these things that you think about\nyourself these negative beliefs this\nnegative patterns of talking to yourself\nthese people who talk down to you toxic\nenvironments that you're stuck in this\njob that you hate you're basically\ntaking a boulder and you're putting it\nin the river and when you take enough B\nBoulders and you put it into a river\nwhat happens it becomes white water\nrapids and it becomes insane it becomes\ncrazy it\nbecomes just everywhere it's\nbasically what it becomes right and so\nit becomes from this nice peaceful River\nto you might drown in this River and\neach Boulder that you put in is just\nsome belief that you're holding on to\nabout yourself and so it's really not\nabout doing more it's about doing less\nit's about removing all of those\nBoulders from your life and when I say\ndoing less I mean way less of what\nyou've been doing\nway less I don't mean sit around on the\ncouch and do nothing now if you're\nsitting around on the couch and you're\nmeditating for an extra four hours a day\nI think that's a great way to use your\ntime but I'm going to assume that most\npeople listening to this podcast are not\ndoing that I'm not saying oh you need to\ndo less and then you need to spend more\ntime on Instagram but I mean doing less\nof the things that are holding you back\ndoing way less of what you've been doing\ndoing way less of what you've been\nthinking doing having you know way less\nof what you believe about the world and\nabout yourself\nand what's really crazy is as you start\ndoing less of those things you start\ngetting more you start getting more\npeace more happiness more joy success\nkind of seems to Flow To You you get\npeople opportunities places things that\ncome into your life that are just fully\naligned and feel right in your life that\nyou just were kind of energetically\nblocking for years you get things that\nthat you You' never thought you could\npossibly have that are just kind of\neffortlessly flowing to you and you need\nto really self-analyze and ask yourself\nwhat do I need to do less of you know\nfor each of these things I'm about to\ntell you in a second for each of these\nthings I want you to ask yourself is it\nhelping me grow into who I want to be\nand you start going through all these\ndifferent categories in your life and\nyou start removing all of the things\nthat are not helping you grow into who\nyou want to be and so for instance um\nthe thoughts in your head are they\nhelping you grow into who you want to be\nthere are some thoughts that that might\nbe helping you grow into who you want to\nbe but there might be some thoughts that\nare actually holding you back from being\nwho you want want to be there's thoughts\nin your head that where you're talking\ntrash to yourself and you're not nice to\nyourself whatever it might be I'm not\ngood enough I'm not smart enough I'm not\nworthy of success I'll never be\nsuccessful because of XYZ because of\nwhat I look like because of my gender\nbecause of what people think about me\nbecause of where I grew up because of my\nfamily and there's all these thoughts in\nyour head you've got to ask yourself\nwith those thoughts in your head are\nthey helping me be who and grow into who\nI want to be then you got to look around\nyou outside of you the people that you\nsurround yourself with are they helping\nyou grow into who you want to be if they\nare certain people keep them if they're\nnot maybe you need to take make a really\ntough decision around that think about\nyou know spending time on your\nphone is it helping you grow into who\nyou want to be who you follow on social\nmedia spending time on Tik Tok is that\nhelping you grow into who you want to be\nor is that something that's just a\nboulder that needs to be removed the job\nyou work is that helping you grow into\nwho you want to be where you live is\nthat helping you grow into where you\nwant to be what you do in your downtime\nis that helping you grow into who you\nwant to be what you consume whether it's\nfood or drugs is that helping you grow\ninto who you want to be the things that\nyou do on your phone and the phone time\nthat you have are those helping you grow\ninto who you want to be video games is\nthat helping you grow into who you want\nto be is Netflix helping you grow into\nwho you want to be and I want you to\nunderstand that before any big\nbreakthrough there must be some sort of\na breakdown almost every single time\nthat I've seen myself and seen clients\nand people I've worked with over 17\nyears now have some sort of big\nbreakthrough there's almost always a\nbreakdown and that breakdown can happen\nto you\njust out of nowhere and that was just\nsomething you're supposed to do or you\ncan start to break down pieces of your\nlife and you can start to say this is no\nlonger serving me I'm not going to allow\nthis to exist in my life anymore and you\nstart to break down things yourself to\nallow a breakthrough to start to come\nthrough and I want to leave you with\nthis question and this thought I guess\nit's a series of questions but really\njust a series of questions that are just\na thought I want you to think about\ntoday when you get down done with\ntoday's podcast episode you can turn\nthis off sit in your car in silence for\nthe rest of the driver and start to\nthink about this what if success was\neffortless for you what if it was what\nif you are the one that is getting in\nthe way of everything that you want what\nif this life doesn't have to be so much\nof a struggle and what do you need to do\nto be more in flow with your life and\nstruggle much less so that's what I'm\ngoing to leave you with today that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories and tag me in\nat Rob dial Jr r o b d i a l j are and\nonce again if you want to get some uh\ninspirational text messages
