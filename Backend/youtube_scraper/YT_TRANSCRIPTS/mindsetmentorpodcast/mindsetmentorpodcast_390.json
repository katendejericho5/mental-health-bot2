    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to have\nmore peace and more happiness in your\nlife let's dive in wouldn't it be nice\njust to wake\nup and just be happy have freedom from\nthe voice that's inside of your head\nfrom the people that are around you that\nare driving you crazy and just wake up\nand just feel happy every day until the\nday that you die would that be nice what\nwhat does that sound like that sounds\nlike it'd be like heaven on Earth right\nI heard uh you know and I really think\nabout it a lot where it's like what is\nit that makes us happy and it seems like\nwe're always searching for something\noutside of oursel to make us happy right\nand what we do is we more than anything\nelse we don't really search for\nhappiness we think that we're searching\nfor happiness we think that we're going\nout there and we're trying to find\nhappiness but a lot of times when you go\nout there and you're trying to say you\nknow what would make me happy if I had\nmore money if I had more money and I\ncould go travel and I could buy things\nthat I want and I could you know get a\nnice car and I could get a nice house\nthen I'd be happier and if I had more\nmoney or if I had other people's\napproval that would make me happier and\nso we get a nice car so people think\nthat we're awesome and we feel better\nabout ourselves for just a little while\nand then after the car loses its luster\nwe feel exactly the same and so then\nsometimes people want to buy things some\nsometimes people want to drink they want\nto do drugs they want to have sex they\nwant to do all these different things\nsearching for happiness more anything\nelse and really what we're doing is\nwe're not really searching for happiness\nin those in those instances what we're\ndoing is we're searching for pleasure so\nif we're out there and we're drinking\nand doing drugs and having sex and you\nknow trying to buy a nice car so we have\nother people's approval and we're trying\nto make more money what we're doing is\nwe're searching for pleasure and\npleasure is not happiness so that\ndoesn't make a whole lot of sense\nbecause happiness is not pleasure\nhappiness is really more than anything\nelse is peace if you wake up and you're\nhappy usually you wake up and you're in\na sense of calmness peace and you're\njust chill you're good throughout the\nday you feel really good and then you\nrealize that more than anything else\nthat a lot of and for me I'm speaking\nfor myself but for years when I was on\nthis this like mad hunt just to make\nmoney and be successful make honey make\nmoney and be successful I thought that\nall that stuff would make me Happ and I\nthink a lot of people get to this point\nwhere they they climb this mountain of\nsuccess and money and then they realize\nthat they still feel like the same\n person at the top of that\nmountain you might climb the mountain\nand now you're at the top of the\nmountain but you know you still feel\njust exactly the same as you did you\njust might be in a nicer car nicer house\nnicer clothes more jewelry whatever it\nmight be you know in in a different\ncountry because you can travel but you\nstill feel exactly the same underneath\nthe surface I think honestly and I've\nhad conversations with a lot of very\nsuccessful people around this I think\nthis is why a lot of very successful\npeople they get to be very successful\nand then they either get into full-on\ndepression or some people become\nsuccessful and they kill themselves is\nbecause they actually thought that\nmaking money would make them feel better\nbut in reality it doesn't make them feel\nany different they just happen to have\nmore digits in a a bank account more\ndigits and more digits that are inside\nof their their screen whenever they go\non to Bank of america.com whatever it\nmight be they realize that none of those\nthings actually make us happy money does\nnot buy happiness people always debate\ndoes money by happiness no because\nhappiness is not pleasure happiness\ncomes from peace happiness is a\nbyproduct of Peace of fulfillment and so\nthe only problems that money solves is\nmoney problems money cannot buy peace\nmoney can buy a bunch of it can\ntake you to a different country it can\nbe fun you can have fun with money but\nit's not going to buy you happiness it's\nnot going to buy you peace you can move\nyou know you could become the richest\nperson on Earth and you could move into\nthe mountains away from everyone and\neverything that drives you crazy and you\ncan have the biggest nicest house with\nthe the nicest things and you real still\nrealize that you don't have peace inside\nof your own mind your mind is still as\ncrazy as it was when you were poor and\nnow you're just rich and pissed off so\nif that's the case all of those things\nthat we think will buy us happiness\nwhich really all they do is just buy us\npleasure or get us pleasure what will\nmake us happier then if that stuff\ndoesn't make us happy what makes us\nhappy and really what it comes down to\nis\npeace peace people other people won't\nmake you happy other things outside of\nyou won't make you happy new cars\nclothes house traveling they won't make\nyou happy the only thing that can make\nyou happy is you and so you can make\nyourself happy but you can also start to\nrealize that whatever is disturbing your\npeace is also getting in the way of your\nhappiness and that's really what you\nhave to start to look at what I really\nwant you to start to look at through\ntoday's episode is what is in the way of\nmy peace what externally outside of me\nis in the way of my peace and what\ninternally inside of me is in the way of\nmy peace because if I can get to the\nroot of that peace the root of my\nhappiness I will feel much better and so\nwe must figure fure out what's in the\nway of your peace and so I want you to\nask yourself this question and just see\nwhat comes up for you what is stealing\nmy peace what is it for you what is it\nthat's stealing your\npeace what is it that makes you feel\nless happy that's driving you a little\nbit crazy and then what I want you to do\nas we go through today's episode I'm\ngoing give you a bunch of different\nexamples is as you start to identify\nthings in your life that are in the way\nof your peace that are stealing your\npeace from you you need to have have\nlaser-like Focus to either avoid those\nthings or get rid of those things that\nsteal your\npeace so what stealing your peace let's\ntalk about people for instance there's\nother people in your life that could be\nstealing your peace are there people\nthat are in your life stealing your\npeace are there people who are toxic in\nyour life that just because of fact that\nthey've been around in your life for a\nwhile you feel like you have to keep\nthem around because they're part of your\nhistory you feel they have to be part of\nyour future that's not necessarily the\ncase sometimes people's time with you is\nis over and if they're toxic if they\ntalk down to you if they make you feel\nworse about yourself if they question\nyour selfworth they're probably stealing\nyour peace in some sort of way or\nthey're making it harder for you to find\nthat peace could you could you find\npeace and still be around a shitty\nperson sure you could but it makes a lot\neasier for you just get rid of that\nperson right and so I want you to look\naround I want you to think of your\nenvironment I want you to ask yourself\nare there people in my life that are\nmaking it harder for my life to be\npeaceful and if there are you need to\neither spend less time with them you\nneed to avoid them or you need to make\nthe tough decision to just release them\nin your\nlife okay that's one thing that can be\nstealing your peace what's another thing\nthat can be stealing your\npeace what goes on in your head that's\nanother thing are there things that you\nthink that steal your peace are there\nways that you talk to yourself that\nsteal your peace because what you think\nin your head is actually going to be the\nmain thing that's going to be stealing\nyour your peace more than anything else\nit's like the mediate thing that pops\ninto my head is I I listen to a lot of\nromdas and Romos always says he realized\nthat that it was really hard for him to\nfind peace when he went to New York City\nbecause it was just so crazy all the\ntime and he realized that if he was\nreally going to work on himself he\nneeded to actually move there and be\nthere to try to find his peace now you\nhave to realize that could steal your\npeace being around that but really what\nit comes down to is is the challenge\nthat you want to have for yourself and\nso when you start to think about the\nthings that go on inside of your head\nare there certain narratives that go on\ninside of your head that make you less\npeaceful are there ways that you speak\nto yourself that make you less peaceful\nI am more concerned to be honest with\nyou with what goes on your head more\nthan I am concerned with what you do\nevery single day because if I can figure\nout what's going on in your head like\nwhen I work with Cent it's always what's\ngoing on in your head more than anything\nelse because that is stealing people's\npeace more than anything else what's\ngoing on in your head are you worrying\ntoo much are you constantly worrying all\nof the time because we worry and we\nthink that if we worry that we we\nsomehow are in control of this thing\nthat we worry about like worrying gives\nus a false sense of control that's not\ntrue at all in any sort of way so are\nyou worrying too much about stuff that\ncould be coming up in your future do you\nstress too much what are you worrying\nabout what are you stressing about do do\nyou look at yourself in the mirror and\nyou guilt yourself and you shame\nyourself for not being where you want to\nbe in life yet for not having the body\nthat you want for screwing up and not\nwaking up on time today A lot of times\nthe main thing that's that's stealing\nyour peace is the way that you speak to\nyourself so are you doing that are you\nworrying too much are you stressing too\nmuch are you talking down to yourself\nare you shaming yourself are you\nguilting yourself how do you speak to\nyourself okay that's one thing to ask\nyourself is there maybe a narrative a\nstory or a way that I speak to myself in\nmy head that's stealing my peace\nprobably is what else how about the\nplace that you live is the place that\nyou live the area you live stealing your\npeace well let's talk about first the\nactual place that you live in you know\nif you live in a house and you're have\nyou have three roommates and maybe\nyou're a really clean person and these\npeople are dirty and they're up late at\nnight and it makes it harder for you to\nhave the life that you want to wake up\nearly to be clean to have a morning\nroutine have really good sleep yeah\nthere's a chance that where you live\nmight actually be the problem the house\nthat you live in could be the problem\nbut also the could the city that you\nlive in could be a problem as well for\nyou and once again like I said with\nromdas like you can obviously move to a\ncity that challenges you but let's just\nmake it a little bit easier on ourselves\nlet's get some loow hanging fruit maybe\nthere's a city maybe you you still live\nin the same city that you grew up in\nthere's a part of you it's like I got to\nget out of this freaking City okay maybe\nyou need to move cities you don't have\nto do it today you have to it tomorrow\nbut maybe you can do it the next year\nmaybe the place that you live in is\nstealing your peace maybe the news is\nstealing your peace the news is stealing\npeace for so many people nowadays maybe\nyou're seeing too much news and you're\nstarting to see what's going on and the\nnews is forcing a narrative down your\nhead and you're seeing all the bad\nthat's happening in the world you're\nseeing all of the the the diseases that\ncould be popping up in the future or new\nvariants of things that could be popping\nup or whatever it might be that's\nhappening I don't know what happening in\nthe news cuz I don't watch the news but\nwhatever it might be the news could be\nstealing your piece there was a couple\nyears ago probably back in uh it's back\nin 20 about about early 2021 um I walked\ninto uh a paint store to go get some\npaint because we were painting uh our\ngarage and I was sitting there and I was\nwaiting for them to make the paint and\nthey had a uh a TV show that was on and\nit was what's the best way to describe\nit it was a talk show that had a very\nspecific uh narrative that it wanted to\npush across and this was early 2021 and\nthey were trying to push this narrative\nhardcore and they were showing a whole\nbunch of things that were happening in\nother places and all of it whatever it\nwas I'm going to be as vague as I\npossibly can um because politics is the\nlast thing that I want to talk about and\nI noticed myself for about two minutes\nwatching this this news this talk show\nthat was basically up uh as I was Wai\nwaiting for my paint to be made and I\nleft and I got in my car and I felt like\n and I realized damn I really W I\nwatched like two minutes of that show\nand I get in my car and I feel like\nsome people keep the news on all day\nlong at their job or at their house or\nwhatever it might be so sometimes the\nnews might be stealing your peace and\nyou know for some of you guys for a lot\nof people out there social media is\n destroying your peace the people\nthat you follow is destroying your peace\nyou know what I would recommend is if\nyou know if you want to be on Instagram\nyou want to be on Facebook I would\nrecommend that you go through all the\npeople that you follow and you unfollow\nas many people as you possibly can uh I\nhave unfollowed in the past couple weeks\nhundreds and hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds and hundreds of people on\nInstagram why because I realize that\njust seeing their stories makes me feel\ndifferent and I don't want to you know\nseeing what they're saying and this the\nthe stuff that they're pushing or not\npushing or acting and whatever you know\nDoom and Gloom all of these things I'm\nlike I got to unfollow these people I\nfeel like just by watching People's\nstories when you follow somebody on on\nsocial media\nyou're basically deciding that you're\ngoing to allow that person to be part of\nyour future thoughts about yourself and\nthe world so you've got to be very clear\nof who you want to follow and who you\ndon't want to follow uh Facebook a\ncouple years ago I unfriended like 3,000\npeople because I was like what's the\npoint you know these people yeah I've\nknown them 10 years ago I knew them but\nI'm just going to unfollow people and\nI'm going to be very clear about who I\nwant to follow in how these people are\nbasically going to be molding my mindset\nin the future and so think about that\nthink about the people that you follow\non on Instagram and you know the news\nthat you're that you have as well it's\nlike I saw a quote one time that said\nsome some poor phoneless fool is\nprobably sitting next to a waterfall\ntotally unaware of how angry or scared\nhe's supposed to be it's like ignorance\nis bliss sometimes being away from\nunfollowing as many people as possible\nand not being around as many people as\npossible and then also not watching the\nnews it's like your ignorance makes your\nlife so much better not having to see\nwhatever the people are doing in their\nlives do you really care what someone\nelse is doing in their life just\nunfollow see you later uh what about the\njob that you work the job that you work\ncould be stealing your peace if you're\nwaking up every single day and you're\nworking a job that maybe you don't even\nhate maybe it's okay but it's just an\nunfulfilling job and it's not doing\nanything for the world or doing anything\nfor yourself just forcing yourself to\nthat might be stealing your peace in\nsome sort of way so maybe not having\nenough downtime maybe working too much\nof your job and not in doing you know\nwhen they say you're burnt out usually\nburnt out does being burnt out doesn't\ncome from working too much usually being\nburnt out comes from doing too little of\nwhat you enjoy and so maybe you need to\ndo more of what you enjoy uh another\nthing that could be stealing your peace\ncultural and societal pressures and\nexpectations you know maybe your culture\nyour parents the people that you\nsurround yourself with have very\nspecific expectations and pressures that\nthey put on on you and you feel like you\nneed to meet those pressures and\nexpectation that they have for you yeah\nmaybe do do you you're taking on their\nbeliefs and their expectations and\nyou're putting it on yourself can you\nremove yourself from culture and\nsocietal pressures uh I had a\nconversation with uh with my wife years\nago and she was talking about hey like\nit's you know it's it's unfair because\nmen can look any way that they want to\nand women have to look this way and I\nwas like well do they have to look that\nway or is that just a narrative that you\nhave taken on and she was like no we\nhave to look this way and I was like do\nyou like Are there women who who don't\ndress up Are there women who don't have\nto wear makeup and really what it comes\ndown to is is not making yourself a\nvictim of cultural and societal\npressures and expectations but if you\ndecide that you want to partake in their\nsocietal pressures and stuff it is your\ndecision to do so not a victim of it so\nif it's like we were talking about\nmakeup like I and what I was saying is\nlike yeah if you know don't say that you\nhave to wear it CU you don't have to\nwear it but but if you decide to wear it\nsay that you decide to wear it because\nthat makes you that takes you from being\na victim to putting you into a place of\npower and that's it's your decision and\nso maybe there's you know societal\npressures there's cultural pressures and\nexpectations that you're just like you\nknow what I want to remove myself from\nthis maybe you have parents that were in\nthe U in the military like I've seen a\nlot of people whose parents are in the\nmilitary and they're really freaking\nhard on them you you can remove yourself\nfrom those expectations and those\npressures that your parents put on\nand it's not easy necessarily to do but\nit's a decision where you go I no longer\nwant to partake in this and really what\nit comes down to is you have to have a\nreally low tolerance for things that\nsteal your peace if you want to be\nhappier you've got to get rid of the\n that steals your peace it's not\neasy at first but it becomes easier and\neasier because what you're doing is\nyou're actually building your life the\nway that you want to be you're building\nyour story the way that you want to be\nand your peace is so important to you\nand you protect it so much you say I am\ngoing to protect my peace at all costs\nanyone anything any thought that gets in\nthe way of my peace needs to be out of\nmy life and I will not surround myself\nor put myself in a situation where my\npeace can be stolen and if you do that\nlo and behold you wake up and you'll\njust start to be happier and happier\nevery single day that's the truth behind\nhappiness so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on Instagram\nstories and tag me in at Rob dial Jr r o\nb d i a l Jr
