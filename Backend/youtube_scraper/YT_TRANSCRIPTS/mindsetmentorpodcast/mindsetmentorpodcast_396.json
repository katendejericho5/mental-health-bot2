    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow to have more peace more joy and more\nhappiness in your life let's dive in\ntoday I'm going to talk to you about\nsomething that will make your life so\nmuch easier it will bring so much peace\nto your life and it's very simple but\njust because it's simple doesn't mean\nthat it's easy it's actually very hard\nso it's simple it's not the you're\nyou're going to have the whole grasp of\ntime when we get done here today but to\nactually go and implemented into your\nyour real life is going to be a little\nbit hard and today's going to be a\nreally deep episode we're going to go\nreally deep uh we're going to talk about\nforgiveness today and I want you to\nunderstand this uh you've been\nover in your life in some way I've been\n over in my life in some way and\nto be honest with you it will probably\nhappen again at some point in time in\nour life but what I truly\nbelieve I truly believe that every\nsingle person at their core is good\neveryone is good at their core now could\nthere be a whole bunch of you know mud\nand muck and thrown on on top of\nthat core absolutely but I think that\nany person was born good and they still\nhave that good inside of them it's just\nmight be really hard to find because of\ntheir life circumstances and what they\nhad to go through in their life and I\nbelieve that every person is good and\nevery person is has innocent in them and\nanything that takes them away from\nthat um it's it's the thing that takes\nthem away from that is what makes them\nquote unquote bad it what makes them\nunaware of how they screwed you over it\nmakes them cheat it makes them uh steal\nit makes them do the things that they\nwouldn't necessarily want to do at their\ncore because we don't necessarily stay\ninnocent right we don't stay innocent\nlike we're not the innocent children\nthat we were things happen life happens\ntrauma happens Society happens Instagram\nand seeing where other people's lives\nare and comparison happens uh thinking\nthat money is going to change our our\nthe way we feel about ourselves happens\nwe have all of this stuff happens the\nworld happens it's just part of growing\nup is that we get disconnected from our\ntrue self and I think that all of us in\nthe world all we're searching for is\nreally peace I and not happiness\nhappiness tends to be a byproduct of\nPeace but not happiness specifically\nbecause happiness is a fleeting emotion\nyou could be really happy this morning\nyou're having a great day you have a cup\nof coffee and then you get a call and\nsomebody tells you some bad news and\nthat happiness is gone immediately\nthat's a fleeting emotion peace is a\nstate of being you get that call and\nalthough it make make you feel a little\nbit different you can still have that\nstate of Peace whatever that call might\nbe\nand you cannot have peace like real true\npeace if you see the world and everybody\nin it as guilty as bad if you see\neverybody on the news and you see all\nthe stuff that's happening at all points\nin time there's always something\nhappening whenever you listen to this\nepisode I guarantee there's something\nhappening on the news or somebody that's\ndoing something bad but you can't have\npeace if you see everybody as guilty and\nsee everybody as bad not everybody if\nyou see people as guilty and see people\nas bad and I think the key to unlocking\npiece is to to know that there are good\npeople out there and that everybody good\neverybody is good but they are just lost\nand I'm going to be honest with you\nthere's a lot of people that are lost\nnowadays A lot of people are lost and\nanyone who does any bad towards them\ntowards other people towards any living\nbeing towards the Earth is lost in some\nsort of way and so anybody who does\nsomething quote unquote bad\nis lost from their true self and when I\nsay they're lost from their true self\nthey don't actually know what they're\ndoing they are aware of what they're\ndoing but they're not aware of how lost\nthey are from who they truly are um\nanyone who has hurt you is absolutely\n100% hurting themselves in some sort of\nway because whenever they hurt you they\nare identifying themselves and diggings\ndeeper into the hole of that identity\nanybody who's cheated on you is now\nlooking at thems through the identity of\nI am a cheater and they're they're\ndeepening that hole that they're in they\nare lost and if somebody hurts you in\nsome sort of way or somebody has hurt\nyou in some sort of way to hold\nresentment towards that person only\nhurts us and so now it's not just them\nthat is hurting but it's also us that is\nhurting as well it's like there's a Mark\nTwain quote that says anger and\nresentment is the acid that burns the\nvessel so whenever you hold anger and\nyou hold resentment towards other people\nthat is the acid that's burning the\nvessel that is the thing that is eating\nyou up from the inside so now it's not\njust this person that has done wrong to\nyou and they know they've done wrong to\nyou and now they are identifying\nthemselves as that person who's done\nwrong to you and they're hurting thems\neven more by hurting you but also now\nyou're hurting because you have so much\nanger and resentment towards them for\nsomething as valuable as your health\nthere's no reason to leave anything up\nto chance whether you want to improve\nyour heart rate your cognition your\nmetabolism your sleep your stress levels\nor just your overall health span

houses and steals stuff does not\nwant to do that at their\ncore they don't their true self their\ntrue self and I mean when I say true\nself they've broken away from their true\nself their true self that beautiful\ninnocent little child is who they are at\ntheir core that child that's inside of\nthem does not want to do that that I\nremember years ago I had a a company\nthat I had a franchise with and somebody\num broke in and stole the TV and the uh\nWii that we had if you remember Nintendo\nWii and it was the first time anybody\never like stole something that was\nsignificant as far as price goes for me\nand you know it was probably thousand\nbucks worth of stuff and I was 22 at the\ntime so it was a ton of money to me and\num I remember that night I had to run a\nmeeting and everybody in the room was\nlike\nwhat happened to the TV in the Wei cuz\nwe used to play we used to have fun\nafter meetings all that stuff and I was\nlike you know somebody came in and stole\nit today and they're like well aren't\nyou mad aren't you pissed off and I said\nyou know what that he they don't know\nwhat they've done and they're lost and\nthey probably need it more than me so I\ncan't really be mad at them and by being\nmad at them I'm just holding on to\nsomething that I don't want to hold on\nto and everyone's\nlike okay wow that makes a lot of sense\nand so someone who breaks in houses and\nsteal stuff does not want to do that at\ntheir core it's you know a child who was\nnot raised correctly it's a child who\nwas not loved correctly it was a child\nwho uh has too much fear built into them\nfrom the world or from their parents or\nmaybe they were fully neglected it's\nsomeone that's hurting and when you can\nsee that you can have more peace you\nknow like I don't see the person who did\nit I don't try to look at that I've I've\nbeen I personally have been working with\npeople for so long you know 17 18 years\nat this point that I can see everyone as\nthey are but behind everyone as they are\nI also see the little child who was hurt\nthe hurt child who's behind that the\nhurt child who didn't get the safety\nthat they needed from their mom this\nhurt child who was who was yelled too\nmuch yelled at too much by their their\nparents the one who was neglected\nemotionally or physically or whatever it\nmight be whenever I'm looking at someone\nit's really hard be to be mad at them\nwhen you understand that behind that\nadult is just a child who is hurting and\ndidn't get the love that they needed\nfrom their parents and when you can look\nat it that way it makes it much easier\nto forgive somebody and be at peace now\nI'm not saying that you just you just\nlet everybody step all over you that's\nnot what I'm saying you definitely have\nto have boundaries and you definitely\nhave to you know fight for yourself\nwhenever you need to but what I'm saying\nis if you can start to have the lens of\nthere's a hurt child that's back there\nyou know if somebody cheats on you\nthere's a child who probably didn't get\nlove that they needed from their parents\nand so they're searching for that love\nthrough other people there's a hurt\nchild that's there there's always a hurt\nchild that's the thing that I've come to\nrealize that there's always a hurt child\nyou know someone who cheated on you it\nusually has nothing to do with you but\ntheir lack of love for themselves which\ncame from their lack of love for their\nparents so they have to go search for it\nin someone else it's really a search for\nlove it's a search for acceptance It's a\nsearch for selfworth it is oh I'm only\nworth it whenever I go and and have\nsexual relations with other people\nand so really what it comes down to is\nis there a lot of bad that happens in\nthe world yeah it's all over the\nplace but you have to realize the the\nthe bad comes from people who are lost\nand the world needs more people who are\nfound and there's only in my mind sanity\nand insanity and when I say Insanity I\ndon't mean like insane like clinically\ninsane but sanity is to be in a state\nwhere you do the right thing for\nyourself and you do the right thing for\nothers that's the way that I see it\nsanity is somebody someone who is who is\nin the state of Sanity is someone who\ndoes right for themselves and does right\nfor others and doesn't try to hurt\nthemselves and doesn't try to hurt\nothers insanity is to be unaware of how\nyou hurt yourself and hurt others you\nare unconscious in that that place and\nwhen you hurt others you hurt yourself\nbecause you carry that wrongdoing with\nyou you do and you know that you did\nthat thing that was wrong and now it\nbecomes part of your identity and you\nstart to dig that hole a little bit\ndeeper and so another way that might be\nmight be a way of saying it if you don't\nlike to use a phrase of Sanity or\nInsanity is is love and fear like when\nyou look at love love is sanity to do\nthe right thing for you and to do the\nright thing for others anything that is\nnot love is insanity anything that is in\na place where you're unconsciously\nhurting yourself or unconsciously\nhurting others or consciously hurting\nyourself or hurting others um is\ninsanity you are the you or that person\nis lost they're lost that's what it\ncomes down to everyone is just the way\nthat they are and everyone is doing the\nbest with what they have and I am of the\nbelief that whoever it is if I would\nhave been raised in the exact same body\nas them with the exact same\ncircumstances every single moment of\ntheir life I would probably make the\nexact same situation exact same\ndecisions that they made in certain\nsituations and so if you were in their\nexact same shoes or their exact same\nparents or exact same childhood raising\nyou would make the same choices\nsomeone's actions is always of\nreflection of their\nconscious you know and like if you look\nback like one of the things I love to do\nis I love to look back at like ancient\ntexts all of the ancient texts and like\none of the ones that we can reference\nhere is if you think of like Jesus for\ninstance whether you believe the story\nhappened or not doesn't matter but\nreally what it comes down to is when you\nlook at the story itself he's literally\nbeing murdered and he says forgive them\nFather for they know not what they're do\nthey forgive them for they know not what\nthey do or what they're doing right and\nso it's like he sees in that moment\nthese people are conscious these people\nare lost forgive them because they're\nlost he can see in that moment a hurt\nchild someone who is disconnected from\nwho they truly are that is going and\nhurting him because of it he could see\ntheir past actions and their current\nactions as not being conscious they were\nnot sane a sane person would not do\nthose actions and so what it comes down\nto and there's I mean there's story\nafter story after story that are ancient\ntexts that have stories like this right\nour truest\nself if we can look at it and not be\ntriggered by other people or at least be\ntriggered then take a step back and say\nokay can I see this with a new set of\neyes or and see it through like our true\nself like our true self our deep core\nwho is that little innocent child that's\nfilled with love our truest self would\nsee a sick person that's in need of\nhealing right this person that just\n me over this person tried to\nsteal from me this person that broke\ninto my house is a sick person in need\nof healing like I remember seeing a\nvideo one time of a lady who uh whose\nson was a teenager and her son was\nmurdered by another kid and in the\ncourtroom she goes up and she gives him\na hug and she says I forgive you and the\nkid starts crying and he she says I\nforgive you because you don't know what\nyou've done you you weren't conscious at\nthat moment she's like if you need\nanything I will be here and so she I\ndon't know how that's got to be really\nhard that's another level of\nConsciousness right she is able to see\nthat her son was murdered by somebody\nelse and she's able to see that hurt\nchild child that is lost on the path and\ndid that thing because they were lost\nright the ego sees an evil person that's\nin need of punishing our truest self\nsees a sick person that's in need of\nhealing everybody everybody wants\nhappiness everybody wants peace Everyone\nis always doing what they will what they\nbelieve will bring them happiness and\nwhat brings them peace so what you judge\nin someone else and you con and you\ncondemn in someone else you strengthen\nin them so if you judge and condemn\nsomebody who is a thief it strengthens\ntheir identification in thems as a thief\nif you judge and you condemn somebody\nwho is um a cheater it strengthens their\nidentity of themsel as a cheater if you\njudge somebody whatever you judge them\nfor it strengthens that identification\nwith himself which gets them even more\nlost on the\npath right someone who's a thief someone\nwho's a cheater someone who screwed you\nover they do not feel good about what\nthey did I'm sure deep at their core the\ntrue self knows that it's wrong and so\nto judge another person and label that\nperson as a thief or as a cheater\nstrengthens that belief in them which is\nnot even their true self and so really\nwhat it comes down to is if we want to\nbreak the cycle it actually comes back\nto us right they see oh I'm a cheater oh\nI did this wrong to them and they know\nit so that strengthens their\nunconsciousness and and their their\nbeing lostness I guess you could say it\nstrengthens that but if we want to help\neverybody get back to their truest self\nwhat do we do we can learn to try to\nfigure out a way it's not always easy I\npromise you I understand this isn't easy\nI said at the very beginning it's very\neasy but it's also extremely difficult\nbut if we can learn to forgive and love\nsomebody else then maybe they could\nstart to see outside of that\nidentification that they have as the\ncheater or the thief and they can start\nto find the PATH back to who they truly\nare and it starts to relieve them from\nthe UN from the the unconsciousness\nfrom the insanity from the being lost so\nthat maybe they can start to finds and\nso really what it comes down to is a\nstate that we're in holy this is\ncrazy the state that we're in towards\nthat person influences whether they\ncontinue to stay lost and get more lost\nor have an opportunity to re-identify\nthemsel or to I'm sorry let's say\nReDiscover themsel might be a better way\nof saying it and so really what it comes\ndown to is it's good for us to be able\nto forgive and to say hey that person\nknows not what they do but it's also\ngood for the other person and we might\nalso be like well that other person\nwell that resentment is also something\nthat you need to work through right but\nit helps us because we can release it we\ndon't have to carry those negative\nfeelings with us anymore because those\nnegative feelings of resentment and\nanger they you know they build up inside\nof us and they make us unhealthy but\nalso at the same time when we do that we\ncan allow other people to stop\nidentifying and maybe get out of the the\ncheater or the Thief Identity and start\nto identify the wrongs that they've done\nbecause of the way that we've treated\nthem I know I get it it's a deep episode\nbut really what it comes down to is how\ndo we get better at just forgiving\npeople and not allowing other people's\nactions to change the way that we feel\nabout ourselves about other people and\nabout the world so that's
