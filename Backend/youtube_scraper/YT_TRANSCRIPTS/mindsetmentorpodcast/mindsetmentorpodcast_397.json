    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about a\nvery simple secret to success how to be\nmore consistent how to take action every\nsingle day and how to build the habits\nin your life that will change the\ndirection and course of your life tune\nin just cuz it's simple doesn't mean\nit's easy uh it is extremely simple it\nis extremely important um but it's\npretty hard for most people and that's\nwhy most people don't do it and I'm also\ngoing to teach you how Jerry Seinfeld\nuses this technique or had used this\ntechnique when he was in new comic to\nbecome one of the greatest and\nwealthiest comedians probably the\nwealthiest comedian that's ever walked\nthe face of the Earth and what I\nactually call it is I call it the law of\n100 it's very very simple so here's what\nyou need to do okay you need to think to\nyourself what is the one thing what is\nthe one habit that I need to build in\nmyself that would change my life the\nmost and so what we like to call these\nas Keystone habits a keystone habit so\nif you go back and look at what a\nkeystone was in the ancient uh Roman\ntimes a keystone was the stone that was\nat the very center of an arch the reason\nwhy it's the most important stone is\nbecause when it's locked in place it\nlocks all of the other stones of the\narch in place and what it means is that\nthat one stone affects all of the other\nstones and so when you're thinking about\nthe one habit that you want to do the\nreason why it's called a keystone habit\nis because that one habit affects many\nother areas of your life it's very\nsimple though is like let's say for\ninstance you're you decide you know the\nthing that would make the biggest\ndifference in my life is that if I woke\nup early now waking up early one day\nlike most people they say I'm going to\ndo a wake up and have a morning routine\nand so I'm going to wake up at 5:00 a.m.\nand I'm going to meditate and I'm going\nto read and I'm going to go for a run\nand I'm going to work out and I'm going\nto do yoga and I'm going to do this and\nthis and this and they have like 17\nthings they need to do that's not your\nKeystone habit your Keystone habit would\nliterally just be waking up at 5:00 in\nthe morning every single day that's it\nbecause when you wake up one morning you\nmight decide you know what I feel like\nreading today and you just read a little\nbit and then you wake up at 5:00 another\nday and you're like you know what I have\na lot of energy today I'm going to go\nfor a run and then it turns into going\nfor a run and then it might be\nmeditating one day and it might be\nsomething else another day but what\nhappens is that one Keystone habit\naffects so many other areas of your life\nand that's what you want to find so for\nsome people waking up early tends to be\na keystone habit for some people uh\ngoing in and working out every single\nday tends to be a keystone happy because\nyou know all you have to do is go into\nthe gym you do your workout that's it\nand as long as you get the workout done\nthat's your Keystone habit completed but\nwhat other areas of your life does it\naffect well after a while you might say\nyou know what I've been working out so\nmuch I'm G to stop drinking as much you\nknow what I've been working out so much\nI'm going to start drinking more water\nyou know what I've been working out so\nmuch I'm going to eat a little bit\nhealthier you know what I've been\nworking out so much I'm going to get\nsome better sleep and it affects many\nother areas of your life and so what you\nwant to do is this with the law of 00\nyou find one thing that is a keystone\nhabit for you that is going to affect\nmany other areas of your life and you\ndecide that thing that habit that you're\ngoing to create that action that you\nneed to take in your business whatever\nit might be what is that one action that\nyou're going to to take decide it right\nnow we're going to do this together and\nthen you do that one thing for 100 days\nstraight that's it now I don't say like\nokay wake up at 5:00 in the morning only\nMonday through Friday no wake up at 5:00\nin the morning every single day for 100\ndays if that's what you want to do work\nout or at least get into the gym or do\nsome form of physical fitness every\nsingle day for the next 100 days make a\n100 cold calls in your business every\nsingle day for the next 100 days\nwhatever it is you identify that one\nthing and you do it every single day\nhere's the key to it you're probably not\ngoing to be able to do it with your\ncurrent schedule which means things are\ngoing to need to change your schedule's\ngoing to need to change you're going to\nneed to figure out how to get yourself\nmore time to do this and you are going\nto need to change you're going to need\nto figure out and so it's not going to\nbe super comfortable but it's something\nthat you need to do and what I recommend\nhere's what I really recommend is\ndisappear for a 100 days and what I mean\nby disappearing is like don't leave your\nfamily like obviously if you have things\nthat you have to do with your family do\nyour family stuff but disappear from all\nof your friends for a 100 days just say\nhey I'm really working myself the next\n100 days I'll see in a few months\ndisappear from being on social media\ndisappear from uh from everything that\nyou're you know your social life\nwhatever it is you can always go back to\nit but what you're really trying to do\nis you're really trying to take 100 days\nto solely focus on you so if you have a\nfamily obviously you have familial\nobligations you've got to do that stuff\nbut if you're and but if you're single\nlike just disappear just do whatever it\nis that you do for work come home and\nfreaking work on yourself if you're\ntrying to drive a drive it your your new\nbusiness that you just started well then\ngo to go to work whatever is you got to\ndo during your day job and then come\nhome and disappear into your work for\n100 days because here's what's real\ncrazy when you disappear for just a 100\ndays and you do one thing consistently\nevery single day for 100 days you're\nvery different with a different set of\nhabits in 100 days so it's super simple\nit's not hard I told you it's very\nsimple but it's it's it's not hard but\nit is difficult for people step one is\nyou decide what the action is and step\ntwo is you do it every single day for\n100 days don't allow yourself to make\nall of the BS excuses that come up cuz\nsome of you guys are like yes this is\nawesome I can do it and there's a\nportion of people listening right now\nthey're like I don't know if I can do\nthat but Rob oh but Rob you don't know\nmy life oh but you don't know my\nschedule right so don't make excuses\ndon't self-sabotage do that one thing\nevery single day for 100 days and let me\ntell you a few reasons why this is\nextremely important number one over my\nlifetime I've been able to develop some\nreally great relationships with people\nwho have have been quite successful\nright what I have tend what I've found\nout with them is that successful people\nare not that smart they're not smarter\nthan everybody else the whatever success\nmeans to you whether that's great\nparents or whether that's tons of money\nor whether it's great business owners or\nthe happiest people you can find\nwhatever success means to you successful\npeople are the most consistent people\nthey're not smarter they're not uh they\ndon't have better willpower most of the\ntime they've just decided to be\nconsistent they wake up every single day\nand they do the things that they need to\ndo in order to get them from where they\nare to where they want to be right\nsomeone who's really wealthy they worked\nreally consistently they didn't give up\nsomeone who is in incredible shape if\nthat's what success means to you they\nwere very consistent in the way that\nthey worked out and the way they ate\nsomeone who's extremely calm and\ncentered and peaceful they were very\nconsistent in being mindful in\nmeditating and doing breath work and\nbeing present they were just very very\nconsistent consistent success comes from\nconsistency and consistency compounds\nover time and so you might think oh it's\nonly 100 days but every every single day\nthat you do it you get a little bit\nbetter and now when you go into so if\nyou do this thing for seven days right\nyou're going to be better in seven days\nthan you are today so when you go into\nthat thing seven days from today and you\ndo it again that little bit better\nversion of you is now doing it that\nsuccess compounds over time so the most\nsuccessful people are just the most\nconsistent the people who fail the most\nfailure just comes from giving up\nliterally you can only fail at something\nwhen you give up at something you can't\nfail if you just don't give up if you\ndecide I'm going to do this and I'm\ngoing to do this until I die you can't\nyou can't lose if you decide this is the\nbusiness that I'm starting and I'm going\nto do this eventually a year 2 years 3\nyears 5 years 10 years down the road you\nwill get to whatever quote unquote\nsuccess is for you you just just can't\ngive up so step one decide what the\naction is step two do it every single\nday for 100 days and let me explain why\nthis is important to you and the way\nthat your brain actually works let me\ngive you an analogy okay your brain is\nlike a forest and you know if you've\never walked through a forest and there's\nit's really dense and you have to have a\nmachete to kind of chop through stuff\nbut every once in a while you're walking\nthrough a forest and there is a path\nthat you can see that other people have\nwalked down over and over and over and\nover and over again and because it's\nbeen trampled on and walked so much it's\na lot easier to walk down that path\nright well some of us have habits that\nwe don't really want anymore but it's\nvery easy it's like walking down that\npath where we're walking down that path\nof oh we've hit the snooze button so\nmany times it's just very easy to stay\nin that habit of just hitting the snooze\nbutton and not waking up when we really\nwanted to because that is just a habit\nit's a Well warn path in the brain that\nwe have what we're doing and what we're\ndoing in this moment we're talking about\ndoing something with the LW 100 the next\n100 days is about taking out the machete\nand just hacking a new way through the\nforest for the next 100 days it's going\nokay you know this waking up thing I'm\nnot good at it if this is you know the\nexample I'm giving if this is what you\ndecide this waking up thing I'm not good\nat it but you know what I'm going to do\nknowing that it's going to be a struggle\nI'm going to take out my machete in my\nbrain and I'm going to hack a new way in\nthe forest and I will get aggressive at\nmaking sure this habit that I know will\nchange my life is something that I build\ninto my daily practice your brain will\neventually adapt what is foreign and not\ncomfortable to you right now will become\neasy as time goes on you get to a point\nwhere if waking up early is the thing\nthat you want to work on where it might\nbe really hard the first week to wake up\nat 5:00 a.m. or 5:30 whatever time you\nsay you want to wake up it's hard\nbecause it's something completely\ndifferent the same way that it's really\nhard to just hack away at a force with a\nmachete\nbut the more you do it consistently day\nafter day after day the more this path\nbecomes well worn and by the end of 100\ndays if you do it 100 days in a row\nyou're probably going to be waking up\nbefore your alarm goes off that's how\nyou turn something into a habit that's\nthe beautiful thing about being a human\nis we have something called\nneuroplasticity which means that you can\nchange your brain whenever you want to\nyour brain your habits who you are is\nnot set in stone you can change these at\nany moment it just takes consistency and\nit takes a lot of effort you've got to\nput a lot of effort into it and so\nthe way that that Jerry Seinfeld used\nthis and I wrote this about wrote about\nthis in my book level up um he used this\nwhere there was a uh it's called the\nSeinfeld calendar there was a young\ncomic that came up to him one day and he\nwas they were in the back behind the\nstage and he's like Jerry you know I'm\nI'm a young comic I want to know what\ndid you do when you were in my shoes to\nget you to be better and he said well\nwhat I did was I I got a big huge\ncalendar I put it up on the wall and I\nwould force myself to write jokes every\nsingle day he's like someday days I\nwrote good jokes most days I wrote\ncrappy jokes but I wanted to just build\nthe muscle of being consistent in\nwriting jokes every single day and what\nI would do is as soon as I was done\nwriting jokes I would go to the calendar\nand I had a red marker and I would put\nan x on that day for getting that day\ntaken care of and then the next day I'd\ndo the same thing I'd write the jokes\nand I put an x on that calendar the next\nday I put an x on that calendar and\neventually you have a calendar that has\na string of x's that are going across it\nand you're 10 days in the last thing\nthat you want to do is break that that\nthat consistency that you have so the\nconsistency actually starts to become a\nlittle bit addicting to you you don't\nwant to break it and once again these\nthings are not really hard like to do\nthis stuff is not hard to wake up early\nis not really that hard to decide to go\nto the gym is not really that hard\nwhatever it is that to make a 100 cold\ncalls is really not that hard whatever\nit is that you decide that you need to\ndo success is really not that hard it's\nall so simple there's an action the\naction needs to be taken I need to take\nthe\naction it's very simple but what ends up\nhappening we think too much and we make\nit really freaking hard we make it so\nhard on oursel I always tell people if\nif I had the opportunity like if I had\nthe if it was possible for there's a\nbrain you know switch on the side of\nyour brain for me to turn off the\nthinking part of your brain The Fear\nPart of your brain the amydala that puts\nout all the fears and all of the\nlimiting beliefs and I could just flip a\nswitch and just turn it off for a little\nwhile everybody would just take action\ncuz taking action isn't hard how do we\nmake it hard by thinking too much by\nfears by limiting beliefs you just have\nto be committed and not give up the most\nsuccessful people that I know are\ncommitted they're not the smartest\npeople they weren't born rich actually\nmajority of them weren't born rich at\nall I actually I don't think any of them\nwere born rich 80% of millionaires in\nAmerica were born middle class or lower\nclass into lower class families so it's\nnot like they were just given the\nperfect life they just decided that hard\nwork and dedication was going to be\nsomething that they were going to build\ninto themselves the the beautiful thing\nabout being a human is that you could\nhave a brand new life in 12 months you\ncould have a brand new life in three\nyears five years like what if I told you\nif you worked really hard at something\nevery single day for the next three\nyears you would be guaranteed to make $5\nmillion guaranteed like there's no doubt\nabsolutely 100% you're making $5 million\nwould you go for it and not give up\nabsolutely if you are guaranteed 100%\nguaranteed would you yes the problem is\nyou think too much you think about oh\nwell what if this doesn't work out what\nif I'm not good enough what if I'm not\nsmart enough you got to learn to turn\nthat part of your brain off and even\nthough you don't believe in yourself and\neven though you've got fears and even\nthough you've got limiting beliefs as we\nall do you're still going to do it you\ndon't have to believe in yourself in\norder to take action belief is not a\nprerequisite to take an action but what\nif you just started and you didn't\nstop people give up too often and they\ndon't real realize how close they are to\na breakthrough they'll have breakdowns\nand they're like I can't do this anymore\nafter a breakdown usually comes a\nbreakthrough and most people give up\nafter a breakdown oh they think it's not\nfor me this is a sign I'm not supposed\nto do this what if it was just a\ndifferent flip of your mind of like okay\nthis this breakdown right here this is\nthe universe testing me testing me to\nsee if I really want it I'm not going to\ngive up because think about this think\nabout your life how many times have you\ngiven up on yourself how many times have\nyou given up on yourself over and over\nhow many times you say you're going to\ndo that workout plan you're going to\nstick with it and you give up on\nyourself how many times you said you're\ngoing to start a business and you didn't\ndo it how many times you said you're\ngoing to do something and you just\ndidn't do it over and over and over and\nover and over again what if this from\nthis moment on you just decided when I\nstart something I will follow\nthrough the past version of me gave up\nall the time the past version me yeah\ndidn't follow through on anything but\nI'm not going to be that person anymore\nthe new version to me will make a\ndecision to do something and we'll take\naction on that thing I just will not\ngive up on myself anymore where would\nyou be if you didn't give up on that\nthing five years ago that you thought\nwas so amazing for\nyou probably way further ahead than you\nare right now right okay well if that's\nthe case where could you be in 5 years\nfrom today if you decided what it is\nthat you wanted to do and you didn't\ngive up on yourself because it's not\ngoing to happen immediately like you\ndon't go to the gym and then look in the\nmirror and have an you know six-pack\ndoesn't happen that way great things\ntake time\nit takes time to build yourself in the\nperson that you want it takes time to\nbuild your mindset into into be the the\nthe type of mindset that you want it\ntakes time to build your your body into\nthe type of body that you want success\ndoesn't happen overnight it's like that\nChinese bamboo Story the Chinese bamboo\nstory where you you plant a seed and you\nhave to water it and and give it sun and\ntake care of it for six years before it\never comes out of the soil six years\nnothing and then in the sixth year it\ngrows up to 80 feet in 6 weeks up to 2\nfeet a day sometimes that's a lot how\nthat's a lot of the the way that success\nis you don't see anything for a while\nand then boom hockey stick moment it\ntakes off if you just decided to do\nsomething and not give up you could be a\ncompletely different person in a year so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Jr r o d i a ljr\nand then once again if you're in the\nUnited States or Canada and you want to\nget some inspirational texts and videos\nfrom me uh a few times a week go ahead\nand text me right now 512- 5893 05 once\nagain 512- 58 9305
