    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout four strategies to better improve\nyour productivity and your focus and why\nwould you want to improve your\nproductivity and your focus because the\nway that I think about it is I want to\nbe as efficient as I possibly can with\nevery single minute that I put into\nsomething I want my output to be the\nbest possible output that it can be for\nevery minute of input that I put in and\nall too often we look at an 8h hour day\nwe work for 8 hours and we might get\nlike an hour 90 minutes of like really\ngreat work out of it but when you look\nat someone who has a whole lot of focus\nand really high productivity they can\nget six to seven hours out of really an\n8 hour day and so when you look at it\nwhat I would be thinking in my mind is\nif the average person is getting like an\nhour and someone that's highly\nproductive is getting six or seven hours\nthey're basically getting an entire week\ndone in one day compared to what the\naverage person with not really great\nFocus or productivity has and so I'm\ngoing to give you six strategies to\nreally help you get better at that uh\nstrategy number one is to master the art\nof single tasking and understanding what\nsingle tasking is single tasking is\nobviously the opposite of multitasking\nwhich means focusing on one task and one\ntask only and cognitive psychology tells\nus that the brain does not really\nperform well when it is scattered over\nseveral different tasks and so single\ntasking allows you to be better and to\nbe be better number one but to be better\nconcentrated on what it is that you're\nworking towards to get into a flow while\nyou're doing that one thing which will\nthen in the long term lead to higher\nquality work whatever that work is that\nyou're trying to do um what it also does\nthough it also reduces the cognitive\nload and mental fatigue that is\nassociated when you're constantly\nshifting your attention because if you\nwork in an office let's say you have an\noffice and there's other desks around\nyou and you're trying to get something\ndone you are constantly bombarded with\nother things that people need from you\nthey might want to come up and talk to\nyou whatever it might be you need to\nfigure out a way to take your brain and\nsay hey I'm going to I'm going to get\nthe whole entire world out of this brain\nI'm going to focus on this one thing I'm\nnot going to do two things at once I'm\ngoing to do one thing at a time and\nthere's actually a study there's\nactually many studies as I was\nresearching this on how multitasking is\nterrible for you to do like you will be\nless uh productive if you decide to be a\nmultitasker there's actually a study\nthat was done in uh in 2008 and it's\ncalled is multitasking a myth and the\nstudy showed uh through human MRIs it\nshowed that when the brain is overloaded\nwith tasks when it has multiple tasks it\nneeds to work on um it resulted in\nreduced efficiency and effective\nEffectiveness uh when performing those\ntasks and the research indicated that\nthe brain's frontal lobe becomes\nactivated during multi tasking which is\nassociated with the decline in cognitive\nperformance due to overloading the\nhuman's working memory and so there's\nstudy after study after study after\nstudy that shows you that multitasking\nactually produces worse work so what I\nwant to do and what I think everybody\nshould start doing is if I'm going to be\nworking on something I'm going to be\nworking on one thing and one thing only\nthe thing is to immerse yourself bring\nall of your brain power to that one task\nand think about it like it really makes\nsense doesn't it would you want to bring\n20% of your brain power to the tasks\nthat you're working on or would you\nrather put 100% of your brain power if\nyou could put 100% of your brain power\ninto it you're going to get it done\nquicker obviously and you're obviously\ngoing to get much better work done and\nso really what it comes down to is\nlooking at your to-do list every single\nday and seeing okay I've got 17 things\non my to-do list and prioritizing my\ntasks identify what the most critical\ntasks are that you have throughout the\nday and then allocate your best most\nuninterrupted time to that thing and if\nyou've been listening this podcast\nbefore you've heard me say it over and\nover and over again simply because I\nhave never found anything else that\nworks better than this is to use a\npomodora technique which means you do\none thing and one thing only for 25\nminutes and then you take five minutes\noff 25 minutes 5 minutes off if you want\nto hear on how to get better with the\npomodora technique you can go back and\nlisten to previous episodes I've talked\nabout it many times of how to actually\nmatch the pomodora technique I actually\ntalk about it in my book too level up uh\nwhere I actually talk about how to get\ngood at the pomodora technique and then\nhow to expand yourself from 25 minutes\nof working time up to 45 minutes of\nworking time so that's the first thing\nMaster single tasking strategy number\ntwo which goes along with this and all\nthese kind of flow into each other is to\nuse something called Deep work uh\nthere's a book called Deep work uh by\nCal Newport and um in his book he talks\nabout uh he defines deep work as\nprofessional activities performed in a\nstate of distraction free concentration\nthat pushes your cognitive abilities or\ncognitive capabilities to their limit\nand so what you want to do is you want\nto have time throughout your day\nwhatever it is whether it's an hour or\nthree hours and you protect that time\nevery single day and you say this is the\ntime of the day that I'm going to do my\ndeep work and deep work really means\nwhat you would think where you go really\ndeep on that one thing and so instead of\nhaving really what he calls shallow work\nwhich is what most people tend to do\nthroughout the day which is you're doing\na little bit of this a little bit of\nthat a little bit of this a little bit\nthat is that you're going to go really\ndeep on just that one thing and you're\ngoing to protect that time as if it's\nsacred because cognitively it is kind of\nsacred it's it's where you're saying\nfrom from 11:00 a.m. to 100 p.m. I'm\ngoing to do deep work and then each day\nyou decide what are the things that\nyou're going to do in that deep work\ntime and you create a ritual around it\nand you do the same thing to prep to go\ninto it like get coffee prep your\nworkspace which I'll talk about in a\nminute uh put some music on light a\ncandle burn incense whatever it is you\nneed to do where it's like you're making\nit a ritual of like this is\nimportant and I'm going to work and work\nreally hard for the next two hours and\nyou protect that time that's what deep\nwork is used for and deep work allows\nyou to produce better results in a much\nshorter period of time you know I'll\ntake the entire book of Cal deep work by\nCal Newport and tell you that throughout\nhis entire book he says if you have a\nsacred time that you protect where you\ngo deep on really one thing study after\nstudy after study shows that that time\nis going to produce the best output for\nyou so you want to have a time where you\ncan have much better results in a much\nshorter period of time and so you don't\nhave to have deep work for eight hours\nin a day there's shallow work that you\nneed to do like for me there's some deep\nwork that I need to do when I'm prepping\nfor these podcast episodes and I put on\nmy headphones and I I crank out the uh\nthe script for all these podcast\nepisodes and put the bullet points down\nand do all the research but then there's\ntimes throughout today like I have a\nzoom call later on that would be\nconsidered shallow work for me so what\nis the Deep work the things that you\nneed to bring the best of your brain to\nand you want to maximize your\nperformance here because all too often\nwe're so distracted we're only giving 40\nor 50% of our brain power at most to a\ntask and so here's what you're really\ngoing to do is you're going to dedicate\nspecific blocks of time every single day\nfor deep work and this is like\nnonnegotiable you have to do this every\nsingle day I recommend doing it when you\nknow that you have the most energy in\nthe day for me I know that I have the\nmost energy in the day between about\n11:00 a.m. and 2 p.m. and so that is\nwhen I always get my deep work done that\nis when I plan podcast episodes that is\nusually when I record podcast episodes\nIt's 150 right now so I feel like my\nbrain is at its best in these moments so\nI'm going to do my most important work\nin those moments and so that's when you\nfeel like your brain is on the most so\nstart paying attention to when you have\nthe most energy when you feel like\nyou're in flow you know if it's 1: p.m.\nfor you we'll do 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.\nwhatever it might be try to get two\nhours of just really deep work every\nsingle day and the thing that you want\nto do is you want to embrace embrace the\nstruggle you want to train your brain to\nem embrace the struggle of trying to\nfocus rather than seeking distractions\nbecause it's really essential for um\nmaking sure that your mind goes into a\ndeep state of work because the more that\nyou do it the better you become at it so\nyou might not be really good at focusing\nyou not may not really be good at at not\nwanting to be distracted in your first\nfew times of doing deep work but you get\nbetter at it because maybe you just have\na really strong distraction muscle and a\nreally weak Focus muscle and you just\nneed to work on on weakening the\ndistraction muscle in strengthening the\nfocus muscle so that's number two is to\nmake sure that you use deep work\nstrategy number three is to optimize\nyour environment you want to try to\ncreate an environment where taking\naction towards whatever goal is that\nyou're working towards is easy and\ndistracting yourself is hard so how can\nyou create an environment where taking\naction is easy and distraction is hard\nand environmental psychology shows that\nyour physical space will influence the\nway that you feel the way that you think\nand the way that you behave so how can\nyou create an environment that feels\ngood for you for some people listen this\npodcast it might be nothing on a desk in\na computer for some people it might be\nsitting outside at a coffee shop for\nsome people it might be sitting at a\ndesk that has a bunch of plants around\nyou and you might have right by a window\nso it's really bright light coming in\nwhat you want to figure out is what's\nbest for you what inspires you to take\naction and you want to find a quiet and\ncomfortable place where you can work and\nnot be disturbed and you can use noise\ncancelling headphones that's what I\nrecommend I always have my noise\nhandlink headphon headphones with me\nwhen I'm working um so the you can get\ndeeper into your own concentration you\nwant to be able to clear your area\nbecause you want to try to control as\nmuch visual clutter as possible uh\nbecause visual clutter actually competes\nfor your attention and can lead to more\ncognitive overload which will get in the\nway of your focus you want to take your\nphone put your phone away if you're\nworking from a coffee shop or something\nmake sure your phone is not in front of\nyou put it inside of your bag uh for me\nI always have to keep my phone\ncompletely out of eyesight and I usually\nif I'm being honest with you I'm working\nat home uh what I do is I actually take\nit and put in my kitchen drawer if I'm\nworking from the office I'll always take\nit and I'll put it inside of my backpack\nso that I can't see it and so you know\nwhat's another thing you can do to help\nyou with your your environment uh put a\nsign on your office door close your\noffice door if you don't have an office\nand you work inside of a cubicle uh\ntelling people hey I'm about to do some\nreally deep work can you not bother me\nand then taking a sign and putting a\nsign on the outside of your cubicle it\nsays don't bother me unless it's an\nemergency I have one of my listeners\ntells me when he does his deep work he\nsent me a a a message one time where he\nactually puts a piece of paper and and\ntapes it to his back that says don't\nbother me unless it's an emergency and\nso it's like how can you create the\nenvironment that is best for you because\nwhat's best for me and what's best for\nall the other listeners might not be the\nsame that's best for you so what would\nthe perfect environment look like and\nyou start thinking about this like are\nyou constantly interrupted by colleagues\nor are you constantly interrupted by\nyour kids coming in and needing\nsomething from you uh do you have all of\nthe tools that you need to be able to\nget work done within Arms Reach um is\nthere enough light in your space and you\njust want to start thinking about like\nsmall tweaks like positioning your desk\nand taking your desk and putting it\ncloser to a window so that you get\nbright light that comes in because\nbright light coming from the Sun comes\nthrough your eyes and tells your brain\nto be more alert and more focused so\nwhat can you do to create the perfect\nworking environment for you is something\nto think about so that's strategy number\nthree and strategy number four is to try\nto take something that you do multiple\ntimes throughout the week and try to get\nit all done in one time so it's called\nbatching your tasks so you want to try\nto batch all of your tasks uh when I\nfirst started this podcast I you know it\ncame out Monday Wednesday Friday now it\ncomes out Monday Wednesday Thursday\nFriday but when it was Monday Wednesday\nFriday I would literally record plan and\nrecord the day before and then I would\nput the episode out I plan and record\nand the day before and put out so I\nwould plan and record it three separate\ntimes throughout the week\nand that just really didn't work for me\nand I did it for years though and then\nwhat I started doing is I saying well\nhey if I'm going to get my brain into\nthe flow of being creative and doing\nresearch and planning all of this stuff\nout why don't I just try to do all of\nthem at once and so for me because we do\nfour episodes now I'll plan and research\ntwo episodes and then I'll record two\nepisodes and then I'll plan and record\ntwo episodes and I'll do it two days in\na row so it's usually Wednesday and\nThursdays we record them and so I do\nthis with podcasts I do this with\nrecording um and creating content for\nInstagram where instead of thinking oh I\nneed to create something for Instagram\nand for Tik Tok today I just do it all\nin one run just makes it easier to batch\nall of your tasks so how could you use\nthis you know if you do\nemails why don't you do emails when you\nfirst get into the office and you get\nthem all done in the morning and then\nyou do emails an hour before you leave\nso instead of checking your emails 42\ntimes a day day which is I think what\nthe average is it's like 30 to 40 times\na day people check their email which is\ninsane why don't you check your email in\nthe morning if you can do this obviously\ncheck it in the morning get all of your\nemails cleared out and then an hour\nbefore you have to leave do the exact\nsame thing get all of them cleared out\nand then the rest of your day you can do\nother stuff whatever is that you need to\ndo you know if you're working on a\npresentation you could if you wanted to\nif you have a presentation due next week\nyou could take a little bit today a\nlittle bit tomorrow a little bit the\nnext day or you could say like hey I'm\ngoing to dedicate the entire day to\npresentation day so I'm going to get it\nall done in one day I'm going to get\nmyself in the flow I'm going to get\nmyself in the energy of this\npresentation and I'm going to try to\ncrank all of it out today and you might\nget part of it done this morning part of\nit done in around noon part of it done\nin the afternoon part of it done in the\nevening but really like if your brain is\nin flow on that one thing whether it's\ncreating a presentation or going through\nemails or creating content or for me\ndoing uh podcast episodes if your brain\nis in that flow why would you want it to\nbe in the flow and then switch it to\nsomething else because when you switch\nto something else there's a there's an\nactual cognitive decline that goes from\nswitching from one thing to another what\nI would rather do is say hey my brain is\non this thing and it's working pretty\nwell right now how do I just keep it on\nthe exact same task and so see if\nthere's some tasks that you do multiple\ntimes throughout the week and just ask\nyourself instead of doing this thing\nthree times a week could I just do it\nonce a week but do it for 3 hours\nusually when you do this you actually\nend up getting much better output and\nmuch better work done and you get it\ndone faster because you're already in\nthe flow there's no cognitive decline\nfrom switching from one task to another\nbecause you're already on this task and\nso it just makes a lot more sense the\nway when you look at the human brain and\nhow it actually works for you to be more\nproductive and be more focused for you\nto batch all of your tasks that you can\npossibly batch so uh those are the four\nstrategies to be able to get uh better\nfocus and productivity number one is to\nmaster the art of single tasking number\ntwo use deep work number three optimize\nyour environment and before batch as\nmany tasks as you possibly can so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\nwith a friend um and once again as you\nheard me say just a little while ago if\nyou want to join my weekly inspirational\ntext in the United States and Canada you\ncan text me right now 512-\n58930 5 once again 512- 58930 5 I'll\nsend text messages videos to you all\nthat stuff at different points\nthroughout the week so with that I'm\ngoing to leave you the same way leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
