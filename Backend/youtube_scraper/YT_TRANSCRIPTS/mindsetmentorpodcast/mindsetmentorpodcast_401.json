    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout the six biggest decisions that you\nwill make throughout your entire life so\none thing that I want you to realize is\nthat there's a lot of little teeny tiny\ndecisions that are super important\nthroughout our life but there's a few\ndecisions six that I've identified and\nthere's probably a couple more that are\noutside of my awareness so I forgot\nabout but there's six really big\ndecisions that I think you want to try\nto master and you really want to focus\non and uh that's what we're going to go\nthrough today the first one is who\nyou're going to surround yourself with\nyou become who you surround yourself\nwith and um you know there's a a quote\nthat I love that's Sydney porier porier\nI think is how you say it says when you\ngo for a walk with something uh when you\ngo for a walk with someone something\ninteresting happens unconsciously either\nthey adjust to your pace or you adjust\nto their pace and what's really\ninteresting about that is that when you\ngo for a walk with someone not only does\nyour pace and your walk adjust with each\nother but also your nervous system\ninteracts with their nervous system so\nyour heart rate will usually start to\nsync up and be very similar to theirs\nand your breath rate rate will really\nstart to sync up to theirs as well you\nadjust and you become who you surround\nyourself with uh a few episodes ago I\nshowed you guys a study that was done\nthere was a study that was done and said\nthat you know if you in your your friend\ngroup is overweight and you join that\nfriend group you have about a 35% chance\nof becoming overweight within the next 6\nmonths because you literally become who\nyou surround yourself with and so if\nyou're somebody who like for me I'll\ngive you a great example I give this\nexample in my book um when I first moved\nto Austin uh which was in\n2012 um I was 26 years old in 2012 and I\ncame here and I had one friend who lived\nhere and he became my roommate and he\nhad already been here for a couple years\nso he had this friends group and they\njust partied all of the time and because\nI became friends with all of them I\nended up partying all the time and so I\nwas like there was never a night when I\nwas in Austin when I first moved here\nwhere there was not somebody partying at\nsome point in time so I could have gone\nout every single night if I wanted to\nand then what happened was a couple\nyears down the road I ended up moving\nout of that house and I ended up moving\nand buying my own house and I started my\nown business and so what I did was I\nstarted going to conferences and meeting\nother people just naturally who had\ntheir own business and I started\nbecoming really close to them and what\nhappened was I spent less time with my\nfriends who are partying and I spent\nmore time with my friends who are\ngrowing businesses who are concentrating\non growing their business and who are\nconcentrating on on trying to get better\nat marketing and get better at sales and\nget better at Brand building their\nbrands and what was really interesting\nis I one of my friends who I really\nstart started hanging out a lot with he\nwas kind of like a mentor of mine he\nalready had a business that was doing a\nfew million dollars a year and he was a\nrecovering uh drug addict and alcoholic\nso he did no drinking at all and\nnaturally because I started hanging out\nwith him more I just stopped drinking\nand I didn't do it I didn't even do it\nconsciously I just did it naturally\nbecause I was syncing up with the people\nwho I was spending the most time with\nand so it was real interesting because I\nwent from a lot of my friends that were\nall employed and partied all the time\nand I was employed at the time and\npartying to I had a group of friends\nthat I developed over time that didn't\nparty and ran their own businesses and\nthen so I naturally ended up just\nstopped partying and started running my\nbusiness and started growing my my\nbusiness and so one of the most\nimportant decisions you'll ever make is\nwho you surround yourself with and it's\nso often that I hear people like I have\ntoxic relationships and I can't get out\nof them I'm like well that's your fault\nyou got to get out of them or you got to\nswitch the relationship you got to\nchange the dynamic of the relationship\nthere's you can't blame other people for\nthe lack of the life that you have or\nthe lack of success that you have or\nwhatever it is that you want you will\nrise to the standards or you will lower\nyour standards to those that are around\nyou and so if you're at a point in your\nlife where you're trying to grow how can\nyou get get yourself around people who\nwill make you raise your standards of\nwhat is acceptable and what is not\nacceptable first very very important\ndecision I would rather have a couple\npeople in my life that are making me\nbetter than 20 friends that are just\nkeeping me in the same place and so\nthat's the first thing is who you\nsurround yourself with the second thing\nthat's really important is where you're\ngoing to live location location location\nsome people want to be by their family\nthat's fine some people want to grow\nthemselves in their\nbusiness sometimes those two things do\nnot line up a lot of times they don't\nline\nup so you've got to make a decision are\nyou going to be by your family or you\ngoing to grow your business can you can\nyou grow a business being near your\nfamily of course you can yeah absolutely\nbut it's my personal belief just just so\nyou know it's my personal belief that\neveryone should move away from the city\nthat they grew up in at least for a\ncouple years because when you get away\nfrom who you were you can start to build\nyourself into who you want to be you can\nbecome a brand new person in a new city\nand so like for me I come from a place\ncalled uh in Florida called brenon\nSarasota area and I lived in brenon when\nI was a kid I also lived in Sarasota\nwhen I was a kid and uh I did once again\na whole lot of party in there as well\nand the thing about that is when I\nstarted looking at the people who stayed\nAfter High School and after college I\nstarted realizing that those were the\npeople who even though they were great\nfriends of mine in the past um they\nweren't really on the same life path as\nme\nand so just as the same with number one\nnumber two also works really similar to\nthat as well which is if you look at the\ncity that you live in is it conducive to\nhelp you grow into the person that you\nwant to be does it help you grow into\nthe person that you want to be are there\npeople around you that would help you\ngrow and raise your\nstandards if there is then you can stay\nthere that's fine if it's not maybe you\nshould consider trying to go somewhere\nelse for a couple years even if you grow\nup like an hour outside of a big city\nand you're you're in a small little town\nwhat would it look like if you moved an\nhour into that big city and just see\nwhat happens see if you can get yourself\naround other people around other\nexperiences stop being who you were and\nstart being somebody new and figure out\nwhat that looks like so you can grow\nyourself so you can discover yourself\nlike when I moved to Austin I've be feel\nlike there's a couple different moves I\nhad when I first moved out of when I was\n18 years old I went to school went to\nschool in boa Ron then I went back and I\nI ended up Moving to Tampa and then I\nended up moving to South Florida and\nFort Lauderdale and then I moved to\nAustin so I've moved a few different\ntimes completely away from my family and\nI love my family but every time I moved\nit was a new level of discovering myself\nand it was a new level of growth that\nwas required for me so try it out maybe\nmove somewhere else but the second thing\nthat you're going to really want to\nfocus on is is where you live and really\nstart to think about that third most\nimportant decisions you're going to make\nand these are not ranked these are just\nyou know there's no specific order but\nthe third most important decision is who\nyou're going to marry or if you're going\nto marry either is fine but you do what\nyou want um are you going to marry\nsomeone just because you've been with\nthem for years and it's the right\nage a lot of people do that you know\nthere's 50% of people who get married\nget divorced so are you going to marry\nsomeone just because you're like oh well\nyou know we've been together for three\nyears and I'm 27 so now it kind of makes\nsense or are you going to marry someone\nwho you're going to grow with you know\nfor me I only want to marry someone who\nmakes me better I want to marry someone\nwho who knows how important my growth is\nsupports that so you know the the thing\nfor me is obviously I'm not going to\nmarry anybody else I am married right\nnow but one of the things that was\nreally important for me with with Lauren\nand myself was that I realized that she\nmade me a better person it wasn't like\nshe tried to keep me in the same place\nor tried to to stop my growth she knew\nwhat I love she knew what I was\npassionate about we had a conversation\nyears ago and I was very up front I said\nHey listen with my life path I'm going\nto be kind of in the public light\nsometimes I'm going to have to travel\nand be away from Austin I'm going to\nhave to go different places is that okay\nbecause this is a path that I know I'm\non and she's like yeah absolutely I know\nhow important this is to you I know how\nimportant your mission is and so we were\nit wasn't like that just came out of\nnowhere it was a conversation that we\nhad and so I know with us two being\ntogether and I'm gonna have her on the\npodcast so you guys can all meet her and\nall of that stuff um we can talk about\nit but for for us I know that both of us\nmake each other better better and I\nthink that's a really important thing I\nalso think that a really important thing\nof being being married to somebody this\nis my opinion you can take it if you\nwant to but my opinion as well is\nknowing that uh we all have Trauma from\nour past we all have um fears and\nlimiting beliefs and traumas from from\nbeing children I think when you're\nmarried to somebody my opinion once\nagain is when you marry somebody you're\nsaying you know what I think that I feel\ncomfortable going through all of my\nof my childhood trauma my fears and my\nlimiting beliefs I I I feel comfortable\ngoing through them with you uh CU a lot\nof people have fears and limiting\nbeliefs and they never talk about that\nstuff with their spouse and so for me it\nwas always like I want a safe place\nwhere I can grow and get past all of my\nstuff and I want to create a safe space\nfor her where she can grow and get past\nyour stuff as well and so the third\nthing that's really really important a\ndecision that you need to make is who\nyou're going to marry the fourth thing\nis what you're going to do for money\nmoney is very important for some people\nand for others it's not and so some\npeople want their passion to be their\npaycheck uh that happens to be me that's\ngreat some people want their want to\nmake their money and then live their\npassion outside of their paycheck\nneither one is right neither one is\nwrong it's all about what you want and\nyou have to realize that many uh\ndivorces happen because of money and so\nwhen you have a marriage and what you do\nfor money are you guys lined up with\nthat are you guys on the same page with\nall of that and so what you do for money\nis really important because you're going\nto spend the majority of your waking\nhours working so wouldn't you want to do\nsomething that you love like it drives\nme crazy how many people absolutely feel\nlike they're they're they're working a\njob that's completely soul sucking for\nthem and they're spending the majority\nof their waking hours doing it and it's\npulling the life from them I know that\nfor me uh the the last few jobs that I\nhad I was like there's no way I could do\nthis for the rest of my life when I was\nlooking at my managers and I was looking\nat my bosses and I was like I could be\nthere in 5 years or I could be there in\n10 years I was like I do not want their\nlife I don't want to make the money that\nthey're making I don't want to be doing\nwhat they're doing and if that's my path\nno way I've got to do something else and\nso whether you have your own business or\nwhether you work for someone else\ncompletely fine but are you doing\nsomething that you love to do that\nactually that you actually at least\nenjoy so that you're not just sitting\nthere and and wasting your life away\njust making a paycheck and so the fourth\nmost important decision the number for\num is what you're going to do for money\nbecause we're all going to have to do\nsomething for money uh the fifth thing\nis who you want to be and what your\nvalues are going to be like who do you\nnobody actually really thinks this I\nfeel like like when I I ask this\nquestion people like who do you want to\nbe in your lifetime and when I say who\ndo you want to be I don't just mean like\nwhat do you want to achieve but like who\nare you right because when you achieve\nsomething that is a doing thing I'm not\njust talking about doing I'm talking\nabout who you want to be You Are a Human\nBeing not a human doing and so one of\nthe biggest eye-opening things for me\nwas was my very first girlfriend's\nfather died way after we broke up but um\nI happened to be in town when the\nfuneral was happening and um he was you\nknow he wasn't he was just a a normal\nguy right normal life normal job nice\nguy stayed in the town he grew up and\nall of this stuff and it was really\nsurprising to me when I pulled up to the\nthe uh Chapel where it was happening and\nuh his funeral was happening and it was\npacked I mean the most people I've ever\nseen at a funeral and I thought to\nmyself like the standing room only for a\nlot of people and there was people\noutside and they had to open up the\nwindows for the people to listen from\nthe outside it was it was cool because I\nrealized like life is not about how much\nis in your bank account when you die\nlife is more about how many people show\nup to your funeral because if you have a\nlot of people show up to your funeral\nmust mean that you're a pretty good\nperson right and when you have that\nfuneral how do you want people to talk\nabout you at your funeral what do you\nwant them to say about you what do you\nwant your character traits to be what do\nyou want your values to be do you want\nto be humble do you want to be giving do\nyou want to be loving do you want to be\nreliable do you want to be trustworthy\ndo you want to be a great friend do you\nwant to Great be a great father son what\ndo you want people to say about you\nthat's really something that you should\nwrite down with a pen and paper is what\ndo I want my character traits to be how\ndo I want to be known what's important\nto me and one of the things I think is\nis super important too is I was thinking\nabout this yesterday when I was taking\nbare for a walk and um I was thinking\nabout the fact that obvious I think\nabout death all the time because it just\nit brings meaning to life and I was\nthinking about the fact that we all have\nto die and um I was really thinking\nabout like what we want our values to be\nand I was thinking about people who I\nknow that have died and I was thinking\nabout when somebody dies it gives you a\nreally good reset on it kind of like\nclears all of the out of your\nlife for a second and it makes you kind\nof see life really clearly and I think\nthat one of the most important times to\nask yourself who you want to be which\nyou don't have to wait for someone to\ndie that you love but that's one of most\nimportant places where you can ask\nyourself who you want to be because when\nyou see someone that dies like for\ninstance my grandfather when he passed\naway um he was one of the people I\nlooked up to more than anybody else in\nthe world and I made a list of all of\nthe things that I loved about my\ngrandfather everything that I love he\nwas the kindest sweetest most amazing\nhuman I've ever met and there was all of\nthese traits and I thought to myself I\ncould miss him and I could love him for\nall these things and all that's great\nbut the the best way to honor him is to\nlook at all the things that I loved\nabout about him and to make those my\ncharacter traits and to try to have him\nLive On Through Me by being more humble\nby being more loving by being more\ngiving by being more open and I looked\nat all of his character traits and I\nsaid these are the things that I want to\nbe and I'm going to have him Live On\nThrough Me by me being this way and so\nthink about that like how do you want to\nbe known when you die and how can you\nmake those those values and those\ncharacter traits be something that you\nactually start to live and then the\nsixth one uh is what you're going to\ndedicate life to what's your life going\nto be dedicated to if you don't dedicate\nyour life to something then what's the\npoint what are you willing to die for\nand it could be your children that's\nfine it could be your business that's\nfine it could be helping homeless people\nor needy people it could be pushing\nanimal rights it could be social\njustice it could be you know growing a\ncoaching company it could be uh creating\na technology that helps the world but\nwhat is it and so if you're just waking\nup and you're just living your life and\njust kind of going through it passively\nand not being an active engaged person\nin your own life what's the point like\nwhat do you want to dedicate your life\nto something I think is really important\nfor every single person I think about\nand so what's the point of you being\nhere why are you here what the hell do\nyou want to do with this thing you know\nif you're 45 years old you might be like\noh my God I'm so old but if if you live\nto 90 you're only halfway through your\nlife maybe the first 45 years of your\nlife were very\num very unconsciously lived well can you\nconsciously live and say this is I want\nto dedicate my life to this is who I\nwant to be this is how I want to act\nthis is what I want the back half of my\nlife to be dedicated to if you're not\ndedicating your life to something what's\nthe point have something that you're\nworking towards something that you're\ntrying to do something that you're how\nother ways you're trying to help the\nworld or other people that are not you\nand so those are the six things that you\nreally should be focused on and start to\nto make those decisions in your life is\nnumber one who you want to surround\nyourself with number two where you're\ngoing to live number three uh who you're\ngoing to marry number four what you're\ngoing to do for money number five uh who\nyou want to be and what your values are\nand number six what you want to dedicate\nyour life to so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me at robd Jr\nr o d a ljr if you didn't know I've
