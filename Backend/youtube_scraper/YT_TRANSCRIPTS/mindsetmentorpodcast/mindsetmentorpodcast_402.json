    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout seven ways to stop being so\noverwhelmed um it's really really easy\nto get overwhelmed nowadays if you think\nof all of the things that we have to do\nall of the technology that we have we\nhave phones we have computers we have TV\nwe have other people that live in our\nlives some of you guys have children we\nhave work we have family we have so many\nthings that are just trying to get our\nattention and some of them deserve our\nattention some of them frankly don't\ndeserve our attention at all and\noverwhelm is really really terrible for\nyour mind but it's also really terrible\nfor your body there was actually a study\nthat was done in 1991 uh it was a\nwhiteall study and they found that\npeople who had higher levels of\noverwhelm and stress levels had a\ngreater risk of developing heart disease\nand mental health problems compared to\nthose people who were not as overwhelmed\nand so when we look at this it's not\njust a mental thing thing it's also a\nphysical thing as well and so when you\nlook at overwhelm if this is the case\nand it's not good for our minds it's not\ngood for our bodies it's something that\nwe should work on and try to get you\nknow at least not try to get rid of\nbecause we'll probably never get fully\nrid of overwhelmed throughout our entire\nlife but at least start to step away\nfrom being so overwhelmed um because\nit's very easy to be doing something\nevery single second of every single day\nbut if you look at our brains and our\nbodies our brains and our bodies were\nnot meant for this world that in and\nwhen I say world I don't mean Earth I\nmean the world the structure the\ntechnology everything that we've built\nand Technology seems to double every\nsingle year as far as how much stuff is\nhappening and the amount of the amount\nof things that you can go into with\nvideo games with VR I remember I was I\ndid VR a couple years ago I did it and\num I had a headset it about three years\nago and I played one game and I got\nreally into it I'm not really that big\nin video games but I got really big into\nit and it was this game where you shoot\nrobots and these Ro you know the levels\nget harder and harder and harder and I\nnoticed that after I played the game for\nlike an hour my nervous system was on\nguard and like really overwhelmed for a\nfew hours after I played the game after\nI was done I was sitting on my couch and\nI could feel like my heart beating and\num we're not really suited for this\nworld that we've built our and our\nbrains and bodies are not really suited\nfor all this technology everything that\nwe have we're better suited for the\nplanes and hunting and Gathering and not\nin constant stimulation all of the time\nand in between the hunting and Gathering\nwe would sit around and talk or we would\njust stare off into the distance at a\nbeautiful sunset and so when you look at\noverwhelm what does it actually mean to\nbe overwhelmed it's basically the body\nsaying hey slow down like this shit's\ngetting to be too much you got to chill\nfor a little bit dude I ain't I ain't\ngot any more left just stop for a bit\nbut what the problem is and I realized\nthis about it myself about probably six\nor seven years ago is that I had been\ntrained I trained self to go go go go go\ngo go all the time and so when I had a\nfree moment just the the pause made me\neven more stressed out because I felt\nlike I should be doing I felt like I\nshould be further I felt like there was\nsomething I was supposed to be doing at\nall points in time and it's basically\nyour the overwhelm is your brain and\nyour body are swamped by all of the\ndemands that you are placing on them not\nanybody else not Society not your mother\nor father or anything it is you are\nplacing your brain and body in this\noverwhelm and the demands can be you\nknow it can be many different things it\nbe cognitive it could be emotional it\ncould be physical as well and here's the\nthing that I really want you to\nunderstand it could be that your body is\noverworked maybe it's physical movements\nmaybe you work outside maybe you get a\nwork at in every single day it could be\nthat the body is overworked but if we're\nbeing real most of the time overwhelmed\ndoesn't come from your body being\noverworked it's from you not being able\nto turn your mind off you not being able\nto take a step out of your mind and\nchill for a minute and because your mind\nis part of your body your brain is part\nof your body it's also making your body\noverworked because the brain even though\nit's only 2% of your entire weight it\nuses about 20% of your body's energy\nyour brain is the most energy consuming\norgan that's inside of your body so if\nyou're thinking and overthinking and\noverthinking and overthinking there is\nno break at all if you're waking up and\nyou're checking your phone and you're\nchecking your emails and you're checking\nyour text and you're checking Instagram\nand you're checking Tik Tok and you're\nchecking Twitter before you even get out\nof bed when does your brain actually\nhave a second just to chill and then you\nget out of bed and what do you do you go\nstraight to the coffee and you chug a\ncoffee and then you go get your kids\nready and then you take them to school\nand then you immediately go to work and\nyou're rushing into work oh my God I\nforgot to eat breakfast today and you're\njust eating snacks and the rest of the\nday is just go go go go go and you come\nback from work you get stuck in traffic\nyou go pick up your kids from from\nschool you bring them home you get them\nuh get them all ready with their\nschoolwork you get them ready for bed\nand then once they're ready for bed and\nthey're in bed then instead of taking a\nmoment just to chill your version of\nquote unquote chill is turning on\nNetflix and watching Netflix for three\nhours and then going to bed and you do\nit over and over and over again no\nwonder why we're so\noverwhelmed it makes sense so it means\nthat it's something we can remove oursel\nfrom if we really want to and it's\nsomething that I want to talk to you\nabout today um and I got this whole idea\nbecause I was on a group coaching call\nuh for one of my coaching programs\nthat's called mindset Mentor University\num you know if you're interested in\nlearning about it just go to Rob\ndial.com um you can there's information\nunder the programs up there but I had a\nclient that was on the live and in the\nlive we have Q&A sessions and the client\nwas talking about something the client\nsaid oh it's she said it's making me\noverwhelmed it's making me\noverwhelmed and when I listen to\nsomebody who I'm coaching I listen on\ntwo levels I listen to what they're\nsaying and I listen to what's under what\nthey're saying like what's behind it\nwhen you say it's making me\noverwhelmed really it's making you\noverwhelmed or you're making yourself\noverwhelmed because what happens is and\nit it's a it's a tiny little difference\nlike I'm I'm less concerned about what\nyou do and I'm more concerned about the\nstory that you're telling yourself in\nyour head and so if you're saying it's\nmaking me overwhelmed work is making me\noverwhelmed my relationship is making me\noverwhelmed my children's schedule is\nmaking me overwhelmed my schedule is\nmaking me overwhelmed no it's not it is\nnot making you overwhelmed because when\nyou say it is making me\noverwhelmed you are taking all of the\nblame and you are putting it on\nsomething external something outside of\nyou and that puts you as a victim to\nyour circumstance when in reality you're\nthe one that's in control of what you do\nthroughout the day you're the one that's\nin control of your schedule what you\ndon't do throughout the day and so when\nyou say something like it's making me\noverwhelmed you're automatically making\nyourself the victim and when you're the\nvictim you have no power over your life\nand that makes you feel more overwhelmed\nand so it's not making you overwhelmed\nyou are making you overwhelmed you can't\nplay the victim you know when you listen\nto the words it's making me overwhelmed\nis putting external blame on something\nelse I am making myself overwhelmed is\ntaking internal blame and when you take\ninternal blame that puts you into the\ndriver's seat because if you're the one\nmaking yourself overwhelmed you are also\nthe only one that can make yourself not\noverwhelmed anymore that push you into a\nplace of power and when you have when\nyou blame external you can't change it\nbut when you blame you you can change it\nbut it also and it's it's a small change\nisn't it it's like it's making me\noverwhelmed versus I'm overwhelmed it's\na tiny little change but you know it\nreally changes the way that you view\nyour world and what you can and can't do\nif it changes the way that you view your\nlife it puts you into the driver's seat\nalso overwhelm almost never comes from\nwhat you're doing that's the funny thing\nabout it almost never comes from what\nyou're doing or what you have to do it\nalmost always comes from what you're are\nthinking about what you're doing\nthat's what it comes from you're\nthinking about all the stuff that you\nhave to do in the future you're thinking\nand thinking and thinking and thinking\nand thinking oh my gosh how much\nthinking do you think that you do\nthroughout the day so much thinking\nthroughout the day and then you think\nabout thinking you think about planning\nand you plan about planning it just\ndoesn't stop you don't stop and\noverwhelm is the feeling of like when\nyou have 40 things on your to-do list\nand you're like oh my God I'm so\noverwhelmed why are you overwhelmed it's\nbecause you're trying to think about and\nplan out all 40 of those things and take\naction on all 40 of them at one time but\nyou know you can only do one thing at a\ntime and so now that we've identified\nthat what overwhelm is why it occurs in\nyour body and how you are the one\ncreating it let's talk about the seven\ndifferent ways that you can actually get\nyourself free from this\noverwhelm okay number one first one and\nI've been giving this tip a lot like if\nyou're not doing this at this point and\nyou listen to podcast all the time you\ngot to get it together okay and that tip\nis you got to\nbreathe just chill for a second like\nchill the out for a little while\nright get your give your mind and your\nbody a little bit of a break just chill\nso many people are just\nso tense and like so stressed and so\nwound up all the time they feel like\nthey have to go go go go go and they\nalways have to be looking at something\nand they can't sit in their car for two\nminutes while their husband pumps the\ngas without staring at their\nphone the entire time right like it\ncould be three minutes of\nbreathing and if you're like oh my God I\ndon't have 2 minutes or I don't have 3\nminutes if you don't have 3 minutes to\nbreathe consciously you need 3 hours\nbecause you need to chill out right you\njust need to give yourself a break and\nso this breathing is just a chance for\nyou to take a break like you couldn't\nwork out all day long with no break\nwhenever you work out you work out hard\nand then you break and you work out hard\nand you break it's the exact same thing\ngive your mind a break for a little\nwhile CU eventually I'm just telling you\nand there's there's study after study\nafter study eventually all of this will\ncatch up to you if you don't slow down\nyou were not meant our bodies were not\nmeant to be go go go go go go go go go\nnon-stop if you look at all of the\nfastest animals the fastest predators in\nthis world a cheetah for instance a\ncheetah can go 60 miles an hour but it\ncan only go 60 miles an hour for like a\nminute and a half and then it's got to\nchill so if you look at a cheetah which\nis the fastest believe it's the fastest\nland\nanimal it's usually chilling most of the\nday and then it can go for 90 seconds\nbut you your mind is going like a\ncheetah all day long and there's no\nbreak so just give yourself a chance to\nbreathe go on to YouTube and look up\nfive minute breath work techniques and\njust do five minutes of breathing and\njust be more conscious and get into your\nbody and give your brain and your body a\nlittle bit of a break everyone who does\na breath work exercise with me whenever\nI do one of my lives like I said for M\ncementary University or any other\nprograms that I have all the time people\nare always like oh my God I feel amazing\nand it was only 3 minutes whenever they\nfirst do breath work cuz they don't\nrealize how much breathing can actually\nturn your inter change your internal\nstate so that's the first thing I'll\ngive you first tip just be more\nconscious do some breath work throughout\nthe day that's the first thing the\nsecond thing is one thing at a time get\nreally good at prioritizing and doing\none thing at a time I want you to\nimagine you come over to my house and I\ncook you dinner right I cook you a big\nold steak big old baked potato salad and\nyou look at the whole thing and you're\nlike oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my\nGod oh my God I can't how am I going to\neat this whole thing would you ever do\nthat no because when you eat you don't\ntry to fit the entire steak and baked\npotato and salad in your mouth at one\npoint in time how do you eat you eat one\nbite at a time it's the exact same thing\nfor everything in your life is you need\nto figure out all of the stuff that you\nneed to do that's overwhelming you like\ncrazy and you need to get better at your\nprioritization you need to prioritize\nthe things and then take action on them\nbecause you're not stressed about what\nyou have to do and taking that action\nyou're stressed because you're thinking\nabout all of the things that you have to\ndo and imagining all of them at once you\ncan only do one thing at a time you can\nonly take one bite at a time just take\nthe next bite so get better at your\nprioritization what's the most important\nget better at your time management one\nof the things that causes the most\noverwhelm it's like 95% of people that I\ntalk to on my different calls and\neverything that I run like 95% of people\nare complete at time management\nlike just terrible at time management go\non to YouTube type in how to get better\nat time management and actually start to\nget better at it you can go back and you\ncan listen to episodes where I've done\nit as well but you know like I did a I\ndid an episode that was that was kind of\non this as well and this kind of flows\ndirectly into number three um and number\nthree is to basically as you prioritize\nget better at your decisions like making\nyour decisions work on getting better at\nyour decisions and I did an episode on\nthis a couple months ago on um mastering\nyour decisions and there's this thing\ncalled the Eisenhower Matrix where uh\nDwight D Eisenhower made this and it's\nit's basically taking your to-do list\nand categorizing them by one of four\ndifferent things there's four different\ncategories they can go into there's\nurgent and important which are the\nthings that you want to do like\nimmediately there's important but not\nurgent which are the things you want to\ndo after you're urgent and important\nstuff there's urgent but not important\nand there's neither urgent nor important\nso those are the four categories\ncategory number one is urgent and\nimportant category number two is\nimportant but not urgent so it might be\nsomething that's due like next week\nCategory 3 is urgent but not important\nand category 4 is not urgent and not\nimportant and you start getting better\nat making your decisions and when you do\nthat you realize okay this thing that\nstressing me out is not due until next\nweek I don't need to worry about it so\nwhy don't I do the things that I need to\ndo today so I don't stress myself out as\nmuch so that's number three is get\nbetter at making your decisions okay\nnumber four is stop doing so many things\nat once like you're doing too many\nthings and let me explain what I mean\nbecause it's not the same as the other\ntwo stop saying yes to everything in\neveryone there's so many people out\nthere that are like yes men and yes\nwomen you're putting too much on your\nplate you're afraid to tell your friends\nno you're afraid to tell your boss no\nyou're afraid to tell your spouse no\nyou're afraid to tell your mom no and\nthen you have a million things on your\nplate that you have to do and so stop\ndoing so many things do less things but\ndo them better don't try to be a jack of\nall trades find the thing that you love\nand master something and so like for me\nwhen I talk with my business partner\nabout this what I always say is is you\nknow there's there's many ways to grow a\nbusiness there's a million ways to make\na million dollars and when you look at\nthe business that I have there's many\ndifferent things we could have 40\ndifferent courses and products and\ncategories and all of that stuff but\nreally what that comes down to is it's\ndoing a whole lot of things but not\ndoing a whole lot of things really well\nI'd rather instead of doing 40 things\nI'd rather do two or three things but be\nincredible at those two or three things\nand so number four is to stop doing too\nmany things do less but do them better\nand actually find something that you\nlove to do and try to master that thing\nas well so that's number four number\nfive another reason why you're so\noverwhelmed is because you're not doing\nenough of what you love you're mentally\nresisting things that you don't want to\ndo so you're like oh my gosh I've got to\ndo these things I've got to do these\nthings I've got to do this thing but\nthen you ask yourself like okay you have\nthe weekend off but on the weekend\ninstead you spend time scrolling on your\nphone and watching Netflix when in\nreality there's things that you love to\ndo that you haven't done in a while and\nso make a list of things that you love\nto do and those things that make you\nhappy and look at that in the morning\nand plan those things out how can you\nbring more of those things into your day\nand you're not doing enough of what you\nlove so people that think overwhelm is\ndoing too\nmuch sometimes but a lot of times it's\nnot doing enough of what you love to do\nand so how can you actually start to\nmake a list and figure out what is that\nyou love to maybe you haven't maybe used\nto play tennis in high school and you\nhaven't played tennis in six years\nbecause you've been so damn busy how can\nyou play more tennis\nright what what would it look like for\nyou to play more tennis so when you get\noff of work you can go and play for an\nhour or two with a friend or play some\npickle ball do more of what you love\nbecause that's a mental break from all\nof these things that maybe you don't\nreally love that you do throughout the\nday so number five is do more things\nthat you love number six this is really\nimportant is to train for stress\ntolerance so try to get good at training\nfor your stress tolerance what do I mean\nby that um a lot of people like comfort\nand the problem with Comfort is that\nyou're not trained for stress you're not\ntrained to stress and then D d-stress\nand so one of the things that I like to\ndo is when I work out I work out really\nhard in a set and this is a a tip that a\nfriend of mine gave me years ago that's\nreally good at training your nervous\nsystem he said do a really hard set and\nthen give yourself the 60 seconds off or\n90 seconds off but instead of picking up\nyour phone again and scrolling on\nInstagram or talking to somebody else I\nhave a a gym that's in my garage I'll do\na really hard set and then I'll close my\neyes and I'll set a timer for 60 seconds\nand I'll just concentrate on just in\njust really slow breathing so what I do\nis I get my my brain and body to a very\nheightened State during the workout\nduring a set and then I calm myself in\nmy nervous system back down and then the\nnext set I get myself to a heightened\nState and I calm myself back down and a\nheightened State i n my I calm myself\nback down so it's stress destress stress\ndestress St like stress destress and you\nrest and you close your eyes and what\nyou're doing is you're training yourself\nyour nervous system your body that when\nyou're in a very heightened State you\nknow how to self sooe and get yourself\ndown to a calm State and so that's what\nyou can you can actually train yourself\non stress tolerance another this is the\nreason why you see ice baths and every\nlike it's like everybody's talking about\nice baths nowadays is because your body\nfreaks out during an ice bath and your\nbody's like we're going to die get out\nof the water and your body is saying\nthat it tries to get your mind to think\nthe same thing and what you do is you\ncalm your mind down and as you calm your\nmind down you calm your body down and so\nthat's a stress d-stress and so you're\nactually training your nervous system to\ncalm down it's another really good thing\nwith like saunas like I have a ice bath\nthat I use that's in my garage I also\nhave a sauna and so when I'm in the\nsauna and my heart rate really starts to\nget up what I focus on is I can feel my\nheart rate literally through my chest\njust beating and I focus on slowing it\ndown stress d-stress and so I'm training\nmyself for for stress tolerance which I\ndon't think really many people are\ntrained with in the first place or know\nto do this in the first place so that's\nthat's number six and number seven is to\na little bonus for you is a stress\nJournal whenever you're stressed and you\nfeel like you got too much going on\nyou're too overwhelmed put it all on\npaper there's a couple benefits of it\nnumber one you start to become more\naware of what stresses you out so that\nyou can avoid it or you can plan to\nd-stress yourself and number two is you\nget it all out of your brain and so a\nlot of times when we get stressed out we\njust sit there and we think about about\nit we ruminate and there's so much\ngoing through our heads we don't even\nknow what to think cuz we think and then\nmore things come up and it gets worse\nand worse and worse and worse when you\nmake a stress Journal it's really good\nthe reason why is because you can sit\nthere and you can say okay what is\nstressing me out right now this thing is\nstressing me out and you get it all out\nof your brain which is a benefit and the\nnext thing is you start to notice\npatterns of what's making you stressed\nand you can start avoiding those things\nso you don't get a stressed so those are\nthe seven tips for you to help you out\nwith uh being less stressed and less\noverwhelmed number one get good at\nbreathing number two do one thing at a\ntime number three master your decisions\nnumber four start stop doing too many\nthings and start doing less things but\ndoing better number five do more of what\nyou love number six train your brain and\nyour body for stress tolerance and then\nnumber seven create a stress Journal so\nthat's what I got for you for
