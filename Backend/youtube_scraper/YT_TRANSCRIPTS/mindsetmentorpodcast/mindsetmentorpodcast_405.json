    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to stop\nsuffering all too often the thing that\nmakes us suffer more than anything else\nin the world is this thing right here\nand so what we're going to be talking\nabout is how to get yourself out of a\nstate of suffering and into a beautiful\nstate how to become aware of when you go\ninto suffering and a step-by-step\nprocess to get you back into a beautiful\nstate so if you're interested go ahead\nand tune in to today's video our\nrealities for the majority people not\neverybody is it this way but for the\nmajority people right now listening your\nlife is pretty good it's in a pretty\ngood situation and it might not be where\nyou want it to be it's actually probably\nnot where you want it to be because you\nare listening to this podcast but really\nif you start to look around you you can\nrealize that the majority of your life\nis actually quite beautiful and it's\nsomething that we should start focusing\non is the the stuff around us that is\ngood versus the stuff around us that is\nbad because there's really only two\nstates of being that you could be in at\none point in time you could be in a\nbeautiful state or you could be in a\nstate of suffering those are the two\nstates that you could be in and I don't\nmean like it's just a completely\nbeautiful Blissful state every single\nminute or it's a complete suffering\nstate every single minute in life we\nhave varying degrees of each of these at\nany point in time so let's talk about\neach state and how you can kind of\nidentify which states you're actually in\nso the first one we look at a beautiful\nstate beautiful state can be categorized\nby Happiness by Love by the feeling of\nPeace the feeling of gratitude and being\ngrateful for what you have uh it can be\nthe state of feeling Compassion or\nfeeling excitement for what's going on\nreally it's an underlying tone of the\njust the tone of your life is peace in\nsome sort of way things are okay right\nnow there's nothing to worry about and\nthat's the feeling that's the underlying\nfeeling throughout your life when you're\nin a beautiful state you are comfortable\nin the world you're comfortable in your\nown skin and you just have a feeling a\nsense of ease just\na that right there would be what I'm\ntalking about when I'm talking about\nbeing in a state that is a beautiful\nState uh you're at ease and when you're\nat ease the people around you can sense\nthe way that you feel and people end up\nbeing more comfortable around you people\nend up being uh more calm and more at\nease from your presence because how you\nshow up will change how other people\nfeel around you as well and you will\nthen in turn put more people at ease\nbecause your presence affects everyone\nthat you come in contact with whether\nyou realize it or not your presence is\nalways affecting people that are around\nyou and a beautiful state the important\nthing to realize about a beautiful state\nis it's not about the situation or the\ncircumstances of your life which most\npeople think oh well I can be in a\nbeautiful state if my life is exactly\nwhat I want it to be if I have what I\nwant if my my husband acts the way that\nI want him to do or if my father starts\ntreating me the way that I want to then\nI will be at a state of ease no a\nbeautiful state is not about the\nsituation it's not about the\ncircumstance it's about how you are\nfeeling about your life how you are\nfeeling about your circumstances what\nyou are thinking about the circumstances\nin your life that right there is a\nbeautiful state now on the other side of\nthat is a state of suffering which from\nwhat I have found is actually a state\nthat most people tend to live in more\noften than not so a stress a um\nsuffering State could be stress could be\nthe feeling of anxiety the feeling of\nconstantly worrying fear for what\nsomething might happen coming in the\nfuture uh anger around something that\nhappened to you or the way someone's\nacting uh sadness boredom it's an if if\na beautiful state is an underlying tone\nof peace and ease a suffering state is\nthe underlying tone of something is not\nright you are not at ease you are not\nwor where you want to be and your\nnervous system might feel on guard the\nentire time as if your nervous system is\njust kind of sitting there waiting to be\nattacked so you're kind of on guard all\nthe time there is no ease in a state of\nsuffering it is just the feeling of of\nwhat's going to attack me next fear fear\nfear worry worry worry and constantly\ntrying to protect and be in a state\nwhere you can protect yourself and you\nbeing uneasy makes other people uneasy\nbeing around you and so if you're uneasy\nand you think that you're faking it and\nyou think that no one else is noticing\nit I promise you everyone else that you\ncome in contact with is subconsciously\nnoticing the the vibe that you're at and\nif you're uneasy you're 100% going to\nmake other people uneasy being around\nyou as well so one of the most most\nimportant decisions that you'll ever\nmake in your life is what state you're\ngoing to be in at any moment and once\nagain what I said is one of the most\nimportant decisions that you will ever\nmake is what state you're going to be in\nbecause it is a decision now mind you\nwhen I say this when I say you make this\ndecision it doesn't mean that you make\nthis decision in your that way forever\nit's not like you're like you know what\nRob's right I'm going to be in a\nbeautiful state and then you make the\ndecision and then until the day you die\nyou're just in a beautiful state you're\nnot going to be there forever I promise\nyou that you're human and being a human\nlet's be real is really hard\nsometimes right there's ups there's\nDowns there's great days there's bad\ndays there's Great Moments there's bad\nmoments you could be having a really\ngreat day you could be in a complete\nBlissful State it's just you wake up you\nfeel good you had your coffee you hung\nout with your children you took your dog\nfor a walk everything was amazing and\nthen something happens right and you'll\nreact and that reaction will then put\nyou into a state of suffering and then\nyou find yourself in a state of\nsuffering so it's not about never going\ninto a state of suffering because that\nwill never happen we probably will never\nget to that point of complete\nEnlightenment for the rest of our life\nwe'll probably never get there but what\nit's about is when we notice ourselves\nslip into a state of suffering is\nrecognizing that you put yourself in\nthat state that you were the person who\nput yourself in that state nobody else\nput you in that state and no external\ncircumstances put you in that state and\nwhat it is then at that point is taking\nthe necessary action once you notice\nthat you're in a state of suffering to\nput yourself back into a beautiful state\nso let me give you a few examples just\nto kind of make give us some more\ncontext for this to make sense to you\nokay let's say that you have a lot going\non at work right now we've all been in\nthis situation right and you've got a\ndeadline that's coming up next week and\nyou've got a lot that has to be done in\nthe next week and you don't know if\nyou're going to make the deadline and\nyou're kind of worried about making the\ndeadline and you're stressed about how\nmuch you have to do in the next week so\nall day long when you're at work even\nwhen you're home from work you're\nworrying you're stressed you're anxious\nabout your work\nand this is super common right like I've\nfound myself here many times and you've\nprobably found yourself there many times\nas well where you have a deadline\napproaching there's a lot that you have\nto do there's underlying stress there's\nanxiety there's the feeling of of not\nreally being at ease but even though you\nmight have something coming in next week\nnext Wednesday you have this thing that\nis due in this moment right now what's\nwrong are you okay are you safe yeah you\nare so what can you do the first thing\nyou can do is bring yourself to this\npresent moment and realize that you know\nthat thing that's coming up is not right\nnow it's coming up next week it's coming\nup next\nWednesday so what do we do we bring\nourselves back to this present moment\none of the best best ways to do that is\nbreathing techniques and you know I've\noffered this many times and one of the\nthings that I do multiple times a day is\njust six deep breaths in through the\nnose out through the mouth and when I\nbreathe out through the mouth it's a\nlong exhale I can breathing out through\na straw another another thing that I do\nquite often as well is I'll go on to\nYouTube I do this every morning before I\nI meditate and I do this multiple times\na day I'll go on to YouTube and I'll\nfind bre uh breath work techniques so\nsometimes I just go into YouTube and I\ntype in five minute breath work\nsometimes I do 10-minute breath work\ndepending on how much time I have and\nthe breath work techniques brings you\nback to the present moment and then what\nyou do is now that you're present you've\ngot yourself to a calm centered State\nfeeling at least not as stressed not as\nanxious because when your emotions are\nhigh your logic is low now that you are\nin the present moment and you're here\nyou make a list of all of the things\nthat need to be done by that deadline\nand so you make this this giant list and\nlooking at that list might be like oh my\nGod I don't know if I'm going to get all\nthis done but what you can do is you can\nlook at them and you can prioritize them\nthis is number one this is number two\nthis is number three and then what you\ndo to make yourself feel better is you\ntake action on number one cuz number two\nand number three don't matter that much\nright now what matters is number one so\nI noticed myself being stressful I\nnoticed that I was in stress and anxiety\nI realize I can't do everything at once\nI can't you know how do you eat an\nelephant one bite at a time so what's\nthe first bite that I need to take to\nmake myself feel better so I noce myself\nstressed and anxious what am I stressed\nand anxious about I'm stressed and\nanxious about this thing that's coming\nup next Wednesday okay what can I do\nright now I'll bring myself back to this\npresent moment I'll do some breathing\ntechniques I'll make a list of my to-do\nlist that needs to be done for that I\nwill prioritize number one number two\nnumber three the three most important\nthings on that list and then I take\naction on number one either way the\ndeadline will eventually be here if\nhopefully we will all make it in our\nlives to next Wednesday and we'll still\nbe alive by next Wednesday so the the\ndeadline will eventually be here and if\nwe're being real you will probably get\nit all done and so you could get it all\ndone with this feeling of stress and\nanxiety and worry and just white\nknuckling your way through the next week\nor you know and with that just so you\nknow when you're when you're stressed\nand you're white knuckling and it's\nstress anxiety and pushing yourself and\nworry and all of that you have massive\namounts of quarter all in Adrenaline\nthat's fall that's flowing through your\nbody and that's putting your body at\nunnecessary stress it's all running\nthrough your veins and then what happens\nyou're so stressed out at work you get\nhome from work and that stress carries\nin and maybe because of it you're a\nlittle bit more short fused with your\nchildren and you snap at your children\nand you're like oh my God I just snapped\nat my children I just yelled at them\nbecause of the fact that I'm so stressed\nout at work or maybe you snap at your\nyour spouse because of all the stuff\nthat's happening at work and now you\nrealize that your feeling of stress and\nanxiety is is not just you it's now\npeople around you it's affecting now\nyou're not just affecting yourself but\nyou're affecting the people that you\nlove the most as well or you can see it\nand you could say okay I see the reason\nwhy I'm stressed it's because I'm seeing\nall of the stuff that I have to do and\nI'm just a human I can only do one thing\nat a time I realize that and so if I you\nknow if I'm eating an entire elephant I\ncan only eat it one bite at a time\nwhat's the first thing that I can do I\nget myself into a calm State and then\nwhat I do is I take take the first\naction I take the first bite wouldn't\nyou agree that you probably take better\naction when you're calm centered and\nfocus versus stressed worried pissed off\nlike a kid throwing a temper tantrum\nmentally you know like you're mentally\nthrowing a temper tantrum oh my god I've\ngot so many things I've got to do all\nright chill out just come back to the\npresent moment chill out just a little\nbit because all too often we're freaking\nout about these things you're going to\nget it done I know you will you know you\nwill\nso that's a really good example of the\ncircumstance is the same you still have\nto do the report or whatever it is that\nyou have coming up next week but you\ncould do it from a a stressed out\nsuffering state or you can get yourself\ninto a beautiful state and get some\nquality work done another example let's\nsay you know you uh you woke up this\nmorning and you're you're having a great\nday and you're on time you leave your\nhouse on time to go to work and out of\nnowhere it's a route that you take every\nsingle morning you hit a ton of traffic\nand you look at your Google Maps and\nyou're like oh my God I'm going to be 20\nminutes late and so I've done this many\ntimes because I hate being late and you\nyou're sitting there just so pissed off\nI left on time what's going on why can't\nthese people drive correctly you know\nmaybe somebody got into an accident and\nyou're like oh my gosh nobody knows how\nto drive in this city and you know what\nare people going to think about me when\nI show up late we have this important\nmeeting I'm going to look like an idiot\nwalking into the meeting late and you're\njust once again just white knuckling\nyour way through this traffic or once\nagain that would be a suffering state or\nin a beautiful state you know you can't\nmove the traffic along you can't make\ntraffic go faster and so you could be\npissed off the entire way or you could\nrealize there's nothing I can do about\nit I cannot change this traffic you take\na few deep breaths once again you get\nyourself centered and calm and a little\nbit more focused you bring yourself to\nthe present moment and you're like\nthere's nothing I can do about this I\ncan't change this what can I do if I'm\ngoing to be arriving at work I can\narrive out really pissed off because of\nhow I was just suffering the entire way\nor I could arrive at work I'm still\ngoing to be 20 minutes late no matter\nwhat I could arrive at work in a really\ngood mood I could put on my favorite\nsong I can get myself feeling good I can\nthink about all the things I have to be\ngrateful for once again it doesn't\nchange the circumstance which is the\ntraffic what changes is the way that you\nare viewing the circumstance of your\nlife and you could view it to put\nyourself into a state of suffering or\nyou could view it to put yourself into a\nbeautiful state you put on your favorite\nsong and you say you know what I'm going\nto make the decision that I'm going to\nput myself into a beautiful state either\nway so when you look at a beautiful\nState versus a suffering State a\nbeautiful state is expansive feeling\nexpansive and feeling it one with things\na suffering state is contraction you\nknow when you feel more expansive more\nis available to you more energy is\navailable to you more creativity is\navailable to you um more ideas are\navailable to you it's almost like you\nopen your your yourself physically and\nmentally emotionally spiritually to the\nworld around you and you're like hey I'm\nopen let's see what can come in you know\na beautiful state is being creative\nsuffering state is being closed a\nbeautiful state is feeling empowered a\nsuffering state is feeling disempowered\na\nbeautiful state is feeling like\nconnected with\neverything uh a suffering state is I'm\nall alone a beautiful state is\npossibility and opportunities around us\na suffering state is problems finding\nall my problems a beautiful state is\nfeeling trusting and knowing and having\nfaith a suffering state is feeling\nprotective and close cled off and the\nworld is working against me a beautiful\nstate is things feel more effortless and\nthey tend to flow more a a suffering\nstate is just struggling your way\nthrough things a beautiful state is\nabundance and so much around you\nscarcity is a suffering State lack not\nhaving what you\nwant a beautiful state is I get to do\nthis I choose to do this I'm the creator\nof my life a suffering state is I have\nto do this I'm the victim of my my\ncircumstance a beautiful state is\ncurious and being open to the world a a\nsuffering state is closed and not being\nopen and our brains will respond to\nwhatever state you're in it will and\nmore is available to you more energy\nmore ideas everything there's more\navailable to you when you're in a\nbeautiful state so then how do you get\nyourself back into a beautiful state\nwhen you notice you're in a state of\nsuffering okay so this is five simple\nsteps very simple number one become\naware become aware that you are in a\nstate of suffering and then what do you\ndo that's number one okay I'm aware I'm\nnoticing that I'm feeling a certain way\nnumber two take ownership it's you who\nhave put yourself in that state the way\nthat you're looking at your situation is\nwhat puts you in that state and you're\nthe one looking at it and that's\nimportant because it puts you into a\nplace of power when you decide that\nyou're no longer the victim of your\ncircumstance but you're the creator of\nyour circumstance and you're the Creator\nit put you into a place of power because\nif you put yourself in that state then\nyou can get yourself out of that state\nbut if you're like oh well I didn't put\nmyself in the state well then you're\nhelpless there's nothing you can do\nabout it and so number two is to take\nownership I did this to myself and I got\nmyself here I can get myself out of it\nnumber three is to come back to the\npresent moment because the mind is\nalmost always in the past or it's always\nin the future but it's very rarely here\nthe mind is in fear the mind is in\nsuffering the mind is in worry the mind\nis in anxiousness the mind is in\nprotection mode the body is always in\nthe present moment your mind is always\nsomewhere else right our minds are\nalways somewhere else your body it's\nhere it's in the present\nmoment okay so what do we need to do we\nneed to come back to the present moment\nhow do we also come back to the present\nmoment breathing breath work on YouTube\nit takes five minutes a few minutes you\ncan do it you know if you're in traffic\nand you notice yourself getting really\nstressed and you're stopped you can go\non YouTube right now and you can\nliterally listen you know put in YouTube\nfive minute breathing Technique One your\nstoplight or whatever it might be and\nyou could do the breathing obviously\nDon't Close Your Eyes or do anything\nthat's going to make you pass out but\nyou can do the breathing to calm your\nbody and nervous system down and so come\nback to the present moment number four\nis ask yourself if you're driving or if\nyou're out and you don't have a pen and\npaper or if you do have a pen and paper\nyou can Journal it what can I do right\nnow to make myself feel better examples\ncould be like take action uh on that\nnext deadline like we I said in the the\nfirst example I gave you another example\nthat I gave you was putting on your\nfavorite song what can I do right now to\nget myself into a better state so that's\nnumber four and number five is to focus\non gratitude more you have to learn just\nto be more grateful there's so much if\nyou're listening to this podcast you\nhave so much to be grateful for there's\nso much that's always happening in\nthe world so many terrible things that\nare always happening all over the place\nyou are probably okay right now you're\nprobably safe so why don't you just try\nto come from a place of gratitude every\nmorning think about what you're grateful\nfor set your internal GPS to be more\ngrateful for what you have in your life\nso those are five steps to get yourself\ninto a beautiful state but really what\nit comes down to is notice that you're\nalways in one of two states become aware\nof it take ownership of it and then take\nthe necessary actions to get yourself\ninto the state that you want to be in so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me at Rob dial Jr r o d i a l Jr and\nwith that I'm GNA leave you the same way\nI leave you every
