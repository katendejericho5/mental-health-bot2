    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the secret to\ngetting better every single day if\nyou're watching this video you've\nprobably realized life is a journey and\nit's a long journey all too often we get\ncaught up in what we're supposed to be\ndoing what we're not doing and we think\nthat we should be further along than we\ncurrently are in today's episode I'm\ngoing to teach you how to get better\nevery single day so that when you look\nback 2 3 4 5 years down the road you're\na different person let's dive in your\nlife is a journey\nand hopefully if you listen to this\npodcast you've come to realize that you\nhave decided hopefully you've decided\nthis at least you have decided that you\nare going to take the path of\nself-improvement self-development you're\ngoing to work on yourself every single\nday today we're going to talk about that\nJourney that you're on because hopefully\nyou're on the journey to deciding you're\ngoing to be you have decided you're\ngoing to be on this journey of taking\naction to become better every day\nbecause we're going to talk about that\nand I don't I don't see self-improvement\nas something that you do sometimes I\ndon't see it as like oh I read during\nthe morning and I meditate during the\nmorning but then I leave my house and\nI'm an no it's like I'm trying\nto constantly improve and use life as\nfeedback as a mirror all the time for\nwhere I need to improve where I'm doing\nwell what I can get better at all of\nthat I see it as a lifestyle something\nthat I literally do all of the time the\nsame way that if you're going to go and\ntry to lose weight you're going to have\nto you could you could go on a diet if\nyou want to for 90 days but then if you\ngo back to your old lifestyle you're\ngoing to gain all the way back so in\norder to really make a change it's not a\ndiet it's a lifestyle change\nself-improvement in your mind in your\nsuccess in your bank account in your\nrelationships in your joy your happiness\nyour peace all of that needs to become a\nlifestyle for you and it's about\nbecoming better every single day now\nmost people they get on the path of\nself-development and then two months\nlater they're like I'm not where I want\nto be\nokay well it's only been two months you\nhave to go on this journey and realize\nthere's not going to be a huge\ndifference in your life immediately it's\nusually going to take years for things\nto be different a year two years three\nyears five years what it's about is\nbecoming 1% better every single day my\nbook was actually going to be called 1%\nbetter every day before I changed it to\nlevel up I just felt 1% better every day\nwas you know not as direct it wasn't as\nshort it wasn't as sexy level up just\nsound a little bit sexier but really\nwhat I think we need to be focusing on\nis being 1% better every single day and\nhere's the reason why your current\ncircumstances in your life are the\nlagging results of your habits of your\ncharacter traits of your behaviors all\nof the things that you did at one point\nin time in the past so if you look at\nyour life right now and you love your\nlife it's because you took actions to\nget you to where you are right now so\nthat you would love this life if you\nlook at your life right now and you\ndon't like your life it's because you\ntook actions you took actions in the\npast to get you to where you currently\nare and one of the first things that you\nhave to do is stop blaming everybody\nelse for your past and where you\ncurrently are and you have to say okay I\nam where I am because of me which means\nthat if I want to be somewhere\ndifferent later on down the road a year\nor two years down the road it's also\ncomes down to me nobody else and the\nthing about results is that the results\nof your life don't come right away so\nwhere you are now is based off of what\nyou did 6 months ago what you did a year\nago two years ago if you don't like\nwhere you are you chose to be there\nmaybe subconsciously you chose to be\nthere and you weren't really being\nintentional but you chose to be there in\nsome sort of way based off of the\ndecisions that you made in the past\nbased off the decisions to take certain\nactions or not take certain actions in\nthe past and that's why trying to change\ncan be really depressing is because your\nresults don't come right away you don't\nsee results immediately you know you\ndon't leave the gym and tomorrow have a\nsix-pack\nright you would never expect that to\nhappen that'd be ridiculous if you went\nto the gym for the first time today woke\nup tomorrow and you're like what the\nhell I don't have a six-pack it's the\nsame thing for your life you're not\nimmediately going to get results now if\nyou go to the gym you could have a\nsix-pack in six months you could have a\nsix-pack in a year if you take the right\nactions you could 100% have a six-pack\nin two years but it's not going to\nhappen immediately it's the same thing\nwith the rest of your life with your\nbusiness with your relationships is that\nthe results don't come immediately they\nusually come a few months down the road\n6 months down the road a year down the\nroad and so what you have to realize is\nyour habits come from the story that\nyou're telling yourself about\nyourself and so if you want to change\nyour life you have to really take a step\nback and ask yourself what in this\nwhat's the story that I'm telling myself\nabout myself what's the narrative that I\nsay in my head all the time what is the\nstory stuck in my head if it's something\nlike I am lazy that's not going to help\nyou create the life that you want I\nprocrastinate that's not going to help\nyou create the life life that you want\nbeing overweight runs in my family\nthat's not going to help you create the\nbody that you want oh I prefer to sleep\nin every day that's not going to help\nyou create the life that you want oh I\nlove too much I love food too much to\nlose weight that's not going to help you\ncreate the life that you want it all\ncomes back to your identity what are you\ntelling yourself about yourself because\nyour actions are going to come from your\nidentity and so your actions and your\nhabits will stem from what you believe\nabout\nyourself if you think that you're\noverweight because your entire family is\nwhy would you work out why would you\never eat healthy because you're going to\nbe weight overweight either way right so\nyou might as well not do those things\nand so the first thing that we need to\ndo if we want our life to change is we\nneed to change the story that we tell\noursel about oursel you know like\nthere's it's like the story and i' I've\nsaid it many times in this podcast but\nit's like the story of the the two twins\nwho have an alcoholic father and later\non down the road they go to one of the\ntwins who's an alcoholic and his life is\nin shambles and they ask you why are you\nan alcoholic he says I'm an alcoholic\nbecause my father was an alcoholic so he\ndecided to take the same route of his\nfather they go to the other twin who's a\nsuccessful CEO of a company and they say\nwhy are you not an alcoholic and he says\nI'm not an alcoholic cuz my father was\nan alcoholic those two children had the\nexact same life circumstances growing up\nbut what they decided was the story that\nthey're going to tell thems about their\nchildhood about who they are who they're\ngoing to be it's the exact same life\ndifferent story so what's the story that\nyou're telling yourself if you want to\nchange your behaviors\ntrue Behavior change is actually a\nchange in your\nidentity this is something that people\nnever really think about true Behavior\nchange is identity\nchanging the thing of this is who I am\nwill dictate what you do almost all of\nyour actions will stem from what you\nthink of\nyourself there's proof of the decisions\nthat you're making all around you if you\ndon't have the money that you that you\nwant in your bank account do you have a\nstory in your head running a of oh yeah\nwell I'm terrible with money oh I come\nfrom a part of town that you know nobody\nmakes any money my my people don't make\nmoney is that what you're telling\nyourself well your bank account is going\nto reflect that you know your bank\naccount is the result of your spending\nhabits your bank account is also the the\nresult of your your earning\nhabits so what habits do you need to\nchange your body is a result of your\neating habits and your working out\nhabits your business is a result of your\nhard work and dedication and work habits\nso if you look at your if you don't like\nyour bank account what are you telling\nyourself about your bank account and\nmoney if you don't like your body what\nare you telling yourself about your body\nif you don't like your business and it's\nnot where you want it to be what are you\ntelling yourself about your business if\nyou don't like your relationship with\nyour spouse what are you telling\nyourself about you how who you are in\nrelationships and what are you telling\nyourself about your spouse if you don't\nlike your relationship with your\nchildren what are you telling yourself\nabout what type of parent you are we're\nall telling ourselves a story in all\nthese different categories of our life\nand so so if we're looking at a specific\ncategory of our life and we don't like\nwhere we are and we wish it were be were\ndifferent the first question asks\nourselves is what am I telling myself\nabout this\nthing because every action that you take\nis a vote for the person that you wish\nto become one of my favorite quotes from\nJames Clear is that every action that\nyou take is a vote for the person that\nyou wish to become if you wake up early\nin the morning and you don't hit the\nsnooze you are taking the action you're\ncasting the vote to be the person who\nwakes up early in the morning who has a\nmorning routine who wakes up and decides\nto to pour into thems before they pour\ninto everybody else if you decide hey\nyou know what I'm going to go ahead and\nhit the snooze button well that is a\nvote for the type of person who sleeps\nin who doesn't wake up who doesn't do\nthe morning routine if you decide to go\nto the gym that's a vote for a person\nwho decides to put their physical\nfitness as a priority for them if you\ndecide to skip the gym that is a vote\nfor the type of person who ends up\nthinking that their physical fitness is\nnot as important for them if you decide\nthat you're going to come home early\nfrom work so you can spend time with\nyour children that is a vote for you\nbecoming a better parent if you decide\nthat you're going to work late when you\nwere supposed to be home and maybe pick\nyour CH children up at school but you\nhad your spouse pick them up instead\nthat is a vote for the type of parent\nwho decides that they want to work\ninstead of be around their children and\nI obviously there's variables and\neverything in life but really you got to\nstart asking yourself if every action\nthat I take is a vote for the person I\nwish to\nbecome where are the majority of my\nvotes going for like where are they\ngoing in my life and the thing I like\nabout the way that James Clear puts it\nas well is in order to win an election\nyou don't need 100% of the votes you\njust need the majority and so what you\nwant to make sure is that the majority\nof your actions are going in the right\ndirection because you'll never be\nperfect you're going to screw up all of\nthe time but you know if if you're in a\na a a really great workout routine and\nyou're changing your lifestyle and you\nknow maybe you did really good for 17\ndays in your eating habits and then one\nday you have a moment of weakness which\nhappens to all of us right you have a\nmoment of weakness you end up eating a\nlot of candy or you end up chowing down\non a pizza or whatever it might be what\nmost people do is then they guilts they\nshame thems they say I'm not good enough\nI knew I was going to this up and\nthey get really down on themselves for\nthat one moment of weakness versus the\n17 days that you did really good so you\ncast it a vote for the person that you\nwant to become 17 times to be the type\nof person who cares about their physical\nfitness who wants to live longer who\nwants to be more mobile who wants to be\naround for their children their\ngrandchildren whatever it might be and\nyou casted one vote for the person who\nyou know loves ice cream or the person\nwho loves pizza right you're you're\ngetting way more votes in the right\ndirection which is the important thing\nbut most of the time what we end up\ndoing we screw up we guilt oursel we\nshame oursel I knew I couldn't do it I\nknew I was a screw up I knew this wasn't\ngoing to be good for me I knew I wasn't\ngoing to be able to do do this like I\nwanted to whatever it might be and we\njust kick oursel in the ass so really\nwhat it comes down to is can we start to\nnotice when we're taking the majority of\nour actions into the right direction and\nit's little teeny tiny habits every\nsingle day that's what really matters\nwhen I say get 1% better every single\nday it's little teeny tiny habits that\nyou don't recognize in the moment and\nyou don't recognize tomorrow but when\nyou fast forward 10 years life is\ncompletely different you know nobody\ndies from eating one\nhamburger nobody gets fit from doing one\npush-up nobody gets smarter from Reading\none book it's tiny habits that you make\nthroughout your lifetime that make you\nwho you are and when you fast forward\ntime is either your best friend or it is\nyour worst enemy because it's showing\nyou the decisions that you made in the\npast it's showing you your identity it's\nshowing your decisions it's showing you\nyour actions it's showing you your\nhabits so you need to decide who are you\nnot who have you been in the past but\nwho are you who do you decide to be from\nthis moment forward\nare you the type of person who sleeps in\nor are you the type of person who ends\nup waking up early and doing your\nmorning routine decide figure it out and\nend up being that person are you the\ntype of person who spends all of your\nmoney or you get really smart and you\nstart to save your money decide stop\nmessing around figure it out are you the\ntype of person that puts your physical\nfitness as a priority in your life are\nyou the type of person who decides to\nphysical fitness isn't a priority for\nyou decide stop just Lolly gagging\naround and be like well hopefully I do\nbetter because when we look at other\npeople we look at somebody on Instagram\nwho has the body that we want we only\nsee the end result there's success we\ndon't see all of the damn work that they\nput in over the past 2 three five seven\n15 years and we're looking going well I\nwant their body oh yeah well then put in\nthe damn work and get their body and\nthen we look at other people we're like\nwell look at them they're fly in first\nclass or they have a nice car they have\na nice house or they have a\nmulti-million dollar business I want\nthat well are you willing to put in the\nwork because you're looking at the end\nresult of all of their action for years\nand years and years and years and years\nand years are you willing to put in the\nwork to get there because if you're\nwilling to put in the work you can get\nthere you can get the business that you\nwant you can get the body that you want\nyou can get the physical fitness you can\nget the the relationship that you want\nyou could be the type of parent that you\nwant the Journey of a th000 miles begins\nwith a single\nstep when we start something brand new\nwe get excited oh it's going to be great\nand then two weeks in we're like why am\nI not at Mya 1000 because you're only at\nstep 14 dude you got to give yourself a\nchance these things take time great\nthings take a long time it's why people\nsay the phrase Rome wasn't built in a\nday because it takes time to build the\nbody that you want the relationship that\nyou want the business that you want the\nfinances that you want and then we get\nsad and we get pissed off because I've\nbeen doing this for 2 weeks why am I not\na millionaire yet I've been working out\nfor two weeks why am I not a why do I\nnot have the most perfect body ever why\ndo I not look like a chiseled Roman\nstatue after two weeks of working out\nbecause you're not there yet you have to\nput in the work and you have to remember\nthat every single day is a single step\nyou want to be at Mile 1,000 but you're\nonly 14 steps in you can't compare your\nchapter one to someone else's chapter 20\ncomparing yourself to other people I was\non um you know I I teach coaches how to\ngrow their coaching businesses we've\nbeen doing it for four years now we have\n1500 coaches that we've trained and one\nof the ladies was asking yesterday she\nwas saying I get really sad because I\ncompare my content to other people's\ncontent on Instagram and so I shared my\nscreen with everybody who had like 60\npeople on the call and I shared my\nscreen with everybody and I said okay\nthis is this is what what we tend to do\nso I went onto my YouTube and I showed\nlike I have whatever 250,000 followers\non YouTube and all of this is shot in 4k\nand we have three cameras running at one\ntime and all of this stuff we have I\nhave a studio that I've built and all of\nthis stuff because I've put eight years\nof work into it and I said this is what\nmost people are comparing themselves to\nwhich is something like this which\nsomething I've been doing for eight\nyears but I went back to my very first\nYouTube video of me talking about\nsomething with personal development that\nwas seven years ago almost eight years\nago it's about next month it'll be eight\nyears and it was it was shot for my\nphone it was shot with terrible lighting\nit was you know the the intro was\nterrible everything was terrible about\nit and I said the problem is is that\nmost of you guys are comparing yourself\nto someone like me now today with 1,400\npodcast episodes in tons and tons and\ntons of videos and content I've been\ncreating over the past eight years and\n4K cameras and all that stuff don't\ncompare yourself to me now compare\nyourself to rob in\n2016 that's what I want you to compare\nyourself with these are two different\npeople I might have the same name but\nI'm not the same person person\nthat I was and so don't compare yourself\nto me now compare yourself to me then\nokay that video only had 700 views and 8\nyears I got 756 views clearly it wasn't\nthat good it's still up there if you\nwant to go back and look at it anybody\ncan look at it if you if you really want\nto so what happens is We compare\nourselves to somebody we compare our\nchapter one to somebody else's chapter\n20 you can't compare yourself to someone\nelse's chapter 20 so who do you want to\nbe in 10\nyears what do you want your life to look\nlike you know I had a lady come up to me\njust going back to what I was talking\nabout a second ago I had her come up to\nme at an event like eight months ago and\nshe said hey Rob you know I've I\nfollowed your podcast for a while I know\nyou're one of the top 100 podcasts in\nthe world and I want to know how can I\nget to be one of the top 100 podcasts in\nthe world and I looked her dead in the\neye and I said do 1,400 episodes over\nthe next eight years and in eight years\nthere's a pretty good chance that you\nmight be one of the top 100 podcasts and\nshe was like yeah but what's the secret\nhack I was like there's not there is no\nsecret hack work is the hack because as\nyou do it you realize what works what\ndoesn't what you like what you don't\nlike but you improve but you've got to\nput in the work everybody wants the tips\nand tricks hey how can I get what pill\ncan I take to lose 75 pounds it doesn't\nexist work is the only thing exists so\nwho do you want to be in 10 years and do\nyour actions do your current actions\nline up with that life do your current\nactions line up with the person that you\nneed to be do your current actions look\nlike the habits and actions of the\nperson that you need to become because\nit's it's never really what you need to\ndo it's who you need to become and when\nyou become that person you automatically\ndo the things that you need to do you\nstop focusing on instant gratification\nyou realize that delayed\ngratification is what you should be\nworking for and it's a lot it's a lot\nless changes than you really realize\nit's just a couple small habits that you\nneed to do for a really long time maybe\nfive or 10 it's not 50 or 100 habits\nit's like you got to wake up earlier you\ngot to have a morning routine you got to\nmeditate you got to read you got to eat\nhealthy you got to stop procrastinating\nyou got to stop making excuses you you\ngot to take full ownership of your life\nyou've got to work out three to four\ntimes a week you've got to stop watching\nTV and the news it's not about being a\ncomplete different person tomorrow than\nyou are today it's about being 1% better\ntomorrow than you were today and that\nover time over years adds it up so\nyou've got to decide who you want to be\nin this journey what game are you going\nto play is this a hobby or is this a\nlifestyle are you going to you going to\ndedicate your life to being better the\nbest version of yourself or is this just\nsomething that you're trying out for a\nlittle while when you change and when\nyou decide to change is where you're\ngoing to find the most resistance so\nwhat you should do is identify three to\nsmall three or five small habits that\nyou need to change and then identify\nthem and start putting them into your\nday and start becoming that person and\nyou're not going to be better tomorrow\nbut you'll be a little teeny tiny bit\nbetter you're not going to be a\ncompletely different person but you'll\nbe a little bit better start focusing on\njust becoming a little bit better every\nsingle day fast forward years from now\nyou'll be a completely different person\na completely different life you'll be\nexcited that you took the actions that\nyou needed to to change your life so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories tag\nme at Rob dial Jr r o d i a l Jr and\nwith that I'm going to leave you the\nsame way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomebody else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
