    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode and if\nyou're out there and you love this\npodcast you'll probably love my new book\nthat just came out last month it is on\nthe psychology of taking action with\nover 73 scientific and psychological\nstudies to prove how to take action\nbased in scientific fact it is called\nlevel up how to get Focus stop\nprocrastinating and upgrade your life it\nis available wherever books are sold and\nonce again it is called level up today\nwe're going to be talking about why\npositive thinking hasn't really been\nworking for you I'm going to talk about\nwhy positive thinking doesn't work for a\nlot of people and then what I'm going to\ndo is talk about how to actually make it\nwork for you um it's funny because I\nhear a lot of people talk about positive\nthinking and they talk trash about\npositive thinking and they say oh that's\njust toxic positivity and you just\nyou're just saying when you're saying be\npositive you're saying you know just\nignore the negative and don't think of\nany of the bad things in your life think\nof only the good things I'm not saying\nthat at all what I'm saying is with\npositive thinking and negative thinking\nit's not just like a once a day kind of\nthing it should be the overall state of\nwho you are are you more of a\npessimistic person or even more of an\noptimistic person and I'm not saying at\nall ignore the negative pretend it\ndoesn't exist what I'm saying is if you\nhave a positive attitude you can then\ntake action to create whatever it is\nthat you need to from the negativity\nthat might be existing in your life\nthinking positive actually helps you\ncreate a better life and that's\nscientifically proven and so before we\ngo any further for those of you guys\nthat are a little bit skeptical I guess\nyou would say let's actually bring some\nT scientific studies in here and\npsychological studies to prove that this\nis not just a bunch of so there\nwas a study by uh Martin Seligman and\nthat was back in 2000 it was called\npositive psychology an introduction and\nit proved that positive emotions and\npositive thinking contribute to an\nindividual's well-being and their actual\nmonary success his research in the early\n2000s demonstrated that optimistic\npeople tend to be\nhealthier more successful and live\nlonger than their pessimistic\ncounterparts so think about that for a\nsecond a study was done in the 2000s and\njust you know it was just one study uh\nhe's considered like the father of\npositive psychology he started really\nresearching and going into in the early\n2000s but he found through all of his\nresearch that optimistic people tend to\nlive longer be healthier be more\nsuccessful and they live longer than\ntheir like I said than their pessimistic\ncounterparts so that's the benefit of\nthinking positive Okay cool so there is\nsome proof in that that's a good thing\nto know what about thinking negative\nlet's talk about that because for me I\nknow that for a very long time before I\ngot into self-development and reading\nand trying to improve myself I was\npessimistic as hell I made excuses about\neverything I always looked at the\nnegative side of things I used to just\nbe that way what would have happened if\nI would have stayed there and I would\nhave stayed that way well let's dive\ninto it uh Aaron Beck and just if you\ndon't know Aaron Beck is one of the\nfounding doctors in cognitive behavioral\ntherapy um he discovered that negative\nthinking patterns this is back in the\n70s and 80s that negative thinking\npatterns which he call cognitive\ndistortions but just remember negative\nthinking patterns are the central to the\ndevelopment in the maintenance of\ndepression and so if you want to be\ndepressed negative thinking patterns are\nCentral to the development of it and the\nkeeping of depression uh he had a ton of\ndifferent studies and writings that\nprovide a substantial data that shows\nhow patterns like all or nothing\nthinking overgeneralization and\ncatastrophizing contribute to depression\nlike symptoms so the negative thinking\nof all or nothing thinking the\novergeneralization of negative thinking\nand the catastrophizing which means like\nthinking that everything is just going\nto be terrible contribute to depressive\nsymptoms H interesting Robert are there\nany more studies there's a ton let me\ngive you one more a study that was done\nin 2000 at the Mayo Clinic found that\npessimism was associated with higher\nrisk of mortality this study found that\npessimists people who think negative had\na 19% higher risk of dying over a\n30-year period compared to\nOptimus so the research shows that\nthere's a link between your negative\nthinking and worse overall health\noutcomes interesting isn't that crazy if\nyou go back a few episodes ago I\nactually when I talk about the placebo\neffect I actually give some research\nthat shows when you think you are uh\nsick you will become more sick so\npositive thinking seems to be the way we\nwant to go negative thinking tends to\ncreate a worse life so negative thinking\ncreates a worse life positive thinking\ncreates a better life life so why the\nhell do you say that R negative thinking\ndoesn't work Rob well let me tell you\nwhy I'm going to tell you the way that\nmost people try to do positive thinking\nand then they're like this doesn't work\nfor me this isn't working this is BS I'm\ngoing to do something different right I\ncreated a video uh about four years ago\nnow it went crazy viral on uh Facebook\nand it did like 15 million views and the\nthe way that I described positive\nthinking really through this visual made\na lot of sense for people and so I had\nthis big this big glass bowl it was like\na fish bowl right and you know it's a\ncouple gallons and it was seethrough and\nI had water that was inside of it and\nwhat I said was imagine that you have\nthis big bowl of water and then I had I\nliterally had a scooper that had a bunch\nof dirt in it and every negative thought\nis just a scoop of dirt that you put\ninto that water a scoop of dirt that you\nput in that water a scoop of dirt that\nyou put in that water and so many people\ntalk so negative TOs and we live in such\na world that can tend to be so negative\nand we're surrounded by other negative\npeople as well and so we\nthink oh I have to fit in with other\npeople I'm dumb I'm ugly I'm fat I'm not\nacceptable I'm not what Society wants\nI'm not what my parents want I'm not\ngood enough I have failed relationship I\ndon't look as good as those Instagram\nmodels all of these advertisements are\ntelling me that I'm not good enough\neverything you know around me is\nnegative this person's Negative they\ntalk negative to me it's impossible to\ngo through life without getting scars\nand without being beaten down and so\nevery single one of those thoughts is\njust another scoop of dirt in that clean\nwater another scoop of dirt in that\nclean water another scoop another scoop\nanother scoop another scoop another\nscoop and people are just constantly\nscooping that dirt and putting it into\nthe water what would that water look\nlike after one day it would be\ncompletely muddy and dirty and then so\ndo people do they say okay I'm going to\nstart thinking positive so what did I do\nI haded a bunch of cups of water and I\nif you take one cup of water and you put\nit into that big dirty Bowl because of\nall the negative thoughts been put in\nthere and you put in one cup of water\nwhat happens does it clean the entire\nbowl no it doesn't clean the entire Bowl\nit just makes it a little bit the the\nwater level rais just a little bit but\nit's still almost just as dirty looking\nand people go well positive thinking\ndoesn't work because I tried it you know\nI told myself good job today and I'm\nlike well that was one thought that came\ninto your head what were the other 99%\nof thoughts oh that's right they were\nnegative weren't they so if you're\nputting more negative into the bowl more\ndirt into the bowl how could the Bowl\never be clean it won't be and then\npeople say well positive thinking\ndoesn't work no no no positive thinking\nworks it's just that you're thinking\npositive 1% of the time and 99% of the\ntime you're thinking negative and so the\nthe way that I actually showed this is I\ntook a hose and I turned the hose on and\nI put it in the bowl and what's cool is\nonce it starts going in the bowl it\nstarts spinning out all of the water all\nof the old water all of the old dirt\nstarts spinning and coming out of the\nwater and if you leave it there for\nabout 2 minutes that really dirty bowl\nof water now becomes Crystal\nClear what is that hose that hose is a\nconstant flow of positive thoughts\ncoming into your head and so if we want\nto be more positive it's not a sometimes\nthing it's not a half the day kind of\nthing it is a every moment that\nwe can kind of thing now will we slip\ninto some negative accidentally throw\nsome dirt in there yes so what do we\nneed to do we need to bring more\npositive in and once again this is not\ntoxic positivity and saying like oh\neverything's great when your life is\ncrumbling but it's saying hey no matter\nwhat happens I'm going to find some good\nto come out of this I'm going to figure\nout a way to make some positivity out of\nthis thing that might be negative you\nhave to learn to be your biggest fan you\nhave to stop talking so much trash to\nyourself so much trash around about the\npeople that are around you you can't\nthink that you're just going to and I\nalways use the example I think it was as\na man thinketh the book where he says\nyou you imagine your mind being a garden\nand you're the only one that contend to\nthis Garden you can't go and plant\nstrawberry seeds into your garden and\njust expect that tomatoes are going to\ngrow right like wouldn't that be crazy\nif I gave you strawberry seeds I put\nthem in the ground or you put them in\nthe ground and then you look at me and\nyou're like I'm so mad strawberries are\ngrowing I thought tomatoes are going to\ngrow wouldn't that be kind of crazy it\nwould well it's kind of same thing you\ncan't plant negative seeds in your mind\nall day long and look around and be like\nwell I don't know why I'm not positive I\ndon't know why I don't have a positive\nlife because you reap what you seow\nwhatever you plant in the ground you're\ngoing to get whatever you plant in your\nmind you're going to get so you can't be\nnegative to yourself all the time and\nthink well like why is my life suck you\nhave to learn to be your biggest fan you\nhave to learn to be your biggest\nsupporter you have to learn to speak\npositively about yourself about other\npeople around you stop judging people\nyou have to demand happiness in your\nlife you have to demand greatness in\neverything that you do so when you first\nhear about POS positive thinking you\nhave to think like well yeah maybe I am\nI do have a bowl of really really dirty\nwater and then you try positive thinking\nfor a week or you try positive thinking\nfor a couple days and you think oh my\nGod it doesn't work no you have to take\na step back and be like oh my God this\nwater is so dirty I need to flood this\nentire bowl with positive thinking and\neventually get as much dirt out of as I\npossibly can if you're having more\nnegative thoughts than positive thoughts\non a daily basis you're scooping more\ndirt into the water your water will\nalways be dirty positive thinking can't\nbe something that you just decide to try\nit's not a try kind of thing it's got to\nbe a lifestyle it's the same reason why\ndiets don't tend to work because it's\nnot a diet that you need it's a\nlifestyle change that you need so if\nyou're trying to to lose weight you\ncould lose 20 pounds and then go back to\nyour old lifestyle and then what happens\nyou gain it all back same thing's got to\nhappen if you want your body to be\ndifferent it's not a diet it's not a 60\ndays kind of thing it is a lifestyle\nchange it is a fundamental change in who\nyou are and what you do it is the exact\nsame for the way that you think it has\nto be a fundamental change in who you\nare and what you do you have to turn the\nhose on and leave it on all day long and\neventually all the water turns in a\ncrystal clear and it gets that dirt out\nbut you have to be super intentional\nabout it you have to notice when a\nnegative thought comes up when you\nnotice a negative thought come up what\ndo you do you might say replace it with\none positive thought no no no cuz trying\nto get the dirt out we're not trying to\ngo one for one so when you notice a\nnegative thought come up you replace\nthat negative thought with three\npositive thoughts you have to beat the\nnegativity out of your head you have to\nbeat the positivity into your head\nsometimes and start noticing you're\nfeeling shifting so a lot of times we\ndon't always notice our thoughts a lot\nof times what we notice first is our\nfeeling shift and they they start to\nshift to a bad feeling where it's you\nknow anxious or closed off or anger a\nfeeling that we don't want to feel you\nhave to take a step back and you have to\nin cogn behavioral therapy they ask you\nthis question when you notice your\nfeeling shift ask yourself the question\nwhat was I just\nthinking what was I just thinking\nbecause a lot of times we have a what\nthey call automatic thoughts automatic\nthoughts kind of seep in and we don't\neven notice them because we're only\nconsciously thinking 5% of our thoughts\n95% of our thinking is actually\nsubconscious so a lot of times these\nautomatic thoughts will of negativity\nwill just kind of sneak in so we don't\nnotice the thought but what we do notice\nis that we notice the way that we feel\nchanges and it might shift towards a\nnegative state that we don't want to\nfeel start feeling bad and so what do we\ndo at that point in time we ask\nourselves what was I just thinking we\nstart thinking about what it is oh I\nthink I can identify why I'm thinking\nthis way and then what we want to do is\nwe want to test the validity of those\nthoughts those thoughts that you were\njust thinking that made you feel bad are\nthey\ntrue and a lot of times we're like yeah\nthey are true and then I say okay is it\nwritten into the fabric of the universe\nwell no it's not okay then it's not true\nbecause only truth is written into the\nfabric of the universe if your thoughts\nand your beliefs are not true they're\nnot written to the fabric of the\nuniverse so it's not that it's truth\nit's just a belief that you have and\njust FYI because you believe something\nand have believed it for a really long\ntime doesn't make it true it doesn't it\njust means it's a thought pattern that\nyou're continuing to hold on to that you\nhave had for years and years and years\nand years a belief is not absolute truth\nit's very important for you to know this\nit's super important to know this just\nbecause you believe it doesn't make it\ntrue and just because you've been beling\nit you've been believing it for a very\nlong time doesn't make it any more true\nand so you have to start noticing in\nyourself what is it that made you feel\nbad okay where can I identify the\nthinking what was I just thinking was\nthere a negative thought pattern that\nmight have popped back up and then think\nabout it this this way imagine that you\ndid have this garden and I said hey this\nis your garden you're the only one that\ncontend to this Garden nobody else in\nthe world can tend to this Garden that's\nkind of what your mind is like so if you\nwalk up to that garden and you see that\nweeds are starting to grow in the garden\nyou can't expect someone to come and\ntake those weeds out for you because\nyou're the only one that can tend to\nthis Garden you're the only one that\nknows about this Garden so what do you\nhave to do you have to go and start\npulling weeds for yourself so when you\nnotice the weeds the negative thought p\npatter s in your mind starting to pop up\nwhat do you need to do you need to\nfigure out some sort of way to start\npulling them you need to pull them and\nyou need to put in place of them three\npositive seeds if you start talking\ntrash about yourself you notice yourself\nnot feeling good and you're like what\nokay I don't feel good why do I not feel\ngood oh I don't feel good because I'm\nnoticing I was you know just looking at\nmyself in the mirror and I must have\njust been judging myself and judging\nthat I got a little little bit of fat\nhanging over my my belt buckle oh okay I\nwas judging myself I was talking to\nmyself subconsciously okay what do I\nneed to do I need to look myself in the\nmirror I need to tell I need to pull\nthose weeds and what I need to do is I\nneed to plant three positive seeds I\nneed to look myself in the mirror and I\nneed to tell myself three things that I\nlove about\nmyself okay here's the three things I\ngot to say I love this I love this I\nlove this and start creating an\nenvironment where you actually tend to\nthink positive more than you think\nnegative and as you start to do is\nbecome better at it you might not be\nreally good at it right now that's okay\nbut you start becoming a little bit\nbetter and a little bit better and a\nlittle bit better like I said when I\nfirst started trying to get positive\nthinking I was so damn pessimistic I\ncould make excuses for everything I was\nalways so negative I was always Doom and\nGloom now for me you know now that's\nwhat is that 18 years later obviously\nit's a long time basically half my life\nI've been thinking I was thinking\nnegative half my life I've been thinking\npositive but now I can't it's hard for\nme to think negative because I've just\nprogrammed myself to be different so\nit's not always easy it doesn't happen\nimmediately it does take time it takes\nattention but it takes you pay paying\nattention to how you think and how you\nfeel as often as possible and start\nknowing that positive thinking does work\nfor you you just have to have it be\nsomething that is a lifestyle not just\nsomething that's like a diet that you're\ngoing to try out for a couple weeks so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in it Rob dial Jr r o b d
