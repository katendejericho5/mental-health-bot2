mindset Mentor podcast so\nmake sure you tune in every single day\nthat it goes live today we're going to\ntalk about scarcity and we're going to\ntalk about how to get rid of your\nscarcity mindset uh so many people in\nthis world hold thems self back because\nof what they think is possible in their\nlives not what is actually possible in\ntheir lives what they think is possible\nin their lives simply because of what\nthey think is possible and the way that\nthey speak about themselves and the way\nthat they think in their heads they\ncreate an identity of what they think\nthat they can do and that's one of the\nthings I look I love looking at like\nsome athletes or extremely successful\npeople or people who build massive\nbusinesses is the only real difference\nbetween them and someone else's the\nbelief that they have in what they can\ndo so many people just close themselves\noff they build this little teeny tiny\nbox and they live in that little teeny\ntiny box they said well this is all that\nI can do and it's not based in any fact\nit's just based in belief and we think\nthat our beliefs are facts because we\nbelieve them for so long and we've been\ntelling oursel aive for so long that we\nthink that it's absolutely true but in\nreality none of your beliefs are true\nthey're just something that you believe\nit's just a thought pattern that is been\nrepeated over and over and over again\nand so what happens is you bu build a\nbelief in yourself of what you think is\npossible and a lot of times that belief\nis really based on a lot of scarcity and\num I'm going to give you a a phrase that\nI hope that you remember\nforever scarcity means or abundance\nmeans and so life is not or life is and\nnowhere is it written into the book of\nthe UN Universe where it says you can\neither have this or you can have that\nyou can have this thing or you can have\nthat thing that's scarcity and that's\nnot written to the fabric of the\nuniverse it isn't but you believe that\nit is oh I can either be this or I could\nbe that abundance is and I will have\nthis and I will have that I will do this\nand I will do that so let me give you an\nexample of what I mean I work and you've\nprobably heard me give this example\nbefore but it's just it's so true with\nso many people that I find that are\nbusiness owners but also parents and so\nmany business owners are Holdings back\nsimply because of this this belief that\nthey have and so many of them stunt the\ngrowth of themsel stunt the growth of\ntheir business and stunt the growth of\ntheir family because they think I can\neither have a great business or I can be\na great\nparent that is a scarcity mindset or I\ncan either have a great business or I\ncan be a great parent that's a scarcity\nmindset is it written into the fabric of\nthe universe that that's true no are\nthere people out there who have\nincredible businesses and they're also\nincredibly dedicated parents absolutely\nso if somebody else can do it does it\nmean that it's absolute truth no it\nmeans it's a belief that you hold in\nyour head that you act like is true and\nso the real question is where did that\nmindset come from who says that you have\nto choose why can't you be a great\nbusiness owner and a great parent now I\nknow there's already some of you guys\nthat are getting triggered by this and\nI'm triggering you because there's\ncognitive dissonance where you're saying\nwhoa whoa whoaa whoa but I I know so\nmany people who have been great business\nowners but they've been shitty parents\nokay that doesn't mean that that's the\nway it has to be oh well hold on though\nyou don't understand my father owned a\nbusiness and he was never around okay\nthat was what your father did it doesn't\nmean that's what you have to do you know\nsome people think that they have to work\na 100 hours a week to succeed I thought\nthat for years and and that's why I\nworked 100 hours a week for 3 to 4 years\nnow I work less than I did then but make\nmore money than I did and so there was a\nscarcity mindset of thinking I have to\nwork a 100 hours a week that's the only\nway that I'll succeed but there's a big\ndifference the thing that I've seen\namong like I have I have a friend who is\nan incredible incredible father he's\nalso worth about $200 million at this\npoint so it's like okay well that guy's\nreally challenging the belief that I\nused to have of I could either be a\ngreat parent or a great business owner\nbut there's a really big difference he\nplans out his life to be exactly how he\nwants it to be he's one of the most\nsuccessful people that I know but he's\nalso an incredibly great parent and he\nplans his day out and executes on his\nday in a way that I've never seen\nsomebody execute before when he is\nworking he is working he's not\nchecking Instagram he's not scrolling on\nTik Tok he's not having side\nconversations like he is 100% locked in\nbut when he's with his kids and that's\nin his schedule he is 100% with his kids\nhe puts his phone away he never checks\nhis phone so he puts 100% of himself\ninto whatever it is that he is doing and\nhe has an incredible relationship with\nhis wife he has an incredible\nrelationship with his with his children\nthey travel all the time and he is an\nincredible business owner over 5,000\nemployees how does that happen if\nsomebody else can do it\nyou can do it now mind you every time I\nsee this guy and almost every and I say\nlike except for when we've gone on a\nvacation or something like that but\nevery time I've seen him on a normal day\na normal working day if we go get coffee\nin the middle of the day he always has\nhis journal which is his planner as well\nwith him he is so dedicated to making\nsure that he is on time he does what\nneeds to be done and when he does\nsomething he puts 100 100% of himself\ninto it so many people that I know that\nare business owners are like I'm like\nwell where's your schedule they're like\nwell I don't really have a schedule I\nkind of just look at my iPhone sometimes\nI'm like well can you expand yourself a\nlittle bit more to become better at what\nit is that you do and become better with\nyour time management he is a master of\ntime management and when he when he says\nokay the clock takes over from this\nthing to this thing I'm 100% in I'm\nswitching tasks I'm switching from being\na great business owner to being a great\nparent if somebody else can do it you\ncan do it and he would be the very first\nperson to tell you he is not the\nsmartest guy in the world he actually\nquite often says he's not smart at all\nso if he could do it you could do it and\nhe would tell you if he could do it you\ncould do it as well and so that's the\nthing to think about like when you are\nworking are you 100% in or you you know\nhalf in half out when you're with your\nchildren are you half in or you half out\nyou know and and some of the most\nsuccessful people that I know also\nbecause of the fact that they can get\n100% of the their brain power locked in\nthey weren't born this way they just got\nthemsel to be this way they could get\nmore done in two hours than the average\nperson gets done in 10 they're focused\non what they're doing they're getting it\ndone they're doing nothing else they're\nnot thinking about anything else and\nthey're making sure that they check off\nthe boxes they need to but when they're\nwith the kids they are 100% there and so\npeople think to themselves the scarcity\nmindset I can either have a great\nrelationship with my wife or I could be\na millionaire and I could run a\nsuccessful business or whatever it is\nthat you want to do no it's an where did\nthat mindset come from that you could\neither have a great relationship or be a\nsuccessful business owner\nwhere did it come from you have to start\nasking yourself these questions you have\nto start challenging your beliefs\nbecause we think once again I'm going to\nsay it over and over again we think our\nbeliefs are true our beliefs are not\ntrue they are just a pattern of thoughts\nthat we have held for so long that we\nthink that they are true maybe the\nreason why you got that was because you\nsaw your dad working really hard and he\nwas working from 5:00 a.m. in the\nmorning in his business to 5:00 p.m. and\nhe came home and he was tired and then\nhe drank a beer and ate food and then\nwent straight to bed immediately and he\nsaw you saw your parents not have a\ngreat relationship because of that maybe\nyou saw your parents relationship fail\ndoesn't mean that that's what you have\nto do it just means okay I saw what it\ncould look like I don't want that car\ncrash I'm going to plan out my life to\nbe different you know I had a a client\nyears ago and he had his dad used to\nwork at um not work but he owned a bagel\nshop and so he would be basically\ngetting up and heading to his bagel shop\nat like 3:00 in the morning and he would\nwork until like 8:00 p.m. he'd come home\nand he would he would basically eat have\na couple beers go to bed wake up and do\nit all over again and he never saw his\ndad it was like he he rarely ever saw\nhis dad and so he had this idea in his\nmind like if I'm going to be successful\nin a relationship with my wife and with\nmy kids I can't be a great business\nowner like I can't even run a business\nso he had this fear of starting a\nbusiness and I was like no that's a\nscarcity mindset you're just thinking\nthat that your situation that happened\nwith your dad is automatically going to\nbe the situation with you and that's not\nthe truth and you need to understand\nthat and so whenever you're doing\nsomething and you're starting to notice\nscarcity come up the feeling of or ask\nyourself questions is it possible that\nwhat I'm thinking might be false you\nknow is it possible that when I'm at\nwork I can be at work and when I'm with\nmy girlfriend I'm with my girlfriend or\nwhen I'm with my husband I'm with my\nhusband whatever it is that you might\nhave right you're you're doing exactly\nwhat you need to be doing in the time\nthat you're doing it oh I you know I\ncould either take a vacation with my\nfamily or I could fix the\ncar no take a vacation and fix the car\nnow some of you are going oh my God but\nI don't have enough money figure it out\neverything in this world is\nfigureoutable figure it out make\nyourself if you don't currently have the\nmoney figure out how to get the money\nfigure out how to expand yourself\nbecause a lot of times what's happening\nis is when people start to get really\ntriggered by these types of things it's\nbecause they're keeping thems in a box\nI'm saying Evolve yourself expand\nyourself to think differently you might\nnot be able to do it right now but you\ncan figure out a way to do it in the\nfuture what would you need to change in\nyour life what would you need to change\nin yourself to be able to have both of\nthose in the future to be able to do\nthat in the future and not have to\nchoose whether it's fixing the car or\nyour son being able to play soccer or\nbeing able to take a family vacation the\nuniverse is ridiculously abundant like\nincredibly\nabundant look at nature nature is not\nscarce in any sort of way nature is the\nmost abundant thing that exists and we\nare part of nature scarcity only exists\nin the human mind if you think about the\nstars and the galaxies and everything\nthat's out there your\nbrain cannot even comprehend the\nabundance that's out inside of the\nuniverse there's one septian stars in\nthe universe that is a one with 24 zeros\nafter it there's two trillion\ngalaxies the universe is incredibly\nabundant your mindset is what is scarce\nwhen you look at an apple tree apples\ngrow apple trees grow apples to\nreproduce the seeds are inside of the\napples does an apple tree make one apple\nper season no they make up to\n800 apples to try to create one other\napple tree abundance is\nnatural it's a natural state of the\nuniverse scarce\nonly exists in the human mind which\nmeans that abundance is truth and\nscarcity is a\nlie but we believe our Lies We Are\nconditioned to believe our lies we're\nconditioned to think that it's this or\nthat we're to you know we hear from our\nparents scarcity and different thought\npatterns and we think that that's what\nit is we see our parents and we think\nthat's different thought patterns we see\nour uncles and how our uncles were\nworking a 100 hours a week and they\nruined their relationship with their\nchildren with their wife we think oh\nthat must be truth that must be what\nit's going to be so I should never start\na business because I want to have a\ngreat relationship with my children my\nwife no that's just something that you\nsaw and you decided you know what that\nis absolute truth it's not absolute\ntruth the only thing that is absolute\ntruth in this universe is abundance so\nif your mindset is thinking scarce then\nyou are thinking a lie because the\nuniverse is incredibly\nabundant but we believe the lie we're\nconditioned to believe the lie we're\nconditioned to believe it's either this\nor that it's either money or it's\nhappiness it's either a successful\nbusiness or being a great parent you\nknow and I I find myself all the time\nslipping back into Old scarcity mindsets\ncuz I was raised poor so I get it I know\nwhat it's like to be there I remember\nwhen I was buying my house three years\nago if you don't follow if if you follow\nme on Instagram you've probably seen me\nat my house I usually walk around and\ntalk and stuff I remember calling my\nbest friend and I was like Hey I've\nnever spent this much money on anything\nand it's kind of scaring the out of\nme and I said I'm not I literally said\nthis to him I'm noticing myself in a\nscarcity mindset can you help get me out\nof the scarcity mindset so we had an\nabundance conversation because I noticed\nmyself going into scarcity and he said\nthink about I mean think about waking up\nin that place he goes think about how\ninspired you would be to wake up there\nand I was like oh yeah I'd be really\nfreaking inspired he's like if you're\nreally inspired how much better would\nthe quality of everything you create be\nI was like oh it would be so much better\nif I woke up and I felt inspired and I\nfelt better and I didn't feel like I was\nin a crammed little teeny tiny condo\nthere I couldn't breathe and I had space\nand it was expansive we started talking\nabout all of that and he goes so you so\nwe basically came to the conclusion of\nokay will it get me a little bit out of\nmy comfort zone because I've never spent\nthis much money on something yes would I\nwake up more inspired yes and if I wake\nup more inspired would I create better\nstuff for the world yes and through that\nwould I then create more abundance in my\nlife yes so abundance creates more\nabundance SC scarcity creates more\nscarcity so I still find myself slipping\ninto it and when I find myself slipping\nI stop myself you know there's a there's\na different energy when you step into\nabundance there's a different thought\npattern there's a different belief\npattern that you have to step into it is\na different reprogramming reconditioning\nof yourself it's just different because\nscarcity is programmed into us not on\npurpose but if you have a scarcity\nmindset you probably got it from your\nparents you probably got it from your\nyour friends parents you probably got it\nfrom your aunts and uncles you got it\nfrom things that you heard from other\npeople but things that you saw from\nother people you can either do this or\nthat but you can't do both money doesn't\ngrow on trees you know there's we've\nheard many of those things growing up\nbut it takes awareness to notice when\nyou slip into scarcity to pull yourself\nback out of scarcity do you trust that\nthe universe or God or Source or\neverything has your back do you do you\ntrust that it wants the best for you\nthat it's here to support you if you do\nthen you have to understand that\nabundance is the natural state of the\nuniverse you have been programmed to\nthink something different that's not\nyour fault but it is now your\nresponsibility to fix it unless you just\nwant to stay scarce that's up to you\nthat's completely up to you and you\ncould do it if you want to but abundance\nis natural and it is natural for us to\nbe abundant so we must become aware of\nthat abundance try to feel it more often\ntry to see it more often and we notice\noursel becoming more scares what we need\nto do is take a step back and say hm is\nit true like truth written into the\nfabric of the universe that it is either\nthis or that hm actually it's not okay\nso that means that it is not true is it\ntrue that I could figure out a way to\nexpand myself and grow myself so that\nboth of these two realities that I want\ncan live in my reality yes maybe you're\nnot there yet maybe you're not there yet\nwhere you can have a very successful\nbusiness and a very successful\nrelationship but can you expand yourself\nand grow yourself to get there AB\nabsolutely 100% so then what you should\nbe focusing on is becoming the person\nwhere both of those realities can be\npossible and that's the best part about\nself-development so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on your\nInstagram stories tag me in it Rob dial\nJr r o d a l Jr send me a message
