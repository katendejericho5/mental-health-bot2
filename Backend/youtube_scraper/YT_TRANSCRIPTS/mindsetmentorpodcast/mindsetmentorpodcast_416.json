    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nyour memories and we're going to be\ntalking about the problem with your\nmemories and the stories that we end up\ntelling but also that people end up\ntelling to us there's a lot of\nscientific and psychological proof\nshowing that maybe even up to half of\nour memories are not actually accurate\nand when we look in we retell a story or\nwe talk about something that happened to\nus in the past people tend to do uh when\nwe remember something we tend to do one\nof three things we either generalize\nthat memory we delete information from\nthat memory or we distort information\nfrom that memory and we're going to dive\ninto each one of those today uh before\nwe do though I want to I want to make\nyou understand that when someone is\ntelling you a memory and they generalize\ndelete or distort information it's not\nmalicious it's not their fault it's not\nlike they're trying to tell you a false\nmemory majority of people and probably\nyou before hearing this are not even\naware that we actually do this and so\nwe're going to dive into memory and how\nmemory actually works inside of your\nbrain and um realize that some of the\nstuff that we actually think is true and\nactually happened to us in our past\nmight not have happened in the way that\nwe actually think that it did um and\nit's important to remember when you\nthink of your memory your memory we like\nto think kind of like a video recorder\nlike you take a you know remember when\nyou were a little kid and you had like\nthe high8 tapes and you would put it\ninside of the VCR and you would play the\nthe high8 tape and you would watch back\nmemories from your children things that\nyour childhood and things that actually\nhappened your memory works a lot\ndifferent from a video recorder though\nit's not perfect playback like a video\nwould be a video would be perfect\nplayback of exactly what happened in\nreality memories though are\nreconstructed rather than replayed which\nis important to understand they are\nreconstructed and built piece by piece\nrather than perfect playback which if\nyou think about it introduces chances of\na lot of inaccuracies in a memory and\neach time that we call an event our\nbrain reconstructs that memory and that\ncan be influenced by a lot of different\nthings it get influenced by our current\nfeelings our biases uh new information\nthat has come into our brain since that\nmemory happened uh which ultimately\nalter the original memory so if the\nmemory is not perfect playback that\nmeans that the memory actually changes\nover time based off of everything that's\nhappened to you since that memory so\nit's not perfect and a lot of times\nwhat's crazy about is because we're\nreconstructing the memory every single\ntime we recall it a lot of times the\nmemory becomes less true the more that\nwe recall it over time because you're\nrecalling the last time that you thought\nabout the memory or the last time you\nspoke about the memory you're not\nrecalling the actual event and it's\nreally important to understand this\nabout yourself but also to understand\nabout other people as well now before we\ndive into the three things things that\npeople do with the the generalizing\ndeleting and the distorting there's one\nvery important thing to talk about\neveryone is viewing the world\ndifferently I always say we're all\nviewing the same thing but we're all\nseeing something different and so it's\nlike we're all wearing different colored\nglasses and perceiving the world through\ndifferent lenses and so all of the\nthings that we've been through all of\nthe things that I've been through are\ngoing to make me see reality a little\nbit different than the way that you're\ngoing to see it and all of the things\nthat you've been through in your life\nare going to make you see reality a\nlittle bit different than the way I\nactually see it and everyone else around\nyou sees it so we're all seeing the same\nthing it's all we're all seeing the same\nworld but we're all seeing it\ndifferently and so a lot of things that\npop up like one of the things that can\nreally distort and and change your\nmemories are stereotypes our memories\nare significantly shaped by our existing\nmental structures of the world the way\nthat we were raised what we were were\ntaught was good and bad the way that our\nparents interacted with us the way that\nour parents interacted with the world\nand those existing mental structures are\nwhat help us organize information and\nsometimes stereotypes can come in there\nas well and sometimes with stereotypes\nwhen we remember an event what happens\nis we often actually fill in the gaps in\nour memory with what we believe likely\nhappened based on different schemas that\nwe have different stereotypes we have\nrather than what actually happened and\nso if you think back to a memory a lot\nof times you're remembering pieces of it\nbut then you're filling the gaps in\nbased off of where you currently are\nmentally right now in your life and\nthat's really important to realize that\nstereotypes and all of our conditioning\ngets in the way but also really strong\nemotions can impair your memory as well\na really traumatic event when you have\nsomething that's very traumatic happened\nto you and very emot tionally charged\nevents you might remember them more\nvividly but just because you remember\nthem more vividly doesn't actually mean\nthat you remember it more accurately and\nemotionally charged memories can\nsometimes be a blend of fact and our\nemotional interpretation of those events\nand so you've heard me say it on the\npodcast many times before is that when\nyour emotion is high your logic is low\nso when you actually have really really\nhigh emotions a lot of logic in your\nbrain actually turns off and so like if\nyou're really terrified of something and\nyou're really like terrified and maybe\nyou had a situation where you were\nreally afraid of your um your safety\nlike your physical safety you can\nremember that very vividly but because\nit's so vivid and your emotions are so\nhigh in that moment you're actually not\nprocessing the world 100% correctly\nbecause when your emotion is high your\nlogic is low parts of your brain\nactually your brain actually sends less\nblood flow to the The Logical thinking\npart of your brain and so like I'll give\nyou an example let's say me and you are\nwalking down the street and we're just\ngoing for a walk and we walk by a dog\nthat is on the other side of the fence\nand the dog doesn't do anything crazy it\njust barks at us and the dog barks and\nthat's it it doesn't try to jump over it\njust barks at us if we're walking by\nthat dog and I love dogs and I don't\nhave any you know crazy memories of the\npast of dogs attacking me I might not\neven recall the dog 20 minutes later 30\nminutes later that we even walked by a\ndog but if you were attacked by a dog as\na child you might not just remember the\ndog but you also might be in such a\nheightened state that the dog brought\nall of your attention and all of your\nfocus to make sure that you were going\nto be safe and you were trying to avoid\nall of that you might have gotten to a\nreally heightened state but let's say at\nthe exact same time we're walking by the\ndog there's also some palm trees that\nare across the street and the dog barks\nand you notice the dog and all of your\nattention goes to the dog but I'm\nlooking across the street and I see a\nbunch of palm trees and I'm like you\nknow what I've been thinking about\ngetting palm trees installed in my house\nand I'm starting to think about the palm\ntrees and where would the palm trees go\noh we put palm trees here we put them in\nthis place and here's what's crazy about\nit we're both walking down the same\nstreet I might not recall the dog in any\nsort of way you might not see the palm\ntrees in any sort of way but I would\nrecall the palm trees you would recall\nthe dog and so you have to think about\nthat the thing about it is we're both\nseeing the exact same world but we're\nboth remembering two completely\ndifferent things based off of our past\nbased off of what's going on in life\nbased off of our emotional charge and so\nwhat happens is we tend to generalize we\ndelete or we distort and so I became\naware of this when I was younger and I\nfirst started in sales and I was\ntraining sales reps when I was younger I\nhad trained over 2,000 sales reps in a\ncompany I was at by the time I was 24\nand we used to do these things called\nphone jams where everyone would come\ninto the office and we make cold calls\nto try to set up appointments and it was\nthe funniest thing because we would have\nsome of my sales drops come in and i' an\nhour after being there I'd be like hey\nhow's everything going and they're like\noh everything's okay and I'd say okay\nwell how many appointments you set up oh\nI've set up no appointments oh really\nwhy not oh well I mean no one's home and\nI would say no one's home no nobody's\nhome and I'd say okay how many phone\ncalls have you made oh my gosh I've made\nso many phone calls and then I'd be like\nokay let me look at your phone real\nquick and I take their phone and in the\npast hour they made like three phone\ncalls and none of those three people\nanswered but what they said is no one is\nhome and so I would say okay we're in\nBroward County there's like 1.2 million\npeople in Broward county is it true that\nno one is home no it's not true it's\ntrue that the three people that they\ncalled are not home but what they're\ndoing is they are\ngeneralizing everything based off of a\ncouple circumstances that showed them\nthat three people weren't home\nand so like another example of this of\nhow we could generalize is when we're\nrecalling time at school let's say that\nyou had a stressful time when you were\nin high school maybe you were bullied\nmaybe you were an outcast maybe you were\nmade fun of whatever it might be and I\nwere say hey what was what was high\nschool like for you oh my god high\nschool was so hard it was so stressful I\nwas so stressed out every day right like\nI was so stressed out every day so it\nwas so stressful and even if that's not\nthe case every single day we generalize\nall of it oh my God it was so hard and\nyou know we might forget about the fun\nthat we had in school the time that we\nhad success in school the boredom that\nwe had in school uh maybe the excitement\nto see our friends and what happens is\nwe generalize the entire memory based\noff of just one feeling which was\nstressful and the reason why our brains\ndo this is because our brains tend to\nsummarize long periods or complex\nexperiences into more digestible\nnarratives and this simpli\nsimplification great but it can make it\neasier to retrieve information but what\nhappens is when we communicate it later\non down the road we generalize the\nentire thing uh another reason why is\nbecause we generalize because there's\nthe sheer amount of volume of\ninformation that's coming into your\nbrain at any point in time remembering\nevery single detail of every single\nevent is not going to happen and it's\nit's what they call cognitively\noverwhelming where your brain just can't\ntake in all the information and so to be\nmore efficient what it does is it just\nrecognizes patterns so that therefore\nthey say oh yeah well you know it was\njust really stressful you know could you\nhave had a few stressful days quite a\nfew stressful days yeah were all of them\nstressful no so we generalize that uh\nlike one of the ways that we do this\nlike if you're not familiar I train a\nlot of coaches I've trained over 1400\ncoaches and I have a a program called\nbusiness breakthrough where I actually\nteach this and one of the funny things\nabout it is that when someone joins\nbusiness breakthrough we start teaching\nthem how to grow on Instagram and how to\ngrow their business one of the things\nthey say when they step into being being\na coach is oh my God everyone on\nInstagram is a coach and I'm like\nthere's over a billion people on\nInstagram is it true that everyone is a\ncoach well no it's not true that\neveryone's a coach but what's true is\nthat now your articular activating\nsystem because you are a coach is\nnoticing more coaches the same way that\nif you buy a truck and you never saw\nthat truck anywhere well now you're\ngoing to start to notice that truck yeah\nit's in your reticular activating system\nbut it's not that everyone drives that\ntruck or that everyone is a coach and so\nwe just tend to generalize information\nuh because the amount of sheer volume it\njust becomes easier to throw information\ninto a box and say all of the things are\nthis way or all of my high school days\nwere like this so that's generalization\nwhich is very very common with people we\ndo it all of the time I do it all the\ntime and I notice other people doing it\nall the time so start noticing yourself\nwhen you're generalizing information but\nalso notice in other people and they're\ngeneralizing information as well the\nsecond thing we do is we delete\ninformation\nso we basically remove pieces of the\nstory or reality to fit our own\nnarrative so let's say someone let's say\nyou had a tough relationship with your\nmom right and I would to say hey tell me\nabout your relationship with your mom oh\nmy gosh she was so tough she was so\nstressful um you know she was she was\njust really hard on me and you can\nretrieve so many instances where your\nmother was difficult but a lot of times\nit becomes hard for you to pull up the\nmemories that are great you know so I'm\nsure there were there were some times\nwhere she was loving or she was helpful\nbut we delete that information to fit\nthe narrative that we have in our mind\nto prove our Point based off of the\nstory that we're telling and a lot of\ntimes we don't even recognize that we're\ndoing it but we delete information uh\nalso because not everything is\nnoteworthy to remember so it might not\nfit your narrative but also we delete\ninformation because we I mean do you\nremember what you wore three days ago\nlike I don't know what I wore 3 days ago\nand it does this your brain does this to\nconserve cognitive resources there's\nactually a thing that that's called\nneural pruning that your brain does it's\na process where unused neural\nconnections are eliminated to enhance\nthe efficiency of your nerve\nTransmission in your brain and so if\ncertain memories or information are not\nfrequently used or recall the brain\nmight actually prune these connections\nleading to you forgetting something that\nactually happened or fully deleting it\nfrom your memory which is where the\ndeletion comes from and then the other\nside of it and the last one is we\ndistort information so say maybe you\nremember from your birthday party where\nthere was a clown at your birthday party\nand clown it just scared the hell out of\nyou and you just remember this time when\nyour parents hired a clown and it was\nthe worst birthday you ever had because\nyou were so terrified of it and you were\ncrying in the corner and you know it\nlike let's say it's a sixth birthday\nparty and you're 35 years old and you're\ntalking to your parents you're like hey\nremember that time you guys hired the\nclown and end up being like this\nterrible birthday party and your parents\nare like what are you talking about we\nnever hired a clown\nand you're like no there was that\nbirthday it was my like sixth birthday\nparty where you hired a clown and it was\nterrifying and I remember wanting to\nleave and not be around the clown and\nthey're like no no no that wasn't your\nbirthday party that was Johnny's\nbirthday party your friend and what\nhappens is you distort information and\nyou take a birthday that you went to of\nyour friend where it was a terrible\nclown that scared you and you're crying\nin the corner and then you take that and\nyou actually think it was your own\nbirthday but your whole life up until\nthat moment 29 years you thought it was\nyour birthday so you deleted the memory\nand Consolidated them and you didn't\neven realize that it was completely\nfalse it also shows up when you\naccidentally alter the sequence of\nevents there been many psychological\nstudies that based off of the questions\nthat somebody has asked can actually\nalter their memory of it and they can\nremember things out of order there was\none study that was done about a car\ncrash where they showed a car crash to\npeople and then they would say hey how\ndid the car crash happen and they would\ntalk about the car crash and based off\nof their questions it would actually\nchange a person's memory like how fast\nthe car was going would change you know\nwhen they recalled the the and were\ntrying to tell the story based off the\nquestions they asked the person who\nwatched the car crash on video how fast\nthe car was going was changed based off\nthe questions they also asked questions\nabout like the car crashing the glass\nall over the place and people were like\nyes there was glass everywhere and then\nthey rewatched the video later there was\nno glass and so we change our memories\nwe distort them based off of the way\nwe're trying to to the way we perceive\nthe world but also at the same time the\nthings that are going on our heads in\nthe moment and so it's really important\nto remember this I'm not telling you\nthis to just try to scare the hell out\nof you but your memories are your past\nand a lot of times they're not as true\nas you think they are and we're just\ntrying to fit them into a narrative or\ndifferent aspects of them have been\npruned and we forget about it so if up\nto 50% of what you remember could be\nfalse then the real question is what is\ntrue and what is false and it's really\nimportant because so many people a lot\nof people listening think that you are\nwho you are because of your\npast but if your past is just a bunch of\nmemories and many of your memories are\nnot correct is it true that you actually\nare who you are based off of what\nhappened to you in your past or based\noff of what you think happened to you in\nyour past and this is why it's really\nimportant to talk about this because I\nalways say like your past doesn't matter\nit really doesn't because about 50% of\nwhat you recalling from your past didn't\neven actually happen so so if you're\nsaying I am the way that I am because of\nmy mom I am the way that I am because of\nmy dad because I was bullied in school\nand all this stuff no not necessarily so\nyou've got to start thinking about that\nso the past doesn't even really matter\nas much what matters is\nnow what matters is what we do now what\nactions we take the problem is if we\nlive a life based off of a past identity\nthat we have of ourselves and an\nidentity that we've built off of our\npast how much of that identity is\nactually true if 50% of your memories\naren't true in the first place and so\nit's really important that the past\ndoesn't really necessarily matter\nbecause the past isn't something that's\nactually true based off of what's going\non in your brain and you're not playing\nit like you're playing a tape in the VCR\nyou're playing it based off of a\nreconstruction of your memory which\ncould either be generalized deleted or\ndistorted so what matters what you do\nnow not what's happened in the past so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in it Rob dial Jr r o\nd i a l Jr also if you love this podcast\nyou would probably love my new book that\njust came out last month it is on the\npsychology of taking action and how to\nunderstand the brain that you have and\nhow to have the manual to take the\naction and create the life that you want\nto and um if you want to get it it's\ncalled level up how to get focused stop\nprocrastinating and upgrade your life so\nwherever you buy your books whether it's\nonline or in person if you just look up\nlevel up and Rob dial which is me you\nshould be a to buy it there and with\nthat I'm going to leave the same way I\nleave you every single episode makeing\nyour mission makes somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
