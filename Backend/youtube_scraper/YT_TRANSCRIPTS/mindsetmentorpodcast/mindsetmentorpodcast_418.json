    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nthe power of affirmations and the power\nof all of the words that you use and I\nget it I've been there before I've heard\naffirmations and been like that's weird\nthat's woo woo there's no fact or\nscience behind it it's just lying to\nyourself in order to start thinking a\ncertain way um I'm going to show you why\nthat's actually not true and there's\nactually science behind affirmations and\nhow the words that you use not just to\nother people but the words that you use\ninside of your own head actually start\nto shift your perception of everyone\nelse and everything else around you but\nalso start to shift your perceptions of\nyourself as well and we're going to talk\nabout the powers of the words that you\nuse and and you've probably heard in\npast episodes I've talked about how to\nmanifest so you can create the life that\nyou want and you can go back and listen\nto that but part of manifesting the life\nthat you want deals with the words that\nyou use and not just once again the\nwords that you use verbally but the\nwords that you use inside of your head\nthere's many psychological studies that\nshow uh how affirmations actually help\npeople and one of them was done in 1988\nin uh the Journal of social cognition by\nClaude steel and um the paper was on the\nconcept of\nself-affirmation in the context of\nsocial psychological theory and it\nshowed that affirmations helped build\nand maintain\nself-integrity and self-belief by\nreminding yourself constantly of the\nimportant personal values and how you\nwant to show up in the world which\nimpacts your overall well-being and your\nself-esteem as well so just by the words\nthat you use to yourself it affects your\noverall well-being and your self-esteem\nand helps you build your own personal\nintegrity and to maintain that personal\nIntegrity so it's basically like\nspeaking into existence what you want in\nthe world but also speaking into\nexistence who you want to be it's almost\nlike you're you're speaking to yourself\nand reminding yourself over and over and\nover again of who you want to be and how\nyou want to act\nbecause all too often we sit there and\nwe talk bad to ourselves and we say oh\nI'm stupid I'm not smart enough and\nthose are the affirmations that we're\nusing those are not positive\naffirmations those would be negative\naffirmations but if we say I'm stupid\nI'm not smart enough I'm not pretty\nenough whatever it is then we're not\ngoing to take the actions that we need\nto create the life that we want so on\nthe flip side of that if we start using\npositive affirmation wouldn't it make\nsense that we would start taking more\naction to create the life that you want\nand there's there's so much power in the\nwords that you use but not just power I\ndon't want you to just think about the\nthe words that you use I also want you\nto think about the energy behind it um\nI'm going to give you the most powerful\nphrase in any language in just a little\nbit but think about the phrase for a\nsecond like just think about this and\nand I've I've heard myself many times\nsay something like I have\nto oh I have to go to the gym today oh I\nhave to go record podcast episodes I\nhave to get this Zoom call done with the\nteam\nthink about the energy behind I have to\nI have to go do something makes me a\nvictim of my own life think about the\nenergy behind that I I've I hear it all\nthe time I still catch myself saying it\nsometimes but when you say I have to do\nsomething how does that feel how does it\nfeel in your body and in your mind to\nhave to do something what's a what's a\nvisual or a memory that you have that\ncomes up for you when you have to do\nsomething for me it's like being a\nlittle kid and having to do something as\na child and me dragging myself miserably\nthrough the house to have to go do it or\nto to have to mow the lawn and I\nremember fighting with my mom about\nhaving to mow our big old lawn or having\nto clean my room because I never cleaned\nmy room and my mom getting mad at me for\nnot cleaning my room so when I start to\nthink about having to do\nsomething that's what's associated in my\nmind with it having to do those things\nso when I say have to go record podcast\nepisodes I'm associating that same\nfeeling that same energy with having to\ncome and do something that I actually\nlove to do having to do something to\nhave to do something doesn't bring a\nmotivated energy to my body does it for\nyou do you feel like when you have to do\nsomething oh I have to go to the gym you\njust kind of drag your ass to the gym\nand try to get it done because having to\ndo something doesn't bring motivation to\nme doesn't make me feel the energy of\nmotivated and inspired I guess you could\nsay so what do you think that does to me\nsubconsciously when I have to do\nsomething it slows me down it lowers my\nmotivation makes me not look forward to\nthose things when was the last time you\nsaid you have to do something Have you\never said I have to go work out no you\nget to work out you get to work out\nbecause you many people wish they had\narms and legs like you do that work or a\nBeating Heart or the ability to move\ntheir muscles in the ways that you can\nor how about this instead of saying I\nhave to or even saying I get to you\ncould say I choose to I choose to work\nout I have to work out makes you a\nvictim I choose to work out that's\npersonal power that is choice that is\nsovereignty behind the words that you\nuse think about that for a second it's\nthese little incremental shifts in the\nwords that we use this is linguistic\nprogramming right here of how to\nactually change the way you've\nprogrammed yourself through the words\nthat you use to show up differently to\nbe different based off of all these\ndifferent words that you use or I don't\nhave enough time I'm too busy okay how\ndoes that make you feel to use words\nlike that I'm trying to\nno it's like they say in Star Wars do or\ndo not there is no try I'm trying to do\nthese things I don't have enough time\ntime I'm too busy think about the energy\nbehind the words that you\nuse it's really important and so you've\ngot to start think about how to bring\nmore energy to the words that you use\nand I told you at the very beginning I\nwas going to tell you what I believe is\nthe most powerful phrase that a human\ncould use and the most powerful phrase\nthat a human can use and the phrase is I\nam it is the most powerful statement in\nany language whatever it is translated\nto because it either opens the door to\nall possibilities\nor it slams it\nshut and quite literally creates your\nidentity as well I am think about the\nwords I am and if you don't say anything\nempowering after I am you need to change\nit there are no words that are more\npowerful than I am because when you\nspeak it you start to speak it into\nexistence and when you look at the the\nword Abracadabra comes from Hebrew and\nit means as I speak I create as you\nspeak the words I am whatever follow\nthat is what you're going to create in\nyour life do you say stuff like I am\nstupid I'm not pretty enough I'm not\nvery smart I'm lazy do you say those\nwords I'm even hesitant saying them out\nloud to myself right now because I don't\nwant that to sneak into my\nsubconscious or do you say things that\nare powerful and have energy behind them\nI am powerful I am beautiful I am sexy I\nam smart I'm amazing I am loving I have\nloved I am healed whatever it is I'm\nworking really hard to create the life\nthat I want and to give my children the\nabundance they deserve in their lives\nI'm working really hard to be able to\nbuy a house in a great part of town to\nprovide better education for my children\nwhatever it might be I am don't ever say\nI am and have the words that follow I am\nbe something that is anything less than\nreally\nempowering otherwise you're just kicking\nyourself in the crotch before you even\ntry to start doing something what's the\nenergy behind the words when you say I\nam powerful beautiful smart amazing\nhealed loved smart sexy all of that\nwhat's the energy behind those much\nbetter that I am stupid I'm not good\nenough I'll Never Be Loved wouldn't you\nagree what's the energy behind the words\nalways think about the energy behind the\nwords that you use oh I'm dumb I'm fat\nI'm\nunlovable I'm ugly I'm stupid what's the\nenergy behind those words how does that\nfeel in your\nbody because as you speak you will\ncreate asking you shall receive there's\nso many different ancient texts that\nspeak this in some sort of way and\nhere's the thing now mind you I don't\nthink that you should sit there and say\nI am rich if you have negative $14 in\nyour bank account I tried that for years\nwhen I was broke it didn't work do you\nwant to know why because you have a BS\nmeter and the BS meter is going to go\noff and you're going to say I'm rich I'm\nrich I'm rich and then there's going to\nbe the BS meter it's GNA be like ding\nding ding uh actually you're broke as\nhell and it's not going to come into\nyour subconscious so don't say like I am\nrich I am healthy I am wealthy if you're\nnot what you need to do is you need to\nhave a actual system to create\naffirmations and so this is a system\nthat I have created it's three parts to\ncreating a powerful affirmation and it's\nvery simple it's very easy to do so if\nyou have your pen and paper you can grab\nit we can actually start to create\naffirmations so when I first learned\nabout affirmations I was uh probably 20\nyears old 21 years old and I started\nusing them and I started saying stuff\nlike you know I learned the very woo\nwooy way of doing it I I am attracting\nmoney from all areas of the universe and\nthen I would open my eyes and be like\nthat's you're broke dude and\nyou're not making any money you have\nnegative dollars in your bank account\nBank of America literally just took\nmoney from you because you have NE you\ndon't even have enough money in your\nbank account right so so you actually\nstart to have your BS meter go off the\nway that I have developed it over time\nand through working with clients and you\nknow thousands of people through my\nprograms and stuff is three parts to it\nokay very simple it's got to be true\nit's got to be present tense and it's\ngot to be\nempowering okay so true present tense\nand\nempowering so if I were to not have any\nmoney in my bank account and I sit there\nand I say I am wealthy I am rich is that\ntrue no it's a lie not going to work not\ngoing to work you can't lie to yourself\nand expect that you're going to get what\nyou want is it present tense it is is it\nempowering sure but it's not true your\nBS meter is going to go off so instead\nof saying something like I am rich which\nis going to set off your BS meter it\ncould be I am working hard to create\nmore wealth in my\nlife okay that makes me feel better\ndoesn't it doesn't that feel better in\nthe body versus saying I am rich I am\nattracting money through all areas of\nthe\nuniverse that doesn't feel good in the\nbody but if I say I'm going to work\nreally hard today to create more wealth\nfor myself and my family does that feel\nbetter inside your body yes think about\nthe energy behind it can you accept that\ninto your body can you accept it into\nyour subconscious probably because it's\ntrue it's present tense and it's\nempowering now if you're 100 lb\noverweight I don't recommend you sit\nthere and say I am fit I look amazing in\na bikini why because your BS Meer is\ngoing to be like no you're not fit right\nnow and it can actually be demotivating\nwhen you're starting to lie to yourself\nnobody wants to juste lie to thems and\ntake action from that but instead of\nsaying I am in the best shape of my life\nand you're not and that's just lying to\nyourself it'd be better say something\nlike I'm working hard to create a strong\nand healthy body I'm going to work\nreally hard today to be more healthy to\nbe stronger and to eventually look\namazing in a bikini next year doesn't\nthat feel better it doesn't feel like a\nlie and that's one of the things I think\npeople really get caught up in with\naffirmations and why it doesn't work for\na lot of people but then also a lot of\npeople just resist is because they\nbasically are like so you're telling\nyou're telling me that I need to lie to\nmyself until I finally believe it and\nthat's why people get hung up on it but\nif you were to sit there and you were to\nsay instead of saying I am rich I'm\nattracting money from all areas of the\nuniverse you say I'm going to work I am\ncommitted to working really hard today\nto bring in more wealth into my bank\naccount well that feels better doesn't\nit it feels true I can commit to that I\ncan believe in that I can believe in\ntoday\nversus I am fit I am in the best shape\nof my life I am you know people are like\nif you're 250 pounds and they're like I\nam 180 pounds and 3% body fat or\nwhatever it is and you're you're\nliterally lying to yourself no instead\nof saying that it's I am committed to\ngoing to the gym today to working on\nmyself to take a step in the right\ndirection for my health for my strength\nand for my\nbody doesn't that all just feel a whole\nlot better it does and so when you start\nto think about affirmations you have to\nrealize there is a whole lot of science\nbehind this that proves that speaking to\nyourself and speaking in your head but\nalso out loud about what it is that you\nare what it is that you want to create\nand what it is that you believe that\nyou're going to do is proven to actually\nmake you a better person to help you\ntake a step in the right direction CU\nall too often we have a story that's\ngoing on in our heads\nand that story that's going on in our\nheads is usually negative it's usually\nnot motivating it's usually not helping\nyou take a step in the right direction\nand it's slowing you down and you start\nself-sabotaging because you're actually\nbelieving the things that are going on\nin your head and I want you to ask\nyourself this question if you really\nreally want to start to to dive into\nwhat's going on in your head think about\nthis for a\nsecond is what you're saying in your\nhead absolute truth I mean like is it\nwritten into the fabric of the universe\nthat you are dumb\nis it written to the fabric of the\nuniverse that you are unlovable is it\nwritten to the fabric of the universe\nthat no one will ever love you or that\nyou will never be a successful business\nowner whatever it is that you're\ncontinuing to repeat in your head that's\njust false but you're believing it\nbecause you've been saying it so much is\nit written to the fabric of the universe\nis it absolute truth the answer is no\nwhich means that it is a belief and\nbeliefs can be changed your thoughts can\nbe changed your beliefs can be changed\nand so really what it comes down to they\ntalk about in cognitive behavioral\ntherapy is is challenging and testing\nthe validity of your thoughts whenever\nyou notice these thoughts come into your\nhead that are not empowering test the\nvalidity of them is this true is this\nabsolute truth and here's what you're\ngoing to start to realize it's not and\nlike I always tell people the story that\nyou're telling yourself this false\nnarrative that you built your entire\nlife around this identity of who you\nthink you are is like a house of cards\nand once you start testing the validity\nof these thoughts it's like flicking out\nanother card and flicking out another\none it's about to crumble\nyou think that it's this strong personal\nidentity and belief and this is who I am\nand you start testing the validity of it\nand you go oh my God none of this is\ntrue but I am believing in and repeating\nit so much that I am taking it as if is\nabsolute truth and it is not absolute\ntruth at all so what I want you to do is\nwhen you notice negative thoughts come\ninto your head you have to challenge\nthem and when you challenge them start\nto ask yourself what would be a better\npositive affirmation for myself that is\ntrue that is present tense and that is\nempowering and that's what I want you to\nstart doing change the way that you\nspeak to yourself I love that it's not\nweird and woo woo anymore it's actually\nbased in scientific and psychological\nfact when you talk better to yourself\nyou end up thinking better about\nyourself taking better actions and\ncreating a better life for yourself so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode you'd\nprobably also love my book that just\ncame out last month it is called level\nup how to get focused stop\nprocrastinating and upgrade your life it\nis a book on the psychology of how to\ntake action to create the life that you\nwant it's a step-by-step process to\nunderstand the most complex piece of\nMachinery in the world which is the\nbrain and the mindset that is in between\nyour ears so if you want to get it once\nagain it's wherever books are sold is\ncalled level up how to get focused stop\nprocrastinating and upgrade your life\nand with that I'm going to leave you the\nsame way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomeone else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
