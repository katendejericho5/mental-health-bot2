and Friday so\nmake sure you tune in every single day\nto improve your mindset and improve your\nlife speaking of that today we're going\nto be talking about your mental health\nuh and the reason why going to be\ntalking about your mental health is\nbecause Studies have been showing that\nalmost 20% of adults in the United\nStates experience some form of struggle\nor illness that's related to their\nmental health um and this is one of my\nbiggest passions is I know that that\nmental health issues are on the rise and\nthis is why I am doubling down on what\nI'm doing and I'm doubling down on\ntrying to put out more content and help\nyou guys more so that I can try to do\nwhat I can at least to improve the world\nthere's a lot of reasons why Mental\nHealth problems are on the rise though\nthere's a ton of reasons why it could be\nyou know it might be a result of the\npressure that we feel uh to look or act\na certain way from social media uh it\nmight be all of the loneliness that we\nfelt during the pandemic and there's a\nlittle bit of a of a of a of a like it\nstill is kind of pulling us in and some\nsome people are still trying to get past\n2020 and 2021 um there's shifting\neconomies that can really be a result\nthat could really start to hurt\nsomeone's mental health there's\nrelationship issues there's Global\ninstability and there's just life in\ngeneral it could be something completely\ndifferent it could be a breakup it could\nbe not accepting the the past it could\nbe fearing the future there's many\ndifferent things but I'm here to tell\nyou and I'm I'm going to be the person\nthat gives you permission to tell you\nthat your mental health should be your\nnumber one priority not your\nrelationships not your children not your\nwork not your bank account none of those\nthings should be your number one\npriority your number one priority should\nbe your mental health because it affects\neverything else in your life when you're\nnot in a good place it affects all other\nplace of your life when you're in a good\nplace mentally it affects all other\nplace of your life it affects your work\nit affects your relationships uh your\nsuccess your money your happiness your\njoy and without a healthy mind you can\nonly get so far you can only become the\ngreatest version of your limited self\nbut when you start to work on yourself\nyou start to improve yourself well\nthat's when really you can become\nsomething that is amazing and you know\nchasing after your dreams and showing up\nfor your loved ones is already hard\nenough right it's hard enough to always\nbe there for other people it's hard\nenough to chase after your dreams but if\nyou're doing so and you're trying to to\ndo it and you can't get out of your own\nhead and you can't stop holding yourself\nback it makes it even more difficult\nit's like trying to get out of mud and\nno matter how hard you try you feel like\nyou just keep spinning your wheels so\nlet's just jump into it let's talk about\nit let's talk about four science back\nways to keep your mind healthy and to\nhave better mental health the first one\nwhich is is something that you probably\nmight not actually think about or\nrealize is to do something that's called\nseeking out moments of awe on a regular\nbasis all too often we say oh man that's\nyou know we see like a how to we have a\npizza and they're like how was it oh it\nwas awesome oh it was awesome awesome\nawesome but the word awesome means like\nholy crap I am in awe of everything\naround me I am in awe of this spectacle\nof life so to be in a moment of awe is\nnot just like oh that was an awesome\nplay that I just saw when we're going\nthrough hard stuff one of the toughest\nthings to do is to take a a step back\nand to really start to be objective\nabout a situation because usually we're\nin the situation and you've heard me say\nit before in the podcast but when you're\nin the jar you can't read the label and\nsomething that can help us be more\nobjective and less subjective is to try\nto seek out moments of awe or wonder or\nto make ourselves feel small and a part\nof this big system of this universe that\nwe're in a moment of awe really refers\nto those instances in your life when\nyou're so overwhelmed by the beauty by\nvastness or the complexity of something\nthat you feel a sense of wonder and\nmoments of awe can be going out into\nnature it could be doing a meditation\npractice or breath work with it it could\nbe checking out um amazing architecture\nwhen you go to a new city it could be\nwatching a masterpiece movie or\nlistening to a masterpiece piece of\nmusic or going to a show where you see a\nband play that just blows your mind or\nexperiencing something for the first\ntime it's it's one of the reasons why I\nlove every once in a while in the\nmorning watch watching videos about how\nmassive our universe is cuz I get caught\nup in all of my problems as well oh my\nGod all of this stuff I have to do today\nand I'm so busy and what's this person\ngoing to think of me and oh my gosh\nsomeone just put a negative comment on\nmy Instagram or whatever it is it might\nbe I get caught up in all of my BS\nexactly like everyone else is does but\nwhen you start to look at how big the\nuniverse is just knowing that the Earth\nis spinning around the Sun at\n67,000 mes an hour that our galaxy is\nmoving through the universe at\n1.3 million miles an hour an hour from\nright now our galaxy will be 1.3 million\nmiles further in the galaxy in the\nuniverse when it was when we\nfirst actually started thinking about in\nthis moment our galaxy has 100 billion\nstars our galaxy has 100 billion stars\nand there's two trillion galaxies in our\nuniverse that totals to over one septian\nstars in our universe which is a one\nwith 24 zeros behind it when you get\ninto thinking about the vastness of\nsomething like that our problems become\nso much smaller they're not as big of a\ndeal and really science supports the\nimportance of seeking out these moments\ntoo there's a growing number of studies\nthat link consistent exposure to moments\nof awe into nature with lower stress\nlevels increase focus and better overall\nmental health and one of the reasons why\nis because it jump starts when you're in\nthese moments of awe it jumps jump\nstarts What's called the shrinking of\nself it's this feeling of amazement and\ncomplete awe that something is so much\nbigger than you it's like when you're in\na mountain range like sometimes I'm in\nthe mountains and I'm like oh my God\nthis is incredible it's what happens\nwhen you look into the ocean and you see\nhow big the ocean is or you stand on the\nside of a mountain or you look up at the\nstars at night or you look up at the\ntrees during a hike and see how big they\nare it happens every time for me when\nI'm on some sort of long hike and by\nreminding ourselves how immense life is\nand how much more is out there and how\nwe're connected to all of it we're\nbetter able to kind of look at our\nproblems and put them into perspective\nand realize oh yeah this isn't that big\nof a deal you know if you don't if you\nwon't remember it in five years don't\nspend more than five minutes thinking\nabout it it's one of the best parts of\ntraveling to new places you know even if\nyou can't afford to like travel to\nEurope there's moments of awe everywhere\naround you you just have to be curious\nand try to seek them out and do new\nthings so you can be feeling feeling\nmore connected to all that is so that's\nthe first tip try to find moments of awe\nthe second thing I want you to do is to\nfind your ritual recipe I talk a lot\nabout morning routines success habits\nother daily rituals I even have an\nentire section in my book level up where\nI talk about and discuss the importance\nof having rituals and routines in your\nlife and rituals can really help you\norganize the external World it takes a\nlot of uncertainty out of life a lot of\nus stress out about uncertainty so it\ntakes out the uncertainty out of life\nand because that uncertainty can cause a\nlot of stress and anxiety and so rituals\nand routines give us a feeling of Peace\nin order when sometimes uncertainty can\nmake us feel very chaotic and you know\nit brings the feeling of I know what I\nneed to do and all I need to do is take\naction versus sitting there and having\nparalysis by analysis because you have\nso many things that have to be done and\nmy thoughts on developing rituals are\npretty simple bare minimum I think we\nshould just try to have a a routine in\nthe morning in a routine at night and\nthe more simple and the more basic the\nbetter for an ex for an example like I\nknow some people are like I have 17\nsteps to my morning routine I'm like\nnope that's too many you need like one\nor two like I'm a big fan of just making\nmy bed before I start the day it's a\nreally small win but it sends a signal\nto my mind that I'm in full control of\nmy life it tells my brain that I'm going\nto be in charge of my day it makes me\nfeel in\ncontrol and by having that morning\nritual and then immediately going and\nmeditating for 20 minutes I feel like I\nat least have some certainty in my day\nversus waking up and having that\nparalysis by analysis and think about\neverything that I have to do for the day\nbut by having that morning ritual you're\nbasically letting your mind know that\nyou're going to make sure that you have\na productive day you're not going to be\nreactive you're going to have more\nintention into your day you're going to\nbe proactive and it gets positive\nmomentum on my side the first thing in\nthe morning and I could sit here and I\ncould say hey do this one do that do\nthis thing this is what you should do\nbut the truth is not everything works\nfor everyone so you have to just figure\nout what works for you there's no real\nlike cure all solution when it comes to\nfinding the perfect routine for you try\nit out it's trial and error find it\nworks better best for you and then just\nsee what what you enjoy and what makes\nyou feel the best you know like for my\nroutine I wake up I go to the bathroom I\nbrush my teeth I make the bed and then I\nimmediately go first thing in the\nmorning after drinking a cup of water\ngoing and meditating for 20 minutes\nevery single day that's just how I start\nmy day and then every it changes after\nthat sometimes I read in the morning\nsometimes I um journal in the morning\nsometimes I just hang out outside and\njust drink coffee for 45 minutes in\nsilence it changes but I do have those\ntwo or three things that I do every\nsingle morning that bring certainty to\nmy day so that's number two is develop\nsome sort of ritual recipe some routine\nin your life for you uh third thing for\nyour mental health is get involved in\ntherapy and you know I I recommend I\nhighly recommend therapy and I've said\nit over and over and over and over and\nover again in this podcast but I love\nthat the stigma around mental health is\nfinally disappearing and uh I feel like\nmany people are starting to see\ntherapist but not only are they starting\nto see therapist they're also starting\nto talk more about it before 2020 I feel\nlike I never heard anyone talk about\ntherapy or going to a therapist now I\nfeel like it's super often that I hear\npeople saying well I was talking to my\ntherapist the other day and when I was\ntalking to my therapist last week they\nsaid this to me or like I have friends\nthat openly talk about going to therapy\nand\nhonestly I think therapy is helping a\nlot of people and and to really break it\ndown sometimes you just need someone to\ntalk to and a lot of people just T to\ntend to keep things in and so when you\nhave a scheduled event where you go and\ntalk to somebody they can really start\nto help you process what's going on your\nmind and it's I think it's really\nvaluable just to have someone who's\nprofessionally trained not just going\nand talking to one of your friends but\nsomeone who's professionally trained to\ngive you feedback and to give you a\nlittle bit of guidance to keep your\nmental health in a good place and you\nknow one of the best parts is that a\ntherapist they don't really have any\npast with you they don't have any close\ntie to their clients and so you can\ncount on them giving advice that's more\nobjective and not subjective or not\nbiased because they're not based in\nhistory uh with you and they can really\nsee things objectively and not\nsubjectively from their Viewpoint and uh\nthe American Psychological Association\nreports a psychologists in the United\nStates have reported an increase in\ndemand for anxiety treatment since the\nstart of the pandemic so there is\ndefinitely more mental health problems\nover the past couple years but the\nbeautiful thing is that it seems like\nmore people are seeking out help from\nsomebody which is what I always\nrecommend is sometimes just good to have\nsomeone to talk to and obviously there's\na whole lot of work to do around mental\nhealth to completely erase this stigma\naround mental health and trying to\nimprove yourself but I think the good\nnews is things appear to be trending in\na good direction um in the past one of\nthe biggest hurdles to to really getting\nsomebody to getting therapy was a cost\nand unless you in like a really good\nplace or had really good insurance or\nyou were set up financially consistently\ninvesting in therapy and taking care of\nthat bill was just a bill that many\npeople couldn't afford um and today\nsponsor better help is actually one of\nthe leading forces to helping make\nProfessional Therapy more affordable and\naccessible to everyone as well and\nthere's many forms of therapy that you\ncan explore there's many types of\ntherapy one of them is called acceptance\nand commitment therapy it's known as\nAct and the basic premise is that\nsuffering is an essential component of\nhuman life that you really can't avoid\nyou can't avoid suffering you know\nthere's there's going to be pain at some\npoint in time in your life so it's\nhealthier to accept that it's going to\ncome and accept instances of suffering\nas opposed to escaping and trying to\navoid all of the suffering because\nyou're not going to be able to avoid it\nso if you can't avoid it and you can't\nfight it why don't you learn to accept\nit and so avoiding those emotions can\nmake them even worse but instead going\nthrough act it's recommended to learn to\nobserve your negative thoughts and to\nlet them pass you by without\ninternalizing them it's like seeing them\nas a passing Cloud you don't look at the\ncloud and say that is me no of course\nyou just let it go by and you watch it\nGo by same thing can happen for your\nemotions just let your negative thoughts\ngo by and pass you without internalizing\nthem um and this practice can help\nprevent rumination which can contribute\nto really low self-esteem and just\nthinking about your emotions and\nthinking about them and so you know\nwhether it's in-person therapy or online\ntherapy it can really be a big game Cher\nto add therapy to your life online works\njust as well as inperson and as you know\nI love recommending better help as I\nsaid uh which is online and there was\nactually a study that researchers did at\nthe University of California and uh also\nat the San Francisco General Hospital\nand they concluded that users of better\nhelp experience significantly reduce\ndepression symptoms severity of them\nafter engaging with the platform so if\nyou've been thinking about therapy give\nit a shot I think that it's worth trying\nout uh and then number four what I want\nyou to do is to monitor yourself talk\nclosely this is a huge one the way that\nwe speak to ourselves is one of the most\nimportant ways that we can keep our\nminds healthy and it makes sense why\nit's the case there's so many people out\nthere that are just so mean to\nthemselves I remember uh J Shetty had a\nvideo years ago and he sat down with\nthese women that were in their 20s and\n30s and he said hey I want you to write\nhere's a pen and paper write down\neverything bad that you say to yourself\nall the negative stuff write it all down\non pen and paper gives them a few\nminutes you can see him all writing all\nthese stuff down all these negative\nterrible things they say to themselves\nand he says okay come into the other\nroom with me and he brings them into the\nother room with their notebook and pad\nand in the other room are their little\nsisters and they're like 8 11 13 years\nold and he says I want you to sit say\nwhat is on your notepad to your little\nsister and these women are like no\nAbsolut like they are just like shocked\nthat someone would even ask them to do\nthat they will not say the things that\nthey say to themselves to their little\nsisters so then really bre begs a\nquestion why do you say that to yourself\nyou know in our everyday lives we expect\nthings good things to happen to us and\nwe expect to get respect and we expect\nfor other people to love us you know if\nwe expect all these things don't you\nthink that we'll get it so if you're\nalways putting yourself down then how do\nyou expect to develop the level of\nself-love that's necessary for you to\nreach your full potential if you're\nalways saying that you aren't good\nenough or that you aren't smart enough\nhow would that negative selft talk not\nstart to become part of your identity\nand if your identity is rooted in\nnegative\nplace and you don't invest the time to\nheal yourself you might begin\nself-sabotaging whenever life isn't\ngoing the way that you want so if you're\nnegative to how can you expect that you\ncould be negative to yourself and in\nyour mind but everything outside of your\nmind is just going to be amazing and\nbeautiful and even show like studies\nshow that negative consistent negative\nthoughts consistently over long periods\nof time can lead to increased chance of\ndisease poor focus and poor\nrelationships you will get what you\nthink about the most so in order for us\nto really level up and Achieve our\ndreams we need to learn to become our\nbiggest fan our best supporter to speak\nbetter about ourselves and really that's\nwhat it comes down to and um more than\nanything else everybody it's about\nmaking your mental health your number\none priority and to try to focus on\nyourself and also like I said earlier\nit's also to keep in mind that therapy\nis an option if you want to talk to\nsomeone and uh I do want to thank better\nheal for being a a sponsor of this show\nover and over and over again and of this\nepisode and if you want to get 10% off\nyour first month in therapy go to\nbetterhelp.com\ndial and uh you know be on your way
