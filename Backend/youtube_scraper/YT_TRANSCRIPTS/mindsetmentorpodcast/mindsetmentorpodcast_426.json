    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nthe amazing power of your mind this is\nthe mindset Mentor podcast people call\nme the mindset Mentor obviously you know\nI am obsessed with understanding the\nthing that is in between your ears I\nwant to know how I work I want to know\nmy faults I want to know the traps of my\nmind but we're going to talk about how\namazingly incredible your mind is today\nand how if you can Wrangle your mind to\ndo what you want it to do you can\nabsolutely create the the the life that\nyou want and everything that you want in\nyour life and we're going to talk about\nsomething that I think is one of the\nmost incredible things that humans\nrarely ever talk about it's called the\nplacebo effect you've probably heard of\nthe placebo effect before but do you\nreally understand the incredible studies\nthat have been done with the placebo\neffect placebo effect basically means\nthat a doctor comes in and tells\nsomebody hey this pill is going to heal\nyou and that peel that that pill that\nthey give them is nothing it's just a\nsugar pill and they believe that it's\ngoing to heal them and it heals\nthem why do we not have our mind blown\nby this every single day because it's\nestimated that up to 32% of all medical\nhealings come from the placebo effect\nwhich means that people simply believe\nthat they are healed and they end up\nhealing themselves we're given the most\ncomplex piece of Machinery between our\ntwo ears but we have no Manual of how to\nuse it and that's what I want to try to\nhelp you do is help you learn how to\nheal yourself and how to create the\nreality that you want to based off your\nmind and so there's a couple studies I\nwant to talk to you about to actually\nshow you the science behind this uh Ali\nCrum who is a professional of psychology\nat Stanford she's a director of the Mind\nBody lab she created these milkshakes\nright they were just normal milkshakes\nand they measured the physiological\nresponse to somebody's body based off of\nthese milkshakes based off of what they\ntold them about it so they said to them\nhey this milkshake is a high fat high\ncalorie shake and they gave it to them\nand then they gave them the they gave\nthem the exact same shake and they said\nthis right here Weeks Later is a\nsensible low calorie shake and they had\none week with one and then one week with\nanother one and what's crazy about it is\nwhen they told the people that it was a\nhigh-fat high calorie shake their body\nreacted as if there was a lot of fat and\na lot of calories that came in\nwhen they told them it was a sensible\nlow calorie shake their body theem\ncreated uh less gin and gin is the\nchemical that creates the feeling of\nhunger their body created three times\nless gin when they thought they were\ngiven a sensible Shake which means that\nthey thought they were given a sensible\nshake and they just happened to be less\nhungry because of it basically their\nbodies responded as if they had consumed\nless food when they were given the the\nquote unquote low calorie shake and when\nthey were given the quote unquote high\ncalorie high fat shake their bodies\nresponded as that they had consumed more\nfood but they were given the exact same\nShake week one and week two which means\nthat their bodies responded to what they\nthought about the\nshake pretty crazy right let's give you\na couple more there was a group of Hotel\nhousekeepers and they get they went to\nthese Hotel housekeepers and they\nrealized that you know these people who\nare Hotel housekeepers like they're kind\nof working out a lot when you look at\nthe Surgeon General they they say that\nyou should have a minimum of 30 minutes\nof moderate exercise but when you look\nat these women who were Hotel\nhousekeepers they found out that they\nwere getting a lot more than the Surgeon\nGeneral recommended and so three out of\n10 of these women actually thought that\nthey work out and take care of\nthemselves they told half of them that\ntheir work was incredible for their\nbodies and that they were consuming and\nand not not consuming they were burning\nmore calories at their job than the\naverage person does every single day and\nthose women and men excuse me so the the\nhousekeepers men and women they told\nthem that hey you're actually going to\nbe losing weight by having this job and\nby working this job and then half of\nthem they didn't tell them anything the\nhalf that they said hey you're actually\nburning more calories than the average\nperson the ones that thought they were\nburning more calories ended up losing\nweight and they decreased their blood\npressure by on average 10 points because\nthey simply believed that their work was\ngood for their bodies they felt better\nabout their bodies and they felt better\nabout their\nwork they didn't report any differences\nin their diet or their workout routine\nthough pretty crazy isn't it let's give\nyou a couple more there's a thing that\nwas called the Sham surgery trials in\none study patients with ar uh\nosteoarthritis of the knee were either\ngiven a real surgery on their knee or a\nsham surgery which means that they made\nan incision in their knee but they they\ndidn't actually do anything to their\nknee except for put a line in their skin\nso no actual surgical procedure was\nperformed many of those people who\nreceiv received the Sham surgery\nreported improvements in pain and\nfunctional which was comparable to the\npeople who actually underwent the real\nreal surgery so they saw a line in their\nleg and went huh I've gotten the surgery\nthey must have fixed my knee and when\nthey think their knee is fixed guess\nwhat's crazy the knee actually started\nto fix itself okay the last study I'm\ngoing to tell you about about this as\nwell was around IBS irritable bowel\nsyndrome so there was a study that was\nconducted by uh medical uh the Harvard\nMedical School and they involved these\npatients with IBS some of them were\ngiven no treatment While others were\ngiven the placebo pills and the doctors\nwere openly telling them that they were\nsugar pills and there were no active\ningredient so they some of them were\nwere like Hey we're giving you the\nplacebo effect we're giving you a sugar\npill we're just going to see what\nhappens some of them were given this\npill and said Hey listen this pill is\ngoing to help you out with your IBS the\ngroup that took the placebo and thought\nto themselves this is actually going to\nhelp my IBS reported twice the rate of\nsymptom relief compared to the other\ntreatment uh the quote unquote No\ntreatment Group which means that these\npeople thought that this pill was going\nto help their IBS and guess what they\nreported twice the rate of symptom\nrelief compared to the other group which\nshows you study after study after study\nafter study when you think that you are\nhealed you can actually heal yourself\nwhich shows you the power of your mind\nand it shows you the power of the\nmindbody connection now then you got to\nstart to ask yourself if somebody\nbelieves that they are healed and they\nheal thems could it also work the exact\nopposite way where someone thinks\nthey're sick and because they think\nthey're sick they make themselves more\nsick the answer is yes that's called the\nnobo effect when people were told about\nthe negative side effects they're more\nlikely to they're more likely to\nexperience those negative side effects\npeople who thought they had a fever had\na 3 degree jump in their body\ntemperature when they were told by\ndoctors that they had a fever even\nthough they didn't so a doctor said hey\nyou have a fever and their body\ntemperature went up\n3Â° so when sometimes people think\nthey're getting sick it can actually\ncreate that physiological symptoms\ninside of your body there's been studies\non headaches exactly the same where\nthere were experiments that they did\nwhere participants were participants\nwere warned that they might have\nheadaches as a result to high Wi-Fi and\nmobile signals in the area which were\nnot true but they said hey you know in\nthis room there's a lot of Wi-Fi there's\na lot of phone signals you might just\nget a headache the participant\nwho were told that were more likely to\nreport that they had headaches than the\npeople who weren't given those warnings\nthey thought they would get a headache\nguess what they got a headache damn this\nis pretty crazy hey Rob are there any\nother studies on this absolutely let me\ntell you one more one more study is\nwithdrawal symptoms in quote unquote\ndecaffeinated coffee Drinkers and so\nthey took regular coffee Drinkers and\nmost people know that when you stop\ndrinking coffee you're supposed to have\nwithdrawal symptoms so they took regular\ncoffee Drinkers and they were given\ntheir regular morning coffee but were\nfalsely told that they were drinking\ndecaffeinated coffee and a very large\nnumber of those people developed their\nown withdrawal symptoms such as\nheadaches simply due to the expectation\nthat they had\ndecaffeinated but the crazy part about\nit was they were given the regular\nmorning coffee which shows you can make\nyourself healthy you can also make\nyourself sick now in this podcast I'm\nnot trying to say don't go to a medical\ndoctor I'm not trying to say anything\nbad about the health industry any of\nthat stuff I'm just trying to make you\nunderstand that there's a really really\nstrong connection to what you think to\nwhat your body actually does and maybe\njust maybe we're making ourselves sicker\nand maybe just maybe we're holding\nourselves back based off of what we\nactually think about ourselves and\nthere's more data on the placebo effect\nthan any other drug that's ever been\ncreated in the world because the placebo\neffect is required in all drug\nstudies people think they're healed and\nthey're healed how crazy is that\nwhat does this show you it shows you\nthat what you think actually changes\neverything in your life it's not\nnecessarily the circumstances of your\nlife it's not the circumstances of how\nyou were raised\nwhere you come from what your body looks\nlike who you surround yourself it's not\njust the circumstances about you it's\nmore about what you think of yourself\nit's like the story The the parable of\nthere's there's two different two\ndifferent Twins and they go up to one of\nthe twins and you know they were they\nwere raised with an alcoholic father and\nthey go up to one of them who's an\nalcoholic later on in life and they say\nhey why are you an alcoholic and the\nalcoholic one says I'm an alcoholic\nbecause my father was an alcoholic and\nthey go up to the other one who's a\nsuccessful CEO and they say hey why are\nyou successful CEO why are you not an\nalcoholic at your father and he says I'm\nnot an alcoholic because my father was\nan alcoholic those twins had the exact\nsame life the exact same upbringing the\nexact same father but what they thought\nabout their father what they thought\nabout their circumstances and what they\nthought about how they were raised\nchanged what they actually do with their\nlife and I can relate to this because my\nmom's biggest fear in the world is that\nI'm going to be an alcoholic because my\nfather was an alcoholic\nand passed away when I was 15 from liver\nfailure from alcohol so my mom's biggest\nfear is that I'm not I'm going to be an\nalcoholic but I know with every single\ncell in my body there is no universe\nthat I could possibly live in where I am\ngoing to be an alcoholic and I've made\nthat decision now I don't think just to\njust to tell you this I don't think that\nyou can go and eat crappy food all day\nlong and eat fast food and McDonald's\nall day long and say this McDonald's\nhamburger and french fries is making me\nthin this big 1,500 calor milkshake is\nmaking me thin and it's just going to\nmake you thin I'm not saying that but\nwhat I think is that if you tell\nyourself that you enjoy healthy food if\nyou tell yourself that you enjoy taking\ncare of your body then you will love the\ntaste of that food more you will love\ntaking the action to create a healthy\nbody a little bit more you will be more\ninclined to go for that healthier food\nif you're not a fan of going to the gym\ntell yourself that you enjoy taking care\nof your body it might be hard hell yeah\nit's hard going to the gym is hard but\nyou enjoy what it's doing for yourself\nyou enjoy that it's going to allow you\nto live a longer healthier life so that\nyou can be around for your kids more so\nthat you can be around for your\ngrandkids so that you don't have a heart\nattack so that you don't die early tell\nyourself how much you love and you enjoy\ntaking care of your body remind yourself\nhow every set that you put in the gym\nmatters hey yeah this is hard but I\nshowed up for\nmyself and it really comes down to what\nyou actually think I remember one of our\nclients\nin uh in my coaching group mindset\nmental University Amar years ago he was\ntalking about how he was taking a flight\nwith his four kids and his wife and they\nwere going to be going on a trip down to\nPuerto Rico and he said man this flight\nexact words are this flight is going to\nbe a and I said really do you\nthink it's actually going to be a\nbecause if you think it's going to be a\n it's going to be a and I\nsaid you got to think differently and\nhe's like okay I'll I'll tell myself\nthat it's going to be great it's going\nto be amazing and the flight ended up\nbeing amazing\nbut if he had told himself over and over\nagain it's going to be hard it's going\nto be hard it's going to be hard do you\nthink that the flight might have been a\nlittle bit harder do you think he might\nhave caused a little bit more\nrestriction in his own mindset because\nwe get what we're looking for you're\nalways going to get what you're looking\nfor in this world if you're looking for\nall of the reasons why things are going\nto be hard for you you'll find all of\nthe reason why things are going be hard\nfor you if you find all if you look for\nall of the reasons why you're going to\nfollow this path and follow your passion\nand do something that you love you'll\nfind all of the reasons why it exists\nyour brain is like Cosmic Google if you\ntype something into Google you will find\nthat answer for whatever is you're\nlooking for if you go into Google right\nnow and you type is coffee bad for your\neyesight you will find studies that say\ncoffee is bad for your eyesight if you\nGoogle coffee is good for your eyesight\nyou will find all of the proof that show\ncoffee is actually good for your\neyesight your brain is the exact same\nway if you're constantly asking the\nquestions whatever questions you're\nasking and you're constantly looking for\nsomething you will find what you're\nlooking for you have to realize that you\nwill get what you're looking for in your\nlife the question is what are you\nlooking for you have to realize the\npower of your belief you have to change\nyour belief you have to change your\nwords you have to change everything that\nyou speak into existence because your\nbelief changes your words your words\nchange your world and you speak your\nworld into existence so don't ever say\nsomething like I can't do that say\nsomething like I'm not able to do that\nyet or I'm improving at that thing don't\never say I'm not good at math say I'm\nworking at improving myself in math\nbecause ultimately the difference\nbetween those is just closing a door and\nshutting off any\nalternative realities that could exist\nversus leaving the door open to\npossibility or saying I'm not just going\nto leave it open to possibility I'm\ngoing to create my future and what I\nwant to existence your mind is so\nridiculously powerful that you whatever\nyou think whatever you say you will\nspeak into existence and if you've been\nlistening this podcast long enough\nyou've heard me talk about the word\nAbracadabra I always thought that\nAbracadabra up until about 3 years ago\nwas just like the phrase that a magician\nsaid right before they took a rabbit out\nof a hat but if you look at the actual\nword Abracadabra it is a Hebrew word\nthat means as I speak I create as I\nspeak words into reality I create that\nreality now you got to ask yourself what\nis a thought a thought is just speaking\nin your own head isn't it so as you\nthink you also create the question is\nwhat are you speaking into reality what\nare you thinking into reality because\nyou're going to create that thing your\nmind mind is so ridiculously powerful\nyou have to understand that you will\ncreate the reality that you are thinking\nabout most in your life you create your\nreality and in order to succeed you must\nfirst believe you can succeed and not\njust like hey I believe I I can succeed\nbut I'm going to get all 40 50 trillion\nof my C to believe that what I want is\nactually possible there are incredible\nmedical healings that have happened\nbecause of the placebo effect there's\nalso incredible things that people have\ndone to themselves in a negative way\nbecause of the no sibo effect and so\nwhat I really want you to get from this\npodcast episode is the power of your own\nmind what do you thinking what are you\nsaying and if those don't line up with\nthe reality that you're trying to create\nin your life you have to change them and\nthat's what it comes down to so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please do me a\nfavor share it on your
