    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so you never miss\nanother podcast episode and if you love\nthis podcast please give us a rating and\nreview however you listen to us the more\npositive ratings and reviews we get the\nmore of this platform show this podcast\nto people have never listened to it\nbefore today we're going to talk about\nhow your limitations your self-limiting\nbeliefs are fully 100% optional and if\nyou want to create the life that you\nwant and unlock the potential that you\nhave deep inside of you you're really\ngoing to have to overcome these\nself-limiting beliefs and I want to tell\nyou a story that kind of shows the\nself-limiting beliefs that we as humans\nimpose on ourselves maybe you've heard\nof it before maybe you haven't but\nthere's a story about the 4-minute mile\nand the 4-minute mile just to give you\nan idea before\n1954 it was thought that running a mile\nin under 4 minutes was Beyond human\ncapabilities like doctors actually came\nout and said that it was physically\nimpossible for a human to run in less\nthan 4 minutes an entire mile they\nthought that the human heart would\nexplode that was actually what they said\nit would explode it was beyond the\ncapacity of the human body to do that\nbut in 1954 a guy named Roger banister\nwho was a medical student ran the\n4minute mile in 3 minutes and 59.4\nseconds just under 4 minutes everybody\nthought that it was impossible until\nRoger banister ended up breaking the\n4-minute mile he showed that it was\npossible and then here's what's really\ncrazy about it once he showed that it\nwas possible other people who were\nRunners stopped limiting themselves they\nrealized that it was this mythical\nbarrier and it was self-imposed\nlimitations and then here's what's crazy\nabout it after he broke the 4minute mile\nno human in the history of humans had\never ran under 4min minutes for a mile\nand then 46 days after he broke the\nrecord a runner named John Landy broke\nhis record and within 2 years of the\n4minute mile over 300 people ran a mile\nin under 2 minutes now does that mean\nthat the human heart expanded and that\nonce Roger banister did it everybody\nchanged and humans evolved very quickly\nover the next 46 days in the next 2\nyears no they had the ability all of the\ntime to do it but it was a common belief\nthat it was not possible that held them\nback so when you think about that I want\nyou to think about how many 4minute\nmiles do you have in your life how many\nthings do you think are fully impossible\nright now and you're holding yourself\nback from doing them simply because\nyou've never done it before or you've\nnever seen somebody done it before do it\nbefore and so you're sitting there\nsaying ah yeah it's not possible there's\nno way I can do it oh oh I I can't\nbecome wealthy because I come from a\npoor family or I can't have a loving\nmarriage because I never saw a loving\nmarriage as a kid or you know I can't be\na great business owner because I've had\nfailed businesses in the past our lives\nmy life your life if you look through\nour entire lives my 37 years is just\nlittered with\nself-imposed limiting beliefs the same\ngoes for you as well think about how\nmany times you haven't done something or\nyou haven't put 100% into your with with\n100% of your mental capacity and\nphysical capacity to do something simply\nbecause you thought H you know what I\nprobably can't do it and you had that\nself-limiting belief and you didn't put\neverything into it you know if you look\nat so many times throughout human\nhistory we've had self-limiting beliefs\nuntil somebody stepped up and said I'm\ngoing to think differently like people\nthought that human flight was impossible\nthey used to look at birds and be like\nman it would be amazing if humans could\nfly and they thought it was impossible\nuntil the ripe Brothers proved them\nwrong people thought that putting a man\nin space was impossible and then the\nRussians put a man in space in\n1961 people said that landing on the\nmoon was impossible until 1969 when Neil\nArmstrong proved them wrong and you know\nthere's obviously a lot of people are\nsaying oh that was a fluke that was real\nthat was not real who knows what it\nactually was or was not but it seems\nlike the Americans were going to be\ngoing back to the Moon again and we'll\nsee if it is actually real but you're\ntelling me if it is true and it did\nreally happen that in\n1969 we successfully shot a rocket ship\nto a rock that's\n238,900 mil away and it's orbiting the\nEarth at\n2,288 mph and then got them to take off\nfrom that rock and land back on Earth\nsafely and you can't accomplish your\ndreams you can't create the life that\nyou want to you can't create this\nbusiness you can't become a successful\nmusician or painter you're telling me\nthat 1969 they had less technology than\nyou have sitting in your pocket right\nnow on your phone and they were able to\nshoot somebody to the moon and bring\nthem back and you can't

imagination they\nwere impossible until it was done and so\nI want you to think of your life I want\nyou to see where these things are\nlittered all over the place what's\nholding you back from creating the life\nlife that you want to where are you\ntelling yourself that it's not possible\nfor you to do it oh other people might\nbe able to do it but you just don't know\nme Rob you don't know where I come from\nyou don't know my family you don't know\nmy background you don't know how hard my\nchildhood was you don't know the trauma\nthat I've been through and you just\nbasically fight for your own limitations\nso many of us fight harder for our\nlimiting beliefs than we do for the\ndreams that we actually have and want to\ncreate for our lives what limits are you\nplacing on yourself that are completely\n100% false but you're believing them as\nif they if as if they're 100% true as if\nthey're written into the fabric of the\nuniverse you know is it the fear of\nfailure that's holding you back is it\nthe fear of success is it the fear of\nuncertainty oh I don't know what's going\nto be happening in the future I don't\nknow if I become successful will\neverybody that I love abandon me if I\nbecome successful will I lose all of it\nis it the fear of making a mistake is it\nthe fear of being judged by somebody\nelse and that's why you're not doing it\nis it a fear of disappointing someone is\nit the fear of disappointing yourself is\nit the fear of putting so much effort\ntowards something and then it not coming\nto fruition in the way that you actually\nwant it to are you making all of things\nthese things up in your head you are are\nyou taking the safe route are you\nplaying small because you don't want to\nbe seen are your dreams so big and so\namazing that it paralyzes you thinking\nof all the stuff that you must do to get\nthere because if you look look at all of\nthe fears that you have none of those\nfears actually exist and I've kind of I\ndon't want to say I've become an expert\non fears but I've become pretty damn\nexpert expert developed an expertise\naround fears because I had to research\nthe hell of it from my book and I my\nentire first chapter of my book level up\nis entirely on fear and I had to\nresearch fear over and over and over\nagain and what I found is that when you\nlook at fear there's two different types\nof fears one type of fear is a primal\nfear and that Primal Fear means that\nphysical iCal pain or death could be\nattached to it so it is Primal Fear it\nis Primal we do not want to die we do\nnot want to cease living but if you look\nat the fear of disappointing other\npeople the fear of failure the fear of\nsuccess uncertainty making mistakes\nthose are intellectual fears those are\nthose are not Primal fears and so what\nwe're doing is those those intellectual\nfears that we're bringing up and we're\nmaking up inside of our own head they\ndon't actually truly exist they do not\nexist in reality right now so we're\nmaking the Boogeyman and then fighting\nthe boogeyman all day long and using all\nof our energy to fight the boogeyman AKA\nour fears versus using our energy to\ncreate the life that we want we're\nmaking up our fears and then having\nthose fears and limiting beliefs control\nour entire life are you saying that you\ndon't have enough money that you don't\nhave enough time that you're too lazy\nthat you don't have a car that your\nparents weren't good role models for you\nI understand you might have had a hard\nlife I get it there's many people in\nthis world who have had very very hard\nlives and that might be something that's\nheld you back but it's not your fault\nthat you had a hard childhood but it is\nyour responsibility to use the the Cs\nthat you were dealt to the best of your\nability so are you making up your\nlimitations are you making up excuses\nare you making them up and then actually\nthinking that they're true because in my\nopinion the human human body the human\nmind we have near unlimited ability but\nwe restrict our potential so much\nbecause of the limitations that we put\non ourselves excuses that we make up as\nto why we're not living our dreams why\nwe can't reach our dreams we're powerful\nbeyond measure incredibly powerful I did\nmath on this because I was just curious\nhow much how much potential energy is\ninside of the human body and so your\nbody has about 40 to 50 trillion cells\nand each cell has about 1.4 volts of\nenergy in it now if you do the math of\nabout 50 trillion * 1.4 that means that\npotential energy that exists inside of\nyour human body you have about 70\ntrillion volts of energy inside of your\nbody because that's 50 trillion time 1.4\nvolts you have about 70 trillion volts\nof energy inside of your body and then I\nmeasured it so I was like how powerful\nis that like is it very powerful I don't\nis that how much is inside of like my\nlights at my house I don't know how much\nit is so I was like what's something\nthat's really powerful in electric oh a\nlightning bolt the highest ever recorded\nlightning bolt was 300 million volts and\nso if you take 70 trillion which is the\npotential energy inside of all of our\ncells add it together 70 trillion\ndivided by 300 million that means that\nthe potential energy inside of your\nhuman body is about\n233,000 times more powerful than a\nlightning bolt so you're telling me that\nyou're 200 you have potential energy\ninside of your body that's 233,000 times\nmore powerful than a lightning bolt but\nyou're sitting there and you're saying\nto yourself oh I can't do it because I'm\nafraid of failure oh I can't do it\nbecause I'm afraid of what Nancy and HR\nis going to say to me you're holding\nyourself back you are this incredibly\npowerful being that has almost near\nunlimited potential but you're creating\nthis little teeny tiny box and you're\nputting yourself inside the box and\nliving in it the way I like to think of\nit is you're basically like as powerful\nas the genie in Aladdin you're this big\nhuge powerful being but you're putting\nyourself inside of this lamp and you're\nsaying this is where I am this is where\nI deserve to be this is all that I\nbelieve in myself and this infinitely\npowerful being is just stuck in this\nlittle teeny tiny lamp you have to\nrealize you must understand that you are\npowerful beyond measure here's what we\nmust do in order to achieve our goals we\nhave to rise above our limitations\nthey're going to be there you're going\nto feel fears you're going to fear ex\nyou're going to feel excuses you're\ngoing to want to create excuses you're\ngoing to feel your self-limiting beliefs\nyou have to learn to break past those\nwhen we tell ourselves that it's\nimpossible we must immediately remind\nourselves why it is possible and how it\nis going to happen how we want it to\nhappen and command it to happen the way\nthat we want it to it comes down to you\nand it always comes down to what's going\non inside of your head it all comes down\nto what you believe that's why I believe\nyour mindset is the most powerful thing\nthat you have and that's the thing that\nyou should be working in day in and day\nout it's the only thing that holding you\nback it's not the money it's not the\npast it's not your current situation\nit's not your spouse it's not your\nfamily it's not where you live it's not\nyour skin color it's not your sex it's\nnot the fact that you don't have a car\nit's not the the fact that you don't\nhave a circle of influence that's\npowerful and helps you out no it's none\nof those it's what's going on in your\nmind you know there's a study done with\nfleas years ago and an average flea can\njump up to 12 Ines high but when you put\na flea inside of a jar and you put the\ntop on top of it it'll jump and it'll\njump in because of the fact that can\njump up to 12 in and it's a 3-in jar\nit'll hit itself it'll hit itself it'll\nhit itself and then it learns that it\ncan't jump any higher and so it doesn't\njump above three inches because it\ndoesn't want to injure itself from the\ntop of the jar and then so what they do\nis they take the flea out of the jar and\nthe rest of its life it continues to not\njump higher than 3 in here's the crazy\npart though then that flea will have\nOffspring and that Offspring will not\njump higher than 3 in so it's also learn\ntoo your your limitations are learned\nfrom other people but also it's passed\ndown to your children if you don't break\nthrough through it so you can say I want\nto get better I want to get better but\nyou've also got a realize your children\nif you have them they're around they're\nviewing you they're seeing it and\nthey're understanding and basically\nunderstanding and also integrating your\nlimiting beliefs into them as well it's\nyou it's always been you you are the one\nthat's holding yourself back we need to\nbe reprogramming our minds more than we\nneed anything else and what I really\nwant to do is I want you to start to\nthink about this I want you to start to\nthink about how you hold yourself back\nand so I want you to do is if you have a\npen and paper around you go grab a pen\npen and paper real quick pause me if you\nneed to go get it and I want to leave\nyou with a question and I want you to\njournal through this question and\nactually start to think about it what\nlimitations are you placing on yourself\nwrite them all down write down all the\nlimitations the limitations in your mind\nwrite down all the fears write down all\nthe limiting beliefs all of the things\nthat you believe are true but a belief\ndoesn't mean that it's actually true\nit's just something that you're\nbelieving is true even when it's not so\nwhat limitations are you putting on\nyourself what are you placing on\nyourself write them all down and then\nwhat I want you to ask yourself is\nanother question to follow up with this\nhow are all of those limitations false I\nwant you to challenge your thoughts one\nof the best parts about cognitive\nbehavioral therapy is they teach you how\nto challenge every single thought to see\nif there's truth behind it because all\ntoo often we're creating thoughts and\nwe're creating limiting beliefs and\nfears that are not true but we think\nthat they are and you want to start to\nchallenge your thoughts and challenge\nyour beliefs and challenge everything\nthat comes into your mind so you can\nstart to reprogram them write all of\nthem down and look at all of them every\nday every time you start to to doubt\nyourself and you'll say oh yeah like I'm\nseeing this and I remember this fear of\nfailure coming up before but if I can\nsee on this piece of paper I challenge\nthat fear of failure and I actually\nrealized that yeah I do actually truly\nbelieve that failure is an aspect of\nsuccess it's two sides of the same coin\nso therefore shouldn't be afraid of\nfailure if I want success eventually I\nneed to realize that I have to go\nthrough multiple layers of failure in\norder to achieve success all right I'm\ngoing to take some action and when you\nstart to challenge these thoughts you\nactually start to reprogram yourself if\nthere's one thing that I don't want to\nbe it's realistic because when you're\nrealistic you're basically following the\npath of other Medi other mediocre people\nyou're not listening to this podcast\nbecause you want to be mediocre you're\nlistening to this podcast because you\nwant to create something great from your\nlife and so what you have to do is\nunderstand that your limitations are\noptional they are not real and if you\nfully want to unlock your potential\nyou're going to have to learn to\novercome your self limiting beliefs to\ncreate the success the happiness The Joy\nthe love the peace everything that you\nwant in your life because ultimately you\ncreate your reality from what's going on\nin your mind so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories tag me in
