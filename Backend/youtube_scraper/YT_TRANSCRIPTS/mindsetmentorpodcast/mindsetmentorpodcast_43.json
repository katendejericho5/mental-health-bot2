    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to surround yourself\nwith the right people so that you can\nimprove your life let's dive in there\nare friendships where you just can you\nknow be stagnant and it's the same as it\nwas 10 years ago and neither one of you\nchallenge each other or there could be\nfriendships where both of you by being\nin this relationship with each other\nmake each other better same way that\nyou're in a romantic relationship and\nhopefully you and your partner make each\nother better well when you're in a real\nrelationship friendship with somebody\nyou should also make each other better\nbut let's let's zoom out real quick what\nis friendship in the first place you\nknow yeah sure it's people who have the\nsame Hobbies as you people who make you\nlaugh people that are fun to be around\npeople who show up for you no matter\nwhat people who are very loyal to you\nthose are definitely some good qualities\nit's all of these things but there's one\naspect that I think gets overlooked when\nit comes to Friendship\nand I believe and maybe somebody else\nout there believes something different I\nthink that your friends should challenge\nyou to grow I think your friends should\nmake you better and I think you should\ndo the exact same thing for them your\nfriends should challenge your mediocrity\nthey should call you out on your\n they should get you out of your\ncomfort zone when they see that you're\ngetting a little bit too comfortable and\nI don't mean in the way of they should\nhumiliate you I don't mean that your\nfriend should be literally you and you\nshouldn't do the same for them but they\nshould help you grow into and evolve\ninto the type of person that you want to\nbe and you your job should also be to\nhelp them grow into evolve into the\nbetter version of them as well and your\nfriends in reality can either be part of\nthe reason why you're growing they can\nuh they can challenge you they can\nverbally and energetically challenge you\nbut also uh with their own\nactions or they could also at the same\ntime be the reason why you're not\ngrowing because you've probably heard it\nsaid but you're the average of the five\npeople that you spend the most time with\nyou are I saw a thing that that said\nthat if if you're um if you're friends\nwith people who are five people who are\nuh obese you have an 83% higher chance\nof being obese at some point in time in\nyour life and it's not saying there's\nanything wrong with people who are obese\nI'm not saying that at all it just shows\nyou that typically what we do is we\nhappen to take the habits and be the\nsame as the people that we spend the\nmost time with and so what I think is\nreally important for everybody to\nunderstand is take a step back look at\nwho you surround yourself with and say\nwhat I want to trade places with these\npeople are these people inspiring me are\nthey helping me am I helping them am I\ninspiring them you know your friends\nshould be part of the reason why you're\ngrowing and you should be part of the\nreason why they're growing and you\nshould challenge them you know this\nisn't a competition this isn't like hey\nI'm trying to beat you you could compete\nat some things and all that but it's it\nin the the sense of you challenging them\nit's like I love you too much for you to\nnot live up to your potential if you if\nyou really truly love your friends\nshouldn't you want the best for them\nshouldn't you want the the the the most\nin their life that they can get out of\nit like hey I'm not going to let you be\nless than I know you can\nbe and so some people like that and some\npeople don't and so if you're listening\nthis podcast you're the probably the\ntype of person who would love to be\nchallenged by some of your friends you\nprobably are if you weren't into that\nyou probably wouldn't be listening to\nthis podcast and so surrounding yourself\nwith people who are fine with mediocrity\nwho don't confront their fears who don't\nchallenge their own boundaries who don't\npush themselves to be better who don't\nread who don't meditate who don't\nJournal who don't try to grow thems\nevery single day who don't have a a\nroutine of growing themselves mentally\nphysically emotionally spiritually\nif they don't have that\nroutine it will influence you to follow\na similar path of complacency and I\ndon't want to go into this podcast\nepisode and make you think that I'm just\ntrashing people who are not into that\nbut if you're the type of person who\nwants to grow it becomes so much easier\nto grow when you surround yourself with\npeople who are wanting to grow it\nbecomes so much easier to work out when\nyou have friends that work out if you go\nto a place let's say you're like you\nknow what I'm out of shape if I want to\ngo to CrossFit I'm just going to start\nhanging out at CrossFit and you go to\nCrossFit and you work out a few times\nand you make a couple friends who have\nbeen going to CrossFit for four or five\nyears and you hang out around them and\nyou spend a lot more time with them you\nwill naturally start to eat better\nyou'll start to think more healthy\nthoughts you're going to start to be a\nlittle bit more healthier in your\ndecisions you're going to probably show\nup to CrossFit more because your friends\nare there when you really truly choose\nfriends who challenge you who push you\nout of your comfort zone you're taking a\nsignificant step towards personal growth\nand fulfillment\nand\nultimately isn't that what everybody\nwants don't you want to be fulfilled\ndon't you want to bring out your\npotential don't you think that every\nsingle one of your friends want to be\nfulfilled as well and don't you think\nthey also want to bring out the\npotential and I really think that it's\nimportant to have brutal loving honesty\nin a friendship this is my own personal\nopinion but I'm just going to give it to\nyou right you might think that you don't\nwant your friends to challenge you that\nyou want to prioritize keep the peace\nbut if you do that that encourages\nstagnation and more than anything else\nkind of mediocrity if our friends never\nchallenge us and we never challenge them\nwe never push each other to be better\nthen we risk becoming too comfortable\nand too complacent and so we risk\nremaining in our rut in the same place\nnever quite reaching our full\npotential hey real quick I want to\nintroduce you to something called\nmindset Mentor plus if you love this\npodcast you will absolutely love what\nI'm about to talk about I designed\nmindset mentor plus to help you actively\nintegrate every one of these

your challenge or\nmean-spirited criticism in some sort of\nway but for a loving Challenge and\nguidance listen man you said you wanted\nto work out four times a week and get in\nbetter shape at the beginning of this\nyear\nthat was 5 months ago what are you doing\nyou gained weight what are you going to\ndo about it how can I help hold you\naccountable to that listen I love you\ntoo much to let you let go of yourself\nyou know you're not going to let go of\nyourself I love you too much it's\nhappening I'm going to push you to your\ngoals I love you too much not to hit\nyour goals you got to get your\ntogether you know and I had a uh a\nconversation with my wife about this a\nfew months ago we were talking about one\nof her friends and one of her friends\nand some stuff that's going on and I was\nlike have you told her her how you feel\nand kind of your Viewpoint of what's\ngoing on you know she said she wanted to\ndo this she's not doing this and she's\nlike no I'm kind of afraid to and and I\nwas like well if you're not going to say\nand reflect back to her what you are\nseeing and what she said she wanted to\ndo but she's not doing if you're not\ngoing to reflect it back and she's one\nof your best friends do you think\nanybody in her life is reflecting this\nback to her I don't think so knowing\nthat and who she surrounds herself I was\nlike I don't think anybody else is going\nto say this to her\nso yeah friends are supposed to have fun\ntogether there you know it's not just\nhey we're only supposed to challenge\neach other but it's like supposed to\nhave fun together you're supposed to do\nthings together you're supposed to make\nyou laugh all of that type of stuff but\nat the same time like a friend a real\ndeep loving friend is like I love you\ntoo much to\nnot to I love you too much to not allow\nyou to not force you and help you get\nyour together to do what you said\nyou wanted to do to lose the weight that\nyou said you wanted to I'm not trying to\nmake you into what I want you to be I'm\ntrying to make you into what you told me\nthat you wanted to be true friends\nshould not tolerate mediocrity in one\nanother true friends keep each other at\ntheir Edge the edge of the comfort zone\nyou need to find more people or spend\nmore time with people who live at their\nEdge because then it inspires you to\nlive at your Edge I remember when I was\nfirst getting\ninto uh de developing my business and\nand growing online and starting to\nunderstand that I used to go to\nnetworking events and i' I've shared the\nstory before this place that's here in\nAustin it's called internet marketing\nparty and I would go there and I had\nmade $er in my business online I was\njust starting it I would get around\npeople that were making $10,000 a month\n$50,000 a month a couple $100,000 a\nmonth and I was like what in the hell is\nthis this is crazy and and really just\nby being around them and developing\nfriendships and going and getting coffee\nand meeting new people and co-working it\njust expanded my mindset to what I\nthought was possible it's kind of like\nit's kind of like learning a new\nlanguage where like if I grew up in\nAmerica I'm going to speak English but\nif I grew up in Italy I'm going to speak\nItalian and so it's kind of the same\nthing was like I had never grown my\nbusiness online I wasn't able to speak\nthat language but as I was around them\nand I started to get pieces of what they\nwere talking about and the ways they\nchallenged thems and how they used\nclickfunnels and how they wrote copy and\nhow they started doing I was like oh I'm\npicking up little pieces as if I just\nmoved to Italy and I'm starting to pick\nup pieces of of the words that they're\nsaying that's what happens when you\nsurround yourself with people that are\nlike that that are just a little bit\ndifferent that are a little outside of\nyour comfort zone the people that we\nsurround ourselves with significantly\nimpact Our Lives that's why it's so\nimportant for us to choose our friends\nwisely and I hope you take this the\nright way but not everybody deserves\nyour time and that's okay and there are\nsome people and I've done this before\nwhere I've kept friends around for a a\nreally long time just simply because of\nthe fact that we had history together\nbut it was kind of like we both had the\nfeeling that this relationship was\nalmost over it's like almost like time\nto turn a page and I always say you\ndon't have to get rid of people in your\nlife unless you feel like you need to\nyou don't have to get rid of people but\ncan you just for the next few months\npull back time with some people and then\ngive more time to other people can you\nsome of you guys are sitting there and\nsaying yeah but I don't have any friends\nwho challenge me I don't have any people\nthat I know who are making themselves\nbetter okay find\nthem where are they at you want to get\nbetter at your your working out go to\nthe gym and hang out there find a person\nwho's really fit strike up a\nconversation with them go to like I said\nCrossFit or something like that go to\nyou know Brazilian jiu-jitsu do\nsomething go to a boxing club whatever\nit is that you want to that's something\nthat you're interested in start talking\nto other people I guarantee you'll make\na couple of friends that's just kind of\nhow it goes you're into self-development\nokay go to some conferences who's your\nfavorite person that you listen to that\nwho book you read do they have\nconferences do they have you know groups\nor communities that they built even\nonline where you could start to connect\nwith other people like them all you\nreally need is a couple friends who\nchallenge you and challenge your\nworldview who who live at their Edge who\nface their fears and just live a little\nbit beyond those I have a friend who\nreally challenged my beliefs at one\npoint where you know he was extremely I\nkeep saying was like he's dead he's not\ndead uh he challenged me in the sense\nthat he was almost 20 years older than\nme and in way better shape than me and I\nwas like what am I doing I just he's\nhe's way more successful than than I am\nhe's definitely busier than I am and\nhe's way more fit and so I just like Hey\nman can I start coming over to your\nhouse and work out with you he's like\nyeah absolutely cool he's got a gym\nthat's off to the side of his house we\njust worked out together got in better\nshape started being around him learning\nfrom him seeing what he does how he\ninteracts the world he's got a great\nmarriage he's gr to great relationship\nwith his children all of this stuff and\nI just started learning from being\naround him the thing that I think is\nimportant as we start to look at this is\nthere are people who are and let me put\nit this way there are people who are\nmasculine people who are who are\nfeminine as well I have a friend and\nwhen I say masculine notice I'm not\nsaying man or woman we all have\nmasculine qualities we all have feminine\nqualities so like a masculine qualities\nare push challenge grow get out of your\ncomfort zone a feminine quality is like\nlove acceptance hold space for\nemotions there are people out there who\nrepresent the masculine and The Feminine\nvery well I I have uh I have definitely\nI have one friend I'm thinking of\nspecifically he is yeah about 16 years\nolder than me and he is well he's also\nhe's also another person who's way more\nfit than I am as well damn it I have\nthese friends that are older than me\nthat are way more fit and he is the\nPerfect Blend that I've seen in somebody\nof masculine and F feminine like he is\nextremely loving like way more loving\nthan I've ever seen in almost any other\nman in a like friendship but also at the\nsame time is like hey get\nyour together like he will talk to\nme that way at the times when I need him\nto talk to me that way and so you know\nstart to find people who are as loving\nas you want to be who who have uh you\nknow accept you who hold space for all\nof your emotions find friends that\nchallenge you that push you that help\nyou grow that help you get out your\ncomfort zone that expand your world view\nof what's possible you know when you're\nfriends with somebody and they're like\nyou know what I'm going to go travel I'm\ngoing to run my business and travel for\n3 months out of the country it makes you\ngo huh I wonder if I could do that like\njust people that just think differently\nyou know they give you different\nperspectives in life they listen to you\nthey give you another perspective they\nthey support you and guide you when you\nfeel like you need it and a lot of times\nthese types of people can be honest\nmirrors and and show you your strengths\nand show you your weaknesses not\ncriticize you but help you really\nunderstand yourself a whole lot better\nand they can suggest like concrete\nactions not to control your life but to\ngo you know what like I think that this\ncould help you out if you did this and\nhelp you get your potential to come out\nof you more so how do you get\nfriendships like\nthis most people are asking this right\noh I live in a place where I don't have\nany friends like this I don't I've never\nhad friends like that honestly here's\nwhat it comes down to and you're listen\nthis podcast so you're already starting\non this path but you need to step up\nyour life to attract people like this\nfriends who challenge each other and\nhelp each other grow and you know\nrefined your character and all that type\nof stuff is you are going to attract the\ntype of PE people that you are so if\nyou're looking at yourself and you're\ngoing oh my gosh like I don't know if I\ncould track this type of person well how\ncan you be better how can you level\nyourself up how can you start going you\nknow what I do need to be in better\nshape I'm going to start finding some\nfriends that are in incredible shape\nwhat am I going to do I'm going to go to\nthis gym I'm workout three times a week\nno matter what if you want to attract\npeople like this then you need to also\nget it\ntogether if you want to attract people\nlike that guess what they want to\nattract people like that so what do you\noffer I'm sure you offer some great\nthings how can you get better how can\nyou challenge yourself how can you push\nyourself to grow because once you start\nto grow and you get that energy of like\nI'm growing I'm improving I'm growing\nI'm improving and you start getting\naround other people who are thinking the\nsame way naturally like magnets you're\ngoing to start to attract to each other\nand so once again this
