    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout nine things that I recommend that\nyou stop doing right now ready let's\ndive into it let's not even mess around\nthe first thing I want you to stop doing\nis stop making excuses excuses are like\nbutth holes everyone's got one and they\nall smell they're all they all stink\nthey're all terrible nobody wants to\nhang around a butthole nobody wants to\nhang around their excuses and I want you\nto understand with your excuses\nthat you create have you ever made an\nexcuse and been like yeah I'm really\nglad that I did that usually not usually\nyou make an excuses to why you didn't do\nsomething that was good for you for me\nthis is coming everybody just so you\nknow this is coming from somebody who\nused to be an incredibly professional\nexcuse maker I used to be able to make\nan excuse for every reason why I wasn't\nwhere I wanted to be and why it was\neverybody else's fault but my own but\nwhen you stop making excuses what you\nreally start doing is you really start\nactually taking control of your life you\nreally start saying everything that\nhappens in my life is is my fault and so\ninstead of getting pressure from that it\nputs you in the driver seat and so the\nfirst thing I really want you to do is\nstop making excuses in your life the\nsecond thing I want you to do stop doing\nis to stop playing the victim too many\npeople out there play the victim they\nact like the life that they have just\nhappened to to them not by not by their\nown actions but by somebody else's\nactions oh it's it's kind of like\nexcuses too oh it's not my fault it's\nsomebody else it's somebody else's fault\nsomebody else did this to me oh no I'm\nnot where I want to be because it's my\nparents' fault or it's my spouse's fault\nor because I didn't grow up in a good\npart of town or because I didn't have\ngreat mentors around me right like you\nmight have not had the best life that's\nnot your\nfault but it is your responsibility now\nto figure out what to do with your life\nat this moment it's your responsibility\nto make a difference you were given the\nhand that you were dealt I was given the\nhand that I was dealt yeah I was dealt\nwith a hand where my father was an\nalcoholic I wasal dealt with the hand\nwhere he passed away when I was 15 I was\ndealt with the hand where we didn't have\na lot of money I was dealt with the hand\nwhere I didn't really have many mentors\naround me and I could use all of the\nexcuses if I really want to and blame\neverybody else but myself but what is\nthat going to give me is that am I going\nto look back at the end of life be like\nman I'm so glad I played the victim so\nmuch no I'm not going to I'm going to go\ndamn now I get it I feel like everybody\nhas an Awakening process at the end of\ntheir life where they go oh man now I\nsee it now I see what I did wrong now I\nsee what I was supposed to do oh my gosh\nI was blaming everybody else but\nmyself and you got to stop acting like\nsomething that that everything is\nhappening to you and start realizing\neverything happening for you everything\nis happening for you now it might feel\nlike it's happening to you in the moment\nwhen you think very short term it feels\nlike it's happening to you but when you\nlook over the next 10 to 20 years when\nyou look back 20 years from today you'll\ngo oh damn now I see why I had to have\nthat challenge now I see why that person\nhad to die where I had to have that\nHealth Challenge now I see why that\nperson had to break up with me and it\nall ends up being for your benefit in\nthe long run so you've got to stop\nplaying the victim and think that the\nworld is happening to you and realize\nthat it is happening for you and that\nyou are the one to blame for everything\nit is not your fault your past where you\ngrew up your parents all of that but is\nyour responsibility to do something\nabout it now number three stop\ncomplaining and instead start looking\nfor Solutions stop complaining figure\nout a way to get your life back on track\nif it's where you want to be even if\nit's like okay if life is okay don't\ncomplain about what you don't have if\nyou want something you're are human the\nbeautiful thing about being a human you\ncan do anything that you want you can\ncreate any future that you want you've\njust got to be able to put the work in\nmy one of my my very first mentors used\nto say life is just like a buffet you\ncan have anything that you want but you\njust have to be willing to pay for it I\nwas like o damn that's good you can have\nanything that you want it's like but\nyou're going to have to pay for it in\nsome sort of way you're going to have to\nput in the dues the dues have to be paid\nand if you don't want to pay the dues\nyou're not going to get the life you\nwant and so when you're starting to look\nfor Solutions use something that I call\nthe 131 method I have a problem boom\nI've identified one problem 1 3 1 one\nI've identified one problem three I'm\ngoing to come up with three possible\nsolutions to this problem okay I'm\ntrying to figure out the best possible\nsolution so one three and then the one\nI'm going to identify the one solution\nthat I want to try to take action on\nFirst and see if it works so instead of\ncomplaining and saying I don't know if I\ncan do it this is not my fault why did I\nget get these cards dealt to me it's\nlike boom number one I have a problem\nthree here's three possible solutions\none here's the one I'm going to take\naction on what first and see if it\nactually works get into the driver SE of\nyour life and start taking action to\ncreate the life that you want number\nfour stop being afraid of failure this\ndrives me crazy failure is your greatest\nteacher you want to fail as fast as\npossible and as many times as possible\navoiding failures is one of the biggest\nthings that I see that holds people back\nsuccessful people that I've seen in my\nlife want to fail as quick as they\npossibly can and as often as they\npossibly can why because through the\nfailures you learn all of your lessons\nyou don't learn many lessons through\nsuccess you learn some you learn a whole\nlot more through failure I was being\ninterviewed on a podcast earlier today\nand the guy was asking me about failure\nand I said yeah I mean I can look at my\nbusinesses before the business that I\nhave now and I could say yeah those\nthree businesses all failures they were\njust complete failures or I can see oh I\nhad to have the quote unquote failure\nin those businesses to extract the\nlessons of what works in a business but\nalso extract the lessons of what doesn't\nwork in a business so that when I built\nthe business that I have now I can build\nthe business based off of all of my past\nif you're married right now and you've\nbeen you had you know 14 girlfriends\nover the course of your life before you\ngot married to your wife you had 14\nother girlfriends would you say those\nare all failed relationships or were\nthey all relationships where you learned\nwhat it is that you wanted what it is\nthat you didn't want what you did well\nwhat you didn't do well it cuz if I'm\nlooking back at like my relationships my\nvery first relationship with my first\ngirlfriend I was a shitty boyfriend and\nI'm kind of sad about it I wasn't good I\nwas selfish I didn't know what I was\ndoing i' never been in a relationship I\ndidn't know how to act in a relationship\nI'm so glad that I had those\nrelationships that I messed up so many\ntimes in those relationships so that I\ncould be different in my relationship\nnow with my wife so would I say those\nare failures no I would say that they\nwere all relationships that were lesson\nfor me so stop being afraid of the\nfailure because the failure is what you\ncan't failure and success are the same\nthing they're just opposite sides of the\ncoin it's like if you played basketball\nand you're just like I don't want to\nshoot because I don't want to miss a\nshot you're going to have to miss shots\nif you're in baseball and you're like an\nAllstar in the major leagues you strike\nout 70% of the time you're an Allstar if\nyou strike out 70% of the time A lot of\ntimes and the creator of Honda says that\nsuccess is 99% failure so I'm trying to\nget to that 1% % success so how can I\nget rid of all my fa failures as quick\nas possible failures are not failures\nthey're just a part of success and\nthey're all learning lessons you just\ngot to learn from each one of them hey\nif you're loving this episode please do\nme a real quick favor give us a like\ndown below it helps in the YouTube\nalgorithm and in case you didn't know\nthis is a podcast this podcast audio is\neverywhere where podcasts are so if you\ngo for a drive and listen to podcast or\nif you listen to them while you're\nworking out you can also listen to the\nmindset Mentor anywhere where podcasts\nare available that's number four number\nfive stop putting things off stop\nprocrastinating get your together\nand just make a decision and go all too\noften people are just sitting around\nthey're like well I don't know what the\nright decision is and I'm planning and\nI've been planning on my planning and\nI've been planning to planning to plan\nand I've been planning to plan to plan\nto plan to plan and you're too busy\nplanning and all of this you just have\nto stop putting things off you just got\nto ready fire aim ready fire make\nadjustments after you started taking\naction right cuz when you ready fire aim\nand you don't worry about procrastin you\nyou don't procrastinate you don't worry\nabout failure you don't worry about\nmessing up in your eyes it's all part of\nit and you're like ready fire aim when\nyou're ready fire aiming not ready aim\nfire ready fire aim you're going I want\nto make mistakes as fast as possible I\nwant to stop over planning and then\nplanning and then planning your planning\nyou're putting things off you're\ndelaying the inevitable you're trying to\nstay away from failure you're trying to\nstay away from other people's judgment\nyou're trying to stay away from other\npeople's opinions you're trying to stay\naway from messing things up when in\nreality you've got to get to those\nthings as soon as possible and so you\nprocras because you don't I always say\nprocrastination is never the actual\nproblem procrastination is the\ndownstream effect of the problem and so\nyou might be procrastinated because\nyou're worried worried about being\njudged you might be procrastinated\nbecause you're worried about failing you\nmight be procrastinated because you're\nworried about um other people's\njudgments of you you might be\nprocrastinating because you're worried\nabout you thinking that if you were\nsuccessful other people would abandon\nyou or whatever it might be you've got\nto stop putting things off you've got to\nlearn to make a decision and take action\none of the most prominent things that\nthey find with successful people is they\nmake decisions very quickly people that\nare not successful tend to delay\ndecisions whether it's the right\ndecision or wrong decision any action is\nbetter than no action at all and so stop\nputting things off and just start taking\nmore action number six stop being so\nhard on yourself man you're a human\nyou're trying your best like I'm proud\nof you you've done a lot you realize\nthat you've been through a lot of\nin your life you have I have too look at\nat us look at us we're still breathing\nwe're still here we'll still trying our\nbest you know don't look at don't look\nat your past and be like man I really\nscrewed that up I should have done\ndifferent and regret and be so hard on\nyourself you did the best you could at\nthat moment no matter how good or how\nbad it seemed like it was you're a human\nyou're going to up a lot you want\nto know the biggest key to being happier\nlearn to let things go you know you're\ncaring things that happened to you years\nago it's like the the phrase these uh\nthese these mountains that you're\ncarrying you were only meant to climb\nthose things that you the hardships you\nonly meant to to car to climb them once\nand you've been putting them in your\nbackpack you've been carrying them with\nyou for years you can't get mad at\nyourself over something that you did\nfive years ago you know you're you're\nsmarter you're wiser than you were 5\nyears ago you got to stop being so hard\non yourself you got to give yourself\nmore grace if you've been trying to work\nout and lose some weight and you did\nreally good for 14 days and you screwed\nup on one day don't focus on the one day\nget oh I messed up okay yeah see where I\nmessed up but I did do really well for\n14 days and I'm proud of myself for that\nnow let me make some plans to make sure\nI don't mess up as often and you just\nget better don't be so hard on yourself\nthat's number six number seven stop\ntrying to control everything you just\ngot to learn to realize you can control\nalmost nothing you know I did an episode\na couple weeks ago that was talking\nabout like we live on a planet that's\nspinning a th000 miles an hour that's\ngoing around the around the Sun at like\n67 ,000 mil hour and our solar system is\nrunning at like\n433,000 miles an hour through the\nuniverse and we have something like 20\nbillion stars inside of our\ngalaxy I think it's actually I'm sorry I\nthink it's a 100 billion stars in our\ngalaxy this is off top of my head and\nand there's 100 billion stars in our\ngalaxy and there's two billion or two\ntrillion some crazy freaking number\namount of galaxies that exist in this\nuniverse and you're trying to control\ncontrol everything you can't control\nanything we can barely control our\nthoughts stop trying to control\neverything outside of you and just with\ntrying to stop trying to control\neverything you've got to develop the\nmuscle of faith of just hey things are\ngoing to work out for me things that\ncome to me that I love I'm grateful for\nthings that come to me that are really\nbig challenges I'm grateful for because\nI believe that the challenges are\nbrought to me for me to be able to get\nbetter not to make me crumble but for me\nto get stronger that's really what you\nhave to realize so stop trying to\ncontrol everything stop trying to\ncontrol every body\nelse just be a little bit more you're\nnot a human doing you're a human being\njust allow there to be\nmore in your life there's not even a\nword for it just\nmore don't White Knuckle your way\nthrough your life allow there to be a\nlittle bit more ease that's number seven\nstop trying to control everything number\neight really important stop giving up on\nyourself stop giving up on yourself you\nneed to want to succeed for yourself\nyou need to stop putting other needs in\nfront of your own you deserve to follow\nthrough for yourself how many times have\nyou given up on yourself you need to\nfollow through on that business idea\nfollow through on your Fitness plans\nfollow through on your family plans you\ndeserve it you deserve all of it you\ndeserve all of that stop giving up on\nyourself imagine if you you know that\nbusiness that you had four years ago and\nit got really tough and you decided to\nlet it go where would you be now if you\ndidn't give up you ever thought about\nthat think about how many things you've\ngiven up on in the past that you\nprobably shouldn't have where would you\nbe now if you hadn't given up on it if\nyou hadn't given up on that business if\nyou hadn't given up on that relationship\nif you hadn't given up on those\ninvestment plans where would you be now\nwhere would your relationship be now\nwhere would your Investments be now if\nyou hadn't given up and you would have\njust followed through on something in\nyour life finally just learn to follow\nthrough and stop giving up on\nyourself which brings us to Number Nine\nstop settling for\nokay it's sad how many people just\nsettle for an okay life you have the\nfull capacity within you to make the\nmost incredible life that you could\nthink of it's in you it's there I\npromise you stop settling for just\nthings being okay stop settling for an\nokay relationship with your spouse an\nokay relationship with your kids an okay\ntravel schedule an okay bank account\nstop settling for just H all right\nthat's fine I guess it's all right you\nget one shot at this life maybe we get\nmaybe we die and we go to heaven or hell\nmaybe we die and we get reincarnated\nmaybe we die and we become warm food I\ndon't know the answer you actually truly\ndon't know the answer either there's\nbeliefs there's dogmas there's religions\nthere's all these things that tell us\nwhat they think but we actually won't\nknow until we actually go through the\nprocess but as far as we do know you do\nhave this life right I do know that I do\nhave this life as a 37-year old male\nnamed Rob dial I do have this life so I\ndo get one shot at being me I don't want\nto settle for anything less than\namazing and I don't think you want to\neither that's why you listen to this\npodcast but what you really have to make\nup is to have the mindset of stop\nsettling for okay stop settling for this\nis good enough I don't want to get to\nthe end of my life and go huh that was\ngood enough that was okay I want to get\nto the end of my life and be like oh my\nGod that was wild that was crazy I've\ngot so many crazy memories I got so many\ncrazy stories so many things that I did\nso many ways that I screwed up so many\nways that I succeeded so many so many\nexperiences I don't want to be a person\nwho goes home and watches Netflix every\nsingle night I don't if you want to\nthat's cool but I'm assuming you're not\nthe type of person who is that because\nyou're here listening to this podcast\nstop settling for okay start pushing\nyourself demand greatness from yourself\ndemand the greatest life you can\npossibly\ncreate so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease do me a favor share it on your\nInstagram stories
