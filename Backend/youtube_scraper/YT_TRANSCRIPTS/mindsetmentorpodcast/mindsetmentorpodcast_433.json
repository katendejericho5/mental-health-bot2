    "transcript": "how do you actually create these\naffirmations well the first thing I'm\ngoing to give you four different best\npractices I guess you could say for\ncreating affirmations and using them the\nfirst one is to be very specific what it\nis that you want if you just say that\nyou want something and you're very\ngeneric you might get what you want the\nsecond thing is to bring in an emotional\ncharge try to bring in as much emotion\nas you possibly can the next one which\nis number three is consistent repetition\nonce again if you say something over and\nover and over and over and over again a\n100,000 times with the next year you're\nyou're going to start to believe it and\nthe last piece is as I said if you want\nto put gas in the fire combine it with\nvisualization so your brain can actually\nstart to visualize what it would look\nlike"
