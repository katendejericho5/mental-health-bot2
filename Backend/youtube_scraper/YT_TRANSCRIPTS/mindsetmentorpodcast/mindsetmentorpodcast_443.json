    "transcript": "got some older children and you also\njust had a new baby last year so\ncongratulations and I'm curious between\nTony 30 40 years ago as a father and now\nstepping into to fatherhood\num what is what do you feel like might\nhave been what did you do really well\nwhen you're like I definitely want to\nbring this in what are some things where\nyou're like all right I probably need to\nswitch that because there's a lot of\npeople listening that have children and\nthey're helping them create that\nidentity all of the time and so are\nthere shifts that you've made from you\nknow the new bay that you have you're\nlike I definitely got to not do this\nagain or I got to make sure that I do\nthis to make sure that you help the\nidentity come out the you know the most\npositive that you possibly can yes yes\nfor sure well first of all I have five\nkids and five grandkids give you an idea\nand I was uh 24 and had a 17 year old\nson instantly an 11 year old son and\nstill their daughter instantly a\nfive-year-old son and then in my own\nblood child on the way so I had quite a\nlearning my I married a woman that was\nuh 12 years my senior and so she'd been\nmarried twice in that kids and different\nfathers and I had brought them all into\nmy life so it was a huge part of my\ngrowth along own and so you know when\nyou're 25 and you're trying to change\nthe world and now you've got all these\nkids all of a sudden and they're all in\ndifferent stages of life I really had to\nlearn and grow and I'm proud of what\nI've done and I'm super proud of my kids\nthey're all adults today and you know as\nI said I have five grandkids so my\ngrandkids are all older than my my\nyoungest daughter now who's 20 months\nold\num the biggest thing that I learned I've\nlearned because of dealing with so many\nhuman beings is so many human beings in\nthe last decade or two we've shifted how\nwe raise our children every generation\nyou know tends to react to how they were\nraised so Baby Boomers you know were\nraised in an environment where their\nparents you know went to war and so\nforth and they came back and had all\nthese babies and they wanted to have a\nbetter life so they told them they were\ngreat send them to college gave them\neverything and made them very much\nnarcissistic not narcissistic not every\nperson but as a culture it was more\nabout me me me and maybe my mission out\nthere when I wasn't busy you know making\nlove having sex you know submission out\nhere larger than myself because they\ndidn't have to fight the war there's an\nold phrase that says Art For Art's Sake\nis this philosophy of the well-fed well\nyou didn't have they never had to face\nanything the Baby Boomers so they were\nfocused on their Spiritual Development\nbecause they had that privilege right\nand they judged their parents for not\nbeing open enough or wide enough\nwhatever the case may be right but then\nthose parents did not pay attention to\ntheir kids they were totally protected\ninitially they didn't protect their kids\nthey're busy out doing I think so the\nkids that grew up in the 80s and 90s\nwere latchkey kids not everyone but it\nwas a different generation they were\nraised to be pragmatic if you ask people\nand they've been asking this question\nsince the 60s in college what's more\nimportant for Life a philosophy of life\nthat makes you happy or pragmatic skills\nwould give you Financial Freedom and in\nthe 60s and 70s 82 plus always said\nphilosophy of life in the 80s and 90s\nand 2000s it was exactly reversed to\npragmatic skills so now those Lasky kids\nbecame the ones that overprotected their\nchildren because they weren't and so\ntheir children been raised baby on board\nsee in the 70s every movie about\nchildren was Rosemary's Baby Exorcist\nyou know then all of a sudden it's the\n80s and 90s it's three guys raising a\nbaby babies are beautiful baby on board\nthe entire philosophy changed to the\nentire focus is on the child and that\nhurt Intimate Relationships immensely\nbecause they put the kids first and then\nit also made these kids think they're\nthe most important thing on earth\nand so there's so many problems for\nyoung people today when I say young\npeople Millennials are now turning 40.\num you know they think they're old now\nor I think they're going to become old\nsoon uh and the Z Generations fighting\nthem about where they part their hair\nand all this stupid but the point\nof the matter is this group of people is\nreally not faced a real challenge"
