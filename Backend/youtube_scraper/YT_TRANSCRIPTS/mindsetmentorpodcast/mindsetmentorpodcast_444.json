    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout the meaning of life we're going to\nbe talking about life we're going to be\ntalking about death and I'm going to\nstart off with actually telling you my\nperspective of death and life as well\nand intertwine it with what we're going\nto go through today so um I remember the\nvery first person that I ever knew just\nso you know uh that passed away was my\nfather and I was lucky enough to have my\nfather pass away uh early and I say\nlucky it was the worst day of my life\nbut it was also the best day of my life\nthe reason why I say lucky and I have\nthe opinion of that is because I was\nable to experience one of my parents\ndying when I was younger at an early age\nand I remember specifically the day\nbefore uh my father's funeral uh they\nhad him in the casket and he was dressed\nup and we were in a small room that was\noff to the side and it was just enough\nroom for the casket and a couch and I\nremember I was on the far left of the\ncouch and my grandmother which was his\nmom was was right next to me uh my\nsister was next to her and my mom was\nnext to her and we were in there and we\nwere able to you know have a viewing\nbefore everybody else was able to see\nhim the next day I remember sitting\nthere in the room with the casket and\nrealizing that my father was gone and he\nhad so much potential he was so smart he\nhad so many dreams that he wanted he had\nso many experiences that he could have\nand none of those things were going to\nhappen anymore and of it was gone and it\nmakes me think of the the Les Brown\nquote that says the graveyard is the\nrichest place on Earth because it is\nhere that you'll find all the hopes and\ndreams that were never fulfilled the\nbooks that were never written the songs\nthat were never sung the inventions that\nwere never shared the cures that were\nnever discovered all because someone was\ntoo afraid and at\n15 I knew at that moment that I was\ngoing to make sure that that would not\nbe my life I was able to see oh my God\nthis is final like this is legitimate\nthis isn't a this isn't a a test life\nthat we get like this is final it is\nover and um 23 years or 23 days after my\nfather's passing uh was my sister's 21st\nbirthday and uh this back in 2001 and it\nwas her 21st birthday and I was driving\nthe car I was 15 years old I had my\npermit my mom was next to her my sister\nwas behind um my mom was next to me and\nthen my sister was behind my mom and I\nremember we were at a stoplight I\nremember the exact location we had just\ngot done uh at Olive Garden for my\nsister's birthday and we were sitting in\nSarasota at at a stoplight at Proctor 41\nand my mom said hey you know it's been a\nfew weeks since your father passed away\num what do you what are your thoughts\naround it what do you think about the\nwhole thing and I remember being 15\nyears old and turning to my mom and\nsaying I think that if Dad were to know\nhow much good is going to come from this\nhe would be okay with dying and that has\nbeen my mission ever since for 22 years\nsince that moment and it really comes\ndown to and the reason why I want to\nshare that story with you first off is\nto kind of give you my perspective of\nhow I see life but also my perspective\nas how I've seen death and there's a\nreally beautiful phrase that the stoics\nhave kind of they kind of lived by and\nthe phrase is momento Mori and momento\nMory basically translates to remember\nyou must die and to meditate on the fact\nthat you will die every single day and\nfor those of you guys that are watching\nthe video if you're listening audio you\ncan't see it but if you're watching on\nYouTube uh behind me right here is an\nactual skull not a real human skull but\nit's a a fake human skull with roses\ncoming out of it which is the symbol for\nmomentto Mori which is remember the\nbeauty that comes out of death because\nthere's Beauty in death and death is\nwhat gives meaning to life and so uh you\nknow we can sit there and we can say oh\nmy gosh that's so morbid to think that\nbut I think that by meditating on the\nfact that you're going to die and\nremember the fact that you're going to\ndie actually makes you give more purpose\nto your life it forces you to get up and\nactually do some with your life and\nif you've ever seen the movie Troy Brad\nPit uh says a really great quote that I\nlove and he says the gods Envy us and\nthey Envy us because we're mortal\nbecause at any moment it might be our\nlast and everything is more beautiful\nbecause we are\ndoomed hey if you're loving this episode\nplease do me a really quick favor give\nus a like down below and if you don't\nwant to miss any more episodes make sure\nyou hit that subscribe button down below\nso that you get notified every time we\nput up a new episode and so this is not\ngoing to be a doom and gloom episode or\nany of that this is an episode to really\ngive you perspective and hopefully\nchange your attitude in many ways\ntowards your life and to change your\nperspective on the life that you have\nthe life that you have had and the life\nthat is also in front of you and I\nremember when I was younger when I was\nin my 20s I didn't really understand\nwhen people would say life is a journey\nfocus on the journey you know there's a\na quote that says life is a journey not\na destination and I was like the\ndoes that mean like I just never really\nunderstood it and now that I'm 37 I kind\nof actually am starting to understand it\nand I'm starting to understand that\nthere's I when I was younger I always\nthought like there's a moment where I'm\ngoing to feel like ah I've arrived and\nI've come to realize now that I'm 37 and\nI'm like oh I don't think there's going\nto be a moment where I just arrive\nthere's never a Finish Line that we get\nto in life there's no finish to\nimproving yourself there's no finish to\num personal development Journey there's\nno destination that you get to and uh\nthe condition of a human I think is to\nLose Yourself and then find yourself and\nlose yourself and find yourself 40 50\n100 times a day to get lost and to get\nlost again and to find yourself\nthroughout the entire process it could\nbe a thousand times a day but I don't\nthink there's any moment where we're\njust like I've made it there's no\ndestination that we're working to get\ntowards because eventually if you're\nlike I like if your destination is I\nwant to be a millionaire well once you\nmake a million dollars what's\nnext it was not about the destination of\ngetting to becoming a millionaire was\nthe process the Journey of building\nyourself into the person who can\neventually acquire that money or to be\nable to have the skills to be worth um\nbeing paid that amount of money or\nwhatever it might be and the older that\nI get the more that I'm finally\nunderstanding oh life is a journey there\nis no place to go there is no place to\nbe the only place that there is to be is\nliterally right now and then\ntomorrow is just another right now and\nfor the longest time in my life I was\nhustling to be somewhere and it's hard\nfor me to think over the past 37 years\nhow much of my life I was not present to\nmy life because of the fact I was\nthinking about the thing that was\nsupposed to be next what what's the next\nthing that I need to get what's the next\nMountain that I need to climb what's the\nnext thing that I want to buy what's the\nnext place that I want to travel to and\nI was just thinking about the next thing\nthe next thing the next thing but I was\never actually fully present here in this\nmoment and so I was looking so far into\nthe distance telling myself that where I\nwasn't wasn't good enough and I missed\nwhat was actually around me have you\never done that before where you're\nconstantly thinking about the future you\nsit down and meditate and instead of\nbeing present you're struggling at\nmeditation because you keep thinking\nabout all the that you have to do\nlater on today and tomorrow and the next\nday versus actually just sitting and\nenjoying the moment and being present\nwith being in this human\nexistence and I didn't really stop and\nsmell the roses because I was always\nfocusing on what the next thing was I\nhad a funny speaking of uh smelling the\nRoses I had a funny experience we were\nin Santa Barbara about three weeks ago\nand I was it was the sunrise was coming\nup and I was taking bear for a walk and\nI was walking by this set of roses and I\nwas like oh my God they smell so good\nand like I'm talking about like\nridiculously good there were these white\nroses and I never smelled roses so\npotent and I sat there for like a good\nfive or 10 minutes just smelling the\nroses and I was like oh I'm literally\nstopping to smell the roses as the\nsunrise in Santa Barbara and I was like\nholy this is actually what we're\nsupposed to be doing and it was funny\nbecause instead of being like okay well\nI've got to take bear to do the next\nthing and then I've got to get up and\nI've got to have my coffee and then I\nhave a team call and I have to do this\nthing and I have a zoom and I have to\nmeet with this person person it was like\nI was stopping for a few minutes I was\nsmelling the roses and I was going oh my\nGod these roses do smell amazing I sat\nthere for a while and smelled the roses\nand it smelled so good I brought one\nback with me so I could smell it\nthroughout the day and so I was on team\ncalls on zoom and they would see me with\na white rose up to my nose and I was\njust smelling it and I was like this is\nthis is kind of the journey is to to be\npresent to stop and smell the roses and\none thing that I think is really\nimportant for being present um and thing\nthat I've been trying to make myself do\nmore and more often uh if you've ever\nbeen on a zoom call with me that I've\nrun for you know mindset Mentor\nUniversity and all that stuff we always\nstart with a breathing exercise the\nreason why is because I'm trying to get\nmyself into my body more often and to\nnotice my senses because the thing that\nI've noticed about myself and I noticed\nabout a lot of people is that our minds\nare always somewhere else they're always\nin the future they're always in the past\nthey're always think about the next\nthing that we have to do but my body is\nalways here\nlike my body is never somewhere else but\nthis present moment and I notice in\nmyself my lack of presence 10 or 15\ntimes a day so I bring my awareness back\nto my body so that I can experience the\nmoment in this moment so I start to\nfocus on what I can see I start to try\nto focus on what it is that I can hear I\ntry to focus on what I can feel and what\nit feels like to be in my body and my\nclothes on my skin and the temperature\nof the room I try to focus on what I can\nsmell I try to focus on what I can taste\nand that's really bringing me back to\nthe only thing that we really truly have\nwhich right now is this present moment\nand life at its simplest form is really\nthis it is you are born you have a\nsensory set of experiences and you die\nthat is what life is whether you get 17\nyears whether you get 117 years you're\nborn you have a sensory set of\nexperiences you you see things you hear\nthings you taste things you smell things\nall of that and then you die but how you\nchoose to interpret those experiences\nwill dictate the quality of your\nlife but how many of us are so focused\non the next thing that we miss this\nthing like we miss the present moment I\ndon't know if you've ever been in the\nroom when somebody passes away it is a\nextremely humbling experience it is a\nbeautiful experience it is a\nheart-wrenching experience but it's a\nit's beautiful and humbling at the same\ntime I was in the room when my\ngrandfather passed away and I remember\nthinking to myself his body is still\nthere but my grandfather is gone the\nsoul that was in him the energy that was\nhim was gone and I think about that\nreally often is I don't want to get to\nthe end of my life and think damn it\nlike I wasn't really here I was always\nsomewhere else in my mind I wasn't\nreally here and I mean like really here\nin this moment not focusing on the next\naccomplishment not trying to work harder\nto buy the next thing because you know\nyou can't take any of these things with\nyou I don't know if you've ever had\nsomeone close to you die and then you\nneed to go to their house and clean out\ntheir house but it really puts a lot of\nthings into perspective because all\nyou're doing is you know imagine\ncollecting toys and collecting things\nyour whole life and then when you're die\nwhen you die they're just there when you\ndie someone else has to clean up all of\nyour and what's the point of all of\nthose things right so then it brings us\nback to the original question of how we\nstarted this and the title of this this\nepisode which is what is the meaning of\nlife what is the meaning of life the\nmeaning of life is not to it's it's not\nwhat you look like it's not all the toys\nthat you have it's not how much money\nyou have in your bank account it's not\nhow big your house is it's not all of\nthe accomplishments that you have I'll\ngive you my meaning of life but before I\ndo let me tell you this I don't know\nwhat the I'm talking about I'm just\nanother human another flawed individual\nthat's just trying to figure things out\nI'm just another bumbling idiot trying\nto make sense of all of it so if you\nchoose to believe in something different\nI fully respect that I fully respect you\nbelieve anything that you want to so I'm\ngoing to give you what I think my\nmeaning of life is my meaning of life\nthe meaning of life is\nlife that's it we're trying to over\ncomplicate this thing the meaning of\nlife is life it is to experience\neverything to feel to feel happiness to\nfeel sadness to feel love joy pain anger\nto be with your friends to travel to\nwatch a sunset to live like to really\n live but how often do we sit\nthere and we think that there's some\nother meaning or try to figure out if we\ncan find more meaning in our work or\nfind more meaning in buying things or\nfind more things in having something\nelse or finding another accomplishment\nhow often are we not here like here in\nthis moment in our bodies in this\npresent moment but we're off in our mind\nsomewhere\nelse when the point is to be here now\nwhich is as romdas would say it because\nit's pretty crazy if you actually think\nabout it right like if you actually take\na step back and think about life like\none of the things that I love to do and\nit terrifies my wife sometimes is I love\nto watch videos of how small we are in\nthis universe because I really think it\ngives it gives a lot of perspective and\nthe reason why it terrifies my wife is\nbecause she's like oh my God it's it's\nso big it's I can't even comprehend it\nand I was like yeah but that's what's so\namazing is because it shows you that\nnothing actually matters and if nothing\nmatters that means that we could put\nmeaning to anything that we want to we\ncan do all of these things if nothing if\nwe're on this huge this huge universe\nand this tiny little speck of dirt in in\nthis huge Universe people judging you\ndoesn't matter but there's two ways you\ncan look at life and this is a Albert\nEinstein quote that I love he says\nthere's two ways to look at life one as\nthough nothing is a miracle and the\nother as if everything is a miracle and\nwhen you actually start to look at the\nuniverse you start to look at the world\nthat we live in you start to realize\nthat all of this around us is a miracle\nlike we live on a piece of dirt but it\nis the most beautiful piece of dirt that\nwe know of right if you think about\nother planets like Mercury what would it\nbe like to live on Mercury or Venus or\nMars all of them they don't look really\nas beautiful as this one with all the\nanimals and all of the trees and all of\nthe humans and the blue skies and the\nclouds like we're on the best planet in\nour solar system it's like the Disney\nWorld of our solar system right and you\nlook at it in the Earth this tiny little\nspeck that we live on and we're a tiny\nlittle speck on a tiny little speck this\nEarth is spinning a th mph and it's\norbiting the Sun at 67,000 mph and we're\nmoving through a solar system our solar\nsystem is you moving through the\nuniverse at\n448,000 miles per hour and we're in a\ngalaxy that has 100 billion\nstars and in a universe that has two\ntrillion\ngalaxies we live in a galaxy that has\n100 billion stars and there are over 2\ntrillion galaxies like do you fully\nunderstand this it is in insane our\nbrains cannot comprehend the scale of\nall of this and we're so consumed with\nwanting to get a raise we're so consumed\nabout our next post going viral we're\ncons so consumed with wanting to make\nmore money so we can buy the next thing\nso that we can impress people that don't\ncare about the stuff that you have\nbecause they're too busy thinking about\nthemselves like we have to wake\nup your life is here it's not somewhere\nelse it's not in the\nfuture the point of life is to\nexperience life to be in the present\nmoment to be as present as we possibly\ncan it's not in the future it's now so\nit's time to experience it and to be\npresent and to let go of trying to\ncontrol everything let go of trying to\nmake sure that you control every little\nsingle thing around you let go of saying\noh I'll be happy when do dot dot I'm not\nhappy now I'll be happy when I get that\nraise I'll be happy when I get get that\nhouse I'll be happy when I finally get\ninto a\nrelationship no you won't happiness is\nnot when I get that thing happiness is a\nchoice I know people who have a ton of\nstuff I know people worth billions of\ndollars that are miserable I've\nseen people in third world countries\nthat have nothing that are the happiest\npeople I've ever seen so I'll be I'll be\nhappy when dot dot dot doesn't make any\nsense it's a choice that you decide to\nmake in the\nmoment there is nowhere else to go but\nhere and now and to\nexperience and so what I really want you\nto understand through this episode is\nthat when you look at life life is the\ngift stop searching for something else\nbecause in this moment you already have\neverything that you're searching for\nstop trying to get the next thing and\nstart trying to try start trying to be\nhere now in this moment so that you can\nget all of the gifts of the present\nmoment because the meaning of your life\nis to simply just experience\nlife and that's it\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in it Rob dial Jr\nrobd i a l Jr and with that I'm going to\nleave you the same way I leave you every\nsingle episode make it your mission to\nmake someone else's day better I\nappreciate you and I hope that you have\nan amazing day"
