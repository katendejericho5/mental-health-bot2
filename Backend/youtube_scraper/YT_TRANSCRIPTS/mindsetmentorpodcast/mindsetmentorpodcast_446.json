    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to be more confident and we're\ngoing to talk about the process of\nMastery I think that one of the\nbeautiful things about being a human is\nthat we can decide what we want to\nmaster in my life in my life but also\nyour life as well I guess I have a\ntattoo that's on my wrist I only have\ntwo tattoos but the tattoo that's on my\nwrist people always ask me on Instagram\nwhen they see it what's that tattoo on\nyour wrist it is a Roman numeral x with\na line above it which is the Roman\nnumeral for 10,000 and uh the reason why\nI have this tattoo is because I love the\nidea of the 10,000 hour rule which means\nthat if you put 10,000 hours into\ndeliberate practice at something it\nusually takes around that give or take\nyou know some hours to master something\nand I love that because I love the idea\nof mastering myself I love the idea of\nbeing a human in deciding that we just\nwant to be good at something and as long\nas we put in the work we can become good\nat it but that requires us to put in the\nwork so we're going to be talking about\nconfidence and how to become more\nconfident with that but we're also going\nto be talking about something that's\ncalled competence if you've never used\nthe word competence it basically is uh\nwhat it means a definition is having the\nnecessary ability or knowledge or skill\nto do something successfully and we're\ngoing to dive into something called the\nconfidence competence Loop which\nbasically means that you become more\nconfident as you become more competent\nat something but you also become more\ncompetent\nat something as you get more confidence\naround that thing so you look at that\nand that's really awesome I can become\nmore confident at something as my\nconfidence gets better with it but also\nI become more confident with something\nbecause I have more confidence which\nallows me to take more action the\nchallenge in this situation though is\nwhen you're brand new at starter\nstarting something you are neither one\nof those things right you are not\nconfident that you can do it and you are\nalso not competent in the fact of\nactually doing it and so it kind of\nturns into like the Chicken and the Egg\nsituation where it's like which one\ncomes first does the competence come\nfirst or does the confidence comes first\nand the answer to that is if you're\nconfident how do you become confident\nand if you're confident if you're if\nyou're not confident excuse me how do\nyou become confident if you're not com\ncompetent how do you become confident\nand so the answer to that is neither one\nof them comes first they happen together\nat the same time what must come first is\nsome form of action some form of action\nthat you need to take and usually what\nhappens to us is that the moment when we\ndecide to do something that we've never\ndone before try to improve at something\nthat we're not that good at we start to\nrealize okay I'm not really confident\nthat I can do this and as I look at my\nskills I'm not really competent at this\nthing so who the hell am I to think that\nI could do this and this is usually\nwhere the impostor syndrome comes in and\nwe start thinking to oursel like I want\nto do this thing but I'm not good enough\nI'll never succeed at this I don't know\nwhat the hell I'm doing I'm not I don't\nfeel confident in myself and I don't\nfeel I don't feel really confident in my\nskills and this is the reason why is\nbecause you have to sit there and you\nhave to realize I don't have confidence\nI don't have competence but this is\nsomething that I want to get better at\nand you know I'll give you a really good\nexample like when I decided to become a\npodcaster in 2015 I had the idea to\nstart the podcast in January of\n2015 but I had hardcore imposture\nsyndrome and the reason why I had\nimposture syndr is I thought to myself\nI'm 29 years old I'm been working on\nmyself for about 10 years at this point\nbut why would somebody listen to me when\nthey can listen to Tony Robbins because\nTony robbins's been doing this for like\n40 years at this point so I'm like would\nthey listen to somebody who's never\npodcasted barely barely been out there\nteaching this stuff or would they just\nlisten to somebody who's kind of a\nmaster at this thing nobody's going to\nwant want to listen to me and I thought\nthis for a really long time I wasn't a\nconfident podcaster before my first\nepisode I also wasn't a confident\npodcaster before I started and so I had\nthe idea to start the podcast in January\nof 2015 and I waited 8 months of ideas\nof wanting to do it of thinking to do it\nbefore I finally put on my first episode\nI think my first episode was August 21st\nof\n2015 it took me eight months because I\ndid not believe in myself and I did not\nbelieve in my abilities I was not\ncompetent and I was not confident and so\nwhen you start to think about the\nimpostor syndrome I have something I\nreally want to share with you I think is\nimportant I had uh Mel Robbins on the\npodcast that episode's going to be\ncoming out in the next few months and we\nwere talking about the impostor syndrome\nas a couple weeks ago when I was over in\nLA and one thing that she said I think\nwas really good and she has a a a very\nkeen way of saying things very simply\nbut very direct and she said stop\ncalling yourself an impostor and start\ncalling yourself a\nbeginner hey if you're loving this\nepisode on how to be more confident\nplease do me a favor give us a like down\nbelow also make sure that you subscribe\nso that every time we have a new episode\nyou get notified so you don't miss any\nmore episodes I was like that's such\nit's it's so simple but it's so damn\ntrue because we think to ourselves I'll\nnever be this because I'm not good\nenough but if we just say I'm a beginner\nand we realize that beginners usually\nsuck at things until they become better\nthen we go oh okay well I can suck at\nthis thing for a little while because\nwhen you're beginner you can frame\nyourself as a beginner I'm supposed to\nmess up I'm not supposed to be good at\nthis and I'll give you a really good\nexample of something that's been\nhappening in my life recently so Lauren\nmy wife decided she wants to start\nplaying tennis she's never played tennis\nbefore she's never played any sport\nwhere you hit any balls or anything like\nthat and so she had her first lesson\nwhen we were out in Santa Barbara a few\nweeks ago and uh I I hired a guy to come\nout and teach her for an hour and she\nmissed if I'm being honest like 75% of\nthe ball balls like I'm talking about\nthe ball would come at her and she would\ntry to hit it and she would completely\nmiss the ball and when she did hit the\nball she would launch it into another\ncourt she would launch it into a\ndifferent direction and and like 5% of\nthem of the balls that that she was\ntrying to hit actually landed in the\nother side of the court and so she did\nthis and then she was like man that was\na lot of fun I can't wait to do it again\nbecause she knew she was a beginner she\nwasn't comparing herself to like any of\nthe professionals she wasn't going oh my\ngosh well I suck because look at Serena\nWilliams she's so much better than me\nLauren was thinking to herself in her\nhead I don't know what the hell I'm\ndoing I'm a beginner so I should suck at\nthis and we should suck at things when\nwe're brand new at them right and so\nwhat happened was then you know a few\ndays ago we went to a tennis court and\nwe practiced and I had her to literally\njust drop a ball and hit the ball and\ndrop a ball and hit the ball and it was\ncrazy because she did so much better at\nhitting the ball than she did in her\nfirst lesson and she became more\nconfident in her abilities as she\nstarted to see little tiny bits of\nimprovement so as her competence to do\nit got a little bit better she doesn't\nthink she's a pro at this point\nobviously but she was able to see oh my\ngosh I'm I'm not just missing the balls\nanymore as much as I was I'm not\nlaunching it into other courts I still\nam a little bit but it's starting to go\nover the net onto the other side as she\nstarted to get a little bit more\ncompetent she started to get more\nconfidence and so she became so much\nbetter and it gives her more excitement\nto show up because she can see herself\ngetting better versus not even hopping\non the court and saying oh I'm just not\ngoing to be good at this thing and as\nshe continues to keep showing up and\nstart getting a little bit better she's\ngoing to get more confidence and as she\ncontinues to keep showing up and getting\na little more better she's going to get\nmore confident and this is what makes\nyou continue to keep showing up when you\nframe yourself as a beginner and you\nactually say I'm not going to be perfect\nat this and I give myself permission to\nsuck that's when it you really start to\nbecome better and you you Embrace being\na beginner which we'll talk a little bit\nmore about but when you keep showing up\nyou keep improving and as you keep\nimproving you start getting more\nconfident in your abilities and there's\nactually a lot of studies on this of the\nthe competence competent Loop and\nthere's a study done in 1977 by uh\nAlbert bandura on self-efficacy and what\nhe found was that individuals with\nhigher competence you know the people\nwho who believe that they can perform\nwell are more likely to view difficult\ntasks as something that that is is\nsomething that they should tackle so\nthat they can Master it rather than\nsomething that should be avoided so as\nwe start to to get a little bit more\nconfident and get a little bit more\nconfidence we start to actually tackle\nthe harder things versus trying to avoid\nthose things you know when we don't view\nit as something that that I'm a beginner\nand I'm trying to get better at and we\ndon't view it that way we tend to avoid\nwhat is difficult and so let me give you\nguys just a couple tips on how to\nactually build your confidence and your\ncompetence as well the first one that\nI'll give you is something called\ndeliberate practice deliberate practice\nis huge I first heard about deliberate\npractice in a book that I read probably\nseven or eight years ago uh that was\ncalled Talent is overrated and the\nphrase deliberate practice was created\nby a psychologist named Anders Ericson\nand he coined the term deliberate\npractice while he was researching how\npeople become experts at something and\nwhile studying all of these different\nexperts in different fields such as\npeople that were masters in science but\npeople that were also Masters at music\nor people that were Masters at a sport\nwhen he was studying these experts from\nall of these different fields he was\nable to completely dismantle the myth\nthat experts have this innate Talent\nbuilt into them they don't have the\ntalent that's actually built into them\nwhat they have is the they've been\nshowing up over and over and over and\nover and over again and they've been\nusing deliberate practice and so\ndeliberate practice is not just about\nshowing up and being very repetitive\nit's about being focused and extremely\nintentional on the repetition of\nimproving at one specific thing\nsomething specific so it's the\ndifference between like mindlessly\nplaying a song on the guitar uh versus\nmeticulously working on something like a\na challenging Solo or a challenging\nchord transition until you have that\npart mastered and so it's not about\nplaying the entire song Perfectly and\nand just being able to go from start to\nfinish it's about hey how can I take the\nnext two bars of Music and play them to\nthe best of my abilities and try to\nmaster it and the reason why deliberate\npractice works is because it pushes you\nslightly beyond your comfort zone and\nwhen you're slightly beyond your comfort\nzone it shows you and ensures basically\nthat you're always learning and that\nyou're always growing and the key to\nthis with deliberate practice is that\nyou should be if you're playing guitar\nyou should be playing something that you\ncan play to your abilities but is a\nlittle bit outside of your abilities so\nyou should be messing up when you're\ntrying to get better at something with\ndeliberate practice approximately 15 to\n20% of the time it's not about sitting\ndown and and being like okay this is I\ncan play this piece of music it's about\nhey I'm going to play something that's a\nlittle bit outside of my abilities and\nI'm going to focus on the parts where I\nmess up and I'm going to focus on them\nand play them over and over and over\nagain until I don't mess up anymore and\nthis this kind of practice is often\nreally challenging and tends to be very\nuncomfortable for people but this is the\nreal space where your growth actually\nstarts to occur and as you become a\nlittle bit you start to overcome a\nlittle bit of the challenges and you\nstart to get better at playing guitar\nand your skills start to grow your\nconfidence in playing the guitar gets\nbetter and so for me like I use podcast\nas an example but also another example I\ncan think of off top of my head is like\nwhen I first started public speaking I\nwas terrified and did not want to hop on\nstage but the company that I worked for\njust kind of threw you into the fire and\nsaid go for it go screw it SC it up and\nthey did it over and over and over and\nover and over again and as I started to\ndo it I noticed I was getting a little\nbit better and a little bit better and a\nlittle bit better and so people always\nask like what's the key to being good at\npublic speaking I'm like just continue\nto do public speaking and eventually\nstart to say oh when I when I emphasize\nthis word people tend to get it oh I I\nhave need more voice inflection when I\nspeak versus just speaking very monotone\nwhenever I'm in front of a bunch of\npeople and so really what it comes down\nto is realizing that you continue to\nkeep showing up you start getting better\nand as you start getting better you\nstart getting more confident but you\ncan't have one without the other and so\nhow you want to actually use this and\nimplement it is to figure out something\nthat you want to get good at figure out\na specific thing that you want to get\ngood at and so it could be you know\ntennis it could be music it could be you\nknow understanding the human brain\nwhatever it might be what you want to do\nis identify a specific area that you\nwant to get better good at and then\nfigure out something that's in there\nthat's a specific skill set that needs\nto improve and then what you do is you\nbreak it down into smaller more\nmanageable tasks so instead of saying I\nwant to learn the entire um time Pink\nFloyd solo you say I want to learn these\ntwo bars and I want to make these two\nbars of Music the best that they can\npossibly be and you focus on just those\ntwo bars until you have those two bars\ndown then you can go to the next two\nbars and so you take something that's\nlonger and you break it down into\nsmaller more manageable tasks and then\nwhat's really important is if if you\nreally want to improve exponentially\nwhile you're doing deliberate practice\nsee if you can hire a mentor or have\nsomebody who's a friend that's better\nthan you at this thing they can help you\nget a little bit better because as you\nstart to get better at this um if you\nhave somebody else that's around you\nthat is way outside of your skill set in\nway better they can help shorten your\nlearning curve and so like an example\nlike I'm not great at tennis I'm pretty\ngood at it I used to play with my\ngrandparents when I was younger and so I\nknow how to hit a tennis ball I'm pretty\ngood at uh at pickle ball I played\nbaseball for a long time when I was\nyounger so I can hit a ball and and play\nright when I was working with Lauren and\nwe were just trying to get a little bit\nbetter we never tried any backhands what\nwe tried we never I never even hit any\nballs to her to from across the other\nside of the Court we all I did was I\njust had her drop a ball and hit it and\ndrop a ball and hit it and drop a ball\nand hit it and hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds and hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds of times right and she started\ngetting a little bit better and she\nstarted getting a little bit better it\nwas interesting because it wasn't like\nshe was actually trying specific things\nbut it was almost like she would hit a\nball and now it would go way left and\nshe would her brain would kind of\nrecalibrate and say okay that went too\nfar left she would hit another one and\nthen it would go too far right and her\nbrain would recalibrate and then she\nstarted hitting them and they were going\ndirectly straight over and she was she\nwasn't she still to this day hasn't even\ntried a backhand after those two\nsessions but she's starting to get a\nlittle bit more confident in her\nabilities to actually hit it over the\nnet and get it into the court and she's\nalso getting more confident as she's\nstarting to see the ball flying to the\nother side of the court and as you get\nbetter it's really important that you\nremind yourself that you're getting\nbetter and so for me it was really\nimportant to her on the ride home to\ngive her positive affirmations in case\nshe wasn't noticing how much better\nshe's gotten and so for me I was like oh\nmy God Lauren you were you were so much\nbetter this time than last time and she\ngoes oh really and I was like yeah like\nthink about how many balls you missed\nlast time you were in your first session\nand how they were launching into other\nsides of the Court like by the time we\nleft almost every ball that you were\nhitting was literally going over to the\nother side of the Court like you're\nactually getting better and she's like\nthat's amazing and she started getting a\nlittle bit more confident in herself\nwhat happens now she wants to keep\nshowing up right so this is really\nimportant to make sure that you\nunderstand the the practice of\ndeliberate practice and how to do it\ncorrectly you should be failing 15 to\n20% of the time uh while you're doing\nsomething so that's the first tip to\nbeing more confident and more having\nmore confidence as well the second tip\nis so start to visualize your success\nusing visualization creating the mental\nimage of what you want to happen how you\nwant it to feel and what do you want it\nto look like and it's a a technique that\nthat it's amazing to me the amount of\nsuccessful athletes that are coming out\nand talking about how much they've been\nvisualizing their entire life like I I\nwas watching the Arnold\nSchwarzenegger um documentary that just\ncame out I think it was on Netflix and\nhe was talking about when he was a kid\nwhen he was in Austria he was a teenager\nhe's like 13 years old and he would\nprint out or not print out cuz I guess\nthey didn't probably have printers back\nthen but he would rip out pictures of\nthese guys in magazines that were these\nbodybuilders and he would put him up on\nhis wall right above his bed and every\nnight he would sit down and he would\nvisualize himself becoming a bodybuilder\nbecoming the number one bodybuilder in\nthe world and what happened he\nvisualizes so much it ended up happening\nand the reason why the visualization\nprocess works is because it starts to\nprime your brain for Success when you\nrepeatedly imagine a successful outcome\nyou're basically training your brain to\nbelieve that it's possible the belief is\nthe thing that allows you to start\ntaking some action you could say yeah\nI'm not confident in myself I don't know\nwhat I'm doing but I believe that I can\nget better at it and it's it's almost\nlike brainwashing yourself into finally\nbelieving in yourself versus constantly\nbelieving that you can't do something\nand that belief is what makes you more\nconf uh confident and it makes you more\nmore confident that hey I'm not good\nright now but I can get better at it and\nso I'm going to at least try and then\nyou try and you get a little bit better\nand you notice your confidence getting a\nlittle bit better and so visualization\nhas been proven to help reduce the\nanxiety around starting something new or\ntrying something that you've never done\nbefore and it also tends to increase\nyour focus because you actually become\nmore\nconfident through your visualization\nprocess and so it's real simple just set\naside a few minutes every day and just\nclose your eyes and try to vividly\nimagine yourself successfully executing\nthat thing that you want to do whether\nit's tennis whether it's playing guitar\nwhether it's doing the presentation that\nyou want to do being on stage in front\nof a thousand people you just imagine\nyourself doing it and because of the\nfact that your brain and your body don't\nknow the difference between what's\nactually truly happening in reality and\nsomething that you're visualizing you're\nbecoming more confident because you're\nactually your brain and body actually\nthink that it's something that you're\ndoing and so really you just try to\nimmerse yourself into what it would be\nlike to be in that situation to be where\nyou want to be and to succeed so that's\ntip number two and then tip number three\nwhich I kind of mentioned in the\nbeginning is to just have a beginner's\nmindset like just think about life as\nbeing a beginner when you start try to\ntry to go into doing something and\nreally Rel like get rid of all of your\npreconceptions around it and just go in\nin it like a child just open and eager\nand just wanting to learn and have fun\nthe reason why the beginner's mindset\nworks is because you're opening yourself\nup to to new experiences and learning\nand you're not just judging yourself for\nwhen you fail because you're going to\nfail anyways and it really helps you\napproach challenges because you don't\nhave to think about all of the the past\nfailures in your life or the pressure of\ntrying to become perfect at it you're\njust being curious you're just falling\nin love with the learning just having\nfun more than anything else because\nwhenever you approach a task you can\nlook at it and you can say oh my God I\ndon't know if I could do this because\nthere's so many things that I failed in\nthe past or you could say you know what\nI'm new I don't know what the I'm\ndoing but I'm just going to go and do it\nanyways and I'm just going to just try\nto be like a child just try to have fun\ntry to have no preconceptions around\nthis no judgments around it any of that\nstuff I'm just going to be curious I'm\ngoing to ask questions I'm going to be\nopen to to being a sponge to New\nPerspectives to learning new methods and\nand then be open to just messing up over\nand over and over again because it's\nreally important to remind yourself\nwhenever you're starting something new\nyou're going to suck at it one of my\nfavorite phrases that I came up with is\n it up and figure it out like just\nbe okay with just everything up\nfiguring out where you did and then just\ngetting a little bit better because\nthat's what life comes down to is if\nyou're not going to allow yourself to be\na beginner you're never going to be a\nmaster I think there's a phrase that\nsays if you won't allow yourself to be a\nfoolish beginner you'll never be a\ngraceful Master if you don't allow\nyourself to be a foolish beginner and to\nmess up everything you will never be a\ngraceful master messing up is the\nprocess of becoming better at something\nand so really what it comes down to is\nif you want to be start becoming\nconfident at something you have to build\nyour confidence in it but in order to\nbuild your confidence in it you also\nhave to start being a little bit more\nconfident in it and what it comes down\nto is allowing yourself to be new to be\na beginner don't tell yourself you're an\nimposter don't judge yourself compared\nto somebody else compare yourself to who\nyou were yesterday and continue to\nremind yourself of the incremental\nimprovements which H happen to help you\nget a little bit more confident which\nmakes you show up again and as you show\nup again you try something new and try a\nlittle bit outside of your comfort zone\nand you get a little bit more confident\nand this Loop happens over and over and\nover again and really what it comes down\nto is you just deciding that you want to\nseek Mastery at something in your life\nwhich is one of the most amazing Parts\nabout being a human is that you can\nMaster anything that you want to master\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your
