    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to be talking about\nthe strategy to help you get yourself\nout of your anxious thinking whenever\nyou find yourself ruminating or stuck in\na loop of anxious thoughts uh this is a\nstrategy that I've used with many of my\nclients and in fact the reason why I'm\ntalking about it today is because it's a\nstrategy I literally had to use for\nmyself last night uh so last night\naround 3 3:30ish my wife woke up she\nwent to the bathroom when she went to\nthe bathroom she accidentally woke up me\nup and uh I could not fall back asleep I\nhad one thought and then another thought\nanother thought another thought another\nthought another thought and I had all\nthese thoughts and um you know a lot of\nthem are business and once I get into\nbusiness I start thinking about oh my\ngosh we got to do this and this thing's\ncoming up and I started thinking about\nother stuff and so you know even though\nI am the the the mindset Mentor there's\nthere's no way I will ever get rid of\nanxious thoughts popping up or stressful\nthoughts popping up at some point in\ntime and to be honest with you I was up\nfor about an hour and a half left last\nnight just sitting in my bed and then I\nwas like it's not working my brain just\nis not turning off I don't know if\nyou've ever been in that situation\nbefore where you're like how in the hell\ncan I get my brain to turn off because I\nhad so many thoughts and what's\ninteresting about humans is that when we\nhave a thought that thought is like\nspread out it's like a mind map when you\nhave just like one thought and then it\nspreads out and there's all these other\nthoughts that could possibly come up and\nso one thought turns into another turns\ninto another and so I had to get out of\nbed and I went and got my journal and I\nwas like okay there's a lot of stuff\nthat's happening in my hair right now\nthere's a lot of stuff happening in my\nlife right now and that's just the way\nthat life is and I've got a lot of stuff\ncoming up I'm really busy right now and\nclearly my brain is stuck in this Loop\nright now and it's not allowing me to go\nto sleep and so what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to get out of bed I'm going to\ngo grab my journal I'm going to go to\nliving room and I'm going to start to\nwork through what's going on in my head\nand um I have worked with many people\nwho have anxious anxious thoughtss\nanxious feelings and this is one of the\nbest strategies that I have found and\nit's a strategy that I work on for\nmyself so the first thing that's really\nimportant is awareness I was aware that\nI had some anxious thoughts that were\ncoming into my head and one of the\nthings that that's really important\nabout having anxiety or having anxious\nthoughts that come into your head is\nit's not a chemical imbalance which is\ngood because if it's not a chemical\nimbalance you're not stuck with it it\nmeans it comes from your thoughts and\nyou can work through your thoughts it's\nsomething that you can work out for\nyourself it's a pattern that usually\ncomes into a loop and I noticed the loop\nhappening last night when I was sitting\nthere for an hour and a half I noticed\nthe loop where it was like I would start\nat the top and then I would go back down\nagain I would start at the top and I go\nback and it's just a loop of these\nthoughts coming through and so the first\nthing that's the most important is\nreally the awareness what are the\nthoughts that are going through my head\nsometimes you guys might have thoughts\nabout oh my gosh I've got so much to do\ntomorrow I've got to go to work and I've\ngot to take the kids to school and I've\ngot to then pick up Johnny and take them\nto soccer sometimes those anxious\nthoughts can be oh my gosh I've got a\npresentation tomorrow and I don't know\nif I'm going to have it done before\npresentation time sometimes those\nanxious thoughts are I don't know if I'm\ngoing to be play my be able to pay my\ndamn bills this this month and so I've\nworked with many people who have um\nanxiety I've worked with some people who\nhave have had so much anxiety that they\ncan't leave the house like crippling\nanxiety and the the important thing I\nwant you to realize with your thoughts\nis that our thoughts are so ridiculously\ncomplex and you have your thoughts in\nyour head you have every emotion you\nhave you have all of your\nprogrammingsoftware and so when your\nthoughts are in your head and you try to\nwork them out in your head as I was for\nyou know a good hour and a half last\nnight usually doesn't get you anywhere\nit's usually like trying to work your\nthoughts out in your head is a lot like\ntrying to grab water it's it's hard to\ngrab water you might grab a couple drops\nbut you're not grabbing the entire bit\nof water right and so it's really\nimportant to to work through them if you\ncan talk to somebody I recommend talking\nto somebody as well and you know whether\nthat's a therapist whether that's a\nfriend whether that's a a spouse talking\nto someone saying like hey there's like\ndon't wake your husband up and be like\nhey I have anxious thought anxious\nthoughts let me tell about my anxious\nthoughts but if you notice that you're\nbeing you've been really anxious maybe\nbeen on a high stress level for the day\nand you come home just talk to your\nspouse if you can or talk to your call\nyour your sister up on the way home or\ncall your mom or talk to somebody about\nit talk to your therapist if you have\none and saying Hey listen I'm noticing\nmyself in this thought pattern can I\njust talk it out with you I don't need\nyou to solve any of my problem problems\nyou can help me if and if you want their\nhelp ask for their help but if you just\nwant to say hey I just can I just tell\nyou this and you can just let me know\nwhat you're seeing maybe they'll be able\nto actually help you see patterns in\nyour thoughts that you are not able to\nsee a lot of times another person in\ntalking to another person is like a\nmirror for you where sometimes just\nspeaking it out loud starts to make the\nconnections sometimes somebody else\nhearing this and knowing you they can\nalso help you make the connection as\nwell so it can be really important to to\ntalk to someone someone that you trust\nsomeone that loves you but I know some\nof you guys don't want to talk to\nsomeone and the reason why you don't\nwant to talk to someone is because you\ndon't want to be judged or because your\nanxious thoughts are around that person\nand so if you can't talk to someone can\nyou talk to your can you talk to someone\non a piece of paper and that person\nwould be you because when you're trying\nto fight it in your head and you're\ntrying to figure it out it's like trying\nto fight someone in the dark it's really\nhard to figure out where they are and so\nhere's what I did last night night I got\nup and I was like all right damn it\nlooks like my brain doesn't want to turn\noff so I wrote wrote down a bunch of\nquestions the questions were what am I\nfeeling anxious about and I wrote down\nwhat are the thoughts that that are\nmaking me anxious right now then I\nstarted writing down what's the worst\nthat could happen because all too often\nwe start thinking about all of the worst\nthings that could happen so I want to\nplay out all of the worst things that\ncould happen because if I can see all\nthe worst things that can happen now I\ncan make a plan to make sure that those\nthings don't happen right hey if you're\nloving this episode please do me a big\nfavor give us a like down below for the\nYouTube algorithm and if you don't want\nto miss any more of these episodes make\nsure that you subscribe so that you get\nnotified every single time we put up a\nnew episode so I asked myself what's the\nworst that could happen I worked through\nall of those things and I looked at and\nI was like hm it's really not that bad\nit's it's pretty okay right then I asked\nmyself what's the best that could happen\nand then I started looking through I was\nlike oh damn there's actually a lot more\ngood than bad that can come from this I\nwas stuck on all of the bad which we\ntend to do as humans we stick on the bad\nwe stick on the stressful things we\nstick on the worst thing that could\nhappen when in reality usually ends up a\nwhole lot better than we think it's\ngoing to be and statistically 85% of\nwhat you worry about will never happen\nthis is found out by psychologists and\nout of the 15 remaining percent out of\nthe 15 remaining percent out of the 85\nyou know 100us 85 15 the 15 remaining\npercent 12% of it doesn't happen near as\nbad as you're imagining it which means\nonly 3% of what you actually worry about\nhappens as bad as you think it's going\nto and so you ask yourself what's the\nworst that could happen and you play out\nall of the worst scenarios so that you\ncan then make a plan against how to\nmaking sure that those things don't\nhappen then you ask yourself what is the\nbest that could happen and you're like\noh man this there's actually a lot more\npositives that can come from this than I\nwas thinking and then you ask yourself\nwhat I ask myself is what is my next\nbest step to make me feel better what's\nmy next best step to make me feel better\nand then so you look at at it and if it\nwakes you up in the middle of the night\nand you look at it and you write what's\nmy next best step to make me feel better\nusually that thing can't happen at 3:00\nin the morning and so you go okay well\nthat's what I need to do but I can't do\nit right now so I'll do it when I wake\nup and a lot of times that just allows\nyour brain to release it because\nultimately what you're trying to do is\nyou're you can work on all of those\nthings when you're awake and conscious\nafter you've had your coffee but you\ndon't want to work through them at 3\no'clock in the morning 4 o'clock in the\nmorning and so you write down the\nquestion so first question let's go\nthrough it is what am I feeling anxious\nabout or what are the what what can I\nnot stop thinking about now we've Turned\nthe Lights On we've identified the party\nthat we're fighting we've identified\nwhat is making us anxious so we're no\nlonger trying to fight someone in the\ndark we can see oh there's the person\nthat I'm trying to F\ntrying there's a person that I'm trying\nto fight you can fart on him if you want\nthere's a person I'm trying to fight uh\nso so there they are I can see them I\ncan identify them right usually just\nidentifying the thing that's making you\nanxious gives you some sort of sense of\nrelief and you're like okay I've\nidentified what it is because sometimes\nwe get anxious about the fact that we\ndon't know what's making us anxious and\nso if we can identify hey this is the\nthing that's making us anxious perfect\nwe can go forward on them uh we can we\ncould start to work through it right\nbecause lots of times we don't even know\nwhat's going on in our heads and it's\njust it's we have anxious feelings but\nthen we have anxious feelings because we\ndon't know what's making us feel anxious\nright and so a lot of times it's just\nabout the awareness flipping on the\nlight switch what's going on in my head\nnext question when we dive into it\nwhat's the Worst That Could Happen uh\nlike I said a lot of times we make\nthings to be way worse in our heads in\n97% of the time it doesn't end up being\nthat way last night when I was writing\nout what's the worst that could happen I\nwas like this is never going to\nhappen I'm looking at I'm like this\nisn't going to happen happen I know it's\nnot going to happen so why am I wasting\nmy time why am I wasting my energy why\nam I wasting my freaking time that I\ncould be\nsleeping by thinking about this thing\nwhen in reality I'm looking at the worst\nthat could happen I'm going that's not\ngoing to happen there's no way that\nthat's going to\nhappen Okay next question what's the\nbest that could happen let's look at\nwhat could happen positively it probably\nwon't go as bad as you think it's going\nto go it's probably not going to go as\ngood as you think it's going to go but a\nlot of times it goes way better than the\nworst that could happen and then the\nquestion what's my next best step to\nmake me feel better what action can I\ntake to make me feel better maybe in\nthat moment you know maybe you weren't\nwoken up and maybe you just start\nfeeling anxious at 2: p.m. and you're\nlike oh my God I can feel this anxiety\ninside of me and I'm looking at what's\nmaking me anxious what's the thoughts\ngoing through my head what's the Worst\nThat Could Happen what's the best Could\nHappen what's the next best step you\nknow what maybe I can just take some\nreally deep breaths I've heard that Rob\ndial guy say that six deep breath can\nchange our state so I'm going to do six\nsixes deep breaths in through the nose\nout through the mouth and I'm going to\ntry to calm down my nervous system\nbecause my nervous system just seems to\nbe really agitated right now it might be\nagitated because of the thoughts that\nyou have it might be agitated because\nyou had too much coffee today as well it\nmight be agitated because you haven't\neaten today and your blood sugar's low\nthere's many things that can make you\nfeel this way and so maybe what we need\nto do is just calm the body down calm\nthe nervous system down and just figure\nout a way to just do some deep breathing\nif after six deep breaths you feel\nbetter but still not as good as you\ncould feel go to\n10 go to 20 you don't have to stop at 6\nbut I do know that when you take deep\nbreaths into through the nose out\nthrough the mouth then your your exhale\nis longer than your inhale I usually say\ntry to Exhale through your mouth like\nyou're breathing out through a straw\nthat long exhale actually slows your\nheart rate down and it releases extra\ncarbon dioxide from your body and from\nyour muscles which allow you to relax\nmore and so it's really important to do\nthis breathing exercise then you start\nto to change your focus so you can say\nokay I have these anxious feelings no\nbig deal they're there I want to come at\nthese anxious feelings from a better\nState and so I'm going to focus on\nsomething I could be grateful for what\nis someone something anything that I can\nbe grateful for right now in this\nmoment what can I be grateful for and\nyou can switch maybe it's meditation\nmaybe it's breathing maybe it's\ngratitude you work on maybe you need to\nhave a conversation with someone maybe\nthat can make you feel better right now\nmaybe you're like you know what I'm\nfeeling at such a heightened State I\njust need to go for a freaking run I\nneed to go for a run I need to move my\nbody I need to get my heart rate up I\nneed to just not listen to any music but\njust be completely with my thoughts and\nmaybe that's what you go\nfor completely different for every\nsingle person figure out what works for\nyou maybe what you need to do and the\nthing that's going to make you feel the\nbest right now is to call a friend call\nyour friend talk to him about it ask\nthem to come over what I don't want you\nto do is go I need to have\na glass tequila because that's just\nnumbing your feelings versus actually\nworking through them because it's going\nto come up again and again if you don't\nwork through it and so you've\nidentified my anxiety culprit the one\nthat's there you've shined the light on\nit you've identified what could happen\nthe good and the bad so I'm aware of\nboth so that I can figure out which\nactions I need to take to make me feel\nbetter which is what's the best action I\ncould take right now and doing\nthis made me feel so much better I was\nlike oh my gosh this is what was going\nthrough my head it wasn't anything crazy\nlike it's not like Doom and Gloom but it\nwas just like for some reason my brain\nwas just stuck in a loop and I couldn't\nget out of it so I put it all down and I\nsaid okay do I feel like I'm done with\nwith\njournaling yeah I feel like I'm pretty\ndone okay let me see if I can relax my\nbody and so what I did was I put on a\nmeditation and I breathe\nconsciously there just breathe\nconsciously so I put on 20 minute minute\nmeditation I just inhaled exhaled and I\njust instead of doing six deep breaths I\ndid the exact same thing 20 minutes\nminutes or so wasn't trying to think\nabout anything I was just thinking about\ncalming my body and instead of my mind\ngoing to whatever I was anxious about my\nmind was going to I'm going to relax\nwith every single deep breath every time\nI breathe back out I'm going to just\nrelax my body and what happened I was\ngone passed out eventually right and so\nwoke up did my morning routine got my\njournal did my reading started knocking\nout things that were on my list that\nwere making me feel anxious and so what\nit comes down to is I want you to\nrealize that that sometimes people say\noh well I just have anxiety and sure you\nmight have anxiety but it doesn't mean\nyou can't work through your anxiety\ndoesn't mean you can't make positive\nsteps towards it to just say that hey\nI've got this and there's no way I'll\never get past it there's no way I'll\never be able to work through it is not\ngoing to help you in any sort of way\nit's not something that you have to be\nstuck with forever because anxiety comes\nfrom your thoughts it's not like\ndepression where number one first off\nabout 61 to 80% of people who are\ndiagnosed with depression are actually\nmisdiagnosed or Stat on that you can\nGoogle it if you like but depression can\nbe a chemical imbalance inside of your\nbrain anxiety is not a chemical\nimbalance inside of your brain it's just\na pattern of thoughts that you continue\ncontinue to keep going down and you can\njust decide that you're going to\ninterrupt those pattern of thoughts and\nput something else in instead which is\nultimately comes down to you and what\nyou want to do and that's what's\nimportant it puts you back in the\ndriver's seat and in control of your own\nmind so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your
