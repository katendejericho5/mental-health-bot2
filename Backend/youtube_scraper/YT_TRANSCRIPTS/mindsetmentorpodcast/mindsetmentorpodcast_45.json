    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to cover the four attachment\nStyles because if you can learn this you\ncan Master it then you can improve all\nof your relationships let's dive in now\nhave you ever wondered why it seems like\ncertain people can get into a\nrelationship and there's they're they're\nperfect in a relationship it's good it\nseems really easy and then some of your\nfriends might be in like a constant\nstruggle where they seem to keep finding\nthe same person over and over again but\nthey just look a little bit different a\nlot of times what it is it comes down to\nhow we attach to a partner and uh you\nknow you might notice that that someone\nthat you're you're really close to can\nbe one way when you're with them like\nmaybe it's a really good friend you've\nknown for a while right and there you\nnotice that when when you are around\nthem everything's good everything's\ngreat when they're around friends\neverything's good everything's great but\nthen when they're around their partner\nthey almost completely change into a\ndifferent person like they might be in\nbusiness they might be confident and\noutgoing and they look like they they've\ngot it all together and then when they\nget into a relationship with someone\nit's like it's like the little wounded\nchild comes out and they can become\nfearful and they can become scared when\nthey're in a relationship and they can\nbecome jealous and it's almost like\nthey're a different person the thing\nthat we're going to talk about today is\nis your attachment style so that you can\nunderstand yourself you can understand\nyour relationship people in your\nrelationship ships with and these are\nimportant for you to understand so that\nyou can heal\nyourself because if you don't heal\nyourself they're going to keep coming up\nbut just in a new relationship I don't\nknow if you've ever noticed this before\nbut sometimes you can break up with\nsomebody because of XYZ the way the part\nthe the partner showing up the way that\nyou're showing up is just not working\nand then you get into another\nrelationship and the exact same problem\ncomes up well it's usually because of\nthe way that you attach to the other\nperson and usually based off the way\nthat you attach to somebody usually you\nstart to look for a person to attach to\nthat is going to bring out the triggers\nwithin you but it's also really\nimportant for you to understand this\nwithin yourself but also so you can\nunderstand your partner and often times\nuh people don't realize this but your\npartner will be a proxy for your parents\nso what is unhealed in your parental\nrelationships will come up in your\nromantic relationships the universe will\ncontinue to keep presenting you with the\nthing that you need to learn and get\nbetter at until you decide to actually\nlearn and get better at it I have a\nfriend who's U whose husband like she\nhas she has a tumultuous relationship\nwith her mother I'll put it that way her\nhusband she didn't realize it until\nabout a year of being married to him is\nalmost exactly like her mother and so\nshe has this tumult relationship\ntumultuous relationship with her mother\nand now all of those things are coming\nup in the relationship with her husband\nand so let's dive into it let's talk\nabout it but I'm going to say three\ndifferent statements to you and I want\nyou to find out which of these three\nstatements do you feel describe you the\nmost accurately okay statement a is I\nfind it relatively easy to get close to\nothers and I am comfortable depending on\nthem and having them depend on me I\ndon't worry about being abandoned or\nabout someone getting too close to me\ndoes statement a hit home with you okay\nhere is statement B I find that others\nare reluctant to get as close as I would\nlike I often worry that my partner\ndoesn't really love me or won't stay\nwith me I want to get very close to my\npartner and this sometimes scares people\naway does statement B feel like it\nrelates to you okay here's statement C I\nam somewhat uncomfortable being close to\nothers I find it difficult to trust them\ncompletely difficult to allow myself to\ndepend on them I am nervous when anyone\ngets too close and often others want me\nto be more intimate than I feel\ncomfortable being the statement C hit\nhome with you okay these statements\ncorrespond to the three main attachment\nStyles and there's a fourth one that\nwe're going to talk about as well that\nwere identified by English psychologist\nJohn browley in the 1950s and 60s he's\nthe guy who invented to this thing\ncalled the attachment Theory and the\nattachment Styles so if if statement a\nhit home for you the most you most\nlikely what's called a secure attachment\nand these people who have secure\nattachments find it easy to love and\nTrust others and they are comfortable\nwith intimacy and\ndependency okay if option b statement B\nfeels like it hit home with you the most\nyou are most likely an anxious\nattachment these individuals crave\ncloseness but fear abandonment and they\noften worry about their partner's love\nthat their partner's love may display\naggressive behaviors that can create a\ncrisis in relationship and then three\nthe third one which is option C if\noption C felt like it hit home with you\nthe most is avoidant attachment these\nindividuals are uncomfortable with\nintimacy and tend to withdraw\nemotionally they prefer Solitude and\noften avoid close relationships to\nprotect themselves I'm going to talk\nabout it but for me this is the one that\nI identified that I was years and years\nago and then number four which we're\ngoing to talk about is if you feel like\nyou're a mix like if you're a mix bag of\nthese like it feels like it's a little\nbit this it feels like it's a little bit\nof that then you might be the fourth\nattachment style that we're going to go\nthrough so when we talk about these\nattachment Theory basically what it says\nand we'll go through each one of these\nand you can identify which one you are\nand actually what ways to get better at\nit attachment Theory says that the bonds\nthat we form with our primary caregivers\nin early childhood sign significantly\nour impact uh our emotional development\nand so these bonds or our attachment\nstyles that we develop with these these\nprimary caregivers of ours are shaped by\ncon the the consistency responsiveness\nand the sensitivity of our caregivers\nwere they consistent in the way they\nshowed up were they responsive in the\nway they showed up were they sensitive\nin the way that they showed up in\nsensitive to what you needed the four\nmain attachment Styles and we'll go\nthrough each one of these we'll try to\nident ify who you are and if you're in a\nrelationship hopefully we can identify\nwho your partner is and you can always\nlook back through your past partners and\nyou're going to go oh my God this makes\nso much sense why he was like that why\nshe was like that okay secure attachment\nwhich is the first one is the attachment\nstyle that typically uh comes when both\ncaregivers are consistently responsive\nand emotionally available and this\nreliable caregiving gives a child a\nsense of safety and confidence so that\nbasically allow the child to feel safe\nin exploring the world so in adult life\npeople who have a secure attachment\nstyle tend to have a balanced and\nhealthy relationships when they're in\nthem and they're comfortable with\nintimacy and interdependence I'm\ndependent on you you're dependent on me\nthey feel safe being close with someone\nthey feel safe being alone without\nanyone and they can manage conflicts\nvery well and they generally have a\npositive view of themselves and others\nsounds nice doesn't it sure does but\nguess what most people the vast majority\nof people are not this style so you know\nit sounds nice when you think oh they're\nconfident in their relationships oh they\nenjoy spending time with their partner\nbut they also enjoy being alone as well\nthey have no trouble being apart from\ntheir partner oh they're completely fine\nbeing alone they don't feel like they\nneed somebody and they're really good at\nopen conversations and feelings about\ntheir needs and when conflicts come up\nwow they work through them together\ncalmly and constructively uh but the\nproblem is that this tends to be the\nmost rare out of all four of them\nbecause nobody's perfect and a lot of\ntimes even if one of your parents is\nreally good another one can be distant\nand not give you exactly what you want\nwhich then breaks the the secure Bond so\nthen we Deo we we end up going into\nanother attachment style so the next one\nis the the anxious\nattachment hey real quick I want to\nintroduce you to something called\nmindset Mentor plus if you love this\npodcast you will absolutely love what\nI'm about to talk about I designed\nmindset Mentor plus to help you actively\nintegrate every one of these episodes\ninto your life and here's how it works\nwith every episode of this podcast that\ncomes out mindset Mentor plus\nsubscribers get more you're going to get\nmultiple page detailed printable\nworksheets effectively a mini master\nclass that's way more in- depth than\njust this podcast they also come with\njournaling questions challenges\nassignments and so much more so that\nyou're not just listening to these\npodcasts passively but you're actively\nintegrating them into your life that way\nyou improve much faster I also do\nmonthly Q&A sessions in there and much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription and this attachment style is\noften comes when when your caregivers\nare\ninconsistent so they're sometimes\nresponsive sometimes they're a little\nbit neglectful and when I say neglectful\nit doesn't mean like they didn't give\nyou food or water but maybe they just\nweren't emotionally available for you or\nmaybe they didn't pay attention to your\nemotions as much and so sometimes\nthey're responsive sometimes they're not\nsometimes it feels like they care\nsometimes it doesn't feel like they care\nand so children that are in these\nenvironments become hypervigilant and\nwhat this means is that they're\nconstantly seeking reassurance and\napproval to feel secure so sometimes the\nparent is there and they are secure and\nthey make the child feel secure and then\nsometimes they're not and they're\nneglectful and when they're neglectful\nthe child then needs that they feel like\nthey need to get the reassurance to get\nthe approval that they had before from\ntheir parents so that they can feel\nsecure and so as you grow up in an adult\nlife the people with the anxious\nattachment style often crave closeness\nand they fear abandonment because when\nthey're close they feel safe with the\nparent when the parent is not close they\nfeel like they're being abandoned in\nsome sort of way and so they grow up\nwanting that closeness but also really\nfearing abandonment and these are the\ntypes of people that you know they're\nthey're texting all the time when their\npartner is not near and um they may be\noverly dependent on their partners and\nconstantly seeking constant\nvalidation and fearing rejection from\ntheir partner so I'm going to give you a\ncouple real life examples with with each\nof these right so like the first real\nlife example let's say Emma she often\nfeels anxious when her her partner David\ndoesn't respond to her text immediately\nso she worries that he might be losing\ninterest and she then seeks constant\nreassurance that he's not losing\ninterest she needs to hear it from him\nso this need for validation sometimes\nneeds to conflict because David feels\noverwhelmed by her demand for constant\nattention and it becomes too much for\nthe other person David because uh he is\nbasically needing to be her source of\nhappiness and safety and you can never\nbe somebody else's source of of safety\nand happiness it has to come from within\nreal life example number two let's say\nJosh finds himself getting jealous when\nhis girlfriend Maria spends time with\nher friends so he frequently asks her if\nshe still loves him and he needs\nconstant continuous reassurance that\ntheir relationship is okay that she\nwants to be with him that the\nrelationship is strong and this Behavior\nsometimes strains the relationships\nmaking Maria feel like she's being\nsuffocated any of these sound familiar\nhitting home with you so what do we need\nto do if we're in this situation well we\nneed to have awareness we need to notice\nwhen it happens we need to take oursel\nout of the moment and start to feel it\nwe need to develop some self-compassion\nfor oursel practice some self- Lov and\nsay okay yeah I understand why you are\nthis way you know this is something you\ndeveloped from childhood but we're going\nto work through this together and then\nset boundaries with yourself learn to\ndifferentiate between your needs and\nyour anxieties so like a need can be\nquality time four times a week with your\npartner and anxiety is needing them to\ntext you every hour while they're out\nwith their friends so that you know that\nthey're not leaving you okay so that is\nthe uh the anxious uh attachment style\nthe next one is the avoidant attachment\nso you know this one right here is is\nbasically forms when caregivers are\nemotionally distant or neglectful and so\nthese children learn to suppress their\nemotional needs relying on themselves\nrather than others for Comfort or\nsupport this one is mine you know my\nfather is an alcoholic wasn't around uh\nsometimes he said he was going to come\npick me up to go fishing and I would sit\nand wait for him and he would forget\nabout me cuz he was at the bar and he\ngot drunk and he would just never show\nup and so sometimes he didn't show up\nwhen he was supposed to sometimes he did\nshow up and so it was very much like\nneglectful in that way I never went\nwithout a meal so I wasn't neglected in\nthat way but in turn because of the fact\nthat I had this relationship with him\nand I realized that I couldn't rely on\nhim I subconsciously in my head just\nlearn to become a law a loner I just\nthought to myself I can't trust anybody\nI can't trust anybody but myself I'll do\nit all on my own so I became extremely\ndependent uh um sorry independent and\nnot needing anybody else so when you\ngrow up and you have a this this\nattachment style those with this\nattachment style tend to be very uh they\nreally really Value Independence and\nself-sufficiency and they often tend to\navoid emotional closeness this happened\na lot of my relationships with would get\nto like a a glass ceiling if as far as\nhow much I could open up and then I\ncouldn't I felt like I couldn't go any\nfurther and because the fact that I\ncouldn't go any further I couldn't open\nup anymore the relationships never got\nany better and then they just ended up\nfizzling out because the person I was in\na relationship with was like ah I don't\nfeel like there's any more to this guy\nand so they also might struggle with\ntrusting others or actually sharing\ntheir feelings leading to feeling like\nthey're very distant in the\nrelationships and relationships end up\nfeeling really unfulfilling and so real\nlife example number one so let's say\nMike really values his his\ninterdependence and he finds it hard to\nopen up to his partner Anna when Anna\ntries to to then discuss their future\ntogether Mike will then shut off or\nchange a subject fearing that intimacy\nmight lead to losing his\nautonomy okay does that hit home with\nanybody out there real life example\nnumber two and I know that as I'm going\nthrough this some of you guys are going\noh my God that's me and some of you guys\nare going oh my God that was my\nboyfriend oh my God that was my\ngirlfriend oh my gosh I'm Stant this is\nall making sense now uh second real life\nexample let's say Lisa she's a highly\nsuccessful woman in her career but she\nstruggles with her relationship she's\nvery driven and go go go but she tends\nto keep her emotions to herself and\navoids deep conversations so when her\nboyfriend tries to get closer she often\nresponds with indifference or changes\nthe topic to something less personal so\nthat she doesn't feel like she has to\nopen up cuz she just relies on herself\nand doesn't want to open up to people\nfor me it was basically like all of the\nabove right I it for me it was it was I\nI needed to discover my emotions there\nwas a moment in time where I was like I\ndon't know if I have emotions like 15\nyears ago I was like am I just like an\nemotionless person and so I had to like\ndiscover my emotions and understanding\nthat there was a limiter that I was\nputting on myself unconsciously and and\nI got into the relationship with Lauren\nand we started talking about this and I\nwas like I don't know\nhow to get past this thing and we had a\nfriend who's we still have a friend he's\nhe's still around uh so we have a friend\nwho is a relationship therapist which I\nrecommend for everybody and uh he he was\ntalking to us and he's like Lauren your\njob in this relationship is to try to\nshow Rob how to open up more to love to\ntry to show him what is outside of his\ncapacity and so what helped was honestly\nopening up and if I'm in in trying and\nasking and communicating but one thing\nthat really helps me as weird as this\nsounds I'm just going to be fully\ntransparent what really helped me start\nopening myself up more to love was\nactually having a dog right it felt safe\nwith him with our dog Toby because I\nknew Toby wouldn't me over right so\nI was like oh I'm going to open myself\nup and so I actually used like my love\ngrowing for this dog and allowed myself\nallowed myself to open up to him knowing\nthat this was actually helping me\ndiscover parts of myself that I had\nnever found before and so I really think\nthat if you can if you feel like you're\nemotionally blocking in ways is to\nactually try to find an animal that you\ncan you know your animal is not going to\nscrew you over you know it's not going\nto turn your back it's back on you and\nso it's like you can try to open\nyourself up and use that animal for\npractice of like oh my gosh I love you\nso much like saying that you love them\nall of that type of stuff another thing\nthat really helped me was like a lot of\nmeditation a lot of journaling a lot of\nbeing with myself and asking myself the\ntough questions you know quite a few\npsychedelic experiences happened as well\nit didn't happen overnight where I was\nable to open myself up it's been a a\n10-year Journey at this point but now\nwhat I was really working on is where\nI've gotten to which is I feel safe to\nopen up to the person I'm in a\nrelationship with and so that's really\nimportant to to get to that point the\nfourth one uh with the fourth attachment\nstyle is fearful and avoidant attachment\nthis is also known as disorganized\nattachment this attachment style\ndevelops in environments where\ncaregivers are abusive unpredictable or\nneglectful and so children in these\nsituations often fear uh experience fear\nand confusion leading to lack of\ncoherent attachment strategy so they're\njust kind of all over the board they're\nkind of all three of the other\nattachment Styles and so in adult life\nfearful avoidance uh fearful avoidant uh\nadults often have conflicting desires\nfor intimacy like they want to be\nintimate with someone else but they also\nhave this really hard like fear of being\nhurt and they might want to be really\nclose relationships but they're also\nreally afraid of being vulnerable so\nthey they feel and they seem very\nerratic\nand unpredictable in their behaviors and\nso like the first example let's say\nLaura she desires a deep connection with\nher partner Jake but often feels\noverwhelmed by the fear of being hurt so\nshe alternates between seeking closeness\nand then pushing Jake away and it's a\ncycle of of tension and confusion in the\nrelationship another example be let's\nsay Tom Tom really wants a meaningful\nrelationship but finds himself pulling\naway whenever someone starts to get too\nclose and so his past experience with\nunpredictable caregivers made it hard\nfor him to trust other people and so\nthis leads to a pattern of shortlived\nbut really tumultuous relationships he's\nreally close and he pulls away he's\nreally close and he pulls away what it's\nwhat's really important is no matter\nwhat style you are if you want to\nimprove the first thing that we all need\nto do is we all need to develop\nself-awareness if this really hits home\nwith you I recommend reading more about\nthis and so become more self-aware\nreflect on your childhood experiences\nand how they might have influenced your\nyour current behaviors and your emot\ntions and the way that you are in\nrelationships another thing that I would\ndefinitely recommend for people is going\nto therapy if this is something that you\nwant to work on if you're in a if you're\ngoing oh my gosh I'm noticing that I'm\nthis way and my husband is this way I\nrecommend just simply searching for a\ncouple's therapist uh a couple's\ntherapist does not mean there's anything\nwrong in relationship but it's kind of\nlike having a third party that can help\nyou both see each other\nbetter I recommend it 100% if that's\nsomething that you want to work on the\nthird thing is you need to have open and\nhonest communication with your partner\nso if this is hitting home with you\nmaybe play this episode for your partner\nand say hey what do you feel about this\nI'm identifying that I I think I'm kind\nof like avoidant attachment what do you\nfeel like you are do you feel like\nyou're okay you feel like you're this\nand you start to communicate and come up\nwith a plan of helping each other this\nreally helped me when I found out that\nthe the type of attachment style that I\nwas I communicate with Lauren I was like\nhey can you help me open up and then the\nthe the other thing I recommend is just\njust being more mindful having more time\nto be quiet and start noticing the\nthoughts going on in your head and start\nchallenging your thoughts that are going\non your head so you don't have these\nimpulsive reactions that are just driven\nby insecure attachment Styles ultimately\nwhat we're all searching for is\nhealthier relationships and by\nunderstanding yourself and understanding\nothers you're going to be able to\ncommunicate more effectively and have\nbetter relationships so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share on\nInstagram stories tag me in it Rob dial\nJr
