    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to talk about how\nto stop caring about other people's\nJudgment of you and also just how\noverall to stop being offended we're\ngoing to talk about not worrying about\nother people's judgments not worrying\nabout other people's opinions because\nall too often I get so many messages\nfrom people that just say like I'm I'm\nso worried about taking action because\nI'm worried about what my mom's going to\nsay I'm worried about what my my aunt is\ngoing to say I'm worried about my father\nwho said you went to school to be an\nengineer why would you go and do this\nother thing and last week I actually got\nan Instagram message and the question\nwas really around how to deal with\nsomeone that says things to you that\nhurts you all the time so you know I'm I\nhave this relationship with this person\nthey say things to hurt me all the time\nand I saw that message come through and\nI was like you know what I should do a\npodcast episode on this which this is\nalso why it's good to follow me on\nInstagram uh that's where I usually\ncommunicate with people my followers the\nmost so if you want to follow me on\nthere it's Rob dial Jr r o b d i a ljr\nand you have ideas for podcast episodes\nsend them through maybe you'll hear me\ntalk about it um so the first thing I'll\ntell you is this if you are worried\nabout other people's judgments opinions\nif somebody is talking down to you the\nfirst thing I want you to understand is\nyou have to stop hanging out with people\nwho talk down to you there's so many\npeople that message me that are like how\ndo I deal with this person and I'm like\nthe best way to deal with them is to\nstop dealing with them just remove them\nfrom your life it's like saying like hey\nit hurts when I touch here and it's like\nokay we'll stop touching there that's\nthat's kind of what it comes down to to\nand and I realize that for some of you\nthat are listening like that's\nimpossible because the person who\noffends me or the person who talks down\nto me is my spouse or it is my mother or\nit is my father or it's my sister well\nin that case you need to make some\nadjustments there's two options either\nnumber one you stay with that person you\nstay in a relationship with them uh I\nguess there's two options or three\noptions there's you either stay in a\nrelationship with them number two is you\nchange your relationship with them you\nspend less time with them or number\nthree you actually don't have that\nperson your life anymore and I've gotten\nsome hate before in the past of saying\nthat people should you know if if if\nsomebody is really rude to them they\nshould stop hanging out with them even\nif it is one of their parents and I've\nhad some people that have said oh you\nshould never tell someone not to hang\nout with their parents or not to be with\ntheir mom and my response to that is you\nshould see some of the messages that I\nget as to how terrible some people's\nparents are to them I'm talking about\nlike the worst things I've heard\nsometimes come from somebody who is in a\nrelationship with her parents and so I'm\nnot saying that this is something that\nyou have to do I'm giving you options\nit's your life you can choose what you\nwant to do but really what it comes down\nto is you've got to stop hanging out\nwith people who are holding you back\nyou've got to stop hanging out with\npeople who are talking trash to you when\nyou're just trying to do your best you\ndon't you have St hang out with people\nwho who don't want the best for you or\npeople who cut you down or whenever\nyou're successful they find holes in\nyour success you know what I mean like\nthey're the type of people where where\nif you won the lottery they'd be like oh\nmy god do you know how much you have to\npay taxes you're not even going to take\nhome all of that $40 million you know\nlike they're those types of people uh\nthey're the people who who throw in the\nlittle tiny negative comments just the\nlittle little tiny Jabs it's like death\nby a Thousand Cuts it's like the one cut\ndoesn't hurt but if it's over and over\nand over again it's like dude how much\nlonger can I take this person's and\nreally what it comes down to is you have\nto decide that the people that you\nsurround yourself with might be the most\nimportant thing in your entire life and\nthere is study after study after study\nabout how the people that you surround\nyourself with dictate the life you're\ngoing to have there's the longest study\non happiness which is over 85 years old\nat this point was done by Harvard and\nthey found out the happiest people are\nthe ones that have deep meaningful\nrelationships and the ones that have\ntoxic relationships actually have been\nfound to be the equivalent of not taking\ncare of your body of smoking cigarettes\nof not working out and so they've\nactually found over these 80 years of\nstudying people's lives that people have\nthe best relationships actually live\nlonger not the most relationships but\nthe best relationships the people who\nhave the most toxic relationships don't\ntend to live as long and so really what\nit comes down to is you've got to before\nanything else if you're like Hey how do\nI not be offended by these people how do\nI not care about other people's opinions\nother people's judgments how do I not um\nhow do I work with somebody who's\nconstantly talking down to me the first\nimmediate response is can you figure out\na way to distance yourself from that\nperson I don't really know who they are\nin your life and I don't care who they\nare in life but really what it comes\ndown to is you need to be able to have\nan environment a social environment that\nis for your happiness for your joy for\nyour success for your love and anything\nthat's outside of that you need to see\nif you can remove and so that's the\nfirst thing I want you to think about as\nyou're really starting to think about\nthat and I'll talk a little bit more\nabout your circle in just a minute next\nthing I think about when I when I think\nabout this is um it's really interesting\nthing to think about is that nobody can\nsay something to you that hurts without\nyou already believing that thing so\nnobody can say something to you and that\noffend you unless that thing that\noffends you is something that you\nalready either subconsciously or\nconsciously believe in some sort of way\nyou know there's many things that I\ncould come up to you and I could say and\nnone of them would offend you but I\ncould say one thing to you and that\nthing offends you that thing is actually\nwhat you believe in yourself and so that\ncomes down to your own self-d doubt that\ncomes down to your own self-love you\nknow I've told this story so many times\nin the podcast but it's so ridiculously\nrelevant but one of my friends Ryan he\nhad a really successful business he was\nlike mid 20s and he was you know had\nthis businesses doing millions of\ndollars a year and he was taking a walk\nwith his mentor and his mentor said so\nran how's the business going it seems\nlike you're crushing it and he said man\nyou know what\nlike every time I get an email from like\na customer who wants to return their\nproduct or tells me that the product\nbroke or that I I made a shitty product\nhe's like every time I get those emails\nI just want to shut it all down and so\nfrom the outside looking in it's like it\nlooks like he's crushing it from the\ninside out he was like just frustrated\nwith the fact that he was getting some\nemails or negative comments or reviews\nand uh his mentor who was you know in\nhis 50s at the time said yeah I know why\nand Ryan says why he goes because you're\ninsecure you're insecure about those\nthings he's like what are you talking\nabout him insecure he goes well I'll\ngive you an example if a lady came up to\nyou right now we're walking on the\nstreet and said hey you have pink hair\nwhat would you think he's like I I don't\nknow I don't have pink hair he said what\nwould you think he goes I probably think\nshe's crazy because I don't actually\nhave pink hair and so then he said okay\nbut if a lady came up to you right now\nand said hey I bought your product and\nyour product\nsucks and you start to feel something\ninside of you you have to realize when\nyou feel that thing inside of you it's\nonly because you already believe that\nyou don't believe you have pink hair\ndoesn't offend you but you believe that\nyour product sucks you believe it's\ninferior maybe you don't believe in 100%\nand have 100% conviction into this thing\nand so really what it comes down down to\nis that no one can make you feel\ninferior without your consent which is\nwhat Elanor Roosevelt says you know if\nsomeone says I don't like your hair if\nyou don't really care what your hair\nlooks like that's not going to offend\nyou I don't like your hair color no big\ndeal I don't like your voice no big deal\nbut when you have a a wound or an\ninsecurity around something and somebody\nbrings up that wound or kind of pokes it\nwith their finger and it hurts it's\nbecause that insecurity already existed\nthey're not making you feel that way\nwhat they're doing is they're bringing\nup something that's already inside of\nyou that anger that you feel is\nsomething that lives inside of you that\nsadness that you feel is something that\nlives inside of you that frustration\nthat you feel is something that lives\ninside of you it's not something that\nthe person gives you by what they say\nit's them showing you where you're not\nfree no one can make you feel something\nthat hurts you unless you already\nbelieve it to be true so as pissed off\nas you might be as hurt as you might be\nthat person is giving you a gift even\nthough they're pissing you off they're\ngiving you a gift they're showing you\nwhere you're not free they're showing\nyou where you are hung up in your own\nmind they're showing you where you still\nneed\nwork that's a gift oh thank you Universe\nGod whatever you believe in by coming\nand showing me where I'm not free\nthrough this person who's completely\ntriggering me right now you know life is\njust a constant upleveling of growth and\nit never really stops it's constantly oh\nI'm triggered here I'm noticing I'm not\nfree I'm noticing my programming I'm\ntriggered here I'm noticing my\nprogramming I'm triggered here I'm\nnoticing my programming life is\nconstantly showing you what's where\nyou're not free so that you can either\nfold or that you can work through it and\nyou can level up in some sort of way in\nyour life you'll never arrive to a\nmoment in your life where you're just\n100% perfect there is no destination\nthere's no way to not have any baggage\nthere's no way to not have any flogs\nflaws there's no way to not have any\ntriggers there's no way to just never\nhave a temper or never feel emotion or\nbe perfectly calm all of the time in the\nmiddle of a tornado you're a human and\nyou have to realize that I I believe you\nknow like I've I've known some people\nthat have\nbeen extremely enlightened compared to\nme like way further in on the journey\nand they get to their 80s and they get\nto their 90s and they still talk about\nhow they're not free from a lot of their\nthings they still talk about how they've\nbeen working on themselves for 60 70 80\nyears they've been putting time in and\nthey're still not free and I'm going\ndamn it well if they're not free I don't\nknow if I'm ever going to get free right\nthat's fine and so when you realize that\nthere is no destination that you get to\nwhere you're just perfect it allows you\nto just have some more awareness and go\nokay all right I see Rob where you're\nhung up let's go ahead and let's work\nthrough this this is also really\nimportant why self-belief is why\nself-belief is such an important thing\nto think about because if you fully\nbelieve in yourself if you fully believe\nlike fully believe in yourself it\ndoesn't actually matter what anybody\nsays to you because you don't believe\nthat they're saying something to you and\ndo I believe them are they okay they're\ntelling me XYZ do I believe XYZ no\nbecause I think this of myself I believe\nin myself so much that doesn't matter\nwhat you say to me I believe in my\npurpose so much it doesn't matter what\nyou say to me that's what we're trying\nto work towards so how do we start to\nbelieve in oursel as a natural next\nquestion okay if I believe fully in\nmyself that almost like puts a barrier\naround me where when someone throws\ntheir at me I'm like ah doesn't\nstick doesn't really matter so then how\ndo we build that belief in oursel\nthere's a couple different ways I think\none of the most important ways to build\nconfidence in yourself is to\ncontinuously continually whatever the\nright answer would be there I don't know\nwhat it is not an English expert uh but\nbut always push yourself to do something\nthat you don't want to do or to do\nsomething that makes you a little bit\nuncomfortable every single day something\nthat's a little bit outside of your\ncomfort zone why is that cuz confidence\ndoesn't only come from succeeding at\nthings confidence also comes and\nsometimes it comes even more often by\ndoing something that you didn't want to\ndo whether you succeed or whether you\nfail you watched yourself do something\nyou didn't want to do for your own best\ninterest and so you showed up for\nyourself whether you succeed or whether\nyou failed you succeed you you showed up\nfor yourself and showing up for yourself\nand doing something that you didn't want\nto do builds a little bit of confidence\nyou didn't want to go for a run you went\nfor a damn run you didn't want to wake\nup you woke up\nin doing the things that are good for\nyou is what's really important and\nthere's many studies that show that this\nis true there's a a thing that um Albert\nbandora came up with called the\nself-efficacy Theory and really what it\ncomes down to is it revolves around the\nindividual's belief and their ability to\nsucceed in specific situations or to be\nable to accomplish tasks and what they\nfound out was that one of the primary\nways to build\nself-confidence is through situations\nwhere the individual faces challenges\nand either succeeds or their fails but\nthey at least puts into the challenge\nand then overcoming the obstacles\nachieving the goals all of those are\ngreat and they help build confidence but\nwhat's most important is the person\nputting them in challenging situations\nin in actually doing something they\ndidn't want to do or doing something\noutside of their comfort zone or seeing\nthat there was a challenge they fac it\nanyway and they even if they fail they\ngo well damn it at least I showed up for\nmyself at least I saw that challenge and\nI showed up that's really important and\nso if you're trying to build confidence\nyou got to ask yourself am I just doing\nthe same things every single day or am I\nconstantly trying to push myself out of\nmy comfort zone am I trying to change my\ncircle am I trying to to be different\nthan the people that are around me am I\ntrying to be get into a circle where\npeople make me better you know we've\nheard over and over again that you're\nthe average of The Five People You spend\nthe most time with so if the people\naround you don't want the best for you\nif they don't want your success if they\ntry to make you play small if they you\nknow throw in those subtle negative\nremarks find a new Circle figure it out\nbecause there's also study after study\nafter study that shows that who you hang\nout with you become and so we've all\nheard the phrase you're the average of\nThe Five People You spend the most time\nwith and that's all awesome and stuff\nbut is there actual fact in it like is\nthere scientific proof that shows that a\nperson will mold and shift thems\ndepending on who they surround thems\nwith funny you should ask that question\nyes there is there's a couple different\nones there's one that's called the\nframington uh Framingham heart study is\na study that's been going on since\n1948 and in 2007 two researchers\nanalyzed the data from 1948 to 2007 and\nthe study found out that various\nbehaviors\ntraits which also include happiness\nobesity and smoking habits spread\nthroughout social networks what shows\nthrough all of this is that you become\nwho you surround yourself with they\nfound this is an interesting study that\nthey found interesting finding they\nfound in that study they found that if a\nclose friend becomes obese if you have a\nclose friend that becomes obese your\nchances of becoming obese increase by\n57% so it shows that your Social Circle\nsignificantly influences your behaviors\nand habits and so when a lot of people\nlike hey I'm trying to be more more I'm\ntrying to be happier I'm trying to do\nbetter but nobody in my life really\nwants the same what do I do I'm a lot of\ntimes I'm just honest with them just try\nto find a new Circle where success and\nhappiness becomes natural for you not\nsomething that you have to fight for\nthere's also another study that was\ncalled the rosenquist study on\ndepression and uh the study examined how\nhappiness and Depression spread within\nyour closest social networks and so they\nfound uh that having a friend who\nbecomes depressed if you have a friend\nthat becomes depressed your chances of\nbecoming incre uh depressed as well\nincrease exponentially on the other side\nof that though having a friend who's\nincredibly happy can decrease your\nchances of depression and potentially\nincrease your overall happiness which\nshows you that not only are you happy if\nyour friends are happy not only are you\ndepressed or more likely to be happy if\nyour friends are happy or more likely to\nbe depressed if your friends are\ndepressed you're also more likely to be\nobese if your friends are obese and so\nit really comes down to like looking at\nyour Social Circle and saying is this\nSocial Circle the one that I want to\nsurround myself\nwith and then the last tip that I'll\ngive you around this as well is really\njust start to be careful who you're\ntaking advice from if you're getting\noffended if you're worried about other\npeople's judgments all of this be\ncareful who you surround yourself with\nyou know like I love my mom she's great\nbut I would never take advice from my\nmom on how to grow my\nInstagram why my mom doesn't even have\nan Instagram but how many people are out\nthere not starting a business because\nyour mom or dad or friends are saying\nthat it's a terrible idea yet they've\nnever had a successful business it's the\nsame thing I'm like would you would you\ntake advice from you know somebody who\nis homeless on how to be a millionaire\nprobably not if I said hey you've got to\nyou've got to find one mentor to Mentor\nyou on how to become a millionaire go\nfind them what would you want to find\nsomeone who's a millionaire and so\nyou've got to start asking yourself the\nquestion like would I want to trade\nplaces with the person who's giving me\nadvice if someone's giving me a\nrelationship advice but they've had just\nterrible relationships since I've known\nthem probably not the person want to\ntake relationship advice from from if\nsomeone's trying to give me business\nadvice and they've literally never had a\nbusiness why would I ever take business\nadvice from them and so we've got to be\nreally um diligent on who we take our\nadvice from and would we want to trade\npositions with them with where they are\nin their life and so really what it\ncomes down to is is there's many\ndifferent ways to work on yourself to\nnot be offended to not care about other\npeople's judgments not care about other\npeople's opinions and but what it comes\ndown to most is number one your own\nself-belief your own self-confidence\nbecause that basically just puts a\nfirewall around you and you don't care\nwhat anybody says to you because you're\nso confident in your own personal\nabilities that the haters mean nothing\nto you and the second thing if you want\nto make it easier just start paying\nattention to who you surround yourself\nwith how do you not be offended by other\npeople's opinions and judgments don't\ndon't hang out with other people who are\nconstantly judging you quite simple and\nso that's really what it comes down to\nis notice your own internal talk and\nthen notice the talk of the people that\nare around you as well so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me in at\nRob dial Jr r o d a ljr that's also\nwhere you can reach out to me if you\nhave any podcast ideas tips that you\nwant to hey I'd love for you to
