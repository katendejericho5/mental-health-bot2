    "transcript": "one of the things that I find with\npeople is that we are afraid of\nuncertainty and uncertainty is a threat\nto the brain because your brain doesn't\nknow how to work through the potential\nthreats that are coming in front of it\nso it takes all of the uncertainty that\nwe see in our future and makes it more\ncertain and it's really interesting\nbecause when we have these we we\nbasically create the Boogeyman in our\nmind for what the future could hold and\nthen when we basically face the\nboogeyman we realize it's really not\nthat bad and it would be okay even if we\ndid face it"
