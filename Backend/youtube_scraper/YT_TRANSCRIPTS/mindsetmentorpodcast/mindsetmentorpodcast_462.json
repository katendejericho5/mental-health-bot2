    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to get focused and I'm going\nto teach you some tips and tricks of how\nto actually use your eyes and how to use\nyour brain through neuroplasticity of\nhow to actually change your brain to be\nmore focused so that you can get more\ndone because in reality let's be real\nlike we live in a a very very distracted\nworld and since the iPhone and\nsmartphones have come out we've only\ngotten more and more distracted and so\nif if distraction was a muscle our\ndistraction muscle is really really\nstrong and over time I think that the\npast 10 years 12 years or so we've\naccidentally gotten really strong\ndistraction muscles and really weak\nFocus muscles and I like to see Focus as\nlike a muscle because focus is something\nthat you can grow it is something that\nyou can expand it is something that you\ncan get better with whether you're\nsomebody who has ADD ADHD doesn't have\nit whatever it might be no matter what\nwhat your circumstance currently is you\ncan always get better at focusing and\nthat's what I really want to help you\ndive into today and it's kind of like\nthe way I like to think about is like\nI'm right-handed I can write really well\nwith my right hand if I get try to write\nsomething with my left hand like I can\nbarely hold a pen with my left hand so\nit's kind of like my right hand is my\ndistracted part of my brain and I'm\nreally good with that one and it might\nbe that my left hand my focus is not\nreally great but the more and more that\nI use my left hand the more and more\nthat I write with my left hand the\nbetter I will get and focus is the exact\nsame thing and the reason why Focus is\nextremely important is because you only\nhave 24 hours every single day you don't\nget any more and everyone's schedule's\ndifferent maybe you have a job maybe you\ndon't maybe you have children maybe you\ndon't maybe you have hobbies maybe you\ndon't but you get 24 hours a day and so\nwhen you sit down to work to create to\ndo whatever it is that you want to do to\nbe the person that you are in this world\nwhen you sit down to take action towards\nwhat is that you're trying to do\nwhy would you ever want to bring less\nthan 100% of your mental focus to\nsomething like when I sit down to work\nto create podcast episodes to create\nreals for Instagram or anything that is\nI try to bring 100% of my brain power to\nit not 40% not 60% and so I'm going to\nshare a few things that you've probably\nheard me talk about before but I'm going\nto share some things that I've actually\nnever shared on the podcast before and\nuh things that you've you know tips and\ntricks on how to use your eyes how to\nuse your brain to get your your body and\nyour brain to be more focused uh this is\nactually taken from my book level up uh\nin part two of you know part one of my\nbook is is why you're not taking action\npart two is how to take action and this\nis actually chapter eight I'm going to\nshare some tips and tricks from from\nchapter eight of actually neurologically\nhow to use your brain to get more\nfocused and so I'm excited to share this\nwith you so uh one of the things that\nthat is super super important the book\nin case you want to buy it is called\nlevel up how to get focused stop\nprocrastinating and upgrade your life\nyou can buy it any anywhere if you want\nto buy it but one of the things that's\nthat's super important and you've heard\nme talk about it before over and over\nagain but I'm really curious if\neveryone's using it is the Pomodori\ntechnique and I'm going to talk about\nthe Pomodori technique but I'm also\ngoing to tell you why neurologically it\nis actually one of the best things that\nyou can use to get focused and create\nwhatever it is that you want to create\nso when you sit down to do the pomodora\ntechnique when you sit down to get deep\nwork done and you say I'm going to work\nfrom this time to this time you need to\ncreate something sort of routine and so\nyou want to remove all the distractions\nfrom within Arms Reach you want to take\nyour phone and if you work from home put\nyour phone in another room turn off all\nof your not notifications turn off your\nemails turn off your Wi-Fi if you can\nlike if you need to use Google doc to\nwrite your book turn off all of your\nWi-Fi have it so there's no distractions\nyou could have also people can be\ndistractions so notify people that\nyou're going to focus and not to bother\nyou if you're getting focused work done\nand you're in the office and you're in a\nbig open Office put your headphones on\nso people know that you're working put\nput a a sign on your door put a sign on\nyour back that says getting work done\ndon't talk to me for the next 30 minutes\nwhatever it is that you need to do to\nremove distractions because distractions\nkeep you from being focused so can we\nremove as many distractions as possible\nthe next thing that I want you to do is\ntake a pen and paper and brain dump\neverything that you have to do later\neverything that's an idea everything on\nyour to-do list so that your brain can\nrelease everything that needs to be done\nlater and your brain can go okay I don't\nneed to think about this cuz it's on\nthis piece of paper then I would\nrecommend putting on noise cancelling\nheadphones and then set a timer whether\nthat's on your phone whether that's on\nyour computer I actually have a\ncompletely separate timer that's on my\ndesk uh that is actually just a timer\nthat I bought from Amazon and you set it\nfor 25 minutes and you focus on one task\nand one task only and now here where\nwe're going to start going into stuff\nI've never shared before uh and this is\nwhat's important as you focus on one\ntask and one task only and you're going\nto fight through the struggle the thing\nthat I found is as I was writing the\nbook level up is I use myself as a\nguinea pig I to I I hate writing I'm\njust not a fan of sitting down to write\nI love speaking I'm much better at it\nbut I would have to sit down and write\nand it was a struggle for me and what I\nwas when I was doing a lot of research\non this book I realized that\nneurologically when you sit down to do\nsomething new like a new task your brain\ntakes about 6 minutes to warm up but\nthat warm up this is really important\nactually feels feel like stress and\nagitation and this is a really secret\npart to sitting down and getting focused\nokay so when you're sitting down to get\nsome work done and you're sitting down\nto focus and take the action that you\nneed to whatever it is it actually feels\nlike stress and agitation and so I don't\nknow if you've been like me but I I\nwould sit down and I would sit down to\nwrite the book and I would just get so\nagitated and I'd be like I don't want to\ndo it I don't want to do it and as I\nstarted working with neurologist to put\nthis book together and make sure all of\nit was fact I realized oh my God this is\ncrazy when your brain is warming up to\nget focused it releases two chemicals\none of them is called acetylcholine and\nthe other one is called epinephrine\nwhich is adrenal it's another name for\nadrenaline in your brain but epinephrine\nand acetylcholine when they're released\nin order to get focused both of them\nfeel like stress and agitation in the\nbody hey if you're loving this episode\nso please do me a favor give us a like\ndown below for the YouTube algorithm and\nif you want to go ahead and buy this\nbook all you have to do it should be\ndown below in the description in the\ncomments go ahead and buy it anywhere\nwhere you purchase books and so a lot of\ntimes here's what happens is we sit down\nto get something done and then we start\nfeeling agitated right and we're like oh\nmy God I'm so agitated I'll go do\nsomething else what's crazy about that\nis that it is showing you you are\nwalking through the Gateway of focus and\nyou're just about to dip out and so\nwe're like oh my God I'm stressed I'm\nstressed stress I'm stressed no no no\nthat stress and agitation you need at\nthis I need you to get this like in\nevery single cell of your body you need\nto understand when you feel that stress\nand agitation that's actually your brain\nwarming up to get focused towards a new\ntask stress and agitation is the gateway\nto focusing your\nbrain how crazy is that it's showing you\nthat your brain is warming up so don't\nstop you've got to fight through the\nagitation and as I was writing the book\nI would notice after about 6 minutes 7\nMinutes 8 minutes depending on what day\nit was and what you know obviously we\nfeel different every single day is\neventually I would get into like a flow\nState and that's when it was amazing but\nI almost never got into a flow State\nwithout the stress and agitation first\nand so I really want you to get that\ninto all of yourselves is that it\nactually feels like you're stressed and\nanxious and agitated before your brain\nactually focuses because of those two\nchemicals being released in your brain\nand so here's what you want to do when\nyou sit down you want to fight to get to\n20 25 minutes when I first started so\nit's it's 25 minutes on 5 minutes off 25\nminutes on 5 minutes off and so in those\n25 minutes when I first heard about the\npom pomodora technique years ago which\nis just simply 25 minutes on 5 minutes\noff when I first heard about it it was a\nreal struggle like six years ago seven\nyears ago for me to get to 25 minutes I\nRemember by the time I get to like 19\nminutes my brain was like I need to\ncheck my phone I need to check my email\noh I have an idea to do this oh I should\ndo this thing I should do this thing and\nso it was a real struggle for me to get\nto 25 minutes but over time I kept\nsaying nope shut up brain we're going to\nkeep working on this thing nope shut up\nbrain we're going to keep working on\nthis thing nope shut up brain we're\ngoing to keep working on this thing same\nway that you train a dog sit sit sit\neventually the dog learns to sit you're\ntraining your brain focus focus focus\nand you fight for 25 minutes to get to\nthose 25 minutes when you hit those 25\nminutes you give your brain a five\nminute break and here's the key and I've\nheard a lot of people I was teaching\nthis to one of my friends the other day\nI was talking to him about the book he's\nextremely successful one of the most\nsuccessful authors out there and he goes\noh my god I've been doing it wrong all\nthe time I will do the pomodora\ntechnique and then in my 5 minutes off I\nwill check my phone and I said you don't\nwant to check your phone you don't want\nto check your phone you don't want to\ncheck your emails you want to give your\nbrain a rest in those five minutes that\nrest can look like a couple different\nthings you can either go for a walk you\ncan go outside and you can just expand\nyour eyes and allow them to go to\nwherever it is that they want to go to\nor you Just Close Your Eyes set another\ntimer for 5 minutes and just do some\ndeep breathing because what your brain\ndoes in this moment when you're resting\nis it's number one it's like you can't\nwork out all day long you have to work\nout hard and then rest and work out hard\nand rest work out hard and rest your\nbrain works the exact same way focus and\nrest focus and rest you can't say\nfocused all the time but when you're\nlooking at something that's really close\nto your face like your phone your brain\nand your eyes actually have to look and\nthey have to go in a little bit to focus\nthat's that's called a convergence eye\nmovement which means that your eyes are\nactually looking inward at something\nthat's close that eye movement actually\ntells your brain that it needs to focus\non something and so if you're looking at\nyour phone or you're looking at your\nemails your brain never gets the rest in\nthose five minutes which is super\nimportant for you to understand you have\nto give your brain that rest and then\nonce you get done with that five minute\nrest whether you close your eyes whether\nyou go for a walk whether you just allow\nyour you know peripheral vision to come\nin and you just sit in silence you go\nback for another 25 minutes and as you\ndo this more and more often you're going\nto start to realize that you can get to\n25 minutes ear you can get to 25 minutes\nfaster there's not as much stress and\nagitation in the beginning you can get\nto 25 minutes faster or better I guess\nyou would say there's not as much\nresistance towards it at that point in\ntime what I recommend is expanding the\ntime and so Pomodoro is 25 minutes on 5\nminutes off in the book level up I talk\nabout something that I do that's called\nPomodoro plus which is 45 minutes on 10\nminutes off I've been doing this for a\nfew years now because once again it was\na really big struggle for me to get to\n25 minutes for a while and then I got\nbetter at it and better at it over years\nand years and years and now I realize\nthat by 25 minutes I'm like in the zone\nand I don't want to break it so I'll set\nit for 45 minutes now and then 10\nminutes off and so I'd recommend\nstarting at 25 minutes and if it becomes\neasier and easier to get to 25 minutes\nwithout resistance go to 30 minutes go\nto 35 go to 40 go to 45 and then give\nyourself a longer break if you're going\nto go longer now here's what's really\ninteresting about Focus okay your mental\nfocus follows your visual\nFocus so your brain and your body it's\nsuper important to understand this the\nonly part of your brain that is not in\nyour skull is your eyes your eyes are a\npart of your brain that are outside of\nyour actual skull and so the way to get\nyour brain to focus is it actually\nfollows your visual focus and the way a\nlot of neurologists think this comes\nfrom is is if you're if you and I are\nout hunting 100,000 years ago and we see\nan animal in the distance and we have to\nlook really far at that animal we're\nlooking and we're focusing on our eyes\nand seeing where's that thing going is\nit picking up smells from different\ndirections and we're using our eyes to\nsee every movement that that animal is\ndoing and what that's doing is\neventually telling our brain lock in\nlike be locked in and so your mental\nfocus will always follow your visual\nFocus so then you start to ask yourself\nhow can I get my visual Focus to lock in\nto tell my brain it's time to lock in\nand so really what it comes down to with\nthat being said is when you're sitting\ndown to focus let's say you're sitting\ndown to write your book right and you're\nsitting there and you're staring at the\ncursor just blinking what you want to do\nis actually try to you know you see your\nperipheral vision is you actually want\nto try to close your peripheral vision\noff and you want to look so intently at\nthe screen you got if you're listening\nto podcast you can't see my hands like\npeople on YouTube can but you're trying\nto actually get your visual Focus to be\njust the screen and everything else\noutside of the screen to be a little bit\nblurry almost as if you were taking like\na uh paper towel roll and you were\nlooking through your eyes through the\nlike you put it up to your eyes and\nyou're looking at that screen you're\ntrying to see nothing else and so one\nthing that actually works really well\nfor me you can try it if you want to you\ndon't have to but when I was writing the\nbook and I had to focus and I was trying\nto literally cancel out all of my visual\nfield except for the computer screen\nthis is it's kind of weird but I'm going\nto tell you the truth I would put on a\nhat and I would put on a hoodie over my\nhat so that the majority of my visual\nfield was completely canceled out by\neither my hat above or my hoodie on the\nsides so the only thing that I could see\nwas literally the screen in front of me\nbecause I'm trying to tell my brain\nthrough Visual Focus hey it's time to\nlock in it's time to get another\npomodora technique in we've got three\nmore pages we've got to write we've got\nto get this done and uh so that's really\nimportant and the other way that your\nmental focus follows your visual focus\nis that if you imagine like if you're\nsitting straight in your seat and you\njust imagine looking straight out at\nlevel where your eyes are not looking up\nnot looking down but just looking level\nwhen you look down below the the midline\nof the visual field there's actually\ncircuits in your brain that when you in\nyour eyes that when you look low like\nbelow the midline that are telling your\nbrain it's time to relax and so think\nabout how often do you sit on your phone\nand you're literally looking down on\nyour phone when you're trying to get\nsomething done or how often do you sit\ndown and you actually type with your\ncomputer and you're looking down at your\ncomputer so you have to realize when\nyou're looking below the midline of your\neyesight it's telling your brain to\nrelax it's actually making it harder to\nfocus so what do you want to do this is\nsomething that I have in my office\noffice at my house and my office in the\nstudio that I'm in right now I have an\nexternal monitor for both of my\nworkstations and that external monitor\nis above the midline of my visual field\nwhy because the same way that the below\nthe midline tells your brain to relax\nthe actual above the midline tells your\nbrain to focus is holy are you guys\nlistening to this you can use your eyes\nwhere you're looking how you're looking\nto tell your to make it easy to tell\nyour brain that it's time to lock in and\nstart to get focused and so what you\nwant to do is you want to have if\npossible an external monitor that is\nabove the midline like you don't have to\nhave it like up at the ceiling and\nyou're like looking at the ceiling but\njust a little bit above the midline so\nthat your eyes are above your eyes are\nthen telling your brain okay this thing\nis above our our midline so it's in the\nupper visual field it is close to us\nmaybe you're wearing a hoodie and a hat\nthese little cues are telling your brain\nit's time to turn on hey it's time to\nlock in and these are all this is all\njust so you know neurological scientific\nfact I have 73 cited studies inside of\nthis book so like I went hardcore into\nscience and neurology to make sure that\nI was literally learning about the brain\nfor how to take action and create the\nlife that we want to that's why I say\nit's like the manual for your mind and\nso what do you want to do you want to\nhave it above you know the external\nmonitor a little bit above the midline\nof your visual field and then the last\npiece is if possible have a bright light\nthat doesn't hurt your eyes but have a\nbright light that is above the external\nmonitor\nand so at the studio where I am right\nnow my monitor is literally at a window\nso that bright light is always coming in\nand at home I have a huge ring light\nthat is above that I turn on every\nsingle time why because there's uh\nthere's receptors in the bottom of your\neyes like the bottom sets of your eyes\nthat are called the basil ganglia and\nthose actually look up in the visual\nfield and they're looking up and they\nget obviously information from the Sun\nso when the Sun is up it tells your\nbrain to start to focus\nand so if you have white light it's\ntelling your brain that it needs to be\nfocused and it's not allowing your brain\nto create melatonin to make you tired\nand so these are just a few of the tips\nand tricks that you can use to actually\nget your brain to focus I have a lot\nmore that are inside of the book but\nthese are just some of the ones I want\nyou to think about the first one is\npomodora technique the when you're doing\nthe pomodora technique fight to get to\n25 minutes realize that your brain is\ngoing to resist when you sit down\nrealize that your your mental focus\nfollows your visual Focus so how can you\nuse these typ that I've just given you\nto allow yourself to at least make it\neasier for yourself to take the action\nthat you need to to create the action\ntake the action you need to to create\nthe life that you want and so use the\npomodora technique make sure you realize\nthat you're focusing in your eyes you're\nhaving a little bit of the midline you\nhave the correct lighting so that\nTherefore your brain goes hey it's time\nto turn on it's time to get some\ndone and so once again these are just\ntips and tricks from the book if you\nwant to go buy it it's called level up\nhow to get focused stop procrastinating\nupgrade your life uh there's a lot of\nscience that is in it CU ultimately I\njust want you to understand how your\nbrain works so that you can use your\nbrain to get out of your own way to take\nthe action that you need to to create\nthe life that you want so you can buy it\nanywhere that you buy books once again\nit's called level up and with that I'm\ngoing to leave you the same way I leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission make somebody else's day better\nI appreciate you and I hope that you\nhave an amazing day"
