    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to be talking with\nyou about the main thing that is most\nlikely holding you back in your life and\nit's probably the main thing that's\nholding most people back in their life I\nhear this all the time when I'm speaking\nwith people but in in self-development\nthe journey towards personal growth\ntowards evolution of yourself towards\ntransformation there's so many\nstrategies or so many tools there's so\nmany times where people like Rob I I\nwant to do this thing give me a strategy\ngive me a tip give me the secret sauce\nall of the things that you could do to\nquote unquote fix yourself right\nbut if I'm being honest I think the most\nprofound and transformative approach is\nnot doing something but it is to be more\nin a state of being and I'll explain\nwhat that means throughout this episode\nbut you are not a human doing you are a\nhuman being and it really comes down to\nthe approach of using acceptance as a\npractice\nand I'll explain what that means but\njust being in a radical State a state of\nradical acceptance acceptance is the key\nto unlocking your freedom your peace and\nyour fulfillment learning to accept the\nway that the world is learning to accept\nthe way that people are learning to\naccept what is in your bank account I\nget it it sounds ridiculously basic it\nis too basic it's too easy it can't work\nbut go with me today\ngo on this journey let me show you how\nto have more peace in your life that's\nreally what I want how to have more\npeace because when you can have more\npeace you can create more of what it is\nthat you want to create and so I want to\nstart off by giving you a quote so\nMichael J fox who you might know uh was\nan actor and he has Parkinson's and he\nhad a quote that he that he said was\nacceptance does not mean resignation it\nmeans understanding that something is\nwhat it is\nand there's got to be a way through it\nand so when I say accepting I don't mean\njust accepting and doing nothing about\nit sometimes I do mean that and in some\ncircumstances it's you must first accept\nbefore you can change and so whether\nyou're religious or not uh there's a\nthing called the I think it's called The\nSerenity Prayer that puts a lot of this\ninto perspective and it says God grant\nme the serenity to accept the things I\ncannot change the courage to change the\nthings I can and the wisdom to know the\ndifference now that's what most people\nknow but it's a little bit longer the\nrest of it is living one day at a time\nenjoying one moment at a time accepting\nhardships as the pathway to peace\nso accepting what you can't change\nchanging what you can and\nthe wisdom and know the difference but\nthen also living one day at a time\nenjoying one moment at a time and\naccepting hardships because there are a\nlot of hardships throughout life as a\npathway to peace which is what we're\ntalking about\nso then you really start to think about\nit\nand you start to think well peace what\nis what is disturbing my peace so think\nabout that as I ask you this question\nwhat is disturbing your piece right now\nis it your boss because he's an\nis it you know Nancy that's in HR you\nguys know Nancy and HR talk about all\nthe time is it that your husband's not\nthe way that you want it to be is it\nyour children are not doing what you\nwant them to do it is that your bank\naccount's not what you want it to be\nwhat is currently disturbing your peace\nwhat is it bring it up in the front of\nyour mind before I go any further\nand I'm going to tell you what's\nactually disturbing your piece is not\nthat situation it's not that person\nwhat's disturbing your peace is that you\nare resisting the way that reality is it\ndoesn't mean that you don't change your\ncircumstance if you can but it means\nthat you must first accept it before you\ncan change it it will help your mental\nhealth more than you know and I'm going\nto give you quite a few studies today to\nshow you that what I'm saying is not\njust a bunch of woo-wooy fluffy Duffy BS\nbut this is actually based in science\nyou need to get better at accepting\nreality\nfor you to have more peace in your life\nand so there was a study that was done\nin 2003 in the Journal of behavior\ntherapy and experimental Psychiatry that\ndelve into the effect of acceptance\nversus trying to control everything\nbecause one thing that I found is that a\nlot of us myself included are Control\nFreaks and we need to get better at\naccepting versus trying to control and\nchange everything\nand what they found in this study was\nthey compared the effects of acceptance\nbased and control based strategies on\nPanic symptoms in people and the results\nshowed that participants in the\nacceptance group reported panic-related\nsymptoms that were way less\nway less than the ones who had control\nrelated control related strategies and\nso what happened was when they taught\nthe the when they actually went and said\nhey guys this is how you accept\nand then everyone else they said hey\nthis is how you control the people who\nlearned how to accept had way less\nreported Panic related symptoms than\nthose that were in the group where they\nwere trying to control everything\nwhich reinforces the idea of the nature\nof acceptance it's better on your mental\nhealth it's also better in your physical\nhealth which we will talk about as well\nand so really like okay cool that sounds\ngreat Robert like what the hell is the\nnature of acceptance well the first step\ntowards embracing acceptance and\nunderstanding that it's truly just the\nway that it is it is my belief and you\ncan take this belief if you want to see\nif it you know try it on for see if it\nworks for you but it is my belief that\neverything in this universe is perfect\nas it currently is right now in this\nmoment now when I say perfect I want you\nto understand it does not mean that\neverything is as I want it to be most\nthings in this world are not what I want\nthem to be but I trust that I don't know\nwhat the I'm talking about and\nthere's probably something out there\nthat's smarter than me that put this\nentire universe together that maybe has\na plan that I just don't see the plan on\nbecause many things are not the way that\nI want them to be but I accept that I am\nnot intelligent enough to understand why\nthings are the way they are but I do\ntrust\nthat all is as it should be right now\nand I have a lot of proof looking back\non my entire life to prove to myself\nthat everything has worked out perfectly\nbased off the way I've perceived it so\nif I look back on my life there's many\nthings that I did not want to be how it\nwas I did not want my father to be an\nalcoholic when I was a kid I did not\nwant my dad to go to jail multiple times\nI did not want him to be to to get drunk\nand forget about me and not pick me up\nwhen he said he was going to I did not\nwant him to die but now that has been 22\nyears since he did pass I can see how\nall of it\nwas so ridiculously perfect\nsee that I would not do what I do now\nI would not have the strong desire to\nhelp people out of their suffering had I\nnot been in a really deep state of\nsuffering for a long long part of my\nlife I would not be able to teach people\nhow to get out of suffering if I did not\nget myself out of it as well\nhey if you're loving this episode do me\na favor give us a like down below for\nthe YouTube algorithm and if you have\nsome stuff that you want me to cover\nsometime in the future stuff that you\nmight want me to talk about put the\ntopics Down Below in the comments I'll\ncheck them out and just maybe in the\nfuture you're going to see me talk about\nan episode with a topic that you put\ndown below if you look back on the\nhardest moments of your life usually you\ndon't want to be going through them and\nyou would not want to go through them\nagain but you probably can look at it if\nit's been long enough and go yeah I\ndon't want ever want to go through that\nagain but I can see how I needed to go\nthrough I can see how it's perfect I can\nsee how it was a perfectly crafted\ncurriculum for me to grow into who I\nneeded to be\nbecause if you fast forward long enough\nyou can see how it all worked out\nperfect the problem is I think us as\nhumans we think too much in the short\nterm we think in the right now I've\nbought it to be different now and not\naccepting reality as it is is a mental\nand emotional block\nand these are mental and emotional\nblockages that restrict us from having\nthis free flow of life\nall of our past experiences all of our\njudgments our likes our dislikes our\npreferences are just constricted\nversions of ourself limiting our ability\nto really live life fully and if you\ncan't get past those blockages that are\nin your mind they don't even physically\nexist in reality you cannot become the\ngreatest version of yourself you can\nonly become the greatest version of your\nlimited self which you're creating that\nlimited self in your mind and so when\nyou recognize these blockages that are\nthat are holding you back these fears\nthese limiting beliefs these blockages\nthat are there and you understand their\nimpact you can start to go man okay if I\ncan actually just accept a little bit\nmore maybe my life will be better\nbecause the problem is never the\nsituation that you're in the problem is\nnever the circumstances you're there in\nthat you're in the problem is the way\nthat you are thinking about the\ncircumstance that you're in\nthe problem is not that your parents\naren't the way that you want it to be\nthe problem is that you're creating\nanother problem by resisting the way\nthat they are versus just saying I\naccept they are this way they do stress\nme out they do kind of piss me off the\nproblem is not that you're\nyour boyfriend or girlfriend or your\nspouse is not the way acting the way\nthat you want to the problem is that\nyou're wanting to change them to be what\nyou want them to be\nand so it's creating all of these mental\nblockages inside of you and the amount\nof Stress and Anxiety you feel in your\nlife will be in direct proportion to how\nmuch you're resisting the way that\nreality is you're not seeing reality as\nit currently is you're seeing it as you\nwant it to be oh I want it to be\ndifferent I want to be different I want\nto be different you cannot change\nanything though until you fully accept\nit and so the more that you want\nsomething to be different and the more\nthat you're resisting it the more stress\nthe more anxiety you will feel which\nmeans the less peace that you're going\nto feel\nand if you think about it we're always\nthinking of like I want this to be\ndifferent because based off of my past\nor I want this to be different in my\nfuture\nthe present moment is all you truly have\nyou know how often do you find yourself\nin conflict between what you want and\nwhat you currently have oh I want more\nmoney you don't have the money oh I want\na better relationship you don't have\nbetter relationship oh I want them to be\ndifferent but you don't have they're not\ndifferent right we're always in this\nconstant conflict of wanting it to be\ndifferent wanting things to change\nand this conflict really creates a lot\nof resistance inside of us it creates a\nlot of suffering inside of us and so\nwhat we need to get better at is\npracticing the acceptance in the moment\nand when we do we can actually accept\nand we can see it as it truly is versus\nseeing it as we think that it is and it\nreally starts to bring if I'm being\nhonest with you it sounds fluffy Duffy I\nget it but there's been a lot of in\nmy life for the past couple years that\nhas been the exact opposite of what I\nwant\nand when I resist it and when I resist\nit I get pissed and I get mad\nand I get I get I gotta fix this and I\nfeel so much stress and anxiety in my\nbody when I get pissed off about the way\nthings are but when I look at them and I\nsay okay\nyeah it is that way\noh it is that way\nand I start to accept it even if it's\nnot what I want it to be it brings so\nmuch more peace into my mind to bring so\nmuch more peace into my body versus\nfighting against what is\nbecause fighting against what end causes\nit costs like this internal tightness\nit's like a mental straight jacket that\nyou put yourself in and it starts to\nmanifest in physical ailments it can be\nsoreness it could be tightness it could\nbe disease you know there's a study in\n1982 in General Hospital Psychiatry it\nwas an outpatient program and uh in\nBehavioral Medicine for chronic pain\npatients so they brought in a bunch of\npeople who had a whole bunch of chronic\npain and they taught them mindfulness\nand radical acceptance\nso they had chronic pain that they could\nnot get rid of\nand they taught them mindfulness\nand radical acceptance so huh what did\nthey find well results showed that\npatients who participated in the program\nexperienced significant reduction in\ntheir pain in their body\nand their psychological symptoms that\ncame with it hold on what the did I\njust say let's say it again okay what\nthey did was they took people who had\nchronic pain which means that the pain\nwas there every single day it wasn't\ngoing away and they probably tried a\nbunch of other things to get there to\ntry to get out of it they probably tried\npayment against you tried a bunch of\nother stuff right and they taught them\nmindfulness and radical acceptance okay\nhippie well what happened they\nexperienced significant reductions in\ntheir chronic pain in their body\nwhich means that the Mind influences the\nbody and significant reductions in their\npsychological symptoms as well\nthe study showed that just by accepting\nand having mindfulness practices it\nended up helping people have less\nchronic pain in their body and less\npsychological symptoms that's pretty\nwild huh are there any other studies Rob\nyes there are here's another one in 1998\nin the New England Journal of Medicine\nthe study found how chronic stress can\nresult from prolonged psychological\nresistance\nwhich can lead to psychological changes\nin the body or sorry physiological\nchanges in the body\nthese changes can contribute to various\nhealth problems including cardiovascular\ndisease diabetes and weaken immune\nsystem function so hold on hold on hold\non let me just talk about that one more\ntime so in the New England Journal of\nMedicine they actually went through and\ntried to figure out how chronic stress\ncan be a result of psychological\nresistance\nwhich can lead to physiological change\nin the body and the studies that they\nfound was that their resistance that\npeople had in their mind to reality\ncontributed to various health problems\nincluding cardiovascular disease\ndiabetes and a weakened immune system\nso we're causing not only mental\nproblems by resisting the way the world\nis we're causing we're causing physical\nproblems in our body in dis-ease our\nbody is not at ease it is at a state of\ndis-ease\nby not accepting\nand so what we're really trying to do is\nwe're really trying to understand like\nyou are an incredibly powerful being and\nmost people were not taught how I mean\nwe're not really taught about how\npowerful we actually are and when you\nuse mental and physical energy to resist\nyou're blocking and restricting what you\ncould create\nif you could understand how powerful of\na crater you are\nwith that mind you can also create more\nresistance in your body you can also\ncreate more dis ease in your body or you\ncan use that energy to create whatever\nit is that you actually want to create\nand so what you've got to start to do is\nyou've got to start to challenge\nyourself the mind has many patterns it\nhas many habits and it often resists\nchange you might that's why they say\nmisery loves company you might have been\nresisting and resisting and putting\nyourself in a misery for so long that\neven though you don't want it\nyou're like it's comfortable for me\nthough\nand so you've got to practice acceptance\nI listen I understand\nif you would have told me to start\npracticing acceptance five years ago I'd\nhave been like shut up dude that doesn't\nmake any sense get out of my face let me\nwork let me get stuff done I'm gonna fix\neverything I'm gonna fix my problems but\nyou have to recognize\nthe resistance is just another pattern\nof your mind\nand so by challenging this resistance\nand committing to the practice of\nacceptance we can experience a little\nbit of a shift in ourselves a little bit\nof a transformation and so what you can\nstart to do is you start to challenge\nyour thoughts\nchallenge your resistance so in\ncognitive behavioral therapy they teach\nsomething that's called testing the\nvalidity of a thought and so whenever\nyou have a thought that you notice is\ncausing resistance inside of you or your\nresistance towards somebody\nif you're thinking negative\nis there a chance is there a chance just\na tiny glimmer of chance that there\ncould be some positive but you're not\nallowing yourself to see it\ncan you pretend that you're on the\ndebate team and once you notice a\nthought that is not accepting that is\nresisting can you debate the other side\ncan you look at it and say okay I'm\nresisting I'm I'm pissed off about this\nI'm pissed off about the way that\nthey're acting I'm pissed off because\nthings are not the way that I want them\nto be\ncan you look at the other side and say\nhuh is there a way that I could debate\nthis\nis there a way that in the grand scheme\nof my entire life that what's happening\nto me right now is perfect and I'm just\nresisting the thing that is perfect in\nfront of you in front of me\nif you remind yourself of how everything\nworks out perfectly which we talked\nabout earlier\nthen we can look at things and say okay\nthis isn't what I want it to be but I\ntrust that it's perfect and I accept the\ncurrent reality\nso I have a challenge for you today and\nfor today's episode\nis I want you to try a powerful strategy\nto cultivate acceptance and I want you\nto to practice total acceptance for the\nnext 24 hours when this episode ends for\nthe next 24 hours I want you to just\npractice radical acceptance you come in\nand your boss is just a\nfreaking a-hole\nhey dude he's an a-hole that's just the\nway that he is just radically accept it\ndon't get caught up in his story don't\nget caught up in his emotions that's not\nfor you to put on oh look at look at\nJohn look at Tim look at George whatever\nhis name is oh he's just being the way\nthat he is again cool I'm not going to\ntake that on it's not for me to take on\nbecause acceptance is really like a\nmuscle\nit gets stronger the more that you work\nat it resistance is also like a muscle\nand you might have really really strong\nresistance muscles and really really\nweak acceptance muscles well let's stop\nresisting as much let's let that weak\nlet's weaken that muscle and let's start\nto practice the acceptance\nyou might just find that right now your\nacceptance muscles are very weak and so\nfor the next 24 hours I want you to just\nradically accept everything I want you\nto expect accept every single aspect of\nyour life I want you to accept your\nemotions your thoughts your physical\nSensations your external circumstances\neveryone that's around you your bank\naccount your relationships\ndoing so you kind of remove a lot of\nblockages you start to feel a little bit\nmore in flow with life because you're\nnot having those barriers of resistance\nthat you're creating\nand you can practice that\nand it will help your mental health way\nmore than you know how will it help well\nthere was a study in 2006 it was called\nthe acceptance and commitment therapy\nand they found that acceptance and\ncommitment like being except being\ncommitted to the accepting\nacceptance of committed therapy it's Act\nis what they called it emphasize the\nacceptance and psychological flexibility\nthat people could have in the study they\nfound that learning to accept all that\nis is effective in treating various\ndisorders including depression and\nanxiety so by learning to accept you're\nactually helping yourself with your\nmental health\nso when you actually start to think of\nthis you realize that acceptance is not\njust being passive and just resigning to\noh it is the way that it is it's really\nquite a powerful practice that leads you\nto being more free that leads you to\nmore peace that leaves you more growth\nand if you do decide to accept you can\naccept something and then you can say\nyou know what but I do have control to\nchange it like for instance your bank\naccount\nyou can accept that you don't have the\nmoney that you want your bank account\nthat's the way the world is but if you\nfight it it's like it's not gonna change\nyour bank account by resisting it is it\nno that'd be awesome if you did because\nI'd have a lot more in my bank account\nby how much I've resisted over my entire\nlife but if you think about if you're\nlike resisting how much is in your bank\naccount and stressing out over is not\ngoing to change it but if you can accept\nit first and say okay\nI'm broke as hell I've been there before\nI I remember I went back and looked at\nyears and years ago I went into my my\nBank of America account and saw that\nwithin three months I had 11\nnon-sufficient fund charges\n11 in three months I've been there\nbefore resisting that there's not money\nis not going to create more money but\nyou can accept it okay this is the way\nthat the reality is right now and then\nyou can say what am I going to do though\nI'm going to take actions to change it\nand you really start to understand that\nby having total acceptance and being in\nthe present moment and challenging your\nmind and challenging your resistance you\ncan start to find your potential you can\nstart to have more peace and so as we go\nthrough this this world this journey\nthat we're in\nremember just to accept a little bit\nmore that's one of the biggest keys to\nyour transformation is learning to\naccept and to stop resisting\nso that's what I got for you for
