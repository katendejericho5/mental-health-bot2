    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout communication I'm going to give\nyou three-step process to be a better\nCommunicator I'm going to teach you\nprobably the most important skill that\nyou can have for deepening your\nconnection to other people and part of\nthat key is love but it's not the love\nthat you're actually thinking of and so\nwe've all heard it when you think about\nit communication is the number one key\nfor any relationship it really is\nactually communicating with somebody\nopenly honestly but more than just\ncommunicating is also listening it's\nlike that phrase you were given two ears\nin one mouth because you should be\nlistening twice as much as you speak but\nif it's the number one key to\nrelationships it's the number one key to\nyour romantic relationships to your\nfriendships to your family to your\nchildren any other breathing human so if\nthey can fog a cup because they're\nbreathing this will deepen your\nconnection with them which is really one\nof the most beautiful parts of the human\nexperience is being able to have a deep\nconnection with another human and I\ntruly believe that one of the reasons\nwhy so many relationships fail is\nbecause lack of open honest\ncommunication between both parties of\npeople in that relationship and so the\nproblem with that though is that we're\nnot really taught how to communicate\nwith people sure you can go and you can\nlearn how to be a public speaker but\nbeing a public speaker is not going to\nmake you better at communicating with\nyour wife and so the problem is we're\nnot really taught that and to be honest\nwith you most of our parents are not\nreally great communicators some of them\nare but most of them are not because\nit's not something that's really taught\nit's not something that you're born with\neither it's a skill set and human\nconnection is amazing so why don't we at\nleast try to get better at it so let's\ndive into it let's start to talk about\nit the way that I see communication as I\njust mentioned just a second ago is\ncommunication is a skill it is not\nsomething like oh I'm just not a great\ncommunicator I wasn't born with it no\nit's not a talent it takes practice for\nme I have gotten much better at\ncommunicating once I realized how\nterrible of a communicator I was in my\nfamily we weren't great communicators we\ndidn't talk about things as much we\ndidn't talk about emotions and so as I\ngot older and I started having\nrelationships and I started whether\nthose were relationships with you know\nother women or having a relationship\nwith people who are working in the\noffice that I was running I realized\nthat if I want to grow as a person\ngrow in my romantic relationships but\nalso grow in a as a business and a\nleader communication is something I\nreally need to master I need to get\nbetter at and I was a terrible\ncommunicator but now I feel like it's\nsomething I really have a grasp on and I\nreally understand deep communication\nwith another human and so what we're\ngoing to be talking about is the three\nsteps the three keys to communication\nwith someone else and this was actually\ncreated by Carol Comfort who is a PhD\nand it's an acronym and the acronym is\nLuv so when I reference and I said it's\nabout love it's not l-o-v-e it's\nactually an acronym that is l-u-v-e I'm\nsorry l-u-v it's three l u v and so\nwe'll go through each one of them the L\nstands for listen and this is a really\nimportant part to listen with no need to\nrespond with your opinions or your input\nin any sort of way because empathetic\npresence is the act of being fully\npresent with another person not just\nphysically but also emotionally and\nmentally as well\nI think that listening is a skill set\nonce again another skill set that we\nreally need to try to get better at it\nmeans setting aside your own thoughts\nsetting aside your judgment setting\naside your beliefs that were possibly\ningrained into you by your parents or\nyour religion or whatever it might be\nsetting aside those setting aside the\ndistractions and be entirely with the\nother person\none of the things that that you start to\nlearn as you start to become more of a\nleader and work in leadership positions\nand especially as a coach in the\nindustry that I'm in is the act of\nholding space for somebody holding space\nfor someone to actively speak whatever\nis on their mind without any judgment\nbut in a state of love where they can\nsay whatever is that they want and to\nfeel like you know what I feel safe like\ndon't we all want someone to look at us\nand say I feel safe in the presence of\nthem so that I can fully Express exactly\nwhat's going on and not feel like I have\nto hold back we all want to create that\nfeeling for other people but how often\ndo we throw our beliefs and judgments on\ntop of somebody when they're\ncommunicating and then they don't feel\nsafe actually communicating with us\nand so it's about listening and getting\nbetter at listening you know in the\nreally fast-paced world that we live in\ndistractions are everywhere as well and\nso being fully present with someone\nshows that you you value them it shows\nthat you respect them and so it's about\neye contact it's about communication\nwhich we'll talk about as well but also\njust put your damn phone away like it\nbugs me when I go to when I go to dinner\nand I see people on their phones at\ndinner I'm like could you just put it\naway for a little while like I\nunderstand sometimes there's emergencies\nand stuff but can we at least be present\nwith somebody if you go to a coffee shop\nwith a friend and you have your phone\nyou can leave it on the the counter or\nyou could leave it in your purse\nwhichever one you want you could put in\nyour pocket you could put it on the seat\nnext to you so that therefore there are\nno distractions so that the thing that\nit it subconsciously communicates to the\nother person that I'm here I'm listening\nI'm present with you nothing else in\nthis world matters at this point and so\nbeing fully present with that person\nwith someone shows that you value them\nit shows that you respect them and what\nit really does is it creates a safe\nspace for the other person to feel seen\nand to feel heard and I don't know about\nyou but I really want to try to master\nthe art of making somebody feel like\nbeing in the presence of me and be able\nto tell me whatever the they want\nto tell me is a safe space without my\njudgment without my opinions without my\nbeliefs any of that you can tell me\nwhatever it is and I won't judge you\nthat is a state of love that's a state\nof unconditional love which is a state\nthat we all want to try to be in we all\nwant to try to portray which it's really\nhard to get into that but sometimes it\nrequires us just listening just being\nwith that person not judging them and to\nput away all of the distractions like\nphones computers other devices make eye\ncontact with them head uh you know head\nnods and and show that you're you're\nwith the person every step of the way\nthe most value that you can give someone\nin a conversation\nyou may have never heard this before the\nmost values you can give someone a\nconversation is not\ntips on how to get better it's not\ntrying to fix them\nthe most value that you can give someone\na conversation is silence\ninteresting right you ever thought of\nthat one silence I don't know if you've\never been in a conversation with\nsomebody and they're just a freaking\ntalker and they talk and talk and talk\nand talk and they're talking about\nthemselves they're talking about\nthemselves and you rarely say any words\nyou barely say anything and at the end\nthey're like\nthat was such a good conversation and\nyou're like I didn't say anything\nwhat you did was you gave them space and\na lot of times people just don't have\nspace they don't feel like they have a\nsafe space to be seen and heard and so\nit's about listening to them without\njudgments and as a guy as a guy me as a\nguy who wants to fix things and me also\nas a coach who knows how to help people\nfix things it can be really hard not to\ntry to fix someone but it really comes\ndown to allowing them to express and\nmake them feel seen and heard without oh\nman if I say this to Rob is he going to\ntry to fix me\ndon't try to fix read the book if men\nand women should read the book Men Are\nfrom Mars Women Are from Venus because\nit talks about communication Styles and\nhow we're both so different which I'll\ntalk about in just a few minutes as well\nbut listening is really a skill and\nthere are differences between way and\nyou know I don't want to vastly over\ngeneralize which I I'm going to but men\nand women tend to communicate\ndifferently than than each other and so\nyou know sometimes I'll give you a\nreally good example and I did this on a\npodcast episode a few months ago where I\nwas talking about the difference between\nlittle boys and little girls they've\ndone studies on little boys and little\ngirls and they found that when they had\na they had them in a school room\nthey were inside of it and they were at\ntheir desks and they were watching them\nthrough you know a wall that was\nactually just a mirror and they were\nwatching little boys and little girls\ncommunicate what they found was the\nmajority of time little boys would\ncommunicate by sitting in the desk\nfacing the front when the teacher wasn't\nthere facing the front shoulder to\nshoulder talking while looking in the\nsame direction but what was interesting\nis that little girls they actually\nturned towards each other so they would\nturn their chairs completely and square\nup their shoulders and then you know\nwe're going to talk about a second which\nis how to actually verbally and and\nphysically communicate that you're\nlistening but a lot of times little boys\ndon't give verbal and physical cues that\nthey're listening\nlittle girls tend to be really good with\nhead knots they tend to be good with\nsaying aha okay talking back and so it's\na lot of times when like men you know\nyou may have been with your wife before\nor your girlfriend before and she's like\nyou're not listening to me and you're\nlike what are you talking about I just\nheard everything that she said it might\nbe that they don't feel like you're\nlistening because they're not getting\nthe verbal and the the verbal and\nphysical cues from you and so it's about\njust understanding how each person\ncommunicates and trying to get onto\ntheir level of communication because we\nreally want them to feel like they can\ntalk and say what they need to say\nand then the last tip I'll give you\nunder listening is really interesting uh\nmy very first coach that I have when I\nwas 19 recommended trying this and it's\npretty insane is when someone stops you\ndon't have to do this all the time but\nwhen someone stops and you feel like\nthey're really big into saying something\nor they're really deep or they're about\nto go deeper allow three seconds of\nSilence before you respond\nwhat's really interesting is that a lot\nof times we listen to somebody and then\nimmediately we say what we want to say\nwhich shows that we weren't even\nlistening fully in the first place\nbecause we were so busy talking about\nwhat we wanted like thinking about what\nwe wanted to talk about but when you\nallow the space what usually happens is\nthe person will start talking again and\nwhat that shows is that they start going\ndeeper and they give you more details of\nthe situation they give you more of what\nthey're feeling and more details the\nstory and so just try to listen and\ndon't try to respond for another three\nseconds so as soon as someone stops\ntalking one Mississippi two Mississippi\nthree Mississippi then you can talk and\nthat gives you the space to be able to\ndo it so the first part of communication\nis L which is listen Okay so the next\npart is you which is understand while we\ncan convey that we're understanding what\nsomeone's saying through words we can\nalso convey that we understand what\nthey're saying but we're also listening\nthrough non-verbal cues like body\nlanguage uh tone facial expressions all\nof those often carry the emotional\nweight of the conversation for the\nperson to feel like we're also listening\nto them as well and so there's verbal\nand there's non-verbal and I remember\nwhen I was when I was little not really\nlittle but I guess when I was younger my\nmanager at the time was really good at\ndeveloping people and even though there\nwere women in the company that I was in\nand there were women managers he was the\nnumber one developer of female leaders\nand I was like Jeff what do you what are\nyou doing like what is what's the\ndifference and he's like what I try to\ndo is I try to tailor my communication\nstyle based off of who's sitting in\nfront of me I try to tailor it to them I\ntry to listen the way that they want me\nto listen to them I try to give them\nverbal and non-verbal cues though that\nI'm listening to them and sometimes with\nmales who are overly aggressive or more\nmasculine I communicate in a completely\ndifferent way sometimes when I'm with\nfemales who happen to be very feminine I\ncommunicate in a completely different\nway because he wanted to be the way he\nexplained to me is he wanted to be a\ncommunication chameleon he wanted to be\nable to go to any type of person and he\nwas so damn good at communicating you\nwant to go to any person and make them\nfeel like they were seen they were heard\nand that he could communicate with them\non their level\nand so a lot of times it's not about\nbeing a chameleon it's about like I'm\ngoing to talk the way that I want to\ntalk and I'm going to be the way that I\nwant to be really what it comes down to\nis can we change around a little bit to\nmake people feel like we're on the same\nlevel and um it comes down to to head\nnods it comes down to squaring up your\nshoulders it comes down to verbal cues\nlike uh-huh yeah it comes down to\nreflecting back sometimes what what we\nnotice that they're saying to us it\ncould be facial expressions with the re\nreflecting back it could be repeating\nback to them to make them know that\nyou're listening to them and\nunderstanding and it's not about being a\nparent and just saying what they just\nsaid but it's like oh okay so so what\nyou're saying is dot dot dot or okay so\nif I understand this correctly dot dot\ndot and you kind of go into that and\nallow them to be like oh man this\nperson's fully listening to me now mind\nyou when I say men can communicate this\nway women communicate this way once\nagain that is a generalization there's\nvery large spectrums of the way people\ncommunicate it's more of like the\nmasculine energy and The Feminine energy\nit doesn't necessarily mean men and\ndoesn't necessarily mean women I have a\nreally good friend who is a male but he\ncommunicates\nand and more of what they call quote\nunquote feminine way and he's also\nreally really really good at\ncommunicating with women and making them\nfeel safe but he's also really good when\nhe needs to of turning himself also into\na chameleon and speaking to men the way\nthat men speak or you know masculine way\nof speaking and so it's it's not about\njust men and women I don't always want\nit to be that way it's more of like\nthere's masculine ways of being there's\nfeminine ways of being and all of us\nhave uh those aspects in us but we just\ntend to communicate more of a masculine\nmore of a feminine way and once you\nstart to understand the way that it is\nyou can start to reflect back to people\nso that they feel like you're listening\nto them so they know that you're\nlistening so once again that's the head\nknots that's the ahas that's the eye\ncontact that's the body language all of\nthese show that you're listening to them\nand show that you're present but more\nthan anything else what I think is the\nmost important thing it makes the person\nfeel seen and makes the person feel\nheard one of the things that I've\nrealized and learned over the past\ncouple years is that\nso many people\nin this world are just starving for\nsomeone to hear them to make them feel\nseen to make them feel heard to make\nthem feel like they're understood in\nmore than anything else to make them\nfeel like their emotions are valid\nbecause all too often people will say\nsomething that is the truth to them and\nthen they completely get invalidated by\nsomebody else's opinion or someone\nelse's belief so it's important for us\nto try to build the skill set of making\npeople feel seen and making people feel\nlike their emotions are valid which then\ngo into the V which is validate the\nvalidate side of it is oh I completely\nunderstand tell me more about that oh\nyou know what I completely see where\nyou're coming from because you have to\nrealize that everybody is looking\nthrough the world through their own\nspecific lens based off of their\nchildhood based off of their upbringing\nif you had the exact same body as them\nyou were born into the exact same\ncircumstances in every single instance\nof your life was the same as theirs you\nwould be exactly the same way that they\nare and you have to understand that they\nare leaving the way they're perceiving\nthe world based off of the way that\nthey've been raised and everything\nthat's ever happened to them which means\nthat perception is reality they are\nliving in a reality based off of how\nthey are perceiving it so by validating\nsomeone else's feelings or experiences\nit doesn't mean that you're necessarily\nagreeing with them\nthat's the important thing you could\nhave judgments and beliefs that are\ncompletely opposite of somebody but you\ncan also validate their feelings or\nexperiences at the same time it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you're agreeing\nwith them but it acknowledges that the\nother person's perspective is legitimate\nand that you can understand where\nthey're coming from\nand part of the validation is stop\ntrying to fix everyone I have done this\nbefore where I was like I'm Mr Fix It\nlots of guys do this in relationships\nwith women where it's like oh you're\ncrying about this let's fix this thing\nand it's more about like sometimes\npeople sometimes people do want\nsomething fixed sometimes they just want\nto be validated then it really comes\ndown to a really great question that can\nhelp you out with this\nis you know this has really helped me\nout in my relationship if my wife comes\nup to me and she's going through some\nthings\nI can I I immediately as being a coach\nfor 17 years can go oh I see exactly\nwhat the problem is I'm gonna go ahead\nand tell you this so you can fix it\nsometimes that's what she wants\nsometimes she doesn't so I can ask this\nquestion when whenever she comes and\nexpresses something as I say Hey listen\ndo you want my help with this or do you\njust want to hug\nand it's it shows in that moment like\nokay I do actually want someone to\nbounce ideas off of or you know what I'm\njust coming to vent and express and I\njust want you to to see and hear me and\ndon't try to fix me and so you know stop\ntrying to be the Savior it's called The\nSavior complex but I'm gonna fix every\nsingle person you know men and women we\nmany of us have the Savior complex so is\nit is it that you want to be you know\nyou want my help in this situation or do\nyou just want to hug and it allows you\nto kind of figure out where they are\nanother thing that really helps with\nvalidation is is ask questions to them\nif you if you see that and you see\nsomeone's going through something to\nhelp them validate their experiences ask\nthem questions to deeper understand them\nwhat else are they going through what\nelse is going on tell me more about that\nyou know you can start to allow them to\ngo deeper ask questions to allow them to\ncome out and actually start to see\nwhat's going on and and sometimes we\nwant to fix somebody but sometimes we\ncan help somebody find their own\nsolutions by asking questions helping\nsomebody grow is not necessarily about\ntaking away their pain\nbut sometimes it's about helping them\nsuffer less you know pain is going to\nhappen that is part of being a human\nsuffering is taking the pain and pulling\nit with you into the future into the\nfuture so it's like you know if your\nfriend uh was dumped seven months ago\nand she is still suffering from that\nbreakup that's not pain anymore that's\nsuffering she's pulling the breakup with\nher into the present moment and so\nreally what it comes down to is we can\nstart out instead of saying hey this is\nyour problem why don't you ask some\nquestions around it hey what do you\nthink of when you think that what do you\nfeel is holding you back in this is\nthere a reason why you feel like you\nhaven't gotten past this yet are you\ntaking some time for yourself each\nmorning to like fill your cup work on\nyour own reading or personal development\nor or self-love\ninstead of saying hey you should work\nout more you should wake up you should\nmeditate it's like hey are you are you\nworking on yourself are you giving\nyourself space to learn and grow have\nyou been meditating and just kind of see\nif they can make their own connections\nbecause if you if you could tell\nsomebody something and and give them\nadvice or you could ask them questions\nwhen you ask them questions and they\ncome to their own actual solution\nthey're 10 times more likely to remember\nit simply because their brain had to\ncreate new neural Pathways to get there\nbut once again even if you don't agree\nwith them you still need to make sure\nthat you try to validate them they did\nthe best every single person is doing\nthe best with what they had even if they\ndid terrible and so it's about bringing\nthat compassion that understanding as\nwell because we all just want to be\nunderstood and so really what it comes\ndown to is I did an episode a few weeks\nago on how to be a better Communicator\nif you want to know how to speak better\ngo back and listen to that one but\nreally this side is how to become a\nbetter listener to understand somebody\nto validate them to make them feel loved\nl-o-v-e-d so that's what I
