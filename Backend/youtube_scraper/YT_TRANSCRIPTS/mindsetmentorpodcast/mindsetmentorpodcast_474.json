    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout nine things that you should stop\ndoing immediately right this second if\nyou want to make your life better you\nneed to stop doing these nine things\nready Let's uh go ahead and dive into it\nthe first one number one stop making\nexcuses excuses are like buttholes\neveryone's got one and they all stink\nexcuses are never never beneficial for\nour life and I can tell you as someone\nwho used to make a lot of excuses I used\nto be like a professional excuse maker\nlike I was I I'm pretty damn good at it\nI I remember a conversation I had with\nmy very first mentor and um\nI've shared this many times in the\npodcast before in the past\nand I had I had many conversations with\nmy mentor my my one-on-one coach when I\nwas younger over the course of two years\nand I don't remember a whole lot that he\nsaid specifically I remember he helped\nme out a lot and he changed my life in\nmany different ways but I don't remember\nspecific advice but I do remember one\nspecific piece of advice I kept showing\nI wouldn't hit my assignments every\nsingle week I would show up late almost\nevery single week I had certain things I\nneeded to do and the sales company I was\nin I'd be like well I got like 75 there\nI was supposed to make 100 calls but I\nmade you know 70 calls and I would make\nso many excuses and at one point in time\nhe just kind of got pissed at me and\njust told me like it is and he said\nyou know the problem with you is the way\nthat you're living you're making excuses\nfor everything you're always making\nexcuses to why you didn't do this why\nyou didn't do that and one thing that he\nsaid is he said and you've probably\nheard this story before if you've been\nlistening for a while he said\num if a business succeeds and a a big\nCorporation succeeds and all of the\nemployees are heading in the same\ndirection and they they end up doing\nexactly what they wanted to do whose\nfault is it to get the entire company on\nboard and to get it to succeed and I was\nlike I guess that's the the CEO's fault\nhe's like okay if the business fails\nwhose fault is it I said that's the\nCEO's fault he said okay so\ntaking that frame if you go to the end\nof your life and you didn't do what you\nwant to do you didn't have the love\nhappiness joy success that you wanted to\nwhose fault would that be I was like\nthat'd be that would be my fault he said\nbut if you do get the end of your life\nand you have the joy the happiness the\npeace everything that you wanted you've\nhad success you had money you had\nhappiness love you're surrounded by\neverything that you wanted and there's\npeople around your deathbed that just\nlove you whose fault is that I was like\nthat's my fault he said the problem is\nyou're not treating your life like the\nCEO of your life if when your life will\nreally change when you decide to stop\nmaking excuses you step up to a plate\nyou say everything is my fault and I'm\ngoing to get it done and so that was a\nlife-changing piece of advice for me\nwhen I was 20 years old and that's the\nbiggest thing that I can share with you\non excuses you have to step into the\ndriver's seat you have to be the CEO of\nyour life and you have to say I'm not\ngoing to make any more excuses because\nexcuses are never beneficial for my\nfuture so that's the first one stop\nmaking excuses step number two stop\nplaying the victim\nI see too many people playing the victim\nthey act like that that their problems\nin life are because of someone else's\nactions oh I'm not where I want to be\nbecause of my parents I'm not where I\nwant to be because of my boss I'm not I\ndon't have as much money as I want\nbecause I went through the wrong career\nbecause my parents told me to go for\nthat career and get that degree and they\nblame everybody else for why they're not\nwhere they want oh I'm not in the shape\nthat I want to be because of my genes\nI'm not a shape that I want to be\nbecause because you know the the gym is\ntoo far away and all too often we're\nplaying the victim we're trying to blame\noutside of us because it's easy to to\nblame outside of us because that\nrequires us not to step into the\ndriver's seat of our life and to say oh\nyeah you know what I'm in the place that\nI'm in because of somebody else and that\ndoesn't put you into a place of control\nand most people that I know and I've\nworked with over years have control\nproblems so if you want to be in a place\nof control\nstop playing the victim start saying\neverything that is happening in my life\nI guess this deal is very similar to\nmaking excuses everything that is\nhappening in my life is my fault and if\nsomething's going to change I have to be\nthe one to change it that takes you from\nbeing the victim of your life in the\nperson who's just the victim all the\ntime so the person who's writing the\nstory it takes you from victim to author\nand you get to author your story and say\nI'm going from this moment on going to\nbe the author of my story and create the\nlife that I want and so number two is\nstop playing victim don't pull the\nvictim card out so much number three\nreally simple but it's simple to say but\nnot simple to do is to stop complaining\nstop complaining instead of looking for\nSolutions you can you can use the same\nmental energy that you would to complain\nabout circumstances as you could to\nactually find the solutions and so if\nyou want to get better at finding\nSolutions there's something I want to\ntalk to you about called the 131 method\n131 means that one there is a problem\n3 means I'm going to come up with three\npossible solutions I'm going to write\nthem down with pen and paper I'm going\nto say these are three possible\nsolutions and then the last one so one\nthree one is I'm going to find the one\nthat I like the most and I'm going to go\nyou know what out of all the three\npossible solutions I think this one is\nthe best one for me to go go for I'm\ngoing to take action on this one right\nhere and so it comes down to finding the\nproblem coming up with three possible\nsolutions and executing on the one that\nyou feel is your absolute favorite out\nof all of them and if that works it\nworks if it doesn't go to another one of\nthe solutions and what you do is instead\nof complaining about your circumstance\nyou say you know what I'm going to find\na solution I'm going to execute on\nSolutions and I'm going to take control\nof my life that's number three number\nfour\nstop being afraid of failure I did a a\nlive last night we were you know live\nwith about 1500 people and we were\ntalking about my book and one of the\nchapters in my book level up is about\nfear and I said hey everybody go ahead\nand put your biggest fear in the world\ndown not like spiders not you know being\nalone not\num Heights any of that type of stuff\nlike what's the biggest thing that's\nholding you back I would say like 90 85\n90 of them were the fear of failure stop\nbeing afraid of it failure is your\ngreatest teacher avoiding failure is one\nof the biggest things that holds people\nback the most successful people want to\nfail and they want to fail as fast as\npossible it's like the the phrase fail\nforward you fail as quickly as possible\nso that you can see what works what\ndoesn't work and fail as often as\npossible so you can fail forward by\nusing failure as an actual means to\nlearn to grow to get better because the\nfaster that you can fail\nthe more likely you are to find and the\nfaster you are going to actually succeed\nand so if you're avoiding failure you're\nalso avoiding success because success is\na part of failure failure and success\nare not the opposite they're one and the\nsame failure is part of success\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a favor give us a like down below\nit helps the YouTube algorithm and\ncomment down below anything that you\nwant me to talk about in future episodes\nso I can look through your comments and\nget ideas that maybe I can create\nepisodes for you specifically in the\nfuture so go ahead and comment them down\nbelow\nbecause you see what doesn't work you\nknow if you're playing basketball\nyou can't not want to miss shots because\nmissing shots is just the way that it\ngoes if you're a you know even another\nsport if you're a baseball player if\nyou're a great baseball player like an\nAll-Star one of the best that's alive\nyou're gonna strike out 70 of the time\nand you can look at and say oh that's\nthat's me failing or you could say hey\nthat that strikeout that I just had gets\nme one step closer to my next hit this\nwill be one step closer to my next home\nrun the thing that you don't want to do\nis not show up to the plate because\nyou're afraid of striking out and if you\nlook at success and failure as two sides\nof the same coin you realize you can't\nhave one without the other and a famous\nquote that the creator of Honda said is\nthat success is 99 failure you don't\nneed to succeed all the time you just\nneed to succeed one percent of the time\nand a lot of times that one percent is\nactually the one that really makes it a\nmassive massive success so number four\nis stop being afraid of failure\nnumber five stop putting things off stop\nprocrastinating like you just get better\nat making a decision and go like just\nmake a decision and go knowing that\nyou're going to screw up and quote\nunquote fail along the way I like to\nlive my life through the through the\nidea of ready fire aim a lot of times we\nthink that it's it's\nready aimed fire where it's get ready\nyou aim and then you fire but really\nwhat it is is make a decision I'm going\nto do this thing and then you take\naction immediately knowing that what\nyou're looking for is the failures and\nthen you start to adjust so it's ready\naim fire it's like if somebody was\nbreaking out into your house and they\nwere running at you or your children\nyou're you're probably just going to\nstart firing just because you know one\nof them is probably going to hit and\nyou're going to protect your children\nright so that's probably more important\nso if you think of it that way it's like\nready fire aim get ready fire figure it\nout make mistakes and eventually you're\ngoing to figure out what it is that you\nneed to do stop over planning stop I\nmean so many people are just planners\nright some of the people that are\nplanners out there you plan\nand then you plan about planning and you\nplan about planning about planning and\nyou plan about playing about playing\nabout planning really what it comes down\nto is stop putting things off stop\nprocrastinating ask yourself what am I\nafraid of because what you're afraid of\nis actually the real problem not when\nyou're procrastinating procrastination\nis never the problem procrastination is\nthe downstream effect of a problem it is\nnot the cause it is not the root symptom\nit is the the the thing that's popping\nup that's right there but you got to ask\nyourself what's if I'm procrastinating\nwhat am I actually afraid of because\nthere's always a fear and\nprocrastination and so you've got to\nstop putting things off you've got to\njust get better at taking action number\nsix\nhey human stop being so hard on yourself\njust stop being so hard on yourself\nyou're human\nhumans are ridiculously ridiculously\nimperfect you'll never be perfect you're\ngoing to mess things up you're gonna\nmess things up a lot like a lot a lot\nyou're going to screw up a lot of things\nin your life you're going to screw up\nbusinesses you're going to screw up\nrelationships you're going to screw up a\nlot of things you're always doing the\nbest that you can one a big key to be\nhappier\nlearn to let things go\nmaybe you did screw up maybe you didn't\ndo as well as you could have\nokay\nRoger that\nmake adjustments move on but be kind to\nyourself all too often we make\nquote-unquote mistakes which I don't\nbelieve there's any mistakes since\nuniverse but we make a mistake and then\nwe have that mistake and then we guilt\nour shop we shame ourselves we get\nreally hard on ourselves for that\nmistake\nLet It Go you're always doing the best\nthat you can at every single moment and\nyou're learning every single part of the\nway you can't get mad at yourself for\nsomething that she did five years ago\nyou can't be so mad at yourself for\nmessing up that relationship because you\ndid the best that you could in that\nmoment and now hindsight is 20 20. you\ndo see where you made the mistake can\nyou use that mistake can you not be hard\non yourself and can you try to learn and\nget better from it yeah you made a\nmistake in that relationship maybe\nyou're not with that person anymore but\ncan you bring that knowledge into your\nnext relationship to help you get better\nso just give yourself some Grace I\npromise you you're doing the best that\nyou can\nnumber seven stop trying to control\neverything\nstop trying to control everything you\ncan barely control anything for me the\ncoming from a recovering controllaholic\nyears ago I realized that I was trying\nto control everything and I was white\nknuckling my way through life I was\ntrying to tell people what to do make\nthem do these things micromanaging\npeople forcing people to do certain\nthings you can't control everything and\nif you really want more peace in your\nlife if you really want more\nah that feeling I always go back to that\nfeeling of what it feels like just to go\nand just be more calm if you really want\nmore of that in your life\nstop trying to control everything\ncontrol what you can control do the best\nthat you can but then realize there are\n99 of things that are happening in your\nlife are completely outside of your\ncontrol what can you control stop trying\nto control things outside of it stop\ntrying to control other people stop\ntrying to control circumstances and\nstart paying attention what you can\ncontrol what what you can control\nhow you think what you can't control how\nyou feel what you can control what you\ndo throughout the day you can control\nyou and only you everything outside of\nthat you just gotta learn to be able to\nget better at dealing with things\nthat's number seven number eight stop\ngiving up on yourself\nyou need to want to succeed for yourself\nyou need to want to succeed you need to\nstop putting others needs in front of\nyour own you deserve like just think\nabout this for a second you deserve to\nfollow through for yourself\nyou do you deserve to put yourself first\nbecause when you do better when you work\non yourself more when you're happier\nyou're better for everyone else around\nyou you're a better parent you're a\nbetter spouse you're better for every\nsingle person that's in your life\nyou deserve to follow through follow\nthrough on that business idea\nfollow through on your Fitness plans\nfollow through on your family plans you\ndeserve it all there's no reason why you\nyou can you can't be this and that like\na lot of times I coach a lot of a lot of\nbusiness owners and a lot of business\nowners especially if they have children\nthink well either I can be a great\nparent or I can be a great business\nowner I can either be a great mother or\nI can be you know run a multi-million\ndollar business an or is a place of\nscarcity it's either this or it's this\nit's either this or it's this\nthat's not true is it written into the\nlaws of the universe you can either be a\ngreat parent or you can be a great\nbusiness owner\nno it's not and so you've got to stop\ngiving up on yourself\nyou've got you deserve to have all of it\nso or is scarcity abundance which is all\na place we're all trying to step into is\nand you know what I will be an\nincredible father and I will be an\nincredible business owner I will be an\nincredible son and I will be and be an\nincredible husband I will be this and I\nwill be this and and and I might not be\nable to do it at this moment but I will\nconsciously expand myself and evolve\nmyself to become the type of person\nwhere both of those realities fit into\nmy reality maybe they don't at this\nmoment right now but if I consciously\ntry to expand myself and evolve myself I\nwill figure out a way to have both of\nthese realities live in my reality and\nso really stop giving up on yourself you\ndeserve better\nand then last one everybody number nine\nis to stop settling for okay\nstop settling for like an okay life\nmost people listen this your life isn't\nterrible it's okay it's pretty good\nbut you get one shot at this life stop\nsettling in your life stop settling for\nokay stop oh yeah this relationship is\nokay it's pretty decent oh yeah my my\nbank account it's okay my business it's\nokay my job is okay stop settling for\nokay and start telling yourself that you\nreally true deserve truly do deserve\nmore and don't just tell yourself like\n believe it like deep to your\ncore this is what I deserve I do deserve\nit I'm gonna stop settling for okay I\ndon't want anything less than great that\nneeds to be your mindset into everything\nthat you do everything that you're doing\nyou need to say you know what I'm going\nto same way I said in the in the last\none I'm going to expand myself to make a\ngreat life you might need to put some\nwork in yourself you might need to\nbut just stop settling for okay you\ndeserve more you deserve better\nand everything in your life and there's\nno reason why that reality can't exist\nfor you in the future and what you need\nto do is you need to grow yourself to be\nable to say I'm going to make this great\nI'm going to put every ounce of energy\nmaking this the best that I possibly can\nand so you really really need to stop\nsettling for just\nokay do you really want to live a life\nwhere it's like uh that was pretty good\nif you get to end of your life and you\ngo and meet God and God's like how was\nit you're like ah yeah I mean God it was\nit was all right I guess you really want\nthat to happen no don't settle you\nweren't here to be okay you were here to\nbe great you need to get that into\nyourselves all 40 trillion of yourselves\nneed to know the powerful being that you\nare and the powerful being that you\ncould become stop settling for okay\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nquick episode The Nine things that you\nshould stop doing immediately\nwith that I'm Gonna Leave the same way\nthat
