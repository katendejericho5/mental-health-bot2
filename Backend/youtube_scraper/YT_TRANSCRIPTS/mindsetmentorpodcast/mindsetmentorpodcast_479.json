    "transcript": "the beauty is we all learn differently\nand we all learn at different different\nrates not everyone arrives at the same\nunderstanding in the same moment in time\nfortunately it's a good thing\nbecause if we all thought the same and\nwe all embraced the same belief on the\nsame day in the same moment time and\nthat was a wrong belief we'd be in\ntrouble\nso the beauty of the diversity of our\nspecies is that we have different time\nHorizons we have different learning\ncurves and I think what we're learning\nis now\nto be kind to one another as we\nexperience our individual learning\ncurves\nand how we accept new ideas and new ways\nof living and that's that's up for\neverybody right now a lot of change\ngoing on we've all we've all been\nthrough hell these last at least the\nlast year for some people even extending\nbefore that\nhow this is where we get to test what we\nbelieve\nhow kind can we be as we express\nour concerns as we express our\ndifferences\nand points of view number one but number\ntwo it's about what we become how do we\nlive our lives and ultimately this is I\nthink what the whole covert experience\nis boiling down to It's All About Love\ndo we love ourselves enough\nto live our lives in a way that allows\nus to be the best version of ourselves"
