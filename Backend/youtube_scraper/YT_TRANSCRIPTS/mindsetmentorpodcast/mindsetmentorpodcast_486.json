    "transcript": "there's a part of your identity that's\nmore than the things that you can limit\nyourself there's a part of you that's\nmore than anything that's ever happened\nto you or could happen to you there's a\npart of you that is like called Soul or\nSpirit right it's something that nothing\ncan destroy we get you to tap into that\naspect of identity we can create a\ncompelling future but otherwise we're\njust making pictures and you're not\ngoing to believe it you're just going to\ngo oh yeah yeah it's all right\nso that's why we put people through an\nexperience that goes 10 12 14 hours a\nday for three or four days because it's\nkind of like if I want to learn Italian\nI can go to class in high school and\ncollege and you know five years later\nmost people don't speak it but if I\ndropped you in Italy for 90 days with no\nteacher 90 days later you're going to be\nspeaking because we put you in immersion\nso everything I do is immersion because\nthat's how the brain really learns in a\nway that's lasting yeah the the biggest\nthing that I like there's many things I\ntook away from being a upw but one of\nthe biggest things if not the biggest\nwas\nhow on command we can create energy in\nour body like it's it's wild\nI remember like the third day it was\nlike 13 hours in it's like two o'clock\nin the morning and I'm like how the\nam I still dance like how how is there\nso much energy in this room and it was\nreally really inspiring because there's\nso many people that just they don't\nthink they have enough energy throughout\noh I'm so tired and then they have this\nstory that's in their head tired just\nthink it this way if you've got the\ngreatest computer in the world and you\nplug it in there's not enough\nelectricity it's not gonna work right\nwell tired is the first step to being\ndepressed for most people and most\npeople are tired not because they're\nworking so hard\nI sat in these meetings you know and I\ntalked to people or I make calls or I\nsend emails and they're like I'm\nexhausted yeah I mean what's happened is\nwe haven't pushed ourselves\nphysiologically for so long that we've\ngotten weaker and weaker and so we feel\ntired from doing nothing and so what you\nlearn and when you go through a weekend\nlike that is holy there is a level\nof energy on command that's available to\nme that no one you'd never believe but\nby being in the environment over and\nover again you learn it's real and you\nlearn to use it and when there's enough\nenergy\nit may be everything else works better\nyour relationship is not going to be\ngreat no matter what tools you have if\nyou're tired because you're gonna go\nlove you love you you know there's no\npassion there's no aliveness right\nyou're not going to grow your business\nwhen you're tired so a huge part of what\nI teach even an Unleashed Power Within\nubw by the way for people not vendors\ncalled Unleash the Power Within it's a\nweekend and on the fourth day it's all\nenergy it's all about the things you do\nwith your health and vitality so you\nsustain that because without that\nnothing else really matters"
