    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout eight techniques to relieve your\ndaily\nstress world's crazy isn't it life is\ncrazy things are always kind of crazy\nand if I'm being honest with you it\nseems like they're just getting crazier\nand so really what it comes down to is\nwe can't change the world around us but\nwhat we can do is we can change how we\nreact to the world around us and that's\nwhat today's episode is really about and\nit goes back to one of one of the\nphrases one of my first mentors used to\nalways say is he used to always say your\nStress and Anxiety the level of your\nstress and anxiety will be in direct\nproportion to how much you are resisting\nthe way that the world is so the world\nis the way that it is the people around\nus are the way that they are and the\nmore that we resist it the more stress\nand anxiety we're actually going to have\nand so for you guys that are out there\nmyself included we need to have better\ntechniques to remove stress I don't know\nabout you guys but for me launching this\nbook in the next about 8 weeks for me is\ncrazy I'm on so many other people's\npodcasts I'm traveling I'm doing events\non top of that I've got other things\nthat are happening with creating this\npodcast expanding the the podcast to try\nto make it better I've also got so many\nother things that's happening in my\npersonal life and it's like everything's\nhappening at the exact same time and\nit's all very exciting but thinking\nabout all of the things that I have to\ndo over the next8 weeks can be very\nstressful and so these are tips and\ntechniques that I actually in my own\nlife to when I feel Stress and Anxiety\ncome up to relieve it because ultimately\nI'm not going to tell you that I don't\nfeel Stress and Anxiety sometimes I\ndefinitely do but when I do I just have\ntools in my tool belt to help me relieve\nmyself and get myself back to\ncalm State feeling much better\nhomeostasis which is what we're trying\nto get back to right so the first one is\nthis you know this one if you've been\nlistening podcast long enough but the\nquestion is have do you use it like are\nyou going to be like oh damn he's going\nto say this one again but but then you\ncould take a step back and say well okay\nI've heard him say this before but am I\nusing it cuz sometimes you have to hear\nsomething like a thousand times before\nyou do it the first one which is my\ngo-to every single time is my breathing\nsix deep breaths in through the nose out\nthrough the mouth when you do a long\nexhale like you're breathing out through\na straw it releases extra carbon dioxide\nfrom your body which allows you to relax\nbut a long exhale actually starts to\nslow your heart rate down so when we\nbreathe deeply we apply more oxy oxygen\nto the brain and to the body which\nactually brings a sense of calm and\nalertness to you it counteracts the\nflight or fight or flight mechanism that\nis inside of your brain So\nphysiologically speaking deep deep deep\ninhales the exercise can actually calm\nthe body's uh turn on the body's\nparasympathetic nervous system which the\nparasympathetic nervous system is calm\nand helps helps reduce you know the the\nstress inducing Sy sympathetic nervous\nsystem and so it gets you out of fight\nor flight and gets you more into a calm\nState and really what it can do is all\nof this can decrease your heart rate it\ncan reduce your blood pressure it can\nreduce your relaxation or it can induce\nmore\nrelaxation and just allow you to calm\ndown a little bit more because all too\noften the very first thing that changes\nin our body when we get excited when we\nget stress when we get happy the first\nthing to change is our breathing so it\nreally comes down to if I feel a state\nchange in my body how can I breathe to\nget my body back to the state change the\nstate that I want it to be in more than\nanything else so first thing very simple\nit's just 60 breaths it'll take you two\nminutes at most and it will change your\nbody it'll change your day immediately\nthe second thing is to start focusing on\ngratitude you've probably heard this\nbefore what you focus on grows and if\nyou focus too much on what you don't\nwant you will get more of what you don't\nwhat you don't want if you focus on what\nyou don't have you will get more of the\nstuff that you don't have and so if you\nfocus on all the things that you used to\nhave but you don't have anymore you're\njust going to get more of those feelings\nand what we need to get better at is we\nneed to change our perspective if you\nthink about everything that you don't\nhave if you think about everything that\nyou want if you think about all of the\nstuff that's screwed up in your life\nright now like just think about this for\na second think about all the stuff in\nyour life right now that's not what you\nwant it to be think about all of the\nthings that are just not the way that\nyou want think about all of the people\nthat are stressful in your life all of\nthe people that are just like damn it I\nwish they were different think about all\nthose things for a second the thought\nalone of all of that stuff can be\nextremely stressful and often what we do\nis we become consumed with what we don't\nhave we become consumed with what we've\nlost we become consumed with what we\ndesire and when we desire something we\nautomatically create a space of okay\nthere's me now I want this thing\nand not having that thing is making me\nstressed out and so one of the things\nwith the society that we live in with\nInstagram and constantly seeing what\nother people have that we don't have we\nseeing ads all over the place and our\nads thinking that oh if I get this thing\nI'll finally be happy it takes you out\nof your current state and make you think\nI'm not happy where I currently am I\ndesire for things to be different and\nthat desire automatically creates some\nform of stress and anxiety and so really\nwhat it comes down to is the opposite of\nDesiring something is to be grateful for\nwhat you have and so if I notice if I\ncan know okay desire causes stress the\nopposite of Desire is gratitude if I can\nlook around and see what I have it'll\nmake me feel better and when you see\nwhat you have and you can feel gratitude\nfor what you have your brain releases\nsomething called serotonin serotonin and\ndopamine are usually put together as\nthis you know this the same Feelgood\nchemicals but they're completely\ndifferent dopamine is more of like the\nthe motivation chemical serotonin is\nthis feeling\nof okay everything in life is pretty\ngood I feel pretty awesome I feel like\nthis is good I feel like life is good\nand that's ultimately what we're trying\nto do so Desiring stuff it's not bad to\ndesire things I don't want you to think\nthat but Desiring things too much and\nthinking I won't be happy until I get\nthis thinking I won't be happy until I\nget this automatically makes you what\nnot happy and so the opposite of Desire\nis gratitude can you look around\nyourself and realize no matter where you\nare in your life even if you're at Rock\nBottom you still have things to be\ngrateful for you're still alive you're\nstill breathing 50,000 people did not\nwake up today that were here yesterday\ncan you if you have nothing if you're\nliving on the street and somehow\nlistening to me on your phone can you\nfeel gratitude for the fact that your\nheart is still beating that you have\nyour health can you feel good about that\nand if you can start there you can start\nto feel better about other things around\nyou and start creating what it is that\nyou want and that is one way to really\nreduce your stress and anxiety the next\nthing number three is to go for a walk\nWalking interestingly enough has a lot\nof therapeutic benefits for humans\nforward motion by just walking Forward\nMotion seen Through The Eyes actually\nlowers your cortisol and cortisol is a\nstress hormone so by simply going for a\nwalk for 10 minutes without your foam\nwithout your headphones can lower your\nstress hormones immensely and if\npossible I recommend that you actually\ngo for a walk in nature and being nature\nis actually shown to also reduce\ncortisol levels which is your stress and\nso I think about this going on a walk\nlowers your cortisol being in nature\nlowers your cortisol can you figure out\na way to try to go for a walk in nature\nyou know if you if you live in New York\nCity can and you you've been having a\nstressful week okay you don't have a\nwhole lot of nature but I do know\nthere's one place that's really amazing\nCentral Park can you say okay tonight\nit's important for me to feel better I'm\ngoing to go on a walk I'm going to leave\nmy phone maybe maybe you have a backpack\nwith you you took to work right okay I'm\ngoing to take my phone I'm going to turn\nit off I'm going to put in my backpack\nand I'm just going to go for a walk I'm\ngoing to have no nothing that I need to\ndo nothing that I feel like I need I\njust want to go out and walk in nature\nthe natural environment that you're in\npromotes a calming effect that's also\noften referred to as the the biophilia\nhypothesis which suggests that humans\nhave an innate desire to connect with\nnature and that alone will actually\nstart to lower your cortisol lels hey if\nyou're loving this episode do me a quick\nfavor give us a like down below for the\nYouTube algorithm and make sure you hit\nthat subscribe button so that you know\nevery single time I put out a new\nepisode so that you never miss one in\nthe future so going for a walk in nature\nif you can't go for a walk in nature\ngoing for a walk still helps you out a\nlot but going for a walk in nature has\nmany times study after study after study\ndecreased levels of cortisol decreased\nlevels of depression in natural settings\nespecially those that have a lot of\ngreenery or have a lot of water can have\nimmediate mood boosting effects there's\nactually something that's called uh\nshinrin Yoku which is called Forest\nbathing and it's a Japanese concept that\ntranslates basically to uh taking in the\nforest atmosphere or Forest bathing and\nit involves immersing yourself in a\nforest environment and it's been\nscientifically shown to have both\nphysical and mental health benefits so\nsometimes you just got to get out in\nnature sometimes you just got to go for\nwalk and so that's tip number three try\nthose out tip number four is to take\neverything that's in your head and put\nit down on a piece of paper a lot of\ntimes the solution to what it is that's\ngoing on your in your head is a lot\nsimpler than you make it out to be it's\njust your brain is very complex there's\na lot of stuff that's going on and so\nwriting things down journaling it out\ncan actually help reduce cortisol levels\nmassively in 1986 1986 there was a study\nthat was done that was called\nconfronting a traumatic event toward a\nI'm going to try to get this entire\ntitle down confronting a traumatic event\ntoward an understanding of inhibition\nand disease it was in the Journal of\nabnormal psychology and what they found\nwas that in the study is they examined\nthe effect of writing about traumatic\nevents so this could be used for\ntraumatic events but it could also be\nused for your stress as well you can\nwrite about traumatic events but you can\nalso just write about what you're\nstressed out about and they actually\nfound that participants who wrote about\na traumatic experience showed a\nsignificant Improvement in both physical\nand\nphysiological physiological and\npsychological excuse me so physiological\nand psychological wellbeing compared to\nthose who wrote about anything else\nbesides the actual traumatic event so\nthey had people who had a lot of stress\nand anxiety and they actually said hey\njust start journaling and some people\nstarted journaling just on random things\nsuperficial topics oh today I went for a\nwalk then they had a group of people who\nwent and they actually wrote about their\ntraumatic events and they actually found\nout that there was physiological and\npsychological benefits of writing about\nthe actual traumatic event it's just\nexpressive writing and essentially\njournaling about distressing events or\nhow you feel if you're stressed out was\nassociated with reduce stress and Better\nHealth outcomes as well so what can you\ndo put it all down on pen and paper the\nnext one that I recommend is this this\nis something that's completely I don't\nreally I don't really hear people\ntalking about it I'm only saying this\nbecause it helped me a lot is to get\nyour blood levels checked my cost a few\nhundred but for me a couple years ago\nabout 3 years ago I wasn't I wasn't\nfeeling like 100% I was feeling really\nlike off like I wasn't\nfeeling as motivated or as excited I\nfelt kind of like blah a few years ago\nand I was like man I I normally don't\nfeel this way I usually feel pretty good\nthroughout the day and I went and did\nblood tests and I I realized that all of\nmy blood tests everything looked amazing\nbut there were two vitamins that I was\ndeficient in one of them was vitamin B\nit was a certain type of vitamin B and\nthe other one was vitamin D both of\nthose were two both of those two things\nwere down I told the doctor and I was\nlike I was like hey I don't feel 100% I\nfeel like I might need to get my blood\nlevels checked he's like okay so we get\nmy blood levels checked I come back okay\nyou're good except for your vitamin\nvitamin d and vitamin B are both low and\nso he gave me just these drops that I\nput into my drink every single morning I\ntook them and I'm not even kidding you I\nfelt like a completely new human it was\nit was like within 3 or 4 days I felt\ncompletely different my stress levels\nwere down my anxiety levels were down I\nhad more energy and it's all because my\nvitamins were just I was deficient we\nfixed them what's interesting too is a\ncouple months ago I was starting to feel\nlike the Stress and Anxiety come back up\nagain I was like man I'm starting to\nfeel kind of anxious again and I was\nlike what did it why why do I feel this\nway and I was like oh I haven't been\ntaking the vitamins and I was like I'm\ngoing to take this vitamins and I'm just\ngoing to see how I feel what happens\nliterally the first day I started\nstarted taking again I was like oh my\nGod I feel amazing and so do I want to\nbe taking this for the rest of my life\nno there's obviously dietary stuff that\nI can fix in myself but sometimes what's\ngoing on in your head is important but\nsometimes what's going on in your blood\nis also very important so it's going to\ncost you a couple hundred bucks but\nyou'd be surprised how much you can\nchange in just making sure your blood\nlevels are where they should be and\nseeing if you can get some work to kind\nof help you get back to status quo I\nguess you could say so that's number\nfive number six is to consider less\ncaffeine I'm sorry all of you coffee\nlovers try having less caffeine for a\nlittle while uh you can try to switch to\ngreen tea if you want and try to remove\ncaffeine from your life and just see\nwhat happens to your your stress levels\nbecause caffeine can actually massively\nincrease your cortisol and so if if and\nthat can be really good sometimes if\nyou're trying to get something done a\nlot of times having cortisol in your\nblood is actually really good for taking\naction and to get stuff done but\nsometimes caffeine can actually make you\nmost times more than anything else it\ncan actually make you really stressed\nout and so if you don't get rid of it\ntry to massively reduce if you're doing\nthree cups of coffee a day and you're\nvery stressed out and anxious throughout\nthe day see what it would feel like if\nyou only have one sometimes when your\nvitamin levels are corrected you realize\nyou don't need as much caffeine so for\nme for instance a few months ago I was\ndrinking three cups of coffee whatever\nit might be throughout the day when my\nmy blood levels are not where they were\nsupposed to be I started taking Vitamin\nB and vitamin again guess what happened\nI took it as soon as I woke up in the\nmorning as soon as I wake up in the\nmorning I take uh I take electrolytes I\n32 oun of water I have electrolytes and\nI put vitamin B vitamin D in there guess\nwhat happens I don't feel like I need\ncaffeine in the morning because my\nlevels are where they should be and so\nthat's why I wanted to bring in the\nblood levels before we started talking\nabout the caffeine sometimes the\ncaffeine is kind of a crutch for giving\nyou some energy throughout the day when\nreally what what the actual problem is\nit's not your energy levels and caffeine\nbeing needed but it's really your blood\nlevels are not where they should be and\nso I would just say try it out for a\nlittle while try less caffeine and just\nsee if that helps you their your\ncortisol level see if it helps you their\nstress and your\nanxiety also try to stop having it after\n1:00 don't have any caffeine after 1:00\nif you can you'll sleep better maybe\nit's interrupting your sleep as well so\nthat's number six number seven try to\nwatch 10 minutes of Comedy laughing\nreleases dopamine and dopam lowers your\ncortisol so dopamine is actually seen to\nbuffer your cortisol and so it will\nlower it and laughter's been shown to\nreduce levels of cortisol in the the the\nbody's primary stress hormone and when\ncortisol levels decrease you generally\nstart to feel more relaxed and less\nanxious another thing that watching\ncomedy does is it releases endorphins\nlaugh laughter stimulates the production\nof endorphins which is the body's\nnatural Feelgood chemicals so\nendorphins also promote an overall sense\nof of well-being and can temporarily\nrelieve pain in the body and also what\nit does comedy promotes physical\nrelaxation after laughing muscles can\nremain La relaxed up to 45 minutes the\nact of laughing involves many muscles in\nthe body and after laughter subsides the\nmuscles tend to relax leading to a\nphysical relaxation that you have and so\nthere was a study that was done in 1988\nand it was called the U it was in the\nJournal of Personality and Social\nPsychology and it was called sense of\nhumor as a moderator of the relaxation\nof EXC me of the relation between\nstressful events and psychological\ndistress what they found in the study\nwas they examined humor as a coping\nmechanism and its effects on\npsychological distress and they found\nthat human uh humor uh acts as a buffer\nagainst stress suggesting that we should\nengage in more activities that proot\nthat promote laughrin so sometimes if\nyou're just stressed find your favorite\ncomedian find your favorite T TV show\ngive yourself 10 minutes to watch it and\nwatch how it relieve your stress as well\nand then the last one I'm going to give\nyou that was number seven the last one\nis start paying attention to the music\nthat you're listening to if you're\nreally stressed out in the day and\nyou're listening to slip knot well slip\nKnot's not really going to help you uh\ncalm down there's a time for it I listen\nto slip knot sometimes and I work out\nand it's amazing it's a tool I can use\nit at that moment but if I'm feeling\nstressed and I'm listening to hardcore\nmetal probably not the best thing to\nlisten to and so there's music that's\nbeen designed to relieve stress there's\na song that I listen to every single\ntime I'm driving and I'm like okay\ntoday's been a crazy day I'm going to\nI'm going to use this 10-minute drive to\nkind of calm myself down the song is\ncalled weightless by Marone Union and uh\nthe way I found it is I read an article\none day that said it's the most relaxing\nsong that they've ever you know that\nstudies have ever found so that song for\nme always calms me down another song\nthat really always calms me down is the\nOut of Africa the theme song from the\nmovie and there's been many studies over\nand over and over again that show how\nmuch music can actually reduce your\nanxiety and your stress uh there was a\nstudy in 2001 in the Journal of music\ntherapy and found out that relaxing\nmusic prevents stress induced increases\nin subjective anxiety it changes your\nblood pressure and your heart rate in\nhealthy males and females and so really\nthe study involves subjects who were\nexposed to stress inducing tasks so they\ngave them a task it was really hard\nreally stress inducing and those people\nwho listen to relaxing music prior to\nthe actual event had less subjective\nanxiety reduced blood pressure and\ndecreased heart rate compared to those\nwho did not listen to relaxing music and\nso if you find yourself stressed once\nagain try to listen to some music that's\na little bit calming and so once again\nall of these are just tools for your\ntool belt there's breathing that you can\nuse there's gratitude that you can use\nyou can go for a walk you can go for a\nwalk in nature which you can use you can\nwrite all of your things down of what's\ngoing on inside of your head you can get\nyour blood levels checked you can drink\nless caffeine you can watch 10 minutes\nof comedy and you can just listen to\nslow music what it comes down to is your\nexternal reality is not going to change\nwe just have to get better of coping\nwith our external reality and these are\njust some tips and tricks to help you\nrelieve your stress and your anxiety\nthroughout the day so that's what I got\nfor you for today's
