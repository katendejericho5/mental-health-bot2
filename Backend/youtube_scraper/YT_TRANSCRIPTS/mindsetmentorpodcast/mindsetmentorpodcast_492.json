    "transcript": "let me tell you a secret though the most\nsuccessful people in the world are also\nthe world's biggest failures like if you\nlook at Walt Disney he was fired from\nhis dream job as an animator because he\nlacked creativity when you look at\nMichael Jordan he was cut from his high\nschool basketball team because he wasn't\ngood enough and he became the greatest\nbasketball player ever JK Rowling who\nwrote Harry Potter she was rejected by\n12 Publishers and that book went on to\nsell 500 million copies and the creator\nof Honda said that success is 99 failure\nso when you think of failure just\nremember it's not the opposite of\nsuccess it is actually a pivotal part of\nsuccess"
