    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to create affirmations and I\nknow in the world of personal\ndevelopment there are so many techniques\nthere's so many strategies and methods\nfor self-improvement and positive\naffirmations for an analytical mind like\nmyself seems like a bunch of woo woo\nHonky Donkey BS it doesn't seem like\nsomething that would ever work to sit\nand look in yourself in a mirror and say\nI love you or I I'm going to be\nsuccessful or I'm I'm look really cute\nin these jeans whatever it is you're\ntrying to figure out it sounds so corny\nI get it but I promise you this they\nwork they're science behind it I'll tell\nyou about the science behind it today\nand I'm also going to teach you exactly\nhow to create affirmations affirmations\nare very simple but the effects they\nhave on you can be really profound and\nyou know we're going to dive into the\nthe science behind it and how it changes\nyour brain but really what we're going\nto talk about today is how to actually\ndo it um so let's talk about it before\ndiv into the strategies of actually how\nto do it it's really crucial to\nunderstand the why behind the process\nand for you guys that have very\nanalytical Minds as I do I kind of have\nto sell you on why to do it don't I by\nteaching you some science by teaching\nyou why it works because your brain as\nmanificent as it is sometimes is a\nsponge in especially as a children we\njust soak up beliefs and we soak up life\nand we soak up all of these things from\nevery experience we have especially\nduring our formative years in some of\nthose beliefs that you have particular\nsome of the negative ones shape your\nimage of yourself and the way that you\nperceive the world and it becomes your\nidentity it becomes your personality and\nyou think to yourself well that's just\nthe way I am I'm always going to be this\nway as if you can't\nchange but if you listen to this podcast\nfor a long time you know one of my\nfavorite quotes is by Alan Watts who\nsays you're under no obligation to be\nwho you were five minutes ago so if you\nwant to change it you can change it and\nit starts with the way that you speak to\nyourself and think of the world and so\nthis is where positive affirmations\nstart to really come in at its core an\naffirmation is pretty simple it's just a\npositive statement that is just\ndeclaring to you to the universe\nwhatever desired goal or change that you\nwant and it is stated in the present\ntense that's it nothing real crazy and\nas you repeat it consistently over and\nover and over again with conviction the\nstatements can actually influence your\nbrain's neural Pathways helping all of\nus change and override and reprogram\nsome of the negative and limiting\nbeliefs that we have and so there's\nactually been brain Imaging studies that\nhave shown that when individuals\nvisualize thems achieving a particular\ngoal and sit there and say I am\nachieving XYZ I'm I am running across\nthat that that line for the marathon\nyour brain as you think it and as you\nsay it and as you visualize it light up\nas if you're actually experiencing it\nand what they call this is mental rehear\npersonal and it helps condition your\nbrain for success for what it is that\nyou want and the more that you do it the\nbetter there's the ways that you really\nwant to change yourself and understand\nthat you want to change yourself is by\ndeciding what you want and being very\nvery repetitive and bringing it up over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain because the more that you hear\nsomething the more you start to believe\nsomething there was a quote that says if\nyou if you believe a lie that's big\nenough long enough and strong enough\nevent I'm sorry if you say a lie that is\nbig enough long enough and strong enough\nfor enough time eventually people will\nstart to believe it you know who said\nthat quote Hitler Hitler said that quote\nbecause if you just keep repeating\nsomething repeating it repeating it\neventually people start to believe it\nthe problem is we've been doing that to\nourselves for so long oh I'm just not\nsmart I'm not smart I'm not smart I'm\nnot smart and so we start thinking that\nwe're not smart and then we start doing\nthings that are not smart or if you\nstart saying to yourself I am\nintelligent and I'm worthy of love I'm\nintelligent I'm worthy of love I'm\nintelligent I'm worthy of love you will\nstart to take intelligent actions and\nyou will start to actually see where you\ndeserve to be loved and so there's a few\nstudies I wanted to bring up that I\nfound that that kind of hit home how\nthis works so there was a study called\nin uh 2005 called stress reduction\nthrough self-affirmation in the overview\nof the study the researchers were\ninterested in understanding how\nself-affirmation if self-affirmation\ncould reduce stress responses and so\nwhat happened was they ended up telling\nthem to go through and actually start to\nsay TOS I am calm I am calm I am calm\nthere's nothing that can affect me I'm\nvery calm person and participants were\nput in a really stressful situation and\nthat situation was giving a speech in\nfront of other people and they Ed that\nself-affirmation to start believing\nthemselves they actually found that\npeople who use the\nself-affirmation inside of their brains\ndisplay lower lower cortisol levels\nwhich is the stress hormone than the\nones who did not which shows holy\nthis is crazy think about this if I tell\nmyself I'm calm I'm calm I'm calm I'm\ncalm my brain will release less cortisol\nthan if I don't say that which is the\nstress hormone which means that I will\nnaturally actually be less stressed so\nthe things that I say out loud and the\naffirmation I say out loud actually\nchange what's going on inside of my\nbrain it indicates that positive\naffirmations can actually have a\ntangible impact in your brain and\nresponses to stress there's also another\nstudy that was done in 2006 that was\ncalled affirmation intervention and\nacademic achievement and the study\noverie\nbasically what they did was they took\nmiddle school students and examined the\nimpact of a series of self-affirmation\nexercises on their academic performance\nand what they found out was that\nstudents that had lower than normal\ngrades experienc improved grades when\nthey started learning self-affirmation\nin repeating to thems I'm smart I'm\ngreat at taking tests I'm a smart kid\nwhich shows that self-affirmation can\nactually buffer against negative past\neffects or negative past grades and the\neffects of them and help improve their\nperformance so hold on a second if I say\nI'm not stressed and I'm calmed I will\nactually be more calm and the cortisol\nlevels of my brain will actually show\nthat and if I say that I'm smart I'll\nactually do better on\nexams that's pretty crazy if you think\nabout it isn't it so there's science\nbehind this and it really goes down to\nand this is why the placebo effect\nexists placebo effect is probably the\nmost mind-blowing thing that just kind\nof people don't pay much attention to to\nthe placebo effect is basically somebody\nhas some sort of illness a doctor comes\nin they give them a sugar pill and they\nsay this sugar pill they don't know that\nSugar this pill will cure your illness\nand the person takes a sugar pill\nthinking that it's some medication but\nreally it does nothing except for it's\nlike eating a Skittle basically they\njust have it and then what happens the\nperson believes that the medication\nthey're getting which is no medication\nat all will heal them and through\nbelieving that they are healed what\nhappens they heal themselves that's why\nevery drug trial every single drug Tri\ntrial uses a placebo effect to see the\nefficacy of drugs that are coming onto\nthe market or possibly coming onto the\nmarket versus just believing in it 33%\nof all medical healings actually come\nfrom just believing that they're healed\nso if we can just believe that we're\nhealed what if we actually in we\nactually proactively start to speak what\nwe want into our lives into our minds\ninto our thoughts our feelings in the\nuniverse could that change the way that\nwe interact with the world of course it\ncould let's dive into it it also comes\nback to you may have heard heard me in\nthe past do a I did a um episode on the\nphrase Abracadabra which I just thought\nAbracadabra was just a word that\nmagicians use when they're pulling\nrabbits out of hats but Abracadabra is\nactually an ancient Hebrew word which\nstands for as I speak I\ncreate whoa crazy huh as I speak I\ncreate as I speak my words I create that\nreality and also as you think you create\nthat reality because your thoughts is\nare just words that are inside of your\nhead hey if you're loving this episode\non affirmations do me a favor real quick\nfor the YouTube algorithm give us a like\ndown below and so you never miss another\nepisode go ahead and hit the Subscribe\nbutton so you get notified every time a\nnew episode comes out and to be honest\nwith you you're not even fully inside of\nyour head because if you look at at an\nEEG machine an EEG machine is where they\ntake electrodes and they stick it to\nsomebody's brain right and they stick it\nto their brain I think it's a Electro\nenh is what it stands for they take\nelectrodes they stick it to somebody's\nhead the skull and they can measure\nbrain waves well there's also one that's\ncalled an meeg machine which is a\nmachine that goes over somebody's head\nbut never actually touches their skull\nand they can measure brain waves without\never touching the human's head which\nshows you what your thoughts don't stay\ninside of your head they go outside into\nthe universe and so Abracadabra ancient\nHebrew word for as I speak I create that\nis what an affirmation is as I speak it\nout into the Universe I create that\nreality awesome huh how amazing so let's\ndive into it let's start talking about\nhow do you actually create these\naffirmations well the first thing I'm\ngoing to give you four different best\npractices I guess you could say for\ncreating affirmations and using them the\nfirst one is to be very very specific\nwhat it is that you want think about how\nmany ancient texts say something along\nthe lines of ask and you shall\nreceive right ask and you shall receive\nso if you just say that you want\nsomething and you're very\ngeneric you might get what you want but\nif you're going to say it as you speak\nyou create why don't you just get very\ngranular and specific of exactly what is\nthat you want you could say I am\nsuccessful oh that's sounds great I am\nsuccessful I am successful right you\ncould say that if you want but or you\ncould could consider what success\nactually means to you you know is it is\nit Landing a specific job is it\nfinishing your project at work what you\nwant to do is you want to take your\naffirmation and tailor it towards your\ngoal tailor what you actually want to\ncreate and so you could say instead of\nsaying I am\nsuccessful I am excelling at my new\nmanagerial position am excelling in my\nnew managerial position I am an amazing\nmanager I'm doing I am the best manager\nthat they've ever had in this company my\nemployees love me I could go through and\nbe very clear on exactly what it is I'm\nexcelling at it I'm making the most\nmoney that I've that I've ever made I'm\nuh my I'm helping my employees change\ntheir mindset and their lives I'm\nexcelling at this manager position I'm\nexcelling at this manager position I'm\nexcelling at this manager position it\ncould be that that could mean a success\nto you or maybe you've been wanting to\ncreate a novel for like forever and that\nwould be success you could say I am\ngoing to complete my novel by December\n31st of this year I am going to complete\nmy novel by December 31st this year I'm\ngoing to complete my novel by December 3\n31st of this\nyear maybe that's success to you or\nmaybe making $100,000 is success to you\nI will absolutely 100% make $100,000\nthis year I will absolutely 100% make\n$100,000 this year I will absolutely\n100% make $100,000 this year the clearer\nyour\naffirmation the easier it is for you to\nunderstand for you to know what you're\nshooting for so you can see it better\nand the easier for your mind to start to\nthink about visualize and work towards\nit and so what you really want to do is\nyou want to identify a goal or a\npositive belief or whatever it is that\nyou want to instill into yourself then\nyou want to frame it in the present\ntense as if it's happening right\nnow and then you want to make sure it's\nextremely specific so you can visualize\nit vividly which we're going to talk\nabout because if you can bring in visual\nif you can bring in positive\naffirmations and visualization that's\nlike gas on a fire and so that's the\nfirst thing is you've got to be very\nvery specific the second thing is to\nbring in an emotional charge try to\nbring in as much emotion as you possibly\ncan here's the reason why think about\nthis for a second the way that you\nchange your brain like immediately is by\nhaving an extremely strong experience so\nlike as you get older it's harder to\nchange your brain it's not impossible\nbut it's harder but if have a very high\nemotionally charged experience say\nsomeone robs you at gunpoint you could\nhave you could you could if you're\nrobbed at gunpoint inside of your\ncar tonight then the next month you\nmight get inside of your car and\nimmediately feel the feelings of your\nbody starting to change why because\nthat's a very heightened emotional\nexperience and so there's two ways to\nchange your brain the and the best not\nthe best but I guess one of the ways is\nvery emotionally charged the heightened\nexperience the second way is through\nrepetition so heightened experience and\nrepetition which going to we're going to\ntalk about in a minute so you have to\nbring an emotional charge to it and\nemotion what do I mean by that is the\npower that you can bring to it there's\nsomething that's really interesting is\nyou could do an affirmation which you\ncould you know you could say that I am I\nam you can look in the mirror and you\ncan say I'm strong and I am powerful I\nam strong and I am powerful I am strong\nand I am powerful and that helps you\nhear it over and over and over again it\nbecomes basically like a song that's\nstuck in your head which is what you\nwant you want to continue to keep saying\nit and you can look yourself in the\nmirror and you can say I'm strong and\nI'm powerful I'm strong and I'm powerful\nor for instance I have a gym that's\ninside of my garage I can go into my\ngarage I can blast some music I can get\nmyself into a very heightened State and\nwith every single rep I can say I can\nscream I am strong and I am powerful I\nam strong and I am powerful I am strong\nand I am powerful what I'm doing is I'm\ntaking the emotional charge but I'm also\ntaking the repetition of saying it over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain and so if you can bring emotion\ninto it emotion is one of the ways that\nyou can lock it into your brain and into\nyour subconscious mind and so that's\nwhen it becomes an affirmation turns\ninto something called an incantation so\nan affirmation is just saying it it's a\nstatement whatever it might be an\nincantation is like a fully immersive\nexperience it may be a phrase that you\nscream out loud to yourself maybe you go\non a height\nand you're trying to work on yourself\nsome sort of way and you go on this hike\nin the middle of nowhere and you just\nfreaking screaming at the top of your\nlungs it could be a chance it could be a\nritualistic statement it can be whatever\nyou want it to be but the key to it is a\nheight in state an emotion a physical\nmovement so if you're trying to become\nmore powerful go to the gym and if you\ncan work out in a gym without other\npeople and not scaring the out of\nthem scream if you can whatever it is\nthat you need to do that's how you take\nan affirmation and turn into an\nincantation an affirmation is a\nstatement an incantation is an immersive\nemotional experience while saying the\naffirmation so try that out the next one\nwhich is number three is consistent\nrepetition so as I said the way to\nchange your brain is number one either\nthrough a heightened emotional\nexperience or number two is through\nconstant\nrepetition once again if you say\nsomething over and over and over and\nover and over again a 100 thousand times\nof the next year you're going to start\nto believe it you will it's just what\nthe way the brain works it will happen\nand so it's not about doing this one\ntime it's about doing it all the time\nit's about repeating it to yourself\nevery single morning repeating it to\nyourself every single evening put on the\nbackground of your computer on the\nbackground of your phone write it on the\nmirror so that you see it every single\ntime you brush your teeth it should it\nshould be omnipresent it should be\neverywhere and it's constantly being you\nknow it's like it's like if I were to\nsay you know like I love this too I love\nwhen I do this it's basically the same\nas if I were to say we want to get a\nsong stuck in your head and that song\nthat you want to get stuck into your\nhead is this new affirmation it's like\nif I were to just immediately put if I\nwere to just have all of you guys listen\nto the Spice Girls and I would just put\non the first 30 seconds of that song\nwell I'll tell you what I want what I\nreally really want and I would just say\nthat some of you guys are going to have\nthat song stuck in your head for the\nrest of the damn day you're welcome now\nyou can party with the spice CLS in your\nhead but just like having that that song\ngets stuck doesn't it how can you try to\nget your affirmations stuck into your\nhead so that even when you're not\nthinking about them they're kind of\nstill there and so what it what it\nrequires is consistent effort\nneuroplasticity which is the brain's\nability to reorganize Itself by forming\nnew neural\nconnections it needs you to repeat over\nand over and over again in order to\nchange your brain you need to do\nsomething over and over and over and\nover and over again in order to change\nway that you think about yourself you've\ngot to repeat over and over and over\nagain and the more that you repeat the\nstatement with conviction with power the\nstronger the connections in your brain\nbecome making it more dominant of a\nthought over\ntime and so dedicate a specific time of\nyour day or multiple times a day to go\nover\nit because affirmations they're just\nsomething that you could do at any\nmoment you can get into your car and you\ncan say okay I've got a I've got a\n20-minute drive I'm going to listen to\none episode of the mindset mentor and\nthen whatever time is left over I'm\ngoing to say my one affirmation over and\nover and over and over and over again\nokay so that's number three and the last\npiece is as I said if you want to put\ngas in the fire combine it with\nvisualization so your brain can actually\nstart to visualize what it would look\nlike so you repeat it to yourself and\nyou visualize it and you see it and I've\ndone you can go back I don't need to\nspend an entire episode talking about\nvisualization because I've done that\nbefore in the past but our brain\nstruggles to differentiate something\nthat's really happening right now in\nfront front of you and something that\nyou're visualizing and so when you pair\nyour affirmations with visualization\nyou're making them basically double\neffective so you're not just telling\nyour brain what you want and what you're\ncreating you're actually showing your\nbrain what it is that you want and so as\nyou state your affirmation you can look\nat yourself in the mirror you can go for\na run you can yell at yourself you can\ndo whatever is that you want or you can\nalso close your eyes and you can see it\nyou can try to bring as much visual\nvisual colors and clear aspects of\nwhatever it is that you're trying to\ncreate and you sit there and you think\nabout it you think about it you think\nabout it and you say it and you think\nabout it you say it you try to visualize\nit and try to create a mental picture of\nit actually being true visualize the\nenvironment the People The Sounds most\nimportantly see yourself in that\nscenario living in that\naffirmation and so I get it affirmations\ndon't seem like they would work but\nhopefully I've talked you into showing\nyou that affirmations are something that\nis scientifically proven to improve\nyourself improve the way that you think\nabout yourself improve the actions that\nyou take because ultimately Abra Kadabra\nas you speak you create so make sure\nthat you are speaking the life that you\nwant to create in the future so that's\nwhat
