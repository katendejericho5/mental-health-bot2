    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout self-awareness and I'm going to be\nteaching you how to understand yourself\nbetter and I'm going to be talking about\nthe difference between self-awareness\nand self-consciousness and if you've\nbeen listening to my podcast for a while\nyou probably notice that self-awareness\nmight be the main thing that I promote\nmore than anything else I feel like\nalmost every single podcast I'm talking\nabout self-awareness self-awareness\nself-awareness when I go onto other\npeople's podcasts one of the questions\nthat you know people always like to ask\nto have like a you know they have a\nlightning round and they have fun\nquestions and sometimes they ask the\nquestion of hey if you could give\neveryone in the world a superpower what\nwould it be and I always say extreme\nself-awareness and the reason why is\nbecause if people were more aware of\nthemselves all of the problems in the\nworld would disappear if they were aware\nof how when they do that thing they\naffect other people good or bad if we\nwere all more self-aware the world would\nbe a better place and the the phrase\nignorance is bliss is probably the most\ntrue thing in the world because I'll\ntell you this it's way easier to just\nnot be aware of yourself\nit's way easier to just blindly go\nthrough life and just do whatever it is\nthat you were doing it won't lead to a\nfulfilled life it won't leave to lead to\na happy life but it's way more Blissful\njust to not be aware of yourself because\nonce you become self-aware you start to\nnotice the things that you need to work\non and a lot of times when you become\naware self-aware of the things that you\nneed to work on you start becoming\nself-conscious and we're going to talk\ntoday about the difference between the\ntwo of them and we're going to talk\nabout how to improve yourself and go on\nthis this journey of self-development\nwithout judging yourself without shaming\nyourself without feeling guilty for\ndoing the things that you do and so let\nme real quick before we dive into\nself-awareness let me\ngive you the difference between\nself-awareness and self-consciousness\nand being self-conscious okay so as far\nas self-awareness goes that is basically\nthe the recognizing and understanding of\nyour emotions of your motivations of\nyour thoughts of your feelings and your\nbehaviors it's the recognizing and\nunderstanding of them it's like you know\nI'm 37 years old it's like if I've never\nbeen self-aware it's like I'm I've been\ndriving a car for 35 years 37 years and\nI'm like you know what\nI'm kind of curious what's under the\nhood of this thing and you decide to pop\nthe hood open and look at it so when you\nbecome self-aware you start getting\ncurious about looking under the hood\nfiguring out what makes this thing run\nand so being self-aware means just\nreally having developing clear\nperception of your personality of your\nstrengths of your weaknesses your\nthoughts your motivations emotions every\naspect of you the traumas that happen to\nyou in your past how your relationship\nwith your parents your mom make you who\nyou are how your relationship with your\ndad make you who you are how\nrelationship with your brother and\nsisters make you who you are and it\nreally once you start to become aware of\nyourself\nthen you start to become aware of other\npeople and you start to become aware of\nhow other people start to perceive you\nbased off of how you act you start to\nbecome aware of your attitude and you\nalso start to become aware of your\nresponses to other people as well and\nyou really start to learn Who You Are\nbecause you might know yourself but\nlearning but the difference between\nknowing yourself and learning yourself\nis knowing yourself is based in the past\nlearning yourself is based in the\npresent it's a journey of let me go on a\njourney of self-discovery and find out\nwho I am and why I am the way that I am\nso why would you want to get better at\nself-awareness well it can make I mean\nit helps you a lot with better decision\nmaking with emotional regulation and\nreally helps you with more fulfilling\nrelationships because you will start to\nunderstand why how the way that you are\nchanges the way that other people are\naround you as well and so it also helps\nyou decide what you want to work on what\nyou want to get rid of what you want to\nstrengthen yourself all of that so\nthat's self-awareness being\nself-conscious is excessive awareness of\nyourself it's a really acute awareness\nof yourself especially in your\nrelationship with other people and how\nother people view as well and to be too\nself-conscious really can bring a it can\nbe beneficial and I'm going to tell you\nabout it in a minute of how being\nself-conscious to a point can be\nbeneficial but being too self-conscious\ncan make you feel really uncomfortable\nin a lot of situations really uneasy and\nyou're you're judging yourself too much\nyou're you're guilting yourself you're\nshaming yourself or who you are and a\nlot of times when we when we become\nself-aware we now notice things we want\nto fix but we're human so we're going to\nscrew up again and again and again and\nagain and again so when you do screw up\nif we become too self-conscious of it\nthen we start to guilt ourselves damn it\nI thought I was past this what the hell\nis wrong with me man I'm still up\nI'm always going to be this way and\nthe self-awareness shouldn't turn into\njudgment and it shouldn't turn into\nshaming of ourselves that's when you\nstart becoming too self-conscious and so\nbeing self-conscious turns into\nbeing overly preoccupied with how other\npeople perceive you and it can really\nlead to feelings of unease\ndiscomfort embarrassment awkwardness and\nsure there's there's definitely a\ncertain amount of self-consciousness\nthat can be good like making sure that\nyou act appropriately in certain\nsituations in public but to be\nexcessively self-conscious can be really\ndebilitating because you're thinking too\nmuch oh my gosh what do people think of\nme am I doing this wrong am I screwed up\ndo I look like an idiot oh my gosh I\njust said this thing to her did she take\nit the wrong way I didn't mean it that\nway if she did take it that way and it\ncan it can lead to social anxiety and\nreally prevent you from acting as your\ntrue authentic self so that's the\ndifference between self-awareness and\nself-conscious let's dive in into\nself-awareness and really how to get\nbetter at it because at its core\nself-awareness is basically like having\na clear internal mirror\nthe more that you become self-aware the\nmore that you're able to understand\nyourself a little bit more and look into\nthe mirror and start to see why you are\nthe way that you are you become more\nintrospective and allows you to see your\nstrengths a lot to see your weaknesses\nyour desires your fears your aspirations\nand the more self-aware that you are the\nmore that you can start to understand\nyour emotions\nand this is really important for people\nbecause I think a lot of people are not\nmyself included as a child was not\ntaught to understand my emotions and so\nI would get really angry or sad and I'd\nbe like where the hell did that come\nfrom why do I I don't understand why I\nfeel this way and so I just oh it's\neasier just to push emotions down act\nlike they don't exist but really what\nwe're trying to do is we're trying to\nunderstand ourselves I feel an emotion\ncome up huh okay where did that come\nfrom what am I thinking about what am I\nfeeling and then as you start to learn\nyourself a little bit more and become\nmore self-aware you can also start to\nanticipate emotions and notice them\nbefore they come up or notice that if I\nput myself into this circumstance in\nthis situation I will probably have this\nemotion come up you know what I'm just\ngoing to avoid that I don't need to be\npart of that and then we can also start\nto manage our emotions better as well\nand so\nhow do we develop this thing it seems so\nweird it's like very nebulous you can't\nreally grab on to self-awareness right\nwell let's talk about how to develop\nself-awareness uh the first thing I\nthink is really important is to start\ntrying to implement reflective practices\nand by reflective practices I mean like\nlooking into a mirror not actually\nphysically into a mirror but looking\ninto a mirror and saying hey problem\nwhat's going on here\nyou got some you're trying to work\nthrough why are you this way and doing\nit in a very objective way\nhey this guy seems to be really angry\nspeaking about myself this guy seems to\nbe really angry why is this guy angry\nright now versus being like Oh I'm angry\nwhy am I angry that person she\nshouldn't have done that to me getting\nsome it's just like hey interesting this\nguy's noticing some anger inside of him\nwhat is this anger so how do we start to\nget\nreflective practices\nthe first one which I know you've heard\nme say before is journaling right some\nof you are like if you guys have been\nlistening podcasts for all you're like\ndamn is this dude talking about\njournaling again yes because are you\njournaling every single day no okay I'm\ngonna keep talking about every single\nepisode right sometimes you need to hear\nsomething a thousand times before you're\nactually all right fine I'll go ahead\nand do it journaling is really just\nwriting down your thoughts your\nexperiences your feelings your emotions\nto try to start bringing Clarity to them\nand the reason why pen and paper is so\neasy is because your brain is so complex\nand there's so much happening behind the\nscenes there's your conscious thought\nwhich you know you can Journal through\nor you can you can kind of think through\nwhich is five percent of what's going on\nyour head and then there's your\nsubconscious thought which is\nsubconscious is below the conscious\nthought which means you're basically\nunconscious of it a lot of times which\nis 95 of what's going on in the\nprogramming behind the scenes and so if\nyou're not aware of the 95 percent and\nyou only wear the five percent you don't\nreally know yourself\nso it really comes down to taking a pen\nand paper and jotting them all down\nyou're so complex that to try to figure\nyourself out in your own head sometimes\nis just not going to happen and so I\nalways give the example like if I said\nhey what's two plus two everybody\nlistening and say oh that's four right\nyeah you got that one but if I said\nwhat's 300 374 plus 17 614\nmost people probably can't figure it out\nin your head but you could figure out if\nI gave you a pen and paper you go back\nto second grade or third grade and you\ncan start to figure the problem out why\nbecause when it's on paper and you can\nwrite it out and you can visually see it\nit's very easy to work through as\nopposed to inside of your head\nyou're a million times more complex than\nthat math problem and you're trying to\nfigure out what's going on in your head\nand why you're acting the way that you\nare and why you are the way that you are\nso journaling is really the act of\ntaking a pen and paper and it's not like\nsitting down and saying dear diary today\nI went to the grocery store and I bought\nsome apples that's not it's not a diary\nI'm talking about journaling in the fact\nof writing down man I've I've I'm really\nfreaking pissed off right now why am I\nso pissed off and you write the question\nwhy am I so pissed off and then you\nanswer the question I'm so pissed off\nbecause this this this this this this\nhappened okay and then go a little bit\ndeeper okay why why is that bring up\nsuch a strong emotion in me though when\nyou answer the question okay is there\nany way that maybe this isn't my true\nself and whatever it might be and you\nstart to journal through it what's\nreally interesting if you actually do\nthis there's a reason why I preach this\nso much is journaling yourself is you\nwill start to figure out who you are way\nmore than you ever knew and one of my\nfavorite things when I used to do\none-on-one coaching a lot was when I\nwould work with clients and I would\nteach them how to journal and make them\njournal every single week and about two\nmonths into working with me they'd\nalways come back and say like oh my God\nI thought I knew myself before I started\nwith you\nI didn't know myself at all\nbecause you're not really aware of these\nthings because they're subconscious\nthey're under the conscious mind and so\nyou try to bring them to the service and\nwork through them so the first thing to\nbe really good at reflective practices\nis to journal the next thing which I\nfeel like I talk about almost every\nsingle episode is meditating right so\nmeditation is not just about calming\nyour mind it's can be that if you like\nbut it's also about learning Who You Are\nthe amount of times we just ran an event\nthis weekend and some people are like\nwell I just don't meditate I don't\nmeditate I'm not good at it I'm bad at\nmeditating I I'm so bad at it I can't\nget my mind to stop\nand back in 2017 my wife and I we\ntraveled and we traveled for six months\nand one of the times that one of the\nplaces we went to was Thailand and we\nwent to this place called Chiang Mai in\nThailand and there they have a lot of\nmonks\nand there was this really cool\nexperience where you could go and you\ncould spend a day with the Monk and just\nkind of see what they do ask them\nquestions meditate with them all of that\nand one thing I'll never forget is that\nmonk who is there said meditation is not\nabout having no thoughts meditation is\nabout watching your thoughts and so if\nyou think you struggle with meditating\nyou're not good at it because you're\nthinking too much you're doing it right\nyou're just supposed to be watching your\nthoughts not trying to resist your\nthoughts so meditation what it is is\nit's the state of of doing nothing so\nthat you can\nso that you can watch your normal State\nof Mind throughout the day because if\nyou can't if your mind can't stop during\nmeditation I guarantee you I'm not a\nbetting man\nI would bet all the money that I have in\nthe world saying that if you can't stop\nyour brain in meditation your thoughts\nand meditation if you can't stop\noverthinking meditation I guarantee you\nthat's exactly how it is all day every\nday for you\nso if you sit down to meditate and it's\nstressful\nand you're like I can't do this I can't\ndo this I'm not good at it\nthe reason why it's stressful for you is\nbecause you cannot run from it so a lot\nof people be like I'm going to meditate\nfor 20 minutes and then six minutes then\nthey're like this I can't do it I'm\nterrible at there's no possible way\nright that's what most of us think it's\nthe reason why meditation can be so\nstressful for some people is because\nthey they're they're getting their\nnormal State of Mind\nheightened and you can't run from it\nbecause normally we try to keep\nourselves so busy throughout the day\nthat we don't pay attention to our mind\nand over time meditation can almost be\nbecome more attuned to what we're\nthinking our internal States it\nabsolutely can help you calm down but\nreally what it comes down to is like\nwhat's going on in my mind all day long\nlike that's what I want to know I want\nto be like the Indiana Jones of figuring\nout what the hell is going on and the\ncrevices of my mind I want to be an\nExplorer and figure out what's going on\nand it really comes back to being\ncurious about who you are\nanother thing that's really important\ntoo\nas far as far as self-reflection and\nstarting to learn yourself is start to\npay attention to your thoughts\nstart to pay attention what's going on\nyour head if you start to feel a certain\nway usually what there was is there was\na thought that came before that feeling\nso if you feel like a whole lot of\nsadness and you're like why do I feel\nsad right now\nyou take a step back in incognitive\nbehavioral therapy they say to ask this\nquestion the question is what was I just\nthinking\nso if you feel a bunch of sadness you're\nlike why do I feel this way you ask\nyourself the question what was I just\nthinking you start to pay attention to\nyour thoughts pay attention to when you\nget triggered for me oh my goodness this\nhappened earlier today I was driving\nand you know we're about to be in the\nelection time and all that stuff and I\nsaw somebody that was just pushing\nsomebody for election and I got a little\nbit triggered and the\na few years ago I was much much more\ntriggered but I got so triggered by that\nand I was like okay hold on this person\nis just holding a sign\nthat says somebody's name\nthat shouldn't trigger me but I feel\ntriggered this happened on the way when\nI was driving to the studio today why do\nI feel triggered right now I feel\ntriggered because of how I've seen that\nperson that's running for that position\nAct\nand I feel like it is uh not the way\nthat a leader should act and how they\nshould do and all this stuff and I was\nlike man I'm I'm so I'm really triggered\nby that but a lot of times what's\ninteresting is about when we're\ntriggered is we're triggered not by that\nperson we're triggered by our\nprogrammings but a lot of times we're\ntriggered because we notice ourself and\nthat person\nand there's a part of our self that we\nhate and we just have that person be a\nmirror for us to say hey yeah you can\nhate this person and you should want\nthis person to be different\nbut why don't you try being different\nfirst\nif you want the world to be different\nyou have to be different if you want the\nWorld to Change you have to change if\nyou want other people to be different\nyou have to be different get off your\nhigh horse and realize that you're not\nperfect and if you want the World to\nChange you have to start with you and so\nyou ask yourself what was I just\nthinking why was I just triggered she\nsaid this to me and then I blew up why\ndid I blow up what was I thinking in\nthat situation\nyou start to really pay attention to\nyour thoughts\nyou start to notice your programming\nonce again I've said this many times on\nthe podcast being triggered is a gift\nit is a absolute gift because it is the\nuniverse coming to you in the form of\nanother person to trigger you to show\nyou where you are not free and we want\nto try to get free from all of our\nproblems circumstances things that we're\nstuck in places that were stuck all of\nthat so you asked yourself what was I\njust thinking so that's the next thing\nis to pay attention your thoughts the\nnext thing is to pay attention to your\nfeelings\nyou ask yourself why am I feeling this\nway I'm really angry right now\nokay let me go ahead and just feel the\nanger for a second\nand then I'm just going to ask myself\nwhy am I feeling angry what is it about\nthe circumstance that's making me feel\nthis way because it's really it's really\ninteresting like if you look at life as\nsimply as possible you're born\nyou have a bunch of sensory experiences\nfor your entire lifetime and then you\ndie\nthat's like the the 100 000 foot\noverview of being a human right you're\nborn you have a sensory set of\nexperiences and things that happen to\nyou in your diet how you choose to\ninterpret the things that happen to you\ncompletely up to you\nso you ask yourself I'm angry why am I\nangry right now why am I feeling this\nway you start to really\ninterested\ninterested and curious more anything\nelse I'm I'm feeling freaking amazing\ntoday like I feel amazing I'm so happy\nwhy do I feel amazing today oh you know\nwhat I actually got eight hours of sleep\nand you start to notice patterns in\nyourself oh man\nI'm feeling really sad today\nI'm feeling really sad okay why am I\nfeeling this way what could have\npossibly happened\nnext\nafter you go through that your your\nthoughts your feelings now what we also\nwant to start to pay attention to is our\nbeliefs\nand one thing that I would really\nrecommend for everybody here\nis to challenge in question all of your\nbeliefs\nbecause your beliefs are that make you\nwho you are at this point are just a\nblend of cultural cultural upbringing\npersonal experiences trauma societal\nnorms and it's learned from you you\nlearn it from your parents you learn it\nfrom what part of town you grew up in\nyou learn from your religion you learn\nfrom your nationality there's so many\naspects there's a million things that\nhave happened to you over your lifetime\nthat have made you who you are and\nreally like beliefs are great because it\ngives you you know a world view in a way\nto look at the world but beliefs are\nvery very limiting and so what you need\nto do is to actually start identifying\nyour beliefs and challenge the hell out\nof them to see if you want to keep them\nas your beliefs or if they were\nprogrammed into you and so you start to\nthink about one right you start to think\nabout what are your core beliefs what do\nyou believe in and then you ask yourself\nthese three questions number one\nwhere did I learn this belief number two\nis this my belief or one that was\nprogrammed into me and number three From\nThis Moment forward do I choose what do\nI choose to believe\nso it's\nwhere do I learn this belief\nis it my belief or when those programmed\ninto me and then last but not least From\nThis Moment forward do I choose to what\ndo I choose to believe and so let's say\nfor instance you come up with the belief\nof I believe that we should treat every\nperson with respect\nokay cool we can work with that one\nfirst where did I learn this I learned\nthis from my mom she's always very\nrespective of people I also learned from\nmy grandfather he never commanded\nrespect he never tried to make anybody\nfeel a certain way he just acted very\nrespectful and I never saw him ever get\nmad or talk down to anybody or about\nanybody Okay cool so I learned it from\nthem I probably learned it from other\nplaces too was this programmed into me\nhmm\nmaybe maybe it was programmed into maybe\nmaybe it was something I was I was told\nbut it was also something that I\nwitnessed and I saw so a little bit he\nasked a little bit of no what do I\nchoose to believe I actually choose to\nbelieve this I actually choose to\nbelieve that every single person should\nbe given respect\nperfect cool I'm gonna keep that one\nlet's say I have another belief and I I\nstart to notice my money mindset I\nbelieve that money is the root of all\nevil okay interesting where did I learn\nthis maybe say I learned this from my\nfather he was always talking about you\nknow people have to screw people over to\nbecome wealthy and you know all of the\nthe all of the evil comes from people\nwho are who want money okay was this\nprogrammed into me yes absolutely what\ndo I choose to believe\nhmm\ndo I choose to believe that money is the\nroot of all evil actually I don't choose\nto believe this anymore this is not my\nbelief because I know some people who\nmake a bunch of money and they do\namazing things in the world with it so\nmoney can't be the root of all evil if\nsome people can use money for good right\nyou could take that money you could\ndonate you could make 10 million dollars\nand donate all 10 million dollars to a\nfoundation to feed the hungry clearly\nthat's not the root of all evil so\nmaking money and using it for good could\nactually cause a lot of really good\nstuff so\ndo I choose to believe that money is\nroot of all evil no could I screw people\nover to make money sure do I have to no\nI don't believe that okay I'm gonna go\nahead and I'm gonna let go of this one\nand what you start to do is you start to\nlearn yourself and notice yourself more\nand so really the key to to this is to\nbecome the key to becoming self-aware is\nto become interested in yourself to\nbecome curious about yourself to start\nto learn yourself but don't let it go\ntoo far down the road\nthat you guilt yourself you shame\nyourself you hate yourself you get\npissed off at yourself because that's\nwhen self-awareness turns into being\nself-conscious and self-conscious if it\ngoes too far down the road can turn into\nanxiety social anxiety questioning\nyourself and never wanting to actually\nbe around people because you think I\nmight screw up and so it's it's a fine\nline but it's going you know what\nself-awareness is learning who I am and\ngoing you know what I want to keep\nlearning myself I want to keep improving\nmyself I want to let go of things that I\ndon't like I want to keep things that I\ndo like self-conscious is where I start\nguilting myself and shaming myself\nthat's not the route I want to go and so\nthat is how you grow your self-awareness\nand start to learn who you truly are\nbecause once again knowing yourself is\nbased in the past learning yourself is\nbased in the present we're trying to go\nfrom the present into the future we're\ntrying to figure out who you are and how\nyou can improve so
