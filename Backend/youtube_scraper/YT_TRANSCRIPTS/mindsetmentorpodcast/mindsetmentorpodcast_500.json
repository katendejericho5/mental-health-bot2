    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to be talking to\nyou of the psychology of making better\ndecisions because we as humans have so\nmany choices we have millions of choices\nthat we make every single day some of\nthem are really big choices like hey\nshould I get married should I have\nchildren and some of them are small\nchoices like what color T-shirt should I\nwear and so what do we do what is how do\nwe figure out what the right choice is\nfor us and so I'm going to go really\ndeep into a few different tips of how to\nreally make sure that you make the right\nchoices for whatever it is that you're\ntrying to do in your life so the first\none\nthat I'm going to give you is this is to\nfind your North Star in life what do I\nmean by that find your North Star means\nwhat do you want in your life what do\nyou want your life to look like and what\nis the most important thing that you\nwant to dedicate your life to\nand you create a North star and then all\ndecisions filter through that North Star\nbecause there's a million ways to make a\nmillion dollars if you're just trying to\ngo out and make money\nyou can but it's a lot easier if you're\ntrying to follow your north star and\nmoney is a byproduct of that thing and\nso there's things that you're good at\nyou probably have some great skills\nthere's a few there's a few things that\nI'm good at like I'm really really good\nat sales I'm really good at a couple\ndifferent things I'm really good at\nunderstanding people and so like for me\nlike if I look at it like I know there's\na couple things that I could follow in\nmy life and probably be very successful\nand make a bunch of money doing like I I\nlove sales I also for some reason really\nlove watches I know a lot about watches\nI've always been obsessed with them\nsince I was a little kid\nI could probably go and create a gray\nMarket used watch company and I would\nprobably love it it would be good and it\nwould be fun but it wouldn't be the most\nfulfilling thing for me to do in my life\nno probably not okay I also really love\nsports I could create something like you\nknow bar stool sports or like ESPN where\nI write about all of them I could create\na podcast talking about sports but would\nthat be a thing that I would be like man\nI want to dedicate my life to this thing\nno not really is there a bunch of money\nto be made in both of them a bunch of\nsuccess we made in both of them of\ncourse there is\nbut it's not part of my not what I want\nmy North Star to be\nmy North Star is more along the lines of\nI want to do whatever I can to take my\ntips and tricks the things that I know\nabout mindset and teach it to the world\nand really what it comes down to is\nthat's the thing in this world that\ngives me the most energy we just had an\nevent this past weekend and we had about\n75 people in a room and we went from\nfrom 9 A.M until about 7 PM every single\nday and people kept coming up to me at\nthe end and we would ask me questions\nwe'd do pictures and be like man\nyou look like you still have so much\nenergy like aren't you exhausted and I'm\nlike no like this is the thing that I\nwas made to do I get so much energy from\ndoing this this is what makes me happy\nthis is what makes me fulfilled I could\ndo this all day every day it is the\nthing that I am made to do on this earth\nthat is like my North Star and so\neverything goes and filters through that\nso you know when I was first starting\nthe podcast and I had the podcast I was\nstarting my coaching company I was\nputting content online I also\nwhen I first quit my my job to to do all\nthis to make some money I also had an\nAmazon business and my partner and I we\nwere selling about 35 000 a month so we\nwere doing pretty well within about\nthree months of opening up the business\nbut I noticed it was there was a there\nwas a little bit of a disconnect there\nwas an Amazon business and then there\nwas this coaching business and I was\nlike which one do I want to do because I\ncan't I can't put 100 of my effort into\nboth of them so I've got to choose one\nand so I I started thinking to myself if\nI fast forward 10 years do I want to be\nknown as the guy who has a successful\nAmazon business or do I want to be known\nas the guy who's coaching on people on\ntheir mindset on their life and\nhopefully changing people's lives and it\nwas like clear as day easy decision I\nwant to be known as the guy who's\ncoaching now there's no money coming in\nat this point and that side of the\nbusiness and money coming in on the\nAmazon side of the business so I called\nmy partner I said hey man\njust so you know I'm not motivated to do\nthis Amazon thing anymore you can either\nrun it on your own or we could shut it\ndown and he was like let's just shut it\ndown because I'm not passionate about\nanymore either so we shut it down even\nthough it was a thing that was producing\nrevenue and I switched and went to the\nthing that I wanted to do which was like\nmy North Star in this world and so maybe\nbeing a great parent is your North Star\nwell if you're North Stars I'm going to\nnothing matters more than me becoming\nthe best parent I can be to have the\nbest children come out into this world\nif that is your North Star then you want\nto filter all of your decisions through\nthat because what happens is we'll have\ndecisions that will come into our life\nmaybe you get\nthis amazing job offer and you're going\nto make double what you're currently\nmaking right now\namazing right but then you realize that\nyou have to travel and be out of out of\ntown half the month\nwell you maybe you'd be away from your\nchildren in their early years and you\nlook at it and you say okay well I would\nmake more money which means that I could\nprovide more money for my family maybe\nthey could\ngo to better colleges maybe they could\nyou know have be set up later on in life\nmaybe that would happen but if we also\nlook at the other side you could say but\nif I'm away from my children I can't put\nmy love that I want to in them I can't\nput my wisdom that I want to in them and\nso you ask yourself okay I'd be making\nmore money but does this job opportunity\nline up with my North Star of being the\nabsolute best parent that I could be\nto make sure that I can create the best\nchildren that I can you might make more\nmoney but you be away from their\nchildren in their formative years so\nwould you rather have more money\nor more time with your children do you\nsee how the North Star works so really\nwhat it comes down to is is what is your\nNorth Star what is it that gives you\nenergy what is it that you feel pulled\ntowards that you're just so excited\nabout you just love and you don't know\nwhy you love it so much but it just\nmakes you come alive inside because if\nyou're chasing money you're eventually\ngoing to run out of motivation you're\nnot going to want to do it as much\nanymore but when you're chasing energy\nwhen you're chasing passion\nyou have you have so much energy to do\nwhat you need to do the other thing\nthat's really good about as well is it\nalso gives you more confidence in your\ndecisions after you make them so you\ndon't constantly go back and think oh\nman did I make the right choice by\nsaying no to that job it's like no I\ndidn't make the wrong choice I made the\nright choice by saying no to that job\nbecause my North Star is being the\nabsolute best parent I can be or my\nNorth Star is being the best coach that\nI could be whatever it is that you want\nto be if it lines up with your North\nStar it was the right choice\nso that's the first thing the first tip\nI want to give you the second one is to\nget better at checking in with your gut\nyou've probably heard the phrase to\ntrust your gut right you get a gut\nfeeling about something you get a gut\nfeeling about someone you've probably\nhad a gut feeling about someone before\nlike oh yeah this this person doesn't\nfeel right but it doesn't feel right but\nit like logically makes sense and then\nsomething happens two years down the\nroad and you're like damn it I should\nhave trusted my feelings\nyou've had that happen before right damn\nit I should have listened to my I should\nhave listened to that gut feeling\nor sometimes you there's it doesn't make\na whole lot of sense but you follow your\ngut and it's like it ends up paying off\nin the long run like for me this this\npodcast is another great example of that\nlike when I quit my job and I shut down\nthe Amazon business in order to follow\nthis podcast it made no sense I was\nmaking zero dollars on this podcast I\nhad no coaching clients I was making\nzero dollars but something about it felt\nright and I was following that feeling\nand now in Fast Forward eight years it's\nlike oh yeah that makes sense isn't that\ninteresting\nhey if you're loving this episode on how\nto make better decisions please do me a\nreally quick favor give us a like down\nbelow for the YouTube algorithm And\nsubscribe so that you never miss another\nepisode and you will get notified every\nsingle time that a new episode goes up\nso trusting your gut can kind of feel\nlike this mystical unscientific approach\nto making decisions but there's a ton of\nresearch in Neuroscience that shows that\nthis isn't just a theory this isn't just\nsomething like that that sounds real\nweird and woo-wooy like it turns out\nthat your gut and your feelings or your\nintuition may actually be the most\npowerful tool that you have for making\ndecisions especially when it comes to\nassessing other people or situations for\nyour future you know we've been taught\nin our society our our society is very\nvery much like only had only head only\nthinking only rational only intellect\nonly making rational decisions because\nit makes sense on a piece of paper as if\nour emotions and our instincts and our\nfeelings are just unreliable oh feelings\ncan't be trusted but there's a saying\nthat says the heart knows what the Mind\ncannot understand\nand I always take heart and God it's\nkind of like a team they kind of the\nheart and the gut they kind of team up\ntogether and and sometimes we can't\nfully comprehend why we feel a certain\nway good or bad about a certain person\nor a situation but the feeling is really\nstill very important to consider and to\nstart to think about\nand research also shows that our gut\nfeeling or intuition is actually rooted\nin our physical bodies it's actually\nsomething that's called the enteric\nnervous system the ens enteric nervous\nsystem and it's a network of neurons\nthat's located in the walls of the\ndigestive tract\nso you actually have a second brain they\nactually call this your second brain\nyour ens is your your second brain that\nis in your gut and neurologists refer to\nthe ens and your gut is your second\nbrain because there are so many neurons\nthat are down there there's actually a\nstudy that was published in the Journal\nof American Science back in 1999 and the\nprofessor is actually Professor Michael\nD Gershon I hope I'm saying it correctly\nand he actually was in Colombia and he\nfound that the gut functions as a\nseparate and independent nervous system\nfrom your central nervous system it has\nover 500 million neurons and so the gut\ncan actually influence your cognitive\nfunction and your memory your gut is a\nreally complex system that is capable of\ninfluencing both your physiological and\nyour psychological processes and so the\ncommunication\nbetween the ens the interred nervous\nsystem and your brain is bi-directional\nwhich means that your brain is checking\nin with your gut all the time and your\ngut is checking in with your brain all\nthe time which means that your gut\nfeeling can actually influence your\nbrain as well and your brain can\ninfluence your gut\nthis is why you you will often have\nphysical Sensations in your stomach when\nyou're getting nervous or you're getting\nanxious or you're getting excited and\npeople say oh I've got what in my\nstomach I've got butterflies in my\nstomach that's actually a communication\nthat's happening inside of your body\nwhat's really interesting about it is\nthat the gut is also connected to the\namygdala the amygdala is the part of\nyour brain that processes fear\nit process fear it processes emotions\nand it plays a key role in your fight or\nflight response that means that your gut\nfeeling is not just some vague sense or\nunease or uncertainty but it's actually\na physical response to perceived threats\naround you or opportunity\nlet me say that again just so you can\nreally get this your gut feeling is\nactually a physical response to\nperceived threats in your environment\nright now or possible future but it's\nalso it can be a physical response to\nopportunity coming up in the future as\nwell and so when we get a gut feeling we\ncan say oh well yeah that doesn't make\nany sense I I'm gonna it logically makes\nsense so I'm going to do this thing I'm\ngoing to just go across I'm just going\nto not pay attention with my God has to\nsay when you get a gut feeling about\nsomeone or something\nyou should really start to pay attention\nto it because it may be our body's way\nof alerting us of potential danger in\nthe future or opportunity that our\nconscious mind just hasn't been able to\nregister yet\nso listen I understand because I am a\nvery cerebral person analytics thinking\nall the time but one of the things that\nI've had to do is I've had to learn to\nstart to pay attention to feelings I\nknow right oh I got to pay attention to\nmy feelings it feels so weird for me\nbecause I'm such a cerebral thinking\nperson but what I've tried to get really\ngood at is paying attention to my gut\nfeeling like paying attention Okay this\nlogically makes sense let me check in\nwith my body real quick let me check\nwith my gut and let's see what's going\non here do I are we on the same page or\nis my gut feel different about this\ndecision and so Studies have actually\nshown that people who trust their gut\ninstincts often are better able to\npredict outcomes and make accurate\njudgments even when they don't have all\nthe information\nthink about that for a second\nthere are actual psychological studies\nthat show that people who trust their\ngut instincts are better able to predict\noutcomes and make accurate adjust uh\naccurate judgments even when they don't\nhave all the information\nso I wouldn't say just blindly follow\nyour gut instincts all of the time\nbut\nit would be pretty smart to check in\nwith it right what if you use your gut\nfeelings and your critical thinking and\nAnalysis together\nI'm not saying just don't pay attention\nto it but we should definitely give our\ngut feelings much more weight than we\ncurrently do and so there's a big\ndifference between the brain and the gut\nand so for me I always say\nthe brain almost always because your\nbrain is trying to protect you will talk\nyou out of things that you should do but\nI feel and this is what I always say I\nthink that your gut\nis actually your emotional compass in\nlife\nit knows the decisions that you should\nmake and so what I like to do and I have\na big decision is I like to actually\ncheck in with my body\nit's very simple and so the brain\nusually tries to talk you out of\nanything that is outside of your comfort\nzone because it wants to protect you\nyour gut usually is your emotional\nEncompass that will tell you the right\nway to go and so what I like to do is if\nI have a really big decision\nI like to check in with my body and so\nwhat I do is I can think about all that\nI can think about all of this stuff what\nI'll do is I'll take a few minutes and\nit takes maybe three minutes to do this\nI'll take 60 breaths I'll go in through\nmy nose I'll breathe out through my\nmouth and the reason why is because\nthere's been Japanese studies that have\nfound that 60 breasts can actually\nchange the way a person's body feels\ncompletely it allows you to kind of get\nout of your mind and back into your body\n60 breaths in through the nose out\nthrough the mouth and then I ask myself\nwhat's the right decision\nand the answer that comes up the first\nanswer that comes up is what I go with\nand the reason why is because the first\nthing that comes up is usually a gut\nfeeling and then the brain reacts and\ntries to talk me out of the gut feeling\nalmost every single time where it's like\nshould I go and do this and it's like\nyes\nand then my brain goes wait but hold on\nbut you're also really busy right now\nyou've got this thing going on and also\nwhat if all those people if you put up\nthat video people are going to make fun\nof you and you probably shouldn't do\nthis and it's also a lot safer just to\nmake sure that you don't leave your job\nand so for me\nthe way they like to do it 60 breaths\nask myself the question what do I feel\nis the right decision in the first\nstance that comes up I try to feel in to\nthat decision and see if that's the\nright one for me so that's the second\ntip the next one is to embrace embrace\nthe breast embrace the power of the\npause and so the pause just basically\nmeans like we like to make decisions\nquickly like I'm a very quick decision\nmaker but one of the things that we\nshould really try to get better at is\npausing for a moment and reflecting so\nneurologically taking a step back allows\nthe brain to shift from more reactive\nanalysis which is like reaction reaction\nreaction which is basically the amygdala\nwhich is where the fear is into your\nprefrontal cortex which is linked with\nlogical reasoning and planning and so\nyou know if something's happening you've\nheard me say it many times in the\npodcast before when emotion is high\nlogic is low\nso if you're making an emotional\ndecision it's usually with your amygdala\nturned on which means that you're making\na decision from Fear\nmore than anything else and so what\nhappens when emotion is high it actually\nstops sending so much blood to your\nprefrontal cortex which is the executive\nfunction logical reasoning planning part\nof your brain and so when you make an\nemotional decision it's usually not the\nbest one and so you have to give\nyourself a moment of pause and so what I\nwould recommend is giving yourself 30\nminutes and then coming back to the\ndecision and that's why you know\nsometimes you're in a fight with\nsomebody\nand you say Something In the Heat of the\nMoment and in 30 minutes later you're\nlike oh yeah I probably shouldn't\nhave said that right and so that alone\nwill help you make better decisions is\nto just take a second to just\npause give yourself 30 minutes and then\ncome back to the decision when you're\nnot in a heightened state so that you\ncan think better\nokay the next thing is to do something\nusing using excuse me use something\ncalled the 10 10 rule so the 10 10 rules\nis developed by someone named Susie\nWelsh and the 10 10 rule is really a\ntool for gaining different perspectives\nand so a lot of times we make decisions\nwe make decisions thinking like well\nwhat do I want to do right now and the\nreason why is because we like all almost\nalways we like a media gratification set\nof delayed gratification and so when\nyou're making really important decisions\nyou want to use the 10 10 Rule and this\nis what it looks like okay you take out\na pen and paper and you ask yourself\nthese three questions question number\none is how will I feel about this\ndecision in 10 minutes\nyou write that question out you answer\nthat question the next question is how\nwill I feel about this decision in 10\nmonths and then you write out the answer\nto that one and then the last one is how\nwill I feel about this decision in 10\nyears and this method is really good for\ntaking an immediate emotional reaction\nand allowing you to really start to\nthink of long-term implications of your\nchoices and so an example of this could\nbe like let's say that\nlet's say that your boyfriend or your\nspouse has just been like really pissing\nyou off lately right and you're like\nwhat if I just left him\nyou're in a five-year relationship\nyou're thinking about ending that and\nyou say okay\nhow will I if I decide to leave him how\nwill I feel about this decision in 10\nminutes\nand so you decide okay well you know\nwhat maybe I would feel a little bit\nrelief I don't have to deal with all of\nhis anymore I feel pretty good in\n10 minutes if I just said you know what\nJohn get out right and you just kick\nthem on out okay cool so now we know how\nI'd feel in 10 minutes okay what about\n10 months\nyou start thinking about the next 10\nmonths you'll look like okay well I have\nto be single again Tim it really sucks\nto be single right\nbut it also is kind of cool sometimes to\nbe single because you can be on your own\nyou can ReDiscover yourself you can\nstart to realize who you are again as a\nsingle person\nthat might be fun but there's also like\num but I'd have to like start\ndownloading dating apps I've never used\na dating app before and I always talk to\nmy friends and they're like man these\ndating apps sucks like it sucks to be\nsingle nowadays\nand you might love the choice\nbut you might also miss your significant\nother in 10 months\nwhat what would that look like for you\nin 10 months and then you say how would\nI feel about this decision in 10 years a\ndecade from today if you decided to\nbreak it off after that five-year\nrelationship would that decision lead\nyou to a happier more fulfilling 10\nyears a happier more fulfilling decade a\nhappier more fulfilling long-term life\nwould you feel that you made the right\ndecision to go for the breakup pursue\nyour own personal happiness ReDiscover\nwho you are start dating again\nor would you be regretful and think man\nlike I really yeah he did some things\nthat pissed me off he never did the damn\ndishes but he was always so amazing it\nmade me feel really good about myself\nand so what you do is you actually start\nto figure out by assessing the short\nterm and the long term\ndecision and you say like what what are\nthe implications of this decision what\nwhere would I be if I decided to do it\nand it gives you just more of an\ninformed choice about the relationship's\nfuture\nand that's really important so just take\nthe 10 10 10 rule because a lot of times\nwe just think like right now what's\nright now what's right now this is what\nI want to take action on but if you say\nokay in 10 minutes I'll feel relief in\n10 years I'm gonna be like man you know\nwhat yeah he didn't do some of the\nthings but I really did actually love\nhim and maybe I made a mistake this is\nwhy a lot of times people will break up\nand then six months later they get back\nwith the persons because they're like I\nmade a mistake\nsure maybe there's some some emotional\nwounds and some bonding and all that\nstuff but maybe actually it was a better\ndecision to stay with that person and so\nyou think about your short term but also\nyour long-term consequences of your\ndecisions as well and so really that's\nwhat it comes down to is we have many\ndecisions we can make throughout the day\nhow can we make sure that we make less\ndecisions but more important decisions\nwith everything that we do how can we\nmake sure that we're following what our\nNorth Star is so we feel like we're\ndoing what we're supposed to be doing in\nthis world how do we make sure that\nwe're thinking of the short term and the\nlong-term implications of what it is\nthat we do how can we make sure that\nwith every action that we take we're\nactually trying to figure out how we're\ngoing to create the best life from it\nhow do we pause in between how do we\ncheck in with our gut how do we make\nsure that we use these different tools\nthat could really be called different\ntools to make the right decision for us\nand that's really what it comes down to\nso use these next time you're struggling\nwith taking actions so that you can make\nsure you take the right actions and\ndecisions towards a life that you're\ntrying to create so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if
