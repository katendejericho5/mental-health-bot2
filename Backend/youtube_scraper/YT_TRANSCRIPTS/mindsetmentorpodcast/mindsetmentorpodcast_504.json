    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to talk about how\nto fall in love with the process of\ntaking the action that you need to in\norder to hit your goals\nyou're here I'm assuming listening to\nthis podcast you clicked on this you\nclicked play because you are in a place\nin your life where you want to get\nbetter you want to improve and you have\nsome sort of goals that you want to hit\nnow I don't like being called a\nmotivational speaker and the reason why\nis because I'm not trying to motivate\nyou in any sort of way what I really\nwant you to do is understand yourself\nunderstand your body understand your\nbrain and understand how you normally\nhold yourself back how to get past it\nand then how to actually fall in love\nwith the process of taking action\nbecause if you're going to create the\nlife that you want to you're going to\nneed to figure out some sort of way to\ntake action you want to accomplish\nand I found that there's two ways that\nyou can accomplish and I've done both of\nthem\nand I'll tell you about it the first way\nis you can struggle your way to success\nwhich is most people this is me for the\nfirst 30-ish years of my life is I\nthought to myself in order for me to\nsucceed I'm gonna have to put my head\ndown I'm gonna have to bash through some\nwalls I'm not really big into into the\nstars and paying attention to where the\nplanets are and all that stuff I do know\nthat I am an Aries and when you look at\nAries they're you know if the symbol is\na ram and they're known to put their\nheads down and just bash through walls\nso that is kind of my typical way of of\noperating as my typical operating system\nand for the first 30-ish years of my\nlife 30 probably two years of my life it\nwas here's the goal I want I'm going to\nput my head down I'm going to struggle\nmy way to success I'm going to force\nmyself to get there no matter what which\nis fine but when you struggle your way\nto success eventually get to the point\nwhere you're like I can't do this\nanymore that's usually where burnout\ncomes from and I I've have gotten to\nquote unquote success by doing that but\nthen I've massively burnt out and just\nbeen tired of what I was doing\nthat's the first way that you can hit\nyour goals the second way is that you\ncan learn to fall in love with the\nprocess fall in love with the process of\nwho you need to become and what you need\nto do in order to achieve whatever it is\nyou're looking to achieve and it really\ngoes back to the phrase the man who\nloves walking will go further than the\nman who's running for the goal and so\nfor me the first part of my life was\nvery much like I want to make x amount\nof dollars this year and that means that\nI need to do this many sales calls I\nneed to knock on this many doors I need\nto do this many cold calls and whether I\nlove it whether I hate it no matter what\nI'm going to force myself to do it\nand that was me just running towards a\ngoal\nwhat I ended up finding out is that the\nman who loves walking will go further\nthan the man who is running for the goal\nI ended up going you know what I have\nthese goals that I have in life how do I\nget myself to actually love the process\nof taking action to actually start to\nfall in love with it and so today we're\ngoing to talk about something that's\ncalled the dopamine reward system and\nthis is huge there's actually an entire\nsection in my book where I go really\nreally deep so in my book level up the\nvery last section of part three which is\ntowards the end I talk about the\ndopamine reward system because I think\nit's so important for people to\nunderstand how they can actually know BS\nrewire their brain to fall in love with\nthe action that they need to take so\nwhen you look at the dopamine award\nsystem what does dope mean people think\nthat dopamine is a feel-good chemical in\nthe brain and it kind of is but dopamine\nis really more than anything else the\nchemical of motivation it's the chemical\nthat makes you motivated when you are\nnot motivated to do something that is\nactually called a neurobiology a low\ndopamine state so when you're sitting on\nthe couch you're like man I don't want\nto do anything you're actually in what\nneurobiologists call a low dopamine\nstate\nnow when you're in a very excited hell\nyeah this is amazing I can't wait to go\nfor this thing that's called a high\ndopamine State and dopamine the thing\nabout is it is a very external chemical\nit's not really internally based a lot\nof times people put dopamine and\nserotonin in the same sentence but\nserotonin is a chemical of here of now\nit's a internal chemical it's it's\ngratitude it's being grateful for what\nyou have dopamine is a chemical of more\nand if you look at like the most\naddicting drugs that somebody can do\nthey're always high Dome chemicals and\nso I'm not saying that you need to do\ndrugs that's not what I'm saying at all\nbut if you look at cocaine for instance\ncocaine is a high dopamine chemical and\nso you start to look at and you see well\nsomeone who doesn't have cocaine but\nreally wants cocaine they're in a really\nhigh dopamine state they're like I need\nto get it I need to get I need to get it\nand they get very motivated towards\ngetting that chemical but dopamine\nitself is the chemical of more and the\nchemical is released whenever you want\nit to be released that's the craziest\npart about it is dopamine in the the\nchemical can be released whenever you\nwant it to be which is awesome you can\ncelebrate yourself along the way along\nthe process of trying to build the life\nthat you want when you hit different\nMilestones when you take different\nactions and your brain will release a\nlittle bit of dopamine and what's cool\nabout that is that when your brain\nreleases a little bit of dopamine guess\nwhat it wants more of it wants more\ndopamine and so it wants to keep going\nand wants to keep pushing and wants to\nkeep going once you keep pushing and\nwhen you celebrate yourself even if it's\njust a small little mini celebration the\ncool thing about that is not only do you\nwant more but more than anything else\nyou're going to be driven to actually\ntake the action that you need to in your\nlife and so we're really going to dive\ninto is how to use this chemical to take\naction when you need to and to create\nthe life that you want and the best part\nabout dopamine and releasing the\ndopamine is that this right here is very\nsubjective which means that you can\ndecide when you want to feel good when\nyou want to release dopamine and when\nyou want to start motivating yourself to\ntake more action\none of the things that I found of the\nmost most common trait among the highest\nAchievers like the greatest Achievers In\nOur Lifetime if you look at for instance\nMichael Jordan if you look at Kobe\nBryant if you look at the greatest CEOs\nsome might say that their their number\none key to success is hard work it's\ndedication it's Obsession and I would\nsay that that they are definitely hard\nworkers they are definitely obsessed\nthey are definitely dedicated but most\nof them fell in love with the process of\ntaking the action that they need to they\nfell in love with what it is that\nthey're doing this is why you can see\nsomeone become worth a hundred million\ndollars and people are always like man\nthey've got all the money in the world\nwhy don't they stop like they could just\nsit back and enjoy their life it's\nbecause doing what got them to that end\nresult is actually what they love they\nlove the feeling of waking up and\nbuilding themselves to be the greatest\nathlete alive or they love the feeling\nof waking up\nin building the business that changes\nthe world or making their perfecting the\nprocess of their sales system like they\nactually truly enjoy it most people when\nthey think about work and putting in\nhard work it's immediate resistance of\nlike I don't want to do that that\ndoesn't sound fun these people though\nfell in love with the process and so I'm\nsure they probably didn't do it on\npurpose\nbut most of them probably set up a\ndopamine reward system that they\nattached to the process and so when you\nlook at a dopamine reward system what\nexactly is that it is a way for your\nbrain to release some dopamine after you\naccomplish something that's part of your\nprocess now\nlet me give you some examples okay when\nI was first in my my sales company when\nI was 19 20 years old I didn't know it\nand I'm not even sure if my manager knew\nit but he set up a dopamine reward\nsystem process for me and so we would\nsit down and we would make a lot of cold\ncalls and if you've ever done cold calls\nbefore it's one of the worst things to\ndo it sucks to sit down and make cold\ncalls and so we would have these things\ncalled phone jams and we would make a\nhundred phone calls in like three or\nfour hours we'd sit down at a table with\na phone a bunch of numbers and we would\njust call through all of them and that\nis not fun it's not motivating and so\nthe thing that my manager actually had\nme do was he's like hey man do you like\ncandy and I was like yes I'm basically\nlike a crackhead when it comes to sugar\nand that's why I keep it out of my house\nhe said what's your favorite candy I\nsaid Skittles and he said okay here's\nwhat I want you to do\nI want you to go and before you come\ninto to make your phone calls I want you\nto get a bag of Skittles and what I want\nyou to do is I want you to allow\nyourself to have three Skittles after\nevery 10 calls and so I would go okay\nand so I'd put the Skittles out on the\ntable in front of me and I would have\nthree of them right there and I'd say\nokay when I get my first 10 phone calls\ndone I get three Skittles so I'd make my\nphone calls because I was like crackhead\nwanting to get those Skittles right and\nso I'd make those 10 phone calls and\nthen I get three Skittles and then I\nwould make another 10 phone calls and I\nwould get three Skittles and I would\nmake another 10 phone calls and I would\nget three Skittles and by the time I\nfinished and I was done with my 100\ncalls I could finish the rest of the bag\nand it wasn't the finishing of the 100\nphone calls that I could have them it\nwas all along the way the process of\nactually making the phone calls and so\nthis is what's really important about\nthis is where most people mess up\nand I did this for years is we thought\nwe think to ourselves I will not be\nhappy until I achieve XYZ I will not be\nhappy until I make a hundred thousand\ndollars this year\nyou can do that but you're talking about\nnot releasing dopamine until you achieve\nthe goal and so even if I were to sit\nthere and say okay I've got Skittles\nright here and I could have them but I\ncan only have my bag of Skittles after I\nfinish the 100 phone calls well what\nhappens is I'm I'm taking my goals and\nI'm only releasing dopamine in my brain\nand getting myself excited and more\nexcited to want more after I finish the\n100 phone calls which could be four\nhours from now\nor you could if you remember ET for\nthose of you guys that are older and\nremember E.T when they were trying to\nget ET out and they they put like a\nrhesus pieces and then another one like\nthree feet later and another three feet\nlater it was like the it was like the\nbreadcrumbs that they were basically\ntrying to get him to follow but he's\nfollowing Reese's Pieces and he would\ncome out and he would eat one of them\nand then he'd go a little bit further\nand he'd another one he'd go a little\nbit further and eat another one that's\nwhat you're basically trying to do for\nyourself you're trying to pull yourself\nto where you want to go and giving\nyourself a little bit of the reward\nalong the way\na little bit of the word a long way a\nlittle bit of the word along the way\nuntil you have completed the task that\nyou want to and so that's one way that\nyou could use it another way you could\nuse it as well is visual progress bars\nand trackers and so you could create a\nprogress bar or a tracker for tasks or\nhabits that you're trying to establish\nand what happens is this is actually\nsomething that Jerry Seinfeld's really\nfamous for doing is years ago it was\nlike in the 1990s when he was just\nstarting to become a really big comic\nAnother comic who's brand new and up to\nhim and he's like hey man like I'm\ntrying I'm trying to get to your level\nI'm trying to become better I'm a new\ncomic what's the best tip that you can\ngive me\nand he said what I do is I write jokes\nevery single day no matter what and they\nsometimes they're good jokes majority of\ntime they're terrible jokes but I'm\ntrying to get myself into the habit of\nwriting all day every day as many times\nI can and so what he would do is he\nactually set this exact same thing up a\nvisual progress to track what he was\ndoing and so it became known as the\nSeinfeld calendar and so what he did was\nhe had a a month that was printed out\nand he put it up on his wall so he had\nlike those old school calendars up on\nhis wall and when he would accomplish\nhis task of writing for say 20 minutes\nfor the day and let's say just did 20\nminutes every single day if that's what\nit was then what he would do is he would\nwalk up to that calendar and he would\nput a big red X over that calendar that\nthat one day that he got done\nthat alone made him feel good that is a\ndopamine reward system for checking off\nthe day and getting that thing\naccomplished and then the next day he'd\nsit down\nhe'd do 20 minutes and he would put\nanother red X next eight sit down 20\nminutes put another red X and what\nhappens is he started to make a chain of\nred x's and once you start to see that\nchain guess what you don't want to do\nnow you don't want to break the chain\nyou want to continue the chain you want\nto keep it going and so you could use\nvisual things like this to help yourself\ndo it another thing that you could do as\nwell is to set up Social accountability\nand praise and so let's say that you\nwant to\num let's say that you want to go to the\ngym every day for the next 30 days\nyou're going to call up your best friend\nand you're going to say Hey listen I'm\nreally trying to get in this habit of\njust going to the gym no matter what\nI would like for you to hold me\naccountable to it is that cool like yeah\nof course okay here's what I'm going to\ndo I'm going to let you know every\nsingle time I get done at the gym I'm\neither going to call you or I'm going to\ntext you just to make sure that I that I\nget my my day done and I get my workout\ndone for the day I don't need you to do\nanything else except for say great job\nor I'm proud of you or hell yes or\nwhatever it might be I just need some\nmini form of Celebration\nthen what happens you go to the gym the\nnext day you send them a text message\nmaybe you at the gym all sweaty you know\nI just got my workout done and they send\nyou a text message back and they're like\nI'm so proud of you amazing find that\none friend that's like the friend that's\njust we all have those friends are just\nlike every time you're around them you\nfeel good because they're like oh my God\nI love your shirt oh my God you look\namazing today go for that friend find\nthe very positive affirmation friend\nthat you have and what's good about it\nis then you send the picture to them and\nthey send you the thing back and guess\nwhat they say hey great job I'm so proud\nof you and you're like I feel good\nabout myself guess what that does a\nlittle bit of dopamine you could also do\nthis exact same thing at the gym for\nyourself so maybe you go to the gym and\ninstead of celebrating yourself and this\nis the thing you don't want to celebrate\nyourself when you lose 20 pounds you\nwant to celebrate yourself for showing\nup at the gym because that makes you\nmore likely to want to show up at the\ngym tomorrow but what if you were to\nmake it even smaller increments what if\nnot only do you celebrate yourself when\nyou walk into the gym of like hell yeah\nyou did it today I'm so proud of you\nwhat if you also did after every single\nset you look yourself in the eye\nat the gym in the mirror because you\nobviously all gyms are surrounded by\nmirrors you look yourself in the eye and\nin your head you say you're doing\n amazing I'm so proud of you\nyou're doing amazing at this after every\nsingle set you start to feel good and\nguess what you want you want to do more\nyou want to do more you want to do more\nbecause all too often we set up what's\ncalled results-based goals instead of\naction-based goals which I'll talk about\nin just a minute where we say oh well\nI'm only going to be happy when I\naccomplish XYZ that's not the way to get\nsuccessful the way to do it is to say\nI'm going to celebrate myself every\nsingle time I do what I'm supposed to do\nand if you go back and you look at us I\nmentioned a minute ago Kobe Bryant\nKobe Bryant's a perfect example he was\nknown for being like hardcore obsessed\nwith playing basketball and he would\nwake up and be at the gym at almost\nevery single morning at 4am and what he\ndid was he would celebrate himself he\nwas proud of himself knowing that he was\nat the gym when all of his competition\nwas sleeping and so he would be excited\nabout himself being there when everyone\nelse was sleeping and so throughout the\nentire two or three hour workout he's\nthinking to himself this is amazing I'm\ngoing to beat everybody I'm going to be\nthe best basketball player that ever\nexisted and so what happened was he set\nup a dopamine reward system about\nshowing up at four o'clock in the\nmorning and guess what he did he showed\nup the next day at four o'clock in the\nmorning and the next day and research\nshows that celebrating yourself will\nmake you more motivated to do it again\nresearch also shows that having a small\npiece of chocolate everybody small piece\nof chocolate not an entire Snickers bar\nbut a small piece of chocolate after a\nworkout made somebody more likely to\nshow up and do it again the next day so\nstart to think about this how can you\nstart to celebrate yourself more often\nbecause all too often we're our own\nworst critic\nand that's going to actually demotivate\nyou from taking the action that you need\nto how can you celebrate yourself for\ntaking action how can you celebrate\nyourself after every single set it\ndoesn't have to be candy it can be candy\nbut it can just be literally a mini\ncelebration inside of your head\nand the best part about it like I said\nearlier is that a dopamine wart system\nis fully subjective which means that you\ncan decide you know after I finish\nrecording an episode I change my shirt\nand then I do a mini celebration and\nit's like the I try to fill myself up\nwith the excitement and the\naccomplishment of creating an amazing\nepisode and instead of going oh man well\nyou should have said this but you said\nyou said this which is what most of us\ndo right oh damn that was a good episode\nbut you did you should have said this\nand you oh you forgot this one part\nbut it's like I try to fill myself up\nwith that was amazing great job I'm so\nproud of you so many people this is\ngoing to change their life and it makes\nme want to come back and do the next one\nand notice what I did was I attached it\nto the process of finishing a podcast\nepisode not the end result of getting 5\nmillion downloads it's the process of\njust getting it done which is what\nmatters this is why you hear about Kobe\nBryant and Michael Jordan winning\nchampionships and then waking up the\nnext day and going to work out\nwhen you listen to I actually heard an\ninterview with the guy who was Michael\nJordan and Kobe Bryant's trainer Tim\nGrover and he said the hardest thing\nabout Kobe Bryant was trying to get him\nto stop\nlike he was that obsessed but because he\njust loved the process of building\nhimself into the best basketball player\nhe could become it wasn't about winning\nchampionships it was about being the\nbest that they could be living up to\ntheir full potential and what happened\nwas winning the championship was just a\nbyproduct of them falling in love with\nthe process\nit was the byproduct of them putting in\nthe work and falling in love with\nbecoming the best they could possibly be\nand this is this is why people who are\nwildly successful like I said earlier\njust don't stop because it was never\nabout the money most people attach they\nthink of their goals as the money to be\nmade oh I want to accomplish this I'll\nbe happy when I make this amount of\nmoney I'll be happy when I get this\nhouse I'll be happy when I can buy\nmyself this car money should just be a\nbyproduct of your actions not the actual\ngoal that you're searching for and so\nwhat you want to learn to do is you want\nto learn to attach reward systems to the\neffort not the end result\nso attach it to the effort not the end\nresult so that would be the difference\nbetween an action-based goal versus a\nresults-based goal the action-based goal\nis getting it done the results based\ngoal is like I'll be happy when I make\n100 Grand so you want to attach it to\ngetting the things done that need to be\ndone and then the byproduct will be\nhitting the goals that you would want to\nhit so you would attach for instance a\nreward system to the action-based goal\nof making the calls not making the sale\nyou would attach a reward system to the\naction-based goal of finishing a workout\nnot losing 50 pounds you would attach a\nreward system to the action-based goal\nof reading five pages every single\nmorning not finishing the book you would\nattach a reward system to the\naction-based goal of eating a healthy\nmeal not the way that you look in the\nmirror\nyou would attach a reward system to the\naction-based goal of practicing for an\nhour at your sport not winning the\nchampionship you would attach a reward\nsystem to the action-based goal of\nlearning one difficult bar of music not\nplaying the entire piece\nand that's what you want to focus on is\nfocus on the action-based goals not the\nresults-based goals and so really what\nit comes down to is you're listening\nthis podcast episode is you need to ask\nyourself what do I want what do I want\nto accomplish and you find out that\ndestination that you're searching for\nand then from that you ask yourself what\nactions do I need to take what are the\ndaily actions I need to take what is the\nprocess look like that I need to take in\norder to achieve that goal\nand then how can you set up a dopamine\nreward system to attach to that process\nso let's say you want to make a hundred\nthousand dollars a year because I've\nsaid that a couple times you want to\nmake a hundred thousand dollars this\nyear okay cool what actions do I need to\ntake in order to get there well I need\nto make 75 phone calls every single day\nwell then you don't reward yourself when\nyou make a hundred thousand dollars you\nreward yourself every seven phone calls\nthat you make and then what you do is\nyou go seven phone calls seven seven\neventually gets to 75 throughout the day\nand then you reward yourself again and\nyou really start to ask yourself how can\nI set up a dopamine reward system to\nattach to the process not the end result\nto the action-based goals not the\nresults-based goals because if you just\nfocus on the action and celebrate\nyourself for it you're more likely to\nshow up which then makes you more likely\nto achieve whatever it is that you want\nin the future success is a byproduct of\nthe action-based goals so how can you\nset up your dopamine reward system and\nfall in love with the process so that's\nwhat I
