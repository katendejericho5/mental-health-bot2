    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to purge stuff from your life\nwe're going to talk about going through\na massive Purge and it's something that\nI recommend that you do a few times a\nyear two to four times a year is what I\nrecommend either every six months or\nevery quarter and it's kind of like\nspring cleaning but it would be spring\ncleaning it'd be also be summer cleaning\nand also be fall cleaning and winter\ncleaning for your entire life I don't\nmean that you have to just go through\nand Purge your clothes or just go ahead\nand dust up every corner of your house\nyou can definitely do it if you want I'm\ntalking about the whole the whole person\nthat you are I want you to look around\nyour entire life\nand look at something and say is this\nserving me anymore and if it's not\nserving you anymore can you let go of it\ncan you actually Purge it because\nimagine this just imagine that every\nsingle thing and this is the way I like\nto think about things imagine that every\nsingle thing that you own you know it\ncould be from a car to a house to a\npencil\nevery one of those things occupies a\nlittle teeny piece of your brain even if\nit's a a pen that is inside of your\ndrawer that you haven't seen in three\nyears just imagine that every single one\nof them owns a piece of your brain just\na little tiny piece\nhow much of your brain is scattered all\nover the place what if we could get rid\nof all of the things that are not\nserving Us in any sort of way and I'll\ntell you what I mean by serving you in\njust a minute and start going you know\nwhat\nif it's not serving me there's no reason\nto have it anymore\nif it's not serving there's no reason to\nhave it and so when I talk about serving\nyou what I mean by is it helping you get\nto where you want to go in life is it\nhelping you or is it hurting you and if\nit's not helping you there's no real\nreason for it to be around but we like\nto hoard things and go well maybe in the\nfuture I will need this thing that I've\nhad for 17 years but haven't used it in\nso long it's like why don't you just\nPurge those things why don't you just\nlet go of them why don't you just have\nand I'm not talking about being a\nminimalist which I do think that that\nwould be good for a lot of people but\njust having less so that you can have\nmore mental space that's really the way\nI like to think about it because all too\noften we hang on to things that we just\ndon't really need them around anymore\nthat could be physical things but it\ncould also be thoughts it could be\nhabits it could be other people because\nwe think we might need them later on\ndown the road but if it's not propelling\nyou forward in life it's weighing you\ndown in some sort of way and when you\npurge you move faster you feel lighter\nlife becomes more effortless you think\nquicker on your feet and you don't have\nthat mental energy scattered all over\nthe place and so some of you may have\nnever done this before\nonce again I'm not just talking about\ncleaning out your environment that will\nbe a part of it but really some of you\nhave never done this before which means\nthat when you do this you will feel like\na different person it will help you and\nI like to call it the Great Purge and\nreally the Great Purge it's not the most\nfun day it's not the most fun thing you\ncould do and some people are going to\nlisten to this podcast episode and\nyou're not going to do I already\nknow that but some of you are going to\nlisten this podcast episode you're going\nto do it you're going to implement it\nand it's going to make you feel better\nand what you do is you take one day and\nyou do nothing but Purge you get rid of\nwhatever is not serving you whatever is\nnot propelling you to be better and I'm\ngoing to teach you all the different\ncategories and just a few that popped up\ninto my head as I was planning this\nthere's quite a few more but really this\nis it's not just spring cleaning it is\nmental and emotional cleaning as well it\nis mental emotional cleaning more than\nit's spring cleaning so when I say like\noh throw away of a pen yeah that's fine\nlike you could throw away a pen but I'd\nprefer you throw away that toxic\nrelationship of this person that's just\nbeen kind of lingering around and you're\nsaying to yourself well you know I'm\nkeeping them around because we were\nfriends in middle school and I would\nfeel really bad if I didn't hang out\nwith them anymore but there's a part of\nyou that knows\nthey're\nthey're holding me back like there's\nthey're really just holding me back in\nsome sort of way and so you know we\ncould talk about physical objects so we\nwill but we're going to really dive into\nsome deep stuff and we're going to go\nthrough every single thing in your house\nevery single thing in your in your\nrelationships every single thing in your\nthoughts all of that stuff and we're\njust going to get rid of everything that\ndoesn't serve you purge anything doesn't\nserve you stop hoarding all the things\neverything that you own takes a tiny\npiece of real estate in your\nsubconscious and so we want to design\nyour life to support you in hitting your\ngoals hitting your goals is hard enough\nbut if you have all of these things that\nare just holding you back in some sort\nof way it's only making it harder so\nwouldn't it be easier if we could just\nmake it easier on you that's what we're\ntrying to do so let's dive into it\nmental\nwhat about thoughts what are some\nthoughts that you have you know with uh\nwith my wife we well I'm gonna have her\non the podcast sooner we're going to\ntalk through this but uh we were\ntogether for like five years before she\nreally opened up to me and told me that\nshe was so tough on herself and just\ntalked so much to herself and\neventually she got to a point where\nshe's like this isn't serving me being\nthis way is not serving me talking\nto myself is not helping me get to where\nI want to go and so really what it came\ndown to is a mental Purge of like how do\nI speak to myself\nand is that helping me or is that\nhurting me because if you're like I said\nhitting your goals is hard enough but\nyou're if you're shitty to yourself\nman that's so much harder it's like\nsomebody punching you in the face as\nyou're trying to run the marathon right\njust makes it it's unnecessary you don't\nneed to so I want you to think of like\ninside of your own head what goes on\nwhat which how do you talk to yourself\nwhat fears do you have are those fears\nhelping you in some sort of way because\nsome fears can help you in some way but\na lot of fears really hold you back and\nso really start to take\nyou know take a pen and paper write this\nstuff down and think like okay category\nof mental how do I speak to myself what\nfears do I have what limiting beliefs do\nI have are these things helping me or\nare they hurting me and if they're\nhurting you how can you start to work\nthrough them now the the process of my\nwife starting to work through the way\nthat she talks to herself has been years\nnow three or four years she's been\nworking on it and she's way better than\nshe was but we had a conversation a\ncouple days ago and she's still not\nwhere she wants to be she still says\nsome things she still holds herself back\nmentally and that's just a process of\njust purging them slowly starting you\nknow she tried if she could get rid of\nall of them at once she can flip a\nswitch she definitely would but\nsometimes things have been there they've\nbeen habits for so long that's just\nreally hard to let go of the way that\nyou talk to yourself and so thoughts\nthat go through your head maybe you're\nmore of like a a pessimist is that\npessimism really helping you get to\nwhere you want to go\nsomething to think about and you start\nto go through your life and say like in\nthe way that I speak to myself and the\nway that I think of things maybe you're\nmaybe you don't talk trash to yourself\nbut maybe you sit there and you're like\nwell I want to do this thing and you say\noh yeah but\nI've never really been a motivated\nperson I've always kind of been lazy is\nit like is that mindset helping you or\nis it hurting you and how do we start to\nactually switch it so the first category\nI think of is mental next thing I think\nof are your habits what habits do you\nhave we all have tons of habits about 47\nAccord according to Harvard\npsychologists a study they did about 47\nof what you do on a daily basis is\nhabits so can we start to become aware\nof our habits and say does this habit\nhelp me like if you have a habit of\nwaking up early in the morning that's\nprobably a habit that you want to keep\nif you have the habit of uh you know\neating Twinkies at 11 PM at night is\nthat one helping you get to where you\nwant to go you start thinking about the\nhabits that you have and you take a\nmental assessment of the entire day from\nthe moment that you wake up to the\nmoment that you go to bed and you say\nlike what are my habits like the things\nthat I consistently do I brush my teeth\nevery single morning is that helping me\nyeah I would recommend you continue to\nbrush your teeth and you start thinking\nabout all the things that you do on a\ndaily basis oh usually after eating I\nusually get a cup of coffee is that\nhelping me or hurting me well it depends\non who you are and what you're trying to\ndo and while I'm drinking that cup of\ncoffee I spend 45 minutes on Instagram\nthat's probably not helping you so is\nthat something that you need to purge\nyou start thinking about the habits that\nyou have throughout the day\nhey if you're loving this podcast\nepisode about purging things from your\nlife do me a favor for the YouTube\nalgorithm give us a like down below it\nhelps more than you know and if you have\nany topics you want me to cover comment\nthem down below in the comments I'll\ncheck them out and maybe you will see\none of your comments and your topic\ncovered in a future episode\nnext one going to be a really big one\nand also triggering for a lot of people\nis your relationships go through all of\nyour relationships and ask yourself is\nyour relationship with this person\nhelping you or is it hurting you and it\ncould be friends it could be family it\ncould be significant others it could be\npeople that you follow on Instagram\nthat's a big one as well I'll cover in\njust a minute but one of the things I\nwant you to think about is and I've said\nthis on the podcast and I've gotten some\nsome backlash on this before of people\nfrom the podcast as well is if somebody\nis holding you back in your life if\nsomebody talks down to you if they make\nyou feel less then if they make your\nlife less peaceful no matter who they\nare there should be an opportunity where\nif you want to you could let them go and\nthis does even go back to your parents\nand this is where I get a bunch of\nbacklash oh my gosh how could you ever\ntell someone to get rid of their father\nand then I what I say to them is if you\nheard some of the stories of what some\npeople's fathers have done to them you'd\ngo oh yeah they should definitely get\nthem out of their life\nbecause maybe your relationship with\nyour father is not toxic\nbut when you hear somebody's\nrelationship with their father and what\nis it they do and and some of the toxic\npeople that are in other people's lives\nyou'd go oh yeah yeah I would um\nyeah you should get rid of that guy\nright so that's I get a lot of backlash\nevery time I talk about purging your\nparents if they are toxic or you know\nspending less time with them people like\nhow could you ever say that I'm like if\nyou could hear some of the stories that\nI've been told from people about what\ntheir parents have done to them and what\nthey continue to do to them daily every\nsingle day I get a message on Instagram\nthe other day and it was just terrible\nabout how someone's mother treats them\nand this the what what they say to them\nbut you know it's one of the someone's\nmother says that almost on on a daily\nevery single day their their mother\ncalls him a piece of I'm like\nthat's sounds pretty damn toxic and so\nyou might be like well you can't get rid\nof your mother but you have a great\nrelationship with your mother well\nthere's there's other people you never\nreally know what people are going\nthrough and so\nit's something to think about and it's\ntough It's Not Easy I know it's not easy\nbut you can start distancing yourself\nfrom some people\nanother thing that I would recommend is\nthe people that you follow on Instagram\nevery couple months I go through my\nInstagram and I unfollow like 150 200\npeople because I'm like is this person\nhelping or hurting me in about two years\nago especially when all the stuff with\ncovid was happening and it was It was\nkind of really ramping up I unfollowed a\nlot of people because I realized that I\nwould wake up in the morning and you\nknow I'd go through my morning routine\nand then I'd spend about five ten\nminutes on Instagram and I would see\nsome people's stories and some people I\ndidn't realize but about an hour later I\nwas like man I feel like why do I\nfeel so bad and I realized that I was\nseeing people's stories they were just\ntalking about Doom and Gloom and\nconspiracies and this and that and they\nwere both sides you know the right and\nthe left and they were saying this thing\nand that thing and this thing and that\nthing and I was like oh my God\nseeing other people's stories is making\nme feel bad throughout the day and so I\njust went through and I said do I do I\nenjoy following this person anymore\nand what you have to rise is when you\ndecide to follow somebody\nI heard James Clear say this one time\nwhen you decide to follow somebody\nyou're deciding your future thoughts so\nif you look at what they're doing you're\nfollowing somebody that's a\nquote-unquote celebrity in other on a\nreality show and they're just trashing\nother people and it's taking they're\nthrowing people under the bus and it's\ndrama drama drama drama drama is that\ndrama helping your life get better or do\nyou think there might be a part of your\nmind that's kind of you know being\npulled down by it so what are some\npeople you should stop following in real\nlife and also on Instagram as well\nanother thing you could think about\npurging as well go through all of the\nfood in your house yesterday literally\nyesterday I opened up the pantry and I\nwas like we have so much food that's\njust sitting here that we haven't used\nin like two years I was like we gotta\nPurge this entire thing\nit's actually what inspired me to make\nthis podcast episode so I was like we\nhave so Lauren we have so much in\nhere we got to get rid of some of these\nthings we have rice from like 12 years\nago it feels like like it's just old it\ndoesn't need to be in the house it's\nlike I open up the pantry and there's\njust so much clutter I'm like this\ndoesn't just it doesn't feel good to\nopen up this thing I have to like search\nfor stuff so we decided on this weekend\nwe're just gonna Purge the pantry so is\nthere food in the house you know if\nyou're trying if you're on your fitness\njourney there's a certain food that you\nneed to purge from the house therefore\nyou don't get tempted so there's food in\nthe house what about your finances what\nare you spending money on have you\nactually gone through and looked at your\nfinances and see where you're spending\nyour money and seeing like oh man like I\nhave this thing I've been paying 12 a\nmonth for\nI haven't used it in in two years well\nwhy don't you recoup you have it's 12\nhours a month 12 months that's 144\ndollars a year could you recoup some\nextra finances so start looking through\nyour finances and purging some of the\nthings that you don't need anymore what\nabout your living situation\nmaybe you live with a roommate and\nyou're like you know what living in this\nroommate I've been trying to wake up\nearly I'm trying to change my life but\nthey're up late they're partying they\nbring people over and they wake me up in\nthe middle of the night maybe your\nliving situation needs to change and it\nmight not be like an immediate thing\nthat changes today but it's something\nthat you could start moving towards so\nyou could change your living situation\nalso when you look at your living\nsituation think about your entire house\ndoes your house facilitate you growing\nand becoming better I always say this\nall the time so many people spend time\nwatching too much TV and if you find\nyourself watching too much TV can you go\nfor the next 30 days I'm gonna take my\nTV off the wall I'm gonna throw it\ninside of the closet and I'm just gonna\nput books on the the coffee table\ninstead when you come over to my house\nwe have like 10 books in the coffee\ntable just because there's sometimes I\nfind myself there and it's like I could\nbe on Instagram or I could pick up a\nbook and at least I have the decision\nI'm like I'm gonna pick up this book\ninstead and so look at your living\nsituation\nnext thing I think about technology what\ntechnology do you have in your life that\nyou don't really need anymore we go back\nto the TV I just explained like are you\nspending too much time you'll be really\ngood as if Netflix had like had like\nscreen time the same way that you have\nscreen time on your iPhone Netflix came\nin and said at a weekly report this is\nhow much time you spent every single day\non Netflix most people like what the\nhell I think the average person spends\nabout two and a half to three hours a\nday on Netflix and so do you spend too\nmuch time on your on your TV\ncould you start to purge some of that\nwhat about social media are there social\nmedia apps you're spending too much time\non you can delete\nI don't know it's completely up to you I\nknow that I took Instagram off my phone\nuh and I have I have two phones I have\nmy personal phone and I have my business\nphone and my business phone is where I\npost on Instagram and it stays inside of\nmy office I never move it from It's\nAlways charging all the time\nand I have Instagram on that phone I\ndon't have it on my personal phone I\ntook it off my screen time went down 22\npercent the very first week I gained 22\npercent\nback it was like an hour and 15 minutes\nI gained back just from not having it so\nmaybe you could try out purging some\nsocial media for a little while try it\nfor 30 days if you don't like it and you\nwant it you want to have it back\nre-download it not a big deal okay what\nabout your physical possessions like\nwhat are things that you actually own\nwhere you're like I don't need this\nanymore this is too much stuff what's\nyour garage look like oh God right\nprobably have a lot of stuff in your\ngarage you get rid of what are your\npossessions look like could you have a\ngarage sale make some extra money do\nsome of that money go to a conference\nwhat if you decided to get rid of some\nof the possessions that are just hanging\nout in your garage that you don't have\nanymore you had a garage sale you get an\nextra thousand two thousand bucks and\nyou're like you know what I'm gonna go\nto a self-development conference then\nyou go to some sort of conference or\nmaybe go to some Conference of something\nthat you're interested in maybe you're\ninterested in cryptocurrency and you go\nto cryptocurrency conference whatever it\nmight be and you actually start working\ntowards your goals a little bit more\nwouldn't that be better than just\nkeeping that stuff in there because\nthose things are worth money you can get\nrid of them you haven't been golfing in\n12 years you still have your golf clubs\nmaybe you can make a couple hundred\nbucks off those golf clubs right so you\nstart thinking about the possessions\nthat you have as well\nand then the last thing and there's many\ncategories of life last thing I think of\nis like your goals and your vision your\ngoals and your vision are going to\nchange over time you could Purge some\ngoals ah this doesn't really line up you\nknow this is we're halfway through the\nyear this one that I had there was a New\nYear's resolution doesn't really line up\nwith me anymore\nI'm going to change this around a little\nbit I'm going to make it different what\nabout your vision your vision should\nchange over life like you should always\nknow kind of the direction that your hat\nyou're going in like your North Star\nwhere you're following this thing but\nthere might be some things that don't\nnecessarily align with you anymore and\nthat's completely fine what we're really\ntrying to work at here is to clear out\nanything that that does not serve you\nand does not Propel you and help you in\nbecoming the type of person you want to\nbecome and really accessing your true\npotential here because I believe that\nwe're all here to experience life and\nhave fun and see what it's like to be a\nhuman and to really find out what our\ntrue potential could be and if anything\ngets in the way of that can we just\nPurge it and this is something really\ngood to do if you've never done it\nbefore do it this weekend okay take a\nday I know it's a lot of work hey so is\nalso creating the life that you want but\nit will benefit you and be able to have\nmore mental Clarity more space when you\nstart to purge the things that you don't\nreally need anymore so that is how you\naccess your true potential so that's\nwhat I got for you for today if you love\nthis podcast episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me in at\nRob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-jr and I'm Gonna Leave You\nthe same way I leave every single\npodcast
