    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today I'm going to be talking\nabout how to stop suffering now as a\nhuman\nwe all suffer it is just part of being a\nhuman there is nothing that you can do\nto get away from it and we're going to\ndive into it today and in fact in\nBuddhism suffering is a basic human fact\nnow that sounds really depressing I get\nit but really it comes down to removing\nourselves from suffering I think\num as we are raised we are told who\nwe're supposed to be who are not\nsupposed to be and we have to change\nourselves in order to fit in with\nSociety we are as I like to say\ndomesticated we are domesticated as\nchildren to fit in with society and so\nwe learn to not like parts of ourselves\nto not like parts of society we\num fine people are good people are bad\nwho are supposed to be close with who\nare not supposed to be close with and it\nsounds really depressing to say that\nsuffering is just a part of life but I'm\nnot talking about pain pain is a part of\nlife as well I'm talking about suffering\nwhich is created in the human mind and\nwe're going to talk about how to remove\nthat and really what it comes down to if\nyou look at humans I like to look at\neverything and try to make it as simple\nas possible to break it down for someone\nas humans we are animals but we're\nanimals with a incredible piece of\nMachinery between our ears the problem\nthough is that most people are not\nraised understanding how to use this\npeace machine you're like we're not\ngiven a manual on our brains on our\nmindset on our psychology and how to\nactually use it for our benefit and so\nin turn if we don't know how to use it\ncorrectly and we don't know what it what\nit does what it doesn't do it's going to\nbe really hard to Wrangle it down but\nthe difference between animals and\nhumans though is that animals\ndo not suffer like humans and when I say\nsuffer I don't mean like they're being\nkilled by another animal and they're not\nsuffering in that moment that would be\npain in that moment but what I mean is\nthe suffering that goes on in our minds\nlike I can sit next to my dog on my\ncouch looking out the window and my dog\ncan be peaceful all day long he can just\nbe there he can be present he's calm I\ncan see his deep breaths which means\nhe's relaxed and he just does not suffer\nbut I can sit right next to him and I\ncould be freaking the out in my own\nmind right I can be stressing I can be\nanxious simply because of what's going\non in my mind and nothing else not\nbecause of the outside world but because\nof my inside world you ever been there\nbefore where you do that where it's just\nlike you're sitting there and there's no\nreason to really be suffering but we're\nputting ourselves through it and so when\nI say pain versus suffering pain\nit's just part of life like there's pain\nthere will be things there will be\npeople who die people who leave you\nthere will be physical pain all of his\nstuff is pain suffering is the\nprolonging of that pain past the moment\nof it actually happening when someone\nbreaks up with you that's painful they\ndid break up with you suffering is\nresisting it for the next six months and\nso we're going to dive into this and\nreally go really deep but I do want you\nto understand this\nyou know maybe if you were a Buddhist\nmonk and you were sitting in some\nMonastery and you were completely away\nfrom people you could get to a point\nwhere there is no suffering in your life\nwhere your mind is just completely at\nease I would even eventually say that\nmost monks if we were to pull them out\nof the monasteries and throw them in the\nmiddle of a big city like New York City\nthere would be some suffering in their\nown minds eventually right but there is\nthe way I like to think of of this is\nthat there is no destination\nmaybe I get to the end of my life and I\ncompletely relieve all of my suffering\nmaybe I get to that but I don't really\nexpect that I will I just expect that it\nis kind of part of life the same way\nthat I have to breathe in oxygen some\nway that we have to have the sun in\norder for plants to grow to stay alive I\nhave to drink water there's just aspects\nof life that aren't facts and suffering\njust might be a fact and that's okay so\nif I get to the end of my life and I\nhave not relieved all my suffering it's\nall right there is no destination but\nhopefully I'll just have less suffering\nin my life as I continue to work on\nmyself so that's really what I'm talking\nabout when I'm talking about this and if\nyou fully understand the suffering and\nwhat I'm going to talk about today and\nyou embody it it will 100 make you\nhappier I can promise you that and so\nI'm going to break it down into what I\ncall the Three L's okay\nlet's dive into it there's three\ndifferent L's that cause suffering in\nour lives the first one is longing\nlonging for something in the way\nthat I see it so it when I think of\nlonging it's longing for something by\nnot having what it is that you want and\nso desire is a part of it desire is\nactually a part of all of these just so\nyou know desire is kind of like the\nunderlying piece of it and so it's\nwanting something thinking that that\nthing will complete me or that will make\nme feel more complete or will make me\nfeel more whole it's the it's the\nfeeling of I will be happier when I have\nX I will be happier when I get that\nraise I will be happier when I get that\nwatch I will be happier when we move\ninto this house I will be happier when I\nfinally get a girlfriend or whatever it\nis and more than anything else this is\nwhat advertisements are based off of\nadvertisements exploit The Human\nCondition to get us to buy to first off\nto want their product and to buy it to\nmake us feel like we're not enough until\nwe get it there's a whole lot of\npsychology actually goes behind this\nthere's an incredible documentary it's\nreally long it's called the century of\nthe self it's about Edward Bernays who\nis actually a guy who was his uncle was\nSigmund Freud and he learned human\npsychology and up until that point\npeople only bought stuff because they\nneeded it he started turning all\nadvertisements into making people want\nsomething and so the craziest part about\nadvertisements is advertising companies\nhave\nincredible psychologists that work for\nthem that make you feel like you're not\nenough until you buy this thing and so\nwe have to understand that that buying\nsomething or having something is not\ngoing to make us happy happiness is an\ninside job you know I know somebody who\nis worth over four billion dollars and\nis incredibly unhappy he buys he has\nmore than any person I've ever seen\nand I'm talking about like not just\nthings like I'm talking about planes and\nexotic animals on ranches and you know\nthere's and he just he's incredibly\nunhappy and he thinks that buying and\nbuying and buying is making them feel\nbetter but it doesn't make them feel\nbetter at all\nhe's still miserable but I've also been\nto\nthird world countries and met people who\nwho live in Shacks that are built by\nscrap metal and held together by dirt\nthat they got wet and it dried and\nhelped you know mold their houses and\nhold their houses together\nsome of the poorest people I've ever met\nand they are some of the happiest people\nI've ever met as well so owning\nsomething or receiving something or\ngetting something never actually makes\nyou happy happy is an inside job buying\nsomething and owning something will\nnever make you happy in fact there are\nmany studies that show that once basic\nhuman needs are Met Food Water Shelter\nall of that stuff happiness does not\nyour happiness is not raised based off\nof how much money you make there was a\n2010 uh paper that was published it was\ncalled it was in the proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences and they\nfound that emotional well-being AKA\nday-to-day happiness Rises with income\nbut it plateaus at about 75 000 a year\nand after that happiness has nothing to\ndo with money buying things receiving\nthings any of that but what it shows us\nthough\nis that happiness is not dependent on\nthings happiness is not external it is\ninternal and trust me I've gone through\nthis entire journey I can tell you that\nmy level of Happiness when I was making\nseventy five thousand dollars a year at\n23 years old was exactly the same as it\nwas at 27 years old making 250 000 and I\nrealized that things could not make me\nhappy now I'm still stuck in this this\nwanting and all of the The Three L's as\nwell and I'm trying to slowly remove\nmyself I'm not perfect from it but I had\nthe realization that these are just\ndigits in a bank account they're just\ndigits on the screen is what they are so\nif you feel like buying something or\nowning something will make you happy\nthen you're going to be playing a losing\ngame but then you start thinking about\nbesides the longing for material items\nwhat about non-material items lots of\npeople feel like when they're single\nthat the answer to their problems is\nfinding someone to be in a relationship\nwith and they think oh well I'm not very\nhappy because I'm not in a relationship\nI have to find my soul mate and then\nI'll be happy when I find someone who\nloves me then I'll be happy\nhey if you're loving this episode on how\nto stop suffering please do me a favor\ngive us a like down below for the\nYouTube algorithm and if you have any\ntopics you want me to cover in the\nfuture go ahead and type them down in\nthe comments but your level of Happiness\nmight jump for a little while in the new\nrelationship phase but it will Plateau\nand you'll find yourself back in the\nlonging of feeling like you are needing\nsomething outside of you to make you\nhappy\nso why does this happen well when we put\nall of our hope into getting something\nwe forget to enjoy what's right in front\nof us which is the present moment we\nthink that there is another moment\noutside of this moment where we will be\nhappier if we receive something or if we\nhave that soulmate and what we do is we\njust forget that we could just be happy\nright now happiness is actually a\ndecision and it's an internal thing it's\nlike if we were to\nlook at a beautiful sunset and you're\nsitting there this incredibly beautiful\nsunset but you're sad because you wish\nit was a sunrise\nbut your happiness doesn't come from the\nsunset or Sunrise it comes from enjoying\nboth of them it comes from just learning\nto enjoy the moment so that's the first\none is longing the second one seems very\nsimilar but I'm going to tell you the\ndifferences which is lack lack is the\nfeeling of I don't have this thing and\nif I get this thing it'll make me happy\nnow it sounds the same but more so this\nthing will make me whole and longing is\ninstead of external things it's more of\nlike turning a mirror on yourself like I\nI if I if I was smarter I then I would\nfeel happy then I would be whole if I\nwas smarter then I would finally be good\nenough\nif I was taller well then I I would I\nwould finally behold I would finally be\nhappy if I was taller then I would be\nskinnier I wouldn't have so much fat on\nmy ass and then I would look better\nright so it's like looking at ourselves\nin the mirror and that could be\nphysically but it caused to be\ninternally oh if I didn't have ADD then\nI would be holding I wouldn't feel like\nI'm not a full person I would be happier\nif I didn't have this thing or\nwhatever it might be if I wasn't born\ninto such a crazy family then I'd\nfinally be whole but I was born into\nthis crazy family and they are this way\nand they make me sad so therefore I'll\nnever be happy\nyou know p and oh if I wasn't aging if I\ndidn't have these lines on my face like\npeople suffer when they get old and\nthey're trying to resist and they do\nsurgeries and they do these shots in\ntheir faces and they do all the things\nthey can do to possibly change\nthemselves thinking that those things\nare going to make them happy but it\nliterally changes nothing nothing about\nthemselves\nand so what happens we think okay the\nfirst one is longing for something which\nis outside of us the second one which is\nlacking something which is I lack this\nthing internally inside of myself and\ntherefore I am not whole I am not\ncomplete but if I were to be able to get\nthis thing if I were to be able to be\ntaller if I were to be able to be\nsmarter if I were to be able to be\nbetter looking if I were to be able to\nget rid of these wrinkles on my face\nthen then and only then could I finally\nbe happy\nand this can be tricky because sometimes\nwe don't even know what we think we're\nmissing and so we feel\nlike something isn't right with us oh\nman something's not right with me\nthere's something wrong\nand because of something not being wrong\nI feel incomplete I feel not good enough\nand so we sit there and we're like I\ndon't know why I don't feel whole I\ndon't know why I don't feel this way and\nso it does require more work on your\nside does require more self-discovery to\nuncover what it is and one of the things\nthat doesn't help with it I'm going to\nbe honest with you is social media\nbecause you can see the lives of people\nwhose they look perfect because they\nhave editing and they have Photoshop and\ntheir lives look perfect because they're\nonly posting them at their happiest\nmoments or in Mykonos sitting on a beach\nand you're like what the hell I'm\nsitting in in the middle of BFE Georgia\nand I don't I'm not sitting on Mykonos\nwith a with a drink in my hand the\nhell's wrong with my life and so you're\ncomparing yourself to\nmostly fake lives and fake looking\npeople because people edit themselves\nand then you're thinking there's\nsomething wrong with me and so because\nof that there's something wrong with me\nI'll never be complete and so therefore\nI suffer\nso we compare ourselves to Impossible\nstandards that do not reflect reality\nwhether that be somebody on social media\nwhether that be something in an\nadvertisement that you see and you see\nsomebody's body and you're like man I'd\nbe happier if I looked like her oh man\nI'd be happier if I had a six-pack like\nhim oh I'd be happier if I if I could\nyou know sit down and focus and not feel\nso anxious all the time\nand so many people look so perfect and\nthey look like they have perfect lives\nbut they're absolutely miserable and so\nthe thing I want you to understand is\nthat sure we can want to change\nourselves there's nothing wrong with\nthat the majority of this podcast\nepisodes I put up about how to change\nyourself to become a more evolved\nexpansive version of yourself wanting to\nchange yourself and evolve I don't like\nto use the word better because better\nimplies worse which means that you're\nworse now but more evolved version of\nyourself a wiser version of yourself a\nmore expansive version of yourself all\nof that is completely fine\nbut what if we can make ourselves feel\nbetter in this moment as we are working\non ourselves and that's really what it\ncomes down to and the second one with\nlacking\nand then the third one the third L is\nloss loss is a part of life we lose toys\nwe lose friends we lose loved ones\nsometimes we even lose parts of\nourselves along the way everyone knows\nthat losing something or someone that\nyou love or a dog or an animal that you\nhave or a best friend whether that be to\ndeath or whether that be to you know\nthey just decide to leave your life is\none of the hardest things in life but it\nis once again a part of life so we got\nto stop resisting the way that life\nactually is it hurts there's no way\naround that but we get stuck\nby wanting what we used to have maybe we\nget it back and maybe we don't I don't\nknow maybe that person who broke up with\nyou will want to get back into a\nrelationship with you maybe they do get\nback into a relationship with you in two\nyears\nbut regardless of whether that happens\nor not we're in charge of how we feel\nregardless of our circumstances\nif we lose a loved one\nall we want is them back\nI'd be happy if they didn't die oh they\ndied so young they were only 27 years\nold why that doesn't make any sense why\nwould God take somebody who's so amazing\nand we fight and we fight and we not\neven fight we resist and we resist and\nwe resist what we're constantly doing\nwith all three of these else we're\nresisting the way that the world\nactually is we're thinking that we are\nsmart enough that the world should be\ndifferent than it actually is oh the\nwhat whatever created this perfect\nuniverse that I'm in clearly doesn't\nknow what the hell they're doing because\nit should be this way and so the only\nconstant in life has changed all things\nare changing at all times all things\naround you will one day be gone every\nsingle person that you know will one day\nbe gone the closer you're wearing were\none to be gone the animals that you have\nin your house around your house the\nbirds the squirrels will all be gone the\ntrees that surround your house Lobby on\nthe buildings your house your cars\neverything the what you're sitting in\nright now everything will be gone one\nday that's just the way it's going to be\nthe more that we resist that actual fact\nof life the more that we're actually\nsuffering and so it could also be like I\nwas talking about a relationship right\nwe have this relationship we've lost the\nrelationship and we're suffering because\nwe want to be back together with them if\nyou've ever had like a really bad\nbreakup like a really bad heartbreak\nit's terrible right it sucks it's\nliterally one of the worst feelings in\nthe world and all you want is them back\nand you think that getting them back\nwill make you feel better and you\nbelieve that the only thing that will\nmake you happy make you whole is that\nperson but a lot of times the suffering\njust comes from not accepting not even a\nlot of times basically all of the\nsuffering of this comes from not\naccepting the current state of that\nrelationship\nmaybe you do get back together maybe you\ndon't\nbut you're still in charge of how you\nfeel regardless of the circumstances and\nthat's what's important and so when we\ntry to grab on to those things and hold\nthem tight\nthat's what causes the suffering is we\nwant things to go back to where they or\nwe want things to stay the same why\ncan't we just rewind six six months ago\nand the only thing we can try to do try\nis the key word is try to remain happy\nand present as things start to change\nand creating happiness in your life and\nthe feeling of just being\nah like that's there's not even a word\nit's just the feeling of\nby just relaxed peaceful joyful\njust sitting there you know not being\nhappy not not being sad not being pissed\noff none of those things\njust that feeling requires us more\nunderstanding of what's going on in our\nlife why we're feeling these things it\nrequires the first step of knowing about\nthese three types of suffering so that\nwe can understand them a little bit more\nbecause by understanding them we can\nwork to create a happier life and it all\ncomes down to one thing and one thing\nonly everybody and I mentioned it really\nquickly but what it comes down to is\nacceptance if you are longing for\nsomething except that you don't have it\nif you're lacking something except who\nyou actually are if you've lost\nsomething except that this is the\nreality that it now is you have to\naccept it and the suffering comes from\nnot accepting reality as it is\nmy one of my uh my first coach that I\nhired when I was 19 years old used to\nalways say and I've said it hundreds of\ntimes in this podcast but it needs to be\nset again and again until it's burned\ninto our minds is your Stress and\nAnxiety will in your life will be in\ndirect proportion to how much you're\nresisting the way that the world is your\nstress and your anxiety will be in\ndirect proportion to how much you're\nresisting the way that the world is if\nyou're resisting that breakup if you're\nresisting that you're not the way that\nyou you know you don't have the body\nthat you want if you're resisting that\nyou're you come from a certain family if\nyou're resisting that you don't have\nthis car and that card make you happen\nyou're resisting resisting resisting\nthat is going to cause suffering\nthe resisting\nis not accepting the way that the world\nis if we're longing for something if\nwe're lacking something in ourselves or\nif we feel like we've lost something and\nwe want it back we're simply just not\naccepting\nhow the world currently is the current\nstate of Our Lives\nit doesn't mean that we don't work to\ncreate a different life it doesn't mean\nthat we don't try to improve and try to\nexpand and try to evolve ourselves it\nmeans that we just need to Simply accept\nlife as it is and continue to work to\nchange our lives because if I'm on this\npath of self-discovery and self-mastery\nand trying to become better and trying\nto become a bit you know trying to build\na business and be a great parent to be a\ngreat spouse and all of this stuff\nI can still enjoy myself and enjoy my\nlife while I'm on this path there's no\nreason why you can't feel happy and\nfulfilled while trying to create the new\nversion of yourself in the new version\nof your life and that's what it comes\ndown to life's a journey\nthere's ups there's Downs you can't\ncling to either one of them sometimes we\nwant something that we don't something\nthat we don't have sometimes we want to\nbe different\nsometimes we we long for something and\nwe want something that we don't have\nanymore that we've lost along the way\nand sometimes we feel like we're not\nenough but if we can understand that the\nreason why we are not happy and the\nreason why we're we're anxious and we're\nstressed is not because of Any external\ncircumstances because of our internal\nState then we can start to move we can\nstart to shift and if we can remember\nthe Three L's longing lack and loss and\nwe can categorize our desires we can\nstart to actually just take a step back\nand accept life as it is so that's what\nI got for you for
