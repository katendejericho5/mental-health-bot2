    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout four different steps to destroy\nyour stress and anxiety and really I'm\ngoing to give you some extra tips to\nmake this a an entire guide for Stress\nManagement so if you're someone who's\nbeen stressed recently or you've ever\nbeen stressed in your entire life or you\nfeel yourself starting to get anxious\nabout things coming up in the future\nthis is a guide to help you whenever you\nfind yourself in that situation first\noff I want to be real with you okay\nlet's be real we live in a really\nstressful world and things continue to\nget more and more stressful and in the\npast 100 years\nthe world has changed a lot for humans\nlike our brains and our bodies have not\nadapted to this new world\nover the past 10 years though it's\nbecome a completely different Universe\nfor us if you think about it I was\ntalking with my wife about this this\npast weekend I was done with Lauren and\nsocial media and smartphones have really\njust taken off in the past 10 years or\nso like when they got really really\npopular sure\nyou know there's been smartphones for\nsince 2006-ish but really it's been\nabout 10 years where people have started\nto become addicted to their phones\nprobably even about five or six years\npeople are really starting to get\naddicted to their phones I don't think\npeople\nForce I don't think people the average\nperson that's not listening this podcast\nhas any idea what it's about to be in\nanother 10 years and if you're listening\nto podcasts it's because you want to be\nbetter and our brains are not meant to\ndeal with all of the constant stimuli\nthat we have every single day you know\nfrom your phone to your TV to your email\nto your notifications to other people to\nFacebook Instagram Tick Tock Twitter\nblah blah blah blah blah we're just not\nreally capable of handling all of that\nand what happens is we get stressed out\nand we get anxious because there's just\ntoo much coming in and if we're not\ncareful we're going to get too wrapped\nup in it and it's only going to become\nharder as things start moving faster and\nfaster in this world and so really\nwhat's important for us is something\nI've taken a priority on in my life is\nStress Management because if you don't\nwork on stress management now\nyou need to\nespecially in the face of constant\nchallenges in everything that comes with\nliving in the modern world that we live\nin then it comes down to us being able\nto identify our triggers because what\ntriggers me to be stressed or anxious\ndoesn't necessarily trigger you to be\nstressed or anxious so how well do you\nknow yourself and what triggers you and\nwhat makes you anxious and then once we\ndo once we actually figure out what they\nare is we Implement a effective Stress\nManagement technique to help us manage\nour emotions make better decisions take\nbetter action make us more resilient and\nthen just able to really\nCOPE in this world that we live in so we\nhave to start being proactive and with\nhow fast the world is changing it's only\ngoing to get harder so that means we\nmust get better the world's not going to\nchange and make it easier for you so\ntoday we're going to be talking about in\nthis episode I'm going to teach you how\nto gain conscious awareness of your\nthought process what triggers you all of\nthat I'm going to teach you how to\ndevelop proactive Stress Management\nstrategies the benefits of journaling\nStress Management and all of that let me\nteach you a tool to do that and I'm\ngoing to give you a actual Stress\nManagement technique that the Mayo\nClinic created to help you with your\nstress so let's go over that one first\nthe Mayo Clinic created something that\nwas called The Four A's of Stress\nManagement and they really created just\nlike a practical guide to your stress\nmanagement and it's just Four A's okay\nand it goes through number one if you\nyou try to get number one done if you\ncan't you go number two if King number\ntwo you go to three if you can't get\nthree done you go to four and so when\nyou find and you identify a trigger you\nstart at one if one doesn't work you go\nto two if two doesn't work you go to\nthree if three doesn't work you go to\nfour okay so number one is to avoid\navoid as many stressful situations in\nyour life as you can can you try to\nproactively create a life where you\navoid as much stress as possible like\nfor me I'm gonna be honest with you I\nhate grocery stores I don't know why\nlike maybe I was maybe I was like beaten\nin a grocery store in another life I\ndon't know what it what it was but I\njust like hate grocery stores they're\njust not I'm not a fan of them right and\nso for me I just try not to walk into\nany grocery stores I order all of my\nfood online we had you know this morning\nWhole Foods was at our house when I woke\nup this morning sitting outside so you\ncan do Whole Foods you can do instacart\nis it more expensive yes but is it worth\nit for me saving number one my time\nwhich is precious for me and for me also\nkeeping Peace of Mind Absolutely I'll\npay more for that\nnow avoiding doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you're running away so if you're\navoiding like a grocery store like me or\nyou're avoiding a specific person it\ndoesn't always mean that you're running\naway what you're doing and what you\nshould start getting better at is\nprioritizing your mental health\nrealizing that your mental health is a\nvery very important thing that you\nshould be prioritizing over almost\nanything because the better mental\nhealth that you are in the better that\neverything in your life is going to be\nevery relationship is going to be and\nevery person is going to be so you're\njust learning to say no to unnecessary\nor possibly harmful stressors so if you\nhave certain people that are stressful\nget them out of your life if you can\nspend less time with them if you can\navoid them as much as possible and avoid\nas many stressful situations in your\nlife as you possibly can now if number\none is not going to work and you're like\nI can't just avoid my boss well then\nmaybe we go to number two and number two\nis to alter the situation if you can't\navoid the stress try to alter the\nsituation impossible so for me\nhave I never walked into a grocery store\nsince\nyou know Whole Foods and instacart\nstarted delivering stuff to my house no\nthere's always something I forgot I\nalmost always forget something I need or\nwe need to go pick up some ingredient so\nI alter the situation I do not go to\nthis grocery store when they're busy it\njust doesn't happen because that just\nmakes me more stressed out because then\nthere's people not paying attention they\nrun into me with their carts and then\ntheir kids are sneezing all over my food\nyou know whatever it is that might\nhappen right so if I have to go to the\ngrocery store and I can't avoid it well\nthen I alter the situation I always go\nto the grocery store when I need to if\nit's possible the last hour that they're\nopen because there's almost no one ever\nthere I'm in and I'm out I get what I\nneed I'm done right so that's a good\nexample of altering a situation now what\nif there's other people you can't always\nchange someone else but you can ask them\nto change their behavior in the way they\nact to you can't you you can actually\ncommunicate that and by communicating\nyour needs and your feelings more\ndirectly they might change now I get it\nsome of you are like my mom is never\nchanging okay cool well they might not\neither they can alter or you can alter\nwith them\nthat's something that you need to figure\nout and so you go through step number\ntwo which is Alter what if you just\ncan't alter well that's when you go to\nstep number three which is to accept at\ntimes neither avoidance nor alteration\nis really possible and so in these\ncircumstances what you have to just get\nbetter at doing is just accepting\nacceptance doesn't mean that you're\ndenying yourself but really if I'm being\nhonest a lot of people's stressors come\nfrom resisting and not accepting and I\nremember my very first Mentor my one of\nmy first mentors he was used to always\nsay that your stress and anxiety and\nyour life will be in direct proportion\nto how much you're resisting the way\nthat the world is\nso think about that for a second your\nStress and Anxiety if it's higher the\nreason why is because you're resisting\nthe way that the world is you're\nresisting the way that somebody is\nyou're resisting the way that your boss\nis your mom is your and uncle whatever\nit might be\nso your resistance I'm sorry your\nyour stress and your anxiety will be in\ndirect proportion to how much you'll\nresist in the way that the world is\nacceptance doesn't mean pretending that\nyou don't feel how you feel though this\nis important it doesn't mean that you\ndon't you just pretend that you don't\nfeel the way that you feel it's an\nacknowledgment that it's okay to feel\nthat way if someone stresses you out\nit's okay to feel that way if someone\npisses you off it's okay to feel that\nway\nif someone screwed you over you can hold\nresentment for them forever if you\nreally want to\nor you can just decide to accept what\nthey did they did\nand you can move on and many people are\nstressed out today over something that\nhappened like three years ago\nit happened three years ago it's over\njust accept it move on it's like the\nquote the mountains that you're carrying\nyou were only meant to climb\nlike there's a really good parable of\ntwo monks right and monks are not\nsupposed to touch other people they're\nnot you know they're supposed to be in\ntheir own little world these two monks\nare walking through a forest and they\nthey come to a a river and there's a\nwoman who's trying to cross over the\nriver and she can't cross over the river\nand so these monks are stronger so one\nof the monks goes you know what ma'am\nI'll take you across so he he picks her\nup walks her to the other side of the\nriver\ndrops her off the other side of the\nriver says have a nice day comes back to\nthe other side of the river and starts\ngoing on his walk again with the other\nmonk then he's walking with the other\nMonk and they're just sitting there in\nsilence and about two hours later the\nother monk who didn't take the woman\nacross the river turns the other Monk\nand he said man I can't believe you took\nthat other woman to the other side of\nthe river I can't believe you're you\nknow as part of what we do you're not\nsupposed to touch someone else you're\nnot supposed to touch anybody else\nyou're just supposed to be in your own\nworld you just broke a rule of being a\nmonk and the monk who walked the woman\nacross the river turns the monk who is\nthinking about this woman who he picked\nup and took across the river he turns\nthem and he says wow\nyou're still thinking about that I\ndropped that woman off two hours ago\nyou've been carrying her the whole time\nand that's really how A lot of people\nare is we the the event happened it's\nover stop carrying it with you in in\nsome circumstances forgiveness for other\npeople is really what you need to do and\nI don't say that you forgive somebody\nfor their sake it has nothing to do with\nthe other person you forgive someone for\nyour sake because when you forgive\nyou're releasing the stress and the\nenergy of resisting and blaming the\nother person and you're forgiving that\nsituation so that you can get on with\nyour life and stop caring these things\nwith you that you don't need to care\nanymore it could also be\nfor some of you guys a lot of you guys\nforgiving yourself you know let's say\nyou you messed up in a relationship you\ndid something you weren't supposed to or\nyou said something you weren't supposed\nto I don't know what it was\nin it and ended in turmoil and they\nbroke up with you and that was six\nmonths ago and you're still waking up\nand thinking about what you did and\nyou're saying oh I'm so stupid I can't\nbelieve that I this up it's I'm\nnot worthy of anyone's love I messed up\nI'm such an idiot maybe I'll be single\nforever\nyou could do that if you want or you\ncould say listen\nthat thing that happened six months ago\nI messed up\nI learned I forgive myself I will never\ndo it again\nsee the difference between the two of\nthem it allows you to drop the thing and\ngo on with your life do better next time\nlearn from it and just be better and so\nthat right there is the next one is to\nyou know accept what happened now if\naccepting is still not working as well\nas you want to we need to learn and this\nis the the main thing that we all need\nto do is number four is to adapt we need\nto learn to do our best in the face of\nstress and adapt to it there's no such\nthing as a world without stressors\nlong-term Stress Management really means\nyou adapting to unavoidable stressors it\nmeans you altering your perspective of\nthe view that you have on the stressors\non the challenges and everything that\nhappened in building resilience and you\ncan look at it and you can see something\nyou could ask yourself is this a crisis\nor is this a challenge\nand if you ask yourself that question a\nlot of times you're like this isn't\nreally a crisis you know if you won't\nremember something in five years don't\nspend more than five minutes thinking\nabout it\nlike is this a crisis no it's a\nchallenge okay well let me adapt let me\nget better let me get better\ndon't ask the world to cater to you just\nbe decide that you're gonna be better if\nyou are wanting the World to Change for\nYou\nyou're going to have a really hard run\nin life that's for sure\nso those are four steps let me give you\nanother tip that's really going to help\nyou out your Stress Management okay it's\ncalled a Stress Management Journal so by\ncreating a Stress Management Journal you\ncan get uh you can get it really creates\na really high effective strategy for\nyour Stress Management it is not the\nmost comfortable thing that you could do\nI promise you that but it helps you\nbecause you can start to identify your\ntriggers you can understand your\nemotional responses and then eventually\nonce you start to understand your\nemotional responses and your triggers\nyou can event eventually develop coping\nmechanisms whenever you're in those\nsituations so the idea of the journal is\nfor you to learn yourself\nto actually learn Who You Are\nYou Think You Know Who You Are\nI promise you there's a lot happening on\nthe server so you have no ideas\nhappening so you ask yourself you sit\ndown the pen and paper man I'm really\nfreaking stressed right now I don't know\nwhy I'm stressed I'm really anxious\nright now I don't know why I'm anxious\nsit down and ask yourself write it down\npen and paper\nwhat's triggering me right now like what\nis it that why do I feel so triggered\nokay write down how do I feel right now\nwhy do I feel this way what can I do\nabout it and you ask yourself what's\ntriggering me how do I feel why do I\nfeel this way and what can I do about it\nand what happens is you're going to\nstart to learn yourself way more than\nyou ever have you'll start to see\ntriggers way before they come up and\nyou'll be able to navigate better and\neither go around the triggers or you're\ngoing to be able to navigate better when\nyou go through all of those triggers\nbecause you'll start to see them coming\nand you'll develop coping mechanisms for\nwhen you do get stressed\nand the the main thing that I want you\nto remember from this episode is when\nyou're triggered about something\ntry to get curious like when you're\ntriggered get curious huh why do I feel\nthis way what's going on what's going on\nin my body what am I thinking is this\ntrue am I thinking something's going to\nbe catastrophic when it's really not and\nyou actually start to get really curious\non yourself as you do this though very\nimportant part because I know how a lot\nof people are\nthere should be no judgment there should\nbe no guilt there should be no shaming\ninstead take a really compassionate and\ncurious approach as if you're just a\ntherapist trying to help your client go\nthrough this thing it just happens to be\nthat you are the therapist and you're\nalso the client so that can really help\nyou another thing that can really help\nwith the journaling as well is to just\ndump all of your emotions onto a just\nall of it onto a piece of paper just\njournaling can be a really great\nemotional release and when it's in your\nhead it's really hard to figure out\nbut when it's on paper it can be planned\nand it can be worked through and so just\nthrow everything at that piece of paper\nand as I always say everything in this\nworld is figure outable I had to Google\nit figure outable is not a word I made\nit up but everything in this world is\nfigureoutable can you just start to\nfigure this out and then really what it\ncomes down to is starting to be more\nmindful of yourself of your body of your\nprocessing that's going on in your head\nall of the things when you start to\nstart like really sit down and figure\nyourself out it helps you develop a\nsense of mindfulness the idea is pretty\nsimple when we overthink when we stress\ntoo much when we room in about things we\nare not in this moment like you're out\nyou're you're somewhere else your brain\ncan go into the past it can go into the\nfuture it can go on the president can go\nall over the place but there is one\nthing that is always in this present\nmoment and that is your body your body\nis always in the present moment and so\nwhen you find yourself being too\nstressed out too much overthinking\neverything you got to bring yourself\nback to your body and you've got to\nbring yourself to your five senses and\nyou've got to give yourself just try\nthis out okay give yourself 30 seconds\nfor each one of these this is two and a\nhalf minutes it will change everything\nfor you give yourself 30 seconds and\nthen look around and say what do I see\nlook at everything that's around you and\nwhat I want you to do is you look at\nsomething and try to see the texture of\nit like if you're driving your car\nyou're like what do I see I see my\nsteering wheel instead of just seeing\nthe steering wheel can you look closer\nat it can you see the texture of the\nsteering wheel can you see everything\nthat's around there can you see the\ntexture of your dashboard right you look\nat the maybe you're at a stoplight and\nyou're looking at the ground right now\nand you're looking at the texture of the\nground what do you see and you give\nyourself 30 seconds to just see because\nseeing is in the present moment then you\ngive yourself 30 seconds say what do I\nhear\nwhat do I hear and you start to listen\nto all the things that are around you\nthat you can hear\nand then after those 30 seconds you say\nwhat do I smell\nlet me just smell around what do I smell\nand then you say after those 30 seconds\nwhat do I feel I feel my t-shirt I feel\nmy shorts that I'm wearing I can feel my\nfeet on the ground what do you feel and\nthe next one is what do you taste what\ndo you taste you taste the saliva in\nyour mouth do you taste the the coffee\nthat you just had 20 minutes ago and\nwhat you're doing is you're bringing\nyourself back to this present moment\nbecause your brain is almost never here\nit's always almost always somewhere else\nwe bring ourselves back to the present\nmoment by checking in with the five\nsenses to put it another way is your\nbrain can carry you all over the place\nyour body your five senses are only in\none place that's the present moment so\nwe want to bring ourselves back to the\npresent moment because when we're\nstressed and anxious\nwe're usually in the future\nwe're in the future we're thinking about\nall these things or in the past and\nwe're thinking about all the stuff that\nwe did wrong instead bring yourself to\nthe present moment\nand so you sit there and you start to\nfigure out what is it that you see hear\ntaste feel smell all of that and then\nwhat happens is you start to actually\ndevelop more awareness around yourself\nand you start to realize that you're not\nan anxious person so like people say I'm\nan anxious person you're not an anxious\nperson I'm gonna give you a little tiny\nreframe to help you whenever you think\nthat you're an anxious person instead of\nsaying I'm an anxious person just say\nI'm experiencing anxiety right now or\nI'm starting to feel anxious that\nseparates you\nfrom the actual feeling in the emotions\nso that you can manage the stress okay\nif you say I'm an anxious person that\ngives you no way to ever get out of your\nanxiety if you say I'm a stress I'm\nalways stressed out that's just who I am\nthat is those are both identity\nstatements that's not who you are and if\nyou think it's who you are you'll never\nbe able to get out of it but if you say\nI'm experiencing stress right now I'm\nexperiencing a lot of stress okay it's\nlike a passing Cloud clouds will never\nbe here forever they'll eventually pass\nby that stress will pass by the anxiety\nwill pass by and you don't identify with\nthe stress and call yourself stressed\nout or you're a stressful person or\nyou're always stressed instead of saying\nI'm an anxious person I'm experiencing\nanxiety right now really what I'm trying\nto get you to do is I'm trying to get\nyou to understand that feelings and\nemotions and triggers all they're all\ngoing to come up\nbut what you need to realize is you need\nto disassociate yourself from those\nthings because when you disassociate\nyourself from those things you can start\nto figure them out so that oh I'm\nexperiencing stress right now what can I\ndo you know what I can do I could take\n60 breaths you know what I can do I can\nwrite all the things that are stressing\nme out on a piece of paper I start to\nplan out what I should do to make myself\nfeel better and you start to learn\nyourself more you think you know\nyourself we all think we know ourselves\nbut the older I get the more I realize\nthat I don't know myself even though I'm\nworking on myself to know myself even\nmore than I ever have in my life you\nstart to learn yourself you start to\nlearn your triggers you start to learn\nwhat stresses you out what makes you\nanxious and you can make a plan to\neither avoid those things you can adapt\nto those things you can change them\naround you can do whatever it is that\nyou need to by using the Four A's and\nstart being more present a moment where\nyou can actually start to work through\nthose things in real time so that's what\nI got for you on your Stress Management\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode if you\nhave a friend that you think would need\nthis go ahead and text it to them send\nit over to them right now say listen\nthis I think this
