    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so you never miss\nanother podcast episode and if you love\nthis podcast and you love the stuff that\nI teach you're absolutely 100 gonna love\nmy new and first book which is called\nlevel up how to get focused stop\nprocrastinating and upgrade your life if\nyou want to pre-order it you can\nactually go ahead and go to robdial.com\nbook reason why you want to pre-order is\nbecause with every pre-order I'm giving\na free course which is called the get\noff your ass masterclass teaching you\nhow to stop procrastinating and take\naction and you'll be entered into a\ndrawing for a pool of over twenty five\nthousand dollars cash and prizes once\nagain if you want to enter yourself into\nall of that and to get the book all you\nhave to do is go to robdial.com book\ntoday I'm going to give you a secret to\nMastery and I'm gonna give you a secret\nto success and it's often believed when\nI talk with a lot of people one of the\nreasons why they're so hesitant towards\nworking towards the life that they want\ntowards the success they want the the\nhappiness they want the money that they\nwant the business that they want all\nthat stuff is because they think that\nthere's really big strides that have to\nbe taken like almost insurmountable\nstrides and most people think that the\npath to Mastery or success involves\nreally extreme effort extreme amounts of\nbeing out of balance countless hours of\nworking Blood Sweat tears never seeing\nyour family all of that and while there\nis a little bit of Truth like a tiny bit\nof Truth in some of there there's also a\nslow small steady steps to Mastery into\nsuccess as well\nand I'm going to teach you something\nthat I like to call a 30 by 30 strategy\nokay the 30 by 30 strategy is one of the\nsimplest things that I think I've ever\nworked through and the principle really\ninvolves committing just 30 minutes a\nday to a desired skill or a desired\nhabit for 30 consecutive days so why is\nit 30 by 30 it's 30 minutes for 30 days\nthat's it it's not much\nlike anybody listening to this podcast\nepisode right now can find 30 extra\nminutes in their day whether that means\nthat you have to wake up 30 minutes\nearlier go to bed 30 minutes later or if\nI'm being honest with you just get a\nlittle bit better with your time\nmanagement so that you have 30 extra\nminutes in your day because I guarantee\nevery single person has 30 minutes in\ntheir day somewhere if they just become\nbetter at it and so you know with the\ntime is becoming a little bit better you\nfind a few extra minutes and over 30\ndays in 30 minutes that's 900 minutes\nthat you're working on a skill set\nor you're working on a habit and so\nthat's 15 hours\n15 hours of practice and so let's begin\nwith talking about why consistency in\ndoing this is really critical in\nImprovement in progress because all too\noften we think like I said that success\nand Mastery has to be this big like\nwhenever you see like success in\npictures and drawings it's always like a\nguy that's moving a boulder up a hill\nand it's like you don't have to struggle\nyour way to success you don't have to\nstruggle your way to Mastery how could\nmake all of this easier on ourselves and\naccording to the British Journal of\ngeneral practice habit formation\ntypically occurs when an action is\nperformed regularly and on a consistent\nbasis in a consistent context and so it\ndoesn't have to be like once a week we\ndo this really big thing and that's\ntakes a lot of effort and it's so hard\nit's like no it's just about day in day\nout day in day out and these little\nteeny tiny steps compound into massive\nresults over years\nit's like me when I first started\ngetting into math you know wanting to\nmaster myself and learn about mindset\nand all this I was 19 years old back in\n2006 and I just started reading I\nstarted reading more and I started to\ntry to put in practice and I would do a\nlittle bit of reading here a little bit\nof reading here I would try to teach\nwhat I was learning and work on myself\nand now that I've been doing it for 17\nyears it's like the stuff that that is\nlike common knowledge to me now I would\nhave never thought was even possible\nwhen it was 17 years ago and so it's\nreally about like these little steps\nit's like the the phrase a journey of a\nThousand Miles begins with a single step\nit's just like every day is just one\nlittle step it's not some massive\nstrategy need to be taken it's this\nconsistent repetition that leads to\nautomated response patterns in habit\nforming and skills in your brain\nand the more that you do the something\nthe more it gets hardwired into your\nbrain so if you've ever heard the phrase\nneurons that fire together wire together\nwhat the hell does that mean when they\nsay fire together your brain sends an\nelectronic signal from one neuron to\nanother one and what happens is they\nstart to wire together so the more your\nneurons in your brain actually start to\nfire together if you do it day in day\nout it actually gets stronger that\nwiring gets stronger day in day out\nbecause of you actually putting the time\nin in these 30 minutes that you put in\nevery single day prime your brain to new\nhabit formation and skill sets now\nlet me take a step back because I\nalready know this always happens anytime\nI teach people or any of that stuff if\nyou're listening to this a good amount\nof you guys are overachievers and you\nalways want to do more so you're\nthinking okay well this is cool well I\ncould do 30 minutes I wanted three new\nhabits I want to do 30 minutes of this\nthing in 30 minutes of this thing in 30\nminutes so this thing it's gonna be an\nhour and a half every single day stop\nstop trying to do that or you know what\nI'm gonna do I'm gonna do an hour every\nday instead of 30 minutes so stop the\nmore that you try to lift the less like\nyou are to do it right the more that you\nput the more changes the more things you\nwant to shift up in your life the more\nthat your brain is actually going to\nresist it and so when you look at 30\nminutes it's just a small little\nincrement and everybody can find a way\nto make it work right while an hour a\nday might seem more beneficial to you\noverachievers out there doubling the\ntime doesn't necessarily mean that\nyou're gonna actually double the results\nbecause the law of the law of\ndiminishing returns applies here as well\nthe efficiency of learning decreases as\nthe length of a single practice session\nincreases\nlet me say that again with the law of\ndiminishing returns the efficiency of\nlearning decreases as the length of a\nsingle practice session increases so\nwith a 30 minute time slot you're more\nlikely to stay focused in that 30\nminutes because you know you only got 30\nminutes you're more likely to absorb\ninformation effectively in making that\npractice more potent so 30 minutes is a\nperfect time slot right and so when you\nlook at uh and to really start to\nappreciate why the 30 minutes for 30\ndays why that strategy actually works\nit's important to understand the science\nof something called skill acquisition\nwith the signs of skill acquisition is\nwhen you learn something new you create\nnew neural Pathways in the brain these\nPathways strengthen with the repetition\nenhancing your skills to whatever that\nthing is\nbut what you want to do\nis use something called deliberate\npractice and so\nthere's a difference between practicing\nand deliberate practice so like I've\nbeen playing guitar since I was 15 so 22\nyears at this point I can pick up a\nguitar and I could play songs you know\nwithout having to think about it for\nsome of the ones I've played over and\nover and over and over and over again\nbut if I just play the same song\nfor 30 minutes every single day for 30\ndays I'm not going to really get better\nwhat I want to do is I want to focus on\ndeliberate practice what is deliberate\npractice Harvard Business Review says\nthat deliberate practice involves\nfocused consistent effort aimed at\nimproving performance in a specific task\nand so it's a task or a a habit or a\nskill set that is a little bit out of\nyour comfort zone and what I've heard\nAndrew huberman says with with this type\nof stuff is you want to be at like\n85 percent success rate 15 failure rate\nand so it's like maybe you're if we just\nkeep using guitar as an example right\nmaybe you're wanting to learn uh a new\nsolo\nyou don't want to play a solely you've\nbeen playing forever you want to play\none that's about 15 out of your comfort\nzone so you can get most of it but then\nthere's parts of it that are like\nthis is really I'm really struggling on\nthis one part I need to do it over and\nover and over and over and over again\nand so it's just about 15 out of your\ncomfort zone and with a 30 by 30\nstrategy it fits into this mold\nperfectly another reason why 30 by 30\nworks so well is because it has\nsomething called the spacing effect and\nso the spacing effect is this this\npsychological principle that suggests\nthat learning is more effective when it\nis spread out over time hey if you love\nthis episode do me a real quick favor\ngive me a like down below and then\ncomment down below any topics that you\nwant me to cover in the future\nso instead of taking like 3.5 hours of\ntrying to learn something like if you're\nstudying for school right instead of\ntrying to take a three and a half hour\nblock of just trying to learn it would\nactually be better for you if you did 30\nminutes a day for seven days and so with\nthat principle of the spacing effect you\nactually learn better when you're and\nit's more effective when you're learning\nis spread out over time into smaller\nincrements and this further strengthens\nthe case for why daily practice is\nreally good for all of this practice is\nwhere your brain fires together sleep is\nwhere your brain wires together and so\nwhen you actually do this and then you\ngive yourself you know time to distance\nyourself you're working on the scale\nwhatever it is this new solo and then\nyou give yourself time and you come back\ntomorrow you got sleep in between there\nand when you sleep your brain replays\nwhat you went over for the day 60 times\nfaster and 60 times more than you did so\nyour that solo is actually being\npracticed in your brain 60 times if you\nonly did it one time and so you know\nwhen you get sleep once again practice\nis where your brain the neurons are\nactually going to fire together the\nsleep and the rest is where your brain\nactually wires together\nso it's awesome because by dedicating 30\nminutes a day you give your brain time\nto consolidate all of that information\nallowing the new neural Pathways to\nactually solidify\npretty awesome is it and it really comes\ndown to the concept of like micro\nprogress each 30-minute session serves\nas a small step towards a broader goal\nthat you have and while each step might\nnot seem really significant individually\nthey're going to compound the compound\nin Impact is substantial and so when you\nlook at it there's going to be days\nwhere you\ndo 30 minutes of practice and you don't\nfeel like you got much better but you\ndid and you might feel like you made a\nwhole lot of mistakes but I've heard\nmany neuropsychologists and\nneurobiologists talk about this is\nmaking mistakes is actually the most\nimportant thing your brain can do\nbecause it actually pays more attention\nyour brain gets more focused after\nmistakes and so when you have really bad\ndays of practice or bad days of lifting\nor if you're trying to learn a new\nlanguage and you don't feel like it's\ngetting in there it's getting in there\nand so each each day is just a small\nstep in the direction that you're trying\nto go to and so\nhow does all of this stuff work how does\nthat work well getting into the the 30\nby 30 approach isn't really complex it's\nreally simple so let's talk about how\nyou want to do it right so you're like\nokay this sounds great you've sold me on\nthis is this is a thing that I should do\nwell how the hell do I do it well now\nlet's talk about it right the first\nthing is you want to select one\neverybody one specific skill or habit\nthat you want to improve or cultivate in\nyour life not 12 not two not five one\nand what I want you to do is be really\nexplicit about what your goal is so that\nyou can measure your progress so if\nyou're saying I want to improve this\nthing don't just say I want to improve\nthis thing but actually say what is your\nspecific goal so maybe it's like if\nyou're once again we go back to guitar\nmaybe it's like I want to be able to\nplay you know this song I want to be\nable to play Children of Bodom you know\nsix pounder solo right that's a really\nfast solo that you're gonna have to play\nand he's probably gonna put you out of\nyour comfort zone but then you're gonna\nhave to say okay what do I need to do in\nthat well it's much faster than I am and\nI'm not really sure with the progression\nof what I need to do so I need to get\nreally good at measuring my speed okay\nwell how the hell do I do that well\nmaybe I should actually get a metronome\nand maybe with that metronome I can\nactually start to challenge myself to\nget faster right and so instead of just\nsaying I want to learn the solo it's\nlike how can you actually get really\nclear about the goals that you have so\nthat you can measure your progress you\nknow because if you go from only be able\nto do 90 beats per minute up to 120\nbeats per minute even if you don't know\nthe song at the end of those 30 days and\nyou can't play that solo but you go from\n90 beats per minute and how fast you're\ngoing to 120 beats per minute and you're\nyou're you know your finger speed and\nall that I would say that's pretty good\nyou're you're getting better and so\nyou've got to be really explicit about\nwhat your goal those are and what you're\ntrying to do\nand I just decided to make a list of\njust a bunch of different ideas that you\ncould try to improve at if you're like I\nwant to do this but I don't know what I\nshould try to improve it here's a couple\nideas all right take 30 minutes and try\nto learn a new language every single day\ntake one language if you're like you\nknow what I know a little bit of Spanish\nfrom the two or three years that I took\nin high school but I don't really know\nhow to speak it what if you just did 30\nminutes a day for the next 30 days 900\nminutes 15 hours total right that's\ngoing to help you out what about\nimproving your physical fitness\ncould use improving your physical\nfitness you could do writing and\nactually commit to writing for half an\nhour every single day that would be 15\nhours of writing I mean think about how\nyou'd be halfway through your book that\nyou're trying to write it could be\nplaying a musical instrument and trying\nto get better at a musical instrument or\njust starting to learn a musical\ninstrument it could be computer\nprogramming it could be cooking it could\nbe reading so that you can get better at\ngetting knowledge into your brain it\ncould be 30 minutes of meditation or\nmindfulness it could be learning to draw\nit could be public speaking it could be\nphotography it could be painting it\ncould be dancing it could be gardening\nit could be improving your memory it\ncould be enhancing your financial\nliteracy it could be learning stocks it\ncould be learning Bitcoin there's so\nmany different things that as a human\nyou can get better at\nand so what I would recommend is figure\nout the one thing that's like really\nwhat I would say is follow your energy\nwhere do you feel the most energy like\nbeing pulled towards this thing I kind\nof got this thing I want to learn like I\nwant to learn about cryptocurrency okay\nI feel like that might be something I\nwant to learn okay spend 30 minutes a\nday find the best websites the best\narticles start to read start to learn\nabout blockchain start to learn about\nall of these different things and by at\nthe end of the month you're way further\nahead and when I say way further ahead I\nmean like further ahead than 99.99 of\npeople on the Earth right you're already\non the path towards being an expert at\nit if you just keep on going and so\nthat's the first thing is figure out\nexactly what it is that you want to get\nbetter at and what your goals are around\nthat thing\nnext thing is to look at your schedule\nand put in your schedule right now the\nnext week so if today is Sunday for you\nand you're listening to this go ahead\nand put 30 minute blocks in your\nschedule Monday Tuesday Wednesday\nThursday Friday Saturday Sunday don't\ntry to find the time the day of or in\nthe moment and be like well I got to get\n15 minutes here in 50 minutes here no\nlike find a 30 minute time slot put in\nyour schedule and then just\nhave boundaries around that do not let\nanything distract you right you got to\nmake sure that this period is free from\ndistraction and interruptions so you\nknow make sure if you got kids make sure\nthey're at school or make sure that\nthey're at a friend's house whatever it\nmight be and consider it like an\nappointment with your future self that\nyou cannot afford to miss next thing you\nwant to make sure that you do is keep a\nrecord of the daily session so what I\nwould recommend is taking five minutes\nlike you don't have to do this but if\nyou really want to get better this will\nmake you exponentially better and take\nyou two to three to five minutes right\nkeep a daily record of your sessions and\nso you're going to actually track your\nprogress because the tracking of the\nprogress increases your motivation it\nreinforces a habit and it helps you\nrefine your approach based on what's\nworking and what's not working and so if\nyou sit down and let's say learning that\nguitar solo is what you're working on\nand you sit down for two minutes after\nand you say man like I was really\nstruggling here\nand you write it down you think to\nyourself well I did pretty well on this\nhow can I make sure that I get better at\nthis part how can I make sure that I do\nthis what do I need to make sure they do\ntomorrow so therefore you're not just\nlike Tokyo drifting into tomorrow's\nsession but you're actually being very\nintentional by recording all of your\ndaily sessions and when I say record I\ndon't mean like record them on your\nphone what I mean is like actually\nwriting them down and saying you know\nhow can I get better what could I do\nwell what can I improve on all that\nstuff\nand the last part of it is just remember\nto be patient so many people are just so\nunpatient progress is not really a\nlinear thing like you're not going to be\nfive percent better every single day\nthere's some days where you're four\npercent better there's some days where\nyou're nine percent better some days\nwhere you're one percent better there's\nsome days where you feel like you're\nfive percent worse right it's not linear\nbut really what it comes down to is just\nmaking sure that you show up every\nsingle day because if you just show up\nevery single day you're gonna get what\nyou want and so really what it comes\ndown to and the reason why the 30 by 30\nstrategy is so powerful because it's so\nsimple it's so easy and it compounds\nlike little teeny tiny things compound\nover time 30 minutes over 30 days is 900\nminutes a month that's 10 950 minutes a\nyear so if you're just really trying to\nget better at one thing and you stick to\nthat thing 10 950 minutes a year that's\na hundred and eighty two hours per year\nthat's 7.6 full days of your life on\ndeliberate practice\nyou want to talk about exponential\ngrowth exponential Improvement that's\nhow you do it that's how you master your\nlife master a habit Master a new skill\nset\nget yourself further than\n99.999999 percent of people that exist\nin this earth in that one thing and make\nyourself into a master so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please do me a favor\nplease share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in it Rob dial
