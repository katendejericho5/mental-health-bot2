about how to be happy because\nessentially all we really want is to be\nhappy don't we but then when you\nactually start to think about it what is\nhappiness like if I were to say what is\nhappiness to you\nwhat you say is my might be different\nthan what I say what somebody else says\nmight be different than both what we say\nbut when you really start to think about\nhappiness what I've come to find is\nhappiness is a state of mind that exists\nwhen desires are absent that's kind of\nwhat I have come up with and I'm going\nto talk to you today about how to be\nmore happy and this is actually inspired\nby a lot of stuff I've been reading by a\nguy named Naval ravikant and there's a\nfew things that he actually says in\nquotes that I'm going to say throughout\nthis one of them that I really love that\nhe says is is that peace is happiness\nat rest in happiness is peace and motion\nand so let me say that again peace is\nhappiness at rest and happiness is peace\nand motion and another thing that he\nsays is when we're calm we're happy and\nwhen we're happy we're at peace and so\nwhen I say happiness and I say peace\nthroughout this episode just know that\nboth of them are quite interchangeable\nas I start talking to you when we talk\nabout happiness though\nwhat does happiness mean I think that\neveryone knows what happiness feels like\nand we might have trouble actually\ngrasping what it is and putting it into\nwords and I would say that our main\nbarrier to happiness is desire and I'm\ngoing to talk a lot about desire today\nwhat it is how it holds you back the\nproblem with it all of that stuff but um\nthe thing that I've learned is that\num growing up there I had a lot of\ndesires desires for traveling desires\nfor Success desires for money all these\ndesires and the funny thing is the older\nthat I get the more that I get of all\nthese things the more I realize that\nthey actually don't do for my\nhappiness or my fulfillment they're all\ngreat and they're they're fine but none\nof them actually change my internal\nState and so if you think to yourself oh\nI'll stop being anxious when I get a\nmillion dollars or I'll be happier when\nI get a million dollars it won't be true\nyou'll just be a millionaire who's\nanxious and unhappy which you know I\nguess is better than being broke and\nbeing anxious and unhappy but the\ninternal state will not be changed by\nthe external environment that's what you\nhave to realize and your main barrier to\nbeing happy is your desire in short you\ncan you can want all of those things you\ncan want to become a millionaire and you\ncould become a millionaire but wouldn't\nyou rather just be happier in the\nprocess of becoming a millionaire\nof course because you could be unhappy\ngoing in in having that desire or you\ncould be happy doing it right so with\ndesire desire is the feeling inside of\nyou internally that something is missing\nand it's the idea that you need\nsomething to make you happy to make you\njoyful to make you calm to make you\npeaceful you need something and until\nyou get that thing you will not be right\nanother thing that that Naval says is\ndesire is a contract that you make with\nyourself to be unhappy until you get\nwhat you want right and so you think to\nyourself like oh I there's this thing\nthat I want and I am unhappy until I get\nthat thing when you want something\nyou're basically making a deal with\nyourself that you're going to be unhappy\nuntil you get it and so we have to\nunderstand our desires and it's okay to\ndesire things like we live in this 3D\nhuman realm and desire is a big piece of\nwhat we have but instead of just\nDesiring every single thing at every\nsingle moment\nwhy don't we actually choose what we\ndesire because each thing that we want\nif we have a lot of different wants oh I\nwant money and I want a successful\nbusiness and I want my children to be\nbetter and I want my wife to do this and\nI want my employees to do this and I\nwant my boss to stop being an\nand I want this and I want this each\nwant is just a choice to be unhappy and\nI think the biggest mistake that we make\nis thinking that we'll be happy when we\nget certain things and so what happens\nis we think okay I I'm not happy yet but\ngetting this thing is going to make me\nhappy and I'm going to talk about it\ntoday but nothing externally can make\nyou happy\nexternally is just external but\nhappiness is internal and so the only\nway to become happy is to actually\ninternally make yourself happy to decide\nto make yourself happy because what\nwe've learned\nsomehow I don't know how it happens\nthrough Society through our parents\nthrough teachers through friends through\nmentors we we get hooked on things we\nget hooked on the wanting things and\nwe're hooked on the idea that something\noutside of us will make us happy and I'm\nhere to tell you that that's an absolute\nLIE there's nothing that you could get\nyou could get the biggest house you\ncould get a brand new Ferrari you could\ntravel the world none of that is\ngoing to make you happy right not\nnot having that thing is not the reason\nwhy you're unhappy getting that thing\nwill not make you happy\nand so think about this for a second\nbecause it's really a conundrum you get\nstuck in right not having that thing is\nnot the problem\nnot being happy is not the problem\nthe desire for something that you don't\nhave is the problem and the crazy part\nabout that is you're creating the desire\nso let me take you through a real quick\nJourney right desire is the problem\ndesire is the thing that's holding you\nback from being happy I and if we take\nanother step back I'm not happy because\nI don't have this thing and when I get\nthis thing I'll be happy that's how most\npeople think so the the desire is the\nactual problem because getting that\nthing is not going to make you happy and\nthe crazy part is that you're creating\nthe desire so the craziest part is that\nthe only problems in your life\nare the problems that you're creating\nwhich means if we can Master our minds\nthere would be no problems and there\nwould only be peace and happiness\nand it took me like 30 something years\nto learn this is that the only problems\nin my life are the things that I'm\nperceiving as problems I I want this\nthing and the fact that I don't have it\nas a problem I want this to be this way\nand the fact that it's not this way is a\nproblem I want you know her to act this\nway and the fact that she's not acting\nthis way is a problem the craziest part\nabout this whole thing is that the only\nproblems that exist are the problems\nthat we're creating in our minds now\nyou'll be like well I well I'm I'm\ntrying to figure out how I can pay my\nbills okay we'll figure it out\nthat's not a problem the problem is that\nyou want the money right now to be able\nto pay those bills and the desire for\nwanting that money is the thing is\nactually creating the problem okay you\ndon't have it well that's just a\ncircumstance that's not a problem that\nyou don't have the money the problem is\nthat you think that the getting of the\nmoney is going to make you happier\nalthough it's going to solve all of your\nproblems no no no no you're just that's\njust a circumstance you don't have the\nmoney to pay your bills okay well figure\nout a way to go make yourself more\nvaluable in the marketplace or to go out\nand actually drive Uber or or to do\nsomething to make money to be able to\npay your bills right so you it's really\nkind of crazy when you actually fully\ngrasp this is that the only problems\nthat exist in your life are the problems\nthat you're creating in your mind\nbut let it set in\nthink of all of your problems and then\nrealize that they're just circumstances\nthat exist in your perception of them is\nthe thing that's making them a quote\nunquote problem\nand so let's go back to to happiness\nright how do we get Happy Well you feel\nhappy when you don't feel like something\nis missing in your life\nyou feel happy when you don't feel like\nsomething is missing in your life you\nfeel at peace you feel content because\nwe often think I need this I need that I\nneed this thing I need that and it could\nbe you know it could be wanting a new\ncar or a house or a vacation or it can\nbe wanting someone in your life to be\ndifferent than they are or to act\ndifferently or to do something\ndifferently and we could think to\nourselves like well I would be happier\nif they stop doing these things to me\nI would be happier if she stopped acting\nthis way I would be happier if my boss\nwasn't such an right they are\nnot the problem\nnot having that thing or not having the\nsituation be what you want it to be is\nnot the problem you and your thoughts\nare the problem\nand so what happens is we get stuck in\nthese these cycles of wanting things and\nthe more things that you want the more\nproblems that you are then creating\nbecause when you want them to desire is\ndistancing you from that thing and\nyou're saying I will not be happy until\nI get this thing if we go back to that\nquote which is desire is a contract that\nyou make with yourself to be unhappy\nuntil you get that thing\nbut when we feel like we have everything\nthat we need\nwe can stop worrying and we can stop\nthinking about the past of the future\nand that's when we allow ourselves the\nspace to be happy think about that for a\nmoment not wanting things creates more\npeace internally\nlisten I'm not saying that you don't you\nshould you should just lose all of your\nmotivation you should just sit on the\ncouch and play video games all day\nbecause that's just you know the\nultimate state of happiness and peace\nand not wanting we do have to live this\nhuman life I do get it and in this human\nlife there is some cool that we\ncould do and there's stuff that we could\nbuy and there's experiences that we\ncould have but the more wants that we\ncreate the more that we're deciding that\nwe want to be unhappy and so what I like\nto say is instead of having all of these\nwants which most of them aren't even\nreally that important decide which wants\nyou want like which ones you want to\nkeep which ones you're going to get want\nto get rid of and when you reach the\npoint of letting go of as many things as\npossible when you can reach the point of\nhopefully sitting there enjoying your\ncup of coffee and realizing there's\nnothing that you need to do there's\nnothing that you need to be there's\nnothing that you need to accomplish and\nyou can reach that point you feel really\nquite calm inside\nand to me happiness isn't about having\ngood thoughts or bad thoughts or being\npositive and not being negative it's not\nabout people not dying in your life or\nthings not changing it's not about all\nof those external circumstances it's\nabout just deciding not to want so many\nthings and to think that getting those\nthings are going to make you happy\nespecially not wanting the things\noutside of yourself you know it's about\nfinding the gratitude that you have\nright now no matter what situation\nyou're in\nit's like that phrase that Robbie the\nrabbi sad and I can't pronounce his name\nor else I would but he says happiness is\nnot wanting happiness is not having what\nyou want but wanting what you have\nlike when you really understand that\nthat happiness is not having what you\nwant but wanting what you have the less\nthat I want\nlike the less things that I want to go\nout and do and feel and buy and\naccomplish and all that stuff the more I\ncan accept things as they actually are\nand the the key of that is the\nacceptance of life as it is the more\nthat I accept and I'm just like oh\nthat's how that person is that's how the\ncircumstance is that's how the bank\naccount is that's how this thing is the\nmore that you can accept these things\nthe less my mind races so the more that\nI can the more that I can accept the the\nless my mind races the more that you can\naccept the more that your mind will be\nable to calm and I don't think happiness\nis is\nI don't think happiness is really that\nhard to achieve I think that we make it\nway harder than it needs to be\nand I think happiness comes from not\nsuffering\nand suffering comes from desire you know\nand so there's a difference between pain\nand suffering suffering pain in your\nlife will just happen suffering is you\nchoosing to go through that pain over\nand over and over again and not wanting\nthings and not worrying too much about\nwhat has been or what will be or what's\ncoming up or what you've done in the\npast and all of that\nwhen you can just remove yourself from\nthe the external world that we've been\ntaught to it's really kind of hard\nbecause it's so\nthe opposite of what we're taught since\nchildhood is not wanting things not\nbeing attached to things not uh not\nbeing not putting investing so much of\nour energy and so much of our worth into\nthe external world but looking inside of\nourselves because looking outside of\nourselves for anything is a mistake\nbecause happiness doesn't come from the\noutside of things happiness is a feeling\nit is a state of mind and have feelings\nand state of minds are internal\nand so we keep thinking we'll be happy\nwhen I get this thing or I get that\nthing and that's mistake that we keep\nmaking\nso believing that something out there\nthat you'll finally get that thing and\nit'll make you happy forever is a lie\nlike a lot of people like they're like\nwell I just need to get a bigger house\nand once I get my dream house then I'll\nbe happy and it's like no you won't when\nyou get your dream house you're gonna\nfeel exactly the same but it's just\ngoing to be more space and then\neventually a couple years down the road\nyou'll be looking at another house right\nhappiness is just an internal job when\nyou want something you're basically\nagreeing to be unhappy until you get it\nwhy don't you just say I don't want any\nmore things I don't need any more things\nI'm happy just the way that I am and\nwhat's kind of crazy about it is that it\nseems so counterintuitive but as you\nwant less things\nmore things start working out for you\nthe way that you actually wanted them to\nin the first place before you decided to\nrelease yourself from wanting all these\nthings it's like\nsynchronous as you just kind of start\nlining up for you\nand we want things all day and we wonder\nwhy we're not happy and it's like well\nyou're not happy because you keep\nwanting more happiness comes from inside\nnot outside and so when you realize this\nyou realize like I said earlier in this\npodcast episode I told you I'll talk\nabout this is that happiness is a choice\nand it's actually a skill set that you\ncan develop developing a skill set takes\ntime and it takes attention though it's\nnot just like you're immediately going\nto be happy because we've been spending\nthe past 25 30 40 Years of Our Lives\nwanting things and so our brain is kind\nof wired to want things and so it takes\nto you know if you're going to develop\nthis skill set of being happy and that's\na different way to look at life is that\nhappiness is a skill set it's going to\ntake time and it's going to take\nattention and now I can already hear\npeople getting pissed off when I say\nhappiness is a choice because they're\nlike well you yeah but that might be\nnice in your life but you don't know\nwhat my life looks like you don't know\nwhat I've been through you don't know\nwhat's happening around me you don't\nknow about the people that I have around\nme cool okay watch this real quick let's\njust try to make this\nas stupid simple as we possibly can like\nlet's just take life right we're going\nto take life right here\nlet's make it stupid simple you're born\nright you're born we're all born into\nthis world and then throughout birth and\ndeath we have all kinds of experiences\nwe see things we hear things we feel\nthings we touch things all of this we\nhave all of these sensory experiences\nfrom birth until death and then one day\nwe die\nis that correct like if we're looking at\nthis from like a hundred thousand foot\nview that's what it is we're born we\nhave all kinds of experiences we see\nthings here things feel things all of\nthat and then we die right those are all\njust sensory inputs\nthat's correct right so how we choose to\ninterpret those experiences in our life\nis up to us\nand how we interpret them will dictate\nwhether we're happier whether we're\npissed off or whether we're sad or\nwhether we're mad or whether we're a\nvictim all of that so what it comes down\nto is we all have birth we all have\ndeath we all have sensory experiences\nhow we choose to how we choose to\ninterpret those experiences is fully up\nto us that's the best part we get to\nchoose and so it shows you it's not\nabout what happens to you but it's about\nhow you choose to interpret them you can\nchoose to be happy there is somebody if\nyou're pissed off and you're like no my\nlife is all that stuff there is\nsomebody else in this world whose life\nis worse than you that is happier than\nyou\nguarantee it if you I'm just going to\nsay this one more time right if you\nthink to yourself my life sucks I don't\nhave what I want I then the reason why\nI'm not happy is because I don't have\nthese things because my life sucks there\nis somebody in this world that has less\nthan you that is happier than you\nwhich proves to you that it's not about\nyou have or don't have it's what you\nchoose to think about your life\nand how you choose to interpret your\nexperiences\nso you can decide like literally right\nnow from this moment on nothing outside\nof me is going to control my emotions\nit's just my life is going to be the way\nthat it is and as things happen things\nwill happen and don't expect life to be\na certain way for you life is just life\nand when you understand that there is no\nreason to be happy or sad or to be any\nof that and when you stop feeling like\nthere's something missing\nyou're left with happiness it's this\nreally wild thing like when you stop\nwanting things you just sit there and\nyou're like oh\nnice well that's pretty awesome so don't\nworry about how things should be or\nshouldn't be and all that stuff just\nfocus on your own experiences and start\nchanging how you interpret them so that\nyou can make yourself happier now\nlet's talk about peace for just a minute\nokay real happiness comes from being at\npeace like I think that when you are\nhappy is when you internally are more at\npeace now you'll never be here 100 of\nthe time promise you that you're going\nto be happy and peaceful and then\nsomeone's going to say something and\nthen you're going to you know someone's\ngonna cut you off and you're going to\nflick them off and honk your horny and\nbe like oh my God what am I doing you're\ngoing to lose yourself many times over\nyour lifetime but most of the time\nhappiness comes from just accepting\nthings as the way they are and not\nwanting to change what's around us and\nit's about really being present and\nallowing ourselves to be comfortable in\nthe present moment because when you're\ncomfortable being present it's like the\ndoor opens up and peace walks in\nbecause you're just like I'm here and in\nbeing here and not wanting things I can\nbe present\nand it's like the reason why a lot of\npeople struggle with meditation I've\nbeen there many times you know this\nmorning I did a 30 minute meditation the\nfirst 15 minutes was me thinking about\nall the I had to do today and then\nI realized I spent 15 minutes thinking\nabout all the stuff I had to do today\nand instead of getting myself mad and\npissed and uh what did I do I just\nwasted 15 minutes I just brought myself\nback to my body to my breath\nfeeling into my body and just feeling my\nheart rate\nand really what it came down to is I was\nwanting to be out of that meditation out\nof that moment so I could get things\ndone right we all find ourselves there\nand\num\nit really comes down to how can we just\nallow ourselves to be more present\nbecause we all want moments that make us\nfeel alive and to feel present don't we\nlike we want to travel we want amazing\nexperiences you want to watch your team\nwin the Super Bowl but here's what's\ncrazy wanting those moments can actually\npull us out of the present moment and\nit's really crazy when you actually\nthink about it we want things that make\nus feel present\nwe want things to make us feel present\nwinning the Super Bowl our team won the\nSuper Bowl that would make you feel\nreally present really excited in the\nmoment you wouldn't be thinking about\nanything else except for how excited you\nwere in that moment when you're in in\nGreece and you're you're having a glass\nof wine and there's a beautiful sunset\nyou're you're very present you're\nwatching the sunset you're tasting wine\nyou're looking at it you're like holy\n this is amazing we want things that\nmake us feel present but the wanting of\nthose things steals our presence right\nnow in this moment\nand so we're always chasing after the\nnext thing and the next thing and the\nnext thing and this conscious Chase\nmakes us start to feel anxious and so\nwhat I've been trying to do lately you\ncan try this if you want\ncompletely up to you I've been trying to\nmake myself really bored lately like\nyesterday I meditated and then I made\ncoffee and on sat on the couch and I\nlooked out my back window for 45 minutes\ndoing nothing\nliterally nothing there wasn't any music\nthat was playing I wasn't reading I was\nsitting on the couch I was looking out\nmy back porch my dog was sitting next to\nme and I was just sitting there doing\nnothing\nhave you ever tried doing that before\nnot doing anything not reading not\nlistening to music it's hard isn't it\nand the reason why is because we're\nalways anxious about having to do\nsomething having something that needs to\ncome up next and this anxiety makes us\nreally unhappy as well and this is all\nof these new thoughts just running\nthrough our heads turning through her\nheads running through her heads and so\nwe often feel really troubled because we\ncan't just sit quietly alone you know\nthere's a quote I can't remember who\nit's from but it says all of all of the\nproblems in the world come from man's\ninability to sit alone in a room by\nhimself and so really what it comes down\nto is if you want to be happy you have\nto be more comfortable with boredom with\nnothing with not needing to do something\nwithout needing to be something without\nhaving to achieve something in realizing\nthat desire\nwant all of those things are stealing\nyour happiness\nand by wanting and Desiring something\nyou're creating the problem which means\nthat all of your problems that exist are\nthe problems you're creating in your own\nmind and so really what it comes down to\nif you want to be happier\nyou just have to realize that it's\nalready here\nright now in this moment you just have\nto decide to be happy it's easier said\nthan done I get it but it's a skill set\nand it's a choice and if it's a skill\nset it means it takes time it takes\nattention it takes practice if it's a\nchoice it means that you're in control\nso that's all I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories tag\nme in it Rob dial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-jr we only grow
