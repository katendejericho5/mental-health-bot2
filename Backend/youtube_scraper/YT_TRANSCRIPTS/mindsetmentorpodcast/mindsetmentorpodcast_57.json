    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be teaching you how to reinvent\nyourself no matter where you are in life\nno matter what age you are so that you\ncan go and create the life that you\ndesire let's dive in today we're going\nto be talking about how to reinvent\nyourself at any age and um I'm going to\ntalk about this I was running a live\nearlier today and it was for mindset\nMentor plus which is a community that\nyou know you've heard me talk about I'm\nsure um if you want to learn more about\nit you can go to mindset mentor.com but\nbasically I was on the monthly Q&A\nsession and one of the the questions\nthat was asked I thought would be really\nimportant for me to cover here and um I\ngot permission from everybody to turn it\ninto a podcast episode so here we are\nthere's a question that was asked me\nfrom a lady and um she was basically\nsaying like I'm 54 years old I don't\nknow what to do with my life I'm I'm\nlost I'm stuck I'm numb nothing seems to\nexcite me where do I even start to like\nstart to figure out what I want in my\nlife you know and she was talking about\nhow she went down this road that she\ndidn't really necessarily want to be on\nand um I think this is a really\nimportant question because of the fact\nthat sometimes a lot of times when I\ntalk to people they feel like they are\ntoo far down the road to reinvent\nthemselves in some sort of way you know\nI've I've talked to people that are\nolder and they don't have any money and\nthey want to reinvent themselves I've\ntalked to people that are younger that\nare extremely successful some extremely\nsuccessful athletes that don't want to\nbe athletes any anymore extremely\nsuccessful CEOs that don't want to run\ntheir business anymore no matter where\nyou are if you feel like the path that\nyou're on is not the path that you want\nto continue on if you fast forward 10\nyears and you're like I don't want to be\nthe CEO of this major corporation\nanymore or I don't want to be broke\nanymore or I don't want to be doing this\nanymore you can reinvent yourself at any\npoint in time and I don't know what\nhappens after this life nobody on Earth\nactually does I don't know if there's a\nheaven in hell I don't know if we get\nreincarnated I don't know if we become\nwarm food I don't know but I do know one\nthing that I'm sure of and it is that I\nam here and I am in this life and I'm\ngoing to get every single thing that I\npossibly can from this life you know\nit's not uncommon if you're out there to\nfeel like you're stuck it's not uncommon\nto feel like you're lost to feel like\nyou're you're numb in some way\nespecially if you just are listening to\nthis podcast you're listening because\nthere's probably a part of you that's\nwoken up in some sort of way you've\nwoken up and and maybe it's you've woken\nup to parts of your life where you want\nyour life to be different in many\ndifferent ways you've woken up to parts\nof yourself where you wish that yourself\nwere a little bit different in many\ndifferent ways because what happens is\nin order for us to go on this journey of\nself-development of Spiritual\nDevelopment we have to go down the wrong\nroad for a little while you cannot find\nyourself unless you've lost yourself and\nso essentially what the question is is\nsaying to me is Rob I have lost myself\nbased off of everything that's happened\nto me so far in the past 54 years how do\nI find\nmyself and that's really what it comes\ndown to is yeah you've lost yourself you\nprobably have conditioning and patterns\nand uh things in your life that you\npicked up from millions and millions of\nlittle tiny experiences things you\npicked up from your parents things You'\npicked up from society and now you've\nwoken up and you've said I don't want\nmany of these things anymore there's\nsome of these things that I want but\nthere's some of the things that I don't\nwant that's fine you know it's it's okay\nto change your life completely to uproot\neverything and change it now I'm not\nsaying if you have children just like\nwalk out the door and never see them\nagain that's not I'm saying take care of\nyour responsibilities pay your bills\ntake care of your children all of that\nbut there's no reason why you can't make\na complete 180 shift no matter what your\nage is I don't know what excites you I\ndon't I don't know what's important to\nyou but you have to actively search for\nit as much as you possibly can if you\ndon't know what you love to do or if you\ndon't know what your purpose or what\nyour passions are find\nit you are in control of your search\nthat is one thing that you are\nabsolutely in control of is your search\nthere's a lot of things in this world\nyou're not in control of but you\nsearching for the thing that you want to\ndo in this life is something that you're\nin control of if you don't know your\npurpose right now it's okay but it's not\nokay to wake up every day and not search\nfor it if you are now aware that you\ndon't know what your purpose\ndon't become a victim of your\ncircumstances or your age I don't care\nyour circumstances I don't care your age\nI don't care how old you are I don't\ncare if you're 60 years old you\ngraduated at 22 and you've been doing\nthe same thing for the past 28 years and\nnow you think well I've been doing it\nfor 28 years I might as well just\ncontinue doing it until I die you know\nyou've been doing it for 28 years let's\nsay that you're 60 and you want let's\nsay you live to 90 that would be amazing\nright that's another 30 years so you're\ntelling you're going to spend the next\n30 years of your life doing what you\ndon't enjoy doing what is not your\npassion because you've been doing\nsomething for 28 years when you put in\nthat perspective it sounds really stupid\ndoesn't it it does so change do\nsomething different move you're not a\ntree you can do something different and\nthe important part of this is right now\nyou've woken up and you've realized that\nthere's parts of your life that need to\nchange and inside of that part that you\nneed to change you're all of that\nencompassing is your comfort zone and so\ngetting out of your comfort zone is the\nmost important part of all of this\nrepeating the same routine without\ntrying new things is going to make you\nstagnant usually when I talk to people\nand they say they feel stuck I usually\nask them when's the last time you did\nsomething new and it's almost always a\nlong time ago it's almost always like\nyears ago when was the last time you did\nsomething that was completely out of\nyour comfort zone went to a place that\nyou've never been to before talked with\npeople in in went to a concert of a that\nyou don't you don't know of or you don't\nenjoy and then you went to a different\nplace like when's when's the last time\nyou played a new sport when's the last\ntime you went to a class to learn how to\nplay a play a musical instrument play\nGuitar Play Piano when's the last time\nthat you decided to go to a pottery\nclass stop doing the same thing over and\nover again to if you haven't found your\npassion it's because you haven't been\nsearching for it you know you stopped\nsearching for your passion like back in\n1984 I'll give an example and I know my\nmom's going to be okay with it but I'll\ngive you an example for my mom my mom uh\nlike 5 years ago was telling me that she\nfeels lonely and she just wants someone\nto get into a relationship with and she\nwanted a partner and um and and my mom\nyou know she would she has her house\nthat's in Florida and she has work she's\na realtor and then my sister has a small\nfarm and they took the barn in the\nbackyard and they converted into a\none-bedroom that my mom want to stays it\nas well and we were having this\nconversation in the the one bedroom in\nthe backyard and I was like yeah well\nthe reason why you haven't met anybody\nis because you're not putting yourself\nout there you know you're doing the same\nthing you're going home you're going and\nworking and then you're coming up and\ngoing to Sarah's house and you're\nhanging out with the children which is\nall great and fine but I promise you\nthis the man of your dreams is not going\nto come into your daughter's front yard\nwalk into the backyard to where the\nlittle Farmhouse is knock on the door\nand be like uh excuse me I'm looking for\nthe love of my life right so he's not\ngoing to be here you have to put\nyourself in places that are different\nfor you in order to find that person and\nso what's awesome about my mom she\ndecided to put herself out of her\ncomfort zone she started to ask herself\nlike what is it that I love to do and my\nmom loves dancing and I don't even know\nif she's ever taken dance lessons her\nentire life but she's like you know what\nI'm going to try to start doing some\ndance and so she went to a place that's\nliterally like a three-minute drive from\nher house she started doing dance\nlessons she started to to you know meet\nnew people she started to put herself\nout there and she got out of her routine\nwhich is the important thing she got out\nof her routine my parents had divorced\nuh like 23 years prior to this\nconversation and so she had been in some\nrelationships and dating and stuff like\nthat but never found like her dream guy\nand I was like you got to put yourself\nout there so she started putting herself\nout there she started doing stuff and\nshe started asking herself like what do\nI love well I love to dance you know\nwhat I'm going to do I'm going to take\nsome dance classes I'm just going to\nmeet some new people and then she\nstarted taking dance classes she got\nsome new friends and then she started\ngoing on Dance dates with her friends\nand going out and dancing and meeting\nnew people and all of this she started\nmeeting new people and started getting\nmore comfortable being out there and\ngetting out of her normal typical work\nand eat and sleep routine and then go to\nmy sister's house routine and all that\nstuff started meeting new people a\ncouple years ago she goes to a friend's\nparty she ends up meeting a guy there\nand my mom gets married at 71 years old\nto a guy that she's just completely in\nlove with which is amazing that's all\nI've ever wanted for her is to find\nsomebody but the key to this story is is\nthat she put herself out there she did\nsomething different she asked herself\nwhat is it that I love I'm going to try\nsome new things I want you guys to\nunderstand it's never too late to change\nit's not too late to change your life\nregardless of your age regardless of\nyour past experiences regardless of your\neducation regardless of your anything\nelse that happened to you in your past\nregardless of your parents all of that\nyou have to take care of your\nresponsibilities of course but also make\ntime to explore new interests into find\nnew things for\nyou hey real quick I want to introduce\nyou to something called mindset Mentor\nplus if you

mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription as I work with a lot of\npeople who are afraid to get out there\nand start changing their lives most\npeople want change\nthey want their life to be different\nthey want to be happier they want to be\nhealthier but people off often when I\ntalk to them it's really hard for them\nto get out of their comfort zone despite\ntheir comfort zone being absolutely\nmiserable to them the feeling of being\nmiserable has been going on for so long\nthat it's\ncomfortable and it's weird to think\nabout but miserable feels comfortable\nbecause you've been there for\nsometime happiness can be what you want\njoy can be what you want but you can be\nscared of it because it's so far out of\nyour comfort zone it is the unknown what\nwho who will I become if I'm happy I\nonly know the miserable version of me I\nonly know this version I only know the\naccountant version of me that's been\nthis way for 28 years stepping out of\nyour comfort zone although it is very\nuncomfortable can lead to the biggest\nchanges in your life and so if you're\nlooking at where you currently are and\nyou're like I don't want to be here I\ndon't want to do this anymore well then\nyou can't wake up tomorrow and do the\nsame you've been doing every single\nday for the past 14 years or 3 years or\ntwo months or whatever it is for you you\nhave to get out of your comfort zone you\nhave to do something new and you have to\ntry activities you've never done before\ntry something that you love like think\nabout to when you were a kid what did\nyou love to do did you love you know art\ndid you love music did you love dancing\ndid you love going to the movies did you\nlove cooking what were some of the\nthings that you loved as a child and\nthen ask yourself can I put myself out\nthere you know what I love to do I loved\nwatching my mom do Pottery when I was a\nkid I wonder if there's any pottery\nclasses around here and then you Google\npottery classes Austin Texas and boom\nboom boom boom boom they all pop up or\nmaybe it's in a neighboring City that's\n30 minutes away from you if you live in\na small town and it's it's funny because\nit seems scary as you start to push\nyourself out there it also seems\nexciting but then you go and you do this\nthing that you haven't done in a long\ntime or you've never done before and a\npart of you opens up that was never\nthere before or maybe let's say this\nit's been there all along but it opens\nback up and so what I want you to do is\nI want you to understand this when\nyou're starting to think about this\nstart small what's the the thing that's\nthe easiest to do the lowest barrier to\nentry you know it's is it is it\nnerve-wracking to walk into a place and\ntake dance classes when you've never\ntaken dance classes before and and maybe\nlook like a fool yeah it is could it be\nfun ah it could be fun\nokay so try some dance classes go to a\nnew city take take a new way home from\nwork the important part of this is I\nthink more people listening myself\nincluded all of us need to be more\nCurious like when do you remember what\nit was like when you were a kid do you\nremember watching your children do you\nremember watching your your nieces and\nnephews just child children in general\nlike they're so curious when was your\ncuriosity killed cuz it's still there\nyou just got to reignite it ah what's\nwhat's down this road what would it be\nlike to go to a a painting class I\nwonder if there's any you know what I\nwant to learn more about psychology I\nwonder if there's any courses that I can\ngo to there's a local University or\nCommunity College maybe I can go and\nactually like learn a little bit more\nabout it what kind of people are at a\ndance\nclass I think what's important and and I\nhave been uh really bad at this in the\npast is my life for a long time became\nwork and that was it and I would work\nand I would work and I would work and I\nkind of lost my time for play I think\nthat every one of us needs to make more\ntime for play don't just work and work\nand work like you weren't born to just\npay the bills and die and to you know\nsee more digits inside of a bank account\nlike try new things try new hobbies like\nfor me it used to be work but for me\nwhat I'm trying to do is I'm trying to\nhave as much play as I possibly can what\nis it that seems a little bit\ninteresting to you what is it that puts\nyou out of your comfort zone have you\nthought about going skydiving have you\nthought about maybe taking your car and\nracing it around a track have you\nthought about maybe trying some new\nstuff going to an arcade maybe you like\nplaying video games or there are other\npeople in the in the the area that like\nplaying video games go on to Facebook\nstart searching your area and see if\nthere's other people that are doing the\nthings that you like to do there are\ncommunities no matter how weird your\nthing is that you like there are\ndefinitely communities that are into\nwhat you're into can you find those\ncommunities can you find those people\ncan you connect to them there's a part\nof you that's just looking to be\nreignited it's not that it was never\nthere it's always been there it's been\nlying dormant saying hey I'm ready for\nyou to come bring me back I'm ready to\nhave some fun I'm ready to find my\npassion ready to find my purpose and\nyour passion and your purpose don't have\nto be your paycheck it could just be\nsomething that you do outside of work\nthat you spend your free time doing but\nmakes you feel like you're alive inside\nbecause burnout doesn't come from doing\ntoo many things burnout comes from doing\ntoo little of what you actually love and\nso what I would recommend to you is to\nunderstand no matter what age you are\nyou can reinvent yourself at any moment\nyou can you can bring that childlike\nfeeling back in you can decide to start\nthat new business and and put yourself\nout there you decide to you know decide\nto go to a knitting class start knitting\nsome things and then start going to a\nfarmers market and selling the stuff\nthat you knit there's a million ways to\nfind what it is that you're passionate\nabout what your purpose is what makes\nyou feel like a kid again what lights\nyou up what feels like play to you but\ncould feel like work to other people you\njust have to be willing to get out of\nyour comfort zone if you're not willing\nto get out of your comfort zone you're\nnot going to be able to find it so\nthat's what I
