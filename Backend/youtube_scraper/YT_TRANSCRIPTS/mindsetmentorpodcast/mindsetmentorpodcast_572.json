    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today I'm going to be talking\nabout how to overcome procrastination\nI'm going to give you a step-by-step\nguide to taking action and there's six\ndifferent steps that we're going to go\nthrough today but when you look at\nprocrastination I always think about\nprocrastination I'm like why does\nprocrastination exist because\nprocrastination is basically the thief\nof your time one of the main things that\nholds people back is that they decide\nyes decide is a correct word they decide\nto procrastinate it might be an\nunconscious decision that happens really\nquick in the moment but they have\ndecided to do it a lot of people are\nlike they talk about when people talk\nabout procrastination someone's like oh\nmy God procrastination I'm such a victim\nof it no dude you're deciding to and if\nyou're going to get the life that you\nwant you've got to decide not to and\nyou've got to figure out how to get past\nit you know if you want to build the\nbusiness that you want instead of\nspending too much time on Instagram and\nprocrastinating you're going to have to\nput time into building it if you want to\nlose weight and instead of watching\nNetflix and farting around on the couch\nyou're gonna have to actually put in\nsome work in the kitchen you're gonna\nhave to put some work in the gym\ninstead of procrastinating and just so\nyou know I want you to I don't want you\nto feel special\neveryone procrastinates to some degree\nand so if you're sitting there and\nyou're like guilting and shaming\nyourself for procrastinating and\nthinking that you know oh it's so bad\nthat I do it I don't think other people\nhave to deal with it they do everybody\nprocrastinates to some degree delaying\ntasks is is easy to do it is easier to\nnot do something than to do something\nand humans will naturally take the easy\nroute humans are like water we will\nalways find the path of least resistance\nnaturally that's what we're going to do\nif we're unconscious not paying\nattention we have to actually become\nmore conscious become more intentional\nto actually take the hard route and so\nwe'll delay tasks because it's easier\nnot to do something than do something or\nit's easier to do something easy like\nscroll on Instagram rather than pick up\nthat exact same phone and make 100 cold\ncalls to build your company right it's a\nlot easier to do nothing or to do\nsomething easy\nwhat if though we could flip the script\nWhat If instead of being a constant\nvictim or acting like a constant victim\nof procrastination you could actually\nMaster the art of overcoming it and\nactually take action does that Intrigue\nyou if it does listen up\nI'm going to take you on a journey\ntoward understanding procrastination and\nthen actually if you can understand it\nyou can beat it and I'm going to give\nyou really practical strategies to help\nyou boost your productivity and then\nactually reclaim control of your time so\nwhen you look at like the let's say the\nanatomy of procrastination right one of\nthe things that I came to realize\nprobably about six months ago is\nprocrastination is and this might blow\nup a lot of people's minds\nprocrastination is never actually the\nproblem procrastination is not your\nproblem procrastination is the\ndownstream effect or result of something\nthat is upstream and so like we might\nprocrastinate on um\ncreating a presentation for work right\nand we think like the procrastination is\na problem no no the problem isn't the\nprocrastination the prob that's the the\nsymptom right but it's not the cause of\nit the cause is that maybe you're afraid\nof screwing it all up in front of your\nboss and you're really afraid of public\nspeaking that's the problem\nthat's the cause but the symptom itself\nis the procrastination and so that's the\nreally important thing is if you're\nprocrastinating ask yourself what is the\nroot of this procrastination why am I\nprocrastinating I'm procrastinating on\nthe presentation that's not the problem\nthe problem is that you're afraid of\npublic speaking\nthat's what the problem is and so you've\ngot to kind of go upstream and try to\nfigure out what that is\nso when you look at procrastination\nlet's understand at the roots right\nprocrastination is really often\nunconscious we don't really notice it\nuntil later\nit might be 20 minutes later it might be\n20 seconds later but really what it\nlooks like is you know a unwelcome task\nappears it could be writing a report it\ncould be doing laundry it could be\nmaking an important phone call\nbut the mind will want to avoid the\ndiscomfort that comes from that even the\ndiscomfort of just getting up and doing\nthe laundry right and that makes us\nDeLay So the Mind wants to chill it\ndoesn't want to do anything the body\nalso wants to chill\nit doesn't want to do anything so what\ndoes it do it decides oh it kind of\nWhispers In Your Ear hey not now\nno no no you could do that later you can\ndo it later no big deal because you\ndon't want to do anything you're all\npeople are inherently lazy and what\nhappens procrastination sets in\nprocrastination is not just 100 uh\nlaziness or poor time management it's\nreally a complex interaction of\ndifferent psychological factors it\ninvolves the struggle between our\npresent self which prefers immediate\ngratification and our future self which\nvalues long-term Rewards\nyou know you could want to build the\nbusiness of your dreams and become a\nmulti-millionaire and your future self\nwould would know that putting in the\nwork and having you know not getting\nimmediate gratification would be better\nbut your present self is like I want to\nplay a video game\nhmm I want to take a nap I want to\nscroll on Instagram I want to do\nsomething else instead so there's\nthere's really a a teeter-totter effect\nwhether it's your present self that\nwants immediate gratification and\nthere's your future self which values\nlong-term Rewards\nis it possible to hack your present self\nand given a media gratification to\nactually taking action maybe you're just\ngonna have to continue to listen this\nepisode and see if it comes up but I\nhave a little bit of a tip that's gonna\nbe coming up that'll help you hack your\npresent self if you're not intentional\nthough you'll almost always go the easy\nroute and you'll talk yourself out of\nwhy you don't need to do it now even if\nyou need to do it now you can also talk\nyourself out of why you don't need to do\nit now and researchers have actually\nfound in in turn this term\nthat they've created around that is what\nthey call temporal discounting which is\nwhere the present self tends to\nundermine the future self's goals so\nit's like you know you want to build a\nbusiness become a multi-millionaire but\nthen somehow you will talk yourself out\nof it and you are undermine what it is\nthat you need to do in order to get\nthere and so it's called temporal\ndiscounting so\nthat's really what procrastination is\nthat's where it comes from all of that\nlet's go into the six steps to actually\novercome procrastination and take action\nthe first thing is to recognize in a\nknowledge a first step to overcoming any\nproblem is acknowledging its existence\nrecognizing that procrastination is\nsomething that you do and it's really\ntricky because procrastination often\nmasks itself as taking a break or\nwaiting for the right mood or waiting to\nbe motivated or I'm hungry and so it\ncould be it can mask itself in many\ndifferent ways but when you start to\nactually pay attention to yourself you\ncan actually start to uncover different\nplaces where your procrastination comes\nup if you're consistently finding\nyourself delaying tasks especially those\nthat are really important but don't have\nimmediate Rewards\npretty damn good chance you're\nprocrastinating\nsay it with me now my name is Rob and\nI'm a procrastinator\nhi Rob so it's like you whatever your\nname is my name is blank I'm a\nprocrastinator you are we all are we all\ndo it it's about recognizing it it's\nabout acknowledging it and then it's\nabout going through the rest of these\nsteps and actually getting past him so\nthat's step number one recognize it step\ntwo is understand your triggers once\nyou've acknowledged your procrastination\nthe next step is to understand what\ntriggers your procrastination for some\nit might be the fear of failure once\nagain it's it's the Upstream we're\ntrying to go upstream and actually see\nwhat the actual cause of the uh\nprocrastination is itself for some it\nmight be the fear of failure\nyou want to start the business you want\nto do that thing and then you realize\nthat you're you don't do it in the\nprocrastinate you know I'm\nprocrastinating a little bit but it's\nnot procrastination's problem it's the\nproblem is that you're afraid of failing\nor you're afraid of being judged and so\nthe the task might be too daunting\nyou know and so for others it might be\nit might be that for some for other\npeople it might be the lack of immediate\ngratification like you just want\nimmediate gratification you have trained\nyour brain too much to immediately get\nwhat you want oh I'm hungry I get food\noh I'm thirsty I get water oh I've got a\npoop you go poop oh I've gotta I I want\nto get on Instagram you immediately go\non Instagram and it might be just a you\nyou're just trained yourself same way\nyou train a dog you've trained yourself\nto immediate gratification\nwhatever it might be you have to\nidentify these triggers because it can\nhelp you prepare and strategize against\nprocrastination\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a real quick favor give us a like\ndown below and then if you have any\ntopics that you want me to cover or any\nquestions put them down below as well so\nI can get some ideas of how I can help\nyou guys at a deeper level and so when\nyou identify what normally triggers you\nyou can start to make a plan for what\nyou're going to do the next time you're\ntriggered oh I'm noticing I'm\nprocrastinating why am I procrastinating\nam I afraid of something I am afraid of\nsomething what am I afraid of I'm afraid\nof failure oh I remember I thought\nabout this last week this happened to me\nokay what was the plan that I said I was\ngoing to do as soon as I get afraid I\nwas going to make myself do 100 push-ups\nand I was going to immediately take the\naction I'm supposed to take whatever it\nis figure it out it's not really that\nhard a trigger could be thinking about\nall that you have to do today to move\nyour business forward\nand too much to think about all at once\ncan cause paralysis by analysis so you\ninstead decide to play a video game\nbecause it's just immediate\ngratification you get some dopamine you\nfeel good then your present self wins\nyour present self wins because it wants\nimmediate gratification your future self\nloses which is delayed gratification\nyour future self the one that could have\nthe business that could have the life\nthat could be able to travel the world\nall of those things loses because\nwhat happened yep you decided to go\nahead and play video games instead of\nbuilding your business so it really\ncomes down to figuring out what your\ntriggers are and you know how to\nactually create a plan around it so\nthat's the second thing\nthe third thing is break down your tasks\na really crucial strategy to overcoming\na procrastination is to take your tasks\nand break them into small manageable\nparts\noftentimes your procrastination comes\nbecause you're thinking about everything\nprocrastinate procrastination a lot of\ntimes is your brain thinking about\neverything everywhere all at once right\nso you're like I gotta build a business\nand you think about the next 10 years of\nevery single thing that you need to do\nover the next 10 years when literally\nall you have in front of you is the next\nhour but you're thinking about the next\n10 years and you're like oh my God too\nmuch I'm gonna play video games instead\nand you don't do it\nright so break your tasks down and and\nso it's not paralysis by analysis and\nthis helps you make your task less\ndaunting allows you to have a sense of\nachievement when you accomplish these\nlittle teeny tiny tasks these sub tasks\nto the big task so let's say that you\nknow let's let's give you an example\nlet's say that you have to prepare for a\nbusiness proposal right and you're\nexcited about the big business proposal\nbut it's it's a lot right so instead of\nsaying on your to-do list I need to\naccomplish the business proposal which\ncan cause paralysis by analysis because\nthere's a lot of stuff that's in there\nyou can divide into smaller parts so you\ncould say research the business proposal\nresearch what other people's business\npurposes look like that could be it so\nresearch could be one drafting could be\nanother task editing could be another\ntask and so on and so forth right so\nit's still creating the business\nproposal what you're doing is you're\nactually taking subtasks and putting\nthose on your to-do list because what\nhappens is when you accomplish a subtask\nyou get a little bit excited about\nyourself\nyou're like damn it I did it this is\nawesome good job and you're more likely\nto continue to keep going because at\nthat point in time when you get excited\nyour brain releases dopamine you're a\ndopamine addict we all are and you just\nwant more dopamine so you're more likely\nto go and take the next task and keep\ngoing\nand make sure tasks that aren't quite\nbig sometimes less intimidating and you\ncan also track your progress of making\nsure that you get everything that you\nneed to so that's step number three step\nnumber four I've coached thousands of\npeople and this is one thing that I've\nrealized like 95 of people are absolute\nabsolutely terrible at time management\nstep number four is get better at time\nmanagement a lot of people like oh my\nGod I don't have enough time and I'm\nlike if I followed you around every\nminute of your day for the next week I\nwould be able to find hours in your day\nmost likely right so use different time\nmanagement techniques and you know I've\nI've created entire podcast episodes on\nthese so I'm not going to cover these in\ndepth but one of them is a Pomodoro\nTechnique 25 minutes on five minutes off\nanother one is time blocking from this\ntime to this time I'm only doing this\nthing so like for me for like creating\nthis podcast episode took about two\nhours to create this podcast episode\nplaying it all out do my research\neverything so I actually time block from\n11AM to 1 I'm planning this podcast\nepisode around procrastination so that's\nconsidered time blocking and number\nthree is a really good one which is\nbatching tasks so like\nanother thing that there's batching is\nthis is the second podcast that we've\nrecorded today I'm going to record three\ntoday and so we batch all of them and we\ndo one right after another after another\nso I just got one done I'm in the middle\nof one right now I've got one more to do\ntoday right instead of doing like one on\nMonday and one on Wednesday and one on\nFriday just batch them and so a few time\nmanagement techniques that'll help you\nyou know besides planning out your\nschedule is use the Pomodoro Technique\nuse time blocking use batching just try\nto get better at time management a lot\nof times these methods that you can use\nthey encourage you to be more focused\nthey prevent you from burning out and\nthey actually promote effective use of\nyour time as well and so number four get\nbetter at time management number five\nset specific and achievable goals and so\nwhen you said vague unrealistic goals it\n100 almost every time breeds\nprocrastination so the key to motivating\nyourself is to set very specific\nachievable goals and to know the outcome\nthat you want of those goals so instead\nof saying something like work on report\nright if you're to-do list if you look\nat it says work on report try something\nlike write the introduction to the\nreport by 10 am\nthat's much easier to do right you have\na shorter part of the report which makes\nit easier to accomplish it and you've\nalso got a specific time it needs to be\ndone by so instead of work on report\nit's something like right introduction\nto the report by 10 am\nthat would be a really good example of\nsetting a specific but also achievable\ngoal that's step number five step number\nsix is to reward yourself rewards\nprovide immediate gratification to the\npresent self\nremember I said I'm gonna give you a\nlittle hack if you are present self\nwants immediate gratification how can\nyou try to give it immediate\ngratification as soon as you get\nsomething done and so if you go back and\nyou do write that introduction and you\nget it done by 10 AM how can you reward\nyourself for it it could be once again a\ncup of coffee and it could be a piece of\nchocolate it could be just being excited\nabout doing it and actually just\ncelebrating yourself could be putting on\nyour favorite song and dancing around\nlike an idiot inside of your house when\nyou get it done and that way you get\nimmediate gratification your brain\nreleases dopamine and that crackhead\nthat's in all of our our heads that just\nwants dopamine doping doping and wants\nimmediate gratification right now right\nnow right now gets what it wants and so\nyou actually reward yourself when you\naccomplish these smaller subtasks and so\nyou reward yourself it could be a short\nbreak\ncup of coffee anything that feels like a\ntreat whatever it might be and so you\nbreak it down into smaller task and then\nyou reward yourself as well so those are\nsix different steps to accomplishing and\novercoming your procrastination\nprocrastination\nit's it happens with every single person\nit's not insurmountable you're not the\nfirst person to deal with it but when\nyou understand the roots of it you\nunderstand there's something upstream\nand you start to figure out what that\nthing is you figure out what the\ntriggers are and you actually use\nstrategic steps to to counter it it\nmakes it not really that hard to do not\nreally that daunting it's not really the\nhardest thing to overcome\nprocrastination it just takes time it\ntakes attention it takes intention you\nknow Mark's Twain said it wisely so the\nsecrets to getting ahead in life is just\ngetting started so get started\none step at a time with that I'm Gonna\nLeave the same way leave you every\nsingle episode make it your mission to\nmake somebody else's day better I\nappreciate you and I hope that you have\nan amazing day"
