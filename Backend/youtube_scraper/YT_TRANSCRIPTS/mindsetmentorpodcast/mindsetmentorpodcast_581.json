    "transcript": "here's a really really simple strategy\nto be successful write down all of your\ngoals reason why I say that is because\nHarvard did a study in the 1970s with\nall of their graduating class and found\nout that only three percent of those\nstudents who were graduating wrote down\ntheir goals but 10 years later they\nfollowed up with all of those students\nand found out that the three percent\nthat wrote down their goals were more\nthan 10 times more successful than the\nentire 97 percent combined that didn't\nwrite down their goals and so that\nbrings the question why is that well\nbecause when you write down your goals\nit makes them real it makes them\nphysically exist in this world and when\nit's on paper it makes it so much easier\nto be planned so if somebody wants to be\nreally successful it's real simple just\nstart by writing down your goals"
