    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to be authentically you who\nyou truly are deep down inside and we're\ngoing to talk about how to not give your\npower away to other people because once\nyou know who your true self is once you\nknow what you represent what you stand\nfor what you love what you hate what\nmakes you happy what makes you sad once\nyou truly know who you are\nmakes it really easy to step into that\nversion of yourself and to step into\nthat version of yourself powerfully and\nnot give your power away to other people\nand so when we first dive into it like\nwhat does it mean to be authentically\nyou like when you think about that I was\nsitting around thinking what does it\nmean to be fully authentically yourself\nand what I think it means is that your\nthoughts your actions and your feelings\nalign with who your true self is now a\nlot of times when I chat with someone\nwho says they feel quote unquote stuck\nin their lives they're like I'm stuck in\nmy business or I'm stuck in my\nrelationship or I just feel stuck in\ngeneral I feel like my wheels are\nspinning have you ever felt that way\nbefore a lot of times I find it's\nbecause they're in a place in their life\nwhere they're not being fully authentic\nwhether that's\nin the relationship they're not being\nfully authentic and their business not\nbeing fully authentic but in most cases\nit's usually a lot of different places\nwhere they're not being truly fully\nauthentically themselves in more cases\nthan not they're usually not themselves\nmore than actually are themselves now\nyou might be listening this you're like\nbut Rob I know who I am I I live with\nmyself every minute of every day since\nI've been born for 47 years I'm here to\ntell you you know who you think you are\nbut as you start going on a path of\nself-discovery which we'll talk about in\na little while you actually start to\nrealize that who you are right now or\nwho you think you are right now is\nactually not who you truly are there's\npieces of you that are your true self\nbut there's definitely pieces of you\nthat have been built and conditioned to\nbe someone based off of what your\nparents wanted based off of what you\nthought Society wanted your spouse\nwanted friends wanted all of that\nin order to be authentically you\nyou really got to know who the hell you\nare first what you want in this world\nwhat the real you is behind the Persona\nthe mask that you have built for the\nworld in order to fit in behind your\nname behind your gender behind your\nreligion your sexual preference your\nskin color behind all of the your behind\nyour degree what school you went to\nbehind all of that there's a real you\nthat's behind that and you know usually\nwhen you ask somebody who are you well\nmy name is Rob and I'm a podcaster okay\nwho are you though well you know I'm 37\nyears old and I grew up in Florida and I\nlive in Austintown okay but who are you\nand usually what we say when we think\nsomeone asks us who we are\nwe start saying who we've what we've\ndone what we've accomplished and none of\nthat is actually who you truly are\nbecause when you were born you had\naccomplish none of those things but you\nat your birth was your truest self and\nthen you discover who your quote unquote\nsupposed to be based off of the world in\norder for us to be fitting in with\nSociety in order for us to be quote\nunquote domesticated to fit in with the\nrest of the world but there's one really\nbig problem and the big problem is\nthere's a big part of you that you don't\nshow to the world\nsimply because you don't know that it's\nthere\nand this is where you really have to\nstart on the path of living\nauthentically by discovering your true\nself by going on a journey of\nself-discovery\nwho you are what do you want what makes\nyou happy what makes you sad what are\nthe things that you truly want to do\nwhat are the things that you want to\nstop doing then you start going and\nfinding every single thing that you can\nfind in self-discovery is not a\ndestination it's a journey and this\nreally this this journey until you die\nself-discovery is not like six months\nfrom now I will finally know who I truly\nam no it's like it's like an onion you\npeel off another layer and you find\nsomething else you put off another way\nand you find something else you will\nalways be discovering more about\nyourself it is an onion that just never\nstops until the day that you die which\ncan seem\nscary for a lot of people but if you see\nit as a journey it could actually be fun\nof going I'm going to this I'm going to\nconstantly be discovering who I am that\nlittle inner child that still lives\ninside of me what they like what they\nwant to do what makes what's fun with\nthem all of that and so how do you\nreally start to discover who you truly\nare how do you discover more about\nyourself is really the question you're\nprobably thinking right my biggest tip\nthat I can give you is be quieter more\noften\nfor some reason we live in a society\nwhere people don't like to be bored they\ndon't like to be quiet we like constant\nstimuli if we're sitting on the couch\nand it's quiet we have to turn the TV or\nwe have to get our phone like when was\nthe last time\nthat you just sat on your couch in the\nmorning and then just drank your coffee\nand complete silence for an hour I did\nthat this morning when I was actually\nstarting to think about this podcast\nepisode I was starting to plan it all\nout was just sitting there there's a\npart of me that wanted to go to my phone\nbut my phone was in the kitchen it was\nin the other room and I had to get up\nand get it so I was like I'm just going\nto sit here and then there was a part of\nme that was like you know what I'm gonna\nput on some music like I'm about to work\nout a little while maybe I should put on\nsome music upbeat music to kind of get\nmyself ready for my workout and I was\nlike no\nshut the up\nsit here and just think just allow your\nbrain to process information and be\nquieter more often shut up more often\nmeditate past the point of comfort\nwhat do I mean by that most people that\nI speak to are like I'm not good at\nmeditating my brain goes all over the\nplace what I say to them is just\nmeditate longer\nbecause what you notice is there's a\npart of you that's trying to fight\nsitting there and doing nothing\nwhen you really start to get the\nbenefits of meditation is when you\nactually sit quieter longer I just got\nback last week from a seven day it was\nactually six full days so six and a half\nday meditation conference Retreat that I\nwent to and it was about 40 hours of\nmeditating in six days and one of the\nmornings we actually started meditating\nat four A.M\nand we did not get done with meditating\nuntil 8 45 a.m it was 4 a.m and it was 4\nhours and 45 minutes and there's so much\nuncomfortability that comes up I want to\nsleep I want to move my back hurts all\nof this stuff and you just let it all\npass it comes up and you just let it all\npass and so I've noticed with myself\nwhen I was meditating for 20 minutes for\n30 minutes that the first\nsometimes 18 minutes of a 20 minute\nmeditation my brain's all over the place\nI'm fighting I'm fighting I'm like I\ngotta get up I got so much to do\nI've got a business I've got employees\nI've got things that have to happen\nand what do I do I say shut up you're\nstaying here longer until you can give\nup and it's just like training a dog\njust get quieter just get quieter\nmeditate past the point of comfort\nor I guess past a point of discomfort is\nprobably the better way of saying it\npast the point of discomfort until it\nbecomes a little bit more comfortable\nwhat happens is your brain has this\nheightened State and you're just trying\nto pacify you're just trying to calm it\ndown and what happens is as you start to\nmeditate more as you start to get more\nquiet as you start to journal more about\nyour life about your mindset about your\nhopes your dreams your desires what you\nhate what you love what brings you Joy\nwhat brings you sadness you start to\nactually ReDiscover parts of yourself\nlike one of the things that I found out\nyears ago about myself I guess I\nrediscovered about myself is that I love\nbeing outside\nI was like man I don't feel like I'm\noutside enough like even just walking\ninto my porch and just sitting there for\n20 minutes without my phone\njust sitting there quietly looking at\nthe trees listening to the birds hanging\nout in nature\nand the more that I actually start to\ngive myself time to just kind of sit and\nsimply exist the more that things start\nto come into my mind that I remember and\nI was like man I really don't spend\nenough time outside why don't I spin it\nup why do I love being outside so much I\nstarted to realize oh man when I was a\nkid I used to sleep outside all the time\nwe used to have a screened-in porch when\nI was younger I didn't have a bedroom so\nI slept on the couch my a two bedroom my\nmom and dad had one bedroom my sister\nwho was a teenager at the time had\nanother bedroom I slept on the couch I\nnever had a room at that point in time\nnot until I was older and so instead of\nsleeping on the couch I would go outside\nand actually sleep on the patio where we\nhad a couch as well and I forgot about\nthat and then I asked my mom and I was\nlike Hey did I used to sleep on the\noutside a lot she's like all the time\nyou loved being outside and I was like\n that's a part of myself from when I\nwas a kid I think I lost and I started\nto just kind of go outside more when I\ngo outside I started to ReDiscover more\nabout myself and I just hang out and so\nI want you to start to think about that\nlike are there parts of yourself that\nmaybe you've forgotten about things that\nyou love to do deep down inside that\nmaybe you push the Wayside because\nyou're quote-unquote in adults or maybe\nyou're too busy and I wanna I wanna tell\nyou a story as you start to think about\nthis if you've been listening to to this\npodcast for a while you know my style\nmy style is just truly who I actually am\nit's short it's to the point it's no BS\nthere's no sugar coating here I'm going\nto tell you from a place of love with\nall the love that I possibly can how to\nget your together but only because\nI love you and I want you to have the\nbest life I don't see a reason for\nsugarcoating it and I'm going to tell\nyou in ways that aren't the sweetest\nsometimes\nand that's okay because some people will\nbe attracted to that and some people\nwon't and I personally love cussing I\nthink it adds so much flavor to a\nsentence\nyou know to say oh like what what I went\nthrough when I was younger was really\nhard or you could say what I went\nthrough when I was younger was really\n hard there's there's a\ndifference between the two\nand so through my podcast I've actually\nthrough this podcast rediscovered myself\nin a lot of different ways it's been\nvery cathartic for me and I've it's been\na form of therapy to be able to do this\nso I always tell people and they're like\nyour podcast helped me so it helps me so\nmuch I'm like it helps me so much I'm\nwriting it for me to remind me all the\ntime in my first about 650 episodes I\ndid very little cussing like just very\nlittle but if you were to come to my\nhouse and you were to see me around my\nfriends I cuss I didn't I don't hold\nback and I realized that how could I be\nthis way on the podcast and not cuss but\nthen my true self is to express freely\nexactly how I do\nhow could I possibly think that somebody\nwill listen to me if I'm only being 90\nof me\nso I decided I was going to start\ncussing if I wanted to I'm not going to\njust say it just to say it I'm not going\nto be obscene to be obscene but if it if\nit adds flavor to the sentence if it\nshows my true passion of where I'm\nspeaking I'm going to do it and I heard\na podcast episode with Rick Rubin who is\nbasically the most prolific music\nproducer that's ever existed and he said\nthey were talking someone was saying\nthat they were really insecure that was\ninterviewing him and they're like man I\nwish I was more like you like you don't\nseem like you care if someone likes you\nand he said I'll never forget he said\nwhy would why would I care if you like\nme like I I want you to like me but I\nwill not change myself for you to like\nme\nI thought that was really big where he\nsaid I want you to like me I want\neveryone to like me but there is no\npiece of me that will change who I am\ndeep down inside simply for you to\naccept me because then you're not even\naccepting me you're accepting my false\nself\nand then so what happened was once I\nstarted cussing something clicked and I\nfelt like myself and I expressed better\nand I express more freely and I could\nhear my tonality change and I get emails\nand messages every so often every five\nor ten a week on Instagram people send\nme a message on Instagram and they say\nhey Rob I love your show but could you\nstop cussing\nhey I love your show but I don't like\ncuss words could you stop cussing and\nthat's like seeing somebody\nwho is just having the best day they're\nhaving fun and they're laughing with\ntheir friends and you walking up to them\nand saying hey I see you laughing I see\nyou having a great time you're having so\nmuch fun but can you stop laughing so\nloud it's really interrupting my\nthoughts\nlike how crazy would that be to go try\nto make somebody stop expressing their\ntrue self so that you feel better and\nthe reason why I bring that up is\nbecause when you discover your true self\nyou don't really care\nif people accept you or not\nlike you care way more about people\naccepting you when you are someone else\nother than your true or self when you're\nnot your true self\nbecause you don't fully accept you\nbecause it's not you so you're looking\nfor other people to reflect acceptance\nto you so that you can accept your false\nself more\nyou see how deep that goes like rewind\nthat real quick if you need to let me\nsay I'll just say it again for you one\nmore time\nyou care way more about people accepting\nyou when you are somebody else other\nthan your true self because you don't\nfully accept your true your your false\nself\nbecause it's not you so you're looking\nat other people to try to get other\npeople to reflect acceptance of your\nfalse self so that you can try to accept\nyour false self because you don't fully\naccept your false self\nsee how deep that is and when you think\nof like I always use cussing as an\nexample because it's so stupid it's just\na word it's not good or bad it's just a\nsound coming out of somebody's face\nand to think that a word is bad\njust shows programming and programming\nis where somebody's not free and so you\nhave to realize that your your internal\nenvironment should not be shifted by a\nsound that's coming out of somebody\nelse's face\nbecause if it is it's showing you or\nyou're not free\nyou know and there's a lot of\nprogramming involved for someone to say\na quote-unquote bad word who said that a\nword is bad and who said that a word is\ngood somebody who is no smarter than you\na hundred two hundred three hundred\nyears ago\nhell they're probably less smart than\nyou and they said oh that's a bad word\nand everyone ooh everybody in the world\nwent oh that's a bad word yeah we're not\nsupposed to say that yeah no nobody will\nlike us if we say that oh no this My\nReligion they won't accept me there if I\nsay that and really what it comes down\nto is is I've said this quote hundreds\nof time on the podcast which is Eleanor\nRoosevelt says no one can make you feel\ninferior without your consent nobody can\nmake you feel inferior without your\nconsent nobody can stir up your internal\ndialogue your world without your consent\nyou are giving up your control over\nfeeling and feeling over somebody else\nand what they're saying and you know\nVictor Frankel who is\nhas a great book which I've said many\ntimes if you haven't read it man search\nfor meaning you should definitely read\nit and he was a psychologist who went\nthrough uh Nazi prison camps and\nAuschwitz and he was a psychologist who\nwas in these prison camps and he said\nthe last of human freedoms is to choose\none's attitude in any given set of\ncircumstances to choose one's own way\nand there will always be choices to make\nso you can choose who you want to be\nbut you have to learn who you truly are\nso take a step back\nout of your life out of being reactive\nall the time and ask yourself like who\nis your authentic self are you the same\nperson in front of everyone\nor are you different in front of your\nfriends and different in front of your\nparents and different on stage and\ndifferent at work because if you're\ndifferent people depending on the\ncircumstance\nyou don't even really know who you truly\nare and I believe that once you find\nyour true self you'll be the same person\nin front of everyone because it's it's\nmore important for you to be that true\nself than it is for other people to\naccept you you have to realize that you\ncan either fit in the box of what\nSociety tells you to be\nor we can have the courage to step out\nand be ourselves\nas long as we're not hurting anybody\nelse like you'll never see me go out and\nand cuss at somebody and make somebody\nfeel bad that's not what I'm trying to\ndo I'm just trying to express freely who\nI am and as long as you're not hurting\nanybody else with who your true self is\nwhat's the problem with stepping into\nthat version of yourself now will\neverybody enjoy it will you be every\nsingle person's cup of tea absolutely\nnot\nbut it's not your problem if somebody\ndoesn't like your authentic self\nI knew when I first started cussing in\nmy podcast and I made that switch that\npeople wouldn't like it because people\nare programmed not to like it I knew I\nwould get messages I knew I would get\nbad reviews I have bad reviews so like I\nlove this podcast but I'm gonna give\nthem one star because he cusses I'm like\nwell\njust listen to somebody else instead of\ngiving me a bad review right which is is\nwhy I think that people really need to\nstep into who they truly are and if it\noffends somebody\nso be it\nyou know if you want someone to to hold\nyour hair and you know brush your hand\nand say oh sweetie it's okay well then\nI'm not your guy and that's all right\nthere there is somebody else out there\nthat is your cup of tea and I'm okay\nwith not being everyone's guy you know\nthere's there's some other guy or some\nother girl that's that's better for\nsomebody and really what it comes down\nto is once again\nwhen we know who we truly are and we can\nstep into that authentic self it makes\nit easier for us to be okay with not\neverybody enjoying us but when we're not\neveryone's cup of tea or people don't we\ndon't know who we truly are and then\nsomebody doesn't accept us it really is\nhard for us and the reason why is\nbecause we don't know who we truly are\nso we're looking for other people's\nacceptance\nbut you're not gonna be everyone's cup\nof team that's okay we want to fit in\nand that's programmed into us\nbut why would you want to why would you\nreally want to truly fit in like you\nwere born to stand out like Jim Carrey\nsays your need for acceptance will make\nyou invisible in this world embrace your\nindividuality how boring is it to be\nlike someone else\nyou know your fingerprint is one and\nbillions there's no other person who has\nthe same fingerprints as you your eyes\nthere's no other person who has the same\neyes as you you are 100 original\nno other person in the world's built\nlike you not everyone will love you\nbut there's actually studies that show\nthat when you step into your true\nauthentic self you will be happier\nthere's a couple of them I actually tell\nthem to you there's a psychological\nstudy that's called authenticity and\nsubjective well-being that found that\npeople who reported higher levels of\nauthenticity that felt they were more\nauthentic also reported higher levels of\nsubjective well-being\nthey felt better another study called\nAuthentic Living in in physical health\nso Authentic Living and physical health\nif you want to look it up found that\npeople who are more authentic were more\nlikely to engage in healthier behaviors\nlike regular exercise and having a more\nbalanced diet one of the reasons why\nthey think this is is because they\ndidn't feel the need to numb themselves\nthrough food and alcohol because we're\nnot living your true self you\nsubconsciously know it and so a lot of\npeople will numb through food through\nalcohol through scrolling on Instagram\nall damn day all of that in other\nstudies there's been a lot of studies in\nauthenticity and health that have found\nthat the more authentically somebody\nlives the less likely they are to have\ndepression and anxiety\nthey hypothesize the reason for that is\nbecause they're living authentically\nwill actually contribute to those people\nliving longer because they don't have\nthis internal Battle of who am I\nsupposed to be here who am I supposed to\nbe here who am I supposed to be here and\nso overall it promotes better well-being\nand these are long studies but they're\nactually hypothesizing the people who\nlive more authentically will actually\nlive longer\nso who are you\nwho is your true authentic self\nwhat do you want in this life what are\nyour goals hopes dreams desires and\nwhere are you being somebody different\nfor every single other person\ngo on the Journey of self-discovery find\nout who you truly are step into that\nauthentic self and I promise you you\nwill enjoy life a whole lot more so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Junior Rob i a l j\nr and I'm Gonna Leave the same way leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission make somebody else's day better\nI appreciate you and I hope that you\nhave an amazing
