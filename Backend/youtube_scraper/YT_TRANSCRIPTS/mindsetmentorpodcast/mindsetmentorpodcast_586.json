    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout the seven steps to hit any goal\nnow if you've been listening to my\npodcast long enough you've heard me do\nversions of something like this in the\npast but I just realized this episode is\ngoing to be coming out six months into\nthe year which means we have another six\nmonths till the end of this year which\nis kind of Bonkers that I can't believe\nwe're halfway through this year but\nreally what it comes down to is now that\nwe're six months into the year\nwhat happened the first six months like\nif we think of our New Year's\nresolutions our goals for this year of\n2023 how are we pacing towards them most\nof the time I find that most people are\nbehind pace of their goals and a lot of\ntimes is because they didn't set their\ngoals correctly they're then they're not\nexecuting them properly because of that\nso\nI'm gonna give you my seven steps to\nactually hit any goal it's very simple\nand I've been using this for 13 years I\nactually got the first six steps from\nthe book Think and Grow Rich and I've\nhonestly never found anything better to\ntry to achieve your goals with so uh\nthere's then there's a seventh step to\nhit your goal that I like to use as well\nand so let's dive into it let's think\nabout real quick before we dive into the\nseven steps let's look back and look\nforward this is a process I love to do\nis I do it every single week I look back\non how last week went and I look forward\non what's coming up this week well now\nthat we're halfway through the goal\nlet's look back\non this year so far\nand see what do we do well what do we\nneed to improve on all that and then\nlet's look forward and make some\nadjustments and the way that you want to\nlook back and look forward is to go\nthrough this process it's called stop\nstart continue so you look back in the\npast six months and you ask yourself and\nyou write this down so if you have pen\nand paper please do this and you can\npause me I'll be here forever and you\ncan unpause me whenever you want to but\nyou look back and you go through stop\nstart continues so over the course of\n2023 what do I need to stop doing\nmaybe like well you know I didn't stop\ndoing it and stop sleeping in\nmaybe that's one of the things you stop\nis doing okay you need to stop sleeping\nand what else do you need to stop doing\nyou need to stop eating potato chips\nlate at night I don't know what it is\nright what do you need to stop doing you\nlook back and figure out what do you\nneed to stop doing\nthen you say what do I need to start\ndoing so going into the next six months\nso we have what we're going to start\ndoing you know what I need to do they'll\nprobably make it easier for me to stop\ngoing waking up so late stop going to\nbed so late maybe I need to start going\nto bed an hour earlier I need to stop\nwatching Netflix I need to turn my phone\noff at this time maybe you need to have\na uh a program on your computer so that\nat this time your computer doesn't allow\nyou to access Netflix or to go and work\nor do any of that type of stuff what do\nyou need to stop doing what do you need\nto start doing and then what do you need\nto continue doing also looking back like\nwhat have you done well so far this year\nthat you need to continue doing so you\nlook back look forward and you go\nthrough stop start continue when you\nstop doing when you start doing what I\nneed to continue doing that's the first\nstep to this because what we want to do\nis we want to take what's been working\nwhat's not been working make the\nadjustments that we need to and now we\nneed to start planning the rest of this\nyear okay\nhere's the six steps plus the seventh\nstep on how to achieve and hit any goal\nnumber one is you want to fixate your\nmind on exactly what it is that you want\nand what do I mean by fixate your mind\nyou need to get very very clear on\nexactly what it is that you want most\npeople are like well I want to make more\nmoney I want to lose some weight that\nsucks if I'm being honest you have to\nbecome very clear how much money do you\nwant to make\nhow much weight do you want to lose yet\nbecome very very clear so instead of\nsaying like I want to lose some weight\nwell if you lose one pound over the next\nsix months then you hit your goal no I\nwant to lose 10 pounds I want to weigh\n185 pounds and I want to be a seven\npercent body fat\nto me that sounds like you're much more\nclear on ways that you want and the more\nclear that you are on exactly what it is\nthat you want the more likely you are to\nseed it and you are to hit it\nmakes sense doesn't it it's like if you\nand I are you know at a shooting range\nand you have on you know I have on\nglasses that are not the correct\nprescription for me and I'm trying to\nhit something 100 yards away I'm looking\nat something 100 yards away and it's\nvery unclear\ndo I have a better chance of hitting it\nor you if you have the perfect\nprescription for your eyes you do why\nbecause you can see it better\nso the more that you can get more clear\non your goals you can see it better\nyou're more likely to hit it and so when\nyou write your goals down you got to be\nbecome very very clear and just ask\nyourself write your goal down figure out\nwhat it is and then say can I get more\nclear than what I currently have\nso that's step number one get really\nreally clear on what you want to do for\nthe rest of this year the next six\nmonths what do you want the next six\nmonths to look like okay the second\nthing and this is my favorite one is to\ndetermine exactly what you intend to\ngive up\nin order to achieve that goal like most\nof the time we think about what we need\nto do in order to hit goals but we never\nthink about what we need to give up in\norder to hit those goals and really what\nit comes down to is when you're saying\nyes to something you're also saying no\nto something else so when you're saying\nyes to losing weight you're going to\nhave to say no to a lot of that\nyou've been saying yes to for a long\ntime when you say yes to something\nyou're saying no to something else so\nwhen you're saying yes to losing those\n10 pounds over the next six months you\nmight have to once again say no to\neating potato chips late at night hey\nyou probably should say no to potato\nchips period because they're not helping\nyou so maybe you start saying no to\nthat you start saying no to sleeping in\nyou need to figure out exactly what you\nintend to give up in order to hit that\nyou might have to say no to sweets you\nmight have to say no to having a\nsix-pack on the weekends figure out what\nyou intend to give up in order to\nachieve it the fact that a lot of people\nthat I've found when they're setting\ngoals think that they could just hit\ntheir goals and not have to change a lot\nof things their life is crazy in order\nfor you to hit your goals you're going\nto have to change things and if you're\nnot willing to change things you're also\nnot willing to hit your goals and so\nthat's really what it comes down to so\nyou have to determine okay if I want to\nlose these 10 pounds if I want to weigh\n185 I want to get to seven percent body\nfat I need to give up x y and z\nso determine what you're willing to give\nup number three is you have to figure\nout a date that you're going to hit it\nby so if it's by the end of this year\nthen it would be 12 31 23 right\nestablish a definite date that you're\ngoing to hit it by of when you're going\nto hit this goal because a goal without\na deadline\nit's just simply a dream\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a really big favor down below hit\nthat like button and then if you have\nother topics you want me to cover in\nfuture episodes just commented down\nbelow so I can see what you guys want me\nto talk about if you have a goal and you\ndon't put a deadline to it it's a dream\nand to be honest with you if you don't\nput a deadline to it there's really no\nreason to start working harder at it\nit's the same way of like you know what\nmakes life so amazing death that's what\nmakes it so amazing you might be like\nwell that scares the out of me well\nthe thing that gives your life purpose\nthat gives your life meaning and it\ngives your life urgency\nis knowing that one day you will die\nright so it's like we need a definite\ndate that we're going to hit it by so\nthen it gives us a reason to work harder\nfor that goal so I'm going to hit that\ngoal by let's just say 12 31 23. so you\nhave to figure out the exact date okay\nand now what you need to do step four so\nstep three is to create a plan for how\nyou're going to hit that goal and you\nneed to start immediately you have to\nstart immediately so you create a plan\nokay my goal you know is as we said lose\n10 pounds weigh 185 be uh seven percent\nbody fat okay you got to give up what\nyou're gonna figure out what you're\ngoing to give up you've got the date but\nnow you actually got to come up with a\nplan so you know figure it out okay I'm\ngonna do my meal prepping every single\nSunday I'm gonna meal prep for the\nentire week I'm gonna start to weigh\nsome stuff out I'm gonna make sure that\nI have my breakfast lunch and dinner\nplanned out I'm gonna have my snacks\nplanned out I'm gonna plan out every\nsingle Sunday not only my food but I'm\nalso going to plan out my exact workout\nplan I'm going to work out Monday\nWednesday Friday and I'm going to do\nthis workout on Monday this workout on\nWednesday this workout on Friday and I'm\ngoing to run\nyou know two miles every Saturday and\nevery Sunday I don't know what it is but\nyou have to come up with the actual plan\nit's wild to me how many people set\ngoals and then come up with no plan\nthat's like getting in your car and\nbeing like well I want to drive to\nHouston and then just driving\nlike no no GPS no Compass just if I\ndrive long enough eventually I'll end up\nin Houston no it doesn't work that way\nlike you've got to come up with a plan\nsame way that your GPS needs to know you\nknow a couple different things it needs\nto know two things really where you are\nand where you want to go and then it\ncreates the plan from there well you\nknow where you are now we've what we've\nbeen talking about so far is you know\nwhere you want to go well now let's\ncreate the actual route knowing that\nthere will be adjustments made knowing\nthat there may be a detour needed at\nsome point in time\ncome up with a plan of how you're going\nto hit your goals so that's number four\nnumber five and this is a very very\nimportant piece that a lot of people\ndon't do is you need to write a clear\nand concise statement\nfor exactly what you want when you're\ngoing to get it by what you're going to\ngive up and how you're going to get\nthere and so you take number one number\ntwo number three and number four and you\ncondense it all into a four to five\nsentence statement like a mission\nstatement\nand you write it out and it's clear and\nconcise\nedit it make it perfect five sentences\nMax it's got to be clear it's got to be\nconcise for exactly what it is that you\nwant when you're going to hit it by what\nyou're going to give up and then also\nwhat you're going to do to get there so\nit would say something like I\nRob dial am going to lose 10 pounds by\nDecember 31st 2023 I'm going to weigh 10\nI'm gonna have seven percent body fat\nI'm gonna weigh 185 pounds and here is a\nprintout of the picture of the person\nwho has the body that I want\nthe way that I'm going to hit this goal\nis XYZ the way that I'm going to hit\nthis goal is I'm going to give up\nsleeping in I'm going to give up Netflix\nlate at night I'm going to give up\nalcohol for the next six months I'm\ngoing to stop eating snacks and buying\nsnacks for the house and I'm going to\ngive up whatever else you want to give\nup you know you're going to give up\npartying with my friends every single\nweek and maybe I do it once a month\ncome up with that okay you got that how\nI'm going to do it is this and you start\nsaying your plan I'm going to do it by\ndoing meal prep every single Sunday I'm\ngoing to make sure that I eat x amount\nof calories every single day I'm gonna\nhave breakfast lunch and dinner done so\nall I have to do is put inside of my bag\nand take it with me to work I'm going to\nmake sure that I work out Monday\nWednesday and Friday on Monday I'm going\nto do this day and Wednesday I'm going\nto do this day and one Friday I'm going\nto do this day and on Saturday I'm going\nto do two miles and on Sunday I'm going\nto run two miles\nnow you've got your clear and concise\nstatement maximum of five sentences\nwe're pretty we're pretty far along the\nline now aren't we do you feel like\nyou're much more clear in your goal yes\nyou get much more clear and you get much\nmore clear you get much more clear the\nmore clear it is the more that you can\nsee it the more that you can track it\nthe more likely you are to hit it and\nthen number six\nis to take that statement and to read it\nout loud to yourself twice a day every\nsingle morning and every single evening\nnow\nwhy do you want to read out loud\nyourself because one of the things that\nI've found with people of why they don't\nhit their goals besides lack of clarity\nlack of planning all that stuff is they\nsimply just forget about it like if I go\nto 50 of the people who listens podcasts\nand be like hey what was your New Year's\nresolution you're gonna be like um\nwell I think it and a lot of people\nactually forget what their New Year's\nresolution was so if you read it to\nyourself every single morning and every\nsingle evening you're not going to\nforget what it is but you're also going\nto basically set your sights on what it\nis that you're trying to achieve every\nsingle day\nthe way that I like to do this is to\nrecommend something called habit\nstacking habit stacking means that you\ndo something that you're already doing\nthat is a habit and you stack your new\nhabit on top of it and so an example of\nwhat this will look like is hopefully\nyou're brushing your teeth every single\nmorning and every single evening but as\nsoon as you get done brushing your teeth\nsince it's already staple it's already\nsomething that you do that's a habit you\nstack a new habit with it so as soon as\nyou get done brushing your teeth you\nwash out your mouth you put your\ntoothbrush down you pick up your mission\nstatement and you read it out loud to\nyourself then you go on about your day\nthen in the evening you brush your teeth\nwhen you get done with it you wash your\nmouth out you take your mission\nstatement and you read it out loud to\nyourself again right when you get done\nso you're constantly constantly\nconstantly reminding yourself of it so\nthat's the six steps that they give you\nuh in the uh the book Think and Grow\nRich now number seven which is the one\nthat I like every time I used to have\none-on-one coaching clients we would set\ngoals and then I would ask this question\nand I think this is a very important\nquestion how can you make it easier on\nyourself\nnow that you've got the plan you've got\neverything that you want how can you\nmake it easier on yourself and the\nreason why I like to ask this question\nis because a lot of times I have found\nmyself in this position many times is we\nthink that in order to be successful we\nhave to struggle our way to success like\nsuccess has to be hard it has to be you\nknow putting our head down and just\nbashing it into a wall and bashing it we\nhave to struggle our way to success what\nI have found is it doesn't have to be\nthat way if we think we're going to\nstruggle to success we will definitely\nstruggle the success there's no doubt\nabout it but if we think we can make\nthis easier on ourselves how can I make\nthis easier on ourselves myself and keep\nasking ourselves that over and over and\nover again\nwe started looking at our goals we start\nshifting it to make it easier how can I\nmake it easier to wake up early\ngo to bed earlier how can I make it\neasier to plan out my my meal plan\nmaybe you hire somebody to do your meal\nplanning for you maybe you get one of\nthose meal services and they send them\nall to you and they scale it all out and\nyou can afford to do that whatever it is\nhow can you take your goals and make\nthem easier you don't have to struggle\nyour way to success it doesn't have to\nbe hard all of the time\njust make it a little bit easier on self\nand so you go through these six\ndifferent steps add the seventh one how\nyou can make it easier so step number\none figure out exactly what it is that\nyou want to get very very clear step\nnumber two figure out exactly what\nyou're willing to give up in order to\nhit your goal number three figure out a\ndefinite date you're gonna hit it by\nnumber four come up with a plan very\nclear plan of exactly how you're going\nto do it number five write a clear and\nconcise statement that you're going to\nhave that summarize number one two three\nand four number six you read that\nstatement out loud to yourself every\nsingle morning and every single evening\nand then step number seven constantly\nkeep asking yourself how can I make it\neasier to hit this goal\nso that's what I got for you for this\nepisode now you know what you need to do\nto hit your remaining of the Year goals\nfor the next six months take this\nepisode put some stuff on paper start to\nwork
