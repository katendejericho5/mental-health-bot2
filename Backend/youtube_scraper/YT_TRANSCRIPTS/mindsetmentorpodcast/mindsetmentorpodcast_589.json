    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to be talking about\nhow to have more gratitude and I'm\nhonestly just going to talk to you about\nhow amazing life is in this\nHuman Experience is and my goal for\ntoday's episode is to reframe your\nmindset in some way to help you have\nmore gratitude today now\num a piece of what I'm saying where I\nsay everything's amazing I when I say\nit's amazing I don't mean that it's\nperfect I don't mean that there's not\nsome hitting the walls I don't mean\nthat there's not stuff going down all\nthe time and that there's you know\ninjustices across the world there always\nhas been there probably always will be\nbut it doesn't mean that we can't seem\nto find gratitude no matter what's\nhappening around us for every single\nmoment that we have if we have people\nand you can read about people like\nNelson Mandela who can be locked up for\nas long as he was and still be a\ngrateful person if you can hear about\npeople who live through some of the\ncrazy stuff with the Nazis and they can\nstill find a way to be grateful it's\nlike man I can still find a way to be\ngrateful for what's going on in my life\nright\num in in really what it comes down to is\nwe can start a\nstart a system of gratitude and when we\ncan be more grateful for what we do have\nbecause if you're listening this podcast\nyou have a lot more than the average\nperson like a lot more than the average\nperson but a lot of times what do we\ntend to do we tend to think about what\nwe don't have versus what we do have\nwhat we can be grateful for when we can\nstart from a place of feeling grateful\nfor what we have grateful for our lives\nwe can serve the world better than if\nwe're like oh I don't have what I want\nI'm not good enough oh my life isn't\nwhere I want it to be but my bank\naccount isn't what I want it to be in my\njobs not what I wanted to be in my\nrelationship isn't what I want it to be\nlike I understand you can have that\nmindset if you want that's fully your\nprerogative or you can say you know what\nI'm going to look around me and I'm\ngoing to search for things to be\ngrateful for and what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to focus on those things that\nI can be grateful for because if I can\nbe grateful for the little things\nthen I can show up better I can serve\nthe world better I can be a better human\nand what you focus on expands maybe if I\nfocus on these little tiny things that\nI'm grateful for just maybe the universe\nwill give you more things to be grateful\nfor and I remember watching a comedian\nlike 10 years ago and he was talking\nabout how everything is amazing and\nnobody's happy like if you really take a\nstep back it's like damn stuff is\namazing and he was talking about how he\nwas on his first flight with Wi-Fi on a\nplane and it was like one of the first\nflights and Wi-Fi was on it and everyone\nwas all excited oh my gosh we get to go\non one of the first flights with Wi-Fi\nand then in the flight the Wi-Fi stops\nworking and the guy next to him was like\nthis is and he's he was talking\nabout how he was joking about the fact\nthat the guy was mad about something\nthat he didn't know existed 20 minutes\nago and it's like how often does that\nhappen where it's like we have this\namazing thing that's going on\nWi-Fi in a plane and then when it stops\nworking the very first time it's like oh\nwell this is and it it's it's\nridiculous because if you really start\nto think about it\neveryone on the plane should be like oh\nmy God this is the most amazing thing in\nthe world like you're literally in a\nchair in the sky you know at third\nyou're in a chair at 30 000 feet going\n600 miles an hour\nin basically like a a Coca-Cola can\nright\nthat's amazing like every time that I\ntake off and if you've been listening\npodcasts for all you know I've been in\nFlight Training and getting my my pilot\nlicense everything like that every time\nI'm in a plane and it takes off the\nright when the wheels get off I'm out\nthe first thought in my mind is holy\n this is crazy\nlike it's amazing if you really start to\nthink about it right like how amazing\nthis thing is like you have 250 people\nflying at 600 miles an hour because of\ntwo fans that are going really fast like\nit's pretty amazing and you know to go\nfrom New York to LA is like five to six\nhours that used to take 30 years and a\nbunch of people would die on the way\nright like I I was watching um the show\n1883 and it's about you know going on\nthe Oregon Trail\nand it really starts to put your life\ninto perspective of like what's some of\nour ancestors had to go through years\nago uh like my ancestors weren't in\nAmerica\nthey all came over from Ireland but\neverybody in the 1800s the 1700s lived\nyou know pretty similar lives as far as\nlike what they had what they didn't have\nwhat they had access to it they didn't\nhave access to and you really look at it\nit's like\nit's amazing that you could literally\njust hop in a plane go at 30 000 feet\ntravel 600 miles an hour and go from LA\nto New York in five hours\nand you know like if you really start to\nthink about it's like man that's a\npretty amazing thing and then you think\nabout how miserable people are an\nairplane airports it's like\nit's like the worst thing in the it's\nlike the worst part of their day there's\ntraveling for seven hours is the worst\npart of their day right and it's like\nthat used to take 30 years and most of\nthe people would be dead by the time you\ngot there and then some people would\nhave babies and so you would show up\nat a location 30 years later with a\ncompletely different group of people\nthan what started with you and so it's\nlike man so many people are miserable\nwhen they have to go to a on an airplane\nand go into an airport there's so many\npeople are miserable in their airports\nthat's like they don't actually even\ntake a step back to think about how\namazing this is\ntake another thing for instance like\nyour phone\nthink about how amazing your phone is\nright like I\ncame from a time where I didn't have a\ncell phone until I was 17 years old and\nso like I remember life before everybody\nhaving cell phones and I remember when\nit was literally like my dad had one\nwhen I was a kid that was like in the\ncar like the cell phone was built into\nthe car and it never worked ever it like\nkind of worked in and out and then it\nwould just like stop working but like if\nyou look at your phone for instance like\nthe thing that's in your pocket\nit has a camera like if you think of all\nof the things that used to be required\nfor your phone\nuh it's like a ton of different things\nso I put a list of them together ready\nit took the place of a camera\nit took the place of a Camcorder for\nthose of you guys that are old enough\nremember that cameras and camcorders are\ntwo different things back in the day\ntook the place of a radio\nI haven't used the radio in years I use\nSpotify took the place of CDs took the\nplace of books took the place of\ncalculator it took the place of a voice\nrecorder took the place of a GPS so yes\nremember there used to be times when you\nused to have an actual separate GPS a\nunit in your car\nhey beautiful person if you're loving\nthis podcast episode please do me a real\nquick favor give us a like down below\nand then if you have anything that you\nwant me to do in future episodes go\nahead and comment it down below I always\ncheck the comments to see what you guys\nwant me to talk about so if you give us\na like and a comment I'd greatly greatly\nappreciate it I remember one of my first\njobs I had to have a satellite GPS so I\ncould get around and you know travel and\nmake some sales takes place of a\nflashlight takes the place of a leveler\ntakes a place of a scanner like the\nother day I had to scan something and\nsend it and I literally just use my\nphone for it there's a part of me that\nwas like do I have to drive to FedEx to\ndo this no I just do it for my phone\ntakes a place of a compass takes the\ngame of place of a video game console\nit can take the place of a credit card\nnow can you take the place of an alarm\nclock take the place of a stopwatch take\nthe place of a timer take the place of a\ncalculator take a place of a calendar\ntake a place of a notepad take a place\nof a photo album take a play I was\nwatching a video yesterday and there was\nthere were people on YouTube talking\nabout this guy who had a picture and\nthey're like what is with this picture\nlike why that's kind of odd that he\nwould just have this picture out and\nthey're like oh well I guess when this\nwas recorded the only way you could see\npictures is by printing them out and\nyou're like oh damn there was a time\nwhen you only time you could see\npictures was when they were printed out\nit takes a place of new piece of paper\ntakes a place like for me like I have a\nguitar tuner on mine so when I'm playing\nwhen I want to play guitar okay specific\nguitar player takes place for remote\ncontrol you can control your TV from it\ntakes a place of you know one of my cars\ncar keys where you can just get in with\nthe car and it starts working\nand it's crazy and all of the knowledge\nthat mankind has ever known you can\naccess through your phone by using\nGoogle and the internet\nIt's amazing\nit's the most incredible piece of\ntechnology that's ever been created when\npeople always say it's the best thing\nsince sliced bread people should now say\nit's the best thing since a cell phone\nbecause it's so incredible\nbut how much do we just forget about how\namazing things are\nyou know people say oh my gosh but\nphones are so still addicting they're so\naddicting and there's something wrong\nwith them well you know if you're\naddicted to yourself when you're letting\nyourself be addicted to your cell phone\nit's a really great servant it's a\nterrible master and you have to decide\nhow and when you want to use it really\nwhat I'm trying to get to though is do\nyou often take yourself out of your own\nhead look around and go wow\nthis is pretty amazing\nthis is this is an amazing thing that's\ngoing on right now like for me I'm in\nthe studio right now I'm going to be\nfully transparent it's 84 degrees in\nhere because our air conditioning was\nbroken this morning we had to have the\nguy come and fix it he fixed it and I\ncould be pissed off about how it's 84\ndegrees right now and be like well this\nis I like it to be 72 it's 84\ndegrees I kind of got some sweat going\ndown my back as I'm recording this for\nyou guys and this is\nand you know I have a leather chair that\nI'm sitting on and I can feel the back\nof my knees are starting to sweat I\ncould be all pissed off about it and\nthere's always a reason to be pissed off\nif you want to be pissed off\nthere always is and you can find that\nreason or I could be like you know what\nit's 82 degrees in here it's 104 outside\nright now in Austin I'm pretty grateful\nthat I'm not outside right now 22\ndegrees hotter\nI can choose which one I want to focus\non there's always something to be pissed\noff about and there's always something\nto be grateful for but the best part\nabout it is you decide the filter you\ndecide what you want to focus on\nand you know like another thing\nthat just popped up into my head just\nthinking about the phone as well like we\nwere just in Italy not long ago\nand uh our security camera\nwe can check on the house when I'm in\nItaly you know I get Motion in my front\nyard in my backyard and I'm thousands\nand thousands of miles away and you know\nthere's a Amazon guy that came and\ndropped something off and I can talk to\nhim I can talk to the Amazon guy through\nmy security camera\nthousands and thousands and thousands of\nmiles away and tell him where to leave a\npackage the hidden place he can leave a\npackage\nthat's crazy and then when my friends\ncome over because they want to take the\npackage and put it inside I can unlock\nthe door from my phone thousands like\nit's\nBonkers how amazing stuff is nowadays or\nyou could be like I just want to be\npissed off right text messages for\ninstance text messages think about that\nfor a second my grandparents like\nI could be in Italy and I could send a\ntext message to my best friend here in\nAustin and they get it he gets it\nimmediately my grandparents my grandpa's\nin World War II they met and then my\ngrandpa had to go to war and they used\nto write letters to each other like my\nmy grandmother would write a letter to\nmy grandfather responding to his letter\nthat he got or that he had sent months\nbefore and she's writing him a letter\nnot knowing if the person that she's\nwriting a letter to is number one going\nto receive it or number two if he's even\nstill alive\nnow you can just send a text message and\npeople immediately get it\nthink of your life\nif you really take yourself out of it\nand think about it\nit's amazing\nit might be great it might be good it\nmight be terrible right now but it's\nstill amazing and if you're listening to\nright now your quality of life is a\nhundred times better than a king 500\nyears ago I say this all the time\nbecause I really want to put your life\ninto perspective if you were a king 500\nyears ago\nwith the best possible life that you\ncould have a King's life 500 years ago\nis not as good as your life today\nthat's a pretty crazy thing to think\nabout isn't it\nyou know we have food Water Shelter\nclothing hopefully a couple people that\nlove us\nand we're over here like but I but I\nwant more I want faster internet so I\ncould watch YouTube in 4k right like\nthink about how much and mind you I'm\nnot making fun of you I'm making fun of\nus because we do this and there's times\nwhen I'm like oh the TV is not\nworking and I'm like screw you rob like\nI'm thinking of somebody I'm like screw\nyou who cares it's not a big deal your\nlife is amazing\nright and and\nthe way they like to think about it is\nthat you're very rarely going to be\ngiven more than you currently have if\nyou can't be grateful for what you\ncurrently have\nthink about that for a second you will\nvery rarely be given more than what you\nhave right now if you can't find a way\nto be grateful for what you have\nI don't believe that God the universe\nwhatever is that you want to believe in\nlikes to reward if you can be honest\nwith you I don't think that the god of\nthe universe likes to reward little\n right if I'm sitting around\nbeing a little and I'm landing and\ncomplaining why would why would I ever\nbe gift with more it's like a child that\nconstantly complains\nif a child just complains oh this toy\nsucks this this sucks I'm mad I'm pissed\nall this stuff why would you give a\nanother toy to a kid same kid no\nright you we won't be given more until\nwe become really great stewards for what\nwe already have\nand so for you you have to realize in\nfor myself included because every\npodcast I make is made for you but also\nfor myself what we focus on will receive\nmore of\nand so we need to focus on what we have\nwhat we can be grateful for\nif you choose to focus on what you don't\nhave\nif you choose to always look at the\nnegative if you choose to always try to\nfind problems you will get more problems\nyou will find if you're searching for\nproblems in your life they're everywhere\nno matter how amazing life is there's\nalways problems but if you focus on what\nyou're grateful for you will find more\nthings to be grateful for and I don't\nknow about you I would much rather live\nin a state of gratitude\nthan a state of problems\nthe beautiful thing is about all of that\nis that you and I are able to make the\ndecision of which one we want to focus\non\nit's completely up to us\nnot to be able to think about life so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me
