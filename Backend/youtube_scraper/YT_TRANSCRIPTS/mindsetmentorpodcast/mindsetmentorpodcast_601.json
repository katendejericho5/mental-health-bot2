    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial tonight we're going to be talking\nabout five tips to help you with your\nanxiety\num I feel like I talk a decent amount\nabout anxiety and the reason why is\nbecause I think that it's important\nright now I was reading a statistic\nearlier this week\nand they think that from what they're\nseeing is that about two to three times\nmore people have anxiety than they did\n10 years ago\nreally start to think about that for a\nsecond does that sound like we're going\nin a good direction not really and so\nreally what it comes down to is number\none why like what is it is the reason\nwhy two to three times more people have\nanxiety than 10 years ago so that's the\nfirst thing we need to think about is\nlike why is it more prevalent than ever\nhas been and number two if we do feel\nanxious and when I say anxiety you can\nalso have anxious thoughts I think it's\nactually quite human to have anxious\nthoughts that come in and so it's not\nlike I'm not talking about like\ncrippling anxiety or panic attacks every\nsingle day but I'm talking about there's\na little bit of like an underlying\nstress there's a little bit of\nunderlying anxiousness anxiety that can\ncome in sometimes sometimes it's here\nsomeday sometimes it's not and so really\nwhat it comes down to is how do we\nprevent it\nand then also how do we get through it\nwhen it's also there and so really\nthat's what I want to dive into you guys\nwith today is just five simple tips\nthat'll help you\num you're not going to like all of them\nuh especially probably not number two or\nnumber actually probably number three\nmore than anything else but we'll dive\ninto it and uh give it a shot if you\nfeel like you've had more anxiety\nrecently maybe in the last year or two\nyears than than you did in the past\ntry this out for 30 days see how these\nfive tips help you and work through your\ndaily process and everything give it a\nshot if it doesn't work\nhey it doesn't work but I it's gonna\nwork I'm just going to be honest with\nyou so so let's dive into it tip number\none\ndon't look at your phone for at least an\nhour after you wake up in an hour before\nyou go to bed put that thing\nsomewhere else right that the thing\nthat's in your pocket can be your main\nculprit for anxiety there's been a lot\nof studies that are starting to find\nthat that looking at your phone too much\nlooking at social media too much looking\nat this little tiny screen too much can\nactually be one of the reasons why\npeople have so much anxiety nowadays and\nat the same time they also are starting\nto notice that they're more besides\nanxious more tired throughout the day\nand that they're just stressed and\nthere's just a little bit more that's\nright there\nwhen we say looking at our phone of\ncourse some of you guys are looking at\nyour email you're looking at your text\nmessage you've got a lot to do at work\nand so you're you're constantly thinking\ninto the future\nanxiety is from constantly thinking into\nthe future another way that it's caused\nis by comparing yourself with other\npeople so if you're going on a social\nmedia if you're if you're immediately\ngoing to things the way that I use my\nphone I'll just be 100 honest with you\nready\nwe have this thing that's called Eight\nsleep eight sleep is a it we've talked\nabout the podcast before cools down the\nbed and then heats up the bed as I'm\nstarting to wake up and that's actually\nwhat wakes me up it has this thing where\nit vibrates under my like my back it\nvibrates and I have to turn the\nvibration off the only way to turn the\nvibration off is through my phone and so\nwhat I do is I turn off the vibration on\nmy phone and then I turn off the alarm\nin our house on my phone the ring and\nthen I don't look at my phone for at\nleast an hour after that reason why is\nbecause I have personally found someone\nwho's been working on himself for 17\nyears working on my mindset that if I\nlook at my phone throughout the day I\nbecome way more anxious I do and I've\nbeen working myself for a long time I've\nbeen meditating since what 2009 so 14 14\nyears at this point I've been meditating\nI've done 10-day silent meditation\nRetreats and when I look at my\nphone in the morning I am so stressed\nout for the rest of the day\nso trust me put your phone somewhere\nelse I would recommend you have a\nspecific drawer for it I have a specific\ndrawer in my phone where I might\nassuming a specific drawer in my kitchen\nwhere I keep my phone and when I need it\nI walk to it when I'm done with it I put\nit back and I go on about my life and so\nif you could get your phone away from\nyou for the first hour of waking up\nand an hour before you go to bed those\nare the two times where you're the most\nimpressionable and your subconscious is\nactually the most turned on so if you\ncan make sure that you try to keep your\nphone away from you\ngive yourself those two hours look at do\nwhatever it is you got to do throughout\nthe rest of the day try to distance\nyourself as much from your phone as you\npossibly can but at least give yourself\nan hour after you wake up an hour before\nyou go to bed that's tip number one\nnumber two please for your own anxiety's\nsake but also just your your body's sake\ndon't eat any food that comes in a box\nlike just stop eating processed foods\nreason why is because processed foods\nare really high in sugar most of the\ntime they're usually high in\npreservatives and they're usually high\nin food coloring and so all of these can\ncause massive spikes and drops in your\nglucose levels so when you have sugar\nyou get a massive spike in your glucose\nand then it drops considerably and that\nfeeling of the drop actually for me I\nfound as well makes me feel more anxious\nwhen my blood sugar feels low it makes\nme feel more anxious so I just have this\nrule I just don't need anything that\ncomes in a box or you know like a bag\nlike chips any of that type of stuff\nthat's it that's kind of what it is if\nit wasn't once alive I don't eat it and\nthat's really what it's come down to now\nthis isn't like every single moment of\nmy life of course I'll have you know on\nSaturday usually I'll go and I'll eat\nwhatever hell I want usually it's still\nnot processed foods but we'll go out to\na restaurant we'll do whatever as we\nneed to do might have a margarita on a\nSaturday but that just kind of gives you\nan idea also I didn't put it inside of\nthis video inside of this this episode\nbut try to stay away from alcohol if you\ncan as well there's a whole lot of stuff\nthat shows that alcohol helps with that\nanxiety helps create anxiety and that\nhelps relieve it makes you feel better\nin the moment but not long term\nso just simple tip just stay away from\nanything that comes inside of a box it's\ngot a lot of processed stuff in there\nit's got sugars it's got preservatives\nit's got food coloring Oz all of those\ncan help create anxiety inside of your\nbody and what we're trying to do is\nwe're trying to get away from the things\nthat cause that anxiety number three\nyou're gonna hate me I told you would\nstop drinking coffee for the next seven\ndays and see how you feel if you really\ndo have anxious feelings if you have\nstressed out feelings stop drinking\ncoffee for the next seven days\nokay just see how you feel okay I'm just\ntrust me in this one\nalthough few things in this world are\nbetter than a nice hot cup of coffee in\nthe morning caffeine can drastically\ninduce anxiety symptoms\nand or make them worse\nso if you have a lot of anxiety but you\nalso love coffee\ndon't you think you could just give it\nup for seven days like you could do\nanything for seven days\nwhat if you just decided over the next\nseven days I'm just going to be\ncompletely away from caffeine and just\nsee if it helps you with your symptoms\nand I promise you you'll notice a big\ndifference now after those seven days\nyou want to make sure that you stay away\nfrom coffee caffeine for the first 90\nminutes of waking up so seven days\nyou're gonna take completely off right\nand then what you're going to do is\nyou're gonna have at least 90 minutes\nfrom waking up in the morning I know I\nget it it's hard I've done this before I\nfreaking love coffee and others like I\nsaid a few things better than a hot cup\nof coffee in the morning\nbut you have to trust me on this your\nfirst 90 minutes the reason why is\nbecause when you wake up in the morning\nyour cortisol which is your stress\nhormone is at its highest in the morning\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a big favor give us a like down\nbelow and then also at the same time if\nyou have any ideas for future topics\nyou'd like me to cover go ahead and\ncomment them down below I love to look\nat them every single day and see if you\nguys have some ideas for extra episodes\nso if you have coffee within the first\n90 minutes you have cortisol stress\nhormone in your body and you're actually\nhaving more\nanxious anxiety feelings a lot of times\nfrom having the caffeine as well and so\nwhat happens is it usually takes about\n90 minutes for your cortisol to drop\nwhat I would recommend is to go outside\nusually what I do is I go outside I take\nbear out before I do a quick meditation\nSun's usually starting to rise and I\nusually go out there I get as much sun\non my skin and I try to stay out there\nfor about five to ten minutes while he's\ndoing his business and my eyes actually\nstart to get the sunlight into them now\nI'm not saying that I look at the sun I\ndon't do that but my eyes are starting\nto get the sunlight into them that makes\nyour body stop releasing melatonin and\nit usually starts to you know get rid of\nthe cortisol as well and so if you\nreally want to help yourself with the\nStress and Anxiety you might be feeling\ndon't have coffee for seven days and\nthen when you have it again on day eight\ndon't have it for the first 90 minutes\nof waking up that way it allows your\ncortisol levels to go lower and then\ncaffeine actually works better for you\nafter your cortisol levels are lower\nthat's number three told you you'd hate\nme for it it's okay you can hate me for\nit as long as you just do it it'll make\nyour life better number four\nstart to practice mindfulness\nstart to practice mindfulness when\nyou're stressed out or when you're\nanxious it's usually anxiety is not\ncreated by being in the present moment\nanxiety is usually created from thoughts\nof the future of what could possibly\nhappen what you have coming down the\nline the things that you worry about\neverything is usually from the future\nyou're thinking too much in the future\nso when you're practicing mindfulness\nmindfulness just basically means being\npresent being here like in this moment\nand so there's a couple techniques I can\ngive you to help you really kind of get\nin the moment\nand one of the things is this\nyou could do a meditation sure but I\ndon't know about you when I do\nmeditations a lot of times my brain goes\nto another place so I have to bring have\ntechniques to bring my brain back here\nso what you could do you can try right\nnow if you want to as as you're you're\nlistening to this keep your eyes open\nespecially if you're driving and\nlistening to this and what I want you to\ndo is I want you to just feel\nwhatever you can feel like senses on\nyour body touch\nso like for me I can feel my t-shirt\nthat I'm wearing right now I can feel my\nseat uh my butt in the seat I can feel\nmy feet on the floor I'm not wearing\nshoes so I can feel the floor under me I\ncan feel the room I can feel the the air\nconditioning of the room and so I can I\ncan start to feel a lot of things\nfeeling is in the present moment this\nfeeling of me feeling my skin me feeling\nmy watch that's on my hand my wedding\nring on I can feel these things all of\nthese things are in the present moment\nfeel my clothing I feel everything I'm\ntrying to bring myself to present moment\nso feel is the first thing to think okay\nwhat do I see\nokay I see number one I see a lot of\nlights I'm surrounded by lights if you\nguys are watching this video I have a\nbunch of lights around me I have a\ncamera that's right in front of me I\nhave a camera right here that's moving\nautomatically from left to right on a\nmachine I have another one that's over\nto my left I uh I see the desits here I\nsee the microphone in front of me I see\na lot of different things think about\neverything that you can see around you\nokay because when you're seeing\nsomething once again seeing is in the\npresent moment\nokay now that we see as many things we\npossibly can you're going to go to here\nwhat do you hear okay I can hear my my\nvoice obviously as I'm speaking\nI can hear the air conditioning I can\nhear the hum of the computer off in the\ndistance we produce this stuff from\nI can hear I can hear bear behind me\nbreathing on the floor right\na little little tiny bit of a snore he\nhas because he's a little nine pound dog\nI can hear those things\nwhat do you smell start thinking about\nwhat you could smell you start to\nokay I could smell\nthe wooden desk that's that's right here\nthat everything is on top of so I can\nstart to smell these things so when you\nthink about this you try to bring in as\nmany scents as possible you could bring\nin taste if you want to right taste do\nyou taste anything I don't really taste\nanything at this point right now but\nwhen you think about what you can feel\nyou give yourself two minutes to think\nabout what you can feel you give\nyourself two minutes to think about what\nyou can see you give yourself two\nminutes to think about what you can hear\nyou give yourself two minutes to think\nabout what you can smell that's just\neight minutes right there\nyou can think about taste if you want to\nyou can taste the saliva in your mouth\nall that stuff\nyou could give yourself 30 seconds for\neach one of these and it would take two\nminutes to go through this but what\nyou're doing is you're bringing yourself\nback to the present moment\nyou can close your eyes if you want to\nyou can feel the skin you can hear the\nsound you can smell the smells what\nyou're trying to do is you're trying to\nbring yourself back to present moment\nbecause anxiety is almost always caused\nby thinking into the future worrying\nabout the future what if we could bring\nourselves back to this moment\nand then with everything that you do\nwith mindfulness you try to be more\npresent so if you're washing your hands\nafter going to the bathroom right like\npay attention to the way that the soap\nfeels pay attention to the way the warm\nwater feels when you're walking up the\nstairs and going upstairs in your house\npay attention to the way the carpet\nfeels on your feet these normal mundane\nthings where our brain is usually off\nsomewhere else try to bring it back to\nwhat you can feel what you can see what\nyou can smell what you can taste what\nyou can hear all of that because all of\nthose are in the present moment your\nbody is always in the present moment so\nthat's number four and then number five\nis just a tip that'll just help you\nwhenever you feel anxious if people list\nthis podcast on enough you know I love\nto talk about this it's six deep\nintentional breaths just close your eyes\nand you do in through the nose\nout through the mouth\nand when you breathe out it is a long\nexhale\nlike you're breathing out through a\nstraw you do this six times there was a\nJapanese study that was done a few years\nago where they found out that six deep\nintentional breaths can cause a massive\nState change for somebody especially\nsomeone that happens to be feeling\nanxious thoughts or stressed out\nthoughts so you breathe into the nose\nand then you try to do your exhale\nthrough like you're breathing out\nthrough a straw the longest it you\npossibly can the longer the exhale the\nmore it actually slows your heart rate\ndown and it releases more carbon dioxide\ncarbon more carbon dioxide out of your\nbody out of your blood it allows your\nmuscles to relax a little bit more and\nso those are the five tips that you\nreally want to go through number one\ndon't look at your phone for the first\nhour when you wake up an hour before you\ngo to bed number two don't eat anything\nthat comes in a box or a bag number\nthree stop drinking coffee for the next\nseven days number four try to be more\nmindful bring yourself to the present\nmoment your body is always in the\npresent moment and number five pay\nattention and do some deep deep\nbreathing so\ndo I got for you for today's episode if\nyou love this episode please share it on\nInstagram
