    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to feel more peace in your\nlife how to finally feel like you don't\nhave to keep doing more things but\nreally feel peace with where you are and\num now you might think before we dive\ninto that of like but hold on if I feel\ngood about where I am am I going to lose\nall my motivation in life like am I\ngoing to lose my am I not going to feel\nlike I want more and what I'll tell you\nthat's really interesting is number one\nI used to think that I used to always\nthink to myself like well if I if I'm if\nI'm content I'm just going to sit around\nand do nothing with my life nothing can\nbe further from the truth what happens\nis when you're content and when you're\nfulfilled\nyou actually start to do things that are\nmore from a place of trying to see\ntrying to trying to do more for the\nworld trying to be more for the world\ntrying to accomplish more not just for\nyourself but for the world and that ends\nup being a lot more uh motivating than\nworking just for money or just working\nfor yourself in in being\noh I'm gonna just because I want this I\nwant I want more things so I'm going to\ndo this and\num you know we live in a society\nI would say like a society of more we\nwant more all the time like too much is\nNever Enough like I remember watching a\nvideo not long ago Bob Marley was being\ninterviewed and he said the guy who's\ninterviewing said are you a rich man and\nhe said what do you mean by Rich he said\nwell do you have a lot of money and he\nsaid is money what makes you rich\nbecause money is just numbers and money\nnever stops numbers never stop so if you\njust are searching for money you'll\nnever be fulfilled because you'll never\nhave enough you can always have more and\nso we're raised in a society of of\nalways going for the next thing never\nslowing down never settling never being\nsatisfied with Where You Are\nbut if we live that way if we're taught\nthat we always need to achieve more to\nmake more money to buy more things to\nkeep up with the Joneses how could you\npossibly be at peace if you always want\nmore\nlike if there's always something that\nyou need in the future and you always\nwant more how could you possibly be at\npeace I don't think there's really any\nway to be at peace if you're constantly\nfeeling like there's another thing that\nyou need to have and in Buddhism they\nactually call this there's a phrase for\nit it's the hungry ghosts imagine a\nghost coming into your your kitchen and\nthey open up a refrigerator and they\ncome in and eat a bunch of food\nbut it doesn't have a stomach so what's\nit going to do it's just going to fall\non the floor so it's never going to fill\nits belly which means that it's always\ngoing to be hungry we live in a society\nwhere we always have to have the newest\nthing we have to have the newest iPhone\nwe have to have the newest\ncar we have to have the newest foam we\nhave to have the newest biggest house we\nhave to get more clothes our our\nneighbor bought a boat we have to buy a\nboat more toys for your children it's\nlike more more more more more more more\ntoo much is Never Enough and we live in\na society where it's kind of like a lot\nof us are hungry ghosts and I don't know\nabout you guys I've gotten to the point\nwhere I'm 37 years old\nand I don't feel like I need to buy\nthings just to buy them anymore I kind\nof buy things because I'm like well it'd\nbe nice to have it's not gonna make me\nfeel any different it's not going to\nmake me feel more whole but it would be\nfun so I'll get it right your neighbor\ngot a boat you need to get a bigger boat\nyou got a bigger boat than you you need\nto get bigger boat and we always think\nthat we have to keep up with the Jones\nit's like what if I just stop trying to\nbuy things to impress people or to feel\nlike I always needed more but maybe if I\nbought things that you know felt fun\ngave me more of experiences maybe I\nstopped buying actual physical things\nand maybe I started buying experiences\nsome trips doing stuff with people I\nlove\nso we always feel like we have to keep\nWith the Jones keep up with the gun\nJones keep up with the Joneses but have\nyou ever actually stopped to think about\nwhy like why do we always feel like we\nneed more why do we always feel like\nthere needs to be another thing that we\nbuy\nwhy is it that we always want more why\nis it that Society always wants more why\ncan't you just be happy with what you\nhave\nright think of all of the things I\nremember reading a book\nabout 15 years ago and it was it was\ntalking about think about everything\nyou've ever bought or anything you've\never owned and take all of those things\nand imagine in your mind everything that\nyou've ever bought everything you've\never owned everything in your junk\ndrawer every car every house every phone\nevery computer every book everything\nyou've ever owned and you put it into a\npile like everything you've ever owned\nis put it into a pile how big would that\npile be\nthink about that how big would the pile\nbe it'd be huge wouldn't it\nI don't know football field of just\nmaybe more\nall the things and you think about how\nmany things do you not have anymore that\nare on that field\nnow I don't want you to think that\nhaving nice things is bad that's not\nwhat I'm trying to say I used to\nstruggle with this where I used to just\nbe like you know what I'm I'm not gonna\nbuy anything I'm just going to be cheap\nas I possibly can be right and I\nremember I had a years ago I had a\nHyundai Santa Fe I had a 2007 Hyundai\nSanta Fe\nand I was I was with uh one of my\nmentors and we were talking about\ndriving and I was like yeah I've got\nthis old car I'm just waiting for it to\nto break down\nand\num Jordan's breakdown then I'll buy\nsomething new and he's like just low-key\ndoesn't even try to say anything to me\nabout it he's like yeah you know I've\njust found that\nyou know what I found that when I buy a\ncar\nthat I like and I enjoy driving it I\njust arrive better\nand I was like oh\nI hate driving that Hyundai and I\nstarted thinking about man maybe this\nthing does influence the way that I feel\nand the way that I show up and so I got\na new car I got a raptor after doing\nwell I got then I got an F-150 and then\nI got a raptor after that and I love\ndriving it I love the way that I feel\nbut I don't really have it for anyone\nelse\nI have it just because I thought it\nwould be fun to get and I I thought that\nit would help me get a little bit uh let\nme get a better experience while I'm\ndriving if I get a drive anyways I might\nas well get something that you know\nmakes the experience fun\nbut I don't really have any of the you\nknow the the cars that I have or any of\nthose things to try to impress anybody\nliterally no joke got a new car uh I got\na Mercedes AMG GT earlier this week and\num as it was getting pulled up and\ndropped off\nDean my best friend my business partner\nwas there and he's like man he's so\nexcited and I was like Ugh it's just a\nstupid buy it's just going to make some\nthings more fun right like it wasn't\nlike I didn't want to buy it to impress\npeople that doesn't isn't what I'm\nreally wanting to do I'm buying because\nI'm like it's going to make my\nexperience of driving more fun and if it\ndoes that that's cool it's a convertible\nI don't own a convertible maybe Laura\nand I will have fun driving around with\nbear but it's not like I I want to\nimpress anybody with there's not like I\nfeel like I need this thing I'm like\nit'll just be fun it'll just be another\nexperience and so what I'm trying to\nwork on is what are my experiences like\nin life like will this thing if I buy it\nwill it be filling a hole in my soul is\nthat what I'm trying to do by buying\nthis thing will it feel a whole will it\ngive me attention from other people that\nmake other people think that I'm cool if\nI buy this thing if that's the case then\nI'm not going to buy it that's not the\npoint\nwill it be fun for myself would be fun\nfor my family will it be a fun thing to\nhave is it a necessity I don't know we\nstart checking off those boxes is a\nnecessity most things are not you know I\nhave my Necessities taken care of will\nit be more fun could be okay cool maybe\nwe could check that off will it give me\na new experience in life it could and so\nyou can start thinking about material\nthings because a lot of people like\neither materialistic or they\nanti-materialistic\nand I don't think that you need to be\nthe one material things can give you you\nknow it could be fun they could be\nsomething that you could do they give\nyou experiences all this stuff\nhey friend if you're loving this episode\nplease do me a really quick favor just\ngive us a like right down below\nbut you've got to ask yourself am I\nbuying this because I want it and\nbecause I want the experiences or am I\nbuying it because I feel like I'm\nfilling a hole in my soul is there a\nlack of worthiness where I want people\nto see me I want people to recognize me\nI want to feel like I'm better than\nanybody else that really comes down to\nself-discovery right those things will\nnever give you happiness\nlike I always say like a lot of times\npeople who have Ferraris they don't have\nFerraris for themselves they have 99 of\nthem have Ferraris for other people so\nother people look at them\nand so those things are not going to\nbring you happiness I knew that that\n car wouldn't bring me happiness\nbut I was like ah it'll be pretty fun\nI'll try it out never had a sports car\nbefore if I don't like it I'll just sell\nit no big deal won't really lose money\non it by doing it and so we we think\nthat those things will bring us\nhappiness and then after a while you\nrealize that things just don't bring you\nhappiness\nand we all think that we're searching\nfor happiness but we're not really\nsearching for happiness like if I were\nto go up to the average person and say\nare you searching for happiness in your\nlife\noh my gosh yes I want happiness I want\nthat happiness sure you want you want to\nbe happy but really what you're looking\nfor is fulfillment you want to feel\nfulfilled and I believe that happiness\nis a byproduct of fulfillment\nfulfillment is like a state uh where\nit's just like it's like a part of you\nwhat you're doing what your path is in\nlife you are fulfilled and when you're\non that path you get emotions and\nsometimes that emotion is happiness\nbut we all know happiness is just\nfleeting right you could be really happy\nright now you could get a phone call and\nthat happiness is gone immediately based\noff what the other person says so\nthen you start to ask yourself what I\ntalked about the very beginning of this\nwill I still be motivated if I don't\ndesire things yes motivation\nI can give you a truth for myself the\nfirst 32 years of my life probably my\nmotivation came from a lack of\nself-worth\nbuying things to fill the void seeing my\nbank account to feel like I was safe\nachieving to feel fill the void trying\nto be better than other people and\ncompeting with other people to fill the\nvoid\nbut motivation can also come from doing\nsomething great motivation could come\nfrom wanting to do something greater\nthan yourself motivation can come from\nthe search for fulfillment one of the\nthings that I've found with a lot of\npeople\nand we have a event that that's going to\nbe coming up at the end of August is\nabout fulfillment and about purpose and\none of the things that I have found is\nthat for me early on when I was younger\nI was making great money 27 years old\nmaking quarter million dollars a year\nworked from home had a new house all of\nthese things\nbut I didn't feel fulfilled like there\nwas no fulfillment in having the money\nin my bank account there's no\nfulfillment in buying things there's no\nfulfillment of buying the house none of\nthose things I was actually the least\nfulfilled I ever was in my life and I\nreally started to feel a little bit\ndepressed like I was starting to sink\ninto this depression I realized I was\nsinking into it because I was doing what\nSociety told me to do\nright and I realized I was doing what\nSociety told me to do what success would\nbe\nbut I didn't feel\nit inside of me\nand it was like like Tony Robbins always\nsays success without fulfillment is the\nultimate failure I felt like a failure I\nsucceeded with what I was supposed to do\nin life what Society told me to do but I\nfelt like a failure\nbut then what happened was I when I just\ndecided like really made my decision\nwhat I'm doing right now is podcast\ncoaching people all of the stuff I've\nbeen doing\nmy motivation comes from doing something\ngreat for the world and I have more\nmotivation now than I did when I was\nyounger working for another company and\nworking for somebody else now it's not\nsaying that you can't find motivation\nand you can't find fulfillment in your\ncurrent job or working for someone else\nyou can't find fulfillment in the\nbusiness that you currently have you\ndefinitely can but motivation from doing\nsomething great versus doing something\njust to buy or just to be able to\nkeep up with the Joneses or to be able\nto buy a nice watch to post it on\nInstagram and show people what you've\nbeen able to do right can you find\nmotivation from instead of achieving\ninstead of buying things instead of\naccumulating things instead of trying to\nimpress people instead of trying to fill\na void that's inside of your soul or\nlack of self-worth can you find\nmotivation from wanting to do something\ngreat for yourself but also great for\nthe world and really if you want to have\ngratitude for everything that you have\nyou know you become a millionaire you\nwon't be grateful when you become a\nmillionaire if you can't be grateful\nwhen you have a thousand dollars in your\nbank account just telling you that I can\ntell you from experience and many people\nthat I know they're exactly the same if\nyou can't be grateful for what you have\nnow you will not be able to find\ngratitude for what you have later on\ndown the road you won't just magically\nstart becoming grateful there's always\nsomeone that's way worse off than you so\nif you actually take a step back and\nreally think about no matter where you\nare in life if you're listening this\npodcast your life is better than\nbillions of people on this Earth\nand it's better than billions of people\nwho lived before you were born on this\nEarth\nthink about that for a second like if\nyou were\nif you were a king in the 1300s\nyour life would still not be as good as\nyour life is right now they didn't have\nair conditioning they didn't have cars\nthey didn't have cell phones they didn't\nhave entertainment like we do they died\nat like 30 40 years old Kings always had\nto look over their backs I think the\naverage like Roman Emperor lived for\nlike eight years as the emperor five\nyears eight years of the emperor because\nsomeone always stabbed him in the back\nlike your life right now is better than\na King's life\n1300 1400\nso you actually start to think about\nthat and you realize like you have so\nmuch to be grateful for in this moment\ncan you start to figure out a way to\nfinally feel peace for what you have to\nfeel gratitude for what you have\nI don't care if you buy things that's\nfine go out and buy things have fun with\nthings have experiences do life that's\nwhat you're here to do is to do life but\ndon't come from a place of like needing\nit to prove yourself to other people\nneeding it to feel better about yourself\nneeding it for any other reason other\nthan hey\nthis would be nice to have or you know I\ndo need this\nthink about that for a second\nwhat if what if nothing that you ever\nbought nobody ever saw again\nyou know if you're like you know what\nI'm gonna go buy this car what if nobody\never saw that car except for you would\nyou still want it or would you be like\nah let's get a Corolla\nif you are about to go buy a new watch\nor a new purse if nobody else ever saw\nit but you\nwould you still want it\nand you start to think about what are\nthe reasons why I buy the things that I\nbuy\nand really what it comes down to is\nthere's nothing that you could ever get\nthat could make you happier there's\nnothing you could ever get to make you\nmore fulfilled there's nothing you could\never do or say or accomplish to make you\nmore of who you already are who you are\nborn into being\nthere's nothing you could do same amount\nof money accomplishment that can make\nyou more or less than who you currently\nare\ncan you find gratitude for where you\ncurrently are because when you can find\ngratitude for you currently are\nit's like the universe starts to bless\nyou with more things to be grateful for\nbecause what you focus on expands if you\nfind things to be grateful for the\nuniverse will give you more things to be\ngrateful for so that is my way of\nfinding more peace so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in at Rob\ndial Junior\nrov-d-i-a-l-j-r and once again I'm
