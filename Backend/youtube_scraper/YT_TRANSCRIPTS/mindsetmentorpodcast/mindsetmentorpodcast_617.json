    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout the Power of Words we're gonna be\ntalking about the power of the words\nthat you use we're also going to be\ntalking about the power of the words\nthat people use around you because words\nthemselves can have so much power\nbut\nwords can also have no power none\nand it's kind of crazy when you start to\nthink of it because you realize that\nwords only have power\nwhen you give them power\nSo when you say something to somebody it\ncould mean nothing to them or it could\nmean everything to them someone can come\nup to you right now and call you a name\nand as absolutely no effect on you none\nnot even a little bit someone can come\nup and say something to you and you can\njust be like that's kind of weird I\nwonder why they said that well okay and\nyou go on about your day and you never\nthink about it again\nbut someone could also come up to you\nand say something and it could trigger\nyou completely it could set you off it\ncould ruin your whole day it could\nruin your whole week you could think\nabout it seven days from now why did\nthat person say that thing to me\ninteresting have you ever thought about\nwhy that is how some words can have no\npower over you they mean nothing and\nthen some words can have massive amounts\nof power over you and it can completely\nruin your day you can think about it a\nweek later you could be pissed off in\nfour or five days\nI get messages all the time\nit's always something like this hey Rob\nhow can I not let other people affect my\nmindset my mom says this this how can I\nnot let her affect my mindset my my\ngirlfriend's this way how can I not let\nit affect my mindset hey my father acts\nlike this how can I not you know my\nfather thinks that I'm a failure blah\nblah blah and I so I get all these\nmessages on Instagram you know I don't\nif I'm being honest I don't have time to\nreply to everybody but I see them all\ncome in I read them and then create a\npodcast episodes usually from what I\nread on Instagram so you know if you\nwant me to do a podcast episode send me\nan Instagram message but you know the\nthing is that's interesting about though\nis that I get these messages of how can\nI not let this other person ruin my\nmindset that's basically the\nthe the all of them together summarized\nright\nin my response to you if you feel like\nthat's a question that you have a\nquestion on is the person doesn't ruin\nyour mindset\nthey don't\nthe person has absolutely no effect on\nyou no matter what happens if you have\nno response to somebody or a massive\nresponse to somebody they have no effect\non your mindset they didn't ruin your\nmindset they didn't ruin your day you\nruined your mindset you ruined your day\nif the person who came up to you and\nsaid words ruined your mindset and they\ncame up and you know maybe I said oh\nyou're\nyour face is so ugly and maybe you have\nsome sort of uh insecurity around what\nyou look like it could ruin your your\nday\nbut if that person came up to you and\nsaid the exact same thing\nbut in a different language that you\ndon't speak\nthat would have no effect on you which\nshows you that you put\nthe actual meaning into the words you'd\nhave no reaction if it was in a\ndifferent language so it's not\nnecessarily the words is what we're\ncoming at right\nit's not the words it's what you think\nof the words\nbut it's also what you think of yourself\nit's what you think of the words and\nwhat you think of yourself and this is\nreally important to understand words\nonly hurt to the degree at which you\nalready believe them oh that's a\nsmack in the face doesn't it the words\nthat somebody says to you only hurts to\nthe degree at which you already believe\nthem so once again like I said if\nsomeone comes up to you and says your\nface is ugly you are the ugliest person\nI've ever seen and you have a really\nhigh like like like self-esteem someone\ncomes out to me and says oh you're\nyou're ugly all right cool\nthanks that's your opinion but if\nsomebody has like really low self-esteem\nand they're looking in the mirror\nconstantly and they're talking trash\nthemself and someone comes up to you and\nsays you're ugly you're one of the\nugliest people I've ever seen your face\nis disgusting\nand they believe that already before the\nperson says it\nwell guess what\nit's going to hurt\nand it will hurt to the degree at which\nyou already believe it\nso like I've given this example probably\nlike 20 times in this podcast over the\npast eight years maybe even more but the\nway this really like started clicking\nfor me was a story that my friend had\ntold one time when I was at an event he\nwas speaking it and he was talking about\nhis his first mentor and if you can\nlisten to this podcast for a long time\nyou could probably tell the story as\nwell as I can but let's just go over one\nmore time because sometimes it hits\ndifferently when you hear it a different\ntime one of my friends he's walking down\nthe street with his mentor he's 24 25\nyears old at this time with his mentors\nin his 40s and he's already doing over a\nmillion dollars in his business business\nis already super successful it's doing\nwell\nhis mentor says to him he goes man\nyour business is doing so well he's like\nyou must be so proud of yourself\nand he's like not really man and he's\nlike what do you mean he's like well\nevery time I get an email about uh about\nsomebody not liking the product or that\nit broke or that the shipping didn't\ncome in the way that they wanted and I\nget all these responses I just\nI honestly just think of shutting it\ndown\nand his mentor without skipping a beat\ngoes yeah because you're insecure\nmy friend's like what are you talking\nabout he goes you are insecure and the\nreason why this hurts is because you\nalready are insecure about your business\nhe's like let me give you an example\nwe're not walking down the street right\nnow what if a lady comes up to you right\nnow and she says oh my God you have the\nugliest pink hair I've ever seen what\nare you gonna think he goes well I'm not\nI'm not really going to think anything\nof it he goes why aren't you going to\nthink anything of it\nhe goes well because I don't have pink\nhair he goes oh yeah you're not going to\nthink anything of it because you don't\nthink that you have pink hair\nbut she'll think something of it and\nyou'll get caught up in the story and\nyou'll get caught up in the words when\nsomeone doesn't like your product\nbecause you're insecure around your\nproduct you're insecure around your\nbusiness so the reason why you are\noffended by what someone else is saying\nis because you actually already believe\nwhat that person is saying I want you to\ntake a step back and like actually think\nabout this whatever triggers you is\nsomething that you already believe about\nyourself and we'll talk about triggers\nin just a second\nbut when someone comes up to you and\nsays something\nit's not them that's the problem it's\nyou that's the problem we are always the\nproblem you are the problem to\neverything in your life you're also the\nsolution to everything in your life the\nfaster that you learn that the faster\nthat you really understand that the\nfaster that you really get that into\nyour soul the faster your life will\nstart to change\nif someone came up to me and the street\nand just called me fat I wouldn't think\nanything of it because I would probably\nlaugh because I just don't view myself\nas someone who's fat but if someone gets\nhighly offended by it it could be\nbecause they're fat but there are also\npeople who are not fat that think that\nthey are fat and so what it comes down\nto is what you actually believe about\nyourself\nthat's what it comes down to doesn't\nmatter what someone's body looks like\nthere's some people that are overweight\nthat wouldn't give a there's some\npeople who are not overweight they'll be\nlike oh my God I look so fat today\nso if someone gets highly offended by it\nit's because they're saying words to\nthem that they already believe about\nthemselves\nand really this is a definition of being\ntriggered being triggered is one of the\nbest things that could possibly happen\nto you if you look at it the right way\nnow you might be like that doesn't make\nany sense it does make sense once you\nhear me explain it right because being\ntriggered is a gift if somebody triggers\nyou they don't deserve to be slapped\nthey don't deserve for you to be pissed\nthey deserve a hug they deserve a high\nfive from you whatever it is because\nthat person is basically the universe\ncoming to you in the form of a human in\nfront of your face to show you where you\nare not free\nit is a place where you are stuck in\nyour own mind whether what you believe\nabout yourself what you believe about\nthe world what you believe about people\naround you whenever you are triggered by\nsomething that is the universe God\nwhatever you want to believe in coming\nto you in a physical manifestation of a\nhuman to show you where you are stuck\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a favor give us a like down below\nand then if you have any idea of topics\nyou want me to cover in future episodes\ncomment them down below maybe I'll do\nyour topic in a future episode\nwhere you are not free because\nultimately that's all we're trying to do\nwe're trying to get free free from\nourselves free from our minds we're\ntrying to build a life for Freedom\naren't we they're showing you a place\nwhere you're stuck in your own head\nthey're showing you a place where you\nhave given up your own sovereignty as a\nsovereign being and said I'm just going\nto let everybody else control the way\nthat I feel based off of what they say\nbecause they're just words\nyou know there's a quote that's\nperfectly about this\nI probably said it 150 times in this\npodcast by Eleanor Roosevelt and she\nsays no one can make you feel inferior\nwithout your consent\nno one can make you feel inferior\nwithout your consent you are deciding\neven if you're not realizing it's just\nconscious decision you are\nsubconsciously deciding I'm going to\ngive up control of how I feel based off\nof what other people say to me I'm going\nto let other people control the way that\nI feel\nthat's basically what you're saying\nunconsciously oh this person says this\nword I'm going to be mad about it\nthey're in control of my feelings now\nit's what it comes down to you have to\nbe the one to take control of your\nfeelings again Victor Frankel who I\nwould say is probably the best person to\nlearn from as far as how to learn and\ngrow because this guy was a psychologist\nwho was in Nazi prison prison camps like\nAuschwitz and he lived through them and\nhe saw people go through them and he was\nalready psychologist before she was able\nto see people in the way they act people\nwho were in The camps but people who\nwere also running the camps it was able\nto kind of see both sides of the\nextremes of humans right and one of the\nthings that he says there's a great book\non if you want to read his book\num it's called Man's Search for meaning\nit's really short really I don't want to\nsay easy read it is easy to read but it\nis a hard read because he tells you some\nstuff about what happened to him that\nand other people around him that is\npretty hard to to stomach but he says\nwhen you look at your life he says\nbetween stimulus and response there's a\nspace and in that space is our power to\nchoose our response and in our response\nlies our freedom so let me let me take\nthat that quote again and break it down\nfor you between stimulus and response\nsomething happening in you responding to\nit there's a space\nit could be a tenth of a second\nbut in that space is our power to choose\nour response our power to choose our\nresponse and in the response lies our\ngrowth and our freedom what is he saying\nhe's saying no matter what happens to\nyou you are the one that's in control of\nhow you respond you're also going to see\ncontrol of how you feel and if you're\njust leaving it up to other people\nyou're not in control of your life\nyou're not in control of yourself you're\nnot in control of your mind you're not\nin control of your emotions but if you\ncan actually start to understand that\nwhen you master your emotions no matter\nwhat somebody says to you you won't\nrespond to it no matter how bad it is\nyou'll be able to keep your calm cool\ncomposure it's not saying that I'm going\nto be absent of this world oh my gosh\nwhatever somebody says I'm just going to\nact like they don't say it no it's\nsaying I'm going to listen to what they\nsay and I'm going to be so in control of\nmyself that no matter what somebody does\nor says to me I am going to keep my calm\nmy inner peace will not be disturbed by\nanybody else\nso what are both of those quotes showing\nyou that you are the gatekeeper to your\nfreedom\nyou are the gatekeeper to your freedom\nyou are the only one that's in control\nand you cannot give control to someone\nelse\nwhat they say and what they do you can't\nthere is no way but we act like oh what\nyou know you see somebody like why are\nyou acting like that why are you so mad\noh well I'm so mad because she did this\nno you're not you're not mad because of\nthe event you're mad because of your\nresponse to the event there is no one\nthat can change the way that you think\nthe way that you feel the way that you\nact you do so stop giving your power\naway\nand it's like when you really start to\nthink about it you really start to go\nman yeah I am the one that's in control\nthere's another really good quote that\nVictor Frankel says he says everything\ncan be taken from a man but one thing\nthe last of the human freedoms and this\nis let me take a step out of his quote\nthis is from someone who saw everyone's\nfreedoms completely taken away from them\nright so he says everything can be taken\nfrom a man but one thing\nthe last of the human freedoms to choose\none's attitude in any given set of\ncircumstances to choose one's own way so\nyou can take everything from somebody\nbut the last thing that you have\nthe last freedom that you really have is\nto choose one's attitude in any given\nset of circumstances to choose who\nyou're going to be how you're going to\nact how you're going to be as a person\nbut once again\nthe words only hurt to the degree that\nwe already believe them so what do we\nneed to do we need to notice our\ntriggers when someone triggers us it's\nnot fun you feel it but then you take a\nstep back after the being triggered and\nyou say okay what just happened why did\nI get triggered what what was what was\nthe situation that just happened there\nbecause we need to release our\nattachments to these triggers we need to\nrelease our beliefs to what somebody\nsays to us because you do want to be\nfree right I Want to Be Free humans Want\nto Be Free more than they want anything\nelse\nthat's one thing I do believe more than\nanything else humans Want to Be Free\nmore than they want anything else we\nwant freedom try to tell you to try to\ntell a two-year-old that they can't do\nsomething how do they react\nthey want to be free\nthat's why I think a lot of people want\nto make money they think that they want\nmoney they don't want money they want\nwhat they think money will give them\nwhich is freedom freedom to do what they\nwant when they want with who they want\nright we think we want the money but we\njust want the freedom we want what comes\nwith the money is more than anything\nelse but one thing else we want freedom\nbesides freedom to do what we want when\nwe want with who we want we want freedom\nin our minds that's what we really want\nimagine if your mind was just beautiful\npeaceful calm place no matter what\nhappened it was just beautiful would it\nbe nice shouldn't we all be trying to\nsearch for that to try to build that\nto let go of the things that are causing\nthe disturbances so that therefore we\ncan have a calm mind that's why you're\nhere that's why you've gone through the\nthings you've gone through in your life\nso you can figure out who you're not to\nReDiscover who you truly are that's why\nyou're listening to this\nso do you want to be triggered not\nnecessarily but what do you do next time\nthat you are triggered because I promise\nyou it will happen again here's what you\ndo\nyou punch the other person in the face\nno I'm just kidding you don't do that\nwhat you do is you make a mental note of\nbeing triggered and then you Journal\nthrough it what was it that happened and\nwhat did that person shine a light on in\nmyself\nthat person said and they made me\nrealize oh my God that's actually I\nbelieve in myself they said that I'm\nugly in some sort of way or they talk\ndown to me that talk down to me it made\nme triggered why because I don't feel\nlike I'm actually smart enough and so\nthat brought up a childhood wound from\nwhen I was 11 years old and the kids in\nclass call me stupid because I spelled\ncouch incorrectly in a spelling bee\nright maybe that's what it is oh me\nthat's not their fault it's me I'm still\nholding on to an 11 year old spelling\nbee it's not that person's father they\nsaid to me uh okay I see you start to\nidentify yourself when you start to be\nable to let go of these things and as\nyou start to let go of these things you\nbecome more free ultimately that's what\nwe're searching for so next time you're\ntriggered what do you do write it down\nquestion yourself about it and try to\nsee where it came from and how you\nbecome free of it so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode\ndo me a favor please share it on your\nInstagram stories
