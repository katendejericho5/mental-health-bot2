    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout four steps to finding yourself and\nthese are inspired by Friedrich\nNietzsche if you've never heard of him\nand um\nlet's just dive into it so four steps to\nfind yourself and then also truly become\nwho you were born to be and who you want\nto become because all too often we\nreally get stuck in doing what we think\nwe're supposed to when other people say\nwe should do in order to fit in and all\nof that stuff so we're going to talk\nabout how to discover your own unique\nself and what it is that you want to do\nin this world the first one\nplease take this advice stop following\nthe herd mentality\nstop following the herd mentality\nthere's a quote that says what we call\nUniversal values what we call truths\nhave only ever been the personal\nexpression of those who promoted them\nthink about that for a second what you\ncall your Universal values what you call\nyour truths a lot of times have only\nbeen the personal expression of those\npeople who promoted them don't follow\nthe herd mentality you know there's a\nlot of um\npeople saying oh this is what you know\nthat person's a sheep this person's a\nsheep I never actually seen a real video\nof sheep moving but what's crazy is you\ncan see one sheep that's in the front\nand it literally is every sheep just\nfollows the one in front of it they\ndon't see anything in front of them they\njust follow whatever they're supposed to\nbe following they could be walking off\nof a cliff they have no idea and so\nwe're tribal we were tribal at one point\nin time we have that built in there's\nstill an animalistic part of our brain\nthat wants to fit in that needs to fit\nin in order to survive it thinks because\nat one point in time like you know if\nyou fell asleep in the woods a hundred\nthousand years ago and you were by\nyourself\nthere's a chance that something might\nhave ate you but when you have a tribe\nwith you and some of the people can stay\nawake and watch and take shifts and in\norder to protect each other at night but\nthen also the same time to make sure you\nhunt together to make sure you you go\nand get food together like we want to\nfit in it's literally built into our\nsystem to have to fit in to survive\nbut you don't have to fit in with\nanybody anymore right our ancestors had\nto fit in you don't but what limits our\nindividuality and our creativity is the\nfeeling like we have to fit in we have\nto be like other people you know how\nmany people listening don't wear what\nyou want to because it makes you stand\nout\nhow many people listening don't act do\nand say exactly what you want because of\nthe worries and thoughts of other\npeople's opinions of you of what you\nknow I want to do this thing and put\nthis on Instagram but I'm afraid my\nmom's gonna say something so I'm going\nto limit my full expression so that\ntherefore I don't have somebody say that\nthey don't like the thing that I posted\non Instagram right you're limiting your\nfull expression of who you truly are you\nare if you just really come to terms\nthat if you're doing this you are\ndimming your light just to keep other\npeople comfortable I don't know about\nyou but that that's not what I want\nto do and you know are you going to get\nhaters are you going to stand out are\npeople not going to like you sometimes\nsure it's a very small amount but it's\ngoing to happen people don't want to\nstand out because they fear like one of\nour deepest fears that's built into our\nsystem it feels like is a fear of\nrejection how people will ridicule you\nfor standing out because you're showing\nthem how they're dimming themselves when\nyou see someone that's a hater\nthat's the reason why haters exist is\nbecause they're jealous of you haters\ndon't hate you they represent they hate\nwhat you represent which is somebody who\nis trying to better themselves somebody\nwho is trying to to grow into the most\num the most truest version of themself\nand there's a part of a hater that hates\nthat and the reason why is because\nyou're showing them what they are not\nwhat they are not doing how they are not\ncreating a life that they want to\nthey exist because they're jealous\nhaters don't hate you they hate what you\nrepresent in themselves and the herd\nconsists of people who have in a sense\nif you really think about it they've\nkilled their true self they've killed\ntheir dreams they've killed their goals\nin the life that they want just so they\ncan fit in\nand if you stand out it makes them feel\nthreatened it makes them feel\nuncomfortable and that's the reason why\nhaters exist is because you by who you\nare your fullest expression\nmakes them feel insecure makes them feel\nthreatened it's like Jim Carrey said in\nthat that famous quote he says in the\nhis his speech where he says your need\nto be accepted can make you invisible in\nthis world\nwhy do you have to be accepted by\neverybody\nwhat is it why can't you just step into\nyour true's version of yourself\nno why do people have so many addictions\nwhy do people have alcohol addictions\nand Drug addictions and food addictions\nand sex addictions and workaholism\nare there a lot of traumas in this world\nyes\nbut a lot of people are just trying to\nnumb themselves from the feeling of them\ndimming themselves and killing their\ndreams simply because they're afraid of\nwhat other people might think of them\nor because they don't want to stand out\nand it's numbing they're trying to numb\nthemself because they do not want I mean\nI know what this is because when I was\nin my my late 20s 26 27 before I like\nreally started to figure out who I was\nand start this podcast I would work\nreally hard during the week at a job\nthat I didn't want anymore I made great\nmoney and then I would freaking rage\nevery single weekend why because I was\ntrying to numb myself from how much I\nhated the path that my life was on and I\nwasn't my truest self and I wasn't\nliving in my fullest expression and I\nknow some of you out there are probably\nin the exact same situation\nand people are always like why don't you\nreally drink anymore it's like because I\ndon't feel like I need to numb like I'll\nhave a glass of wine because I enjoy it\nbut like I Lauren always talks about it\nmy wife always says like you just\nstopped partying when I came along like\nshe's like I wish I would have met the\npartying Rob and I was like because I\nfound who rob is and I didn't need to\nparty to numb anymore and so really\nstart to think about that like are you\nnumbing yourself\nand dimming your Flame\nsimply because you want to fit in with\neverybody else what's the benefit of\nfitting in really just think about that\nlet me know if you can find any so\nthat's number one number two\nis embrace the difficulty of\nself-discovery right it's only when\nwe're willing to face the challenge of\nlife that we are actually spiritually\ngrowing and so the the interesting thing\nis that people think that that in order\nto take action towards what feels\naligned for them that it should be the\neasiest thing in the world no it will be\neasier but it doesn't mean that there's\nnot going to be difficulty it doesn't\nmean that there's not going to be\nchallenges it doesn't mean that\neverything is just going to be you know\nunicorn and rainbows it's not going\nto be that way you have to learn to take\nthe difficult path in your life you have\nto surround yourself with other people\nwho are also taking the difficult path\nwho are trying to go on this path of\nself-discovery trying to challenge\nthemselves to be better because the path\nof self-discovery can be hard\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a really quick favor hit that like\nbutton down below and then if you have a\ntopic you want me to cover in future\nepisodes commented down below so I can\nsee some of your recommendations\nlike real hard\nand it makes a lot easier when you're\naround other people who value the\njourney as well and so what I would\nrecommend is try to distance yourself\nfrom people who aren't on the same path\nat least for just a little while like\ngive yourself a little bit like a head\nstart give yourself six months away from\nsome of those people who really are just\ntrying to diminish your dreams and what\nis it you're trying to do on the hard\nwork some people will never hop on the\nself-development train and that's fine\nthey don't have to\nbut if you if you continue to hang out\nwith them a lot of times they will slow\nyou down so can you distance yourself\nfor the next six months as you just\nreally focus on yourself because in many\ncases those types of people hold you\nback the people that you surround\nyourself with will either Propel you\nforward to to create an amazing life or\nthey'll hold you back from creating that\nlife you've heard me say it you've heard\nmany other people say it as well you're\nthe average of The Five People You spend\nthe most time with you should really\nstart to pay attention to who you're\nspending time with and you know the the\npath of self-discovery can get hard\nthere's in order to get better we\nsometimes we have to go to the past and\nlook at traumas that happen to us like\nthe way I like to think about of trauma\nit's kind of like a broken bone if\nyou've ever had a broken bone before\nimagine that you break a bone and then\nyou go to the doctor and you get it set\nyou wear a cast and then 10 years down\nthe road you realize that the broken\nbone still hurts you it still doesn't\nfeel right you go to get X-rays and you\nrealize that the broken bone was never\nput back and set back in place correctly\nit's just a little bit off\nwell what do you need to do in order to\nfix that broken bone\na lot of times you have to break it\nagain to put it back in the right place\nand so trauma is like that broken bone\nthat first happened and if you don't\novercome the trauma it's kind of like\nthe broken bone isn't set correctly and\nsometimes we have to go through that\npain\nof re-breaking going back and visiting\nthat that thing that we're running from\nin order to live the rest of our life\nand go back to what feels good with that\nbroken bone and it goes back to the\nphrase which is one of my favorite\nphrase about personal development is the\ncave that you're afraid to enter holds\nthe treasure that you seek right\nsometimes you've got to go through some\n that's just the way that it goes\nit's not always going to be easy but it\nwill 100 be worth it the life you want\nwill only come by overcoming the\nskeletons that you continue to keep in\nyour closet and try to act like are not\nthere okay so that's number two number\nthree say yes to what gives you meaning\nsay yes to what gives you meaning\nhe who has a lie can bear almost any how\nwhen you know what it is that you want\nlike when you have something and what if\nyou're if you're trying to kind of\nstruggling with where your meaning is an\neasy way to start to find more meaning\nis what gives you energy\nI don't mean like coffee what I mean\nlike is when you do this thing it gives\nyou energy that's usually something\nsomething that gives you energy is kind\nof a little bit of the sign it's like\nthe universe kind of giving a little\nnudge of like hey this is what you're\nsupposed to do like for me when I get\ndone recording these podcast episodes I\nhave more energy after recording the\npodcast episodes than before when I get\ndone doing a live for you know mindset\nMentor University and I go through and I\ndo a live and have everybody there I\nhave more more energy after and for\nthose of you guys that always email\nthey're like how do I find out about\nmine said Mentor University our weekly\ncalls it's info robdial.com you can\nemail my team will send you some\ninformation so info robdial.com and so\nwhen you look at that and you start to\nthink about like I get energy from those\nthings I always have more energy after\nthan I did before which shows me it is\nsomething that gives me meaning and so\nfollow your energy if you're if you've\nbeen trying to think of your meaning and\nyou're thinking and thinking and\nthinking and thinking and thinking about\nit all the time\nhey I got an idea why don't you just ask\nyourself what gives me energy when when\nyou're what gives me a feeling that I'm\ngetting pulled towards it it's kind of\nlike a a gravity that's pulling you\ntowards this thing usually that has some\nmeaning to it\nokay what is it that you love what is it\nyou love to do you know what did you\nlove to do as a kid What Makes You Happy\nNow what made you happy as a kid make a\nlist of all those things bring all of\nthose things into your day stop doing\nthings that you don't like right like\nthere's one thing that's really\nkind of from being honest with you it's\nkind of tiring that I'm that I I've you\nknow been posting on Instagram and\nFacebook and all the stuff for a really\nlong time and so many people just post\nwith this negativity of like well yeah\nit'd be nice if my life could be this\nway but my life it sucks in my life I've\ngotten this and you know must be great\nto just be raised in a perfect world and\nand people just have this this feeling\nof like life has to suck oh it must be\nnice but my life is going to be for\nthe rest of my life like where did this\ncome from\nwhy why do you have to do things that\nyou don't like\noh that's that sounds nice but you don't\nknow my life\nokay you're right we don't know your\nlife but your life is completely in your\ncontrol so if you're doing something\nthat you don't want to be doing maybe\nyou can't leave it immediately but you\ncan't make a transition plan\nyou can say but by by 2024\nI will not do anything that doesn't\nlight me up inside\nif you can come up with it what is it\nthat you want by 2025 I will not do\nanything that doesn't light me up inside\nI can't leave my job immediately but I\ncan't make some sort of transition plan\nI can start to put a plan in place to\nget my life to where I want it to be and\nto get on the right track right so\nthat's number three number four find\nyour True Values do you really know what\nyour True Values are not what your mom\ntaught you not what your dad taught you\nnot what Society taught you not what\nyour religion taught you like what are\nyour true values of as a human\nhave you ever thought about that before\nno it's been told to you but like what\nactually feels like are your values who\ndo you want to be\nwrite down everyone and everything that\nlimits your freedom there's someone in\nyour life that's something that's\nsubmitting your freedom\nif there's a job that you're working on\nsomebody you're Freedom if there's an\naction that you do that limits your\nfreedom write down every single thing\nthat limits your freedom\nstart to move those things off of your\nplate stop doing them as much come up\nwith a plan to get them off of your\nplate I'm not saying it's gonna like\nhappen like that\nsome things taste time some things take\na plan some things take a lot of action\nbefore they finally change\nbut like what are your True Values when\nyou're when you're dead which you will\nbe one day you will be so will I we all\nwill be how do you want to be described\nat your funeral\nwhat do you want people to say about you\nI remember when uh when an ex-girlfriend\nher dad passed away uh probably about 10\nyears ago at this point a while ago and\num I remember going to and he was always\nan awesome guy he was always really cool\nand um we were already broken up for\nlike 10 years at this point but I knew\nhim really well in high school and uh I\nremember going to his funeral and there\nwere so many people there it was like a\nreally kind of a eye-opening thing for\nme there's so many people there that\nthey didn't all fit in the church so\nthere were people sitting down there\nwere people standing on the outside of\nthe edges of the church and there were\npeople standing outside with the windows\nopen so they could hear and I thought to\nmyself holy\nI want to have this sort of impact on\nthe world like most people are worried\nabout how much money is their Bank in\ntheir bank account I'm worried about how\nmany people come to my funeral because\nof what I did the actions I took the\nperson that I was and so what are your\ntrue values and what do you want people\nto say about you at your funeral that's\nhow you should start living your life in\nthe lens that you start looking at the\nworld through and so if you want the\nfour ways to truly find yourself number\none stop following the herd mentality\nnumber two embrace the difficulty of\nyour self-discovery number three say yes\nto what gives you meaning and number\nfour find your True Values so that's\nwhat I got for
