    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto give you a four-step process to\novercome your Stress and Anxiety let's\ndive in let's be real we live in a\nstressful world you know over the past\n100 Years A lot has changed for humans\nlike I can't even imagine how much has\nchanged for humans when I used to talk\nwith my grandparents before they passed\naway it was like they had stress in\ntheir life for sure but like there's so\nmuch more going on right now and we have\naccess to so much more information we're\nseeing all the crazy things that are\nhappening in the world that we're tend\nwe're getting a little bit more stressed\nwe're getting a little bit more anxious\nover the past 10 years it's a completely\ndifferent world and so I was talking\nwith my wife Lauren about it and um just\nlike how social media and smartphones\nhave really taken off in the past like\n10 years or so like when I was in high\nschool I I didn't get a a phone until I\nwas 17 years old and it was just a FP\nphone it didn't really do anything I\ncould text and I could make phone calls\nand I could play and that was about it\nnow all of the access that we have in\nour pocket like smartphones didn't even\ncome out until I was 20 21 years old and\nso you know it didn't have Facebook it\ndidn't have Instagram Tik Tok all that\nstuff Twitter all on our phones so our\nbrains are just really not meant to deal\nwith all of the constant stimuli with\nthe TV with the phone with email with\nnotifications with other people with\nFacebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and\nTwitter and you know my space I don't\neven know it exists anymore right all\nthese different things and if we're not\ncareful we're going to get really\nwrapped up and it's only going to become\nharder to get out of and so knowing that\nwe live in a stressful world the real\nthing is how can we make sure that we\nget rid of or change as many things\naround us that keep us stressed out if\nyou don't work on stress Management in\nyour life now you need to work on stress\nmanagement one of the things I love is\nthat mental health is really become a\ntopic that people talk about quite often\nnow I have friends that come and talk\nyou know over the past 5 years so many\nfriends have started talking about like\nwhen I was at my therapist this when I\nwas at my therapist that that didn't\nhappen 10 years ago so you really need\nto start working on your stress\nmanagement and try to realize that your\nstress management is a really big aspect\nof your mental health especially with\nall of the constant challenges that come\nwith all of our modern living that we're\nin so we need to figure out what our\ntriggers are we need to figure out what\nwhat we can do what kind of stress\nmanagement techniques we can have that\ncan help us manage our emotions better\nso that help us live better lives and so\nwhat we have to do and and we all have\nto do instead of just sitting back and\nbeing like I hope I can make it what we\nreally need to do is we need to figure\nout a way to be more proactive to come\nup with a plan and you know how fast the\nworld is changing I'm I'm just thinking\nit's probably only going to get harder\nso that that means that you and I must\nget better we must get better and so\nthat's what we're going to dive into\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\ngain really conscious awareness of your\nthought process of of your internal\nenvironment but also your external\nenvironment as well we're going to\nreally sit down together we're going to\ndevelop a a proactive Stress Management\nstrategy we're going to go through uh\ndifferent ways to journal to help you go\nthrough this and use journaling as a\nStress Management tool and then what I'm\nalso going to do is I'm going to teach\nyou a Stress Management uh technique\nfrom the Mayo Clinic as well so let's go\nthrough it and if you're taking notes\nyou should definitely jot this down\nthere's four A's that are inside of\nStress Management okay Four A's the Mayo\nClinic created this practical guide to\nStress Management to help you kind of\nfigure out what each one of these you\nknow if you figure out something that\nstresses you out then you can say which\none of the A's is it and how can I\nchange it around so the first one as far\nas the Stress Management goes the first\na is avoid is to avoid as many stressful\nsituations as you possibly can but you\ncan avoid them unless you first sit down\nand identify them so can you create a\nlife where you avoid as much stress as\npossible and I don't mean avoid them um\ncompletely in the sense of like oh I'm\njust going to you know my children\nstress me out sometimes I'm just going\nto not go home that's not what I mean I\nmean by looking at your life and\nfiguring out what things stress you out\nI'll give you a good example for me I\ndon't know why it's this way but I hate\ngroceries stores I want to avoid grocery\nstores as much as possible I don't know\nwhat happened they stressed me out maybe\nI was like you know beaten in a grocery\nstore in another life I don't I don't\nknow what it is but for me knowing that\ngrocery stor stress me out like some\npeople love grocery stores I don't know\nhow I hate them I don't want to go in\nthem I want to go in them as little as I\npossibly can all of that I order all of\nmy food online and I rarely walk into a\ngrocery store Whole Food or instacart it\nis more expensive yes I understand that\nbut for me it's worth it because it is\nsaving me a lot of time it just gets\ndelivered to my doorstep I have to take\nit out of the bags and I have to put in\nthe fridge it's going to be more\nexpensive but it saves me a lot of time\nbut it's also peace of mind it stresses\nme out I don't know why don't really\ncare to know why but I'm just not going\nto do it as much as I possibly can so\nI'm trying to\navoid that stressful situation avoiding\ndoesn't mean that you're running away\nthis is important you're just\nprioritizing your mental health you're\njust learning to say no to\nunnecessary maybe even for some of you\nharmful\nstressors there are some people\nlistening this podcast right now where\nthere's people in your life that really\nstress you out there are friends there\nare family\nmembers there are\nco-workers avoid as many stress ful\npeople as possible if you can get them\nout of your life get them out of your\nlife if you can't spend less time with\nthem avoid them as much as you possibly\ncan hey real quick I want to introduce\nyou to something called mindset Mentor\nplus if you love this podcast you will\nabsolutely love what I'm about to talk\nabout I designed mindset Mentor plus to\nhelp you actively integrate

much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription does your your job stress\nyou out well okay maybe you can't find a\nnew job today but now that you know that\nyour job is so stressful because maybe\nyour co-workers maybe it's your boss\nmaybe it's your job and what it is that\nyou have to do maybe start opening your\nmind up to hey I think I should probably\nfind a new job and so you start to\nfigure out what it is that is in your\nlife that stretches you out and you\nfigure out which one of the eight it\ncould be all of the ones that you can\navoid as much as you can avoid avoid\nthem perfect the next one the next a is\nAlter if you cannot avoid a stressful\nsituation or a stressor try to alter the\nsituation so let's go back to my stupid\nexample of a grocery store right like\nit's not that big of a deal I just don't\nreally care to go in them right what\nabout when I forget something it happens\nall the time I forgot something and I\nhad to stop by Whole Foods yesterday\nso what I try to do is I try to alter\nthe situation so that I can have as less\nstress as possible and so I never go to\na grocery store and they're busy I\nusually wait until the last hour that\nthey're open almost nobody is there and\nthe reason why is because I don't have\nto wait any lines I don't have to deal\nwith kids throwing up on the floor\npeople running their cards sent me any\nof that stuff right almost no one's\nthere so I'm in and I'm out and the the\nthing that I always do I don't know who\nhas problems asking people for help but\nbut for me I go to the first person who\nworks there I say this is what I'm\nlooking for can you show me where it is\nand I just try to get it over with as\nfast as possible so I'm just altering\nthe situation a little bit you know if\nyou have other people that are in your\nlives that stress you out you can't\nchange somebody else but you can ask\nthem to change their behavior and the\nway they act to you so for some of you\nguys that are people Pleasers there's\nsome people in your life that are going\nto be in your life for probably forever\nand you can't really avoid them all the\ntime and so sometimes you need to alter\nthe situation and so if you're a people\npleaser a lot of times people Pleasers\nhave trouble with setting boundaries you\nneed to set boundaries and you need to\ntalk to the person ask them to change\ntheir behavior in the way they act to\nyou so maybe it's like hey they talk to\nyou this way and it really stresses you\nout it makes you feel bad about yourself\nwhatever it is you need to have a real\nopen honest conversation say when you\ntalk to me this way\nthis is how I feel can you please change\nit and see if you can alter the\nsituation that's happening between you\nand that person you know and you you\ncommunicate your needs and your feelings\nmore directly and they might change but\nthey also might not\nchange either they can alter or you can\nalter with them and so that's something\nthat you really need to figure out as\nfar as each situation goes if you you\nknow can't leave where you were cuz\nmaybe you've got got a really great job\nin a a neighborhood where there's you\nknow village where there's not many\npeople there whatever it is can you\nchange your working conditions\naround can you alter the situation can\nyou make sure that that person who's\nstressing you out you might not be able\nto fully avoid them but can you alter\nthe way that they talk to you can you\nalter how much you see them see what you\ncan do to try to alter the situation the\nnext a is accept sometimes you cannot\navoid a situation sometimes you cannot\nalter a situation\nand in these these cases right here\nacceptance is really really crucial\nacceptance though this is important I\nwant you to understand this acceptance\nof some situations doesn't mean that you\ndenying\nyourself a lot of times though our\nstress doesn't come from the situation\nourself itself our situation comes from\nus not accepting we want the world to be\ndifferent than it is we want someone\nelse to be different than it is and then\nwe say it's not what I want it to be so\ntherefore I'm stressed out when in\nreality you would be less stressed out\nif you would just accept the situation\nyou would be less stressed out if you\njust accepted that that's how that\nperson is and not try to mentally fight\nthem or fight the situation and once\nagain like I said acceptance doesn't\nmean that you're denying yourself\nacceptance also doesn't mean pretending\nthat you don't feel how you feel it's\nacknowledging\nthat it's okay to feel that way you know\nsomebody comes in and they say something\nto you and they're just Brash or rude or\nhowever it is well they might come in\nthey might be rude and we don't want\nthem to be rude but there's a situation\nwhere they're rude and there's another\nsituation which is we don't want them to\nbe rude and you can't change other\npeople so sometimes if you just accept\nthat they're rude and you accept that\nthat's how they are it's a lot less\nstressed because you're not having two\nbattles of they're rude and you don't\nwant them to be rude it's just like oh\nthey're rude I'm going to accept it\nwhatever can't change them but I'm not\ngoing to let this person's energy affect\nmine I'm not going to let this person's\njudgments or feelings those are not my\nfeelings I'm not taking on somebody\nelse's feelings get out of here I got my\nown feelings I got to worry about and\nit's just saying hey I'm not going to\ntake on what what that other person is\nor saying or doing or how they are you\nknow somebody screwed you over in the\npast you can hold resentment forever if\nyou want to cool see how that works for\nyou dude or you can accept it and you\ncan move on there's so many people that\nare stressed out\ntoday like incredibly stressed out today\nover something that happened to them two\nyears ago 5 years ago 12 years ago it's\nlike that phrase these mountains that\nyou're carrying you were only meant to\nclimb you don't have to take this stuff\nwith you it's like the another example\nthat pops in my head I've used this this\nstory a few times but there's a old\nparable of of two monks walking through\na forest and uh they walk by a river and\nthere's a lady that's trying to get\nacross the river and she can't really\nget across by herself and one of the\nmonks walks up to her and he says ma'am\ndo you need help across the river she's\nlike yes I do and so he picks her up\nwalks across the river you know walks\nthrough the river and drops her off on\nthe other side then he goes back across\nthe river goes back to his little monk\nfriend and they start walking and about\nan hour later the other monk who who\ndidn't pick the lady up says he's like\nbrother you know that we swore to to to\nnot touch anyone else to not touch\nsomeone of the opposite sex and you just\npick that woman up and he's like I\ndropped her off an hour ago you're still\nholding on to her and so it's this thing\nof like he was this this happened in the\npast he was just helping somebody across\nbut the other guy who was watching it\nhappen was so caught in his mind of like\nyou did something wrong and it was like\nHey that happened I dropped her across\nthe river an hour ago you've been\nholding on to her this entire time and\nso it's it's that kind of thing of just\nlike maybe you've put yourself through\nenough stress and sometimes just\nforgiveness is what's needed and you\ndon't forgive somebody for for their\nsake you give somebody for your sake\nwhen you forgive someone you're\nreleasing yourself from the stress and\nthe energy of resenting or blaming that\nperson you're also like forgiving\nyourself too and you know I don't want\nto go too deep into forgiveness because\nI have an episode if you just Google and\nscroll back if you want to find my\nepisode on forgiveness you definitely\ncan it's much better than just this\nquick little summarization but if you\nneed to forgive you need to forgive if\nyou messed up at a relationship you know\nthey broke up with you and you and you\ndid something you think oh I'm so stupid\nI can't believe I screwed up I'm not\nworthy of anyone else's love so instead\nof thinking like that it's like hey I\nmessed up I learned I forgive myself\nI'll never do it\nagain A lot of times sure we need to\nforgive other people but more than\nanything else we need to forgive\nourselves just do better next time\nthat's fine and then the last a is adapt\nwe need to do our best to face stress\nand then figure out a way to adapt to it\nthere's no such thing as a world without\nstressors it's just about we need to be\nbetter so long-term Stress Management\nreally involves us adapting to\nunavoidable stressors yeah we can change\nall of them and get rid of all the other\nones that we can but there are some\nunavoidable stressors that are going to\nbe in our life that means altering our\nperspective to view the stressors as\nchallenges rather than like a crisis so\ntherefore we see it as a challenge and\nwe become more resilient by working\nthrough it just get\nbetter I have this this note card that's\nright next to me when I work every\nsingle day and it just says be better\njust be better if you want your life to\nbe better be better if you're not good\nenough at something be better just just\nmake sure that every single day you keep\nleveling up yourself get better don't\nask the world to cater to you don't ask\nthe world to cater to you if you're\nwanting the World to Change for you\nyou're going to have a really hard life\nbecause the world's not going to change\nfor you and then so what you do is you\ntake your Journal out and you start\nwriting through these things and you\nwant to create a stress journal and it\ncan be a really really highly effective\nstrategy for Stress Management what\nyou're going to want to do is this okay\nyou're going to want to identify your\ntriggers you're going to want to\nunderstand your emotional responses and\nthen you want to develop coping\nmechanisms for those so the idea of this\nis to learn yourself\nto sit down with a pen and paper and\nwrite down what triggers me what is\ntriggering me what's triggering me right\nnow when you find yourself stressed take\nout a pen and paper and write it all\ndown I know most people listening are\nnot going to do this because it's you\njust a lot of times it's in one ear and\nout the other but I promise you if you\ndo this it will absolutely change your\nlife whenever you're stressed out\nwhenever you're triggered whenever\nsomething's going on take out a pen and\npaper and get all of it out of your head\nand get it onto a piece of paper ask\nyourself what is trigger what is\ntriggering me right now ask yourself\nwhat do you feel I feel this way ask\nyourself why do you feel that way well I\nfeel this way because of XYZ and then\nask yourself what can you do about it\nyou will learn more about yourself than\nyou ever have you'll start to see\ntriggers before they come up and you'll\nbe able to navigate them way better and\nyou'll start to develop coping\nmechanisms when you do get stressed out\nwhen you do get triggered when you do\nget stressed when you do get anxious\nwhatever it might be just instead of\ngetting all wrapped up in it what I want\nyou to do is get curious you know there\nshould be no judgment in this instead\ntake a really compassionate curious\napproach and just start to get curious\nabout yourself when you Journal through\nthese things and start to figure out\nwhat's going on internally inside of you\nin your head and your body all the\nfeelings that you have journaling could\nbe a really really good emotional\nresponse dump all of your feelings all\nof your thoughts onto a piece of paper\nand work through them when it's in your\nhead it's really hard to process when\nit's on paper\nit can be planned and it can be worked\nthrough I always say it everything in\nthis world is figure out I don't think\nit's a real word but everything is\nfigure aable can you just figure out how\nyou can can you just look at your your\nthoughts and your feelings and say I'm\ngoing to start to figure these out I'm\ngoing to start to see these before they\ncome up so I don't have to worry about\nthem anymore ultimately this is really\nreally important if you want to have a\nless anxious less stress life go through\nthese four different A's and start to\nmake a plan so that you can start to\nhave an A an actual step-by-step process\nof how you each and every one of you go\nthrough your Stress and Anxiety a little\nbit better so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on Instagram\nstories tag me
