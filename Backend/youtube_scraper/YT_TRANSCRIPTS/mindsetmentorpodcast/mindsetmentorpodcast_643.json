    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout stopping all the [ __ ]\nyep we're gonna go there we're going to\ntalk about how to stop all the BS that\ngoes on in your mind all day long and\nhold you back from creating the life\nthat you truly want and I'm going to\ngive you a tip that one of my mentors\ngave me a couple years ago that is so\nridiculously simple but helps so much\nwhenever you notice yourself getting\ncaught up in all of the BS and one of\nthe things that I hear most from people\nis how they're not doing what they need\nto do they're not taking the action\nthat's required to create the life that\nthey want to\nbecause simply something of the going on\nin their mind whether it's fears whether\nit's limiting beliefs whether it's you\nknow creating a future in their mind\nthat they're afraid of they're not\ncreating the life they want\nsimply because of what's going on in\ntheir mind\nand I want you to realize think about\nthis for a second what's the biggest\nthing that you're afraid of like what is\nyour number one fear that is holding you\nback from creating the life that you\nwant\nthink about that bring it to the front\nof your mind real quick\ndo you want to know a secret about that\nthing do you want to know a secret of\nhow to overcome it let's tell you this\ndo you want to know a secret to\novercoming your biggest fear I'm not\ntalking about like the fear of spiders\nor the fear of heights I'm talking about\nlike the fear of failure the fear of\nsuccess the fear of not being good\nenough fear of other people's opinions\nor judgment whatever it might be\nnone of it is real\nthe secret to overcoming it is you can't\nbecause you cannot overcome something\nthat does not exist the only thing that\nyou start doing is stop paying attention\nto it stop creating the fear stop the\nonly problem is that you have a problem\nyou have created the problem the only\nproblems that exist here what are the\nproblems that you have created and so\nwhen you really start to think about\nthat you take a step back you realize\nthat the fear of failure the fear of\nsuccess the fear of other people's\nopinions the fear of judgment the fear\nof of not being good enough you cannot\nhold them physically in your hands and\nif you can't hold them physically in\nyour hands they're not real they're not\ntangible which means they're just a\nfigment of your imagination\nisn't that crazy the only problem with\nthe problems that you're creating in\nyour own mind\nand so you're holding yourself back from\ncreating the life that you want if you\ndon't know like I've worked with you\nknow over the past 17 years many many\ndifferent people I've worked with a lot\nof business owners and consulted with\nbusiness owners and had masterminds\naround business owners and helping them\ngrow and one of the things that I notice\nwith them is that the reason why their\nbusiness is not growing and scaling to\nthe capacity they really want it to is\nbecause of them they are the bottleneck\nnothing else not the government not uh\nyou know shipping costs none of those\nthings they are the problem in their\nbusiness\nthey're the bottleneck and so they the\nthe bottleneck usually comes from things\nin their mind and this isn't just for\nbusiness owners this is for everybody\nbut it's things like overthinking\nit's things like negative self-talk it's\nthings like what do I deserve to be\nsuccessful what do I deserve to create\nthe life of my dreams it's too many\nfears in their head it's afraid of what\nthe future might hold it's being scared\nof not being accepted by other people\nit's not wanting to stand out it's blah\nblah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nit's just a bunch of BS and it's all\njust completely made up in their head\noverthinking you can't physically hold\nit negative self-talk you can't\nphysically hold it fears that are\nsitting inside of your head you can't\nhold it afraid of what the future might\nbe can't hold it scared of not being\naccepted can't hold it not wanting to\nstand out you can't hold you literally\ncannot hold any of these things\nso that shows you it's not really right\nin front of you\nlike when I'm looking at my hands I can\nsee my hands my hands are real my hands\nare here they are physically in this\nuniverse but my thoughts\nI'm just creating them and so if I'm\ncreating them\nI'm creating them if I'm creating them\nmaybe I should either stop creating them\nor I should create new ones because I am\ncreating my thoughts you are creating\nyour thoughts so if you don't like your\nthoughts change your thoughts stop\ncreating the ones that you have and\nbecause of this because of what's going\non in people's heads they wake up and\nthey think about what they don't want\nimmediately they think about that they\ndon't want to wake up they think about\nthey want to sleep in\nthey think about that they don't want to\nhave a crappy day today they think about\nthat they don't want to feel uh\nworthless today they think that they\nthink about how they don't want to fear\nof failure today they think about what\nthey don't want what they don't want\nwhat they don't want what they don't\nwant what they don't all day long\nthat doesn't really give you much space\nto create the future you want does it\nwhen you're thinking about you don't\nwant all of the time there's no space to\nthink about what it is that you do want\nto create the future that you want\nbecause you will end up somewhere in\nlife\nlike five years from now if we're all\nblessed to be here in five years\nhopefully we are hopefully I am\nhopefully everyone listening to this is\ngoing to be here in five years you will\nbe somewhere\nwhere you are in five years\nis going to be solely based off of what\nyou think about and the actions that you\ntake\nsure there's some circumstances so\nthere's some things that could happen to\nyou that are outside of your control\nthere's weather there's things that\nhappen all that type of stuff there's\nthings that happen that are outside of\nyour control but 99 of it is in your\ncontrol as far as what you think about\nand also what you do\nyou'll end up somewhere and where you\nend up is solely based on whatever is\nthat you do\nwhether you actively realize it and work\non it or not\nbut most people usually don't actively\nwork on themselves they usually don't\nactively work on what's going on their\nmind they usually don't pay attention to\nevery single thought that goes to their\nhead\nand where you are right now\nis because of all the actions that you\ntook in the pla the past where you are\nright now is based off of you are where\nyou are right now because of all the\nactions that you took in the past\nthere's no one else to blame if you're\none of the people I used to be this way\nthat makes excuses all the time and\nblames everybody else for why they\naren't where they want to be I was that\nperson for a very long time I'm going to\njust tell you as a recovering\nexcusaholic and as a recovering person\nwho blamed everybody else there is no\none else to blame\nif you like where you are it's because\nyou took good actions in the past\nawesome high five hell yeah great job if\nyou don't like where you are it's\nbecause of the actions that you took in\nthe past\nyou might not have taken the right\nactions maybe you took the wrong actions\nmaybe you decided to take the easy route\nand now you're kicking yourself in the\nass for taking the easy route because\nyou decided not to take the hard route\nthat was challenging that was outside of\nyour comfort zone that required you to\ngrow into a new version of yourself\nbut all the worries and all the fears\nand all the living beliefs and all the\noverthinking it's all in your head\nthat's where it is that's where it lives\nnone of it is in this reality\nyou think that it is because it feels\nlike it is but it's not\nit's all false it's all in your mind\nit's not physical it's not in this\nreality it's on your head so let me give\nyou a tip\ntalk to yourself the moment that you\nstart to notice the thoughts that you\ndon't enjoy out loud\nas if you're talking to somebody else\nso talk to yourself in the moment out\nloud as if you're talking to someone\nelse let me explain what I mean by that\nyou know sometimes you ever have a a\nnight where you wake up you go to the\nbathroom in the middle of the night and\nyou have a thought come into your head\nabout work or your to-do list or\nsomething you forgot to do and you're\nyou're going to the bathroom\nand one thought comes into your head and\nthen you lay back down because you have\nthat one thought it brings another\nthought it brings another thought and\nbrings another thought and now you're up\nfor 20 minutes 30 minutes an hour\nsometimes like this has happened to me\nmany times where\nwake up go to the bathroom\nand then I'm sitting in bed and I'm\nthinking about all the stuff we got to\ndo all this you know the podcast\nregretto chord stuff we got to do for\nthe team all of these things that are\njust coming up down the line events that\nwe're going to be starting to do in\nperson all all these ideas and all these\nto-do lists and everything comes into my\nhead and once my brain clicks into the\nmode of work of get stuff done of\ncreativity\nit's off like a horse race like it's\nreally hard to stop it my brain can go\ninto to-do list my brain can go into\nideas my brain can go into oh [ __ ] I\nforgot to do this the things I need to\ndo the things I forgot to do ideas and\nsometimes I'll be laying in bed this\ndoesn't happen as much as you used to\nabout a year or two ago it's happening a\nlittle bit more\nbut it was literally like I'd be in bed\nand then it would happen\nonce every couple months I'd wake up and\nthen I'd be up for two hours two hours\nhave passed I can't fall back asleep one\nof my mentors taught me this tip when I\ntold him about it and I was like that's\nnot gonna work I was like that's so\nsimple that it's stupid\nand he's like just try it man try it\nnext time and just see how it goes and\nhe said say out loud to yourself not\nright now\nwhen you start noticing your brain go go\ngo go go go go say not right now\nI was like all right I'll give it a shot\nand guess what\nit works it's so stupid and so simple\nsomehow it works and sometimes the\nthoughts are gone and I fall asleep and\nsometimes I have to say not right now\nand then I get another thought I'm like\nnah right now I get another thought I'm\nlike not right now and I have to say it\na few different times and eventually\nit's like it's like you know telling\nyour dog to sit and it sits and it\nstands back up and it sits it stands\nback up and telling it to sit it stands\nback up and eventually it's like all\nright fine we're just gonna play this\ngame I'll just lay down that's kind of\nhow your brain ends up working and since\nI've learned this I explained this to so\nmany different people and it's worked\nfor that and then I've used it in other\nareas of my life and so you can try it\nnot just in this waking up and going on\nto-do lists so what you can use this in\nother places is you if you notice\nyourself talking [ __ ] to yourself in\nyour own head what you do is you stop\nthe BS in the moment like you stop it\nand you talk to yourself as if there's\nsomeone else in the room it might sound\na little bit weird but you talk to\nyourself as if there's somebody else in\nthe room and you stop in the middle of\nall of the the negative self-talk and\nsay that's not true stop lying to me I\ndon't accept the words that you're\nsaying and you literally speak\nphysically into this universe\nthe words that you want to say versus\nwhat you've been saying in your head\nthat's not true stop lying to me I don't\naccept the words that you are saying\nand you talk to yourself if you're\nsaying oh you're such a you're so\nunlovable and you're saying in your head\nyou're so in love but it's like I I'm\nnot unlovable I do deserve love from\nother people\nand you actually physically out loud\nspeak to other people speak to other\nquote unquote the way that you speak to\nother people is you're what you're going\nto speak to yourself out loud you know\nif you own a business and you're sitting\nthere you think about how the business\nmight fail my business is going to fail\nbecause you know my other business has\nfailed so many people do this oh it's\ngoing to fail because I'm not qualified\nI'm not smart enough I don't know what I\nwas thinking when I started this\nbusiness\nbut you're sitting side inside right now\nyour retail Shop's doing fine your\nlights are on you're paying the bills\nit's BS stop the BS in the moment this\nis not true I do not accept this this is\nan imagined future of this business\nfailing and I do not accept the business\nfailing this business will succeed and\nyou talk to yourself out loud the words\nthat you want to reprogram yourself to\nbelieve\nbring the facts into your brain not the\nimaginary you know like a lot of people\nlike I said like you'll be sitting\ninside of your retail shop it's doing\nfine you're paying the bills maybe\nyou're not a multi-millionaire inside of\nyour retail shop but you've you're\npaying the bills lights are on things\nare going pretty decent you're able to\npay a couple employees you're able to\nkeep your bills paid at home and you\nstart thinking about failing and failing\nand failing and failing and failing\nbring the facts to your brain not the\nimaginary the business is not failing\nright now the bills are paid bring the\npresent moment where bring yourself to\nthe present moment where everything is\nokay everything is just fine you are\nsafe the way that you are if you're\nstarting to get anxious about something\nyou know another way you can use this if\nyou know yourself getting anxious first\noff anxiety comes from you imagining a\nfuture\nso your anxiety is coming because you're\nimagining some sort of future\nno one has anxiety because they're\nimagining an amazing future they have\nanxiety because they're imagine a future\nthat is scary to them stop the BS in the\nmoment the future that you're imagining\nis not true what do you say to yourself\nThis is not true right now I am safe\nright now I am 100 safe and right now I\nam grateful for whatever it is that\nyou're grateful for right now I am\ngrateful for my family right now I'm\ngrateful for my health right now I'm\ngrateful that I woke up this morning\nstop the BS in the moment and out loud\ntalk to yourself with the stuff that you\nwant to actually believe that is the\ntruth\nyou've got to stop it while it's\nhappening you've got to learn to bring\nyourself to the present moment stop\nimagining these fake Futures that don't\nexist because everything is fine in the\npresent moment right now you are okay\nright now you are fine in this present\nmoment and you might say oh but I'm\nworried about paying my bills next week\nthat's next week that's not today\nnot in this present moment\nthat's next week so what can you do\nright now to get yourself in a good\nstate so that you are going to be able\nto pay your bills and worrying ain't\ngonna pay the bills\nI've never seen somebody be able to pay\ntheir bills with you know worry\nbeing right in this moment\nallows you to be able to take action to\nhelp you pay the bills you've got to be\nable to stop all of the BS realize that\nyou are\nthe person that's holding you back you\nare the reason why you're not where you\nwant to be you can be your greatest\nenemy or you can be your best friend and\nit usually comes down to you paying\nattention what you're thinking paying\nattention what you're saying paying\nattention to the Future that you're\nimagining pay attention to every little\nthought that goes through your head if\nyou could understand the magnitude that\nyour thoughts have on the actions that\nyou take the way that you feel the life\nthat you create the future that you\ncreate you would pay way you would have\na a hardcore filter on every single\nthought that goes through your head so\nstop all the BS right now\nnone of this is true stop lying to me to\nyourself this is all imagined you're\nsafe\nand when you notice those pesky thoughts\npesky thoughts pesky thoughts push them\naway not right now\nnope not right now we're not doing this\nright now go away\nnot right now going back to sleep not\nright now I'm trying to be productive\nnot right now I'm trying to get a\nworking in not right now none of this is\ntrue stop lying to yourself this is what\nI believe you start talking yourself out\nloud the way that you actually want to\ntalk to yourself in your head so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's
