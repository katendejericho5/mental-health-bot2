    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to win at\nlife I'm going to give you a very simple\ntip to become successful into\nessentially\nbeat out all any competition that you\nmight have going into the future I'm\ngoing to talk about how to quickly get\nahead of everyone else and if I'm being\nhonest with you it's really not that\ndifficult today we're going to talk\nabout how to get light years ahead of\neverybody\nbut in a very very short period of time\nwhen you look at the world\nwhere do you see it's going what do you\nnotice\none of the things that I like to do is I\nlike to look at the world I like to look\nat people I like to look at mindsets I\nlike to look at actions of people and I\nlike to see if I can pull some patterns\nand start to notice thing about things\nabout people but when I look at the\nworld\nI notice a lot of things but one thing\nthat's becoming very very obvious this\npoint in time is that humans are\nbecoming more and more addicted to\ntechnology they're becoming more and\nmore addicted to their TV screens to\ntheir computer screens to their phone\nscreens and what I'm starting to notice\nthat if you're somebody who's trying to\nget ahead in life\nif you can do the exact opposite of\neverybody else you're going to be able\nto get light years ahead like if you\nwere to go back 50 years ago and it\nwould be like the 1970s and you were\ncompeting against other people or\ncompeting against other business owners\nor competing against other people in you\nknow your career\nit's kind of an even playing field\nbut what's really interesting about\nright now is that it's not really an\neven playing field and the reason why is\nbecause everybody is becoming more and\nmore addicted to technology\nso if you can distance yourself from\nthat technology\nand stop being entertained all the time\nyou could get light years ahead of\neverybody else and so how do you do it\nstart trading\nYour Entertainment\nfor education\nstart trading all of the time that you\nwould normally be entertaining yourself\nand start educating yourself in whatever\nit is that you want to educate yourself\non whatever it is that you want to get\nfurther ahead start becoming better at\nsomething like for instance if if I were\nto say hey you know what I've decided I\nwant to be one of the best guitar\nplayers in the world and I were to say\nokay if I think the average person's on\ntheir phone all the time they're on\nNetflix all the time\nif the average person's doing 3.2 hours\nper day on Netflix in 4.1 hours per day\non their phone and 2.2 2 hours and 25\nminutes of that phone is on social media\nif I just decide to distance myself from\nNetflix to distance myself from social\nmedia and go you know what I'm just\ngoing to play guitar for those hours I\nwill be light years ahead of people\nwithin a year way further ahead fast\nforward five years not a\ncompetition not even close and so you've\ngot to start trading if you want to get\nreally far ahead have everybody else\naround you everybody else in this world\nstart trading your entertainment for\neducating yourself\nif you're like you know what I want to\nbecome the best therapist in the world\nokay well when most people are scrolling\nthrough Instagram when most people are\non Netflix why don't you spend that time\nreading your textbooks going through and\nworking with your clients trying to\nbecome better at it taking time and and\nyou know when your clients leave instead\nof going oh you know what I'm gonna do\nI'm gonna scroll on Instagram for a\nlittle while you actually go back and\nyou if you have a recording of your your\ntime with them you listen to it you see\nhow you can improve how you can get\nbetter if you're uh trying to be\nsomebody who builds a following online\nwell you know you could scroll through\nInstagram and try to find you know see\nother people who are your competition\nentertain yourself or you could say how\ncan I become the Best Entertainer\nthrough the medium of video that I can\npossibly become maybe you take some\nacting classes maybe you take some\nimprov classes maybe you take\nToastmasters in some speech classes\nthere's many things that you can do to\nmake yourself better\nwhen the average person is just getting\nsucked into their phone and not\nrealizing it and they're mindlessly\ngoing into Netflix and not realizing it\nif you want to dominate any industry\ntrade your entertainment for Education\nthe human tentious ban in the past 20\nyears has gone down 33 percent\nwant to become a superhuman trade that\nentertainment for education in taking\naction when most people are looking at\ncat videos on Tick Tock and people\ntrying to you know chug an entire Sprite\non Tick Tock you are becoming smarter\nyou're becoming better you are working\non yourself\nyou are reading a book what other people\nare looking at cat videos and dogs dog\nvideos on Instagram and Tick Tock you're\ntaking action in your business when your\ncompetition is trying to be entertained\nby other people making funny videos like\nif you really take a step back\nand you look at Instagram and Tick Tock\nand all of these different platforms\nlet's be real\nthey're pretty freaking stupid aren't\nthey\nlike if you want to grow your business\non them if that's great if you want to\ngrow your following on them that's great\nbut sitting there and actually\nmindlessly being entertained is a waste\nof your life\nyou have to take a step back and really\nstart to see what's going on\nif you look at your phone and you see\nthat you're on your phone five hours a\nday six hours a day seven hours a day\ncould you figure out a way to trade that\ntime to improve yourself\nI'm seeing what people are doing and I'm\ntrying to do the opposite that's not\nsaying that I don't scroll on Instagram\nevery once in a while still do but if I\nnotice myself in the middle of a scroll\nand I'm like you know what\nis this helping me get closer to my\ngoals like is this getting me closer to\nor further from my goals\nif I'm sitting there and I'm researching\nother people and what they're putting\nout and how I can make my content better\nyeah sure that's good but if I'm sitting\nthere and I'm watching you know somebody\nput up videos of their dogs doing stupid\nstuff as entertaining as that might be\nis that helping me become better is that\nhelping me distance myself in my\ncompetition is that helping like am I\never going to be on my deathbed and be\nlike you know what I wish I would I wish\nthat my biggest regret is I wish I would\nhave watched more cat videos on\nInstagram when I was younger there's\nnever going to be that feeling of I wish\nI would have watched more cat videos I\nwish I would have spent more time\nlooking at other people put on makeup on\nInstagram when I was 27 years old like\nthere will never be that moment it'll\nonly be man there was this this limited\nfinite amount of time that I had to to\ngrow myself and to become the best\nversion of myself whatever even if I\nlived to 100 years I only had this\nfinite amount of time these hundred\nyears to become the best version of\nmyself to grow to expand to experience\nas many things as possible and I wasted\nyears of my life\njust trying to entertain myself\ntrying to be entertained now mind you I\ndo want to take a step back and I'll say\nthis being entertained is not a problem\nthere's nothing wrong with it there's\nnothing wrong with any of this stuff but\nif you're trying to get ahead in life if\nyou're trying to get yourself out of a\nrut if you're trying to grow a business\nif you're trying to make yourself better\nif you're trying to get out of your\nanxiety then spending time on these\nplatforms is not helping you get better\nit's really not\nyou could still spend time on them but\ngive yourself a limited amount of time\n30 minutes a day yeah you can do\nwhatever you want maybe you just go you\nknow what the only time I can scroll on\nInstagram is when I'm pooping maybe\nthat's what you do I don't really know\nwhat it is maybe you just go hey\nbathroom time that's your Instagram time\nwhen you're pooping when you're peeing\nyou do as much instagramming as you want\nbut when you leave that bathroom now you\ncan actually work on yourself\nthink about that for a second because\nwhen I look at the world and I look at\nwhere everyone else is going I'm going\nman I'm starting to see this pattern\neveryone's becoming more and more and\nmore and more addicted to their phone so\nif I want to set myself apart what I do\nis I do the exact opposite of everybody\nelse is doing I never want to follow the\npack because I don't know about you guys\nthe pack just seems so if you follow the\nyou know like a sheep you just follow\nall the Sheep you're just one of the\nother sheep that follows other sheep\nWhere do sheep usually go to sheep\nusually go the slaughterhouse I'm trying\nto distance myself from all of that\nI see what people are doing I'm trying\nto do the opposite as much as possible\nnow you know I'm not saying that you\nshould turn in your cell phone and use a\nlandline use all of them but just start\nbeing more intentional as to what you're\nusing it for and how often you're\nactually using it\nso instead of letting yourself fall into\nyour phone because we all know those\nthings are extremely addicting\nand falling into TV and realizing that\nyou've been watching Netflix for the\npast four hours or fall into the\nmetaverse like you're never going you're\nhonestly never going to see me buy a\na a way to get into a virtual reality\nnot because I don't think virtual\nreality is great but because I actually\njust don't care enough\nto go into it you know like virtual\nreality can become whatever it's going\nto be I've played some virtual reality\nGames they're fun they're awesome\nthey're you know kind of nuts how\namazing that they are but when I look at\nwhat I want my life to be\nthis is just me not judging anybody\ngoing into virtual reality and playing\nvideo games does not line up with my\nultimate life purpose\nam I saying video games aren't fun no of\ncourse I'm not saying that what I'm\nsaying is buying a video game console is\nnot going to help me become a better\nversion of myself is the way that I see\nit I've decided to stop being so much of\na consumer and try to be more of a\nCreator so when I'm using those\nplatforms when I'm using a platform I'm\ntrying to think to myself am I just\nconsuming consuming consuming consuming\nconsuming or am I creating\nright so like I listened to to podcasts\nI put a i i watch YouTube videos I I\nscroll on Instagram I do all those\nthings but on all of those platforms I'm\nalso creating all the time I'm also\ncreating podcasts all the time also\ncreating YouTube videos all the time I'm\ncreating reels and I'm creating content\nfor social media and creating content\nfor Instagram and Tick Tock and\neverything that's out there I'm creating\nall this content so I take a step back\nand I say am I just being a constant\nconsumer or am I being a creator\nand with all the things that I'm doing I\nknow that if I go and I get sucked into\nany of them they're making me more\ndistracted and less focused more\ndistracted and less focused more\ndistracting less focused so when you\nlook at like I said the average\nattention span has gone down by 33\npercent in the past 20 years since the\ninvention of smartphones\ndo we think it's only going to get do we\nthink it's gonna get better do we think\nthat other people are going to get\nbetter probably not because most people\ndon't take a step back and actually look\nat what's going on you know I've noticed\nwhen I look at my phone it makes me more\nanxious throughout the day there's\nactually a whole lot of studies that are\nnow being linked right now to the the\nrise in people's ADD and ADHD being\nlinked to how much they're using their\nphones and so it's not like something\nthat they were just born with but people\nare actually starting to neurobiologists\nare actually starting to look at this\nstarting to notice that people are\nactually starting to make themselves\ngiving themselves ADD and ADHD by how\nmuch they use their phones so I'm trying\nto constantly remove myself from these\nthings I'm trying to consciously go you\nknow what is this making me better now\nthis isn't going to say like I don't\nenjoy watching Netflix I do but it's\njust how much time am I giving myself on\nit like I love watching succession\nI love watching Tai lasso I loved\nwatching all these different series that\nI've gone through Game of Thrones all of\nthat but it's like do I want to spend\nfour hours a day\ngoing and watching episode one and two\nand three and four of Game of Thrones no\ncould you give yourself one episode sure\nearn the episode is it a possibility\nwhere me maybe you can go you know what\nI'm going to treat myself like if you\nreally love a show that's fine to love a\nshow it's fine to be entertained but not\nwatching four of them in a row probably\nprobably right but mind you I'm speaking\nto myself as much as I'm speaking to you\nbecause I've noticed myself do this as\nwell where it's like okay if I get my\nthings done then I want a day if I get\nmy my number one most important thing\ndone that I needed to focus on today I'm\ngonna reward myself with one episode of\nwhatever it is that you love watching\nbut if I spend 4.1 hours a day on my\nphone\nand I'm 37 years old and I hope to live\nto 90 you know that's 53 more years\nbut if I spend 4.1 like the average\nperson spends 4.1 hours a day on their\nphone like this is what's crazy you\nready if I spend four hours a day on my\nphone like the average person does I'm\n37 now let's say I live to 90. that's 54\n53 more years that is\n9.2 years of my life\non my phone\nwhat the hell\nthat's nine years of my life scrolling\nand looking at other people's\nlooking at videos on Tick Tock people\nputting up uh posters and photos of them\ntraveling with their family and people\nbitching on one side to another side\nit's like you're you're never going to\nget to the end of your life and go you\nknow what I spent nine years of my life\non my phone I wish it would have been\nmore\nyou're probably going to sit there and\nthink\nyou know what I wish I would have spent\nso much time on my phone I wish I would\nhave been more present with my kids I\nwish I would have worked harder I wish I\nwould have traveled more I wish I would\nhave gone on more hikes I should have\nexperienced more things I wish I would\nhave had more hobbies that I created\nmaybe I wanted to learn how to play an\ninstrument maybe I wanted to become a\npilot and learn how to fly a plane what\na waste nine years of of if I am just\naveraged at the age that I am right now\nif I live to 90 and I'm the average\nperson that spends four hours a day on\ntheir phone that will be nine years of\nmy life spent on my phone staring at a\nscreen\nthat's wild\nwhatever reason I've been trying to do\nis trying to leave my phone in the\nkitchen drawer like leave it away from\nme not even put it next to me leave it\nfurther away from me because when it's\nnot around I don't think about as much\nbut when it's within Arm's Reach I feel\nmy attention being pulled towards it\nand then I checked my phone when I need\nto I go into the kitchen I check my\nphone and put it right back down that's\nhow I've been distancing myself I've\nbeen trying to watch my screen kind of\ntime go down if you have an iPhone\nthere's an app you know widget called\nscreen time what actually shows you how\nmuch time you're spending on your screen\nevery single day and I take that widget\nI actually put on the home screen so\nit's the very first thing that I see\nwhen I open up my phone and I try to\nmake that number go lower and lower and\nlower and lower and lower\nand so you know I've gotten my phone\ntime down to around two hours on average\nper day and I run my entire business on\nmy phone you know huge amount of people\nin my company don't live at most people\nin my company don't live in Austin so my\nphone is needed\nbut how can you start to look at it and\nsay okay\nI'm going to trade my entertainment for\nEducation I'm going to trade watching\nthese videos to becoming better to\nlearning that instrument to getting\nbetter at a hobby to spending more time\nwith my children spending more time with\nmy spouse or taking\nmore time to meditate or work out or\nwhatever it is that you want to do\nis what I'm doing right now getting\ncloser to or further from our goals how\ncan you take action that moves the\nneedle in your life instead of just\ntrying to be entertained trade your your\nentertainment for Education I'm not\nsaying never be entertained I'm just\nsaying try to lower it a little bit\nright try to become a little bit better\nwith each day\nyou know would you rather watch cat\nvideos or would you rather work hard and\nwatch a sunset in Greece because you\ntook action in the past and created an\namazing life cat videos or Greek sunsets\nwhich one do you want can you distance\nyourself and become more like a\nsuperhuman over the coming years because\npeople only need to get more and more\nand more and more addicted to their\nphones the more she could pull yourself\nback from it the more that you are going\nto be like a superhuman\npeople are going to be going into the\nmetaverse I guess is what people are\ntalking about personally it's gonna be\nhonest I'm not taking part of it I like\nthe Universe I live in it's pretty damn\nawesome I'd rather traveling to amazing\nplaces than sit on my couch and you know\npretend I'm an amazing place\nI'd rather eat pasta in Italy than\nvirtually play tennis with somebody\nthat's in a different city than me\nthe way the world is going is towards\nthat it looks like I'm planning ahead\nand I'm making plans saying that's not\nreally what I want to do I'm not\nresisting it I'm just saying oh that's\njust not what I want to do it's not\nreally that everybody can do whatever it\nis they want but I'm just telling you my\npoint of view of where where I see it\ngoing and where I see myself going\nyou know I'm just watching it the future\nwill become whatever it's going to\nbecome but I'm planning on how I can get\nmyself ahead\nso that when I look at myself compared\nto everybody else years down the road\nI'm going you know what go back goes\nback to one of my phrases my very first\nMentor you should always say I will do\ntoday what other people will not so that\nwhen you fast forward into the future I\ncan do what other people can't I'll do\ntoday with other people will not so that\nI can do later on in the future what\nother people can't that's really what it\ncomes down to can you trade your\nentertainment for education and get\nyourself light years ahead of everybody\nelse so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nshare it on your Instagram stories so\nthat more people out there can hear this\nwho are on Instagram and maybe we can\npull them out of that entertainment to\nstart helping them get better as well\nand with that I'm Gonna Leave You the\nsame way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomebody else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
