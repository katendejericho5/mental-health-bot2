    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to find the opportunities for\ngrowth in every single thing that you do\nand so when you really dive into it\nwe're going to be talking about one of\nthe biggest Hang-Ups that I see that\nstop people from taking the action that\nthey need to to go and create the life\nthat they want and really what it comes\ndown to is what you focus on and what\nwhat lens you look at the world through\nand so if you can Master this it will be\nmuch much easier to take action\nif there's one thing that I see from\npeople is it is so damn hard for people\nto take action to create the life that\nthey want not because the action is hard\nto create the life they want it's\nbecause their mindset around the action\nseems hard to them it's not really that\ndifficult for people to go and do the\nthings they need to do to create the\nlife that they want it's not it Just\nrequires physical body to move and do\nthings and whether that's lift weights\nwhether that's grow a business it's\nreally not hard what makes it hard is\nthe way that you are viewing it and so\nit's not really that hard to stop doing\nthe things that you need to stop doing\nit's really not that hard to start doing\nthe things that you need to start doing\nyou are holding yourself back and really\nwhat it comes down to is looking the the\nway that you look at the world and so\nyou know there's there's many things\nthat you could think about like one of\nthe things I think about\nis the quote\num you know do you think the universe is\nhappening everything in the universe is\nhappening to you or do you think that's\nhappening for you A lot of people think\nthat it's happening to them which puts\nthem in a place of being a victim but if\nyou decide that the world is happening\nyou know the universe everything that's\nhappening is happening for you\nspecifically as if this is a video game\nand the video game is built specifically\nfor you to grow into who you want to be\nwhen challenges come to you you see the\nworld a whole lot differently if I'm\nlooking at the world as everything is\nhappening to me then when something\nhappens to me it's like oh this is\nhappening to me again like this is this\nis the way that it is and it puts me in\na state of being a victim when I look at\nit as it's happening for me I can look\nat everything whether it's good or\nchallenging and be like you know what\nthis is brought to me specifically for\nme to grow\nand one person that definitely knew this\nwas Einstein Einstein there's a couple\nquotes that he says that really shows\nthat Einstein wasn't just into physics\nand wasn't just in a science but he\nunderstood that the world is based off\nof the way that you look at it right one\nof the quotes that he has is the most\nimportant decision that we make is\nwhether we believe that we live in a\nfrontal or hostile Universe which goes\nback to the exact thing I just said is\nit happening to you or is it happening\nfor you\nbecause the most important decision that\nwe make is whether we believe we live in\na friendly or hostile universe that's\none of the things that Einstein said\nanother example is he said you the one\nof the ways that you can look at them to\nthe world\nis you have two options the way that you\nlook into the world and those two\noptions are basically that everything\naround me is a miracle or nothing is a\nmiracle\nand that's really showing that even\nEinstein understood\nit's not the world it is our perception\nof the world that creates our life\ncreates our mindset around things and\ndecides whether we do or do not take\naction to really build the life that we\nwant to\nand really what it comes down to is\nfinding the opportunity instead of\nlooking at the obligation and so I love\nto talk about this because with\neverything that you do to create the\nlife that you want there's an obligation\nof action needs to be taken\njust the way that it goes but there is\nalso opportunity in that as well and so\nlet's say that you need to go to the gym\nright going to the gym\nmoving your body doing what needs to be\ndone is not that hard like in the grand\nscheme of life going to the gym running\non the treadmill walking on the\ntreadmill lifting a couple weights and\ndoing this four or five times a week is\nreally not that hard\nbut we look at it and we think of the\nobligation usually oh my gosh I've gotta\nyou know I've got to go home and I've\ngot to get dressed and then I've got to\ndrive to the gym and then I've got to do\nthis for 45 minutes in the obligation\nthat we have to look at\nor that we can look at is you have to\nput your body under strain that's the\nobligation of it\nit's easier not to do something right so\nthe obligation is we do have to do\nsomething we do have to put our body\nunder strain that's what it comes down\nto and this is where most people don't\ntake action because they're focusing on\nthe obligation\nmore than anything else\nwhat's the opportunity\nopportunity is losing weight\nbeing proud of myself for taking the ash\nI need to looking amazing in a bikini\ngaining muscle\nbeing healthier living longer that's the\nopportunity that we get from taking the\nobligation but here's the thing most\npeople though they don't focus on the\nopportunity what they focus on is the\nobligation\nthey focus on oh I've got to go to my\nhouse and I've got to get dressed and\nthen I've got to drive to the gym and\nI've got to make myself sweat and then\nI've got to come back and then I've got\nto take a shower and then I've got to\nfix my hair and then I've got to fix my\nmakeup and they think about obligation\nobligation obligation obligation all of\nthose things have to happen\nbut when you're focusing on the\nobligation makes it a lot harder to take\naction when you focus on the opportunity\nof being healthier having more energy\nliving longer being around for your\ngrandchildren that's the opportunity\nboth in in the action of going to the\ngym both of those are are there but real\nquestion is which one are you deciding\nto focus on most people are focused on\nthe obligation but if you want to really\nget yourself to take action you have to\nfocus on the opportunity\nwhat if it's something like eating\nhealthy well the obligation is you gotta\nstay away from certain foods it tastes\nreally freaking amazing right and and\nyou know you might have to stay away\nfrom some food that you'll really love\nlike I love pizza pizza is my favorite\nthing to eat in the entire world but I\ncan't eat pizza every damn day right\nit's not them saying that I don't eat\npizza I do eat pizza that's how I reward\nmyself but I can't eat pizza every\nsingle day so the obligation is\num I can't eat pizza all day that\nwould be really nice wouldn't it\nand this is why most people don't end up\ngetting healthy the way they want to and\nthey don't make the change because they\ndon't like change they'd rather the the\nobligation is I have to eat something\ndifferent than I normally eat versus\nlooking at the opportunity of if I eat\nhealthy\nI can have more more energy and that\nenergy could be used to play with my\nchildren it could be just playing with\nmy grandchildren it could be used to\ngrow a business it could be used to go\nand um\nput more energy into growing my business\nso therefore I can travel with my spouse\nand have the money that I need to and if\nI grow my business then I'll be able to\ncreate the life that I want and maybe\nretire earlier\nbut usually what we're looking at is\njust I have to eat healthy damn it I\ndon't want to eat healthy it's just\neasier to eat a pizza we're focusing on\nthe obligation versus the opportunity\nthat comes with following the healthier\npath\nsee what I'm saying which one are you\nchoosing to focus on\nthat's always about perception your life\nis not based off of what happens to you\nyour life is based off of your\nperception of what happens to you or\nlet's put another way happens for you\nanyway that you're looking at it let's\nsay that you're in sales I always love\nto use the example of sales I know a lot\nof sales people listen to me I've\ntrained a few thousand sales reps in my\nday and we can look at it and we can say\nI've got to make phone calls and the\nobligation is you have to put in some\nwork the obligation is you might have\nsome people hang up on you you got to\nget rejected on some calls maybe\nsomeone's going to hang up on you maybe\nsomeone's going to cuss you out maybe\nsomething's going to happen maybe nobody\nanswers maybe you make phone calls for\nthe next three hours and nobody answers\nit feels like just a waste of your time\nthe obligation is you have to make the\nphone calls you have to get rejected to\nget some yeses you have to call a lot\nmore people than are going to answer the\nphone\nthat's just the obligation that will\nalways be present\nbut the opportunity is maybe you're\ngoing to be able to make enough money to\nfinally be financially free\nmaybe you're going to make enough money\nto buy your first house maybe you're\ngoing to make enough money to pay for\nyour children's education to put your\nchildren into a private school instead\nof having them go to public school to be\nable to pay for your kids to go to\ncollege when they want to go to college\nmaybe the obligation maybe the\nopportunity is being able to take your\nfamily on trips that you've never been\nable to before maybe the opportunity is\nbeing able to buy your mom a car or be\nable to buy your mom a house\nthere's always the obligation\nthat's what most people focus on\nbut the opportunity is always there as\nwell and if you focus on the opportunity\nit makes it so much easier to take the\naction there's always the obligation\nbut there's always also the opportunity\nbut most people aren't focused on the\nopportunity what about waking up early\nso many people struggle with waking up\nearly you know I get so many messages on\nInstagram\nand they're like rob you know how do I\nget myself to wake up early in the\nmorning and the obligation is you have\nto get your ass out of your warm\ncomfortable amazing bed no matter what\nlike that's the obligation you do have\nto do it is it easier to sleep in yes\nit's more comfortable sleeping yes is it\nfeel really nice to hit that snooze and\nyou have those like 45 seconds of\ngetting back into your bed and it's the\nmost comfortable you've ever been in\nyour entire life\nyeah those are pretty nice right so the\nobligation is you've got to get out of\nyour warm comfortable bed the obligation\nis you're not going to be able to feel\nthat feeling of going back to sleep and\nwhat it feels like it's much easier just\nto stay in bed isn't it\nyeah it is and so the obligation is you\ndo have to forego the feeling of\nsleeping in heaven on a cloud when you\ndecide to hit that snooze button and go\nback to bed it's like the most\ncomfortable thing ever right it's one of\nmy favorite things in the world\nfeels amazing so the obligation is we\nhave to get up early we have to be a\nlittle more tired maybe oh yeah we got\nto be groggy\nbut what's the opportunity of waking up\nearlier well how much better you're\ngoing to feel after your morning routine\nhow much better I know I will treat\npeople when I get my morning meditation\nin when I get my workout in when I take\ntime for myself when I do my journaling\nwhen I do my reading whatever it is your\nmorning routine is\nso the obligation is yes you do have to\nget out of your warm comfortable amazing\nHeaven bed that you're in\nbut the opportunity is how much better\nyou're going to feel after your morning\nroutine how much better you'll treat\npeople after your morning routine what\nwhat it would be like to have an extra\nhour every single day an extra two hours\nevery single day to be able to wake up\nbefore your kids wake up so that you can\nhave time to yourself so you can\nactually not just be a parent but also\nbe a singular individual as well\nyou know it's just it's just the way it\ngoes there's always the obligation but\nthere's always the opportunity which one\nare you focusing on\nyou know like for me\nif you go out there and you're like okay\nI used to to to do a lot of calls and be\nin sales and trained a lot of sales\npeople as well and it's like there's\nalways an obligation\nand with sales it's the the thing I love\nabout sales that you could really get to\nsee as you really get to see The Human\nCondition you really get to see\npsychology at work and you really get to\nsee people who give up because it gets\ntoo hard or the people who have the\nmental fortitude to push through to push\nthrough to push through to push through\nand when you have those sales calls you\nreally start to see which one people are\nfocusing on because I've been both I've\nbeen the person who wakes up I go to my\njob\nwork for a company and the whole time\nI'm just thinking about the sales calls\nand this sucks this sucks this sucks and\nI've given given up before and I've\ngiven them many times but then I've also\nlooked at the opportunity and said okay\nif I just persevere if I just keep\nforcing myself to go if I just keep\nfocusing on the opportunity eventually\nI'm going to create the life that I want\neventually I'm going to be able to\ncreate the the business that I want or\nthe um the amount of customers that I\nwant or the money that I want to be able\nto get XYZ in life\neventually I'm going to get there\nthat's something to focus on I can\nI can even deal with creating this\npodcast like when I put in and create\npodcast episodes and I actually plan out\nlike I just do it people always ask like\ndo I script out the entire thing the\nanswer is no I usually bullet point it\nand then I do research and all that it\ntakes you know hours of research to\ncreate podcast episodes\nthe easy part is recording the podcast\nthe hard part is all of the preparation\nwork that has to go into it before so I\ncan look at it and I can think to myself\noh God and I've done this many times\nbefore right I've created over 1400\npodcast episodes I've done this many\ntimes where I'm sitting down I'm like\n I've gotta got a plan I've got to\nresearch and I've got to think about\nthis and I've got to do this and it's\ngoing to take some time and I need to\nget a coffee and I gotta chug this\ncoffee so I have enough energy to go\nthrough because I need to be focused and\nI can think about the obligation of what\nit takes to plan a podcast episode to do\nthe research to make sure there's a flow\nfrom the start to the end and I try to\ntake you guys on a journey through this\npodcast right like I could think about\nthe obligation\nand I've done it many times and I had to\npush myself to create podcast episodes\nor I could focus on the opportunity of\nholy do you remember there was one\ntime when you were creating podcast\nepisodes and zero people were listening\nlike you didn't know if anybody would\never listened to it like on the first\nday of the podcast 44 people 44 plays it\nhad on three episodes you had three\nepisodes that means probably 12 people\nlistened on the first day and now you've\ngot this opportunity to create a podcast\nand have your voice be heard around the\nworld by hundreds of thousands of people\nin this podcast episode could change\nsomebody's mindset just a little bit and\nend up changing their life\nI can focus on the obligation I'm still\nhaving to do the obligation I'm still\nhaving to play now I'm still having to\ndo all the research but it makes it so\nmuch easier when what I'm actually\nfocusing on and looking at is the\nopportunity behind all of it\nthere's always the obligation but\nthere's always the opportunity\nwhich one are you focusing on because\nyour world your mind your life is built\naround what it is that you're choosing\nto focus on there's always going to be\nthe things that you have to do in order\nto get what you want\nbut they must be done\nand you have to grow up at some point\nand just put the work in\nNo One's Gonna Come and save you like\nthat's one of the things if I could\nbroadcast a message to the world no\none's going to come and save you you've\ngot to just decide that you're gonna be\nthe person that's going to save yourself\nyou're going to create the life that you\nwant focus on the outcome of what it is\nthat you want\nnot what you have to do to get there you\nstill have to do the things to get there\nbut if you're focusing on the outcome\nthe opportunity this amazing life that\nyou're going to build it makes it so\nmuch easier to take the action that you\nneed to so that is a difference\nbetween focus on the obligation versus\nfocusing on the opportunity Find the\nopportunities in everything that you're\nlooking to do they're always there\nthey're always present you just have to\nswitch your focus a little bit so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non Instagram stories and tag me in at\nRob dial Junior
