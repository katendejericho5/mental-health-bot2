    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout some really fun stuff we're gonna\nbe talking about dying with regret we're\ngoing to talk about dining with regret\nso that you don't have to because the\nlast thing I want you to do is get to\nthe end of your life I would say one of\nthe main reasons why I create this\npodcast episode is so that when you get\nto the end of your life you don't die\nwith regret hopefully I give you some\ntips and tricks and ways to understand\nyourself better so that you can start\nstop holding yourself back so that you\ncan create the life that you want\nnow when you look at it maybe you've\nheard me talk about this before but uh\nthe number one regret of people who are\ndying when they do regret is that I wish\nI lived a life that was true to myself\nand not the life that others expected of\nme and so we're going to dive into that\none specifically in a couple different\npieces of that one but that comes from a\nlady who wrote a book called The Five\nregrets of the dying and the number one\nregret that she found is when people\nwere on their Death Beds and they had\nregrets the number one regret was that I\nwish I lived a life that was true to\nmyself and not the life that others\nexpected of me and that really breaks it\ndown into two pieces from one regret\nwe're gonna go through both of them the\nfirst one\nis people's need for acceptance right so\nwe'll cover the first one then we'll go\ninto the second one which is your need\nfor acceptance is one of the things that\nwill make you regret at the end of your\nlife wishing that you would have done\nsomething that was true to yourself and\nnot what other people expected of you\nbecause from a young age we develop a\npersonal reality uh in that personal\nreality that we create could be called a\npersonality right and so\num you know this if you've been listed\nfor a while personality the Greek word\nuh for personality it comes from the\nGreek root Persona in in the the Greek\ntheatrical days the Persona was the mass\nthat people would wear on stage and so\nyour personality who you think that you\nare this thing that you develop from a\nyoung age is really just this character\nthat you have made yourself into and you\nhave made yourself into a character to\nbe who your parents want you to be\nto be who Society wants you to be to be\nwho people will love to be who if you're\nyou know if you're attracted to women to\nbe the person that women are attracted\nto if you're attracted to men to be the\nperson that men are attracted to and so\nwe build ourselves into who we think\npeople want us to be and we actually\njust lose ourselves and so from a young\nage we develop this personality\nand we're told how we're supposed to act\nwhen we're young what we're supposed to\ndo how we're supposed to be and what we\nreally do and I don't know if there's a\nway I've for years and years and years\nand years probably 15 years I've been\nthinking is there a way to raise a\nperfect child to not give them any\ntrauma\nto not have them you know break away\nfrom their true selves to try to be\nsomeone else and develop a paradigm and\na personality around the way that the\nworld is\nand I'll be honest with you I haven't\nfound the way to do it and I think it's\njust part of the spiritual journey of\nbeing a human is you must lose yourself\nfully to decide this isn't who I want to\nbe and then you start to find yourself\nit's the reason why people have quarter\nlife crisis midlife crisis is because\nthey agreed and did what they thought\neveryone wanted them to do they did what\nSociety wanted them to do because they\nwanted to be accepted and then they wake\nup one day at 40 45 50 years old and\nthey're like what the have I done\nwith my life whose life is this I didn't\nwant this life I didn't want this job I\ndidn't want to get that degree I didn't\nwant to go to that college\nI don't even know if I wanted to marry\nthat person I don't know if I want to\nlive in this town and people wake up and\nthey're like who am I this isn't who\nI've always this is a this is just a\nfake person it's a character I've been\nplaying and it's all because one of the\nreasons why is because it goes back to\nour need for acceptance we want to be\naccepted\nand it's like Jim Carrey's famous quote\nwhere he says your need for acceptance\nwill make you invisible in this world\nthink about that one for a second\nyour need for acceptance can make you\ninvisible and you weren't born to just\nbe the same as everybody else\nyour need for acceptance will make you\ninvisible in this world\nand I get it we need to we feel like we\nneed to be accepted you know when we\nlook back to a couple hundred thousand\nyears ago with our cave men and Cave\nwomen uh ancestors we needed to be\naccepted into the tribe because not\nbeing in the tribe meant Absolute death\nthere was no way to survive without the\ntribe 200 000 years ago\nbut it's not 200 000 years ago it's\nmodern day\nyou don't have to be in the tribe you\nwant to be around people you want to be\naround people that you love and stuff\nbut you really have to ask yourself like\ndo I am I changing myself\nfor other people I was listening to a\npodcast the other day and it was Rick\nRubin here's a new book that's out and\num he was in the middle of being\ninterviewed and in the middle of the\ninterview he's talking and he says hey\nit's kind of cold in here could you turn\nthe air off and they they pause him and\nthe guy who's interviewing him is like I\nreally respect you for that because I\ndon't think that I'm the type of person\nto be able to say that and he's like why\nis that he's like I would fear that if I\nasked you to turn the air off that you\nwouldn't like me as much like maybe\nyou're maybe your height maybe you run\nhot and by me turning the air off then\nI'm you know making you not like me as\nmuch and Rick Rubin said something I\nthought was amazing I think every person\nshould write this write it down because\nif you can live your life with this\nViewpoint of the world\nwell I don't think you're going to dive\nwith the uh the need for other people's\napproval and what he says is he's like\nbecause I just want you you know the guy\nwas interviewing group is like I just\nwant everyone to like me and he goes I\ndon't care if you like me I want you to\nlike me but I will not change myself for\nyou to like me and I was like those\nthree sentences if everybody could get\nthat tattooed on their face\nI think so many people would have so\nmuch better lives because we just are\ndying for other people's acceptance so\nhe said I don't need you to like me I\nwant you to like me\nbut I won't change myself in order for\nyou to like me and I think that those\nthree sentences just really wrap up we\ndo want to be loved we do want to be\naccepted right but\nI'm not going to change myself in order\nif I'm not hurting anybody why would I\ntry to fit into the box that you want me\nto fit in right and so we're taught how\nto fit in when we're younger and then at\nsome point in time we have to wake up\nand realize that there are some aspects\nof ourselves that we love and there are\nsome aspects of ourselves that we need\nto change you know some people become\nbullies as they get older some people\nbecome victims as they get older do you\nwant to stay that way do you want to\nchange\nyou know you're growing up you're told\nwhat college to go to sometimes\nyou're told what degree to get what job\nto get to make your parents feel a\ncertain way and then you wake up you're\n45 years old and you feel like you can't\nturn you're too far down the road you\ncan't turn back now too much time has\nbeen invested I get messages all the\ntime for people that are in their 40s\nlike 45 years old and they're like rob\nyou know I've been I went to to school I\ngot this degree I got this job when I\nwas 22 and I've been in this industry\nfor 23 years I don't want to be here\nanymore but I feel like I've invested\ntoo much time and I can't leave now and\nI'm like you're 45 years old\n45 like if you just live to the average\nage which I believe is around 72\nyou have to realize you have what\nanother 20s about 27 years\nthat you're going to be living so\nbecause you invested 23 years into\nsomething you're going to hate the next\n27 years of your life because you you're\nquote-unquote too far down the road what\nif you lived to a hundred years old\nyou still have 55 more if you have to\n100 years old you're not even halfway\nthrough your life if you're 45. so\nyou're telling me because you invested a\nlittle bit of time you're just going to\ncontinue down this road where you\nfreaking hate what you do and you hate\nthe life that you built that's dumb\nyou got to wake up one day and be like\nwhat makes me happy what is it that I\nwant to do with myself so that's the\nfirst piece of of that need that we\nreally have is that you know I I my\nnumber one regret the people number one\nregret is that I wish I lived a life\nthat was true to myself and not what\nother people expected of me the first\nreason why that is there is because we\nfeel like we need to be accepted\nand the second reason why and this is a\nvery important reason and hopefully a\nwake-up call for a lot of people is that\npeople don't know who they truly are and\nbecause they don't know who they truly\nare they don't know what they truly want\nyou think you know who you are\nI'm here to tell you that you don't you\nkind of know who you are but one of the\ncrazy things I used to hear it all the\ntime when I worked with people\none-on-one and they used to I used to\ngive them journaling lessons and we were\nyou know journaling assignments and all\nthat stuff and then you come back and\nafter a few months of working with me\nand this isn't like me talking about how\ngreat I am but this could be with\nanybody once someone starts going on a\nself-development journey is they would\nalways say I thought I knew myself and I\nrealized I didn't know myself for the\nlongest time I thought I knew who I was\nbut now I'm realizing I'm somebody else\nI'm realizing who I truly am like really\ndo we ask ourselves like really do we\nstop and ask ourselves what do I want\nlike what do I want\nand really figure that out like what do\nyou want what do you want from your life\na lot of times we don't know what we\nwant but we sure as hell don't know what\nwe don't want or do know what we don't\nwant\nand then we can start to kind of go on\nthe path of self-discovery what is it\nthat I want and then what's crazy about\nis you might know what you want\nbut you still might not be going for it\nthe hell are you doing then so we live a\nlife based off of what we think other\npeople want from us\none of the scariest moments of my life\nwas deciding that I was going to leave a\njob where I was making over six figures\nsalary plus commission at 26 years old I\nwas making that money and then leaving\nthat job at 29\nand I was just terrified and I remember\nafter I left because I really wanted to\nfollow my passion which is this which is\nthis thing that I do now this is back in\ntwo thousands November 2015 is when this\nall happened and I was so terrified of\nwhat might happen I started thinking to\nmyself after I quit and I left that job\nstarted thinking to myself oh my God I\nmight have to get another job like I\njust got a brand new house four months\nago I got to pay my mortgage I have\nbills I have to pay I have things I have\nto do and I had some money saved up and\neverything but I started thinking like\nI'm terrified I don't know if I'm able\nto make money\nand a few weeks later about three weeks\nlater I was at my sister's house and my\nsister brought out this box and she was\nlike hey have you ever seen these these\nthings from Dad and I was like No And I\ndon't think so and you know there's like\nhis glasses there's his watch there's\nall these different things books like\nt-shirts all this stuff and there was\nall these letters you know I don't talk\nabout a whole lot but one of the things\nmy dad was in jail when I was a kid uh\nforgetting too many DUIs and so he would\nwrite us letters and so he wrote a\nletter to my sister on her 21st birth\nI'm sorry on her her 19th birthday he\nwrote her a letter and it was you know I\nread through the whole letter it was all\nnice and then the very last line of the\nletter\nsaid I hope you live your life with\ncourage love and laughter\nand I was like I was reading it and it\nwas like that line\nand the the thing that was written to my\nsister you know 15 years prior\nthat line\nI feel like was written for me to read\nat that moment because I was so\nterrified that I wouldn't be able to pay\nmy bills that I was about to give up on\nmy passion to go back to working for\nsomeone else so that I could make money\nso I could pay my bills and then go back\nto doing what I don't want to do and not\nfollowing the life that I truly wanted\nto live and I was so I was scared right\nthat was a main piece of it and in that\nletter it said live your life with\ncourage first it said courage love and\nlaughter and so for those of you guys\nit's funny because I can go into Google\nand I can type in Rob dial and uh one of\nthe things that always pops up is Rob\ndial tattoos so it seems like people are\nGoogling my tattoo because I've talked\nabout this couple times but it's on my\nleft arm and it's my first tattoo that I\never gotten and says it's in my dad's\nhandwriting and it's blown up on my arm\nand it says live your life with courage\nlove and laughter because I was so it\nwas like the message I needed to hear\nand I was like I'm gonna get this\n tattooed on my body because then\nI can't give up on this dream\nI can't go back to what I was doing\nbecause if I have the statue I'm gonna\nhave his tattoo forever and so if I'm\ngoing to really step in and fully commit\nto doing this podcasting thing to being\nsomebody who talks about mindset to\ngrowing a following to trying to impact\npeople to coach people I'm gonna have to\ngo all in and getting a tattoo is pretty\nall in and so I got that tattoo to\nremind me to be courageous when I felt\nfearful\nright and\num really what it came down to is I\nforced myself out of the company I was\nafraid and then I just forced myself to\ntake more action because that was what I\nwanted now what I did is not necessarily\nwhat you should do or what you might\nwant to do but what do you want like if\nmoney were No Object what would you be\ndoing what it what is it that makes you\nfeel the most alive\nwhat makes if your soul could smile what\nmakes your soul smile do you know if you\ndo follow it maybe you can make money\ndoing it maybe you can't if you can't\nmake money doing it how could you figure\nout a way to make money pay your bills\nand then spend the majority of your time\nthat you possibly can when you're awake\nfollowing that thing that really makes\nyou happy\nif you don't know what it is\nsearch for it find it\nI always say like it's okay not to know\nyour true purpose right now\nbut if you now are sitting here right\nnow and you know you don't know your\ntrue purpose it is not okay to not be in\nconstant search for it so it's okay not\nto know your true purpose but it's not\nokay not to be in constant search for it\nyou have to go find it you have to\nfigure out what it is because there is a\ntrue purpose there is something that\nthat really makes you come alive and\nespecially if you know what it is if you\nknow what it is and you're not following\nit I love this phrase and I I heard\nsomebody say something like this before\nthere's no exact quote but when you find\nyour purpose in life if you don't find\nyour per I'm sorry when you find your\npurpose in life if you don't follow your\npurpose\nyour purpose will eventually destroy you\nbecause you can't stop thinking about it\nand your soul is going to start dying\nand slowly feel like it's withering away\nlike I felt like I was doing when I knew\nthat this podcast and doing what I'm\ndoing now is like the reason why I'm\nalive and I kept working the other job I\nliterally started to get more and more\ndepressed doing it because it was\nstarting to destroy me that I was not\nputting all of my effort into growing\nthis thing right you might be 40 years\nold now and feel like you've gone too\nfar down the road but people are living\nto 85 90 100 110 years old very often\nyou're not even halfway through your\nlife\nit's time for you to figure out what it\nis that you want stop paying attention\nwhat other people say about you and\nthere's not regret when you get to the\nend of your life the number one regret\nis that I wish I lived a life that was\ntrue to myself and there's two pieces of\nthat number one you need for acceptance\nand number two you don't know who you\ntruly are and what you want so go on\nthis journey of self-discovery figure\nout who you truly are what you truly\nwant and then spend your time and energy\nfollowing that so that you don't get to\nthe end of your life and regret your\nlife so that's what I got for you if you\nlove this episode please do me a favor\nif this impacted you there's probably\nother people out there in this world\nthat do impacts as well so do me a favor\ngo ahead and take a screenshot of it\ntake a video of you listening to it\nsomewhere or whatever it might be and\nshare it on Instagram stories and tag me\nin it Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-jr and with that I'm
