    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to stop worrying and we're\ngoing to talk about what to replace your\nworrying with in order to be more\nproductive\nand we're going to talk about the fun\nthing that everyone loves your worry\nyour stress your things that you get\nanxious over all of that and we're going\nto talk about how to get past that and\num there's no secret sauce sorry I'm\ngoing to tell you but we're going to go\nthrough it today because\nwhen you really think about worry\num\nI'll be honest with you I used to be a\nbig Warrior when I was younger and then\nI just realized there's a freaking waste\nof time like it was just a waste of time\nit was a waste of energy as a waste of\nspace so I would waste time you know 30\nminutes worrying about something and\nthen I would waste energy because mental\nenergy to be able to think about\nsomething especially something that has\na high emotional charge to it\nends up taking a lot of energy from you\nso I'm wasting time and I'm wasting\nenergy on something that literally gets\nme nowhere and if you list this podcast\nlong enough you know I've said the\nstatistic many times\npsychologists have found that 85 percent\nof what you worry about will never\nhappen 85 will never happen out of all\nof that the there's a only three percent\nwill actually happen the way that you\nthink that it will which means that 12\nof the stuff will actually happen\nbut it will happen way better than you\nthink it's going to be so it's not as as\nmuch catastrophizing as needed and so\nwhen you look at it that means three\npercent of what you worry about will\nhappen 97 of what you worry about won't\nhappen or won't happen the way she\nthinks gonna happen and not as bad which\nmeans that if one out of 33 times that\nyou worry is actually relevant\nso that means 32 times that you're\nworrying out of 33 it is completely\nrelevant to waste your time\nso what do we do well here's what we do\nthe first thing that we do is we have to\nbecome aware of when we're worrying now\nhow do you become aware of when you're\nworrying\nthe best way of finding out if you're\nworrying or not is usually how your body\nfeels and so a lot of times we will slip\ninto worrying because it is basically\njust\nbuilt into us it's it's something that\nwe've been doing for so long we\nunconsciously just go into worry we have\nthese unconscious thoughts and uh\nbehavioral therapy these unconscious\nthoughts are just called automatic\nthoughts they pop up we don't even\nnotice the thoughts what we do notice\nthough is we notice the emotion and the\nfeeling in our body and then we can\nstart thinking about emotions so what\nhappens is when we start to notice the\nfeeling in our body\nwe go what was I just thinking about oh\nI was thinking about what I'm worried\nabout think about you know this\npresentation that I have to give later\non at work or I was thinking about you\nknow XYZ\nwell instead of noticing that we're\nthere and getting wrapped up in the\nworry knowing so now it's like yesterday\nwe have now noticed we were worrying\nwe've now noticed that we're worrying\ninstead of breaking down why am I\nworrying where is this coming from and\njust digging a hole deeper and just\nthinking about worry and using our time\nand our energy and time and energy\nbecause you can waste your money you can\nwaste your time and energy on worrying\nbut you can also waste your time and\nenergy on thinking about why you're\nworrying so if we're not going to waste\nour time doing that\nwhat's something we could do to be more\nproductive here's what it is when you\nnotice yourself slipping into worry take\nsome action\ntake some action doesn't really matter\nwhat it is if you can take a step in the\nright direction to get rid of your worry\nor to work through whatever is that\nyou're working through I'll give you a\ncouple of explanations of what I mean by\nthat in a little bit whatever you start\nto worry become self-aware and then\nfigure out a way to take action here's\nthe reason why\nworrying tends to die down when we're\nmaking progress towards some destination\nthat we're working towards\nthat's interesting we usually worry when\nwe're not doing like when we're\nsitting on the couch thinking about the\nthings that we have to do that's when\nwe're worrying\nso I can tell you this because I noticed\nmyself get stuck in it and as soon as I\nnoticed myself gets stuck in it I'm like\nmove your body get up move do something\nand if you could start moving towards\nsome sort of progress towards the thing\nthat you're worrying about your worry\ndies down immensely when you're making\nprogress towards the destination that\nyou're trying to get to worry dies when\nprogress is made so let me give you an\nexample right so let's let's say that\nyou know you are in sales\nand you need to make a thousand dollars\nthis week to be able to pay your\nmortgage like it's it's strong you're on\nThe Struggle Bus you're it's oh man it's\ngetting there right you make a thousand\ndollars this week to pay for your\nmortgage you can sit around and start to\nworry about how you will pay your bills\nyou know what if what if I make all\nthese phone calls and nobody answers\nwhat if I make all these phone calls and\neverybody says no what if we make all\nthese phone calls and I I start working\nreally hard and then somebody starts to\nget interested and they say no later on\ndown the road and you can worry about\nall of the things that could possibly\nhappen while trying to make that\nthousand dollars how many times do we do\nthis we do this all of the time right\nwe have something that we're worrying\nabout and then we think of all the\nthings that could go wrong when in\nreality there's a problem the problem is\nI need to make a thousand dollars this\nweek\nthe solution is not sitting around and\nworrying the solution is I need to do\nsomething right what good is sitting\naround and worrying about all the things\nthat might happen what good does that\never do for you\nright\nworrying does nothing worrying takes\nenergy use it it uses your energy\nand use your time guess what also uses\nyour energy and time as well\ntaking action so you can have a choice\nat that moment okay hold on I'm noticing\nthat I'm worrying about making this\nthousand dollars this week but by\nworrying that I'm making it but if I'm\nif I am or I'm not going to make a\nthousand dollars this week I'm actually\nnot going to make any money by doing\nthat so if you're worried about how to\npay your bills or your mortgage well\nworrying about it can feel crippling\nor you could just ask yourself what can\nI do right now about this okay I'm\nworried about making a thousand dollars\nthis week what can I do right now about\nthis I can replace my worry with action\nthere was that podcaster guy that told\nme that whenever I start to feel\nworrying so it starts to feel worried I\nshould do do some action take some\naction you know what I can do I can get\nup and I can make some phone calls\nthat's what I could stop feeling sorry\nfor myself like I'm a child\nand I can do this and actually start to\nget positive momentum towards what I'm\ntrying to get towards where I'm trying\nto get to what I'm trying to create the\nmoney I'm trying to make so the thing\nthat I know that I can do that will make\nme move in the right directions I can\nreplace worry with action I can get up I\ncan do something I can start making some\ncalls I can stop feeling sorry for\nmyself and stop acting like a little\nchild that's just a victim of their\ncircumstance even though I'm the person\nwho signed up for my mortgage and I'm\nalso the person who makes the money but\nsomehow I'm still acting like I'm the\nvictim of my circumstance I can stop\nfeeling sorry for myself I can be an\nadult and I can start taking action\ntowards what it is that I want to create\nin my life I can start creating some\nform of positive movement\nby taking some sort of action so\nsomething anything\nsmall movement towards your goal is\nbetter than standing still\nyou know there's a book that Dale\nCarnegie has and it's called stop\nworrying and start living and he said\nthe secret to being miserable is to have\nthe Leisure to bother about whether\nyou're hot happy or not so don't bother\nto think about it spit on your hands and\nget busy your blood will start\ncirculating your mind will start ticking\nand pretty soon this whole positive\nupsurge of life will will show up in\nyour body and will drive worry from your\nmind so get busy keep busy it's the\ncheapest kind of medicine that there is\non this Earth and one of the best and so\nwhat does he mean by that he means that\nwhen we're doing nothing you're going to\nfeel miserable you're going to feel\nworry but the easiest way to get past it\nis to just take some action\nI mean if you've listened this podcast\nfor a while how many times have I said\ninaction creates more in action action\ncreates more action but it's not like\nyou can just motivate yourself to take\naction a lot of times it takes brute\nforce it takes you talking to yourself\nand your mind and saying you I'm\ndoing it anyways sometimes it takes that\nsometimes it takes some self-love\nsometimes it takes some Brute Force what\ndo you need at this moment in order to\nstart taking the action that you need to\nbecause no one's going to come and save\nyou the successful person goes about\nlife and does what they need to do takes\nthe action that they need to regardless\nof how they feel I did a video a couple\nuh\na couple days ago that we put on\nInstagram and I was talking about you\nknow what do I think the the actual\nunknown like secret is to achieving your\ngoals the secret to achieving your goals\nis to stop focusing on your goals and to\njust start focusing on being consistent\nto strive to be the type of person that\ndoes what they're supposed to do every\nsingle day regardless of how to how they\nfeel to strive to be the type of person\nwho takes the action that they need to\nbecause they said they were going to do\nit to strive to be a type of person\nthat's going to get it done no matter\nwhat because they know they need to get\nit done and it's more important for them\nto work towards the life they want to\ncreate than it is to not feel like\nthey're out of their comfort zone or not\nfeel like they're being triggered in\nsome sort of way right it doesn't mean\nthat you won't feel worried sometimes\nyou of course you will feel worried but\nwhen you do what you need to do is you\nneed to take action in spite of worry\npeople always were like like one of the\nthings I hate is when somebody's\nintroducing somebody else and they say\nHere Comes our fearless leader\nI'm like that's a bunch of BS just\nbecause someone's a leader doesn't mean\nthey're fearless and I guarantee you\nthat person has all of the same fears\nit's just that maybe just maybe they've\ngotten a little bit better not listening\nto their fears they're still there they\njust don't listen to them so you know\nyou have to realize that the person\nwho's successful whether they're worried\nor sad or sick they do what needs to be\ndone they take action no matter how they\nfeel because they know how important it\nis and so instead of striving to be the\ntype of person who's a millionaire one\nday or striving to be the person that's\nin perfect shape why don't you just\nstrive to be the person who shows up\nevery day who's consistent every single\nday\nright that's where your confidence will\ncome from your worry will start to\nsubside and your confidence will start\nto grow when you start progressing\ntowards your goals when you start\ngetting a little bit better and you know\nand you've heard me say that motion\ncreates emotions so instead of sitting\naround and worrying about what might\nhappen\nsuccessful people they get off their\nbutts they get their blood moving and\nthey make things happen and it's like\nimagine that you're sitting here and\nyou're listening to this and uh you know\nyou're listening this podcast on your\nphone and you look down at your phone\nyou see the battery is at one percent\nyou could sit there and you could be\nlike oh no\noh what if it runs out of battery what\nif I can't you know what if I can't do\nthis you know I know there's one across\nthe room I know I can go ahead and run\nto my charger across the room but what\nit it's so much it's far away and my my\nfeeties my feetsies hurt because I\nworked out yesterday and I went for a\nrun and you start worrying and thinking\nabout all of the blocks and the barriers\nthat are in front of you in order to go\nand plug your phone into the wall do you\ndo that\nno what do you do you just stand up and\nwalk to the wall and plug your phone in\nhow ridiculous is it if you were to sit\nand worry about the route to go from\nstanding up to plugging in your phone\nit'd be ridiculous right that's exactly\nwhat you're doing when you're sitting\naround and worrying about creating the\nlife that you want you're putting blocks\nand barriers in front of you that don't\neven exist and what did I say I told you\nthis statistic 85 of what you worry\nabout will never happen so you're\nliterally putting mental blocks and\nbarriers fears in front of you to worry\nabout that will never happen in the\nfirst place\nso what is it that you've been worrying\nabout too much\nyou've been holding yourself back not\ndoing whatever it is you need to what's\nthe mental barriers that you've been\nputting in front of yourself\nand then really start to think to\nyourself what action can you take to\novercome those barriers and stop\nworrying so much\nyou know so instead of worrying about\nmoney\nor how you don't have money right now\nwhy don't you ask yourself what can I do\nright now to make money like the cool\nthing is like if you live in America and\nyou live in a decent sized city\nyou could make money at any moment that\nif you really wanted to like if if you\nguys wanted to learn how to make money\nonline you could make money online\nanytime that you wanted to but let's\njust say that you you live in you know\nAustin where I live and you're going oh\nmy gosh you know what\nin two weeks my mortgage is due and I'm\nshort a thousand dollars you could sit\naround you could be like oh my gosh I\ndon't know how to make that thousand\ndollars or you could be like how can I\nmake money to be able to pay my mortgage\nin two weeks okay what can I do I could\nsign up for Uber I could sign up for\nLyft I can sign up for instacart I could\nsign up for all these delivery services\nand instead of worrying about making the\nmoney I can get off my ass and just go\nmake the money\nthat's pretty awesome isn't it there's\nnever been opportunity like that where\nyou could just decide that you want to\nmake money you sign up on these apps you\ngive them your Social Security number so\nthey know that the the IRS is going to\nknow that you're making money and then\nyou can just immediately start making\nmoney with them you can you can deliver\nfor Amazon there's so many different\nways that you can make money so instead\nof worrying about it\njust take some action towards it\ninstead of worrying about your you know\nhow to how to make money why don't you\njust figure out what can I do right now\nto make money instead of worrying about\nyour health ask yourself what can I do\nto improve my health right now because\nwhat you focus on expands if you worry\nabout the bad that could possibly happen\nmore bad is going to happen to you if\nyou replace that worry with taking\naction to combat the outcome that you're\nworried about then you're pushing the\noutcome that you're worrying about away\nI don't know how the universe works but\nI do know that what I'm telling you is\ncompletely true and if you're worrying\nabout money it's gonna be hard to make\nmoney but if you decide that you're just\ngoing to take some action make money it\nmakes money if you're worried about your\nhealth your health is going to be hurt\nif you just decide what can I do right\nnow to to make my health better it will\nmake it better but it requires action\nand you don't need to believe in\nyourself in order to take action\nyou know there's no universal law that\nsays hey before this person takes any\naction and becomes successful\nthey need to know 100 with absolute\ncertainty that they are going to be\nsuccessful no most people who are\nsuccessful don't believe in themselves\nbut they're just like I don't want to be\nwhere I am I'm just going to work my ass\noff and try to get myself out of\ncircumstance that I'm in\nand the thing that I do know is that the\nuniverse will be on your side when you\ntake action ask yourself the question\nwhat is it that I'm worrying about\nthat's taking away from my happiness\nthat's taken away from my success let's\ntake away from my joy let's take away\nfrom my pieces taken away from my\nrelationship with my children\nand what action can I take to overcome\nthe outcome that I'm worried about how\ncan I make sure\nthat I take so much damn action that\nthere is no way on God's green earth\nthat what I'm worried about will ever\nhappen\nhave you ever thought about that way\ninstead of worrying about it why don't I\njust be like you know what I'm going to\nwork my ass off to make sure that this\nthere is no way that this thing that I'm\nworried about could ever possibly happen\nthat is how you start to take action\nthat is how you start to create the life\nthat you want and that is how you\nreplace your worrying with taking action\nand when you do that you'll start to\nkill your worrying and your worrying\nwill start to subside and you'll start\nto build more confidence in yourself so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode and you\nfeel like
