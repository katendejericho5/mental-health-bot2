    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to stop being lonely in the\nsecret to loneliness and really what\nit's going to come down to is how to\nbuild a strong and Lasting relationship\nby becoming whole within yourself more\nthan anything else and one of the things\nthat I've come to find as I have grown\nup over the years is it's a really\ncommon belief that finding a partner\nwill fill the loneliness and the\nunhappiness within ourselves right if\nyou look at Hollywood there it's it's\nlike everyone's always screwed up until\nthey find the person they can fall in\nlove with and then they live happily\never after once they find that person\nand then there's like you know your soul\nmate the phrase your soulmate there's\nyour twin flame there's all of these\nthings that make people think that\nthere's something wrong with them\nuntil they find someone that is good for\nthem and finding that person is good for\nthem is their quote unquote other half\nwhen in reality what we really should be\nworking on is how do we become whole as\nourselves because if you go into a\nrelationship as half expecting another\nhalf you will probably have that\nrelationship fail and you know it's a\nreally big misconception that I think is\nprobably led to a lot of relationships\nfailing is I need to get into a\nrelationship with someone else so that I\ncan fix myself when in reality is I need\nto fix myself so that I can get into a\nhealthy relationship because the truth\nis no one is going to complete you and\nnobody is going to make you happy yes\nthat is correct nobody will make you\nhappy\nit's also not your partner's job to make\nyou happy happiness is a decision that\nwe have to make for ourselves happiness\nis a state of mind you can wake up every\nsingle morning and no matter how much\n is hitting the fan you can decide\nthat you will be happy as shit's hitting\nthe fan right it doesn't mean that we\nhave to go find someone else we have to\nfix something in order to get there we\ncan figure out how to get there\nourselves and so the key to a successful\nrelationship really what it comes down\nto is finding wholeness within yourself\nfirst and then getting into a\nrelationship\nnow some of you guys are like holy crap\nI'm already in a relationship we'll talk\nabout that in just a little while but in\nthis episode we're going to dive into is\nis why so many relationships fail\nbecause of this and the importance also\nof self-discovery self-love which we\ntalked about in a previous episode how\nto build a strong and Lasting\nrelationship by becoming whole within\nyourself but first what we really need\nto come down to is\nthe root of why most relationship\nproblems exist why most problems come up\nand why most people end up you know not\nmost but I guess I guess you could you\nknow 50 relation of of marriages fail\nbut more than 50 of relationships fail\nand usually what it comes down to is one\nor both of the people are seeking\nexternal solutions for internal problems\nthey are seeking external solutions for\ninternal problems one of the main\nreasons why relationship fails because\npeople seek external Solutions\nthey think the outside world is going to\nheal their inside world this is in\nrelationship system people want to\nbecome rich this people want to become\nsuccessful it's and the example that I\nlove to get to to give and I heard uh\nWayne Dyer who you know passed away in\n2015 amazing human\nand he says this is the way to think of\nit right he goes way to think of it is\nsay you're you're getting your keys and\nyou're picking up your keys to go for a\ndrive and the uh the lights click out\ninside of your house and you lose power\ninside of your house and you can't see\nyour keys so you're searching for your\nkeys you accidentally drop them on the\nfloor you know you're searching on the\nfloor and you can't seem to find your\nkeys but then you notice that the street\nlight is on outside and so you're like\nyou know what\nI can the lights on outside what if I go\noutside and search my keys so then you\ngo outside on the street light under the\nstreet light you start searching for\nyour keys and your neighbor comes over\nand your neighbor's like hey you know\nwhat's going on is everything okay and\nyou're like oh I'm just searching for my\nkeys he's like oh well let me give you\nsome help I'll come to help you he comes\neverybody starts helping you search for\nyour keys search for a few minutes and\nhe goes hey like what area did you have\nlike where did you last see them where\nwas it and you go inside\nyour neighbor would be like why are we\nwhy are we searching for your keys that\nyou dropped inside outside and you're\nlike oh because the lights on outside\nright that doesn't make any sense it's\nthe exact same thing we're looking for\nuh for problems that we have internally\nto be solved by external that's\nimpossible we have to be the people to\nsolve them so instead of people\naddressing their insecurities their\nloneliness their unhappiness people get\ninto relationships hoping that their\npartner will fill the void man what a\nbig task that is right I'm going to get\ninto a relationship with you so that you\ncan heal my insecurities that you can\nheal my loneliness and so that you can\nmake me happy right then they think that\nthis other person will then end up\nhealing their heart but unfortunately\nthis approach is going to lead to\nrelationship being built on really\nreally weak foundations so it's setting\nthe stage for countless problems that\nare going to pop up later on down the\nroad so it's really important to\nunderstand that no one can fix your\nproblems no one can fix your internal\nissues that responsibility lies solely\non us so why it really begs the question\nbefore we go in and try to fix ourselves\nwhy do we feel unhole why do we feel\nunlovable or unloved well there's\nthere's many reasons because when you\ngrow up as a human you get kicked in the\nface a lot you know no matter how great\nlife was or was not you're going to get\nkicked in the face right and it comes\nback to our upbringing you know a lot of\ntimes I've said this before and previous\npodcast episodes parents retract their\nlove as a tool to get their their\nchildren to be obedient a lot of times\nand they don't even know they're doing\nit and usually they're doing it because\ntheir parents did it and so a lot of\nparents actually retract their love for\nfrom their child to get their child to\ndo what they want them to do which then\nmakes the child feel unlovable because\nif the parents if my parents who are\nsupposed to love me with anybody else in\nthe world this is obviously subconscious\ntalking if my parents love me more than\nanyone else in the world how can and\nthey don't love me fully how could\nanybody else fully love me\nso that happens then you grow up and you\nfail some tests and you think that\nyou're stupid and then you get beat up\nand you feel like you're a loser and\nthen you get heartbroken and you feel\nlike you're unlovable and we develop\nthese stories throughout our lifetime of\nhow we're not enough and how will then\nwe feel like if we're never enough we'll\nnever be enough there's nothing that we\ncan do to ever become whole as a lot of\nwhat people feel and oh my God but if I\nget into relationship then maybe I'll\nfeel whole because in Hollywood they\ntell me when I get into relationship\nthat's my other half that's the other\nperson I've been looking for it's going\nto make me feel like there's finally\nnothing wrong with me\nthat's bunch of right we must\nunravel the stories that we tell\nourselves in our head about not being\ngood enough smart enough unlovable that\nwe're stupid that we're a loser we must\nunravel all those stories and start to\ntell ourselves new stories\nbecause when you're you know unhealed\nand you're lonely it can lead to you\nknow a few negative consequences one of\nthose that can it can lead to is is\nunrealistic expectations when you're\nlonely it can cause people that are\nlonely to view a potential partner as\ntheir quote unquote savior oh this is\nthe person who's going to rescue me how\nmany times we heard Knight Shining Armor\nright like these phrases are just\nrepeated over thinking that somebody's\ngoing to save us so we have unrealistic\nexpectations that the person's Gonna\nSave me they're going to rescue me from\nmy emotional pain they're finally going\nto make me feel like I'm good enough and\nwhat it does is it puts a immense\npressure on the person she into a\nrelationship with and usually sets a\nrelationship up for failure nobody can\nlive up to such unrealistic expectations\nso that's the first thing is the\nunrealistic expectation second thing it\ncan set you up for is codependency so\nthose people who enter relationships to\ntry to escape loneliness may become\noverly reliant on their partner for\ntheir emotional support\nlike they actually feel like they need\nthat person that's why a lot of people\nhave you know breakdowns when they get\nbroken up with is because they feel like\nthe person who gave them who was their\nFoundation their safe place of emotional\nsupport is gone they don't know what to\ndo with themselves right and so this\nunhealthy dynamic in a relationship can\ncreate an unbalanced relationship where\none person's emotional needs dominates\nthe partnership\nI know there's already a whole bunch of\nlight bulbs going off either with you or\nwith other relationships you've been in\nright and the third thing it can lead to\nis a lot of insecurity loneliness breeds\ninsecurity and you know loneliness\nreally just means that you are alone\nthere's nothing wrong with being alone\nbut if you start to think there's\nsomething wrong with it you start to\ncreate stories around it this loneliness\ncan breed insecurity make you start to\nfeel insecure about yourself and then\nyou constantly feel when you're in a\nrelationship that you need to seek\nreassurance and from the partner that\nyou're in a relationship with and I can\nput a lot of strain on the relationship\nand make it difficult for both parties\nin the relationship to really feel\nsecure and feel confident in their\nconnection\nso before entering into relationship\nit's really important to go on a journey\nof self-discovery of self-love and by\nunderstanding and accepting who you are\nyou build a strong sense of self which\nallows you to enter relationship as a\nwhole rather than a half or somebody has\na void or a hole in their heart or they\nneed healing whether or not happy with\nit with somebody else you can enter it\nwhole and then you can instead of\nseeking somebody to make you feel better\nand you know the journey can involve\nmany things right so today we're not\nreally going to talk about how to fix\nall this stuff because you know listen\nto this podcasting going to therapy and\nall that stuff will definitely help it\nbut you know ways to help therapy can\ndefinitely help going and listening to\nthese podcasts and going on your\nself-development journey helps reading\nbooks around relationships around\num you know self-help books as well\nmeditating will help journaling will\nhelp asking why you feel like you're not\ngood enough or smart enough or pretty\nenough or feel like you're a loser feel\nlike you're fat or feel like you're ugly\nor feel like you'll never be loved\njournaling those questions and figuring\nout why you feel that way and how it's\nnot true and just all of that can help\nbuild the the self-discovery journey\nthat you're on the this you know help\nyou grow more than anything else if\nyou're listening this podcast you're\nalready starting on the journey to\nhelping yourself which is a good good\nthing but really\num embracing self-love is a critical\npart of the process and it enables us to\nreally recognize that we have inherent\nworth and there's nothing that we can do\nthere's nothing we can ever do or say or\naccomplish or amount of money we can\never achieve to add to who we already\nare there's literally nothing that we\ncan do to add to who we currently are\nright so going and making more\nachievement or losing weight or making a\nmillion dollars is not going to add to\nwho you are it also wants to attract to\nwho you are because who you are is\nliterally who you are so there is\ninherent value and there's inherent love\nthat that in worth that is there and\nthat's how we start to learn it to love\nourselves and appreciate ourselves and\nlike I said in a recent episode I did on\nspecifically on self-love you can go\nback and listen to that one and start to\nget better at that as well I've got it\nI've got a couple episodes on that\nthat will really help you love yourself\na little bit more\num and so really what it comes down to\nis\nhow healing first helps the relationship\nright and so let's say that you're\ndeciding you maybe you're single right\nnow and you're like okay I'm gonna go in\nthis self-love Journey I'm going to\nstart to love myself I'm going to start\nto to figure out who I am I'm going to\nstart to realize that nobody else is\ngoing to complete me nobody's going to\nmake me happy that's something that I\nhave to do and I have to I've now\nfinally realized that happiness is uh\nsomething that I decide to do happiness\nis a state of mind that I bring up\nwithin myself and nobody can give that\nto me and you start to heal yourself you\nstart to work on yourself well how does\nthat actually help when you do get into\na relationship right so there's a couple\nthings there's a couple ways that it\nhelps number one is it helps you define\nyour personal values and your boundaries\nsometimes when you get into a\nrelationship with somebody you can lose\nyourself in that relationship and try to\nbecome just a chameleon for who they\nwant to be so that you can continue to\nbe loved but when you understand your\npersonal values then you can you can\nfigure out who you are you can then\nestablish clear boundaries to help\nensure that you have a balance and\nrespect for relationship you would think\nboundaries could be a bad thing in a\nrelationship but boundaries are actually\na great thing when they're clearly\ncommunicating a relationship and by\nknowing what's important to you\nand all of that you can effectively\ncommunicate your needs and expectations\nto your partner and see if that lines up\nwith them and individuals that approach\nrelationships like this with a greater\nunderstanding of their own needs and\nemotions usually can communicate that\nwith somebody they can say hey I\nunderstand what you need I actually want\nto be that person provides it for you\nokay let me tell you what I need and how\nwe can provide it for each other what's\nyour love language This Is My love\nlanguage does this fit can we make this\nwork what's your attachment smile this\nis my attachment style you start to\nfigure out who you are and this this is\nreal emotional maturity and it creates\nreally healthy communication and makes\nit much easier to resolve conflicts when\nthey pop up in the partnership as well\nso that's first thing the second thing\nit gives you as well before you go into\nrelationship is a lot of self-confidence\nbecause as you work through your\nloneliness and your personal wounds you\nstart to gain self-confidence\nself-assurance and really be stepping\ninto who you truly are which enables you\nto enter a relationship as a whole\ncomplete human not a half a human that\nis seeking validation and completion\nfrom your partner so it gives you\nself-confidence\nnext thing that does as well number\nthree is to make sure your relationship\nstronger when you address personal\nissues before entering a relationship\nyou are better equipped from a to to\nReally form strong and Lasting\nconnections based on mutual respect and\nunderstanding with that person and these\nPartnerships are more likely to thrive\nbecause both parties have a solid\nfoundation of self-awareness and\nemotional well-being which makes them\nunderstand why they feel a certain way\nand when they feel a certain way they\ncan then communicate to that other\nperson why they feel that way because\ncommunication is probably the most\nimportant part of a relationship and\nthen obviously what it's going to help\nwith is building resilience as well the\nskills and insights that you gain from\nreally starting to build yourself you\ncan actually start to address loneliness\non your own you can heal wounds on your\nown you can start to not need somebody\nelse but choose somebody else and this\nresilience can strengthen the\nrelationship and enable you to navigate\nthe situations with a lot more grace a\nlot more Poise and realize like you\ndon't need anybody there's not anybody\nthat you need and then you get into\nrelationship and you choose to be with\nsomebody because you want to be with\nthem not versus not thinking oh my God I\nneed to be in a relationship with\nsomebody\nnow\nwe've talked about if you're single\nworking on yourself and you know how to\nwork on yourself and all that and then\ngetting into a relationship by that\nworks and then it naturally brings up\nthe question well what if I'm in a\nrelationship and I I've realized through\nthis podcast episode like I'm married or\nI'm I've been a long-term relationship\nwith a boyfriend or girlfriend and and\nyou know now I've realized I have some\nhealing to do oh my gosh I've realized I\nneeded to heal myself before coming in\nwhat do I do my answer to that is you're\n I'm just kidding you're not\n up but my answer to that is no\nmatter who you are no matter how long\nyou've been on this journey\num there's always healing to do right\nand so one thing that I would recommend\nif you are in a relationship with\nsomebody and you've been in a long-term\nrelationship with them\nit's not screwed you know you're always\ngoing to be healing and growing and I\nthink healing and growing is something\nthat you will be doing until the day\nthat you die and we always have more\nhealing and growing to do and so what I\nwould recommend that you do is probably\nshare this episode with your partner\nlisten to it with them take some notes\non it and then decide with each other\nthat you're going to go on a healing you\nknow a healing journey together really\nlike the the thing that I think about\nwhen I think about being in a\nrelationship with somebody is you know a\nlot of times what I used to think and I\nhad this conversation with my wife about\nsix months ago we were talking about\nlove what love is versus being in love\nand love you can love somebody for sure\nbut being in love with somebody usually\nwe think is that person is going to\ncomplete me I will be perfect once they\nget me but really what I think getting\ninto like a a actual real long-term\nrelationship with somebody with two\npeople who are trying to work on\nthemselves is both of you guys\nunderstanding that you are imperfect\nindividuals that need help and um and\nyou can help each other\nbeing in a a real committed long you\nknow relationship with somebody is going\nto bring up all of your wounds that you\nhave from your past especially the\nunhealed ones that you have from your\nparents and deciding to go on that\nJourney with somebody whether it's just\na long-term partner whether it's a\nmarriage with somebody is deciding okay\nyou are the person that I feel\ncomfortable enough with to share all of\nmy all of my my\num\nmy uh insecurities all of my problems\nthat I still have that I'm trying to\novercome and knowing that you are\nprobably the only person like you are\nthe gateway to help me go through there\nlike I don't have to have you but you're\ngoing to help me you know heal these\nwounds and create a safe space for me to\ndo so and in turn I will create a safe\nspace for you to heal your wounds as\nwell and really what that comes down to\nis if you're in a relationship you need\nto have that conversation of like hey do\nI feel safe with this person telling\nthem all of my things working through\nall my things being fully vulnerable in\nexposing myself emotionally with this\nperson and do they feel the same for me\nand then having that committed like okay\nare we in this together like are we\ngoing to to this emotional War\num within ourselves and being there for\neach other as we go through it and if\nyou are then this is a journey you're\ngoing to go on together and that's when\nyou guys start to work on this together\nas a team versus doing it solo\nso that's what I would say if you are in\na current relationship with somebody and\nyou know if somebody's not willing to go\non their Journey with you well then you\nknow you might want to reassess the\nrelationship and see what feels right\nfor me from there so that's what we got\nthat's how you heal yourself that's how\nyou stop being so lonely and that's how\nyou really start to build a\nself-assurance and who you are as a\nperson so that's all I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your Instagram\nstories tag me and I'm sure it will help\na lot of people that you are connected\nwith and I love seeing hundreds and\nhundreds and hundreds of you share this\nevery single time a new podcast episode\ncomes out so if you would do that I\nwould greatly greatly appreciate
