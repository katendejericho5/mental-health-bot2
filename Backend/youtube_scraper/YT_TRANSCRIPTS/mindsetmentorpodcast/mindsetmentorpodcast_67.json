    "transcript": "in today's video I'm going to go over my\nthree biggest takeaways from the massive\nbook Atomic habits number one the first\nthing that's really important that I got\nfrom this book is something called habit\nstacking habit stacking is where you\ntake a habit that you already have and\nyou stack a new habit that you want to\nput on the back side of it so let me\ngive you an example let's say that you\ndrink coffee every single morning and\nalso another thing that you want to\nstart doing every morning is 100\npush-ups well what you would do is you\nwould have Abit stack your coffee with\nyour push-ups so while your coffee is\nbrewing you would then take that time to\nthen do your 100 push-ups to make sure\nthat you get it completed for the day\nanother example of what this would look\nlike is you brush your teeth every\nsingle day right hopefully twice a day\nwell let's say you also want to have\naffirmations that you're starting to\ningrain into your subconscious the way\nthat this would look is you would take\nthose affirmations and while you're\nbrushing your teeth in the morning you\nwould repeat your affirmations in your\nhead over and over and over again for\nthe entire 2 or 3 minutes of brushing\nyour teeth and then every single evening\nyou would do the exact same thing so\nwith both of these examples what you're\ndoing is you're stacking a new habit and\na behavior that you're trying to ingrain\ninto yourself on the back end of a habit\nthat you do every single day my second\nbiggest takeaway from this book is\nsomething called identity based habits\nidentity based habits means that we will\ntake action towards the identity of who\nwe think we are and so one of the quotes\nthat I really love from this book is\ninstead of saying I want to run a\nmarathon think I am a runner this shift\nmakes the Habit more integral to your\nself-image and thus more sustainable he\nsays the goal is not to read a book the\ngoal is to become a reader the goal is\nnot to run a marathon the goal is to\nbecome a runner and another one of the\nquotes that he says inside this book\nwhich is probably my favorite that has\nto do with identity based habits is this\nhe says every action that you take is a\nvote for the person that you wish to\nbecome and this is really important\nbecause when you think about voting in\norder to win an election you don't have\nto get 100% of the votes you just have\nto have the majority of the votes I\nthink this is really important to think\nabout because most of us think I need to\nbe perfect in order to build habits in\norder to hit my goals when in reality we\njust need to realize that we need to get\nthe majority of the actions heading in\nthe right direction so every action that\nyou take is a vote for the person that\nyou wish to become in my third biggest\ntakeaway from Atomic habits is this 1%\nimprovements every single day your life\nis not going to change massively from\nday to day but what you're trying to\nfocus on is when your head hits the bed\ntonight were you 1% better than you were\nwhen you first woke up all of these tiny\nlittle changes these tiny little habits\nAKA Atomic habits that are so small will\ncompound over time so it's so important\nfor you to think about the small in\nincremental changes that you continue to\ndo day in day out that over the next 5\nyears 10 years 20 years will massively\nchange your life so those are my three\nbiggest takeaways from Atomic habits if\nyou haven't read it yet I recommend that\nyou do I'm curious if you've read Atomic\nhabits let me know down below and let me\nknow some of your biggest takeaways"
