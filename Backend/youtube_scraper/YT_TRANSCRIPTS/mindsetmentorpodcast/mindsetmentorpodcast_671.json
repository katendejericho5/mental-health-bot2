    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout stopping the numbing we're going\nto talk about things that you might be\naddicted to and might not even know that\nyou're addicted to it but really what it\ncomes down to is I have found that\nalmost everybody is numbing themselves\nin some sort of way I did a podcast on\nnumbing in the past but I wanted to go\nmore in depth speaking about numbing and\nspeaking about number one why we do it\nbut also how it relates to our nervous\nsystem so when you look at your nervous\nsystem there's basically two different\nstates in your nervous system neither\none of these is good neither one of\nthese is bad both of them are necessary\nthere is the sympathetic nervous system\nwhich seems like it would be the the one\nthat people would prefer which is you\nknow you think sympathetic it must be\nsympathy it must be a good one and then\nthere's parasympathetic right so\nsympathetic is alertness it's energy\nit's fight or flight it increases your\nheart rate it increases your rate of\nbreathing your your pupils will dilate\nthat is what happens when you're in the\nsympathetic nervous system when you're\nin your parasympathetic and that clicks\non that is conserve and restore that's\nwhere your heart rate will decrease and\nyour rate of breathing will decrease and\nin order to make it easier to understand\nI'm actually going to take away the word\nsympathetic and parasympathetic and I'm\njust going to say heightened and relaxed\nright so heightened and relaxed so it\nmakes more sense because when you hear a\nsympathetic parasympathetic it's hard to\nget caught in so there's heightened and\nthen there's relaxed so why does\nsomebody numb\na lot of times it's to calm their\nnervous system\nto go from heightened to relaxed\nbecause a lot of people lack the tools I\nmean we were never taught how to\nself-soothe\nin a lot of adults like a lot of adults\nlack the tools to mentally and\nphysically be able to take themselves\nfrom a really heightened state\nwhich could be anxious which could be\nfight or flight which could be stressed\nto calm cool collected so you know when\nyou look at it it's like a lot of people\nare kind of stuck in a heightened State\nand they lack the tools to be able to\nbring themselves down you're in\nheightened height and height and height\nheightened and you're like I don't know\nhow to bring myself down what do they\nturn to people turn to drugs people turn\nto alcohol people turn to having a glass\nof wine at the end of the day\na lot of people like most people the way\nthat I find people getting into it is\nfood food will actually because food\ncauses when you eat something that's\nreally heavy your body needs to digest\nand digestion is a number one energy\nconsuming thing that your body does so\nin order for you to actually digest\nsomething that's heavy or be able to eat\nsomething and digest it it will actually\nturn off parts of your other bodies and\nsteal energy from it so you go from\nheightened to relax which is why so many\npeople are addicted to food and\nI would say that is probably the most\ncommon and overlooked addictions because\nwhen we look at food food is necessary\nfor life and so we look at it we think\noh food is necessary for life I must you\nknow continue to eat this food because I\nhave to stay alive and so a lot of\npeople have a really really strong\nemotional connection to food\nbut they don't take a step back a lot of\ntimes and look at their food and say\num is this really supporting me and what\nI'm trying to do is this really the food\nthat's nourishing my body versus me\nusing it as an emotional numbing and\ncoping technique so if you have a\nproblem with food this episode might\nreally make you understand yourself and\nhelp you understand yourself you know I\nhave a friend who has always had a\nproblem with weight the entire time that\nI've known this friend you know and he\nhe's wanted to be in shape I don't know\nhow many times I've heard him say he\nwants to be in shape and I've known him\nfor over a decade\nand he works and he works and he works\nand\num you know works and works and works\nthroughout the entire day and then eats\na ton of shitty food when he knows he\nshouldn't at the end of the day\ncheeses fats carbs greasy stuff complete\nbody overload I know a lot of people do\nthis and this is very common I get a lot\nof messages to people asking about this\nand them doing this themselves\nand you realize that even though they\nconsciously know they shouldn't be\neating this thing they consciously don't\nwant to be eating this thing they\nconsciously don't want to be eating it\ntwo o'clock in the morning whatever it\nis they're actually eating it and a lot\nof people say they eat for Comfort but I\nalso think a lot of people besides\neating for Comfort they eat to actually\nself-soothe they eat to numb and so\nthere's many other ways there's there's\nfood obviously that that you could do\nthis with there's drugs there's alcohol\nthere is uh sex there's working out\nthere's working and so you know for me\nworking for the longest time was my way\nof of numbing I would work work work\nwork work to be running away from this\nthing that I didn't want to pay\nattention to this emotional problems\nfrom when I was younger and traumas that\nI was running from because if I'm so\nconstantly busy working I don't have\nenough time to look at those things and\nso the hard part about that one for a\nlot of people that are Workaholics is\nthat being a workaholic is also rewarded\nand looked up upon like people are like\nthat's awesome you work so hard I wish I\ncould work as hard as you and it's\nactually kind of like hey good job for\nthat but you know\nkind of the exact same thing as being a\ndrug addict though you know it's like\nthat was my drug that's many people's\ndrug and it's like going up to a drug\naddict being like hey congratulations\nyou're addicted to heroin like that's\nnot the right thing to say to somebody\nand so why do we do this the reason why\nI do this because we are in a heightened\nState all day long A lot of times\nrunning from one thing to another thing\nto another thing to another thing to\nanother thing\nwe're constantly in a heightened state\nof emotion and then we hear somebody\ntalk about the news and how bad things\nare right now so we're still in fight or\nflight and so we have to figure out some\nsort of way where if we don't know how\nto bring ourselves down to a calm cool\nrelaxed State mentally and physically we\nlook for something outside of us a lot\nof times to be able to do that food\ndrugs alcohol sex working out all those\nthings are outside of us and working out\nis great but working out can also be an\naddiction right I've been there before\nyears ago and so\nlike I was saying with my friend he has\nI see him and he's in heightened State\nheight all day long\nhe doesn't know how to shut it off so\nhow does he shut it off he shuts It Off\nby eating so much food that he's just\nliterally like\nawake\nbut very lucid because it's just like\nhis body needs to digest all of it and\nthat actually calms it down because\ndigestion is the most energy consuming\nthing your body does\nin digestion sends your body into\nparasympathetic the relaxed\ncalm peaceful\ntherefore food is discomfort because the\nfood makes you feel relaxed and\ncomfortable a lot of people say like oh\nyou know I love I love wine and I just\ntake you know I have a glass of wine at\nthe end of the day just to you know be\nable to take the edge off right listen I\nlove wine as well\nbut it's a fact that alcohol stays in\nyour system for up to 80 hours and the\nreal question is why is there an edge in\nthe first place what is the edge\nand are we using a glass of wine to\nbring ourselves down and the reason why\nI can say is because I notice myself\ndoing it years ago right where it's just\nlike work work work work and it was like\noh my gosh I'm just in such a heightened\nState it's just easier to just have a\nglass of wine\nah and then after that glass of wine\nhits you're like it man\neverything's amazing Everything feels\ngreat right and so it's like you don't\nwant to rely on anything outside of you\nto be able to do it though right and so\nyou you know and then people are like\nwell I have a glass of wine because it's\nsupposed to be good for your heart it's\nsupposed to be good for you\nactually if you want to know the fact on\nthat you could go back to my episode\nthat I did with David Sinclair who is\nactually one of the doctors where he\ncreated the study and then the news took\nthat study because they found that red\nwine has Resveratrol in it and because\nResveratrol is supposed to be good for\nyour heart they're like wine is so good\nfor your heart it's full of antioxidants\nhe actually tells you in that podcast\nepisode when I interviewed him that the\nnews and the media took their study and\nran with it started saying wine is good\nin order to have enough Resveratrol for\nactually to to do really well for you\nyou'd have to have enough alcohol inside\nof your system and wine inside of your\nsystem to you know have something wrong\nwith your liver\nso if you're like oh I have a glass of\nwine because it's good for me uh I love\nglasses of wine too love them but it's\nnot good for you right so it's also you\nknow a lot of times it's a numbing\nmechanism It's A coping mechanism really\nwhat it comes down to is can we start to\nlearn to bring ourselves from a\nheightened state to a calm State without\nneeding anything outside of us\ncan we learn to be able to self-pacify\nwithout needing anything anything\noutside of us most people would rather\ndrink a glass of wine versus figure out\nwhy there's an edge in the first place\nright\nmost people would rather eat a whole\nbunch of food than figure out why they\nhave an edge for the entire day\nwhat is it that we're running from\nonce again what is it that that makes us\ngo into what is it that makes me what is\nit makes you go into a heightened state\nand why do we do why do we go towards\nfood or towards alcohol or towards\nworking out or towards sex or towards\num anything else that's out there versus\ndeveloping tools to self-regulate\ntools like breathing tools like\nmeditation tools like journaling to be\nin charge of your mental state\nbreathing I've said this I don't even\nknow how many times this podcast episode\nthe quickest way to change your internal\nstatus to go to breathing the very first\nthing she should do if you notice that\nyou're in a heightened State and you're\nlike you know what I want to turn\ntowards drugs or I want to turn towards\nalcohol or I want to take a pill or I\nwant to just eat something so I feel\nbetter about myself\nwhen you breathe you kid yourself from a\nheightened state to a calmer State six\ndeep breaths it's in through your nose\nit's out through your mouth when you\nbreathe out through your mouth it is a\nlong exhale like you're breathing out\nthrough a straw because a long exhale\nactually slows your heart rate down and\nbesides slowing your heart rate down it\nalso releases a lot of carbon dioxide\nallowing your body and your muscles to\nrelax and so there's tools like\nbreathing we can immediately go to\nthere's meditation we can go to there's\njournaling so we can take all of the\nthings that are in our mind that's\ncausing us to be in this heightened\nstate\nin putting it on a piece of paper and\nstarting to work through it so instead\nof relying on something outside of our\nbody we're relying on relying on just\nherself right when you look at like\ndrugs or alcohol like my father was an\nalcoholic right it's easy to see that\nand to say there's something wrong with\nthat person they're doing drugs they're\ndoing alcohol but then we can look at\nsomeone else and be like oh they're just\nhaving a glass of wine or they're just\nyou know working a lot or they're just\neating a lot\nand we can shame people for drugs and\nalcohol a lot easier than we can be like\nhey maybe we all you know when you're\nit's like when you're when you're\npointing at somebody you're pointing one\nfinger at them you're pointing three\nfingers back at you when you look at\nsomebody like you're bad you're a drug\naddict you're an alcoholic should also\nlook at yourself and be like um\nis there anything that I'm doing to numb\nmyself is there anything that I'm\nrunning from is there anything I'm\ntrying to keep so busy that I don't even\npay attention to is there any\nEdge that I have that I'm sorry do\nsomething to take the edge off how can I\nget rid of the edge what is the edge\nright\nand there's other things there's you\nknow like I said there's drugs there's\npeople that are sex addicts because sex\nis something that makes you so present\nyou forget about everything else there's\npeople who are you know work out all the\ntime and they're Workaholics all of\nthese are just a form of running running\nfrom whatever it is that the\nsubconscious is making the body go into\nsympathetic which is the heightened\nstate\nbut it's also so hard for people to be\nbored this is the reason why it's so\nhard for people to be bored like I've\nalways thought to myself like what's\nwrong with being bored\nlike do you struggle with being like\njust think to yourself rhetorical\nquestion but answer it you know in your\nhead or in your car or in the gym\nwherever you are in the shower whatever\nit is do you have a little bit of\nresistance towards being bored do you\nhave resistance towards\nbeing bored having nothing to do or\nyou're like oh I feel like there's a\nlittle bit of agitation feel like\nthere's a little bit of stress I feel\nlike I need to be doing something I feel\nlike I have to be showing my Worth or I\nfeel like I should be doing something\nright now and I wouldn't check my phone\nI want to check this I want to turn on\nthe TV do you have a little bit of\nresistance towards being bored\nthose people do I found myself a lot of\ntimes like that but really what think\nabout this for a second what is wrong\nwith being bored\nboredom is just the absence of something\nto do\nthink about that for a second like what\nis wrong with it you're literally doing\nnothing\nwhy is there resistance towards doing\nnothing\nit's because we've been built into our\nsystem to run is because we've been\nbuilt to our system the way we show our\nworth and self-worth is from\nachievements what is it that we're\nrunning from\nsome people go crazy when there's\nnothing to do\nbut when it comes to board and you get\nbored what pops up what comes up when\nyou're bored do you get angry\nor did you get frustrated do you start\nto get real anxious because what comes\nto the surface is not being created this\nis really important for you to\nunderstand when you're bored what comes\nto the surface is not being created\nby the boredom\nit's already there the boredom is\nallowing it to come to the surface\nthat's what you're usually running from\nwhat comes to the surface is what is\nalways there it's always bubbling under\nthe surface it's wanting to come out but\nit's usually what we're running from\nit's usually what we're numbing from\nthink about that for a second being\nbored doesn't make you angry\nbeing bored doesn't make you frustrated\nbeing bored doesn't make you anxious\nit's allowing the space for what lives\ninside of you it's bubbling on the\nsurface all the time to finally come to\nthe surface for you to work through and\na lot of times instead of being bored\nand working through it we'd rather just\nrun you'd rather just numb\nwhy because we lack the tools to stay\ncalm and to calm our nervous system to\ngo from a heightened state to a calm\nstate\nwe're addicted to stimuli that's just\nthe way that it works we wake up we have\npeople that text us we have the internet\nwe have emails we've got to get to we\ngot phone calls we have work we have all\nthis stuff we're addicted to stimuli\nreally can we just take a step back and\nrealize that it's okay to be bored and\nwhen we start to numb ourselves we know\nthat numbing looks like why are we\nnumbing what is it that's behind there\nwhat is it we're all addicted to\nsomething what is it that we're addicted\nto and what is it that we're trying to\nrun from so what is it that we're trying\nto run from or what is it that we're\ntrying to numb or the two things we're\nreally trying to figure out\nand if we can learn to breathe through\nit to meditate through it through\nJournal through it we can allow those\nthings to come that are you know\nbubbling on the surface to come up\nand to release them and let them go\nto come up release them and let them go\nbecause it's all living inside of your\nbody\nyou've just got to allow them to come up\nto breathe through it to meditate to it\nto to meditate through it to journal\nthrough it and then to be able to work\nthrough it so you can let it go because\nreally that's what's going to help you\nstop being addicted to numbing being\naddicted to running and allow you to\nstart to understand how to calm your\nnervous system\nso\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories tag\nme in it Rob
