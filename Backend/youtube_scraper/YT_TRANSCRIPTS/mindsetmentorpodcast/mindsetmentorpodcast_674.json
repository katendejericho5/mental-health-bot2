    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to love your sophomore oh\ndoesn't that sound great now that sounds\ncorny and weird and oh I'm gonna love\nmyself more but really it's it's quite\nsimple\nmore than anything else I'm going to\ntalk about how to love yourself more but\nI'm also going to talk about why people\ndon't love themselves and uh this is a\nthing that I've gone really deep into\nlooking at and um\nwhy wouldn't someone love themselves in\nthe first place and so really what it\ncomes down to is is wanting to love\nyourself more is not really about loving\nyourself what it comes down to is\naccepting yourself because love is\nbasically\npresent when you decide to accept\nyourself when you stop hating yourself\nand you stop not accepting yourself love\njust happens to be there it's not really\nabout love it's really about the\nacceptance the barrier to self-love is\nself-acceptance you know so if you can\naccept yourself fully it makes it so\nmuch easier to love yourself because\nbehind the self-judgment behind the\ncritic that you have is love and the\ndoorway to go through there is by\naccepting yourself you know you don't\nsee a baby or a child that's a toddler\nand they have self-love issues right\nI've never seen a two-year-old or a baby\nthat just has self oh I I'm dealing with\nself-love issues which means\nsomehow it's learned somewhere in in\ntheir life so if you were think of you\nknow if you have self-love issues or you\nhave an inner critic or you're really\nhard on yourself that was learned that\nwas not something that you were born\nwith and so why is it so hard to accept\nourselves\nreally because we've been socialized\nright there's many different ways that\nwe're socialized I like to call it if\nyou've been listening to podcast long\nenough domesticated the same way that\nyou have like a domesticated cat we are\ndomesticated people we're basically\ndomesticated children that are a little\nbit older is what we are right now right\nand so\nit's understandable parents are under\npressure to socialize you to make you\nfit in so that you can grow up and have\na quote-unquote great life and fit in\nwith society and\num also parents have to socialize you\nand domesticate you because kids are\nnuts right so it's also a safety thing\nyou know you ever seen a kid that's just\nlike I'm gonna jump off this two-story\nwall and you're like no you're not like\nthere's a lot of stuff that really has\nto happen where a child needs to kind of\nfit in and I don't know and I've thought\nabout this for years and years and years\nI don't know if there's a way around it\nfor those of you guys that are parents I\ndon't know if there's a way around it\nthere's going to be\nsome sort of constructs and pressure to\nbe socialized and there's also going to\nbe even if you were the perfect parent a\nchild is still going to go through some\nsort of trauma whether it's Society\nwhether it's a teacher whether it's\nbullying whether it's their friends that\nare just a crappy little teenage kids I\ndon't know it's like it's everyone's\ngoing to get punched in the face at some\npoint in time by life and that's just\ntheir path that they're on and so\nwhen you look at a child and you know\nhow they come into this world child\ndoesn't really fit in with the\nconstructs right I remember about a year\nago eight months ago probably I was out\nto dinner with my business partner his\nwife his kids and just out of nowhere\nhis three-year-old just decides he wants\nto scream at the top of his lungs inside\nof a restaurant at a nice dinner and\nit's like\nthat doesn't really fit in with what\nwe've been taught which is nice\nrestaurant quiet keep to yourself and he\njust not for any reason wasn't crying\nwasn't he just wanted to scream just let\nit all out and he has to be shushed\nright so that's like a hey no don't do\nthat you can't do that hey you can't do\nthat like how many times are we here as\na kid you can't do that no don't do that\ngood boys and girls don't do that\nchildren are meant to be seen and not\nheard we hear this over and over again\nright it's just like all of these little\nteeny tiny things add up to us thinking\nthat there's something wrong with us\nright so the uh you know a lot of times\nparents we had this as children but also\nsometimes you might do this as well a\nparent uh a lot of times will\nemotionally reward or punish a child\nbased off of how they act\nso this is really important for you to\nunderstand yourself but it's also really\nimportant if you have children or want\nto have children one of the things that\nparents do is they will emotionally\nreward\nor punish a child based off of how they\nact oh if you're a good little boy or\ngirl you're going to get my love if\nyou're a bad little boy or girl I will\nremove my love\nwhich is like the scariest thing in the\nworld for a child right there's usually\nnot a whole lot of reasoning for this\nprocess either so there's not like you\nknow the child the parents sitting down\nand saying honey I'm gonna remove my\nlove from you because you did XYZ\nright there's no reasoning for this\nprocess and so a child doesn't re\nunderstand a lot of times what they did\nwrong the amount of times and this is\nyou know just a a byproduct of what I do\nand the profession that I'm in I hear a\nlot of stories from people who talk\nabout you know their parents they did\nsomething wrong the child they did\nsomething wrong and they were\nreprimanded and they have no idea what\nthey did wrong and so what that ends up\nbuilding up in somebody is I can't trust\nmyself I don't know what I'm doing I I\nhave no idea what's going on it makes it\nreally hard to be able to trust himself\naccept himself love himself later on\ndown the road so a lot of times\nparents will use an emotional reward or\npunishment based off of how the child\nacts if you're good I'm going to give\nyou my love if you're bad I'm going to\nremove it and there's no reasoning for\nthis process child doesn't understand\nreally what's going on and realize what\nthey really realize about anything else\nas a child will realize is that they a\nlot of times with their truest self\nthey'll scream when they want to they'll\nrun they'll be loud\nthey'll throw Tantrums all of this stuff\nand at some point in time this kind of\nhappens I think for everybody\na child realizes that certain ways that\nis natural to them like they are in\ntheir natural state\nis not acceptable\nso think about this for a second we\nlearn that our Natural State screaming\nrunning around having fun laughing\nwe learn two years old three years old\nfour years old that that is not\nacceptable and so what happens is we\nstart to break trust with ourself we\ncan't trust ourself oh my gosh my\nparents are telling me that this is\nwrong well they're they're adults\nthey're older they must know better than\nI am so there must be something wrong\nwith me and we start to think there's I\nmust be there must be something wrong\nwith me there must be something wrong\nwith me and the average child is\nreprimanded eight times more than\nthey're praised\nthink about this for a second parents\nthink about this the average child is\nreprimanded eight times more than\nthey're praised and so a child is not\nconsciously thinking this but\nsubconsciously it's going in their mind\nthey're thinking I'm not good enough the\nway I am\nthe way I am my mom does not love me\nthe way I am my father doesn't love me\nthere must be something wrong with me\nbecause they're reprimanded eight times\nmore than their praise and and naturally\nwhen somebody reprimands their child\nthe child feels like the love is being\ntaken from them which is emotionally the\nworst thing they can happen to a child\nso eight times more\nchild thinks they don't know I I'm I\ndon't know what I'm doing I'm not smart\nenough my mom doesn't love me I can't\ntrust myself these are all subconscious\nthoughts these are not conscious\nthoughts coming into their head times\nmore they're thinking that they can't\ntrust himself they're not good they're\nnot a good little boy the way that they\nare\nversus I'm loved I'm accepted\nand so the child\nwhat do they do subconsciously they\nrealize they have to change themselves\nthey realize they have to change\nthemselves they have to let go of\ncertain aspects of themselves based on\nwhat their parents tell them the way\nthat they see their parents them fitting\nin with their parents the way that they\nsee they were supposed to fit in with\nSociety the way they interact with their\nbrothers and sisters what teachers tell\nthem to do and say and so a child in\norder to fit in in this society that we\nlive in has to change itself\nin in the changing of itself\nthey think there's something wrong with\nthem which is why so many people have\nproblems with self-love all a child\ncares about make it I'm gonna make it as\nsimple as possible I've done a lot of\nearly childhood development research all\nof this stuff is does my mom love me\ndoes my dad love me that's it in their\nsubcon it's going through their\nsubconscious all the time if you're the\ntype of person who reprimands your child\nby basically removing love from them\nguarantee you it's going to come down\nthe road later on down the road where\nthey're not going to love themselves\nright\nso if you're the person who's who's also\nthinking to yourself\nman my parents were like this my parents\nremoved love from me my parents\nreprimanded me a lot my parents said\nshut up kids are supposed to be seen not\nheard you hear if you're thinking to\nyourself\noh man I heard this when I was younger\nand now you're struggling with self-love\nissues and you're struggling to accept\nyourself that's the reason why it's\nbecause we have basically\nit's been ingrained in US accidentally\nnobody did this on purpose it's not like\nanybody is an and trying to do\nthis to children on purpose it's just\nkind of the way that things work in\nsociety and the way that children are\nraised\num is we think to ourselves I'm not good\nenough\nI don't know what I'm doing I don't\ntrust myself I need to change myself in\norder for my parents to love me that's\nalways going through a child's mind and\nso you know when I'm having fun and I'm\nrunning around in public my mom yells at\nme so therefore this aspect of myself is\nwrong\nright how many times have you seen\nsomebody maybe you've done this with\nyour children on accident maybe you've\nseen somebody do this where a kid is\njust in like\nfull all out expression of who they are\nrunning around screaming laughing having\nthe best time\nbut the parent wants them to be quiet\nand they yell at them to be quiet\nwhat that child\nis not consciously thinking but thinking\nin their mind is\nI am not acceptable\nthe way that I truly am I must change\nmyself to be acceptable to get my\nparents love that's really what it\nbreaks down to I'm not accepted as I\nnaturally am\nif I am acting the way I'm acting is not\nright therefore I must be wrong\nand so we learn at a very young age the\nsocialization process that we're not\ngood enough as we are and we must be a\ncertain way in order to get our parents\nalive in order to get societies love in\norder to fit in or to be quiet and if\nthat certain way is not me the result is\nI feel uh unworthiness because of\nsocialization and so your personality is\nbuilt this is really important people to\nkind of really get in your personality\na lot of times and obviously I'm over\ngeneralizing but from what I've seen of\na lot of people not every single person\nthis way but a lot of people your\npersonality is built on repressing who\nyou truly are\nthink about that one for a second your\npersonality has been built upon\nrepressing who you truly are somehow I\nam bad and I need to look to my parents\nto see if I'm right to see if I have\ntheir validation I need my parents\nvalidation and when we get older we're\nalways seeking our parents validation\nright do you love me do you love me you\nknow if I get good grades if I'm number\none and beat everybody else up if I'm\nyou know beat everybody up not beat\neverybody else up beat every every other\nchild in grades if I\num\nyou know look good enough in front of\nthe class if I end up winning the\nspelling bee if I am the best in\nbaseball you know and we start thinking\nto ourselves this is the way that we\nhave to get our parents love this way I\nhave to get society's love and then you\nknow as you get older it's like do I\nlook sexy enough and then do I did I get\nenough likes on Instagram if I make a\nlot of money people will will you you\nknow if I make a lot of money will you\nfinally accept me will you love me\nbecause I can't love myself will you\naccept me for who I am because I can't\nfully accept myself and we're trying to\ndo or become something that we\nfeel will get us accepted and so the\nissue is that we can validate ourselves\nbased off of Who We Are\nand not need anybody else's\napproval\nso really what it comes down to is when\npeople are like I struggle with\nself-love I'm like you don't actually\nstruggle with self-love you struggle to\naccept who you truly are because at some\npoint in time you learned who you truly\nare is not acceptable and so what it\ncomes back to is you need to learn how\nto accept yourself it's not our looks\nour money our cars our jobs our bodies\nor social media followings\nit's not never will be right and so what\nyou're trying to do is you're trying to\nget other people's approval\nof yourself so that you can finally\napprove yourself but you can't look to\nother people to approve you in order for\nyou to finally prove yourself you just\nhave to appreciate who you currently are\nif you're short if you're fat if you're\nskinny if you're broke as hell whatever\nit is you have to learn to accept\nyourself first before you make any\nchanges acceptance first no judging you\nlook at yourself in the mirror and\nyou're like yeah\nyep\nokay\nyeah you're a little bit chunky you're a\nlittle bit short we can work with this\nbut\nI know the the soul that's behind there\nand I appreciate you for who you are\nyou know it's just like you don't go\ninto a forest and see a bunch of trees\nand you're like oh that one's fat oh\nthat one's tall that one's skinny that\none's got broken branches ew\nyou know you don't judge trees but we\njudge ourselves and then we judge others\nthis one's better this one's worse this\none's better this one's worse and we do\nthat out of our own insecurities is\nbecause the reason why we judge other\npeople is because we don't it is an\ninsecure that we have because we don't\nfully accept ourselves and so sometimes\nwhen we look at someone and we have to\njudge them the reason why we're judging\nthem is so that we can feel like we're\nabove them like if we push them down\nthat I'm above them\nwhether it comes down to there's no one\nthat you're competing with right allow\nyourself to be a human being flaws\neverything and then learn to accept who\nyou are not by achieving not by buying\nthings not by the makeup not by the\n Instagram filter that you're\nusing\nlearn to accept yourself behind all of\nthat stuff\nReDiscover yourself ReDiscover your\ninner child like what do you love to do\nmore of that like one of the things I\nthink that people should do as you\nbecome an adult is start to ReDiscover\nwho you were as a child you know you've\nbeen socialized you've been told to go\non this path and you've been on this\npath for a while and let's be real this\npath that we go on in life can be really\nfreaking stressful and struggling and\nit's like trying to fit a a round peg\ninto a square hole\nright like what if okay yeah you've made\na little bit of money you've had some\nsuccess maybe you've got a little bit of\nyou know cushion and money right now who\nwere you as a child what did you love to\ndo\ncan you go back and ReDiscover that can\nyou just find what it was that you used\nto love to do\nwhat would that look like for you what\nwould it look like for you to decide to\nto start to go back see what that little\nchild loved start doing it more and\nstart accepting yourself because really\nwhat it comes down to is no matter how\ncrazy you are no matter how ugly you are\nno matter how fat you are no matter how\ntwisted and demented your uh comedic\nstyle is you have to just learn to\naccept yourself because love is this\nthing that is omnipresent when you just\ndecide to get out of your own way the\nthing that's keeping you from self-love\nis that you're just not accepting\nyourself when you start to accept\nyourself and you accept all the flaws of\neverything love is just the thing that\nis there there's nothing that you need\nto do so I think you need to prove\nthere's nothing need to be changed in\norder to be loved you just have to learn\nto accept yourself more and you'll find\nit much quicker so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please
