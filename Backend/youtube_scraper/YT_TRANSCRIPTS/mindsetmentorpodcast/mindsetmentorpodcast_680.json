    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to grow through the hard times\nand how to grow through suffering and\nI'm also going to teach you why I think\nit's important to use something called\napplied suffering we're going to talk\nabout how to use suffering as you would\nsay to get what you want in life and so\nwhat is applied suffering so when you\nhear the word suffering suffering sounds\nlike a bad connotation doesn't it like\nnobody really wants to suffer\nbut there's a difference between pain\nand suffering so let's let's talk about\nthat uh for a second so pain is\ninevitable in life you will have pain\nyou know if you're going to live\nhopefully to 100 years older older right\nyou're going to have some sort of pain\nin your life it could be trauma it could\nbe death of people that you know it\ncould be really hard times it could be\ncar accidents all of these different\nthings there's going to be some sort of\npain something that just happens in your\nlife pain is inevitable but suffering is\nan option\nsuffering is optional so like you could\nhave somebody really close to you that\ndoes pass away from natural causes and\nthat is painful but the suffering after\nthey die is optional that is you know\nI'm not saying don't grieve so please\ndon't get it that way what I'm saying is\nif you're resisting the way that the\nworld is and that that person has passed\naway that is optional I remember years\nago somebody actually sent me a picture\nof them getting a tattoo and it\nliterally said\num from the podcast pain is inevitable\nbut suffering is optional and uh kind of\ncrazy because I've had people send me\npictures of of tattoos before of things\nthat I say and I think that uh it's\npretty uh flattering but also pretty\nawesome as well but when you look at\npain versus suffering just remember that\npain is inevitable you're going to have\npain throughout your life but suffering\nis optional right\nbut is it possible that we could use\napplied suffering to grow right when you\nlook at pain pain is a stimulus for your\nbrain or body to make a change\nand so let me give an example let's say\nthat you're inside of the kitchen you're\ncooking up some tacos right you're\ninside the kitchen you got the burners\non and um you accidentally forget what\nyou're doing and you put your hand on\nthe hot stove you're going to feel a lot\nof pain very quickly won't you you will\nthat pain is a stimulus from your brain\nand your body saying do something\ndifferent than what you're currently\ndoing if you're at the beach and you\ndecide to go to the beach you have a\ngreat day with your friends and you're\nwalking back to your car but you don't\nput your sandals or your shoes on\nbecause your your feet are so Sandy and\nyou start walking into the middle of the\nconcrete and the concrete has been is\n120 degrees because the sun's been\nbeating down on it all day that pain at\nthe bottom of your feet is your body and\nbrain saying hey stupid do something\ndifferent whatever that means run faster\nrun back onto the sand run to your car\nput on some shoes stand on top of a\ntowel do something different that's\nusually what pain is and so when you\nfeel pain\nsomething that happens to you it's\nusually the way that your brain your\nbody the universe is speaking through\nyou to say hey do something different\nright do something different it's\nforcing you to move it's forcing you to\nchange it's forcing you to take action\nif you look at a muscle how does a\nmuscle grow\nit's got to be put through some pain\nright\nwhen you look at a plant how does a\nplant grow a plant grows from a seed\nright like there's a quote that I love\nthat's from uh honey boy which is a\nmovie that Shia LaBeouf is in and I\nthink it's his dad that says to him uh\nin order for a flower to grow from a\nseed into a flower it has to completely\ndestroy itself first right so in order\nfrom a seed to become a flower it has to\nFirst completely destroy itself when you\nlook at a lobster how does a lobster\ngrow well let me tell you real quick in\ncase you don't know about lobsters\nlobsters if I were to say hey is a\nlobster a a soft animal or a hard animal\nmost people would say a hard animal\nright like I've been lobstering before\nI've picked them up they're hard but\nwhat's interesting is that their shell\nis hard but inside the shell there's a\nreally soft animal\nyou know what's interesting is that\nlobsters never stop growing lobsters\ngrow until the day that they die but\nwhat happens is that soft animal that's\ninside of the shell the shell doesn't\ngrow and so what happens is they\neventually get to the point where it's\nso painful inside of their shell that\nthey have to go into a rock\nand they have to stay in that rock and\nbreak themselves out of the shell into a\nnew shell grows and then they can get\nout of the Rock and actually be safe and\nso what is the stimulus for growth for a\nlobster pain\npain is a stimulus for growth and so we\ncan look at our lives and we can say oh\nmy gosh there's so much pain around me\nthere's so many things I've been through\nI've been through so much in my\nlife that's so painful right now and\nthat is the way that the Universe comes\nthrough you and says hey\ndo something different pain\nis the stimulus for growth it's saying\nhey you need to grow that's really what\nit's coming through and telling you\nright\nand you know I say this all the time but\nthe universe usually comes and speaks to\nyou in a whisper and if you don't listen\nlong enough it's going to slap you right\nso sometimes you can feel like man maybe\nI should do something different maybe I\nshould change my life maybe I should\nquit my job maybe I should follow my\npassion and you kind of hear that\nwhisper and then eventually it's going\nto slap the hell out of you if you don't\nmake a change but here's the the problem\nwith pain and discomfort people feel\nfear discomfort right they try to get\naway from they could try to stay away\nfrom discomfort they try to build a box\nand stay in that box and nobody hurt me\nnobody touched me I want to stay exactly\nthe same don't don't trigger me in any\nsort of way I don't want to be triggered\nand they try to avoid discomfort at all\ncosts they try to build a life that's\ncompletely away from all of their fears\nthey'll do anything to avoid discomfort\nbut the word discomfort implies\nthat it's the opposite of your comfort\nzone\nand when you look around you\nyou've already gotten the maximum of\nwhat you can achieve in your comfort\nzone think about that for a second\nyou've already gotten the maximum of\nwhat you can achieve in your current\ncomfort zone\nso in order\nfor you to get out of your comfort zone\nwhich you if you listen to this podcast\nyou already know that you can't stay in\nyour comfort zone if you're going to\ncreate the life that you want right\nyou've got to get out of your comfort\nzone so if you look at your comfort zone\nif you want to get out of your comfort\nzone you need to seek discomfort\nso you might be trying to avoid or maybe\nfor a while you've been trying to avoid\ndiscomfort but you actually need to seek\nthat discomfort you've got to get out of\nyour comfort zone\ngotta get out of it now it's hard for us\nto do and it's really it's really\ntriggering a lot of times for us to get\nout of our comfort zone\nwhy is that well because we still kind\nof have the brains you know a little bit\nmore advanced but still kind of have the\nbrains of cavemen and so when you look\nback a million years ago two million\nyears ago whatever it was when our\nancestors were cavemen and Cave women\nwhy were they cavemen and Cave why did\nthey go into the cave they went into the\ncave for protection it was actually a\nsmart idea because when you're in the\ncave you don't have to worry about 360\nDegrees you've just got to worry about\nthe entrance right that's all that you\nhave to protect yourself with just the\nentrance super smart\nbut\nbasically our comfort zone is a modern\nday cave we stay in there to protect\nourselves because we're afraid of\nanything that's outside of it and when\nwe step out of our comfort zone it feels\nthe same as when a caveman would walk\nout of the cave in the middle of the\nnight there's those feelings of I'm\nscared something might happen maybe I\nneed to protect myself maybe I should go\nback in my comfort zone but you can at\nleast consciously now today in the\nadvanced Advanced Brain that you have go\nI'm safe\nif I go ahead and I do this or people\njudge me or any of that type of stuff I\nwill be safe if I follow my dreams right\nso discomfort is your friend\ndiscomfort is something that you should\nbe seeking\nright so for your body in order to get\nthe body that you want you're going to\nhave to be uncomfortable you might you\nmight sweat really hard your body might\nhurt you might be sore you might do such\na hard workout that you throw up but\nyour body grows and it gets better your\nbody grows and it gets better your brain\nand your mindset work the exact same way\nneuroplasticity is the brain's ability\nto change itself\nand neuroplasticity only happens when\nyou do something that pushes you that is\noutside of what you typically do you\nhave to seek discomfort this is what\napplied suffering looks like you\nactually seek things that hurt seek\nthings that are uncomfortable seek\nthings that are out of your comfort zone\nbecause that is the only way that you're\ngoing to grow the life that you want is\non the other side of discomfort on the\nother side of Applied suffering\nwhen you look at like the thing that I\nlove like I remember there's about seven\nyears ago now maybe even eight years ago\nI started doing ice baths and everybody\nthought I was crazy at the time like now\nit's like everybody does ice baths and\neveryone's got one in their house and\nand all of this stuff but I remember\nlike eight years ago people were like\nthat's the dumbest thing I've ever heard\nthere's probably no benefits to doing it\nand I was like listen\nat that point in time I was like Wim Hof\nwas just starting to become popular and\nI was like this guy Wim Hof is showing\nall of these benefits but really what I\nlike the most about it is I am coming in\ncontact with my little inner\nthat's holding me back all the time and\nto this day seven eight years later I\nstill hate getting into ice baths but I\nlove the mental benefits of it because\nit's me seeking discomfort as much as I\npossibly can if I can wake up in the\nmorning and do something that is\nextremely hard to get myself to do like\nreally outside my can you go from a warm\nbed where I could just sleep in all day\nand immediately get into an ice bath\nscrew that that sounds like it sucks and\nguess what it does but if I can do the\nvery first thing I do in the morning is\na really really hard thing\nthe entire rest of the day is easy\nI'm setting myself up for Success oh\nI've gotta you know do this thing it's\nnot that big of a deal I did a freaking\nice bath this morning I'm constantly\ntrying to push my boundaries and so\nthat's the thing that I love about\nconstantly trying to push your\nboundaries the great thing about it is\nnow that eight years later back in the\nday I used to Google what are the\nbenefits of ice baths they're like no\nbenefits that they knew of now there's\nlike study after study after study after\nstudy of showing that it helps with\ninflammation it helps with you know\nthyroid it helps with gut issues it\nhelps with all kinds of these different\nthings sore muscles and it's like\nit's awesome that has all those physical\nbenefits but I never wanted to do them\nfor the physical benefits I wanted to do\nthem because I wanted to find my Edge\nand push a little bit past it and so\nwhen you're when you're noticing that\nyou're pushing yourself past the point\nof what you're comfortable with when\nyou're getting outside of your comfort\nzone when you're applying suffering when\nyou're seeking discomfort and you start\nto notice yourself being really fearful\nfear is basically what usually stops us\nat our tracks\nso if normally you feel fear and you\nstop\nhow do you decide to keep going how can\nyou get yourself to keep going\nhmm let's think about that one for a\nsecond well if you're fearing what are\nyou fearing really what it comes down to\nis the animalistic side of us that is\nafraid of being hurt like pain or death\nit's afraid of pain or it's afraid of\ndeath and so sometimes when we're like\nokay well I'm about to create a a\npresentation for my company or I'm about\nto put up a video on YouTube or I'm\nabout to do anything that's outside of\nmy comfort zone and we feel fear\nthe the first question we need to ask\nourselves to kind of get our brain to\nclick into being present and really\nthinking about this realistically\noh my gosh I'm about to create this\nYouTube video oh my gosh some fear fear\nfear fear fear\ntake a step back is this going to kill\nme\nno it's not going to kill me that's\nimmediately showing my brain\ndude you're safe it's not a big deal\nthis YouTube video that you're gonna put\non is not going to kill you is it going\nto kill me\nabsolutely not could this help me grow\nyes\nyou know I'm really uncomfortable\nputting myself out there could it help\nme grow yes\nokay\nthen like Rob said I'm really\nuncomfortable doing this I should\nprobably seek discomfort because it will\nhelp me grow\nokay next question am I safe\nam I safe all too often I find that when\nwe're stuck in in fear when we're stuck\nin not wanting to do something when\nwe're stuck in anxiety when we're stuck\nin sadness a lot of times we're fearing\nsomething and one of the things that's\njust really important for us to do\nis just remind your your conscious\nsubconscious and also your nervous\nsystem that you're safe\nand so you can sit there and I remember\na true story let me just tell you a true\nstory\num a couple months ago my wife and I\nwent to uh Mexico and we went to Mexico\nwe went to this place that's uh that's a\npark and it's called senses and it's\nthis park that you know it's got all of\nthese optical illusions and physical\nIllusions and all this stuff and there's\nthis one thing that I had seen online\nand everyone's like you got to do this\nit's so interesting it's so cool it's\nnot like anything I've ever done and um\nit's this dark room is what it's called\nwhere it's a dark room and that's all\nthat I knew about it I was like cool\nlet's go do it\nso we go and they're like before you go\nin you have to watch this video and I'm\nwatching this video and it says you're\nif you are claustrophobic you should\nabsolutely not go through this and I\nlooked at Lauren and I was like\noh and I felt like a rush of fear\nbecause I'm super claustrophobic I don't\nknow where it came from I don't know why\nI am but I saw this huge rush of fear\nand then it said you can only there's\nthere's seven different Lanes you have\nto walk by yourself and I'm like are you\nkidding me\nlike I can't walk with Lauren in through\nhere I've got to walk by myself into a\nroom where I can't see anything it's\ncompletely dark and it's actually like a\nit's not just a room like it's you\nliterally walk\nhundreds of yards and the whole the\nwhole experience is it it use it takes\nyour sight out and it makes you uses\nsight takes site out it uses smell it\nuses touch it uses sound and it makes\nyou feel like you're in a desert and it\nmakes you feel like you're at a beach\nand it makes you feel like you're you\nknow in all of these different places\nand I first walk in I'm like okay I'll\ntry it I guess like I'll try it and I\nwalk in and I it goes in and it does\nlike an S turn and when it does the S\nturn I can see nothing I'm like the I'm\ntalking like the blackest black I've\never seen there was nothing\nand immediately my brain freaks out\nyou're gonna die you're gonna die you're\ngoing to die you're going to die you're\ngoing to die and I'm like\nokay let me what's the what's the thing\nthat I always do what's the thing I\nalways teach people gotta breathe okay\nI'm gonna breathe into it I'm gonna\nbreathe\nstart getting into breathing I'm\nliterally standing there in the middle\nof this thing\nthis really extremely dark room and you\nknow the walls are all like itchy and\nthey feel like a desert and there's sand\non my feet and all this stuff and I can\nfeel like absolute Terror in my body and\nI said I started breathing and I said\nI'm safe I'm safe I'm safe\nI'm safe I'm safe I'm safe and so I'm\nlike let me take a couple more steps I'm\nsafe I'm safe I'm safe and I kept taking\na little bit more steps a little bit\nmore steps and then I stopped saying I'm\nsafe and I notice that the little Fear\nPart of Me came up again you're gonna\ndie you're gonna die you're gonna die\nand I said I'm safe I'm safe I'm safe\nand really what I came down to I was\nable to walk through this whole thing\nand I got through it and I saw Lauren at\nthe other end after it and she's like I\ndidn't think you're gonna make it\nbecause that freaked me out and I'm not\nclaustrophobic I was like yeah it took\nlike every ounce of energy to say\nI am terrified of this\nbut I have to practice what I preach\nwhich is find your fear and go past it\nand so what happened though is I kept\ntelling myself reminding my brain\nreminding my subconscious reminding my\nnervous system I'm safe I'm safe man\nlike I'm not gonna die inside of this\nthis amusement park because I'm walking\nthrough a dark room\nso I kept doing it I got through it but\nreally comes down to is the reason why I\nsay that is because your nervous system\nwants to know you're safe so if you can\nrepeat to yourself when you're getting\noutside of your comfort zone that you're\nsafe it makes it easier to go through it\nright so I'm going to give you an\nassignment I want you to do something\ntoday that makes you uncomfortable like\ncompletely uncomfortable there's two\nthings I want you to try out number one\nI want you to lay down at a coffee shop\nor a store or something like that one of\nmy favorite things is when I talk about\nthis I've talked about this before in\nthe past and I'll get videos and tagged\nin Instagram stories like people laying\ndown in Walmart there's one where a lady\nwas laying down in the middle of Walmart\nand the lady who worked at Walmart was\nlike ma'am are you okay and she's like\noh yeah I'm good I'm just laying down\nand she's like oh\nokay and then walks away as either\neither lay down you could do one of\nthese or both these ask uh I'm sorry\nexcuse me I'll get to that one in a\nsecond lay down in the middle of the\nstore\n30 45 seconds just try it out\nor and or ask for a 20 discount\nsomewhere ask for a 20 discounted coffee\nshop whatever it might be right it seems\nsilly and it's going to strike some fear\ninside of you but why\noh my God I'm gonna get dirty from\nlaying on the floor okay wash your\nclothes not really a big deal you'll be\nfine right why are you afraid of doing\nit\nget used to being uncomfortable get used\nto pushing yourself out of your comfort\nzone why are you afraid of asking for a\ndiscount because it's not what people do\nwhy are you afraid of laying on the\nfloor because it's outside of what\nSociety does we're trying to push the\nboundaries if you want to be different\nthan everybody else you have to start\ndoing things differently than everybody\nelse\nthat is how you grow outside of your\ncomfort zone by seeking discomfort and\nusing applied suffering so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me in at\nRob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r and I'm Gonna Leave\nYou the same way I leave every
