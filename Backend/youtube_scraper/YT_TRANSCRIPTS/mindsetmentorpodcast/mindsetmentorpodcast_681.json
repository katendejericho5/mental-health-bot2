    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to stop being so overwhelmed\nI'm going to give you a five-step\nprocess very very simple process to help\nyou stop being so overwhelmed right so\nwhen you look at the world\nthere's a lot that's happening in the\nworld right we can look and be like if\nwe look at all of the things and we can\nwatch the news and see all the things\nand we watch this news station that new\nstation man it can seem like there's a\nlot of stuff going on it can seem really\nscary right we can get caught up in it\nbut then also besides what's happening\nin the world there's also your life\nright there's things happening in your\nlife you've got kids and you've got a\njob and you've got bills to pay and\nyou've got all of these things that you\nneed to do and if you were to look at\nall of them and bills that are coming up\nand deadlines and the kids have to do\nthis you still gotta do the laundry like\nit can seem really overwhelming but\nit doesn't have to be overwhelm is a\nperspective and so\num\nyou know I think the world's always\ngoing to be crazy I think you're always\ngoing to be busy\nso instead of trying to fix the world\ninstead of trying to fix other people\nwhy don't we fix us right that's really\nwhat it comes down to the first thing I\nwant to say about\num overwhelm is this there's a lot of\ntimes when I will I work with business\nowners right what I work with in\nbusiness owners is the mindset of the\nbusiness owner because I know that the\nthing that's holding a business back\nfrom growing is nothing well there's\nother things but majority of the time\nlike 95 of time that I see it's the mind\nof the business owner if that is\nrestrictive it will restrict the growth\nand one of the things that I hear from a\nlot of business owners is like oh my\ngosh this is going on right now and I'm\nso overwhelmed or it's overwhelming me\nand the very first thing I always tell\nthem and this is not part of the\nfive-step process but I want you to\nunderstand this first is when someone\nsays well you know my employees are over\nthis has gone on with my employees and\nthis has happened this has happened and\nit's really overwhelming me I say no no\nwe got to change your verbiage first\nfirst off\nthe things going on with your employees\nare not overwhelming you you are\noverwhelming yourself based off of your\nperspective of your employees can we\nagree to that and that's the thing I\nalways want to get people to First is\ninstead of blaming something externally\noutside of them oh I have the kids that\nI have to do this for and I have a job\nand I have deadlines and I have this\nthis going on and this going and you\nstart to blame everything externally if\nyou blame externally you can't change\nanything that's external what you can\nchange is you in what you do and so the\nfirst thing I always take people back to\nis nothing is overwhelming you you are\noverwhelming yourself that's the first\nthing we really need to get clear on\nright so if you want to blame external\nthat this ain't the podcast for you this\nis how to change your perspective and\nget yourself out of overwhelm so that\nyou can take the right action to make\nyourself feel less overwhelmed so that's\nthe first thing I want to talk about it\nand just really understand is that you\nare overwhelming yourself\nso we need to get you out of it so how\ndo you get yourself out of it let's dive\ninto it the first thing\nis to breathe\nyou will list this podcast long enough\nwhenever anything happens whenever I get\noverwhelmed which happens a couple times\na week the very first thing that I do is\nI take a step back mentally from the\nsituation because usually 99.9 of the\ntime when I am overwhelmed with things\ngoing on my business and stuff I have to\ndo it's because I'm looking at\neverything at once and thinking that\neverything has to be done immediately\nwhen in reality in this very moment in\nthis present moment there's nothing that\nhas to be done so what I do is I take a\nstep back\nI take 60 breaths I go into the nose I\ngo out to the mouth I do it you know in\nthe nose out the mouth when I breathe\nout I breathe out like I'm breathing out\nthrough a straw so it is a long exhale\nbecause a long exhale actually slows\nyour heart rate down and releases more\ncarbon dioxide which allows your body to\nrelax a little bit more because when\nyour emotions are high your logic is low\nand so when you're really really caught\nup and overwhelmed and you're\noverwhelming yourself you're not\nthinking really clear\nand so what you want to do is just do\nyour breathing and think of something\nthat you're grateful for\nthink of something that that's positive\nin your life even if it's just like man\nit hasn't been sunny in a few days and\ntoday the sun came out I'm really\ngrateful for that right and you start\nthinking of something that you're\ngrateful for so that you can start to\nPivot your mindset that you are\noverwhelming yourself with and get out\nof the stress so that you could come\nfrom a positive place because when you\ncome from a positive place of gratitude\nit makes it easier to come up with ways\nto get yourself out of overwhelm right\nwhen emotion is high logic is low which\nis even more stressful because you feel\nlike you should be doing something but\nyou can't figure out what you should be\ndoing right so the first thing\njust get better at just taking yourself\nout of your body out of your mind all of\nthat and then just\nfeeling into the breath okay\nthat's the first thing second thing that\nI find that really helps people out is\nwhen you are overwhelmed the reason why\nyou're overwhelmed is because you're\nthinking about everything\nall at once everything everywhere all at\nonce\nall of that stuff is what you're\nthinking about and you're it's\noverwhelming\nyou let me say that again you are\noverwhelming yourself because of the\nfact that you're actually trying to\nthink of all of the problems and all of\nthe solutions and when they need to be\ndone and doing all of them right now and\nso what you want to do step number two\nafter you do your breathing is to write\neverything on your mind on a piece of\npaper get it all out of your head\neverything all of the BS that you got to\ndo everything that's stressing you out\nevery person that you're stressed out\nabout all of your thoughts all of your\nfeelings allow your mind to just release\nit all and put it on the page one of the\nthings I find that helps people so much\nis just literally\nby putting it on the page there's\nalready another level of relaxation\nbecause it's like your brain has been\nbeen holding on to and it's been\nbouncing around your brain 40 different\nthings and trying to figure out the\nsolutions and what you got to do and\nwhen you're going to do them and when\nyour your brain knows okay it's on paper\nit's like another level of relaxation\nbecause it's when it's on paper what's\nimportant about knowing something that's\non paper is when it's on paper it can be\nplanned\nright it makes it really easy to figure\nout what needs to be done\nand when it needs to be done and how to\ndo it when it's on paper and so now that\nit's on paper it's out of your head it's\non paper it can live there forever\nnow let's go through each one of these\nthings\nand ask yourself you know when I'm\nlooking at this\nwhat is it that's stressing me out what\nis in the the actions that I need to\ntake and what I would do is find the\nmost important one like the thing that\nis that that has the most energy around\nit or feels like it has the the soonest\ndeadline or the thing that's holding you\nback the most or really really making\nyou feel it and that's we're going to go\ninto number three which is\ndeciding which one is the one that you\nwant to take action on next and figuring\nout what is the next action to take\nright because when you're thinking about\nall of the things that need to be done\nyou're not just thinking about the next\nstep you're thinking about the next 5\n000 steps and that's really\nwhen you're thinking about that way you\ncan really overwhelm yourself because\nyou can't take all the steps at once you\ncan always take step one to two to three\nto four to five all of that and so\nyou've got to take the next step and so\nyou have to now that you're looking at\nthis piece of paper you identify what's\nthe one that stress you out the most or\nwhich one if you got an accomplished\nwould make you feel the best and you\nidentify the next best action to take\nusually when you're overwhelmed you're\nthinking about 46 different action items\nto take you know and the five things you\nneed to do in your business and the\nseven things you have to do with your\nkids and the 18 things that are wrong in\nyour life that's too much a human can\nonly do one thing at a time you can only\ndo one thing at a time multitasking is a\nlot you can't do 40 different things at\none time so what it comes down to is\nwhat you know so part of you is usually\nstressing out because you want all of\nthe things to be done but you can only\ndo one thing at a time and so if you\nwant to start to feel better progress\nhelps you feel better\nprogress equals happiness as Tony\nRobbins always says so if you feel even\nthough things aren't done but you feel\nlike you're making valuable steps in the\nright direction usually those will help\nyou feel a whole lot better and so you\nyou just identify what's the biggest\npriority and what's the next best action\nthat I can take right all right now once\nyou feel that your mind is calm down\nit's on paper you know what action to\ntake get your physical body moving\none of the things that's hard to do is\nthat if you've been stagnant for the\nentire day it's it's a lot harder if\nyou've been sitting in a you know\nsitting on your couch or maybe you've\nbeen at the computer you know it's two\no'clock and you've been at the computer\nall day long and your body hasn't been\nmoving there's no momentum on the side\nof physical action and so what you've\ngot to do is you actually got to start\nthe momentum\nyou've heard me say it a million times\naction leads to more action inaction\nleads to more inaction so if you've been\ninactive physically not moving your body\nmuch today except for maybe just your\nfingers because you've been typing into\ncomputer and your eyes because you've\nbeen looking at the screen\nget your physical body moving whatever\nit is that you got to do I don't give a\ndamn what it is but get your heart rate\nup do jumping jacks do push-ups go for a\nwalk a lot of times we're overwhelmed\nwe're thinking about all the stuff that\nneeds to be done\nbut we're not doing any of them\nand usually if you're just sitting on\nthe couch doing nothing\nit's really hard to get yourself into\nForward Motion it let me it's not hard\nit feels like it would be hard to get\nyourself into Forward Motion like if I'm\nsitting on the couch and I'm like oh man\nI gotta get up and do XYZ and I start\nthinking about it versus actually doing\nit you've done this before right\nand then you think about oh man I gotta\ndo this thing and this thing is coming\nup and\noh God it's gonna be just so hard to do\nand I've got so many other things to do\ntoday and instead of actually getting my\nass up I'm sitting on the freaking couch\nwhich is not helping me get towards\nanywhere right so the Journey of a\nThousand Miles begins with a single step\ninstead of thinking about what I need to\ndo I've just got to take the first step\nso I've got to get my physical body up\nand do something I don't care what it is\nit's got to get the heart rate up you\ncan go into YouTube right now and you\ncan go and put five minute home workout\nand you can do a quick five minute home\nworkout get that heart rate up but you\nneed some Forward Motion physically\nbecause action creates more action so\nyou've got to if you've been inactive\nyou've got to get into action because\naction creates more action a lot of\ntimes you know there's actually been a\nlot of studies on this is a lot of\npeople wake up and think like well I\nhope I'm motivated today because if I'm\nmotivated then I'll take action\nand they're like well I just don't feel\nas motivated today so that's why I\ndidn't get anything done right like how\nmany times have you heard somebody say\nthat before well I wasn't really\nmotivated today so that's why I didn't\nget anything done that's a bunch of BS\nbecause psychology fact psychologists\nhave actually found that it's not you\nshould be searching for motivation and\nthen makes it easier to take action it's\nthat when you take action you become\nmore motivated so instead of searching\nfor motivation to take action you need\nto take action to give yourself a chance\nto be more motivated so what's the next\nthing that you need to do get your\nphysical body moving and figure it out\nright and that takes us number five\nwhich is just freaking do the first\nthing\nnow that your body's had some movement\nride that momentum into the most\nimportant thing\nit's really\nkind of interesting I work with so many\nbusiness owners\nand the solution to their problems is\nalways so easy it's take action\nand then I talk to them\nand they don't take the action\nand I'm like why didn't you take the\naction like well I had this to do and I\nwas kind of overwhelmed and there's all\nof these things and I'm like do you see\nthat you are your own worst like\nthinking about it\ndoesn't help try to think about your\nproblems is like trying to get yourself\nout of quicksand by running faster\nyou're only going to go deeper faster\nand so what it comes down to is you've\ngot to figure out what it is that you\nneed to do\nand then you've just got to take action\ndoesn't matter how you feel\nyou know the most successful people that\nI've found are not people that wait to\nbe motivated in that stuff what they do\nis they take action consistent\nconsistently they are not more gifted\nthere are a lot of times definitely not\nsmarter than other people but what they\ndo is they just take action every day\nand they take action here's a key Point\nregardless of how they feel usually when\nyou start taking action you start\nfeeling better and so you know you you\nfocus on one thing\nand one thing only what is the action\nthat you need to take right now become\nlike a a sniper rifle versus a shotgun\nlike if you see a shotgun you shoot a\nshotgun and it has all these pellets\nthat go everywhere that's how a lot of\npeople try to be productive everywhere\nall at once trying to get it all done\nbut the most successful people that I\nfound are like a sniper rifle like they\nare looking down the scope and they're\nthey're going for one thing and one\nthing only today and they're focusing on\nthat one thing and accomplishing that\none thing the most important thing of\ntheir day just imagine if every day of\nyour life the only thing that you got\ndone like besides obviously feeding the\nkids and that type of stuff but as far\nas moving the needle forward in your\nlife the only thing that you got done\nwas the most important thing and that\nwas it\nwouldn't you be like five or ten times\nmore successful in a year if you just\ngot the most important thing done\nso that's what I mean by a sniper rifle\nlike you've got to be looking down the\nbarrel and say that's the one thing\nthat I've got to go for today\nright it's hard to get overwhelmed\nwhen you're thinking about one thing\nthe problem is you're thinking about too\nmany things and think about all the\nthings that need to be done and every\nsingle step it needs to be done nope one\nthing what is your most important task\nfor today and tell yourself if that's\nthe only thing that I get done and that\nmoves the needle today was a successful\nday\nso that's your five steps to stop being\noverwhelmed number one get yourself into\nbreathing number two write down\neverything on your mind with pen and\npaper number three ask yourself what's\nthe next best action to take and\nidentify it number four get your\nphysical body moving and number five\ntake action on that first thing so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this
