    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to think different how to\nthink outside of the box because if you\nlook at all of the people that are like\nyour Heroes\nthey're probably a lot different than\nthe average person right so if you look\nat whether it's like a Steve Jobs or\nwhether it's the rock or whether it's\nElon Musk or whoever it might be they\nthink differently than the average\nperson thinks right if you look like\nAlan Watts if you look at Wayne Dyer\nlike they think so differently than the\naverage person does and I think what\nhappens is we are raised and as children\nwe are completely outside of the box and\nin order to you know make sure that kids\nfit in with Society we get domesticated\nis the easiest way of saying it\nour parents\ndo their best but basically what they do\nis they they put us inside of a box\nsociety puts us inside of a box School\nputs us inside of a box and we aren't\nreally trained of how to get outside of\nthe box and to think differently but the\npeople who you probably respect most are\nnot normal they're different they think\noutside the box and\nthat's probably one things you\nappreciate about them right\nso we're going to talk about how to if\nyou've been raised inside of a box and\nyou feel like you're stuck inside of a\nbox how to start thinking differently\nthis will require some of your time but\nit will it will take some time in the\nfront end but save you a lot of time on\nthe back end so to start off let me tell\nyou a story just to kind of have all of\nthis make sense in the early 1900s there\nwas a guy that had a burger joint and he\nwas obsessed with numbers and facts and\nfigures and so they had you know the\nsoda machines they had the burgers the\nfries all of this and he optimized every\nsingle thing that he could optimize they\ncould make burgers faster they could\nmake sure that they pour the perfect\nversion of soda they can make sure that\nthey make the fries the perfect way and\nthen they make them as fast as possible\nand he optimized every single part of\nhis business but he realized that there\nwould still sometimes be a line of\npeople and he realized if he wanted more\nbusiness\nand to make more money he needed to\nfigure a way to funnel people into his\nbusiness quicker and so he kept trying\nto figure out what what could he do like\nwhat how could he make it and you can't\nreally I can't make the burgers any\nfaster they're basically as fast they\ncan go I can't make sure the soda is\ngoing any faster it's only so fast\nbefore it's too much gets too many\nbubbles and then it doesn't work and it\ntakes longer to do it can't make fries\nany faster can't do this faster so he's\nlike you know what I think I'm I'm too\nstuck in my business I need to go see\nwhat other businesses are doing see if I\ncan get some ideas to help my business\ngrow from businesses that are completely\ndifferent than mine and so what he did\nwas he started going to all these every\nday he would visit another company so\nhe'd visit like a grocery store\nand then he would visit you know a hair\nsalon and he would visit and he was\ntrying to basically pull ideas from\npeople outside of his industry to see if\nhe could use it in his business and one\nday everything completely changed for\nhim and he walked into a bank\nand his business partner was like why\nare you going to go to a bank like\nwhat's a bank going to be able to teach\nus they're so old school when he noticed\nthat on the side of the bank they were\nbuilding something so he walked into the\nbank and he starts talking to him and\nhe's like hey what's that thing that\nyou're building outside and they go oh\nwell what we've actually done is decided\nto build something called a\ndrive-through which means that the the\ncustomers they can come in if they want\nto but they don't even have to get out\nof their cars and we can still help them\nand it was like a light bulb and he went\noh my God\nI've never thought of that I've always\nthought about the customer coming into\nthe business and trying to speed\neverything up that way what if we also\nbuilt a drive-through for our burger\njoint\nthat way we could have people in line\nthere and we could have people in line\ninside as well and what he did was he\nbuilt the first drive through for a fast\nfood company\nand grew his business to another\nlocation because he had so much business\ncoming in he needed another location\nanother location another location and\neventually they ended up selling for\nMcDonald's and McDonald's took his exact\nformat of how he built a drive-through\nand so when you look at that\nyou think huh that's interesting because\nthe way that he got that idea was by\ngoing to other\nbusinesses that had nothing to do with\nhis business by thinking outside of the\nbox and so I heard this story\nfrom Jeff Hoffman and Jeff Hoffman in\ncase you don't know is I interviewed him\nyears ago years and years ago in this\npodcast and uh he's a billionaire now\nbut he founded priceline.com and he does\nthis thing that he calls info sponging\nin info sponging is what he will do is\nevery single morning he will learn\nsomething that has nothing to do with\nhis business he'll either read a\ndifferent magazine he'll go into\ndifferent website so like you know he\nwas in in the airline industry and he uh\nhe was like you know what I'm going to\nread about scuba diving and see what\nthere is in scuba diving I'm going to\nread about boxing see what there is in\nboxing I'm going to read about all of\nthese different things then he was\nreading an article\nabout produce and um and what he would\ndo is every time he would learn\nsomething he would give himself an hour\nevery single morning Monday through\nFriday and he would learn something new\nand then what he would do is he would\ntake a three by five card and he would\nwrite down as much as he could on that\nthree by five card and then just throw\nit in a box and then at the end of the\nmonth he would look through that box and\nsee if any of those things that he\nlearned throughout the week now that\nhe's had some space from them at the end\nof the month he would see if there's\nanything they learned throughout the\nmonth if anything could be used in his\nbusiness and one day he was reading\nabout produce and he was reading how\nbananas actually become cheaper as they\nget closer to going bad right so ripe\nbananas are more expensive than bananas\nthat are about to you know be over\nripened and and so what they what he\nrealized he wrote that down okay no\nworries all right bananas end up being\ncheaper\nas they uh as they age\nand he threw it inside the box he came\nback at the end of the month and he was\nreading through and he's like hold on\nthis banana thing\nif bananas are cheaper when they're\nabout to go bad I wonder if these\nAirlines because he was already in the\nairline industry I wonder if these\nAirlines\nhave seats that are not sold\nand if they're not sold I wonder if they\nwould sell them for cheaper so they at\nleast make some money off of them versus\nno money\nhe wondered if the same thing would\nhappen for flights\nand it was it was the same thing so he\nstarted talking to Delta and he started\ntalking to Americans and he started\ntalking to Southwest and he said Hey\nlisten\nI'm in the airline industry if I set up\na website that uh I couldn't know when\nyou have open flights and open seats if\nI could make them cheaper to at least\nsell them would you give them to me at a\ndiscounted rate and they're like yeah we\nwould definitely do that so we started\npriceline.com where you could bid on\nflights and the airline would either\naccept or reject your offer\nso if it's two days before and you're\nlike I need to hop on this flight the\nflight's now seven hundred dollars and\nyou're like um I'll offer 500. you would\noffer 500 and within 30 minutes you'd\nhear back yes or no from the airline\nand guess what he sold that company for\nover a billion dollars but he sold it\nfor over a billion dollars in the way\nthe idea came up was because he was\nreading about bananas right think about\nthat for a second sometimes we're in our\nindustry for so long like I've been in\nthe self-development industry for so\nlong at this point 17 years I could use\nlooking outside of the box if you've\nbeen an insurance agent for the past 25\nyears you could probably learn from\npeople outside of the box because we get\ntaught these are the exact systems to\nsuccess which a lot of those end up\nworking but sometimes it requires us\nthinking differently it requires us to\nbe different\nso that brings us to what I call the\nfive hour rule so the world is changing\nso fast\nhow do we keep up like artificial\nintelligence is coming through have you\ntried chat GPT yet it's amazing some\npeople are afraid of all these things\nbut with the invention in the the\ngrowing of AI\nif you're not trying to learn what's\ngoing on if you're not trying to get\nbetter if you're not trying to think\noutside of the box there's a chance that\nyou could be left behind in the next\nthree to five years\nso what can you do to start thinking\noutside of the box so start learning\nabout new technology to start seeing if\nyou could use this technology to come in\nand help you create better things\nso the five hour rule is really simple\nhere's what you do you spend one hour\nper day learning something new five days\na week you could do this Monday through\nFriday if you want to hell you could do\nit seven hours a week if you want to and\nit could be a seven hour rule for you\nbut you learn something completely\ndifferent outside of your industry\noutside of what you do outside of what\nyou normally read about outside of the\nnormal news stations you follow the\nnormal magazines you read the normal\nwebsites you go on to and you just find\nyourself on a different website what if\nyou went to drummer Magazine's website\nand see what's up with the drums it went\nto scuba diving website and you see\nwhat's up at scuba.com and then the next\nday you decide to go to you know\nbali.com and see what's going on over in\nBali and you start going to other places\nand you start learning about new things\nbecause what happens is sometimes we get\nso stuck in doing the same things over\nand over again\nit leaves no room for creativity and\nwhen you learn something new you read\nsomething new you watch something new\nand inspires you to start to be more\ncreative and really that creativity in\nyour business in your industry in your\nlife could be the thing that completes\nthese completely sets you on another\npath right if if Jeff Hoffman can read\nabout bananas and build a multi-billion\ndollar company and become a billionaire\nfrom it because he was reading about\nproduce and how bananas are cheaper\nI'm sure you could read something that's\ncompletely outside of the box and start\nto figure something out of the way it\ncould work in whatever it is that you do\nBen Benjamin Franklin is actually famous\nfor doing this this is actually where\nJeff Hoffman got it from he learned that\nBen Benjamin Franklin would do this he\nwould learn about things that were\ncompletely foreign to him to see if\nmaybe he could try to be better right if\nyou look at\npeople like Leonardo da Vinci Leonardo\nda Vinci what he used to do is he used\nto uh he would go through and he was he\nwas painting and he was sculpting and he\nwas trying to get better and he thought\nto himself huh you know what I wonder if\nI actually if if it'd be possible for me\nto actually look at some corpses and be\nable to measure corpses now this might\nsound weird or you might not want to be\ndoing this it's probably not able to be\ndone now but back in his day what he\nwould do is he would actually take a he\nwould actually measure the difference\nbetween like this knuckle to this\nknuckle and this knuckle to this knuckle\nand then your your palm to your wrist\nand then your wrist to your your elbow\nand your elbow to your arm and he would\nmeasure these out and actually start to\nfind these these perfect perfect\nmeasurements of if you measure enough\ncorpses you're going to see that there's\na measurement that shows you this is how\nthe perfect body the average body is\nbuilt and so that's why when you see\nstuff that he did you see stuff that\nMichelangelo did you see like the statue\nof David if you've ever been in Florence\nand it's like the most perfect thing\nyou've ever seen in your life hundreds\nof years later and you can see the veins\nin the guy's arm that's going up his\nforearm the reason why they were so good\nat this is because they went outside of\nthe box and started learning things that\nother artists were not learning and so\nif you constantly stay on top of what's\ngoing on in the world\nand you always are committed to being a\nstudent always learning you'll always\nget better\nI started doing research on like what\npeople have been outside of the box and\nstarted thinking differently and how\nthey became famous and I people that\ncame up were like Oprah Warren Buffett\nTony Robbins all have a commitment to\nlearning they never rest in the laws of\nthe success they're always trying to\nlearn and grow and get better\nyou know I was at an event not too long\nago and\num in order to to be at the event it's\nyou know it's\nif I'm being honest with you to actually\nbe at the event that The Mastermind it's\na hundred thousand dollars a year and\num you know everybody has a pretty good\nidea of everyone's net worth and there's\none guy that sold this company\num a few years ago for a billion dollars\ncash and he owned one him and his wife\nowned a hundred percent of it and um\nwhat's cool about it is he sold his\ncompany but if you go to the event it\nwas wild because this guy literally\nyou'd look at me like well he's worth a\nbillion dollars he could just retire he\ndoesn't have to do anything\nwhat's cool about him though is every\ntime I saw him every day he was in the\nvery front very middle right in front of\nthe stage and he always had a pen and\npaper with him and he was taking more\nnotes than anybody else so this guy has\nprobably a higher net worth than almost\nevery single person in the room combined\nbut he's sitting there being a student\nand then he would walk up to people and\nhe'd be like what do you do oh cool tell\nme about that it was like this a sponge\nlike he the the most successful people\nthat I know are the biggest sponges and\nhe was asking questions oh how do you do\nthat well tell me about that he would\nwrite down these notes from everybody\nthat he met and so when you start to\nthink about this it's like yeah will\nthis require some extra time in the\nfront end of your life right short term\nit will take time away from you it's\ngoing to take an hour a day but long\nterm you're talking about massive gains\nin your life from what could be helping\nyou hit a home run at some point in time\nwith your industry with your life with\nyour\nrelationship all of that so if you take\na step back you realize there's 168\nhours in the week and you're telling me\nthat you can't budget five\nto learning to Growing to creating new\nneurosynaptic Connections in your brain\nthink about that for a second\nyou can't take five hours out of 168\nif you can't that's really not that\nimportant for you so find out what time\nof day works best for you to do this\nsome people love doing it in the morning\nsome people like doing it in the\nafternoon some people like doing an\nevening for me I like doing it in the\nthe early to late afternoon I usually\nwork on all my work throughout the day I\ndo all my creative stuff and then I'm\nlike okay you know what I'm gonna do I'm\ngonna learn something new and here's the\nthing look at your phone and see how\nmuch time you spend on social media\nif you're an average person it's like\none to three hours a day sometimes four\nfive six hours a day and you're telling\nme you don't have time to do one hour a\nday to learn replace your social media\nwith learning\nwhat should you be learning well\nwhere do you want to go when you look\ninto the future does what's what's\nexciting to you what scares you is\nartificial intelligence scary to you\nwell what if you just learn about that\nfor a little while what if you tried it\nout when if you want to chat gbt and saw\nwhat you could use it for went under\nYouTube and started seeing tutorials on\nhow to use AI\nso what do you think\nwhere do you want to go and what do you\nneed to know to get there\nthat's where I would start and then from\nthere just budget an hour of your time\nto learn and grow and become better\nevery single day and that right there is\nhow you think outside the box by using\nsomething that I call the five hour rule\nfive hours per week one hour five days a\nweek that's all you have to do so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories and tag me at\nRob dial Junior
