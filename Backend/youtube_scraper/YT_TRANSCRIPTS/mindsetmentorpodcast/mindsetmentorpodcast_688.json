    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to be talking to\nyou about how to handle the really\nreally hard times when they come up in\nyour life and I'm not going to be\ntalking about like the little things I'm\nactually going to be talking about some\nof the really the hardest things that\nhave ever happened to you and\nif you're going to go through the rest\nof this life and you're gonna be around\nfrom their 20 30 40 50 years there's\ngonna be some really hard times and\nthat's just the way that it goes right\nand to start off I want to tell you a\nstory\nand this is a story about a friend of\nmine that happened not too long ago and\nso I'm going to keep it a little bit\nvague so that my friends details don't\ncome out and that you guys don't know\nwho he is or any of that type of stuff\nbut I'm going to tell you the story as\nmuch as I can of it and not give too too\nmuch of details but it is a absolutely\ntrue story so recently A friend of mine\ngot arrested for some incredibly serious\ncharges nothing crazy he didn't hurt\nanyone none of that type of stuff but he\ncould be facing\nyou know\n10 to 15 years of jail time uh for what\nhe did and so it had nothing to do with\nanybody else it had specifically to do\nwith just Him and I've been friends with\nthem for for quite some time now and he\ndid something that he shouldn't have and\nnow he's got to live with the\nconsequences of what he did and um\nyou know the other day basically uh he\nended up getting out of jail and uh then\nhe called me to have a conversation that\nis uh kind of kind of what I do is I do\nthis I also help my clients then also I\nhave friends that reach out to me when\n hits the fan and it's all over the\nwalls and uh that is just a uh a\nbyproduct of my profession and um and so\nto give you some background uh he is\nincredibly smart he's super talented and\nuh makes really good money too but um\nas long as I've known him which is you\nknow a long time he's never really\nwanted to do what he does and he makes a\nbunch of money but he just kind of went\nthat way because that's what he did in\ncollege that's what kind of worked out\nfor him and now he is feels kind of\nstuck and he's been wanting to build a\nbusiness specifically off of his skill\nset that he's incredibly good at and\nonce again I am being intentionally\nvague to protect this person but he's\nbeen wanting to follow a passion\num for a really long time basically as\nlong as I have known him\nand um once he saw me build my business\nin the mindset Mentor in all the stuff\nthat I do he's been around since before\n2015 when I first started building all\nof it he started thinking man like is\nthere a way like I'm seeing Rob that is\nRob's following his passion and he was\nexcited about in the very beginning and\nthen he saw everything kind of explode\nover the past few years you know four\nfive six seven eight nine years and he's\nbeen seeing it explode and he's like man\n I wanted to start when he started I\nshould have started when he started you\nknow now I'm at this point I still need\nto start maybe I would be as far along\nas he is if I would have started and so\nwe had this conversation he gets out of\njail he's out on bail all of this stuff\nand\num I thought it was just important for\nme to talk to him and um ask him how he\nfelt and he's talking about how he feels\nand obviously he feels like doesn't\nfeel good he's got some very serious\ncharges and all of this life that he has\nbuilt could be you know taken away from\nhim and his exact phrase that he said to\nme was I feel like I threw my life away\nI feel like I threw my life away\nand then what he said was this is the\nworst thing that's ever happened to me\nand I was talking to him and you know\njust to be honest with you the way that\nI speak to everybody is is exactly how I\nspeak on this podcast I try not to be\nany different on this podcast than I am\nwith my friends and I am with my mom all\nof that and so I have found that uh I\ndon't really do well at sugarcoating\nbecause I don't think that that helps\nsomebody to sugarcoat for them uh the\nway that I usually speak with people and\nhelp people when I'm talking to them is\nno sugar coating very direct but also\nwith a loving energy and so you know\nwhat I said to him is I said you know he\nsaid I feel like it threw my life away\nand this is the worst thing that's ever\nhappened to me and I said cool\nyeah I mean I get it like you have every\nright to think that way if you want to\nor you could also look at things from a\ncompletely different perspective\nis it cool if I just offer you another\nperspective of what I'm seeing going on\nand he's like yeah for sure and I said\nyou since I've known you you've never\nwanted to do what you do\nnever like you make a couple hundred\ngrand a year\nbut it's been slowly eating at your soul\nI've been watching it happen you make a\ncouple hundred grand a year but you\nfreaking hate what you do and you're\nonly doing it because you've been doing\nit for a while and you're only doing it\nbecause you're trying to uphold this\nlevel of life that you've gotten used to\nand you don't want to quote unquote go\nback down\nand so this can be the worst thing\nthat's ever happened to you and you can\nlook at this one thing and realize maybe\nthis is the worst thing that's ever\nhappened to me or you can look at it as\nthis could be the best thing that's ever\nhappened to me\nand I said to him maybe your\nsubconscious is so powerful and so fed\nup with the life that you've built and\nknowing that you have something else\nthat your soul really wants to follow\nsome purpose that your soul really has\nto follow and wants to follow\nthat it took a match and just burnt that\n to the ground\nhave you ever thought about that\nand he's like no not really I was like\nhere's the way that I see that the\nUniverse usually comes through is it's\nit's the whisper\nthe feather and then the truck\nright I'm sorry it's the it's the the\nfeather screw this up the whisper comes\nin it's just just different spot so it's\nthe feather the brick the truck so the\nfeather the brick the truck the feather\nis like the universe coming over and\nlike tickling your ear and Whispering\nthere's where the whisper comes in\nWhispering into your ear hey you should\nprobably quit your job hey you you\nreally don't like doing this hey you\nshould probably make a change hey you\nhate your boss you should probably do\nsomething different hey and it's like\nthe universal speak to you in a whisper\nit'll tickle you with the feather and\njust lightly kind of push you in another\ndirection it'll try to push you lightly\ntry to push you another direction right\nyes perfect and that's happened many\ntimes has it not and he's like yeah many\ntimes I've been feeling like I should\nleave my job for like 10 years or leave\nthis industry for 10 years and so it's\nbeen whispering to you for a while it's\nbeen you know the feather's been there\nfor a while hasn't it he's like yeah it\nhas and I said then if you don't listen\nlong enough\nthe universe is going to try to be a\nlittle bit more aggressive with you to\nmake a change\nand what happens is it'll hit you with a\nbrick\nnow since I've known you I've seen you\nget fired from multiple jobs because you\ndon't show up the way that you could\nyour performance is not what your\nperformance could be you're not bringing\nyour best self to it the company\neventually sees it a few years down the\nroad and then you get fired that's\nhappened a few times since we've known\neach other\nhasn't and he's like yeah it has I was\nlike that's kind of like the brick\nit's firing the universe is literally\nfiring you because you're not putting\neverything that you can into it that's\nthe brick\nand you didn't listen to it did you he's\nlike no and I was like and then what\nhappened the truck you got hit by a\ntruck a couple days ago when you got\narrested for this stupid thing that you\ndid that luckily only hurts you and\ndidn't hurt anybody else\nwas like you getting hit by a truck\nand I want you to realize that's where\nit's always going to be and so to to\nkind of take a step back and get out of\nthe story to speak to you listening to\nthe podcast\nthere's probably many of you listening\nthat have noticed a feather in your life\nand it's been a whisper of how you\nshould change your life how you should\nbe doing something different how you\nshould be changing in some sort of way\nsome of you have probably been hit by a\nbrick in some sort of way\nright and then some of you have not\nlistened long enough and you've been hit\nby a truck and the way I got this just\nthe way the way I got the Fred the\nfeather the brick the truck was actually\nbelieve it or not from another one of my\nfriends whose dad went to prison and he\nwas talking about how the feather used\nto come in I should change my life I\nshould change my life I shouldn't be\nhanging out in these gangs and doing\nthis then it was the brick came in and\nyou know he got some close calls with\nthe police and then he went to prison\nthat was a truck he got hit it was a\nuniverse saying full reset you're not\npaying attention I've got to talk to you\nin some sort of way I'm going to fully\nreset everything for you\nand so if you're listening to this\nsometimes that could be like in your\nyour health right where you have the\nfeather that comes in you know what I\nshould probably I should probably stop\ndrinking so much alcohol should probably\neat a little bit healthier it's probably\ngo to the gym a little bit more right\nand you have a little bit of a Feather\nset whisper in your ear it's that\nintuitive feeling of I should probably\ndo this I should probably do this\nbut you don't always listen right and\nthen what happens you get smacked by a\nbrick and that brick might be a health\nscare that brick might be something\nhappening to you or someone in your\nfamily has a health scare and it's\nshowing you oh my god well he's very\nsimilar to me he's had this thing happen\nin his life because of his health maybe\nI should pay attention to that that's\nlike getting hit by the brick and then\nif it goes long enough it goes long\nenough when it goes long enough then\nit's the truck it might be a heart\nattack it might be you know something\nworse than that I don't know what it is\nbut it's the feather the brick the truck\nso what I said to him when I was talking\nto my friend I said Hey listen you know\nyeah maybe this is the worst thing ever\nhappened to you and you can you're it is\nyour prerogative to look at the world\nthat way if you want to but I don't look\nat the world that way\nI look at it as everything's happening\nfor me not happening to me and if you\nthink that it's the worst things ever\nhappened to you and you threw your life\naway you're acting as if the world's\nhappening to you I think it's happening\nfor you I think that you subconsciously\nburnt down this life that you had\nbecause you've hated it for years\nso it could be the worst thing ever\nhappened to you or it could be the best\nthing ever happened to you you might go\nto jail for quite a few years maybe\nthat's what your soul needs in order to\ntake a step back and improve yourself\nand the way that I got this and I\nstarted realizing is that when I was\nyounger if you know my story my father\npassed away when I was 15. that was the\nworst thing that ever happened to me\nbut\nit was also the best thing ever happened\nto me\nbecause he was the very first person\nthat I had ever known in my life that\nhad passed away\nand I started started to see the way\nthat he lived his life\nthat I did like in the ways that he\nlived his life that I did not like and I\nstarted to realize oh my God I'm gonna\ndie I'm not gonna worry about all this\ndumb stuff that people always worry\nabout about getting a stupid job and\nworking for a stupid company and doing\nthese things like I want to do something\nI'm passionate I want to do something\nthat feels like I could change the world\nand I remember thinking this like 15\nyears old I was really shy kid the fact\nthat I was thinking I was going to\nchange the world was crazy right and so\nI was thinking this but what happened\nwas you know I realized in that moment\nit was a terrible thing that happened to\nme right but I was not going to die\nwithout making some good out of that bad\nthing and I would not do what I do now\nthere is no way on Earth that I would do\nwhat I do now if my father had not\npassed away because after my father died\nI discovered self-development and what\nhappened was I started working on myself\nand it took years like he died when I\nwas 15 I discovered self-development I\nwas 19. and I realized when I discovered\nself-development that I had a lot of\num\nI had a lot of things that were kind of\nstill stuck things I needed to work\nthrough on my own and because of the\nfact that I couldn't afford a\npsychologist at 19 I was a college\nstudent right I realized I could read\nsome books I could work on myself I\ncould try to\nin a way become my own psychologist to\ntry to help myself and it became\neverything that I have now and I became\npassionate about it simply because of\nwhat I saw happen to my father how it\naffected me how I improved myself from\nit and I realized and I felt obligated\nto teach this to other people\nI didn't know when I was 15 that would\nthat would turn into this but it has so\nnow the worst dance ever happened to me\nhas turned into the best thing that's\never happened to me and hopefully the\nbest thing that's happened to the world\nin my expression of myself in the world\nright so if you feel\nyou know you can feel like you're\nthrowing your life away\nand that is the worst thing ever\nhappened to you or you can decide this\nis me still talking my friend or you can\ndecide that this is going to become the\nbest thing that's ever happened to you\nit doesn't mean it's not gonna be hard\nlike you have a really really hard road\nahead\nbut you can change your perspective of\nwhat you're going through because you're\ngoing to go through it either way you\nmight as well change your perspective\nand actually start to see how I can\nbecome the best thing that's ever\nhappened to you\nso we had some more conversational\nconversations and and he slowly went\nfrom like this very sad depressive state\nto a little bit better to a little bit\nbetter to a little bit better to a\nlittle bit better and he's like I'm\ngoing to whatever happens whether I\ndon't go to jail whether I go to jail\nfor a little bit whether I go to jail\nfor a long time I'm going to figure out\na way to come out on the other end of\nthis better\nthan I was before\nand so I want you to think about that\nwell if you're listening to this podcast\nwhat's the worst thing that's ever\nhappened to you what did you learn from\nit are you still going through it is it\nstill happening right now\nand then what has your mindset been\naround that event have you thought that\nyou're a victim\nare you still bitter about that thing\nthat that person did to you seven years\nago are you still moping around about it\nthat's your prerogative if you want to\nyou still can't you can do whatever the\nhell you want it's your prerogative to\nmope it's your prerogative to be bitter\nit's all up to you\nor can you look at it and realize that\nyeah I kind of burnt everything down and\nI'm gonna build Back From the Ashes\nthe other thing that I said when I was\ntalking about the the his life his\nsubconscious Burning It To The Ground is\nI think that he did it I think that you\nknow I don't think I'm not going to talk\nabout this I think that he\nsubconsciously did what he did because\nhe was tired of it I think that it was\nthe truck coming through I think that it\nwas the universe saying you know what\ndude it's done you're done we're we're\nburning this thing to the ground right\nhe's wanted something different for over\n10 years\nand so it comes back to the feather the\nbrick to the truck he ended up getting\nhit by the truck and so it it could seem\nlike the worst dance ever happened to\nhim or it can seem like a course\ncorrection I know a lot of people have\ngone to prison and come back way better\nthan when they went in maybe that's the\ncourse correction that he needed and so\nwhat I really want you to understand\nfrom the story\nis everything and your life is about\nperspective what is the perspective that\nyou're looking at the lens that you're\nlooking at the world through because you\ncan choose to be the victim hey go for\nit if that's what you want that's what\nmakes you feel better\ngo for it or you can look it through a\ncompleted for lens and say you know what\nthis happened for me I'm going to figure\nout a way to turn this negative thing\nand turn into good I'm going to start\nlistening when I hear the whisper when I\nfeel the feather before I get hit by the\nbrick and definitely before I get hit by\nthe truck because if you feel like\nyou're supposed to go in a different\ndirection you should probably go in a\ndifferent direction\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode go\nahead and subscribe to it and then also\ndo me a favor\njust go ahead and
