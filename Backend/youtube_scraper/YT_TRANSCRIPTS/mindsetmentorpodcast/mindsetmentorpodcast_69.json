    "transcript": "you will lose yourself if you're always\ntrying to please other people but you\nwill lose people when you finally decide\nto choose yourself if somebody who you\nthought you were friends with decides to\nleave your side because you step into\nyour truest version of yourself then the\ntruth is they were never there for you\nin the first place and it's better to\nlose someone now than to have a fake\nfriend forever"
