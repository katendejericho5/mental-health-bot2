    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today I'm going to be diving\ninto why self-help books are not enough\nand how you can unlock your full\npotential simply by just living your\nlife and so you know I want to talk to\nyou about how to quickly improve\nyourself and I'm going to talk to you\nabout how I see a lot of problems in the\npersonal development industry you know\nI've been in this industry now for you\nknow viewing it and then been been a\npart of it for 17 years and the way that\nI look at life is to always be learning\nand everything that happens to you\nwhether it's good whether it's bad\nwhether it's terrible whether it's\nneutral everything that happens to you\nis an opportunity for you to learn\nthe problem is that a lot of people I\nfind don't really see it that way or\nthey don't even know that life is here\nto teach you lessons and there's lessons\nat every corner of your life and one of\nthe biggest misconceptions that I see\nabout personal development is that\npeople think and I thought this for\nyears people think that personal\ndevelopment is deciding to read a book\nfor 10 minutes every single morning\npeople think that personal development\nis meditating for 20 minutes in the\nmorning people think that personal\ndevelopment is going to\ntheir favorite person's conference\npeople think that personal development\nis journaling they think that's\nlistening to a podcast and all of those\nare an aspect of her personal\ndevelopment and all of them are great\nand I think that all of them are needed\nbut they're not the only things to\nimprove yourself people think that you\nknow I gotta get my 30 minutes of\npersonal development in this morning no\nlike you've got to get your 16 hours of\nbeing awake personal development in this\nmorning you know life is your\nopportunity for personal development\npersonal development means that you\npersonally are developing in some sort\nof way how can I look at everything as a\ngift that has been given to me for me to\nbe able to learn and to grow some people\nwill go read a book and then they'll be\nlike man this is great I'm learning how\nto improve myself and then they'll get\ninto a argument with their spouse and\nnot realize that the book was great it\nwas fine it's okay you can read books I\nread books I love reading books\nbut not realize that the argument was\nactually the argument their spouse is\nactually their greatest opportunity for\npersonal development that day\nthink about that for a second how often\nhas the universe gifted you with\nopportunities to learn about yourself to\nlearn about others to learn about\neverything around you but you completely\nmiss it because you get too involved in\nthe minutia of what's going on around\nyou\nyou were in that argument well why was\nthere an argument why was there an\nargument in the first place what can you\nlearn from that argument maybe it was\nsomething that that you know your wife\nor your husband had done over and over\nand over and over and over again and he\ndidn't say anything he didn't say\nanything he didn't say anything and then\nfinally you you put so much stuff you\njust brush it in the rug and brushing\nthe rug eventually you tripped over the\nrug and you just exploded at them\nwhat were you supposed to learn from\nthat maybe the universe is coming to you\nsaying hey you should speak your truth a\nlittle bit more you should be more have\nbetter communication in your\nrelationship with your spouse\nwere you triggered in some sort of way\nwhat was it that triggered you\nwhy was it triggering in you why was it\na trigger\nthe universe is giving you a gift\nwhenever you're triggered it is showing\nyou where you are not free you are stuck\nin some sort of way triggering is a\nmassive opportunity to learn a trigger\nis a place where you're not free and so\nthe universe is showing you that you're\nnot free through somebody else they're\nbringing you your spouse to trigger you\nto show you where you are still stuck\nwhere you still need to improve and all\ntoo often we think of perseverance\nsomething that we do\nby ourselves something that we do when\nwe're reading books when we're in a silo\nwhen we're deciding you know what I'm\ngoing to go ahead and do some journaling\nthis morning and all of those are\nessential they are a big piece of\npersonal element but the biggest\nopportunity for you to grow is by seeing\nyour life as a classroom\nyour life has been and will be a\nperfectly crafted curriculum for you to\nlearn and grow and become the best\nperson she could become they're not\nseparate we're not talking about two\nseparate worlds here it is the same\nworld your life is a classroom you're in\nclass all day long\nare you seeing it that way\nright someone else if you look at the\nfact that you were triggered by\nsomething by your spouse someone else\ncould have had the exact same thing\nhappen to them and not be triggered\nwhich shows you it's not the trigger\nit's you\nwas it your spouse that triggered you\nwhy where did that come from is there\nsomething that they said that reminded\nyou of when you were younger maybe\nsomething that your parents didn't give\nyou that triggered you or maybe\nsomething that happened to you when you\nwere bullied by children and you still\nhaven't let it go you're 38 years old\nand you had this thing that happened to\nyou when you were six and you've been\ncarrying with it for 32 years and that\nthe person's coming to you the universe\nis coming to you through your wife to\ntrigger you to show you where you're\nstill not free from an event that\nhappened to you six years ago and you're\nthinking that personal development is\nreading a book the book is important I\nkeep saying it but what's really\nimportant is mastering this game of life\nseeing everything that happens to you as\nyour perfectly crafted curriculum for\nyour soul to learn to grow to improve\nso you can listen to this podcast and\nget all excited like one of the things I\nhate I hate being called a motivational\nspeaker because I'm not a\nmotivational speaker I'm not trying to\nmotivate you I'm trying to give you tips\nand tricks to improve your life if that\nhappens to be motivating beautiful I\nlove that that's great but my job and\nwhat I feel is to try to help people\nbecome free from themselves to free\nthemselves from their mind right so you\ncan listen to this podcast and you can\nget excited about growing and then 30\nminutes later you know you might listen\nthis podcast and you're on the way to\nTarget\nand you're like this is great me and my\nchildren were listening to you know Rob\ndial\nand you get to Target and you feel all\ngreat you know this is great I love the\nstuff that Rob teaches and then your\nchild has a meltdown in Target they\nthrow a temper tantrum and what happens\nyou get pissed off or something right\nthat's a listen I love that she listens\npodcasts but that is your is a much\nbetter place for you to learn and grow\nand improve can you learn oh my gosh my\nmy child is having a complete meltdown\ncan you learn how to keep calm in the\nmiddle of that storm and allow them to\nprocess emotions which is hard I know I\nget it but can you learn how to keep\ncalm in the middle of that storm to show\nthem that you are a safe space for them\nto you know Express their emotions as\nthey do can you learn how to keep calm\nin the middle of that storm\nwhich is then A Life Lesson to help you\nto get calm in any storm\nthat child melting down and having a\ntantrum tantrum temper tantrum in Target\nwas your opportunity for the day to\nlearn and grow and become better you are\ngoing to the mental gym and you're\nworking on your mental muscles and\ntrying to become better that's your\nopportunity\ndid you miss that opportunity to learn\nthat the Universe gave you\nor did you take that opportunity\nyou know let's say your boyfriend or\nyour girlfriend forgets to call you and\nit triggers you and it triggers you and\nyou're just freaking out why didn't they\ncall me they said they're gonna call me\nthey were supposed to call me I hate\nwhen she doesn't call me I hate when he\ndoesn't call me and then you actually\nstep take a step back and you look it's\nlike you and you're witnessing yourself\nyou're witnessing you stuck in emotions\nyou take a step back you're like hold on\nwhat's going on here why am I so\ntriggered right now\nit's just simply a a phone call is it\nthat big of a deal is life melting down\naround me no\nokay if I take a step back what's going\non oh man you know what's probably\nhappening\nI think I have a fear of Abandonment for\nmy childhood because my mom was this way\nor my dad was this way oh God I'm\nnoticing my trigger thank you Universe\nfor coming through in my girlfriend and\nnot calling me back and not texting me\nso that I can see that I'm still not\nfree from that fear of an abandonment\nissue that started when I was nine years\nold\nthat's your trigger that's your gift\nsure we can blame it on her we can blame\nit on oh you didn't call me back you\n all these things but really what\nit comes down to is you\nthe call doesn't matter your reaction to\nthe call matters that's the thing that\nwe need to figure out and one of the\nthings that I like to do whenever I\nnotice myself being triggered in some\nsort of way\nbe triggered\nand then take a step back and say okay\nwhat's going on here like I'll be fully\nhonest with you on Monday I was uh I was\nlooking on YouTube and I was a few weeks\nago I was interviewed on a podcast by\nsomebody else and I was like I wonder if\nthey put that YouTube video up yet when\nI was looking at the YouTube video and\nthey'd put it up a couple hours before\nand you know there's a bunch of positive\ncomments and it was awesome and then\nthere's one comment from this guy that\nsaid\num\nwhat this guy teaches is dangerous uh\nand he thought it was dangerous because\nI said that people should Journal\nbecause they can act kind of like their\nown psychologist and in his mind he made\na connection of this guy saying nobody\nshould go to to a psychologist what they\nshould do is is literally just work\nthemselves through journal and that's\ndangerous which isn't what I said so\nthere was definitely some jumping in his\nmind and then made another one of like\nI'm gonna make a reaction video to this\nguy and I was like damn this is pretty\nwild\nand then so what happened was I was in\nthe middle of making breakfast tacos I\nwent back to making breakfast tacos and\nabout two minutes later I noticed like a\nflood of stress come into my body\nand I was like this is weird why am I so\nstressed I'm just making breakfast tacos\nlike I had a great morning I woke up I\nmeditated with my wife I uh read for\nlike 30 45 minutes I went and got my\nworkout in I did my shower and I was in\nMiddle making breakfast tacos I was\nhaving a great freaking day\nand then out of nowhere this flood of\nstress comes into my body and I was like\nwhoa whoa\nthis is weird I'm just making breakfast\ntacos why do I feel so stressed right\nnow and so what I did same thing I took\na step back okay what's happening let me\nlet me witness what's happening with Rob\nit's kind of the way that I I view it\nright let me witness what's happening\nwith Rob right now what's happening okay\num what's happening is it looks like he\nis getting stressed out why is he\ngetting stressed out well what is he\nthinking well the only thing I could\nthink about is there must be some sort\nof connection to that comment that he\nread in YouTube this is what I'm doing\nin my head I'm literally taking a step\nback and looking at myself and going why\nis he so full of stress right now\nanxiety why does he feel so anxious\nand I was like damn\nthat must be something for my childhood\nyou know what I did was I did my\nbreathing techniques 60 breasts into the\nnose out through the mouth I put on a\nreally calming song and I started you\nknow just allowing myself to just feel\nthe way I was feeling for a moment\nand then after I calmed down I was like\nwhat is that where where did it come\nfrom why was it there what if I still\nwhat are unresolved issues for my\nchildhood just popped up right there and\nso I started thinking through I started\nfiguring out what was going on and I\nnoticed that it was a trigger that I had\nfrom when I felt like I was bullied as a\nkid and I felt like I was bullied and\nbeing bullied now as a 37 year old on\nYouTube and I was like that's\ninteresting I thought I was past this\nyou know what I guess I'm not that's\nokay there's nothing wrong with it\nbecause normally be like I thought it\nwas passes what the is wrong with\nme why is this triggering me it's just\nsome dumbass on YouTube you know we\ncould think that way or I can just go\nyou know what\nit's still nine-year-old Rob that's just\nwe're still working past these things\nit's okay I got you we're safe there's\nnothing wrong\ntook some deep breaths and I just kind\nof Let It Go and I noticed that it as I\nlet it go and I didn't hold on to it I\nwas able to work through it and I\nnoticed that I was triggered I took a\nstep back I did some breathing I figured\nout why I was triggered and now I can\nstart to work through those processes\nthat was my biggest gift so far this\nweek from the universe to show me Rob\nyou still got work to do and guess what\nI don't ever expect to be perfect and\nnot have work to do it's just now I've\ngot some tools in my tool belt over the\nyears of working on myself to notice\nthese things become aware quicker and\nthen actually you know some tools my\ntool belts to breathe through it to work\nthrough it and to think through it so I\ncan get myself back on track and so I've\ntold the story probably five times this\nweek to different people to different\ngroups of people because I think it's\nimportant for people to hear that is the\nway that I viewed what was going on in\nmy life\nUniverse thank you so much for\ntriggering me from this\nfreaking person on YouTube\nthat is a gift\nI can still think he's an but I\nthink it's a gift as well so I can still\nbe like ah screw that guy but thank you\nfor coming through Universe God whatever\nit is that's out there that's here to\nhelp me improve and to look at that and\ngo ah\nit's okay we're still working on it\nwe're still working on this Rob dial\nguide and so when you start to see this\nyou start to see that all of life is a\nlesson and that's the way that I really\nlike to view my life I have found that\nit is a perfectly crafted curriculum for\nyou to evolve into the highest version\nof yourself love loss sadness happiness\nanger frustration rage joy every single\nthing that happens to us is an\nopportunity for us to learn and to grow\nand anytime we miss those lessons we\nmiss our opportunity to grow the highest\nversion of you is not found in a book\nyou can learn and that's great but the\nhighest version of you is not found in\nthose books the highest version of you\nis found on the other side of a\nbreakdown\nnotice the feeling breathe into the\nfeeling notice what's going on do not\nresist it don't shame yourself don't\nguilt yourself don't be pissed off that\nyou're not quote unquote there yet\nwherever the there is don't resist\nit and ask yourself what am I feeling\noh man I'm feeling really a lot of\nstress I'm feeling a lot of anxiousness\nI'm feeling out of sadness whatever is\nyour feeling\nokay that's what I'm feeling why am I\nfeeling this way you start to work\nthrough it and what you realize is you\nstart to get a little bit better you get\na little bit better and you get a little\nbit better\nand you realize that all of this is a\ngift all of those things the good in\nlife the bad in life the neutral things\nin life all of them are a gift don't\nresist them allow them to come through\nwork through them your resistance\ndoesn't help you\nworking through it helps you\nin working through it allows you to be\nable to be able to show up as a better\nperson for the people that you love for\nthe people that are around you you know\nI I viewed it as I was going through\nthis whole thing on Monday I've viewed\nit as this is going to be a really good\nlesson one day like this is going to be\na really good podcast that I could\ncreate one day and that was just me\nexplaining it real quick but as I start\nto learn more about what happened to me\nand start to think about more happen to\nme I can turn this into a podcast\nepisode holy thank you Universe for\nallowing me to be triggered by this guy\nso that I can eventually learn and grow\nfrom it get another tool in my tool belt\nand be able to teach us in a podcast\nepisode and help hopefully help hundreds\nof thousands of people\nthat's the way that we have to view our\nlife whether you have a podcast going on\nto a hundred thousand thousands hundreds\nof thousands of people or not or you\njust surround yourself with people who\nare important to you you growing and\nlearning with every one of the things\nthat trigger you in your life is one of\nthe most important things that you could\ndo your life is a classroom are you\npulling the lessons out of it that you\nneed so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this
