    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to reprogram your mind for the\nsuccess that you want using psychology\nand science as well now you've\nyou've understood you are here because\nyou understand that if you want your\nlife to be different you have to change\nand the key to change in achieving the\nsuccess that you want in any area of\nyour life comes down to the ability to\nchange your mind to reprogram your mind\nto create the life that you want your\nthoughts your habits and your beliefs\nare the driving forces behind all of\nyour actions\nlet me say that again your thoughts your\nhabits and your beliefs are the driving\nforces behind your actions which in turn\nis going to determine your life your\noutcomes your success or lack of success\nso by understanding the psychology\nbehind this and the science behind the\nmental reprogramming what we can do is\nwe can kind of take charge of our own\nlives so that our future doesn't look\nlike our past does because you're not\nhere because you want the same future\nthat you've had in the past you don't\nwant them to be identical you're here\nbecause you want them to be different\nand if things are going to be different\nyou have to be different and the biggest\npiece of being different is\nreprogramming your mind it sounds kind\nof weird and out there to say reprogram\nas if you're a computer but in turn as\nwe start to go through this you'll\nactually really see the ways to\nreprogram yourself so we're going to\nreally explore how to reprogram your\nmind for Success using really proven\npsychological techniques in science\nbecause I am a I'm a very skeptical\nperson and I know a lot of you listening\nare skeptical as well that's probably\nwhat you like about listening to the\nshow that's probably why you listen to\nme because we're probably both Skeptics\nin a little ways so I'm going to show\nyou through science and psychology\nexactly how to reprogram and change your\nmind change the structure of your brain\nby doing these things so let's dive into\nit before we talk about how to change\nthe mind you have to really understand\nthe mind okay before we talk about how\nto reprogram what is this thing we're\ntrying to reprogram we got to understand\nhow the mind works itself and so the\nmind really consists of two parts right\nthere's the conscious mind and there is\nthe subconscious mind now other people\nwould say there's also the super\nconscious which is like your connection\nto God or Source or all that stuff we're\nnot going to talk about the super\nconscious which is could be your higher\nself we're going to talk about the\nconscious mind we're going to talk about\nthe subconscious mind right the\nconscious mind is responsible for our\nday-to-day thoughts and decisions and\nactions while the subconscious mind\nstores memories it stores your habits it\nstores your beliefs and will actually\nbring up automatic thoughts without you\neven having to think about it so let's\ndive into them both real quick so you\ncan understand them right so we have the\nconscious mind the conscious mind is\nknown as your quote-unquote thinking\nmind right so as you're listening to me\nas a thought is in your head and you're\nlike okay what is conscious subconscious\nthat right there is your conscious mind\ncoming up and speaking it's where we\nprocess most of our information and we\nmake decisions from and it accounts for\nroughly five percent of our cognitive\nactivities\nthat's really interesting isn't it\nbecause you might be saying hold on\nhow's it only responsible for five\npercent like I know all of my thoughts I\nknow all the things that I'm really\nfocusing on throughout the day that I'm\nthinking throughout the day but this is\nwhy we often struggle when we're\nattempting to change our habits is\nbecause we think we can just change our\nconscious mind which is five percent of\nthe stuff that we think about but we're\nnot actually changing our subconscious\nmind I know there's been times before\nwhere you probably sat down\nyou decided to set some goals you wrote\nyour goals down you're like this is\nexciting I'm super excited about it and\nthat's your conscious mind that's\nexcited about it and then there's a part\nof you that's in the background that's\nlike yeah but that's not possible or\nthat's going to be hard or we can't do\nthat or you're going to have to change a\nlot and then it's going to give you\nfears and limiting beliefs and it's not\ngoing to allow you to be able to change\nand so the the way I I remember reading\nthis in a book back in 2009 and they\nwere saying the way to think of your\nconscious and your subconscious mind\nvisibly to understand the power of both\nof them is if you were to be able to\nhold your your conscious mind it's like\nthe size of a golf ball right and so you\nhave a golf ball in one hand and in the\nother hand you have your subconscious\nmind which is the size of a basketball\nnow which one do you think is more\npowerful\nit's going to be the one that's larger\nright and so we have to realize that our\nconscious mind our thinking of oh man I\nneed to go to the bathroom oh I need to\ncall back Sally oh I need to do this\nit's just basically your conscious mind\nour conscious mind can only handle so\nmuch at once so if you want real lasting\nchange which you got to dive into\nis a subconscious mind that's 95 because\non the subconscious mind on the other\nhand it's responsible for approximately\n95 percent of our mental activities and\nit operates automatically storing our\nbeliefs storing our habits storing our\nmemories and most importantly it's\nresponsible for regulating our emotions\nand carrying out the majority of our\ndaily tasks and since our subconscious\nmind has such a significant impact on\nour lives it's really crucial to focus\non reprogramming that part of our brain\nin order to get lasting change which is\nwhat I'm going to give you techniques\nfor today is how to reprogram the\nsubconscious mind because your conscious\nmind wants to do better your conscious\nmind wants a different life your\nconscious mind wants to be successful\nwants to be a great parent wants to go\nmake a million dollars but why the\naren't we doing it oh because you're\nit's like David and Goliath here right\nand so it's like this huge Goliath is\nlike you gotta change me before anything\nelse and so really it's so crucial to\nfocus on reprogramming the subconscious\nso to understand it there's millions of\nbits of information of processing that\nhappens in your brain every single\nsecond and that is below your conscious\nthought below conscious is subconscious\nsubconscious right so that's below your\nconscious thoughts so you're not\nnecessarily thinking about them all the\ntime it's your brain reacting to certain\nthings immediately it's your brain\nreacting to certain situations\nimmediately and sometimes\nyou know you've done this before I've\ndone this many times sometimes your\nbrain many times your brain will react\nto a person or it will react to a\nlocation or it'll reacts to even like a\nsmell and you don't even notice it until\nafter it happens so you might be\nyou know in a certain location you might\nbe walking and it might be kind of\ngetting dark and you hear a sound and\nthe sound triggers a part of you and\nyour brain to think danger in your body\nimmediately goes to fight or flight that\nwasn't a conscious thought of oh my gosh\nthere might be danger behind me it's\nlike an immediate thing that comes in\nnow if that can happen just from the\nthought of hearing a sound is it\npossible that it's happening all day\nlong for many different things that can\ntrigger us for good or trigger us for\nbad absolutely 100 sometimes you can\nmeet somebody\nthat you're just like I I don't I don't\nknow I just don't connect to this person\ndoesn't they don't feel right it doesn't\nseem right and it might not be their\nfault but it could be that they remind\nyou of someone else in your subconscious\nis automatically reacting to them\nbecause it remembers what happened last\ntime that you're around the other person\nthat it reminds you of so your\nsubconscious reacts your conscious mind\nusually catches up later on down the\nroad and so like for instance you might\nbe like well like what does that mean\nit's it's processing millions of bits of\ninformation per second right so like I'm\ngoing to say hey focus on your right\nthumb right now\nnow you can focus on your right thumb\nbut were you focusing on your right\nthumb before\nno you probably weren't does that mean\nthat there was no input coming from your\nright thumb before no there was\ndefinitely input coming from the right\nthumb thumb it's just that your\nsubconscious was paying attention to it\nyour conscious mind was paying attention\nto you know me and what I'm saying or I\nwas paying attention to the road because\nyou're driving or to pay attention to\nyou picking up the weights because\nyou're at the gym right now and so your\nbrain was processing the information\ncoming from your right thumb but it was\nfiltering it out because you were\nthinking of something else and so really\nwhat it comes down to is there's you\nknow if I say hey\nfocus on your butt that's in the chair\nright now now you're feeling your focus\non the the clothes that are on your skin\nand the way that it feels focus on the\nway that the room feels and the the air\nconditioning that's that's circling\naround or focus on the sun that's on\nyour skin if you're outside right your\nbrain's constantly processing all this\nstuff but really what it comes down to\nis are you paying attention to it\nusually we're not and so what we have to\nstart diving into is being able to\nchange our brain to filter out the\nthings we want it to filter out and not\npay attention to those things things we\nmight be fearful of are limiting beliefs\nand filter in the things that we do\nwanted to pay attention to and so that\ncomes down to something called\nneuroplasticity if you've been listening\nto this podcast for years you've heard\nme talk about neuroplasticity many times\nif you've this is your first episode\nneuroplasticity is simple in in\ndescribing what it is neuroscience has\nproven that our brains are not hardwired\nthey have the ability to change and\nadapt to circumstances and that's known\nas neuroplasticity like your brain is\nlike plastic it can be molded it means\nbasically in the simplest way of saying\nit is that our brains can form new\nconnections and reorganize existing ones\nand that allows us to learn new skills\nto change our habits even recover from\nbrain injuries and if we can change our\nbrains through neuroplasticity through\nthe reprogramming I'm going to talk to\nyou about we can then re can can we if\nwe can change our brains then can we\nrewire our brains for Success we sure\ncan and we just need to be very clear on\nwhat thoughts behaviors habits need to\nchange in order for us to change\nourselves and eventually change our\nlives and so if you just think that\nthings are magically going to change\nbecause you know about the subconscious\nand the conscious mind and now you know\nabout neuroplasticity nothing is going\nto change right we need to be very clear\non what thoughts what behaviors what\nhabits all of that stuff that need to\nchange in order for us to change\nourselves more than anything else and\nthen eventually change our lives after\nthat so by being consistent because\nrepetition is another skill by being\npersistent and consistent with what I'm\nabout to teach you and practicing these\npatterns over and over and over again\nyour brain will eventually start to\nadapt them as the new Norm okay so let's\ntalk about a couple different techniques\nfor reprogramming your mind so the first\none is something called cognitive\nrestructuring okay cognitive\nrestructuring is a technique that is\nused in cognitive behavioral therapy and\nwhat it involves is identifying\nand replacing and replacing the\nirrational or negative thought with the\nthought that you want\nokay so the same way that your your your\nsubconscious mind will immediately react\nand then your conscious mind will catch\nup to it you have to identify the\nthoughts that come up that maybe your\nsubconscious threw in there and as your\nconscious mind catches up to it and says\noh I don't really like that thought then\nyou replace it with the thought that you\nwant and so the the process really helps\npeople\nrecognize the impact that your thoughts\nand the thought patterns that you have\nin how they affect your emotions and how\nthey affect your behavior and really\nwhat it comes down to is giving you the\ntools necessary to change and to\nchallenge the patterns that you might\nhave that you want to get rid of and\nthere's been a bunch of studies that\nhave proven how cognitive restructuring\nactually works but really what they've\ndone is they've demonstrated the\neffectiveness of cognitive restructuring\nin treating a variety of psychological\ndisorders so they've actually used\ncognitive if we can use this to use it\non depression and anxiety and\nobsessive-compulsive disorder can we\nchange it based off of our negative\nthoughts yeah we can use it to change\nour negative thoughts and so if it's\nbeen used to treat depression if it's\nbeen used to treat anxiety if it's been\nused to treat OCD it can also be used to\nchange your negative belief patterns or\nyour fears into something completely\ndifferent and so by by practicing the\ncognitive restructuring you can\nreprogram your mind to think more\npositively or to think that what it is\nthat you want you are actually going to\nget versus being such a cynic and not\nbelieving that you can do whatever it is\nthat you want or not being so negative\nyourself or not speaking so down to\nyourself and when you start to think\nmore positive you start to change the\nthoughts that you need you get rid of\nthe thoughts that you were thinking you\nstart replacing them of the thoughts\nthat you want you get a greater sense of\nself-belief and in turn success can come\nfrom that and so the thing I always say\nis you can't control your first stop but\nyou can always troll your second thought\nright you know your first thought\nusually just pops in from your\nsubconscious and your body reacts to it\nand then your brain you know your\nconscious mind kind of catches up to it\nand so your second thought your first\nthought usually comes from the\nsubconscious your second thought\nrequires conscious decision making from\nyou I noticed that I just said this to\nmyself I noticed that I said this now I\nneed to change it something that I want\nso like a good example would be like\nlet's say that you're wanting to to grow\na business and the first thing that\nyou're thinking to yourself maybe you\njust started your business and you're\ndoing decently well and starting to go\nkind of well but it's starting to feel\nuncomfortable because you're not used to\ndoing so well then you're like man I\nwant to grow to\nthis number per month and you're like\nyeah but it's gonna be real hard because\nI everything up right you start to\nfeel down on yourself usually that's\nlike a subconscious thought from\nchildhood being down in yourself in some\nsort of way and what you do is you think\nto yourself I screw everything up okay\nokay so that that thought just popped\ninto my head that's really that's really\ninteresting automatic thought and you\ntake yourself out of your head and you\nlook at it as if like you are another\nperson looking at your thought and you\nthink to yourself is that thought going\nto support me in growing my business to\na million dollars a month\num nope probably not if I'm thinking to\nmyself I screw everything up that's not\ngoing to support me in getting to a\nmillion dollars a month no it's not\ngoing to so what I want to do is I want\nto replace that thought with three\npieces of data that show to me that I am\nnot a failure so if I'm thinking to\nmyself I'm a failure I screw everything\nup and that's the automatic thing that\ncomes out of my subconscious I've now\nbecome aware of it now what I want to do\nis I want to bring three pieces of data\nnot like hey but don't worry Rob you're\nnot a failure you're awesome right\nbecause then usually BS meter goes off\nand we don't pay attention to it so\nreplace it with three pieces of data\nthat show that you're not a failure you\nknow oh what happened okay I graduated\none of the top people in my high school\nokay that shows I'm not a failure you\nknow I set a goal a couple years ago to\nlose 20 pounds and I did it\num I'm an incredible father okay right\nthere those are three pieces of data\nthat show that I am not a up\naccording to that go against and I'm\nrestructuring it goes against the\nautomatic thought and I'm proving my\nautomatic thought false that's what\ncognitive restructuring looks like and\nso you identify your bad habits and when\nthey come up you replace them you know\nif you want a beautiful garden\nand you're looking at the Garden and\nweeds are always going to come up in any\nGarden at some point in time you have to\npull out the weeds and plant the seeds\nthat you want and really that's what it\ncomes down to pull the weeds and plant\nthe seeds pull the weeds and plant the\nseeds and this is a constant thing\nyou're going to have to be doing for a\nreally long time so that's the first\nthing the second thing you want to do is\nvisualization let's be real\nvisualization seems corny you know you\nclose your eyes and think about what it\nwould feel like to achieve and to get\nyour goals and it's like okay hippie\nwhatever dude but this stuff actually\nreally works and so visualizations are\nreally powerful tool they could be used\nto reprogram your subconscious mind\nbecause when you're closing your eyes\nespecially if you do it early in the\nmorning when your subconscious mind is\nstill kind of on a lot from you know\nit's usually gestures your subconscious\nmind when you're asleep if you do it\nreally early in the morning like within\n15 minutes of waking up it can be really\npowerful tool used to reprogram your\nsubconscious mind and once again that's\n95 of your thoughts and feelings so what\nit involves is creating mental images of\ndesired outcomes the goals the\nsituations what you want your life to\nlook like but the important part of\nvisualization is you first have to know\nwhat it is that you want so that\ntherefore you can go and visualize it so\nthe example that I was given is my\nfavorite example how I use visualization\nis back in 2017 my number one goal for\n2017 was to move to Italy with my\ngirlfriend at the time who's now my wife\nand moved to Italy and be there for six\nmonths and the goal was I wrote it\neverywhere I put on my my mirror I put\nit on the back of my my phone background\nand put on my computer background was to\nmove to Italy by July 1st 2017. and I\nwould wake up every single morning then\nI would visualize what it would be like\nto be walking the streets of Rome to be\nable to walk and go get a morning coffee\nand to to smell the coffee and to sit in\nthe sun in you know a neighborhood\nthat's in Rome called trust Avery and\nwhat it would look like and what it\nwould feel like and I tried to bring all\nof my senses in and I visualized it\nevery morning every morning every\nmorning every morning every morning and\nI went from massive doubt to like I\ndon't think I'm gonna be able to make\nthis happen to literally leaving and\ngetting there by June 1st which was a\nmonth earlier than we planned because I\nwas so excited and I worked so hard\nbecause I woke up every morning attached\nto my goal got myself excited about my\ngoal and then it made me work harder\ntowards my goal every single day\nand so can you visualize the house that\nyou want in the beach you know traveling\nto Rome with your children and touring\nthe Coliseum and what that will look\nlike and you know by visualizing\nourselves achieving achieving our goals\nwhat we're doing is kind of brainwashing\nourselves to actually believe that\nsuccess is possible which in turn\nincreases your motivation and your\ncommitment to the goals that you have\nbecause all too often we just simply\ndon't believe that we can do it like we\nwant to but we don't fully believe we\ncan do it and so you're kind of\nbrainwashing yourself\nto believing that it's possible in\ngetting you excited to do it and there's\nbeen tons of studies that have shown\nthat this works there was a study that\nwas done in the Journal of Applied\nsports psychology that found that\nathletes specifically golfers who\npractice visualization techniques\nexperience significant improvements in\nthe performance and so what they did was\nthey had them before they would go out\nand do a round of golf as a\npre-performance routine they had them\nsit down and visualize for 15 to 20\nminutes that they would make every\nsingle Putt and what it would feel like\nto make put the first putt\non you know t-box one and then you see\nme on on the green one two three four\nfive and actually visualize it\nand what's crazy about it is they had\nthem visualize making the Putt and all\nof them who visualized making the putts\nhad the greatest Improvement in their\nputting\nthat's kind of weird how that happens\nhuh so that's the next one and then last\nwe're going to talk about is\naffirmations affirmations also seem\ncorny and woo-wooy but affirmations are\njust basically positive statements that\nyou're going to repeat to yourself over\nand over and over again that help you\nreshape your subconscious beliefs about\nyourself I always recommend that you\nhave you know one or two very specific\naffirmations about yourself and what it\nis that you're creating in your life and\nwhat you do is you you have it stack\nthem you brush your teeth in the morning\nyou brush your teeth in the evening as\nsoon as you get done brushing your teeth\nimmediately do your affirmations and do\nthem 10 15 20 30 times and there's a ton\nof of research that show that\naffirmations what they lead to is\nimprovements in self-esteem they reduce\nstress and your overall well-being as\nwell so this was a you know they found\nthis in many different studies and\njournals that they've had but the\nJournal of psychological science\nactually found out that people who\nengaged in self-affirmation activities\nactually increased activity in the\nregions of the brain that are associated\nwith with self-referential processing\nwhat the hell does that mean I know I\nhad to Google as well\nself-referential processing means\nthinking of yourself versus thinking of\nthe outside world so they had increased\nblood flow to the parts of the brain\nwhich make you think of yourself and the\nway that you evaluate yourself in the\nworld which made it easier to start\nchanging their brain to be positive even\nthe way they thought about themselves\nso research have shown over and over\nagain that affirmations can have a\nreally really big impact on your mental\nstate but also contribute to a more\npositive outlook in your life\nso that's how you brainwash yourself to\nbe more positive so it's real simple if\nyou think about it like essentially\ncognitive restructuring visualization\nand affirmations are the way for you to\nbrainwash yourself not me I'm not\nbrainwashing you the news isn't\nbrainwashing your mom your dad the\noutside world is not brainwashing you\nbecause you were brainwashed coming up\nwe all have been brainwashed by\neverything that's ever happened to us\nbut now you get to take control you need\nto step into the driver's seat and take\ncontrol of your own brainwashing and\nthat's what you can do and that's how\nyou reprogram your mind to be successful\nby using cognitive restructuring by\nusing visualization and by using\naffirmation so that's all I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please go ahead and share it on\nthe Instagram stories and tag me in it\nRob dial
