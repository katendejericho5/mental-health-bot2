    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be teaching you why you should stop\ntrying to fix yourself as if you're\nsomething that is broken and why you\nshould try to start integrating all of\nthe whole of what you are the good the\nbad everything let's go ahead and dive\nin I love self-development it is more\nthan half of my life I've been into it\nand I've been teaching it to other\npeople but I realized at about 36 years\nold there was a really big problem with\nself-development\nin the way that I looked at it but also\nthe way that most people ended up\nlooking at it I looked at myself for\nyears as an unfinished project and I\nlooked at myself kind of like a mechanic\nthat looks at a car and wants to fix the\ncar so that that car can run again like\nthis thing is broken and that thing is\nbroken and so therefore the car itself\nis broken and I need to fix that so that\nI can get myself running again and\nthat's the way that I looked at myself I\ngot into self-improvement CU I wanted to\nfix parts of me that I hated that I\nwanted to change that I wanted to get\nrid of that I did not enjoy and so I\ncreated unconsciously a battle Within\nMyself it was hey my conscious self Rob\ndoes not like this part of myself does\nnot like the way that I am here and I\nwill not be happy or I will not be\nnormal or I will not feel good about\nmyself or things will not be the way\nthat I want them to be until I fix X Y\nand Z and so I created a battle Within\nMyself it was all of these little\nconflicts Within Myself there was always\nfor years 17 years my first 17 years of\npersonal development there was always\nsomething wrong with me I hate that I'm\nlazy I hate that I'm judgmental I hate\nthat I'm selfish I hate that I hate that\nI hate this I hate that and I have to\nchange all of them and so I had a uh\nsomebody ask me a question in mindset\nMentor plus uh which is you know you've\nheard me talk about on the podcast many\ntimes it's just a a community that I run\nuh to help you go deeper than just the\npodcast if you want to learn more about\nit you can go to mindset mentor.com and\nlearn about it but a question was asked\nto me about how do I fix\nmyself and I told them this I was like\nyou don't fix\nyourself the problem with personal\ndevelopment is that we see what we want\nto change and then we think that there's\nsomething wrong with us or that we're\nnot good enough until we change them so\nit's like if there's Baseline you know\nthis is why they say you know ignorance\nis bliss if there's Baseline well then\nbefore I found personal development I\nwas at Baseline of normal and then when\nI found personal development I started\nreading about myself I started learning\nthings and I went o this is wrong oh\nthis is wrong oh I didn't realize this\nis wrong I didn't realize this is wrong\nand it made me feel less than normal it\nmade me feel below the standard line\nthat everyone else was on and I was like\nwell I've got to fix these things so I\ncan at least get back to Baseline and\nonce I fixed these things then I will be\nnormal but the problem with that is that\nit makes a lot of people out there feel\nless than and so if you're out there and\nyou're new into personal development if\nthis is your first year if this is your\nfirst five years your first 10 years I'm\ngoing to really try to help you out by\nunderstanding the parts of you that\nexist inside of you why they're there\nand how to basically use them and\nintegrate them because what's really\ninteresting is I found over years and\nyears and years the more that I battled\ndifferent parts of myself that I wanted\nto change the stronger that they got it\nwas almost like some weird way that they\nwere fighting\nme and you know I just had to accept one\nday you know what Rob is just a flawed\nindividual so is every other person\nperson and you're getting better and\nyou're working on yourself and things\nare changing and sometimes you know\nwhat sometimes I'm a little bit shitty\nand it's okay I'm I'm working on myself\nand maybe I'll be less shitty in a year\nor five years or 10 years sometimes I'm\njust a little bit\njudgmental sometimes I get a little bit\ntoo worked up sometimes I'm a little bit\nselfish you know and um in the way that\nthis kind of clicked on for me and it\nfully started to make sense to me and\nI'll never forget this moment and I've\nI've talked about this before in the\npodcast but I was writing my book level\nup a few years ago and I was writing the\nbook and I was sitting at this desk that\nI'm currently at right now and I was\nspending hours and hours and hours\nediting every single sentence to try to\nmake them quote unquote perfect and it\nwas like I was it was painstakingly so\nmuch time I was putting into this right\nI was writing the book and I was editing\nand editing and editing and editing I\ntook a step back and I started talking\nto myself I was the only one here so I\nwas able to talk to myself and sometimes\nI talk to myself out loud just so I can\nI can say it my mouth moves I can hear\nit I'm kind of more present than just\nthinking it and I was editing and I was\ngoing so hardcore into editing and I was\nstarting to stress myself out a little\nbit and I said hey why are you doing\nthis why are you why are you writing\nthis book why are you putting so much\ntime into editing this book and I was\nlike I'm putting so much time into\nediting this book because I'm trying to\nmake the best book that I possibly can\nand so that's why I keep editing over\nand over again I was like okay why is\nthat why why do you want to make the\nbest book that you possibly can well I\nwant people who have never heard of me\nthey don't follow me on Instagram they\ndon't follow me on Tik Tok they don't\nlisten to the mindset Mentor podcast I\nwant someone to be able to walk through\na bookstore into Barnes & Noble and to\nsee a book right there on the Shelf\nlevel up and they pick it up they're\nlike this is interesting let me read it\nand they pick it up and they're like\nthis sounds interesting I'm going to buy\nit and they go and they buy it and they\nread the entire thing from from start to\nfinish and the book changes their\nlife that's the reason why I'm putting\nso much time into that and I was like is\nthat true yes and then I really like to\nchallenge myself in my head that's kind\nof why I I think I can do what I do and\nand speak to so many different types of\npeople then I tried to play Devil's\nAdvocate and I was like all right sure\nRob yeah you do want to make the best\nbook that you possibly can but you also\nwant to be your New York Times best\nseller you want to be like hey look at\nme I'm a New York Times bestseller and\nyou also want to make such a great book\nthat they have you on some morning shows\nand they're like this morning show you\nknow they Good Morning America they're\nlike this book level up is the best book\nI've ever read in my entire life and I'm\nlike yay me I did it you know for all\nthe egoic sense I wrote the best book\never um and and if it's a really great\nbook I'll make money off of it forever\nif it's a huge book so it's like set it\nand forget\nit hey real quick I want to introduce\nyou to something called mindset Mentor\nplus if

make the\nbest book from a selfish place yes I do\nokay can I use that side of my\nego that wants to create the best book\nfor selfish reasons can I use that to\nalso create a better book that will help\nmore people and it was like yes and then\nso I thought to myself okay so hold\non that part of me that wants to be\nselfish that wants to be egoic that\nwants to say look at me I'm so awesome\nthat makes money off of it that's a New\nYork Times bestseller all that stuff\nit's not necessarily bad because I can\nuse it to make a better book so it\nshouldn't be a part of me that I want to\nkill it should be a part of me that I'm\naware of that I can use when I need to I\nit doesn't run the entire show if it's\nstarting to run the entire show then\nit's a problem it's a part of me that I\ncan use it is a tool for my tool belt so\nit's not a part of me to hate you know\nif I have a need to screw something in\nscrewdriver is going to be the best tool\nfor that if I need to hammer something\ninto a nail into the wall the hammer is\ngoing to be the best for that and I want\nyou to understand this and and this is\nwhat I said on the mindset Mentor plus\nand I said it and I was like whoa I've\nnever said this before and that could be\none of the best things that I've ever\nsaid and uh I want I wrote it down word\nfor word I watched the zoom and I went\nback and on the mindset Mentor plus Q&A\nsession I said your life and your\nrelationship to yourself will completely\nchange when you stop trying to change\nthe parts of yourself that you think\nthat you hate and you start integrating\nthem into the whole that is\nyou and this has really been my journey\nfor the past few\nyears I for years wanted to change\nmyself and fix myself because I thought\nthat parts of me were broken but in\nreality my relationship with myself my\nrelationship with my life with\neverything around me has changed\ndrastically since I switched this to\ninstead of changing these parts of me I\nwant to integrate these parts into the\nwhole that is Rob and so once again your\nlife and your relationship to yourself\nwill completely change when you stop\ntrying to change the parts of you that\nyou think that you hate and you start\nintegrating them into the whole that is\nyou the thing that's holding you back\nfrom\nself-love from loving yourself fully\nfrom loving yourself maybe even\nunconditionally is that there's parts of\nyourself that you don't accept and you\nthink that there's something wrong with\nyou and you think that that you're\nbroken and you think that you need to\nfix them when in reality the path of\nself-development is not about fixing\nanything it's about accepting\neverything now I understand you will\nnever stop being I want you to\nunderstand this like really wholly you\nwill never stop being judgmental you'll\nnever stop being emotional you'll never\nstop being selfish you'll never stop\nbeing fill in the blank but you will\nlearn if you have a focus you will learn\nhow and when to use them versus try to\nget rid of them like if you think about\nit if I say being judgmental to people\nand judging people outwardly is that a\nbad thing can it be viewed bad yes\nhaving\njudgment is that always bad no judgment\ncan be very important if you're in\nbusiness if you have your own business\nif you work in a business having\njudgment in business and being able to\njudge what's going on Judge different\npeople and in the way that they're\nshowing up if you trust them if you\ndon't trust them judgment is really\nimportant so it's not something that\nyou're trying to get rid of it's\nsomething that you just want to be able\nlike a tool in your tool belt to use\nwhen it's necessary you don't want just\nrun the whole show you want to be able\nto be the one that's in charge of\nit judgment's also very important if\nyou're in relationships if you have been\nin a relationship in the past and you've\nbeen cheated on or heartbroken or\nwhatever it might be and there's red\nflags well don't you want to have at\nleast some judgment to start to see is\nthis person right for me are they not\nright for me are they showing up the the\nway they are they doing what they say\nthey're going to do or are they just\ntalking so judgment's really important\nin many aspects of your life it's really\nimportant in business it's really\nimportant in\nrelationships selfishness is important\nat time at times you can use them you\ncan use selfishness like for people out\nthere that are listen to me that are\npeople\nPleasers people Pleasers need to be more\nselfish because they've given so much of\nthemselves so it's like I need to\nactually be more selfish and set\nstronger boundaries so if you're a\npeople pleaser selfishness is actually\nsomething that you need to get better at\nif you're building a business you need\nto maybe if you're just started your\nbusiness this month you might need to be\nselfish with your time for the next year\nto get it up and running so you might\nneed to disappear for a little bit you\ngot to be selfish with your time there\nit's a benefit you know if you're trying\nto improve your relationship with your\nkids or you're trying to work and be the\nbest possible parent that you can be\nsometimes you need to be selfish with\nyour time so you could spend more times\nwith your kids so that you can help them\ngrow into the best person and the best\nadult and the best human that they could\npossibly be fors and the rest of the\nworld and so you can look at this and\nyou can start to realize and this was\nlike I hope that it's as eye opening as\nfor you as it was for me you can start\nto realize oh my god I've been fighting\nmyself it's almost like there's a\nthere's a an angel on one shoulder\nthere's a devil on another shoulder and\nthey're just battling all the time\ninstead of battling it's looking at them\nand saying you know what like FYI\neverything like judgment and emotions\nand being emotional and being selfish\nand being angry whatever it might be all\nof those are learned defense\nmechanisms they all had value and\nprotected you at some point in time in\nyour past in your childhood in your\nadolescence years you don't really need\nto even know how they protected you how\nthey became defense mechanisms that's\nnot really relevant what's relevant is\nyou can look at them and say yeah I\ndeveloped them for a reason I don't know\nwhat that reason is but there was some\nbenefit to it and it's not about being\nselfish all of the time it's not about\nbeing judgmental all of the time it's\nnot about my ego running the show it's\nabout understanding that I'm going to\nbring these parts of me up and let them\nspeak at different times and I'm going\nto pull them off the stage at different\npoints in time and then I'm going to put\nthis one on stage and I'm going to take\nthis one off stage I'm going to put this\none on stage and take this one off stage\nit's not about getting rid of parts of\nyou it's about integrating them and\nusing them when they're needed turning\nthem up when they're needed turning them\ndown whenever they're not needed in and\nin relationship to to the world and in\nrelationship to yourself I really want\nyou to understand this is this is super\nsuper important there is nothing that\nyou can do to make you more or less than\nwhat you already are I've shared this in\nthe podcast before but I used to listen\nto a meditation from a guy named Muji m\no oji and he used to say in the\nmeditation you know he was talking about\nhaving things and and getting success\nand working on your way to life and he\nsaid he would say this phrase that says\nyou have no pockets you have no\nStorehouse and what he means by that is\nyour physical body your emotional body\neverything you came in this world naked\nyou'll leave this world naked there is\nnothing that you can do\nachieve um nothing that you could buy\nthat will make you more or less than\nwhat you already are and so the game of\nlife is not about getting more and\nachieving more The Game of Life is\nactually about accepting more and the\nmore that you can accept yourself the\nmore that you can start to actually love\nyourself because the key to self-love is\nself-acceptance and so it's not about\ngetting rid of parts of you it's about\naccepting parts of you it's about\nintegrating them into the whole that is\nyou I'm going to leave you with the same\nthing that I that I said that I I really\nwant you to ingrain into yourself your\nlife and your relationship to yourself\nwill completely change when you stop\ntrying to change the parts of yourself\nthat you think that you hate and you\nstart integrating them and accepting\nthem into the hole that is you so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories tag me and at\nRob dial Junior r o d i
