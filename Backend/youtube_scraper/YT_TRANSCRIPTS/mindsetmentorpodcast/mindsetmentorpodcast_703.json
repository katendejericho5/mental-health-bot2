    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be giving\nyou five keys to stop procrastinating if\nyou are a lazy person or if you like\nfeel like you have a lot to do and you\nreally want to create an amazing life\nand you have all these goals and\naspirations but you find yourself\nprocrastinating a little bit too much\nthis episode is specifically designed\nfor you so let's just jump straight into\nit so the first thing I want you to do\nnumber one stop lying to yourself that's\nthe first thing I want you to do I want\nyou to admit your laziness now\nit's kind of like a 12-step program\nright the first thing you need to do is\njust actually acknowledge the laziness\nthat is there stop lying to yourself\njust admit it yeah I've you know what\nI've been really lazy over the past six\nmonths and I really have been slacking\non my business and growing my business I\nneed to get it together just admit your\nlaziness first put it on the table and\nonce you can admit it then we can\nactually start to work through it but\nyou're going to keep lying to yourself\nand telling yourself that you're doing\nthe best you can you you know you don't\nhave a whole lot of time and you're\ntrying to keep it together just be\nhonest with yourself because sometimes\nwe just all have to be adults and just\nsay hey you know what yeah I have been\nlazy and I'm going to change it so the\nimportant thing though is to admit your\nlaziness or that you have been lazy\ndon't call yourself lazy don't call\nyourself a procrastinator because if you\nsay I am lazy I am a procrastinator that\nis an identity statement and when you\nsay something and you identify with it\nit makes it much harder to break because\nthere's a small difference just listen\nthis I am lazy\nversus I have been lazy I have been I\nhave uh been procrastinating a lot\nrecently one of them is an identity\nstatement one of them is talking about\nbehaviors that you've been having\nrecently and so the reason why I say\ndon't say I am blank is because when you\nsay I am blank your subconscious\nautomatically stores that thing as true\nyou are not lazy you have just had lazy\nTendencies as of recently or you've\nhad lazy Tendencies your entire life but\nreally what it comes down to is stop\nidentifying with it is an important\naspect of it but admit your laziness to\nyourself call it what it is and once you\nadmit it and you put it out there on the\ntable then you can say but I no longer\nwant to have this laziness just like hey\nI'm I'm wearing if you're looking in\nthis video I'm wearing a blue shirt\nright I happen to be wearing a blue\nshirt I am not the blue shirt but if I\nwant to change this blue shirt I can\nchange this blue shirt same way where I\nhave been lazy not an identity statement\nI have been lazy I've had some laziness\nsome procrastinating in the past six\nmonths the past year two years whatever\nit might be I no longer want to wear\nthis shirt of laziness I want to change\nit and realize if I'm being honest with\nyou\nI think humans are just inherently lazy\nlike I honestly do like if you look at\nif we go back a million years ago and I\nlive in Texas and it's the let's say\nit's it's the middle of summer in Texas\na million years ago it's really hot here\nin the summer I would imagine just a\nguess that at noon 1 pm ish if anybody\nwho is in Austin Texas the place that I\nlive and it's 105 degrees in the middle\nof the summer a million years ago\nthey're probably not out working all day\nlong they probably wake up right when\nthe sun is starting to rise they do a\nlot of work they go out they do their\nhunting they get their water they do\nwhat they need to they and then in that\ntime when it's the hottest probably I'm\nbeing honest with you sitting under some\ntrees relaxing maybe eating some food\nall of that stuff and then once it\nstarts to cool down towards the end of\nthe day the Sun starts to get closer to\nsetting it's another opportunity to hunt\nto do things to go find water all of\nthat stuff and so I think just by\nknowing and coaching people for the past\n17ish years 18ish years at this point\nthen I just think humans are inherently\nlazy and that's okay\nbut it doesn't mean that that's who we\nhave to be all of the time we can work\nourselves out of it for me I was a very\nlazy person for the first 19 20 years of\nmy life until I found a company where\nhard work was rewarded and I actually\nstarted to build that inside of myself\nso I do believe that we will uh be able\nto build it inside of ourselves hard\nwork if we really truly want to and stop\nblaming anything outside of you take\ncontrol of it say hey this is my fault I\nam I am lazy I'm sorry I'm even\ndoing it myself not I am lazy I have\nbeen lazy and I'm going to blame myself\nand I'm going to take full acceptance of\nit but I am going to change it so that's\nthe first thing I want to make sure that\nyou do okay that's the first thing to\nget past is you have to admit it\nthe second thing is you have to make\nyour goals you have to first off\ntake your goals and make sure you have\ngoals and they need to make them\nbite-sized right and so I don't mean\nthat if your goal is to make a hundred\nthousand dollars this year to chop it in\nhalf and go to fifty thousand dollars\nthis year what I mean is to make that\ntake that goal and make it smaller right\nlike if you get a plate of steak\nput out in front of you you don't start\nto stress out about the entire plate of\nsteak because you have to fit the entire\nthing in your mouth it's one bite at a\ntime right it's the same thing with your\ngoals it's one bite at a time so you\nknow if let's say for example you're a\nsales rep and your goal is to make a\nhundred thousand dollars this year and\nyou do your math because as a sales rep\nyou should know for how many calls you\nneed to make turns into how many\nconversations how many conversations\nturn how many closes that you have you\ncould look at and say okay based off of\nmaking a hundred thousand dollars over\nthe course of the entire year that means\nthat I need to make calculations a\nhundred calls a week okay and if I'm\nworking five days a week I take those\n100 calls divided by five and I come up\nwith 20. I need to do 20 calls today so\nwhat you do is you focus on the 20 calls\nthat you need to do today not the\nhundred thousand dollars that you want\nto make over the course of the year and\nwhat you do is you start to focus on the\naction-based goals not the result that\nyou're working towards you always want\nto know the result that you're working\ntowards but you need to take your goals\nand make them bite size what do you need\nto do today\nto move the needle now you might do 20\ncalls and nobody answers\nyou might do 20 calls and you have more\npeople answer than normal\nthere's going to be on days there's\ngonna be off days all it's about is\nknowing your numbers and working towards\nthat thing you know if you want to save\nuh let's say you want to save six\nthousand dollars this year if you want\nto save six thousand dollars that's 500\na month how can you save 120 what is\nthat 125 a week right you start to make\nthem bite size because it's hard to\nfocus on something that's really far in\nthe future sometimes and I found with a\nlot of people we have really big goals\nand the bigger that our goals are\nthe more that we get paralysis by\nanalysis and the more that when we start\nto look at our big goals we see all of\nthe stuff that we have to do we see the\nentire process all of the work that has\nto go in and I've actually found a lot\nof people have become demotivated by the\nsize of their goals because they're too\nbig and they seem too far away\nso how do we get past that let's start\nfocusing on what do I need to do today\nhow do I take action today towards\nwhatever it is that I'm trying to work\ntowards so you take your goals and you\nmake them bite size the third thing that\nyou want to do is you want to find your\nyour why right if you care about your\ngoals that's good but the way to care\nabout your goals more is to find the why\nbehind the goals to find out really\ntruly why you want to do it I always\nlove to use this example and I've given\nit many times I'm giving a speech is I\nsay hey you know I'll be in a room with\n200 people and I'll say out of this room\nhow many of you will make a million\ndollars to how many of you think it's\nit's possible for you to make a million\ndollars legally this year\nI'm just going to ask you what how many\nyou know think about this to yourself\nwhat's the percentage chance of you\nmaking a million dollars legally this\nyear and usually it's like zero percent\nzero percent one percent two percent\nthree percent zero percent zero zero\nzero and it's all of these zeros all of\nthese ones everything almost everybody\nin the room is under five percent and\nthey say okay\nwhat's the percentage chance of you\nmaking a million dollars legally this\nyear and if you don't everyone that you\nlove dies\neveryone's like 100 100 a thousand\npercent a million percent there's no way\non Earth I won't hit that goal of making\na million dollars legally this year and\nI say that's really interesting because\nthe goal didn't change\nthe time frame didn't change the only\nthing that changed was your why behind\nthe goal so if your why is strong enough\nmy very first coach used to always say\nthis to me when your why is strong\nenough your how will reveal itself when\nyou know why you want to do something\nyou will get very resourceful as to how\nyou're going to get there right it's a\nhundred percent possible for everyone\nlistening this podcast to figure out a\nway to make a million dollars legally\nthis year maybe that's not your goal\nmaybe it is but just as an example it's\n100 possible but you just don't care\nenough in order to hit it you just don't\ncare\nand that's very simple you have to make\nyourself care more so when you look at\nyour goals when you look at what it is\nthat you want to do and you're trying to\nstop procrastinating trying to stop uh\nwith your laziness what do you do you\nstart to look at them and say why do I\nwant to hit this and I've told this\nstory many times before on the podcast\nbut my favorite story on this was I had\na coach years ago one of my very first\none-on-one clients\nand this was eightish years ago I would\nsay nine-ish years ago and and I said\nhey how much do you want to make this\nyear he said I want to make a hundred\nthousand dollars and I said okay why do\nyou want to make a hundred thousand\ndollars I want to make a hundred\nthousand dollars this year because I\nhave never made that before okay why do\nyou want to make it though like tell me\nwhy well I want to make it because I\nfeel like it would make you know my life\nbetter okay why why would it make your\nlife better well it'd make my life\nbetter because I could you know provide\nfor my family better okay tell me more\nabout that and win deeper and went\ndeeper and went deeper and why why why\nwhy why why why why and eventually it\nwent for a moment he wanted to make a\nhundred thousand dollars this year to\nthe real reason why you want to make a\nhundred thousand dollars was because he\nhad recently gotten divorced he had lost\ncustody of his children his ex-wife had\nthe children and she lived in a really\nbad part of town\nand his main worry I'll just tell you\nflat out what he actually told me was\nthat his main worry with his young\nchildren they're both under the age of\nuh seven his main worry was that his\ndaughter would get pregnant before she\nturned 18 years old and his son might be\nkilled in a drive-by\nand he wanted to make a hundred thousand\ndollars so that he could buy a house\nafford to be able to put the down\npayment down go back to the the judge\nsay I have a safe place for them to live\nand I want them to live with me and I\nwant them to have a better education now\nwhich one of those two goals it's still\nthe same goal but which one of those\nwhys do you think is stronger for him I\nwant to make a hundred thousand dollars\nbecause I've never done it before or I\nwant to make a hundred thousand dollars\nbecause of all of this stuff in the ways\nthat it would change his Children's Life\nyeah the children is much stronger why\nyou have a much he at that point in time\nfound a version of himself that didn't\nexist because he got really clear on why\nhe wanted to take action so you've got\nto find your why that's number three\nnumber four get really good at removing\ndistractions a lot of times I've found\nthat it's not that you're lazy or let's\nsay that's that's an identity statement\nit's not that you have laziness or lazy\nTendencies it's not that you\nprocrastinate often it's that you\nactually have too many distractions in\nyour life and so one of the biggest\nthings everybody knows one of our\nbiggest distractions our phone and so if\nyou're really trying to be productive is\nthere a way that when you have your\nabsolute productivity time of I need to\nbe productive right now you take your\nphone\nyou put it somewhere else you know if\nyou work in an office and you need to\nmake your\n20 phone calls today leave your phone in\nthe drawer or you know go ahead and give\nit to your boss and say hey I can't get\nthis back until I get my 20 phone calls\ndone or leave it inside of your car\nwhatever it is that you need to do if\nyou work from home thing that I do when\nI work from home is I end up just taking\nmy phone and I put it inside I work in\nmy office in my house is I put it inside\nof the drawer in the kitchen and it's\nliterally probably takes me 15 seconds\nto walk and get it if I really want to\nbut that little bit of resistance of it\nbeing further away from me allows me to\nbe way more productive so how can you\nmove your distractions you know there's\nthere's your phone there's\num TV\nthere's you're you know completely\ncluttered dust that you work on and you\ncan't find anything in there how can you\nremove the distractions of other people\nsometimes other people want to come in\nand they want to talk to you right can\nyou can you figure out a way to do that\ncan you put on headphones so that no one\ncomes and bothers you or can you put a\nsign on your office so that no one comes\nin and actually knocks or anything hey\nif it's an emergency come in if not you\ncan talk to me after 3 pm send me an\nemail whatever it might be turn off all\nthe notifications on your computer so\nthat while you're sitting down and\nworking and getting that deep work done\nthere's no way for any notifications to\nto get your focus\nright let everyone know no distractions\nput your headphones on turn the computer\nnotifications off put your phone in\nanother room how can you get really good\nat removing distractions so that\ntherefore you can move the needle on the\nthings that are most important for you\nso that's number four number five\nmy favorite technique for getting being\nproductive is the Pomodoro Technique\nI don't know how many times I've talked\nabout the Pomodoro Technique on this\npodcast but it's many what it means is\nyou do one task and one task only for 25\nminutes you can do anything for 25\nminutes and so if you just say all right\nyou know I'm not worried about this huge\ngoal that I have I just want to take the\nright steps in the right direction for\nthe next 25 minutes and you give\nyourself one task and one task only no\ndistractions you set an alarm like I\nliterally have an alarm not my phone but\nan old school alarm that is on my desk\nthat I can set for 25 minutes and I give\nmyself 25 minutes of dedicated deep work\nat working at this thing you do it for\n25 minutes you take five minutes off and\nthe key is when you take those five\nminutes off you don't look at your phone\nyou know doing that stuff what you do is\nyou go outside you go for a walk you\njust you know you close your eyes and\njust do some deep breathing but the\npoint is you want to be focused for 25\nminutes and then five minutes of being\nunfocused when you're looking at your\nphone or you're doing something else or\ntalking to you that is still focused\nwork and so it's the same thing is like\nwhen you're working out you can work out\nreally hard and then you rest for a\nminute and you're working really hard\nyou rest for a minute you work really\nhard you rest for a minute same thing\nwith your brain 25 minutes of dedicated\nwork give yourself five minutes off\nclose your eyes do some deep breathing\ngo outside go for a walk sit on a park\nbench and just look at the you know the\nthe scenery the landscape around you a\nlot of times I'll go out on my porch and\nyou know we have a few Acres around us\nso I'll just stare at trees and I'm just\nlike I'm just going to relax for a\nlittle bit I'm gonna let my brain just\nkind of chill for a little bit and do\nwhat it wants to do and you use the\nPomodoro Technique you start noticing\nthat it is a little hard at first it\ngets a little bit hard if you're not\nused to just being focused on just one\nthing but your brain you train yourself\nyou're like a dog right dog might poop\nin the house the first week two weeks\nthree weeks it lives with you and then\nover time you start training it it\nstarts going outside same thing your\nbrain might be unfocused unfocused\nunfocused unfocused unfocused then you\nstart to work at this and it becomes\nbetter at being focused and getting\nthings done and so that right there is\nfive ways to stop your procrastinating\nto get things done to stop your laziness\nand to actually start to move the needle\nin your life so that's what
