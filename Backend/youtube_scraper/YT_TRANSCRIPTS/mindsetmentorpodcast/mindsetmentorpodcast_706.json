    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to use your ego for good now\nwhen we hear the word ego in the way\nthat I've always thought of it I've\nalways had a bad connotation around ego\nbecause we hear things about how ego can\nbe destructive you know oh that's his\nego is just too big or oh that was that\nwas her ego taking over or that's that\nwas just through ego talking or that's\nhis egoic side and the ego seems like a\nnegative and destructive\npsychological thing that we have inside\nof us but\ngo on a journey with me here is it\npossible that we could use our ego for\ngood is it possible that we could use it\ninstead of being negative and\ndestructive to use it to be positive and\nconstructive\nI think that we can and I'm actually\ngoing to give you some examples of how\nyou can use your ego is it also possible\nthat maybe our ego will never go away\nyou know let's say you live to 100 years\nold hopefully let's hope I live to 100\nyears old I'm 37 right now so that means\nI got what 63 more years is it possible\nthat I could over the next 63 years\nlearn how to work with my ego and learn\nhow to have an ego that comes in and\ncomes out and all that stuff but\nit never actually goes away\nI think that it is part of us and I\nthink that it's a part of us that was\nbuilt into basically our operating\nsystem as a child and to get rid of it I\ndon't know if it's gonna ever happen and\nso if I'm never gonna get rid of it I\nmight as well learn how to work with it\nright I think it's a possibility that it\nwill never go away it's actually part of\nyour psychological makeup when you read\npsychology books they talk about how the\nego is a part of your psychological\nmakeup and if we can't get rid of our\nego what we can do is we can accept it\nand then start to use it for good and\nthat's what we're going to talk about\ntoday and the way that I really started\nto understand this is over the past few\nmonths\nso as I was writing my book uh we went\nthrough like seven rounds of edits like\nso many different I've spent countless\nhours editing the book and changing it\nand making it better and adding to it\nand subtracting from it and changing\nwords around to make a sentence more\nrich and I was just putting so much\neffort over and over and over again you\nknow while I'm still doing this podcast\nwhile I'm running my business with over\n30 people that work for me and and I'm\nthinking to myself\nI'm just trying to create the best book\nthat I can like I really truly want to\ncreate the best book that I can because\nI know that the better that the book is\nthe more likely it is to impact\nsomeone's life and the more that it\nimpacts their life the more likely they\nare to recommend it to somebody right\nand when they recommend it to somebody\nthen somebody else will buy it and it's\nlikely to change their life as well and\nso all of this is true\nbut as I was thinking this I took a step\nback and I started to play Devil's\nAdvocate as I like to do is try to see\nif I can see both sides so it's like I'm\ntrying to see both sides of the coin and\nso my I noticed that as I was playing\nDevil's Advocate I was thinking about my\nego in here and I was thinking to myself\nyeah you do want to help people you do\nwant to help change the world you do\nwant it to be recommended to people\nbut you also just want to sell a lot of\nbooks\nlike you you also do want to be a New\nYork Times best-selling author and you\ndo want a lot of people to buy it yes\nand if a lot of people do buy it you'll\nmake more money off of it\nI thought to myself\nall of that is true as well\nso is there anything wrong with those\nlike is there anything wrong with\nwanting to make money off is there\nanything wrong with wanting to be a New\nYork Times bestseller is there anything\nwrong with wanting to sell a lot of\ncopies no there's nothing wrong with it\nbut is there a case that both of those\nsides are true and I was like yeah they\nare like I do really want to impact the\nworld and like it would be nice to\nmake money off this thing right and then\nI started thinking to myself interesting\nis it possible that my ego is actually\nhelping me create a better book My egoic\nSide my selfish side that wants to to\nhave a New York Times best-selling book\nand to make a lot of money my selfish\nside that ego excited me is it helping\nme create a better book\nand if I create a better book\nbecause of my ego as well I will help\nmore people so\nis my ego this thing that's supposed to\nbe so bad\nactually helping me help more people and\nI was like oh damn it actually is\nand I realized\nthat my IBO ego can actually be used for\ngood but it's got to be directed\ncorrectly it can't just run wild it's\nlike the way I like to think of like an\nego is like a bull right a bull is just\nan animal it's just there and a wild\nbull could be absolutely dangerous if\nyou're in a small room with it right but\na bowl that maybe was birthed on a farm\nin a village that's been raised around\nhumans and has been trained to do\ncertain jobs like it can pull a plow and\nit can go through an entire garden and\nplow the land so that therefore they can\nguard it and they can create more food\nthat bowl that's trained to be able to\npull a plow can help create more food\nfor a village to eat same animal\ndifferent scenarios of how it might be\nused one is used intentionally and the\nother one it's just dangerously running\naround\nsame thing for your ego your ego and\nmine up until recently has been running\nwild\nand your ego can run wild and it can be\ndangerously running wild like that bull\ncan or if used correctly it can be used\nintentionally so then that really brings\nthe question and how do you use your ego\nfor good well when I say your ego or\nyour egoic side what's the first thing\nthat pops into your head like what is\nthe first thing that pops into your head\nabout yourself is it your your\nselfishness is it your jealousy your\njudgmental side your arrogance your\ninsecurities the fact that sometimes\nyou're self-centered your defensiveness\nyour attachment to certain things your\nresistance to change your perfectionism\nlike what's the thing that when I say\nyour ego you're like that's the first\nthing that pops up\nthat's the first thing I want you to\nthink of is what is the side of you that\nis kind of like hey I'm right here\nthis is the thing we should work on this\none first right what is what is that\nthing that pops up into your head\nokay now that's what we're going to work\nthrough the first thing that you need to\ndo in my opinion with this egoic side of\nyou is to accept that it is part of you\njust like my arm like if you look in the\nvideo this is my arm I have to accept\nthat this is my arm you know you might\nhave a hairy arm you might have a\nfreckle on your arm but you don't go and\ncut off your arm because it's not quote\nunquote perfect right you accept it it\nis there and it may be there forever\nhopefully you have your arm forever so\nwhat we need to do\nthe first step of all of this is to say\nyes I do have ego I do have egoic sides\nI do have some selfishness or some\nself-centeredness or some judgmental\nside or I do have some defensiveness I\ndo have all of these aspects of me and\njust as I you know might be outgoing or\nI might be shy or I might be happier I\nmight be joyful it might be peaceful or\nit might be calm all of those are\naspects of myself the same way that all\nof the ego sides of me are also aspects\nof myself so the first thing I think\nthat we need to do collectively is\naccept hey you know what I do have an\nego\nit's there it's been there for since\nsomething happened to me when I was\nyounger I don't even know what it was\ncould have been three years old four\nyears old five years old and I started\nto develop this side of me\nand at this point in time that that side\nof me is very mature so getting rid of\nit probably won't happen so what I can\ndo\nis I can take a step back and say you\nknow what I'm just going to accept that\nit's there and a lot of times\nwhen you accept that it's there it has a\nwhole lot less control over you and then\nyou can start to use it for good so that\nselfish side of my ego that I described\nearlier the selfishness that I was\ntalking about when I was talking about\nwriting the book is just a part of Rob\nthat's just the way that I see it I have\naccepted it and I've accepted that it\nmay be here forever and if you know you\ncannot teach the ego to be anything\nother than egotistic so if that's the\ncase I'm just going to try to use it to\nhelp me create more amazing things okay\nso that's the first thing is we need to\naccept it what's the second thing when\nyou do the second thing we need to do is\nwe need to change our relationship with\nit I was teaching this a few days ago to\na bunch of people I said it's kind of\nlike marrying somebody and you get the\nin-laws and you might not get along with\nyour mother-in-law or your father-in-law\nbut they're there like there you just\nhave to accept that they're there and so\nif they're not going to be going\nanywhere you need to change your\nrelationship with them it's kind of how\nthe ego is too you need to be able to\nchange your relationship with it you\nneed to find the good in there you need\nto find the good that's inside of that\nego\nlike I was talking about the selfishness\nthat I was describing earlier helped me\nwrite a better book and that better book\nwill eventually change some people's\nlives it might change Millions it might\nchange 400 I don't know but I'm\naccepting that it is there and it helped\nme write a better book and if it's going\nto be there how can you change your\nrelationship with it so instead of being\nin constant battle with it can I change\nmy relationship with it and you know I\ncan see that although there has been\nsome bad that has come from that egoic\nside of me\nalso a lot of good has come from it as\nwell so the question I have for you is\ncan you find the good that has come from\nyour ego can you find like take a step\nback\nyou know press pause if you need to on\nthis close your eyes and just think like\nwhat good has come from my defensiveness\nor my selfishness or my\num\nself-centeredness or whatever it is what\nall of those different things you could\nhave possibly I described all of them\nearlier I can't remember off top of my\nhead right what good has come from it if\nyou need to pause this episode and close\nyour eyes and ask yourself like what\ngood has come from it see if you can\nfind it or if you have a pen and paper\neven better you can journal the question\nlike what good has come what good has my\nego created in me or in the world and it\nmight be hard to find at first I usually\nfind that when you're you're trying to\nchange your perception on something like\nsomething that you viewed as a negative\naspect of yourself and now you're going\nto try to look through a positive lens\nit can be very hard it might be hard to\nfind but I promise you that it's there\nand it's hard to find because I'm asking\nyou to look through a completely\ndifferent lens then you've looked at it\nin your entire life\nbut when it comes down to it there is\ngood there and so what you have to do\nchange your relationship around it right\nfind the good that is in that thing same\nway with the in-laws there might be some\nnegative things of the in-laws but I\nguarantee there's still some positive\nthings can you start focusing more on\nthe positive things so that's the second\nthing and then the third thing to do is\nas you've actually started to accept it\nchange a relationship with it is\nactually start to use it for good use it\nnow to create something better in this\nworld the way that I like to think about\nis like a a tool in a toolbox right I\ncan pull my ego out when I want to\ncreate better content and go well I want\nto create better content so people like\nme more I want to create better content\nso the more people listen to my podcast\nso I want to create better content so I\nmake more money or become more famous\nwhatever the you want right I can\nlook at it that way but I can also say\nbut it is also helping me create more\ncontent that is better and if it's\nbetter\nthan what I could have done it will also\nbe impacting more people so it's just\nlike a tool in a toolbox how can you use\nit for good\nwhenever you need to like when you need\nto\num put a nail into a wall and you're\ntrying to hang something what is the\nabsolute best tool that you can reach\nfor you're going to reach for your\nHammer right you want to reach for your\nHammer to hammer in a nail\nbut you don't use the hammer if you're\ntrying to screw something into a board\nwhat do you use for that now could you\nuse it I guess you could use it but\nreally what it comes down to is you're\ngoing to try to find a screwdriver for\nthat and so really what it comes down to\nis your ego in different aspects of your\negos your ego can be used depending on\nwhen it is needed so how can you start\nto see it as like a tool in your toolbox\nand you can just pull it out whenever\nyou need it it's not running wild it's\nnot always working you're not always\nrunning around smacking things with\nhammers but when you need that hammer\nwhen you have a nail is when you're\ngoing to go to it you're when you have a\nscrew and you need to screw it in you're\ngoing to find a screwdriver so it's the\nsame thing for your ego it's a tool\nthat's in your tool belt ready to be\nused intentionally\nthat's the key word you have to be able\nto use it intentionally when you need to\nuse it and the point is that you use it\nnot it uses you because for most of our\nLives the ego inside of us has been\nusing us the real question is how can we\nlearn to use that tool in our toolbox\nwhen we use it versus it actually using\nus and then what we do is we realize\nthat we could go through this and there\nmight be you know one aspect of your ego\nthat you don't really like or with all\nthe things that I said earlier there\nmight be many aspects of your ego that\nyou don't like you might look at that\nand if I go back to the to the list you\nknow you could go yeah I do have a few\nof them like there is selfishness\nthere's jealousy there's judgmental\nthere's some arrogance there's some\ninsecurity there is some\nself-centeredness defensiveness\nattachment resistance to change there is\nsome perfectionism all of those things\nexist how can I use each of those to be\nbetter how can I start to use them for\ngood and there might be one aspect you\nEagle you want to change ninja might be\nmultiple aspects of the ego that you\nwant to change but you have to kind of\ngo through the three-step process and\nfirst thing is to just accept that it is\nthere it is an aspect of you and it\nprobably will be an aspect of you\nforever that's the first thing and if it\nis an aspect of you forever you need to\nchange your relationship with it and\nstart to actually find some good that\ncan come from it and then\nthird thing is you need to use it for\ngood and so if you go through this\nprocess what you'll start to realize is\nthat\nbecomes really easy to let go and start\nto stop judging yourself for so much of\nthe ego that you might have and start\nseeing that it does have a use it can be\nused for good and if I use it correctly\nit can also help me create a better life\nfor myself and those people around me as\nwell and that my friends is how you\nbefriend your ego and use it for good so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor right now help us grow\nthis podcast take a
