    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout self-love we're going to talk\nabout how to love yourself more we're\ngoing to talk about how to change your\nnegative self-talk I hear this so often\nI hear so many people saying I talk\nnegatively to myself I'm my worst critic\nI guilt myself I shame myself I'm so bad\nto myself and so what I want to talk\nabout is it seems like self-love can be\nso so corny like oh just just love\nyourself more but in reality what I'm\nreally talking about is is being your\nyour biggest fan stop being your biggest\ncritic and start being your biggest fan\nwhy is self-love so important because if\nyou love yourself and you truly\nappreciate yourself it helps with your\nconfidence\nif you don't and you talk trash to\nyourself it hurts with your confidence\nwhich in turn affects the actions that\nyou do take in this world or the actions\nthat you don't take in this world you\nknow if you look at\nsomebody who is a confident person\nthat's somebody who I'm sure they talk\nnegatively to themselves sometimes but\nI'm sure more often than not they\nactually talk positively to themselves\nwhich makes it easier for me to take\naction when you look at someone that's\nnot confident when you look at someone\nwho's not taking action when they're\nbeating themselves up in their head\nlet's be real it just doesn't feel good\nright it doesn't feel good to shame\nyourself and guilt yourself and be your\nbiggest self-critic and when you don't\nfeel good it makes it really hard to\ntake action\nand it also just affects the way that\nyou feel it affects the way that you\ncarry yourself in every single moment it\naffects the way that you interact with\nothers it affects so many areas of your\nlife and that will in turn affect what\nyou do or do not do in this world it\nwill affect if you do or do not find a\nsignificant other or what significant\nother you end up attracting because you\nattract someone who is like you\nso if you are not confident if you are\nnegative to yourself you won't be able\nto attract The Confident person the type\nof person that you could attract the\nenergy just it won't match right and so\nlike men if you're listening out there I\nknow you can relate if you want to\nattract like an awesome badass Confident\nWoman you have to be on another level of\nconfidence and it all comes back to the\nway that you treat yourself\nit all comes back to your self-love it\nall comes back the way that you talk to\nyourself so in today's episode I'm going\nto be teaching you some tips on how to\nbe better to yourself how to be your\nbest friend how to be be your biggest\nfan how to have more self-love and so to\nstart off I want you to imagine just for\na moment imagine a child who is talked\ndown to their entire lives right imagine\na child whose parent tells them that\nthey're stupid and then they're\nworthless and that they're unlovable and\nthat they're an idiot and then they go\nto school and they hear it from their\nteachers and they hear from everybody\nthey're told how stupid they are that\nthey're never amount to anything day in\nday out most of the day\npeople are just talking trash to them\nit's it's terrible to think about isn't\nit but it happens\nthe amount of conversations I've had\nwith people whose parents are just\nnot good people if I'm being honest and\nthey just treated them so terribly and\nblame them for everything bad in their\nlife and was so hardcore and militant\nwith what they could and could not do\nand they had to do everything perfect\nbut there's no way to be perfect it's\nterrible to think about but it happens\nif you think about that child\nand you think about fast forwarding a\nyear of that two years of that three\nyears of that\nhow wounded do you think that child\nwould be not physically but mentally\nemotionally spiritually how wounded do\nyou think they would be probably a lot\nright and how do you think that that\nwould affect them in what they believe\nin themselves as they grow up\nyou can see it right\nyou can understand it you can start to\nsee how if their parents are just really\nnegative maybe they have a father that\njust talks down to them and talks trash\nthem and expects Perfection and is\nmilitant and tells them how they're not\ngood enough smart enough unlovable\nwhatever it might be\nyou can see how that talk would affect\nthem long term in their life right it's\nobvious that it would\nwhat the hell is the difference between\nthat child\nin you\ndon't think that just because you're\nolder that something's different\nthere's very little difference between\nthat child and their abuser and you and\nyour abuser\nbut the difference is your abuser is you\nyour abuser if you talk negatively to\nyourself if you shame yourself if you\nget to guilt yourself the abuser your\nabuser is you the child can walk away\neventually\nyou can't walk away from yourself if you\ntalk down to yourself if you talk\nnegatively to yourself if you guilt\nyourself and shame yourself you are your\nown abuser just admit it finally\nand I always think about this one time\nI saw this video my friend Jay Shetty\nshared it years ago then he sat down\nwith these ladies and they were in their\nprobably late 20s early 30s and he said\nhey do you do you have negative\nself-talk and they said yes I have\nnegative self-talk he said here's what I\nwant you to do here's a pen and paper I\nwant you to write down all of the things\nthat you say to yourself whatever they\nmight be if whether it's stupid you look\nfat you're unlovable\nyour acne any of those things write down\nevery bad thing that you say to yourself\nand they come up with this massive list\nhe says okay hey we're going to go into\nanother room\nbring the pen and paper with you\nthey bring him into the other room and\nin the other room is their little sister\nand their little sisters are like 8 9 10\n12 13 years old\nand they sit down across them and he\ngives them the pen and paper and he says\nI want you to tell her what you wrote\ndown on that piece of paper and say it\ndirectly to her\nand they're like appalled these women\nare just appalled no I would never do\nthat I would never say that and he's\nlike if you won't say it to them\nyour little sister why would you say it\nto yourself\nright you would never talk to someone\nthat you love the way that you talk to\nyourself so why do you do it because if\nyou truly love yourself you should talk\nto yourself the way that you would talk\nto that little sister\nyou know it's like the example\nof like you go to your friend goes on a\na first date\nshe gets a Tinder date or whatever\npeople are using nowadays and she swipes\nwhatever Direction you swipe she goes on\nthis date with this guy in the middle of\nthe date he ends up leaving and he's\nlike hey I just don't think we're a good\nfit like you're a nice person except\nwe're just not a good fit and she called\nyou up first and she's on her way home\nand she feels really bad and she feels\nreally down about he just ended up\nleaving he said I wasn't a good fit\nyou know and you're there would you go\nwell yeah of course that makes sense I\nmean if we're being honest you put on\nlike 15 pounds in the past six months\nand your job kind of sucks and you're\nalso not that smart and really you're\nnot the most lovable and you just go off\non your would you would you do that to\nyour friend if they were going through\nthat\nno of course you'd support her you'd\nmake her feel good\nbut if something like that happens to\nyou\nyou talk negatively to yourself\nwhy\nwhat do you say when you look in the\nmirror\nwhat do you say to yourself do you look\nin the mirror and you're like oh\nyou're looking older\nyou got a gray hair you're getting a\nlittle fat you got some acne you're\ngetting pudgy look at that muffin top\nwhy don't you get your fat ass to the\ngym like do you say that type of stuff\nto yourself because that ain't helping\nI'm telling you I promise you that or do\nyou look at yourself and you're like you\nknow what you're doing your best you're\ngetting better\nyou've been reading you've been going to\nthe gym a little bit more you've been\neating a little bit healthier and for\nthat I'm proud of you do you talk to\nyourself that way or the other way\ndo you compare yourself to other people\ncomparison to thief of all joy don't\ncompare your body to someone on\nInstagram that could basically be\nchanging their body around through\nPhotoshop you know like I always see my\nmy wife always shows me she'll someone\nwill pop up on her Instagram and it'll\nbe this real skinny woman\nher arms are down at her side and you\nguys know if you've seen this before and\nthen like their elbows look like they're\nhuge because they're actually pulling in\ntheir stomach and when they pull in\ntheir stomach their elbows in the\npicture pull in with it so they look\nlike they're kind of like like a fake\narms right there's people that you could\nbe looking on on Instagram and comparing\nyourself to someone but you don't\nrealize they're fully photoshopping\nthemselves or you know you just started\nyour fitness journey and they've been on\ntheir fitness journey for 16 years\nyou know and you tell yourself oh you're\njust fat you're you know you you don't\nlook anywhere near as good as them\nyou're not gonna be as good as them\nright you can't compare yourself to\nother people who are either further\nalong the journey than you or who are\nphotoshopping themselves comparison to\nthe thief of all joy\nbut you talk trash to yourself because\nyou procrastinated and now you're\ncomparing yourself to you know\nsomeone who looks better than you in a\nbikini or who looks has more of a\nsix-pack than you\nor you're comparing yourself to your\nfriend who just bought that massive\nhouse the friendly from high school you\nhaven't seen in a long time or you're\npissed because you're driving a you know\n20 year old Kia and you know you're\nthinking about the 18 year old Bitcoin\nmillionaire that just put up pictures on\nInstagram of his new Lamborghini and\nyou're comparing yourself and you're\ntalking trash yourself you compare\nyourself you're talking trash to\nyourself\nhere's the things you have to realize\nWhere You Are\nis where you are that's a fact\nthere's nothing that you could change\nabout where you currently are in this\nmoment the only thing that you can\nchange is from here forward\nI do know one fact it will be harder\nto motivate yourself\nto go to the gym\nit'll be harder to motivate yourself to\nstop procrastinating and to work harder\nto create the life that you want if you\nfeel like\nand guess what talking trash to yourself\ndoes\nit makes you feel like\nso if you're trying to create the life\nthat you want but you're too busy\ntalking to yourself you're too busy\nguilting yourself shaming yourself\ntelling yourself how you're not good\nenough all of that it's going to be even\nharder to make a change\nhow do you feel when when you see\nsomeone you haven't seen in a while\nmaybe six months and they're like oh my\nGod you look so much better you look\ngreat or you've lost some weight look at\nhow well you're doing I'm so proud of\nyou they tell you how much they love you\nthey tell you that you're doing so much\ngood in the world that they're proud of\nall the things that you overcome and\nthey actually tell you from like a real\nplace of love and you can feel that\nthey're telling you from a place of love\nhow does that make you feel\nyou should feel great doesn't it if it\nactually sinks in and you can let\nyourself accept a compliment it feels\ngreat right imagine if you had that\nperson all day every day in your head\nimagine what you could be if you just\nhad that person in your side\nimagine if you\ncould talk to yourself the same way that\nthat person talks to you\nif you could turn from your biggest\ncritic to your biggest fan\nyou've got to learn to be your biggest\nfan you've got to notice\nwhen you're not saying the things that\nyou say to yourself which is\nin and of itself another thing because\nyou actually have to become aware of\nwhat you're saying to yourself\nyou become aware of oh my gosh what I\njust why did I just say it to myself\nthat was so terrible I'm going to take\nthat one negative thing I just said to\nmyself I'm going to look in the mirror\nI'm gonna look myself in the eye I'm\ngonna say three positive things\nbecause you're either your biggest fan\nor your biggest critic\nyou're the Biggest Fan your biggest\ncritic I know one of my things I used to\ndo and I would give speeches\nI don't give a whole lot of speeches\nanymore it's not really something that I\ndo a whole lot of but I used to go and I\nwould give speeches and I would be in\ngroups of people and I'd say okay you\nhave 60 seconds we're gonna have a\ncompetition I want you to write down all\nof the negative things about yourself\nall of the things that you hate about\nyourself the things that you wish were\ndifferent make a list we're gonna have a\ncompetition 60 seconds Ready set go and\npeople will just write and maybe you\nknow it was just like hardcore people\nwould be writing they'd have these\nmassive lists at the end of 60 seconds\nI'd have like 30 40 50 60. 70 things\nthat they don't like about themselves\nthey want to change they're pissed off\nabout themselves they hate about\nthemselves whatever it might be they'd\nhave this massive list\nI'd say okay now we're going to flip it\nyou have 60 seconds write down\neverything that you love about yourself\ngo and people would be like um\nand it was like it was so interesting\nbecause you can realize\npeople had like 60 things that they hate\nabout themselves in 60 seconds and like\nthree things they love about themselves\nand you realize the reason why it's so\nhard to think of things they love about\nthemselves is because they don't think\nabout those things often but they do\nthink about all the things they hate\nabout themselves they do say all of\nthose things themselves every single day\nand so we're so used to thinking about\nwhat we don't want what we want to\nchange what we hate which I do think is\nis naturally part of the human condition\nis because you know if we look at the\nfact that two million years ago we don't\nhave food right now we're going to look\nat the negative thing to try to overcome\nit\nand we're not going to look at like oh\nwell you know I feel good and my cavemen\nloincloth right like we're not going to\ndo that\nbut nowadays we have food Water Shelter\nclothing all of that stuff but our brain\nstill inherently goes to negative we\nhave to actually push ourselves to be\nmore positive because you get what you\nfocus on and if you focus on all of the\n I promise you this you're going to\nget more\nyour input in your in your brain will\nequal the output like it drives me crazy\nhow many people think that they could\njust be negative themselves talk trash\nthemselves all of this and just think\nthey're magically going to create a\npositive life of create a beautiful life\nno it's like what you put in is what\nyou'll get out if you walk up to a\ngarden you plant strawberry seeds you\nknow that you're not going to get\ntomatoes that are going to grow\nsame thing that if you plant negative\nseeds in your mind you will get more\nnegative things you will get the fruit\nthat you bear like you will bear the\nfruit that you put in there like it's\njust the way that it goes\nif you focus on you're going to get\nmore\nso if you start to think about this why\ndon't you start focusing on everything\nthat you do love about yourself I used\nto have people do this as well when they\nbecome brand new clients of mine because\nso many people are so negative it was\ndriving me crazy as I would say okay\nhere's one of your assignments for this\nweek\nI want you to create like an awesome\nlist I want you to create every single\nlittle teeny tiny thing that you love\nabout yourself every little achievement\nthat you've had if you got fourth place\nin a third grade spelling bee I want you\nto write that you got fourth place in a\nthird grade spelling bee whatever it is\nthat you've done I want you to create an\nawesome list this this list of makes you\nthat makes you an awesome person and\npeople would come back and they'd be\nlike I didn't think I could come up with\n100 things but I somehow came up with\n100 things I said yes did it take you\ntime or it took me so much time of\ncourse it did why because you're never\nfocusing on what you're doing well\nyou're always focusing on what you're\nnot doing well and so you have to\nrealize if you want to create the life\nthat you want to if you want to get past\nyour fears you're limiting beliefs\ncreate the life that you want all of\nthose things\nyou have to start focusing what is it\nyou love about yourself you have to\nstart being your biggest fan it's so\nmuch easier to take action when you feel\ngood and when you feel good it usually\ncomes from what you speak to speak to\nyourself now will you be perfect 100 in\nevery single thought that you have\nabsolutely not and I don't intend to\never be perfect in my thoughts but I do\nknow that when a negative thought pops\nup I like to replace it with a positive\nthought three positive thoughts\nwhen you have those ants automatic\nnegative thoughts that pop up can you\nreplace them with three positive things\nwhen you notice yourself saying to\nyourself and per in your head can you\nimmediately replace it and what you\nnotice is as you start doing this you\nbecome more mindful of what is that you\nsay become more mindful of all of this I\nremember hearing um Peter attia was\ntalking about this on a podcast and he\nwas saying for the first 47 years of his\nlife like he was a militant he was so\nhard on himself and you the stuff that\nhe would say and he would he would\nscream it out loud to himself sometimes\nas well was so hard that he was like I I\ncan't keep doing this I've got to stop\nand he went to a place psychologists\nwere like yeah we can help you we could\nwe could help you get through it and\nhe's like I don't honestly think that\nyou can I've been talking to myself this\nway for 47 years I don't think it's\ngoing to take it's going to take another\n40 years to change me and they go okay\nwe'll just do exactly what we're saying\nwe'll change we'll help you change\nyourself\nso his therapist whenever he would start\nto notice himself talk negatively to\nhimself what he would say his therapist\nwould say here's what I want you to do\nwhenever you notice yourself talk\nnegatively yourself about this thing\nthis thing that you messed up on what I\nwant you to do is I want you to record a\nvoice message and imagine that you're\ntalking to your best friend so he has a\nbest friend he said I want you to\nimagine your best friend calls you and\nsays hey this is the thing that I just\nscrewed up on\nI need some help I need you to tell me\nhow to get out of I need you to tell me\nyou know I need you to make me feel\nbetter and they the psychologist said\nwhat would you say to your friend\nI want to record that in a voicemail\nand so what happened was he would record\nit and you would pretend that he's\ntalking to his friend every single time\nthat he would quote unquote screw up or\ndo something wrong and he would pretend\nthat he was talking to his friend to\nmake his friend feel better about the\nthing that he screwed up with\nand then he had to hit send and he had\nto send it to his psychologist and he's\nlike man I felt so bad it was like seven\nvoice notes ten voice notes a day and I\nwas sending it and sending it and\nsending it and sending and sending it\nand then over time\nI realized that I wasn't sending as many\nand it literally took 47 years of\nnegatively talking to himself it took\nfour months to rewire that out of\nhimself because what happened was he\nstarted getting into the repetition of\ninstead of talking negatively to himself\nand then recording the voice message and\npretend he's talking to his best friend\nand sending to a psychologist he started\nnoticing the negative self-talk and\nstopping it in the middle and then\nreplacing with a positive self-talk so\nit's not something that just goes away\nimmediately but if he can change 47\nyears in four months do you think that\nyou could probably change in the next\ncouple months you can you've just got to\nbe aware of the thoughts and you've got\nto learn a way to replace it and speak\nto yourself the same way that you speak\nto someone that you love so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me in at\nRob dial Junior Rob d-i-a-l-j-r\nI'm gonna be honest with you I
