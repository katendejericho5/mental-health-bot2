    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcasts I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be diving\ninto three evidence-based strategies to\novercome your anxiety and your anxious\nthoughts the one I think will probably\nhelp you the most I think all of them\nwill help you but the third one is the\none that I think would start to help you\nthe most overcoming your anxiety so that\nyou can start to get a little bit more\nand a little bit more a little bit more\nout of your comfort zone and so\nwhy is this important right now I was\ndoing research on this and found that\nthe Journal of anxiety disorders have\nfound that anxiety has gone up over 300\npercent since the pre-pandemic levels\nand anxiety is common it's natural and\nit's just a natural human response to\nstress to uncertainty but also most\nimportantly to perceived threats which\nwe'll dive into today what we're\nperceiving as threats that are coming up\nnot right now usually in the future and\nit's a good thing for humans to have\nanxiety because it's our brain\nprojecting into the future and telling\nour body to prepare for possible threats\nto prepare to fight or whatever it might\nbe that's coming up down the line but\nif you're waking up every single day and\nyou feel stress you feel anxiety and\nit's every single day or even all day\nlong when anxiety becomes chronic and it\nbecomes something that you're always\ndealing with it interferes with a lot of\nyour daily life and we really need to\nlearn how to address it and not to just\nsay hey you know just be better but\nactually use some some actual\npsychological evidence-based strategies\nthat are grounded in science of hey how\ndo we get yourself out of this how do we\nget out of this when we notice ourselves\nin it and today we're going to go over a\nfew of those research strategies to help\nyou with it but first off let's talk\nabout what anxiety is because if we can\nunderstand what it is and why it pops up\nthen when we find ourselves in the state\nof anxiety which we all do I find myself\nbeing anxious sometimes in the mornings\nespecially in the mornings when my\ncortisol levels are high then we can\nfind a way to get ourselves out of it so\nthe definition of anxiety\nis a feeling of unease such as worry or\nfear that can range from mild to severe\nand it's a it's normal to realize that\nit's an essential human emotion that\nserves as an Adaptive result uh response\nto danger or to challenges and anxiety\ncan pop up in two different ways it can\npop up with emotional symptoms which\nshould be worry fear irritability\ndifficult uh difficulty in in\nconcentrating restlessness when you're\ntrying to fall asleep and you can't seem\nto get yourself to go to sleep so that\nwould be the emotional side of it but\nalso physical symptoms as well the\ninteresting thing about anxiety is that\nyou can feel it in your body it can be\nmuscle tension it can be headaches it\ncan be trembling it could be rapid heart\nrate like your heart rate actually\nstarts to go go up it could be shortness\nof breath it can even mess with your\ndigestion and so I'm going to give you\nthree different strategies to help you\nthe first one is the easiest one and\nthat's the one we're going to dive into\nnumber one which is the first one I\nthink you should go to whenever you have\nthe awareness of I'm feeling anxious and\nthe first one is deep breathing the\nreason why is because the reason why\nthis is important to go over first is\nbecause with the other two strategies\nI'm going to give you if you're trying\nto go into these strategies which the\nother strategy I'm going to give you are\nare some thinking strategies\nbut your emotion is so high you won't be\nable to process through the brain and\nthrough your thinking process as easily\nbecause when emotion is high logic is\nlow when you are really anxious you tap\ninto your fight flight or freeze and\nthat's where the animalistic side of you\nyour survival part of you turns on\nthe thinking and processing an executive\ndecision actually turns off when you\nfeel that way so if you get your if you\nget the feeling of I'm anxious right now\nyou need to go to breathing first so\nthat therefore you can start to calm\nyourself down and your logic will be\nbetter after you calm yourself down so\ndeep breathing exercises can actually\nhelp activate your body's relaxation\nresponse and reduce anxiety levels and\nso when you're talking about deep\nbreathing the interesting thing about\nbreathing is when I tell people hey\nbreathe deep usually what they do is\nthey go\nand you can see that when they breathe\nin deep their shoulders actually raise\nand that's actually not a good breath\nit's a breath but it's not a good deep\ndiaphragmatic breath your diaphragm\nwhich is basically where your stomach is\nis where you want to breathe through and\nso when you breathe\nwhat you want to do is actually breathe\nand when you breathe in your stomach\nshould go out but your shoulders really\nshouldn't move and you get a deeper\nbreath you get a more quality breath\nwhen you breathe in through your\ndiaphragm versus just through your chest\nand the easiest one that I always\nrecommend because there's always like\nbox breathing there's four seven eight\nbreathing there's all these different\ntype of breathing techniques\nwhen you're stressed out when you're\nanxious last thing you want to do is\nfigure out if you're breathing correctly\nright I like to do just a simple one\nwhich is five seconds in 10 seconds out\nso just basically be try with me right\nnow so if we're feeling anxious we're\ngoing to do five in\nand breathe out\nso five in\n10 out if you can't breathe all the way\nin in five or can't breathe all the way\nout in 10 it could be four eight it\ncould be anything around there but the\nthe important part is that the out\nbreath needs to be longer than the\nin-breath is because when you breathe\nout slower\nyou actually start to slow your heart\nrate down with a longer exhale and the\nother thing that's important about too\nis you release carbon you release more\ncarbon dioxide when you breathe out\nand so the longer it is the more carbon\ndioxide it gets released which allows\ntension in your body tension in your\nmuscles and the CO2 that's stuck inside\nof your body to start to get out and so\nit lowers your stress levels to be able\nto do that so that's the first thing\nthat's important just five in ten out do\nat least six of them you'll already\nstart to feel better now that we've done\nthose breathing we're going to go into\nstrategy number two strategy number two\nis something called cognitive\nrestructuring it's a technique that\ninvolves identifying the challenging\nnegative thought patterns that are then\ncontributing to your anxiety in this\napproach just so you know is rooted in\ncognitive behavioral therapy which is\none of the best forms of therapy that\nyou can use that's what therapists a lot\nof therapists use CBT\nand it's been shown to be really\neffective in treating anxiety disorders\nand so there's a couple different pieces\nto it there's three pieces to the uh\nstrategy of cognitive restructuring the\nfirst one is identifying the negative\nthought so the first thing you want to\ndo is try to identify the negative\nthought\nit's to become aware of it the the ones\nthat are actually fueling your anxiety\nbecause what happens is this we have\nthings that are called automatic\nnegative thoughts those are just the\nones that pop up into our heads and we\ndon't even really necessarily notice\nthem because they're so automatic and we\ndon't really necessarily notice the\nthought but we notice how we feel and so\nwhen we notice that we don't feel good\nwe want to become aware of how the body\nfeels\nand then we want to actually come back\nand try to figure out what thought\ncreated that\nbecause there is a constant\ncommunication between your brain and\nbody at all points in time when your\nbrain has a thought whatever that\nthought might be it'll send\nneuropeptides to your body which\nbasically tells your hormones either hey\nrelease dopamine or at least serotonin\nwhich make you feel better or release\ncortisol release adrenaline which make\nyou feel anxious which make you feel\nuptight which make you feel fight flight\nor freeze and so we notice our body\nfeeling a certain way we need to take\nourselves out of the jar we need to read\nthe label and go okay I feel like I'm\nshortness of breath I feel like my heart\nrate might be up I feel I don't do I\nfeel good or do I feel bad if I'm being\nhonest like I don't really feel good\nokay\nnow I'm taking myself out of the jar I'm\ngoing to read the label what is the\nthought what was that what was I just\nthinking and that's the question I said\nwhat was I just thinking when I know\nsomeone I'm not feeling very good what\nwas I just feel what was I what was I\nthinking about usually your note you'll\nstart to notice your anxiety-inducing\nthoughts but the thing is you usually\nnotice your anxiety-inducing thoughts\nafter you notice your body's reaction to\nit your thought will usually come in so\nquick your body will react to it and\nthen you just notice that you don't feel\ngood\nokay I don't feel good what was I just\nthinking was I just thinking was I just\nthinking oh my gosh I was just thinking\nabout the presentation that I have to\ngive next week for my boss okay now we\ncan start to to work through those\nthings so that's the first thing is to\nactually identify the thoughts that are\nactually not making you feel good that's\nthe first piece number two is you're\ngoing to challenge the negative thought\nthis is one of the things that people\ndon't really do they don't really\nchallenge their thoughts they don't\nchallenge their beliefs once you've\nidentified the thought what you want to\ndo is evaluate the accuracy and the\nrationality of the thought\nconsidering Alternatives what else you\ncould be thinking any other outcomes\nthat could come out other than you know\nfailing at your boss and looking like an\nidiot in the presentation and you want\nto consider alternatives or different\nviewpoints as well and so\nchallenge the validity of the thought\nyou know how valid is that thought that\nis making you anxious and if you've been\nlistening podcasts for a while you know\nthat I've said this many times\npsychologists have found that 85 percent\nof what we worry about never even\nactually happens and so if we can\nchallenge our thought or say hey maybe\nit's not going to be as bad as I think\nit's going to be 85 of our thoughts of\nthe things that we worry about never\nactually happen out of the remaining 15\npercent only three percent of it happens\nthe way that we think that it will which\nmeans that 97 of the things that you\nworry about 97 of the things that you're\nanxious about\nturn out better than you think that it's\ngoing to and if that's the case\nWhat If instead of feeling anxious\ntowards a specific thought once we have\nidentified the thoughts so we do the\nbreathing exercise then we identify the\nthought\nwhat if we go okay\nwhat I'm thinking about is that I have\nthis presentation I have to give and\nwhen I think about the presentation I\nhave to give I start getting really\nworried about what if I fumble what if I\nmess up what if I get fired what if my\nboss thinks I'm an idiot and we start to\nthink that way okay if I could think the\nworst of the worst\ncan I at least try to start think of\nsomething different the best of the best\nor what if it doesn't turn out as bad as\nI think it's going to because 97 of the\ntime it's not going to turn out the way\nthat you think and so that's the thing\nis you want to actually start to\nchallenge the negative thought and then\nafter you challenge a negative thought\nyou want to try to replace the negative\nthought after you challenge each\nindividual negative thought that you\nhave you want to replace them with a\nmore balanced more realistic thought\nthat doesn't contribute to your anxiety\nlevels okay I've got this presentation\ncoming up\nlisten\nall I have to do is prepare you've got\nthis you don't really like public\nspeaking you're not the best at it but\ncould it turn out better than I think\nthat it's going to yes okay instead of\nme failing and looking like an idiot in\nfront of my boss what are some other\nways you know what I'm gonna start just\nstaying positive in myself instead of\nthinking I'm going to fail in front of\nmy boss I'm going to prepare my ass off\nI'm going to turn out really good and\nI'm gonna this is gonna be the best\npresentation I've ever given because I'm\ngoing to prepare so so well for this and\nyou replace the negative thought with a\ndifferent thought that's a more\nrealistic thought because once again 97\nof what you worry about doesn't happen\nthe way that you think it's going to\nhappen so why don't I try to actually\nreplace that negative thought with\nsomething that's more likely to happen\nso that's strategy number two\nwhich then brings us into strategy\nnumber three which I told you is my\nfavorite which is called exposure\ntherapy and so the same way that if\nsomebody is afraid of snakes right like\nthey could be afraid of snakes but an\neasy way easy might not be the best word\nbecause it's not easy for the person an\neasier way to help the person start to\nget past it is to do exposure therapy to\nsee a snake inside of a cage across the\nroom and they can feel the feelings and\ngo okay I'm safe but it's inside of a\ncage it's across the room I'm okay\ncool perfect beautiful and then maybe\nbring the snake a little bit closer\nmaybe a little bit closer and you can\nfeel those\nfeelings of anxiety about the snake but\nstill know that you're safe well so how\ndo we do that if it's not necessarily a\nsnake or Heights and it's really just\nthe anxiety of what might be coming up\nin the future will exposure therapy is a\nproven technique that that allows you to\ngradually and systematically con\nconfront your anxiety your feared\nsituations objects thoughts all of that\nuntil your anxiety starts to subside and\nthe process helps you learn that your\nfears\nfor being real are often really\nirrational they're kind of ridiculous\nsometimes and that really makes you\nunderstand that you can tolerate the\ndiscomfort that comes with the anxiety\nand so here's how you actually start to\nwork through exposure therapy\nthe first thing that you're going to do\nis you're going to identify what is\ncausing your anxiety you're going to\nidentify what's causing your anxiety\njust in identifying what's causing the\nanxiety this alone helps a lot of people\nbecause you can kind of take yourself\nout and go okay\nit's not going to be as bad as I think\nit's going to be a lot of people feel\nanxious but they don't take a step back\nand actually start to find out what\nthey're anxious about and identifying\nyour your anxiety-inducing thoughts can\nhelp you feel less anxious and so you\nknow an easy way to think about it is\nmaybe you're feeling anxious today it's\na Thursday and you're like oh my God I\nfeel so anxious damn I felt so anxious\nall week why have I felt this I haven't\nslept really well I feel like I've been\nanxious why do I feel this way I don't\nknow why I feel this way okay let me\ntake a step back\nwhy do I feel anxious right now\ndo your breathing technique and then you\nrealize through some processing maybe\nthrough some journaling that you felt\nanxious since you've learned that you\nhave to give a presentation for work in\ntwo weeks and maybe you're terrified of\npublic speaking and you're more even\nmore terrified to do it for your company\nright and then what you do is you use\nwhat's called gradual exposure the same\nway that if a snake is across the room\nyou can see it across the room but then\nyou the more that it's around you the\nless you start to fear it and so the\ngradual exposure would be okay you know\nwhat I'm gonna do I know that my\npresentation is in two weeks\nI'm going to finish my presentation as\nquick as I can I'm going to get it done\nas thorough as possible I'm going to\nknow my information in and out and then\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\npractice it out loud at my desk 10 times\nso I'm going to go through and I'm going\nto sit at my desk where I'm safe no one\nelse is around I'm going to practice it\nout loud 10 times maybe it's a 10 minute\npresentation okay it's going to cost you\n100 minutes to do this so you're going\nto just go over it 10 times 10 times\nover and over outside or Out Loud by\nyourself so you feel more safe you're\ngetting more exposed to it then what you\nwould do is get a little bit more\ngradual towards what you're actually\ngoing to be doing then you go into your\nliving room and you practice using your\nTV as the projector\nusing your TV you pull your PowerPoint\nup maybe you have a clicker a remote and\nyou practice it standing up in front of\nthe TV 10 more times now you've already\ndone it 20 times\nyou start to feel more confident with it\nbecause you start to feel more confident\nwhen you feel more prepared and then\nwhat you would do to get a little bit\nmore towards the snake getting close so\nsnake getting closer is you're going to\nstay at work late one night the week\nbefore and you're going to go into the\nroom that you know you're going to be\npresenting at and you're going to\npractice it five to ten more times for\nan hour or two hours after everybody\nleaves you're just gonna say hey boss\nI'm going to stay late I just have I\nwant to work on my presentation you know\nthe boss isn't going to get matchy for\ntrying to practice your presentation and\nto try to get better right\nyou go in there everybody's left there's\nnobody there and you're just like the\nonly person you're standing in the room\nthat you know you're going to be\npresenting at so that you get used to\nthe room you get used to your\nsurroundings you get used to using the\nthe TV in that room you get used to what\nthe conference room looks like and you\ndo the same thing over and over and over\nyou do it five to ten times so by this\ntime you've already you know done the\npresentation 25 to 30 times and then\nyou're going to do the same thing the\nnight before and so the night before the\npresentation so this is a week before\nnow night before the presentation you're\ngoing to stay late again if you really\nwant to get like Hammer this and get it\ndone and then you're going to do it\nanother five to ten times the night\nbefore and then the day of you're going\nto come in early and before anybody else\ndoes so if everyone gets there at nine\nyou're gonna get there at 7 30 and get\nthere at eight and you're gonna practice\nit before anybody else gets there and by\nthe time you actually give that\npresentation you have had so much\nexposure to practicing the presentation\nto standing up to going through the\nPowerPoint\nto being in the room where you're going\nto be doing it and you will notice that\nyou will feel so much less anxious\ntowards the thought of the presentation\nbut you'll also feel so much less\nanxious the day of the presentation and\nso you're going to expose yourself over\nand over and over again to this and\nyou're going to practice relaxation\ntechniques the breathing you're going to\npractice ways to help you get get you\nknow before I go into my presentation\nI'm going to take the 30 minutes before\nI'm going to do some deep breathing I'm\ngonna do those five in 10 out that Rob\nwas talking about I'm going to go\nthrough my presentation again and by\nthat time you've already done the\npresentation\nout loud 30 40 times you've been exposed\nto it and you will go and you will do\nmuch better at it by doing that and so\nthose are some simple simple techniques\nto help you with it also as far as if\nyou feel anxious a lot of times it's not\njust your thoughts it can also come down\nto you know your lifestyle so a few\nthings that really help with anxiety\nregular exercise really helps with\nanxiety if you're exercising 30 minutes\na day your anxiety will be reduced\ndrastically your nutrition really\nmatters you know eating Whole Foods you\nknow try to try to limit or completely\nget rid of eating any processed foods\nlike for me if it comes in a box I don't\neat it it's like 99 of stuff that I eat\ndoes not come from a box and so it's\neither fruits vegetables or meat right\nanother thing that really helps with\nlowering anxiety limit caffeine limit\nsugar some of you guys are like oh my\nGod I can't deal without my coffee well\nyour coffee is actually spiking your\ncortisol levels it's spiking your heart\nrate it's it's making your breathing\nfaster and so if you feel a lot of\nanxiety might be really good to actually\nlimit your caffeine for a week another\nthing that really helps staying hydrated\ndehydration can actually contribute to\nincreasing anxiety levels and other\nthing have some less alcohol don't have\nas much sleep or don't have as much\nalcohol\nand and usually because alcohol just so\nyou know it stays in your system up to\n80 hours so if you can just prioritize\nand and make sure that your lifestyle is\na little bit easier you're getting\nreally good sleep you're eating the\nright food you're working out all of\nthose things really really help and then\nthe last one which is I don't know if\nI'm gonna say the most important one of\nthe most important ones is to limit your\nscreen time looking at your phone can\nreally start to stress you out I realize\nthat with me and this is anecdotal but\nI've also read many articles on it is if\nI look at my phone a lot throughout the\nday I feel way more stressed out\nthroughout the day and so those are\nthree simple techniques that can help\nyou overcome your anxiety that you feel\nand these are all based in in science\nevidence-based these things work for you\nthe first thing is to make sure that you\npay attention to your breathing deep\nbreathing five in 10 out the second\nthing is to actually do the cognitive\nrestructuring which is you know you find\nthe actual thought that is a negative\nthought you challenge the thought and\nthen you replace the thought and the\nlast one is to use exposure therapy so\nyou feel more comfortable from that\nsituation that giving that is giving you\nanxiety every single day and so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode do me a favor\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Jr Rob\nd-i-a-l-j-r once again if you want
