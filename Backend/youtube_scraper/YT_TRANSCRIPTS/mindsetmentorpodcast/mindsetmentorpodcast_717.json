today we're\ngonna be talking about anxiety we're\ngonna be talking about the anxiety that\nyou feel and I'm going to give you four\ndifferent things to think about to help\nyou when you feel a little bit anxious\nit can help you when you feel anxious\nwhen you can when you feel stressed but\nalso it can help you when you're just\nnot feeling great the other day I was\ndriving and I was driving to go to\ndinner and I remember driving and I just\nfelt like it was there I wasn't like\nexcited I wasn't sad I wasn't anxious\nbut I was just like it was like somebody\nhad turned down the uh\nthe uh the color of the world it was\njust kind of like everything was okay it\nwas just kind of there nothing was wrong\nnothing was terrible but the world was\njust kind of black in that moment and\nlike the color had been stripped from\nthe world saturation had been turned\ndown and um I think a lot of times\npeople get anxious people get stressed\nbut then also sometimes we just kind of\nfeel like\nwhatever it's just the way that it is\nand this is life and it doesn't really\nhave any beauty to it and we could get\ndown on ourselves and all that stuff and\nI think a lot of people feel this way\nsometimes and the first thing I want to\nsay\nthere's nothing wrong with feeling that\nway sometimes the the idea that\nsomething is wrong and means that\nsomething must be fixed and that there's\nan issue and\nthe thing I want you to realize is if\nyou feel that way all of the time well\nthen yeah maybe there's something that\nyou should should work on maybe you\nshould talk to a therapist maybe you\nshould hire a coach and all that stuff\nbut if you feel that way sometimes\nthat's okay sometimes that happens and\nso what I'm going to go through today\nare these four different parts just kind\nof help you sit there and self-diagnose\nand\num sometimes when you you notice you\ndon't feel good and then you think about\nnot feeling good you think too much and\nyou actually make yourself feel worse\nbecause you guilt yourself or you shame\nyourself well I shouldn't feel like\nchicks or so many other people have have\nit way worse than I do I'm such a you\nknow POS that I feel this way and people\ncan guilt themselves and shame themself\nand all that stuff but you know I think\nthat really what it comes down to is\nmaybe you can help it can help you\nself-diagnose and get yourself out of a\nrut that you might be in you know and\num you know it turns it could go from I\ndon't feel great turns into there's\nsomething wrong with me turns into I\nneed to fix Texas turns into why does\nthis always happen to me and you get on\nyour head and all of your feels and\nthere becomes a storm and it's like\nwell maybe we could just use this to\nself-diagnose and see if we can help\nourselves get out of it and so here's\nwhat it is\nwhenever you feel anxious or stressed\nor it's just been a blad day\nyou want to go back to this thing called\nhalt h-a-l-t okay and so when I was not\nfeeling great on the way to dinner\nI asked myself this question and I went\nthrough and I went halt halt stands for\nHungry angry lonely tired\nand you might feel one of these things\nbut if you feel all four of them they\ncompound and it becomes very aware and\nvery visceral in your body like\nsomething is not right because you're\nhungry you're angry you're lonely you're\ntired and so let's go through each one\nof these and kind of try to help you\nright if you're hungry\nnow for me just give you an idea like I\ndon't eat a whole lot throughout the day\nsometimes I'll eat breakfast and then\nI'll just literally skip lunch\ncompletely and I don't eat again and you\nknow I eat it maybe like 9 9 30 a.m and\nthen I don't eat until like 6 PM\nsometimes so for me that works pretty\nwell but for some people it doesn't and\nif you have an empty stomach you could\nhave low blood sugar and\num you could feel worse because the fact\nthat you have low blood sugar or it\ncould also be that you have a completely\nfull stomach and it's heavy you need a\nbunch of greasy food and your body needs\nto shut down a lot of other things to\ndigest because digestion is the number\none most energy consuming thing that\nyour body does and so if you're not\nfeeling\ngreat or you feel like or you feel\nanxious or you feel stressed just ask\nyourself\nhow have I been eating today am I hungry\nor did I eat crappy food earlier because\nwhat you eat or don't eat\nwill change the way that you feel\nthroughout the day so the first thing is\nam I hungry think about that one for a\nsecond some of you guys are like yes\nthat's why I feel like today that\nmakes sense\nthat could be a piece of it so hunger is\na piece fit angry\nare you angry at someone or something\nwho is it or what is it are you just\nangry with the state of your life and\nwhat would make you feel different\nsometimes you need to just feel angry\nand there's nothing wrong with it\nsometimes you know like with me in the\ngym like I'll go into the gym and I feel\nfine I feel good Life's good it's okay\nit's it's it's great you know and I'll\ngo to the gym and I will put on some\nhardcore\nrock metal you know I'll put on like\nslip knot or something like that then\nI'll start working out for 30 minutes\nand buy 30 minutes in like some just\nrage comes out of me and I just start\nworking out harder I'm like damn I\ndidn't know that was in there but it\nhelped me get through so sometimes you\njust need to feel angry sometimes you\nneed to release anger that maybe you've\nbeen storing in your body for\na week a year 10 years\nbut sometimes it's been going on too\nlong\nand you're just angry about something\nthat's just perpetuating in your entire\nlife just continues to keep going\nand you just don't want that\ncircumstance anymore and so sometimes\nit's you sometimes it's how you're\nviewing the circumstance sometimes it's\nthe circumstance maybe you're just angry\nis there a way for you to safely get\nthat anger out you know go to a\nkickboxing class go to a boxing class go\nto the gym and get it all out go for a\nrun you know go to your your bedroom\npick up a pillow and beat the out\nof it what do you need to do to try to\nget that out of you so it's this no\nlonger living inside of you maybe you're\nangry next one lonely\nhave you been alone too long you know do\nyou just need to be around some good\npeople\nyou know do you need to be at run some\npeople to make you feel good that are\njust happier\nand I will say this don't be around just\nanyone be careful of who they are\nbecause you know there are batteries in\nthis world there's also vacuums like\nbatteries are the people I'm talking\nabout being around which make you feel\ngood they inspire you and they they give\nyou energy that's why they're called\nbatteries they give you energy from\nbeing around them but there's also\nvacuums those are people that suck the\nenergy from you could spend three\nminutes without minutes you're just\ncompletely drained so just because\nyou're lonely doesn't mean go hang out\nwith some vacuums what I'm saying you're\nalone they go hang on with some\nbatteries some people who give you\nenergy can make you feel good who make\nyou inspired who make you see the light\nat the end of the tunnel and make you\nrealize that there's something to be\nworking for and life is amazing be\naround the right people not just be\naround people right the right people can\nshift your internal energy and make you\nfeel better so when you're lonely can\nyou get around some of those types of\npeople and then last tired finally\npeople are starting to take sleep more\nserious they're starting to actually pay\nattention and really prioritize your\nsleep but I think if we studied how much\npeople sleep we'd realize a lot of\npeople's problems internally\nand externally come down from just lack\nof sleep like I think that if people\ncould fix their lack of sleep and lack\nof hydration a lot of people's problems\nI think would be fixed sleep should be a\npriority for you you know 95 percent of\npeople are assuming 99 of people need at\nleast seven hours of sleep every single\nnight right so I have some friends that\nare just like I don't need more than\nfive hours of sleep and I'm like okay\nmaybe that's true maybe that's just\nsomething that you've put into yourself\nbut you know there's so many studies\nabout how great sleep is there's a great\nyou know there's a the book why we sleep\nyou know there's many podcasts that I\nthink it's uh Matthew something I can't\nremember his last name slips me but um\nhe has he talks about why to sleep and\nsleep's important and all that type of\nstuff and how to be the best sleeper and\num for me I've been going to bed earlier\nand earlier because I actually usually\ntry to get about eight to eight and a\nhalf hours of sleep you know and I like\nto see myself as a guinea pig I try some\nthings out I try six hours a night I've\ntried six and a half hours a night I've\ntried seven hours a night I've tried\neight I've tried nine hours\nusually about seven and a half to eight\nand a half is good for me and so let's\ngo back to what I was talking about\nthere so now that we've gone through\nhungry angry lonely tired let's go back\nto me when I was in the car feeling blah\nI was hungry I was literally on the way\nto dinner right like that's that was the\nbiggest thing for me right I hadn't\neaten very much that day it was 7 P.M I\nprobably must have had low blood sugar I\nwasn't angry I wasn't lonely\nbut I was tired oh man\ndamn it I didn't think about that right\nwe were at my friend's house the night\nbefore for a birthday party and I had to\njump on a 7 A.M call that I couldn't\nmove the next day so normally I would\nhave moved the call to prioritize my\nsleep but for this one I could not move\nthis 7 A.M call so I was at a friend's\nhouse for a birthday party and I had to\nbe up at 7am I didn't get enough sleep\nand so I went through halt hungry angry\nlonely tired and I realized the reason\nwhy I was feeling that way is not\nbecause there was anything wrong with me\nit's not because I'm screwed up it's not\nbecause my life is in shambles it's\nbecause I was hungry\nand I was tired\nman in that moment I went from\nsomething's wrong to oh yeah no big deal\nI'm on my way to dinner right now that's\ngonna make me feel better and then I'll\njust make sure that I go to bed earlier\ntonight and just knowing that that was\nthe way that I felt and why I felt that\nway made me feel way better\nbecause I knew there was some action\nthat I could take I knew there was\nnothing wrong with me I self-diagnosed\nin that moment and I felt better\nimmediately because I didn't think there\nwas something wrong with me and I didn't\nshame myself and guilt myself why do you\nfeel this way you always feel this way\nthis is stupid that you feel this way\nthere's so many people have worse lives\nand you need to be more grateful right\nlike we can go down that but what's cool\nabout is when you know hungry angry\nlonely tired halt\nyou can literally sit there and say okay\nhave I eaten today\nokay am I angry at anybody do I need to\nget around some awesome people do I need\nto get some sleep tonight and you can\nliterally self-diagnose and say oh man\nlike 95 of time you can figure out\nwhat's going on and make yourself feel\nbetter by going okay I know what I need\nto do to make myself feel better right\ncrazy thing ready I had dinner\nfelt a million times better after dinner\nthen when I do I went to bed early\nthat was it woke up felt great the next\nday I was like all right there's nothing\nwrong with me I'm not up and it's\nimportant to know why you feel the way\nthat you feel but a lot of times we get\nso caught up in\nthinking too much and then creating a\nstory or a narrative that sometimes make\nus makes us feel worse about ourselves\nand then we start to shame ourselves and\nguilt ourselves which makes me feel even\nmakes us feel even worse about ourselves\nit's important to be like hey let me\ntake a step back let me look at myself\nas if you know someone comes to me\nsomeone that I am in charge of taking\ncare of and says I don't feel good I'm\nnot going to be like well of course you\ndon't feel good it's because you're\nstupid it's because you're you know\nyou've done this today\nyou always feel this way you're why you\ndo this way and then it just like start\nto yell at them you're gonna be like\nokay well you know why do you feel that\nway how's your day been so far are you\nhungry are you angry alone are you tired\nand literally help that person you\nwouldn't yell at them you wouldn't guilt\nthem you wouldn't shame them it's\nimportant to talk to yourself the way\nthat you talk to someone that you love\nit's important to take care of yourself\nas if you are someone that you're given\nthe only you're the only person in\ncharge of taking care of this person and\nit is your job to take care of them and\nyour brain and body have a connection so\nif you start to think there's something\nwrong with you then you start to feel\nlike maybe there is something wrong with\nyou and you start to your body starts to\ntalk back to your brain your brains like\nyour body's like something's wrong your\nbrain's like something's wrong and then\nit starts to get worse and worse no\nlet's just let's just take ourselves out\nof our body for a second when you're in\nthe jar you can't read the label let's\ntake ourselves out of the jar let's look\nat the label of okay Rob dial he doesn't\nfeel amazing right now he feels very\nblah what's going on with him what's\nbeen going on this day has he got enough\nwater today did he get enough sleep last\nnight is he hungry oh is that little boy\nangry oh is he lonely he's been around\nhe's been to by himself too much today\nand so it's literally like taking\nyourself out of your body\nand looking at yourself and trying to\nhelp as if it is a friend that you're\ntrying to help versus guilting shaming\nall that type of stuff and an easy way\nto try to help yourself self-diagnose it\ndoesn't fix everything in life I promise\nyou that you just ask yourself am I\nhungry am I angry am I lonely and not\ntired and the more of those that you\nhave if you have all four of them it\ncould feel like a show\nthen what you do is you start to work\nthrough them and try to make yourself\nfeel better so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in at Rob\ndial Junior Rob d-i-a-l-j-r and
