    "transcript": "almost everybody's a narcissist that's\nthe crazy part about it there's a a term\ncalled conversational narcissist that\nwas coined by a sociologist uh named\nCharles duber A conversational\nnarcissist is a person who consistently\nturns the focus of conversations towards\nthemselves and their experiences making\nthe other person feel as if they were\njust unheard because they failed to give\nany consideration or response to the\nother person's experiences or the other\nperson's feelings so this over time\nreally starts to undermine the\nexperiences of other people in\nconversation with them and so if you\nreally want to be a great\nconversationalist and you don't want to\nbe a conversational narcissist remember\nthis try to seek to hear more than you\nactually want to be heard"
