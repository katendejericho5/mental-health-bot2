    "transcript": "so here's a really really simple\nstrategy to be successful write down all\nof your goals reason why I say that is\nbecause Harvard did a study in the 1970s\nwith all of their graduating class and\nfound out that only three percent of\nthose students who were graduating wrote\ndown their goals but 10 years later they\nfollowed up with all of those students\nand found out that the three percent\nthat wrote down their goals were more\nthan 10 times more successful than the\nentire 97 percent combined that didn't\nwrite down their goals and so that\nbrings the question why is that well\nbecause when you write down your goals\nit makes them real it makes them\nphysically exist in this world and when\nit's on paper it makes it so much easier\nto be planned so if somebody wants to be\nreally successful it's real simple just\nstart by writing down your goals"
