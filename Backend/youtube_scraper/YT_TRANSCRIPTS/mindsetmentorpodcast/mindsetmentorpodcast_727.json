    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nsetting boundaries in all of your\nrelationships with other people but also\nwith yourself and we're going to give go\nover three different steps to setting\nyour boundaries okay and in all\nrelationships if we're not paying\nattention sometimes we can feel like\nthere's tension in a relationship\num simply because a lot of times I've\nfound that people don't set boundaries\nso it's like you know you've been in a\nrelationship with your parents your\nentire life\nhas it ever occurred to you but that\nmaybe you guys should set boundaries\nwith each other because there's ways\nthat maybe you're stepping on their toes\nmaybe you're going further than you need\nto in certain ways in intruding but\nmaybe they're also doing the same you\nknow when you look at all of your\nrelationships you look at your romantic\nrelationship you look at your parental\nrelationships your siblings your family\nyour friendships all of them should have\nsome boundaries and a lot of times we\ndon't get really clear on what our\nboundaries are and to be honest with you\na lot of times we don't get clear on\nwhat we want our boundaries to be of\nwhat we feel is acceptable and\nunacceptable and after a while what\nhappens is people tend to step on the\nboundaries that we can feel\nbut we haven't necessarily set in stone\nand so most people have never really\nbeen taught boundaries or what they are\nthey just feel like they're being\ncrossed right and so when you have that\nin a relationship it can cause extreme\nturmoil with someone that you love and\nif it's someone that you love\nthat's not what you want you don't want\nto not want to answer the phone when\nthey call you don't want to try to avoid\nthem you don't want to feel feelings of\nlike\nno I don't want to talk to this person\nand so when you don't set boundaries a\nlot of times people can accidentally\nbecause it hasn't been clearly\ncommunicated over step boundaries\nbecause you haven't really gotten clear\non what those are and sometimes it could\nbe extreme turmoil sometimes\nif I'm being honest it can just be like\na low-grade resistance towards somebody\nright like I can think of I can always\ntell that my boundaries are being\nstepped on was by somebody because they\ncall me and I'm like\nI don't really feel like answer the\nphone right you can do what I'm talking\nabout where you like ah\nyeah I don't need that right now and you\nknow you know what I'm talking about\nright and so what is what are the\nboundaries that we really want to set\nand boundaries basically the way that I\nsee them are limits of how we want to\nsee and experience ourselves and other\npeople in the relationships that we're\nin and these are important because\nbefore we go into any relationship\nthe most important relationship that you\nhave is a relationship with yourself and\nso I get a lot of messages on my\nInstagram if you follow me on Instagram\nif you don't it's Rob dial Junior Rob i\na l j r but I get a lot of messages on\nInstagram where people are talking about\noh you know what like I really love my\nsister\num but they are stepping all over me or\nthey intrude or they feel like they have\na say in what I should do in my life a\nlot of times this is with parents more\nthan anything else I see this all of the\ntime of parents just freaking over\nstepping boundaries but the reason why\nis because the person never actually set\na boundary it's like they feel\nthe relationship kind of wonky but it's\nlike you gotta clearly communicate that\nand so I know a lot of people reach out\nto me that's probably the most common\nas as far as overstepping boundaries as\nparents and if I'm being fully\ntransparent it's usually mothers\noverstepping their boundaries that's the\none I hear a lot\nand what people tend to do is a lot of\npeople are people Pleasers I get a lot\nof messages that are people Pleasers and\nthey're afraid to speak up for\nthemselves they're afraid to speak up\nfor themselves in a relationship with\nsomeone else you know they're like I\nwould rather not say that to my parents\nbecause if I say this to my parents it\ncould cause disruption and then it's\neasier just not to deal with than to\ndeal with you know so they have they\nhave issues sometimes with their parents\nsometimes they have issues with their\nsiblings they have issues with their\nfriends with their partners and a lot of\npeople have issues like I said with\ntheir parents and also a lot of people\nwho have older children have issues with\ntheir children in they're really big\nones right and so when we look at how we\nare in all those relationships the first\nthing we've got to ask ourselves is like\nwhat are the boundaries that I have for\nmyself in these relationships how I'm\ngoing to show up\nbut also what is a boundary for me\nspecifically so like\na lot of people have children that are\nout there and many people lose\nthemselves as a a human as a sovereign\nhuman\ninto being a parent and this is why a\nlot of parents feel lost when their\nchildren end up finally leaving the\nhouse and they end up resenting them in\nsome sort of way because they're they\nthey don't know who they are anymore\nwithout being a parent right like I've\nseen a lot of messages about that and so\nbefore we start talking about other\npeople and how we want them to show up\nin a relationship we need to start\nasking how we want to show up in a\nrelationship and what are our boundaries\nas far as like who we are with ourselves\nin the relationship that we have with\nourselves because as much as you have\nrelationship with someone else you have\na relationship with yourself that you\ndeal with every single day all day long\nand with yourself I'm just going to say\nthis out loud and some people are going\nto hate this you should never put anyone\nelse above you\nnow immediately I'm triggering some\npeople that are parents out there some\npeople that have spouses out there and\nthey're like no no no like I put my\nchildren above everything else in my\nlife and I'm I respect that and that is\nbeautiful but the better that you are\nthe better that they become\nthe better that you are as a person the\nmore that you put yourself above\neverybody else the more that you become\nbetter to then impact those people and a\nlot of people lose themselves in being a\nparent a lot of people lose themselves\nin relationships and some of you may\nhave lost yourself\nand that's not terrible because in order\nto find yourself you need to lose\nyourself sometimes a couple weeks ago I\ndid an episode on on why I think it is\nimportant to lose yourself because you\ncan't find who you are unless you find\nout who you're not and so sometimes this\nis important\nbut you have to put yourself above\neverybody everybody else when you put\nyourself above everybody everybody else\nyou then prioritize how you show up in\nall those relationships and how you show\nup in all those relationships become\nbetter for everyone that you're in a\nrelationship with so\nI'm just going to say it you have to be\nfull of yourself\nyou have to love yourself you have to\nthink you're the best thing since sliced\nbread I had a um I had a friend a mentor\nof mine I was at an event that he was\nrunning and a lady stood up and she\nasked a question she's like hey I love\nwhat you're saying but\nlike\nit makes you sound kind of full of\nyourself\nlike what you're saying sounds great\nlike all of these things but it makes\nyou sound full of yourself and he looks\nher dead in the eye and he goes who the\n should I be full of\nif I'm not full of myself why should I\nbe full of anybody else and I'm not\nsaying like narcissistic ways where it's\nlike\nI'm going to put myself above everybody\nelse and I'm going to make sure\neverybody else fails as I put myself on\na pedestal it's like no I know that when\nI prioritize myself and the boundaries\nthat I have then I show up better in\nthese relationships in me prioritizing\nmyself is actually also\nprioritizing those other people as well\nbecause when I'm better they're better\nwhat I'm saying is you need to take care\nof yourself better you can't pour from\nan empty cup you can't just think that\nyou can just just help everybody else\nall the time if you're not helping\nyourself and so I'm going to say it if\npeople are afraid to say it canceling\nplans sometimes not the day of but like\na couple days ahead because you need to\nprioritize yourself maybe you need to\nread maybe you need to just meditate\nmaybe you just need some time alone you\nneed to slow down things been really\nbusy at work canceling plans\nis okay now don't be the person who\nhandles 15 minutes before because that's\na shitty thing to do but canceling plans\nbecause you want to prioritize yourself\nis okay\nyou know skipping a party to go to the\ngym is okay staying at home to cook is\nokay like let's encourage people to\nprioritize themselves more to respect\nthemselves more to develop a greater\nself improvement\npractice to self have more self-love\nlike let's encourage that\ndon't do it all the time don't think\nthat you just don't hang out with\nanybody and you just prioritize yourself\nand you just cancel all of your plans\nyou never see anybody and you become a\nHermit don't do that all the time but if\nit feels like you know what I really\nneed time with myself I really need time\nwith myself to work on myself to learn\nto grow to improve maybe just have some\n silence\ndo it it's okay I am giving you\npermission\nI'm giving you permission to do it\nright and so I've been through it before\nlike I've been through not sending\nboundaries myself like my first company\nthat I owned I worked 110 hours a week\nfor three years straight and I ran\nmyself into the ground and I prioritized\nmy business over myself\nand sometimes you need to set boundaries\nwith yourself taking days off scheduling\nfree days scheduling your work time all\nof that be careful don't run from your\nbusiness and don't do what you're not\nsupposed to do and call it a quote\nunquote self-care day but you have to\nstart to develop some boundaries\nand then what you do is after you\ndevelop boundaries with yourself now\nyou've got to start looking at all of\nyour relationships and you ask yourself\nwhat do I want this relationship to look\nlike\nthis relationship with my spouse what do\nI want my relationship to look like okay\nthere's a lot of people that I know and\nI get a lot of message on this one right\nlike the way that some people say like\nmy husband talks down to me like he\nwants to do XYZ he wants me to be this\nway and he talks down to me in many\ndifferent ways and they just take it and\ntake it and take it and take it and take\nit and then becomes too much right and\nso like can you set boundaries in the\nway that you want your spouse to speak\nwith you and the way that you show up\nfor each other and mind you it is always\na two-way street it's not just like I'm\ngoing to tell them what to do it's also\nlike you need to tell yourself what to\ndo in the relationship as well and see\nwhat they want like they need really\nthey need boundaries for you in the\nrelationship right and so it's like your\nspouse your children your parents your\nfamily your co-workers your employees\nlike you need to set boundaries in what\nthese relationships are going to look\nlike and so once again first off you\nstart with yourself and you start\nsetting boundaries for yourself and\ngetting very clear on that and then you\ngo after internal you go external and\nstart sending boundaries with other\npeople so let's go through the three\nsteps\nof actually setting boundaries okay\nnumber one is you have to decide what\nyou want like\nwhat do you want there's so many times\nwhere\npeople reach out to me all of the time\nand I'm like they're like tell me their\nlife story and I'm like what do you want\nthey're like I don't know not what do\nyou want from me but like what do you\nwant in your life and they're like I\ndon't know what I want in my life I'm\nlike well that's a pretty good place to\nstart most people know what they don't\nwant but they have no clue what they\nwant like if you were to build a perfect\nrelationship with this person what would\nit look like\nwhat would that look like\nhow do you want to feel in that\nrelationship how do you want to show up\nin that relationship how do you want\nthem to feel in the relationship with\nyou how do you want them to show up in\nthe relationship\nand then you be clear and communicate\nwith them in a nice way you know some\npeople might have resistance it might\nbring up resistance side of them I start\nto feel triggered but it's it's about\nclearly communicating how you feel\nand one of the things that's important I\nsay this all the time to people is you\nteach people how to talk to you and how\nto treat you\nyou teach them that through how through\nthrough the boundaries that you do or do\nnot set you know what you deem\nacceptable and unacceptable all of those\nthings you teach people how to talk to\nyou you teach people how to treat you\nyou can explicitly talk to them and also\nyou know what they can see in your your\nnon-verbals of what is acceptable right\nso you've got to figure out what do you\nwant that's the first thing number two\nwhich is the hardest part for everybody\nis you have to communicate it all right\nit might be hard it is 100 necessary\ntake all of the blame if necessary\ntake all of the blame\nand like one of the things that I hear\nfrom people is like oh yeah I work from\nhome now because of all the stuff that\nhappened with covet and now I'm remote\nnow my mom calls me at three o'clock on\na Tuesday when I'm working and she's\nlike hey can you go pick up my laundry\nright it's like listen\nI'm sorry Mom I love you I can't go pick\nup your dry cleaning I work for Google\nand I work in for Google until 5 PM\nthere's nothing that I can do right now\nand so you can start to actually take\nthe blame if you want to like listen I\ncan't I wish that I could but I can't do\nthis right now\nyou know uh I don't want you to call me\nand tell me about the negativity that\nyou saw in the news mom\nI don't clearly communicate with them\nI'm working I can't go pick up your\nstuff I'm trying to look at the bright\nside of things I love you but I don't\nwant to hear you complain all the time\nyou know I don't want you to call me and\ntell me about all of the negative stuff\nthat's going on in all of your friends\nrelationships and try to gossip with me\nbecause it doesn't make me feel good\nright some of you guys a lot of people\nmight be afraid to have these\nconversations because you're afraid that\nyou're going to make the other person\nmad so let me give you a secret on that\nit's called disarming so if you're about\nto have a clear\npossibly triggering conversation with\nsomebody the first thing you always want\nto do is disarm the person you want to\ndisarm them and the way that you disarm\nthem is by starting the conversation\nlike this you say Hey listen can I talk\nto you about something and they're like\nsure before I do\nif I'm if I can be honest like I'm\nactually afraid of telling you this and\nI'm afraid of how you might possibly\nreact\nso do I have permission to just like\nspeak from my heart and not be judged\nand they're like yeah of course of\ncourse you do that's how everyone's\nresponding oh yeah of course you can\nright and what you do is you you're\nhonest with them about how you feel and\nthat you might be nervous you might be\nscared all about stuff and then you ask\ndo I have permission\ndo I have permission to speak from our\nheart to be honest with you and just not\nbe judged because I'm just nervous about\nhow you might take it oh my God yeah of\ncourse you can right when someone says\nyes when you say do I have permission\nthey say yes they feel like it is them\nasking you for you to say it to them\nwhich usually puts their guard down and\nallows them to just kind of\njust feel into it and not feel triggered\nright and so usually disarming is the\neasiest way to do it if that's what\nyou're looking for but you have to have\nto have to clearly communicate it so\nthat's number two in Step number three\nis you have to stay firm\nyou got to stay firm\nbuild awareness and notice when you fall\nback into bad habits it takes awareness\nit takes tough love don't beat yourself\nup over it but when someone starts to\nintrude on those boundaries\nand you're noticing it because it's just\nto have that's what they're used to your\nmom calls you back up again and starts\nto tell you about all the negative stuff\nin the news it's like Mom do you\nremember our conversation\nyes but I have to tell you this thing no\nno mama listen I I understand that you\nwant to talk to somebody about this\ncrazy that's been happening on the\nnews\nbut I don't want to hear it I'm trying\nto keep the news I'm off trying to keep\nnegativity out of my life\nso can you please stop calling me with\nnegativity\nI don't know how she's going to react\nbut you are finally standing up for\nyourself and you're staying firm because\npeople are going to keep testing your\nboundaries that's what people do they\njust test and they test and see how far\nthey can get no no you're going to stay\nfirm and you're going to actually do\nexactly what you say you're going to do\nwhen people start you know intruding on\nyour boundaries again nope hey sorry\nremember the conversation that we had\nI'm not gonna do this anymore so you\nhave to stay firm so number one is you\nhave to figure out what it is that you\nactually want decide number two you have\nto clearly communicate it with them\nnumber three is you have to stay firm on\nthose boundaries so that's what I got\nfor you for today's
