    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow to build a life that you love and\nwhen I look around my life\nif I'm being honest with you I\nlove it and the reason why I know that I\nlove it is because I built my life and I\nbecame very intentional one day because\none day I woke up and I realized that I\ndidn't love my life there was a time\nback in about 2014 where I was actually\nkind of starting to get depressed and\nstarting to feel like and starting\nto feel like my life had no purpose and\nI was going nowhere and it wasn't\nexciting to me anymore and I was like I\ncan't do this any longer like I can't if\nI fast forward 20 years from where I am\ntoday I don't if I'm this unhappy with\nmy life in 20 years\nit's gonna be terrible I don't want to\nknow where I am and so for me I was able\nto through a lot of work every single\nmorning working and journaling and\ntrying to figure myself out and trying\nto figure out what the hell I wanted and\nmeditating on it and reading books and\nall this stuff I was able to find what I\nfeel is my purpose which is what I do\nnow and like for me I absolutely love\nwhat I do I absolutely love my life\nso why don't more people love their\nlives why are a lot of people that we\nsee on the world like\nnot really content they're iconic intent\nright but a lot of people are content\nbut like slightly aggravated by the life\nI've got a decent job\nI kind of like what I'm doing I kind of\nenjoy my life but everything's it's\npretty good right I don't know about you\nbut I don't want to live a life that's\njust pretty good like I don't if I'm\ngonna be here for hopefully a hundred\nyears I don't want 100 Years of like\npretty good I guess like I don't know\nabout you but I want to have a life\nthat's filled with stuff that I love\nlike that I actually love and really\nwhat I want to do I don't want to do\nanything in my life that I'm not in love\nwith I don't want to be\npissed off that I have to go to a job\nthat I don't like I want to be excited\nevery moment of my life as much as I\npossibly can be at least and I think it\ncomes down to building it it comes down\nto being intentional you know if you're\ngoing to build a house you don't just\nstart throwing bricks everywhere you\nhave to build out the actual blueprint\nof what you want it to look like so\nbefore you start building your life\nwhich we've all been building our lives\nkind of unintentionally most of us and\nat some point you gotta take a step back\nand journal through it and be like what\ndo I want what do I want my life to look\nlike what do my business look my bank\naccount my my family every single aspect\nof it what do I want it to look like and\nmake the blueprint of it before you\nstart actually building it and so I want\nto tell you exactly how I kind of did it\nand hopefully it'll help you be able to\ndo it as well and it all goes back to\nreally I would say about 2012. 2012 for\nme was it was a big pivotal pivotal\npivotal not pivotable pivotal year for\nme because what I did was I quit a job\nuh that I was working I saved up for an\nentire year and\num\nfilm being honestly it actually started\nin 2011. I can take you to an exact\nmoment my cousin Jason and I were having\na conversation in 2011 on Mother's day\nwe were at my aunt's house his mother's\nhouse and he was like how's life man\nhow's everything going and you know he's\nabout 16 years older than me and I've\nalways looked up to him and he's like\nhow's life and I was like oh it's pretty\ngood he's like how's your new job and I\nwas like you know that's pretty good he\ngoes do you love it and I go no and he\ngoes so why don't you quit I was like\nwhat he's like why are you just wasting\nyour life doing something that you don't\nlove like what do you want to do\nI was like I don't know man he's like\nhave you ever thought of traveling and I\nwas like no that sounds pretty awesome I\nlove to travel like I love traveling and\nhe's a you know a very successful guy so\nI really look up to what he says he goes\nwhy don't you just quit your job and go\ntravel in Europe and I was like the hell\nare you talking about I was like that's\nthat's kind of crazy he goes listen when\nI was younger I quit my job and I went\nand traveled Europe and ended up staying\nthere for a couple years because of the\npeople I've met and I've you know fell\nin love with the people that were out\nthere and I fell in love with where I\nwas and lived in France he lived in all\nthese different places and he was like\nwhy don't you just quit your job and\ntravel and I was like\nsomething about that question feels\nright like then it feels like yes\nthis is what I need to do and it was\nliterally that moment I was like you\nknow what Jason I am going to quit my\njob I'm gonna give myself a year to save\nup\nand I'm gonna go travel and so for the\nnext year I planned out I wanted to go\nthis place in this place in this place\nso fast forward I saved up for an entire\nyear the job I was working at and in\n2012 I went and traveled for three\nmonths I backpacked Europe all by myself\nwent to 25 different cities I think it\nwas like 11 different countries went all\nover the place and so what I realized\nwas I actually love traveling like it is\nsomething that is deeply ingrained in me\nand when you work for somebody else it's\nreally hard to travel sometimes you know\nit depends on the job you have but it's\nhard to travel for me it's like\nsomething that I want to be able to\nleave and go for months at a time and so\nwhen I came back I actually moved from\nTampa the time after I went in in 2012 I\nmoved from Tampa to Austin Texas and so\nI moved to Austin where I am now I've\nbeen here for over 10 years now and I\nrealized that that traveling had to be a\npart of my life it had to be something\nthat I did it couldn't just be something\nthat I did two weeks out of the year and\nso what I did was I started to build and\nfigure out okay well that means I need\nto figure out a way to make money online\nI need to figure out a way to make money\nonline but I don't want to just sell\n online like I want to do something\nI'm passionate about what am I\npassionate about I started actually\njournaling through becoming very clear\nand starting to work through what I was\npassionate about what I wanted my life\nto look like\nand I became very intentional which is\nthe most important part once it became\nintentional I started trying to build it\nI put the blueprint out on a piece of\npaper\nJournal through the entire thing and\nthen after I put the blueprint onto a\npiece of paper then I started to\nactually build it and so\nnow when I look at it it's like you know\nI travel at least a couple months every\nsingle year I'm able to run my business\nfrom anywhere in the world you know back\nin 2017 my girlfriend at the time my\nwife now we traveled for six months we\nwent all over all over to Europe and\nSoutheast Asia and Dubai and all kinds\nof different places in Bali and it was\nonly because I was intentional with what\nI wanted in my life and I'm going to say\nsomething that might surprise some\npeople out there the life that you want\nthe life that you love doesn't just\nhappen it doesn't fall in your lap and\nyou don't have to you're not just going\nto wake up one day and your life is just\nperfect it is exactly what you want in\nyour life that's that's not going to\nhappen and I feel like a lot of people\nif I'm being fully honest I've been\nthinking about this a lot lately\nI actually put an Instagram story on\nthis the other day when I was just\nsitting around drinking my coffee\nthinking about it\nbut a lot of people\nreally I feel like they live their life\nas if it's just gonna fall in their lap\nand someone's gonna come and save them\nno one is going to come and save you no\none's going to build your life for you\nno one's going to make the plans for you\nno one's going to take out the things\nthat you need to take out and bring in\nthe things that you need to bring in you\ndon't just wake up and it's perfect it\nis built it is built intentionally\nmeticulously and being very clear on\nwhat it is that you want what it is that\nyou don't want what you're going to say\nyes to and what you're going to say no\nto you have to plan it you have to write\nit down on paper you have to check that\nplan every single day and you have to\nexecute every single day\nbut you got to journal through and put\non paper one of my one of my friends who\nis a extremely successful guy he's worth\nover 100 million dollars he's like 45\nyears old\nit's the craziest thing we go and get\ncoffee every once while and every single\ntime we go and get coffee he brings his\njournal with him everywhere this guy's\nworth over 100 million dollars\nand he brings his journal with his goals\neverywhere he reviews his goals every\nsingle morning and he has built a life\nmeticulously step by step by step by\njournaling it all out figuring out what\nhe wants what he doesn't want and\nexactly how he's going to get there\nbecause everything in your life is\nchangeable like you are not stuck you\nmight feel like you're stuck sometimes\nbut you're not stuck where you live\nisn't stuck\nyou know every aspect of it what you do\nfor for your life the way that you think\nabout yourself all of that\nyou're not stuck\nwhat if you made a list of everything\nthat you love in your life and\neverything that needs to change and you\nwent through every single aspect of your\nlife very granularly which is we're\ngonna what we're going to do in just a\nminute\nso you can go ahead and grab your\nJournal if you want to\neverything that you love and you want\nmore of or everything that you love and\nyou don't have and you want in your life\nand everything that needs to change\nand we're going to go through it okay so\nlet's just go ahead and do it together\nyou can pause me if you want to we're\ngoing to actually start to work together\nokay\nfirst question\nyour significant other what do you love\nabout them\nwhat needs to change and you can pause\nme and you say these are all the things\nthat I love about them these are the\nthings that I feel need to change this\nneeds to change this needs to change\nthis is how I need to change in the\nrelationship in order for them to change\nyou know so think about that with your\nsignificant other\nwhat do you love about them what needs\nto change when you look at all of your\nfriends and

your mindset what do you love\nabout your mindset\nwhat needs to change in your mindset\nokay what do you love about your morning\nroutine\nwhat do you love about it what needs to\nchange your morning routine how can you\nget it better what do you love about\nyour Fitness routine what needs to\nchange your Fitness routine what do you\nlove about the food that you eat what\nneeds to change in the food that you eat\nright\nand from the moment that you wake up\nevery single morning you focus on how\nyou can make everything the way that you\nwant it think about everything that you\ndo think about you know the the second\nthat you wake up in the morning to the\nsecond that you go to bed at night and\nthink about every single thing that you\ndo don't do all of that stuff anything\nabout everything everyone every action\nevery thought everything that goes\nthrough your head and write it all down\nand say what do I love and What needs to\nchange\nand realize that you might have a pretty\ndecent life right now it might be okay\nbut damn it you know it could be way\nbetter what do you need to do to make it\nbetter let's make a plan a lot of people\ndon't know what they want they know what\nthey they kind of have an idea like a oh\nI wish my life was kind of better I wish\nI was kind of more fit I wish I had a\nlittle bit more money I wish I could\nmaybe travel a little bit more but like\nnot very meticulously clear on exactly\nwhat it is that they want\nnow realize changes are going to take\ntime you're not going to be able to make\nthis massive list of all the things that\nwe just talked about and just\nimmediately implementing your life can\nbe changed right but now we can start to\nmake a transition plan for how you can\ntransition into this life\nyou know but if I told you like it may\nnot might not happen the next six months\nbut if I told you in the next six years\nlet's say 10 years eight years you could\nhave the perfect life would that excite\nyou\nhell yeah what excites you it's fully\npossible but it's going to take you to\ndo it it's going to take your time your\nattention your work it won't just happen\nyou have to treat your life like a\nbusiness\nyou know when you go into a business we\nhave a business we have a business plan\nwhat my business does what we do what we\ndon't do all that stuff we have\nquarterly reviews we have weekly\nmeetings and we have morning huddles and\nit blows my mind how many people take\ntheir jobs more seriously they take\ntheir lives like you if you are on an\nadvertise in an advertising company\nright you have a plan of exactly what\nwhat the advertising company is going to\ndo you have quarterly reviews you know\nkpis that you have to hit weekly\nmeetings you have so many damn meetings\nwith your team every single day and\nhuddles and you take that seriously\nyou're trying to hit all these things\nthat you know you want to hit on a\nquarterly weekly yearly basis\non all of those basis you're trying to\nhit all of those right\nbut you're not planning out your own\nlife like you're taking somebody else's\nbusiness more serious with more\nintention with more planning with more\naction than your own life\nsome people take their job more serious\nthan they do a lot actually a lot of\npeople take their their jobs more\nseriously they do their lives all of\nthis stuff that I'm going over with you\nis not it's not rocket science let's be\nreal like I'm not I'm not going to win\nlike a Nobel Prize for this\ngroundbreaking discovery that I found\nand I'm teaching to you guys\nit's not\ncrazy hard to do it's very simple but it\ntakes time\nand it takes planning it out and it\ntakes working for it and reviewing it\noften and making little tiny adjustments\nbut it's your life it should be\nimportant\nshouldn't this thing that you're doing\nbe taken more serious than anything else\nshouldn't your life be taken more\nserious than anything else that you do\nabsolutely\nso why don't you start showing up more\ngetting very detailed putting out the\nblueprint of your entire life and what\nyou want it to look like and then seeing\nwhat you love what you don't love and\nWhat needs to change and you start\nfiguring that out and you look at it\nevery single morning and start making\nadjustments and adjustments and more\nadjustments and more adjustments and you\nfast forward 10 years from now and you\nlook around you're like whoa\nthis is amazing this is way different\nthan it was before that is how you build\na life that you love it takes planning\nit takes time it takes attention and it\ntakes daily work to make little tiny\nmicro adjustments to create the life\nthat you want\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you
