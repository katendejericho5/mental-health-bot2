    "transcript": "I remember nine years old having to walk\nhome in the dark when it was raining\nbecause my father didn't come and pick\nme up but I share all of that on my\npodcast why because how many other\npeople are feeling the exact same way\nhow many people in this room have a\nwounded father Story how many people\nconnected with what I just said in some\nsort of way and so to not share your\ntrue authentic self in some form we're\njust using social media you can use\npodcasting all that stuff if you want to\nnumber one it's holding back from people\nfeeling seen like oh my gosh this\nperson's been through this and look at\nwhere they are now and number two it's\nalso holding you back from healing part\nto be that you haven't healed because\nshame breeds in the dark stop keeping it\nin the dark"
