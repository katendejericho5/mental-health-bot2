    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nyour goals and I'm going to be talking\nto you about the problem with your goals\nI'm going to tell you why it is so hard\nfor you to hit your goals for you to\nstay consistent in taking the right\naction hitting your goals and I'm also\ngoing to give you a hack in your brain\nto help you make it easier to hit your\ngoals and let's talk about goals for\ninstance right I could sit down and I\ncould say hey\nlet's come up with your 10-year plan\nwhere do you want to be in 10 years what\ndo you want to have in 10 years what do\nyou want your family to look like what\ndo you want your happiness to look like\nwhere do you want to have traveled to\nhow much money do you have\nwhat kind of house do you have what kind\nof cars do you have and it can be\nexciting in the moment but then after\nyou get done planning one thing that\nhappens with a lot of people\nit can become paralysis by analysis\nbecause you start thinking here I am\ntoday and that's where I want to be in\n10 years and your mind can immediately\ngo to processes and all of the things\nthat you need to get done in order to\nget there and it can seem so far away\nthat sometimes it could actually be\ndemotivating this is something I've\nlearned over years and years of working\nwith people I thought that hey when you\ncreate a 10-year goal you're excited and\nthen you work your ass off to get there\nright and you're all fired up that\nyou're going to be there and then you\nwake up the next day and you start\nthinking about how long this journey is\nthis journey of a Thousand Miles this\njourney of 10 years to get you where you\nwant to go in the thought of how many\nthings need to be done\nin order to get you there can actually\nstop you from taking action and so\nreally what it comes down to is we're\nfocusing too much on the outcome and\neverything that needs to be able to get\nthere over the next 10 years like what\nwe have to do every single day over the\nnext 3650 days and it's like man that's\na lot of things when really we should be\nfocusing on the process and so that's\nwhat we're going to be diving into today\nis the process instead of the outcome\nbecause we all want the outcome we all\nwant the goals we all want the money we\nall want the successful business the\ngreat relationship the incredible\nchildren that we've re that we've we've\nbeen able to grow and help and\ncreate into these great humans\nwe all want those things we want the\ngoals but what we need to focus on is we\nneed to focus on the process we need to\nfocus on what it is that we need to do\nevery single day and not just every\nsingle day each moment What's the best\nthing for me to do right now\nand so most goals are focused on what I\nlike to call results-based goals we're\nfocusing on the result that we want well\nwe're going to talk about today is the\nbenefit of having action-based goals\nhaving daily action-based goals right so\nresults-based goals would be like I want\nto lose 10 pounds and then I'll be where\nI want to be right I want to make I want\nto hit a million dollars in Revenue in\nmy business and then I'll be where I\nwant to be\nand those are great those are those are\nresults-based goals and I think that\nthey are important to create but then\nafter you create them you actually\ntransition into creating from your\nresults-based goals action-based goals\nwhat action do I need to do today in\norder to be in alignment with where I\nwant to go what do I need to do today\njust focusing on today\neven just the next hour in order to get\nme to where I want to go and then we\nwant to act in alignment with a type of\nperson that we want to be the type of\nperson that we want to show up as every\nsingle day you want your actions to\nreflect the type of person that you want\nto become and so what you do is you\nactually focus on just today\nand then what you do is you develop\nsomething called a dopamine reward\nsystem so what is dopamine right so\ndopamine most people think that dopamine\nis like the feel-good chemical in your\nbrain and it does feel good but that's\nmore of a serotonin thing when you look\nat dopamine dopamine is the chemical of\nmotivation dopamine is a very external\nbase chemical serotonin is a chemical of\nhere and now and everything's peachy and\neverything's beautiful gratitude\ngrateful for what you have dopamine is\nthe chemical of motivation dopamine is a\nchemical of more I want more I did this\nthing and I want more of it it's the\nchemical that's released also when you\nget really excited about something or\nyou're celebrating something and the\nbest part about dopamine it is\ncompletely subjective which means that\nyou can literally be in this moment\nright now\nand you can just decide you know what\nI'm going to try to feel my my body up\nwith as many good feelings as possible\nthink about how how amazing my life is\nthink about how amazing these challenges\nhave come in my life have helped me get\nbetter and we can actually celebrate\nanything that we want to make ourselves\nfeel good release dopamine and when we\nrelease dopamine because it's chemical\nof more our brain will actually want\nmore of it\nwhat's the most common trait of the\ngreatest Achievers in our lives when you\nlook at people like Michael Jordan look\nat Kobe Bryant you look at the greatest\nCEOs that are that are out there some\nmight say hard work dedication Obsession\nand that's all correct but there's a\nsecret behind all of it all of those\nthings are true they are really hard\nworkers they are extremely dedicated\nthey are obsessed with what they do but\nthere's something underlying\nthey most of them fell in love with the\nprocess they fell in love with the\nprocess and most of them whether they\nrealize or not probably created a\ndopamine reward system\nI don't know if they meant to do it but\nthey probably did it this is why you see\nsomebody like I always hear people that\nare like oh well if somebody's a\nbillionaire or they're a millionaire and\nthey could retire why don't they just\nretire and just enjoy the rest of their\nlives because they've actually fallen in\nlove with the process they've fallen in\nlove with becoming the person that\nthey're becoming they've fallen in love\nand created a dopamine reward system\nwhether they realize it or not and so\nI'm not sure that they knew they set up\na dopamine reward system but they did so\nwhen you look at a dopamine reward\nsystem what is it what is a dopamine\nreward system actually mean it's a way\nto get your brain to release some\ndopamine after you accomplish a task\nthat's part of your process\nso it's a way to get your brain to\nrelease dopamine\nas soon as you get done and you\naccomplish a task that is part of your\nprocess\nand once again it's subjective so you\ncan basically feel excitement for doing\nsomething right so in the context of a\ndopamine reward system dopamine is\nreleased in response to rewarding or\npleasurable stimuli\nthe release of dopamine\nit signals to the brain that the\nbehavior that led to the reward the\nrelease of the dopamine the celebration\nshould be repeated in the future so the\nrelease of the dopamine signals to the\nbrain that the behavior that led to the\nreward the celebration\nwhatever it is the hey I showed up at\nthe gym and I didn't want to hell yes\ncongratulations you're amazing I'm so\nproud of you for doing this you can\nliterally tell yourself this in your\nhead it's the release of dopamine and\nthat signals to the brain that the\nbehavior that led to the reward the\ncelebration the being proud of yourself\nshould be repeated in the future and\nthis is because dopamine reinforces the\nneural connections that were involved in\nthe behavior making it more likely that\nthe behavior will be repeated in the\nfuture so I'll give you an example of\nwhat I mean by that\nlet's say that you're trying to lose 10\npounds right you could be like I'm gonna\nI'm gonna lose 10 pounds and lose\ndepends and lose depends on lose 10\npounds and you can focus on it but at\nsome point in time you're probably going\nto do some really good stuff and you're\nprobably gonna up we all do right\nyou're gonna mess up at some point in\ntime\nusually when people mess up they feel\ndata they feel down on themselves they\nstart to you know tell themselves what\nan idiot you should have done that you\nscrewed up and instead of making\nthemselves feel good about the correct\nactions that they took they make them\nfeel bad about the time that they kind\nof fell off track\nand that's not going to motivate you to\nwant to do it again and so what happens\nis how can we reward ourselves in this\nprocess so let's say you did go to the\ngym\nyou showed up at the gym while you're\nworking out you're getting your first\nset in hell yeah I'm so proud of you for\nshowing up you don't want to freaking be\nhere you didn't want to be here and\nyou're doing what you didn't want to do\nI'm proud of you you get done with that\nnext set hell yeah great job on this set\nright releasing dopamine great job on\nthis I'm so proud of you first showing\nup I'm so proud for showing up every\nsingle set I'm so proud of you for\nshowing up I'm so proud of you for\nshowing up you're doing what you didn't\nwant to do we're on the right path we're\nin the process we will get the outcome\nwe just got to keep going you're talking\nyourself you're talking yourself you're\ntalking to yourself right you get done\nat the gym hell yes I'm so proud of you\ninstead of leaving the gym and look at\nyourself in the mirror and being like\ndamn it I'm so far away from my goal I'm\nstill not where I want to be and getting\npissed off at yourself you leave the gym\nand as you're walking out of the gym\nyou're like I'm so proud of you you eat\nthat thing that you wanted to eat hell\nyeah I'm so proud of you you say no to\nthat thing that you didn't want to eat\nor you know you shouldn't be eating if\nyou're trying to get to your goal hell\nyeah you said no to that you said no to\nthat bag of Skittles I know you wanted\nthat bag of Skittles right hell yeah so\nproud of you for this see the problem\nwith results-based goals\nis that if we're only focusing on the\nachievement of the goal dopamine won't\nbe released until you achieve the goal\nand that could be years down the road if\nyou set a 10-year goal and you're only\ngoing to be proud of yourself when you\nhit that 10-year goal\nyou're not going to get dopamine you're\nnot going to get product you're not\ngoing to get the the chemical of\nmotivation until you achieve that goal\nthat could be years down the road that's\nnot motivating you\nto do it that way how can you use the\nchemical of more the chemical of\nmotivation to actually want more and so\nwhen you look at like for instance a\nperson pops in my head is Kobe Bryant\nbecause I used to I studied him after he\npassed away and just was like what what\nhe was obsessed what made him obsessed\nhe accidentally set up a dopamine reward\nsystem I don't think he knew that this\nis what he was doing but maybe maybe he\ndid maybe work neurologist and they told\nhim this right his thing\nwas never about winning championships\nhis thing was never about winning\nchampionships did he want to of course\nbut his was I'm going to be the best\nfreaking basketball player that's ever\nwalked the planet sure this is exactly\nwhat LeBron James I'm sure this is\nexactly what Michael Jordan had done as\nwell right but if we look at Kobe Bryant\nhe would wake up at four o'clock in the\nmorning every single morning to work out\nbecause it motivated him knowing that\nhis average competition would wake up at\neight nine ten o'clock and so he would\ntell himself how amazing it is how proud\nof himself that he was that he was\nworking out while everyone else was\nsleeping\nand he would do it over and over and\nover again he would be proud of himself\nfor doing the thing that he needed to do\nso what does that make him more likely\nto do with the dopamine reward system\nshow up tomorrow and do the exact same\nthing and the end result the outcome was\nfive I think he won five NBA\nchampionships right but it wasn't just\nthe outcome that he was focused on it\nwasn't just becoming the best basketball\nplayer it was the process that he fell\nin love with\nand this is why daily action-based goals\nis way more important than the\nresults-based goals\nbecause you can celebrate yourself\nimmediately while doing it and if\ndopamine is released you're more likely\nto do again it's not about achieving the\ngoals the achieving the goals is the\nbyproduct of the process achieving the\ngoals of the byproduct of stepping into\nbeing that person every single day it's\nall about falling in love with the\njourney because humans we're all biased\ntowards the present we're really biased\ntowards the president if you think about\nit because if you go back a hundred\nthousand years to our ancestors like it\nwas the present moment all of the time\nit was we need to eat we need to survive\nwe need to be safe we need to get water\nwe need to get food all of this stuff\nand so humans are very biased towards a\npresent\nso what happens is if we start thinking\nabout that way we're really biased\ntowards the present this makes sense why\nhumans are so obsessed with instant\ngratification\nwe're so obsessive\nso what I would say is can we make the\ngoal for 10 years from now and then\nforget about it and focus on the actions\nthat you need to take every single day\nin order to hit that goal and then\ncelebrate celebrating yourself on the\nway to the process of hitting that goal\nright so we have a problem with with\ninstant gratification we're not really\ngood with delayed gratification we want\neverything now we want everything now we\nwant everything now which is normal\nbecause that should be built into our\nsystem that's how our ancestors survived\nbut if you want to build the business\nthat you want if you want to build a\nrelationship you want if you want to\nbuild the body that you want if you want\nto build the mindset if you want if you\nwant to build the the amazing life that\nyou want it doesn't happen like that it\ntakes time that's not how the world\nWorks everything great takes time but we\ncan hijack our system and give ourselves\ninstant gratification now for the things\nthat won't happen for a while\nright because you look at gratification\nif you go to the gym now you're not\ngoing to read the results you want for\nmonths you're not going to see the\nresults you want for maybe a year if you\ngo to college right now you're not going\nto get the degree for at least four\nyears\nif you save for retirement right now you\nwon't get you won't be able to retire\nfor like 20 30 years and so when you\nlook at instant gratification\nthe beautiful about thing about instant\ngratification is that we are geared more\ntowards instant gratification but our\ngoals won't come for the future so can\nwe use the dopamine reward system to\nactually hijack our system and feel\ninstant gratification for something that\nmight not come for years that might not\ncome for months that might not come for\nweeks\nand you think about that is actually\nkind of interesting to think about right\nso with instant gratification when we\nlook at everything that we want we know\nthat we can't get we won't go into the\ngym right now and have a six-pack as\nsoon as we walk out of the gym that'll\ntake delayed gratification instant\ngratification reward comes immediately\ndelayed gratification is a reward comes\nlater on down the line and we can know\nthis and we can give ourselves immediate\nrewards by releasing dopamine with\naction-based goals with literally the\ndaily action-based goals we can feel\nproud of ourselves in the moment and\nthat's the amazing thing about it\nthe immediate reward won't come for a\nwhile but we can immediately reward\nourselves for going to the gym we can\nreward ourselves while we're in the gym\nwe can reward ourselves while we're\nmaking the sales phone calls we can\nreward ourselves while we are waking up\nin the morning we can reward ourselves\nfor showing up and being present with\nour children and putting the phone away\nthe immediate reward doesn't happen when\nyou just go to the gym but celebrating\nyourself can actually feel like the\nreward\nthink about this for a second can you\nhijack your system to make your habits\nyour actions to become easier because if\nyou decide you know what\nlet's go back to the gym example if you\ndecide okay I'm gonna go to the gym like\nI want to lose these 10 pounds and I\nknow that it's eventually going to\nhappen as long as I take the right\naction that's all I'm going to do I'm\njust going to follow the right action\nand then you just show up for yourself\nand you just do it every single day\nevery single day every single day\nyou're going to get to where you want to\nbe the goals are a byproduct of the\nactions that you take in the actions\nthat you take become easier when you\nlink a dopamine reward system to it\nhabits become easier when you find\npleasure in doing them not when you talk\n to yourself during it because you\ndon't look the way that you want to look\nor because you're not where you want to\nbe or because it seems like it's so far\naway\nand it's as simple as being proud of\nyourself for showing up and taking our\nrights at the step in the right\ndirection and a lot of times doing what\nyou didn't want to do\nsee because all too often\nwhat we do is we pay attention to the\nbad we pay attention to the negative we\npay attention to what we don't want we\npay attention now we're not where we\nwant to be we pay attention to man I\n that up in that conversation with\nmy spouse right what we need to do is we\nneed to get better at praising the good\nin ourself when we did show up my feet\nhit the floor at 6am I'm going to praise\nmyself for doing that thing that I\nwanted to do we need to get better at\npraising the good in ourself and\nignoring the bad we need to get better\nat celebrating ourselves the same way\nthat we would celebrate a child that\nended up you know hitting the t-ball and\ngetting to first base\nor your friend that calls you up because\nthey got a job promotion the the one\nperson that you want to see succeed can\nwe get better at celebrating ourself the\nsame way that we would celebrate someone\nthat we truly love because progress\nfeels good when we feel like we're\nprogressing in the right direction it\nactually feels good\ncan we feel the progress can we feel the\nfeelings of how proud We Are of\nourselves for showing up and doing what\nwe need to do\nand so the secret to all of this is we\nneed the goals I 100 think that we need\nthe goals we need the one-year goals we\nneed the quarterly goals we need the\nfive-year goals ten year goals whatever\nit is that you want but then when you\nlook at the goals you've got to ask\nyourself who do I need to be what do I\nneed to do in order to achieve this\nthing and then all we do is we just show\nup every single day and when we show up\nwe're proud of ourselves\nand so the way that I've been using this\nrecently just to give you an idea of how\nI'm using it so I've been working out\non off three to four times a week for\nprobably 15 16 years now right but for\nme it was always about how can I build\nmuscle how can I lose fat how can I lift\nthe most amount of weight how can I get\nas big as I possibly can how can become\na beast in the gym and and all of that\nand it was always go go like outcome\nbased outcome based outcome based\noutcome based and then I just decided\nthis year\nyou know what I'm just going to show up\nto the gym every single day I'm going to\nmove my body in some sort of way three\nto four times a week that means lifting\nreally heavy right\nthree to four times a week the other\nthree or four times it's moving my body\nin some sort of way sometimes it's yoga\nsometimes it's hot yoga sometimes it's\ngoing for a run sometimes it's getting\nin some floor movements and what they\ncall animal flow and Primal movements on\nthe ground sometimes it's it's you know\ndoing crawls outside it's just what does\nmy body feel like it needs to do today\nand what's crazy about is this entire\nyear I've worked out probably 95 percent\nof the days this year and so I am\nlooking and I'm going this is actually\npretty crazy I'm in one of the best\nshapes of my life\nand I haven't been focusing on the\noutcome at all all I've been focusing on\nis what do I need to do today\nand I'm going to tell you majority of\nthe days I don't feel like moving my\nbody I'm just gonna be honest I'm like\nI'd rather just sit here and do nothing\nit's a lot easier to sit on the couch\nand do nothing but I've been saying I'm\njust going to show up every single day\nso I'm going to do I'm gonna show up for\nmyself today and when I show up I reward\nmyself I reward myself with hell yeah\ngreat job once I start to feel the\nmovement of my heart be getting better\nof getting a little bit more into it I'm\nlike I'm in the zone I'm starting to\nfeel in the zone this is great and what\nI'm doing is I'm through the process man\nyou showed up and you didn't want to\nshow up today I'm proud of you\nfor doing that man looking in the mirror\ndude those muscles are looking good I'm\nreally proud of you today like and just\nshowing up oh my set was supposed to be\ndone I'm going to do one extra one dude\nyou just did one extra one you did an\nextra set I'm so proud of you for doing\nthat and what happens is you start to\nactually get the results that you want\nyou get the outcome that you want but\nyou don't even focus on the outcome you\nfocus on the daily processes the action\nbased goal goals of what needs to happen\ntoday and you celebrate yourself for it\nand when you celebrate yourself and you\nrelease that dopamine your brain and\nyour body go hey that's pretty good we\nshould do that thing again because if\nyou go back to what I said earlier\nwhen you look at the dopamine reward\nsystem dopamine is released in response\nto rewarding or pleasurable stimuli the\nrelease of the dopamine signals to the\nbrain that the behavior\nthat led to the reward should be\nrepeated in the future\nand this is because dopamine reinforces\nthe neural connections that were\ninvolved in the behavior making it more\nlikely that the behavior will be\nrepeated in the future find your\nlong-term goals and then ask yourself\nwhat actions do I need to take each day\nand how can I reward myself every single\nday for taking those actions do that and\nwatch how many goals you hit so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories and tag me in\nat Rob dial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-jr I have to thank all of you\nfor
