    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to stop numbing all the\nfeelings the emotions the traumas that\nhave happened to you in your past so\nthat you can heal and create the life\nthat you want let's dive in before we\ndive in I understand the word Addiction\ncan be very triggering for some people\nand I get it my father uh was an\nalcoholic my parents got divorced when I\nwas when I was 10 years old and he\npassed away when I was 15 from being an\nalcoholic so I get it but um when I talk\nabout addiction I talk about addiction\nin the way of uh numbing yourself in\nsome sort of way most of us numb in some\nsort of way and I've done a podcast in\nthe past about numbing um but I want to\ngo more in depth about speaking how the\nnumbing works with your nervous system\nand why we why we do it and how to get\npast it so that we can create the life\nthat we want so when you look at the\nnervous system itself your nervous\nsystem has two states neither one of\nthem before I dive into it is good or\nbad they just are uh both of them are\nnecessary for our survival that's why\nthey're both inside of us so when you\nlook at the the two different types one\nof them is called the sympathetic\nnervous system and the sympathetic\nnervous system is basically when your\nyour nervous system is alert it has a\nlot of energy it goes into fight or\nflight uh your heart rate will increase\nyour rate of breathing will increase\nyour pupils will actually dilate so you\ncan see the world more clear uh it's\nreally really good when you're running\nfrom a lion the problem is a lot of\npeople don't realize it but they're\nstuck in sympathetic nervous their\nsympathetic sympathetic nervous system\nall day long this was me for a very long\ntime as I was in a stressed out state\nfor so long for years and it becomes\nexhausting the other side of the nervous\nsystem is what's called your\nparasympathetic nervous system um this\nis where you conserve and where you\nrestore this is uh has you know you have\na decreased heart rate\nyour rate of breathing also decreases as\nwell and so you have sympathetic for\nwhen you need to take action when you\nneed to move when you need to run where\nyou need to be in fight or flight when\nstress is actually a good thing and you\nhave parasympathetic which is rest\nrelaxation conserve energy restore\nrebuild your cells all of that now when\nyou look at this and we talk about it\nfrom just like like the idea of numbing\nwhy would somebody numb thems why would\nsomebody numb their feelings well\nthere's a lot of different reasons so\nmaybe it's to escape your painful\nemotions maybe it's it's your way of\ntrying to cope with stress of what's\ngoing on in your relationship or what's\ngoing on at work or things that are\ngoing on with uh your children it could\nbe that you do it to avoid past trauma\nthat is unhealed that you haven't you\nknow stepped back and said I want to\nheal this thing so it's kind of um\nunconsciously taking your energy in the\nback back of your head all day long uh\nmaybe it's an unconscious pattern that\nyou have maybe there is a unresolved\nemotional pain if things happen to you\num when you were younger maybe it's a\nheartbreak maybe it's being cheated on\nmaybe it's a death of someone that you\nlove that's unresolved you didn't give\nyourself enough time to grieve um maybe\nit's you know running from the fact that\nyou're in a marriage that you've wanted\nto be out of for the past seven years I\ndon't know the exact flavor of yours but\nalmost everybody has one thing that\nthey're kind of running from you know I\nI've been working on myself for almost\n20 years now and I don't feel like I'm\nanywhere near here healed I've made a\nwhole lot of progress but there is just\nstill so many things that I just\ncontinue to keep working on and that's\nwhat I see with everybody I don't think\nwe ever get to a point where we're just\nfully you know a perfect healed being\nand a lot of times what we do is we have\nthat unresolved trauma the coping with\nstress the painful emotions um\nunresolved pain from the past and what\nwe do is we want to calm the nervous\nsystem it's like we are in in\nsympathetic fight ORF flight for so long\nall day long multiple days in a row and\nour our unconscious and our body is just\nlike dude chill it out like just chill\nfor a little bit and we want to go from\nsympathetic to parasympathetic which is\njust basically like another way of\nsaying that is like I've been so\nstressed out I just need to calm down\nright that would be the difference of\nsympathetic to parasympathetic a lot of\npeople though\nlack the tools to mentally and\nphysically to be able to do that and so\nwhat happens is they unconsciously go to\nsomething else that will do it for them\nmuch faster so it could be drugs it\ncould be alcohol it could be sex it\ncould be work mine was absolutely work\nhow I dealt you know ran not dealt with\nran from my trauma of everything\nhappened to me in my past was I became a\nworkaholic and worked 110 hours a week\nso that I didn't even have time to think\nabout my trauma uh for some people it's\nscreen time it's watching TV for five\nhours a day it's Netflix it's Doom\nscrolling on Instagram and Tik Tock and\nand just turning your brain off while\nyou're\nscrolling um and one of the most common\nones uh and often overlooked is food and\nfood's interesting because we actually\nneed food to survive like we have to\nhave this thing to survive but so many\npeople are numbing thems through food\nand so it's a really tricky one where\nit's like you got to have it but you\nalso got to make sure you're not numbing\nyourself hey real quick I want to\nintroduce you to something called\nmindset Mentor plus if you love this\npodcast you will absolutely love what\nI'm about to talk about I designed\nmindset Mentor plus to help you actively\nintegrate every one of these episodes\ninto your life and here's how it works\nwith every episode of this podcast that\ncomes out mindset Mentor plus\nsubscribers get more you're going to get\nmultiple page detailed printable\nworksheets effectively in mini master\nclass that's way more in- depth than\njust this podcast they also come with\njournaling questions challenges\nassignments and so much more so that\nyou're not just listening to these\npodcasts passively but you're actively\nintegrating them into your life that way\nyou improve much faster I also do\nmonthly Q&A sessions in there and much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription uh there was a study that\nwas done in 1996 it called\nself-regulation failure and it showed\nhow uh uh people fail to control\nbehaviors and emotions and that led to\nuh issues like overeating and substance\nabuse so because they don't know how to\ncontrol their behaviors and their\nthoughts they started overeating they\nstarted having substance abuse and the\nstudy really highlights that stress\nnegative emotions lack of coping skills\nand the pursuit of immediate\ngratification deplete your\nself-regulation resources and so\nlong-term consequences of that numbing\nuh that they found through this study\nwas phys physical health problems mental\nhealth issues and strained relationships\nof the people who didn't have coping\nmechanisms and so really when you look\nat it they said they started building\nout this system of like what does it\nlook like to improve your\nself-regulation and what they came up\nwith was you need to learn to develop\ncoping strategies you need to uh set\nclear goals for yourself and your\nhealing and stick to them and then um\ntry to work on increased self-awareness\naess so that you can understand how and\nwhy you feel the way that you feel and\nso like I always say that the most\nimportant thing I think for everybody in\nthis world to have is self-awareness and\nso it talks about how to increase your\nself-awareness and how you need to\nincrease it so that you can understand\nhow you feel the way that you feel why\nyou feel the way that you feel and how\nto how to actually work through it and\nso the study showed um the the basically\nhow to find your addictions how to\nbetter understand yourself and how to\nwork through these negative emotions so\nthat you can release them versus trying\nto to numb the feeling with immediate\ngratification and so this is uh is very\nvery common for people but what it dealt\nwith and what's really important is what\nI was talking about just a minute ago\nwhich is one of the most common things\nthat we use for numbing um and one of\nthe most overlooked addictions is food\nif you have a problem with food uh this\nmight make you really start to\nunderstand yourself so I was um I was\nspeaking with a friend of mine and I was\nspeaking with another friend of mine who\nwas talking to him and the other friend\nof mine is a um a psychologist and one\nof my friends that has a problem with\nweight he you know has been up and down\nand up and down and up and down his\nentire life uh since he was a kid and so\nwhat he does it's really interesting\nbecause he doesn't eat like all day long\nhe works and works and works and works\nand works and works and works and works\nand works so he doesn't eat much\nthroughout the day and then when he's\ndone working so he like works so much to\nnot pay attention to his stuff that he\nneeds to work through he works he's so\nbusy all day long and then when he gets\ndone he just eats a ton of food that he\nknows he shouldn't he eats tons of fats\nand carbs and uh greasy stuff and just\ntons of cheese cheese isn't bad but a\nlot of cheese especially processed\ncheese um and so it's basically like a\ncomplete\noverload and um my friend who was a\ntherapist and I were both talking to him\nand what we discovered is is my the\nfriend who was a therapist like what\nyou're dealing with is very common is\nthat so many people\novereat just so they don't actually feel\nwhat they want what what's going on in\nthe background you know like why does he\ndo this because he's in work work work\nall day long and sympathetic all day\nlong running from some things that will\ngo unmentioned in this podcast episode\nthen he eats a ton of food and the mind\nhas to basically shut off and digest the\nbody the the body's like you know what\nwe need so much resources to to eat all\nof this that he just put in we put\nwe have to put so much resources to it\nlet's just turn the brain down for a\nwhile because digestion is the number\none most energy consuming thing your\nbody does and so what it does is\ndigestion because it's so much that he's\neating sends his body into\nparasympathetic which is calm and\npeaceful therefore food becomes his\ncomfort so if You' have the same thing\nof like you can't stop eating or you\novereat or you have a problem with with\nthis sometimes what it is is food\nbecomes Comfort because Comfort allows\nyou the the the the digestion takes so\nmuch energy that it takes away the\nenergy from thinking and the mind\ndoesn't really have much energy to think\nabout the trauma or the pain or the fact\nthat someone's in a relationship they\ndon't want to be in whatever it might be\nhe basically and we spoke about this the\nthree of us together he does not have\nthe mental tools to calm himself down so\nhe unconsciously does it through food\nyou know other people there to like wine\nlike I love wine there's nothing wrong\nwith it but when someone's going oh man\nI need to have a couple glasses just to\ntake the edge off I've said this in the\npodcast before why is why is there an\nedge what is the edge if someone needs\nto smoke a joint because they want to\ntake an ed the edge off why is there an\nedge in the first place you know most\npeople would rather drink a glass of\nwine or two versus try to figure out why\nthere's an edge or think about their\nrelationship they don't want to be in or\ntheir childhood trauma or how their um\nyou know children are doing XYZ and I\nget it at the moment it's the easiest\nthing to do it's easy to just drink a\nglass of wine and say ah screw it it\nfeels better right it's easier to drink\na glass of wine than it is to like sit\ndown and try to hear heal your childhood\ntrauma I get it uh or you know all the\nworries that you have about your\nchildren moving out of the house or\nwhatever it is that you worry about all\nday long right and uh or you know what\nit might be that you're running from but\nI want you understand this and I say\nthis phrase a lot the cave that you're\nafraid to enter holds the treasure that\nyou seek what you're looking for in your\nlife is in the cave that you're so\nafraid to enter so in the cave that you\nthat you're afraid to enter hold a\ntreasure that you seek once again though\nthis numbing is just basically an\nunconscious act to get yourself from\nsympathetic to parasympathetic from\nstressed and anxious and worrying and\nfearful to\ncalm but I don't know about you I would\nmuch rather be able to do it without\nneeding something I would rather try to\ndevelop the tools like breathing and\nmeditation and and journaling to be in\ncharge of the body and be able to work\nthrough anything that pops up right when\nyou see like drugs that's easy to see\nbut most drugs put people into\nparasympathetic when you see someone\nthat develops something like being a sex\naddict sex is something that makes you\nso present and you have so many\nendorphins and so much oxytocin and so\nmuch serotonin everything going through\nyour body that you for get about\neverything else when you're uh addicted\nto working out or you're a workaholic\nall of these things are just a form of\nrunning running from whatever it is the\nsubconscious is doing to what the the\nbrain is doing the mind is doing to put\nyour body into a stress sympathetic\nState it's also the reason why so many\npeople have trouble being bored like for\nme I was terrible at this when I lacked\nthe skills to be able to to cope with\nthese things I would go on vacation with\nmy wife she was my girlfriend at the\ntime I would go on vacation to\ndisconnect and I would not be able to\ndisconnect I had to be on my phone I had\nto be working I had to be you know uh on\nInstagram all of those things because I\ncouldn't be bored what and then you know\nyou take a step back you say what's\nwrong with being bored well boredom is\njust the absence of something to do and\nsome people go crazy when there's\nnothing to do why because what comes up\nwhen you're bored your anger your\nfrustration your sadness your trauma the\nthings that you been running from what\ncomes up is what's always there it's\nbubbling under the surface now it just\nhas an opportunity well you're not doing\nsomething and it's wanting to come out\nso it's just bubbling up to the surface\nand you're like nope I can't do this I\ngot to scroll on Instagram I got to do\nsomething else I can't do\nnothing why why do we do this why do we\nrun from you know and the way I like to\nthink of\nboredom replace the word boredom with\nrelaxation you know like giving your\nmind a moment to relax for 30 minutes or\nif you go on vacation for a few days but\nwhy do we do this why do we why do we\nhate being bored is because people lack\nthe tools to calm their nervous system\ndown and so like I did an episode in the\npast called how to self Sue I would\nrecommend that you go back to that um\nbut we're never taught this I realized\nuh when I made that podcast episode is\nthat like for six seven8 months I was\nlike man we're we're never taught how to\nself Soo like babies know how to self\nSoo children know how to self soothe\nwe're not taught how to self Soo sooth\nas adults and so we become addicted to\nstimuli we become addicted to running we\nbecome addicted to numbing in some sort\nof way to not feel these things but what\nI want you to understand is that there\nis short-term\nbenefit in that moment that's why we do\nit everything that we do is towards some\nsort of benefit so there's a short-term\nbenefit of not feeling anxious not\nfeeling stress calming down whatever it\nmight be but short-term benefit but\nlong-term consequence is what it is most\npeople think of now and they don't think\nof the compounding effect of their\ndecisions over the next 10 years and I\nwant you to understand I've said this\nmany times in the podcast time is either\nyour best friend or it's your greatest\nenemy if you're in your late 30s or more\nyou have friends on Facebook that you've\nseen in high school from high school and\nyou can see who has made good decisions\nof taking care of thems over the past 10\n15 20 years and who hasn't made good\ndecisions you can can't you\nlike one of my best friends from high\nschool never really stopped partying you\nknow not a big deal when you're in your\n20s but now he's in his late 30s he\nlooks like he's 45 and so if you're\nstill in your 20s you probably think\nyou're you're you're kind of invincible\nno big deal wait another 15 years 20\nyears and you'll start to see that time\nalways wins and so it's really important\nfor you out there to understand that if\nyou are numbing in some sort of way it's\nreally important to to write it down and\nand identify where where you are numbing\nand then ask yourself the question write\nit down pen and paper why are you\nnumbing so if you're the type of person\nwho can't stop scrolling on Instagram\nwhy are you numbing what is it that\nyou're numbing if you're the type person\nwho has to have a couple glasses of wine\nevery single night to quote unquote take\nthe edge off what are you\nnumbing what are you running from what\nis it what is the cave that you're\nafraid to enter because that holds a\ntreasure that you seek your freedom is\non the other side of working through\nthat thing\nsure I get it there's there's many we\nfood wine drugs sex working all of those\nthings cool great amazing but I promise\nyou this what you're really looking for\nis the freedom from whatever it is\nthat's that's constantly taking up that\nenergy inside of your mind and you have\nto find a better way to sooe yourself\nand bring yourself from a a a stressed\nout state to a calm State you can go\nback to my episode on self soothing you\ncan listen to it if you want but you've\ngot to replace that numbing with action\nthat will help heal you in some sort of\nway and drive your life forward versus\nkeeping you in the exact same spot so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode
