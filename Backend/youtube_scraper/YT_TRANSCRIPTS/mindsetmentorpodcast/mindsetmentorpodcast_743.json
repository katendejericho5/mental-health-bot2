    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nthree things that you should stop doing\nimmediately before we do let's be real\nlet's be honest with each other shall we\nbeing a human is tough being a human is\nhard don't get me wrong it's it is\namazing it is really really amazing but\nthis can be tough can't it you've\nbeen through some things in your life\nhaven't you you've been through some\nthings you're probably gonna go through\nmore things at some point in time your\nlife it can be a beautiful it can be\namazing it could be hard as hell\nbut the craziest part about it is that\n99 of the time when things are tough we\nare actually the ones making it tough on\nourselves it doesn't have to be as tough\nas we make it often we can get stuck in\nthe past we get stuck in the future we\ncan worry about mistakes that we've made\nwe could get anxiety about what might be\ncoming up next week and all of those\nthings\nend up making a lot harder on herself\nversus actually just being in the\npresent moment we live in a world where\neverything's always changing something\nis always happening there's always\nsomething bad that's happening in the\nworld we're always searching for\nhappiness we're always searching for\nfulfillment we want some meaning in our\nlives but we also have to pay the\nbills right so why don't we try to make\nit a little bit easier on ourselves with\nall of the stuff that can happen all the\nstuff that does happen wouldn't it be\nnicer if we just made it a little bit\neasier on ourselves every single day it\nwould so today I'm going to be talking\nto you about three things that you need\nto stop doing immediately so that you\ncan be a happier person okay three\ndifferent things\nnumber one stop regretting the past I\nhave coached many many people over the\npast 17 years of me coaching people and\nthe one thing that I see that's very\ncommon one of the things that I see\nthat's very common is that so many\npeople are stuck in the past they they\nthink the past is is making them who\nthey are right now they think the past\nis a is something that matters going\ninto their future like they can't go\ninto their future without bringing their\npast with them and it's common to look\nback on the past and to have a lot of\nregrets\nthings that we did decisions that we\nmade you know things that you didn't do\nthings that you did do\nopportunities that were there that you\nmissed mistakes that you made in\nrelationships in the past and we can\nlook in the past and we can look and be\nlike damn it man like I could have done\nso much better but what's really\nimportant to know is that in the past\nwhatever happened you did the best that\nyou could with the knowledge that you\nhad at that time it's easy to have more\nknowledge today like you know you could\nhave really something up five\nyears ago\nand it's easy to look at it five years\nlater down the road today and be like\ndamn it I wish I would have done that I\nwish I would have been different but\nit's easy to have more knowledge today\nnow five years later and wish you would\nhave done something different then\nit's natural to feel that way but it's\nimportant to understand you didn't have\nthe knowledge that you have now\nback then\nand I always bring whenever I think\nabout the pastor here people that are\nruminating in the past they're stuck in\nthe past I always bring the phrase that\nI've heard so many times from Peter\nChrome which is what happened happened\nand could not have happened any other\nway because it didn't like I truly\nbelieve that every single thing that\nhappens to us in our life is a lesson\nfor us to learn to improve to get better\nall of that and if it happened it\nabsolutely 100 had to happen that way\nand so I can relieve myself from the\npast and it's natural to feel like you\nwish things would have been different\nbut it's important to understand that\ndwelling in the past dwelling on your\nmistakes dwelling on your failures\ndwelling on all the things you messed up\nhold you back from moving forward and it\ntakes you out of the present moment and\nif you're out of the present moment it\nmeans you're not doing the best that you\npossibly can be in this present moment\nwhich means that dwelling on the past is\nholding you back from a better future\nso what do we do well instead of\nregretting the past when we look at the\nevent that we wish would have been\ndifferent that we would have done\nsomething different we need to learn\nfrom it so instead of looking at me like\nman I wish I would have done this I wish\nI would have done this take that exact\nsame event get a pen and paper and say\nwhat can I learn from this if there is a\nGod or a universe that came down and\nsaid I'm going to give you this life\nexperience because there's lessons in it\nwhat were the lessons that you were\nsupposed to extract and learn so that\nyou could bring with you on the rest of\nyour life so you could get better\nbecause mistakes can be our greatest\nteachers mistakes should be our greatest\nteachers and then we can use them to\nimprove ourselves we can use them to\nimprove our lives\nbut we have to be the ones to extract\nthe lessons no one's going to come and\ngive you a lesson based off of your past\nand so you look at the event you look at\nwhat you did you look at how you screwed\nup or someone else screwed up and you\nsay what was I supposed to learn from\nthis what is the lesson that I have\nmissed from this event in my life\nbecause I've been too caught up in\nwishing that it would have been\ndifferent versus looking at it as it\nbeing absolutely perfect\nand it was brought to me because I'm\nsupposed to learn something there was a\nlesson there was a teacher that was in\nhere where is that lesson because you\nknow you can't change the past like we\nknow it but so often\npeople get so caught up in wishing that\nthey could change it\nwe can't control the past we can't\nchange the past but we can control our\nresponse to the past and we've got to\nstop living and you've got to stop\nthinking about it all the time because\nit's stealing your present moment if\nit's stealing your present moment then\nit's stealing your future the past has\nnothing to do with the present moment\nthe same way that if you're in a boat\nand you look backwards and you see the\nwake of the boat the wake of the boat\ncannot steer the ship so if the wake of\nthe boat cannot see the ship it's the\nexact same thing your past cannot change\nyour present moment unless you let it\nthe past should not control your current\nfeelings\nanother thing that's important about the\npast the last thing I'll say about is\nthis is I think most people just need to\npractice more self-compassion we need to\nbe kinder to ourselves and forgive\nourselves for our mistakes we screwed up\nyeah you up dude you did\nsometimes really bad\nbut hey it is the way that it was stop\nbeating yourself up over it it happened\nthree years ago get over it get past it\nstop beating yourself up because so many\npeople beat themselves up over something\nthat they cannot change\nwhat's the point of that we need to\nunderstand that making mistakes is\nnatural it's a natural part of life it's\nwhat you're supposed to have had happen\nin your Human Experience but really what\ncan we learn from it that's the matter\nso that's the first thing\nis to stop worrying about the past the\nsecond thing is to stop worrying about\nthe future the future is this great\nunknown\nand something that is unknown to the\nhuman brain the animalistic side of us\nthere is an animalistic side of you\nthat's inside of you that does not like\nthe unknown the unknown is very\ndangerous to the anime animalistic brain\nand so your brain wants to solve the\nunknown and by solving the unknown what\nyour brain will do is it will project\ninto the future\nand it'll project itself into the future\nand start thinking of all of the things\nthat could possibly go wrong so that you\ncan start to plan a way to protect\nyourself\nbut that's a lot of energy that your\nbrain is using your brain uses more\nenergy than any other organ in your body\nit weighs only two percent of your\nentire body weight but uses about 20 of\nyour energy every single day\nyou've done it before you've had a day\nwhere you're literally sitting in front\nof the computer you're working you're\ncranking a lot of stuff and by the time\nyou get done five six o'clock like\nyou're exhausted your physical body\nbarely moved but your brain was just\ngoing going and so to to worry about the\nfuture is a lot of mental energy spent\nwhen it can be used towards something\nproductive and if you've listened this\npodcast for a long time you've heard me\nsay the statistic before but\npsychologists have found that about 85\npercent of what you worry about will\nnever happen\nand out of the other 15 percent that\nwill happen\nthey found that 12 percent of that 15\npercent\nhappens better way better than you\nthought it would meaning that only three\npercent of what we worry about actually\nhappens one out of 33 things that we\nworry about happens the way that we\nthink it's going to happen which means\n32 things that we're worrying about\nwe're wasting our energy worrying about\nit\nyour energy is so precious it is so\nfinite you've only got a certain amount\nevery single day there's only so much\ncoffee you can drink to try to give\nyourself more energy what a waste of\nyour precious time what a waste of your\nprecious energy by worrying about things\nthat may never happen worrying about the\nfuture leads to anxiety it leads to\nstress it puts your brain and your body\nthrough way more than needs to go\nthrough\nit can also cause you to miss out on\nopportunities because you're too focused\non what might happen you're not even\nliving in the present moment you\ncompletely miss things that are\nhappening in the present moment there's\nso many people that have anxiety\nnowadays and anxiety comes from like 99\nof the time worrying about something in\nthe future and most of the time those\nthings never actually happen so what do\nwe need to do we need to start being\naware of when we're projecting our\nthoughts and our mind into the future\ntoo much we're having too much anxiety\nabout the future too much stress about\nthe future and we're worrying about\nsomething like you know I was having a\nconversation the other day and they were\nworried with someone the other day and\nthey were worrying about a bill that is\ndue in a couple months\nand I'm like okay\nhow long have you been worried about\nthis oh my gosh I've been worried about\nthis for months\nokay so you've been spending months\nworrying about a bill that's still due\nin a couple months when in reality\nthat's just stealing away your present\nmoment where you could literally work to\nmake that money\nin the present moment so that you don't\nhave to worry about that bill\nso we need to focus more on the present\nmoment we need to be more present we\nneed to notice when we get out of our\nout of our present reality\nand start projecting the future we need\nto practice more gratitude and\nappreciate the things that we have in\nour lives that are literally in this\nmoment and so then you ask yourself how\ndo I when I notice myself worrying too\nmuch projecting too much in the future\nwhat do I do\nvery simple you bring yourself back to\nyour body okay because your brain tends\nto live in two different places either\nthe past or the future very rarely does\nthe human brain live in the present\nmoment unless we try to bring it to the\npresent moment what's cool about your\nbrain and your body your brain likes to\nproject forward and backwards forward\nand backwards it's all over the place\nsometimes it's here sometimes it's\nanother place but your body is always in\nthe present moment it's always here your\nbrain's all over the place your body is\nhere and so what do you do is you always\ncome back to your body so if you feel\nyourself projecting too far into the\nfuture or too far into the past worrying\nor regretting or any of those things\nbring yourself back to this moment\ntake 60 breaths and try to be as\nconscious as possible in those six deep\nbreaths in through your nose out through\nyour mouth how you can bring your\nyourself back to your body\nyou can notice you the movement of your\nchest going up and your belly going up\nand your belly going down you can notice\nthe feeling of your shirt on your skin\nas that happens you can notice your\nheartbeat you can notice the the feeling\nof the breath going in the nose and the\nway it feels on your nose and now it's a\nlittle bit colder and the breath coming\nout of your mouth and how it feels in\nyour lips and you bring yourself to the\nfeelings of the body and so you bring\nyourself back to this present moment and\nso that's number two is you have to stop\nworrying so much about the future and\nnumber three another thing that's going\nto help you become happier immediately\nis to stop looking for happiness in\nother people\none of the biggest mistakes that you can\nhave and to make but also to just assume\nis that other people are going to make\nyou happy not just other people but that\nthings are going to make you happy\nhappiness is a state of mind it is not a\nreaction to life\nit's a state of mind it's something that\nyou decide to be you can decide to be\nhappy regardless of circumstances\nthere's many people that have\ncircumstances way worse than yours\nbut are also happier than you would show\nyou that circumstances are not what make\nyou happy or not all too often we we\ntake our circumstances and we go oh I\nwon't be happy until I can buy this\nthing or we say oh my you know I'm this\nway and I'm not happy because my\nhusband's this way and I'm not the way\nbecause my children are doing this and\nmy son is failing you have to stop\nlooking for happiness in other people it\nis not anybody else's job to make you\nhappy if they married you it's still not\ntheir job to make you happy the same way\nit's not your job to make them happy it\nis a decision that somebody has to make\nto make themselves happy to find\nhappiness in this moment to decide to\nget into a state\nof happiness because it's important to\nhave real positive relationships in our\nlives it's important to have connection\nbut our happiness and our fulfillment\ndoesn't come from anybody else\nit doesn't\nthere's no way of doing that\nno you know no achievement oh I want to\nmake a million dollars and I'll be happy\nno when you make a million dollars\nyou're still going to feel exactly the\nsame way that you feel right now you\nknow when I get into a relationship and\nbe happy no oh when my husband starts\nacting this way then I'll be happy oh\nwhen my child decides to start stop\nacting up in school then I'll be happy\nno there's no way to do that if you're\nlooking for happiness in other people it\nwill only deal it will only lead to\nfrustration and will lead to\ndisappointment because people are not\nperfect\nthey'll inevitably let you down at some\npoint in time they'll say something\nwrong things are not going to go you're\nnot going to get your expectations met\nall of the time\nso when you set yourself up you set\nyourself up for failure when you think\nthat other people are going to make you\nhappy because other people are going to\nscrew up because people are people and\nthat's what they're going to do but when\nyou look at your life and you wake up\neach morning you say okay I'm going to\nto make happiness a priority for myself\nI am going to make myself happy\nI had a really good friend who was one\nof the first employees at Facebook and\nhe got fired from Facebook and when they\ngot you know it's like a year later they\nwent public he missed out on like 180\nmillion dollars and he got really\ndepressed for a little while because he\nmissed out on 180 million dollars and\nthen he said something to me that I will\nremember for the rest of my life and\nthat phrase was he said\nI decided one day when I was really\ndepressed that I would not let my\nhappiness or my depression be left up to\nchance and what he meant by that is he\nsaid so every morning so what I did he\nsaid that what he did is he made this\nbig huge list of all of the things that\nmade him happy in life and you know\nthings that he did the ways that he\nthought reading books sitting in silence\ntalking positively to himself and they\nstarted asking himself how can I bring\nas many of these things as possible into\nmy life every single day and so he would\nwake up every single morning\nhe would look at that listen he would\nprioritize his happiness and he brought\nhimself out of a depression because he\nwas prioritizing happiness and he was\ntaking the things that made him happy in\nthe way of life and the state of\nhappiness that he could bring in bring\nout of himself and started prioritizing\nthat and so don't look for other people\nto make you happy it's not other\npeople's jobs to make you happy it is\nyour job to make you happy and so if you\nwant to be happier prioritize your\nhappiness more than anything else and so\nthose are the three things you want to\nstop doing immediately number one you\nwant to make sure that you stop\nregretting the past number two you've\ngot to stop worrying about the future\nand number three you've got to stop\nsearching for happiness in other people\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode
