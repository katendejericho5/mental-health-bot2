    "transcript": "so let me tell you why people don't get\nwhat they want in life it's actually\nreally simple it's because they don't\nfocus on what they want they focus on\nwhat they don't want they focus on I\ndon't want to be broke or I don't want\nto be alone or I just don't want to be\nsad anymore and motorcyclists know this\nin motorcycle school they teach you to\nlook through the turn to only look at\nwhere you want to go because that's\nwhere you're going to end up you end up\ngoing where you're looking if there's a\ncrash don't look at the crash look at\nwhere you want to go so the reason why\nmost people don't get what they want is\nbecause they won't stop focusing on what\nit is that they don't want"
