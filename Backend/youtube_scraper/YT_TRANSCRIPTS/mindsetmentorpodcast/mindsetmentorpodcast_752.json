    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nlearning to let go of certain things and\nreally what it comes down to is letting\ngo of things that do not serve you\nanymore have you ever taken time and\ntaken a pen and paper\nand thought about all of the things that\nyou do like everything on a daily basis\non a weekly basis and decided all of\nthose things\ndo they serve you or do they not serve\nyou like are they good for you or are\nthey holding you back and part of our\nAwakening process part of Awakening to\nbecoming a better version of ourselves\nis to realize that we have been asleep\nbeing asleep doesn't mean just like\nyou're actually just snoring right I\nmean being asleep means that you are\nunaware of most the stuff that you're\ndoing and unaware that most of the stuff\nthat we are doing or let me say this\nlots of things that we are doing is not\nserving us it's actually holding us back\nin many ways and so have you been living\na lot of your life as if you're just\nasleep like I want I want to take you in\nthrough a process that I went through\nwhen I was at my lowest of lows it was\nOctober 2010 and\nit literally seemed like every single\nthing in my life just crumbled\neverything in my life was terrible\neverything went to and you know I\nwent from having a super successful\nbusiness to be in five months behind my\ncar payment living off of pasta for two\nmonths I lived in Fort Lauderdale on a\none bedroom apartment and all I had was\na bunch of books all over the floor and\na king-sized bed that was on the floor\nas well and I went through everything in\nmy life and I sat there and it was it\nwas this realization that I had when I\nwas sitting on the floor and I still\nremember where I was sitting on the\nfloor inside the apartment and I thought\nto myself no one's coming to save me\nlike if I'm either gonna be here or I'm\ngoing to be somewhere else but no one's\ngoing to come and save me and change my\nlife I have to change my life for myself\nand what I did was I went through\neverything in my life and I either\ndecided I'm going to keep it or I'm\ngoing to get rid of it and it was sure\npersonal belongings but it was also\neverything else as well it was thought\nprocesses it was the when I wake job it\nwas what I eat it was who I surround\nmyself with and I I literally just tried\nto clear everything out\nas if it was just full-on you know my\nlife was already kind of in shambles but\nit was a full-on demolishing at that\npoint in time I'm gonna just completely\nclear the slate and I'm going to start\nto rebuild myself and rebuild my life\nthe way that I want to I'm going to get\nrid of the things that do not serve me\nanymore and I'm going to keep the things\nthat do serve me and start to bring in\nmore things that do serve me and so\nwe're going to go through many things\ntoday and my goal is to help you try to\nawaken\nto some of the actions that you take\nthat are no longer serving you for your\nhighest good that are not helping you\nget to where you want to go and as we go\nthrough a lot of pieces of your life if\nyou are if you is it if it is available\nfor you to grab a pen and paper it would\nreally help you out because you can\nstart to actually work through these as\nI'm going through them but if not start\nto think of them consciously if you're\ndriving right now start to think of the\nquestions and start to make some\nrealization about what you need to keep\nwhat you need to let go of all of that\nstuff and so\nthe real question is does it serve me\ndoes it serve me for my highest good\n10 years from now that dream life that\nyou know that you want\ndoes this thing that we're talking about\nas we're going through this does it\nserve me in creating the life that I\nknow I can have in 10 years so it could\nbe where you live it could be the house\nthat you live in the part of town that\nyou live in the city that you're in it\ncould be the state that you're in when\nyou look at that when you look at people\nthat are in your family uh I don't mean\nlike your children don't like leave your\nchildren be like no these kids no longer\nserve me I mean like when you look at\nyour relationship with your aunts and\nuncles brothers sisters mother father\nall of that when you look at everything\nthat you have\ndo all of these things serve you\nand you start to look into the future\nand you start to look at the life that\nyou do want\nand you start to look at everything in\nthe future that is 100 possible as we\nstart to go through these things do they\nserve you and do they help you in what\nit is that you're trying to build so\num we're going to go through every\nsingle aspect of your life and see if it\nsupports the future that you want or if\nit holds you back and so one of the\nthings that\nI'll give you a great example that first\nthing that pops into my head is like\nalcohol for instance I think it's a big\nthing I've I've been talking recently\nwith a few people about it of like where\nhow interesting is it like alcohol is\nsuch an interesting thing and you know I\ndrink wine and stuff so I don't get\ntrash like I used to back in the day but\nI'll drink wine every once in a while\nbut I'm I'm always thinking about\nokay is this something that's holding me\nback I don't think it's holding me back\nis it serving me well there's certain\ntimes where I've given it up for quite a\nlong time because I felt like at that\nmoment it wasn't served me and it's okay\nto give something up and then go back to\nit and give something up and go back to\nit that's fine but\nI've been talking about how crazy it is\nwhere it's like I live in Austin Texas\nand on Thursday Friday and Saturday they\nshut down a certain part of Austin uh\nthey call it you know it's on 6th Street\nthey call it dirty six and they shut it\ndown and I was thinking how weird would\nit be to come down as an alien into\nstudy humans and be like hmm\nso they all take this poison they flavor\nthe poison because that's what this is\nit is a poison there's a toxin inside of\nyour body they flavor the poison so it\ntastes better and it changes the way\nthat they act it sometimes make them\nmore outgoing it makes them more sad\nsometimes it makes them happier\nsometimes and they all come together in\nthese certain parts of town so they can\ndrink the flavored poison and they do it\non the exact same nights every single\nevery single week and when they get\ntogether in Social environments they\ntake this flavored poison and sometimes\nthey they make new flavor poisons for\neach other they test these things out I\njust think it's such an interesting\nthing to think about but when you really\nlook at it as the fact that it is\nactually a flavored it is a toxin you\nknow when you take it it stays inside of\nyour bloodstream for up to 80 hours\nand then you start to look at it and I\nthink it's good for everyone to look at\nand say I don't think there's anything\nwrong with enjoying a drink one it's\nyour prerogative do whatever it is that\nyou want but you've actually got to\nstart looking and saying does it serve\nme right does it serve me is it am I\nusing it for good or am I using it for\nnumbing in some sort of way and\num you know am I am I using it the way\nthat I should be does alcohol serve me\nyou know same thing for like if you\nsmoke cigarettes do cigarette serve you\nsmoking weed just smoking weed serve you\nI don't care what you do I have\nabsolutely no judgment around anybody\nand what they do with their own life in\ntheir own body completely up to them but\nwhen you're looking at the life you're\ntrying to create does it serve you and\ndoes it help you or hurt you in going in\nthe directions you're trying to go you\nknow if you're trying to build a\nbusiness it might be beneficial just to\ngive up alcohol for six months give up\nweed for six months and then just see if\nthat helps you in some sort of way right\nso look at those types of things another\nthing that's really important that I\nwant you to think about as we go through\ntoday as well is people right when\nyou're looking at people that are in\nyour life are they serving you and help\nhelping you and motivating you and\npushing you towards your goals or are\nthey holding you back when you look at\nwhere you want to be in 10 years in the\nthe amount of money you want to have in\n10 years and the family you want in 10\nyears and the car that you want in 10\nyears and the houses you want in 10\nyears and everything that you want in 10\nyears the people that are around you\nright now are those people going to help\nyou in getting to creating the life that\nyou want or are they holding you back in\nsome sort of way are these people\nserving you and at the same time are you\nserving these people\nmaybe it's time to take a break you\ndon't have to kick him out of your life\nbut what if you take six months off hey\nI just you know I'm doing XYZ I'm just\ngoing to be focusing on myself for a\nlittle while\nokay think about the people in your life\nI got another idea what about your\nsignificant other\nare they on the same path as you are\nthey supporting you in every way do you\nsupport them a lot of people because of\nwhat I do I hear I'll I'm even though\nI'm I am a speaker and a podcaster and\nall this stuff and I focus on just\nmindset people like to message me as if\nI'm a therapist and they always ask me\nquestions and one of the questions that\nthey that I get asked\nprobably top three is hey Rob I'm I'm\nnew in this journey of personal\ndevelopment personal empowerment I've\nbeen doing it for a year two years three\nyears and I've noticed that my boyfriend\nor my girlfriend or my husband or my\nwife my significant other\nmakes fun of me for it they don't enjoy\nit how do I get them to start getting on\nthe path of of personal development and\nthe answer is you can't you can't force\nanybody to do anything but when you look\nat your significant other sometimes you\nget into a relationship with somebody\nbefore you get onto A New Path and\nyou've got to really ask yourself is\nthis person on the same path as me or\nare they on a completely different path\nI don't know the answer for you but it's\na really good question ask yourself are\nyou serving them in their personal\ndevelopment and the life path that\nthey're on are they serving you in every\nsingle way that they can and back and\nforth so like is your relationship your\nromantic relationship serving you and\nare you serving them right another thing\nthat's really important to think about\nthe food that you eat\nis a food that you're eating serving you\nin helping you get to where you want to\ngo is it giving you energy or is it\ntaking energy from you in the the things\nthat you eat the way that you eat the\ntimes that you eat your Fitness routine\nall of those things are they serving you\nthe food in the fitness routine are they\nserving you into going into the\ndirection to create the the life that\nyou want\nI don't know that's for you to kind of\nsit figure out and decide so food is\nanother thing to think about and\nthroughout all this process you guys can\npause me I'm going to be here forever if\nyou pause me literally I will be here\nforever you can just pause me and then\nwhen you're ready you can unpause me if\nyou need to journal through these if you\nneed to work through these all of that\nstuff okay what about your mornings what\ndoes your mornings look like do your\nmornings serve you\nyour morning routine does it serve you\nare you waking up and being intentional\nabout your morning are you journaling\nare you doing what is it you need to do\nlike my morning routine is pretty\nstandard I did today woke up went to the\nbathroom came outside drank a ton of\nwater did a 20 minute meditation then I\nmade some coffee went outside and uh\nwhile I was drinking my coffee journaled\nfor a little while right that's just\nwhat I found I like that's the mode that\nI'm in right now can I say it's going to\nbe exactly the same in two months or two\nyears no it could change does your\nmorning routine serve you in creating\nthe life that you want just something to\nthink about what about your evening\nroutine what about what you do\nthroughout the day\nwhat about how you make money does how\nyou make money serve you is it you know\nare you doing it just to make money and\nto pay the bills but it's hurting your\nmental health does it serve you in that\nway\nmaybe maybe not that's for you to decide\nhow you make money is it serving you is\nit helping you is it are is it line up\nis it alignment with the person you want\nto be in 10 years\nthat's something for you to figure out\nwhat about the environment that you live\nin you know your actual inside of your\ndomicile inside of your house the\nenvironment that you've created\nis it supportive of the life that you're\ntrying to create you know like one of\nthe things I always tell people is\npeople always go rob I just watch too\nmuch TV I watch too much Netflix I'm\nlike just take your TV off the wall and\nput it inside the closet for 30 days and\nsee what happens and they're like oh my\nGod I never thought of that before or no\nI can't do that like that's just an easy\nway to change your environment where\nit's like I'm spending too much time\nwatching TV all right well make it\nimpossible to watch TV\nnow what can you do right so your\nenvironment that you've built you've\nbuilt the environment inside of your\nhouse how can you build the environment\nto support you so maybe you're sitting\nthere saying I watch too much Netflix\nand I'm tired of watching so much damn\nNetflix\nI want to read more and get better at\nbusiness and start to to grow my\nbusiness and and so you think to\nyourself okay I could get rid of the the\nTV so I don't have any more Netflix and\nthen on the counter the coffee table\nwhere my TV used to be right in front of\nit I can just put a business book that I\nwant to read and then so every night\ninstead of watching two hours of Netflix\nI'm reading two hours of business books\nand acquiring knowledge of becoming\nbetter how can you design your\nenvironment to start to serve you in the\npath that you're trying to go down\nwhat about\num the let's say the the mindset that\nyou have does the mindset that you have\nhelp you or hurt you in the\nthe life that you're trying to build\nmaybe you've realized man I'm just way\ntoo negative I talk too much trash to\nmyself I'm my self-talk is through the\nit's in the right now right so\nare you positive enough are you too\nnegative are you too positive are you\nnot negative enough whatever it might be\nwhen you're looking at your mindset in\nthe way that you think and the way that\nyou act and the way that you perceive\nthe world does it serve you\nI don't know that's for you to decide so\nstart to go through your mindset what\ndoes your mindset look like what about\nthe music you listen to like even the\nmusic that you listen to can help you or\nhurt you right there's a lot of music\nwhen you actually start to listen to the\nlyrics you're like oh\nI'm just basically saying this out loud\nto myself and saying something out loud\nto yourself is a affirmation are you\naffirming the things that you want to be\naffirming\nso you start to actually think about it\nyou're like man\nI can go through every single aspect of\nmy life and start to remove the things\nthat do not serve me anymore and start\nto strengthen or bring in new things\nthat will serve me and to create the\nlife that I want\nif it doesn't serve you it doesn't\ndeserve to be in your life and people\nunderestimate\nhow much how much weight they carry in\ntheir mind how they're being held back\nby all these little teeny tiny things\nand how these little teeny tiny things\ndon't serve them any sort of way but it\nrequires your awareness first you've got\nto become aware and wake up to the fact\nthat's why I said in the very beginning\nsometimes part of the Awakening process\nis waking up Awakening to the point of\nlike yeah that\nthat doesn't serve me anymore Netflix\ndoesn't serve me anymore that\nrelationship doesn't serve me anymore\nand that process that the thought\nprocess in my mindset doesn't serve me\nanymore but it requires your awareness\nfirst and after it requires your\nawareness then you can start to design\nyour life\nand you design your life either\nconsciously or unconsciously either you\ncan make it happen or you can just let\nit happen to you and so what is\nimportant is grabbing a pen and paper\nworking through every single aspect of\nyour life that you can think of and then\njust ask yourself this very simple\nquestion with the life that I'm trying\nto build does this serve me\nwith the life that I'm trying to build\ndoes this serve me is it getting me\ncloser to or further from my goals and\nif you do that every single aspect of\nyour life you will rebuild a brand new\nlife and if you go on that path and fast\nforward a year two years five years\nyou're in a completely different place\nthan when you would have been if you not\nsit down and actually start to plan it\nup so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in it Rob dial
