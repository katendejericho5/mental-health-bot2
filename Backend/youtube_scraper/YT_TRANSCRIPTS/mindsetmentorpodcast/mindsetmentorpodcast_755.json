    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow your thinking actually changes the\nfunction and the structure of your brain\nthen we're going to specifically talk\nabout positive thinking and I'm not just\ngoing to sit here like some hey rah-rah\nwhen you think positive your life\nchanges like uh you know motivational\nspeaker that might not be based in\nscience and facts uh no I'm going to\nactually go over many\nscientific studies incite them to you to\nprove to you how you're thinking your\npositive thinking will actually start to\nchange the structure of your brain and\nalso the function of it as well because\nresearch has shown over and over and\nover and over again that positive\nthoughts actually have a profound impact\non the structure of your brain and in\nfact it's similar to you know if you\nthink of like physical exercise how if\nyou just\nwake up and at some point in time\nthroughout the day you work out you do\nsomething physical with your body\ngradually the changes in your that you\nwill have change in your body no matter\nwhat if you just work out every single\nday you will have changes in your body\nthe same exact way if you have certain\nspecific thoughts every single day or\nnew thoughts will have new thoughts will\nactually create new neural Pathways and\ncan disrupt the old Pathways and\npatterns that you have leading to\nLasting and real changes in your\ncognitive function and so to understand\nhow this this whole thing works let's\nfirst take a look at how your brain\nitself works so your brain is made up of\nbillions I think the numbers around 80\nbillion neurons which are these little\nspecialized cells that transmit\ninformation throughout the brain and\nthroughout the nervous system in these\nneurons are connected by something\ncalled synapsis which allow them to\ncommunicate with one another so when you\nthink a thought or perform a certain\naction your neurons will fire which\nmeans send an electrical signal from one\nplace to another your neurons will fire\nin a particular pattern that corresponds\nwith that thought or with that action\nyou know you may have heard before\nneurons uh that fire together wired\ntogether what the firing together means\nis they just send an electrical signal\nfrom one to another and so over time\nif you continue to do the same thing\nover and over and over again or you can\ncontinue to have the same thoughts over\nand over and over again over time\nrepeated patterns of thoughts of\nbehaviors can actually change the\nstructure of the brain that is inside of\nyour skull this is known as\nneuroplasticity which means that your\nbrain no matter how old you are can\nactually start to change itself and what\nallows your brain to adapt it's actually\nwhat allows your brain to adapt and\nchange to new things that happen inside\nof your life now it is easier to change\nyour brain as you're younger this is why\nkids can learn so freaking fast compared\nto like an adult and it's harder to\nlearn\nthe musical instrument it's hard to\nlearn a new language when you're older\nbut it doesn't mean that it's impossible\nit's actually not impossible but your\nbrain will start to rearrange and change\nitself you know if for instance if you\ndecide I'm going to start playing piano\nand you just play piano every single day\nand you've never played piano before\nareas of your brain will actually start\nto restructure themselves so that\nprocessing music will become easier and\nmore efficient for your brain you know\nthere's many studies of neuroplasticity\nthat show like for instance when you\nbecome a taxi driver in London in order\nto become a taxi driver you actually\nhave to memorize every single Road in\nthe city of London and what they have\nfound is they have measured people's\nbrains as they're going in in their\nfirst day on the job as a London taxi\ncab driver and they measure them years\ndown the road\nthey actually find that the part of\ntheir brain that is do that deals with\nmapping changes and restructures itself\nas they have to learn in actually rewire\ntheir brain to memorize uh certain parts\nof the the Streets of London so if if\ntrying to memorize a map of London or\nplaying a specific music instrument like\npiano can straight change the structure\nof your brain\ncan the thoughts that we think do the\nexact same thing and the answer is\nabsolutely 100 True yes it can when you\nconsciously focus on positive thoughts\nyou actually activate certain neural\nPathways that are in your brain that\ncorrespond to those thoughts and over\ntime if you think positively positively\npositively they become stronger and more\nefficient which makes it easier for you\nto access positive thoughts and emotions\nin the future now believe me I don't\nthink that just by like oh you know\nhit the fan I'm going to think positive\nall day long I don't want you to think\nthat that's what I'm talking about here\nbut it's a Viewpoint of how can I start\nto look at the world through a positive\nlens versus a negative lens we all know\npeople\nyou go and hang out with them and you're\nlike how are they so freaking positive\nall of the time like they're so happy\nthey're so positive I wish I was as\nhappy and positive of them well it's a\nhabit it's actually a function and\nstructure that has changed in their\nbrain but we also know people who are\nvery negative and it's really hard to\nbreak out of their negativity it is the\nexact same thing for them and so\nwhen you look at like\num positive thoughts positive thinking\nis often referred to as a brain workout\nin just like physical exercise your\nmuscles change and grow depending on\nwhat workouts you do well your positive\nthinking strengthens certain parts of\nyour brain it also weakens certain parts\nof your brain so then that brings up the\nquestion if positive thinking can change\nour brain in certain ways to make it\neasier to continue to think positive\nlater on down the road if we think\nnegative\nis it possible that when we think\nnegative over and over and over again it\nmakes it easier to continue to think\nnegative over and over and over again\nand the answer is yes ding ding ding\nabsolutely 100 true negative thoughts\nalso have a profound impact on your\nbrain as well when you consistently have\nnegative thoughts which I had for years\nand years and years I was a\nself-diagnosed pessimist for a very long\ntime\num I don't feel like that lives in me at\nall anymore it's actually hard for me to\nbe pessimistic and to not find the\npositive in things now but when you\nconsistently think negative thoughts you\nactivate very specific neural Pathways\nthat correspond to those thoughts in\nyour brain\nover time those Pathways become stronger\nand stronger and as you become stronger\nthey become more efficient which means\nit's easier to think negative than it is\nto think positive and so when you look\nat this negative thinking patterns can\nbe really hard to break right like\nthere's sometimes where it's you're just\nso pessimistic pessimistic and you've\nbeen for so long\nit's hard to break those patterns now\nyou understand why\nbecause they become deeply ingrained in\nthe structure of your brain now there is\ngood news though good news is that you\ncan disrupt these negative thinking\npatterns by by consciously focusing on\nsomething that is positive when you\nnotice something negative come through\nin your mind you can intentionally\nchoose to think differently you can't\nalways control your first thought\nbecause sometimes those first thoughts\nare just automatic thoughts but you can\nalways choose your second thought you\ncan activate different neural Pathways\nin your brain that correspond with\npositive thoughts when negative thoughts\nstart to come up and over time\nthe pathways that you go down become\nstronger in your brain and more\nefficient and when you stop going down\ncertain Pathways like the negative\nPathways they actually start to become\nweaker and your brain stops using them\nas much and so you might be sitting\nthere and you're like all right hippie\nis all this rooted in real science like\nit sounds good it sounds true but can\nyou actually prove it through real\nscience and the answer is yes I have\nfound many many studies I researched\nthese out of this podcast episode\nbecause I wanted to make sure that if\nthere's any doubters out there that this\nworks I can show you over and over and\nover and over and over again you ready\nfor this let's roll into it study number\none one study published in the Journal\nof psychiatric research found that\npracticing positive affirmations for\njust four weeks led to significant\nchanges in brain activity in areas that\nwere associated with self-processing and\nemotional regulation so for people that\nthink that positive affirmation just a\nbunch of woo-woo there's actual\nscience to prove that with just four\nweeks of positive affirmations it led to\nsignificant changes in brain activity\nand processing in the emotional\nregulation part of their brain in\nparticipants in the study reported\nfeeling less anxious and more\nself-confidence after practicing\npositive affirmations and these changes\nwere reflected in their brain activity\nwhen they did scans of their brains oh\nthat's pretty awesome all right study\nnumber one damn number two\nanother study that was published in the\nJournal of social cognitive and\neffective Neuroscience found that when\nparticipants were trained to focus on\npositive images instead of negative ones\nthey actually experienced changes in\nbrain activity in areas that were\nassociated with emotional regulation and\nattentional control and these changes\nwere still present six months after the\ntraining ended suggesting that the\neffects of the positive thinking can\nactually be very long lasting that's\nnumber two boom all right let's go for\nnumber three neuroimaging Studies have\nshown that positive thinking can\nincrease activity in prefrontal cortexes\nof people's brain which is the part of\nthe brain responsible for executive\nfunctions such as decision decision\nmaking planning and impulse impulse\ncontrol\nso positive thinking can actually help\nyou make better decisions there's study\nnumber three number four Studies have\nalso shown that positive thinking can\ndecrease activity in the amygdala which\nis the part of the brain that's\nresponsible for processing fear and\nother negative emotions so when you\nthink positive you actually start to\nchange and decrease the activity in the\namygdala which is the part of the brain\nthat brings fear and negative emotions\nthat's pretty damn awesome so that's\nnumber four number five a study\npublished in the Journal of cerebral\ncortex found that people who practice\nmindfulness meditation had greater gray\narea matter density\nin the prefrontal cortex of their brain\nwhich I just told you about a minute ago\nwhich is associated with cognitive\nfunction and emotional regulation so\npeople who actually practice mindfulness\nmeditations had greater gray matter\ndensity in their prefrontal cortex which\nmeans that they are better at cognitive\ncontrol and emotional regulation that's\nnumber five number six research has\nactually shown that positive thinking\ncan increase the production of\nneurotransmitters such as dopamine and\nserotonin both of them are feeling uh\nbring up the feelings of happiness and\nwell-being so when you think positive\nyou actually train your brain to release\nmore dopamine and serotonin dopamine\nmakes you feel good but it's also the\nmotivation molecule it makes you\nmotivated to work towards something\nserotonin makes you feel good for\neverything that you have in your life\nand that's associated with something\nlike gratitude so that's number six\nnumber seven Studies have found that\npositive thinking can improve cognitive\nperformance and tasks such as problem\nsolving decision making and your working\nmemory as well so positive thinking\nactually protects the brain and makes it\nwork better so that's number seven\nnumber eight a study published in the\nJournal of I'm gonna this up real\nbad psycho\nneuroendocrinology I think I got that\nright\npsychoneuroendocrinology found that\npeople who wrote about positive\nexperiences had lower levels of stress\nhormones cortisol these stress hormone\ncoders all than those who wrote about\nnegative experiences so even just\nsitting down in writing at the end of\nthe day what was positive that happened\nto you it will lower your stress hormone\ncortisol inside of your body so that's\nnumber eight number nine research has\nshown that positive thinking can improve\nphysical health outcomes such as\nreducing inflammation and improving\ncardiovascular health so hold on we were\ntalking about how positive thinking\nchanges your brain but now we're also\nseeing that research has shown that\npositive thinking can improve your\nphysical health it can improve\ninflammation in your body and reduce\nthat it can also improve cardiovascular\nso positive thinking actually improves\nthe cardiovascular health of your heart\nholy crap that's pretty wild if you\nactually think about it isn't it\nthat's number nine number ten\nneuroplasticity Studies have shown that\nthe brain is capable of changing and\nadapting throughout our entire lifetime\nin positive experiences and thoughts\nwill shape a more positive brain so you\ncan literally change your brain no\nmatter how old you are to be more\npositive\nand then last but not least let me just\ngive you a lot I could go over I found\nso many of these but I'm just going to\ngive you 11 of them because I just want\nto really hit home and make sure you\nguys understand this a study published\nin the Journal of Nature Neuroscience\nfound that people who receive positive\nfeedback during a learning task had\nincreased activity in the striatum which\nis associated with reward processing and\nreinforcement learning\nso\nhopefully I've made you a believer that\npositive thinking and being conscious\nwhen you are thinking negative and\nswitching it to positive will change\nyour brain will change your\nneurotransmitters which are the hormones\nthat go through your body as well and\nchange those and also start to change\nyour cardiovascular health as well\nit's really important to note real quick\nthough that this this isn't like a\ncure-all for all mental health issues\nsome people do have clinical depression\nsome people have something that is\nuncurable and I can't say like oh my\ngosh like just thinking positive is\ngoing to cure every single mental health\nissue but it's important to know that\nfor like 99 of people in the world\nactually changing your thinking will\nchange your brain in very drastic ways\nand so now we actually ask ourselves\nwell how do we actually start to become\nbetter and how do we make this a daily\nroutine so let me give you a few tips\nnumber one\npractice gratitude I gave you a couple\nof examples of how actually practicing\ngratitude writing down what you're\ngrateful for but also writing down the\npositive things that happen in your day\nwill start to change your brain so take\na pen and paper write down what you're\ngrateful for or close your eyes and just\nthink about the things that you had to\nbe grateful for\nthe second thing\nuse positive affirmations you know in\naffirmations can be this weird like\nwoo-wooy seeming things like oh I'm I'm\nI'm a perfect being and all of that\nstuff and sometimes our BS meter will go\noff when I talk about affirmations I\nalways say and this is my formula for\ncreating an affirmation is they need to\nbe true they need to be present tense\nand they need to be empowering true\npresent tense empowering so it could be\nlike I am capable of creating the life\nthat I want I fully believe that I'm\ngoing to create the wealth that I want\nto in my life whatever it might be\ninstead of saying like oh you know uh\nyou know money's flowing to me from all\nareas of the universe like sometimes\nthose can get a little bit corny\npractice true positive affirmations and\nas you start to do this you actually\nstart to believe in yourself more you\ncan make sticky notes you can place them\naround a house you could change the\nbackground of your phone change the\nbackground of your computer try to just\npractice being a little bit more\npositive tell yourself some positive\naffirmations while you're brushing your\nteeth in the morning and brushing your\nteeth at night\nnext one surround yourself with more\npositivity\nstart and part of that is start to get\nrid of people who are making you more\nnegative or start to you know if you're\nsitting there and there's people that\nare around you that are completely\nnegative how can you let go of them if\nyou're going home and you're watching\nmurder mysteries all night that's\nprobably not the most positive thing how\ncan you start to think about all of your\nexternal environment and how you make\ncan make your external environment\nhealthier for your mental health okay\nnext one practice mindfulness\nmindfulness meditation can help you\nbecome more aware of your thoughts can\nhelp you feel your emotions a little bit\nmore the\num the important thing to know about\npracticing mindfulness and to actually\ntry to you know try to do a five minute\nmeditation try to do a ten minute\nmeditation to try to actually do these\nis not to feel\ncalm\nthe point of meditation is to feel\nbecause all too often we're just running\naway from our feelings and so what if\nyou just sat down and just allowed\nyourself just to feel and then you\nbrought in all of that\nstuff that you're grateful for at the\nend of it and just see how that works\nfor you and last one is start to get\nbetter at your positive self-talk I\nalways say you would never talk to\nsomeone the way that you talk to\nyourself sometimes and so it's important\nto just remember just to be aware of the\nway that you're speaking to yourself and\nso those are five tips to help you on a\ndaily process uh of you know how to\nbring this into a routine practice\ngratitude use positive affirmations\nsurround yourself with positivity\npractice mindfulness meditations and\nthen actually use more positive\nself-talk versus negative self-talk and\num it's important to kind of wrap this\nup to realize that positive thinking is\na process it's not like something just\nlike a switch where you just flip it and\nyou're a perfect person you like I said\nyou can't always control your first\nthought but you can always control your\nsecond thought and as you start to use\nthat second thought more and more and\nmore the first thought that you don't\nwant actually becomes weaker and so it\ntakes consistent consistent effort it\ntakes practice but you can develop a\nmore positive mindset if you now are\naware that how do you think throughout\nthe day actually changes the structure\nof your brain it changes the function of\nyour brain it changes the health of your\nheart it changes the inflammation in\nyour body\nhow can you just be more aware to be\npositive instead of being negative so\nmuch so\nboom that's what I got for you for this\nthis episode this uh this beautiful\nepisode that I did a ton of research for\nyou guys on if you love this and you got\nsomething from it you're like holy\npeople need to hear this please do me a\nfavor just share it
