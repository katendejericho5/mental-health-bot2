    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow to fully step in to what could be\nthe most badass version of yourself and\nwhat we're going to talk about is the\nidea and I want you to play with me on\nthis the idea of creating what would be\nan alter ego for yourself to basically\npretend just as you did when you were a\nlittle kid that you are someone else the\nsame way that you could pretend that you\nare a princess and you fully believe\nthat you are a princess or you could\npretend that you are an astronaut and\nyou fully believe that you were an\nastronaut what would it look like as a\nfull-on adult to fully step into and\npretend for a day that you are a\ncompletely different person if you're\nsomeone who's extremely shy what would\nit be like to put on the costume of a\nconfident outgoing person when you walk\ninto Starbucks today to basically\npretend that you are someone else and\nit's like a mask if you can imagine\nimaginary Mass going on to you that you\nactually decide to put on because when\nyou look at the Greek word for\npersonality\nmost people think that our personality\nis set in stone oh it's just my\npersonality that's just who I am that's\nhow I've always been but personality the\nactual root word for personality comes\nfrom Persona which is the Greek word for\nthe actor's mask that they would wear in\na theater so all the way back in Greek\ndays the mass that they would put on\nwere called their personas and so when\nwe talk about your personality who you\nthink you are\nis just a mass that you're deciding to\nwear now\njust to be honest with you we are most\nof the time unconsciously deciding to\nput this mask on every single day you\nare unconsciously deciding to be who you\nwere yesterday every single day but you\nare making that decision to act the same\nway you've always acted to believe what\nyou've always believed to set the\nlimitations that you've always set so\nwho you think you are is just a message\nyou're deciding to wear there is nowhere\nwritten into the fabric of the universe\nthat you have to be who you currently\nare or that you will always be who you\ncurrently are that is just a set of\nbeliefs and all beliefs can be changed\nso then we go back to how can we start\nto change our beliefs about ourselves\nwell at any time you could literally\ndecide to be somebody else you can\ndecide I no longer want to be the person\nthat I have been I am going to be a\nbrand new person and Alan Watts you guys\nknow if you've been listening for a long\ntime one of my favorite quotes is Alan\nWatts says you are under no obligation\nto be who you were five minutes ago you\ncan just decide to release who release\nwho you are so you can step into\nbecoming a new person if you really want\nto and the idea of well I am this\nversion of myself and I'm going to\nslowly start to progress and step into\nthe version of myself that I want to be\nthe idea of a slow progression is the\nproblem because you can just decide\nliterally at any moment to just be\nsomebody else but your idea that it\ntakes time is the problem because if you\nthink that it takes time it will always\ntake time so how can you release who you\nthink you are so that you could start to\nstep into to who you want to become so\nwhen you're developing the idea of an\nalter ego it helps you find hidden\npotential to achieve your goals that the\nquote-unquote you who you think you are\nyour personality the quote unquote\nversion of you right now cannot achieve\nbecause it's not in your personality\nit's not who you are it might be\nsomething that is outside of your\ncomfort zone or it might just be like oh\nthat's just not what I do that's not who\nI am I'm not a confident person I don't\ngo after my goals I end up being very\nlazy blah blah blah blah it's all just a\nbunch of stories that are inside of our\nhead and we can decide to tap into\ndifferent sides of us depending on what\nwe need in different moments different\nsides of us different personalities\ndepending on what it is that we need so\nthat we can get past all of our\nperceived limitations because pretty\nmuch every limitation that you have\nexcept for very very few are perceived\nyou have talked yourself into believing\nyour limitations and this isn't some\nlike crazy weird oh type thing to do\nlike there's many famous people\nthroughout the years that have had alter\negos when you look at\nBeyonce Beyonce created her alter ego\nwhich was very famous Sasha Fierce and\nthe reason why she created this was\nbecause she was really shy and she\nwasn't confident as a performer but she\nthought Sasha Fierce I'm going to\ndevelop this Alter Ego so that I can get\npast all of my shyness and become a\nreally confident performer when you look\nat somebody like Lady Gaga she created\nuh Joe Calderon which was what she\ncreated as a way to express more of her\nmasculine side when you look at David\nBowie David Bowie had Ziggy Stardust and\nit was an alter ego that he created to\nhelp him achieve massive success as a\nmusician and to be more flamboyant and\nmore theatrical as a character which he\nended up taking on and putting it into\nhis own personality when you look at\nlike even all the stories that are\ncreated there's Bruce Wayne who has\nBatman there's Clark Kent who is\nSuperman and then probably the most\nfamous version that pops into my head\nwhen I start thinking about alter egos\nis when you look at Kobe Bryant Kobe\nBryant had the alter ego of the Black\nMamba\nand what happened was he decided at one\npoint in time that he needed to be a\ndifferent person and he needed to be\ndifferent on the court than he was in\nreal life he was a shy young kid he came\ninto the NBA and he was 18 years old and\nhe was the youngest person into the NBA\nand he was watching a uh a movie Kill\nBill back in 2003 and he realized that\nhe needed his his regular personality\nwhich is how he was working through\nevery single day and who he was and and\nthen he needed an on-court personality\nand he needed somebody that he decided\nneeded to be fierce and needed to be\nrelentless somebody who was literally\ngoing to strike you down at any moment\nand when you look at that you realize\nthat you could be a very sweet person\nyou could be a nice person but when\nyou're in competition like Kobe Bryant\nwas or you're in business or whatever is\nthat you want you can have a completely\ndifferent personality to step into and\nso with the idea of the Black Mamba\nit was a way for him to try to motivate\nhimself to get into the right mindset\nbefore games and this is what is also\nknown that motivated him to wake up and\nactually do workouts at four o'clock in\nthe morning because he thought to\nhimself okay the average NBA player the\naverage person in my competition is\nprobably waking up at seven eight nine\no'clock they're probably getting their\nfirst workout in around 9 10 o'clock and\nso his idea was you know maybe even if\nthey're doing two a days they might have\nlike a 10 a.m workout and they might\nhave like a 2 pm workout so what I'm\ngoing to do with the quote unquote black\nmom is going to do that is going to just\nbe fierce Relentless destroy anybody\nthat's in his way as I'm going to wake\nup at 3 30 in the morning and I'm gonna\nget a workout in at 4 a.m I'm gonna work\nout from 4 AM to like 7 A.M I'm gonna\nhave my breakfast and then I'm gonna\nhave my 10 a.m workout the same way that\nthey are and then I'll have my 2 p.m 3\npm workout as well so when they're\ngetting maybe you know at least one\nworkout per day\nsome of his competitors were getting two\nworkouts per day\nI'm gonna get in three workouts per day\nI'm gonna outwork every single person\nthere's a story that I heard about one\nof the NBA players and I've heard many\nstories about Kobe Bryant and how Fierce\nhe was and how he's just like the black\nmamba mentality\nand with the mava mentality was there\nwas one time where one of the guys was\non the court and he was warming up\nbefore a game and he noticed he got\nthere and he already heard somebody\ndribbling so he's about to play the\nLakers and Kobe Bryant's already there\nand he's looking at Kobe Bryant working\nout before the game and he's like I'm\ngonna work out longer than this guy and\nso he's working out on one side of the\nCourt Kobe Bryant's on the other side of\nthe court and this guy's working out\nhe's working out he's looking at him and\nhe's like man I'm starting like we have\na game tonight I'm actually getting\nreally tired it's two hours into my\nworkout he's drenched in sweat and he's\nlike I don't think I can I don't want to\nexhaust myself for tonight\nso he's like I got he looks over at Kobe\nBryant Kobe Bryant is completely covered\nand he's not running like just little\ntiny workouts like he's full-on Sprints\nhe's acting like he's in his game it's\nhours and hours and hours and hours that\nhe's going and eventually I was like all\nright I'm done we have a game tonight so\nI need to make sure I'm rested and then\nthey play the Lakers and the Lakers end\nup beating his team and he goes up to\nKobe Bryant after and he's like man like\nwhat was with that workout before and uh\nand he's like what it what like you were\nfull-on Sprints you were full on\neverything like I was I was working out\nand thought you were eventually going to\ncome off the court Kobe Bryant looks in\nthe eyes and he said I knew that you\nwere there and I wanted you to know that\nI'm never going to give up before you do\nI will Outlast you and every single\nthing that you do and most people can\nlook at Kobe Bryant be like yeah he\nsounds like a dick but you can also look\nat him and see like that is the mindset\nthat he had in every aspect of playing\nthe game which made him as great as he\nwas and it made him a gave him a right\ngave him a way to motivate himself and\nto become somebody else before the games\nand when he adopted this whole idea\nwhat he was able to do he said was able\nto find potential that was inside of him\nas a basketball player that he didn't\nknow just as quote-unquote Kobe Bryant\nyou know he was known for his intense\ntraining that he had after becoming the\nquote unquote black mamba in the way he\ncould maintain focus and mental\ntoughness on the court and he always\nattributed back to this mob mentality\nand there was actually an interview in\nGQ Magazine where they asked Kobe Bryant\nthey're like hey you know what is the\npoint of having this and he said the\neasiest way to think of it is it's it\nmakes it easy for me to separate my\npersonal life for my basketball life you\nknow he had three daughters so he would\nhe didn't want to be a moment mentality\nwhen he was with his three daughters he\nwanted to be able to be the person he\nneeded to be for them but then put this\nthis cape on this mask on whenever he\nneeded to be the basketball player and\nhe helped that that found that that\nfound he found that it was easier to\nmaintain calmness and focus under\npressure when he felt like he was\nwearing that mask and so\nwhat it really starts to boil down to is\nyou look at this is like it's not weird\nto do this many people are doing this\nhow can you start to create your own\nalter ego and that's what we want to\nstep into and start to talk about and so\nwhat I want you to think about is like\nwhat are the qualities and the traits\nthat you wish you had that you that\nwould help you succeed in whatever it is\nyou're trying to succeed at you know for\nsome of you guys listening you want to\ndevelop a super successful business or\nyou have a business you want to be more\nsuccessful what are the qualities that\nyou want to have when you sit down at\nyour computer when you walk into your\noffice when you walk into your store\nwhat are the qualities the the mask that\nyou need to put on in order to be the\nbest businessman or best business woman\nthat you can be and what are the\nqualities and traits that you wish that\nyou had\nbecause what happens is when you develop\nthis Alter Ego you can embody your best\nqualities and you start to create\nqualities that you wish you had if\nyou're not a confident person I'm here\nto tell you no confident person is born\nconfident confidence is something that\nis developed it is like a skill set that\nyou work on so if you want to be more\nconfident what would that look like what\nare the qualities that you want to bring\ninto yourself the confidence the\nfinishing what you start the nothing\ngets in my way attitude the no matter\nwhat I'm gonna get it done or if you're\njust like you know what I want to be the\nbest parent I could possibly be is there\nan alter ego that you can have for being\na parent can you can you be more more\nkind to your children can you be more\nloving what does that look like we have\nuh someone on our team in their alter\nego is the they call themselves The Love\nSergeant where it's like they want to be\nable to keep everybody in place and help\neverybody succeed and get better but\nthey want to do it through massive\namounts of love so it doesn't mean that\nyou just have to be a killer and just\nlike Mama mentality plow everybody get\nall out of my way any of those types of\nthings it's like what are the different\npersonalities that you want for possibly\ndifferent parts of your life\nthen you make a list of all these\nqualities that you want your altar ego\nto have\nthen what you must do is you must name\nit you've got to come up with a\ndifferent name when you look at like\nDavid Goggins David Goggins has what he\ncalls Goggins and you know that right\nthere is a pretty good idea of you know\nhe just went from David Goggins to\nGoggins and Goggins he says is the guy\nthat will run through anybody and will\nnot lose and so when you look at this\nguy running 205 miles and doing all of\nthese crazy ridiculous things the things\nthat to us humans that don't do these\ntypes of things are like that doesn't\neven seem like someone someone could do\nwell David Goggins doesn't feel like he\ndoes it he feels like Goggins his alter\nego is the one that pushes him through\nit and so really what it comes down to\nis you want to develop the skill set the\nqualities all of the stuff that you want\nhabits traits everything that you want\nthat that Alter Ego to have you want to\nname that alter ego and then what would\nmake it easier is to have a actual\nphysical tangible thing that can help\nyou remember it something that you can\nsee and something that you can feel so\nit could be like a really cool amazing\nring it could be a necklace it could be\nyou know a set of glasses\nthat you wear that reminds you to step\ninto that and the reason why this is\nimportant is because we're going to dip\ninto our old self multiple times\nhundreds of times a day and sometimes\nwhen you see the ring or you see the\nwatch you see the necklace or you see\nand feel all of these things or maybe\nthe the the glasses on your face\nit reminds you oh yeah hold on I'm\nstepping in my Alter Ego right this\nisn't just for famous people and for\nathletes you know I know an executive\ncoach and she used an alter ego to\novercome her fear of public speaking and\nbecome a super successful keynote\nspeaker so she had like who she was and\nshe was an executive coach and she\nhelped Coos and all of these things and\nshe wanted to become a speaker but she\nwas really afraid to get on stage so she\ndeveloped this Alter Ego of when I'm on\nstage I am this person and this person\nthinks this way acts this way feels this\nway this is the name that I'm going to\ngive this person and was able to start\nto get past her lack of self-confidence\nby developing this alter ego\nnow once again uh this will not be the\neasiest thing in the world your old self\nwon't die easy it will continue to come\nback over and over and over again and\nyou'll notice yourself slipping into\nfear sometimes you notice yourself\nflipping you know slipping into uh\nlimiting beliefs or\nthoughts that no longer serve you or any\nof that type of stuff in what you need\nto develop is a really clear and Keen\nsense of awareness you need to have\nawareness of when you're dipping back\ninto it and then what you need to do is\nyou need to practice\nputting on the cape putting on the mask\nstepping into that version of you when\nyou notice those limiting beliefs or\nthat negative self-talk or whatever it\nis the lack of self-confidence dipping\nin you have to practice what it would\nfeel like to step into being to that\nperson and what it's going to require is\nis massive massive amounts of repetition\nover and over and over again reminding\nyourself who you are what you stand for\nwho you are what you stand for and\nreally what it comes down to all of this\nin in my full on personal belief is\nthere's where you are in this world\nand there's where you want to be and I\nam more concerned like you need to do a\nlot of things to go from where you are\nto where you want to be but I'm more\nconcerned with who you are who you need\nto become in order to achieve the life\nthat you want is more important than\nwhat you need to do because if you\nbecome the person that does this the\nthings that need to happen the following\nthrough the being ruthless doing what\nyou say you're going to do waking up\nearly whatever it is when you become the\nperson that you need to become in order\nto achieve the life that you want\neventually you just start to do all the\nthings that you need to do and what it\nreally comes down to is you need to act\nas if if you wake up every single\nmorning and act as if you are the person\nthat has the life that you want with all\nthe habits traits qualities you do all\nof those things you will eventually wake\nup and you will be that person that\nwon't be something that you have to fake\nit anymore you don't have to fake it\ntill you make it you will eventually\nhave actually made it you will become\nthat person and the qualities of that\nperson will feel natural to you because\nthere has been so much practice and\nrepetition of being that person and if\nyou become that person you will\nabsolutely 100 as long as you don't die\nalong the way create the life that you\ntruly want and that is the benefit of\ndeveloping the alter ego so that's
