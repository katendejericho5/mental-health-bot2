    "transcript": "today I'm going to be giving you seven\ndifferent keys for better mental health\nthere's one thing that we've realized\nover the past few years is that mental\nhealth is something that\nit's gone down a lot for a lot of people\nthe average per the average amount of\nphone calls into the crisis hotline has\nliterally gone up three times three\nhundred percent from what it was a few\nyears ago and so with better mental\nhealth this is something that we all\nneed to concentrate on because we are\nthe ones that are in charge of our own\nmental health there's nobody else's job\nbut our own to improve our own mental\nhealth and so for today I'm going to\ngive you seven different uh keys to\nimprove your mental health so let's jump\ninto it number one if it still bothers\nyou after 24 hours speak up within 48\nHours okay\nsomething happens to you maybe you're in\na relationship with somebody and they do\nsomething and what you typically would\ndo is is take those feelings and push\nthem down and what you want to say you\ndon't say and you're just like I'm just\ngonna avoid it I'm gonna avoid this\nconversation because I know that it\ncould turn into a blow up and she could\nblame me for it and I could blame her\nfor and then it's just easier not to get\ninto it if something is still kind of\nlingering\nif it's still bothering you after 48\nHours you need to speak up within the\nnext 24 hours I'm sorry if it's still\nbothering you within 24 hours you need\nto speak up in the next 24 hours so if\nit bothers you after 24 hours speak up\nwithin those 48 hours because what it's\ndoing is it's showing you something\nI don't know what that something is but\nI do know something around that is\nignoring something does not make it go\naway ignoring something just puts it in\nthe dark puts it under the rug and you\njust keep putting things under the rug\nand under the rug and under the rug\neventually it's going to build up and\nyou're going to trip over that rug and\nso if there's something anything\nsomebody needs to you need to say\nsomething to someone you need to express\nsomething to somebody whatever it is if\nit still bothers you after 24 hours\nspeak up within 48 hours\nthat's number one number two get better\nexpressing your feelings\npart of being a human is having a large\nrange of emotion we can have the highest\nof highs we can have the lowest of lows\nwe all myself included everybody need to\nget better at expressing our feelings so\nwe need to express what's going on\ninside of us if you have anger let the\nanger out in a safe place if you have\nsadness let the sadness out in a safe\nplace if you have frustration let it out\nin a safe place stop holding it all in\nwe're holding on to so much of it like\nsometimes if you're just really pissed\noff if you're really angry if you're\nreally frustrated maybe what you need to\ndo is go to a kickboxing class maybe you\nneed to go to the gym maybe you need to\ngo to kickboxing class then go to the\ngym and then have that conversation like\nwe were just talking about a minute ago\nstop holding it in so much if your body\nis at ease when you're not holding it\nall in then it is at DIS ease when you\ndon't release it and so disease inside\nof your body can turn into disease in\nyour body and you might say oh my gosh\nthat sounds so woo-wooy and stuff well\nthere's an entire book on this called\nthe body keep score\nwhere a motion that is suppressed inside\nof you a motion that you suppress\nsuppress suppress actually turns into a\nlot of disease inside of the body right\nso don't apologize for expressing your\nfeelings now are there right ways to\nexpress your feelings the wrong ways of\ncourse but don't apologize for\nexpressing something that feels true to\nyou and don't let somebody else\ninvalidate your feelings simply because\nit doesn't line up the way they feel\nabout a situation and so one of the\nthings we can all do is just get better\nat expressing our feelings whenever\nsomething comes up\ntry to express it try to let it through\nif it's sadness you know there's so many\npeople that\nyou have so much grief that you are\nholding on to inside of you and you\nhaven't let yourself feel it somebody\ndied somebody left something happened\nthe way that she didn't want it to\nhappen you were neglected any all kinds\nof things and sometimes what we need to\ndo is we need to actually just let it\nall out\nokay so don't apologize for expressing\nfeelings express your feelings in a safe\nplace in a safe way and then also don't\nlet people invalidate your feelings so\nthat's number two\nnumber three\nget better at asking for help like we\nall need help at some point right and so\nmany people that I see so many people\ncome to me and they're just like I'm\nterrible asking for help I put\neverything on my back I try to do\neverything for everyone else and I'm\njust so terrible at asking for other\npeople to help me imagine that\neverything that you go through\neverything that happens to in your life\neverything that you do has some weight\nto it you know a fight that you have\nwith somebody it has weight to it\num a to-do list that's way too long has\nweight to it\num things that happen to your childhood\nhave weight to it and I'm sure I'm not\nphysical weight just imagine that it\nweighs one pound\nand you keep putting that one pound you\nknow each one of the things weigh one\npound you're putting into a backpack on\nyour back you're putting it into a\nbackpack in your back you're putting\ninto a backpack on your back and you\nkeep putting on more and more and more\nand more weight\nput it in your backpack you put in your\nbackpack you put in your backpack you\nrealize a year two years three years\nfive years down the road it's like\nyou're carrying a backpack that weighs\n300 pounds there are people\nin your life that are more than willing\nto help you take some of the weight\nbut you don't ask for help\nthat's why it feels so heavy that's why\nwe say it feels oh my gosh it just feels\nso heavy I don't know why at some point\nyou have to learn to drop the weight at\nsome point you have to reach out to\nsomebody and say hey I need help with\nthis I need help with the way that I'm\nfeeling at some point you have to drop\nthe weight and ask for some help\notherwise it's going to all come\ncrashing down I've been there before so\nmany people are have been there before\nyou have to learn to ask for help it's\nlike the phrase the mountains that you\nare meant to climb the mountains that\nyou are carrying you were only meant to\nclimb right the things that you're going\nthrough you were only supposed to climb\nthat mountain you weren't supposed to\ntake that mountain and put it onto your\nback and carry it with you all of the\ntime and so sometimes we just got to get\nbetter at asking for help and so if you\nfeel\nlike you need some help who is the\nperson in your life that you feel you\ncan reach out to that you trust more\nthan anything else and just be like hey\ncan I express can I get help can I vent\nto you can I talk whatever it is that\nyou need to do you need to learn at some\npoint in time that we just got to get\nbetter at asking for weight you can't do\neverything alone a lot of us think that\ndoing things alone is the only way that\nwe can do it is because sometimes we're\nthe only one that we could trust when we\nwere children there wasn't anybody else\nthat was helping sometimes you're taking\ncare of your parents when you're nine\nyears old 10 years old because they\ndon't have it all together\nwe've got to get out of that programming\nthat we've created on ourselves and to\nsay hey I've got to ask for some help so\nif you feel like there's something you\nneed to ask for help with\ngo and ask for help so that's number\nthree number four this is a big one\nstart treating yourself like someone\nthat you're responsible for taking care\nof\nlet me say that again because a lot of\npeople are not gonna it's gonna hit\ntreat yourself like someone that you are\nresponsible for taking care of stop\ntaking care of everyone else and just\nforgetting about yourself don't say that\nyou don't have enough time to take care\nof yourself make time if something is\nimportant to you if it's a priority you\nwill find time you will find a way to\nget it done the most important person in\nyour life is you now I've already\ntriggered some of you that are sitting\nout there that are like hold on but I've\ngot kids I've got a spouse I've got\nfamily I've got to take care of my mom\nI've got to take care of all these other\npeople how could I possibly be the most\nimportant person in my life because you\ncannot pour from an empty cup\nif you're just waking up and immediately\ngoing to helping your kids and then when\nyou're done with that you're immediately\nhelping other people and helping other\npeople and helping other people and\nyou're not helping yourself\neventually\nyou're going to run out eventually\nyou're going to run out of energy\nthere's going to be a breakdown there's\ngoing to be something that's going to go\nwrong\nso what does self-care look like to you\nwhat is what is taking care of yourself\nlook like to you and when I say\nself-care I don't mean like going and\ngetting your hair done now that's fine\nyou can definitely do that if that makes\nyou feel good I know it just me getting\nyour hair done or a massage or nails\ndone or facial any of those things all\nthose things are great\nbut like what I'm talking about really\ntaking care of yourself like real\nself-care I'm talking about things like\nmeditation\nsitting down and taking some time to\nyourself allowing yourself to feel to\nthink I'm talking about sitting down and\njournaling your thoughts journaling your\nemotion journaling what's been going on\nthroughout your day throughout your life\nI'm talking about working out\nyou know there's so many studies like a\nridiculous amount of studies that talk\nabout one of the key ways to hold off on\ndepression to push depression away or to\nget out of depression is to get your\nbody moving to get some form of workout\nor yoga or running or walking or\nmovement in general and so working out\nis a form of self-care\neating healthy is a form of self-care a\nlot of people when you're going through\na lot of stuff when you're carrying all\nthis weight when you're not asking for\nhelp when you're not expressing your\nemotions\nyou go to numbing and numbing can mean\nthat you eat food that's not necessarily\nthe food that's that's helping you and\nso eating healthy is a really high form\nuh high value form of self-care so\nmeditation working out eating healthy\nwhat does it mean to you for some of you\nmight be going on a hike in the\nmountains depending on where you live\nfor some of you might be going for a\nswim and doing laps every single morning\nso like what does self-care mean to you\nthat's something that you need to\njournal through you're serving no one\nwhen you're ignoring your self-care\nstress number four number five\nstop trying to escape your pain\nan attempt to escape pain ends in\ncausing More Pain by pushing it away and\nacting like it's not there it's only\ngoing to make it worse\nonly way past your pain is to go through\nyour pain to learn from your pain acting\nlike it's not there is not going to help\nyou looking away oh my gosh no no it's\nnot over there don't worry yeah I know\nI've been through some but it's\nokay like looking away numbing all of\nthese things don't make your pain go\naway it's like the way I like think of\nit is like the the parable where it's\nlike you know the guy's holding a a\nbottle of water\nhe's in front of a class and he says hey\nhow much do you think this bottle of\nwater weighs and they're like oh it\nweighs 10 ounces it weighs a pound and\nhe's like okay and he holds it there and\nhe says now how much do you think it's\ngoing to weigh on me if I hold this for\na few minutes\nwhat if I hold this for a few hours what\nif I hold this out in front of me this\nbottle of water that only weighs a few\nounces 10 ounces whatever it is and I\nhold it for 24 hours and I hold it for\n48 hours in two hours what's going to\nstart to happen my arm's gonna tire out\nmy body's going to start to fail from it\nthe weight of the bottle didn't change\nthe only thing that changed was how long\nI'm holding on to it so this bottle that\nI'm talking about the water that we're\nholding on to it it's only 10 ounces but\nwe hold it and hold it and hold it and\nhold it it's all of our worry it's all\nof our problems it's all of our stress\nit's all of our anxious thoughts we have\nto learn to be able to let all of it go\nwhat does it look like for you to let go\nto stop trying to escape the pain but to\njust work through it and let it go\nbecause acting like it's not there\ndoesn't make it there you're still\nholding on to it even if you're like I'm\nnot holding this water I'm not holding\nthis water I'm not holding this water\nyou're still holding the water and over\ntime the weight only starts to hurt you\nmore\nokay that's number five number six\nis more silence\njust more silence\nmore of it\nall too often we're so busy moving and\nmoving and moving and moving and moving\nand moving how we do this and have to do\nthis and I'm gonna do this and this this\nthis how can we just build more silence\ninto our life in your life can you\nfigure out a way to build more silence\nnow there's a part of you if you're an\noverachiever like I am that's like hold\non I'm so busy like I'm not where I want\nto be in life I've got to be productive\nI've got to succeed I've got to work\nI've got to get to where I need to go\nmore silence\nsounds like it's going to be holding me\nback from being more productive you've\ngot to find more time to just sit and do\nnothing yes now Rob 10 years ago would\nhave been like all right you woo-woo\ncreep just sit and do nothing that's not\ngoing to do anything for my life but as\nI've gotten older and I've started to\nwork through things in my life and I've\nbuilt a company and built relationships\nand built a team and all these things I\nrealize that silence just nothing\nis actually one of the biggest things\nthat you could do for your own Mental\nHealth\nfor me I never got it I always get into\nmy mom's car and she never had any music\non and I was like this is driving me\ncrazy we need some music on I was like\nhow do you do this and she's like\nbecause when I'm in silence that's my\ntime to think and I was like I can't do\nthat this is ridiculous and and then\nlike the past six months I get into my\ncar and I love music I'm a musician I've\nbeen obsessed with it since I was a kid\nI just don't listen to music as much\nbecause I allow that time while I'm\ndriving to just sit and think and\nprocess life and not feel like I always\nhave to be going going stimuli stimuli\nstimuli and so sometimes like this\nmorning this morning I woke up and I\njust sat on my couch this morning\ndrinking my coffee for a good 25 minutes\nI wasn't reading I wasn't listening to\nmusic I wasn't doing anything I was just\nallowing myself to Simply exist\nand I feel like that made me way more\ncalm to be able to do that so just try\nto put more silence into your life\ntry to put more silence take five\nminutes after this podcast I'm okay with\nyou turning this podcast off and when we\nget done here and taking five minutes\njust to sit and think and exist and\nallow your brain just to Simply calm\ndown a little bit so number six is more\nsilence\nnumber seven put your thoughts onto a\npiece of paper\nman I don't know how many people have\ntold me they'll send me emails they'll\ntalk to me send me a message on\nInstagram and say I heard you talk about\njournaling for you know for six months\nfor a year for two years three years\nthey've been listening to podcasts and\nthey just didn't Journal didn't Journal\ndidn't journal and they're like you know\nwhat one day I just decided to I thought\nthat it was dumb I thought didn't make\nany sense one day I just decided to put\nmy all my thoughts down on paper and I\nstarted to figure myself out more and it\nstarted to make my life easier and it\nstarted to make my brain work better and\nI started to actually put a plan\ntogether of how I was going to improve\nmy life and so life is so complex so\nridiculously complex you can't figure it\nout in your head sometimes sometimes\nyou've got to put it on paper you've got\nto see it you've got to let your brain\nrelease it because your brain now knows\nit's on paper and then you've got to\npick apart the pieces that you put on a\npiece of paper and say all right I need\nto you know what I need to fix this in\nmy relationship\nmy relationship has caused me a lot of\nstress Let Me journal through what would\nmake my relationship better you know\nwhat\n I've got a really tough\nconversation with her about XYZ this\nthing that happened that I don't feel\ngood about the way that happened or\nmaybe I'm seeing something that I did\nand I don't like the way that I reacted\nI need to go to horror nighting to\napologize that would make me feel like\nour relationship it was we worked\nthrough it so put all of your thoughts\ndown on a piece of paper and just start\nto work through that piece of paper I\nalways give the example of like if I\ngive you a complex math problem and I\nsaid figure it out you can't use your\nphone what are you going to ask can I\nhave a pen and paper at least why\nbecause it's easier to make a complex\nmath problem to work through a complex\nmath problem when you can see and it's\non paper your life your mind your all of\nyour relationships your business your\nfamily all these things are way more\ncomplex than a math problem\nso many variables exist in it when you\njust put it on paper it makes it so much\neasier to work through it so those are\nthe seven things that I want you to do\nseven keys to better Mental Health\nnumber one\nif it still bothers you after 24 hours\nspeak up within 48 Hours number two get\nbetter at expressing your feelings\nnumber three get better at
