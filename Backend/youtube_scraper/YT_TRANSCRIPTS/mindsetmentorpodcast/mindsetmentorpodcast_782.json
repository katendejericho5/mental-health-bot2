    "transcript": "but let me tell you a secret though the\nmost successful people in the world are\nalso the world's biggest failures like\nif you look at Walt Disney he was fired\nfrom his dream job as an animator\nbecause he lacked creativity when you\nlook at Michael Jordan he was cut from\nhis high school basketball team because\nhe wasn't good enough and he became the\ngreatest basketball player ever JK\nRowling who wrote Harry Potter she was\nrejected by 12 Publishers and that book\nwent on to sell 500 million copies in\nthe creator of Honda said that success\nis 99 failure so when you think of\nfailure just remember it's not the\nopposite of success it is actually a\npivotal part of success"
