    "transcript": "today we're gonna be talking about what\nthe hell do you want like what do you\nwant in this life what is it that is\nthat's the thing that you want and you\nknow I I ask people this all the time\nI'm like what do you want and most\npeople like oh well like I want to like\nI want to be like happy and I want to be\nable to have some more money and like\nit'd be nice to travel and stuff and\nit's so crazy to me that so few people\nknow what they want like they kind of\nhave an idea but there's no real like\nset this is what I want and it's funny\nbecause they're not really clear and\nthen they're mad that they don't have\nwhat they want even though they don't\nknow what the they want right like\nthat's pretty crazy if you think about\nit like you need to know\nwhat it is that you want and the more\nclear that you are and what it is that\nyou want the more likely you are to get\nit because you can start saying yes to\ncertain things and you can start saying\nno to certain things that don't line up\nwith it but the main reason why people\ndon't get what they want in life is\nbecause they don't really even know what\nthey want in life you know it's like I\nalways give the example on the podcast\nif it's like your mom calls you up\nbefore Christmas and she's like honey\nwhat do you want your want for Christmas\nyou're like oh I don't really know just\nget me something whatever you want and\nthen you open up your gift on Christmas\nand you're like pissed that she didn't\nget you what you wanted and she's like\nwell you didn't tell me what you wanted\nit's like the universe God whatever it\nis that you believe in is constantly\nasking you like dude what the hell do\nyou want\nthen you don't know but you're pissed\nthat you don't have it right so like\nwhat do you want like what is the reason\nwhy you're on this planet what is the\nlike when you die how will you be\nremembered have you ever thought about\nthat like and it's not like just\nmaterialistic or traveling or a certain\namount of money but like who do you want\nto be like what kind of character traits\nand qualities like when people are\ntalking about you what's your few your\nfuneral and the eulogy like what do you\nwant them to be saying about you and and\ncan you figure out what traits and\nqualities and characteristics you want\nin yourself and be very clear on those\nand remind yourself of them every single\nmorning so that you can start building\nyourself more into that person like what\ndo you want most people are saying\nthey're like I don't really know what I\nwant and because they've been told what\nthey're supposed to want their entire\nlives and it's like a skill set right\nit's like you're maybe you're so numb to\nwhat you want and your desires\nthat you don't even know what you want\nanymore and it's like going into the gym\nyou haven't used that that desire muscle\nin a long time\nyou haven't thought about your own\nVision a long time so you're kind of\nlike I don't know what I want okay well\nthen let's try to figure out what it is\nthat you want and can we start to build\nThat Into You now because when you're\nborn your baby like you know what you\nwant when you're hungry you cry when\nyou're in pain you cry when you wanted\naffection you cried like you knew what\nyou want and you were like give it to me\nright so what happened what happened to\nyou what happened to us somewhere along\nthe way we're told oh don't be selfish\nyou know you want to be you want to be\npresident oh that's dumb no one in this\nfamily's ever even graduated college\nwhen you don't come from a good part of\ntown nobody likes us you know we're not\neducated enough there's not that's dumb\nfor you to think that you could do that\nand you know somewhere along the way we\ngo from believing we can do anything\nand we can get anything that we want our\nlife to it's not even realistic to get\nanything that we want in life so\nsomewhere along the way somebody or many\npeople smash our dreams and tell us to\nbe realistic and just because somebody\nelse had their dreams and their goals\ndestroyed doesn't mean that they have\nthe right to do the same to you and it's\nup to us to ReDiscover why we're here\nand what it is that we truly want you\nknow people say oh yeah you want to do\nthat no you want to run your own\nbusiness no no get it get a real job\nthat's dumb you you don't want to run\nyour own business maybe you're you know\ngonna go to school and you want to do\nsomething cool like you want to be a\nmusician and your mom's like no no no\nyou have to go and you have to be an\nengineer and so you go and you be an\nengineer because your parents told you\nto or you're a doctor because your\nparents told you to the amount of people\nthat I know that reach out to me on\nInstagram\nand they're like Rob I feel so lost I'm\n37 years old I went to school for\nengineering I went to school for nursing\nor I went to school to be a doctor and\nit's not what I truly want and I feel\nlost because my parents told me that's\nthe thing I had to go to school for and\nI don't want to do it\nand it's so crazy to me and so sad that\nso many people\nI don't want to say wasted because\nthat's not the right word you don't\nreally waste years you just learn what\nyou don't want but they followed other\npeople's\nvision for their own future versus\nbuilding their own vision and so they\nwanted to be an artist so they wanted to\nbe a musician or they wanted to you know\nbreed horses or they wanted to make\njewelry or they wanted to do something\ncompletely different maybe they wanted\nto be on TV but they followed the\nquote-unquote realistic secure route\nif there's one thing that we've realized\nover the past few years\nsince covet hit is it the least secure\nthing that you could do is work for\nsomebody else\nlike what we thought was Secure within a\ncouple weeks became very unsecure right\nand so if secure is going to college and\ngetting a job the past few years have\nshown us that is actually the least\nsecure thing that you could do the most\nsecure thing that you could do is work\nfor yourself now I'm not saying everyone\nhas to work for themselves but if you\nare out there and you're like man I\nreally wanted to start that business but\nI decided to go the safe route it ended\nup not being the safest route because I\nwork for myself and guess what my boss\nis pretty awesome I can't fire myself\nright I can't get fired that's pretty\nawesome and so it comes back to like\nwhat do you want if money were no object\nand this is the thing that I've found\nwith a lot of people most people throw\naway their hopes and their desires\nbecause of money\nthey do\nthey throw it away and so like if I\nalways like to say it's like you know\nAlan Watts always says what would you be\ndoing if money were No Object like if\nmoney did not exist or you had all the\nmoney in the world you know the example\nI was give is like say you wake up\ntomorrow morning and there's 500 in your\nbank account some amazing person makes a\ngenerous donation of 500 million dollars\nyou're going to buy a bunch of stuff and\nhave some fun and buy some clothes and\nwatches and travel and some cars and\nsome houses and some planes but\neventually you're gonna spend 100\nmillion dollars and you're gonna be like\nwell what the hell do I do now right\nlike what would then be fulfilling to\nyou in your life because so many people\njust just give away their just give away\ntheir hopes and their dreams and their\ndesires\nto Simply chase money\nso it's like Alan Watts always says he\nsays if you work just to make money\nand you don't like your job and you're\nfollowing money then you'll just\ncontinue to be doing things that you\ndon't like doing in order to keep living\nwhich is to be doing things that you\ndon't like doing\nso it's better to have a short life\ndoing things that you love than to live\na long life in a miserable way\nand so what did you want to be as a kid\nwhat do you love to do now what\ninterests you what's your passion what's\nyour hobbies you know when you're a kid\nyou could be if you know you wanted to\nbe a fireman or a fire woman and you\nwant to be the first female president\nand you want to be a pilot you want to\nbe an astronaut or something cool and\nsometimes you want to be all of those\nthings in one day and you believe with\nevery single fiber of your body that you\ncould be all of those things in one day\nbut along the way\nthat is not quote unquote realistic and\nsomebody tells us we can't do that and\nso\nwe end up going the safe route and so\nthere's a part of you that still wants\nto do that that wants to do something\nthere's there's something in this world\nthere's a few things in this world that\nyou're probably made to do that you have\nultimate passion for that it's What\nYou're Made for your brain your body\nyour life circumstances perfectly line\nup to make you this person\nwhat is it what would you love to be\ndoing because there's a lot of unhappy\npeople out there that go the safe route\nand they think that's what they're\nsupposed to do and they wake up 10 20\nyears down the road\nand they're like where the hell am I how\nthe hell did I get here and that is\nreally what the reason why they called a\nmidlife crisis is because you wake up\nand you think what the did I do\nwith my life like why did I do this so\nif money were No Object how would you\nfill your time what do you love what do\nyou want to learn what do you want what\nskill set do you want to get better at\nlike is there a Hobby or something that\nyou you want to do what is your passion\nand the important thing to realize is\nthis is maybe you do find your passion\nyour passion can make you money\nsometimes your passion can become your\npaycheck and that's awesome if it is\npossible but for a lot of people your\npassion isn't your paycheck and that's\nokay as well so can you make a paycheck\ncan you make the money however you're\ngoing to make the money but then spend\nthe majority of your time doing\nsomething that you truly love you know\nlike if you if you live inside of the\ncity right now and you you live in the\ncity because you're trying to make money\nbut you just love mountain biking and\nyou don't get enough time to go mountain\nbiking and you don't get out of the city\nenough is there a way that you could\nfigure out whether it's with this job or\nanother job or working remote or\nbuilding your own business to be able to\nmove to a place that would allow you to\nhave the maximum amount of time mountain\nbiking now will you make money mountain\nbiking probably not you'll probably lose\nmoney because you'll spend money on all\nof the supplies\nbut if you live in the city right now\nand you really love mountain biking you\nhaven't been mountain biking in three\nmonths the hell are you doing\nfigure out a way to go out to places\nwhere you could spend the majority of\nyour waking hours outside of work\noutside of with your family to be able\nto do the thing that makes you feel the\nmost alive how do you know what your\npurpose and your passion is\nwell there's a couple different ways but\none of the ways is like what gives you\nthe most energy like when you get done\nif mountain biking is your thing right\nwhen you get done mountain biking after\na long day you could be exhausted but\nyou have so much energy from it like you\nfeel alive what are the things that make\nyou feel alive those are things that you\nshould be following and so\nit goes back to like ikigai you've heard\nme talk about ikiga before it's a\nJapanese concept where there's four\nquestions that you should answer and you\nshould just write down all of the\nanswers of anything that pops up number\none is what are you good at and you\nwrite down everything that you're good\nat number two is what do you love you\nwrite down every single thing that you\nlove number three what can you be paid\nfor you write down everything you became\npaid for and number four what does the\nworld need and you write down everything\nthat you feel the world needs and if you\ncan find the overlap of all four of\nthose that is what they call ikigai is\nyour reason for being it is your reason\nwhy you're on this planet the fifth\nquestion that I think is important that\nis never really asked is what is\nsomething or what are all of the things\nthat just really you're interested in\nlike what are you really interested in\nand so like for me like I just love\nlearning about people and about humans\nand all of this stuff and so like a few\nepisodes ago I did an episode on like\ntrusting your gut and I spent hours\nresearching like a nerd like I'm just I\nnerd out on these things of like what is\nwhat is it this there's 500 million\nneurons in the gut holy crap this is\namazing like I'm researching about the\ngut the second brain those people don't\nwant to do that for me it's just\nsomething that makes me super excited I\nwant to learn more about and so like are\nthere certain things that just kind of\nlight you up and can you figure out a\nway to make those things your profession\nmaybe maybe not but you know it's the\nway I like to think about it is this is\nthere's a phrase that talks about the\nhummingbird and the Jackhammer right\nlike for me what I do now making this\npodcast making videos on Instagram and\nYouTube and coaching people and doing\nwhat I do now\nI'm going to be doing forever like I\nhave a pretty good feeling this is\nwriting books all of this stuff is what\nI'm going to be doing forever\nfor some people their passion might be\nsomething they do for three years five\nyears and then they go do another thing\nfor three years and five years and so\nthe Jackhammer versus the hummingbird\nthis will give a lot of you guys some\nsome relaxation into life is like the\nJackhammer is a person that knows what\nthey want they know what it is they're\ngoing to be doing forever that's what I\nfeel like I am a hummingbird is somebody\nwhere you could you know hummingbird\nwill go from one flower to another to\nanother to another\nand they just kind of Bounce Around\nflowers\nsome people they have a passion they're\nvery passionate about something for\nthree years and then they just decide to\ngo to the next thing and that's fine and\nthen they go to the next thing and they\ngo to the next thing and they just get\nreally passionate about a couple things\nfor a couple years and then that's just\nwhat they do neither one is right\nneither one is wrong it's just really\nabout what makes you feel the most alive\nand so what do you want\nyou want to travel do you want to quit\nyour job and backpack Europe\nif you have a feeling that you want to\nquit your job and backpack Europe I'm\ntelling you right now do that as soon as\npossible in 2012 I backpacked Europe I\nquit my job you know I was 2012 I was 26\nyears old I was making really good money\nfor a 26 year old making like 150 175\n000 a year I saved up all of my money\nfor a year lived as cheap as I possibly\ncould quit that job and went to Europe\nand what was crazy about it was that I\nthought like I had planned it for six\nmonths and I so many people were like so\nwhat do you do for work and we talked\nfor a while and I was like yeah but you\nknow in three months I'm gonna be\nleaving and going to Europe I talk to so\nmany people and told them that I'm\ntalking like 30 40 50 60 people over six\nmonths told him I was gonna be doing\nthat older than me 40s 50s 60s not one\nperson\ntold me it was a bad idea to leave my\njob at 26 years old where I was making a\nbunch of money now one person told me is\na bad idea everyone was like oh my gosh\nI wish that I there's two things that I\nwould that I heard all the time number\none was oh my gosh that's an amazing\nidea I wish that I would have done that\nwhen I was your age that was the first\nthing I heard a lot the second thing was\nI did that and it was the best thing I\never did not one person over months and\nmonths and months told me it was a bad\nidea I went and did it\nstill\nsome of the best months of my entire\nlife right and I don't think I'd be\ndoing what I do now if I didn't do that\nbecause I realized on that trip like I\ncan't work a normal job I can't work for\nsomeone else I have to be location\nindependent I have to be able to travel\nI have to be able to move I have to be\nable to do whatever it is that I want\nand I realize that on that trip\nthen five years later I ended up you\nknow a couple of years later I ended up\ngetting her girlfriend and then my\ngirlfriend and I five years later in\n2017 backpacked for six months together\nand we were able to do it because we\nbuilt businesses that we could make\nmoney online and so what is the most\nsensible or reasonable or secure route\nis never actually that route it's like\nwhat do you want what is the thing that\nthat makes you feel the most alive and\nthat's what we really have to listen to\ndeep within ourselves because if you\ndon't follow it it's gonna bug you for\nthe rest of your life like if you wanted\nto go and travel and back out of Europe\nfor three months and you fast forward 20\nyears and don't do it now and you fast\nforward 20 years it's going to eat you\nup inside that you didn't do it it is\nnever a bad idea to do something like\nthat and so it's different for every\nsingle person this is podcast there's\nhundreds of thousands of you that are\nlistening to this podcast right now\nthere are hundreds of thousands of\ndifferent desires and hopes and dreams\nand passions and purposes\nI'm gonna tell you what I tell you all\nof the time is it's okay not to know\nwhat your passion or purpose is right\nnow but it is not okay to not be in\nconstant pursuit to find that and so why\nare you alive why the hell are you here\nwhat the hell do you want you've got to\nfigure it out you've got to decide what\nyou want and you've got to put every\nounce of energy into it because the last\nthing you want to do is not do it and\nthen find out too late that you should\nhave done it so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on the Instagram\nstories and tag me at Rob dial Jr\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r once again the only\nway that we grow is from you guys\nsharing this podcast and so if you would\nshare it I would love it and appreciate\nyou from the bottom of my heart so it\ncould content can can continue to keep\ngrowing uh and with that I'm leaving the\nsame way I leave every single episode\nmake your mission make someone else's\nday better I appreciate you and I hope\nthat you have an amazing day"
