    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nbecoming impeccable and first off what\ndo we mean by impeccability\num a quick distinction I want to make\nbefore we dive into it when I say\nimpeccable I do not mean perfect people\nthink that oh if I'm trying to be\nimpeccable what I mean is I'm actually\ntrying to be perfect I don't mean\nperfect in any sort of way and in fact\nthere is no such thing as perfect\nperfect does not exist and if you're out\nthere\nand you think to yourself well you know\nwhat I am a perfectionist I'm going to\njust give you some honesty we all think\nthat we're perfectionists we all do and\nuh your perfectionism does not exist\nperfectionism Perfection perfectionism\nis not real perfectionism is a mask that\nyou're wearing up to cover up a true\nfear and so we always tell ourselves\nlike I am a perfectionist that's the\nreason why I haven't written my book yet\nor finished my book when in reality\nyou're not a perfectionist you're just\nafraid that if your book is not perfect\nyou will be judged by people and so\ntherefore you haven't put it out not\nbecause you're a perfectionist but\nbecause you're afraid of being judged by\npeople or you say I'm a perfectionist so\nyou know my paintings they're I haven't\nput them out yet and it's like no you're\nnot a perfectionist you're just afraid\nof other people seeing your paintings in\nyour heart and soul that you put into\nthis painting being judged by other\npeople so your perfectionism does not\nexist your perfectionism is a mask that\nyou're wearing over your true fear of\nnot being good enough or being judged by\nother people or not being smart enough\nor\nthe possibility of being rejected or\nother people's opinions or dying alone\nor whatever it might be\nif you think you're a perfectionist we\nall think we're perfectionists and\nperfectionism does actually not exist\nwhat exists is the true fear that's\nbehind it and so when I say being\nimpeccable I don't mean being perfect\nimpeccability is not being perfect it is\nstriving to be the best you can be in\neverything that you do it means constant\nnever-ending Improvement if you look at\nthe Japanese word Kaizen\nk-i-k-a-i-z-e-n it is constant\nnever-ending Improvement just trying to\nget better is what I mean by impeccable\nand when I say impeccable I'm not just\ntalking about like the biggest things in\nlife I'm not talking about like being\nimpeccable at the biggest things in life\nI'm talking about being impeccable at\nall of the small things especially the\nsmall things I care more about the Small\nThings the little teeny tiny things that\nseem like they don't matter\nmore than I care about the big things\nbecause\nthe small things matter so much more\nyou know if you think about that the way\nyou do one thing is the way you do\neverything I say that all of the time\nand I love it because I always I hear it\npeople around me always saying it as\nwell it's like the way you do one thing\nis the way you do everything the way you\ndo one thing is the way you do\neverything so if you're trying to be\nimpeccable to be the best that you can\nbe at every single thing that you do\nthat's going to permeate into all other\nareas of your life as well if you're\ntrying to be impeccable with this set\nwith this rep of the workout that you're\ndoing that is going to permeate into\nyour relationships that's going to\npermeate into your business that's going\nto permanate permeate into your\ncommunication skills into your planning\nso I personally care more about how you\nshow up to the little teeny tiny mundane\nthings more than I care about anything\nelse because when you show up really\nwell to those things you show up well to\neverything in your life and this is\nsomething that I've been sharing with my\nteam\npersonally a lot over the past few\nmonths you know we have over 30 30\npeople that work for us at this point in\ntime and it continues to grow and grow\nand grow and grow and grow and their\nresults in the business\nwill equal the results and everything\nthat they have in life so their\nimpeccability and everything they do in\nthe business will go into everything\nthat they have in their life as well you\ncan't think that oh I'm gonna just you\nknow have a really great relationship\nwith my children but I also happen to\nhave like this this health Journey that\nI'm really not doing well at now if\nyou're not doing well at your health\nJourney parts of that are going to\npermeate into relationship with your\nchildren and so if the way you do one\nthing is the way you do everything you\nknow we can think about our health we\ncan think about our relationships we can\nthink about all these things but we can\nalso think about the things that we\ndon't really think about that often we\ncan bring them to Forefront of our minds\nso like\nI always say when you do something try\nto do it the best that you can and so\nlike if you're doing the dishes\nare you doing the best that you can like\nmost of the time when I'm doing the\ndishes I'm thinking to myself I\ndon't want to be doing the dishes like\nthat's the actual thought that's going\nthrough my head and then I think okay\nwell if I'm here and I am doing the\ndishes you know I'm going to try to do\nthese the best that I can I could just\nrinse them off and throw them inside the\ndishwasher\nwhich I do sometimes or what I could do\nis I could go okay you know what I could\ndo instead of just taking this dish and\nmaybe leaving this bowl that has oatmeal\non the side of it to quote unquote soak\nbecause you know we all think that we\nhave to soak something and and so we're\nlike well I'll just soak this this bowl\nof oatmeal crust on the side when in\nreality I could just pick something up\nand I could scrub it off right so it's\nlike when you have the dishes do you\nfinish eating and just throw your dish\ninside of the sink like I know some\npeople listen to this right now your\nsink looks like a bomb went off inside\nof it right so if you think about that\nlike the dishes whenever you get done\neating do you do you finish the task of\neating by taking the dish and doing what\nyou're supposed to do with it or do you\njust throw it inside the sink when you\nare deciding what you're going to wear\nin the morning\nand you're trying on different clothes\ndo you take those clothes and you try on\none shirt and if you've decided to try\nanother shirt but then the other shirt\nthat you were just wearing you throw on\ntop of you know the bed and now you have\n17 different t-shirts that are on the\nbed or do you take those shirts and you\ndecide to put them away and you're not\ngoing to be perfect in this but it's\nabout having yourself be a little bit\nbetter putting these things away when\nyou get up in the morning do you make\nthe bed when you tell somebody that\nyou're going to do something even if\nit's something really small do you do it\nwhen you say I'm going to be there at\nfour o'clock are you there at 403 or you\nthere a few minutes before four o'clock\nright the the showing up late like we\nall have friends that show up like\nthey're they're late to every single\nthing that they do and that being late\nto every single thing that they do\nshowing up a few minutes late is\npermeating into all the places in their\nlife and so if you're going to be there\nat four do you get there at 403 405 410\n415 430 for some of you guys out there\nor if you say you're gonna be there at\nfour are you there at 3 50.\nbecause the way you do one thing is the\nway you do everything\nyou need to figure out ways to be\nimpeccable you start thinking to\nyourself the way that you interact with\npeople are you trying to be impeccable\nand once again it's about progress not\nPerfection am I constantly trying to\nimprove of these things\nyou know the way that you talk with\nother people are you trying to pay\nattention and be impeccable with the way\nthat you speak to somebody else\nmore importantly are you trying to be\nimpeccable in the way that you speak to\nyourself you know some people you're\nreally great with other people you're\nloving you'll give them so many\naffirmations and then when you if you\nwere to take the conversations going on\nin your head\nit's like verbal abuse to yourself right\nwell the way you do one thing is the way\nyou do everything you could be really\nnice to other people but not nice to\nyourself what's that showing you\nyou know how often do you say you're\ngoing to do something as well and you\njust don't do it how many times have you\nsaid you're finally going to lose those\nextra 10 pounds and you don't do\nit\nhow long have you been telling yourself\nthat you're going to start that business\nthat you're so passionate about but you\nhaven't done it\nor how long have you been saying that\nyou're you you need to look at your\nbusiness and dive into the finances and\ndive into the P LS and dive into where\nyou can become better but instead you're\ndeciding to just defer that and not\ndoing it right how long have you been\nsaying that you're going to work on\nyourself and work and read 10 pages\nevery single morning but you're still\nnot doing it how long have you been\nsaying that you're going to have a\nmorning routine and start waking up\nearly but you're still hitting the\nsnooze button three times every single\nmorning how long have you been telling\nyourself that you're going to meditate\nbut you've been skipping it you've only\nmeditated once in the past three months\nlike you've got to really start to think\nabout this how long how many times\nyou've been saying that you're going to\ngo to the gym four times a week but you\nhaven't been in a gym in two weeks how\nmany times you've been saying that\nyou're gonna wake up and do some\njournaling and have a journaling\npractice\nbut you're not doing it\nhow many times have you said you know\nwhat I'm going to invest in myself I'm\ngonna buy some more books or I'm gonna\nhire a coach or I'm gonna go to some\nmore conferences but you haven't gone to\nanything or bought any books in the past\ncouple years\nyou've really got to start to think\nabout how you can become more and more\nimpeccable when you say you're going to\ndo something do you actually do it you\nknow when the the thing that drove me\nthe craziest in the the first company\nthat I owned and I would have you know I\nhad tons of sales reps like 40 50 100\nsales reps sometimes during during the\npeak hours or the peak months of the\nyear\nand I I hated that people would come in\nand they say hey I'm gonna do a hundred\nphone calls and then they'd walk out the\ndoor and they did 37 phone calls or they\nsaid I want to do 40 appointments this\nweek and they would do 11 appointments\nfor the weekend it started driving me\ncrazy that people were not doing what\nthey said they were going to do they\nwere not being impeccable with\nthemselves and so when you walked into\nwhat we called the bullpen it was the\nbiggest room where we run the team\nmeetings I literally printed out in huge\nletters I'm talking about it was like\nI don't even know it's probably a good\nfour feet wide and three feet high so\nwhen you walked out of the bullpen you\nsaw these this phrase above the door and\nit said follow through and that was it\nfollow through so then when every time\nwe had a team meeting I would say hey\nhow many people out there you said you\nwere going to do XYZ and you didn't do\nXYZ you said you're going to do this you\nneed to do this you said you were going\nto do this you need to do this where\nelse do you think that's showing up in\nyour life you've got to get better at\nfollowing through you've got to get\nbetter at following through you've got\nto get better at following through\nyou've got to stop making promises to\nyourself and then giving up on yourself\nbecause\ndo you give up on yourself if you think\nabout that if you think about just just\nthink about this for a second imagine if\nyou told somebody you were going to do\nsomething\nand then you didn't do it\nyou're going to break a little bit of\ntrust right and then imagine if you told\nthem a week later you're going to do\nsomething and you didn't do it you're\ngonna break a little bit more trust and\nthen a week later you told them you're\ngoing to do something you're gonna do it\nand you again and over and over and over\nand over and over again six months down\nthe road how much trust do you think\nthat person is gonna have in you\nyeah the answer rounds with hero it's\nzero they're gonna have zero trust that\nyou're ever going to say that that\nyou're ever going to do what you say\nyou're going to do\nso if that person is going to have zero\ntrust in you\nwhat about all of the times that you\ntold yourself you were going to do\nsomething you needed to do it you told\nyourself you were going to invest in\nyourself you told yourself you were\ngoing to read you told yourself you were\ngoing to go to the gym you told yourself\nyou're going to meditate you told\nyourself you were going to wake up early\nyou told yourself you were going to work\non yourself you told yourself you were\ngoing to start that business you told\nyourself you were going to lose those\nextra 10 pounds\nyou've been telling yourself and then\nnot showing up and telling yourself and\nnot showing up what do you think that is\ndoing to your confidence what do you\nthink that's doing to your trust in\nyourself if you can break somebody\nelse's trust that easily how easy do you\nthink it is to break trust in yourself\nbecause you're doing that to yourself\nsometimes 10 times a day\nif you told a friend you were going to\nshow up and you didn't over and over and\nover and over and over again\neventually break their trust I'm not\njust somebody did that to you imagine if\none of your friends told you they're\ngoing to do something they didn't and\nthey told you you're going to do\nsomething they didn't they told you to\ndo something they did it wouldn't you\neventually just stop trusting that\nperson\nit's the exact same with trusting\nyourself\nand the the key part of this is that you\ndon't have to be perfect but you have to\nstrive to be better every single day\nyou have to strive to be honest with\nyourself you have to strive to be honest\nwith other people\nyou have to strive to be as honest with\nyourself in every practice that you do\nthroughout your life now you might think\nto yourself well I said I was going to\ndo this thing and I didn't do that I\nbroke my trust immediately people start\nto guilt themselves they start to shame\nthemselves they start to feel bad about\nthemselves when in reality it's like hey\nokay\nI screwed up what am I going to make\nsure that I do in order to make sure\nthat I don't do this again and you make\nsmall little incremental improvements\nyou know if you were to say on a scale\nof one to ten one being like the\nabsolute worst and 10 being perfect\nwhere are you on being impeccable in\nyour life say it out loud to yourself\nyou're in a car say it out loud yourself\ninstead of four is it a five six seven\nlike actually say it out loud to\nyourself on a scale of one to ten\nwhere are you on being impeccable with\nwhat you say you're going to do say it\nout loud\nand then I want you to think about this\nwhat is it costing you in your life by\nnot being higher\nright so like if you said you know I'm a\nsix out of ten on the impeccability\nscale what is it costing You by not\nbeing at eight how much better would\nyour life be how much better would your\nrelationships be how much better would\nyour business be how much better would\nyour health be how much better would\nyour bank account be if you were at an\neight instead of a seven how much better\nwould your relationship with your\nchildren be if you are an eight on the\nimpeccability scale instead of a six\nbecause life is either hard now and easy\nlater or it's easy now and hard later\nmost of us choose easy now but if we\nchoose easy now it's always going to be\nharder later\nyou know so what is the future you\nmissing out on because you're coming up\nshort now\nwhat is your future family or your\nfamily in the future missing out on\nbecause you're not showing up for\nyourself what are your friends missing\nout on what's your community missing out\non what is the world missing out on\nbecause you choose to cut corners\nyou choose to cut Corners it's not\nsomething that happens just by\nhappenstance like no you are choosing to\ncut Corners to not show up to not be\nimpeccable\nand once again\nI don't really care about the big things\nI care about the small things because\nthe small things are easy to do they're\nalso easy not to do and so if you can do\nthe things that are the small little\ntiny things that are easy to go and cut\ncorners on\nlike that dish that has the Crusty\noatmeal on the on the inside of it if\nyou can choose to do those little tiny\nthings when they are done you will\nchoose to do the hard things the bigger\nhard things when they need to be done as\nwell and then all of those little things\nthe things in between and the big things\nwhen you actually execute on them will\nadd up over the next two three four five\nten years to being a completely\ndifferent life 10 years from today than\nit is right now but it starts with you\ndeciding that you're going to be\nfreaking impeccable with everything that\nyou say you're going to do\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it
