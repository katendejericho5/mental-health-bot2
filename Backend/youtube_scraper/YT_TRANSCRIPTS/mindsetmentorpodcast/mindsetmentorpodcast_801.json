email.com I'll send you\nsome extra tips and tricks to improve\nyour mindset to make your mind better\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nwhy change is so hard and I'm also going\nto take you through how to make it\neasier on yourself because in order for\nyou to create the life that you want\nyou're gonna have to change you know\nthat that's why you're listening to this\npodcast but there is no way around it\nyou have to change in order for your\nlife to change if you do not change your\nlife will not change it will be exactly\nthe same as it is now and a lot of\npeople I feel like in the world are\nthinking that their life is going to\nchange\nbut they don't have to do anything so\nthey're kind of just waiting for their\nlife to change versus actually going out\nthere and physically making a change and\nit's kind of like Einstein says to do\nthe same thing over and over again\nexpect it for results is the definition\nof insanity and so there is a\npsychological cycle that you will go\nthrough through almost any change that\nyou go through and that's what we're\ngoing to go through today there's two\npsychologists psychologist Don Kelly and\nDaryl Connor developed a model that\ndeals specifically with the emotional\naspects of change and emotionally how\nyou will feel as you're in these\ndifferent stages that you go through and\nchange and if you can understand this\nand number one every time I teach this\npeople are like oh my God I feel so seen\nlike I feel like I finally understand\nmyself so if you can understand what I'm\ngoing to teach you and while you're\ngoing through these stages you can\nidentify where you're at and what stage\nyou're in it makes it so much easier to\ncontinue to push through and instead of\ngiving up which is what we usually end\nup doing and so this cycle of change\nchange is actually called the emotional\ncycle of change and inside of the\nemotional cycle of change there are five\ndifferent stages that you're going to go\nthrough and you know there's a graph\nthat has to do with it the easiest way\nto think of it for those of you that are\njust listening to the podcast is it's\nkind of like a you so if you can just\nimagine a u I'll take you through all of\nthe different stages of the emotional\ncycle of change and you can use this to\nunderstand yourself\nand to anticipate all of the emotional\nresponses that you will have as you\nstart to go through change and by\nunderstanding each of these stages in\ndetail you can better prepare yourself\nand have you know tools to cope with\nyour changing emotions as you go through\nit so if you can imagine we're at the\ntop left of the emotional cycle of\nchange the top left of the you and so\nwhen you think of top to bottom the top\nis how you're feeling so at the top\nyou're feeling optimistic and amazing at\nthe bottom you're feeling pessimistic\nand so at the top of the U is stage one\nwhich is called uninformed optimism in\nthis stage you're really excited about\nchange in this is why Everyone is always\nso excited whenever they're starting off\non some Venture is because they have\nuninformed optimism\nit's you're excited about it and you\nhave optimism because you're not really\naware\nof the difficulties that you're going to\nface ahead and this is the reason why\neveryone's so excited whenever they\nstart something new but eventually they\ngo into the other stages and decide to\ngive up if you're one of the people who\nusually starts if like I always hear\npeople say this all the time I'm really\ngood at starting stuff but I'm really\nbad at finishing you're going to\nunderstand as we go through these\ndifferent stages but the reason why\nyou're excited at the beginning is\nbecause you're in stage one and that is\nuninformed optimism\nthe one thing that you can do here a\ntool that can help you as you start to\ngo through these emotional stages is\nwhen you're feeling optimistic and\nexcited is to make yourself a list of\nthe benefits that you hope to achieve\nbecause when it comes it's going to come\nback to you're going to want to give up\nat some point in time and it goes back\nto the quote which I'll tell you again\nlater on in this episode which is when\nyou think about quitting remember why\nyou started now that you're at the\nbeginning and you're in that uninformed\noptimism make a list of all of the\nbenefits you hope to achieve all of the\nreasons why you're excited about taking\nthis journey and making this change so\nthat you have something to remind\nyourself of later on when things start\nto get hard and at this first stage\nyou're going to be filled with\nexcitement you're going to be filled\nwith enthusiasm and you see all of the\npotential benefits of change you see how\nyour life is going to be amazing with\nthis change\nbut\nthe reason why it's uninformed optimism\nis because you're looking at all the\nbenefits but you haven't yet experienced\nany of the costs of your change this\nstage of uninformed optimism you're just\npositive you're just excited things are\namazing things are great and we're at\nthe top left of the U and you imagine\nall of the benefits but you don't see\nany of the costs and everything in life\nhas a cost\neverything has a cost you know for you\nto decide that you want to delay your\nhealth there's a cost to that later on\ndown the road and there's a cost to\neverything negative and positive that\nyou have in your life and so when you're\nat this stage you're looking at all of\nthe the stuff in the optimism of all of\nthe benefits but you're not like any of\nthe costs but then you don't stay there\nvery long the excitement starts to fade\nthe more that you learn that you're\ngonna have to grow and change which then\nbrings us to stage two you're dropping\nabout halfway down the U and now you're\nin something called informed pessimism\nyou now know what you didn't know before\nand with that new knowledge you're\nstarting to get pessimistic and as\nchange progresses negative emotions may\nstart to arise and eventually you start\nto see some of the difficulties that are\ncoming up and the benefits don't seem as\nreal and you start to see the costs more\nthan you see the benefits so you're\nseeing more of the costs of what you're\ngoing to have to do and change and how\nyou're going to have to change how your\nlife is going to have to change but you\nsee less of the benefits and this stage\nis really characterized by frustration\nanxiety and really is where you start to\nfeel the desire to quit you start to see\nthe changes humans are uncomfortable\nwith change that we have to make and you\nstart to think maybe I can't do this\nmaybe this isn't what I thought it was\ngoing to be and as all of this reality\nsets in the positive emotions that you\nhad before quickly turn to pessimism and\nthe benefits can seem less real they\nseem like maybe they're not even\npossible they're not as important as\nthey used to be and the costs become\nreally really apparent and this is where\nyou will start to question yourself\nyou'll start to question the benefits if\nthe benefits that you'll get from\nsuccess or from whatever it is that you\nwant are worth all of the effort you're\ngonna have to put in\nthis you're going to start to question\nall of the things that you were doing\nbefore\nnow all of this informed pessimism\nsounds pretty terrible right it couldn't\npossibly get any worse right oh no no no\nit does it gets into my favorite stage\nwhich is the bottom of the you which is\nstage three and you go from\nuninformed optimism to informed\npessimism to stage 3 what they call the\nvalley of despair\nthe good thing about the valley of\nDespair is it is the lowest point of the\ncycle and this is a stage where you're\ngoing to experience the pain of change\nand the benefits seem way too far away\nand they seem unimportant the easiest\nthing to do in the valley of Despair is\nquit and this is what most people do\nthat's why people are so good at\nstarting and so terrible at finishing is\nbecause they get into the valley of\nDespair and then they start again and\nthey get to Valley despair they give up\nthey start again they give into valid\ndespair they give up and they start\nagain and it's easy to want to quit and\nreturn back to your old ways of doing\nthings the lowest point of the emotional\ncycle of change is the valley of Despair\nand this is where you're going to give\nup or where you have given up in the\npast and where you're most most likely\nto give up this is where you're going to\nfeel\nthe pain of the change and the benefit\nseems so far away they seem unimportant\nit's just easy to go back to doing what\nwe were doing before and the problem is\nthis is if you decide to give up here\nyou're eventually going to start\nsomething new whether it's six months or\nyear two years three years down the road\nyou're going to start something new and\nin that starting something new you're\ngoing to go through the exact same\nemotional cycle of change and so you\nmight see something and be like oh my\ngosh that looks so much better I don't\nwant to do this anymore but whatever you\nstart the next time you're going to go\nthrough the exact same process and this\nis the reason why the grass looks\ngreener on the other side is because\nwhen you're in the valley of Despair\nwhen you're deep in the valley of\nDespair and you're looking at something\nelse you get shiny object syndrome\nyou're looking at as at a patch of grass\nthat's so green in your mind of\nuninformed optimism back at stage one\nthe problem is if you quit at stage\nthree you're gonna have to start at\nstage one at something else and you're\ngonna go from stage one to stage two to\nstage three you're going to eventually\nend up in the valley of Despair with\nanything new that you start so if you\ndecide that you want to give up because\nit seems too hard and something else\nseems easier the reason why that thing\nseems easier is because you're coming at\nit with uninformed optimism you're\ncoming at it looking from stage three of\nwhere you currently are to stage one of\nsomething else you will eventually go\nthrough stage two in stage three of that\nnew thing it's so much easier to give up\nit always is easier to give up but if\nyou give up you're going to have to go\nback to stage one of whatever the new\nthing is when you think about quitting\nthough remember why you started this is\nwhy in stage one it's really important\nto make a list of the reasons why you\nwant to do this because when you get to\nyour lowest of lows you want to look\nback at that list and say that's right\nthat's what I'm doing this for right now\nthe good thing about about the valley of\nDespair is you're at your lows you're at\nthe rock bottom of your emotional cycle\nof change now it starts to look up we\nstart to go back up the other side of\nthe U which is stage four\ninformed optimism look at this at this\nstage the possibility of success\nincreases and this is where you are\ngoing to actually see the road that\nyou're on and you're actually going to\nbecome more optimistic you're going to\nsay I know what I know I know what I\ndon't know I know what I need to do I'm\nstarting to feel really proficient at\nwhat it is that I am doing and I'm\nstarting to get optimistic at it and\nyou're starting to like success actually\nstarts to seem a whole lot more possible\nit's like you're getting your legs under\nyourself you're getting better at it\nyou've screwed up a whole lot of things\nbut you're starting to feel a little bit\nbetter at it and the benefits of the\nactions that you're taking are now\nstarting to show you're starting to see\nthe benefits of your actions and the\ncost\nactually starts to seem worth it things\nare starting to seem easier\ndoesn't seem as tough as it did before\nand now you're starting to see a little\nbit of the fruits of your labor and this\nis where it's like the you know God or\nthe universe or whatever it is that you\nbelieve in starts to throw little\nbreadcrumbs at you like hey man\nhey lady you're on the right path like\nyou're doing well hey here's a little\nbit of success you know you're growing a\nbusiness it's like here's a couple\ncustomers here's a little bit you know\nhere's a big account for you and you're\nactually starting to see the fruits of\nyour labor and you're starting to go huh\n maybe I can do this there is light\nthat is at the end of the tunnel we're\nstarting to get there and it this is one\nof the most important stages you can be\nin because it informed pessimism stage\nfour you're starting to see all of the\nplaces where you were all of the places\nyou still need to go all of the\nimprovements that you've made all of the\nimprovements that you still need but\nyou're starting to become more\noptimistic of like hey\nI actually think that I could do this\nand I actually think I'm going to be\nsuccessful at this and that's stage four\nand then\nwhat we all want we all wish we could go\nfrom stage one to stage five\nbut you can't you've got to go through\nstage two stage three stage four but\nstage five is success and fulfillment\nsuccess is in fulfillment is the final\nstage of the emotional cycle of change\nthis is where all of the benefits of new\nBehavior are finally fully experienced\nand the cost of Change Is Now perceived\nas worth it like the cost that seemed\ndamn I don't know if I could do this at\nstage two in stage three you look back\nand go I'm so glad that I pushed through\nI'm so glad that I did it it doesn't\nseem worth it until you cross the finish\nline and then you cross the finish line\nyou go\noh man I'm so glad that I do did that\nand the actions that were once really\ndifficult for you are now routine like\nit it's not hard to do the things that\nyou need to do because it's now a\nroutine there are literally habits that\nare built into you\nand finally with success and fulfillment\nyou're getting to the point where you're\nlike that was worth it I'm so glad I did\nthat and you continue to keep working\nyourself in order to become better and\nthe important thing to remember is this\nwe all want to go from stage one to\nstage five\nit's not going to happen that way you\ngot to go from stage one to two to three\nto four to five and so the important\nthing and what you're probably asking\nyourself when you're out there listening\nme and talk about this okay if I'm going\nto go to stage two and stage three what\ndo I need to do in order to get myself\nto stage four and stage five\nso glad that you asked that question\nbecause the most important thing that\nyou can do when you're in stage two in\nstage three knowing that you're going to\nnot feel very good is to take action\nevery day even if it's just a little bit\nof action towards the goal you're trying\nto achieve take a little bit of action\nregardless of how you feel you should\nknow that you're going to feel\nunmotivated you're going to feel like\nyou can't do this you're going to feel\nlike maybe this isn't going to work out\nyou're going to feel like giving up but\nregardless of how you feel you take\naction in the direction of where you're\ntrying to go that is the most important\nthing that you can do and so it's not\nabout like hey I hope I feel good today\nit's like hey I'm going to take action\nno matter what instead of trying to be\nmotivated focus on being consistent\nwaking up doing what needs to be done\nregardless of how you feel the most\nsuccessful people in the world do not\nwait until they feel good until they\ntake action they take action every\nsingle day\nto give them a chance of actually\nfeeling good because when you go into\nstage two and stage three there's a\nchance that you're probably not going to\nfeel super excited you're not going to\nfeel super stoked but as you start to\nget a little bit closer and a little bit\ncloser a little bit closer you start to\nfeel better about yourself\nit's like Tony Robbins always says\nprogress equals happiness and so if\nyou're trying to get better and trying\nto improve and you feel like you're\nimproving just a little bit every single\nday you'll start to become happier start\nto become more motivated you'll start to\nsee light at the end of the tunnel\nand you'll go from the bottom of the U\nback up to the other side of the top of\nthe U and you'll eventually go to stage\nfour\nand then you'll eventually time will\ntell how long it's going to take it\ncould take a year two years five years\nten years\n20 years I don't know what it's going to\ntake because I don't know what it is\nthat you're trying to be successful at\nbut eventually you will get to stage\nfive which is success and fulfillment\nand you'll only get there when you\ndecide that you're not going to give up\nso that is the emotional cycle of change\nyou will go through it whenever you do\nanything different whenever you start to\nhave any changes and if you can\nunderstand your emotions it makes it so\nmuch easier to know hey I'm here I'm\ngoing to be working through this stage\nand this is what I need to do I need to\ntake the right action I need to be\nconsistent I need to make sure that I'm\nmoving myself a little bit further into\nthe direction that I would need to be\nevery single day so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please do me
