    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast today we're going\nto dive into the five steps that you\nneed to take in order to be more\nself-disciplined now when we look at\nself-discipline the phrase discipline\nmakes us automatically think that\ndiscipline is a bad thing right if your\ndog poops in the floor you discipline\nyour dog if your child does something\nthey're not supposed to do you\ndiscipline your child and so there tends\nto be a bad connotation around\ndiscipline but when you really think\nabout self-discipline\nif you've been listening to me long\nenough I always say that self-discipline\nis the highest form of self-love because\nyou never have to have discipline to do\nthings that aren't good for you you only\nhave to have discipline to do the things\nthat are good for you right like you\ndon't need discipline to eat an entire\nthing of ice cream no you just do it\nbecause that's easier\nyou need discipline to go to the gym\nthough don't you that's self-love you\ndon't need discipline to sleep in you\nneed discipline to wake up so that you\ncan have your morning routine that's\nself-love and so when we talk about\nself-discipline\nfirst thing I want to cover is that\nbecoming more self-discipline is one of\nthe highest forms of loving yourself\nmore and so I'm going to talk about how\nto be more disciplined the way I think\nof discipline is I think of it like a\nmuscle like with me I think that I'm a\nquite a disciplined person I'm not the\nmost disciplined person in the world\nbut when I was younger there was no\ndiscipline in this body of mine I was\njust a lazy tub of ice cream and food\nand alcohol that's what I used to be\nright discipline is a muscle the more\nthat you work out a muscle your biceps\nand the more that you you know the more\nweight that you give that workout the\nbigger those muscles will get same thing\nworks with your discipline if you're not\na disciplined person today you're not\nborn with discipline it is something\nthat you become better at so discipline\nis a muscle discipline is a habit how\ncan you become more disciplined because\nnobody is born disciplined\nfor me like I said I used to be\nextremely undisciplined and I developed\nit over years so you don't need to be\ndisciplined at the easy things in life\nyou need to be disciplined on the hard\nthings the things that should be done\nand discipline is not about being\nperfect\nwhen you think about discipline it's not\nabout being the most perfect version of\nyourself it's like James Clear always\nsays every action that you take is a\nvote for the person that you want to\nbecome\nso if you start thinking that way you\nrealize that in order to win an election\nyou don't need a hundred percent of the\nvotes you just need the majority of them\nso as long as the majority of your\nactions are heading in the right\ndirection\nyou're going to be much better than if\nthey're heading in the wrong direction\nand a really good question to ask\nyourself before I give you these five\ntips whenever you are doing something\nyou've got to ask yourself this question\nis what I'm doing right now getting\nmyself closer or further away from my\ngoals is what I'm doing right now\ngetting myself\nthe actions that I'm taking in this very\nmoment is it getting me closer to or\nfurther away from my goals it's getting\nyou closer to your goals continue on\nthat action if it's getting you further\naway from your goals stop and start\nmoving towards the things that will help\nyou get closer to your goals so it's\nabout winning more than it's about\nlosing not about being perfect because\none thing that I know is when somebody\nthat wants to be perfect messes up in\nsome sort of way a lot of times they end\nup just crashing the plane because then\nthey start guilting them they get all\nguilty and they start creating shame\naround it you should have done this no\nno you're gonna up it's okay but\nwhen you do use that as a lesson to\nimprove so let's dive into it\nthe first tip are the five tips to be\nmore self-disciplined is try to\nchallenge yourself to finish everything\nthat you can like everything every\nlittle tiny thing that you can when you\nstart something\nfinish it\nbecause the way you do one thing is the\nway you do everything and that that goes\nfor the big things in your life\nbut also goes for the small things in\nyour life because what you realize as\nyou get older if you know as I've been\nin this self-development game for 17\nyears is I've come to realize that it's\nnot really the big things in life that\nchange my life it's the little tiny\nthings done consistently every single\nday and so if I can tell myself the way\nI do one thing is the way I do\neverything and to try to get those\nlittle things done\nusually I'm going to end up being better\nso like an example would be let's say\nthat you\ncook some dinner screw it let's not even\nsay you cook down say you go for\nsomething real easy say you wake up in\nthe morning you make yourself some\noatmeal you put the oatmeal inside of a\nside of a bowl you put some water in it\nyou throw it inside the microwave it's\non for I don't know 90 seconds you eat\nthat and you could immediately go and\nyou could take that bowl of oatmeal and\nyou go man that bowl you know these oats\nthey're sticking on the inside of that\nbowl now you know what I'll do I'll put\nit inside of the the sink\nand I'll put the water in because you\nknow I've got to soak it I've got to\nsoak it to get that off the side\nright you could do that\nor if you want to try to finish every\nsingle thing that you do and ingrain\nthat into being the type of person that\nfollows through what's the best thing to\ndo take an extra 15 seconds\nget the scrubber scrub off the oats and\nput that thing you know dry it off and\nput it back where you found it that's\nthe way to finish everything it might\ntake an extra 15 seconds but you're\nstarting to develop the discipline of\nfinishing everything that you start\nyou know let's say that you're sleeping\nyou wake up and maybe your spouse is\nalready out of bed or maybe you sleep\nalone\nyou could wake up and you could just\nimmediately go on about your day but you\nwant to finish the act of sleeping\nso what do you do you make your bed just\nlike you finish the act of eating you\nwash the dish you dry the dish off you\nput it away when you finish the active\nsleeping you make the bed it's these\nlittle teeny tiny things when you can\nstart to train yourself to do the little\nteeny tiny things every single time it\nmakes it easier to start to finish all\nthe big things that you do so develop\nthis mindset of whatever I start I'm\ngoing to finish don't allow yourself to\nstop early because stopping early is\nalso a habit too you want to develop the\nhabit of following through on everything\nthat you do so that's the first thing\nfirst thing is to challenge yourself to\nfinish everything the second thing is\nsomething I find a lot of people are\nreally really bad at\nplanning ahead some form of time\nmanagement thinking ahead of what's\ngoing on so let's say that you\nyou're on this fitness journey right you\nwant to lose some weight or you want to\ngain some muscle or you want to get\nhealthier whatever it is you could\nyou know\nwalk into the gym and go well what's my\nworkout going to be today well I'm going\nto go from this thing to this thing and\nI'm going to go from this and you just\nkind of flow with it you can flow with\nit if you want\nor you could know when you walk into the\ngym exactly what your workout's going to\nbe for the day oh it's buys and tries\ntoday up it's back in chess today and\nyou could say to yourself This is these\nare the exact movements that I'm going\nto be doing on Monday Tuesday Wednesday\nI'm taking Thursday off Friday Saturday\nthese are my movements that I'm doing\nthis is exactly what I'm going to do\ntaking Sunday off as well it makes it\neasier to go in and execute when you've\nplanned ahead\nnow let's say you're trying to build\nmuscle you're trying to get some some\nmuscle on that scrawny little body of\nyours right okay I'm going to need extra\ncalories I'm going to need extra protein\nyou could walk into the kitchen and just\ntry to figure out what you're going to\nbe eating or you could plan ahead and\nsay I need this amount of protein I need\nthis amount of calories over this many\nmeals this is what I'm going to eat in\nthe morning this is what I'm gonna eat\nat lunch and this is what I'm going to\neat get going to eat in the evening and\nyou can if you want to just wing it but\nif you really want to get disciplined\nand help yourself in execution\nplan ahead and so that's the next tip is\nto make sure that you plan ahead in as\nmany things as you can tip number three\nis to design your environment one of the\nbest ways to get really good at\nexecuting and to be more self-discipline\nis to design your environment to make\nexecution of whatever it is you need to\ndo easier so let's say for instance that\nyou are trying to build muscle like\nwe're talking about why don't you design\nyour environment to remove any\nTemptation that you Temptation that you\nmight have around something or if you're\ntrying to lose weight why don't you take\nout everything that has too much sugar\nor if you're trying to get off of\nalcohol and to not drink for 30 days why\ndon't you hide every alcohol bottle so\nthat you don't see it you don't have to\nthrow it all away I don't care if you\nthrow it all away but if you hide it out\nof sight out of mind you're usually not\ngoing to think about it as well and so\nyou start to think if I'm going to be\nmore disciplined as a person how can I\nmake it easier on myself like I could\nmake it harder on myself\nor I could just make it easier okay I'm\nnot going to drink alcohol for 30 days\nbecause I've never done that before and\nthat's something I want to do remove all\nthe alcohol from site and you're just\nnot going to think about as much if you\nhave friends that like to go out and\nparty\ntell them the next 30 days you can't go\nout and party whatever you can do to\nstart to be more intentional and design\nyour external environment to do so let's\nsay you want to get more disciplined and\nyou don't want to read or you want to\nread more and not watch as much TV\nreally simple way to design your\nenvironment take your TV off the wall\nfor 30 days put it inside of a different\nroom or put it inside of a closet and on\nyour coffee table put out books\nthat alone is designing an environment\nthat used to be made to watch TV inside\nof your living room to now you have an\nenvironment that is designed to reading\nand so it just makes it easier to get\ninto the Habit to take the right actions\nwhen you design your environment\ncorrectly so when you look at what how\nyou want to be more self-disciplined ask\nyourself this question how can I design\nmy environment to take that to make\ntaking that action easier on myself\nsimple that's number three\nnumber four\nthis is a tip that one of my bosses a\nfew years ago you know eight nine years\nago gave me and she used to have it on\nher wall and it said progress not\nPerfection and done is better than\nperfect\nwhen you mess up make adjustments don't\nshame yourself don't make yourself feel\nguilty when you mess up and something\ndidn't go exactly the way that you\nwanted it to maybe you tried not to\ndrink alcohol\nand somehow alcohol slipped into your\nface right like that's just happened\noops I just opened my mouth and alcohol\nfell in okay you could you know beat\nyourself up and hate yourself and shame\nyourself you could do all those things\nor maybe you wanted to not eat sugar and\nyou had a moment of weakness and you ate\nsugar instead of when you mess up just\nbeating yourself up make small\nadjustments okay\nlet me take a step back I had a moment\nof weakness\nI up what can I do to make sure\nthat doesn't happen again because what\nmost people do is they just we shame\nourselves we guilt ourselves I should\nhave done better what did I do wrong I\nscrewed that up I always screw this up\nman I'm never going to be able to create\nthe life that I want or the body I\nwanted the mindset I wanted the business\nthat I want and we start to beat\nourselves up instead of beating\nourselves up we will we do take a step\nback and make adjustments just take a\nstep back dude chill out stop being such\nan to yourself chill and we go\nokay I messed up it's I have been doing\nreally good it's about progress not\nPerfection you know let's say that you\nyour your goal is to work out every day\nfor the next 30 days and on day 13 you\ndidn't plan accordingly\nyou got 12 days in you get all 12 days\nday 13 you screw up what happens\nnormally people get pissed off\nthemselves they shame themselves damn it\nI always do this\nand they focus on the one time they\nscrewed up versus the 12 days in a row\nwhere they actually had progress It's\nabout progress not Perfection remind\nyourself of how well you've been doing\nyou see your moment of weakness you see\nwhere you screwed up make adjustments so\nthat you can make sure that you try to\nget around that again so you take a step\nback you see what happened you stop\njudging yourself and you make a plan to\nget it done so that's number four focus\non progress not Perfection and number\nfive reward yourself\nright like if your goal is to try to to\ntry to\ndo incredible with your health over the\nnext 30 days\ngive yourself a cheat meal every once in\na while it's a lot easier to go like if\nyou're like I'm gonna eat really healthy\nfor 30 days\nif at one day you have if you know at\nday 15 okay I'm gonna go on this 30 day\nJourney\non day 15 I'm gonna get one cheat meal\nand that one cheat meal is gonna be I\ndon't know it's gonna be a big ass pizza\nand it's gonna be\ntwo margaritas whatever it is right then\nwhat happens is day one through fourteen\nI'm like I gotta be disciplined I got to\nbe disciplined I got to be disciplined I\ngot to be disciplined because I'm gonna\nhave a reward on day 15. day 15. we go\nballs to the wall margaritas and pizzas\nand all of that fun stuff so that\nit's so much that I'm like you know what\nI need another two weeks off and then\nover those 30 days I had one crazy meal\nwhere I had a whole bunch of fun and I\ngot everything that I wanted but I got\nmy fill\nnow I can go for another 14 days and so\nhow can you develop a system of actually\nrewarding yourself you know when I used\nto do another example completely\ndifferent when I used to do a hundred\nsales phone calls right we would do 100\nsales phone calls one of my managers\ntaught me how to do this and he would\nsay he was like hey what's your favorite\ncandy I was like Skittles he's like okay\nI want you to buy a bag of Skittles I\nwant you to bring them to the office\ntomorrow I'm like okay cool he goes okay\nwhat I want you to do is I want you to\nput three Skittles out in front of you\nanother three Skittles out in front of\nyou another another another another\nand every single time that you get 10\nphone calls done\ngive yourself three Skittles and you get\nanother 10 phone calls done give\nyourself three Skittles and I started\ndoing this over and over and over again\nand it drove me to take the action that\nI needed to take because I wanted the\nSkittles and I got the 10 phone calls\ndone I eat three skills oh my God that\nwas so good okay I can't skip ahead let\nme go ahead and get another 10 done and\nit was like breadcrumbs it kind of made\nme keep going on my way to success and\nso can you develop a system of actually\nstarting to reward yourself for taking\nthe action that you need to in order to\ncreate the life that you want to\nwhatever it might be whether it's the\nSkittles every 10 phone calls or whether\nit's the cheat meal once a week or\nwhatever it is that kind of is the\nrewarding so that you can go damn it you\nknow what I'm doing really good okay let\nme keep on this path and you use this\nit's actually called a dopamine reward\nsystem your brain actually works better\nwhen you have a dopamine reward system\nthey've actually found that people will\nactually be more motivated to work out\ntomorrow\nif at the end of the workout today they\nhave a tiny piece of chocolate not an\nentire bar of chocolate but a tiny piece\nof chocolate it seems counterproductive\nto be able to have chocolate right after\na workout but that little bit of\nchocolate is a dopamine reward system\nfor your brain which makes your brain\nmore likely to want to work out tomorrow\nso how can you develop a reward system\naround everything that you do so those\nare the five things that I got for you\nto be more self-disciplined but one\nchallenge yourself to finish everything\nnumber two plan ahead number three\ndesign your environment number four\nfocus on progress not Perfection number\nfive make sure to reward yourself so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on the Instagram stories
