    "transcript": "so you want to make this the best year\nof your life right and you think to\nyourself if I want to make this the best\nyear of my life I should probably read\nsome books but then that comes with a\nquestion what books should I read well\nme personally I've read over 200 books\nin the past 17 years non-fiction books\nfrom science books to success books to\nbusiness books to spirituality books to\nmoney books and if I were to go back and\nonly read three books to make it the\nbest year of my life these are the three\nbooks that I would read and I'm going to\ngive you my favorite takeaways from each\nof these books the first book Is Think\nand Grow Rich I can honestly say that\nwhen I read this book back in 2006 it\nchanged my life because it made me\nrealize that there were steps to being\nsuccessful before I read this book I\nalways thought that rich people were\njust Rich because they were born with\nsomething but when I first read this\nbook I realized that there were certain\nsteps that when I took them it would\nalmost guarantee my success and my\nbiggest takeaway that I want to give you\nfrom this book is the six steps to\nachieve any goal that's what we're going\nto go over right now step number one is\nto figure out and get very clear exactly\nwhat it is that you want and so instead\nof saying I want to lose weight get very\nclear on exactly how much weight you\nwant to lose what you want your body fat\npercentage to be at hell even print out\na picture of the person who has the body\nthat you want so that you can fixate\nyour mind on that goal the second step\nis to figure out exactly what you're\nwilling to give up in order to achieve\nthat goal so if weight loss is the goal\nthen what you want to make sure of is\nwhat you're going to give up maybe it's\nsweets maybe it's alcohol maybe it's\ndrinking on the weekends with your\nfriends whatever it might be you need to\nbecome very clear on what you're willing\nto give up in order to achieve the goal\nthat you want to achieve step number\nthree is to figure out the exact date\nthat you're going to hit that goal by so\nthat you give yourself a deadline step\nnumber four is to create a definite plan\nthat you're going to follow so if weight\nloss is the goal for you what it would\nlook like is how often often you're\ngoing to work out what you're going to\ndo in your workouts what you're going to\neat and then come up with a meal plan of\nexactly what it's going to look like and\nmaybe even do some meal prepping in\norder to get there Step number five is\nto develop a clear and concise statement\nthat summarizes one two three and four\nthis clear and concise statement would\nbe probably a maximum of about five\nsentences and then step number six is to\nread this out loud to yourself every\nsingle morning and every single evening\nwhat I would recommend is doing\nsomething called habit stacking so while\nyou're doing something like brushing\nyour teeth which is something you're\nalready doing you're going to be reading\nthis statement to yourself every single\ntime you get done brushing your teeth so\nyou're going to do it in the morning and\nyou're going to do it at night so\ntherefore you're reminding yourself the\nexact plan of how you're going to hit\nyour goal and this book is crazy to go\nback and read 17 years later because\nwhen I look through it almost every\nsingle page is highlighted in it's\nunderlined it's written in and you can\nsee that this book was just something\nthat completely changed my entire\nperspective of Life the first time that\nI read it so read this book read it\nagain and then read it once more the\nnext book is the one thing by Gary\nKeller and Jay Papasan the reason why I\nrecommend this book is because too many\npeople are focused on trying to do too\nmany things it goes back to the Chinese\nproverb which says if you try to chase\ntwo rabbits at one time you'll catch\nneither one too many people have a plan\na they have a plan B and they have a\nplan C that's not going to work it goes\nback to what Will Smith said there's no\nreason to have a plan B Because Plan B\nwill distract from plan a when you look\nat the most successful people in the\nworld they had one plan and they put all\nof their eggs in one basket if you take\nLeBron James for instance he didn't play\nbasketball when he was younger during\nthe week and then play volleyball on the\nweekend just in case basketball didn't\nwork out no he put all of his intentions\n100 of his effort into one thing and one\nthing only and the reason why this book\nchanged my life when I read it was\nbecause I had two businesses at the time\none of them I had an Amazon company that\nwas doing really well and on the other\nside I had my coaching business and I\nwas putting 50 of my effort into both of\nthem trying to make them both succeed\nbut after reading this book I asked\nmyself a really important question if I\nfast forward my life 10 years from today\ndo I want to be known as the guy who's\nrunning an Amazon business or do I want\nto be known as a guy who has a coaching\nbusiness and is changing people's lives\nthat made it really easy to decide what\nI wanted to do I didn't want to be the\nAmazon guy I wanted to be the guy who\nwas coaching people and changing\npeople's lives so I shut down the Amazon\nbusiness and I put 100 of my focus into\nmy coaching business and that is when my\nbusiness actually exploded and my\nbiggest takeaway from this book is their\nfocusing question and that question is\nwhat is the one thing I can do such that\nby doing it will make everything in my\nlife easier or unnecessary essentially\nwhat is the biggest lever that I can\npull in my life right now to make my\nlife better because all too often we're\nfocused on our entire to-do list versus\nlooking at our to-do list and looking at\nthe one thing that's going to make the\nbiggest difference in our life and\nexecuting on that one thing on the to-do\nlist and pushing everything else aside\nso if you want to be massively\nsuccessful read this book and focus on\none thing and one thing home in your\nlife and the last book is a book called\nTalent is overrated I rarely hear people\never talking about this book but it goes\nback to a phrase that my very first\nMentor used to always tell me hard work\nbeats Talent when talent doesn't work\nhard so when you look at that phrase you\ncan see this across many different\nplaces in life for instance if we take\nfootball as an example there's always\npeople like JaMarcus Russell who came\nout was supposed to be the number one\npick he was the number one pick he was\nsupposed to be an amazing quarterback in\nthe end of being done but you can also\nsee other people who weren't talented\nbut they put in the work people like Tom\nBrady he was picked number one 199 in\nthe draft and became the greatest\nfootball player that's ever played why\nbecause he worked harder than everybody\nelse reason why I love this book is\nbecause it shows you it doesn't matter\nhow talented you are doesn't matter\nwhere you come from and it doesn't\nmatter what your skill set is right now\nbut if you work your butt off you can do\nanything that you want to in this world\nand my biggest takeaway from this book\nis something that he calls deliberate\npractice deliberate practice every\nsingle day and what deliberate practice\nis is sitting down and practicing\nsomething that is 20 outside of your\nskill set so for instance if you want to\nbe an amazing guitar player when you sit\ndown to play every day don't play what\nyou already know play stuff that's a\nlittle bit outside of your comfort zone\ndeliberate practice should make you be\non the edge of what you're comfortable\ndoing at all points in time that is how\nyou improve your skill set so those are\nmy three books that I recommend that you\nread this year so what's a book that I\ndidn't mention that you think should be\nin this video go ahead and comment it\ndown below so that everybody watching\nthis video can end up getting more books\nto add to their list and to be honest\nwith you I want to see your favorite\nbooks so I can add some extra books to\nmy list as well"
