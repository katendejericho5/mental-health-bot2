    "transcript": "but motivation sucks though like you\ndon't want to be motivated because\nmotivation is an emotion it's fleeting\nit's here sometimes it's gone sometimes\nwhat you want is you want to be driven\nlike motivation is like a spark but\ndrive that's like the big log that you\nput on the campfire that burns for hours\nso if you're searching for motivation\nwhen you wake up in the morning like\nyou've already lost the battle you don't\nwant to wake up and be motivated you\nwant to wake up and be consistent you\nwant to wake up and be driven so how do\nyou become more driven towards something\nyou have to have a strong why like why\nyou're working towards that goal\nsomething that has to be important\noutside of you your children your\ncommunity your family because when your\nwhy is strong enough to how will reveal\nitself the how to get off your butt and\nget it done just becomes so much easier\nwhen you already have the why"
