single week so if you\nwant some extra tips and tricks to\nimprove yourself go ahead and follow me\nthere all you have to do is type my name\nRob dial and it will pop up today we're\ngoing to be talking about the psychology\nof money why\nif I'm being honest money messes with a\nlot of people for me I would say that\nmoney dominated my thoughts for like the\nfirst 32 years of my life where\nobviously it wasn't like all I was\nthinking about all day long was only\nmoney but it was like it dictated the\nway I thought about the world or\ndictated the way I took actions in the\nworld everything that was happening to\nme and um you know when you grow up and\nyou don't have money like we were uh\nwhen I was younger we didn't have any\nmoney my mom applied for us to be on\nfood stamps and was rejected because she\nhad a car and supposedly you can't have\na car in food stamps for some reason you\nknow we didn't really take family\nvacations any of those types of things\nwhen you don't have it and you want life\nto be better you automatically think hey\nif I make money it will make my entire\nlife better the problem with that though\nis that a lot of us come from wanting to\nmake money\nand wanting to improve and want to get\nbetter from a place of lack and that's\nthe wrong place to start so I'm going to\ngive you a lot of tips as far as how\nI've seen to change your own mindset and\npsychology around money to number one\nmake you feel better about whether you\ndo or do not have it and number two\nteach you how to actually make more of\nit from changing your mindset around it\nand the way that I see money is I see\nmoney like energy and to want more money\nautomatically when you want something it\nautomatically puts you in a place of\nlack\nif I want something I am in a place of\nlacking that thing and it's going to be\nreally hard to get whatever it is that\nyou lack when you're lacking it and\nthinking about all of the lacking it\nbecause more than anything else you're\nactually closing yourself off to\nreceiving it and so we can dive I'm\ngoing to go through a few different\nthings here I'm going to go through a\nlittle bit it's going to get a little\nwoo-woo with me but it's also going to\nbe very tactical and very analytical as\nwild because if you're in the energy of\nlack you will always lack whatever you\nfocus on the most you will get more of\nthat thing so if you focus on the fact\nthat you don't have any you want more\nyou will always be lacking it and always\nwanting more so if you are in a place of\nLackey or in a place of not being able\nto receive so if you're the type of\nperson that you know you're scrolling on\nInstagram\nwhen you see somebody and they have a\nsuccessful company and they have a nice\ncar and maybe they're taking nice\nflights all over the world or whatever\nit is and the first thought that pops in\nyour head is man screw that person oh\nlook at them they're wasting they're\nwasting money that money could be used\nfor other things look at all the\npollution because of the fact that\nthey're on these plane flights and it\nimmediately goes to jealousy or judging\nthat is the first indication that you\nare in the completely wrong frequency to\nbe able to make money\nbecause you're jealous and jealousy\ncomes from a place of severe lack and so\nif you're the type of person who just\nsees other people online and then judges\nthem based off of what they're doing\nwith their lives what they're doing with\ntheir money about how they are\ndestroying the environment and how\nthey're not donating enough money and\nhow the when I if I had the money that\nthey have I wouldn't be doing the same\nthings that they are that judging in\nthat jealousy comes from a severe place\nof lack and if you continue to stay\nthere it's going to be really really\nhard for you to create the life the\nabundance everything that you want in\nyour own life and so let's dive into it\nlet's talk much deeper about it now\nthink about this for a second I always\nlike to give this example to people\nbecause it really kind of\nmakes them understand the way that they\nare around money I'm going to give a\ncompletely different example it's going\nto make a whole lot of sense right let's\nsay you have two different children you\nhave little boy who's child a and you\nhave a little boy who's child B and\nchild a they come up to you and they\nwant a toy you have a tool you have a\nblue truck and you give them this blue\ntruck and he takes the blue truck and\nhe's like oh\nI mean I don't really like the color\nblue this isn't my favorite color is red\nbut you're like that's the only toy that\nI have and they're like all right fine\nI'll play with it\nthey take the toy truck and they go play\nwith it and they do what little boys do\nthey slam it into things and they\nscratch it up and they mess it up and\nanother little boy comes up and he's\nlike hey can I play with your toy and\nthe boy that you give it to child day is\nlike no this is my toy you can't play\nwith my toy and you know the then dinner\ntime and the child ends up leaving their\ntoys all over the place and they don't\nreally seem to care they weren't\nappreciative and they don't share it and\nthey're just leaving their crap all over\nthe place that's child a right\nchild B let's say you give him a blue\ntruck and he takes the blue truck and he\nsays oh thank you he takes a blue truck\nand he plays with it and he has fun he\nplays with his other toys with the blue\ntruck and then another little boy comes\nup and he's like hey can I play with\nyour blue truck and he's like yeah uh\nyeah you can play with my blue truck and\nhe shares his blue truck and he lets him\nplay with the blue truck then it's\ndinner time and the boy takes two\nminutes takes all of his toys puts him\nback to where they were you know it\nmakes it at least a little bit more\nclean than it was\nnext time that you have a choice to give\na toy to a child would you rather give\nit to child a who seemed like an\nunappreciative little crap didn't take\ncare of it complained about it didn't\nshare it didn't put it away didn't take\ncare of it the way that he could have or\nwould you prefer to give it a child who\nsaid thank you who shared it who\nappreciated it who put it away the way\nthat he should have when he was done\nwith it which one would you rather give\nit to you'd rather give it to child B\nright why because they took care of it\nthey were grateful for it they shared it\nthey you know put it where it was\nsupposed to go and put it away when they\nwere done\nso let's flip that toy example into the\nway somebody receives money\nare you more like child a or child B\nwhen you're receiving money so let me\ngive you an example\nwhen you get your paycheck do you look\nat your paycheck and you're like oh damn\nit it's not enough I'm still not making\nas much as I want to\nand then you see somebody who you could\ndonate money to and you're like I don't\nhave enough I'm not going to get donate\nany money to them you don't budget it\nyou don't pay attention to it you don't\ntake care of it you're not grateful for\nit\nare you that type of person\nbecause if God or the universe or any of\nthat exists higher power and they have\nthis opportunity to flow energy into\nflow money into you are you more like\nchild a who's kind of a shitty little\nkid for being honest or child B who\ntakes care of it who's grateful for it\nwho says thankful thank you for it who\nshares it which one are you more like\nso think about this if you're more\nlikely to give a toy to child B because\nthey say thank you because they are\ngrateful because they share because they\ntake care of it\nif the higher power that might exist out\nthere has an option to give you money or\nsomeone else money are you being more\nlike child are you being more like child\nB\nit's really important to think of how do\nyou receive money how do you think about\nmoney what is the frequency of money to\nyou how do you feel when you look into\nyour bank account do you budget your\nmoney do you know where it's going are\nyou taking care of it are you sharing it\nusually when I say this to people\nthey're like oh light bulb holy\nI've been kind of like a crappy little\nkid with my money\nwhy would anybody want to give me more\nbecause I'm not taking care of it and so\nyou know when you receive your paycheck\nare you like oh damn it bills again you\nknow I'm not going to have as much as I\nwant to I'm going to be able to pay my\nbills but yeah God I wish I was making\nmore I wish I had more in my bank\naccount I was just doing something\ndifferent with my life I hate my\njob and this is what I'm getting paid\nfor\nhow do you receive your paycheck think\nabout that for a second what is the\nenergy of receiving your paycheck for\nyou how do you feel when you look at\nyour bank account\nI'll give you another example to kind of\nthink about the energy that you're in\nwhen you go and you're walking down the\nstreet and you happen to see a penny\nfive cents 10 cents whatever it is on\nthe side of the road do you just walk by\nit\nor\ndo you pick it up and put it in your\npocket\nI remember hearing this years ago and it\nchanged the way that I started\nperceiving and also receiving money so I\nused to just walk over money but think\nabout this for instance if the universe\nGod is going to give you five cents\nand put it as an option there on the\nfloor you might be like oh but it's\ndirty\nare you just going to walk over and just\nlet it go are you going to pick it up\nput it in your pocket and say thank you\nbecause here's one thing I'll tell you\nI'm gonna say this a couple times\nthroughout this episode if you cannot be\ntrusted with a little you will not be\ntrusted with a lot\nand so if you're going to walk over and\nbe like oh it's not worth it for me to\npick that up\nwhy would it be worth it for you know if\nyou don't even want that little amount\nwhy would a higher power want to give\nyou any more\nthink about that for a second do you\nstop do you pick it up do you say thank\nyou\none of the things that I learned years\nago I started doing this about five\nyears ago is every time that my company\ngets a payment inside I get I rarely get\nnotifications on my phone but every\nsingle time that my company gets a\npayment some sort of way my stripe and\nmy PayPal both of those things set off\nand I know that a payment just went into\nmy company's bank account and if I see\nit you know I'm in the middle of doing\nsomething and I'm just sitting there and\nI see it go off\nas soon as it comes in it could be for a\ncouple thousand dollars it could be for\nforty seven dollars whatever it is I\ntake four or five seconds close my eyes\nsay thank you and go on about my day\nbecause it's me being trusted with a\nlittle it's me being trusted with a\nlittle bit more and I'm in the energy of\nI want to receive and be thankful for\neverything no matter what it is even if\nit's three dollars that come into the\naccount\nif I can't be grateful for three dollars\nI can't be grateful for three thousand\ndollars\nwhat if all of this money thing and the\nway that we view it was just a test from\nthe universe to see how you respond to\nit\nI'll give you another example that\nreally changed a lot for me\nwhen you see someone that's on the side\nof the road homeless whatever they might\nbe do you ever give them money\nor are you the type of person's like\nwell yeah I don't know what they're\ngoing to do with that money so I don't\nwant to I don't want to give them money\nbecause I don't want them to go buy\ndrugs I don't want them to buy alcohol\nany of that stuff\nwhat do you do\nthink about that for a second what is it\nthat you do how what is your typical\nresponse whenever you're around somebody\nwho has less than you\nthe one thing that I decided to do years\nago when I really felt like I was in a\nplace of lack as far as money goes and\nwhat I did is I forced myself to\nactually give 21s out to 20 different\npeople and what I realized is I went\nfrom a place of feeling like severe lack\nto actually starting to feel like man\nI've got more than I need because I\nthink that subconsciously if I'm in a\nplace of lack and then I take and I can\nmy brain can see the transfer from of\none dollar from myself to someone else's\nhands and I still think in my head\nman I can still pay my bills I can still\neat I can still take care of myself\ntherefore I must come from a place of\nabundance because all too often all of\nus have a scarcity mindset in some way I\ndon't have enough I can't share it I\ncan't I gotta I gotta hoard it because\nwhat if something happens in the future\nif we come from a place of scarcity we\nwill only create more scarcity\nif we come from a place of abundance we\nonly create more abundance and so what I\nstarted doing is I made it years ago of\npractice just to give out you know\nwhenever I'd run out of out of money\ninside of my my car I would go out and\nget 21 20 more dollars and then 20 more\ndollars and 20 more hours all in one so\nI just hand it to people and I think I\nstarted brainwashing myself to actually\ngoing from a place of I don't have\nenough to look at that I just gave some\nto somebody and I can still pay my bills\nI can still eat which means that I must\ncome from a place of abundance I must\nhave so much abundance in my life that I\ncan give to somebody else and still be\nable to take care of myself because\nthat's what abundance means right not\njust paying the bills but having a\nlittle bit more not having millions of\ndollars more but just having a little\nbit more and so how can I start to\nbrainwash into my subconscious that I am\nnot completely broke I might have a\ncouple extra dollars that I do come from\na place of abundance because if I focus\non scarcity I'll get more scarcity if I\nfocus on abundance I will get more\nabundance and so a lot of people are\nlike well\nI don't have enough money to donate them\nlike once I become a millionaire then\nI'll start donating money once I become\na millionaire then I'll start taking\ncare of people once you become a\nmillionaire then I'll start doing this I\nhad a really good\nsuper successful mentor of mine that is\na hardcore philanthropist as well so\ntons and tons and tons of money donated\nhis goal in life is to donate a hundred\nmillion dollars before he dies and he\nsays if you won't donate one dollar from\nten dollars you won't donate a hundred\nthousand dollars from a million dollars\nso becoming somebody who donates and who\ngives doesn't start when you are\nsuccessful\nit is actually something that you start\non the journey to becoming successful on\nthe journey to becoming abundant\nand so if you take that and you realize\nokay this guy's this guy's goal is to\ndonate a hundred million dollars in his\nlifetime he's currently as of right now\nrecording this worth over 100 million\ndollars himself\nand his goal is to be able to donate by\nthe time he dies 100 million dollars\nand he said if you won't donate one\ndollar from ten you won't donate a\nhundred thousand from a million but if\nyou can't be trusted with a little\nthere's no way that you're going to be\ntrusted with a lot\nand so what is your perception around\nall of these things what is your\nperception about how you receive your\npaycheck what is your perception and\nyour feelings about how you look at your\nbank account how you feel when you think\nabout your bank account what is your\nperception of if you are more like child\na or if you're more like child B what is\nyour perception of if you see money on\nthe ground what is your perception of\npeople who are on the side of the road\nor people who are sitting there that\ncould receive money from you but are you\ncoming from a place of scarcity and\ngoing well yeah I don't I don't know\nwhat they're going to do with it because\nhere's the thing we never make money you\ndon't make money\nwe receive money from other people from\ncompanies from other people from\neverything that we do it's just an\nenergy exchange everything that we do so\nwe never we never make money and we\nnever own money it just comes into us\nand then out of us and into us and out\nof us\njust like food you eat food goes out of\nyou eat food it goes out of you you have\nmoney in your bank account the money\ngoes out of your bank account you have\nmoney break count your money goes out of\nyour bank account it's just a flow of\nenergy in some sort of way and once you\nstart to realize that money is energy\nand you stop take putting the the\nimportance of it so much importance on\nit which I did for a really long time\nbut you realize it can create\nexperiences it could create experiences\nfor yourself for other people you can\ngive it to other people you can provide\nfor other people and you can come from a\nplace of abundance and not from a place\nof scarcity you start changing the way\nthat your perception the way that you\nperceive money and you can actually\nstart start perceiving differently which\nmeans that you can also start receiving\ndifferently as well\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on Instagram stories and tag me\nat Rob dial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-j-r and I'm
