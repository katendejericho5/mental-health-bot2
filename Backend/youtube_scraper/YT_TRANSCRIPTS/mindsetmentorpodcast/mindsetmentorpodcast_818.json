over 400\nvideos that we have on YouTube to help\nyou get better and improve all you have\nto do is go to YouTube type my name in\nRob dial and it will automatically pop\nup today I'm going to be teaching you\nhow to stop comparing yourself and I'm\ngoing to talk to you about why you\ncomparing yourself is actually killing a\nlot of joy in your life and we live in a\nworld where we can see everything that\nsomeone else is doing at all moments and\nit's interesting because I grew up\nobviously in this Tech world I grew up\nbefore all this Tech came out before\nthere was Instagram and all that stuff\nand lived a life before then\nbut I'm also here now and I create a lot\nof content I put it out there and I\nactually see a lot of people's Joy being\nstolen from their life because they're\ntoo busy comparing themselves with\neverybody else they're comparing\nthemselves they're comparing their body\nto somebody else's body who's been\nworking out for 10 years straight and\nthen they get down on themselves they're\ncomparing their business that's three\nweeks old to someone else who's been\nrunning the business for three years and\nrunning trying to figure out why they're\nnot where they are uh the other person\nis at this point in time we live in a\nworld where we can constantly see\neverything that everyone else is doing\nand we compare ourselves we see where\nthey are oh my gosh they traveled to\nthis amazing thing I haven't left town\nin three weeks what am I doing with my\nlife we can see what they're wearing we\ncan see what they're eating we can see\nwho they're with and if you spend enough\ntime on social media I bet that you\ncompare yourself sometimes to some\npeople and now comparison itself\nis not necessarily a bad thing there is\na lot of good in comparison you know if\nyou think about comparing you can\ncompare how fast a car is going compared\nto your speed to see if you should turn\nor not that is where it becomes\nbeneficial our ancestors could compare\nthe size of an animal that was running\nat them to figure out if it was\nsomething to be afraid of and if it was\nsomething to be afraid of they could\ncompare how fast it is moving compared\nto how fast they can move and decide do\nI run or do I climb the nearest tree and\nthey could compare the speed of things\nthat were happening the size of things\nwere happening and so that itself is\nvery beneficial we can compare the food\nthat's on our plate to the size of our\nstomach and go oh yeah that's probably a\nlittle bit more than I need so\ncomparison does have some beneficial\nuses but when you're not paying\nattention to your brain and it's just\nrunning amok like it normally is and\nyou're looking at somebody else's life\non Instagram that's when it starts to\nget bad especially when you can look at\nsomeone else's life on Instagram and\nthink oh my God they're so happy they\nhave such a great relationship they have\nso much money they're so successful when\nin reality what we're seeing from\nsomebody else is the highlights of their\nlife not the the low lights of their\nlife and so one thing that is important\nto realize is that every single person\nis on a different path right\nso people can look like people come up\nto me all the time and they're like Rob\nhow do I have a podcast that's\nsuccessful like yours and I'm like well\ndo like 13 1400 episodes and come back\nto me in eight years and let's see where\nyou are so if you're like on I don't\nknow podcast episode three you can't\nreally compare podcast episode three to\nsomebody else's 1400th podcast because\nsometimes we just got to go through each\nchapter of our life and and one of my\nfavorite phrases that has to do with\nthis is you can't compare your chapter\none to somebody else's chapter 20. and\nso if you're on your third podcast\nepisode and you're like I don't feel\nlike I'm good I don't feel like I know\nwhat I'm doing I don't feel like this is\ngrowing\nand then you're looking at someone\nelse's podcast who's been doing it for a\nlong time yeah of course they have more\nexperience they have more time they have\nmore under their belt than you and you\nknow it's it's funny because I started\ntaking boxing lessons right\nand today was the the second boxing\nlesson that I did this guy comes over to\nmy house we've been doing boxing lessons\nand stuff and I I find myself fumbling\naround because I'm first off I'm sort of\n in random places I've never been\nsoared before because I'm like I'm\nmoving my body in ways I've never moved\nlike I'm sore in between my freaking\nKnuckles right like such a weird place\nto be sore and when he's talking about\nokay one two three and he's talking\nabout a jab and he's talking about a\nright hook and uppercut and all these\ndifferent things he does it and it's\nlike it's like a snap and it looks it\nlooks so effortless but he's been doing\nit for 15 years and so I can look at\nmyself and look at him and be like well\nI'll never be as good as him and he's so\nmuch better maybe I just maybe this\nisn't for me or I can go you know what\nthis is my chapter one like I'm I'm not\neven on chapter one I'm still reading\nthe introduction of this book this guy\nis probably finished this book and he's\non to his next book and so the the quote\nthat goes along with this is you'll\nnever be a graceful Master if you don't\nallow yourself to be a foolish beginner\nand so do I look like a giraffe that was\njust birthed and is trying to figure out\nhow to walk I do does he look like he's\nbeen doing this for a long time he does\nbut I can never get to looking as\ngraceful as he does unless I go through\nthe foolish beginner stage most people\nwe're just afraid to go through the\nfoolish beginner stage and we think that\njust because the fact that oh my gosh I\ntook two boxing lessons I should be a\n expert or you know what I've\nbeen going to the gym for three weeks\nwhy am I not in shape yet or you know\nwhat I've been running my business now\nfor two months why am I not a\nmillionaire yet and you know an example\nis like you know if somebody's\noverweight they can't compare their body\nto somebody on Instagram who's been\nworking out for seven years like all you\nhave to do is just go I need to show up\nevery single day and if I'm better than\nI was yesterday and I take this path and\nI just continue on this path for as long\nas possible eventually I will be as far\nalong as they are so if someone's\noverweight now it doesn't mean that\nthey'll always be overweight but if they\nstart to make changes and they take the\nright daily actions they could\neventually if they fast forward seven\nyears have the same body as that person\nbut if we look at someone on Instagram\nnow\nand we compare ourselves to them and we\nmake ourselves feel bad about the fact\nthat we don't look like them we'll never\nactually motivate ourselves to take the\naction that we need to to create the\nlife that we want to and so maybe you\njust started that's okay you can't\nexpect to have the body that you want\nalready but you can compare your body to\nyour body yesterday\nif you have been working out for a month\ncan you hop on the scale and see how\nyour body has changed can you think\nabout how your body has changed when you\nlook in the mirror can you think about\nhow maybe your body has more energy and\nso instead of comparing ourselves to\nsomebody else we've got to learn to\ncompare ourselves to who we were\nyesterday that's what we need to do\nthat's the only comparison that we\nshould ever make when it comes to our\nlives am I better than I was yesterday\ndo I have more knowledge than I did\nyesterday do I feel like I'm taking\nsteps in the right direction for my\nhealth better than I was yesterday do I\nfeel like I'm reading more and my\nintellect is growing more than it was\nmore than I I know more today than I did\nyesterday when I went to bed\nthat's what we should start comparing\nyourself do I have more money in my bank\naccount than I did last week or last\nmonth or two months ago so instead of\nbeing like well why am I not a\nmillionaire yet I should be a\nmillionaire at this point look at your\nbank account six months ago do you have\nmore money in your bank account than you\ndid six months ago if so that's a great\ncomparison you're getting better you're\nsaving more\nI remember when I was younger when I was\nlike 21. it's crazy to think of how you\nget older and you're just you realize\nthat you don't know the older that\nyou get like I thought I knew everything\nwhen I was 21 you know I'm 36 years old\nnow so fast forward 15 years and I think\nI don't know anything but back then I\nthought I knew everything and so I would\nbe like man I'm 21 I'm working so hard\nI'm putting in like 100 hours a week why\nam I not a millionaire yet and I was\nlooking at all these people that were\nlike Millionaires and they were\nsuccessful and I used to live when I was\n21 I lived down in Fort Lauderdale and I\nlived uh right by you know Fort\nLauderdale there's a ton of money Palm\nBeach there's a ton of money I lived\nright by Boca Raton Boca Raton there's a\nridiculous amount of money and I was\ncomparing myself to all of these people\nwho are who are you know they had Jets\nand they had Bentleys and they had\nFerraris and they had all these cool\ncars and cool life\nbut I never took a step back until\nrecently now that I am older and just\nrealized that things take time\nI was 21 comparing myself to guys who\nwere like 63 years old and it's like of\ncourse they have more than me of course\nthey have a different life than me\nthey've been on this path three they're\nliterally three times my age is what I\ncould have thought to myself I think I\nwould have had a lot less stress and\nanxiety when I was younger if I would\nhave stopped comparing myself to 63 year\nold people and started comparing myself\nto what who I was the month before and\nwho I was three weeks before and who I\nwas a year before and so you can't\ncompare yourself to somebody else the\nonly person you could compare yourself\nto is you in the past you can't compare\nyour business that you just started to\nyour friend's business who's been in the\nindustry for 10 years yours hasn't had\nas much time to mature as theirs had you\nhaven't had as much mistakes as they\nhave you haven't learned the lessons\nthat you need to learn to get you to\nwhere you want to go but you can compare\nyour business today to where it was six\nmonths ago\nor where it was last year you can\ncompare your body today to where it was\nsix months ago you can compare your\nknowledge to where you were six months\nago you can compare your bank account to\nwhere you were six months ago so when\nyou compare the real question is when\nyou compare after you compare do you\nfeel good or do you feel bad\nokay if you feel bad you're probably\ncomparing yourself to other people\nor you're comparing yourself to where\nyou think you should be and the word\nshould is a shame word just so you know\nyou are shaming yourself you're\nall over yourself is what you're doing\noh I should be this I should be this I\nshould be this no because if you should\nbe that you would already be that and\nrarely when we compare do we feel good\nbecause we're comparing ourselves to\nother people which we can't do because\nwe're not other people we haven't had\nthe same life circumstances that they\nhave and we can't come or we can't\ncompare ourselves to where we think we\nshould be because that's completely\nunrealistic really does comparison make\nyou feel good comparison usually brings\non the feeling of lack\nI don't have as much as they do I'm not\nas happy as they are I'm not as far\nalong as I should be and usually that's\nwhat it'll bring on lack but also what\nit tends to do is it tends to bring on\njealousy and we get jealous of other\npeople and lack and jealousy are not\nthat's lacking in jealousy are not\nmagnetic energy but neither one of those\nare magnetic energies when I lack\nsomething I'm not attracting something\nto me when I'm jealous of somebody else\nI'm not attracting that thing to me so\nby getting jealous and by feeling the\nfeeling of lack you're actually pushing\naway what it is that you truly want\nso we need to learn when we look at\nsomebody and we want to feel the feeling\nof like damn it I wish I had that body\ndamn it I wish I was on that trip damn\nit I wish that I was you know driving\nthat car damn it I wish that I had that\nbusiness damn it I wish that I had as\nmuch money as they do instead of\ncomparing ourselves and feeling lack and\nfeeling jealousy because we're not where\nthey are we can actually congratulate\nthat person and be like you know what\nhell yeah good for you you're doing well\nin life and you know what if you start\nto congratulate people in your mind out\nloud to them in their face if you see\nthem you will actually start to attract\nmore of what you want it's a more\nmagnetic energy\neven if it's just by yourself and you\nnever say it directly to that person\nright I used to get jealous when I'd see\npeople with nice cars and see people\nwith nice houses and see people\ntraveling the world and now when I see\npeople even when I see them on Instagram\nI'm like yeah man good for you good\nfor you for doing that that's awesome\nbecause I know that in order to get to\nwhere they were there was a lot of stuff\nthey had to get through there's a lot of\nthings a lot of crap that they had to go\nthrough to get to where they are hell\nyeah good for you for achieving what\nyou've achieved you got a freaking\nLamborghini good for you man that's\nprobably something you've been wanting\nfor a long time how awesome is that so\nwe have to learn to stay in our own lane\nright we have to learn\nthat you have your own lane that you're\nin I remember that\na few years ago I was doing well you\nknow I was doing psychedelics I'll say\nthat I won't say any further I won't say\nwhere I was when I was doing any of that\nstuff but I was on a psychedelic Journey\na few years ago and one of the things\nthat came very clear to me in this\npsychedelic Journey was I am on my own\npath like I the universe has made a lane\nfor Rob dial and Rob dial only I am the\nonly one that can get in this Lane I\ncannot get into anybody else's Lane\nanybody else cannot get into my lane I\nhave my own lane I have a journey that\nthe universe or God or life has designed\nfor me and I'm not in competition with\nanybody\nthe universe made me my own lane I just\nneed to follow this Lane I just need to\nfollow the path that I'm supposed to be\ngoing\nand I believe that you if you're\nlistening to this every single person\nhas their own lane as well and so if\nwe're so focused on other people's Lane\nand where they are\nwe're not going to get to where we want\nto be it's like that really famous\npicture like five or six years ago when\nthe the Olympics were happening and\nMichael Phelps was swimming and he ended\nup winning gold but they took a picture\nand one of the guys that was swimming he\nwas right behind him you can see a\nmid-stroke he's actually looking at\nMichael Phelps and end up losing to\nMichael Phelps he was so focused on\nwhere Michael Phelps was that he didn't\nput 100 focus into where he was and he\nended up losing and so really what it\ncomes down to is like swimming your\njourney staying in your lane staying on\nyour path and when you see people\nsucceeding being like man that's amazing\nI can't wait till I get there that's\namazing good for you there's probably a\nlot of things you had to go through to\nget there I believe that you have your\nown lane you just have to follow for you\nwhat feels right and then you have to\nrealize that things just take time\nlike that's the one thing that I've\nrealized that as I get older slow and\nsteady wins the race\nThat's it man slow and steady wins the\nrace mites putting one foot in front of\nthe other on my path that I'm supposed\nto be going on did I did I get one step\nfurther One Step Closer today did I get\none step closer today did I get one step\ncloser today and I realized that this\njust things take time like I wanted to\nbe so successful when I was so young and\nas I get older I'm just like things are\ngoing to happen as things are supposed\nto happen and I don't know about you but\nwhen I start going through that mental\nthought process the whole feeling in my\nbody is just like\nokay I don't have to be so uptight I\ndon't be so focused and so why should\nwhy am I not there I should be further\nand it's just such a restrictive energy\nyou know when we used to see people that\nwere millionaires like why don't I have\nthat it's just like you know over the\npast few years and I got to places that\nI wanted to be and doing things that I\nwanted to do I just realized it just I\nwasn't there yet time wasn't things take\ntime and my time had not come to to be\nthat time yet and so when you see people\nthat have something that you have a lot\nof times they might be 15 to 20 years\nfurther than you\nright\nthey you still have a lot you still have\nso many things you can be grateful for\nand with your goals you just have to\nrealize they only take three things they\ntake Direction they take action and they\ntake time are you heading in the right\ndirection to achieve your goals as is\nyou know is what you're doing right now\ntaking you closer to or further away\nfrom your goals so are we heading in the\nright direction okay if we are then each\nday am I taking the right action to\nstart to get there am I putting am I one\nstep closer to my goal that I've been\ntrying to work for am I heading in the\nright direction yes am I taking the\nright action one step one step one step\nand just getting one percent better\nevery single day and then time time is\ngoing to work itself out the way that's\nsupposed to work itself out\nif you think about how crazy would it be\nto go to the gym you know and and leave\nthe gym and be like look down and be\nlike what the hell I don't have a\nsix-pack yet like we would all be like\nthat's wild nobody would ever think that\nwhy do we think that for everything else\nin our life we think that in our bank\naccount and our relationships and our\nbusinesses all of that stuff we need to\nmake sure we're heading in the right\ndirection we need to make sure we're\ntaking the right action and we just need\nto let time work itself out so what you\nhave to do is realize that you're\nrunning your own race you're in your own\nlane and you've got to stop comparing\nyourself and you've got to stop being\njealous and you've got to start\ncongratulating\nso that's what I got for you for this\nepisode if you love this
