    "transcript": "so I think it's pretty simple the reason\nwhy most people don't get what they want\nin the world is because they won't stop\nfocusing on what it is that they don't\nwant and what you look at and what you\nfocus on you will get they're constantly\nthinking I don't want to be broke I\ndon't want to be alone I don't want to\nbe sad anymore and motorcyclists know\nthis in motorcycle school they teach you\nto look through the turn to only look at\nwhere you want to go because wherever\nyou look is where you're going to end up"
