be\ntalking about how to have a breakthrough\nfor some of you maybe even a lot of you\nthis could be a pretty tough episode\nit'll be a tough episode as we go\nthrough it and I start to talk about how\nto have a breakthrough but I promise you\nthis it will be worth it and the idea\nfor this podcast came from people always\nask where do your podcast ideas come\nfrom life like literally life everything\nthat I do gives me ideas for podcasts\nand I was watching a movie called honey\nboy which is a Shia LaBeouf movie and\nhis dad it's a crazy movie it's\nincredible it's really good but there's\nsomething that his dad says in that\nmovie that really like hit home with me\nand made me start thinking a lot and\nthen I started thank you a lot and then\nI started journaling and then I was like\nI gotta turn this into a podcast episode\nbecause I really started thinking about\nthis process and the quote was a seed\nhas to completely destroy itself in\norder to become a flower\na seed has to completely destroy itself\nin order for it to become a flower so\nwhen you look at who you want to be\nthe person that like when you really\nclose your eyes and you think about all\nof the potential that you can have the\nlife that you could have the\nrelationship you could have the\ntraveling that you could do the business\nthat you could have the money you could\nhave in your bank account the\nrelationship you can you could have with\nyour kids like the most full optimized\nversion of you when you look at who you\nwant to be\nyou're probably going to have to\ncompletely destroy who you currently are\nand that might scare the out of a\nlot of you and if it does fine let it\nscare the out of you but you're\nliterally going to have to become a\ndifferent person this let's say you\nthink of yourself right now as the seed\nand that vision of you that you have\nthat you have in the future is the\nflower in order for a seed to become a\nflower it has to absolutely destroy\nitself there is no bit of that seed that\nis left when the flower starts to grow\nand when the flowers fully Bloom there\nis no bit of that seed that exists\nanymore\nyour life will absolutely and cannot\nchange unless you change your all your\nlife will always be the same if you are\nthe same for some weird freaking reason\nI don't get it people tend to think that\ntheir life is just like somehow they're\njust gonna get some big blessing I can\nbe I could just sit on the couch I could\neat potato chips I can scroll on\nInstagram I can watch Netflix and one\nday my life is going to be amazing one\nday someone's going to come down and\nbless me with the life I've always\nwanted no you have to create the life\nthat you want there is no one that's\ngoing there's no knight in shining armor\nthat's going to come and save you from\nthe person that you are to be able to\ncreate the person that you want to be\nlike to create the life that you want\nyou cannot change\nyour life cannot change none of these\nscenes can change unless you go you know\nwhat I got to be the person to do it\nsorry there's going to be no knight in\nshining armor coming down on the white\nstallion that's going to help you create\nthe life that you want your life and\neverything around you is based off of\nwhat you have done in the past and who\nyou were in the past we blame everybody\nelse but ourself oh it's their fault oh\nit's I don't have enough time to create\nthe life that I want as if other people\nget more than 24 hours I don't have\nenough time oh my God look at all the\nchildren that I have I have to I can't\ndo that I've I've got these children\nI've got to feed oh I'd be different if\nmy parents weren't such I'd be\ndifferent if they wouldn't have been so\nnice to me I'd be different if my\nparents weren't so mean to me I'd be\ndifferent if you know I was older I'd be\ndifferent if I was younger ah time has\npassed I'm too old to be able to do this\nthing\nand we look around and we try to blame\neverything externally outside of us\ninstead of actually looking at ourselves\nputting the mirror in front of ourselves\nand saying you are the one who has to\nchange there is no one that is going to\nchange your life except for you\nand sometimes there has to be a full on\nbreakdown to have a breakthrough\nyou have to break down to the core of\nwho you like literally break apart all\nof the pieces that you thought you were\nand how you act and oh I'm this way\nbecause of this and this is just part of\nmy personality this is how I am\nsometimes you have to have a full-on\nbreakdown it doesn't have to be a mental\nbreakdown but I mean like a big\nbreakdown of who you are in order to\nhave a breakthrough\nwhen you're in a breakdown when you're\nat the point where you feel like it's\nrock bottom\nthat is the best chance for you to now\nchange your life\nand sometimes it's easier to make a\nchange in your life when you are at Rock\nBottom than when things are just going\npretty well you know like when I think\nback to when I was at my rock bottom and\nI was living off of pasta for two months\nand I was five months behind on my car\npayment that was easy to change from\nbecause that situation sucked so much I\nwas like I gotta get the hell out of\nhere that was very easy to change from\nbut I can also think about when I had\nthe opportunity I was making a couple\nhundred grand a year then I had the\nopportunity to leave that to be able to\nstart this business that I have now it\nwas a lot harder to make that change\nthan it was to go from Rock Bottom to a\nlittle bit better and a little better a\nlittle bit better\nit's kind of wild and so a lot of you\nlistening your life is pretty good\nit's all right you might get a couple\ndays of vacation each year you might\nmake pretty decent money might have a\npretty cool little house some pretty\ncool little car and a nice relationship\nbut you want so much more you want to\nnot just more materialistic things I\nmean so much more as far as experiences\nas far as love joy happiness peace all\nof those things you're going to have to\nstart to break some things and Destroy\nsome things in order to create that\nbut\nthere's one really big issue and that's\nthat thing that's in between your ears\nit's your mind\nthe human mind resists change your\nsubconscious\nwill always resist change you will\nalways resist change in some sort of way\nbecause it means that you have to\ndestruct who you currently are in order\nto make something different\nand to change who you are\nthat is a threat to the human mind\nno way no no do anything else except for\nchange\nanything have a cigarette watch Netflix\nsmoke a bowl have a shot of of Tequila\ndrink a glass of wine scroll on your\nphone talk to someone else go for a walk\ndo anything but actually change what\nneeds to change your brain will try to\nfigure out all the different things to\nkeep you busy so that you don't have to\nactually do the thing that really truly\nmatters which is change to deconstruct\nto reconstruct because change is a\nthreat to the human mind so your mind\nwill give you all of these reasons why\nyou got to do something different\nyou won't die but pieces of your old\nself have to die\nthink about that for a second like you\nwon't physically die\nbut pieces of your old self have to die\nI'm in the process of reading this book\nright now and he's talking about death\nand how so many people are afraid of\ndeath\nand the reason why they're afraid of\ndeath is because death in life are on\nthe same coin like if you you flip a\ncoin you got heads and you got tails you\ncan't have heads without tails you can't\nhave tails without heads you can't have\ndeath without life and you can't have\nlife without death and why so many\npeople are afraid of death\nis because they actually aren't even\ntruly living\nthink about that for a second\nwaking up\nand feeling anxious and feeling stressed\nand feeling like you're not where you\nwant to be and judging yourself and\ntalking down to yourself all of those\nthings that's not living\nthat isn't living it safe and close to\nliving\nso why are we afraid of death because\nwe're actually afraid of life we're\nafraid of if we're if we're afraid of\ntruly being the person that we want to\nbe in creating everything that we want\nthen we're also gonna be afraid of death\nthere is it's the same coin\nand then the other thing he goes on and\nsays is in order to fully live you're\ngoing to have to die every day not\nphysically die but psychologically and\nspiritually die every single day\nso if you're afraid to if the reason why\nyou're afraid of death is because you're\nafraid of life and you're not fully\nliving right now\nso\nin order to live fully every single day\nyou must also die every day there's a\npiece of you that has to die off there's\nparts of you that have to death once\nagain it's not physical death it's not\nme like die and then there's no more you\nwhat I mean by it is there's there's\npsychological death that has to come\nwhat I mean by that is that you won't\ndie but pieces of your old self have to\ndie that anxiety has to die that\njudgment has to die that self-pity has\nto die that blaming other people has to\ndie you have to kill parts of\nyourself in order to build the parts of\nyourself that you want you can't say yes\nto one thing and without saying no to\nsomething else if you're going to say\nyes to being a more loving person you're\nalso going to have to say no and to the\nperson who is judgmental who is\njudgmental to other people but also to\nyourself that also talk to yourself\nyou have to realize that there's parts\nof us that need to die off all of the\ntime and we have to be okay with the\npurge you know okay with the purge and\nokay with the purge you know if I think\nabout like myself\nI'm not the same person that was five\nyears ago I'm not the same person was 10\nyears ago I'm not the same person I was\n15 years ago I have actually when I\nthink back to the point where I was at\nmy lowest point in my life the Rob that\nwas back October 2010 in Fort Lauderdale\nin the one bedroom apartment no\nfurniture in the house except for a bed\nliving off a pasta for two months and\nliterally sitting there and being five\nmonths behind on my car payment and\nbegging them not to repossess my Audi\nI'm not the same I have literally and\nfiguratively killed that person that\nperson is dead there are no there's no\nbit of that Rod that still exists I have\ndestroyed that person\nbut From the Ashes Like a Phoenix I've\nrebuilt myself into the person I wanted\nto be\nso if you're going to build yourself\ninto the person that you and mind you\nlet me say this I'm not perfect so I'm\nstill not the person that I can be\nthere's still more that needs to die off\nthat I'm slowly finding every single day\nand I don't expect to just finally be at\nthat destination at some point in time\nin my life I see this as like a birth\nand death process forever probably until\nthe day where I actually really truly do\ndie right so I don't see this as like I\nsee this whole thing is a journey not\njust like a moment where it's going to\nfinally be like oh look at me I've made\nit that'd be awesome right I don't see\nit as I made it ever but I had to find\nthe parts of myself that I identify with\nand completely get rid of some of them\nand figure out what needed to change and\nwhen I needed to change something I\nbuilt a new version of myself you\nhopefully are not the same person that\nyou were 10 years ago hopefully you're a\nbetter version of yourself now not\neverybody's going to be a better version\nof himself but hopefully you are a\nbetter version of yourself but when you\nlook at who you used to be\nif you're a better version of yourself\nthere were parts of yourself that you\nhad to kill off\nyou had to take it behind the you know\nthe into the backyard and you know shoot\nit how to be gone you had to get rid of\nthat self-pity and blaming other people\nand not stepping up and not following\nthrough and being a lazy POS you had to\nget rid of all of those things\nlife is about destroying the old version\nof yourself in order to make way for the\nnew version of yourself knocking down an\nold building\nthat's decaying that's not up to code\nwhere the electricity is coming out of\nthe wall there's rats everywhere you got\nto knock that building sometimes it's\njust that building's it's too far gone\nyou got to knock it down in order to\nmake space to build a new building\nbut what's really hard is it's our it's\nour identity like when we think that we\nhave to kill out a part of ourselves our\nidentity gets really afraid because if\nwe don't have ourselves we don't have\nour identity who are we because we've\nbuilt ourselves into thinking that we\nare this person every single day\nand so we think we're this person so\nit's really scary to think that I can\nwake up tomorrow and be a completely\ndifferent person I can literally be a\ncompletely different person today\nI don't know how many times it says in\nthe podcast probably a couple hundred\nbut one of my favorite quotes is Alan\nWatts that says you're under no\nobligation to be who you were five\nminutes ago you can decide to be a\ndifferent person right now\nyou can\nand when you look at personal growth\nyou have to lose yourself in order to\nfind yourself so you have to find the\nparts of yourself that you don't want\nanymore that you don't enjoy in order to\nfind the parts of yourself that you do\nwant and you do want to create you can't\nstrengthen a part of yourself without\nfinding the part of yourself that's the\ncomplete opposite of that part of\nyourself that you want to strengthen and\nkill it off and get rid of it you have\nto let go of Who You Think You Are\nin order to build yourself into who you\ntruly want to become\nand let me just say something I think\npeople don't really think about as as\nmuch is you might have to mourn the old\nversion of yourself the same way that\nwhen somebody dies you mourn them right\nthere might be a grieving process of who\nyou used to be because change is not\neasy but it is necessary\nwhen you're happiest when you are at\nyour happiness happiest it's usually\nbecause you feel like you're progressing\nin life\nTony Robbins always says this progress\nequals happiness when you feel like\nyou're progressing at your happiness\nhappiest and so when you feel like\nyou're progressing what that actually\nmeans is that there's parts of yourself\nthat you're letting go of you are\nstepping into new parts of yourself but\nyou're also letting go of other parts of\nyourself I've never seen someone who has\nreal true progression in their life who\nwas unhappy\nusually when someone is unhappy they\nfeel stagnant when someone feels like\nthey're not enough and they're not going\nthe way they want to that's usually\nwhere unhappiness comes from but when\nsomeone's progressing and they're\nreading and they're improving and\nthey're having more fun and they're\nhaving more happiness and better\nrelationships and they're going to\nconferences to help themselves with\ntheir personal development or with\ngetting good at real estate investing\nwhatever it is and they're progressing\nvery rarely do you find someone that's\nunhappy\nso you have to realize\nthere's a version of you in the future\nthat is the flower\nthere is\nit's there and it's waiting for you and\nit is your true absolute potential\nbut in order for you to become that\nflower\nyou're going to have to completely\ndestroying parts of yourself\nand I'll go back to the very first thing\nI said to begin this podcast episode a\nseed has to completely destroy itself in\norder for it to become a flower\nyou just have to make the decision of\nwhat needs to go what needs to stay what\nyou need to create and what you need to\nstrengthen so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me at Rob dial\nJunior Rob\nd-i-a-l-jr and I'm going to leave you\nthe same way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission make\nsomebody else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have let me stop\nbefore you go any further\nI always say to the end of the episode\nand people always ask like why do you\nsay that because we have hundreds of\nthousands of people listening this\npodcast imagine if every single one of\nyou went out today and decided to do\nsomething for somebody else how much\nbetter would the world be if you did\nthat every single time you listen this\npodcast it would be massively better so\nwhen I say it I'm not just saying it for\nthe hell of it I'm not saying for just\nshits and giggles go out and make\nsomebody else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
