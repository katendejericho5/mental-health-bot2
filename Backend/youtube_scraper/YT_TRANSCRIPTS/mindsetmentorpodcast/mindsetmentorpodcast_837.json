    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so you never miss\nanother podcast and if you're out there\nand you love this podcast please give us\na rating and review on whatever platform\nyou listen to us on the more positive\nrating reason we get the more that we\nactually are able to be seen by people\nwho have never listened to us before so\nif you want to help us grow and help us\nget this message out please give us a\nrating review however you listen to us\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to step into your power we're going\nto talk about decision making and we're\ngoing to talk about a lot of different\nthings as far as fear and power go and\nwhen I say your personal power I don't\nmean\npower when you think about like a\nnegative connotation I mean that deep\ndown inside of you you are really\n powerful but are you bringing\nthat out to the world or are you hiding\nare you hiding behind the World Behind\nSociety behind what you're supposed to\ndo behind what your parents told you to\ndo behind not wanting to be seen\nyou have a whole lot of power inside of\nyou and what we want to talk about here\ntoday is how to step into that power and\nhow to start making decisions that allow\nyou to find that power and be more\npowerful because the most important\ndecision that you can make\nmajority of them are little teeny tiny\nsmall decisions throughout the day can\ncome from one of two places it can\neither come from fear or it can come\nfrom power and when I say power I mean\npersonal power like stepping into the\nbest version of yourself and if we look\nat it we know it's very obvious I've\nbeen there many times I've still find\nmyself doing this sometimes today is\nmost of our decisions\ncome from a place of fear\nmost of our decisions our thought\nprocess of whether we're going to do\nsomething or not do something the first\nthing that usually comes up is all of\nthe things that could happen that we\ndon't want to happen all of the things\nthat could possibly go wrong and so we\nliterally go straight to fear and we\nstart thinking about all the things that\nwe don't want and we can paralyze we\ndon't do I'm gonna do anything we\ndo absolutely nothing and this is a you\nknow I was watching a video one time\nthen there was a guy that was on stage\nand he had somebody come up and he was\ntalking about okay we've got two chairs\nthere's one chair here on the left\nthere's one chair here on the right I\nwant you to sit down in this chair and I\nwant you to tell me and tell everybody\nelse in the crowd what you don't want\nand this person's like okay I don't want\nthis I don't want this I don't want this\nthis this\na laundry list of all these things they\ndon't want he said cool all right now go\nahead and switch chairs go to the other\nchair and in this chair you're going to\ntell me what you do want so tell me\neverything that you do want and it's\nfunny because the person's like well you\nknow I want to be happy I want this I I\nwant this I want this and uh well I\ndon't want this and I don't want this\nand you notice that they go from what\nlike what they don't want is very easy\nfor them to Rattle off a whole bunch of\nthings when they go to what they do want\nthey've got a couple things and then\nslowly but surely it almost always\ntransitions to the person talking about\nwhat they don't want we almost always in\nour brain we'll go straight to fear and\nfocus on what we don't want so you could\nsay like I want to grow a business\nand you can start thinking about how\namazing it could be but then you start\nthinking about well what if I fail what\nif I don't make money what if I lose\nmoney what if I go in debt what if I\nlose my house what if my children and I\nare homeless on the side of the road and\nwe can't eat right it's like you\nliterally go from like wanting to start\na business to just kicking your dreams\nin the face\nthe problem is that most of us come from\nFear often you know and if you look back\nat your entire life really think about\nthis for a second when you look back at\nyour entire life you know if you're 45\nyears old right now are most of the\ndecisions that you've made in your life\ncoming from personal power\nor fear\ndid you take the safe route did you go\nget a degree because that's what you\nthought was safe did you go for a\ncertain degree that you didn't want to\nbecause you thought that job was safe\ndid you apply for that to work for the\ngovernment or to work for this company\nbecause you thought that it was safe\nlong term\nyou know for me I know that a lot of my\nlife you know the first 26 years of my\nlife a lot of my decisions were made\nfrom Fear until I realized that the\ndecisions that were made from Fear won't\ngive me the life that I want like the\nthe life that you truly want deep down\ninside and all of the potential that you\nhave that you could bring out to the\nworld\nyou can't make decisions in fear to\nbring that out to the world decisions\nmade from Fear were keeping me in my\ncomfort zone oh I want to be safe I just\nbought a new house I want to make sure I\ncan pay my bills I want to make sure I\ncould be fed you know I want to make\nsure I could save some money I want to\nmake sure I can still travel I don't\nknow if I can do that I don't know if I\ncan start my business I don't know if I\ncould you know what I'll just go ahead\nand I'll get the safe route I can make\ngood money I can make I can be I can be\npretty good you know and I'll maybe I'll\nget like 15 days of vacation per year\nthat'd be awesome yeah let me go that\nroute but why do we go to fear\nwhy does our brain almost always go to\nfear automatically because the brain is\nliterally designed to keep you alive\nyour brain does not give a damn about\nhow successful you are how much money\nyou have how much sex you have what's\nhow much money you have in your bank\naccount you know where your what Your\nInvestments are where you're traveling\nto this year doesn't care about any of\nthose things there's a party brain\ncalled the amygdala and not as the part\nof your brain that literally creates\nfears even when there's nothing to fear\nin front of you and so we have to know\nthat our brain will automatically almost\nalways default to negative then we start\nthinking about oh my gosh what are these\npeople going to think of me what if I\nfail what if I get rejected all of this\nand that's why it's so important to\ndevelop self-awareness like very very\nclear self-awareness I always say when\npeople ask me I've been on podcasts\nbefore and they ask me like if you could\ngive the world one superpower one gift\nwhat would you want I'm like extreme\nself-awareness if everybody had extreme\nself-awareness they would be better they\nwould treat people better the world\nwould be a million times better because\nthey'd be aware of how their actions\nchange the people around them as well\nthere'd be no war if people were\nself-aware of what that what their\ndecisions did\nand if you think about that when you\nthink about all of our decisions that\nare made from Fear how many great\ndecisions have you heard of that\nsomebody has achieved this great massive\namazing beautiful thing that changed the\nworld or changed something that was just\nlife-changing that came from a place of\nfear you know when you think about like\nSteve Jobs and they were sitting down\nand creating the iPhone you know I think\nthe iPhone came out in like 2006 2007\n2008 something like that I remember what\nit was but I remember when it came out\ndo you think Steve Jobs and everything\neverybody in apple was sitting around\nand they're like\nokay well what if this doesn't work no\nit was like we have to like Forge\nthrough on our path that nobody knows\nit's never been seen you got to come\nfrom a place of personal power we can do\nthis we're the company to do this I'm\nthe person to do this\nhow many how many do you think came from\na place of fear probably none I would\nsay no great decisions that have changed\npeople's lives but also the world came\nfrom a place of fear\nand I don't mean fear like the fear of\ndeath or the fear of like hey I don't\nwant to drive fast because I don't want\nto get into an accident accident I mean\nlike where you have an opportunity to\nchange your life\nto make your like it's like a fork in\nthe road and left you can go and it\ncould be the same that has always been\nand right is something vastly different\nbut instead of going for vastly\ndifferent instead of going out into the\nuncertainty doing something you've never\ndone before\nrisking it all you decided to play small\nyou decided to take the safe route you\ndecided to stay in your comfort zone\nbecause the comfort zone is comfortable\nand if you've been listening to my\npodcast long enough I always say that\nthe comfort zone is a place where your\ndreams go to die\nyour dreams will die in your comfort\nzone\nand you just give up on a big goal\nuh it's easier not to do it it's easier\njust to hang out it's easier just to\nchill\nyou know so many people listening right\nnow at one point in time wanted to start\na business\nbut they didn't\nwhere do you think that bit you know\nit's like six years ago you wanted to\nstart that business you had that great\nidea you were super passionate about it\nbut then you thought to yourself like I\ndon't know if it's possible what if I\nwhat if I can't pay the bills what if\nwhat if it takes too much time what if I\nlose my sleep and then it goes into my\nactual day job and you have this idea to\nstart a business six years ago\nbut instead of stepping into your\npersonal power you stepped into a place\nof fear\nwhere could that business be right now\nsix years almost 2 000 Days Later where\ncould that business be\nhow could it have changed your life\nhow vastly different could your life be\nif you decided to step off the ledge\nand just know that the parachute was\ngoing to open when you jumped off\nwhere could your life be now it could be\nvastly different couldn't it\nwhat about in like investing into your\npersonal development where you're like\nyou know what I'm gonna invest in my\npersonal development but oh man like I\ndon't know I want to go to this event\nbut you know what if people look at me\nfunny what if I what if I get called on\nstage you know I don't know you know\nwhat I'll do I'll just save money\ninstead I won't develop I won't I won't\nstep into my personal power I won't go\ninto personal development there's so\nmany decisions that we you know that you\ncould be in a relationship with somebody\nbut you decided instead\noh I'm afraid of being rejected I'm not\ngoing to do it and you could have a\ncompletely different life if you had\njust came from a place of personal power\nversus a place of fear\nhow many decisions have you made from a\nplace of just trying to play it safe\nthere's less risk there's less risk\ngoing this route like we always think\nthat there's less risk just going this\nroute and we justify that there's less\nrisk going this route and so we decide\nto go down that route\nbut in life if you don't risk anything\nyou're risking everything\nin your life if you don't risk anything\nyou are risking everything in your life\nyou're risking everything that you could\nbe how many world-changing moments came\nfrom a place of fear that changed the\ncourse of history how many people do you\nlook up to that have all of the life\nthat you want you look up to you think\nthat they're amazing all of this how\nmany do you think's got there because\nthey decided to come from a place of\nfear probably none like zero\nhow many great inventions came from a\nplace of fear how many great companies\ncame from a place of fear when you look\nat that you start to realize that we\nmake the majority of our decisions most\nof us usually do through the majority of\nOur Lives coming from a place of fear\ntaking a safe route\nso what we should be focused on is\nmaking more decisions from a place of\npower personal power stepping into who\nyou could be and frankly honestly who\nyou should be like who you are put on\nthis planet to be are you just going to\nbe like everybody else\nyou weren't put on you don't look like\nanybody else you don't have the same\nfingerprint as everybody else you were\ndesigned uniquely because you were\nsupposed to be unique not because you\nwere supposed to go the same route as\neverybody else and just follow the rat\nrace and do the same thing and not take\nrisks and dive with you know a little\nbit extra money in the bank account\nmaybe a couple cool experiences and just\nlive in a pretty cool life\nis the risk for you to step into\npersonal power for you to step into the\nunknown is their risk absolutely\nthere's risk and you can focus on the\nrisk and that risk can paralyze you and\nstop you from going and doing something\nor you could focus on what you could be\nwhat you could do instead of focusing on\nyour problems you can also focus on\npossibility knowing that your brain will\ndefault to problems\nyou could also just decide oh there's my\nbrain it's going to problems it's going\nto fear instead of being on problems you\nknow what I'm gonna do I'm gonna focus\non possibility I'm going to focus on\nwhat could happen if I decide to go that\nroute\nbecause if you don't risk anything\nyou're risking everything\nyou know it's kind of like the the\nfeeling I always tell people it's like\nthe gut feeling versus the brain\npeople always ask like how do I develop\nmy intuition how do I get my gut feeling\nnumber one everybody's got it it's\nalways there but we just tend to not\nlisten to it and we don't listen to it\nfor a really long time you stop paying\nattention to it\nthere's the gut and there's the brain\nthe brain once again is designed to keep\nyou alive it's designed to keep you safe\nand so you have this gut feeling of you\nknow what I should start this business I\nshould ask that person out I should\ndecide to go to Africa and go on a\nsafari instead of going for my next\nsemester at school I don't know what it\nis for you but there's a gut feeling\nwhere you feel pulled towards something\nlike you have and the way to tell a gut\nfeeling is usually think about the\nenergy behind that feeling\nlike if you have a feeling like you're\nfeeling pulled towards something and\nthinking about doing this thing is\ngiving you energy like you have so much\nenergy thinking about it that's usually\nsomething that you're supposed to follow\nand I always say your gut feeling it's\nlike your emotional Compass it knows\nwhat you're supposed to it knows you're\nsupposed to go you have to get good at\nlistening becoming quiet shutting up\nquieting the brain and feeling into\nsomething being like what does my energy\nfeel around this thing do I feel excited\nto go do this thing\nbecause you have that gut feeling but\nthen you've also got your brain so\nyou'll have a gut feeling arise and\nit'll pop up and you'll be exciting to\nbe like this is amazing I should\ndefinitely do this but then what does a\nbrain do\noh yeah but no you can't do that so your\ngut feeling is almost immediate it's\nalmost always there it's like right away\nyou feel drawn you feel pulled towards\nsomething and then your brain tries to\ntalk you out of everything\nthat's out of your comfort zone because\nit wants to keep you safe it doesn't\nknow that there's no potential Danger on\nthe other side of that comfort zone\neverything that you want is going to\nfirst require you to make a decision\nfrom a place of power instead of a place\nof fear\nso what do you need to do you need to\nstart becoming really self-aware you\nneed to start paying attention to your\nfeelings so you to to where you're\ngetting energy from if you pay attention\nto your energy you'll almost always be\nguided in the right direction\nlike when I think about\nwhat I do\nI get so much like people are like you\nwork so much I'm like I don't feel like\nI'm working like this is fun for me\nit's exciting I get so much energy by\nsitting down and figuring people out and\nworking with people and learning about\npeople and learning about neurology and\npsychology and early childhood\ndevelopment like this lights me up\nfor some people listening most people\nlistening it probably doesn't to do what\nI do and that's fine but like all I did\nwas follow the energy and when I\nfollowed the energy was there a lot of\nfear yeah there was a lot of fear\nthere's ton of fear to leave my job to\nstart a podcast back in 2015 when people\ndidn't even know what podcasts were that\nmakes no sense like everybody knows what\npodcasts are right everyone in their mom\nhas started a podcast and they're like\noh I'm gonna make a podcast about blah\nblah blah everyone has started a podcast\nback in 2015 when I used to tell people\nI was a podcaster\nthe response I got more back than\nanything else was what is a podcast so\ndoes it make any sense for me to go I'm\ngoing to quit my job where I'm making\n200 Grand a year\nover 200 Grand a year I'm gonna quit\nthat job but I'm going to do this\npodcasting thing that no one's ever\nheard of before it made no logical sense\nbut for some reason something deep down\ninside me is like you have to do this\nlike this is this is something that\nyou're supposed to do and so what did I\ndo I just followed the energy and I had\nto be aware of the energy and then when\nthe fear popped in I need to say you\nknow no this this feels right I'm going\nto follow this thing that feels right\nwhen you feel that feeling you have to\nfollow it otherwise you're going to look\nback on your life and you're gonna have\nmassive regret you're going to wait wish\nthat you made less decisions from Fear\nso noticing fear is good listening to\nthe fear is bad like fear can keep you\nalive so what do you do as number one\nyou have to become very self-aware of\nwhen you notice fear popping up take a\nstep back when you're in the jar you\ncan't read the label so when you take a\nstep back you're like okay hold on what\nam I feeling right now\nwhy am I feeling this\nis this actually something of fear am I\nfocusing on problems or am I focusing on\npossibility\nI'm focusing on problems okay what is\nthe possibility what is what is the\npotential outcome that could come if I\ndo follow this it could be amazing how\ncould this change my life so first\nthings we have to take a step back we\nhave to become very self-aware the\nsecond thing is that that's really good\nabout this is this just showing you the\nedge of your comfort zone\nyou know if you decide to take a leap\nand go outside of your comfort zone you\nfast forward like right now you fast\nforward five years from today and you\nstep into your personal power and you\nmake decisions not from fear but out of\nyour personal power your life's going to\nbe vastly different if you continue to\nmake your decisions out of fear though\nand you fast forward in five years\nyou're not going to like where you are\nyou just will not like where you are if\nyou continue to make decisions out of\nfear but if you fast forward and you\nmake decisions out of power watch out\nbecause you're going to create some\nmagic you're going to change your life\nyou're going to change other people's\nlife you're going to change the little\npocket of the world that you live in and\nthat's what you're here to do not to\nplay small but to do something amazing\nand so you've got to got to got to\nrealize there's two things that you\ncould do at any point in time make\ndecisions out of fear or make decisions\nout of personal power make decisions out\nof personal power and your life will\nchange so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on Instagram stories
