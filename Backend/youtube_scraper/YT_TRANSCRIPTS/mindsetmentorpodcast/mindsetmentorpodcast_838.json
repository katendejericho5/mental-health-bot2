    "transcript": "one of my favorite quotes is that the\nJourney of a Thousand Miles begins with\na single step one of the things that I\nfound after coaching tens of thousands\nof people that holds them back the most\nis they start thinking about mile\n487 instead of looking down at their\nfeet and ask themselves the question\nwhat is the next best step that I need\nto take and so if you're out there and\nyou're struggling just remember this you\ndon't have to take all the steps at once\njust take the next best step for your\nfuture"
