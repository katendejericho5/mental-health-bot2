and if you're\nlistening to this and you've never\nactually seen this podcast if you go on\nto YouTube if you've ever used that\nlittle thing called YouTube you can\nactually type in my name Rob dial on\nYouTube you can subscribe to us on there\nI get tons of videos of people that are\nwatching me in their living room on\ntheir TVs through YouTube app and all\nthat stuff so if you want to actually\nsee through what we're doing and see us\nhere in the studio some behind the\nscenes go ahead and follow me on YouTube\nas well today we're going to be talking\nabout rejection and I'm going to be\ntalking to you about what most people\nare afraid of which is in some way being\nrejected and then I'm going to teach you\nnumber one why rejection happens and why\nwe're afraid of it but number two why\nthe power of no is so important for you\nin your life and your growth because\nhere's the thing\nlet's be real at some point in time in\nyour life you will be rejected you will\nunless you literally just sit inside of\nyour house from this moment\non throughout your entire life you will\nbe rejected at some point in time in\nyour life there's no real way to get\naround it whether it's a a job\napplication or a scholarship or you go\nup to that person who you've been seeing\nat the gym for a really long time and\nshe's kind of cute and I think she\nthinks I'm kind of cute you walk up to\nher and you get rejected whatever it is\nlet's face it you will eventually face\nrejection in rejection can hurt it\ndoesn't actually hurt us we hurt us when\nwe're thinking about being rejected\nbecause what happens is it can bring up\nthe feelings of unworthiness we can\nbring up the feelings of doubting\nwhether this is what we're actually\nsupposed to be doing with our life it\ncan bring up the feelings of loneliness\nbut what if we could look at rejection\nand a little bit different of a light\nWhat If instead of letting it bring us\ndown or allowing ourselves to bring us\ndown is probably a better way of saying\nit we could use it to actually grow\nourselves learn from it and improve what\nif we could use rejection and as one of\nour strongest\nfacilitator strongest like I think the\nway I think about is like doing sets at\nthe gym right and you're lifting really\nheavy if you want to live really heavy\nthen you want to want to grow you're\ngoing to need a spotter what if you\ncould have like rejection be your\nspotter like you can think of rejection\nas as your sidekick on your way to\nsuccess whatever success means to you\nand so that's what we're going to\nexplore today is the power of no the\npower of being rejected but before I\ndive into it let's talk about why in\nyour mind rejection feels like it hurts\nwhy are we so afraid of it well it's\nvery simple if you go back to the fact\nthat 200 000 years ago we were tribal\nbeings and if we were rejected if we\nwere kicked out of the tribe there was\npretty much no way we were going to live\nrejection basically meant death but\ntoday rejection does not mean death at\nall you could be rejected a hundred\nthousand times\nand not be not be killed not not face\nany sort of death\nbut it can also bring feelings of like\nloss it can feel those so it's like\nrejection\ncan feel like oh my gosh there's\nsomething unsafe here but rejection can\nalso feel like you lost something\nbecause you were so excited about that\njob and you didn't get the job and you\nfeel like you lost it even though you\nnever actually had it it could be the\nrelationship as well oh my gosh I'm so\nexcited to ask her out and then she\nrejects me oh my gosh I've lost that\nthing that I thought I was going to get\nit could be a raise where you're\nrejected for a oh my gosh I thought I\nwas going to make more money and now it\nfeels like loss because the fact that I\ndidn't get that raise that I had my I\ndidn't get that money that I had My Mind\nSet On And It Shines on rejection at its\ncore Shines on one of our biggest\nSecurities it biggest insecurities and\nthat insecurity is unworthiness\nrejection shines a light on one of our\nbiggest insecurities which is\nunworthiness I am not worthy and if I'm\nnot worthy I won't be loved that is one\nof our biggest fears that we have and so\nwhat we do is we\nwe have internalized the belief that our\nworth is tied to some sort of\nachievement\nlike if we don't reach our goals then\nwe're not good enough if she doesn't say\nyes when I ask her out then I'm not good\nenough if my boss doesn't give me a\nraise then I'm not good enough if I\ndon't get this job that I apply for then\nI'm not good enough when in reality\nthose two things are not attached in any\nsort of way but we think that they are\nand so we've internalized the belief\nthat our worth is tied to our\nachievements and if we don't achieve\nthat goal we're not good enough and\nwe're a piece of and we didn't end\nup getting what we wanted to and all of\nthis stuff so when we start to think\nabout that and we take a step back\nwhat can we do instead\nso to not take action\nwould mean that we don't feel those\nfeelings and so what do I do instead of\nfeeling those feelings of insecurity of\nunworthiness I'm just going to do\nnothing we will do everything every\nother action except for the thing that\nneed we need to do to move the needle\nforward\nbecause we don't want to possibly be\nrejected possibly feel unworthy possibly\nfeel like we lost something possibly\nfeel our insecurities and so what do we\ndo nothing that moves our life forward\nwe settle for safe and comfortable but\nbefore we dive into the benefits of\nrejection it's important to know what\nwe're getting rejected for like what we\nfeel like we're getting rejected for\nright so it's really funny because\nwe actually take these insecurities and\nplace them on something where in-screw\ndoesn't need to be there so I'll give\nyou an example for me this is is very\neasy to talk about because I've trained\nthousands of sales people\nand thousands of sales people almost\nevery person struggles with making phone\ncalls almost every person struggles with\nmaking phone calls\nand they don't know why and so they'll\ndo everything that they can they'll\norganize their numbers they'll research\nthese people do everything that they can\nto make them feel like they're working\nwhen in reality they're just being busy\ninstead of productive when the most\nproductive thing they can do is make\nphone calls and so having trained\nthousands of sales people almost\neveryone struggles with making phone\ncalls not because of the rejection of\nsomebody saying no\nbut because somebody's saying no would\nmake us feel like we're getting rejected\nas a human and so it's not that we're\nafraid of the no we're afraid of the no\nmaking us feel like we're not worthy and\nwe think and that's why it's important\nto be like what am I actually being\nrejected for\nif I'm a salesperson and I go and make a\npresentation I get in front of somebody\nand they say no to me are they saying no\nto me as a person no\nin reality all they're doing is just\nsaying no to a business proposal\nthe no is just the sales process that's\nthat's it they're saying no to the\nbusiness proposal they're not saying no\nrob you suck\nbut we think to ourselves that that's\nwhat's actually happening and so we try\nto avoid it we personalize something\nthat shouldn't be personal in the first\nplace it's just no to buying a product\nis every person going to buy a product\nfrom you no of course not but we take\nthis and we change it in morph it\nsubconsciously most of the time most of\nthe time we're not even consciously\nthinking about this but we take no is\nthat in this example and there's many\nexamples and we change it and we morph\nit and we make it all about ourselves\nbecause all people are narcissists in\nsome sort of way\nhow is that so don't have time for it in\nthis podcast but we think everything is\nour fault the world revolves around us\nand if somebody says no to our business\nproposal they're actually saying no to\nus so we morph it and change it and\nthinking that I'm not enough and I don't\nwant someone to I don't want to think\nthat I'm not enough so we avoid it we\navoid making the phone calls we avoid\ndoing the things that we actually should\ndo because we're afraid of what will\nhappen if we actually step out into the\nunknown but there's many benefits of no\nthere's many benefits of getting\nrejected and that's what we're going to\ncover today is the actual benefits of\ngoing out of your comfort zone and\nactually getting the phrase no and being\nuneasy with the feeling of unworthiness\nand uneasy knowing that these things\nwill probably come up\nwith I don't feel like I'm enough and\nfeeling those and going this isn't true\nthe person just said no to my business\nproposal so the first thing that's\nreally important about the benefit of no\nis it gets us out of our comfort zone\nwe have to feel the feelings of fear and\ndo it anyways because fear never\nactually goes away someone asked me the\nother day I was on a zoom call with one\nof the the programs that I teach and one\nof the ladies there said Rob like what's\nthe secrets like what's the secret sauce\nto overcoming fear and I was like well\nif you can figure that out please let me\nknow because there's no magic pill\nthere's not there's no magic pill like\nhey if you do this thing you'll never\nfeel fear again feel or disappear no\nfear is always going to be present\nexpect that fear is always going to be\npresent but feel the fear and do it\nanyways\nfeel your fear whatever that fear is\nthat you're feeling inside of your body\nand do it anyways if you never get\nrejected you never leave your comfort\nzone and your destiny is to have the\nsame life you currently have\nthat's just the honest truth if you\nnever leave your comfort zone you never\nget rejected you never put yourself out\nof your comfort zone your destiny is to\nhave the exact same life that you\ncurrently have and if you're listening\nthis podcast I don't think that you want\nthe same life that you currently have\nand if we never hear no it can mean that\nwe're not taking enough risks and it\ndoesn't mean that we're not good enough\nsmart enough or pretty enough or not a\ngood parent any of those things it just\nmeans that hey you're sitting in your\ncomfort zone and you're not going and\ntake any risks so how can we use this to\ngo you know what I got rejected I put\nmyself out of my comfort zone that's a\ngood thing I was you know what I did\nfeel fear before actually making that\ncold call did the person hang up on me\nthey did but you know what I did\nsomething that I was afraid of and that\nright there in itself is a win so how\ncan we turn rejection into a positive\nforce in our lives\nI had a a video I saw years ago and I\nremember as a a TED Talk and a Blog that\nthis guy had and this guy was afraid\nlike he was a decided to leave his job\nand become an entrepreneur and with\nbeing an entrepreneur you have to be\nrejected a lot of times and you realize\nhe was holding himself back because he\nwas afraid of rejection he was 30 years\nold and he heard about this idea called\nrejection therapy and rejection therapy\nis is what he was reading a book about\nhe said you know what I believe in this\nI'm going to try for a hundred days just\nto go out ask for something completely\nridiculous\nand just be rejected and so his only\ngoal was to go out and be rejected every\nsingle day and then he filmed it and he\nblogged it\nlike he did crazy stuff too he went to a\nburger place he ate the burger and then\nhe walked up to the front and said hey\ncan I get a burger refill\nyou're like no he decided one day he was\ngoing to walk into a dog groomer and ask\nthem to cut his hair like a German\nShepherd he walked into a Super Bowl\nparty with chips for people that he\ndidn't know he just heard a party going\non one time he went and got some chips\nknocks on the door\nthey open he goes hey I brought chips\ncan I join your party\nthey ended up saying yes and so he just\ndid these things where he was like I'm\ngonna get rejected and be okay with\nrejection okay with rejection okay with\nrejection and he got a lot of no's and\nhe became better with rejection but what\nwas really surprising about the entire\nthing is he got a lot more yeses than he\nwas expecting he knocked on a random\nperson's door and asked them he had a\nsoccer ball in his hand knocks on a\nrandom person's door and just asked the\nguy if he could play soccer in his\nbackyard and the guy said yeah sure come\non in the guy just let him play soccer\nin his backyard by himself he was like\nhe didn't expect him to say yes but he's\nlike screw it I'll go ahead and do it\nanyways he walked up to a police officer\nin his car and he said hey can I drive\nyour he said hey can I drive your car\nand pretend like I'm a cop and the cop\nsaid yeah go for it and took pictures of\nhim pretending that he was a cop in his\ncop car and let him drive it\nhe was on a plane one time and he asked\na flight attendant if he could read the\nsafety announcement and they said yes\nand so he read the safety announcement\nhe went into a Krispy Kreme donuts and\nasked them hey can you take five donuts\nand Link them together to make them look\nlike the Olympic symbol and she's like\num\nyeah I guess that I can and so she did\nit and then at the end he's like okay\nhow much do I owe you and she's like no\nthis is free this was fun I like doing\nthis and so he was blown away at how\nkind people were and how many times he\nwas afraid of being rejected and saw it\nfor sure I'm definitely gonna be\nrejected for this thing and people\ndidn't and what he says is when you open\nyourself up to the world the world will\nopen up to you\nwhen you open yourself up to a world the\nworld will open up to you if you think\nabout like\nC.S Lewis C.S Lewis was rejected 800\ntimes before he got yes first manuscript\nand if he had given up there would be no\nChronicles of Narnia\nthink about that for a second 800 no's\nbefore he finally got a yes\nso what are some other benefits of no\nfirst off the thing that I think is\ngreat about no and being rejected is we\ncan actually use it as a positive\nfeedback mechanism we can we can see oh\nI was rejected if it's if you're in a\nsales process what could I have done\nbetter how could I have listened to my\nProspect more how could I have presented\nit to him better what did it what do\nthey say that maybe I missed and we can\nlearn and we can improve like the first\nthing I think about the first time I\nfelt rejection in this podcast years and\nyears and years ago when I first started\nit at the very it was like I would say\nlike four or five months in\nof this podcast and um I got my first\nnegative podcast review and the first\nthing I popped in my head was her\nwho is she to tell me that I'm not a\ngood podcast for all this stuff and then\nI thought about it and I was like\nmaybe she's right because what it\nactually said I don't remember\nspecifically what it said but it was\nsomething something a little along the\nlines of 1400 episodes and I still can't\nfreaking speak correctly but it was\nsomething along the lines of\nfor running a motivational podcast this\nguy has the most unmotivating voice and\nimmediately what I thought was like\nscrew her who is she she doesn't know\nwhat the hell she's talking about and\nthen after my feelings that insecurities\nand unworthiness went away I went hmm\nI wonder if she has a point\nlike let me listen back and I realize\nbecause of fact during a podcast back in\nthose days there was no cameras that we\nuse any of that stuff because the fact\nthat someone can't see me maybe I need\nto be in more emphatic in the way that I\nspeak maybe I need to use my tone better\nto get across what I'm trying to say and\nit was really really positive feedback\nand I think back to being really\ninsecure in that moment but taking it as\npositive feedback and thinking how can I\nbecome better and I'm super grateful for\nthat lady that left a shitty review\nthat's why we need more people to give\npositive reviews to this podcast so if\nyou do love it please do so but how can\nwe use those rejections as a chance to\nreassess our goals and to make sure that\nwe're doing what we need to do to to to\nget better you know are we pursuing what\ntruly matters to us or are we just\nchasing something that doesn't really\nalign with our passions because we're\njust trying to go for money and we're\nnot really following our true passion\nyou know rejections can be a really good\nwake-up call to make sure that we're not\nsettling and we're doing something that\nreally does make us happy\nanother really good way to turn\nrejection into a positive is to use it\nas a motivator when we get rejected it\ncan be tempting to throw in the towel\nand to just give up\nI've thought about it many times but\nwhat I tend to do is actually use\nrejection as a motivator I love having a\nchip on my shoulder I love seeing like\nan event with people who are whatever\npodcasters or influencers that I was not\ninvited to and feeling the feeling of\nrejection going well they're going to\nknow who I am one day I love the feeling\nof seeing all of these you know oh these\nare the top podcasts in the world and I\nlook and I don't see my name and I'm\nlike okay 10-4 let's go ahead and keep\non going right we can use it as a\nmotivator we can have a chip on our\nshoulder to prove other people wrong so\ninstead of giving up we can use\nrejection as a fuel to actually motivate\nus to work harder and to improve\nourselves\nlike rejection can be a really tough\npill to swallow\nit can it brings up all of the feelings\nof insecurity and when you you know the\nthoughts of when you you weren't picked\nfor the Kickball team and you were the\nlast kid and nobody picked you like it\ncould bring up all those feelings of\ninsecurity it can be a really tough pill\nto swallow but it could be a great\nopportunity for us to learn from our\nmistakes and come back even stronger\nthan we were before\nanother thing that we can do we can use\nrejection as a way to build our\nresilience you know when we're faced\nwith failures we're faced with messing\nup we're faced with any of those things\nit's really easy to get discouraged like\ngetting discouraged and losing faith in\nyourself is an easy thing to do\nbut it's harder to go I'm going to\ncontinue to keep going anyways I'm going\nto build this resistance resilience I'm\ngoing to keep going I'm going to use\nthis as fuel to keep me going but\ninstead of letting those rejections that\ncome at us Define us we can use them as\na chance to actually develop resist\nresilience inside of us and learn how we\ncan bounce back whenever times get tough\nbecause there will be tough times no\nmatter what you're going to be rejecting\nlife people are going to die things that\nyou thought were going to happen are not\ngoing to happen how can we use those\nrejections as a as a chance the power of\nrejection the power of no the power of\nnot feeling good enough as a way to\nactually bounce like really get\nourselves to be good at bouncing back\nwhen we get into tough times and we can\nlearn how to handle rejection we can\nhandle setbacks we become more resilient\nand better equipped to handle all of the\nchallenges we might get in the future\nso when you start to think about this\nrejection can it be scary yes can it can\nwe not want to do something yes can we\nfeel unworthy unlovable that we lost\nsomething yes but we can also look at it\nin a completely different light and say\n10-4 let's go this is what I was built\nfor continue to reject me to continue to\nthink that I'm not good enough continue\nto doubt me continue to give me feedback\nso I can learn to get better so the next\ntime we're faced with rejection don't\nlet it get you down use it as a chance\nto grow yourself to learn to find new\nopportunities remember every no is just\none more step closer to a yes and who\nknows the next yes could be the one that\ncompletely changes your life but if you\njust decide to fall away and not take\naction your life will never change\nbecause you didn't go for that next yes\nso instead of letting rejection hold you\nback embrace it learn from it and use it\nas a way to grow and improve yourself so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Junior Rob i a l j\nr and I'm Gonna Leave You the same way I\nleave you every single episode make it\nyour mission to make someone else's day\nbetter I
