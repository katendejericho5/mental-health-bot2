    "transcript": "hey I heard a quote one time that said\ninstead of asking a clown why it's\nacting like a clown ask yourself why you\nkeep hanging out at the circus see some\npeople have shown you who they are\nthey've shown you how they act and\nthey've shown you how they're going to\ntreat you and at some point in time you\nhave to be enough of an adult to decide\nto walk away to decide that your\nmentality and the way that you think and\nthe way that you feel is more important\nthan spending time with those people\nbecause sometimes it's just better to be\nby yourself than to be by somebody who\ndoesn't treat you the way that you\ndeserve to be treated"
