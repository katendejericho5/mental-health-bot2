show\nthis podcast people have never listened\nto it before so if you want to help us\ngrow and you want to help us impact more\nlives just give us a rating and review I\nwould greatly appreciate it today I'm\ngoing to be talking about where you're\ngoing I'm going to be talking about how\nto turn your life around no matter where\nyou are I don't care where you're like\nin fact if I'm being like fully\ntransparent I don't really care where\nyour life is right now whether it is\namazing or whether it's complete\ndoes it really matter what I'm more\nworried about and what I care more about\nis where you're going like what\ndirection your life is heading in\nbecause you could have like\na terrible past you could have not the\nbest circumstances right now but if you\nare heading in the right direction you\nwill eventually get where you're trying\nto go and we're going to talk about that\ntoday we're going to talk about where\nyou're going but most importantly how to\nactually get there and I'm going to talk\nabout this first the first thing I want\nto say is that we live in a world where\nI think it's getting harder and harder\nand harder to be patient it's really\nhard to be patient nowadays and the\nreason why is because we expect\neverything to happen right away like if\nI have any question in the entire world\nI can just literally Google it\nhey how fast is the speed of light and\nimmediately I know exactly how fast the\nspeed of light is when I was a kid that\nwasn't an option like we would have to\ngo to the library I'd have to ride my\nbicycle to the library and hope that\nwhen I got there the right encyclopedia\nwas there and if it wasn't I would never\nknow how fast the speed of light is now\nit's like I have a question I have an\nanswer I have a question I have an\nanswer if I want something I go in on\nAmazon there's a lot of times I can get\nit delivered today if I want to want to\nget to some place and I don't want to\ndrive I can literally hire a taxi\nbasically and have an Uber or a Lyft\narrive at my house within the next like\nfive minutes if I'm hungry I don't even\nhave to get my ass off the couch I can\nliterally just order some food and get\nfood delivered to my house and not have\nto go anywhere if I don't want to go\ninto the grocery store because I never\never want to go in any grocery stores I\njust have my groceries delivered to me\nand that's just set up that way like\nevery morning I just wake up and the\nfood delivery is already there it's wild\nand so we're we're actually starting to\ntrain ourselves to want things\nimmediately\nI think this is why so many people are\nsad that they don't have the success\nthey want because they think they're\ngoing to work for four days and they're\ngoing to have the success they want like\nhow ridiculous is that to think you know\nwhat I'm going to work for four days and\nthen I'm gonna have a million dollar\nbusiness like it doesn't work that way\nthere are some things that that the\nconvenience of Google the convenience of\nAmazon Uber are just not going to be\nable to help us with like I'm I can't\njust go on Amazon and just get in\novernight shipping uh a million dollar\nbusiness it doesn't happen that way\ngreat things take time to build the body\nthat you want you can't just walk into\nthe gym and think that you're going to\nleave the gym with a six-pack it doesn't\nwork that way like there are things that\njust take time\nit's like going oh she's pregnant could\nwe hurry this up can we get it done in\nthe next three months no you can't\nyou've got to wait for great things take\ntime creating a baby takes time creating\na six-pack takes time creating a million\ndollar business takes time\nbut we're starting to be trained more\nand more and more to expect things\nimmediately and that's just not the way\nthat the world really actually works\nthat's the way that the internet has\nprovided us the convenience for a lot of\nthings but don't don't misconstrue\nconvenience for the way the entire world\nworks you know if you think about like\na hundred years ago if you wanted some\nstrawberries 100 years ago you would\nhave to go buy the seeds hopefully\nwhatever grocery store you went to or\nwhatever place it was had the seeds\nlet's say not even 100 years ago let's\nsay 300 years ago you wanted\nstrawberries just because we're probably\ngrocery stores 100 years ago let's say\n300 years ago you wanted strawberries\nyou'd have to go and see if you could\nfind Strawberry seeds you would have to\nwait for the right time of year to plant\nyour strawberry seeds you would have to\nplant your strawberry seeds you would\nhave to water them you'd have to take\ncare of them for a few months you'd have\nto make sure they get the right amount\nof sun and hopefully in these few months\nthat you're trying to grow these\nstrawberries I mean you've been waiting\nlike six months for the right time of\nyear you've planted them it's been a\ncouple months for them to start growing\nhopefully another animal doesn't come\nand eat them before you do like right\nbefore they start to ripen\nnow I can literally sit on my couch have\na craving for strawberries go on my\niPhone order them and some dude named\nTravis who's a student at the local\nUniversity will deliver them to my front\ndoor and my big ass doesn't even have to\nget off the couch right like it's pretty\ncrazy if you think about it\nso it used to take a long time like\ngoing and getting strawberry seeds\ngetting the strawberries to grow waiting\nfor the right time of year all which\ntook months and months and months now\nit's just like I get them delivered to\nthe door and I'm like um that was that\ntook too long oh my gosh these aren't as\nripe as I wanted them to be like if we\ncould complain about the fact that we\nliterally like magic just happened I\njust got strawberries delivered to my\ndoor and that's what I wanted it didn't\nused to be that way but we've been\nindoctrinated to believe that everything\nhappens this way\nand we've been indoctrinated to have\ninstant gratification we can't have\ninstant gratification for everything\nbecause that's not the way the way that\nthat most things work\nbirthing a child like I said imagine a\nhusband going up and be like hey honey\nlike I would like to go can we either\nlike speed this process up if we could\njust like I know the baby's supposed to\ntake nine months to be ready but like do\nyou think maybe you could try to speed\nit up when you're done in three so we\ncould take a vacation by the end of the\nyear you'd be like this guy must be\ninsane\nwhy is it any different with a business\nwhy is it any different with the fitness\nthat you want why is it any different\nwith the relationship all of these\nthings take time and today I'm going to\ntalk to you about why the direction that\nyou're heading in is way more important\nthan the speed that you're going at\nbecause everybody wants speed\nimmediately right we see these people\nthat are like 27 years old like this\nrandom completely out of the ordinary\nkid builds an app and becomes a\nbillionaire in like six months that's\nnot normal right that's just not normal\nis it happen sure could it happen to us\nmaybe but I don't have an idea that's\nthat good so so many people get an idea\nfor a business\nthey start the business maybe they do a\nlittle bit of research they put in some\nwork and three months later they're\npissed off that they're not doing a\nmillion dollars a month yet and they're\njust like this must not have been the\nright business or maybe I'm just not\nthat good of a business person I'll just\ngo back to my nine to five no that's\njust not how business works you know it\nusually just doesn't blow up like that\ndo some companies like the Unicorn\ncompanies\nsure but it takes time like if I look at\nmy business right\nif I would have given up in three three\nmonths I would have never grown my\nbusiness it took me three and a half\nyears for my business to first hit its\nfirst million dollars right what if I\nwould have given up in the beginning\nbecause I was like it must not be right\nyeah I must not I must not be good\nenough I'm not smart enough it's like it\nI constantly the the older that I get\nthe more the Tony Robbins phrase people\nunderestimate what they could do in a\nyear they they overestimate what they\ncan do in a year but they underestimate\nwhat they can do in a decade\nsomebody say that again people\noverestimate what they can do in a year\nbut they underestimate they could do in\na decade they think that things are\ngoing to happen quicker then they're\nsupposed to but when you look at the\nnext 10 years it's usually a lot bigger\nthan you actually thought it could be\nlike now my business worth seven and a\nhalf years into it and I like I really\nget that phrase I really get that phrase\nnow\ndid I want to run a million dollar\nbusiness when I first started it sure\nbut just like the strawberries it takes\ntime to grow there's mistakes that need\nto be had there's things that have to\nhappen in this world there's knowledge\nthat I have to get into my brain there's\nthings that I have to up really bad\nin order to not do that again like\nthere's things I have to learn\nand everybody wants like I keep using\nthe business example everybody wants a\nsuccessful business\nbut if you look at like\na lot of people look at like the first\nperson pops in my head is Andy frisella\nright Andy frisella runs a hundred\nmillion dollar a year company right now\nbut if you listen to a story he barely\nbroke even for the first two years and\nhim and his brother slept in their\nwarehouse because they couldn't afford\nrent\nright everybody sees 100 million dollar\nyour business they're like I want that I\nwant that\nvery few people are willing to work\nbarely break even and also sleep inside\nof the warehouse for two years but they\nhave to put in the work they have to put\nin all of the groundwork and all the\nhard work in order for it to become like\nyou've got to have for him in his case\nand the way that his company matured he\nhad to have those two years of sleeping\nin the warehouse in order to build a 100\nmillion dollar your business so it\nreally comes down to like how bad do you\nwant it if people overestimated they\ncould do in a year\nbut they underestimated they could do in\na decade are you willing to go this\nbusiness I'm starting today I'm going to\nput 10 years into it\nare you that's the mindset that you have\nto have\nlike we were talking today my team and I\nwere the executives on the team\nwe were talking about something we were\nworking on I said I'm not focusing on\nthis year I'm focusing on what we're\ngoing to be doing in 10 years and that's\nthe actual Vision that I'm trying to\nwork off of I'm not going to make little\ntiny decisions of like oh we can make\nmoney here and we can do this it's like\nno\nwhere are we going where do I want to be\nin 10 years what's the direction that\nwe're heading and I want to take actions\nthat are in line with that and so it\ncomes back to how bad do you really want\nit like you have to realize it's going\nto take time slow and steady wins the\nrace so many people are the hair\nnowadays\nI just want to be the tortoise like I'm\njust gonna slow and steady win the race\nI used to love tortoise the hair when I\nwas a kid so I think it's just ingrained\ninto me of like slow and steady wins the\nrace slow and steady like I will just I\nmade up my mind years ago I will just\nOutlast everybody\nthat's just what I'm okay with doing all\nright could I go and try to speed things\nup maybe\nis it gonna work out the way I want to\nmaybe maybe not but I'm cool with slow\nand steady wins the race I'm just\nfocusing on the direction that I'm\nheading and if I'm heading in the right\ndirection no matter how fast I'm going\neventually I'm going to get there and if\nyou just don't stop you can't fail like\nwhat's crazy is that so many people are\nafraid of failing\nlike they start a business and then they\nbecome afraid of failing at that\nbusiness\nso they close the business down and I'm\nlike wait\nso you're afraid of failing so you\nfailed faster like that doesn't make any\nsense in my head you're afraid of\nfailing so what you did was you took all\nof the wrong actions so that or and shut\nit down so that you would then fail\nfaster so this thing that you're afraid\nof you created quicker\nnow if you just don't give up\nthat's impossible to fail at something\nif you just continue to build the\nbusiness\nyou will eventually have a successful\nbusiness could the business suck for two\nthree four years it could could it take\noff year seven it could could it take\noff month seven it could I don't know\nhow long the universe has decided that\nit's going to take for you to get x y z\nwhatever it is but as long as you're\nheading in the right direction you will\neventually get there so we talk about\ntime and how long things how long things\ncan take that's why I don't really care\nabout the speed that you're going right\nso let's talk about where you are going\nbecause that's the most important part\nof everything because if you're heading\nthe right direction and you don't stop\neventually you're going to get there\nlike it just it just makes sense like if\nif I live\nin Miami\nand I decide that I'm gonna just start\nwalking North on I-95 eventually I'm\ngoing to end up in Jacksonville it's\njust the way it goes like I could I get\nthere faster sure can I take a bike\ncould I take a car can I take a plane\nyeah but sometimes bike car and plane\ndon't exist when you're building a\nbusiness when you're building a great\nrelationship when you're raising great\nchildren sometimes these things just\ntake time to mature and it's kind of\nlike God and the universe has its own\ntime that things will happen I just got\nto make sure that myself I'm taking the\nright action and I'm heading in the\nright direction because if you think\nabout it like I said if you if you just\nare heading in the right direction you\njust don't stop eventually you're going\nto get there so where are you going in\nyour life do you know do you know where\nyou want your life to be like a lot of\ntimes I'll sit down with people and I'll\nsay so what do you want in life then\nthey're like oh well\nyou know I I don't want I don't want\nthis and I don't want this and I know\nthis and I'm like whoa whoa I didn't ask\nwhat you don't want I want to know what\nyou want and they're like okay what do I\nwant well I do want this and I do want\nthis and\nand I don't want this and I don't want\nthis and I don't want this and I'm like\nhold on how do we get back onto what you\ndon't want I don't give a damn about\nwhat you don't want I want to know what\nyou want so many people are just not\nclear on exactly what it is that they\nwant in life and then they get pissed\noff that they don't get it it's like\nit's in the Bible I think right asking\nyou shall receive are you just asking\nfor what you want like are you very\nclear on what it is that you want and\nasking for it and working towards and\nheading in the right direction every\nsingle day it's like what are your goals\nfor the next year what are your goals\nfor the next five years for the next 10\nyears like have you sat down with a pen\nand paper and actually written down what\nit is that you want what do I want\nwhat do I want to be who do I want to be\nwhat what do I want the people in my\nlife to look like how do I want to serve\nwhat do I want the people in my life to\nbe who do I want to be surrounded by how\nmuch money do I want to make where do I\nwant to live who do I want to marry do I\nwant kids how many kids what do I want\nmy kids to be like do I how do I want to\ntreat my family and you start getting\nreally clear on what it is that you're\ntrying to create and you get really\nclear and after you get really clear on\nwhere you're going then what you need to\ndo is you need to make a plan of how to\nactually get there like with pen and\npaper not in your own freaking head the\namount of people that try to plan out\ntheir lives and figure out what they\nwant in their heads is is crazy it\ndoesn't make any sense only three\npercent of people write down their goals\n97 of people either don't set goals or\nthey don't write them down\nhow are you going to plan out your\nentire life and what you want without\nwriting it down do you have a plan\nwhere you want to go the exam I always\nlove to give this example right so the\nimmediate thing that pops in my head is\nthis you know let's say we're in Miami\nagain and we have decided to Charter a\nboat and this boat is going to take us\nover to the Bahamas right and you can go\nfrom Miami to the Bahamas it's not too\nlong of a ride it's like a couple hours\nlet's say we you know sun's coming up\nit's a beautiful day we're walking out\nto all of the boats and we asked the\ncaptain hey where are we going\nand he's like oh we're going in uh that\nthat direction over there and you're\nlike what what direction he's like oh\nthat that direction over and he's kind\nof moving his finger around we're moving\nin that direction okay\num how long is it gonna take oh it\nshould take between like\nit should take like a couple hours a few\nout maybe two to three hours and you're\nlike okay\num what are the Seas like he's like oh\nactually I don't I don't I don't know I\nhaven't checked the Seas today so you\ndon't know what the weather's like nah\nI'm not really sure what the seas are\nlike I don't know what the weather's\nlike\nand you're like okay would you feel\nconfident\nhopping into a boat with a captain going\nfrom Florida Miami over to the Bahamas\nif he doesn't know where he's going he\ndoesn't know like how long about it\nmight take he doesn't know what the seas\nare looking like the weather's looking\nlike any of that stuff would you\nactually have that guy take you across\nhell no you wouldn't because you\nprobably capsized and end up on the\nbottom side of that boat when it's\nflipped over and hope that the Coast\nGuard comes and gets you right\nit's wild and so would you feel more\nconfident if you sat down you said with\nthe captain hey where are you going he's\nlike oh we're going to be heading that\ndirection East and a couple degrees off\nto the side so we're basically going\nthis direction cool how long is going to\ntake about an hour and 15 minutes if\nwe're heading at 30 knots okay cool\nwhat's the weather look like oh man it's\nperfect weather it's gonna be perfect\nweather you might as well just crack\nopen a beer Caesar real small there's no\nrain nothing like that it's gonna be a\ngreat ride over\nwhat song do you want to listen to I'd\nbe like yeah that's the captain I'd\nrather go with right like that's it's\nfunny because you can see that but how\nmany of you living your life listening\nto my voice right now or living your\nlife like the very first example of the\ncaptain it's like we're just gonna go\nsomewhere that direction how's it going\nto take but I don't know what's the\nseason look like I don't know like no\nDirection\njust going with whatever life throws at\nyou just going with the wins and going\nwith the tides right like you have to\nknow where you want to go you have to\nknow where you're going you have to know\nwhat it's going to take to get there and\nthen after this after you figure out\nwhere you want to go and you've created\na plan you make check-ins with yourself\nyou make a daily check-in and you make a\nweekly check-in and all I care about is\nthat today you're making the right I\ndon't give a I don't give a damn about\ntomorrow tomorrow does not matter at all\nto me and it shouldn't matter to you\nwhat I care about today is did I take\none step in the right direction\nright tomorrow all I care about is did I\ntake the next step in the right\ndirection if I'm walking from Miami to\nJacksonville and I go one step at a time\nas long as I'm taking the right steps\nand I'm taking the steps in the first\nplace but I'm taking the right steps in\nthe right direction eventually I'm going\nto get there\nand you have to realize you will mess up\nyou're going to screw up all the time as\nI like to tell everybody that joins my\nprograms like we teach coaches how to\ngrow coaching businesses right what I\nsay is the first month just it up\nand figure it out just be okay with\n everything up right it's not\nabout being perfect it's about getting\nmore tally marks in the win category\nthan the loss category you know are you\ngoing to wake up every single morning on\ntime no are you gonna hit the snooze\nbutton sometimes yes but are you waking\nup earlier more than you're not waking\nup that's what matters are you heading\nin the right direction because your\ndirection is so much more important than\nyour speed and if you can remind\nyourself of that and just remind\nyourself to keep heading in the right\ndirection eventually you get to where\nyou're trying to go so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on the\nInstagram stories and tag me at Rob dial\nJunior Rob d-i-a-l-jr\nand I'm Gonna Leave the same way I leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission to make someone else's
