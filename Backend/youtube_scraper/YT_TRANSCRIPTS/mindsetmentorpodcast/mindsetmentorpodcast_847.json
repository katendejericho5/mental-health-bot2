tricks every single\nMonday on how to improve your mindset so\nonce again Monday email.com and I'll\nstart sending them straight to your\ninbox today I'm going to give you three\ndifferent strategies to help you learn\nand read faster and I'm going to teach\nyou strategies that I have used for\nreading faster but also making sure that\nthe information that I do read and do\nlearn I actually get better at retaining\nI'll tell you this I'll be honest with\nyou I hate reading but I love learning\nand so I think this is important and\nthis episode came about I've shared this\nbefore in the past a little bit about\nthis in the past but for some reason so\nmany people still don't know that this\nexists and the other day\nI was reading and one of my friends was\nlike what the hell are you doing and I\nwas like what do you mean I was like I'm\nreading and they're like all right well\ntell me about this because this looks\ncompletely different than what I've seen\nit wasn't like I was reading upside down\nor anything like that\nbut I have a way of reading\nso that I can learn faster and I can get\nmore information in my head and so the\nfirst thing I recommend is this is to\nhave a Kindle now you can go out and buy\na Kindle you can use an iPad you can use\nyour iPhone you can use all of those\nthings and download the Kindle app and\nwhen you buy something on Amazon now let\nme pause real quick let me say this\nevery time I give this example some must\nbe like well I like physical books yeah\nI like physical books more too\nbut I learned this when I when I\nactually went and traveled for six\nmonths I couldn't bring a bunch of books\nto me so I had to use my iPad that I had\nat the time and I started getting used\nto using Kindle and this these tips I'm\ngoing to give you are going to help you\nout a ton and so you have Kindle and\nwhen you buy a book on Amazon I would\nsay probably 85 to 90 percent of the\ntime right under the button that says\nbuy now there's a little check box and\nit will say add audible narration\nfor like seven dollars whatever it is\nwhat's kind of crazy about it when you\nadd audible narration you automatically\nget the audiobook and a lot of times I\ndon't know why it is this way the\naudiobook will be like thirty dollars\nbut the Kindle with audible narration\nends up being like 20 bucks so it ends\nup being cheaper for you to actually get\nthe Kindle version and the audiobook\nversion which is called audible\nnarration\nand for a lot of these books most of\nthem they have something called\nWhispersync and Whisper sync is this and\nthis is why I like using my iPads\nbecause my iPad has a uh actual speakers\non it and a lot of Kindles do not\nwhat's cool about it is that you\ndownload onto your Kindle and then what\nyou do is you actually download the\naudiobook onto onto the Kindle app as\nwell and when you push play to the\naudiobook inside of the Kindle app it\nwill actually read it out loud to you\nin the words that it is on it will\nactually highlight so you know exactly\nwhere you are you know exactly where you\nare in the book so if you happen to take\nyour eyes away\nand you happen to know so my gosh I just\nwasn't paying attention for a few\nminutes you literally can find out\nexactly where you are because all you\nhave to do is look down and so what\nit'll do is it'll read the audiobook out\nloud to you while highlighting every\nsingle word as you go through what I do\nis I will take it and I'll turn it on to\n2 to 3x speed so I'm learning\ntwo to three times faster I'm reading\nthrough is two times two to three times\nfaster and it's a fact that humans can\ncan hear four times faster than they can\nread and so if you can hear somebody say\nsomething to you faster you're actually\nprocessing it quicker than if you\nactually just read the book on its own\nand so you can start to plow through\nbooks this way you also retain the\ninformation better here's the reason why\nbecause when you're reading you're just\nlooking you're using your your site\nwhich is just one of your five senses\nto actually read that but when you're\nusing this which is the Kindle book\nyou're reading it with your eyes and\nyou're also hearing somebody say it\nyou're using two of your senses which is\nSight and Sound using two different\nparts of your brain to actually retain\nthis information and if you really want\nto like add extra learning on top of it\nif you're walking around it actually\nbrings in the sense of feeling and so\nthey found that if you walk around and\nread just Pace back and forth I don't do\nthis but you can if you'd like to you\ncan Pace back and forth and it actually\nhelps to retain the information even\nbetter\nso why is this good number one you get\nto hear it you get to see it number two\nwhat's cool about as well is it's\ncheaper a lot of times number three you\ncan also highlight different parts of\nthe book so for me I'm the type of\nperson where I sit down and read a book\nI highlight it I make notes I write\nwords all of this stuff you can go into\na book and Kindle in the exact same way\nI should be I swear I should be\nsponsored by Kindle because I've told\nthis so many times to so many people I\nshould be able to get some sort of like\ncommission back for how many times I've\nI've pushed people over to doing this\nbut what's cool is on Kindle you can\nhighlight stuff you can note like put\nnotes like actually type notes in there\nas well\nand then here's the cool thing about it\nif I'm sitting in like the doctor's\noffice or like the other day I was over\nand I was getting my tires changed in my\ntruck I had to get forwarding tires took\nlike an hour and a half right instead of\nsitting down and being on Instagram the\nentire time what I did was I went back\nthrough all of these past books I went\nactually through three different books\nthat I have read in the past and what I\ndid was instead of reading the entire\nbook\nall I did was read the highlighted\nsections so I went back and there were\nthese books like very complex books that\nI read from like Alan Watts in the past\nand\nif you've ever read an Alan Watts book\nyou have to read every page like three\ntimes and so there's this one book that\nI had read\num I think it was called the uh the\nwisdom of insecurity or something around\ninsecurity I think it's a wisdom of\ninsecurity is actually what it is\nIncredible Book really quite difficult\nto read and get all of it into your\nbrain but I went back the other day when\nI was getting my tires changed and\nre-read all of the highlights from that\nbook the parts that stood out to me the\nmost imagine how much more you would\nlearn If instead of sitting down and\nscrolling on Instagram for 30 minutes as\nyou sat down on your phone and you were\nable to actually look through all the\nheights of the book what's cool about is\nthis because of the fact that it's on\nKindle all of my Kindles are all\ncompletely synced together and so my\niPad if I go in and I highlight\nsomething in my iPad\nand then I go in my phone it's going to\nbe highlighted in my phone as well and\nso no matter what platform I'm using I'm\nable to carry it with me which is the\nthing that I like about it so do I love\nthe physical copy of a book I do do I\nlove writing on a page and highlighting\na page I do but what I do love is being\nable to learn this information and take\nit with me at my fingertips Everywhere I\nGo\nand it's cool because I remember there\nwas one time I was telling my friend\nabout this actually the same book this\nwisdom and security book and he's like\nwell what did you get from it I was like\nwell let me just go ahead and pull it up\nand I pulled it up my phone and I went\nthrough it and I actually saw it the\nother thing I like about using this\ntechnique as well\nis that I'll read in the morning\nsometimes and I'll be using the whisper\nsync and all that and I'll be really\ninto a book but I've got a life I've got\nto live I've got things I got to do so\nthen I'll go and I'll take a shower and\nwhat's cool is because it's the\naudiobook I can literally push play and\nI can be reading the book in the morning\nI could be listening to the audiobook\nwhile I'm in the shower as I'm driving\nto go to the office I can listen to the\naudiobook there and so I can retain so\nmuch information I can crank through\nbooks so much faster because I can read\nthem and then when I'm driving or when\nI'm in the shower or when I'm cooking or\nsomething like that I can actually\nlisten to the audiobooks as well and so\na physical copy of a book yeah sure it's\ngreat but if you want to actually start\ngetting a lot more information into your\nbrain I just recommend that you use\nKindle and use Audible narration with it\nas well it's just a little bit you know\nyou just click that extra thing it's\nlike usually 7.49 extra and it allows\nyou to have the entire Kindle book\ndownload it onto your phone download it\nonto your iPad and then the entire\naudible narration so the audiobook is\nwell\nI promise you use this technique you\nwill get through books so much faster\nthan if you just sit down you know turn\nthe light on and sit down on your couch\nand read a book you'll get through so\nmany more books so much faster okay so\nthat's the first time I'm gonna give you\ndo it just try it try it for one book\nand just let me know your thoughts okay\nthat's tip number one tip number two is\nto use the Pomodoro Technique that is 25\nminutes on five minutes off\nthere's actual actually like a whole lot\nof stays around the Pomodoro Technique\nand how well this works it's actually\ngoing to be in my book and I'm going to\nexplain everything that's in there as\nwell but to give you a quick\nsummarization of the Pomodoro Technique\nand why it works so well you do 25\nminutes of reading or learning something\nand you take five minutes off where you\ndo absolutely nothing\nhere's the reason why it's so magical to\nuse the Pomodoro Technique so it's 25\nminutes on five minutes off 25 minutes\non five minutes off 24 minutes on five\nminutes off and after three sessions\nwhich is an hour and a half total you\ntake about 20 minutes off and then you\ncan go back into doing more Pomodoro\ntechniques when you focus on one thing\nand one thing only and you turn off all\nthe notification notifications on your\nphone you turn off all of the things you\njust go I'm gonna do this one thing and\none thing only and you take five minutes\noff those five minutes off\ndon't look at your phone don't go do\nsomething else either close your eyes\nand just take a few deep breaths and\njust meditate for five minutes or go on\na walk or go outside and this allow your\neyes so your peripheral vision just to\ncome in and so instead of being focus\nfocus focused and you're just looking\ndown at your book all the time after\nthose 25 minutes\nyou end up going outside and you like\nyou allow your eyes to dilate you allow\nyourself to see your peripheral vision\nhere's the reason why uh Andrew huberman\ncalls this calls it non-sleep deep rest\nso non-sleep deep rest so you're not\nsleeping but you're putting your brain\ninto like a recharge mode when you fall\nasleep that's when your brain takes all\nof the information that you learn from\nthe day\nand stores it into your brain and a lot\nof times it goes through something\ncalled your hippocampus and it goes and\nactually circulates that information\nover 60 times faster than your brain did\nso you can learn one thing and then your\nbrains over and over and over and over\nand over again 60 times faster replaying\nthat to start to program it into your\nbrain when you do non-sleep deep rest\nyour brain in these five minutes off\nwe'll take the information that you just\nlearned in those 25 minutes and it will\nactually replay it about 20 to 30 times\nfaster and so in those 25 minutes you're\nlearning in those of the Palm Door\ntechnique those 25 minutes you're you're\nlearning those five minutes off of doing\nnothing closing your eyes breathing just\ngoing for a walk or just sitting outside\nand just\nallowing yourself just to exist for five\nminutes your brain is actually starting\nto store that information into your\nbrain so it's kind of like when you have\nyour phone your phone as an update you\ndownload the update and then you've got\nto install the update right when you're\nreading the book you're downloading all\nthe information and then when you're\nresting for those five minutes you're\ninstalling the information into your\nbrain and so use the Pomodoro Technique\nto allow yourself to be able to start to\nlearn faster and then the third thing is\nto take the information that you learn\nand actually teach it to somebody and so\nteaching makes your brain go from\nlearning to implementing in new synaptic\nconnections will it be made in your\nbrain by doing it and if there's nobody\naround like what I always do is I'll\nusually read in the morning\nI'll go up to Lauren and I'll be like oh\nthis is what I learned today and I will\nthen explain it to her this has become\nlike a routine she knows it's going to\nhappen I'll explain it to her and she\nwill listen to me explaining she's like\noh that's really cool that's awesome but\nI know because when I'm learning that's\na passive way of learning when I'm\nteaching that has now become Active\nLearning and you are 10 times more\nlikely to remember something when you\nactively learn it versus passively learn\nit and so that's why they always say the\nbest way to learn something is to teach\nit is because you take passive learning\nand make it Active Learning if there's\nnobody around you like you live by\nyourself and you're reading this book\nbest thing to do take a pen and paper\nand write down what you learned and\nteach it out loud as if there was\nsomebody there and so if you really want\nto install the information into your\nbrain learn you know you do an hour and\na half of learning or whatever it is 25\nminutes on five minutes off 25 minutes\non five minutes off 25 minutes on five\nminutes off that's one whole session 90\nminutes of Pomodoro Technique you take a\npen and paper and you actually start to\njournal out whether you want to do in\npictures whether you want to write\nsentences whether you want to write\nbullet points you write it down and you\nactually start to teach it as if there\nwas somebody there with you you're\ntaking that passive learning and you're\nmaking it Active Learning and that's how\nyou actually start to learn these things\nand install them and install the\nprograms into your Hardware of your\nbrain much faster now\nsome of you are sitting out there and\nyou're like well Rob I'm poor though\nlike I can't I can't just go out and\njust keep buying books all the time\ngo to the library\ngo to the library and get a physical\ncopy if that's the case you can do that\nor you can go there's apps like\noverdrive where you can download audio\nbooks for free from your local library\nand so like if your local library\nhappens to have How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People on audiobook you can\nactually rent that from them for free\nfor however long you need to rent it for\nand you can listen to and this isn't the\nonly one there's overdrive and there's a\ncouple other ones I can't remember the\nnames of them where you can download\naudio books like quote unquote rent them\nfor free\ncosts nothing\ndo you want to know another thing you\ncan do to also learn faster almost every\ntime I find a book that I want to read\nI go into YouTube I type that person's\nname in and I type the title of the book\nalmost always the audiobook will come up\nfor free you can listen to the audiobook\na lot of times absolutely free on\nYouTube now you can't use the Kindle\nwith that and all that stuff but you can\nusually find the audiobooks for free on\nYouTube and a lot of times those people\nwho write these entire books they'll do\nlike an hour-long talk for Stanford or\nsomething like that Stanford will hire\nthem to come in and actually teach the\nbook for an hour an hour and a half to\ntheir their students and you can take\nthat because it's YouTube you can put on\n2x speed and you could take an hour-long\nlecture that teaches all of the core\nparts of somebody's book you can put on\n2x speed and you could take an hour-long\nspeech and learn it in 30 minutes and\nyou can then write down all of the notes\nas a person's talking and when they're\ndone you then re-teach that so there's\nreally no excuse if you're out there to\nnot get knowledge there's no excuse to\nnot be reading there's no excuse to not\nbe consuming content all of the time\nanything that you I mean it's amazing\nthat we live live in this moment because\nanything you want to learn is currently\nat your fingertips like it's literally\nin your pocket you can learn anything\nthat you want to learn at any moment in\ntime and so there's no reason not to\nlearn there's no reason not to be way\nmore intelligent a year from today than\nyou are right now\nand it's like that quote the a man who\ndoes not read has no advantage over man\nwho cannot read\nso when you look at it there was a\nstatistics statistic I saw the other day\nthat said 80 percent of American\nfamilies the households did not buy a\nbook last year eighty percent\nof American households did not buy a\nbook last year\nthere's no reason why they can't go and\nget books there's no reason why they\ncan't listen audiobooks there's no\nreason we all have the time to do it so\nif you want to continue to keep bidding\nbetter better and better and better and\nbetter just keep learning\nI remember one of my mentors he was\ntalking about the the best piece of\nadvice that he ever got from somebody\nthat was his mentor and his mentor\npulled him aside and he they were in a\nrestaurant and he said look at all these\npeople in this restaurant right here\nhe goes he goes because my mentor says\nMentor he goes what's the best if you\ngive me he goes look at all these people\nright here in this restaurant he goes\nall of these people right here they're\nprobably not reading he goes if you just\nfocus on reading and getting more\nknowledge and getting more knowledge and\ngetting more knowledge and you focus on\nthat for the next five years the next 10\nyears you will be light years ahead of\nall of these people and the knowledge\nthat they have\nso right now especially with all these\ntips there's no reason why you can't go\nout there and learn as much as you\npossibly can make knowledge in\ndownloading and installing this new\nknowledge into yourself a part of your\ndaily habit and you fast forward a few\nyears from now there's no one that's\ngoing to be able to compete with you so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ngo ahead and share it on the Instagram\nstories and tag me at Rob
