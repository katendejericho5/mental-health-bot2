    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to be talking about\nmotivation and I'm going to be telling\nyou why you don't want to be motivated\nthere's too many people that message me\nand say hey Rob how do I become more\nmotivated what do I do to get more\nmotivation I am actually on the side of\nI don't actually care if you're\nmotivated or not it doesn't matter to me\nat all because everyone thinks that you\nwant to be motivated oh I want I want to\nbe motivated I want to listen to a\nmotivational speaker and all of that is\nokay but it's actually not what's going\nto help you be successful you don't want\nto be motivated if you're thinking that\nyou need to be motivated before you go\nout and actually take some action you\nwill not get what you want to in this\nworld let me say that again\nif you think that you want to be\nmotivated before you actually go and\ntake action you will not get what you\nwant to in this world if you're\nsearching for motivation you will be\nsearching for a very long time\nbut you're not really searching for\nmotivation you're searching for\nsomething else and that's what I want to\ndive into and talk to you with today\nwhat you really want and what you want\nto build into yourself is not to be a\nmotivated person what you want to build\ninto yourself is to be a consistent\nperson consistency always wins I'm not a\nbetting man I don't really care to bet I\ndon't like gambling any of that but if I\nhad money that I had to bet and it's\nlike hey here's a consistent person on\none side\nand there's a motivated person on the\nother side which one do you want to\nplace your money on which will be the\nmost successful and get what they want\nto out of life which one do you think\nit's going to be I will always take my\nmoney and put on the person who has\ndecided that they are going to be the\nmost consistent and consistency is a\ndecision because motivation is fleeting\nmotivation is a fleeting feeling it is a\nfeeling inside of you\nI don't know about you I don't really\nwake up motivated like some people wake\nup and they're like hey I got it I'm\ngonna go conquer today I've never really\nbeen that person I've never really been\na person just I mean it takes it takes\neffort to get out of bed for me I'm not\na person who just jumps out of bed and\nI'm super excited but consistency on the\nother side consistency is a character\ntrait it is a character trait that can\nbe it doesn't really come wired into you\nit's not like it's you know somebody's\npre-wired to be consistent consistency\nis a part of someone that they decide to\ndevelop so I expect most days that I'm\nnot going to be motivated so if you go\ninto every day\nwanting to be motivated in waiting for\nmotivation in order to take the action\nthat you want you're going to be waiting\nfor a very long time but if you go into\nevery single day saying I don't care\nwhat happens I'm going to be consistent\nand I'm going to get it done\nyou're going to get what you want so\njust expect that most days you're not\nreally going to be the most motivated\nperson you may be if you are hey that\nwould be awesome if you wake up and you\nhappen to be motivated today but if you\nwake up today and you're not motivated\nI want you to focus on being consistent\nwhen you're consistent day in day out\nday in day out you will win and whatever\nit is you're trying to get for in life\nwhen you hope for motivation though you\nlose when you focus on consistency you\nwill win when you hope for motivation\nyou'll lose you know if I am on a a\nweight loss Journey\nand I know like I use weight loss and I\nuse Fitness as an example and the reason\nwhy I use these things is as an example\nso often is because of the fact that\nthat's something physical that you can\nsee like when I talk about making\nmindset changes that's not something\nthat you can physically see in someone's\nbody but if someone decides they want to\ngo on a weight loss journey and over\ntime they are consistent you will start\nto see changes in that person's body\nit's physical you can see it when you\nlook in the mirror if you decide that\nyou are a skinny person you want to\nbuild more muscle if you go and you'd be\nconsistent for a while 60 days from\ntoday you will see a difference when you\nlook in the mirror and so if I'm on a\nweight loss Journey\nI can work out when I'm motivated and I\ncan go you know what I'll just I wanted\nto work out today but\nlet's just wait and see if some\nmotivation just decides to come on in\nI don't want to do that I want to be\nconsistent because consistency says I\nwill work out no matter what I will do\nthis because I said I was going to\nconsistency is I said I was committed to\nworking out today and I'm not going to\ngo to bed until it is done\nnot oh oops oops I just ran out of time\nmaybe tomorrow I'll get my workout in I\nforgot to plan it into my schedule maybe\ntomorrow I can get it done maybe\ntomorrow I'll have some motivation to go\nto the gym maybe tomorrow I'll have some\nmotivation to do what I said I was going\nto do right consistently said I'm going\nto do it and I'm going to do it I'm\ncommitted to getting it done consistency\nsays I'm committed and I'm going to get\nit done today consistency says I'm\ncommitted to making a hundred calls\ntoday consistency says I uh I am\ncommitted to posting a post on my\nInstagram to get leads for my business\nconsistency says I am committed to\nshooting in editing a YouTube video and\nposting it today consistency is I said I\nwas going to do it and no matter what\nhappens my ass is getting it done today\nand I will not go to bed I will not go\nto sleep my head will not hit the pillow\nuntil it's done that's the type of\nperson you want to be you don't want to\nbe a motivated person you don't want to\nbe a hey rah-rah we can do it I feel\ngreat now I'm going to get my my I've\ngot my motivation now I can go ahead and\nstart actually taking the action I want\nto because when you're consistent and\nyou get things done no matter how you\nfeel you actually become more motivated\nbecause motivation is not something\nmotivation is not a prerequisite to\naction motivation there's actually been\nstudies that have found people who are\nconsistent versus motivation versus\nmotivated is people who are consistent\nand take action is instead of motivation\ncoming before action motivation actually\nfollows action most people hope for\nmotivation and then they take action\nwhat needs to happen though\nis you need to take action to give\nyourself a chance at being motivated why\nbecause when your physical body starts\nmoving\nyou actually get more energy you get\nmore motivation you get more drive to\nget done whatever it is you need to get\ndone and so that's what we're going to\ntalk about today is how to be more\nconsistent with everything as you want\nto do if you have goals for this year if\nyou have goals for this quarter whatever\nit might be don't hope that you're going\nto have motivation every single day and\nman you know what if I wake up with\nmotivation then I'll take action on\nthings that I want no no it's like I\ndon't care what happens I don't care\nwhat the what the world throws at me I\ndon't care what hits the fan I'm\ngoing to get it done today because I\nsaid I was going to get it done today\nand what I always tell people is when I\nwhen I look at their goals and I used to\nsay it's all the time I work with my\none-on-one clients\nwhen I look at your goals and you're\nlike yeah this is what I want to do over\nthe week what I say them is I say if you\nget hit by a truck is this going to be\ndone that's what I want to know if you\nget hit by a truck which means doesn't\nmatter what the time is doesn't matter\nhow I feel doesn't matter at all this\nthing is going to be done\nso how do you be more consistent let me\ngive you a really really simple but\nextremely important tip\nstart small I know it's not like the\nbiggest sexiest tip I can give you about\nmindset techniques to try to get\nyourself motivated but you start small\nand how do you start small you pick one\nthing and one thing only that you're\ngonna do for the next 100 days now are\nyou going to do other things the next\n100 days yeah of course you are but what\nyou want to do is you want to find one\nthing that you can do consistently day\nin day out for the next 100 days why do\nI say 100 days because it takes anywhere\nbetween 21 to 100 days to create a new\nhabit and so what I want you to do is\ninstead of trying to focus on a bunch of\nthings I want you to focus on one thing\nand listen your\nyou're here you're listening to this\npodcast so inherently you are probably a\noverachiever or someone who wants to be\nan overachiever don't be that person in\nthis situation don't do more than one\nthing because there's so many times\nwhere people will join and they're like\nyou know what I was so I was so excited\nafter I heard Rob's podcast I decided to\nrevamp my entire life and go I'm gonna\ndo this thing and I'm gonna do this\nthing and I'm gonna do this thing and\nthis thing and this thing and this thing\nthat's why I want to hear people do a\nmorning routine and they have like seven\nthings on the first morning of their\nmorning routine I'm like that's not\ngonna stick it's going to be really hard\nfor that thing to stick they have like\nsix seven things it's like so instead of\nwaking up and actually being excited to\ngo through the morning routine they feel\nlike they have to wake up and go through\na checklist nobody wants to wake up and\ngo we ever we already have to-do list we\nalready have all these other checklists\nwe got to go through and so listen to me\nyou find one thing\nand you tell yourself I'm going to this\none thing no matter what for the next\n100 days in a row next 100 days in a row\nand if I miss a day I start back at day\none so if I get to day 43 of working out\nI said I was going to work out for 100\ndays and I get to day 43. guess what I\ngot to do I start back at day one if I\nmiss day 43 and so listen to me do one\nthing and one thing only because most\npeople want to add five things to their\nschedule and what happens is it's so far\nout of their comfort zone that their ego\ntheir subconscious ends up\nself-sabotaging so if you've ever\nself-sabotaged people are like why do I\nalways self-sabotage probably because\nyou're trying to do too many things that\nare outside of your comfort zone versus\njust one thing outside of your comfort\nzone each day and what happens is your\nold self comes up and starts actually\ntrying to battle the new self that\nyou're trying to build yourself into so\nlisten you're you're probably an\noverachiever or you want to be an\noverachiever that's why you're listening\nto this podcast the non-over Achievers\nare not listening to this podcast if you\ndo too much it will be too much and then\nyou will probably stop following through\nand so what I want you to do is I want\nyou to start small the next thing I want\nyou to do is I want you to track it I\nwant you to literally have a calendar\njust go get it\n15 bucks on Amazon or you can Wonder\nWalgreens or CVS to get one for like 10\nbucks and it's just a monthly calendar\nand all you're going to do is every day\nthat you complete this task you're just\ngoing to put an x on that day so that\nyou know you completed it and when you\nstart seeing a few of them in a row you\nstart getting motivated quote unquote\nmotivated to continue it because you\ndon't want to break that streak now and\nwhat you want to find is what what's\ncalled a keystone habit so a keystone to\ngive you an idea when you look at a\nRoman Arch right you go over to Rome in\nItaly and you look at the Arches that\nthe entire Coliseum is built off of\nthey're all these Roman arches and in\nthe arch there's a keystone the Keystone\nis the one that is at the very center\nand what happens is when it's put into\nplace it locks all of the other stones\ninto place in that Arch and what happens\nis the most important part of that\nentire Arch is the Keystone because it\nlocks all the other ones into place and\nso a keystone habit is one thing that\nyou focus on and by Focus focusing on\nthat one thing it actually changes other\nparts of your life like so your life has\nchanged by doing this one thing\nso let me give you a couple examples of\nKeystone habits you could take any of\nthese and you could actually create your\nown if you wanted to a keystone habit\nthat I found for a lot of people one of\nthem is working out because all you have\nto do is just check off the box of\nworking out and I always say don't focus\non changing anything else in your life\nexcept for working out and what ends up\nhappening slowly but surely you start\nchanging other parts of your life\nnaturally that one thing that Keystone\nhabit working out changes other parts of\nyour life\nso you start working out you know and\nyou don't change any other part of your\nlife you still eat the same you still\ndrink the same all of those things but\neventually what happens is you work out\nyou work out you work out you're putting\nso much effort into working out you go\nyou know what\nI mean I'm working out\nI might as well like I don't know eat a\nlittle bit healthier\nand it starts to change your life in the\nway that you eat you know what I'm\nworking out I might as well drink I need\nto drink some more water there's so many\ndehydrated people in this world right\nwe're like 60 to 70 water and so many\npeople are dehydrated they don't know\nwhy they have energy why their brain\ndoesn't work enough yours not drinking\nenough water why your skin doesn't look\ngood while your digestion isn't good\nyou're just not drinking enough water so\nyou're working out and you're like you\nknow what I'm gonna drink a little bit\nmore water you know what I've been\nworking out so hard\nI'm gonna get a little bit more sleep\nbecause my body needs some rest and I\nknow that muscle growth ends up\nhappening in recovery is usually when\nI'm sleeping so I've been working on I'm\ngoing to get a little bit of sleep you\nknow what\ndamn I drink I eat a lot of sugar\nwhat do you know what I'm gonna do I've\nbeen working out so much I'm gonna eat a\nlittle bit less sugar I saw a doctor the\nother day was talking it was a YouTube\nvideo and he was saying a hundred years\nago the average person ate half a pound\nof sugar per year\nfast forward to today the average person\nthis is a crazy statistic the average\nperson eats a half a pound of sugar per\nday\na hundred years ago people used to eat a\nhalf pound of sugar per year processed\nlike you know white sugar\nnow\nwe had about a half a pound of sugar per\nday\nso maybe I've been working out so much\nof a needle of less sugar so I don't get\nyou know but don't get that that inside\nof my body and it's not necessary and\nwhen you have excess sugar you get\nexcess fat from it okay you know what\nI've been working out so much maybe I'm\ngonna drink a little bit less I'm gonna\ndrink a little bit less alcohol\na little bit less alcohol a little bit\nmore water and so what happens is the\nonly thing that you focus on\nthe only thing that I care about you\nbeing consistent with the only thing\nthat needs to change in your life\nis the working out every single day for\n100 days\nand then what happens all the other\nstones in your life start changing a\nlittle bit you work out and that working\nout turned into eating healthier it\nturned out not drinking more water it\nturned out turned into getting more\nsleep it turned into having less sugar\nit turned into drinking less alcohol\nand that one thing starts to change\nother parts of your life what's another\nKeystone habit waking up early waking up\nearly is a great Keystone habit and I\ndon't what I mean by waking up early I\ndidn't say anything about a morning\nroutine right do I think morning\nroutines are important yes do I have a\nmorning routine yes but I don't care\nabout any of that I know that if your\nfeet hit the floor\nan hour earlier than it normally does\nthat's a win that you can check off that\nbox as long as your feet hit the floor\nand you don't get back in bed why\nbecause if you're up an hour earlier\nyou're going to sit there and you're\ngonna be sitting on your couch you're\ngonna go well I mean I'm I'm awake I\nmight as well do something right\nyeah what should I do well I mean I got\na little bit of energy today maybe we\ncould chug of coffee maybe we could go\nfor a run make it work out work out a\nlittle bit next day you wake up a little\nbit early and you're like what do I want\nto do today I make a journal yeah\njournaling sounds pretty good I'm gonna\ndo some journaling today next day you\nwake up and you got an hour to kill and\nyou're like you know what I should do\nkind of want to read that new book I\njust bought and then you decide to read\na book and you wake up a little bit\nearly the next day and you're like you\nknow what I want to develop my calmness\nso I'm just going to start to meditate\ntoday\nI wake up the next day and you're like\nyou know what I got an hour you got an\nhour to kill I'm gonna go for a walk I'm\ngonna go for a walk with my dog I'm\ngonna go for a walk with my children go\nfor a walk with my spouse\nall you did was focus on one thing which\nwas waking up your feet hitting the\nfloor that is the win if you do it an\nhour early but that feet hitting the\nfloor turned into doing a workout one\nday doing journaling one day doing\nreading one day doing meditating one day\ngoing for a walk another day and I'm not\nsaying focus on any of those other\nthings I'm just saying focus on the one\nthing for 100 days your feet hitting the\nfloor feet Hit the Floor early boom\nthat's a win\nwhat's another one eating healthy is\nanother great one so eating healthy can\nbe a great Keystone habit where you\ndecide you know what I'm just going to\neat healthier whatever that means to you\nyou're going to stick to a specific diet\nwhatever that diet is I don't know you\ncould do Whole30 you could do vegetarian\nvegan you could do carnivore diet you\ncould do fruit Italian diet I don't care\nwhat the diet is you figure out what\neating healthy means to you because\nthat's subjective everyone's eating\nhealthy is different than another\nperson's but you're like next hundred\ndays I'm only going to do this thing\nthis diet this eating quote unquote\neating healthy whatever that means to\nyou because everyone's body is different\nand you're like okay that's the one\nthing I'm going to do and then what\nhappens it starts affecting other areas\nof your life you know what\nI mean I've been eating so healthy\nI don't really feel like having a drink\ntonight\nnext day you're like you know what I've\nbeen eating so healthy\nI'm gonna do a little bit yoga\nnext day you're like I've been eating\nhealthy I'm gonna drink a little bit\nmore water and what happens is these\nKeystone habits these things that are\nplanted into your day that you're\nfocusing on just being consistent on\nthat one thing not searching for\nmotivation not I hope that I can find\ntime to work out today I hope I can find\nsome time to wake up today I hope I can\nfind time to eat healthy today it is my\n head will not hit the bed until\nthis thing has been done\nand that's the commitment that you have\nto have and when you have that\ncommitment to consistency and you do it\nfor 100 days it actually starts to\nbecome who you are and when you become\nthat type of person your life starts to\nchange and think about this if you just\nfocus on one thing for 100 days and once\nthose hundred days is up and you're at a\nhundred days you can say is this built\ninto me yeah it feels pretty built into\nme like if you've ever worked out for\n100 days it feels pretty built into you\nto work out like it feels not it feels\nweird to not work out\nif you've been working out for 100 days\nif you've been eating healthy for 100\ndays it feels weird not\nto do that if you've been waking up\nearly for 100 days it feels weird not to\ndo that and so we're trying to do is\ntrying to build this habit into who you\nare and if you do a hundred days and\nthen you focus on something different\nthe next hundred days you focus on\nsomething different the next hundred\ndays there's 365 days in a year that\nmeans that over the course of a year you\ncould develop three really big Keystone\nhabits into Who You Are\nthink about how different you would be\n365 days from today if you develop three\nreally big big old lever moving\nKeystone habits into yourself over the\nnext 365 days\nand you'd have an extra 65 days to\nfigure out what the next thing is and\nagain almost halfway through the next\nthing so instead of saying I'm going to\nfocus on doing all three of these things\nat one time it's like I'm gonna do this\nthing for 100 days then after those\nhundred days I'm gonna do this thing for\n100 days and after those hundred days\nI'm gonna do this thing for 100 days\nwhat happens is you actually start to\nslowly but surely build these habits\nthese actions into your life that\nactually starts to change you but what\nit comes down to is not wanting to be\nmotivated\nnot hoping for some fleeting emotion to\ncome inside of you and go oh I'm excited\nto do this today it is I said I was\ngoing to do it and I'm going to do it no\nmatter what that is who you want to be\nbecause consistency becoming a\nconsistent person is a character trait\nthat can be built into you I want you to\nbuild a consistent character trade into\nyourself instead of trying to hope that\na fleeting emotion called motivation\njust magically comes into your body each\nday and so focus on being consistent and\nyou will win focus on being consistent\nin your life will change if you focus on\nbeing consistent with these little small\nthings every single day you'll be a\ncompletely different person 365 days\nfrom today so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me at Rob dial\nJunior Rob i a l j r and I'm Gonna Leave\nYou the same way I leave you every\nsingle episode make it your mission make\nsomeone else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
