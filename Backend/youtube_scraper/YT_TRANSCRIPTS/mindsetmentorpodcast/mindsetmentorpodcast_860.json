I was\ntalking with a friend of mine and uh\nhe's done you know quite a bit of growth\nand he was talking about how he's trying\nto get to the next level he's done\ncourses he's hired a coach and he was\nasking himself like he's asking me like\nwhat is the next level how do I get to\nthe next level and what I told him was\nthe idea of actually suffering and uh he\nwas like I don't really know what you\nmean by that and I was like well\nI know I'm really well I've known him\nfor years and years and years and I said\nyou know what I when you look at the\ngrowth that you've had and how you've\nbeen working yourself it is good but it\nhasn't been that hard and most of your\ngrowth has actually been I would say\nmore knowledge base more than it's been\nactual physical or emotional growth and\nuh it's been knowledge based it's been\ncourses it's been reading books it's\nbeen talking to somebody else but there\nhasn't been any like applied suffering I\nlike to call like and what I mean is is\nfinding the edge of your comfort zone\nand pushing past it pushing for the sake\nof nothing else but pushing and he\ndoesn't like restriction he doesn't like\nto be restricted he likes freedom and so\nI told him that staying away from\nrestriction is actually keeping him from\nbeing free and he likes to you know to\nto have no restriction and do what he\nwants and he set up a job to make sure\nthat he's that way and I said listen\nyou think that you don't want\nrestriction and that not having\nrestriction is going to make you free\nbut restricting yourself for the sake of\nactually just restricting yourself is\ngoing to make you more free and he's\nlike I don't understand what that is and\nso we started talking about I'll tell\nyou about what I mean by that but he\nthinks he's free but when you hate to\navoid something you're not free\nand so he's not mentally free from what\nhe feels around restriction and so the\nnext level of for him the next level of\nfreedom is to actually make himself\nbecome okay with restriction become okay\nwith feeling like I don't want to\n do this but doing it anyways\nthat's where you actually find another\nlevel of freedom and so he's been\nworking on on creating that and\nbasically the idea is doing what you\ndon't want to do because on the other\nside of that is growth because when you\ndon't want to do something and it feels\nrestrictive and you go past that you\nfind another level of your freedom\noutside of your comfort zone and so\nwhen you you know there's a intersection\nof like the gut and the Brain the gut\nfeels like you should do it but the\nbrain doesn't want to do it so your\ngut's like man I should definitely like\nI'll use cold plunging as an example\nbecause people hate cold plunges I hate\ncold punches but I also love the way\nthat I feel after cold plunges like I've\ndone hundreds and hundreds of sessions\nof cold showers and cold plunges I have\na cold Plunge in my garage I've done\nhundreds of sessions and even thinking\nabout doing it makes me be like\nthat like I just don't like it but I do\nlike coming in contact with a little\ninner that says don't do it don't\ndo it don't do it in doing it anyways\nand so the gut feels like man you should\ndefinitely do this it'll make you feel\nbetter it'll wake you up it'll help\nreduce your inflammation it will\nit'll be able to push you past your\ncomfort and you can find another version\nof yourself after but the brain's like\ndon't do it don't do it don't do it why\nbecause the brain is a safety mechanism\nand your growth is on the other side\nyour next level of growth most likely is\non the other side of what you don't want\nto do\nI'll use cold showers as an example\nagain if you just do it for 30 to 60\ndays straight you'll find a version of\nyou and we could use close jobs as an\nexample but I'll use other examples as\nwell it could be like working out it\ncould be a new diet it could be\nmeditating because you're too anxious it\ncould be you don't think you know you're\nthinking too much you're emotional and\nyou you journal every single day so like\njournaling can be a part of it\nmeditation could be a part of it a diet\ncould be a part of it cold showers could\nbe a part of it working out could be a\npart of it Whatever It Is pick one thing\nand say I'm gonna do this thing for the\nnext 30 days or I'm gonna do this thing\nfor the next 60 days\nso let's just say\nlet's use cold showers an example and\nuse another example as well cold showers\nis an example and you say I'm going to\ndo this thing no matter what for the\nnext 30 days and you just freaking do it\nand you do you just as long as you do\nthat thing you have accomplished what\nyou needed to for the day if cold\nshowers are your thing and do it for 30\ndays you're going to notice at the end\nof those 30 days a different version of\nyou mentally\nphysically you'll be different obvious\nthings will be different but mentally is\nwhat I really care about and it'll be a\nversion of you that when you feel\nresistance\nit's easier to execute\nbecause you're going to feel resistance\na lot of times in your life with\nrelationships with starting your\nbusiness with many different things and\nwhen you can feel this resistance and do\nit anyways and make that a mental muscle\nthere's a new version of you on the\nother side of that let's use another\nexample that's cold showers let's say\nworking out you know for me\nI worked out this morning and if I'm\nbeing honest with you I'd say this\nbasically every time I talk about\nworking out I didn't want to work out\nthis morning it's just I was just not\nexcited about it but I was like I have\nto do it right and so there's a version\nof you that's the same resistance that\nyou're met with before cold showers I'm\nlike nah man you've had a long morning\nyou had a team call you had this going\non you're so busy today just push your\nworkout for tomorrow so I met that\nresistance and I was like I'm gonna do\nit anyways I'm gonna do it anyways I'm\ngonna do it anyway so what if you just\nwork out for the next 30 days in a row\nwhat would your life look like if you\njust worked out for 30 days like as long\nas you check off that box of working out\nfor 30 days it's going to be a different\nversion of you your body's gonna be\ndifferent that's of course but what\nwe're really working with is the\nmentality of I didn't want to do it I\ndid it anyways\nI didn't want to do what I did anyways\nand what you start doing is actually\ndeveloping better habits and so in\nanother example is you know\nmaybe you are too anxious sometimes or\nyou think too much or you're too\nemotional and you don't understand your\nemotions and you're like you know what\nI'm just going to journal how I feel and\nwhy I feel this way every single day and\nthere's gonna be days when you're gonna\nwake up and you're not going to want to\njournal and you're gonna be like nah not\ntoday but you're like you know what\nthat's my ego speaking I'm going to\njournal anyways and then you have\nanother level of a breakthrough of\nstarting to understand yourself a little\nbit better and understand your emotion a\nlittle bit better and you're not\nthinking you're not as anxious as you\nused to be right and so you meet\nresistance when you start doing\nsomething consistently day in day out\nday in day out you're going to meet\nresistance at some point in time\nand the idea is how do I meet that\nresistance and go past the resistance\nbecause when you feel discomfort you\nneed to feel discomfort because there is\nno\nthere's no benefit unless there's a\nlittle bit of a risk there's no benefit\nunless there's a little bit of pushing\npast what you're comfortable doing and I\nalways say this if you feel\nuncomfortable\nwith doing a cold shower with working\nout with journaling you are meeting the\nphysical manifestation of your comfort\nzone so to back off when you feel that\nresistance is to stay in your comfort\nzone but to feel the resistance and go\noh this is my comfort zone I'm going to\nlean a little bit past it\nis you stepping outside of your comfort\nzone every single day and for you to be\na more expansive different version of\nyourself in 30 days 60 days 90 days a\nyear from today you need to have a\nlittle bit of Applied suffering to find\nthe edge of your comfort zone and push a\nlittle bit past it every single day\nright and so you have to do something\nthat's past your comfort zone how\ndifferent would you feel if for the next\n30 to 60 days you just made yourself\nwork out every single day\nor you made yourself do the cold showers\nor you made yourself journal every\nsingle day how different do you think\nyou'd be in 30 days like what is what is\nthe other side of you look like 30 days\nfrom today or 60 days from today when\nyou just do that because the thing about\ngrowth to have a significant amount of\ngrowth like over the next five years\nyou're gonna have a significant amount\nof growth if you do this of course but\nit doesn't take a long time to have a\nquite significant amount of growth you\nknow it's never too late to change the\noldest person who's ever gone through\none of my courses I love it she was 93\nyears old and I'm like hell yes I want\nto be you when I'm 93. when I'm 93 years\nold I'm like I'm still not satisfied I\nstill want to grow I still want to\nbecome better right and so it's never\ntoo late to change it's never too late\nto turn it around it takes pushing\nyourself out of your comfort zone every\nsingle year every single day and that's\nhow a new version of you is made and\ndoing it consistently over and over and\nover again\nI always say that your comfort zone is\nvery similar to a rubber band and so if\nyou think of a rubber band if you know\nyou're holding onto a rubber band the\nfurther that you get from normal you're\npulling in and pulling it and pulling\nand pulling it the harder it's going to\ntry to pull you back to normal but if\nyou pull a rubber band long enough and\nfar enough what happens\nsnaps and that is what we're trying to\ndo with our comfort zone of yours to\nsnap out of your comfort zone and design\na new version of you so I want you to\nfind one thing that is outside of your\ncomfort zone and I want you to do it\nevery single day for the next 30 days\nand that's how I want you to start off\nyour New Year\none thing and one thing only for those\n30 days and see what version of you is\non the other side of that so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if\nyou're out there\nand you want to join a journey with\nmyself in hundreds of other people to\nactually push ourselves out of
