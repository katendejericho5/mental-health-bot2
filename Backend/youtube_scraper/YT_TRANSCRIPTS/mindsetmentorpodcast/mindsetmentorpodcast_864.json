    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so you never miss\nanother podcast episode and if you're\nout there and you love this podcast and\nyou want some extra mindset tips go\nahead and go to Monday email.com right\nnow that is where I send out an email\nevery single Monday morning with mindset\ntips and tricks so that you can improve\nevery single week and I'll send that out\nto you every single Monday so once again\nMonday email.com and absolutely free and\nyou can sign up right there and I will\nsend you emails directly to your email\ninbox every single Monday today I'm\ngoing to be teaching you a four-step\nproven process to help you learn\nanything that you want to learn faster\nthis could be used in many different\nways too this could be used if you want\nto learn something that is completely\nnew\nyou're like you know what this is a new\nthing this is something that interests\nme I want to learn about you know\nneurons inside of the brain you can use\nit for that it could be used to deepen\nyour knowledge in something that you\nalready know\nor it can be used to help you study for\nan exam or maybe you work for a company\nand you're about to give a big\npresentation on oil and gas and you're\nnot really sure about oil and gas and\nyou're trying to learn more about it so\nthat you can kind of speak the language\nof the people that you're about to go\ngive a presentation for and so what I'm\ngoing to teach you is an actual strategy\nthat was developed by a man named\nRichard Feynman\nRichard Feynman was basically a genius\nhe was won the Nobel Prize in quantum\nelectrodynamics\nQuantum electrodynamics and he is famous\nfor being able to take really extremely\ncomplex topics and make it easy for most\nanyone to understand so if you gotta\nthink about it like this guy was\nteaching and he was teaching and won a\nNobel Prize in Quantum electrodynamics\nand he was able to take Quantum\nelectrodynamics and make it easier for\nmost anybody to understand and so this\nis his process that he used to be able\nto learn something and be able to put it\ninto his own brain but also be able to\nteach it to other people to make it very\nvery simple and not only is he famous\nfor being able to you know draw how the\nmath works with submit particles but\nhe's also famous for being able to teach\nthis for people to understand so he was\nable to actually draw out and show the\nmath to someone who's not good at math\nwho doesn't understand quantum mechanics\nand he was able to show and draw out the\nmath of subatomic particles with pen and\npaper and so this is his strategy to be\nable to take anything that you want to\nlearn and make it locked into your brain\nand so we're going to go through the\nfour-step process so step number one is\nto pick a topic and study it get as much\nknowledge as you can into that brain of\nyours and as you're learning\nanything one of the best things to do is\nto write stuff down with pen and paper I\nalways get asked all the time is it okay\nfor me to you know when I talk about\njournaling is it okay for me to use my\ncomputer when I'm journaling sure it's\nokay is it better than pen and paper\nabsolutely not why because pen and paper\ntakes longer and when something takes\nlonger it means that it takes longer and\nyour brain is actually taking more time\nto process it so you know it's the\nreason why pen and paper is so much\nbetter is because it takes longer but\nit's slower and more intentional\nwhenever you're writing something down\nwhich means it is more likely to get\nlocked into your brain so when you're\nactually trying to learn something it's\nbetter to write it down with pen and\npaper and one of the strategies that\nFeynman didn't know about but now\nthrough neuroplasticity has been proven\nto be one of the best strategies for\nlearning\nis actually the Pomodoro Technique which\nis 25 minutes on of learning or of of\nfocusing whatever it is that you're\ndoing in five minutes off 25 minutes on\nmeans that you're focusing on one thing\nand one thing only for those 25 minutes\nso if you're trying to learn you know\noil and gas like we were just talking\nabout the only thing that you can do is\nlearn about oil and gas for those 25\nminutes you can't go send a text message\nyou can't send an email you can't have\nany distractions you're going to you\nknow actually only focus on just that\nthing and the 25 minutes off are 25\nminutes on is just as important as a\nfive minutes off this is where a lot of\npeople who don't understand\nneuroplasticity actually mess up the\nPomodoro Technique when you understand\nneuroplasticity the off is actually the\nyou know I want to say the most\nimportant part but it is equally as\nimportant as the learning itself why\nbecause most people think okay I'll do\n25 minutes of learning\nand then I'll go send some text messages\nand scroll on Instagram and screw around\nfor five minutes but the the important\nthing to realize is the five minutes off\nwhenever you're learning something after\n25 minutes of a learning bout that five\nminutes off is where your brain takes\ntime to actually store into your brain\nand into your your conscious mind what\nit is that you just learned so if you go\nfrom 25 minutes of learning about oil\nand gas for this presentation that you\nhave to learn and then you take five\nminutes off in that five minutes quote\nunquote off is sending emails it doesn't\nallow your brain to take that 25 minutes\nof learning and store it as efficiently\nwhen you fall asleep\nthis is what your brain does your brain\nwill replay your day up to 60 times\nfaster than your day actually happens so\nit can do it over and over and over and\nover again it can store it well when you\ntake a break of five minutes after 25\nminutes of learning your brain will do\n20 to 30 times faster so it doesn't work\nas fast as it does if you if you were\nasleep but this is where the\nneuroplasticity the changing of your\nbrain actually occurs so when you're\nlearning those 25 minutes is where the\nactual initiation of the neuroplasticity\nstarts to happen neuroplasticity means\nthe changing of your brain is during\nthose 25 minutes but it doesn't actually\noccur that's where it marks the neurons\nthat need to be changed but it doesn't\nactually occur which means the change\ndoesn't actually happen until the break\nfive minute break or when you go to\nsleep and so one of the most important\nthings you could do is 25 minutes of\nlearning\nand then go outside or go for a walk for\nfive minutes by yourself or close your\neyes and do some deep breaths and\nrealize that your brain is actually\nstarting to store away that information\nso if you want to learn something use\nwhat technology now knows what science\nnow knows which is the 25 minutes on\nfive minutes off and realize that the\nfive minutes off is actually off of\neverything don't do anything that's\ntaxing on your brain don't scroll on\nInstagram don't send emails don't send\ntext messages don't make a phone call\nuse that time to fully just break away\nfrom everything so that's the first\nthing that you want to do pick a topic\nand cram as much off that that topic\ninto your brain okay number two is to\nwrite down and explain it to somebody\nout loud so what you just learned\nlet's say you take 25 minutes on five\nminutes off 25 minutes on five minutes\noff 25 minutes on five minutes off\nthat's an hour and a half of learning\ntotal you know you did three bouts of 30\nminutes it's an hour and a half of\nlearning now how do you get that to be\nmore locked into your brain write it\ndown draw it out explain it for somebody\nout loud and if there's nobody around\nyou you can literally pretend that there\nis just explain it to yourself out loud\ntake some time to do that why the best\nway to learn something is to then go and\nteach it because when you teach it\nyou're creating new neural Pathways in\nyour brain learning something a lot of\ntimes like if I'm watching if I'm\nreading something and I'm reading about\nsomething and then you know for 25\nminutes I'm reading about this thing and\nthen I go you know what I took my five\nminute break my next 25 minute bout I'm\ngonna go on to YouTube and I'm going to\nGoogle XYZ around oil and gas so I can\nunderstand this industry more and for 25\nminutes I'm watching a video that's\ninstructional for me right\nboth of those are mostly passive\nlearning\npassive learning is one of the worst\nways to learn passive means I'm just\nsitting back and the information is\ngoing into my brain\nthe best way to learn which is 10 times\nmore efficient is to actively learn\nsomething when you actively learn\nsomething is when you actually so one of\nthe worst ways to actually learn is to\nsit inside of a college classroom and go\nthrough and have a professor just\nprofess and talk to you right because\nyou're passively learning one of the\nbest ways to learn is to have a teacher\nif the teacher wants to teach to you\nguys then give you some time to actively\nteach it back and forth to each other\nthat's Active Learning that's taking\nwhat you just passively learned and\nmaking it active in your brain you\ncreate more neural Pathways doing it\nthis way and you're activating new\nPathways inside of your brain now at\nthis point in time when you're sitting\ndown to actually teach something to\nsomeone else it could cause some\nfrustration you might notice that you're\nteaching something and then it there's\nlike a block you're like what was\nthat\nwhat was that thing I don't remember\nwhat this thing was and it can cause\nthis right here just so you know is a\ngood thing it can cause some agitation\nit can cause some frustration what's\nactually happening is there is a\nchemical that's released inside of your\nbrain called acetylcholine acetylcholine\nis actually what is released at the\nspecific neurons to make change for\nneuroplasticity acetylcholine is what\ncauses the neuroplasticity usually when\nacetylcholine is released from the brain\nthe first thing that you feel is\nagitation and frustration so feeling the\nway that you're feeling the stress and\nthe agitation like oh I don't really\nknow if this is clicking I'm not really\ngetting it into my brain is actually a\ngood thing because it's the feeling of\nthe brain actually about to change\nitself for me this is something I've\nlearned it's something I do all of the\ntime with my fiance so like I'll learn\nsomething there was the other day I was\nlearning something that was really\nreally in-depth about\nsome quantum mechanics and some stuff of\nthe way that the the waves and why waves\nactually pop up in a human body and\nquantum mechanics and stuff it was super\ncomplex and I was like this is so\ncomplex I don't want it to leave my\nbrain but it's so interesting I'm gonna\ngo teach it to her and so I sat her down\nI was like and I drew it out and I was\nlike this is what it looks like this is\nthe waves this is a positive this is a\nnegative this is why it looks like this\nnow I feel like it's locked inside of my\nbrain I could have lost it if I didn't\nwrite it down and so what you want to do\nis you want to learn this and then you\nwant to go and reteach it this is also\nwhy I love this podcast is because I'll\nlearn a bunch of things and then I'll\ncome here and I'll teach it to you guys\nwhich helps it lock it into my brain and\nso whatever you're doing\nwhatever you're learning\nif there's somebody around you that you\ncan teach it to teach it to them and if\nthey have any questions see if you can\nanswer their questions it'll help it\nlock it into your brain more if there's\nnobody around you write it down what you\njust learned and pretend like somebody's\nthere and you're teaching it to them one\nof the best ways to learn something is\nto then go and teach it so that is\nnumber two next number three whenever\nyou get stuck go back and study that\npart specifically because it is showing\nyou a gap in your knowledge it's showing\nyou where your knowledge is not clear\nand where you don't understand and so\nwhat's cool about it is that you know if\nyou just go and you learn something\nyou're learning it and you're getting\nsome stuff into your head\nbut when you learn it and then you go\nback and teach it you can actually start\nto see oh I don't fully understand this\nbecause I don't feel like I can teach it\nif you can't teach it you don't\nunderstand it\nand so going back and and figuring out\nwhat are the what are the actual parts\nthat I don't understand and then going\nback and relearning that is super\nimportant so let's say once again you're\nwatching a YouTube video after you get\ndone watching a 25 minute YouTube video\nyou take a five minute break and then\nyou go and you try to teach it to\nsomebody as you're teaching it you\nnotice\nI'm not really sure what's going on I\ndon't feel like I've 100 got this locked\ninto my brain I'm not really sure maybe\nthat's the question you don't know the\nanswer that question like you feel like\nyou kind of know it but you're not 100\nsure go back and fast forward through\nthe video until you get back to that\npart relearn it and then write it down\nand try to re-teach that person so that\nyou are locking in\nwhat you have in your brain you're\nlearning and you're figuring out what\nyou don't know and what you need to know\nthen you're going back and learning that\nthing and then you're reteaching that\nthing to make sure to get it locked into\nyour brain in size number three is\nwhenever you get stuck trying to teach\nthis go back and study that part so you\ncan make sure that you get it and then\nlast when you're done go back and repeat\nthis entire process here's the key\ndo it in as simple language as possible\nas simple language as possible the thing\nthat I always like to say and I always\nhear people say to say oh I love\nlistening to your podcast because you\ncan take really complex topics and make\nit very easy to understand I tried it\nwhen I first started my podcast I said\nto myself I want to make it so easy that\na 10 year old can understand everything\nthat I'm teaching and so that's the\nViewpoint that I try to teach the\npodcast through\nand the reason why is because when I was\nyounger I remember reading a quote from\nEinstein and the quote for Einstein said\nif you can't explain it simply you don't\nunderstand it well enough and so if you\nfind yourself trying to teach something\nto somebody\nbut you're teaching it very complex and\nyou can't seem to pull it back you don't\nunderstand it as well as you could when\nyou really truly understand something\nlike Quantum electrodynamics which is\nextremely complex which with Richard\nFeynman he would challenge himself to go\ncan I get more simple can I get more\nsimple can I get more simple because the\nmore that you can unders the more that\nyou can teach something very very simply\nthe more that you understand it and it's\nit's very very important and why is it\nimportant because if you're going to\nteach a 10 year old\nwhatever it is that you're trying to\nteach them\nwhat is so great about children they\nalmost always ask one question why why\ndoes this work why does this happen why\nis it like this why why why why why why\nwhy why why if you taught it to a 10\nyear old whatever it is that you're\ntrying to learn let's just continue on\nthis oil and gas topic if you're\nlearning about oil and gas could you\ntake if you have children can you take\nyour children and say honey I want to\nteach you about oil and gas and they're\nlike okay cool and then just have them\ndrill you with a bunch of why questions\nthey will be the best audience for you\nwhy because if children don't understand\nsomething they ask questions if adults\nunderstand something they don't ask\nquestions why because they don't want to\nlook dumb and so the best people to go\nback and teach if you can are children\nand the more simply that you can teach\nsomething\nthe more you understand it so if you're\ngoing okay I need to learn oil and gas\nso I can teach I can make this\npresentation for my client who's in the\noil and gas field I'm going to learn\nabout oil gas I'm going to learn about\nthis and learn about the rigs whatever\nit is that you need to learn about\nyou go through you teach it to your 10\nyear old your eight-year-old your\nnine-year-old and then say what\nquestions you have oh why this why this\nwhy this why this they might get you\nhung up if they get you hung up what do\nyou do you go back and learn that exact\nsame spot that whatever it is that\nthey're asking oh why why is it that you\ndo you know fracking oh we do fracking\nbecause of I don't really remember how\ndoes it work I don't really remember how\nit works okay let me go back and learn\nthis now when you get done with this\nentire process does it take time yes and\nmost people aren't patients so it's\nharder to do you have to go back and\nlearn this and follow this exact same\nprocess it's been proven that once you\ncan explain something in very very\nsimple language you understand it and\nyou're 10 times more likely to remember\nit and so you repeat this until you feel\nlike you have a concept down\nyou understand it you can teach it to a\nchild the child can ask you why\nquestions and you can answer it and now\nnow you go out and you make that\npresentation for your oil and gas\nclients and you can speak their language\nat a much higher level so this is the\nfour-step process of being able to take\nsomething and lock it into your brain\nnumber one you pick a topic you study\nthe hell out of it you do the 25 minutes\non five minutes off number two you write\nit down and you explain it to somebody\nout loud or explain it just out loud if\nthere's nobody around number three when\nyou get stuck you go back and you study\nthat part and number four when you're\ndone you go back and repeat the entire\nprocess to see if there is anything that\nyou're missing and anything that you\ndon't understand so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in at Rob\ndial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r and I'm Gonna Leave\nthe same way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission make\nsomeone else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
