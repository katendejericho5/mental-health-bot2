    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to have\nmore peace and happiness in your life\nstarting right now today let's dive in I\nwas the type of person who thought in\norder to be happy I need to go achieve\nthis in order to be I will not be happy\nuntil I make this much money or once I\nget to this checkpoint in life then I\ncan finally feel good but until I'm\nthere I'm stressed I'm pissed I'm I'm\njust going to be white knuckling my way\nto the next checkpoint and so today I'm\ngoing to talk to you uh about some stuff\nthat I've been doing recently and talk\nreally about how to finally be at peace\nand to find more happiness in your life\nexactly as it is right now one of the\nthings I've really been focusing on for\nthe past I'd say 10 months or\nso maybe yeah about 10 months is I've\nreally been focusing on prioritizing my\nhappiness prioritizing my peace and\nhappiness and um it's not easy which is\nwhat's really interesting about it it's\nnot really easy especially because um we\nlive in a society of more we live in a\nsociety where you always have to be\nachieving you always have to be working\nyou always have to be going to the next\nthing if you're not achieving then\nyou're lazy uh too much is Never Enough\nand for me personally I developed um\nearly on at about 20 years old I\ndeveloped this this habit this addiction\nto working I became you know I was never\naddicted to drugs or alcohol or any of\nthat type of stuff food those are never\nmy addictions my addiction was working\nbecause I was like I need to get to this\ncheckpoint I need to get to this place\nof quote unquote success so I can\nfinally feel good and um work being a\nworkaholic is is basically the only\naddiction that is rewarded and praised\nin our society because they're like oh\nman you're doing so well you're making\nso much money you're having so much\nsuccess and you're like yeah I'm doing\nthe right thing I need to keep going and\nso we're really raised from from\nchildhood to always be going for the\nnext thing and to never slow down and to\nnever be satisfied with where you are if\nyou think about it from childhood we go\ninto school and we have to perform in\nschool to get to the next grade to get\nto the next grade and it's like hey you\nbetter you better do really good in\nfirst grade and start memorizing that\nyou know how to cat so that you can get\nto the second grade you better do good\nin second grade so you can get to third\ngrade and fourth grade and then in\nmiddle school and then high school and\nin high school you better do really well\nso that you can get to college and then\nwhen you get to College you better do\nreally well so that you can get a good\njob and then when you get a good job you\nbetter do really well so you can get a\npromotion and it never stops and\nso we're literally programmed I don't\nthink that it's you know any any like\nPuppeteer out there trying to program us\nand tell us what to do do but we're kind\nof programmed from childhood from school\nto go to the next thing to always be\nworking for the next thing and then what\nhappens is people wake up at 40 50 35\nyears old sometimes 55 years old and\nthey're like what the hell is my life\nlike everything that I have I've\nachieved I've done this I've done\nexactly what I was supposed to do and I\nfeel zero fulfillment with where my life\nis and so we've kind of been\nunconsciously programmed I don't know if\nwe've been conscious programmed to to be\nthis way I know that I definitely felt\nthis way and and you know there's a good\namount of you listening that have felt\nthis way as well and um I want you to\nreally think about this like how could\nyou possibly be at a deep feeling of\npeace and happiness if you always want\nmore because that that desire for\nsomething is telling you something is\nmissing in my life and if something is\nmissing in my life well then I can't\nhave peace and happiness because I've\ngot to get that thing and then I can\nfeel peace and happiness and it's what\nthe the Buddhists call the Hungry ghosts\nyou know if you imagine a ghost you know\ncoming in your room and eating food it\ndoesn't have a stomach so as soon as it\neats it's just going to fall on the\nfloor and so it will never fill its\nbelly it's always going to be hungry and\nit's it's kind of like there's a Bob\nMarley quote that says something along\nthe lines if is if it takes money for\nyou to be happy you'll never be happy\ncuz money is just numbers and numbers\nnever stop and so you've really got to\nstart to take a step back and hopefully\nyou guys can start to De program\nyourself faster than I was able to and\nnot saying this isn't still a struggle\nfor me this day because it's probably\nstill will be forever but you know is\nthere a way that in this moment without\nhaving to achieve anything else without\nhaving to do anything else without us us\nhaving to to change our position into a\nmeditative position with our legs\ncrossed but just like in this moment\nlistening to my\nvoice for you to just take a deep breath\nand just think to yourself I want to be\nhappy right now like there's nothing\nthat needs to happen for you to be happy\nhappiness is a state of mind it's not a\ndestination that you get to we live in a\nsociety where you have to you know we're\nwe're supposed to have the newest thing\nthere's always another phone there's\nalways another car there's always\nanother computer there's always another\npromotion there's always more money if\nyou have a million where why don't you\nhave two and then you you have to go for\nthe next thing it's the the newest car\nthe newest phone the biggest house the\nthe more clothes more purses more toys\nfor your children oh your neighbor got a\nboat oh well then you need to get a boat\ntoo you need a bigger one you have to\nkeep up with the Joneses you got to show\nthem who the real cool person is who's\nbetter who's richer who's more affluent\nright like we kind of live in this\nSociety where that's a thing and I don't\nknow about you but now that I'm\napproaching 40 I'm like I don't want to\nplay that game anymore I hope I live to\n100 I don't want to spend the next 60\nyears of my life going after stuff that\nmakes me feel no different about myself\nor about the world I'd rather just focus\non me being happy right now in this\nmoment\njust peace and happiness in this moment\nwithout needing anything else you know\nand there was actually a study that was\ndone um I'm going to bring in a few\nstudies to show that what I'm talking\nabout is actually true um and the study\nwas actually called materialism and\nwell-being a meta analysis and the study\nactually found a strong negative\ncorrelation between materialism and\nwell-being and they found that\nindividuals who prioritize materialistic\nvalues tend to report lower levels of\nhappiness and higher levels of anxiety\nand\ndepression so it shows you that if\nyou're saying oh I just I just want to\nget the next car I want to get the next\nthing and there's materialism I have I\nhave no problem with materialism I have\nno problem with you going and buying\nawesome stuff and and having fun with it\nthe only thing I have a problem with is\nyou thinking that that's going to make\nyou happier give you more peace or fill\na void within your soul that makes you\nfeel like you're not worthy and so\nthere's the the study showed that there\nwas a negative correlation between\nmaterialism and well-being and people\nwho who prioritize materialistic have\nlower levels of happiness and higher\nlevels of anxiety and depression so if I\ncan remove myself from that thinking\nbased off of what that study says I\nshould have less anxiety less depression\nand better\nwellbeing have you ever like I tend to\ndo this a lot and I'm a very uh I I\nquestion myself a lot and I I like to\nquestion everything I ask why a lot I\nwas probably annoying little kid but\nhave you ever stopped and like actually\nthink why like why why is it that I\nalways want more why is it that Society\nalways wants more why is it that people\nalways feel like they have to have the\nnext thing they have to to to to go buy\nanother car or another house or make an\nextra extra million dollars or go buy\nwhatever it might be why is it that we\nlive in this this Society of\nmore have you ever sat and ask yourself\nwhy like why can't you just be happy\nwith what you have and I remember I was\nreading a book years ago and it was\nabout um it was about saving money and\nit was about you know less materialistic\nstuff and the the first chapter was\nreally really interesting and one of the\nthings they said is imagine everything\nthat you've ever bought accumulated into\na pip\njust in front of you say you get to a\nfootball field soccer field they just\nput everything you've ever bought every\ncar every piece of clothing um all of\nthe rappers that it came in your phone\nyou know every single thing and you put\nit all into one big pile imagine how big\nthat pile would be and imagine how many\nthings you've had that have just gotten\nolder and they just stopped working or\nyou decided to get something you decided\nto get the new phone you decided to\nupgrade in some sort of way imagine how\nbig that pile of things things would be\nand now look at that pile and realize\nthat it's never made you happy nothing\nin there has ever made you happy for\nthings that you've bought now imagine\nthat pile and then imagine that pile\nmultiplied by 8 billion people on Earth\nand that's how much stuff we have\naccumulated and created and bought and\nthrown away and stuff that's gone from\none place to another and you sold it to\nsomebody on Facebook Marketplace\nwhatever it might be and so it really\ncomes down to you know how can we how\ncan we not need more we can always get\nmore if we want but how can we just\nfigure out a way to be grateful for what\nit is that we have in this moment\nthere's a study that was called Counting\nblessings versus burdens a experimental\ninvestigation of gratitude and\nsubjective well-being in life and the\nstudy found that people who kept a\ngratitude Journal en listed things that\nthey were grateful for each day reported\nconsistently higher levels of well-being\nbetter sleep and lower levels of\ndepression compared to those who are\nfocused on daily hassles in materialism\nso once again all they was saying was\nthat people are focused on gratitude\nthey had a gratitude journal and and\nit's funny because eight years ago\ngratitude Journal is like a new thing\nnow it's like everybody talks about\ngratitude journals and it seems like a\nlittle bit corny and cliche but the\nstudy found that people who have\ngratitude journals had uh and they\nlisted things that they were grateful\nfor and things they were thankful for\nreported higher levels of\nwell-being better sleep and and lower\nlevels of of depression than everyone\nelse and so one of the things I've been\ndoing is I've been trying to think of\nevery single morning when I sit you know\nsometimes I'm into meditation when I'm\ndoing it sometimes I'm out in my porch\nand I'm just drinking coffee is I try to\njust make myself feel thankful and just\nthink of the things I'm I'm not trying\nto force it I'm just thinking about my\nlife and my family and everyone around\nme and the things that I've the\nchallenges I've been through and um it's\nreally interesting because I don't know\nif you've ever gotten to the point\nbefore where you just get so grateful\nfor for something for someone for life\nthat you just start tearing up and it's\njust you just having that feeling of\nlike damn I am so grateful for my life\nthat's what we all should try to do\nevery single morning imagine if we went\nin with that feeling and Carri through\nthe rest of our day right like I I want\nyou to understand that that I don't want\nyou to think that having things or\nwanting nice things is bad you know like\nI don't want you to think that I'm\ncompletely anti all of that stuff cuz\nI'm not right I've got cool stuff it's\nall fun but I know none of that stuff is\ngoing to fill a void within me so I\ndon't want you to think that I'm anti-\nnice things but what I'm really saying\nto you is like hey can you just decide\nthat you're going to be grateful and\nhappy and more peaceful no matter what\nno matter there's nothing else that you\nneed in order to get you there right\nso you don't have to impress anybody\nbecause most people aren't paying\nattention to you anyways most people are\nso busy paying attention to themselves\nthey don't even notice you and that's\ncomplet completely okay you know it's\nlike I always say people no judgment in\nany sort of way but people who have\nFerraris in Lamborghinis 99% of them who\nhave Ferraris or Lamborghinis have them\nfor other people not for themselves\nright those things won't bring you\nhappiness we all think that we're we're\nsearching for happiness and fulfillment\nand we are but what we're really looking\nfor is how can I just feel good in this\nmoment like if you look at happiness if\nyou look at Freedom if you look at\nfulfillment all of that gratitude it's\nreally this feeling of I feel good right\nnow right if I if I buy that thing then\nI will feel good no no no I'm going to\nfeel good and then I'm just going to I'm\njust going to carry the feeling the\nState of Mind of feeling good and\nfeeling happy and feeling peaceful while\nI go get that thing that I that I want\nto get and people always ask a question\nlike I get this question I was actually\nat an event I was speaking to a group of\num CEOs and and business owners about 3\nweeks ago and the average net worth in\nthe room was probably about $30 million\nthere was a few guys that were in the\nroom that just sold their their\ncompanies for multiple hundreds of\nmillions of dollars and I was I was\ntalking about kind of the same thing I'm\ntalking about right here and one guy\nraises his hand and he goes hey but if\nand I hear this question a lot he goes\nhey but if I am grateful and happy with\nwhat I have won't I lose all of my\nmotivation like will I still be\nmotivated if I don't desire things yeah\nbecause you your motivation could come\nfrom lack of selfworth in buying things\nand achieving things to fill the void or\nyour motivation could come from doing\nsomething great like trying find trying\nto find like real true motivation it's\nthe difference between intrinsic\nmotivation versus extrinsic motivation\nand I did a a podcast episode on this uh\na few weeks ago which is the difference\nbetween intrinsic versus extrinsic\nmotivation but really can we stop\nworrying about being extrinsically\nmotivated about the things that we're\ngoing to buy and things we're going to\ndo and the achievements and the badges\nand the degrees and all those things and\nstart saying like what is it that would\nmake me feel good what would it what\nwould give me lasting fulfillment or was\na study that was done that was called\nintrinsic and extrinsic motivations and\nthe study highlighted the differences\nbetween intrinsic and extrinsic\nmotivation intrinsic basically what it\nis is driven by internal rewards and\npersonal growth and when people are\nintrinsically motivated they found that\nthey have greater psychological\nwell-being and\npersistence and activities compared to\nextrinsic motivation which is driven by\nthe external rewards so there was\nactually that that study proved that the\npeople who were intrinsically motivated\nthey they found their reason why not\nlike buying stuff but the reason why\nimpacting thems improving themsel\nimproving the world doing it for their\nfamily they had greater well-being and\nmore persistence than the people who\nwere just like trying to buy things or\nbeing extrinsically motivated and so it\nreally comes down to like okay I'm\ngetting this there's studies that show\nit can I just get myself into a place of\ngratitude every morning and set that set\nmyself up for that set myself up for\nhappiness and and like I said happiness\nis a state of mind it's not a\ndestination that you get to you know if\nyou get in your car and you want to\ndrive somewhere like if I want to drive\nto Dallas that's my location of where\nI'm trying to get to right that is my my\ndestination getting in my car quote\nunquote getting in my car every single\nmorning for how I want my day to feel\nand saying I want to feel happy is not\nmy destination that's not where I'm\ntrying to go it's it's kind of like\nwhat's what's the music that I'm\nlistening to on that Journey what's what\nis it that how am I going to feel as I'm\ndriving that car to Dallas you know it's\nlike it's not the destination it's how\nI'm it's the state of mind I'm going to\nbe in the entire time and how do you get\nyourself into a better State of\nMind realize find some gratitude you\nknow there's think about this like some\npeople are like oh my life is so\nterrible there's always someone who has\na worst life than you and you know\n150,000 people died yesterday and you\ncan't find one thing to be grateful for\nevery single one of those people all\n150,000 people if they had the\nopportunity to switch places with you\nall of them would which shows you that\nyour life is not that bad your heart is\nbeating you are breathing you probably\nhave a few people that love you have\nfood Water Shelter clothing most likely\nif you're listening to this podcast you\ncan probably afford to at least stay\nalive that's something to be grateful\nfor right so you can find stuff to be\ngrateful for if you're searching for it\nthe problem is that most of us are\nsearching for what we don't have what\nyou want to do is you want to search for\nwhat you have and be grateful for the\nthings that you have and if you go from\nthere you'll actually have greater\nlevels of persistence when you have that\nintrinsic motivation being grateful for\nwhat you have and working towards\nsomething greater so that is the key to\nbeing happier and more peaceful so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode
