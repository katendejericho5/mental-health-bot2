    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode and if\nyou're out there and you love this\npodcast please do me a favor give us a\nrating and review however you listen to\nus when you do that it allows more\npeople to be able to find this podcast\nbecause those platforms end up showing\nthis podcast to people who have never\nlistened to it before so if you would do\nthat I would greatly greatly appreciate\nit today we're going to be talking about\nhow to bring out the best in everyone\naround you this is important for I\nbelieve every single person not just\nleaders but for every single person\nbecause each one of us interact with\npeople on a daily basis and so if you're\na leader this is great for you if you\nhave a significant other if you are in a\nfamily or if you're a parent these will\nall be five different tips to help you\nbring out the best in everybody else\nthat's around you and I saved the best\none for last and what I think is the\nmost important one and so let's go ahead\nand dive into these five different\ntopics so that you can bring out the\nbest in people who are around you the\nfirst one is this to bring out the best\nin people around you find reasons to\nrecognize them not reasons to reprimand\nthem the average child is reprimanded\neight times more than their price\ngrowing up\ntake that in for a second eight times\nmore than their praise the average child\nthinks I'm not doing it right or I'm not\ngood enough and so if we can start to\nbuild confidence into the people around\nus instead of finding what's wrong and\nstart finding what's right it allows\nthem to build confidence in themselves\nand so the one thing that I've found\namong a lot of leaders new leaders\nmyself included I was terrible at this\nwhen I was a new leader and I started\ntrying to help people grow is I would\nalways tell them what they were doing\nwrong\nthinking that I was helping them out\nbut in turn I was lowering their\nconfidence by telling them all the\nthings that they were doing wrong and so\nwhat you do instead of telling somebody\nwhat they're doing wrong is praise them\nwhen they do something right there's one\nthing that I know about humans is I\ndon't know one person who doesn't love\npositive reinforcement and so let's say\nfor instance your husband doesn't do the\ndishes\na lot of times if your husband doesn't\ndo the dishes you're like Tim what the\n why didn't you do the dishes I told\nyou do the dishes right well that in\nturn makes Tim feel bad makes him feel\nlike he's not worth it makes him feel\nlike he's not good enough so instead of\nyelling at him and this could be for\nyour children this could be for anyone\naround instead of yelling at someone\nwhen they do something quote unquote\nwrong what you do is you find reasons to\nactually praise people\nso instead of yelling at him when he\ndoesn't do the dishes when he was\nsupposed to do the dishes if Tim puts\none fork away praised him oh my God\nhoney thank you so much for putting that\nfork away it might seem super stupid and\nthe key is also don't do this\ncondescendingly don't be like oh my God\nTim thank you so much for putting that\nfork away but it's like hey thank you so\nmuch for putting your plate away when\nyou got done whatever it is we want to\nbe recognized people want to be\nrecognized we want to be seen we want to\nbe heard and we want to be this is very\nimportant we want to be validated we\nwant to feel like we're worthy we want\nto feel like we're doing good in this\nworld we want to feel like we're doing\ngood around the house positive\nreinforcement always does better than\nnegative reinforcement and it makes\nsense because\nwhat happens is when he gets that\npositive reinforcement before going back\nto Tim right\nyour made-up husband that we're making\nup Tim your made-up husband when he gets\npraised for doing something he gets a\nlittle bit of dopamine he gets a little\nbit of oxytocin the love chemical and\nfeels like you know what it felt good\nwhen my wife said that to me it felt\ngood when this happened and then the\nnext time he has the opportunity he's\nprobably going to put it away and then\nnext time he sees the dishes and this\nisn't like a switch that's going to just\nflip overnight this also isn't a way to\nuse reinforcement to get what you want\nI'm going to say that but what happens\nis\nwe start to actually crave the positive\nreinforcement and when we know we did\nsomething and got PODS of reinforcement\nagain subconsciously we're actually\ngoing to start to do those things and\nthis could be for doing the dishes this\ncould be if you're a leader and you have\nsomeone on your team that screwed up a\nwhole bunch of things what you do and\nand I found this from a lot of really\ngreat leaders is you find reasons to\npositively reinforce whatever it is they\ndo so find reasons to recognize versus\nreasons to reprimand so that's the first\nthing\nthe second thing is this\noffer public recognition when you can as\nwell and so you know let's let's say\nthat you're uh and this is also don't do\nthis condescendingly as well let's say\nthat instead of talking about Tim we're\ntalking about your child and we're\nwanting your children to start putting\ntheir dishes away let's say they take\nout the trash let's use a different\nexample your son you've been wanting him\nto take out the trash when he takes out\nthe trash I don't want you to to to\noffer public recognition and the fact of\nlike standing on top of the kitchen\ncounter and being like Sammy took out\nthe trash everybody let's give him a\nround of applause that's not that that\ncould actually work against you and make\nsomebody feel like you're being\ncondescended to them what I mean by that\nis do it naturally you know when when\nyou positively reinforce you could do it\nin private which is completely fine as\nwell but you can also sometimes do it in\npublic you know let's say you've got\nthree kids and you've got a husband and\nSammy does take out the trash Sammy hey\nthank you so much buddy for taking out\nthe trash I really appreciate I love you\nand he hears it and he feels good\nbecause he was given positive\nreinforcement in front of others\nbut at the same time everybody else in\nthe family sees oh he did a good job he\ndid this you know what Mom or Dad gave\nhim recognition when he acted this way\nyou know what I I want recognition for\nMom and Dad you know what I should do I\nshould also try to take the trash out or\ntry to help around the house and we're\ntalking about chores right now I've just\nkind of gone on the I don't know why I\nstarted on dishes and taking out the\ntrash but this is also for leaders as\nwell you know you could have a sales\nteam\nand you could have a sales person that's\ngot lower than average results but\nthey're making more phone calls than\neverybody else so instead of going hey\nJohn you know I'm looking at your sales\npercentage and your sales percentage is\ncrap instead of saying something like\nthat and thinking that that's going to\nhelp them if they made more phone calls\nthan everybody else why don't you\nrecognize them for that in a public\nsetting hey you know this person had so\nmany sales last week let's give them a\nround of applause this person had the\nhighest closing percentage just give\nthem a round of applause and the person\nwho made the most phone calls the\nhardest working person that we saw last\nweek was this person that person then\nfeels better about themselves than\nfeeling down on themselves for possibly\nshitty results and what you're doing is\nyou're reinforcing positively what you\nwant to see in them but also the rest of\nthe team can see it as well oh man like\nhe outworks me he did double the amount\nof calls that I did I want to do that I\nwant to be recognized in front of\neverybody next week I'm gonna make some\nmore phone calls and so what it's about\nis finding people finding reasons\nto reinforce and to recognize people\nversus reprimand them as tip number one\nsays but then also what you do is you\ncan do it in a public setting which\nmakes people feel like you know what I\nam doing a good job here I am doing you\nknow I'm getting better I'm working\nharder than everybody else and what\nyou're doing is you're reinforcing\nthe the ways that you want people to\nwork in your company and what happens is\nmore people want to be recognized so\nmore people actually step out and what\nhappens is that starts to bring out the\nbest in them that starts to bring out\ninstead of the fears and unlimiting\nbeliefs it starts to bring out the idea\nof like hey I can do this I can work\nhard my closing percentage might not be\nas high as I want it to be but damn it I\ncan at least make more phone calls and\nthrough that repetition of doing more\nand more and more they will get better\nat their phone calls they will get\nbetter at their closing percentage and\nso it's like how can you publicly\nrecognize people as well privately\npublicly all of that\nhow can you just find more good in\npeople Okay the third thing which is\nvery important as a leader which I\ndefinitely don't see enough is model the\nway that you want people to be you have\nto be the lighthouse and so if you want\nsomeone to work hard you've got to\nactually show like if I'm if I'm running\na team a company\nI want people to see like I work hard\nnobody in the company will outwork me\nand it makes them realize like hey he's\nnot going to come and just tell me to\nwork hard and then go chill like he's\ngoing to tell me to work hard because\nthat's the culture of the team that's\nthe culture of what we do here and so\nyou have to actually model the way you\nwant people to be and so\nthere's the phrase that Gandhi says\nwhich is be the change that you want to\nsee in the world well be the change that\nyou want to see in that person\ndon't give them tips on how they should\ndo better and then you're not doing that\nexact thing because that's going to go\nin when you're not there they're going\nto say yeah great tip but they're not\ndoing that and so be the changes you\nwant to see in the world but be the\nchange you want to see in that person be\nthe change that you want to see in your\nfamily be the change that you want to\nsee in your relationship with your\nhusband or wife or your significant\nother be the changes you want to see in\na relationship with your parents and\nwhen you start to be that change I mean\nyou are the one listening to this\npodcast episode they're not listening to\nthis podcast episode there are times\nmany times in our life where if we're\ngrowing and we're trying to become\nbetter we need to actually be that\nchange that we want to see in the\nrelationship because most people don't\ntry to change a relationship that's been\naround for a while\nthere usually needs to be one person\nthat steps up and says like hey I'm\ngoing to lead this and you don't say\nthis to person directly but you say it's\nin your own head of like I'm going to\nlead this I see the direction that I\nwant my relationship with my girlfriend\nwith my fiance with my wife with my\nbrother sister I I this is the\nrelationship that we've had and I think\nthat that relationship has another level\nit's more expansive and this is what we\nprobably need to do to step into that\nI'm going to be the first one to do this\nin order for us to step into that and so\nif you're not the person that's going to\nbe doing what you ask them to do your\nadvice is just going to go in one ear\nnot the other and so you need to be the\nexample of the advice that you're giving\nto others and so that's number three\nthe fourth one which is very important\nas far as how to bring out the best in\npeople this is for your family this is\nfor relationships and this is definitely\nvery very clear when you're in a company\nis to give people more autonomy like let\nthem lead themselves a little bit more\nso many people and I did this when I was\na new manager\nI micromanage way too much way too much\nand in turn when you micromanage people\nyou actually\nmake their confidence go down you make\nthem feel worse about themselves you\nhave to give them power let them find\nthe power within themselves let them\ndiscover their own power because\nmicromanaging does one of two things we\nthink that it's doing well and it's\ngoing to be helping our company it's\ngoing to be helping our family whatever\nit is\nbut micromanaging does two things number\none it lowers people's confidence a lot\nof times and number two it always\nenables them to need you\nwe don't want to enable somebody to need\nyou we want people to be able to build\ntheir own confidence in themselves and\nwhat they're doing and so what we need\nto do is we need to get better at\ntrusting somebody knowing\nthey're going to up at some point\nin time like just trust that's going to\nhappen trust them to do what's right\nand be 100 open to the fact that they\nwill mess things up\nbut the way to learn and improve is not\nto be told what to do a lot of times\nit's to mess things up ourselves see\nwhat we did wrong and to make\nadjustments and the way that I like to\nhelp people when instead of\nmicromanaging is something I was taught\nwhen I was younger and a very new\nmanager is instead of saying like hey\nthis is the thing I want you to improve\non is you give what I like to call a\nfeedback sandwich a feedback sandwiches\nyou tell them the good thing you tell\nthem the bad thing and then you tell\nthem another good thing and so it feels\ngood so it feels good because you say\nsomething good\nthen you you know soften the blow by\ngiving them something bad right after\nthat and then you tell them something\ngood as well so that they the\nconversation starts and ends on a\npositive note\nand so what they do is you what you do\nis you recognize hey\nI'll give you a great example if we're\ngoing back to the sales team example\nrecognize that they did really well hey\nJohn dude I love your energy on your\nphone calls I love the energy every time\nI'm walking by your cubicle every time\nI'm walking by your office I love the\nway that you connect with every single\nperson the one thing that I think that\nyou probably need some improvement in is\nyour closing percentage and I think if\nyou tried this thing and this thing it\nwould help you with your closing\npercentage\nbut the last thing I'll tell you about\nit is this dude I love your hard work\nlike you were out working every single\nperson on sales floor your skills are\ngetting better every single month every\nsingle week every single day and I know\nif you do number one keep that energy\nHigh\nand connect with your prospects and make\nmore phone calls anybody else your\nclosing percentage is going to fix\nitself\nso those are those are things I really\nwant you to focus on how does that sound\nand what instead of just going hey John\nyour closing percentage sucked last week\nright like that's what a lot I've I have\nmessed that up I have been that guy and\ndriven a lot of people away from\nbusinesses in my business in the past so\nit's the feedback sandwich tell them\nsomething you like something that's\ngoing well it could be the tiniest thing\ntoo like the energy on the phone call it\ncould be like hey man I love that you\ncome in here and you seem to be like the\nbrightest person in here as far as like\nthe energy that you bring the light that\nyou bring people love being around\nwhatever it is it could be a tiny thing\nit doesn't be something massive so\nsomething that's going well the thing\nthat they need Improvement on and then\nwhat you really love about them so it's\na good bad good feedback sandwich you\ncould do that with your children you\ncould do that with company you could do\nit with everything so that's the\nfeedback sandwich\nso that's number four\nand number five the one that I feel is\nthe most important that I think most\npeople just really miss is\ndon't try to change them try to love\nthem for who they are\nso\npeople what I people in their own minds\nalready talked down to themselves enough\nlike your children talk down themselves\nyou're not enough your sales reps talk\ndown themselves enough your husband and\nwife probably talked down themselves\nenough\ntoo many people want to we want to\nchange people into who we want them to\nbe versus loving them to give them a\nsafe space for them to step up and\nexpand into who they can actually be and\nwho they want to be\nso people already talk to themselves\nenough if you really want to bring out\nthe best in someone love them for who\nthey are\nbecause all too often people want\npeople want someone that they're in a\nrelationship with or someone they manage\nwe want them to be who we want them to\nbe versus who they are brought on this\nEarth to actually be who they're\nsupposed to be\nwhat they are supposed to be here to do\nso don't try to fix them I've heard this\nmany times and I can think of a very\nspecific example one time at a seminar\nthat was running an event that I was\nrunning there was a lady that stood up\nand she was like my son he doesn't\nlisten to me he's 16 years old he does\nthis this this this this and I wish he\nwas not lazy so much I wish that he\nwould do this I wish that he would do\nthis I wish that he would do this and I\nwas like hey\nyou know after hearing her talk for a\nlittle while I was like I think the\nproblem\nis that you're not just loving him for\nwho he is\nand he's probably coming to you would be\nmy assumption that he's coming to you\nand he's coming to you to vent he's\ncoming to you to tell him what's going\non with for to have him tell you what's\ngoing on in his life\nand to probably just feel seen and heard\nby his mother and you're trying to fix\nit you're trying to change him\nand she like immediately clicked started\nbawling and she's like oh my God he\ntells me that I'm not listening to him\nall the time and I was like yes you're\nhearing him but he's not feeling seed\nand he's not feeling understood and\nthat's what we need to do is create a\nsafe space for you not to be like hey\nyou're lazy you're not working as hard\nas you post you're not doing this you're\nnot doing this you're not doing this\nand if he comes to you with any problems\ngoing on his life instead of trying to\nfix all of those problems\njust listen\nsometimes people just need a vent just\nneed to get it out there and love him\nfor who he is instead of trying to fix\nhim and mold him into who you want him\nto be that is the biggest key for\nhelping people become the best that they\ncould possibly be and to really become\nwho they can be and should be as well\nand so those are the six tips number one\nfind reasons to recognize versus reasons\nto reprimand number two offer public\nrecognition when you can and make it\nauthentic number three model and become\nthe persons you want like model the\ntraits that you want that want to see in\nthem number four trust them give them\nmore autonomy number five don't try to\nchange them just freaking love the\nperson for who they are and they will\nthen in turn feel like it's a safe space\nfor them to become the better version of\nthemselves so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on
