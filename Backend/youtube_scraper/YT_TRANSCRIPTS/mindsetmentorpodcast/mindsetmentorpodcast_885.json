your life so\nmuch easier and it's very simple but\nonce again with it being very simple\ndoes not mean that it's very easy to do\ntoday is probably going to be a deep\nepisode so buckle up I hope you're ready\nfor it today we're going to talk about\nforgiveness now you might be like oh\n that sucks I don't want to listen\nabout forgiveness cool follow me on this\njourney because I know some of you\nlistening\nprobably a lot of you listening still\nhaven't forgiven people for something\nthat they did to you three four five\nyears ago and you are you are carrying\nthat with you and I'm not saying to\nforgive somebody for their sake because\na lot of times when people have problems\nwith forgiveness what the reason why\nthey have promised forgiveness is\nbecause they're like no that person\nscrewed me over they don't deserve my\nforgiveness no no I'm not talking about\nthem deserving your forgiveness I'm\ntalking about you deserving forgiving\nthem because you are continuing to carry\nthat with you and to bring it with you\nif you are noticing that you are still\nholding on to something and haven't\nforgiven that\nso let's start off at this place I\nbelieve at the core of every single\nperson everyone is has has innocence\neveryone is good I believe the core of\nmyself that every single person is good\nat their core\nI don't believe that there's somebody\nwho's born into this world and as a baby\nthey're just automatically bad they\nautomatically steal they automatically\nhurt people I believe and I'm going to\ntake you on this journey today\nnow that's somebody who has lost\nanything that takes them away from what\nis good and the Innocence that they have\num hurts them in some sort of way and we\ndon't necessarily stay Innocent but our\ncore can still say good and so when I\nsay we don't stay innocent things happen\nlife happens you cannot go through this\nworld without some form of a scar things\nhappen trauma happens Society happens we\nget kicked in the face we get scars all\nkinds of things the world happens as we\ncontinue to grow up and what we're all\nsearching for in this world in my belief\nis inner peace we're searching for some\ndeep feeling of\nforeign\nthat just release as you know it's like\num\nI remember ramdas talking about a guru\nthat he followed said death is like\ntaking off a tight shoe and that's what\nthat's what I mean by that it's like we\nhave this tight shoe of who we're\nsupposed to be how we're supposed to be\nhow we're supposed to act and then it's\njust like ah it's like that release\nafter you take off a tight shoe and so\nwhat I think we're all searching for is\nthat release that piece that it feels\nlike when you take off a tight shoe\nright I don't think that we're searching\nfor happiness I think that we're\nsearching for peace and the reason why\nis because I believe that happiness is a\nfleeting emotion what do I mean by\nfleeting emotion you can be happy right\nnow you can get a phone call and it can\ncompletely Sidetrack your happiness it\ncould be gone like that but peace peace\nis a state of being it is a feeling that\nis below at the core below all of the\nmonkey mind the thoughts the\nthe happiness the sadness the pissed off\nall of those things below all of that is\na sense of peace and I think that's what\nall of us are actually trying to work\ntowards and you cannot it's important\nyou cannot have peace if you see the\nworld as guilty and bad\nbecause you operate in the world every\nday all day\nyou cannot have peace in your life if\nyou see the world and see other people\nas guilty and bad this is the reason the\ncore of my belief of why I think the\nnews is so terrible for humans is\nbecause the news perpetuates this thing\nas if the world is bad it is people are\nguilty it is unsafe\nwhen I don't believe it's that way at\nall are there bad things that happen are\nthere people that do things of course\nbut what I'm saying is I think that's\nlike one percent uh 99 are really really\ngood it's probably even a higher than 99\nit's like 99.9 are really really good\nand point one percent are just lost and\nthe key to unlocking peace is to try to\nevery single day see the world as more\ngood than anything else and forgive no\nmatter what\nforgive no matter what and anyone who is\nbad if we look at if we look at\nthe core of everyone is good the\nstatement I say at the beginning we were\nborn into this world good anyone who\ndoes bad is lost from their true self\nit's not their who they truly are it's\nthat they are lost from their true self\nthey don't actually know what they're\ndoing\nthey are lost\nand so anyone who has hurt you\nis also hurting themselves because they\nare lost\nand to hold any resentment towards\nsomebody who has hurt you only hurts us\nit doesn't hurt them in any sort of way\nyou know it's like Mark Twain says anger\nis anger and resentment is the acid that\nburns the vessel when you hold anger and\nyou hold resentment towards someone it's\nlike holding on to acid it's not going\nto hurt them it's only going to hurt you\nand so someone who\nlet's take for instance someone who\nbreaks into houses and who steal stuff\nat their core I don't think they\nactually truly want to do that now you\nmight have a different belief if you do\nthat's fine this is just the way that I\ntend to operate in the world and\nsomething that's brought me a whole lot\nof peace somebody who and I'll give you\nperfect example I years ago when I had\nan office and I had sales reps that\nwould come in and stuff I had somebody\ncome in and in the middle of I don't\nknow us being there us being in and out\nof the office somebody broke in in the\nmiddle of the day and stole our TV and\nour Nintendo Wii if you guys remember\nthe Nintendo Wii's back in the day and\nuh that night I had a team meeting\nand I remember if you've ever had\nsomebody break in and steal something\nfrom you it's a very um it's a very\nweird feeling because you feel not\nreally safe in what was once a safe\nplace and I remember somebody had\nmentioned it at the team meeting and\nthey're like hey what happened to the TV\nand the Wii like it's gone and I said\nyeah somebody stole it today and they're\nlike oh my God like aren't you pissed\nall of this stuff and I remember just\nthinking if they stole it they must need\nit more than me and that's what I had\nsaid ah they stole it they must need it\nmore than me am I excited about it being\nstolen no\nbut I could get another one so if they\nstole it they must need it worse than me\nso\ntake it I guess and so someone who\nbreaks into houses and steals stuff I\ndon't think the person who stole my TV\nin the in the Wii were necessarily\nsomebody who at their core was like I'm\ndoing something good like they know\nthat's not who they want to be and you\nknow that could be somebody who a child\nwho wasn't loved correctly it could be a\nsomebody a child who wasn't taught what\nis right and what is wrong and if\nsomebody is if you know it's somebody\nthat is hurting\nand they think that by having it they\nwill have more peace but then they\nrealize that thing never brings them\nmore peace\nand when you see that that person wants\nmore peace they're just lost you can\nkind of look at them from a place of a\nlittle bit more love\nI'll give you a great example right I\ncan look at my father who is an\nalcoholic who you know died when I was\n15 years old and I can resent the\nout of him for all the things I had to\ngo through when I was a child of course\nI can and that's my prerogative if I\nwant to hold that stance and be pissed\noff at him you know he died 20 21 years\nago I can still be pissed off about that\nif I want to and some people do\ndo that and that's fine that's that's\ntheir choice to be pissed off but I can\nalso look at that and say that was\nsomeone who was lost you know if my\nfather passed away from being an\nalcoholic he was someone who was lost\nand then I can look at his point of view\nand realize that he was an alcoholic\nbecause he walked into the room minutes\nafter his father shot himself in the\nmouth of the shotgun when he was 12\nyears old and instead of looking at the\n48 year old man who passed away from\nbeing an alcoholic and left me in this\nworld without him I can instead go you\nknow what that was just a 12 year old\nkid who never overcame a extremely\nincredible trauma and I can have love\nfor him in that case instead of feeling\nhatred towards him\nwhatever choice we decide to choose is\nfine in that situation but for me I just\nsee it as someone who is lost and maybe\ndidn't get the love that they needed to\nand they didn't get the the\nrapy that they needed to or they needed\nto change their mindset around it and so\nin turn turn to alcohol and it ended up\nthe way that it ended up I believe that\neverything happens for a reason and so I\nbelieve that that happened the way\nexactly it was supposed to happen and so\ndon't see the person who did it\nsee the hurt child that's behind it and\nthat's kind of what I tend to go to is\nwhen I see someone who's hurting me or\nacting a certain way or doing this I\ntend not to see them as the adult that\nthey are and I tend to see them as the\nchild that is hurt behind it because at\ntheir core they are good so if they are\nhurting someone in some way they are\nlost in some sort of way there was some\nsort of break from what is right and\nwhat is wrong and what is good I guess\nit's a better way of saying it and take\nright or wrong out of it what is good\ntheir core at who they are and they\nbroke away from that there was something\nsome sort of trauma some sort of action\nthat made them fall away from that thing\nso you know if you're looking at it and\nsomebody cheated on you\nthat has nothing to do with you\nyou might think that it does\nI've been cheated on before in the past\nthat had nothing to do with me\nbut that has nothing to do with you a\nlot of times what it comes back to is\ntheir lack of love for themselves which\ncame from a lack of love from their\nparents and then they have to go search\nfor it in someone else because the next\nquote-unquote Conquest the next person\nthey get to hook up with whatever it is\nmaking them feel in that moment not\nactually at their core like they're\ngetting some love that they never got\nwhen they were a child it is a search\nfor love it is a search for acceptance\nit is a search for self-worth\nand so in this world there is only\nsanity and there is only insanity\nand when I say Insanity I don't mean\nlike mentally clinically insane what I\nmean is sanity is a state where you do\nwhen you're when someone is in a place\nof Sanity it is a state where you are\ndoing right for yourself and you're\ndoing right for others that is sanity\ninsanity\nis a state that hurts others\nand so when someone is hurting others\nthey are in a state of insanity and when\nyou hurt others you only hurt yourself\nbecause you carry that wrongdoing with\nyou\nso if you look at it some people might\nsay this a little bit different some\npeople might say there's only love and\nfear in this world right so love and\nfear love would be sanity and anything\nthat is not love would be insanity and\nso everyone is just where they are\neveryone is doing the best with what\nthey have and so for me it's very easy\nwhen I look at people who fight over\npolitical parties and stuff I've said\nthis many times before on the podcast if\nI had even if I don't believe in\nsomeone's views if I had their exact\nsame life every single second of my life\nwas exactly the same as theirs my\nparents people I talked to family every\nsingle second of my life was identical\nto theirs I would have the exact same\nbeliefs as them\nbecause everyone wherever they are is\ndoing the best with what they have if\nyou were in their exact same shoes with\nthe exact same childhood the exact same\nparents and raising you would have made\nthe same choice\nif you went through all of those things\nyou would have made the exact same\nChoice someone's actions are always a\nreflection of their consciousness\nand so when you start to think of that\nthat when so when you hear that\nsomeone's actions are always a\nreflection of their Consciousness you\ncan actually start to see\noh if someone acts someone's actions are\nbad that means their Consciousness and\nwhat's going on behind the scenes is\nbad it is far from where they they're\nlost from that state of good you know\nand it's it's if you look at I can even\ngo and talk about you know if you look\nat Jesus for instance whether you\nbelieve he was a person who existed\nwhether you believe it's just a story\nwhatever it is whatever you believe\ndoesn't actually matter in this case but\nin the story when he's being murdered\nthe thing that he says is forgive them\nFather for they know not what they're\ndoing and so that's a good example of\nsomebody who understands the\nconsciousness of the people around him\nforgive them Father for they know not\nwhat they're doing and so he could see\npast the actions\nthey were in front of him and what was\nhappening to the Consciousness that\nthose people had so for us it'd be very\nwhat I'm trying to do more often is to\nstop seeing past to see past what's\nhappening right in front of me and what\npeople present themselves to be and\nstart to see pasta to see what the\nconsciousness of that person is\nbecause people don't know what they're\ndoing most of the time a sane person\nwould never do those actions so it must\nmean that there is some form of insanity\nonce again when I say Insanity I don't\nmean clinically insane I just mean that\nthey're lost they're off the path in\nsome way and so\nour truest self would see a sick person\nthat's in need of healing\nand the ego sees an evil person that's\nin need and in need of punishing so let\nme say that again because I want you to\nreally get this in your head our truest\nself should see a sick person so if\nsomeone's hurting us you know if\nsomeone's doing these things out in the\nworld our truest self should see a sick\nperson that is in need of healing\nand none of this has to do with any\nreligion at all so I'm not saying\nhealing and they need God or they need\nthis religion or that religion I'm just\nsaying that they are off of the path an\nego though so a true self sees someone\nthat a sick person is in need of healing\nthe ego sees an evil person that's in\nneed of punishing everyone in this earth\njust wants peace Everyone is always\ndoing what they believe will bring them\nhappiness or make them feel better\nand what you judge and you condemn you\nstrengthen\nwhat you judge and you condemn you\nstrengthen to judge and condemn the\nthief\nthen strengthens the identity that they\nhave of themselves as a thief\nthink of that for a second I remember\nseeing a a video one time of a woman who\nyou know there's this teenage boy who\nmurdered her teenage son and at the end\nof it when he was convicted the one\nwhose son was murdered went up to the\nchild who murdered her son and said I\nforgive you\nthat might be the biggest\nstep of forgiveness that a human can do\nthis child murdered her child and she\nwent up to that child and said I forgive\nyou\nbecause what happens is when we judge\nand we condemn we strengthen their\nidentification as that thing\nso in her case if she had you know\njudged and condemned she would\nstrengthen that person's identity as a\nmurderer which they did murder but\ndoesn't mean that they have to be a\nmurderer forever they can people can\nchange they can get back on the right\npath but to judge and condemn somebody\nis to strengthen their identification of\nthat thing because when I go to somebody\nand I say oh you're a cheater it then\nstrengthens their identity of themself\nas a cheater it doesn't take them any\ncloser to Healing it actually takes them\nfurther away because I am strengthening\nthat thought of himself\nso you know a thief and a cheater I\ndon't actually truly believe that they\nfeel good about what they did they know\ntheir truest self knows that it is wrong\nso to judge a person and to label them\nas a thief strengthens their belief that\nthat's what they are to judge them and\nto condemn them for being a cheater\nstrengthens that that's what they are\nwhich means that they are more likely to\ndo it again which means that I am just\nperpetuating the problem by viewing them\nas that and by saying to them that's who\nthey are\nthey see it in themselves\nand they see it in their thinking into\nwho they are and everything and for an\noutside perspective to come in and say\nthat to him does not help them heal in\nany sort of way but to forgive and to\nlove somebody\nand to actually whether you say that to\nhim or not\nand you say hey I forgive this person\nwhether that is let's let's just say you\nnever even say it to him let's say\nsomeone cheated on you and you forgive\nthem at your core and you say you know\nwhat they were lost they were somebody\nwho just needed they needed their\nself-worth was low they're searching for\nlove they're searching for self-worth I\nforgive them that in turn even if it's\nnever said to them ever in my mind that\nConsciousness shift in your mind starts\nto change the world and that's all that\nwe really need is for more conscious\n Consciousness shifts conscious\nshits Consciousness shifts inside of us\nto help heal the world a little bit more\nso when I say to love and forgive\nsomebody\nbecause they didn't know what they did\nwhat I mean is to love and forgive them\nthey didn't know what they did and\nloving and forgiving them is actually\nmaking change inside of yourself\nmore than anything else so you're doing\nthe forgiveness for yourself\nand if you do that and you take off this\nlittle bit of dirt that you've been\nholding on you for the longest time it\nmakes you cleaner to God into the world\nto actually operate from a better place\nof consciousness\nand in turn every single person that you\ntalk to is going to be impacted in a\ndifferent way by that so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode go
