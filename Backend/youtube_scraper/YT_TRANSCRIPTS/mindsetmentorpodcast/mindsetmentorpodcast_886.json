send you an\nemail every single Monday of what I'm\nfocusing on with my mindset to improve\nand so that you can improve your mindset\nas well so if you want to go there I\nwill send it to you and it is absolutely\nfree today I'm going to give you three\nsteps to stop being overwhelmed and uh I\nthink this is important because I think\na lot of people especially nowadays are\nstarting to get extremely overwhelmed\nwith everything that's going on in their\nlife everything that's going on outside\nof their life\nall of the stuff in the world and so I\nwas on a group coaching call and one of\nmy clients was talking about something\nthat's going on in their life and they\nsaid it's making me overwhelmed and\njust want to pause is there something in\nyour life that's making you overwhelmed\nI want you to think about that thing\nwhat is it in your life that is making\nyou overwhelmed\ndo you have it in the front of your mind\nokay we're going to talk about it when I\nlisten to people speak I listen on two\ndifferent levels I listen to what\nthey're saying to me and I try to listen\nto what is behind what they're they're\nsaying I'm trying to listen to the story\nthat their subconscious is actually\ntelling themselves about XYZ\ncircumstance I'm actually way less\nconcerned about what you do I'm way more\nconcerned about the story that you're\ntelling yourself and the reason why is\nbecause if I can find the story that\nyou're telling yourself because we're\nall telling yourself a story in some\nsort of way\nif I can identify what the story is and\nwhat you are perceiving it to be it's\nusually very I don't want to say easy\nit's it's easier to dissolve whatever\nthe actual problem quote-unquote problem\nis to you so you know he was saying blah\nblah blah and it's making me overwhelmed\nand he said it's making me overwhelmed\nso I mean if you're in the situation\nmaybe if you ever thought like hey work\nis making me overwhelmed my schedule is\nmaking me overwhelmed my relationship is\nmaking you overwhelmed I'm here to tell\nyou no it's not\nyou know I'd be like what no but Rob\nlike work is so overwhelming there's so\nmuch that I have to do no no no no it's\nnot overwhelming you are making you\noverwhelmed\nwhen you say and there's a there's a\nsmall tweak here but when you say it's\nmaking me overwhelmed you are playing\nthe victim\nwork is making me overwhelmed that's\nlike oh there's nothing I can do about\nit work is making me overwhelmed oh my\nschedule is making me overwhelmed oh my\nschedule is making me over one there's\nnothing I can do about it it's playing a\nvictim card it's not taking a powerful\nplace it's not stepping up to the plane\nsaying I'm going to fix this listen to\nthese words real quick it is making me\noverwhelmed versus I am making myself\noverwhelmed\nit is making me overwhelmed is taking\nthe blame and placing it externally I am\nmaking myself overwhelmed\nis taking it and making it internal it\nputs you in a place of power because\nit's not actually work that's making you\noverwhelmed it's the way that you think\nabout work that's making you overwhelmed\nit's not your relationship that's making\nyou overwhelmed it is what you are\nthinking about with your relationship\nthat is making you overwhelmed and so\nwhen you can say I am making myself\noverwhelmed it puts you in a place of\npower when it is external you cannot\nchange it when it is you you can change\nit but it also puts it also shifts the\nway that you think about these things\nbecause you realize\noh it's my fault and when it is your\nfault you can change it now a lot of\npeople don't like to make things their\nfault they like to make themselves the\nvictim they like to play the victim card\nand the reason why is because it's just\neasier it requires no effort to say work\nis making me overwhelmed it requires\neffort in Our Minds when I go I'm making\nmyself over one because then we go oh\n I gotta do something about this\nbecause I'm making myself so overwhelmed\nit changes the way that you perceive\nthings when you can say I am making\nmyself overwhelmed it puts you\nessentially in the driver's seat of your\nown life which I don't know about you I\nwant everything to be my fault the\nreason why I want everything to be my\nfault is because I can then change it it\nalmost overwhelmed almost never comes\nfrom what you're actually doing\nit doesn't overwhelm comes from what you\nthink about what you're doing you know\noverwhelm is when you have 20 things on\nyour to-do list right 40 things let's\nsay you have 40 things here oh my God\nit's such a long to-do list you have 40\nthings on your to-do list\nwhy are you overwhelmed it's not because\nof the things on your to-do list it's\nbecause you're trying to think and plan\nout all 40 of them at one time you're\ntrying to figure out a way to do all 40\nof them at the exact same time and of\ncourse hell yeah that's overwhelming but\nyou're the one that's creating the\noverwhelm\nbecause you can't do all 40 of them at\none time you can only do one at a time\nthere's a whole lot less overwhelm when\nyou have a 40 you know to to-do list is\n40 items long and you go okay what's\nnumber one\nnumber one is this okay I'm going to\ntake my time and I'm going to work on\nnumber one there's a whole lot less\noverwhelm when you just work on one\nthing at a time versus you trying to\nfigure out how to do 40 things at one\ntime because there will never be a way\nto do 40 things at one time which in\nitself makes you feel overwhelmed and so\nwe're going to go through a couple\ndifferent things we're going to see\nthree different steps to help you stop\nbeing so overwhelmed and uh you know\nchange the way that you look change the\nway that you look at it but also start\nto change the way that you act and\nthings that you do\nFirst Step number one that I'm going to\ngive you is just do one thing at a time\njust do one thing at a time don't try to\nmultitask don't try to plan everything\nout just figure out the one thing that\nis the most important thing and do that\nthing the thing that I always tell\npeople I've been saying this for years\nif you get overwhelmed with your to-do\nlist and all the stuff that have to be\ndone in one day\nand you want to be highly productive not\nbusy but you want to be productive\nbecause and let me explain what busy\nversus productive is because busy is\nwhen you have a to-do list and you're\ndoing all the things that don't really\nmatter it's when you get to the end of\nthe day and you feel like you got\nnothing done you ever done that before\nwhere you're just busy all day long and\nat the end of the day you're like I feel\nlike I got nothing done why because\nyou're probably doing the things that\ndidn't matter you were being busy versus\nbeing productive and so instead of you\nknow doing it having that really hard\nconversation with one of your employees\nthen you're working from home you decide\nto do the laundry instead so you decided\nto go for the easy thing it's still\nsomething to be done but you decide to\ngo for the easy thing versus the\nimportant thing and so what you do is\nthis\nyou look at your to-do list you take out\na cue card and on that three by five\ncard the little index card you write\ndown the number one most important thing\nyou write down the number two most\nimportant thing you write down number\nthree most important thing and you only\nfocus on those three things today but\none thing at a time you only focus on\nnumber one and you don't do anything\nelse until number one is done and then\nif you do happen to get number one done\ntoday even if you spend all day working\non number one I'm fine with that because\nyou're at least moving the needle in\nyour life which is important so as long\nas you get number one done great that\nwas a productive day if you get the most\nif you just think about every single day\nif you got the most important thing done\nevery single day how productive you\nwould be how productive you feel where\nyou would be in a year if you got the\nmost important thing done every single\nday you'd be in a great position so one\nthing at a time\nnumber one you get that thing done then\nyou can move on to number two then you\ncan move on to number three and you take\nthat cue card that basically keep saying\ncue card it's an index card the three by\nfive card and you put it in your back\npocket and you bring that with you\neverywhere you go and you forget about\nthe other to-do list you'll still get\nthose things done they'll be done I\npromise you you'll figure out a way to\nto squeak in the laundry and to squeak\nin all the things that you need to get\npick up the kids and all that stuff but\nyou want to focus on the things that are\nthe most productive the things that need\nto be done and you do one thing at a\ntime why because think about this for\ninstance let's say that you come over to\nmy house and I'm like you know what I'm\ngonna cook you dinner right you come\nover my house and I I make steak and a\nbaked potato and a salad it's all\nperfectly executed because I'm an\namazing cook that's not true I'm not I'm\na cook but let's say that it's it's\namazing it comes out great and I give\nyou the plan I put the plan in front of\nyou like oh my god oh oh man I'm I am\nI'm so overwhelmed\nI'd be like that's weird because it's\njust steak and potato and salad\nyou're like I'm like I'm so overwhelmed\nI'm like why are you overwhelmed because\nI can't eat all of this at one time like\nwouldn't wouldn't that be crazy to try\nto take an entire plate of food and eat\nit all at one time you just shove all of\nit in your mouth it'd be crazy wouldn't\nit why is it any different with your\nto-do list you eat one bite at a time\nyou eat that bite and then when you're\ndone with that bite you put the next\nbite in your mouth and when you're done\nwith that bite you put the next bite in\nyour mouth and eventually the entire\nplate if you're eating all of it which\nif I'm cooking for you you better eat\nall of it right the entire plate is done\nbut you only got the plate eaten one\nbite at a time\nso what's the difference between eating\nthat plate and your to-do list\nthe only difference is the way that\nyou're thinking about it when you're\neating you know it's one bite a time\nbecause you've been trained that way for\nyour entire life that's what you've been\ndoing since you were a child but the\nto-do list we start thinking about all\nof them at one time oh I have to get all\nthese things done no no one bite at a\ntime what is the first bite that you\nhave to take out of this to-do list\nwhat's the second bite when you get done\nwith the first bite don't focus on the\nsecond bite until you know the first\nbite what is the second bite now that\nyou're done with your first bite that\nyou need to go after and you do one\nthing at a time because you are making\nyourself overwhelmed okay so that's the\nfirst thing one thing at a time\nalso don't try to multitask there's\nproof that multitasking actually makes\nyou dumber there's also proof that\npeople that multitask put out way lower\nquality work than people who what they\ndo what they call single tasking so if\nyou want to be more efficient you want\nto be better put out better work get\nstuff done faster and put out better\nwork you know that sounds pretty good to\nme\nfaster and better work single task one\nthing at a time so that's the first\nthing number two\nstop doing too many things now this\nmight sound the same as number one but\nit's not when I say too many things stop\nsaying yes to everyone one of the things\nthat I have found that makes people\nextremely overwhelmed is saying yes to a\nlot of people's requests get better at\nsaying no and I was reading this morning\nI was reading meditations by Marcus\nAurelius it's incredible if you've never\nread it Marcus Aurelius was one of the\nRoman emperors and he had a journal that\nhe always kept with him he was a very\nvery deep philosopher and he had a\njournal it was actually his diary and\nwhen he died it was supposed to be\nburned that was actually the request\nfrom him but people started reading it\nand going holy crap this is really good\nand they turned it into a book so this\npoor guy his diary was then turned into\na book but he's dead so who cares\num he doesn't know and and so you can\nread it's actually incredible because\nyou can read the most powerful man in\nthe world's thoughts because he's\njournaling to himself and it's his diary\nand you can see that he still deals with\nall of the exact same things that we\ndeal with all of them it's literally the\ncraziest thing to see the most powerful\nman in the world you know a couple of\nthousand years ago 1500 years ago\nwhatever it was\ndealing with the same that we deal\nwith today\nso when I say do less things one of the\nthings that he said is if you want more\nTranquility in your life do less things\nand what he said in the the next\nsentence after that was don't do less\nthings than the fact of stop doing so\nmuch it's due less things throughout the\nday and concentrate on what I like to\ncall depth over distance what do I mean\nby depth of a distance you work on\nbecoming better at just a few things\nonly do a few things but do them really\nreally well so when I say do less things\nI don't mean like take more naps I mean\nthe amount of things that you do instead\nof doing 10 things throughout the day do\ntwo but do two of them extremely well I\nmean like really well and that's\nhow you start to master something find\nsomething that you love to do and do it\nthe best that you possibly can every\nsingle day one of the greatest tragedies\nI think that has come with the internet\nI think the internet's great we've it's\nhelping people and it's not a bad thing\nat all is I think that it's very easy to\nlearn things which is awesome\nbut in turn a lot of people are becoming\na jack of all trades and they're kind of\ngetting good at guitar and then they're\nkind of getting good at this thing and\nthey're kind of getting good at you know\nthis thing and then they're kind of\ngetting good at learning about Bitcoin\nand they're kind of getting good at this\nand they're spreading themselves so thin\nwhich is what I mean by distance I'd\nrather go deeper into very few subjects\nversus wider and have a vast knowledge\nof many things and so stop doing too\nmany things start doing things that you\nlove but get really really deep into\nwhat those things are now you might be\nlike well I work a day job this doesn't\nmake any sense\nlisten to me whenever you're not working\nyour day job if you find something that\nyou love try to master it try to get\nbetter at it and and that's what I mean\nby don't do so many things\ndo less things\nthen that flows perfectly into number\nthree of the perfect Segway which is\nstop doing things that you don't love\nstop doing things that you don't love\nand uh I was talking to another one of\nmy clients the other day and and he was\ntalking through this and he was saying\nsomething to me about\num about how he was trying to do\nsomething but he kept getting feeling\nlike mental resistance towards something\nI have to do this thing but I'm feeling\nmeant to resist I have to do this thing\nbut I'm it's becoming hard for me and\nit's hard for me blah blah blah you kept\nsaying that and that alone shows his the\nway he's thinking about is that it's\nhard and when it's hard you're not going\nto go at something as much\nonce again he was making himself a\nvictim in this in this case but he felt\nresistance\nand I said well let me ask you a\nquestion is what you're doing right now\neven what you want to be doing and he's\nlike no and I was like the resistance\nthat you are finding is because you're\ndoing what you don't want to do\nlike you're just not doing something\nthat you want to do\none of the greatest tragedies I think\nthat people do is that they give up\nthe majority of their waking hours doing\nsomething that they don't love doing\nsimply because they get a paycheck doing\nit and I think that more people should I\nknow most people want to be out of the\njob that they have or a job that they\nlove more they might not hate their job\nit might be okay but there might be\nsomething better for them out there and\nI think that more people should do more\nof what they love and if you do what you\nlove you'll get really good at it and if\nyou get really good at it you can charge\na lot of money for it you can make a lot\nof money doing that thing it takes time\nyes but you're not doing enough of what\nyou love not doing enough what you love\nto try to master something but you're\nalso not doing enough of what you love\nas far as like what's fun to you and so\none thing that I would love for you to\ndo is this is to to when you get done\nwith this episode today\nmake a list of everything that you love\nto do it could be going for a run it\ncould be\nmeditating it could be cold plunges I\ndon't know there's all kinds of things\nit could be make a list of everything\nthat you love and then make a list of\neverything that makes you happy it could\nbe puppies it could be you know\nSunrise it could be whatever it is and\nmany things you possibly can that make\nyou happy so things that you love on one\nlist and things that make you happy on\nanother list and then look at those\nevery single morning and plan out how\nyou can get as many of those things into\nyour day it's much easier to go and work\nreally hard when your day is also a you\nknow even if you have a job that you're\nnot a huge fan of but outside of that\njob that you're not a fan of you still\nhave all a ton of things that you love\nto do because a lot of people have a job\nthat they don't love and then they come\nhome and they don't do anything and then\nthey get really sad and depressed\nbecause the fact that their entire life\nis made up of this job that they hate\nthat makes them tired well instead of\nthat\nwhat if you were to try to figure out\nokay I've got this thing that pays the\nbills let me figure out how to put as\nmany of these things that I love to do\nand the things that make me happy into\nmy day as as many of them as possible\nthat alone will make you feel better and\nit'll make you feel less overwhelmed and\nso those three things once again is do\none thing at a time number two stop\ndoing too many things try to get really\ngood at a couple things and then just do\nmore things that you love doing if you\ndo that it will be much more natural for\nyou to not be overwhelmed and then the\nsecond thing on top of that is what I\nsaid first which is change the way that\nyou're looking at overwhelm you are not\nbeing overwhelmed by work you are\noverwhelmed by the way that you're\nlooking at work instead of saying it is\nmaking me overwhelmed say I am making\nmyself overwhelmed that alone will flip\nyour perception of the way that you're\nlooking at it and now put you into a\nplace of power which one you're in a\nplace of power you can actually change\nit so that's what I got for
