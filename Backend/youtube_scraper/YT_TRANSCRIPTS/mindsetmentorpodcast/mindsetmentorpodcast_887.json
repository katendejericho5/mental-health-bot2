this\npodcast to people who have never heard\nof it before which allows us to grow and\nallows us to impact more lives so if you\ndo that I would greatly greatly\nappreciate it today we're going to talk\nabout self-love and we're going to talk\nabout what it is we're also going to\ntalk about what it is not and I'm going\nto be honest with you is going to\nsurprise you what self-love is because\nmost people when they think of the word\nself-love they think I need to love\nmyself more and they think I need to you\nknow what self-love I need to speak\nbetter to myself I need to tell myself\nthat I look good in these jeans I've\nbeen doing so well\nI need to tell myself that I'm an\namazing mother I need to tell myself how\ngreat I'm doing how proud of myself I am\nand I need to tell myself that I am such\na good person and although I've screwed\nup I forgive myself in while all of\nthose are self-love and they are\nbeautiful so those are I'm not saying\nthose are not self-love that is not all\nof self-love there's a whole other side\nof self-love that most people don't\nactually know about and that's what\nwe're going to dive into today is you\nknow there's there's a self-love which\nis like um I need to give myself a\nbeautiful mental verbal hug and that's\nwhat self-love is and that is a piece of\nself-love but I think that that is a\nsmaller piece of self-love than what I'm\nabout to teach you today and all of that\nis true\nbut I'll teach you the other side as\nwell but first let's talk about what is\nwhat is not self-love\num because a lot of people think\nself-love is something like having a\nglass of wine after a long day that is\nnot self-love that is the opposite full\nopposite of self-love having a self-love\nis not having a glass of wine after a\nlong day self-love is not eating fast\nfood because you're hungry and you don't\nwant to get hangry self-love is not\nskipping the gym because you've been\nworking so hard lately you've been so\nconsistent at the gym you can skip today\nthat's not self-love self-love is not\nhaving a cigarette because you had a\nstressful day and you quote unquote\ndeserve it or because your boss stressed\nyou out or because your co-workers\nstress you out any of those things none\nof those things that I mentioned are\nself-love but I think a lot of people\nthink oh\nyou know what I'm going to take a self\nself-love day and I'm gonna have you\nknow get my hair done and get my nails\ndone and then I'm gonna have a glass of\nwine and then I'm gonna watch some\nNetflix and I'm gonna have some ice\ncream that's not self-love sure taking\ncare of yourself and going get your\nhairs and everything else and that's\nfine but having a glass of wine and\nhaving ice cream and all of that stuff\nbecause maybe you've had a hard week\nthat's not self-love they're the\nopposite of self-loving and some of you\nmight be like triggered you might be\nlike no there's no way this guy's\ngot to be wrong but follow along with me\nbecause I'll actually tell you why\nbecause a glass of wine for instance\nwhich you know hey I've been known to\nhave a glass of wine after a long\nstressful day as well but I came to this\nrealization over time what it is\nactually doing so let's say that you had\na long day\nthe boss oh he was a dick you know he he\ntriggered you so many times your\nco-workers they're just a bunch of\nlittle shits you know like it's it was\none of those days boss pisses you off\nco-workers piss you off and you like I\njust want to get home and I want to have\na glass of wine\nokay let's talk about that for a second\nbecause a glass of wine is actually if\nyou're dealing with stress if you're\ndealing with stuff going on at work a\nglass of wine is actually a form of\nnumbing\nyou are numbing your feelings you're\nnumbing your emotions now let me take a\nstep back there's nothing wrong with a\nglass of wine and I'm gonna say this\nthere's nothing around the glass of wine\nI love my wine there's nothing wrong\nwith ice cream I think ice cream is\namazing as well but you have to be very\naware of how you're using it and why\nyou're using it right most adults\nwere never taught how to self-soothe\nso what do I mean by that if you see a\nchild that's crying let's say a newborn\nthat's crying the way that they are\nsoothed is by their parents and so their\nparents will pick them up and they will\nsoothe them to calm them down one of the\nthings that I am 100 positive of with\nhow many people I've worked with across\nwhat are we at 16 years now and all of\nthe things that I've seen is that most\npeople are are still as full on adults\nnot aware how to self-soothe how to calm\ndown their nervous system and so what\nhappens is because they were never\ntaught because their parents never\ntaught it to them because their parents\nparents never talked to them because\nit's never been a thing where people\nteach about\nbecause of the fact that they are not\ntaught how to self-soothe they search\nfor some external substance to help them\nsoothe\nI've done it before you ever done that\nbefore you search for something external\nto soothe you because we don't actually\nknow how to soothe ourselves\n100 true this happens all of the time I\nsee it over and over and over again so\nalthough a glass of wine although it may\nbe it might be amazing is the easy way\nif we're using it as basically an adult\npacifier\nright that's that's kind of what we use\nthem for sometimes now friends come over\nand you have a glass of wine a couple\nglasses of wine that's fine that's not\nthis I'm not talking about the same\nthing I'm not trying to demonize Wine\nI'm not trying because there is no right\nor wrong in this but what I'm trying to\nhelp you understand is that that is not\nhelping you improve it's the easy way\nout there's no growth from think about\nthis I have a stressful day I'm\ntriggered I come home and I drink a\nglass of wine that is the easy way there\nis no growth from that why is that\nbecause I will wake up tomorrow exactly\nthe same person as I was today I learned\nnothing from the stressful day I did not\ngrow and I did not personally learn to\nsoothe my nervous system as an adult and\nso this is why you can see adults that\ndon't know how to control their emotions\nthey don't know how to control\nthemselves when it comes down to you\nknow uh their stress they don't know how\nto control yourself with their anxiety\nwith their anger with their emotions\nwith their sadness they it they don't\nknow how to control it so it gets to a\nfever pitch sometimes and then it\nexplodes in some sort of way whether\nthat's anger yelling a fight crying\nemotions extreme stress all of those\nthings is because we're never actually\ntaught to self-soothe so instead of a\nglass of wine what would be better well\nit's not as sexy I'm gonna be honest\nwith you what about to tell you is not\nas sexy like a glass of wine ooh that's\nsexy sit down have a glass of wine to\nhang out it feels good and you're\nsoothed quite quickly\nwhat I'm going to tell you is not sexy\nbut it does eventually in the long run\nmake you able to self-soothe and less\ntriggered so instead of a glass of wine\nwhat would be better\nyou have a bunch of energy a bunch of\nstress coming up it's there's stress\nthere's stress in your body there's\nextra cortisol in your body one thing\nyou could do is you could go for a run\nyou could get out that extra energy so\nthat the energy doesn't sit inside of\nyour body\nthere's one really interesting thing\nthat happens and not enough people talk\nabout it if you watch animals for\ninstance on like the planes in Africa\nright a lion decides to go after a\ngazelle and the line goes after the\ngazelle and the gazelle gets away quite\neasily and quite quickly well what\nhappens is in order for the gazelle to\ntake off it's full on adrenaline it's\nfull on cortisol rushing through their\nbody and they get if it gets away pretty\neasily there's still a ton of cortisol\nand stress hormones inside of its body\nand so what it does is most animals have\na way to self-soothe they have a way to\nget rid of that cortisol so one of the\nthings that animals would do is they'll\ndo this shake they'll Shake really hard\nas a way to actually start to get rid of\nthe cortisol more my dog for instance\nwhen he gets really stressed out he does\nthese really stressful yawns it's built\ninto him and as adults we don't know how\nto self-soothe ourselves it's not built\ninto us the same way\nso maybe you go for an extra run to get\nrid of all that cortisol inside of your\nyour body if that's something that you\nwant to do go for a long walk maybe do a\n20 minute guided meditation to learn how\nto go from a stressful state to a calm\nand common-centered state maybe you\ndecide to do journaling and ask yourself\nwhy was it what I went through that was\ntriggering now these are not sexy they\nare harder a glass of wine is sexy it's\neasy but it doesn't change anything and\nyou don't learn anything from it you\nhave not grown at all from that process\nof having the glass of wine or whatever\nit is that you go to\nto quote unquote soothe yourself\nso that alone is what I want you to\nunderstand is not self-love it's not\ngoing to this thing to make you feel\nbetter what what is self-love that's\nwhat I want to dive into and really\nstart to talk about you guys I see\nself-love as yes the way that you speak\nto yourself yes the the way that you're\ngoing to act\num when you're when you're alone by\nyourself the\num things that you say inside of your\nhead of course the the journaling that\nall of those things are self-love\nbut the way that I see it is number one\nit's being kind to yourself yes of\ncourse but number two sometimes it is\ntough love\nsometimes it is really tough love when\nyou have when you when you love someone\nlike you have a really great friend for\ninstance like your best friend your job\nis not to just all of the time listen to\nthem vent that is a part of it you can\nallow them to vent but sometimes being a\nbest friend being a good friend means\ncalling somebody out on their\nit's a little bit of tough love\nsometimes I was having this conversation\nwith a friend of mine the other day and\nthey were talking about a friend of a\nfriend\nwho's going through a bunch of stuff and\ngoing through stuff with their\nrelationship and with all of these\nthings\nand\num the the friend of mine said I don't\nthink it's my place to tell her what I\nsee and I said maybe it is maybe it\nisn't but if you don't talk to her\nopenly about it who is going to openly\ntalk to her about it like who's the\nperson who's openly going to discuss and\nallow her to have that space sometimes\nbeing a best friend means giving tough\nlove it means calling somebody out on\nwhat's going on in their life and\nsometimes it means with self-love\ncalling out yourself when you're not\ndoing what you need to be doing\nsometimes I see self-love as the energy\nof like a tough Uncle like if you have a\ntough uncle or someone in your family\nwhere you highly respect them you know\nthat they love the hell out of you\nand you know that whatever they tell you\nthey're telling you from a great place\nbut he loves you but he's not going to\nput up with your BS right he's going to\ncall you out he's going to say hey you\nsaid you're going to do this now you're\nnot doing this what's going on with it\nand he's doing it because he wants to\nhelp you get back on track he loves you\nand wants the best fruit and he wants\nyou to live up to your potential\nright and you never question it because\nyou know he does love the hell out of\nyou that's the the best energy that I\nsee sometimes for self-love if you could\nbring that energy to yourself your your\ntough uncle is not going to be like hey\nyou suck get your together why\nhaven't you gone to the gym\nbut a lot of people talk to themselves\nthat way when they haven't gone to the\ngym so instead what's he going to do\nhe's going to say hey you said you were\ngoing to do this now you can continue on\nthis path if you don't if you want to\nyou can continue to live your life and\nhave XYZ happen and to not go to the gym\nwhen it was one of your things or to to\nnot take care of yourself the way that\nyou said you were going to you can\ncontinue on that path if you want to but\nI know you're better than that I know\nyou deserve more and I'm going to hold\nyou accountable to making sure that you\ndo it that is a form of love coming from\nyour uncle isn't it well you can take\nthat and also use that exact same energy\nfor yourself not talking down yourself\nnot yelling at yourself not guilting\nshaming yourself but holding yourself to\na level of hey this is something that I\nneed to do\nso self-love can look like talking to\nyourself positively and and and saying I\nlove you and you look great and I'm\nproud of you of course it's those things\nbut it's also self-love is going to the\ngym when you don't want to because you\nsaid you were going to do it\nself-love is waking up early and getting\nin your morning routine so that you can\nfill your cup and feel better about\nyourself and meditate and do your\njournaling and your reading and and have\ntime to yourself so that you can grow\nand be a better person going into your\nday\nit's not sleeping in\nstanding up because you said you're\ngoing to\nself-love can be reading when it's\neasier just to scroll on your phone\nself-love can be meditating after a\nreally long stressful day self-love is\nsaying no to the glass of wine\nsaying no is saying no to the the ice\ncream saying no to going out with your\nfriends when you know that you should be\npreparing for a really big test that's\ncoming around the corner whatever it is\nwhat I've come to find is self-love is\nhaving the discipline to do the things\nthat make you better\nself-love one of the aspects of\nself-love is having the discipline to do\nthe things that make you better\nright you don't need discipline to do\nthe easy things you don't need\ndiscipline to have a glass of wine you\ndon't need discipline to eat the ice\ncream you only just been asleep like\nI've never heard somebody be like oh my\ngosh I'm just I need to have so much\ndiscipline just to sit and watch Netflix\ntoday no it's easy we always tend to go\nfor the easy route it's easy like think\nabout how easy it is just to go to\nNetflix you just move your thumb for a\nsecond and it's on think about how easy\nit is to pour a glass of wine think\nabout it easy it is to get the ice cream\nout of the fridge all of those things\nare easy you don't need discipline AKA\nself-love because I think people think\nof discipline the wrong way they think\nyou discipline a dog when he does\nsomething wrong you discipline your\nchild whenever they hit each other\nwhatever it might be discipline is a\nform of self-love you need discipline to\ndo the things\nthat are harder but better for you\nyou don't need discipline for the easy\nthings that's very easy you don't need\ndiscipline to to watch Netflix you only\ndiscipline have the one you only\ndiscipline of the ice cream you only\ndiscipline to sleep in it takes\ndiscipline to say no sometimes it takes\ndiscipline to wake up sometimes but both\nof those are a form of self-love\ndiscipline is a form of self-love\nself-love is the discipline to do the\nthings that make you better\nand so you've got to start looking at it\nand saying you know what I'm not going\nto work out because I don't like my body\nI'm going to work out because I love\nmyself I Want More Energy I want to take\nbetter care of myself and I've put my\nbody through some over the years\nand I should at least love my body for\nwhat it's done for me that's self-love\nsometimes\ndiscipline is going you know what\nI've I'm episode 12 of this show I've\njust been scrolling watching it and\nwatching and watching and watching and\nwatching it\nand I should go to bed because I want to\nwake up early on my morning routine\nthat's a form of self-love that's also a\nform of discipline and so self-love\nis the talking great to yourself but\nit's also the discipline to do the\nthings that make you better and that's\nimportant for you to remember next time\nwhen you're up against the resistance of\nshould I do this should I not do this is\nit good for me is it going to make me\nbetter if the answer to both of those is\nyes\ndo it that's a form of self-love as\nbeing tough on yourself to do the things\nwhen especially when you don't want to\ndo them so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in at Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r I love looking through\nall
