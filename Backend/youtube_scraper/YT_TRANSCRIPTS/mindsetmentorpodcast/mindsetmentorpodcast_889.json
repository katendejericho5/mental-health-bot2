    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button since you never\nmiss another podcast episode today we're\ngoing to talk about how to get better\nevery single day and I'm not going to\ntalk about how to become exponentially\nbetter or how to wake up tomorrow and\nbecome be be 10 times richer than you\nare or wake up tomorrow and you're\nhaving the perfect body or the perfect\nrelationship or any of that stuff I'm\ngoing to talk about how to simply just\nfocus on being one percent better every\nsingle day that's it and we're going to\ntalk about the Journey of life that\nyou're on and what you're focusing on\nand what you're doing we're going to\ntalk about the Journey of\nself-improvement because I don't see\nself-improvement as something that you\njust do like a a diet where there's an\nend point to it I see it as a lifestyle\nyou know if you want to completely\nchange your body you don't just go on a\ndiet you change it and be the new\nhealthier version of you is your new\nhealthy lifestyle I see the Journey of\nself-improvement the exact same way\nI've lived my life since my very first\nMentor in 2006 under the impression of\nsomething called Kaizen Kaizen is a\nJapanese phrase for constant\nnever-ending Improvement and every\nsingle aspect of what I do I'm\nconstantly trying to grow and improve\nso it's a constant never-ending\nImprovement it's a journey of life it's\na lifestyle it's not something that you\njust decide that you want to do\nand the whole idea is I don't expect to\nwake up tomorrow and be like this\nsuper it's ripped 10 times richer\nversion of Rob I know that for me it's\njust about how did I show up for myself\nevery single day how did I show up today\ndo I feel like before my head hits the\npillow that I'm one percent better than\nI was when I woke up today\nbut I'm curious with you what do you\nthink when you went to bed last night do\nyou feel like you were one percent\nbetter or do you feel like you were the\nexact same person that woke up because\nif you're the exact same person when you\nwoke up nothing's going to change in\nyour life but if you're one percent\nbetter and you do that every single day\nfor the next year that's 365 better\nthat's 3.6 times better than you are\nright now simply by focusing on little\nteeny tiny things to get better every\nsingle day and the reason why this is\nimportant is because your current\ncircumstance in life the way that you\nlook the way that you feel the\nrelationships that you're in the uh\namount of money in your bank account the\nsuccess or lack of success in your\nbusiness all of those are just lagging\nresults of past habits traits behaviors\nand actions that's it\nresults don't come right away that's the\ninteresting thing about them so where\nyou are right now is based off of\ndecisions that you made in your past six\nmonths ago three months ago a year ago\ntwo years ago you don't get results\nright away most of the time it usually\ntakes time they lag\nso if you look at your life right now if\nyou don't like where you are\nI'm gonna give you a harsh reality you\nchose to be there\nif you don't like where you are right\nnow in your life you chose to be there\nwhether you realize it or not there was\na bunch of decisions that you made to\nallow yourself to be in the position\nthat you're in that's the beautiful\nthing about life is that no matter where\nyour life is you can always blame\nyourself for it if you look at your life\nand this is one of the very first things\nmy mentor actually in my very first\nMentor I don't remember anything else he\ntold me in two years I remember it was\nall really good but I remember one\nconversation where he literally said\nthat you have to become the CEO of your\nlife if you wake up one day and you're\n85 years old and you don't like where\nyour life is at it's your fault\nbut if you wake up at 85 years old and\nyou love where your life is at it's also\nyour fault\nwherever you are in life you chose to be\nthere and that can be something that's\nvery empowering but for some people it\ncan also be a really big smack in the\nface because your past decisions got you\nto where you currently are\ncan't blame anybody else you gotta stop\nblaming other people don't take any\nblame and put on anything external oh\nwell my mom was this way my dad was this\nway my dad was an alcoholic I was raised\nin this part of town my sister always\nused to tell me I was ugly you know I I\nwas raised with a bunch of poor people\nso I never knew what it looked like to\nbe rich and it's all of their fault it's\nthe government's fault it's the\npresident's fault it's the president\nbefore him's fault it's the president\nbefore the president before the\npresident's fault you can blame\neverybody if you want to but it's not\ngoing to change your circumstances\nyou've got to learn to take all of your\nblame and put it on yourself which for\nsome people can feel stressful but it\ncan also be extremely empowering because\nyou realize\nthat you're the only one that's going to\nchange your life\nthat's empowering so if you don't like\nwhere you are you chose to be there\nbased off the decisions that you've made\nin the past and your habits come from a\nstory that you are telling yourself\nabout yourself this is where it gets\ninteresting we're going to start talking\nabout your identity okay\nyour habits and actions that you take\ncome from the story that you're telling\nyourself about yourself so if you say\nstuff like I'm lazy I procrastinate I\nyou know being overweight runs in my\nfamily that's why I'm overweight I love\nto sleep in I'm always late I love food\ntoo much to lose weight if you tell\nyourself any of that that's the\nidentity that you have created for\nyourself and you are going to take the\nactions\nthat align with that identity so if you\nsay\noh my my family is all overweight so\nthat's you know I'm going to be\noverweight as well if you say that you\nhave now placed an identity on top of\nyourself my family is overweight I'm\ngoing to be overweight as well if I take\nthe identity of I'm going to be\noverweight because my family's\noverweight\nthen I'm going to take actions that line\nup without identity why the hell would I\never work out if I think to myself I'm\ngoing to be overweight no matter what I\ndo because if I'm gonna be overweight no\nmatter what I do why the hell would I go\nto the gym that doesn't sound fun I'm\nstill going to be overweight so I'm\ngoing to take actions not going to the\ngym that line up with my identity being\noverweight which is going to then make\nmy identity being overweight a reality I\nwill be overweight if I say to myself oh\nyeah you know I I love food too much\nit's just it's just a part of the way I\nwas raised it's my culture you know for\nus to to eat big meals together and all\nthat\nif that's your identity then you're\ngoing to eat more than you probably\nshould and you're going to have a hard\ntime breaking the habit of eating\nsomething that's bad for you or too much\nfor you into something that's healthy\nif you have the identity of that's just\nthe way I am I'm always going to be\noverweight why would you ever eat a\nsalad like if if I had the choice if\nsomeone came to me and said hey Rob\nI've got a salad right here and I've got\na pepperoni pizza right here which one\ndo you want pepperoni pizza is gonna win\nevery damn day why because it's so much\nfreaking better than salad you can all\nagree on that can't we so if I know that\nI'm going to be overweight no matter\nwhat I do why would I ever eat healthy\nwhy would you eat a salad when I can eat\npizza\nI'm gonna be that anyways right I'm\ngoing to be overweight because that's\njust my reality that's the results that\nI'm going to have so why don't I just do\nwhat I need to do I have created an\nidentity in my head\nI'm taking actions that line up with\nthat identity in my results from that\nidentity will create the identity that I\nhave\nwhich is still overweight and this goes\na lazy this goes with broke this goes\nwith\num\nI procrastinate too much this goes with\nI'm late all the time your actions and\nhabits will stem from what you believe\nabout yourself\nso if you want to become one percent\nbetter every single day guess what\nyou're going to have to do you're going\nto have to work on your mindset every\nsingle day your mindset is going to have\nto get one percent better every single\nday because your identity needs to shift\nyou're under no obligation to be who you\nwere five minutes ago that's what Alan\nWatts always says right if you want to\nbe a different person tomorrow you've\ngot to shift your belief in who you are\ntoday\nyou know if you think you're overweight\nyou're not going to work out if you\nthink you're going to be overweight no\nmatter what you're not going to eat\nhealthy\nyou're gonna be overweight anyways why\nwould you put your body through stress\nand eat something that doesn't taste as\ngood\nyou have to change your internal story\nin order to change your external results\nso you got to change your behaviors\nbut true Behavior change is actually a\nchange in identity that's what people\ndon't realize\nI heard a crazy statistic the other day\nfor people who lose weight at least 20\npounds do you know what percentage of\nthem\nkeep the weight off\nlet me let me ask it another another way\nout of people that a hundred percent of\npeople that go and they lose 20 pounds\nwhat percent of them do you think\nactually go back to that weight\nsay it out loud to yourself what do you\nthink it is\nI asked my videographer before she\nstarted she said 50 the number is 97\n97 of people\n97 of people\nthat lose at least 20 pounds gain it\nback in the next couple years\nthree percent of people keep it off\nthere's a lot of reasons why one of them\nhas to do with their identity another\nreally big reason why is who they\nsurround themselves with if you're you\nknow if you lose weight and then you\nhang out with a lot of other people who\nare overweight you'll more likely be\noverweight if you have one friend that's\nobese you have 57 percent higher chance\nof being obese if you have one friend\nthat's obese\nso if you start if you if you lose\nweight but all your friends are still\noverweight you're probably going to gain\nall the way back if you lose weight and\nyou start hanging out with people who\nare extremely fit you're probably going\nto be in that three percent they\ncontinue to keep the weight off it has\nto do with your community that you\nsurround yourself with it has to do with\nthe identity of the way you actually see\nyourself\nsame thing works if you think of\nsomeone who grows a successful business\nand they keep it and they continue to\ngrow and grow it and grow it versus\nrunning into the ground the person who\ngrows and grows and grows it usually is\nsomebody who is surrounding themselves\nwith other people who are growing their\nbusiness as well that's keeping them\nmotivated to go in that direction and a\nlot of it has to do with the community\nand the other bit of it has to go with\nobviously the identity that they have so\nchanging your behaviors true Behavior\nchange is actually a change in identity\nit's saying this is who I am that this\nis who I am will dictate the actions\nthat you take\nall of the time just the way that it\ngoes your bank account\njust so you know is a result of your\nspending and earning habits\nlet's make this as simple as possible\nwhen you look at your bank account if\nyou don't like your bank account and how\nmuch is in it your bank account is a\nresult of only two things how much you\nearn and how much you spend nothing else\nhow much you earn how much money comes\nin how much you spend how much money you\nlet it go out of it so if you want to\nchange your bank account you've either\ngot to earn more or you've got to spend\nless or both\nthat's it\nyour body is a result of your eating\nhabits your working out habits and how\nyou take care of yourself so if you want\nto change your body and make it better\nyou've either got to change the amount\nof working out that you do and the way\nyou work out or you've got to change the\nway that you eat or both\nthat's it your business is simply a\nresult of the hard work the dedication\nthe work habits and the commitment that\nyou have to your business\nthat's it it's very simple like you\ndon't have to people make life and\nhappiness and success so hard they\nstruggle their way to get there but when\nyou take a ten thousand foot View and\nyou go let's look at it from ten\nthousand feet you go\nyeah it's really not that hard if I want\nto lose weight I got to work out more I\ngot to eat healthier and I've gotta you\nknow if I want to lose weight I've got\nto be have a deficit in my calories I've\ngot to burn more calories than I consume\nthat's it there's nothing else if I want\nto make more money have more money in my\nbank account in my savings I've got to\neither make more money or spend less\nmoney or both that's it there's nothing\nelse that's to it and so you just make\nsimple habits around it but you've got\nto ask yourself what is your identity\naround that if my identity is I've been\nbroke my entire life my entire family is\nbroke we've always been poor we've\nalways struggled rich people have to\nscrew people over in order to make their\nmoney if that's the identity that I have\naround myself and around other people\nwho are rich then I'm going to have a\nreally hard time taking the action that\nI need to to become wealthy simply\nbecause\nmy identity is wrapped around this fake\nstory\nit's this narrative this story that\nwe're telling ourselves at all points in\ntime in James Clear has a quote that I\nlove and it's every action is a vote for\nthe person that you want to become\nwhether you realize you're doing it or\nnot every action is a vote for the\nperson that you want to become\nso\nhow are you voting are you voting to\nbecome the person that you want with the\nbody that you want with the bank account\nthat you want the relationship that you\nwant or are you voting and not realizing\nit for becoming the person that you\ndon't want to become not in the shape\nthat you want not with the relationship\nthat you want not with the bank account\nthat you want not with the business that\nyou want and it's little teeny tiny\nhabits that's why it's one percent\nbetter not 400 better tomorrow one\npercent better it's a little teeny tiny\nhabits like nobody nobody dies from\neating one hamburger\nthey don't\nthey don't have a heart attack from\neating one hamburger they have a heart\nattack from a bunch of decisions over 5\n10 15 20 30 40 years decisions little\ntiny decisions they accumulated over\nyears and years and they compounded to\nget them to a heart attack at 55 years\nold whatever it is no one gets fit from\none push-up\nno you guys know that\nit's a lot of work and time put into it\nand then one two three the years down\nthe road now they've got the body that\nthey want no one gets smart from Reading\none book no it's a bunch of reading\nbooks and having a dedication to\nknowledge having a dedication to the\nbody everyone having a dedication to the\nrelationship either one having a\ndedication to the bank account they want\nhaving a having a dedication to whatever\nit is that you want tiny habits make up\nwho you are what are your tiny habits if\nI were to follow you around I always ask\nthis I said if I were to follow you\naround all day every day with a pen and\npaper and write down every single thing\nthat you do\nwhat habits do you have that you'd be\nworried about me seeing\nwhat actions do you take or not take\nthat you would be like oh I don't\nwant Rob to see this think about that\nfor a second\nbecause those are the ones that have got\nto go those are ones you've got to get\nrid of are you the type of person to\nwake up on time are you the type of\nperson to hit the snooze button 17 times\nevery single day are you the type of\nperson to spend money are you the type\nof person to save it are you the type of\nperson to eat that unhealthy food are\nyou the type of person to say no to the\nunhealthy food and go for the food that\nyou know you should are you the type of\nperson that says oh I need a glass of\nwine every single night or you're the\ntype of person that says you know what\nI've come to realize that it's not good\nfor me to be able to drink every single\nnight so I'm gonna not drink every\nsingle night\nI saw a study not too long ago about\nwhat one glass of wine over the course\nof an entire week does to your brain\ncompound over 10 20 years and it\nliterally if the guy's name is Dr Eamonn\nif you want to go to him he's got a book\ncalled change Your Brain Change Your\nLife a-m-e-n Dr amen literally puts\nholes in your brain from having one\nalcoholic drink every single week\nholy right but if you look at\nsomeone's brain at 60 years old who\ndecided to drink a little bit and\nthey've got a brain that isn't complete\nwhen you look at the scan it's because\nof just decisions that they made\nthere's no right or wrong there's no\njudgment it's just simple you're going\nto get the results of your life based\noff of the decisions and the actions\nthat you take that's it there's nothing\nelse\nyou're going to get the results based\noffers decisions and actions that you\nhave in your life that's it\nthose things come from your identity and\nthat's what we're trying to shift every\nsingle day to become one percent better\nright we only see people who are\nsuccessful in their end result at the\nend\nbut we don't see the little teeny tiny\nthings that they did for 5 10 15 20\nyears to get there\nthe Journey of a Thousand Miles begins\nwith a single step and we start\nsomething brand new and we're excited to\nstart about something brand new and then\nwithin two weeks we're pissed off\nbecause we're not at Mile 1000 yet no\ndude you're at Mile you're literally\nstep 14 and you're pissed off that\nyou're not at Mile 1000 every single day\nis another step you got to know that the\njourney as long as you're on the right\npath as long as you're on the right path\nto get there and you're progressing\nthere every single day it's a win and\nyou've got to just know that eventually\ntime will get you to where you want to\nbe you can't be pissed off that you're\nnot where you want to be\nyou know two weeks into starting a brand\nnew business\nyou're not there yet it's not that it's\nnot time you can't you can't look on\nInstagram and see somebody who has a\nLamborghini or the body that you don't\nhave and be like oh yeah well they were\njust born with money or they were just\nblessed with that body no they\ntook action to make the money that they\nwanted to to get the Lamborghini or they\nworked out an ate in order to get that\nbody like just simply look at it stop\ngiving excuses to why you're not having\nthe body or the Lamborghini that they\nhave and simply realize they did actions\nthat got them that body or that\nLamborghini and if I take actions I can\nget that body or that Lamborghini as\nwell\nit's that simple don't compare yourself\nto other people and also don't compare\nyourself if you're week one in the gym\nto some woman who's been working out for\nfive years and be like well I'm not\nwhere she is you can't compare your\nchapter one to somebody else's chapter\n20. as long as you're on the journey and\ntrying to improve every single day and\nnoticing oh you know what well at least\nI'm working out four times a week now\nthree weeks ago I wasn't working out at\nall at least I've lost a pound in the\npast couple weeks at least I'm not\neating the food that I was eating you're\non the path to where you want to go\nthat's all that really matters it's the\npath of just changing yourself and\nbecoming a little bit better every\nsingle day you can't compare yourself to\nother people because some people have\nbeen on the path the same path that you\nare now on or starting to get on for a\nlot longer than you stop comparing your\nchapter one to somebody else's chapter\n20. stop shaming the other people and\nstop making excuses as to why you're\nthere there because they're blessed with\ncertain genetics and because they're\nblessed with being in a family that gave\nthem enough money to get a Lamborghini\nor whatever it is and go you know what\ngood for them they've gotten they're\njust a little bit further along in this\njourney than I am I'm going to be there\none day as well you know who do who do\nyou want to be in 10 years\nwhat do you want your actions to line up\nwith like what do you what actions you\nneed to take in order to line up without\nlife right do your actions right now\nline up with that future 10 years from\ntoday\ndo your current actions look like the\nhabits and the actions of the person\nthat you need to become\nbecause if they don't shift them move\nthem change them just a little bit it's\nnever what you need to do\nin order to get to the life that you\nwant it's who you need to become in\norder to make that life happen that's\nthe interesting thing about it is most\npeople think oh I need to do all these\nthings which I agree with but if I\nbecome the type of person who is healthy\nand I tell myself that I'm healthy and\nso I tell myself oh my entire family is\njust overweight that's what I'm going to\nbe but if I tell myself I am a healthy\nperson I will start to make healthier\ndecisions\nit's not about what you need to do in\norder to get the life that you need or\nyou want it's about who you need to\nbecome in order to get the life that you\nwant and if you become that person you\nwill simply start to do the things that\nthat type of person will do and you have\nto change a lot less about yourself than\nyou realize a whole lot less there's\nmaybe five or ten things that you really\nneed to change about yourself to have\nmassive changes in your life and I'm\ntalking about little tiny changes it's\nnot 50 different change it's not a\nhundred different changes you know it's\nlike wake up earlier have a morning\nroutine meditate a little bit read a\nlittle bit eat food that's good for you\nand realize that food is medicine stop\npoisoning your body\nstop procrastinating and just start\ntaking action stop making excuses as to\nwhy you're not where you want to be take\nfull ownership of your life work out\nthree four five times a week and stop\nwatching TV in the news and if you do\nmost of those things you're going to\nhave a pretty damn good life in about 10\nyears\nit's not a million things that you need\nto change it's just a few things\nthroughout your day it's just about\nbeing one percent better so it's not\nabout being a brand new person tomorrow\nit's about being one percent better when\nyou go to bed tonight than you were when\nyou woke up\nand you have to decide is this is this\njourney that I'm on is it a hobby is it\nsomething that I'm just trying out or is\nthis a lifestyle is this a lifestyle of\nme just trying to be better every single\nday and all you have to do and this what\nI want you to do an assignment I'm going\nto give you if you're listening this\nokay\nI want you to identify three to five\nsmall habits not massive habits three to\nfive small habits that you want to\nimplement and start implementing into\nyour day every single day and then once\nyou write those down and once you ask\nyourself how can I make taking action on\nthese easier and make a plan to make\nthese easier and eventually if you just\nkeep improving a little bit every single\nday you'll wake up a year from today and\nyou realize holy I'm in a much\nbetter place than I was\n12 months ago at this very moment so\nthat's what I
