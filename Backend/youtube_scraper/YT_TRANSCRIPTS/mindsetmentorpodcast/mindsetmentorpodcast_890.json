some actual good\nemails inside of your email go to Monday\nemail.com and it's absolutely free and\nI'll start sending some more stuff there\nas well today I'm going to talk about\nwhat I think is the most important\naspect of\nhitting your goals and it's interesting\nbecause it's the part that I actually\nnever hear anybody talk about I've been\ncoaching people for a very long time\nI've coached many different types of\npeople but there's one thing that I\nthink is the most important part of\nhitting goals and it's never talked\nabout people always say like hey write\nyour goals down you know make a plan all\nof those things all of those are great\nall of those are true but I think\nthere's something else that's behind\nthat I think this is the most overlooked\npart of hitting your goals and then I'm\ngoing to give you a tip\nthat I think is overlooked really\noverlooked in personal development but\nmy opinion is also the most important\npart and this deals with you know\ncreating the life that you want and I\nget it and I think the same way like the\nphrase creating your dream life or\ncreating the life you want it's it's so\ncorny but it is actually really true\nlike it feels like create your dream\nlife you can do it but it's also like\nyou can actually create your\ndream life dude like just get up and do\nit right so that's that would be the Rob\ndial way of saying you can create your\ndream life but\nlife comes down to you can either create\nthe life that you want or you can settle\nfor whatever you get you either create\nit\nor you actually go and get it and that's\nI'm sorry you create it and go and get\nit or you just take things as they are\nI don't know about you I'd rather create\nit versus just take things as they are\nbecause you never know what's going to\nhappen you never know it's gonna be\ncoming down the line if you're not the\none that's in control of it right the\nbeautiful thing about life is life is\nyour creation what you have now you have\ncreated this life you aren't just handed\nthis life or it's just you know well I\njust got this no you actually created it\nyou played a part the main character the\nmain part in creating the life that you\nhave so if you look around you and\nyou're like I don't like what I have\naround you well congratulations this is\nthe the result of what you have done in\nthe past and\nreally what it comes down to is stepping\ninto the driver's seat and actively\nstarting to work through that thing most\npeople are just creatively past\npassively creating the life and letting\nit happen to them this is not about\nletting it happen to them this is about\nmaking it happen and that's we're going\nto talk about today in that aspect of\nhitting your goals and what we're really\ngoing to do is is talk about something\nthat's very simple if you listen this\npodcast for a long time I like to take\nthings that are super complex and make\nthem super super simple I want to be\nable to teach so a four-year-old can\nunderstand me so how can we make this\nsimple\nyou are where you are right now oh\nlook at how simple it is all right you\nare where you are right now this is\nwhere you are if you're seeing me on\nYouTube or Instagram or Facebook or\nwhatever I have one my left hand up this\nis where you are right now\nvisually okay\nover here to the right and my right hand\nthis is where you want to be\nright there's where you are and there's\nwhere you want to be and there's a gap\nin between my two hands there's where\nyou are and there's where you want to be\nand there's a gap what is the gap that's\nwhat I want to talk about what is the\ngap between where you are and where you\nwant to be so let's talk about one year\nfrom now and let's talk about five years\nfrom now\nwhere do you want to be in five years if\nyou have a pen and paper this would be a\nreally good time I know I always get\ntags on Instagram of people who are\ngoing through and watching these videos\nand taking notes and stuff this would be\na really good time to start pausing me\nwriting on some notes all that stuff if\nyou're driving just think about this\nstuff think about it in your head where\ndo you want to be in five years\nwhere is it what's the dream life what\nis a full yes life for you like\nhell yes that's the life that I want\nthat what life gets you excited what\nlife gets you like yeah man if I could\ncreate that I would wake up in the\nmorning in that house with that spouse\nwith that family all those things to be\nlike yes this is perfect this is the\nlife that I created for myself\nwell what gives you energy when you\nthink about it one thing I always say if\nyou've been listening for a while\nfollow your energy\nfollow the energy that when you get\nenergy from something that's the\nuniverse's way of saying hey dude hey\nthis is what you need to be doing when\nyou feel something it's like this is\nexciting this gets me excited I want to\ndo this follow that energy so what is a\nfuture five years from now that feels\nenergetic that feels like a hell yes it\nfeels like man if I could have that life\nI would be so freaking excited follow\nyour energy follow that feeling of The\nAmazing Life from the amazing life that\nyou would have\nso\nif you're planning out something and\nyou're writing this stuff down as I'm\nspeaking to you which I hope that you\nare if you're writing things down and\nyou're like oh yeah this person this\nperson and it doesn't give you energy\nit's not for you it's not for you for\ninstance if you're in a relationship and\nyou think about that relationship five\nyears from today does it feel like a\nhell yes\nor are you like well I hope Stacy and I\nare doing good like if that is probably\na sign of maybe you should either change\nyour relationship in the Dynamics of\nrelationship or maybe you should just\ncompletely change the relationship to a\ndifferent relationship I don't know I'm\nnot in a relationship but I think that\nit you need to find something that needs\nto change in the relationship or outside\nof the relationship\nyou know do you feel like growing\nalongside that person gives you energy\noh my gosh I would be so excited to see\nwhere we are together in five years or\nis it like\nI hope we're still together in five\nyears\ndoes it make you excited to be in a\nrelationship with him in five years if\nso follow that energy if not\nif it doesn't give you energy that\nrelationship needs to change or the\nperson in it needs to change or you need\nto change and get out of that\nrelationship and find a new one whatever\nit is completely up to you same thing\nwith the job like if you're sitting\nthere and you're planning out you know\nthe oh yeah five years from now I'm\ngonna be still be maybe I'll be in\nmanagement in this company yay that'd be\nawesome\n that you don't want that that's the\nUniverse telling you that job is not for\nyou you know how say how do you make\nmoney fast forward five years how do you\nwant to be making money five years from\ntoday what job do you want do you want\nto be working the same place cool\nawesome how can you how can you become\nbetter at that and be promoted or do you\nlike this place sucks I want to start my\nown job okay what does that look like\nwhat gives you energy what type of\ncompany would give you energy and start\nmaking a plan towards that\nand you do this in your relationship you\njust in your job you do this in your\ncompany you do this with your employees\nif you have your own company with your\nfriends with your body with your health\nwith your children every aspect of it\nand then once you get really clear\non the next five five years and what\nthat could look like for you\nthink about the next 12 months\nthink about the next 12 months could\nlook like for you\nyou know if if you're listening to this\nand it's the beginning of the year what\ndoes this year look for like for you if\nyou listen to this it's the end of the\nyear what does next year look like for\nif it's the middle of the year what is\nthe next back half of this year in the\nbeginning of next year look like for you\nwhat does that look like what where\ncould you be 12 months from today that\nwould get you as like checkpoint one for\nthe next five years so if you know five\nyears from today you want to be at the\nplace that you just wrote down if each\nyear is a checkpoint checkpoint one you\ngot to go you can't get to checkpoint\ntwo or three until you get through one\ncheckpoint one you hit that checkpoint\ntwo you hit that checkpoint three hit\nthat checkpoint before you hit that what\nis the checkpoint 12 months from today\nthat would make sure that you're on the\nright path for five years from now where\ndo you need to be in that checkpoint\nand then what you do is you plan out\nyour job you plan out your relationship\nyou plan out your company your employees\nyour friends your health your body your\nchildren every aspect of your life that\nyou planned earlier\nand now you start to have a plan for it\ntogether\nwhere do you need to be 12 months from\ntoday to be on track for where you want\nto be five years from today\nnow\nremember I said I was going to talk\nabout the most important part well of\ncourse you need to know where you want\nto be that is important\nnow\njust as is important in the most\noverlooked part because people want to\nsay what do you need to do what's the\nplan all that stuff those are all\nimportant the most important part are\nyou ready for it\nis who you need to be to create that\nlife\nwho you need to be to create that life\npeople focus way too much on what they\nneed to do which is important you do\nneed to do things you can't just sit\nthere and be like hey in five years from\ntoday if I sit on this couch for five\nyears straight I'm going to have my\ndream life and I'm going to have the\nbody I want in the relation no you're\nnot going to have any of those things\nright\nthey're not going to\ntoo many people focus on what they need\nto do though it's more of who you need\nto be the most important aspect of it is\nwho you need to be\nwho is the person that can create that\nlife that you want\nso what I'm telling you right now with\nthat is that when you are the type of\nperson that creates the life that you\nwant you have to be the type of person\nthat is able to create that life so when\nyou look at your life right now and\neverything that's around you that life\nthat you currently have right now\nthat you have in this moment that you're\nsitting in you have created the maximum\nof what the person that you are at this\nmoment of your personal development can\ncreate one thing I always say just gives\nyou an idea if we compare your personal\ngrowth to your bank account your bank\naccount will never exceed your level of\npersonal growth\nyou will never make more money\nthan the person that you are is able to\nmake just as you will never have a\nbetter relationship than the person that\nyou are is able to create you'll never\nhave a better uh external world\nthan the person that you are is able to\ncreate\nand so you've got to think about that\nfor a second you'll never exceed\nwho you are your external world and what\nyou create will never exceed who you are\nso what you currently have right now is\nthe maximum of what you as you are right\nnow can create so if you want to create\nmore in your life you need to be more is\nthe key to it\nyou need to be more to create more let\nme show you what I mean when you look at\nyour one-year goals\nif you are the person that you are today\nwould you be able to have those\nprobably not be able to have that life\nbecause you would have already created\nit if it was possible so it shows you\nthat building yourself is more important\nthan building your life because when you\nbuild yourself the life that you want\nwill become the byproduct of the person\nthat you are and the person that you are\ntakes certain actions and those actions\nwill then become the life that you have\nyou will get results based off of the\nactions that you take I'll give you an\nexample based off of personal experience\nright\nI've been saying this for years and\nyears and the more I get older\nthe older and older and older the more\nthis becomes true\nI could not have the life I have now\nfive years ago because I was not the\ntype of person that could create this\nlife five years ago\nyou know I started my business about\nlet's let's just take the podcast when I\nstarted the podcast seven eight years\nago I could not have created the podcast\nthat I have now and be able to go out to\nhundreds of thousands of people when I\nstarted it all the way back in 2015\nunder 16. right under 15 going into 16.\nI could not have created\nwhat I have now back then I had to build\nmyself into the type of person that\ncould learn and grow and I know that\neven if I take my business like the\nbusiness that I want to have in five\nyears I personally right now cannot run\nthat business I am not able to but as I\ncontinue to build myself and build\nmyself and build myself and build myself\nI will be able to run that business\nfive years ago\nI definitely was not qualified to run\nthe business that I have now and it\nprobably would have ended horribly but\nnow I have built myself over the past\nfive years to be able to run this\nbusiness and so that's an example that I\nwant to give you is I was not the person\nwho was able to create the podcast or\nthe business that I have now five six\nseven eight years ago and I will not\ntoday I am not the person who is\nqualified and will not be good enough to\nrun the podcast and business that I will\nhave in five years six years seven years\neight years down the road because I have\nto grow and expand into that person I'm\nnot going to stay the same I'm going to\nchange I want to change and that's part\nof being a human is change\nyou have to build yourself and change\nyourself and build yourself and change\nyourself\none brick at a time\nBrick by Brick by Brick by Brick and if\nyou do that you'll be a completely\ndifferent person of yours if you just\nit's like Will Smith says if you just\nfocus on laying one brick at a time as\nperfectly as you possibly can eventually\nyou're going to have a perfectly built\nwall and if you look at your life as one\nbrick at a time you're going to be alive\nfor the amount of days that you're alive\nthe person that I am now\nnot qualified to do what I need to be\ndoing in five years the person that you\nare now is not qualified to run that\nlife\nthat you want to have in five years\nyou have to realize that there's a lot\nthat you need to change there's a lot\nthat I need to change if we want to grow\ninto the person we can be and it might\nseem daunting it might seem like a lot\nbut it's really not because you have to\ntake it day by day by day by day by day\nand a lot of people when they start to\nthink into the future they get to over\nthey're overwhelmed oh my gosh I get so\noverwhelmed when I think about the\nfuture no you don't get overwhelmed you\ncreate overwhelm based off of your\nthoughts a lot of people like to act\nlike they're a victim of overwhelming no\nyou're creating the overwhelm there's no\none overwhelming you you're overwhelming\nyourself all you can do is just focus on\ntoday and not even today like this\nmoment right now what do you need to do\nwhat is the best action for you to take\nright now to get you closer to your\none-year goals to get you to your five\nyear goals and if you do that like just\nask yourself that question 100 times a\nday what's the best action I could take\nright now to give me closer to my\none-year goals\nright now what's the best action I could\ntake is what I'm doing right now getting\ncloser to or further from our goals if\nyou keep asking yourself that question\nover and over and over again eventually\nyou'll get to what you want to be to\nwhere you want to be so when you look at\nthe person that you need to build\nyourself into what do they do on a daily\nbasis what habits do they have what\nstandards do they hold themselves to\nthese are all questions you want to ask\nyourself how do they talk to themselves\nhow do they talk to others how do they\nfollow through when people rely on them\nwhat does their morning routine look\nlike how do they take care of their body\nhow do they take care of their mind how\ndo they talk to other people around them\nwho do they hang out with and you start\nto get very clear on this person that\nyou need to be and if you become the\nperson that you need to become and you\nfocus on building that you will\nautomatically take the actions that need\nto be taken to create the life that they\nwant that you want and if you do this\nover and over and over again who do I\nneed to be what I need to do who do I\nneed to be what do I need to do who do I\nneed to be what do I need to do and you\njust do those things you become the\nperson you become you take the actions\nyou need to be taking you will wake up\nand you will be in the place that you\nhave on your piece of paper 12 months\nfrom today five years from today it is\nultimately going to happen\nwho you need to be what you need to do\nmost people focus on what you need to do\nbut I'm also really concerned on who you\nneed to be is what I'm doing right now\ngetting me closer to or further from my\ngoals am I building myself into the type\nof person that create the life that I\nwant to if you focus on that every\nsingle day\nI promise you\n'll become who you need to become and\nyou create the life that you need to\ncreate so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in at Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-jr and I'm Gonna Leave
