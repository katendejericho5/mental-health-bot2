    "transcript": "so how do you change your significant\nother this question that's asked me all\nof the time somebody will go on a\npersonal growth journey and their\nsignificant other doesn't go on that\nJourney with them and they start to grow\nand they want their significant other to\ngrow with them the worst thing that you\ncan do is try to force your significant\nother into doing what you want them to\ndo because when you force somebody that\nforce is usually met with resistance the\nonly thing that you can do to change\nsomebody is to change yourself as Gandhi\nsays Be the Change that you want to see\nin the world so whatever change you want\nto see in your significant other make\nthat change within yourself and you\nbecome the lighthouse versus a tobo the\nlighthouse and the towboat both get\nships from the sea into the harbor but\nthey do it way differently a topo pulls\nand pulls and pulls and uses all of its\naggression all of it's forced to be able\nto do so a lighthouse just stays where\nit is it does what it's supposed to do\nwith just shine and it allows them to\ncome in and so what you want to do is be\na reflection of what can happen when you\nfollow that path and so if you want your\nsignificant other to change"
