listening to it as\nwell so if you would do that I would\ngreatly greatly appreciate it today I'm\ngoing to teach you three keys to\nmastering your communication this might\nbe one of the most important skills that\nyou can learn to have a real lasting\nconnection with other people and to\nbuild up your communication skills and\nthe key part of it is love but it's not\nthe love that you're actually thinking\nand so you know we've all heard\ncommunication is a number one skill and\nkey to any relationship and I use the\nword skill on purpose is because\ncommunication is not something that\nyou're just born with\nI've never seen a baby that's\nimmediately speaking as soon as they\ncome out of the womb I don't know about\nyou guys it is a skill set to be able to\nspeak to be able to understand to be\nable to communicate effectively is a\nskill it is something that every single\nperson can improve it so if you're\nsitting there listening you're like well\nI'm just an introvert I'm just really\nshy yeah well me too I am but over years\nand years and years I've learned how to\nbe shy and how to be an introvert but\nalso be able to communicate effectively\nwhen I need to it is a skill set just\nlike if you want to learn how to play\nbasketball if you just keep showing up\nand doing the right things in basketball\nyou'll get better at it same thing with\ncommunication\nif you want to learn how to be a better\nCommunicator as long as you just show up\nand you continue to do the right things\nyou will improve at your communication\nand so\nyou know we've all heard that\ncommunication is the number one key to\nany relationship it's the key to your\nromantic relationships for sure one of\nthe biggest problems if not the biggest\nproblem in all romantic relationships is\nlack of communication as people just do\nnot communicate with each other they're\nnot communicating how they're feeling\ntheir spouse will do something and then\nthey'll just brush it under the rug and\nthen it builds up and it builds up and\nit builds up and it builds up and then\nthey forget forget to wash a fork and it\nturns into an absolute explosion right\nthe person's like I don't know I just\ndidn't do this they didn't put the fork\naway and it wasn't about the fork it was\nabout everything that happened before\nbut they don't know that because it\nwasn't communicated effectively to them\nthat's a piece of it is holding\nwithholding the communication that's a\nbig piece of it another big piece of\nthat communication as well might not be\nwithholding the communication it might\nbe just actually\nmaybe something happens and you just\nhave a trigger from when you were\nyounger and you just explode over one\nthing that happened right it's just it's\nit's these little nuances to start to\nfigure out how to improve the\ncommunication so it's the number one\npiece of relationships with romantic\nrelationships with friendships with your\nfamily with children that you do or will\neventually have\nif if any other human that is breathing\nif they can fog a cup what I'm going to\nteach you today will deepen your\nconnection and so really communication\nlike I said is a skill so what we're\ngoing to talk about is this skill of\ncommunicating\nand when you're listening and and\ntalking with somebody remembering this\nvery simple acronym which is l u v so\nwhen I said it's based in love not\nl-o-v-e-l-u-v is what we're going to\ntalk about and this comes from a PhD her\nname's Carol comfort\ncomp fur I think it's how you see it say\nit\nk-u-m-p-f-e-r and this is what it is l u\nv so the L stands for listen it's like\nthe the phrase you know the you know\nGod gave us two ears in one mouth for a\nreason because we're supposed to be\nlistening twice as much as we're talking\nright so that's a piece of it it's\nlistening without the need to feel like\nyou have to respond\none of the things that we can all agree\nof I'm sure\nis that sometimes we'll be in a\nconversation with somebody and you can\ntell when somebody is just waiting for\nyou to shut up because they have\nsomething that they want to say and we\nfeel bulldozed like there's bulldozers\nover in those those conversations right\nthe most value most valuable\nI guess you could say the most valuable\nthing that you can give somebody in a\nconversation is your silence\nhave you ever had a conversation with\nsomebody think about this I know I have\nyou have a conversation with somebody\nand they're just talking and you're\nbarely saying anything maybe asking a\ncouple questions you talk to him for a\nlittle while and then at the end they're\njust like they have energy and they're\nso much more excited they're like you\nknow what thank you so much this is a\ngreat conversation and you're like yeah\nof course and then they walk away and\nyou're like the hell I didn't even say\nanything like I barely even spoke but\nthat person\nthought it was an amazing conversation\nwhy because you just gave space for that\nhuman to express and one of the things\nthat I know is that very few people get\ntheir full expression of themselves out\nthe way that they should and so it's to\nlisten and to listen without judgment\nnow let's talk about that without\njudgment\nthis is really hard nowadays if there's\none thing that I've noticed over the\npast few years that people are just\njudging people for\nfreaking everything God knows what every\nsingle thing what they do what they say\nwhat they don't do what they believe\nwhat they don't believe they're what\nthey think about politics what they\ndon't think about politics every single\nthing\nand the idea\nis how can you listen without judgment\nyou could talk to somebody and they\ncould have a completely different view\nof the world\ncompletely different view of the world\nhow can you listen to them without\njudgment in I am of the belief that if I\nwould have been born in their shoes and\nhad every single second of my life be\nexactly the same way that theirs was who\nraised me every life experience the good\nthe bad the family all of those things\nif I were to have their exact same life\nexperience if they're 36 years old if I\nwere to be born as them and have every\nsingle life experience at every single\nsecond I believe that I would be the\nexact same person as them\nthere's nature and there's nurture and\nboth of those things make up the human\nthat is in front of you and so can you\nget better at listening without judgment\nand also can you get better at listening\nwithout feeling like you have to fix and\nas a guy\nand somebody who literally gets paid\nprofessionally to help coach people this\nis really hard for me and for most guys\nalso a lot of women this is really hard\nas well to listen to somebody who's\ngoing through things and listen and then\njust shut up that's really hard to do\ndon't try to fix we don't need a problem\nsolver but to literally just listening\nlisten to them listening is a skill\none of the things that really deepened\nmy listening practice was something what\nthat one of my very first mentors taught\nme\nand damn it it was really awkward the\nfirst few times that I did it and he\ngoes if you want to be a great\ncommunicator when somebody stops talking\ngo in your head One Mississippi to\nMississippi\nthree Mississippi and then now you have\nthe opportunity to respond and so what\nthat means is when someone stops talking\ndon't say anything for three seconds\ngive it a shot it's hard it's awkward\nbecause we're so used to just\nimmediately speaking over people and\nimmediately going but allow three\nseconds\nand how long can you go without\nresponding\nhere's the thing that I've realized once\nI started doing this\nsomebody will say something and then\nI'll just pause and it won't say\nanything for three seconds usually in\nthose three seconds they will start\nspeaking again and what's great about\nthem speaking again is now they usually\ngo deeper into what they were just\nsaying one of the things I think is a\ntragedy nowadays is that people have I\nhate surface level conversations and\nmany people\nour conversation is just service level\nservice level surface level\nand what happens is somebody will be\nspeaking to you speaking to you and it\ncan be service level service level\nservice level and you allow three\nseconds and then they start going deeper\nin those three seconds because you\ndidn't respond and now they're going\ndeeper than just surface level they're\nable to get below the surface because\nthey've had some space to be able to do\nso and you usually start to learn about\nthe person understand the person and get\nto know them even better and they feel\nunderstood\nthey feel heard which is why most people\nwho are just speaking mostly\nconversational like oh man that felt\ngreat it's because they feel heard and\npeople just want to feel hurt and they\nwant to feel understood so the first\npiece the L of Luv love is to listen get\nbetter as a listener and don't feel like\nyou always have to respond\nnumber two\nis understand\nas in two different categories number\none is verbal number two is non-verbal\nand men and women tend to communicate\ndifferently in a lot of different ways\nthis is this is a vast generalization\nbut in most cases people usually fit in\nthese categories right\nand uh I remember when I was younger uh\nI was about 20\nsee I was 23 24 years old and my manager\nof the company that I was in he was the\nnumber one developer of women in the\ncompany like he had more female managers\nthan anybody else he had more female\nmanagers than any other female manager\nhad he developed women really well and I\nasked him because I was like you know\nwhat is it what makes it different and\nhe said what I do is I started paying\nattention to the way that men\ncommunicate versus the way the women\ncommunicate and he said just over the\nnext month just watch women communicate\nwatch two women don't be no not this is\ndone in a creepy way but just if you see\nif you're at a coffee shop you see two\nwomen talking just watch them\ncommunicating and then look at two men\ncommunicating and see if you can tell\nwhat the difference is and when I\nstarted noticing was there's a vast\ndifference in the way that men most of\nthe time communicate and women\ncommunicate as well\nand there was actually a study that was\ndone in this years ago and they had\nthese these children they're about four\nor five years old and they were in a\nclassroom and they put you know it's\njust a normal classroom desks everything\nlike that and uh they had little boys\nand little girls and they were talking\nto each other and it was before class\nstarted and they did a story study over\nand over and over again\nand they had a big glass wall where they\ncould see in but the children couldn't\nsee that they were being watched and\nwhat they noticed is that little boys\ntend to sit in the their desk and face\nthe front of the room where the teacher\nwill be and they will sit shoulder to\nshoulder and be able to have a full\nconversation looking to the side looking\nto the front of the room looking to the\nside of each other looking in front of\nthe room but facing the same direction\nand they think that that comes back to\nwhen men used to be hunting and men\nwould go out and they would go hunting\ntogether is when you're hunting you\ndon't want to be necessarily always\nlooking the same direction but what you\nwant to be doing is both you guys have\nyour eyes looking you know different\nways if possible so\nI know when I've been hunting and I go\nout hunting with one of my friends we're\nusually back to back and that way I can\nsee 180 degrees they can see 180 degrees\nand we basically see everything that's\nthere we can have a full conversation\nnever looking at each other right what\nthey notice about little girls though is\nthat little girls almost always turn to\neach other in their desk and squared up\ntheir shoulders\nand so it's about understanding the way\nthat different people communicate and\nyou notice how they communicate and you\nstart to actually mimic the\ncommunication when you when I talk about\nunderstanding there's a lot of\nreflection back to somebody\nthere's a lot of you know head knots\nsquare up your shoulders and then give\nthem an idea that you're listening with\nuh-huh\nyes oh wow and you actually talk to them\nand as they're talking you just you know\nif you see me on camera right now as\nyou're you're talking you just nod your\nhead\nyou start to actually let them know that\nthat they're being heard oh wow yeah\nuh-huh those types of things are\nreflecting back making sure that you\nunderstand and reflect back to them\nrepeat back to them what they just said\nto let them know and let them show that\nyou're understanding that you're\nlistening and also sometimes when you\nreflect back somebody will go a little\nbit deeper and this is really an\nimportant part this is something that I\nwas bad at for a really long time is I\nwould just if you're watching on camera\nif you're watching on you know YouTube I\nwould just\nstare at somebody\nas they're talking to me and this is why\na lot of times like women will be like\nyou know you never listen to me and the\nguy's like what are you talking about I\nheard exactly what you said is there was\nno there was no non-verbal reflection\nback to them that you were listening and\nI was like oh my God now I'm starting to\nsee all the ways that I've screwed up my\ncommunication with girlfriends in the\npast right so the second part of it is\nto show them through verbal and\nnon-verbal communication that you are\nunderstanding that you are following\nalong with exactly what it is that\nthey're doing makes them feel once again\nunderstood people want to feel\nunderstood and then the last part of the\nV so it is listen it is understand the V\nis validate oh yeah I completely\nunderstand tell me more about that oh\nreally what what did you feel when that\nhappened oh yeah I see where you're\ncoming from\nit's to validate this person and their\nHuman Experience\nthat's to validate them and not feel\nlike you have to fix anything it makes a\nperson feel understood and it makes them\nfeel as if the conversation you know\nthey\nif you go into into a conversation with\nsomebody and they tell you something\nyou're trying to fix it or switch it or\nfix it or switch it or you know tell\nthem that they're wrong they're going to\nclose off but when somebody feels\nunderstood and validated they naturally\nopen up a little bit more and they feel\nlike they can express themselves more\nvalidate them ask them questions\nif you even if you know the answer to\nwhat you think their problem is ask them\nquestions and allow them to come up with\nit oh really she said that well what do\nyou think she was feeling well what do\nyou think you should do about it instead\nof just telling people what to do ask\nthem and allow them to come up to it and\nhelping really what this does it allows\nsomebody so many people don't Journal\nyou know I talk about journaling all the\ntime they don't Journal they don't talk\nabout their feelings they don't talk\nabout what's going on in their life and\nthey're they're kind of it's all in\ntheir head and because it's all in their\nhead it's really mushed up and so this\nallows us to be able to become really\ngreat communicators notice when I said\ncommunication I didn't say hey this is\nhow you become an expert communicator\nand this is the way that you talk and\nyou've got to hold your shoulders up\nstraight and you've got to be able to\nyou've got to be able to take your voice\nand project your voice when I talk about\ncommunication I'm not talking about\nstanding on stage I'm talking about a\nhuman to human connection and be able to\nhave somebody know that when you're\nsitting in front of them that they're\nfeeling understood\nif you have children try this with them\na lot of times what happens with parents\nis parents will try to fix their\nchildren quote unquote fix their\nchildren and a lot of times the child\njust wants to be understood so can you\nget better at listening understanding\nand validating your children even if you\ndon't agree with it can you see what\nhappens\nand then ask questions around it they'll\ncome up with the right answer eventually\nI believe that intuitively everybody has\nthe answers inside of them can we as\ncommunicators try to help them come up\nwith their answers that are intuitively\ncorrect for inside of them you know a\nlot of people their child does something\nwhy did you do that and then they yell\nat them it's like hey why did you do\nthat do you feel like that was the right\nthing to do what do you think would have\nbeen better to do how did it make you\nfeel when she said that in coming from a\nplace of compassion and understanding\nversus trying to fix\nbecause there's one thing that I do know\nfor each human every human just wants to\nfeel understood and so if we can Master\nthese three aspects the Luv the\nlistening the understanding the\nvalidation it makes other people around\nus feel like we're there to support them\nand the thing that I know is instead of\ntrying to fix somebody if we can be\nthere and they know that they have\nsomeone like us on their side to support\nthem they're more likely to step into\nwhatever is they need to do to make the\nchanges that they want to in their life\nand so that is the three pieces to being\na incredible Communicator so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please do me a favor\nshare this on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial
