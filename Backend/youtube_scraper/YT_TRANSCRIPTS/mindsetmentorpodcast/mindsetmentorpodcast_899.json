    "transcript": "so how do you stop comparing yourself\nwell the quote that I like to remember\nwhen I think about comparing myself is\nthat you can't compare your chapter ones\nto somebody else's chapter 20. so maybe\nyou're looking at somebody on Instagram\nand you're like oh my God they have the\nbest body I want that body and then you\nwork out for a couple weeks and then\nyour body does not look like their body\nbut a lot of times when you see someone\nwho has an incredible body that's like\nfive six seven years of work their\nchapter 20 is way further along than\nyour chapter one but you also have to\nrealize this person once started at\nchapter one as well and then work\nthrough every single chapter to get to\nwhere they are now so as long as you\nstart stop looking at other people and\nall you do is compare yourself to who\nyou were yesterday and try to be better\nthan you were yesterday you will see\nincremental improvements you fast\nforward that for years you're a\ncompletely different person"
