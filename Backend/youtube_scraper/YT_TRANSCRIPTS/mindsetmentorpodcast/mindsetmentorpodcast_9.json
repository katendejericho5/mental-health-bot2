    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to\novercome your fear of judgment and how\nto stop caring about other people's\nopinions let's dive in and I decided to\ndo this episode because I got a message\non Instagram and the question was\nsomething like how how do I deal with\nsomeone or how do I deal with someone\nthat says things that hurt me all the\ntime let's talk about it real quick I\nwant to give you guys as many tips I\npossibly can to how to not be offended\nhow to not feel judged how to not care\nwhat other people think about you um the\nfirst thing I'll say before I dive into\nit is what I would do is before you do\nanything else is to make a short list of\npeople whose opinions matter to you in\nthis list like mine is maybe three\npeople and if that person is not if\nsomebody judges you or they give you an\nopinion and they're not on your short\nlist just stop caring just push their\nthoughts away are they okay hold on this\nperson on Instagram just said XYZ let me\nare they on my short list they're not\nokay cool\nno big deal let me go ahead and just let\nit go so that's the first thing I'll say\nbefore I actually start giving you more\ntips um the first thing I'll say around\nit though as far as like actual tips\njust stop hanging out with people who\ntalk down to you you know stop hanging\nout with people who don't want the best\nfor you who cut you down who who find\nholes in all of your success who give\nyou those little you know I've heard\nthem called negs those little negs are\njust like the little negative comments\nwhere it's like death by a Thousand Cuts\nLike just stop hanging out with those\npeople and your life will automatically\nstart to get better uh the second thing\nthat I'll say around this when we think\nabout being judged or other people's\nopinions or being hurt by other people's\nopinions or or judgments is no one can\nhurt you with words that you don't\nalready believe and this is going to\nsting for some of you guys think about\nthis for a second no one can hurt you\nwith words that you don't already\nbelieve there are many things that I\ncould come up and say to you and it\nwouldn't offend you at\nall wouldn't care not a big deal but\nthen there's something I could come up\nand say to you and it would offend you\nthat shows you what you already think of\nyourself and so it's not that you're\nworried about other people's lack of\nacceptance of you it's actually your\nlack of acceptance for yourself whatever\nyou are searching for in the external\nworld is actually what you're searching\nfor from yourself if you're searching\nfor more acceptance and love from the\nexternal world you're actually searching\nfrom Love and acceptance of yourself and\nthat's why self-belief is such an\nimportant thing self-confidence is such\nan important thing which I'll cover\nlater on in this episode you know and i'\nI've given this example hundreds of\ntimes in the podcast but it's just so\ngood and it makes so much sense it just\ntends to click in people's heads but one\nof my friends was talking to me about\nhow um he was with his mentor and he was\nin his early 20s and he was doing\nmillions of dollars a year in his\nbusiness and he was with his mentor who\nwas in his 40s they were going on a walk\nand he was like hey Ryan like tell me\nabout your business everything seems to\nbe going great tell me about it and my\nfriend Ryan was like you know what man\nlike\nI just I'm not enjoying it he's like\nwhat do you mean you're making millions\nof dollars a year and he's like every\ntime I get a an email from somebody to\ncustomer service talking about they hate\nmy product or it's a bad review he's\nlike I just want to shut it all down and\nhis mentor is like yeah it's because uh\nbecause you're insecure and he's like\nwhat are you talking about I'm not I'm\nnot insecure I'm talking about my\nbusiness he goes yeah you're insecure\nand it's showing up in your business\nthat's why you're triggered he goes I'll\ngive you an example if a lady came up to\nyou on the street right now and she's\nlike hey Ryan you have pink hair what\nwould you think he's like I really\nwouldn't think anything of it and he\ngoes why not he goes cuz I don't have\npink hair he goes right you wouldn't be\ntriggered by something that you don't\nfeel is already true and so anytime\nsomebody says they don't like your\nproduct or there something that that\nspeaks down about your company you don't\nhave enough self-confidence to actually\nnot care about what they say because\nthey're showing you your insufficiencies\nthat you feel that you already have that\nexist and it's like Elanor Roosevelt\nsays no one can make you feel in without\nyour\nconsent you know I don't like your hair\nno big deal okay fine I don't like the\ncolor of your car okay fine I don't like\nyour voice okay fine but then somebody\nsays something that you have an in\ninsecurity about boom that's when it\nhurts that's when you get angry that's\nwhen you get emotional that's when you\nget sad that's when you blow up whatever\nit might be no one can say something\nthat hurts you unless you already\nbelieve it to be\ntrue and so that's why it's so important\nfor us to work on ourselves to make sure\nthat our our mental health is in such a\ngood place that our self-love that our\nself-acceptance is in such a good place\nas pissed off or hurt as you might be\nwhen someone comes up and triggers you\nin some sort of way whether it's your\nspouse whether it's your children\nwhether it's your mom your dad whatever\nit might be that person is giving you a\ngift they it is it is the universe\ncoming through them to you to show you\nwhere you are not free they are showing\nyou where you are hung up in your mind\nthey are showing you where you still\nneed to work on yourself\nthey're showing you where you're not\nfree and you have to realize life for\nall hopefully 90 a 100 years that all of\nus listening to this podcast are going\nto get hopefully we all get a 100 years\nright life until we die is just a\nconstant upleveling it's just constant\ngrowth and you know physically our\nbodies might start to deteriorate over\ntime but mentally we can still in in our\nself acceptance and self-love and and\nour personal development our Spiritual\nDevelopment emotional development we\nshould always be striving to uplevel\noursel to grow and the growth never\nstops you know there's never a point and\nI don't expect and for years in the\nbeginning of my self-development journey\nit was it was almost as if I was working\nto get to a destination like man I can't\nwait till I get there because then\neverything's going to be perfect I can't\nwait till I make this amount of money\nand have this amount of money in my bank\naccount because then everything will be\nperfect I can't wait until I get in a\nrelationship because then my life is\ngoing to be whole no matter what happens\nthere is no\ndestination hey real quick I want to\nintroduce you to something called\nmindset Mentor plus if you love this\npodcast you will absolutely love what\nI'm about to talk about I designed\nmindset Mentor plus to help you actively\nintegrate every one of these episodes\ninto your life and here's how it works\nwith every episode of

than\njust this podcast they also come with\njournaling questions challenges\nassignments and so much more so that\nyou're not just listening to these\npodcasts passively but you're actively\nintegrating them into your life that way\nyou improve much faster I also do\nmonthly Q&A sessions in there and much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription there's no place that you\nget to where you don't have any flaws\nthere's no place that you get to where\nyou don't have any baggage where you\ndon't have any triggers you're where\nyou're never completely not offended\nwhere you have no temper where you have\nno emotion perfectly calm at all times\nand you know even in the middle of a\ntornado you'll probably never get there\nI'll probably never get there but what\nI'm trying to do is I'm constantly\ntrying to just get a little bit better\ncan I just get a tiny bit better just\none step forward in my life today and\nthis is the reason why self-belief is so\nimportant if you believe in yourself it\ndoesn't matter what any anyone says to\nyou because you don't need them to\nbelieve in\nyou at this point what a lot of us are\ndoing is like I said we're what we're\nsearching for the from the external\nworld is what we're actually searching\nfor from\nourself if you need somebody you feel\nyou need people to show you and reflect\nback to you that you're good enough that\nyou're smart enough that you're pretty\nenough it's because you don't think that\nyou're good enough or you're smart\nenough or you're pretty enough you don't\nfeel whole within yourself and so you're\ntrying to have other people f a void\nthat they can't fill within you the only\none that can fill that is yourself and\nthis is why working on your own\nself-belief is so important so then the\nnatural question is how do I believe in\nmyself more you have to push yourself to\ndo something you don't want to do or you\nhave to do something uncomfortable every\nsingle day and you have to do something\nthat's a little bit out of your comfort\nzone and you need to get yourself to go\nto the gym when you don't want to and\nyou're a little bit too tired you need\nto sit down and read when you didn't\nwant to read or sit down meditate when\nyour anxiety is going crazy you just do\nsomething that just makes you a little\nbit better it's like uh my one of my\nvery first mentors used to always say\nyou're either green and growing or brown\nand dying and so I've always just been\nthinking in my head how can I just get a\nlittle bit better I don't need to push\nmyself and get a million times better\ntoday but just a tiny bit better so that\nwhen I hit my head hits the bed and I go\nto sleep I'm just like I did a good job\ntoday I'm getting a little bit better\nand you start to gain confidence you\nknow and I I think it's really important\nI say this all the time on the podcast\nconf confidence doesn't come only From\nSuccess it also comes from doing\nsomething that you didn't want to do by\nby whether you succeed or whether you\nfail the important thing is that you saw\nyourself show up for yourself that\nbuilds confidence that builds trust\nwithin yourself when you say you're\ngoing to do something and you don't do\nit you're losing trust within yourself\nand this is why it's so important for\nyou to show up for your I see so many\npeople that will do everything for\neverybody else but they don't do\nfor themselves they will put themselves\nat the bottom of a totem pole you have\nto put yourself at the top of the totem\npole because if you're better everyone\nin your life is affected by you being\nbetter your children your spouse your\nfamily your co-workers your\nemployees so you have to show up for\nyourself way more than you'll show up\nfor anybody else it's not being selfish\nit's about doing something for yourself\nknowing that when you're better\neverybody else is better you know you\nsay oh I'm going to go for a run and you\ndon't go for go for for a run I'm going\nto wake up early and don't wake up early\nyou say you're going to go on a diet and\nyou don't go on a\ndiet there's when you don't show up for\nyourself you're seeing that when you\nshow up for yourself you're seeing that\nand so if you can make sure that you\ncontinue to keep showing up for yourself\nyou will gain more confidence and the\nmore confidence you gain yourself the\nmore trust you gain yourself the more\ntrust you gain yourself the more that\nyou don't need anybody else to fill a\nvoid within your soul and you search for\nthem for your validation you know\nthere's a study was it's called that\nself-efficacy Theory and it's by Albert\nBandera and the study that they did on\npeople found that uh it it was basically\non individual's belief and their ability\nto succeed and so do I believe that I\ncan succeed in in accomplished tasks and\nwhat they found was that one of the\nprimary ways to build selfefficacy\nconfidence within yourself is through\nsituations where an individual faces a\nchallenge doesn't matter if they succeed\nor fail but they face The Challenge and\nthat alone builds self-confidence\nand so overcoming obstacles and\nachieving goals especially when they're\nchallenging can significantly increase\nyour confidence in your\nabilities the other thing that's really\nimportant is to choose your circle\nwisely the people that you surround\nyourself with they should they should\nmotivate you to be better but also they\nshould show you in their own actions how\nto be better you know you're the average\nof The Five People You spend the most\ntime with if the people around you don't\nwant the best for you if they find\nfaults in your success\nthey try to make you play small and they\nmake negative little subtle negative\ncomments you know if they're if they're\nthe type of person who you win the\nlottery and they're like oh\ncongratulations GH do you know how much\nyou're going to have to pay in taxes\nlike just enough let them go find a new\nCircle there was a a study that was done\nthat was called the framington heart\nFramingham heart study and um the\nstudy's been going on since 1948 and in\n200 7 researchers analyzed all the data\nthat they had of this study and so\nyou're basically talking almost 60 years\nof data at this point and they found\nthat various behaviors and traits\nincluding your happiness including\nobesity including smoking habits spread\nthroughout social networks like a\nvirus you actually become who you\nsurround yourself with they found that\nif a close friend of yours becomes obese\nyour chances of becoming obese increase\nby 57%\nwhich shows that our Social Circles\nsignificantly signif good God can I get\nthis word out significantly influence\nour behaviors and also our habits as\nwell there was another study that was\ndone on depression it was called the\nrosenquist study and they found that uh\nand they were trying to figure out about\nhappiness and depression and if it\nspreads like a virus throughout social\nnetworks in research that they found was\nhaving a friend who becomes depressed\nincreases your chance of depression on\nthe other side of that having friends\nwho are happy and are not depressed and\nfeel like they have great life increases\nyour chances of being happier so you\nknow if if you have people who are sad\nand depressed and they aren't\nchallenging you and they don't want\nbetter and maybe have a fixed mindset\nmaybe it's maybe it's time for you to\njust see if there's other people out\nthere that you could hang out with you\nknow another thing that I'll say around\nthat is as you start looking at other\npeople's opinions and other people's\njudgments\nit's really important of course like I\nsaid to have a short list of people who\nyou trust but also when you take\nsomebody's advice if you decide to take\nsomebody's advice look at it and say\nwould I trade places with this\nperson based off of the advice that\nthey're giving me and so you know if if\nyou're sitting with somebody and they're\ntelling you uh marriage advice and you\nknow they've just had terrible\nrelationships their entire life you're\nprobably not going to take take advice\nfrom them if you sit with somebody and\nthey are broke as a joke and they're\ntrying to give you money advice you\nprobably shouldn't take advice from them\nlike I'll give you a great example I\nlove my mom she's a great woman but I\nwould never take advice for her on from\nher on how to grow my Instagram why my\nmom doesn't even have an Instagram that\ndoesn't make any sense but how many\npeople are out there and they want to\nstart a business and I heard this hear\nthis all the time I want to start a\nbusiness but my mom thinks it's a\nterrible\nidea and I'm like how many businesses\ndoes your mom run\nzero well she's probably not the best\nperson to take advice from around a\nbusiness maybe you should talk to\nsomebody who's successful in their\nbusiness you know so if your mom or dad\nis saying no you shouldn't start a\nbusiness no you shouldn't start a\nbusiness and they've never had a\nbusiness or they've never run a\nsuccessful business they're probably not\nthe best person to take advice from you\nknow would you rather take advice from\nsomeone on how to be a millionaire from\nsomeone who's never been a millionaire\nor someone who's a multi-millionaire\nprobably the person that's a\nmulti-millionaire people love to give\nadvice people love to give their advice\nthey love to give their opinions\nespecially online just stay out of the\ncomment section right they love to give\ntheir opinions they love to give advice\nbut just because they're giving it\ndoesn't mean that you need to take it\nand so I recommend having a short list\nof who you actually care about and trust\nand you know they want the best for you\nand those are people that you're going\nto take advice from and then also when\nyou are trying to have your own\ndiscretion of do I take advice from this\nperson or do I not from this thing that\nthey're giving me advice from what I\nwant to trade place with them business\nadvice are they running successful\nbusiness relationship advice do they\nhave successful relationship money\nadvice are they good with their money\nall of those things just start to think\nabout who you're taking advice from but\nat the core of it the thing that really\nmatters the most is that if you're\nsearching for other people to validate\nyou and that's why you're so afraid of\nother people's opinions or other\npeople's judgment what you really want\nis self validation and that's the thing\nthat you need to work on with the advice\nthat I gave just a little while ago so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a massive favor I want this\npodcast to continue to grow continue to\nimpact more people's lives if you've\never gotten any impact from this podcast\nplease share it with other people
