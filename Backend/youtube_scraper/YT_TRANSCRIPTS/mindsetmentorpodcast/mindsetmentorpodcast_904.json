every Monday I will\nsend you an email with tips and tricks\non how to improve your mindset and some\nof the stuff that I'm doing in my life\nto improve myself I'm gonna give you\nsome of that so you can start to use it\nas well so once again it's absolutely\nfree it is Monday email.com today we're\ngoing to be talking about where most\nhumans suffering comes from now let me\ntalk about suffering and let me talk\nabout pain real quick before we dive\ninto this pain is inevitable suffering\nis optional so when I say human\nsuffering a lot of people think like oh\nthe people are suffering\nthat are in other countries or people\nthat are going through terrible trauma\nand all that stuff that's not what I\nmean when I say suffering pain it like\nI'll give you a quick example just to\nmake it more sense give you a little\nmore context right pain would be\nsomebody cheating on you suffering is\nwaking up and thinking about that every\nsingle day the pain happened that is\ninevitable you're going to have pain in\nyour life the suffering though is\noptional there's some people that are\nstill suffering 10 years later from\nsomebody that cheated on them 10 years\nago and thinking that they're not good\nenough 10 years down the road and so\nwhen I say suffering that's what I mean\nand we're going to talk about the path\nof a human in the path of growth as a\nhuman and um first we start off being a\nchild right\nand if you think about about children\nlike I have a lot of children that are\nin my family I grew up and you know when\nI go to Christmas we have 40 45 of us\nthat are back home but when I was a kid\nthere were always children around always\nyou know we were raised Roman Catholics\nso we reproduced like bunnies and so uh\nthose you guys that are Irish Catholic\nall know that uh Irish Catholic not\nRoman Catholic so\nwhen you think about this though you\nthink about being a child Ian if you\never see a child children are just free\nthey're just their truest selves aren't\nthey like they can get naked in the\nmiddle of a Target and they don't give a\ndamn what you think about them they\ndon't care they're just free they're\njust their truest selves\nand that's the way we come into this\nRule and then at some point in time we\nare\ntaught how to fit in with Society taught\nhow to fit in with our family we are\ndomesticated I guess you could say right\nand through the domestication process we\nlose our true selves and so you might be\ntoo loud while you're at the grocery\nstore and your parents yell at you you\nknow the other day I was at uh I was at\na restaurant with Dean and his family\nand his little two-year-old I think he\njust turned three just decides in the\nmiddle of a restaurant nice restaurant\njust to scream like out of nowhere it\ndidn't it came from nowhere and we were\nlike what the hell just happened right\nthat's just a child that's what they do\nand they don't care what anybody thinks\nin their entire restaurant and so we're\nall like you got to be quiet\nso we're telling him not to be as true\nas soft it's hard it's hard to do this\nto domesticate I'm going to keep using\nthat word intentionally domesticate a\nchild into fitting in with Society\nand also be like well how do I not how\ndo I not squash their freedom of\nexpression right and so then as a child\nyou're running around in public and\nyou're in the grocery store and you're\nyou have all of this energy and you're\ngoing crazy and you be you're yelled at\nso that you stop running right and the\naverage child because I get it parents\nhave to reprimand their children to keep\nthem alive a lot of times a lot of times\nthey get reprimanded just because uh the\nparent doesn't want to have to deal with\nit but the average child statistically\nis reprimanded eight times more than\ntheir praised\nlet me say this again for people that\nare parents or people that want to be\nparents or people that are grandparents\nall of us\nthe average child is reprimanded eight\ntimes more than they're praised which\nmeans that they are told that their\ntruest self if we're really taking a\nstep back their truest self is not\nacceptable in this moment right they\nthink that they are not enough eight\ntimes more than they think that they're\nenough\nwhy is it that everybody has some sort\nof Paradigm of I'm not enough\nwell that's why is because we have to be\nquote unquote domesticated and fit in\nwith Society it's societal pressures to\nmake sure that the children fit in and\nthat they act a certain way and they act\ncertain way when they go to school and\nwhat happens over time\nis it we as humans now as adults\nlistening to this we have abandoned our\ntruest self at some point in time we\nlearn that our true self does not fit in\nwith society and so the best way to talk\nabout this and give you this this this\nidea of why we suffer and how to get\nfree from suffering is from a Danish\nTheologian and philosopher his name is\nSoren\nI'm going to try to pronounce this but\nI'm gonna screw it up quirky guard I\nthink is how you say it uh he was around\nin like the 1800s and the best way of\nthinking of this is this is what tends\nto happen with people and this happens I\nsee this happening people all the time\nwhen they go on a personal development\nJourneys they go on a personal\ndevelopment Journey and as they start to\nwork on themselves they realize that\nthey're parts of themselves that they\ndon't like that they want to get rid of\nand they start to think that they're\nworse than normal\nand they want to fix these things just\nso they can feel normal and so the\nbiggest problem from the top if you can\nimagine like we're going to work from\nthe top of a page down right the biggest\nproblem is that usually it starts at\nsome point in time with I wish to be\nother than I am to have a different self\nand this is the first thing he discovers\nthat almost everybody at some point in\ntime in their life thinks himself I want\nto be different than I am\nright we've all been there I've been\nthere many times have you ever been\nthere before I want to be different than\nI am\nbetter\nricher whatever it might be right\nI want to be different than I am I want\nto be a different self and so right\nunder that it flows into so I try to\nmake myself into someone different what\nwe do is we tend to abandon our truest\nselves and try to make ourselves into\nsomebody different\ninto somebody that we are not so that we\ncan fit in so that we can succeed so\nthat we can be perceived that we want\nthe way that we want to be perceived\nwhatever it is\nthe first piece of it is I want to be\ndifferent than I am\nto have a different self\nso I tried to make myself into someone\ndifferent and as you try to make\nyourself into someone different there's\ntwo ways that it could Branch off\neither number one\nI fail\nand I hate myself in some sort of way\nbecause I failed and I am still the the\nperson that I was but now I still want\nto change so that's one side is that I\nfail and the other side is that I\nsucceed in changing myself and I abandon\nmy truest nature so let's dive into each\nof those right I fail at becoming\nsomebody else and I despise myself for\nit oh my God I I want to change I want\nto be different I don't have the\nmotivation I don't have this this this\nthis\nand it comes from I want to be somebody\ndifferent and so I'm trying to change\nmyself into someone different and I\ndespise myself for failing and I fail\nand I despise myself for not being who I\nwant to be which is somebody different\nright\nfollowing me now on the other side of\nthat is that I succeed at becoming quote\nunquote and quote unquote becoming\nsomebody different I abandon my true\nself and I succeed at becoming somebody\ndifferent and I become somebody\ncompletely different than who I am at my\ntruest self I Lose Myself my true self\nand the character that I have to play\nyou know and it always brings me back to\nthe spiritual awakening that Eckhart\nTolle talks about in The Power of Now\nwhere he was depressed and he was\nthinking of committing suicide\nand he had this this Awakening when he\nsaid to himself I can no longer live\nwith myself right so let's look at that\nphrase I can no longer live with myself\nso there there is the I that is the true\nself that we're speaking about and can\nno longer live with myself which is the\nself that we have built ourselves into\nwhen we become somebody who is not our\ntruest self and so he realized he didn't\nneed to commit suicide and this isn't a\nwhole thing about suicide or diving into\nit there's a lot of people that go\nthrough mental struggles and all this\nstuff I'm just talking specifically\nabout Eric tolly\nthe I can no longer live with myself he\nrealized he didn't need to kill himself\nhe needed to change the self and go back\nto his truest nature which was the I\nwhich is the true self right\nso either way whether I fail at becoming\nwho I want to be and changing myself\nfrom my truest self either that is is\none side or the other side of the coin\nis that I actually succeed and I lose my\ntrue self either way I'm losing my true\nself and what happens is I get so far\naway from who I truly am I don't know\nwho I am anymore and I don't know about\nyou I found myself here a few times in\nmy life where I don't know who the [ __ ]\nI am and I'm like I I don't know I'm\nlost and it's like a dark night of the\nsoul of like who am I what am I what if\nI built myself into you know there's a\nlot of very successful people\nthat becomes successful and then either\nbecome depressed or they commit suicide\nor whatever it is it might be and a lot\nof times it's because they have to\nabandon let me say that again they think\nthat they have to abandon their true\nself in order to get to the Mountaintop\nthe top of the mountain and they get to\nthe top of the mountain and they realize\nthat it didn't do anything for them they\ndon't feel any different right I\nremember thinking to myself like oh when\nI am super successful when I become a\nmillionaire then everything will be fine\nand then I got to the quote unquote top\nof the Mountaintop and I was like I\ndon't feel any different like money did\nnot solve anything the only problems\nthat money solves are money problems\nnothing else everything else is exactly\nthe same and so either way we lose\nourselves we have to lose our true\nselves in order to\nsome point in time get in here and and\nstart to figure out who we are who are\nnot all that stuff I do think that it is\nthe natural flow and uh of a human soul\nis to have to go through all of this\nstuff because you have to Lose Yourself\nto find yourself just my belief I've\nheard that from a lot of other people as\nwell but you can you know take that if\nyou like but maybe you know people think\nto themselves well maybe I have to make\nmyself so tough\nbecause the world is so tough and if I\nif I'm not tough the world will beat me\nup and we we have to become this real\ntough like a lot of men feel like we\nhave to I felt this way had to become\nreally tough and really hardcore and you\nknow I would have to be brushed with my\nwords and cut you first so that you\ndidn't cut me and I had to put up a wall\nand not let you in but then really deep\ndown inside\nall of us are just soft emotional beings\nthat just want love that's it and so\nthen what happens is we realize whether\nit is the the path of failing of\nbecoming who we want to be but we still\nhate ourselves and we want to change\nourselves or succeeding at changing\nourselves either way both of them flow\ninto\nI lose my true self\nI'm so deep into the hole I'm so deep\ninto wanting to change myself I'm so\ndeep into wanting to things to be\ndifferent that I actually lose myself in\nthe process my truest self and as I said\nearlier most people do not know who they\nare and it can be scary and it's not a\nfun road to go down but I think that\nwhen you go through that Dark Night of\nthe Soul\nyou start to realize what you do want\nwhat you don't want who you are who\nyou're not you start to kind of piece it\nall together and go back to who you were\nso\nwe think you know and going back to\nbeing successful and getting to the top\nof the Mountaintop and realizing nothing\nchanges a lot of people think that by\nbuying the house it'll make us feel\nbetter but nothing changes by buying the\ncar it'll make us feel better but\nnothing changes by buying the clothes\nyou know if we're gonna be so much\nbetter\nand then nothing changes having a\nmillion dollars in the bank account and\nthen nothing changes you still feel\nexactly the same\nand then you start to realize As You\nLose Yourself completely which is the\npath that you're going to go through if\nyou're trying to lose if you're trying\nto get rid of yourself and you fail or\nyou do abandon yourself and you do\nsucceed quote unquote succeed at that\neither way you lose your true self\nand so you find yourself in a place\nwhere\nkind of like despair I don't know what\nto do I don't know where to go from here\nand you realize at this point\nhopefully if you have this Awakening\nthat nothing you could ever do\nor nothing you could ever achieve can\nmake you more or less than what you\ncurrently are\nlike if you today let's say you're not a\nMillionaire right let's say you have 12\nin your bank account\nlet's say in five years you have a\nmillion dollars in your bank account\nin five years when you have that million\ndollars in your bank account are you\nmore of a human in five years with that\nmillion dollars in bank account than you\nare right now\nno\nyou're still the same you're still a\nhuman it doesn't make you better it does\nhaving a million dollars in bank account\ndoesn't make you a better person and not\nhaving a million dollars to make out\ndoesn't make you a worse person\nare you\nmore of a human when you buy that\nLamborghini\nand less of a human we don't have it are\nyou more of a human when you have that\nmansion and less of a human when you\ndon't have it no\nthere's nothing that you could do or\nachieve or say that would add or\nsubtract to who you currently are\nand that is what we all need to realize\nthere's a meditation that I do every\nonce in a while by this guy named Muji\nit's on YouTube and you know I'll put\nthem on and do some guided meditations\nwith him every once while in the morning\nand one thing that he says during the\nmeditation is he says you have no\npockets\nand obviously like I'm wearing pants\nright now and you might be like well I\ndo have pockets I've I do have four\npockets on my pants what he means is\nyour physical human body\nhas no pockets\nso he says you have no pockets you have\nno Storehouse there's nothing that you\ncould do or say to make you more than\nwhat you currently are\nlike you will you and I\ncame into this world naked we will die\nnaked we will literally leave with what\nwe came in with which means that nothing\nthat you could ever do or achieve or\nhave quote unquote have\nbecause you don't really have anything\nyou know as soon as you're gone\neverything's going to be put back into\nthe system the money's gonna be put back\nin the system the house can be probably\ngoing to sit back in the system the land\nthat you own is going to be put back in\nthe system which means nothing you could\never make or do would make you more than\nwhat you truly are and so to escape\nthe suffering\nto escape the anxiety to escape the\nstress what we need to do is that we\nneed to realize that we have to accept\nour truest selves we have to accept\nourselves as we are we need to try to\ntake the path back to who we were as a\nchild before we were domesticated and we\nhave to look at ourselves and say yeah\nI do have a scar on my face but I still\nlove myself yeah I do have a big old\nbutt but I still love myself you know\nand you look and you start from a place\nof Love versus a place of hate and\nwanting to change change change change\nbecause you hate yourself and you start\nyou know looking at yourself and saying\nyou know what maybe I am 15 or 15 pounds\noverweight but instead of hating myself\nto lose weight what if I love my body\nfor all that it's done all of the [ __ ]\nthat I've put it through the alcohol\nthat I've given it the drugs I've given\nit the bad food that I've given it and\nstill continues to run instead of from a\nplace of hate right like I hate my body\nit's like I want to accept and I want to\nlove my body and I want to take care of\nit because of all the stuff that's done\nfor me\nand the goal is to try to be the self\nwhich is truly\n100 integrated with who we truly are\ngoing back to the phrase I can no longer\nlive with myself the self is the\ncharacter that we have built ourselves\ninto\nwhat we're trying to do and what will\nactually cause the most happiness and\nthe most Joy is to go back to the truest\nform of you the I that was here when you\nwere born before we domesticated before\nwe were reprimanded eight times more\nthan we were praised before we were told\nwhat we should should not do in every\nsingle aspect before we had our heart\nbroken the first time before we started\nseeing advertisements that told us that\nwe weren't good enough until we buy\nthose products before we were bullied in\nschool before our parents told us what\nwe should and shouldn't do all of those\nthings and we go back to I the truest\nnature of ourself and realize that in\nthis moment right now there's nothing\nthat you could do say achieve that would\nmake you more than you currently are\nright now ever you've always been at\nthis level you will always be at this\nlevel there's nothing that you can do\nthen you can say there's nothing she can\nachieve so the goal to remove suffering\nand to bring the most happiness into\nyour life\nis to stop trying to change yourself\nfrom a place of wanting to hate yourself\nbut go back to the truest version of who\nyou are ReDiscover Who You Are\nand try to integrate the truest version\nof yourself into life that you currently\nhave now most people at that point in\ntime be like well Rob but if I love\nmyself if I love my life if I love all\nthose things I'll lose all of my\nmotivation I'll never become a million\nI'll never become successful oh no no\ngrasshopper what I've come to find is\nthat when you love yourself more it\nmakes taking the right action so much\neasier because you don't have to push\nyourself you feel in flow you feel\naligned you feel like what you're doing\nis the right thing and it makes it very\neasy to start making decisions and start\ntaking actions that are in alignment\nwith your truest self which allows you\nto achieve more and makes it so much\neasier to achieve and become whatever it\nis that you want to become as\nyour truest version of yourself versus\ntrying to build yourself into someone\nthat you're not so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if
