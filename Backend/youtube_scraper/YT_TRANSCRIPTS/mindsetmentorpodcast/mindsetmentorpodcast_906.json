you give a\npositive reading review the more that we\nget the more that those platforms show\nthis podcast to people who have never\nlistened to it before and the more that\nwe can grow and we can expand so if you\nwould do that I would greatly greatly\nappreciate it today we're going to be\ntalking about how to develop the right\nmindset to thrive in the recession that\nwe have coming up and I'm going to tell\nyou the I feel like I am obligated to\nshare this message about the recession\nand I want to talk to you about how if\nyou develop the right mindset and you\ntake the right actions you can use the\nnext 12 months as a jump start to an\namazing life recession is not something\nto be afraid of this is a really great\ntime to up level yourself and so as you\nstart watching the news and you start\nseeing stuff pop up people are saying\nrecession Doom and Gloom and holy crap\neveryone should be afraid I take the\nexact opposite stance and you'll see why\nas I go through today's episode why this\ncould be the most important 12 to 18\nmonths of your life with the recession\ncoming up and the massive strides that\nyou can make in your life but also in\nyourself as well\nso just give you an idea 75 of Fortune\n500 CEOs which are the top 500 companies\nUnited States say that they are\ncurrently preparing for a recession so\nwhen we talk about a recession let's\ntalk about what a recession is before we\ndive into how to actually Thrive inside\nof a recession a recession when you look\nup the actual definition is a period of\ntemporary economic decline temporary is\na key word there economic decline during\nwhich the industrial activity is reduced\ngenerally identified by a fall in GDP in\ntwo successive quarters GDP is gross\ndomestic product and just to give you\nthe actual definition of that gross\ngross domestic product in the United\nStates is the total value of goods\nproduced and services provided in a\ncountry during a year and so if you look\nat the United States what it says is two\ntwo in a row of quarters that where\nthere is actually a decline in the GDP\nwe are now two quarters into this here\nand both quarters there was a decline in\nthe GDP in the USA we've already done\nthat which means that according to\neconomics we are already in a recession\nnow I don't want to get into politics\nbecause I hate politics and I don't care\nto but the United States government is\nsaying that we're not in a recession yet\neven though we actually are\nso I just want to put that out there\nbefore we start diving into why this can\nactually be a great time for you so\nwe're currently in a recession according\nto economics and how do we make sure\nthat we Thrive and make sure that we use\nthis instead of a place where we can\ndecline over the next few years actually\nmake this some of the best years of our\nlife well the way that I see recessions\nis I see recessions like forest fires\nit's not the most fun thing is it\nhappens but what a forest fire does is\nit it burns the forest and the plants\nthat are on the bottom of the floor that\naren't able to get all of the sun and\nthe nutrients to come down actually to\nthem because all of the big huge trees\nare taking it what happens and what's\ncool about it is now it gives way for\nnew forests to grow and to build that's\nhow a recession works as well this is\nwhy recessions can be a good thing is\nbecause bad companies can completely go\nout of business\nnew companies and people have room to\ngrow in those recessions the same way\nthat new companies or new trees can grow\nthe same way that a new company can and\nso it starts a decade of New Growth\ntypically is what a recession does it's\nlike a forest fire that burns out the\nforest and then starts a usually about a\ndecade of growth this is actually\nnatural there's a thing called the chaos\ntheory\nChaos Theory basically means that as\ntransformation unfolds there has to be\nsome sort of breakdown so as an economy\ngrows there has to be some sort of\nbreakdown to grow again and then break\ndown tragalian and break down to Growing\nkind of like a muscle it must last to\nbreak down in order for it to grow and\nso is there greater uncertainty going\ninto a recession sure because things are\ngoing to change companies are going to\ngo out of business people are going to\nlose their jobs but with greater\nuncertainty means there is greater\npossibility available to everybody\nthat's out there and so let me give you\na couple of historic examples before we\ndive into the mindset side I just really\nwant to lay the groundwork and have you\nunderstand from me personally and I know\nsome very successful people are seeing\nthis as a great time to be able to grow\nand to be able to set themselves up for\nthe next decade the next 10 years so\nif you look at uh the pre-World War\nWorld War II after that recession there\nwas 81 months of growth 81. after the\nthe pre-vietnam War era after all after\nthat recession there was 108 months of\ngrowth pre-cold War there was 93 months\nof growth the pre-tech bubble in 2\n112 months of growth the pre-housing\nbubble which was 2008 2009-2010 in the\nUnited States there was 84 months of\ngrowth and then pre-coveted pandemic\nthere was\n128 months of growth over 10 years 10\nyears and eight months of growth in the\naverage recession lasts for only about\n15 months and so when you're looking\nback at previous recessions and moments\nof uncertainty lots of people who\nweren't planning ahead and weren't\ninvesting into themselves and growing\nthemselves in that time and they got\nscared and coiled away did not Thrive\nbut there's many businesses and many\npeople who every single recession use it\ncorrectly as a moment to Spring off and\nstart a brand new life and be able to\ngrow themselves and the people who\nthrive in recessions they have three\nthings these are three really important\nthings okay the first thing is they have\nthe right mindset obviously I'm the\nmindset guy I'm going to talk about this\nthey have high expectations for what's\npossible so instead of thinking like oh\nmy God the world is burning they have\nthe right expectation of going oh my God\nthis could be one of the best moments of\nmy life if I use it correctly knowing\nthat after these about 15 months of\nrecession is going to be about a decade\nof growth and so when you look at you\ncan go man this is actually a really\ngreat time for me to invest into myself\nor my skill sets or my knowledge or\ntrying to become a better business owner\na better employee so that when it does\ngrow again for 10 years I can make sure\nthat I am the best that I could possibly\nbe when it does go through that so the\nfirst thing that they have is the right\nmindset\nthe second thing that they have are the\nright skills so this could be personal\nhabits this could be routines that they\nhold themselves to but it could also be\nskills that make them valuable in the\nmarketplace so for you if you're an\nemployee and you never want to start a\nbusiness how can you develop the right\nskills to make yourself\nI don't know if this is a word\nunfireable but I'm going to use that\nword\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you love this video please hit\nthe like button it helps more than you\nknow and if you want to see more videos\nlike this hit the Subscribe button so\nthat you can see some more and get\nnotified the next time I post\nhow can you make sure that if other\npeople in your business do lose their\njobs that you are just com a person who\nis not Expendable you cannot be fired\nbecause the company needs you so much so\nhow can you use the next 15 months to\ndevelop whatever skills that you need\nwhether it's once again you're an\nemployee or if you're a business owner\nor you want to start a business how can\nyou look at this time instead of going\noh man maybe this isn't the right time\nto start a business how can you look at\nit and go hey maybe this is the best\ntime to start a business because\neveryone else is getting fearful and you\nknow there's a really famous quote by\nWarren Buffett he says Warren Buffett if\nyou don't know who he is he's a\nmulti-billionaire one of the richest men\nalive and he's an investor he says when\npeople are fearful be greedy that's the\nwhat we're about to go into when people\nare greedy be fearful that's what we're\ngetting out of right now and so when I\ntalk about skill set I mean they have\nthe right personal habits they have the\nright routines but they're also going\nhey what are the skills that are going\nto make me most valuable in the\nmarketplace in the next 15 months and\nthen going into the next decade after\nthat\nso that's the second thing first thing\nthey have the right mindset the second\nthing is they have the right skills and\nthe third thing is they have an\nopportunity based Outlook when your\nbrain is looking for opportunities you\nwill see opportunities if your brain is\nlooking for obstacles you will see\nobstacles if your brain is in fear you\nwill see many things around you to be\nfearful of and so you've got to go into\nthis this time that we have of hey\nthere's a lot of opportunity I need to\nsearch and find this opportunity one of\nthe quotes that I love about\nentrepreneurs and people say oh\nentrepreneurs and capitalism all these\nthings but an entrepreneur somebody who\ntakes somebody else's problems and makes\nit their own what do I mean by that they\nsee where there's a problem in the\nmarketplace they see where there's a\nproblem where people are getting\nunderserved where they don't have the\nright products where they don't have the\nright marketing where they don't have\nthe right customer service and they see\nother people's problems and they make it\ntheir own problem and make it their\nmission to solve that problem so I say\nthat big businesses that are not good\nbusinesses are going to be going out of\nbusiness that makes room for a lot of\nnew businesses to come in and so those\nare the three things you want to make\nsure that you have number one is the\nright mindset number two is write skills\nnumber three is you need to be looking\nat this as an opportunity not something\nto be afraid of and that's really why I\nwant to dive into in this episode and\nwhy I want to talk about this episode is\nbecause I see so much fear fear fear\nfear fear being given to people and I\ndon't think that at all I've been\nplanning for this to happen because\nrecessions are going to happen I've been\nplanning for the recession for four\nyears because I knew the recession was\ngoing to be happening at some point in\ntime\nand recessions only happen every 10 to\n12 years or so and so this could be\nbasically almost a once in a lifetime\nopportunity where you'll never be this\nyoung again you'll never have this much\nenergy again you'll never be at the\npoint in your life where you are right\nnow you'll be 10 to 12 years further on\ndown the road and 10 to 12 years older\nthan you are right now the next time\nthat this opportunity comes up so\nthere's only really a few opportunities\nwhere you can really position yourself\nto win in life and I want you to\nunderstand that this is one of those\nthose opportunities where you can really\nreally position yourself this is not a\ntime to be afraid this is not a time to\ncoil away and to hide this is the time\nto look at this as a right time of hey I\nneed to grow in this time I need to set\nmyself apart from the crowd if people\nare spending too much time on social\nmedia I need to spend less time on\nsocial media and figure out how I can\nbuild up a skill set and a mindset to be\nable to thrive in this time and so what\nyou want to do is at this point in time\nis prioritize your money into investing\nyour time your money and your energy\ninto yourself so instead of going and\nbuying new things like if you notice the\ncar market went way up and now it's\nstarting to go way down again it's\nbecause people are starting to be\nfearful so instead of buying things how\ncan you invest into yourself into your\nknowledge into your skill set is there a\ncourse that you could buy is there a\nmentor that you could invest into that\nhas already run the business that you\nwant is there somebody that you know\nthat's in your area that is in real\nestate and they're going to be crushing\nit over the next few years and you go\nyou know what I'll just pay them to\nlearn from them I'll see if I can invest\nmy money into them and into myself so\nthat therefore I can grow whatever it\nlooks like how can you stop spending\nyour money on things and start investing\nyour money into yourself but also not\njust your money your time your energy\ninto growing yourself it's not the time\nto be afraid and coil away this is the\ntime for you to really double down on\nyourself\nand as I said the next 12 months could\nbe the most important 12 months of your\nlife it could possibly dictate where\nyour life is going to go so when there's\nuncertainty that's out in the world\nyou've heard me say this before what you\nneed to build is certainty inside of\nyourself you need to build yourself for\nyou you need to build yourself for your\nfamily you need to build yourself for\nthe world this is such an important time\nand I want you to understand once again\nit is not a fearful time it is an\nimportant time but with it being hey we\nhave about 15 months or so to really\nexecute this is not the time to say I'll\nstart soon or I'll start next month or\nI'll start next quarter it could be too\nlate this is a time where you want you\nneed to when this podcast ends think to\nyourself what is it that I need to do\nfor myself what do I need to stop doing\nwhat do I need to start doing what do I\nneed to continue doing to grow myself\ninto a person who can thrive in the\nupcoming recession that we're going to\nhave this is a moment where you get to\nget a jump start because everyone else\nis being fearful you get to get a jump\nstart and you get to go you know what\nI'm everybody else is ebbing I'm flowing\nif everybody else is Flowing I'm ebbing\nthis is a time for you to decide to\nstart that business that you've always\nwanted to start this is a time for you\nto stop buying things and start\ninvesting into yourself this is the the\ntime for you to do it and\nand really more than anything else I\ncoach a lot of business people and I see\nsome business people starting to be like\nwell what's coming up in the future\nwhat's coming up in the future what's\ncoming up in the future there's a lot of\nfake gurus that are out there that are\ngoing to be kind of crushed in the\nfuture there's a lot of people that are\nout there that are acting like their\nbusiness is doing better than is they're\ngoing to be crushed in the future\nthere's a lot of people who are out\nthere that are acting like they have\nmore money than they have and they're\ngoing to be crushed in the future\nthey're people who have over extended\nthemselves which could possibly be\ncrushed in future and that sucks that's\nnot something that we want for people\nbut it's time for you to sit there and\ngo what can I do to grow myself and so\nreally what it comes down to is\nno matter what you're doing if you're\nworking for somebody else and you've\nbeen thinking about growing your\nbusiness Now's the Time to grow the\nbusiness if you're working for someone\nelse and you're thinking about growing\nyour skill set now is the time to grow\nthe skill set you know if you think\nabout growing a business but you only\nwant like a part-time business on the\nside that's fine you know if you want to\nstart an Etsy shop where you make\njewelry or you make stickers or you make\nsome cool stuff for people's houses\nstart it now don't wait for six months\nfrom now if things start to get a little\nbit harder start it now\nbecause even if it doesn't bring in like\nfull-time income for you it can still be\na safety net\nwhen things get hard in 18 or 12 months\nif they get hard in 18 to 12 18 12 to 18\nmonths excuse me if they get hard in 12\nto 18 months it can be a safety net for\nyou so like let's say for instance\nyou're sitting there and you make six\nthousand dollars a month in your job\nright you make 72 Grand a year and you\ngo you know what I'm going to start that\nEtsy shop that I've been thinking about\nstarting and over the next six months\nyou build it to three thousand dollars a\nmonth that might not be enough to fully\npay your bills but if you happen to lose\nyour job in six months at least you\nwould have something to lean back on and\ngo you know what all right I lost my job\nI already have this business that's up\nand running I'm putting a hundred\npercent of my energy into that it's\neasier to go from three thousand to six\nthousand than from zero to three\nthousand and so I just want to bring\nthat up for you guys to understand that\nif if you get the feeling that hey this\nseems right this seems like something I\nshould do I should invest into myself\ninto growing my business I should invest\ninto growing my mindset now is the right\ntime to do it I don't want you to be\nafraid because fear never brings\nanything good you don't take the right\naction when you're in fear and so if you\nfeel like this is a time for you to take\naction I think that it's the
