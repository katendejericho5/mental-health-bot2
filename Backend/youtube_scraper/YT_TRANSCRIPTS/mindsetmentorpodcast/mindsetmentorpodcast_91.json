    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to learn grow and\nimprove in your life exponentially very\nquickly starting today let's dive in I'm\ngoing to be talking to you about why\njust reading books is not really enough\nfor you in your personal why going to\nconferences and hiring a coach or hiring\na therapist is not enough and that there\nshould be another level on top of that\nnow I'm not saying don't do any of those\nthings uh cuz I think all of those\nthings are important what I'm telling\nyou is that I think most people a lot of\npeople I'll actually say miss the boat\non what real pers alment is um I'm going\nto talk to you about how to improve your\nlife really quickly um and and how to\nbasically use your life as as the way I\nlike to call it as like a classroom for\nyou right every single thing that\nhappens to you is your classroom so your\nlessons are constantly coming to you all\nday long everything that happens to you\nwhether you view that thing is good\nwhether you view it as bad uh or whether\nyou view it as just neutral is your\nopportunity to learn and grow the\nproblem is that a lot of people don't\nsee it that way they don't really\nperceive it that way so they don't\nreally even know and one of the the\nmisconceptions about personal\ndevelopment and I've been in personal\ndevelopment now for for 19 years and I I\nknow a lot about it I've read hundreds\nof books I've been to tons of conferen I\ninvested hundreds of thousands of\ndollars into myself and I think all of\nit is very important but a lot of times\npeople think personal development is\njust reading a book or sitting down and\nmeditating or going to a conference or\nfinding time to journal uh or listening\nto a podcast like this all of that stuff\nis great those are all great and they're\nall needed but they're not the only\nthing it's like this is the example that\nI'll give you right that pops into my\nhead reading a book about how to improve\nyourself and then not taking that in to\nyour life and trying to use it is like\ntrying to become appr basketball player\nby watching the playoffs but never\nactually stepping on the court your life\nis your court your life is the the\nchance where you get to to to take a\nshot to miss to screw it all up to\nrealize oh man I really screwed that\nthing up let me try to get a little bit\nbetter you know people think like I got\nto get my my 30 minutes of personal\ndevelopment in the morning no no dude\nyour entire life is your personal vment\nin every moment of your life and the way\nthat you show up the way that you talk\nto other people that you talk to\nyourself even in just the way that you\nfeel in a quick moment of silence over 2\nminutes do you feel stressed do you feel\nanxious is there something that you can\ndo to recalibrate in the moment to make\nyourself feel a little bit better you\nknow some people will go and and read a\nbook and then get into an argument with\ntheir spouse and not realize that that\nargument with their spouse was their\ngreatest opportunity for personal growth\nthat day not reading a book the\nreal thing that you have to ask yourself\nis like why was there an argument in the\nfirst place what why where were you\ntriggered what what triggered you about\nwhat they said or what they did why is\nthat a trigger for you because whenever\nyou you you're triggered by somebody\nit's a massive opportunity for you to\nlearn because when you are triggered a a\ntrigger into to be triggered by somebody\nis just the universe showing you where\nyou are not free it's showing you where\nyou are locked in this this construct of\nthis this is the way that it's supposed\nto be this is the way that they're\nsupposed to be this is the way a\nrelationship is supposed to be and when\na trigger comes to you it is not a\nmoment for you to get mad at the other\nperson now mind you we all get lost in\nthe moment to moment things where we can\nget mad at somebody but if we take a\nstep back realize that when you're\ntriggered it is nobody else's fault but\nyour own it's not because the exact same\nthing could have happened to somebody\nelse and them not get triggered\nwhich shows that it's not the trigger\nit's you if you have an anger problem if\nyou have a short fuse if you lash out at\npeople if you get extremely emotional\nwhen someone does something to you that\nis you it's not the circumstance it's\nyour reaction to the circumstances the\nthing that you need to work through and\nso I love that you listen to this\npodcast I love that you read books and\nyou go to conferences and you have a\ncoach or a therapist I love all of those\nthings but every moment of your life is\nyour classroom to improve yourself you\nknow was your was your spouse triggered\nbased off of something that that you did\nor something that you say where did that\ncome from can we try to help them\nthrough it I always say when someone\ntriggers you you want to punch them you\nknow if someone on the street says\nsomething to you and it triggers you and\nmakes you mad you want to punch them but\nin reality you should give them a high\nfive because they just showed you where\nyou're not free and it is my personal\nbelief and I'll just share a couple\npersonal beliefs with you guys uh\nthroughout the this podcast episode it\nis my personal belief that when someone\ncomes into your life you know let's say\nsomebody you're having a great day\nyou're driving to work right now you\nhave your coffee and the sun shining you\nbeen have such a great day and then\nsomebody cuts you off flicks you off and\nyou know throws their coffee behind you\nbehind them and it hits your your\nwindshield right and you get\nfurious right I get I get as a\nhuman why you can be furious in that\nmoment but as a soul that's coming here\nto have a human experience what I see\nthat person that triggered you as is the\nuniverse coming to you through that\nperson to show you where you're not free\nit is your greatest moment to learn in\nthat moment right so it's like that's an\nextreme example someone throwing their\ncoffee at your car yeah most people\nlisten this podcast are going to get\npretty pissed but let's just say they\ncut you off and you get you get ah so\nwound up it's like okay why did I get\nwound up well that is the universe\ncoming to you through that person to\nshow you where you are not free you know\nyou can you can listen to this podcast\nand I love that you listen to this\npodcast and get all excited about\ngrowing and then 30 minutes later your\nchild has a temper tantrum in Target and\nyou freaking lose it I love that you\nlisten to the podcast but that moment\nwhere you you you had the decision of\nand it it might have been an unconscious\ndecision it was just right there of like\ndo I breathe or do I freak out right now\nthat moment where you made that decision\nand that moment where you need to figure\nout what to do where your child is\nhaving a temper tantrum that is a much\nbetter place to get your person\ndevelopment in this podcast I love that\nyou listen this podcast but the the\ntraining this is the knowledge right the\ntraining happens in real life can you\nlearn to keep calm in the middle of any\nstorm you know that moment was an\nopportunity for you to learn and grow\ndid you take the universe up on that\nopportunity you know let's say let's\nlet's take a different example because I\nknow a lot of people get very triggered\nin relationships right let's say that\nyour your boyfriend or your girlfriend\nforgets to call you they were supposed\nto call you uh before they went to bed\nand they they fell asleep let's say for\ninstance you don't know they fell asleep\nbut it triggers you and it triggers\nsomething deep inside of you maybe it it\ntriggers you and you don't realize it\nbut it it triggers your fear of\nAbandonment from your childhood cuz\nmaybe your father wasn't around that's\nyour trigger sure you can blame it on\nthem but you were the one that was\ntriggered some people they be like oh\nthey must have fallen asleep no big deal\nI'll talk to them tomorrow but you're\nthe one who started going getting pissed\noff and and and it was your trigger and\nthat's the universe saying hey you know\nknock it at your door hey sweetheart you\nstill have this fear of Abandonment you\nstill have this abandonment issue that\nyou need to work through from your\nchildhood I'm coming to you through your\ngirlfriend to show you where you're not\nfree and when you start to see this you\nreally start to see that all of life is\na lesson for you there are lessons 40 50\nlessons a day for you if you're really\nsitting there trying to trying to work\non yourself your life I always say this\nme and my best friend always say this\nyour life is a perfectly crafted\ncurriculum for you to evolve into the\nhighest version of yourself whatever\nthat means your life is a perfectly\ncrafted curriculum for you to evolve\ninto the highest version of yourself you\nknow and and I'll share kind of my\nviewpoint I sh this a couple years ago\non the podcast but um I remember there\nwas there was a moment where I was\ndriving with my mom and my mom was\nsaying you know she felt she she was\nbasically saying to me that she felt\nreally guilty for um for marrying my dad\nand bringing my myself and my sister\ninto this world to have an alcoholic\nfather and so I said to her I was like I\nI don't think you should feel guilty at\nall like I think that it was perfect for\nme like I wouldn't I wouldn't do what I\ndo now if and you know have have\nimpacted people's lives if I didn't go\nthrough all of that with my dad and\nmy sister is going to school to be a\ntherapist and to help uh abandon\nchildren specifically girls um try to\nyou know interact in the world and get\nbetter in the world and so it's like\nhaving an alcoholic father who kind of\nabandoned us was the best thing that\ncould have happened but anyways I was\ntalking to my mom about this and sharing\nmy perspective and I said hey here's the\nway that I see it and if you want to\ntake this perspective you can if you\ndon't no big deal I'll just share every\nmy perspective to everybody the way I\nsaid it is is you know I believe that I\nam a soul that is having a human\nexperience and I am in this physical\nbody sure I've been given name Rob dial\nand all of that stuff but the way I see\nit is like my soul was basically one day\nflipping through a karaoke book of\nlife's and it was saying okay well you\nknow there's this guy there's there's\nJohn Smith and there's there's Taylor\ngreen and then there's there's Rob dial\nand Rob dial is going to be you know son\nto Debbie and Steve and Steve is going\nto have childhood trauma that he didn't\novercome uh his you know Steve's father\nuh ended up killing himself when he was\n12 and he walked in the room and saw\nthat and he's never going to overcome\nthis trauma and because he's not going\nto overcome this trauma he's going to\nbecome an alcoholic and uh Rob's going\nto have to deal with this and his\nparents are going to get divorced when\nhe's 10 and his father is going to pass\naway at 15 from being an alcoholic and\nhere's all the things that are going to\ncome from it and all the things that he\nneeds to work through and it's like I I\nlike to view it as my soul was looking\nthrough this book and said hm\nI think my next level kind of like a\nvideo game I think my next level is this\nRob dial one I'm going to choose this\none because this is what I need to get\nto my next level of and to evolve into\nmy highest version of myself so my soul\nwent yep I'm going to take Rob dial and\nso what happens is now I can never look\nat any circumstance in my life as a\nvictim because I believe that I chose it\nyou know and I I believe that our our\nsouls took this exact body in life to\nlearn and go through whatever it is that\nwe need to go through to get to whatever\nit is the next plane or whatever it is\nthat the next level of Enlightenment\nwhatever happens after this I don't know\nso everything that happened to me in my\nlife so far and that will happen to me\nwas chosen by me not by Rob like the\nphysical version of me but the soul and\nso when you look at it that way it\nreally takes victimhood out of it you\nknow i' I've talked with a lot of people\nwho who are really just stuck in the\nfeeling of being a victim and I share\nthis with them and then they start to\nthink about it and they're like man yeah\nI I can start to see that perspective\nand I don't need someone to take my\nfull-on perspective but if they can\nstart to see a little bit of a\nperspective they can start to see wow\nyeah everything that's that's here is\nlike a video game it's for me to learn\nand grow and get better so all of the\nlove that I have is a lesson for me to\nlearn and grow and get better all of the\nloss all the people who have died all\nthe people who have broken my heart my\nmy sadness my happiness my anger my\nfrustration every single thing that is\nbrought to me is my opportunity to learn\nand\ngrow and we can play the victim but if\nwe play the victim we miss those lessons\nwe miss our opportunity to grow you're\nlistening to this podcast because you\nwant to get better for some sort of in\nsome way for some reason and so if you\njust listen to this podcast and it goes\nin one year and out the other and then\nyou have a you know a blow up with your\nsignificant other in 20 minutes after\nlisten to this\npodcast did you get the lesson is there\na lesson in that blow that you can\nextract from it the highest version of\nyou is not found in a book it's on the\nother side of a breakdown it's on the\nother side of a fight it's on the other\nside of a of a uh a blow up it's on the\nother side of um of you know whatever it\nis that triggers you and so really what\nit comes down to is is to start to\nbecome aware of these things and start\nto become a like notice when your body\nshifts in some sort of way notice when\nyou start to feel either a shift from\nyou know calm peaceful to angry or from\ncalm and peaceful to stressed out or\ncalm and peaceful to anxious or calm and\npeaceful to\nsad notice the feeling and just you know\nit's okay then you know don't try to\ndeflect and not feel the feelings a lot\nof people I think try not to feel their\nfeelings like just notice the\nfeeling breathe in the feeling for a\nsecond don't resist it and then ask\nyourself what am I feeling like what is\nthis feeling in my body right now oh you\nknow what I'm feeling I'm feeling really\nanxious\nokay why am I feeling this way I'm\nfeeling this way because you know my\ngirlfriend said she was going to text me\nbefore she went to bed she usually goes\nto bed at 10:00 it's now 11: and I'm\nfeeling really triggered by the fact\nthat I haven't been called yet or I\nhaven't been texted yet okay what is\nthat showing me about myself well it's\nshowing me that that I don't like when\npeople who I'm close to don't end up\ncalling me okay why is that is there\nsomething that happened in my past that\nmaybe I can make some connection\nyeah well I kind of have a think think I\nmight have a fear of Abandonment okay\nwhere did this fear of Abandonment come\nfrom well it came from the fact that my\nfather wasn't around and then what\nhappens is instead of getting instead of\ngetting mad at yourself for being\ntriggered or getting mad at someone else\nin that triggering what happens is you\njust become very curious that's one of\nthe things that I think is a skill set\nthat people should develop in person of\nthem is to become very curious about\nyourself become very curious as to why\nyou think the way that you think why you\nfeel the way that you feel why you act\nthe way that you act where you got it\nfrom trace it back to your childhood\ntake out a pen and paper and just ask\nyourself questions does this relate to\nmy childhood does this fear of\nAbandonment relat to my childhood oh my\nGod it relates to my dad I can start to\nsee this and what happens is you start\nto make connections with yourself you\nstart to understand yourself at a much\nmuch deeper level and then when you\nstart to feel that trigger coming up\nagain you can become much more\nself-aware because you're now starting\nto to notice this pattern within\nyourself and if you can notice the\npattern within yourself if you can\nnotice the selfawareness you can start\nto work through it you can start to\nbreathe through it you can say you know\nwhat is it possible you just to ask\nyourself the question is it possible\nthat maybe my girlfriend fell asleep\nmaybe she or you know if someone's been\ncheated on in the past and it's like oh\nmy God she didn't text me she must be\ncheating on me with somebody else that's\na whole other trigger is it possible\nthat she fell asleep and she's not\ntriggered she's not uh cheating on me\nand just try to see a little bit\ndifferent of a perspective and it's\nnever comfortable to be triggered uh but\nbeing triggered is a gift because it's\nshowing you where you're not free so\ndon't resist it instead of trying to to\nget away from it what if you start to\nlean into it start to lean into those\nuncomfortable feelings you know your\nresistance doesn't help you it doesn't\nhelp you it doesn't help your loved ones\nit doesn't help the world I think the\nthe reason why we're here is so that we\ncan start to break free and and liberate\noursel from the mental prisons that\nwe've all created subconsciously or\nunconsciously over the course of our our\nexistence from things that we learn from\nour parents we learn from society and\nyou know these constructs and and\npatterns and conditionings that we've\nlearned along the way we lost oursel\nalong the way and now it's about going\nback and trying to find oursel and so\nwhen you get these triggers it's showing\nyou where you're not free ask yourself\nabout them what can you learn from it\nwhat can you learn from it what can you\nlearn from because this is the true\nclassroom of your life and the place\nwhere you can really learn and grow the\nmost so when you're triggered by\nsomebody and you go through life realize\nthat there's always something to learn\nare you getting the lesson from\neverything that happens to you so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please do me a\nfavor share it on your Instagram stories\ntag me in at robd Jr r o d i a l Jr also\nif you love this podcast
