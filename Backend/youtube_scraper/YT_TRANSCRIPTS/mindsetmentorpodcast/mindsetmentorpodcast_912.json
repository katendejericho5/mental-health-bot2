    "transcript": "if you get a gut feeling about someone\nor something make sure that you trust it\nhere's the reason why we're taught in\nour society to follow our minds but our\nminds were actually developed in the\nwomb after our heart so our heart our\ngut feeling usually knows the path first\nand the Brain catches up to it and so if\nyou get a feeling about someone good or\nbad that something is right or something\nis wrong make sure that you follow it\neven if it logically makes sense to go a\ndifferent direction if you follow your\ngut feeling you follow your heart it\nalways knows first it usually just takes\ntime for the brain to catch up"
