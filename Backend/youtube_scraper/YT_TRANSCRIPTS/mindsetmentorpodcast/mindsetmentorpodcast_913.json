in if you're out\nthere and you love this podcast please\ngive us a rating and review on Spotify\nor apple podcast or however you listen\nto us it really helps the show grow\ntoday I'm going to be giving you three\ntips to follow through with what you say\nyou're going to do or three tips to\nbasically stop giving up on the things\nthat you said you were going to do or\nthe things that you started I'm going to\nteach you how to push through when you\nfeel like giving up because all too\noften like I get guys I get a lot of\nmessages I get a lot of Facebook\nmessages I get a lot of ton of Instagram\nmessages and I read through all of them\nI don't always get time to responding\nbecause I get a lot like 40 to 50 a day\non average I read through all of them\nand one of the things that I see from\npeople time in timeout time in timeout I\nhear people and how they start something\nand then they give up too soon\nit's so easy people will start and\nthey'll be so excited like a diet for\ninstance or a workout plan they're gonna\nsay all right for the next 60 days I'm\ngonna do this this and this and the\nfirst day they're like new me you know\nespecially happens at the beginning of\nthe year new year new me I got this\nwe're gonna do this and they're they're\nfocusing on being this person they want\nto be and day one it's like yes I did it\nso excited and then day two you're like\nall right I'm pretty excited let's go\nand you do it you're like yes I feel\ngood and then day three like oh okay\nlet's do it let's let's go and you do it\nand then day four day five day six day\nseven at some point in time you fall off\nright think about how many times you\nhave started something with excitement\nwith intention going into it you made a\nplan but then some some point in time\nyou gave up\nsomewhere along the way you didn't\nfinish now think about this for a second\nthat thing that you gave up on three\nyears ago that business that you gave up\non three years ago where could it be\ntoday\nif you didn't give up\nthat relationship where could it be\ntoday if you didn't give up that\nbusiness where could it be today if you\ndidn't give up because all too often\npeople give up and time is going to pass\nanyways\nso we might as well be doing something\nthat is going to be helping us create\nthe future that we want right if you\nstarted something if you started that\nbusiness if you started that workout\nplan you started it with the intention\nof finishing it didn't you\nyou did you started with the intention\nto finish\nyou wanted to finish it you probably\nstill wish you would have finished it\nso why aren't you doing it though\nwhy are you giving up\nbecause you went into it I'm going to do\nthis 60 days straight of working out\nmaybe like I'm gonna do that 75 hard\nthing I'm so excited to do it\nyou are excited to finish it you wanted\nto finish it you right now wish that you\nwould have finished it so why the hell\ndid you give up the answer is very\nsimple\nsuper simple I remember hearing Kevin\nHart talk about this one time it's the\nsimplest answer in the world\nyou gave up\nbecause giving up is easy\nyou gave up because giving up is easy\ngiving up is the easiest thing to do in\nthe world\nit requires nothing of you\nit requires nothing of you\nso you gave up instead of taking the\nhard route instead of following through\ninstead of doing what you needed to do\nand if you continue to keep doing that\npattern over over and over and over and\nover again you're not going to have the\nlife that you want in fact you're\nprobably going to be very displeased\nwhat your life looks like when you get\nto the end of it it requires nothing of\nyou to give up and giving up is the\neasiest thing to do in the world it's\nnot that you stopped caring about the\nend result it's that you chose the easy\nroute\nno great life has ever been created by\ntaking the easy route\nand you're not listening to this podcast\nbecause you want to take the easy route\nright you're here because you're hoping\nthat I can give you some Secret Sauce to\nget you to actually take action when you\nknow you're supposed to take action\nthat's why you're really here right\nhopefully Rob is going to be able to\nbrainwash me into actually doing the\n[ __ ] that I need to do you're here\nbecause you want to get better at taking\naction you want to get better at taking\nthe hard route you want to take The Road\nLess Traveled\nbut you've given up so many times\nhow are you going to give up and then\nthink that the next time you're going to\nbe able to follow through\nand you've heard me say it before\nbut I'm gonna say it again over and over\nand over again life is either hard now\nand easy later or hard now and easy\nlater life is going to be hard at some\npoint but the beautiful thing about\nbeing a human is you get to choose when\nyou want it to be hard and I don't know\nabout you I'd rather have life be harder\nnow when I'm younger I am the youngest\nand you are the youngest that you will\never be\nyou won't ever be younger than you are\nright now so you might as well take the\nharder route now because when you're 60\n70 80 years old\nyeah it's gonna be way harder\nI don't want it to be hard when I'm\nolder\nI want life to be awesome when I'm older\nand here's what's great about it when\nyou make life hard now it usually\nbecomes very easy very quickly and so\nyou have to realize from the very\nbeginning of this there's not a part of\nyou that stopped caring there's not a\npart of you that didn't want to do it\nthere's not a part of you that didn't\nwant to finish you wanted to finish you\nprobably still wish you would have\nfinished but you didn't\nso don't say I didn't have enough time\noh I didn't have enough time gay or V\nI've heard him say him one time don't\nsay you don't have enough time just\nsimply say don't give a [ __ ] and see if\nthat changes your perception on\nsomething\noh I don't have enough time to build the\nbusiness that I want to to create the\nfinancial security for my family no say\nI don't give a [ __ ] about building the\nbusiness to create Financial Security\nfor my family and see how that makes you\nchange the way that you feel\nand so what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto give you guys three tips to help you\npush through when you want to give up\nand so you wanted some Secret Sauce\nthat's why you hear this is what I'm\ngoing to give you okay the first thing I\nwant you to do and mind you you might\nnot like any of these but these are all\ngoing to help you if you do actually\ntake action with them number one train\nyourself for what's hard\njust train yourself for what's hard the\nreason why you take the easy route is\nbecause you've always taken the easy\nroute because you're used to taking the\neasy route you're not used to taking the\nhard route when I was younger I was\nsuper lazy I didn't do anything with\nmyself I would I had no accomplishments\nand I gave up on everything\nbut\none day I hired a coach I started\nworking with that coach and they started\ntraining me mentally on what it is that\nI needed to do and change in my life and\nover time I got better at following\nthrough and better at following through\nand better at following through and now\nit actually pisses me off to give\nsomething up\nso I would much rather go and finish\nsomething\nI didn't used to be that way I used to\nbe the give up person\nso train yourself for what's hard\nbecause if you do what's hard it will\nbecome easier to do what is hard later\non as well this is why I'm such a fan of\ncold pledges and cold showers I hate\nthem I absolutely hate cold showers\nthere's no part of me that is excited to\njump into a cold shower but I love cold\nshowers not because it feels good no it\nhurts I was in the cold plunge the other\nday and it was 39 degrees and literally\nwithin the first 30 seconds I was like\nmy feet hurt it feels like there's Nails\ngoing into my feet I knew I wouldn't die\nI knew I was going to be fine I knew it\nwas more mental than it was physical and\nI was trying to train my brain into not\ngiving up I said I was going to do it\nI'm going to do it\nI hate it but I love it no matter how\nmany cold plunges or cold showers I take\nor how many you take you will never look\nforward to the next one unless you're\njust some weird sadistic person I do not\nand I don't know many people I do look\nforward to them it's just like you got\nto get it done you're training yourself\nto do what you need to do because what\nhappens is right when you're about to\njump into that cold water\nyou have that little voice pop in your\nhead hey don't do this right now hey no\nthis isn't a thing that you want to do\nno don't jump into the cold shower\nnobody will just skip today\njust skip today this is dumb this is\ndumb why why do you need to jump oh\nyou're gonna listen you're going to\nlisten to that podcaster guy and just\njump in a cold shower because it says\nthat's stupid you guys know what Dolly's\ntalking about right now the little Voice\nkeeps coming back keeps coming back it\nkeeps coming back\nand the thing about it is then you're\nlike screw it I'm gonna do it anyways\nand that movement into doing what you\ndon't want to do\nas a practice you can do over and over\nand over again here's the crazy thing\nabout it too right\nother J other day I jumped to my cold\nplunge I was in and it wasn't like I was\nin and then the voice just disappeared\nright the voice was like get out get out\nget out get out get out get out get out\nget out all right you did what you're\nsupposed to do you're in it right I\nwanted to be in for five minutes I'm\nabout 14 seconds in and my my brain is\ngoing get out just get out you jumped in\nthe cold dude you did what you said\nyou're gonna do cool you did that hard\nthing today get out you know just jump\nin get out of it you know you said\nyou're gonna be here for five but just\ngot on one no big deal no one will ever\nknow\nthat you were in this cold water for\nonly one minute when you said you're\ngonna do five nobody will ever know\nbut you will know\nand that's where your confidence is\nbuilt oh you know you're in the cold\nshower oh you're in a cold shower ah you\nknow it's pretty cool just make it a\nlittle bit warmer dude and it keeps\ncoming and it keeps coming The Voice\njust keeps coming and it keeps coming\nand it keeps coming and you just get\nbetter at not listening to voice The\nVoice never at least from my point of\nview I've not been able to get that\nvoice to disappear I just learned to\nstop listening to it it's the one that\nmakes you give up it's the one that says\ndon't go to the gym it's the one that\nsays hey you know sleep in when you said\nyou're gonna wake up someone says hey\nyou wanted to go for a run don't go for\na run dude you had a long day yesterday\nit's the or even today oh you want to go\nfor a nightly run man you know what you\nhad a long day\nyou deserve this chill and watch some\nNetflix\nit's the mental gym to do what needs to\nbe done regardless of how you feel\nand that brings us to our next point\nwhich is number two\ndo what needs to be done regardless of\nhow you feel\nAKA stay consistent somebody asked me\nwhat I think the number one key to\nsuccess is and I just said consistency\nconsistency to do it do it day in day\nout day in day out I was watching a\nvideo the other day Alex Emoji was\nsaying the people who have who have\nmastered life become the most successful\njust become okay with doing the boring\nthings every single day right I don't\nwant you to be motivated I don't want\nyou to be skilled\nI don't want you to be amazing I don't\nwant you to be better than everybody\nelse I just want you to be consistent I\nwant you to show up every single day\nbecause you're not showing up for other\npeople you're showing up for yourself\nand now I want you to show up for\nyourself every single day because when\nyou show up for yourself that's a mental\nwin that's a little I always say it I\nalways I just think of confidence as\nlike little jingle blocks little Jenga\nblocks and when you show up and you do\nwhat's hard or you do what you're going\nto do you're supposed to do and you stay\nconsistent it's like one little block\none little Jenga block of of just like\nbelieving in yourself\njust that one little block of confidence\nand I'm trying to stack as many of those\nas possible when you see a confident\nperson you're seeing somebody who has\nbuilt themselves so I want you to be\nconsistent over everything else\njust show up and do what needs to be\ndone regardless of how you feel\ndecide what your goal is\nplan out what actions need to be taken\nto get there\nwhat you want your life to be and what\nyou need to do to get there figure out\nwhat actions need to be taken each day\nand then just show up and do it and will\nyou will you feel fear sure of course\nyou will you're going to feel fear\nalmost every single day but one of my\nfavorite Will Smith quotes it sucks I I\nalways quote Will Smith and I always\nhave but it's kind of hard to quote Will\nSmith now after all the things that\nhappen right so it's like I hope I hope\none day the Will Smith quotes that I say\nall the time mean what they used to mean\nand that people can take them uh to\nheart when you're looking at somebody\nokay he made a mistake flawed individual\nwe're all flawed but if you look at\neverything he's done across his life\nhe's done some pretty amazing things\nhe's made a pretty amazing life for\nhimself and one of the things that he\nsays is he says if you can't overcome\nfear just do it scared\nyou're still doing it you're just doing\nit scared if you can't overcome fear\njust do it scared don't give up just do\nit scared just do it worried just do it\nAngry just do it pissed off just do it\nsad but do it no matter what\nthe person who is the most consistent in\nthe long run over time you fast forward\nfive years 10 years 20 years from today\nthe person who is the most consistent I\nwill put my money down that that person\nwill win in the long run slow and steady\nwins the race don't worry about tomorrow\nand all of the things that need to be\ndone and it's paralysis by analysis of\nall the stuff needs to be done tomorrow\nin the next week and over the next month\nand oh my God over the next five years\nthese are all the things I need to do to\ncreate success no don't worry about\ntomorrow all that needs to be done today\nis all we need to focus on just take\naction today you can't take tomorrow's\nactions today just take them today\ndon't think about your wins and losses\nof yesterday if you had an amazing day\nyesterday that means nothing today\ntaking action today is all that matters\nyesterday's actions yesterday's wins\nyesterday's failures they mean nothing\ntoday today is all that matters can you\nwin the day yesterday's successes and\nfailures mean nothing today take action\nno matter how you feel and then number\nthree the third thing is to have a why\nwhy are you doing it when you find this\ngoal you know your this goal of wanting\nto work out 60 days in a row why are you\ndoing it it's not just to look better\nthere's a lot of things that are going\nto happen when you do that\nhow much more confident you're finally\ngoing to be in yourself how are you\ngoing to be healthier for your children\nhow are you going to live longer how\nit's going to be easier later on down\nthe road because you're going to be more\nmobile find a why that's going to drive\nyou it goes back to the quote when you\nthink about giving up remember why you\nstarted\nwhen you're about to give that thing up\nbecause it's the easiest thing to do in\nthe world remember why you started this\nwill push you to take action even when\nyou don't feel like doing it it'll push\nyou to take action when you feel like\nyou've lost yourself it'll push you to\ntake action and to be consistent when\nyou just don't want to get up and do it\nif there is a strong why behind what it\nis that you want to do you can always\nfigure out how to get yourself up and do\nit\nmy very first Mentor my very first coach\nat Harvard when I was 19 years old he\nused to always say it if you listen to\npodcasts for long if you've heard me say\nthis over and over again\nif the why is strong enough the how will\nreveal itself if your why as to why you\nwant to work out for those 60 days in a\nrow is strong enough you'll figure out\nhow to do it every single day if you are\nwhy is strong enough as to why you want\nto build that successful business to\nyour family the how will eventually pop\nup but if you don't have a strong wire\nif you're not focusing on why you want\nto do something it makes it so much\neasier to give up in the moment because\nyou've lost the reason why you want to\ndo it so when you think about giving up\nremember why you started because there\nwas a part of you there was a person at\nsome point in time in the past who\nreally wanted to finish him\nso if you're struggling with giving up\ntoo early take these three tips and\nremember that the reason why you give up\nis because it's easy stop doing what's\neasy go and actually do what's hard show\nup every single day be consistent and\nhave a really strong ride so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if you\nlove this
