strengthen in order to\nchange your life\nwhen you look at your life\nthere's really not a whole lot of things\nyou need to do to change it and before I\ntalk about this this is what I'm one\nthing I want to say there's nothing\nwrong with your life as it is if you're\ngoing into it trying to fix something or\nyou think that something is wrong in\nyour life you're like oh my gosh I'm\ngoing into self-development I want to\nfind out these Hobbies so that I can fix\nall of the BS in my life\nthere's nothing wrong the only thing\nthat's wrong is that we think that\nthere's something wrong everything in\nlife whether it's good whether it's bad\nstruggle challenge all of it is good for\nyou in some sort of way all of it is\nbeneficial let's put it this way instead\nof good or bad it is beneficial for the\nexpansive human being that you are it is\nsomething that is brought to you the\nchallenge the opportunity whatever it is\nto make you more of an expansive being\nto expand into a greater version of you\nnow with that being said uh there's\nnothing wrong with you and so I want to\ngo into this episode not saying like hey\ndevelop these five Hobbies because\nyou're completely screwed up that's not\nwhat I want to say I want to say develop\nthese five Hobbies so that you can\nexpand into a greater version of\nyourself okay so we're going to go\nthrough these five hobbies and I want\nyou to figure out through each of them\nyou have pen and paper you can pull it\nout and you can start jotting down what\nare these five hobbies that you want to\ncreate and just throw some ideas down as\nI'm speaking about them okay the first\nhobby is you need to create in order to\nchange your life you need one hobby to\nmake you money one hobby to making money\nwhat is something\nthat would be a fun way to make money\nnow you have to realize\nthere's many ways like there's crazy\nways to me there's over there's millions\nof millions of ways to make millions of\ndollars most people just think oh I have\nto go work for somebody else yeah you\ncan if you want but you can also make\nmoney other ways as well now people who\nlisten to my podcasts and I always get\nmessages they're like Rob I have an\nentire family I have bills I have to pay\nI have a mortgage I have car insurance\nall of this stuff I get it but can you\ndecide if you don't want to be at that\njob anymore that you will create some\nsort of transition plan to do what it is\nthat you want to do in the next few\nyears if you don't want to be doing that\nanymore or can you find a job if you do\nwant to have a job and you don't work\nfor someone else can you have a job that\nfeels fun that feels like a hobby\nso when I say you need to develop a\nhobby that makes you money\nI'll give you a couple examples off top\nof my head what I do\nfeels like a hobby like I love what I do\nif I got paid nothing to do what I do\nwhich I for years this podcast I got\npaid nothing to put this podcast on I\njust did it hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds of episodes because it just\nfelt right but it also pushed me to grow\nmyself more to learn more about humans\nand about myself so that I could\ntherefore teach it as well I love doing\nthis I love learning about humans I love\nreading about neurology and psychology\nand early childhood development and\nTrauma and how we become the people that\nwe are because then it's like a big\npuzzle that we're putting together but\ncan you find a hobby that makes you\nmoney another example I can think of\nthat's quite simple is let's say that\nyou love\nyou love making jewelry right\nthere's just something about it or maybe\nmaybe you've never even made jewelry\nbefore but there's something that feels\nintriguing to you about like you feel an\nenergetic pull towards learning about\nthis thing\nwell maybe what you do is you go you\nknow what I'm gonna go and I'm gonna\nstart you know there's jewelry making\nclasses all over there's joy making\nclasses online I'm gonna take some\njewelry making classes and I'm gonna try\nto learn how to make jewelry and you\nstart making it and you're not doing it\nfirst off because you want to make money\nyou're doing it because it's fun you're\ndoing it because it's it feels exciting\nto you to do this and so you make some\njewelry and they go you know what\nmaybe I'll start an Etsy store you start\nselling some jewelry maybe I'll go to a\nfarmer's market like the thing that I\nlove about farmers markets we go to one\nevery single Sunday is everybody there\nhas basically figured out a way to make\nmoney off of a hobby right so there's\nlike there's a bunch of different\njewelry ladies that are there and they\nmake all this different jewelry and all\nthese go buy jewelry from them there's a\nlady there that bakes the most amazing\nstuff with very low sugar and no gluten\nand no preservatives and all that stuff\nand she just loves this stuff so she's\nobsessed with it and she created a\nbusiness around it it's awesome there's\nanother guy that's there and he loves\nfarming and so we get our eggs from him\nthere's another lady that's that's there\nand her and her husband also love\nfarming they love raising cattle and\nthey have like 40 different cattle on\ntheir property and they roam freely in\ntheir butchers right so it's like they\nfound there's another guy there that\nloves coffee and so he's developed his\nown system of roasting coffee and\ncreating coffee there's another person\nthere that loves juice and so they\ncreated this incredible juice that they\nmake and so there's another guy that\nloves honey and he like bees and so he's\nliterally makes honey and he makes all\nthese different types of honey that are\nmixed with like lavender and all kinds\nof amazing stuff but what you're looking\nat\nif somebody found a hobby and then found\na way to make money off of it right so\nis there some sort of hobby out there\nthat maybe you're making money off of it\nnow maybe you're not but you feel an\nenergetic pull to learn and get better\nat this thing\nand if you can't find that thing I want\nyou to pursue it can you find a hobby\nthat can make you some money and maybe\nit becomes your full-time gig maybe it\njust becomes a thing that you do on the\nside it brings some extra revenue and\nnow you can take your kids and your\nfamily to a cool trip once a year\nbecause you put so much time into your\nhobby but you need to have one hobby\nthat makes you money the second hobby\nthat you need to have is a hobby that\nkeeps you healthy and in shape so this\ncould be many different things maybe\nit's working out but for some people\nthey just don't like working out who\nsaid\nthat in order to be healthy you have to\nwork out that's\nnot it at all maybe you love going for\njogs and you just say you know what I'm\ngoing to do this every single day that's\ngoing to keep you a lot healthier maybe\nyou do love lifting I was watching a\nthing the other day a guy was talking\nabout a study that said people over the\nage of 60 that lift heavy weights have a\nfour heavy weights twice a week have a\n40 percent less chance of dying of\nanything but old age than people who\ndon't lift weights heavy twice per week\nwhat that's crazy they just have to lift\nheavy things for a little while twice a\nweek and they have a 47 47 chance of\nliving longer than everybody else that\njust and actually getting to old age\nversus having a heart issue or having\nsome sort of issues with their body\nright\nso maybe it's going for walks maybe it's\ngoing for a jog maybe you love soccer\ncan you go and go get a part of a rec\nleague or uh go out to you if you love\nsoccer you love basketball there's like\nRec leagues there's baseball that you\ncould do there's flag football there's\nso many different Rec leagues that you\ncould join that are probably in your\narea there's some Community Center\nthere's some YMCA that you could join\nand you could use that as a way to be\nhealthy you don't ever have to step foot\nin a gym if you don't want to but can\nyou find some sort of hobby to keep you\nhealthy and in shape so that you can\nlive longer okay next hobby that was\nhobby number two\nnext hobby hobby number three is a\ncreative Outlet\nI personally believe having talked to\nthousands and thousands of people and\nCoach tons of people over you know 16\nyears now\nthat one of the things that that really\nreally restricts people's happiness in\nlife is that they don't have any\ncreative outlet they don't have any\nOutlet to put their creativity into the\nworld I personally believe that we are\ncreative beings part of the reason why\nwe are here is to create we are part of\nthis ultimate Creator and we are here to\ncreate amazing things whatever it is\nmaybe it's that you want to do painting\nmaybe it's that you love making music\nmaybe it's you love taking photos maybe\nit's you love uh editing video maybe\nthat you love maybe don't love making\nmusic but we love producing music\nwhatever it is can you find some sort of\ncreative Outlet maybe you love just\nhaving a spinning wheel and making clay\npots there's so many different ways for\nyou to have a creative Outlet so let me\nask you this question if you don't have\nthat creative Outlet is there something\ntop of mind for you that you feel an\nenergetic pull to learning more about or\ndeveloping your skills in or trying to\nbe more creative in maybe you love\nWoodworking and you're like screw it I'm\njust going to make some cool with\nwood I'm just going to build some\nfurniture around the house maybe I'll\njust build some furniture and throw it\nup online which takes number one as well\nwhich is a hobby to make you money and\nmaybe you just say you know what let me\nsee if I can figure out a way to create\nsome cool stuff\nI personally believe that every single\nhuman is creative so if someone's like\noh I'm not really that creative I don't\nthink that you're not creative I just\nthink that you haven't found the thing\nthat brings out that creativity maybe\nyou love writing and you don't realize\nit maybe you love sketching and you\ndon't realize it maybe you love painting\nand you don't realize it there's so many\ndifferent creative Outlets that you\ncould have and you just need to figure\nout which one it is for you because if\nyou're keeping in your creativity\nand you're holding all that creativity\nin it's like needing to cry and not\nletting it out it's like restricting the\nenergy inside of you and the energy\nshould be put out into the world so\nthere's Creative Energy that's blocked\nit's damned up because you haven't\nfigured out that thing that makes you\ncreative so the third one is you need to\nhave some sort of creative Outlet okay\nnext one you need to have a hobby so\nnumber four is you need to have a hobby\nto build your knowledge and improve your\nintelligence\nto build your knowledge and improve your\nintelligence for some people this might\nbe reading for some people it might be\nthat you want to go back and take some\nnight classes that's one of the cool\nthings about college one of the few\nthings in my opinion I think is school\nabout college is you can go back and\ntake night classes for pretty much\nanything that you want to learn there's\nalso skillshare you know skillshare you\ncan go online and learn pretty much\nalmost anything that you want to there's\nYouTube\nthere's so many different ways to build\nand improve your intelligence and your\nknowledge as a person I was reading a\nquote the other day\npretty wild quote I think I've mentioned\non the podcast in the past couple months\nand they said that 33 of high school\ngraduates never read another book after\ngraduating high school so if someone you\nknow lives to 88 years old and they get\nout of high school it's 18 years old for\n70 years they don't read a book that's\ncrazy and then that's 33 of high school\ngraduates 42 percent of college\ngraduates never read another book and so\nthink about this if you're trying if you\nfeel I personally believe in one of my\nmentors first mentors you always used to\nalways say this you're either green and\ngrowing or you're Brown and dying if\nyou're not growing your intelligence and\nyour knowledge base your\nif you're not green and growing you're\nBrown and dying and so you're you're\nnever in a place where you're not going\nforward\nyou're either going forward and if you\nfeel like you're stagnant stagnant is\nactually going backwards why because\nyou're going you're not just staying in\nthe exact same place you're getting\nolder and staying in the exact same\nplace you're going backwards you're not\nimproving yourself you're living the\nexact same year that you've been living\nover and over and over again since you\nwere 19 years old\nyou know so you can meet people that are\n39 but they still have the exact same\nintelligence that they did at 19.\nis that Improvement not really so can\nyou find some sort of hobby it doesn't\nhave to be just reading books there's\nmany ways to develop your knowledge and\nimprove your intelligence Can you hire a\ncoach to help you with that do you want\nto learn a language that's another way\nto improve your intelligence and do you\nwant to learn a language and then go to\nanother country and do it that way how\ncan you make sure that you're constantly\nevolving yourself in your brain because\nthe the phrase is 100 true and I've\nheard many neurologists say this if you\ndon't use it you lose it so if you're\nnot constantly trying to evolve your\nbrain\nthere's just parts of your brain they're\njust like yeah we're just going to chill\nwe're not going to do much more we're\ngoing to stay here right so have a hobby\nthat improves your knowledge in your\nintelligent your intelligence and then\nthe last one number five is a hobby to\nimprove your mindset to improve your\nmindset to improve the being that you\nare so when I say mindset I don't mean\nthe same thing as intelligence or\nknowledge when I say mindset I mean\nImprovement of the actual human that you\nare the childhood trauma that you might\nhave incurred the things that you\nhaven't overcome the relationship issues\nthat you need to improve at the issues\nwith your parents that happen when\nyou're younger and you still haven't\ntalked to them about it what do you need\nto do to improve your mindset\ndo you need to hire a coach do you need\nto read more books do you need to go to\na men's group do you need to go to a\nwomen's group you know if you happen to\nfeel like maybe\nyou know what I drink a little bit too\nmuch alcohol maybe you need to go to an\nAlcoholics Anonymous to help you with it\ncan you find some sort of uh way to\nimprove your mindset so that you are\nconstantly evolving as a human you're\nconstantly getting better because if you\nthink about this think about this for a\nsecond and some people are going to say\nwell what about one about relationships\nI think that most of your relationships\nimprove when you do all of these things\nbecause you as a human improve and so\nwhen you look at relationships that's\nvery external right majority of these\nthings happen to do with you as a person\nimproving and finding ways to improve\nand so these are the five things I think\nthat if you really want to change your\nlife you only need one Hobby in each one\nof these things something that you do\nweekly\nsomething that you do four times a week\nthree times a week whatever it is number\none is you need a hobby to make you\nmoney you need to figure that out you\nneed to make sure that you're not\nconstantly relying on somebody else\nnumber two you need a hobby that's going\nto keep you healthy and in shape number\nthree you need a hobby that is a\ncreative outlet for you number four you\nneed a hobby that builds your knowledge\nand improves your intelligence and\nnumber five you need one\nhobby to improve your mindset and if you\ndo this I guarantee you\nevolving and improving the being that\nyou are becomes fun why because hobbies\nare something that's fun to do it\ndoesn't feel like a task it doesn't feel\nlike a chore and if you work on these\nfive five hobbies and fast forward a\nyear two years five years ten years down\nthe road all five of these will help you\nbecome a better person so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me in it\nRob dial Junior r-o-b-d-i-a-l-jr\nand I'm Gonna Leave the same way I leave\nyou every single episode make a\nsubmission make someone else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an
