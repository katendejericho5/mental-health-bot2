will send\nyou an email with my tips and tricks on\nwhat I'm going to be using on myself and\nalso what I help other people with going\ninto every single week so that you can\nmaster your mindset every single week\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to fight for what you want not\nfighting for what you don't want and let\nme tell you a real quick story so you\ncan kind of understand the context of\nthis I was on a call earlier this week\nand a team member and I and the rest of\nthe team were that was there\nwe were talking about something in his\nlife and I noticed he's making these big\nswitches in his life these big\ntransitions in his life and as he was\nexplaining his goals to me and to\neveryone else that was there I noticed\nthat he kept throwing in\nsubconsciously little reasons why it was\ngoing to be hard he kept giving little\nreasons of why it might not work out uh\nsome of the challenges that could\npossibly pop up as he was going down\nthis road of trying to hit his goals and\nthen all of the reasons why he wasn't\nready and so it was about a five minute\nconversation then we were talking and\ntalking but in there there were these\nlittle teeny tiny things that he kept\nthrowing in and I was like ah this\ndoesn't the energy here of of what he's\nworking towards it doesn't feel right\nwhy why now is not the right time why he\nwasn't ready the the challenges that\ncould pass up possibly pop up and all of\nthat\nand I had to stop him and I was like hey\nman you're not going to hit your goal\nhe's like what and I was like you are\nnot going to hit your goal I can already\ntell and he's like what do you what do\nyou mean you know I'm I'm supposed to be\nthe one that's like hey you can do it I\nwas like you're not going to hit your\ngoal man he's like why do you say that I\nwas like from my viewpoint if I were to\nproject into the future and guess\nwhether or not you're going to hit your\ngoal I would say you're not going to hit\nyour goal do you want to know why that\nis and he's like yeah of course okay\nbecause every time you've given me some\nsort of strategy\nsome sort of plan you've given me a\nreally good reason on why it's not going\nto work out versus giving me the reason\nwhy you're going to overcome anything\nthat comes up so you know will there be\nobstacles that come up sure but instead\nof just giving me the obstacle that's\ngoing to come up on the way to your goal\nbecause there always will be obstacles\ngo ahead and give me right now the\nreason why you're going to overcome that\nobstacle what you're going to do to\novercome that obstacle because what\nyou're doing right now is you're finding\nall of the obstacles when you should be\nlooking for the opportunities\nthink about that for a second do you\never do that\nwhen you're setting yourself up for a\ngoal a weight loss goal a financial goal\na relationship goal a familial goal\nwhatever it is you're working towards\nsomething do you immediately start to\nthink of all of the reasons why it's\ngoing to be hard all of the reasons why\nit's not going to be possible all the\nreasons why it's not going to happen are\nyou finding all of the obstacles when\nyou should be looking at the\nopportunities\nbecause if you think of it this way if\nyou're if you've ever seen a car on the\nside of the road and it's broken down\nand then somehow somebody hits that car\nthat was not moving that was not in\ntheir Lane but they somehow ended up\nclipping the car you guys have seen that\nbefore right\nwhy is that because they're not looking\nat where they want to go they're looking\nat the crash\nyou know when you're I've said this many\ntimes before but when you're taught\nhow to drive if you're driving a race\ncar if you're taught how to how to\nactually drive a motorcycle as well they\nalways tell you to look past the crash\nlook past where it is they if you're on\na motorcycle say look through the turn\nwhere you want to go not where you\ncurrently are and so when you think of\nthat are you and your life looking at\nthe obstacles that are coming up or\ncould possibly be coming up or are you\nlooking at the opportunity\nnow will the obstacles still be there\nsure but now if we know the obstacles\nare going to be there what can we do to\nplan ahead when I used to do one-on-one\ncalls and I used to have clients one of\nthe things I would always do every\nsingle time that we would set a goal is\nI would say Okay Stacy so your goal is\nto make ten thousand dollars how do you\nthink you could possibly get in your way\nor screw it up over the next 30 days and\nthey're like what I'm like give me a\nplan of all of the ways that it could\npossibly go wrong so that we can make a\nplan so when it does go wrong or if it\ndoes go wrong then you've already got a\nplan of exactly what to do\nand so how do you figure out knowing\nyourself knowing your habitual\nTendencies to not work when things get\ntough or to give up or to talk trash to\nyourself knowing that those obstacles\nare going to come up every single time\nyou're on the road to a goal how can we\nmake sure that we start to work past\nthat because the way you do one thing is\nthe way you do everything\nit's not just that that my team member\nis finding obstacles in this company and\nthen not in the rest of his life you\nknow if it's the way you do anything is\nwe do everything so he might be you know\noh this is where I want to go these are\nthe goals that I have\nbut he starts thinking of all of the\nobstacles and those things start to hold\nhim back well he could get into a\nrelationship and there's opportunity in\nthat brand new relationship but he could\nalso see all of the obstacles in whoever\nhe gets into a relationship with right\nand those things can pop up and they can\nhinder you from actually seeing the good\nin somebody because you're starting to\nfind all of the faults in somebody too\noften so many people find faults in\nevery single thing that they do or every\nsingle thing that they're working for\nbecause it's not just something in your\nlife like one place it's happening all\nover in your life it's happening in your\nrelationship\ntapping in your bank account it's\nhappening in your company it's happening\nin the the company that you work for\nit's happening in your mindset it's\nhappening in all other places it is a\nsystemic problem that you need to\novercome so\nwhat I said to him is I said you've\ngiven me\nprobably 10 to 15 small reasons why\nit might not work out but you have not\ngiven me one good reason why it is going\nto work out not why it could work out\nwhy it's going to work out you've\nalready tried to explain to me why you\nwon't win the race\nwhen you have any put your foot on the\ngas put your foot on the line you you\nhaven't even stepped inside your feet\nright on the line then gotten your feet\nfeet down your hands down you're right\non the line for the race you haven't\neven gotten to the actual starting point\nof the race and you're already telling\nme all of the obstacles that are going\nto come up along the way\nhow often do you do that\nand he's like\nyeah man I guess I do that a lot I was\nlike do you do it all the time he's like\nyeah I think it's something that I've\njust learned along the way is that I\ndon't want to disappoint myself so what\nI do is I try to figure all the ways\nthat it could go wrong so that if it\ndoes go wrong I'm not disappointed I go\nyeah you know I kind of knew this is\ngoing to happen I see that all the time\nwith people they put all of the\nobstacles in front of them they see all\nof the obstacles so that they're not let\ndown\noh yeah this person could cheat on me\nthis person could be this way they could\nhave you know parent issues they could\nhave issues with this they could have\nissues with this and then when it pops\nup in the relationship and it goes you\nknow goes south they're like oh yeah\nwell at least I didn't get my hopes up\nbecause I already had a feeling that was\ngoing to happen and they're seeing the\nobstacles in seeing those obstacles and\nconcentrating on those obstacles are\nactually holding them back from the\nopportunity of a great relationship from\nthe opportunity of a great mindset from\nthe opportunity of a great bank account\nfrom the opportunity of a great career\nand so I was like do you do this often\nhe's like yeah you know I guess I do I\nsaid how's that been working for you if\nyou look at your entire past of finding\nall of the obstacles that could possibly\ncome in the way before you even start on\na goal\nhow's that working for you\nhe's like man if I'm being honest\nprobably not really well I said okay\nwell here's what you're going to do the\nentire team's here tell us why it's\ngoing to work tell us why you're going\nto accomplish your goals tell us about\nall of the opportunities tell me about\nhow it's such an amazing opportunity of\nthis goal that you're going for tell me\nabout what you're going to feel like\nwhen you hit this goal tell me about\nwhat it's going to feel like when you\nsee this obstacle come up and you\novercome this obstacle anyways tell me\nwhat it's going to feel like when you\nfinally follow through and you build the\nconfidence that you want because you did\nsomething that you said you're going to\ndo and he started you know okay it would\nprobably work because of this you know\nit'll probably work because of this I\nthink it'll work because of this I think\nit worked because this and started and I\nsaid okay hold on hold on stop stop\nI said hey there's no passion behind\nwhat you're saying it sounds like you're\njust giving me an answer because I asked\nyou for an answer so stop and tell me\nagain as if you're trying to sell me on\ngoing to battle with you why is this\ngoing to work make me believe why this\nis going to work could you imagine if if\nyou were a commander of an arm and\nyou're like hey guys you know\nwe could succeed because of this and we\nwe might succeed because of this and\nthere there might be some challenges but\nwe can do it right [ __ ] that no one's\ngoing to go to battle with you if you're\nlike that and so what I said is tell me\nsell me as if I'm going to battle with\nyou tell me with your words tell me with\nyour passion tell me with your body\nlanguage why is this going to work why\nare you going to hit your goals what's\nit going to feel like when you hit your\ngoals and he's like oh this is a great\nopportunity because of this and because\nof this and I'm going to do it because\nof this and this challenge is going to\ncome up and I'm going to conquer this\nChallenge and this and this and his\nwhole body language his whole tonality\nchange\nand I was like Hey pause real quick okay\neverybody on the call did you notice a\nshift in his language\neveryone's like 100 did you notice a\nshift in his tonality everyone's like\nyeah completely different did you notice\nthe shift in his body language he went\nfrom leaning back and talking about his\ngoal and what he wanted to do to sitting\nup in his chair his hands were moving\nmore his voice was more passionate and\nit sounded like something he actually\nwanted to do and he's like I if I'm\nbeing honest I literally feel different\nin my body now I was like yes that's the\ndifference between who you could act\nlike for the rest of your life or the\npersons you could step into because at\nevery moment we have an opportunity to\nfigure out what we want to focus on do\nwe want to focus on the obstacles and\nall the [ __ ] that could come up and the\nways that we could fail and failure and\nfailure and failure and failure or\ndo we want to look and say hey these are\nall of the opportunities in front of me\nthis is what it's going to feel like to\nhit that goal this is how proud I'm\ngonna be in myself this is what I'm do\nwith all the money that I make this is\nwhat I'm going to do with this and this\nand this and actually getting passionate\nabout it because all too often\nlisten carefully all too often I see\npeople fighting for their reasons why\nnot I see people fighting for their\ninsecurities they literally will go to\nbattle with somebody else as to why they\nshould keep their insecurities and they\nhave no idea they're doing this there\nwas another time this this very similar\nthing happened I was running an event\nfor our Mastermind and we were in person\nit was here in Austin\nI was like okay\num why aren't you you know how much you\nmake it per month you know and someone\nsays how much makeup per month and I\nsaid why aren't you making a million\ndollars a month\nand they're like what I was like why\naren't you making a million dollars a\nmonth I said everybody in here you\nshould be making a million dollars a\nmonth why are you not making a million\ndollars a month and I hadn't had him\nkind of sit with her for a second I said\nhonestly now let me ask you guys a\nquestion who here feels triggered by me\ntelling you that you should be making a\nmillion dollars a month a couple people\nraised their hand I called one of them\nout\nI was like okay go ahead and stand up\ntell us the reasons why you feel\ntriggered and it was so funny because my\nmy goal was to try to trigger somebody\ninside of the crowd so that I could show\nhow people fight for their insecurities\nand she's like I can't do this because\nof this and I can't do it because of\nthat and I can't do it because of this\nand I can't do it because of that and\nyou know it just started getting real\npissed and she's like and you know\nyou're my coach and you're not doing a\nmillion dollars a month every single\nmonth so how am I supposed to be doing\nwhy aren't you doing it why aren't you\nand she was super triggered by it and I\nwas like okay\ncool I said go ahead and take a deep\nbreath take a deep breath and I say okay\ndo you feel that inside of your body\nshe's like yeah I'm kind of pissed and I\nwas like perfect\nwhy are you fighting for your\ninsecurities more than you're fighting\nfor your reasons why why are you\nfighting for your reasons why not why\nare you fighting for the reasons why\nit's not going to work out more than I'm\ngoing to succeed no matter what no\nmatter what happens I'm going to get to\nwhere I want to go why are you triggered\nby you should be making a million\ndollars a month but you're not triggered\nby you know you should be making twenty\nthousand dollars a month because you're\nalready there because you're already\nthere and by going there's a part of you\nthere's an egoic part of you that goes\ntwenty thousand to a million\nI can't do that there's I can't do it I\nwould love to it'd be great but I can't\nand what happens is this is our ego\nour conditioned self the self that wants\nto sustain the the comfort zone that\nwe're in in the exact same spot that\nwe're in wants us to stay where we are\nso what does it want to do it wants for\nsearch for all of the reasons why you\ncan't do it so that you can justify how\nyou're going to stay exactly where you\nare so that you can justify living a\nmediocre life instead of stepping into\nyour full potential\nyou're fighting for your insecurities do\nyou see how you're fighting for your\ninsecurities and it was like it's like I\nlifted the veil and she was like she\nwent from like real trigger to like oh\n[ __ ] I'm I'm standing up\nin front of these people passionately\nselling them on why I'm not gonna do it\nthink about that for a second she was\nselling us on why she wasn't gonna she\nwas selling us on her insecurity she was\nselling us on her fears she was selling\nus on her limiting beliefs with passion\nI said why don't you vote why don't you\ngo and sell me passionately on something\nthat you can do\nsell me on why it is possible for you\nand what happened it was like everyone\nwas able to see this this shift and for\neverybody was like oh my God I she's not\nthe only one I do this all the time too\nI fight for my insecurities all of the\ntime I fight for my insecurities in many\ndifferent places in my life\nand so then I was like all right well\nlet's work through it what do you need\nto do to get past these insecurities\nwhat do you need to do to believe in\nyourself more than you believe in your\nfears what do you need to do believe in\nyourself more than you believe in your\ninsecurities because what happens is the\nbrain will naturally go to negative\nI have a belief I've worked with\nthousands and thousand people\nthat for the majority of people like 99\nof people\nif you just leave somebody to to go\nafter something they'll naturally go\ntowards negative at some point in time\nso we have to be intentional about\nfinding the positive because your\nbrain's automatically going to go to all\nthe reasons why not\nwe need to be intentional and notice and\nhave be very self-aware you need to\nstart noticing this and being\nintentional to become very self-aware of\noh I'm doing again I'm selling myself\nonline I shouldn't be doing it I need to\nsell myself on why I should be doing\nthis I need to sell myself on why it's\npossible why this is going to work\nversus why it's not going to work I need\nto start selling myself on all of the\nreasons why I'm going to succeed versus\nselling myself on all of my fears and\ninsecurities and going to battle for my\nreasons why not and start going to\nbattle for my reasons why I'm going to\nmake it happen\nso naturally if we know the brain is\ngoing to go negative we have to be very\ndiligent and very intentional to make\nsure that we take ourselves out of it\nlike one of the biggest misconceptions\nthat I get from people is like man rob\nmust be positive all day long you must\njust wake up and you know [ __ ] rainbows\nand hang out with unicorns like it's\njust an amazing life no I've developed\nthese strategies because I'm human I\nnotice myself being very negative and I\nnotice myself I was like the best excuse\nmaker I was very pessimistic for most of\nmy life and then I realized this isn't\nhelping me get anywhere that I want to\ngo if I'm going to get to where I want\nto go I'm going to have to work through\nthis I'm going to have to get past this\ninsecure I'm gonna have to get past all\nof this BS and so the thing that I want\nyou to start focusing on is to start\nselling yourself on why it's going to\nwork versus selling yourself on\ninsecurities\nsell yourself on why it's important for\nyou to work hard and create the life\nthat you want to the relationship that\nyou want to the business that you want\nto the bank account that you want to the\nbody that you want to creating all of\nthose things versus all of the reasons\nwhy you have your fears and insecurities\nand all of those are true because\nultimately we have the choice we can\neither go down the positive route or we\ncould go down the negative route it's\ncompletely up to us it's like the story\nof the uh the Native American Native\nAmerican boy that goes up to his\ngrandfather's a chief and his chief\ntells him the story that there's two\nthere's two wolves that live inside of a\nhuman and one of them\nis the bad wolf which is fear and\ninsecurities and jealousy and all of\nthat why you're you know all of the\nfears the jealousies and insecurities\nthe limiting beliefs that's the bad wolf\non the other side inside of us we have\nthe good wolf which is Joy love\nhappiness believing in yourself and the\nlittle boy says Well which one wins the\nbattle and his grandfather says\nwhichever one you feed\nso you've got to ask yourself on a daily\nbasis what wolf are you feeding are you\nfeeding the good wolf are you feeding\nthe bad wolf because ultimately which\none you feed the one that you\nconcentrate more on is going to succeed\nin the long run and become who you are\nso ultimately the choices\ndo you want to fight for your reasons\nwhy or do you want to fight for your\nreasons why not do you want to fight for\nthe good wolf or do you want to fight\nfor the bad wolf\nI can't make you do it nobody else can\nmake you do it you're the only one\ninside of your head you have to decide\nthat you're going to be very diligent\nself-aware and intentional about\ncreating the mindset that you want so\nthat you can create the life that you\nwant so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on
