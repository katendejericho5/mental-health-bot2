    "transcript": "ladies and gentlemen let's talk about\nhow to improve your confidence and how\nto have more self-love because\nthere's no way to have confidence and\nhate yourself\nthere is no way and i hear this so often\nwhen people like well how do i have more\nconfidence how do i have more confidence\nwell let's dive into it why is self-love\nso important because it either helps\nyour confidence or it hurts your\nconfidence very simple you cannot hate\nyourself and have this amazing\nconfidence you're not going to have\nconfidence you're going to have you know\na\na mask of confidence that isn't actually\ntrue in front of you\nwe know some people when they fully love\nand accept themselves they end up\nbecoming some of the most confident\npeople that you'll come across\nso the reason why that's important is\nbecause\nif you're confident it's very easy to\ntake action\nif you're confident in yourself and your\nabilities and who you are it is very\neasy to take action to create the life\nthat you want to but if you are not\nconfident\nit's really hard to take action if\nyou're not confident in your abilities\nwhy would you ever do the hard stuff why\nwould you ever take action towards the\nlife that you want because you're\nthinking in the back your head\ni don't even know if i'm gonna get it\nbut this also affects the way that you\nfeel\nit also affects the way that you carry\nyourself\nthe way that you walk into a room the\nway that you answer the phone the way\nthat you ask somebody out the way that\nyou ask somebody for an order if you're\na salesperson it affects you in every\nsingle way that you could possibly think\nof it will then in turn affect uh if you\ndo or do not find a significant other\nthat you want it will then\naffect every interaction that you have\nwith other people it'll affect you in\nevery single place so when you hear\nabout it you're like oh self-love that\nsounds real cutesy well yeah sure it\ncould but really what it comes down to\nis you getting the life that you want to\nyou getting the partner that you want to\nyou getting the success the happiness\nthe peace the love all of those things\nthat you want to or not\nbecause ultimately\nyou're going to attract somebody who is\nmost likely on the same level as you\nwho is very similar to you in a lot of\ndifferent ways and if you're not\nconfident you won't be able to attract\nthe person that you truly want because\nyour energy just won't match and men i\nknow you can relate to this to attract a\na badass confident awesome woman you\nhave to have another level of confidence\nconfident women don't go for unconfident\nmen\nright so it all comes back to self-love\nthem\nso in today's episode i'm going to be\nteaching you some tips on how to have\nmore self-love and in turn that will\nturn into more confidence but\nimagine with me for a moment i want to\ntake you through\njust a\nhypothetical situation which is\nhypothetical but then at the same time\nalso still happens too much\nimagine a child\nwho the whole time that they live with\ntheir parents they're talked down to\ntheir entire lives they're told that\nthey're stupid they're told that they're\nworthless they're told that they're\nunlovable\nthey're told they'll never amount to\nanything\nday in day out day in day out they are\ntold this most of the day throughout the\nday\nby their parents by people around them\nby their family\nstupid worthless unlovable never amount\nto anything it's terrible isn't it but\nit happens\ndo you just think about for a second how\nwounded do you think that child is going\nto be when they get older\nquite wounded right do you think that\nthat will affect them in some sort of\nway\nyeah of course do you think that it will\naffect their confidence\nsure do you think it'll affect what they\nbelieve in themselves when they grow up\nyes of course\nyou could see that right you could\nunderstand it it all makes sense to you\ni've got a very important question what\nthe is a difference then between\nyou and that child\nnothing\ndon't think that because you're older\nthat something is different\nbut there's a difference between that\nyou know a little bit of a difference\nbetween that child\nand you\nthat child\ntheir abuser is somebody else\nfor a lot of people listening you\nare your own abuser\nyou're the person saying you're\nworthless you're the person who says\nyou're unlovable you're the person that\nsays you'll never amount to anything the\nabuser is you\nthat child can walk away eventually they\ncan move out of the house and a lot of\ntimes when you have live in an abusive\nsituation they do end up leaving\nbut you can't walk out of your own head\nso you are in your own mental prison of\ntalking trash to yourself a lot of times\ni've been here before i know many people\nhave been here before and they think\nthat by some way\ni don't know why they're helping\nthemselves to improve when they talk to\nthemselves talk down to themselves\nif you talk negatively down to yourself\nyou talk down to yourself you are your\nabuser\nand i always give this example if you've\nbeen listening to me for years you've\nheard me say this before\nbut my friend jay shetty did this really\ngreat video a few years ago where he sat\ndown with these ladies they were in\ntheir 20s and 30s and he said hey here's\na pen and paper i want you to write down\nall of the things that you say to\nyourself all the negative things you say\nto yourself whatever they are just write\nthem down and they were writing them\ndown they were writing them down made\nthis big huge list of all these negative\nthings\nhe said okay can you come with me for a\nsecond and he takes them into a\ncompletely different room and in that\nother room is their little sisters so\nthese women are in like their 20s and\n30s and they have these sisters that are\nlike eight to twelve probably\nhe has that they have that piece of\npaper in front of me said okay now i\nwant you to go ahead and i want you to\nsay to them what you wrote down\nand the look on these women's faces were\nlike appalled\nno i would never\ntalk to my little sister that way i\nwould never\ntalk to her that way\nokay well why do you talk to yourself\nthat way\nwhat's the difference\nis there a difference not really because\nif you beat yourself up and beat\nyourself up and beat yourself up and\nbeat yourself up\nof course your confidence is going to be\nlow of course your self love is going to\nbe low why would you ever talk to\nyourself\nthat way when you wouldn't talk to\nsomeone that you love that way you would\nnever talk to someone that you love the\nway that you talk to yourself in your\nhead sometimes\nright another example i always love to\ngive because it just makes so much sense\nimagine your best friend called you\nshe calls you up she was she had this\nfirst date she was about to go on and\nyou're like hey call me when you get\ndone i want to hear about it she's all\nexcited about this little date that she\nfound maybe it's a blind date they've\nnever seen each other\nshe shows up at the date\nshe calls you after and you're all\nexcited to hear the story so you answer\nthe phone you're like hey how'd it go\nand she's like well\nyou know\nhe was really nice he was real cute he\nwas awesome i was really starting to\nlike him\nand then just in the middle of the date\nhe was like listen i don't think this is\ngoing to work out maybe we should just\nstay friends\nwould you ever say to her well\nyou know what stacey that does kind of\nmake some sense she's like what that\ndoes make sense\nbecause you have been put you you have\nbeen putting on like\nputting on a little bit of weight\nyou want the smartest person world\nyou're actually pretty stupid um you\nknow you're getting older\nyou're a little bit more wrinkly than\nused to be a little bit more chunky than\nused to be\nyou're pretty stupid\nand um at the same time i think you're\npretty unlovable\nwould you ever say that to your friend\nwho is going through all of this stuff\nof this guy that she was just liking on\nthis date you never say that right so\nwhy\ndo people say that to themselves why do\nyou say that type of stuff to yourself\nyou know when you go in and you go on a\ndate and then the person is interested\nand you're like god it makes sense\nbecause you're stupid because you're\nfats because you're unlovable it's\nbecause you put on some weight because\nyou're getting older\ni'm sure there's somebody prettier out\nthere that he would want to go for\nright why do you do that to yourself if\nyou wouldn't do it to a friend\nit doesn't make any sense you know if\nyou don't get the promotion that you\nwant to are you like god it's because\nyou're stupid it's because you don't you\nneed to get your together it's\nbecause you don't you're not good in\nfront of people you know you're just\nstupid you're never gonna be able to\namount to any to anything this is how a\nlot of people talk to themselves in\ntheir head you might be one of them\nbut the question that i have for you is\nwhat and who is that benefiting\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you love this video please hit\nthe like button it helps more than you\nknow and if you want to see more videos\nlike this hit the subscribe button so\nthat you could see some more and get\nnotified the next time i post\nwhat good is going to come from that i\nhave so i have a really great friend of\nmine who used to just be the worst\nat talking trash to herself all of the\ntime and when she would tell me the\nstuff that she would say i was like what\nyou say that to yourself\nyou know how terrible that is no wonder\nwhy her confidence was so so low\nand over time it's been about three\nyears she's been on this self-love\njourney and really what she's been doing\nshe's been growing and working on\nherself she's done to be honest she's\ndone some psychedelic journeys you know\nshe's done mushrooms she's on ayahuasca\nshe's done some other stuff not saying\nthose are necessary but does just tell\nme what she's worked on\nread a bunch of books hired her own\ncoach started working on herself and\nrealized over time she started to let\nthose go because they weren't helping\nher in any sort of way\nbut she used to look at herself in the\nmirror and just talk so much trash\nright so what do you say when you look\nin the mirror\ndo you look at yourself and you're like\ndamn you're looking fat you got another\nlump\nyou know you're getting a little bit\nchunky\ncan't fit into your jeans anymore\nyou know even if you are fit you're like\nyeah you're just ugly your hair looks\nlike like what do you say to\nyourself when you're in the looking in\nthe mirror\nor do you look at yourself you're like\ndamn you're looking good hey you know\nwhat you got a little bit extra weight\nbut you are in the process of getting\nthe best shape of your life i believe in\nyou i know you can do this i love you\nthere was a time\nwhen i\ni didn't know that i had self-love\nissues when i was younger but i do\nremember\ni was probably about 20 21 years old and\nwe had this guy come and speak to us at\nthe the company that i worked at he said\nif you want to see massive changes in\nyour life\njust go ahead and tell yourself i love\nyou in the mirror every single day a\nhundred times\nand at that point in time i was broke\nhad no success and i was like i'll do\nwhatever the hell anybody successful\ntells me to do so i was like okay i'll\njust do it\nso i would just sit there and i would\nsay you know you look yourself in the\neye and you're like i love you i love\nyou i love you and it gets kind of\nawkward and you're like why am i so\nawkward i'm literally just talking to\nmyself this is interesting you start to\nnotice things about yourself\nand\nwhat happens is you start to do it over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain what you start to realize is that\nyour story in your head if you do talk\nnegatively to yourself slowly starts to\nchange because the i love you is\nstarting to literally be so much heavier\nthere's so much more there's a hundred\nof those every single day\ncompared to all the other stuff that you\nsay\nand over time over and over and over and\nover again you're starting to get a real\nreprogramming of your own mind\nbecause all too often what happens is we\nget caught up in caught up in comparison\nversus being like hey i just love you\nthe way that you are\nbut the problem with comparison and\nseeing the other people on instagram and\nseeing what other people's lives are is\ncomparison is the thief of all joy\nyou know it's not that you don't love\nyour body you don't love your body\nbecause you're looking on instagram you\nknow you tell yourself you you know\nyou're getting fat because you're\ncomparing yourself to a photoshop model\non instagram\nyou know you talk trash to yourself\nbecause\nyour friend from high school who you\nhaven't seen in 16 years just bought a\nmassive house\nor\nyou know you're pissed off that you're\ndriving a you know 17 year old kia\nand you're thinking about the 18 year\nold bitcoin millionaire who's putting up\npictures of his you know brand new\nlamborghini and you're stuck in this\ncomparison and comparison is not a bad\nthing\ndepends on what you're comparing that's\nwhat actually matters so people are like\ncomparison is so terrible well it\ndepends on what you're comparing humans\ncompare you know if you think of where\nthis goes back to years and years you\nknow 100 000 years ago\nif we see\nan animal\nflying at us from a distance the big\nhuge animal on the ground running\ntowards us we need to compare okay how\nbig is that animal compared to me is it\nsmaller than me is there something to be\nworried about how fast is this animal\ncoming do i need to run from it do i\nhave enough time to run from it do i\nneed to run up a tree instead of run\nfrom this animal in a different\ndirection\nand comparison is something that\nactually kept us alive in some ways\nit still exists nowadays but it doesn't\nmean that we need to compare ourselves\nwith other people and then make\nourselves feel like crap because that\nsort of comparison is the thief of all\njoy\nso\nwhen you look at your life\nyou are where you are\nthat's a fact you weigh as much as you\nweigh that's a fact your bank account\nhas as much as it has that's a fact\nyou can't change\nthat in any way right now the only thing\nyou can change is where you go from here\nforward\nwhat you do from here to the next moment\ni do know one fact\nit will be a lot harder to go to the gym\nto stop procrastinating to work hard on\nyourself when you feel like crap and\nguess what when you talk trash to\nyourself\ndoesn't that make you feel like crap\nso if you actually want to change\nyourself you should probably be on your\nyour own side you should probably start\nmotivating yourself start talking better\nyourself\nbut you have to start thinking about\nthis\nhow much better do you feel\nwhen you talk better to yourself how\nmuch better do you feel when you think\nbetter of yourself how much better do\nyou feel when you get like\nyou know i can give example for for a\nguy ladies i'm sure you have the exact\nsame example but in a different way\nbut men probably know this feeling i\nknow that when i have like a really nice\nsuit and i go out i feel differently\nabout myself\nwhat if you felt that way\nall of the time how could you bring that\nin more\nhow does that make you feel to be like\nthat could you do more of that for\nyourself imagine if you had that feeling\nall day imagine what you could do if you\nhad that feeling all day because\nultimately you have to be your biggest\nfan\nyou have to be when no one else believes\nin you you have to believe in yourself\nyou have to be your biggest fan but most\npeople are the biggest critic\nand being your biggest critic is not\ngoing to help you in any sort of way you\nhave to get on your own side be your\nbiggest fan and when you do that you'll\nstart to have more people come on to\nyour side and be a big fan of yours\nyou know like i used to always do talks\nand there's one thing i used to do it's\nreally interesting\nwhen i really started to see that a lot\nof people had self-love issues\nis i used to give talks and i'd be in\nfront of everybody and say okay i'm\ngonna give you 60 seconds\ni want you to write down everything\nthat's not good about yourself that you\ndon't like about yourself everything you\nhate about yourself ready set go and\npeople would like\nfuriously write so many things what they\ndon't like they like their hair they\ndon't like their ass they don't like\ntheir legs they don't like how they fit\nin jeans they don't like blah blah blah\nthey like their intelligence love all\nkinds of things\nmassive lists of all the things they\ndon't like about themselves\nokay time's up 60 seconds\npeople would have these huge lists it\nwas crazy and i'd say okay\nanother 60 seconds go ahead and write\ndown everything that you love about\nyourself\nit was like crickets\npeople come up like four things they\ncome up with like 75 things on the\nthings they hate about themselves 34\nthings about things they hate about\nthemselves they come up like four things\nthey love about themselves\npeople are too busy focusing on the\nthings they don't like about themselves\nversus the things they do like about\nthemselves when you love something you\nwant to help it and you want to improve\nit if you don't love yourself you don't\nwant to help yourself and improve\nyourself if you hate your body\nyou can change your body by hating it or\nyou can love your body so much that you\nwant to take better care of it\nif you focus on you will get more\n there's actually\nthe rock hazard quote\nand the quote is when you focus on you\nyou grow when you focus on\ngrows and you got to start thinking to\nyourself what am i focusing on\nthroughout the day\nyou know and make a list do this for\nyourself if you want to try to help\nyourself get rid of these things make a\nlist of all of the things that you shade\nyourself all of your fears all of your\nlimiting beliefs all the things you hate\nabout yourself\nmake this massive list look at it take a\nlighter and set it on fire\nnow you know\nmake sure you do this in a safe place\nthrow it inside of a you know your\nbathtub or whatever it is don't burn\nyour house down and blame me for your\nhouse burning down but look at all of\nyour fears write them all down get\neverything down on pen and paper take a\npen and paper write it all down and then\ntake your lighter and light it on fire\nand tell yourself that's the last time\nthat i can say that to myself from now\non i'm going to be my best friend from\nnow on i'm going to be my biggest fan\nand not my biggest critic from now on\ni'm going to talk positively to myself\nbecause i need someone in my corner\nall day every day and that needs to be\nme\nbecause ultimately what you focus on you\nget more of focus on you you'll get more\ngrowth if you focus on you'll get\nmore"
