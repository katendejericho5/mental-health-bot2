    "transcript": "today i'm going to talk to you about how\namazing life is and how [ __ ]\nincredible this human experience is\nand how we tend to just take it all for\ngranted and my goal for today's episode\nis to help you reframe your mindset in\nsome sort of way and to help you go\nthrough today with much more gratitude\nafter listening to this episode than if\nyou hadn't listened to this episode now\nbefore we go into it i do want to say\nthis i'm not saying\nwhen i say life is amazing i'm not\nsaying that life is perfect\ni'm not saying that there isn't some bad\nstuff that goes on in the world i'm not\nsaying that there are it's it's just\nthis perfect you know uh oasis that the\nworld is no there's things happening\nthere's good things happening there's\nbad things happening there's always good\nthings and bad things happening there\nalways have been and there always will\nbe but what i'm more of what i'm talking\nabout is how we can start to live our\nlives with more gratitude\nevery single day if we can live our life\nif you can live your life today\nwith one percent more gratitude than you\ndid when you woke up\nthen that's a win and if you can wake up\ntomorrow and have more gratitude one\npercent more gratitude tomorrow than you\ndid today then that is a win and i\nremember watching a comedian talk about\nthis like 10 years ago and he was\ntalking about how everything is amazing\nand nobody's happy\nand what he was explaining is he was\nexplaining the first flight that he had\nbeen on when wi-fi on planes came out\nbecause at one point there was no such\nthing as wi-fi on planes right and this\nis like 10 years ago and everyone was so\nexcited they were finally going to be\nable to\nbe on a plane for hours and hours and\nstill be connected to the internet and\nabout halfway through you know 20 30\nminutes into the flight the wi-fi stops\nworking\nso the stewardess gets on stewart is\nlike i'm so sorry everybody this is this\nit completely went out we're gonna try\nour best to fix it and the guy next to\nhim is like this is [ __ ]\nright and he he was talking about how\ncrazy it is\nthat this guy that was next to him\nwas so mad about something that he\ndidn't know existed 20 minutes ago as if\nthe world owed him something and you\nknow another thing that people tend to\ndo he talks about is that people tend to\nact like\nbeing on an airline is the worst thing\nlike when you pick somebody up from\ntraveling and you're like how's your day\nlike oh god it was just such a long day\nof travel\nand how you know oh my gosh i had to be\non a plane for five hours and he talks\nabout how you know the\nnew york to la takes five hours it used\nto take 30 years\nand you know a bunch of people would die\nalong the way and a bunch of people\nwould have babies and if if you went\nfrom new york to l.a by the time you got\nto l.a it was a completely different\ndifferent group of people and you were\n30 years older now it takes five hours\nand people like oh my god we were\ndelayed on the runway first for 30\nminutes\neverybody in every single flight should\nbe sitting in their chair like holy [ __ ]\nthis is amazing you're literally sitting\non a chair in the sky but what we do\nis we get used to things and then when\nwe get used to things we start to find\nthe negative in things because naturally\nhuman minds tend to go a little bit\nnegative and you know one thing that i\nthink is really important for us to\nthink about\nis you know i always hear people talk\nabout oh my god but you know phones are\nso addicting and technology's getting\ncrazy and it's really starting to screw\nthings up technology's not screwing\nanything up people are screwing it up\nlike take your cell phone for instance\nright think of all of the things i\nremember when i was a kid you know i was\nborn in the 80s so i've seen\nfrom what before cell phones were really\naround before they blew up into what\nthey are now before the iphone before\nyou know all of the smartphones came out\ni remember what the world was like and\nif you look at your phone and you look\nat how your phone has replaced so many\nthings that she used to have to buy it's\nquite incredible right so when you look\nat your phone you'd be like oh my god\nthis thing is so addicting or you could\nbe like this thing is a camera this\nthing is a camcorder if for those of you\nguys that aren't old enough there used\nto be cameras and there used to be\ncamcorders they weren't the same thing\nyou used to be able to take pictures on\none thing and then you used to be able\nto take videos on another thing but they\nweren't the same thing you know that it\nreplaces the radio it replaces cds it\nreplaces your phone replaces books your\nphone replaces calculators your phone\nreplaces a\nvoice recorder\nwhat else does it replace it replaces\ngps it replaces a flashlight it replaces\na scanner it replaces a leveler it\nreplaces a compass your phone replaces a\nvideo game console a credit card because\nyou can literally check out from your\nphone nowadays\nit replaces your alarm clock it replaces\na stopwatch it replaces a timer it\nreplaces a calendar replaces a notepad\nit replaces a photo album replaces you\nknow\nnewspaper it replaces you know there's\nguitar tuners now you can you can use\nyour phone as a remote control for your\ntv\nuh some cars start from phones now it\nreplaces car keys\nand and if that's not impressive enough\nit has all of the knowledge that mankind\nhas ever known through google and the\ninternet\nso we can sit back and we can look at\nthese things and be like oh my god\ntechnology's so terrible which cool i\nguess it can be if you want to look at\nit through that lens or you can look and\nbe like holy [ __ ]\nlife is amazing there's so many\nincredible things that humans as we\nprogress and technology as it progresses\nso many incredible things that we get\nthat we've never had before it's\nliterally the most amazing thing when\nyou actually stop you take yourself out\nof your day-to-day and you start to look\naround at the world\nand you start to look around it at\neverything humans have created and\ntechnology and it's the most incredible\npiece of machinery if you look at the\nphone\nbut you're not supposed to be addicted\nto it you can become addicted to it\nbecause it is so amazing but you're\nletting it be what it is it's a great\nservant but it's a terrible master but\nyou have to decide as the adult as the\nhuman how you want to use it\nbut if you look at it and you just think\nabout\nthis thing is an incredible piece of\ntechnology\nyou're probably listening to me on it\nright now that's a pretty incredible\nthing if you actually start to think\nabout it and so you literally start to\ntake a second and you realize oh my god\nlike things are pretty amazing\nif you think about like one of the\nthings i was thinking about when we were\ntraveling to italy last year\nthere was a time when there was no such\nthing as security\nnow there's a time where there's not\njust such thing as security but i could\nbe you know eating a croissant and\nhaving a cappuccino\noverlooking a beautiful fountain in rome\nitaly and i can get a notification that\nsomebody is dropping off a package in my\nfront yard from thousands of miles away\nand i can talk to the amazon guy through\nmy security camera and ask him where to\nleave my package\nthat's pretty incredible if you think\nabout it if you think about like text\nmessages there was a point\nwhere people used to write letters\nlike my grandparents met each other\ndated for a couple months my grandfather\nwent off to world war ii and they\nliterally wrote each other letters\nnow we can send a text message somebody\ngets it like a half a second on the\nother side of the world that's pretty\namazing isn't it\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you love this video please hit\nthe like button it helps more than you\nknow and if you want to see more videos\nlike this hit the subscribe button so\nthat you could see some more and get\nnotified the next time i post\nwe still have all the letters they wrote\neach other we they had to write each\nother letters so my grandma would\nliterally write to my grandfather it\nwould take a few weeks for it to get to\nhim\nhe would then get it and mind you she\ndidn't even know if he was still alive\nbecause there wasn't that much of a\nresponse they weren't really able to\ncall back home back then and so she's\nwriting to this guy it'd take a few\nweeks for him to get it he would finally\nget it he'd write her a letter and be a\nfew weeks back so she would send him a\nmessage and not hear back from like a\nmonth to six weeks\nthat's pretty incredible if you think\nabout the fact that i can send a text\nmessage from my phone and it'll get to\nsomebody on the other side of the world\nin a second\nthat's pretty incredible right so\nthere's so many amazing things\nthat if we just take ourselves out of\nour head and we look at we're like man\nuh yeah this is pretty amazing like\nthere's so many incredible things that\nare around me could life be better\nsure could i have\nmore of this and more of that and less\nstress and you know more happiness and\nall that sure of course they can but at\nthe same time we can also take ourselves\nout of our lives look at it and be like\ndamn\ni should be really grateful for all that\ni have i don't take enough time to be\ngrateful for every single thing that i\nhave was the last time that you woke up\nand you know enjoyed your cup of coffee\nand looked at your house or your\napartment and realized that what you\nhave now\nis what you probably wanted 5 10 15\nyears ago have you ever thought about\nthat one like you 10 years ago like if i\njust take myself as an example myself 10\nyears ago would see what i have now and\nbe like holy crap\ni want that so bad me 15 years ago when\ni was living off of pasta for two months\nbecause i was so broke and i was five\nmonths behind on my car payment would\nlook at the life i have now and be like\nholy [ __ ] that is the most incredible\nlife ever\nand then sometimes i wake up and i'm\nstill not as grateful as i could be\nright what about you think of your life\nit might be great right now it might be\ngood it might be pretty good it might be\nterrible whatever it is\nit's still amazing if you're listening\nto me right now think about this for a\nsecond if you're listening to me right\nnow the quality of your life is right\nnow\na hundred times better\nthan a king or queen's life was\n500 years ago\nthink about that for a second like how\nincredible is that to realize that your\nlife right now is probably a hundred\ntimes better than a king or queen 500\nyears ago and we're still sitting around\nand we're like my ac doesn't get as cold\nas i want it to\nright we have food we have water we have\nshelter we have a couple people that\nlove us and we're like but i want more i\nwant more things i want to put more\nclothes in my closet i want to get a\nnicer car in my garage i want to have a\nnicer house i want to move out of this\napartment because it's not as nice as i\nwant it to be\ntake a second to take yourself out of it\nand realize how amazing things actually\nare\nbecause here's the thing that's the\nsecret to the universe that i've come to\nfind\ni don't come to i don't try to act like\ni know how the universe works or that\ni'm smart enough to understand all of\nthis stuff but you will not be given\nmore than you currently have if you\ncan't be grateful for what you currently\nhave\nit's just i've i've never seen someone\nthat that works this way you will not be\nable to have more\nthan you currently have if you are not\ngrateful for what you currently have\nit's like a child that just constantly\ncomplains if a child complains you and\ncomplains you complains to you are you\ngonna want to give that child more or\nyou can be like this kid sucks\nright so if you're constantly\ncomplaining to god or the universe and\ncomplaining and complaining and playing\ncomplaining\nit's gonna be the same thing where it's\nlike looking at that child and be like\nthis child sucks this i've given this\nchild so much and this child is not\ngrateful for it\nright the universe or god is not going\nto trust you with more until you become\na good steward for what you already have\nso if you look at what you have and\nyou're not as grateful as you could be\nis there room for opportunity there\nbecause here's an interesting thing what\nyou focus on you will get more of\nwhat you focus on you will get more of\nif you focus on how you're not happy and\nyou don't have what you want you don't\nhave the relationship that you want or\nthe bank account that you want and this\nis going wrong and this is going wrong\nand this is going wrong and this is\ngoing wrong if you're searching for\nwhat's going wrong and what the problems\nare in your life you will always find\nmore things forever that are going wrong\nyou will always find more things to be\noffended by you'll always find more\nthings that are not the way that you\nwant them to be that's just the way that\nit works what you focus on will grow\nbut\nif you take yourself out of your head\nand say maybe i should actually try to\nbe a little bit more grateful for what i\nhave because i do have a lot more than i\never have before\nthings are going pretty well they're\ngoing better than they were a few a few\nmonths ago\nif you take a second and you focus on\nall of the things that you have that\nyou'd be grateful for then you might not\nyou might be sitting like i don't have\nmuch yeah well you've still got more if\nyou're listening to me you've still got\nmore than probably 95 percent of people\nin the world right there are there are\npeople\nwho would love to have your life\nand we're sitting here and we're like\ni don't have enough i want more\nright think about that for a second\nthere are people in this world that\nwould literally do anything to have the\nlife that you have and you might not\nthink that it's the best thing in the\nworld but there's some people on the\nother side of the world that would love\nto literally just have what you have and\nthey don't want anything more\nif you focus on the fact that you have\nso much to be grateful for\nit's really weird how it works out but\ngod the universe whatever it is that\nhappens to be out there is like hey\nyou've been grateful for this let me\ngive you a little bit more you've been\ngrateful for this let me give you more\nto be grateful for you've been great for\nthis let me give you a little bit more\nto be grateful for so if you constantly\nfocus on what you don't have you will\nget in what you want you will always\nfind more things that you want right if\nyou want more money money is just\nnumbers you're just\nnumbers never end there'll always be\nmore that you could get a trillion\ndollars well there's always 2 trillion\nthere's always 3 trillion 10 trillion it\ngoes on and on and on if you're\nconstantly searching\nfor your happiness in numbers and things\nexternally outside of you you'll never\nbe happy but if you start to actually\nlook around you and be grateful for what\nyou have you'll start to realize that\nyou'll get more things you become a\ngreat steward of what you have you'll be\nable to have more things to be grateful\nfor and more things to be grateful for\nand so really what i want you to realize\nfor the rest of today\nwhen you turn this podcast off when you\ngo into your life when you go into your\noffice when you go back and hang out\nwith your kids just take a quick second\nbreathe and look around you and realize\nthat what you have now\nsome people would kill for what you have\nnow is what you wanted 10 years ago what\nyou have now is more than you've ever\nhad and life will continue to get better\nwhen you start to focus on all that you\nhave and all that all the things that\naround you you have to be grateful for\nif you find things to be grateful for\nyou will be given more things to be\ngrateful for but if you find things that\nare problems you will always find more\nproblems as well what you focus on\nexpands so be very very careful with\nwhat it is that you're using your\ndelicate\nenergy and mental power to focus on\nbecause what you focus on you will get\nmore of and you've got so much to be\ngrateful for"
