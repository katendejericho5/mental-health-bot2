    "transcript": "today i'm going to be teaching you one\nsimple secret to success and this is\nsomething that i pretty much never hear\nanybody talk about\nand one thing that has definitely helped\nme in my 16 years of business and 16\nyears of personal development when i\nfirst started my own business i was 19\nyears old i was about to turn 20 and i'm\n36 now and when i was younger i will\ntell you that i was go go go go go go i\nneed to build i need to build i need to\nbuild i need to go i need to work i need\nto work i need to work my ass off\nnothing else matters you know i i know\nwhat i want i'll give you an idea when i\nturned 21 i started and had\nmoved to a different territory to open\nup a franchise with this company\ni was 21 years old lived in florida and\nwas finally of the drinking age and i\nwas like you know what instead of going\nand partying on the beach with my\nfriends and all of the the girls that\ncome down from up north i'm gonna go\nahead and start my own business i was\nthat obsessed with growing a business\nand becoming successful that i was like\nthis is the one thing that i'm going to\ndo everything else will come later on in\nlife and i thought\nto be successful i had to be go-go-go at\nall times i thought i had to be working\nat all times and from you know 21 to\nabout 25 i worked about 110 hours a week\ni was either i was 7 a.m to about 9 to\n11 p.m\nevery single day\nseven days a week no days off no\nvacation 7 a.m\nto 9 to 11 p.m depending on the day\nevery single day a lot of my times i\nwould get into my office before the sun\nrose\ni would leave my office after the sun\nwent down and i thought that's what i\nhad to do i thought because society is\nso much go go go work your ass off you\nhave to struggle to be successful\nhustle culture hustle culture i thought\nthat is actually what i had to do to\nsucceed and that there were no other\nways and just so you know\ni've coached thousands of business\nowners at this point almost everybody\nthinks the exact same thing there's this\nthing in our society that we think to be\nsuccessful we have to\nkind of\nstruggle and it has to suck and we have\nto get on the edge of burnout and i\nthought that's what i was supposed to do\nand i did burn myself out i ran my\nbusiness into the ground my business was\nsuper successful for a few years and\nthen i was just working working working\nso much that i subconsciously\nran it into the ground blew it up\nand now that i've been doing this for 16\nyears i'm 36 now i feel like i have a\nlot more\nexperience and knowledge and wisdom\nunder my belt of how to run a successful\nbusiness how to grow how to do\neverything and one massive secret to\nsuccess that i never hear anybody talk\nabout in hustle culture and hustle and\ngo bro go all of that stuff is rest\nit's not the sexiest thing and it's\nfunny because if you were to talk to me\nseven years ago 10 years ago i'd be like\nrest\nno that is not a secret to success there\nis no way that rest helps with success\nat all there's a point in time in my\nlife where i remember\nthinking to myself that i did not\ndeserve a break i did not deserve rest\nbecause i wasn't where i wanted to be\nyet\nwhich is interesting because i don't\nknow if you're like me\nbut i tend to be an overachiever and the\ncloser i get to my goal the further that\ni push it out which means that i would\nnever actually be quote unquote where\ni'm supposed to be or where i want to be\nand so one of the things that i never\nhear people talk about is rest is taking\na break is not working one of this one\nof the tips of success\nis to not work now i do want to say on\nthe other side there is also a part of\nyou that that when you are working you\nneed to be working your ass off\nbut then when you're not working you\nneed to be not working at all so it's\nit's very black and white it's not like\nyou know business flows into your off\ntime and off time flows into your\nbusiness\nbut taking a break\nnot working\nbeing alone with your thoughts and i'm\ngoing to teach you how to do this and it\ncould be a day it could be a moment it\ncould be multiple days whatever it is\nbut you have to as for as on as you're\ngoing to be if you're running a business\nor if you're a parent or whatever it is\nthat you're doing for as long as you're\ngoing to be you need to have moments of\ncompletely off i mean if we take\nbusiness out of them we just go to being\na parent there's a lot of parents\nthat work work work work work as a\nparent and their parent their parent\ntheir parent and they don't get any\nbreak from their children and then it's\njust like a collapse and it's like you\nknow they start resenting their children\nsometimes and they're like i need a\nbreak from my freaking kids versus like\nhow can we be fully on at some points\nand fully off at some points and how can\nwe build our life to be that way and\nthese can once again i'll tell you about\nit in this episode these can be moments\nof off\nit doesn't have to be an entire day off\nso you know being alone with your\nthoughts simply existing with nothing\nthat you have to do and this is really\nreally hard for a lot of people because\nmost people are you know have basically\ntrained themselves myself included to be\ngo go go go\nand they struggle to be alone with their\nthoughts and\ninterestingly enough to actually give\nyou an idea of how hard it is for some\npeople to be with their thoughts there\nwas a study that was done not long ago\nand they asked people you can either be\nalone with your thoughts for 15 minutes\nor you can be done with this experiment\nyou just have to give yourself a quick\nelectric shock and they had a button in\nfront of them\nand they could sit there for 15 minutes\nor they gave themselves a quick electric\nshock nothing that would kill them but\nsomething that definitely still hurt\n30 percent of women\ndecided to shock themselves\nand 60 of men\ndecided to shock themselves\njust let that sink in for a second think\nabout that\npeople have so much trouble being alone\nwith their thoughts for 15 minutes that\nthirty percent of women chose to shock\nthemselves and sixty percent of men\nchose electric shock\nlet that thing\njust let that sink into your bones how\ncrazy is that\npeople have a problem\nbeing off\nturning off\nand the world goes through seasons right\nso if you think about it we have we have\nspring we have summer we have fall we\nhave winter\nhumans also go through seasons your day\ncan be all four seasons in one you know\nit's not if i if we look outside i love\nto look look at nature\nfor inspiration because we come from\nnature we are nature there's no\ndifference between just because i live\nin a house doesn't mean i'm not you know\nnature like a tree is we come from that\nif you look at nature and i like to to\nlook at nature where we have you know in\naustin we have all four seasons that we\ngo through here\nsome places we don't have all four\nseasons we go through the majority of\nthe world has four seasons right it is\nnot spring forever\nit is not constantly grow grow grow grow\ngrow grow grow all of the time\nand conversely it's also not winter\nforever it's not you know lee's dying\nleaves dying leaves dying leaves dying\nforever it's not spring forever it's not\nwinter forever it is winter for a little\nwhile the trees the plants all of those\nthey have to lose their leaves\nthey have to contract in order to expand\nand grow in the spring\nso in order to grow\nthere is necessary there's you know\nexpand in order to expand and grow there\nis necessary contraction\nthe trees need to let go of their leaves\nthey need to contract for a little while\nand then when spring comes they grow and\nthey actually get bigger and you know\nexpansive more expensive than they were\nbefore\nso everything expands and contracts\nexpands and contracts\nhumans\nthink a lot of us overachievers think we\ncan always be expanding you don't need\nto always be expanding that doesn't make\nsense it doesn't apply and fit in with\nthe laws of nature so what is what does\nexpansion look i'm sorry what does\ncontraction look like it looks like rest\nand rest can be a lot of different\nthings you know when i say rest you i\ndon't mean that you have to take a month\noff of work you can if you want to if\nthat's up to you and you feel like you\nneed it that's why some people go on\nsabbaticals but rest can be a quick\n10-minute meditation in the middle of\nthe day\nthat's it\nexpand expand expand all day all right\nlet me take some time to contract for 10\nminutes\nand meditating is not sitting there and\nstopping your thoughts and thinking that\nyou just disappear\nmeditating is sitting and just observing\nyour thoughts so instead of going going\ngoing going going and then go oh man you\nknow what i need a break and you sit on\nyour phone for 10 minutes that's not a\nbreak there's a whole lot of studies the\nreason why you know that's actually\nworse for you i don't need to get into\nit but it's based off of your eye\nmovement the focus that you have the\nadrenaline the cortisol the\nacetylcholine that's released into your\nbrain when you look at something that's\non a small screen because your eyes have\nto converge but really what it is is\nwhen you have a break it needs to be a\nbreak your brain is on on on on and then\nit needs a little bit of rest you're\ngoing to find out why that is in just a\nsecond i'll tell you\nbut\nrest can also be\nyou know what it's 6 p.m i'm going to\nturn off my phone i'm done with work and\nwork cannot come back into my life until\ni start tomorrow\nand not allowing allowing it to be black\nand white and not gray in there okay i'm\non i'm off don't try to contact me when\ni'm off unless\nthe business is on fire unless\nsomething's on fire\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you love this video please hit\nthe like button it helps more than you\nknow and if you want to see more videos\nlike this hit the subscribe button so\nthat you could see some more and get\nnotified the next time i post\nrest\ncan be turning off at 6 pm to enjoy your\nlife\nrest can also be planning a weekend trip\nwith the family and in that time don't\n[ __ ] email me if you want to say that\nto people right like that's okay to be\nable to do that\nbut then some people do this this is\nwhat's interesting some people\nimmediately i know some people listening\nor thinking this right now\nbut if i slow down\naren't i going to be less motivated\nlike i i won't get to where i want to be\nif i slow down\nand for that i say\nthink of this for a second\nlet's say i want to wake up and go for a\nrun in the morning let's say you want to\nwake up and go for a run in the morning\nif you wake up and you had a really\nreally good night of sleep\nwould it be easier for you to go for a\nrun a long intense run early in the\nmorning if you had a great night of\nsleep or a shitty night of sleep\nthe answer is obvious isn't it\nthe answer is a really great night of\nsleep why because you're rested\nyou were you were off you were able to\nrecover now when you're in and you're\ndeciding to go for it you can be fully\non\nso some of you won't allow yourself to\nrest and you're wondering why you don't\nhave full bandwidth full brain power\nfull energy to do what you want to do\none of the reasons why is because you're\nnot taking any time off you're not\nallowing your brain to take a step\nto the side and be like okay this is\nwhat i'm going to do for a little while\nit's not taking i had to stop myself\nit's not taking a step back\nright it's not taking a step back\nbecause taking a step back makes it feel\nlike oh i'm going backwards and now\nthere's something wrong with it it's\nlike pulling an arrow back to shoot an\narrow what do you have to do it cannot\ngo forward it is impossible for an arrow\nto go forward unless it is pulled back\nfirst\nand the further that you pull the arrow\nback\nand then let go the further it's going\nto fly forward so sometimes the better\nyou reset the farther you'll fly forward\nthere is not a step back it is just\npulling the arrow back is all that it is\nwhich means\nhave a cut-off time for work have a\ncut-off time for your business and turn\nit off completely i have a business and\nwe have 20 employees but there's a lot\nof times where like if you text me at\nnine o'clock and want to talk about\nbusiness\ni'm probably not going to receive a\nresponse from you but when i turn my\nphone on which is after my morning\nroutine in the morning then i can talk\nabout business because it's now time to\ntalk about business\nnow i will tell you this and i promise\nyou this 10 years ago 15 years ago what\ni'm saying would have seemed ridiculous\nand foreign and alien to me but i was\nalso a lot poorer a lot broker and a lot\nless happy than i am now so trust me\nwhen i tell you this you have to be on\nwhen you're on and you have to be off\nwhen you're off and when you're off be\ncompletely off\nso\nyou know if you notice yourself and\nstart to really\nreally become aware of yourself is the\nimportant part when you notice yourself\nnot a hundred percent\nlet's say it's one o'clock and you're\nlike man i'm just not i'm not a hundred\npercent today i'm not fee i'm not\nmentally i was doing great this morning\nand now i just feel like i'm pretty\ntired okay assess the situation for a\nsecond have you been go go go go all day\nfull expansion mode maybe you need to\ntake a quick break\ntake 10 minutes\nclose your eyes listen to a 10-minute\naudio if you want to or you can just go\noutside and just don't take your phone\nwith you but go ahead and look out at\nthe horizon look out some trees allow\nyourself to just kind of mindlessly\nwander for a little while and you might\nsit there and be like why the hell would\ni want to do that well\nthere is science behind how well this\nactually works for you so let me go\nahead and bring it in uh dr andrew\nhuberman talks about this but he calls\nit non-sleep deep rest non-sleep deep\nrest which is where you allow yourself\nto just basically chill there is nothing\nthat you do you're not talking to\nanybody you're not journaling you're not\nreading you're not looking at your phone\nyou're just simply existing in the world\nfor 10 minutes or so\nthis is why this is important when you\nfall asleep there's a part of your brain\nthat's you know there's many parts of\nbrain that help with this but there's a\npart of your brain called the\nhippocampus that replays the day to file\nall of your stuff into your brain the\neasiest way to think about it and what\nit'll do is it'll replay your your\nmemories from the day and what you did\n30 to 60 times faster over and over and\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain because you know repetition is the\nmother of all skills so it'll actually\nreplay it over and over and over again\n30 to 60 times faster than it actually\nhappened during the day so that you can\ntake all of those memories and you can\nstore them and file them away your brain\nwants to be able to take that and file\nit away\nhere's what's really cool if you do a\nquick meditation\nor you go for a walk or you just stare\noutside in the distance\nand you just allow your your\nyourself just to simply exist in your\nmind just to wander your hippocampus\nwill do the exact same thing that it\ndoes during sleep but instead of doing\nit 30 to 60 times as fast it does it 10\ntimes the speed\nso what's cool about it is if you give\nyourself a\nfull on just break\naway from everything it actually helps\nyou\ntake everything that you did earlier in\nthe day and start to process it file it\naway and when it's filed away guess what\nhappens it leaves more mental energy to\nstart working on other things and so you\ncan sit there and i would have been like\na break is crazy\n10 15 years ago but now scientists start\nto come out and say hey a break is\nactually like pulling the arrow back so\ntherefore when you're done with the\nbreak midday you let go of it you fly\nforward so it could be a 10-minute break\nin in midday it could be multiple\n10-minute breaks it could be turning\nyour phone off\nat 6 p.m it could be taking a three-day\nweekend with your family once a quarter\nit could be you know going on a\nweek-long vacation and being completely\ndisconnected whatever it is you have to\nunderstand that one of the biggest parts\nof success is being able to go go go go\ngo go but that is unsustainable forever\nbecause for all of the expansion that\nyou have there needs to be moments of\ncontraction as well and so you have to\nthink to yourself how can i build in\nmoments of contraction to be able that\nwhen i am go go go go go go i can take a\nbreak for a minute and then rest and\nthen go back into it and be able to go\ngo go go you cannot be an expansion\nforever there needs to be moments of\ncontraction it can be moments it could\nbe hours it could be days whatever it is\nfor you you just have to start thinking\nto yourself am i in expansion am i in\ncontraction do i feel like i need to\ncontract a little bit have i been\nexpansion too much and you start to\nassess the situation figure out what\nworks for you and over time you will\nrealize that allowing yourself to rest\nis one of the most important things that\nyou can do for your growth the same way\nthat you can't work work out all day\nlong one of the most important parts of\nworking out and growing muscles\nis the sleep and the rest so that your\nbody can grow and they can actually\nstart to heal itself same thing works\nfor your brain except for now you're\njust working on your mental muscle"
