in order to\nmake it a great week go to monday\nemail.com right now once again monday\nemail.com right now and it's absolutely\nfree i'll send send you monday emails\nevery single week today we're going to\nbe talking about your standards we're\ngoing to talk about the standards that\nyou hold yourself to that you hold\neverybody to that you hold yourself to\nin every aspect of your life and if you\ncan understand this if you can hold\nyourself accountable to the levels that\nare above what you currently do you will\ngrow in every aspect of your life and\nyou will create an amazing life and in\nthis episode i'm going to give you tips\non how to do so so\nfirst off before we go any further let's\nget really clear on exactly what\nstandards are standards are what you\ndeem acceptable and unacceptable in your\nlife it's that simple that's the easiest\ni'm going to make it standards are what\nyou deem acceptable and unacceptable\nthere are levels that you will not let\nyourself drop below and there are\nstandards that are attached to your\nidentity\nyour life where it is currently at this\npoint right now is because of your\nstandards everything in your life is\nbecause of your standards\nhow you look\nhow your body looks\nwhere your business is at where your\nbank account is at where your\nrelationships are at where your\nfriendships are at where your marriage\nis at where your relationship with your\nkids is at the cleanliness of your house\nall of those things are because of your\nstandards a standard is something that\nyou will not let yourself drop below\nbut this beautiful thing about that is\nthat there's always another level to\nyour current standard\ni'll give you a really quick example\nmajority of you guys listening are\nprobably not going to get done listening\nto this podcast episode and go shoot\nsome black tar heroine right probably\nbelow your standards\nyou know for some of you maybe it's not\nbut for majority of you guys i think\nthat probably is\nbut stopping just short of your goal\nis something that you do\ngiving up on yourself too early is\nsomething that you do\nhitting the snooze button\nthree times before finally waking up is\nsomething that you do\nso you know\nshooting black tar heroin something that\nyou don't do that's below your standards\nbut giving early given up early on your\ngoal not below your standards\nhitting the snooze button\nnot below your standards people love to\nfocus on habits and it's important\nhabits are important but your habits are\nthe offspring of your standards when\nyour standards are clear and defined\nyour habits will follow\ni'll give you an example\nyou know a lot of people want to have a\nmorning routine and develop the habit of\nhaving a morning routine but they don't\nhave a standard of waking up when their\nalarm goes off they don't have a\nstandard of going to bed early they\ndon't have a standard of doing what they\nsay they're going to do they don't have\na standard of prioritizing their health\nin prioritizing their sleep they don't\nhave a standard of making sure that\neverything in the morning is ready\nbefore they go to bed\nso\nyou know you won't shoot black tar\nheroine\nbut you do struggle getting up in the\nmorning why standards\nthere are some people who have the\nstandard of they wake up every single\nmorning\nthey wake up every single morning at 5\nam\nyou might not you might\nyou have to see sleeping in\nas the same mental disgust as shooting\nblack tar heroine right now those might\nnot seem equivalent to you and i\ncompletely get it but there needs to you\nneed to understand heroin below your\nlevels sleeping in\nwell that's part of your levels that's\nyour standard that you're that you're\nallowing yourself to\nto go to and your habits will be\ndictated by your standards so let me\ngive you a couple more examples so it\nmakes sense right\nif you look at your body\nis it your dream body\ncould it be better i love using the body\nand working out in all of this as an\nexample because your body is literally\nthe physical manifestation of your\nhabits and your standards your body is\nliterally the physical manifestation of\nyour habits and your standards\ndoes your body the body that you want\nis it your dream body could it be better\nwell it's because of that whatever your\nbody looks like is because of your\nstandards do you eat fast food\ndo you eat greasy food\ndo you eat wings\ndewey pizza\nall of that\nis just a standard that you're sticking\nto\nthere's some people that eat crappy food\nand that's just part of their standard\nthere's some people that will never\nallow themselves to eat crappy food\nbecause it's below their standards i'm\nnot saying there's right or wrong i'm\nnot here to judge i'm just saying\nwherever your life is is because of your\nstandards\nyou know i'll give you an example let's\nsay\nlet's say you drop food in the parking\nlot\nare you going to pick that food up and\neat that food after it's been on the\nparking lot for a little while\nprobably not\nwhy\nbecause it's below your standards\nright but maybe eating mcdonald's when\nyou know you shouldn't isn't below your\nstandards\nwhat does it come down to your standards\nthat's it look at your body again how\noften do you work out\nis the amount of time let me say this\nthe amount of times that you work out\nis your personal standard i know people\nthat work out\ntwice a day\ni know people that haven't worked out in\n10 years what's the difference standards\nthat's the difference between the two of\nthem\nso if you want to change your body what\ndo you need to change\nyou need to change your standards\nwhat you deem acceptable\nfor some people\nworking out once a week is a win\nfor some people\nworking out less than five times a week\nis a loss what's the difference\nstandards that's it\nso if you want to change your body what\ndo you need to change you need to change\nyour standards your workout standards\nyour lifestyle standards your mental\nstandards how hard you go in the gym in\nthose standards you live and you die by\nyour standards and your life will become\nthe results\nof your standards\nthey make the life that you currently\nhave and they make the life that you\nwill have in the future\nthe only question is do your standards\ncurrently line up with the future that\nyou want\nbecause the only difference between you\nnow and you in 10 years and if you you\nknow if you fast forward 10 years and\nyou have the perfect life your dreams\nall of the money that you want the\nrelationship that you want the the\nfamily that you want the children that\nyou want the lifestyle that you want\nthe only difference between you now and\nthat person is the person in 10 years\nhas way different standards than the\nstandards that you currently have that's\nthe difference between the two of them\nthere's you now and there's the perfect\nyou\nand that perfect you has fully maxed out\non their true potential and not wasted\ntheir true potential what's the\ndifference between you now and that\nversion of you standards and this is\neverything in your life you have\nstandards for literally every single\nthing in your life do you realize that\nand so it's important to go through and\nactually start to think about what are\nmy standards around this what are my\nstandards around that\nare my standards high enough\nin my business in order to create the\nfreedom in the life that i want i don't\nknow that's for you to decide\nso let me give you a couple of examples\ni'll give you a couple of examples so we\ncan kind of put a little bit of flavor\nto this and make it a little bit more\ncolorful right\nif you look at your goals for instance\nright do you come up short on your goals\ndo you\ngive up\ndo you not stop until the goal is hit no\nmatter how long it takes\nwell the difference between those\nstandards\nif you come up short or you give up\nshort\nor if you don't stop until the goal is\nhit the difference between the two of\nthose is just simply your standards so\nif you want to hit your goals more often\nwhat do you need to do\nyou need to change your standards what\nare the standards that you need to have\nin order to hit the goals that you want\nto hit\nokay\nwhat's another thing relationships\ndo you cheat on your significant other\nwell\nif you do that's a standard if you're\nlike absolutely not\nthat's also a standard\ndo you have date night every single week\nif you don't well that's a standard if\nyou do because it's like absolutely we\ndo not miss it that's also a standard\ndo you turn off your phone at 7 pm\njust so it can be the two of you\nwell that's a standard do you spend all\nnight watching netflix\nit's also a standard\nall of it comes down to your standards\nand what you deem acceptable and\nabsolutely unacceptable what about your\nfamily\ndo you work so hard that you usually\nmiss dinner with your wife and kids\nthat's a standard do you disconnect at 6\npm so that you be fully present parent\nthat's also a standard\nthe only difference between the two of\nthose is what is acceptable and what is\nunacceptable for some people\nmissing the majority of the dinners is\njust a standard for some people they\nwill never\nmiss a dinner with their children\nand their wife and their husband whoever\nit might be that's a standard you know\nsome people's kids you know like i know\nfor instance when i was a kid one of the\nstandards that my mom had even though\nshe worked really hard one of the\nstandards was she would come to every\nsingle one of my my sports games i never\ntold her to\nbut i loved that she always came\nthat was a standard for her what are\nyour standards around stuff like that\nhave you gone through and actually\nbecome very intentional with every\nsingle thing that you do and figure out\nwhat your standards are\nokay what's another thing your body once\nagain\ndo you work out every single day do you\nfollow a healthy lifestyle\nwell those things are standards\ndo you eat fast food do you skip\nworkouts often has it been months has it\nbeen years since you've worked out well\nthat's your standard\nthat's all that it comes down to your\nentire life comes down to your standard\nwhat about your bank account\nhow much your bank account is at how\nmuch you spend how much you make all of\nthat comes down to standards the work\nthat you do the thing that you do for\nmoney is a standard for some people they\nget to a certain level and they're like\nthere's no way i'll ever go below this\ncool that's the new standard for some\npeople it's just like i just need to get\nby man\ncool\nit's a choice that's your standard what\nabout your personal growth how much you\ngrow yourself intellectually your\npersonal development whatever you do\nthere there's standards attached to it\nsome people listening as podcasts will\nnot go to bed without reading 10 pages\nevery single night some people haven't\npicked up a [ __ ] book in 10 years\nwhat's the difference\nstandards that's it\nthe way that you do one thing is the way\nyou do everything so if you're slipping\nin your standards in your relationship\nit's probably happening in other places\nas well\nbecause you live and die by your\nstandards your standards make you who\nyou are you have to realize that your\nstandards make you\nthe question is\nthe standards that you currently have\nare they going to make the life that you\nwant\nyou live and die by your stance the only\ndifference between you now and you in 10\nyears\nwith the perfect life\nwith the dreams that you want the house\nthe cars the clothes the family the the\nbank account the freedom\nthe happiness the joy the peace the love\nthe only difference between you now and\nthat person are their standards\nyou have to ask yourself\nwhat's the difference between you now\nand the standards that you have\nand that person\nif you were to look and look into the\nfuture if i could say hey describe the\nperfect life that you want and imagine\nthat somebody has that perfect life\nalready they already have every single\nthing there is nothing missing from\ntheir life it's not even you it's just\nsomebody else that exists in this world\nright now\nand they already have everything that\nyou want they have the success the\nhappiness the love the peace the joy the\nfamily the car's clothes that freedom\nall of those things they have everything\nthat you want\nwhat's the difference between them\nand you\ndescribe to me in detail what's the\ndifference between them\nand you can you get very clear on the\ndifference between the two of you\ncan you\nlet me know what's the difference\nbetween you and them and then what you\nrealize is you start looking at yourself\nand you start seeing where some of your\nstandards are coming up a little bit\nshort and you start looking at where\nthat other person is you start going man\nthat person has some much higher\nstandards in the relationship person has\nsome much higher standards in their work\nethic person has some much higher\nstandards in their you know their\nworkouts that person has some much\nhigher standards in the food that they\neat that person has much higher\nstandards than xyz everything and then\nyou start to look at okay well this is\nwhere i am this is where i want to be\nwhat do i need to change my standards\nbecause my habits and my actions are the\nchildren of my standards when my\nstandards are high i will have habits\nand actions that line up with that\nbecause the way that i see it\npersonally i see everything as light in\nlife as just to test to see how i'm\ngoing to show up\nit's as if god or the universe is\nwatching me at all points in time and\nthey're like hey rob how are you going\nto show up because what i'm going to\ngive you and bless you with in this life\nis going to be based off of how you show\nup if you have low standards you know\nyou're going to get low results\nif you have really high standards you're\ngoing to get really high results i try\nto hold myself to the highest standards\nthat i possibly can because when i do i\nfind that the universe rewards me\nbecause one of the things that's super\ninteresting everybody is that most\npeople don't hold themselves too high\nstandards most people don't even know\nwhat a standard is\nbut when you start to hold yourself to a\nhigher standard you realize there's very\nfew people in the world that hold\nthemselves to the standards that they\nreally need to to make greatness out of\nhimself\nand when you decide i'm going to hold\nmyself to a level of accountability and\nlevel of standards that i never have\nbefore it's really crazy how the\nuniverse just conspires to be on your\nside and you start getting blessings and\nthings that you never thought you could\npossibly get you're like where in the\nhell did this come from i've never seen\nthis before what happened it's kind of\nlike the universe is like hey good job\nyou finally did it now let me show you\nwhat life could be but it won't give you\nany of those amazing things until you\nactually start to make the change\nyou have to remember the way you do one\nthing is the way you do everything and\nyou live and die by your standards do\nthe standards that you have now match\nthe standards that you need to create\nthe life that you want if they do\ncontinue on them if they don't make a\nchange because that is the only way that\nyour life is going to change is when you\nfigure out what is absolutely\nunacceptable and what is acceptable and\nyou start to hold yourself to those\nstandards\nso that's what i
