to\nbreak free from the rat race and how to\ncreate the life that you actually want\nto live\none of the biggest tips that i'll give\nyou before we dive in today\nis you got to stop\nthinking the same way everybody else is\nyou got to start thinking outside of the\nbox and you've got to start questioning\neverything there was a point in time in\nmy life i was probably about 26 27 i i\nhad a different life because i ran my\nown business from i was an employee then\ni ran my own business from 19 to 24 and\nthen i went back to being an employee\nand working in the corporate world and\ndoing corporate sales and then i was\nlike this sucks i gotta get out of here\nso i went from being an employee to\nrunning my own business to being\nemployed to running my own business\nand\nwhat that allowed me to do was to think\noutside of the box because what we're\ntaught is that we need to go to school\nwe need to\nget into college we need to get a degree\nwe need to work for somebody else we\nneed to pay our bills we need to buy a\nbunch of [ __ ] we don't want we need to\nhave some kids we need to have a house\nand then just die one day right but you\ngot to start thinking outside of the box\nand really start asking yourself like is\nwhat i have the life that i have\nthe things that i've bought all of these\nthings is this what i actually truly\nwant and a lot of people i find and i\nget a lot of messages that talk about it\nwant to get themselves out of the rat\nrace and as far as the rat race goes\njust think about this for a second\nwho came up with working monday through\nfriday who came up with working nine to\nfive where did that come from do you\nhave any idea well i'll give it to you\nhenry ford made it up in the early 1900s\nit was just\nmade up by a guy one day and the world\njust went with it i don't know about you\ni just don't want to go with it i want\nto do something different i want to be\nin charge of when i do work when i don't\nwork what it is that i do and don't do\nand so for us just to live our life\nbased off of one human\nover a hundred years ago just doesn't\nmake any sense in my mind but what\nhappens we just go for it we just\nyeah you know this is what i'm supposed\nto do this is the way it works this is\nwhat i'm supposed to do throughout my\nlife\nbut if you work for somebody i want to\nchallenge you to do this\ntake a random tuesday off just take\ntuesday off and just drive around go to\na park\ngo to a couple you know places that you\nnormally frequent\nand one thing that you're going to\nrealize is that there's people\neverywhere\nlike there's people not working and i\nremember before i left my last job i was\ndriving around it was like tuesday and i\nhad a dentist appointment so i had a\ndentist appointment then i took the rest\nof the day off then i was getting some\nfillings and i remember driving\ndriving around and i went by this park\nin austin called zilker park it was like\none two o'clock and there's people\neverywhere and i was thinking to myself\nwhat the hell do these people do how how\ndo they make money\nand can i figure out a way to do\nwhatever they're doing because i just\nwanted to be free from everything else\nthat i was doing and being told what to\ndo freedom is an interesting thing\nbecause people don't people don't\nrealize it but what they really want is\nfreedom but most people don't prioritize\ntheir freedom\nmost people don't prioritize their\nfreedom people will prioritize many\nother things people will prioritize\nmaking money people will prioritize work\npeople will prioritize their children\nbut people will not prioritize their own\npersonal freedom\ndo you want to know a little secret\nthough\nyou don't want to make money if you want\nto become rich you don't want to become\nrich\nthat's not your main goal sure money can\nbuy you cool things money is going to\nbuy you a house money's going to buy you\ncars\nmoney's going to buy you trips all of\nthose things people think that they want\nmoney and although you do want all those\nthings you do want the car you do want\nthe house you do want the trips you want\nall those things what you actually want\nis what the money gives you which is\nfreedom\nif you're in the rat race you want\nfreedom from it if you want money you\nwant freedom is what you want you want\nthe freedom that's what we're all\nsearching for\nyou know if you want to be able to buy a\ntrip to somewhere\nwhat you want is the freedom to be able\nto make the choice to go somewhere if\nyou want to buy a couple cars you don't\nwant the couple cars you do but what you\nreally want is the freedom to make the\nchoices that you want to make and not be\nrestricted by anything success means\nsomething to different different to\neveryone but to me\nand when i usually say this to people\nthey're usually like oh yeah me too\nwhen i ask people what success a lot of\ndifferent answers you'll get but success\nto me is freedom is the ability to do\nsuccesses with the freedom to do what\nyou want when you want with who you want\nthat's it it's that simple success\nto me\nis the freedom to do what you want when\nyou want with who you want sure you want\nmoney but what you actually want is the\nfreedom to take a weekend trip with your\nfriends and not have to worry about\npaying rent that's what you actually\ntruly want sure you want to be able to\nbuy that new watch but what you want is\nthe freedom to buy that watch and not\nhave to worry about paying your mortgage\nyou want the freedom to go out and buy\nthe those pair of shoes and not have to\nlook at the price tag or worry about it\nsure you want to make money but what you\nactually want is the freedom of having\nto worry about money\nthat's what you\nwant think about that for a second\nyou want to make money yeah of course\neverybody wants to make money and\nthere's even people listening and i've\nheard this many times you're like oh i\ndon't really care about money oh yeah if\ni came up to you and it was like hey\nhere's a million dollars be like ew no\nno you'd take it everybody wants money\nin some sort of way some people have\ndifferent varying like some people want\nto be rich and all that stuff some\npeople don't really care about that much\nbut sure everybody wants to make money\nin some sort of way or they understand\nthat money would make their life at\nleast a little bit easier but you what\nyou really want is the freedom of burden\nof worrying about money that's what you\nreally want do you want to know the\nsecret about freedom though\nfreedom\nthis is where it messes people up so if\nyou want to be free from the rat race\nfree to make the decisions that you want\nfree to travel everything\nfreedom comes from discipline\nnow that doesn't seem normal but freedom\ncomes from discipline\nmost people think that freedom is the\nopposite\nof discipline people think that\ndiscipline is restrictive but the\nfreedom is in the discipline and the\nstructure\nso the people that i know that have the\nmost freedom\npeople that have massive amounts of\nfreedom to make any choice that they\nwant to make to do whatever it is they\nwant to do\nwhat they've done is there has been some\nrestriction in some discipline in their\nlife and they've buckled down for a few\nyears five years 10 years whatever it is\nand they've buckled down they left their\ncorporate job most of them pretty\nactually all of them have have left a\ncorporate job\nand they've made their own discipline\nsee this is what's interesting when you\nleave the rat race one of the things\nthat's a benefit of the rat race and\nworking for someone else is that you\nhave a structure you have to usually\nstick to you know what time you have to\nbe in the office you know what time\nyou're allowed to leave the office and\nyou have to do work in between those\ntimes a lot of people when they leave\nand they start their own business\nthere's so much freedom they don't know\nwhat the hell to do with it and a lot of\npeople don't have successful businesses\nbecause they can't simply hold their\nfeet to the fire they need someone to\ntell them what to do\nthe discipline and the structure creates\nfreedom down the line though so if you\nrun your own business and you have\ndiscipline in structure to work when you\nneed to work to get things done we need\nto get them done that discipline and\nstructure will create freedom later on\ndown the road here's what's also\ninteresting as well\nthere's two ways that the discipline and\nstructure will create freedom later on\nit will create freedom in your life\nnumber one\nis later on in life when you can buckle\ndown in and work on something and be\ndedicated something for six months a\nyear two years three years five years\ni'm not talking about living your whole\nlife\nor you know even in those five years\nyour entire life being dedicated to\nsomething but i'm talking about can you\njust be dedicated to something when you\ndecide to work when you\nbuckle down\nyou will have much more freedom later on\ndown the road so that's the first time\nthat it's going to help later on down\nthe road\nbut the second time it's going to help\nis discipline and structure create\nfreedom in the moment\nmost people don't take action\nbecause they're not sure the correct\naction to take so they sit around and\nthey overthink and they sit around and\nthey overthink and they never actually\ntake any action the people who schedule\nand plan their actions\nnow\nhave freedom to take action however they\nsee fit in the moment so even though\nthere's a little bit of restriction of\nlike from 9am to 11pm i'm doing xyz\nthere's freedom to do whatever you want\nto do in that xyz whatever that is some\npeople that have so much freedom\nwhenever they start a business whenever\nthey leave the rat race that that\nfreedom becomes paralyzing for them\nbecause they don't know what to do and\nso when you can put in some structure\nyou can put in some discipline it allows\nyou to actually be more free in it and\nlet me explain it's a little bit deeper\nif you wake up and you have no schedule\nthere's freedom in that sure\nbut that freedom can also stress a lot\nof people out because they feel like\nthey should be doing more they're\nsearching for what to do\nin that time\nthey know that there's more for them\nthey don't know what to do though but\nwhen you have structure and when you\nhave discipline there's freedom to do\nwhat you want to do in that structure so\nfor instance let me give you an example\nright like i know my schedule if i know\nmy schedule and i've created my schedule\ni am free so in this moment i'm\nrecording four podcast episodes in a row\nthat is some structure that is some\ndiscipline but in this moment i can say\nwhatever i want to\nso there is freedom to talk about what i\nwant to do what i want and so if\nsomebody is going like if someone's like\nyou know what i want to be a songwriter\nokay well from this time there's\nsomebody to sit down and do songwriting\nthat seems like this plan seems like\nstructure but at the same time there's\nfreedom to do whatever type of\nsongwriting i want to do in that moment\npeople underestimate\nwhat buckling down and locking down for\ntime\njust like locking down working on\nyourself on a business for instance if\nyou just lock down for a year and work\non that business\nwhat that will do for the future people\nunderestimate what disappearing will do\nlet me explain what i mean by that if\nyou're under the age of 40 right\ndisappear for a year\ngo off the map\nnow let me give you a couple examples\nbecause some of you guys have family\nsome of you guys don't if you don't have\na family\nand you want to leave the rat race and\nyou want to build your own business\ndisappear for a year 12 months go off\nthe map tell everybody that you'll talk\nto them in a year you know don't just\ndisappear completely like i don't want\nyou to think like you can never see your\nfriends you can still see them but\ndisappear\n90 of the time from what you currently\nare find one thing that you want to do\nlike a business\nor a skill and work on that thing\ndedicate your life to that thing for 12\nmonths and when you pick your head up\nyou're going to see that you're light\nyears ahead of every single person who's\nin that same industry and working on the\nsame type of business for the same type\nof skill\nif you have a family\ndisappear from everybody but them\ni'm not saying like leave your kids and\ndon't provide provide for your family\nthat's not what i'm saying at all don't\ndisappear from your family but disappear\nfrom everybody else make a transition\nplan figure out what it would take to go\nfrom working your corporate job that\nyou're not necessarily stoked about and\ndon't spend the rest of your life there\nto doing that business that you want to\ndo and dedicate your non-work\nnon-family hours to creating that thing\nwill you get less sleep maybe will you\nget less free time maybe will you have\nless social hours with your friends\nabsolutely\nbut develop the skill develop the\nbusiness acumen develop the education\nthe knowledge to make sure\nthat you're working on that one thing\nlearn from mentors hire people to help\nyou have people teach you exactly what\nit is to do\nthe problem is that most people get\nstuck into their their corporate jobs\nthey get stuck into the rat race and\nthey realize that they have no freedom\nand they want to break free but they\ndon't know what the first step is the\nfirst step is getting very intentional\non what it is that you want to do the\nsecond step is making a plan to\ndisappear\nif you don't have a family disappear\nfrom all of your social\nspend you know if if right now you're at\n100 capacity of your social go to 10\nhang out with your friends go to some\nbirthday parties all that stuff but\nreally buckle down and focus on yourself\nand focus on the business that you're\ntrying to build if you have a family\ndisappear from everybody else that's not\nyour family go to work do whatever it is\nyou have to do when you work come home\ndo whatever you have to when you come\nhome and spend a few hours a night\nevery single night don't watch netflix\ndon't get on instagram do it do any of\nthat stuff dedicating yourself to that\nbusiness and then on the weekends find\none day on the weekends saturday every\nsingle saturday for five six hours\nyou're going to dedicate yourself to\nbuilding that business and doing\nwhatever it is you need to do whatever\nit is that you want to do you can do it\nyou just have to realize that you have\nto be the person to step up to make a\nchange and to do something about it i'm\nnot saying it's going to be easy in fact\nit's going to be [ __ ] hard i'm going\nto be honest with you but it will 100 be\nworth it if you don't make a change and\nyou want if you're in the position where\nyou're still listening right now you\nwant to make some sort of a change i'm\nassuming if you don't make a change you\nwill\nhopefully still be alive in five years\nin five years you're going to be looking\nback going [ __ ] i still don't like this\njob i'm still not fulfilled here i wish\ni would have done that one thing\nor if you decide to make a change five\nyears from today you're gonna look back\nand be like oh my god i'm so glad i made\nthat decision\nyou are a hundred percent i can tell you\nbecause i was working a corporate job\nseven years ago and i left that\ncorporate job well i guess for six and a\nhalf years ago now i left that corporate\njob i would have never expected that me\nleaving would have turned into what it's\nturned into now i just wanted to be able\nto pay my bills and be able to do\nsomething i'm passionate about i wanted\nto make you know 60 grand a year that's\nwhat i wanted to do out of if i'm being\nhonest with you i thought that it would\nbe big but six years down the road to\nhave a business that's doing over 5\nmillion a year is like holy [ __ ] that's\namazing but it was because i decided to\ndedicate myself to something that i\nactually loved and so if you're out\nthere i'm telling you right now it\nwhatever it is that you want to do you\ncan do whatever that thing is you 100\ncan it's not going to be easy it will be\nhard there will be challenges will be\nups and downs will be times where you'll\nget really fearful about i don't know if\ni can do this anymore i promise you\nif you continue to do what you you're\ndoing right now and it's not lighting\nyou up\nyou will slowly and slowly and slowly\nstart to feel like what you're doing is\neating at your soul\nif you make a change\nthis year next year whatever it is you\nwill slowly start to feel like your soul\nis actually coming back alive\nyou get one life you spend the majority\nof your waking hours working and making\nmoney in some sort of way you might as\nwell find something that you love doing\nand something that you're passionate\nabout if you don't love what you're\ndoing change it if you're still\nlistening this podcast episode you\nprobably don't love what you're
