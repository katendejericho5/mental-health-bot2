    "transcript": "it just so happens to be 2020 and maybe\nthe reason for that is because we need\nto see\neverything that we haven't seen that\nwe've been blind to 2020 was crazy for a\nlot of people and we want to make 2021\namazing and if we do we need to work on\nour minds more than anything else year\n2023 doesn't even exist it doesn't exist\nin my mind i'm never going to see it i'm\ngoing to live like that\nnow uh i've seen a lot of posts of\npeople saying oh man i wish that 2020\nwould just be over can we just get on to\n2021. and um\ni don't think that people are really\ntaking 2020 for what they should be\ntaking it as and what i see it as as\npossibly the greatest awakening that our\nspecies could ever have of everything\nthat we're blind to everything that\nwe're doing wrong in every opportunity\nthat we personally need to improve upon\nand uh it's kind of\nyou know it could be\nyou know it could be by plan i don't\nknow but you know if you think about\n2020 and to have 2020 vision it means\nthat you have perfect vision whenever\nyou go when you get your eyes checked it\njust so happens to be 2020 and maybe the\nreason for that is because we need to\nsee\neverything that we haven't seen that\nwe've been blind to that we have been\nasleep to that we have been zombies for\nand i think that this year could be the\ngreatest paradigm shift that the world's\never seen as far as a paradigm is this\nis the way that we've always seen the\nworld over here\nbut over here is what we've been blind\nto that we've been needing to see and\nnow it's so blatantly in front of us\nthat we need to see it and we need to\nmake a change or as a species go extinct\nand so we have a couple things that i\nwant to talk about just in this sense\nthe first thing is obviously the\npandemic you know the coronavirus coming\nin\nwhat did that wake us up to that we've\nbeen completely blind to that we haven't\nbeen paying attention to okay the first\nthing it's opening our eyes the fact\nthat we\ndon't take care of the earth we rape the\nearth we pillage the earth we act like\nit's just there for us and we take take\ntake take take we don't act like we come\nfrom the earth we don't respect it we\ndon't give it the the respect that it\nneeds but then also the same time we\ndon't treat it the way it should be\ntreated as if you know they say don't\nbite the hand that feeds you literally\nevery single aspect of you as a human\ncomes from the earth the air that you\nbreathe the food that you put into your\nbody every single aspect of it comes\nfrom the earth no matter how processed\nthat is\nand then the last part of it besides the\nfood the air the water that you drink\nevery single bit of it comes from the\nearth you\nwhether you realize it or not are the\nearth you are the living breathing\nwalking talking version of the earth\nwhy\ndon't we take care of it better\nso we have the pandemic showing us that\nwe are not taking care of the earth\nthat's one thing that is showing us what\nelse is it showing us we don't take care\nof animals we act like animals are just\nthere for us to eat and that we can just\ngo ahead and we can eat anything that we\nwant it's all ours to take and we can\njust take all of it it's ours it doesn't\nmatter don't take care of it you know if\nyou've ever driven by you know we just\ncame back from sedona the other day and\nwe have to drive by dairy farms and it's\njust cows and cows and cows and cows and\ncows and they're not taken care of in\nany sort of way so you have these\nanimals that are not taken care of in\nany sort of way they're not in their\nnatural habitat usually they're out\neating grass but they're literally on\njust these big giant dirt farms and\nthey're given pellets that's not how\nthey're supposed to be taken care of\nthat's not the normal thing that they\neat they don't get to walk around like\nthey normally do so clearly their bodies\nare not taken care of as much as they're\nsupposed to be and then people are\ningesting the actual dairy that comes\nfrom them so maybe the fact that we're\nnot taking care of animals and the\nentire coronavirus started from somebody\neating an animal that they probably\nshouldn't have been eating so you have\nthat to think about\nhow about the fact that that we don't\ntake care of our bodies enough our our\nown bodies you know by the food that we\neat by the um you know the lack of\nworking out that we might have by the\nfact that we're you know drinking\nalcohol or putting something into it\nthat is lowering our immune system and\nso therefore we're not taking care of\nour bodies as much as we should is what\nit's showing us and therefore our immune\nsystems are now being compromised by\nwhat we do what we think how we treat\nourselves the food we put into our\nbodies the\nlack of working out or the working out\nthat we we don't do\nall of that stuff is now making us more\ncompromised to then get\nthis virus that is spreading across the\nworld so we have a few things number one\nwe have the way that we treat the earth\nfrom the pandemic it's showing us that\nwe're not treating the earth correctly\nnumber two it's showing us that we don't\ntreat animals correctly we act as if\nanimals don't have a conscience that\nthey don't know what's going on that\nthey're not smart enough to understand\nthe that we're putting them through\nthan the torture that we put them\nthrough\nand the third thing is we act like you\nknow the third thing is bringing us our\nawareness to is our bodies and actually\nwhat we do with them or the things that\nwe don't do them so it's making us very\naware of those things\nso we have and then we have the food\nobviously that we feed ourselves as well\nso that's a few things that it is waking\nus up to our paradigm is shifting of\nmaybe i should pay attention to how we\ntreat earth maybe i should pay attention\nto how we treat adults maybe i should\npay attention to how i take care of my\nbody maybe i should pay attention to the\nfood that i put into my body and it's\nnot just about taste or as joe rogan\nlikes to call it mouth pleasure\nof just sitting there and being like oh\nwell you know what i'm just going to go\nahead and eat this because it tastes\ngood not thinking about the fact that it\ncould\nput extra fat onto my body if i have too\nmuch sugar\nso it's making us wake up while i talk\nabout the great awakening it's making us\nwake up\nto what we're doing\nbecause we have been in a zombie state\nwhat else is 2020 making us wake up to\nthe fact that we have the protests and\neverything that's going on the way that\nwe treat each other\nthe inequality that so blatantly exists\nthat we just act like doesn't exist\nwe need to wake up to the fact that\nthere are people out there that\nsometimes need our help\nyou know and they they need to have the\nequality that we\nyou know if you're a white person that's\nin america you've been treated a way\nthat's been different than other people\nis that fair no how do we make it fair\nmake sure that everybody has the equal\nopportunity it's absolutely ridiculous\nto think that just because somebody has\na different amount of pigment in their\nskin that they could be treated\ndifferently\nit's like the bob marley quote that\nreminds me of his his song war he says\nuntil the color of a man's skin is of no\nuntil the color of a man's skin is of no\nmore significance than the color of his\neyes i say war\nthink about that for a second does it\nmatter what color someone's eyes are of\ncourse it doesn't so why does it matter\nwhat color someone's skin is\nit's just their ancestors adaptation to\nhow much sun they got and what the\nclimate was like\nthat's really all that it is it has\nnothing to do with their intelligence it\nhas nothing to do with who they are it's\njust the color of their skin so why\nwould somebody just because of the color\nof their own skin have less equality\nthan somebody else why would somebody be\ntreated differently than someone else\nso we're being woken up to the fact that\nthere are people that we need to stick\nup for there are people that we need to\nhave their backs there are people that\nwe need to march for there are people\nthat we need to say you know what i'm\nhere for you\nwhether you need me to go out and march\nwith you or whether you just need me to\nlisten to\nwhatever it is that you got event to me\nvent to me i'm all ears and i will not\njudge you in any sort of way\nand that human connection\nof we should treat others the way that\nwe want to be treated\nwhether they look like you or they don't\nlike you look like you you should treat\nothers the way that you want to be\ntreated it's the golden rule it's so\nsimple isn't it\ntreat others as you want to be treated\ndo unto others as you would have them do\nunto you\nwhy\nwould you treat anybody differently so\nmaybe it's waking us up to not only the\nfact that we don't treat the earth right\nnot only in fact we don't treat animals\nright not only the fact that we don't\ntreat our bodies right but also to the\nfact that we don't treat each other\nright\nthis paradigm shift that's waking us up\nand think about this we've had to sit in\nour houses for months\nsome people are still sitting in their\nhouse they've been there for months you\ncan't run from yourself when you've been\nsitting in your house for months\none of the things that i noticed that\npeople like to keep themselves very very\nbusy and the reason why they like to\nkeep themselves busy is subconsciously\nthey don't want to deal with all of the\n that they really truly need to deal\nwith\nwhat is 2020 doing to us it's making us\nlook\nat ourselves in the mirror and saying\nwhat do i need to fix\nabout myself and also the world around\nme because we're all in this together\nwe don't exist without the earth we\ndon't exist without the animals we don't\nexist with other bodies and we don't\nexist without each other\nwe're all in this together\nit's time for us to wake up the great\nawakening the spiritual awakening of oh\nmy god it's not just me\ni always say that you're either on self\nor you're on purpose\neither you're being selfish and you're\nthinking about yourself and only\nyourself or\nyou're on purpose and you're thinking\nabout others you're thinking about the\nearth you think about the animals you\nthink about how you should treat people\nand what you should do you know people\nalways ask me they're like why why did\nyou decide to you know i'm probably 95\nvegan\nthe reason why i'm the only other five\npercent is because sometimes it's hard\nto go out and eat at certain places and\nsometimes it's there i had a very big\nspiritual awakening during a ayahuasca\nceremony where i saw animals being\ntortured and felt what they felt and i\nrealized\nthat my entire life i've been\ni've been\nsupporting animal cruelty\nand i've been supporting\nanimal rape because in order to have\ndairy you have to continue to keep\nimpregnating the cows over and over and\nover again i don't want to go too deep\ninto it because i don't want to to gross\neverybody out that's out there but i\nhave this big spiritual awakening of i\ncan get all of the nutrients that i need\nif i'm smart about it\nfrom the from different types of food\nso why would i need to be part of\nsomething that tortures and kills\nanimals for our own consumption why does\nsomething need to die\nin order for me to eat\ni was woken up\nholy i can never unsee what i just\nsaw\ni saw it\nso then i thought to myself\nwhy don't i just try it for a little\nwhile and see how it works and i\nrealized it wasn't that hard and i\nrealized that i lost weight doing it and\ni realized that my skin cleared up doing\nit and i realized that i slept better\nand i realized that all of the sword\njoints and muscles that i had in my body\nstarted to go away and i was like holy\ncrap i actually feel better\nfrom not eating dead flesh\nfor me\nthat was an awakening\nand i think in different aspects of\nevery single person that's out there\nwe're having a great awakening of\nmaybe i should look at the food i eat\nmaybe i should look at the way that i\ntreat the earth maybe i should look at\nthe way i treat my body maybe i should\nlook at the way i treat other people\nit's time for us to stop being selfish\nand wake up to the fact that we're all\nin this together\nthere's not a part of the system that\ncan go down whether it's the earth the\nanimals our bodies or each other there's\nnot a part of that system that can go\ndown\nand have the entire system continue to\nrun the way it always has been we need\nto help each other\nevery animal that we can every human\nthat we can no matter what they look\nlike no matter what they believe in no\nmatter the color of their skin no matter\ntheir their gender\nno matter their sexual preference\nwe need to team up and be together and\nhelp people no matter what we need to\nlisten to people more and stop talking\nand throwing our opinions at people but\nto put ourselves in someone else's shoes\nto think man i've never thought of it\nfrom their perspective\nbut now i can and now i can support them\n[Music]\nit's a great awakening\nthe universe has stepped in or god has\nstepped in or whatever it is has stepped\nin and said enough is enough wake the\nup\nchange what you're doing because it's\nunsustainable\nit's time to wake up we've been zombies\nfor way too long\nwe've been zombies we've been asleep\nthat's why it's called the awakening we\nare waking up we are now\nquote unquote woke\nto what's going on around us\nthere's so much darkness that could be\nfound in the world but i'll tell you\nthis there's so much more light that's\nin the world\nso instead of going out there and being\nthe darkness why don't we go out there\nand be the light because the only way to\nget rid of light\nor the only way to get rid of darkness\nis to get it\nthe only way to get rid of darkness\nis to bring the light and the only way\nto bring the light is to be the change\nthat you want to see in the world\ncan i make other people\ngo vegan no i can't but i can do it and\npeople can ask me why i do it and i can\neducate them on it and maybe they'll\ndecide to eat a little bit less meat\nyou know i can't make people listen to\nsomebody else in their own opinion\nanother person's point of view or\nopinion but i can be there and do it and\nmaybe someone else will do and say you\nknow what i should do that as well you\ncan't change people if you want to think\nabout how hard it is to change people\nthink about how hard it is to change\nyourself\nand then realize it's near impossible to\nchange people\nbut if you can change yourself and you\ncan be the change that you want to be\nyou want to see in the world you start\nto be the lighthouse and you start to\nwake other people up around you so that\nthey can see maybe the changes that they\nshould make in the world as well\nthe number one thing that i recommend\nthat you do to make this year the\nabsolute best year of your life\ndo you want to know what it is develop\nyour\nwillpower make your mind your body your\nresilience your motivation in your drive\nthe strongest thing in your life\nso many people look up to other people\nand say oh man i wish i was motivated as\nthis person i wish i was driven as this\nperson do you want to know where that\ncomes from it's developed it's like a\nmuscle willpower is like a muscle to be\nable to go you know what i don't feel\nlike doing this but i know what i want\nmy life to be so i'm going to do it\nanyways i don't care what i feel like\ni'm going to do it anyways that is what\nwillpower is to have a goal of what you\nwant to work for to figure out what that\nis and to work at it no matter the\ncircumstances of each day no matter how\nyou feel each day it's to do it even\nwhen you don't want to do it\nand if you've been listening to my\npodcast for a while\nyou know i'm very big proponent on doing\nwhat you don't want to do why\nbecause if we're being honest we're all\npretty soft let's be honest like we're\nsoft if we think about our ancestors and\nall the stuff that our ancestors had to\ngo through compared to us we're freaking\nsoft we live in air-conditioned\nbuildings heated buildings we have our\nfood that we just walk into stores and\nget we don't have to hunt and gather and\nforage we don't have any battles that\nwe're really going to war with every\nsingle day we don't have to worry most\nof us about somebody walking into our\nhouse and trying to take our land from\nus every single day we are soft and we\ncan admit that can't we\nbut\nit doesn't mean that we can't build up\nthe resilience what it means is that\nwe've built up our softness and so we\nneed to develop this mind this iron mind\nthis mindset of i'm going to do it\nanyways because i know what i'm going to\ndo and a soft mind and a soft body does\nnot change the world a soft mind and\nsoft body does not change their own life\nand a soft mind and a soft body does not\nchange their family's life their\ncommunity's life and their loved ones\nlives at all and so it's up to us the\nresponsibility is up to us to make a\nchange\nyou know i saw a meme the other day and\ni've seen it many times i used to\nactually show it in presentations and\nit's this guy and it's a cartoon\nhe looks like he's a politician and he\nsays who wants change and you could see\nthe little bubble coming out of his\nmouth who wants change and everybody in\nthe crowd raises their hand and it's\nlike yeah everybody wants change and\nthen he says who wants to change and the\nvery next picture the cartoon right\nafter he says who wants to change\neverybody's hands are down because\neverybody wants something done for them\nbut they don't want to get off their ass\nand actually do it if you're listening\nto this podcast if my little bit\nhardcore\nsay it as it is\nappeals to you then you're probably the\ntype of person that's like i'm gonna go\nand get it i don't care i'm going to\nconquer myself right i'm going to\ndevelop the mind that i need to to get\nwhat i want in life and to impact the\nworld and ultimately what it comes down\nto is a comfort zone the last thing that\ni want to be stuck in going into 2021\nis 2020's comfort zone i don't want any\nof 2020 to come into 2021 with me i\ndon't know about you 2020 was actually a\npretty good year for me i enjoyed a lot\nof it for a lot of people it wasn't very\ngood and that's okay but it doesn't mean\nthat 2020 needs to carry on it means\nthat we need to cut ties with it we need\nto break free from it and we need to go\nwhat do i want you know this year was\ngreat for me this year wasn't great for\nme this year was okay for me\nbut next year is my year and i\nam going to figure out a way to get it\ndone to succeed to get what i want no\nmatter the circumstances i'm gonna get\nit once again what is that it's the\nwillpower to do what you don't want to\ndo to get out of your comfort zone\nand the way i always like to explain a\ncomfort zone that makes sense to a lot\nof people is this\nif you think of a rubber band if i had a\nrubber band in my hand and i'm pulling\nthe rubber band apart that's you\nstretching yourself stretching yourself\noutside of your comfort zone and i can't\ntell you how many people reach out to me\nand the number one thing i hear from\npeople who reach out to me is hey rob\ni'm really good at starting stuff on my\nchallenges and my goals and trying to go\nthrough but i'm really bad at finishing\nwhat should i do about finishing that's\none of the main things that i hear from\npeople i'm really good at starting i get\nreally excited that i never finish\nanything so i never get my goals hit i\ndon't make the money that i wanted of\nthe life that i want because i don't\nfinish anything that i actually start\nthe reason why is because if you think\nof a rubber band if you're pulling it\npeople will pull themselves and pull\nthemselves and pull themselves and\nstretch their comfort zone and stretch\nit for three days four days five days\nsix days ten days and then what happens\nthey start shrinking back they start\ndoing the things that got them in the\ncomforters in the first place they start\nsleeping in they stop going to the gym\nthey stop\nreading the books they stop meditating\nthey stop eating healthy they go back to\ndrinking whatever it is and slowly but\nsurely that rubber band goes back to the\nsame size because we start to fall back\nin our old habits\nwhat do you need to do\nyou need to break it\nthat's what you need to do you need to\nbreak your comfort zone you need to\nbreak the rubber band so if you pull a\nrubber band long enough left further far\nenough and you keep pulling and pulling\nand pulling and pulling and pulling\neventually it's going to snap\nthat's what we're trying to do we're\ntrying to pull ourselves for so long\noutside of our comfort zone and pull and\npull and pull every single day and be\nconsistent and pull pull pull pull until\nwe've broken out of our comfort zone and\nwe've created a new version of ourselves\nthat's what we're trying to work towards\nthat's what we're trying to build we're\ntrying to consistently push ourselves\nevery single day that's the value into\nit we're trying to bring a brand new\ncomfort zone into 2021 that doesn't look\nany like anything like any other comfort\nzone we've ever had because it's so much\nbigger and so much more expansive and we\nas a person are so much better than we\nhave ever been\nand the thing that i think that most\npeople need to think about\nis a phrase to do what you don't want to\ndo\ni love it to wake up and to eat the frog\nwhat does that mean if you've never\nheard the phrase eat the frog what it is\nis there's one thing\nat least one thing but there's always\none thing every single day that you have\nto do that you don't want to freaking do\nthat you're dreading doing and you\ndefinitely don't want to do it and what\ndo they say eat that frog first thing in\nthe morning eat the frog\nbecause who would want to eat a frog\nnobody wants to eat a frog so if you\nthink of it that way of like i'm going\nto eat this frog this thing that is\nstaring at me i'm going to just say you\nknow what\npop it in my mouth i'm going for it baby\ni'm going to eat that frog this is the\nbenefit of doing the things that you\ndon't want to do to push yourself a\nlittle bit more a little bit more a\nlittle bit more a little bit more a\nlittle bit more over and over and over\nand over and over again\nand that's the reason why you're going\nto be outside of your comfort zone and\nto do what you don't want to do the\nperfect example for me is i hate cold\nshowers if you follow me on instagram if\nyou don't you need to follow me on\ninstagram rob dial junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r\nyou've seen my instagram stories lately\ni've been outside of my 40-degree pool\nwhen it's 35 degrees outside it's cold\nas hell and i've been sitting there for\n15\n16 17 minutes inside of that pool it's\nnot because i'm weird and sadistic and\ni'm like i'm gonna torture myself today\nno it's because i don't want to do it\nand i know that the voice that's saying\nhey man don't go in the pool today\nis the same voice that says hey man\nsleep in today hey man don't go to the\ngym hey have that extra slice of pizza\nhey don't eat this out hey you know\nthat's that little voice that pops up\neverywhere my job\nevery single day is to literally conquer\nthat inner voice the funny thing about\nthe whole iron mind challenge i was\ntelling you about the beginning here\nis that the number one thing that people\nare most afraid of is the cold showers\nwhat the hell it's literally just\ngetting your your naked body into a cold\nshower just cold water on your skin will\nyou die\nno but that's the funny thing about the\nlittle voice inside of your head is it\nbuilds it up as if it's this big\nmonstrous thing that's going to kill you\nand in reality it's literally you versus\nyou your entire life everything\nthat you do\nis a battle of you versus you\nyou the person that wants to build a\nlife that you want and you on the other\nside that's trying to hold yourself in\nyour comfort zone because you've been\nthere for so long it's you versus you\nit's not you versus a government or you\nversus the president or you versus you\nknow what your parents said when you\nwere younger what your teachers said or\nwhat you were raised with no it's never\nanybody else outside of you it's you\nversus you it will be for the rest of\nyour life and it always has been your\nentire life so if you're not in the\nposition that you want to be in your\nlife right now it's because the view\nthat's holding you back has been holding\nyou back and you've been listening too\nmuch to it that to it too much if you\nare where you want to be it's because\nyou've been conquering that little voice\nconquering that little inside of\nyou that's the thing it's so funny how\nmany people are like oh yeah i would\njoin the iron mind challenge but i just\ndon't want to take the cold showers well\nthat's because we've come too soft right\nit's literally just a cold shower\nthere's obviously a lot of physical\nbenefits for it you can google it of how\ngood it is for your cardiovascular\nsystem for your skin for so many\ndifferent things there's a lot of\nbenefits to that but on the other side\nthe reason why i really like it besides\nall of those things is because the\nbattle of my life is me versus me it's\nalways been me versus me it will always\nbe me versus me and so i'm going to wake\nup every single day and either take a\ncold shower or jump in my freezing cold\npool\nand the reason why is because i'm trying\nto conquer that little voice inside of\nmy head and i don't want to do it that's\nwhy i do it\nthat's the crazy part it makes sense but\nat the same time you're like this is\ncrazy the reason why you do it is\nbecause you don't want to do it\nthat's why it's really not hard it's not\nscientific and this big huge thing where\nyou got to break it down no it's so\nsimple\nthere's two sides of you that are always\na battle like i said there's a you that\nwants this amazing life and a lot of\nmoney and a lot of happiness and success\nand traveling and\ngiving your kids everything that you\nnever had and all of this joy and peace\nand love that you want in your life\nthere's that side of you that wants to\nto bring out your full potential to the\nworld and there's the other side of you\nthat you can't get to shut up\nand what do we need to do we need to\nwake up every single day and do what we\ndon't want to do to make that little\nvoice that's holding us back diminished\na little bit every single day a little\nbit every single day a little bit every\nsingle day and when you wake up in the\nmorning and you have something like that\nit's a win and when you can start your\nday off with a win it builds so much\nmomentum into everything else you know\nif there's something that i don't want\nto do in my business or i don't want to\ndo\nyou know anywhere\nif i've woken up and i've jumped inside\nof a cold pool i've jumped inside of a\ncold shower and i've conquered that the\nrest of the day is easy i've got\nmomentum on my side that's the beautiful\nthing about it and so that's what i want\nyou to realize there's always two sides\nof you there's a side of you that's like\nthat wants greatness and there's a side\nof you that's comfortable there's the\nside of you that that wants to get out\nof bed and have a beautiful morning\nroutine and there's a side of you it's\nlike damn this bed is so comfortable\nmaybe i should sleep in a little bit and\nstart tomorrow there's the side of you\nthat wants to go to the gym and there's\na side of you it's like damn pizza\nsounds good there's a side of you that\nwants to go out and create the success\nthat you want to that's just you can\nsupport your family at a higher level\nand then there's a side of you that's\nlike well maybe i should stay on\ninstagram so the whole day right so\nthere's two sides of you constantly a\nbattle which one are you going to let\nwin because ultimately whichever one\nwins is going to dictate what your life\nis going to be\nand if you've been listening to the show\nlong enough you know that my number one\nfear is to get to end of my life be on\nmy deathbed and wish that i would have\ndone more that i would have helped more\npeople that i would have pulled out more\npotential that i would have had more\nhappiness more joy more peace\nyou know that's what my biggest fear is\nand so i'm working to bring out the the\ngreatness inside of me every single day\ndo i win every single day not every\nsingle day\nbut the majority of days i win and i\nchalk that up as a win and so that's the\nreason why you've got to work towards\nconsistency of doing the things that you\ndon't want to do every single day to\nmake that little voice that's inside of\nyour head diminished\nyou've gotta listen you've gotta listen\nyou've gotta listen your life is\ndictated by the actions that you take\nand the one the way you do one thing is\nthe way you do everything so if you're\nafraid of jumping into a cold shower\nyou're probably afraid of other little\ntiny things inside of your life if\nyou're coming up short on your workouts\nyou're probably coming up short in your\nrelationships if you're coming up short\nin the workouts you're also probably\ncoming up short in your business in your\nfinances and everything else\nand so for me\nwhat i try to do is just try to build\nthe resilience up of i'm going to create\nthe life that i want\nand in order to do that i've got to\ndevelop discipline i've got to have a\nwillpower that will just run through a\nfreaking wall no matter what\nand believe me i wasn't born with it i'm\nstill working at it i'm way better than\ni ever have been and i'm getting better\nevery single day at it but i want you to\nstart thinking about yourself start\nthinking about the way you do one thing\nis the way to do everything where are\nyou coming up short where are you\nstaying in your comfort zone where are\nyou not showing up fully where are you\ngiving up too early because if you're\ndoing that you're also do in one place\nin your life you're doing it everywhere\nin your life\nand that's going to make everything in\nyour life not as good as it could be\nso it's something to think about\nsomething to dive into is something to\nreally be serious about and say where do\ni need to develop\nthe willpower in my life\nand start identifying little pieces of\nyour life little places where you could\nshow up better\nmaybe you listen to me talk and you're\nlike\nyeah this cold shower thing sounds like\nit sucks but it does kind of make some\nsense believe me it makes sense the\nfunny thing about these iron mine\nchallenges is at the end of it at the\nbeginning of it everyone freaking hates\nit they resent it they're pissed off\nit's the hardest thing for them is to\njust do a freaking cold shower for a\nminute or two\nby the end of it they're like that was\none of the most life-changing things\ni've ever done because every day i was\nworking at conquering my mind and so\nevery time that little voice came in and\nsaid hey man don't jump in the shower no\none's gonna know i had to click off my\nwillpower brain and say no thank you i'm\ngoing anyways\nand that's what we're trying to do\nbecause that's the same voice that pops\nup and says hey sleep in you're like no\nscrew you i'm getting up the one that\nsays hey don't go make the extra cold\ncalls you're like screw you i'm gonna go\ndo it anyways the one that says hey\ndon't go you know knock on those doors\nand do some some sales it's snowing\noutside and like screw you i'm going to\nput on my boots i'm going to go out i'm\ngoing to do it anyways that's what life\nis it's the internal battle of you\nversus you willpower and discipline\nversus comfort zone the question is\nwhich one are you going to listen to\nbecause it will ultimately dictate where\nyour life is going to be\nand i hope\ni hope i hope that you don't get to that\nin your life and wish that you would\nhave done more because then you can look\nback and go\nyeah\ni see where i should have been a little\nbit more disciplined i see where i\nshould have had more willpower see how\nmy family's life would have been better\nif i would have stepped\nup my number one goal for 2022 and what\ni would hope that you actually adopt as\nyour number one goal for 2022 as well\nand i i adopted this\nframe of mind last year this year that\nwe're in 2021 and it was my number one\ngoal and usually when we sit down and we\nsay okay these are my new year's\nresolutions this is what i wanted i want\nto work on my body i want to work in my\nbusiness i want to make more money i\nwant to have better relationships i want\nto be a better boyfriend girlfriend\nspouse\na better parent you can look at all\nthose and all of those are great but i\nhave one kind of umbrella\nover all of those things and i had it\nlast year i'm gonna have it this year\nagain and this is to live my life in\n2022 as if the very last day i'm going\nto be alive is december 31st 2022 so my\ngoal is to live every day like i'm dying\nevery single day my goal is this is my\nlast day on earth i'm going to live like\nthis is my last day and i'm going to\nhave everything build up to as if this\nis my last year that i'm going to be on\nearth because ultimately\nlet's be real i don't know if this is\ngoing to be my last year on earth i\ndon't know if this is going to be your\nlast year on earth and it very well\ncould be i say it all of the time but\n150 000 people didn't wake up from their\nsleep or didn't 150 000 people woke up\nyesterday did not wake up today in\nsaying that knowing okay one day it's\ngoing to be the day i don't know\nhopefully it's a long time from now one\nday it is going to be the last day of my\nlife whether i realize it or whether i\ndon't and so i'm going to pretend like\nthe year 2023 doesn't even exist it\ndoesn't exist in my mind i'm never going\nto see it i'm going to live like that\nnow hopefully i do see it but i'm going\nto live as if\nit was absolutely the last year of my\nlife and and going through this last\nyear with that number one intention\nhas shifted and changed a lot of things\nin my life and i told you this last year\nthat this was my goal if you've been\nlistening for a long time and i'm going\nto tell you that this year coming up it\nis also my goal again as well because as\ni said we're going to die it's going to\nhappen\nand you're not going to if this was the\nlast year of your life you're not going\nto do things that you don't want to do\nif i said hey today is the last day that\nyou're going to be alive\nyou're going to take no actions today\nthat are not things that you actually\nwant to do and this is important because\nif you've been listening long enough you\nknow that i live my life through a lens\nof if it's not a yes it's a no and so\nwhen you think to yourself if this was\nmy last day\nand i'm looking at my schedule and what\ni have to do today would this be what i\nwould do or would i do something\ndifferent is my day is today a full\nguess for me like am i so excited to go\ninto my day or am i waking up kind of\noh god i guess i gotta go ahead and do\nthis i guess i gotta go to work right so\nif i've had those feelings before when i\nworked for someone else there's nothing\nwrong with working for anybody i'm just\nthe type of person where i can't work\nfor anybody it's just not built into me\nbut if you're going to a job\nwhen you're driving to your job are you\nexcited about the opportunities that you\nhave are you excited about what it is\nthat you're going to do is your job a\nfull yes for you is your relationship\nthat you're in a full yes for you i've\nhad people that have emailed me it's\nkind of funny since the very first time\nthat i did my\nyes no episode about a year and a half\nago and they're like i have changed so\nmany aspects of my life\ni have somebody who is a friend of mine\nthat literally got out of a relationship\na long term it was like five year\nrelationship\nbecause they listen to the episode and\nthey ask themselves is my relationship\nthat i'm in a full yes\nand they started going through the\naspects of i'm thinking of it saying oh\nmy gosh it's actually not like i'm\nliving in a relationship and i love this\nperson and they're great but if i look\ninto to what the future looks like if we\nstay together\nam i like a full yes knowing that this\nis my one life when you go through your\nday and you go through everything that\nyou do throughout the day ask yourself\nthis question is what i'm doing right\nnow full yeah it's like is this\nsomething that i'm a hundred percent yes\ni love this so when i wake up in the\nmorning and i the the coffee that i\ndrink is it today is it is it coffee for\nme does that feel like it's a full yes\nfor me or does today feel like a tea day\nlike i you know coffee maybe it makes me\na little bit more anxious than tea does\nso maybe it today is more of a tea day\nor you know what today it's actually\nneither one of them i don't need the\ncaffeine to get up and it might be on\nthe weekend and you might say you know\nwhat\ni don't need to put myself into a little\nbit more of an anxious state so is it\nthe coffee that you drink is it a hell\nyes for you is it the food that you eat\nin the morning is it a hell yes free is\nyour morning routine what's your morning\nroutine look like is it a hell yes for\nyou is it your your workout process is\nit a hell yes for you the people that\nyou're spending your morning with you\nknow if you're spending your morning and\nyou're just going straight into work in\nemails and everything and you're missing\nyour kids when they leave for school\nis that a hell yes for you i have a lot\nof people that that i've worked with in\nthe past one-on-one clients that are you\nknow very successful people they have\ngreat businesses and what's really\ninteresting is that their number one\ngoal is just to be able to start taking\ntheir kids to school every single\nmorning because they love that routine\nand their business has taken so much\nfrom that they built a business to not\nhave time to drop their kids off at\nschool and they just love having that\npresent moment with them so if you look\nat your morning routine is there some\nchanges that you could make that would\nbe like hey this is a full hell\nyesterday this is a full yes this is\nwhat i want to do or are there aspects\nof it that you would want to shift okay\ngoing into work whether you have your\nown business or you work for somebody\nelse is it a full yes for you as well\nlike are you like yes this is what i\nwant to do the\ntimes that i'm spending my waking hours\nthis is exactly what i want to be doing\nwith my life and all too often i find\npeople\nsettle they do what they feel like\nthey're supposed to do and i understand\nif you have a family or if you have a\nhouse and you have bills that you have\nto pay there are certain obligations\nthat you have built your built into your\nlife i get it i understand it but what i\nalways say to people is if if your job\nis not like\na hell yes for you okay well what would\nbe a hell yes for you you know can you\nmake your job that you currently have or\nyour business that you currently have\nlike full-on yes this is what i want to\nbe doing is there ways to shift that can\nyou have a conversation with your\nmanager about some of the things that\nyou do so that your job can be more of a\nhell yes for you\nor are you working a job where you're\njust showing up you're going to a\ncubicle and you're doing things that you\nhave to do and you know that there's no\nweight around it okay\nmaybe you look at that and you say well\nif this is my last day on earth it's my\nlast year on earth i'm going to live\nlike i'm dying this year and i know i\ngot to go to work because i got to pay\nthe bills if this is my last year on\nlife\nlast year with life\ncan i do something that i actually love\nto do can i do something that feels like\nit's it's\nworking towards the right direction so\nmaybe it's like you know is there\nanother job that might pay you about the\nsame maybe it pays you a little more\nmaybe it pays you a little less but you\nfeel\nso good going into that job doing what\nit is that you're doing is it a hell yes\nfor you is it something that you want to\ndo the the route that you take to work\nis it a hell yes for you you know maybe\nyou've got a route to work that's the\nfaster way but maybe you could go a more\nscenic more beautiful route that puts\nyou in nature that feels better for you\nand you just enjoy that drive more\nsometimes enjoying the drive is worth\nthe extra time so like i'll give you a\ngood example when we drive from austin\ndown to san antonio to go see my\nfiance's parents\nthere's a route that will take us to san\nantonio and it's about 15 minutes\nshorter if we take all of the\ninterstates or we can drive through\ntexas hill country then we can see\nnature and it's beautiful and you can\nsee the sunrise you can see the sunset\nand even though it takes 15 minutes\nlonger it makes the drive more enjoyable\nwe go the extra 15 minutes because it\nmakes the two to two hours and 15\nminutes a more enjoyable process is\nthere a route that you can do in that\nthat would be something that would\nbetter for you the route that you take\nto work when you get into your car\nis your car like a full hell yes for you\ni'm not saying you have to drive like a\nlamborghini or a ferrari or anything\nlike that but can you make the car that\nyou currently have more of a hell yes\nfor you can you make uh make some\nadjustments and maybe\nchange your car around a little bit or\nmaybe just in general is there another\ncar that you could get that could be a\nhell yes for you there's all these\nlittle teeny tiny changes that you start\nto go through in your life you start to\nmake shifts so that you actually enjoy\nwhat you're doing i had a conversation\nwith a friend of mine\nvery successful guy he's in his 50s and\nat the time he's worth about 100 million\ndollars and i was about to interview him\nfor the podcast about five years ago\nfour years ago whatever it was\nand at that point in time i was driving\na 2007 hyundai santa fe and i could\nafford another car at that point in time\nbut my\nmy mindset around this car was that i'm\ngonna run this freaking thing into the\nground like i i was getting pride in the\nfact that i was gonna run this thing to\nthe ground and he said he said one thing\nto me that i'll never forget\nhe wasn't trying to talk me into\nanything\nbut we were talking about cars and stuff\nand he drives like a lexus nothing you\nknow no ferraris or lamborghinis or any\nof that type of stuff and he goes you\nknow what\ni just find that when i drive a car that\ni enjoy i show up better like i show up\nbetter\nfor whatever it is i'm doing when i get\nthere and i enjoy myself more in that\ncar and he gave me this whole how he\nfeels\nand immediately i was like\ni gotta buy something else and i told\nhim this i was like i have to buy\nsomething else and about a month later i\nwent and bought a truck because i had\nyou know found the truck that i wanted\nit you know got really good gas mileage\ncompared to everything else that i'd\nseen and i'd always wanted a truck my\nentire life\nand i was like you know what\ni want to get this truck and i got it\nand i realized what he was talking about\nlike i instead of getting into my car\nand there's a there's a energy in the\nback of my head of like yeah screw this\nhyundai santa fe it was like i was\nactually excited to get into my car\nbecause i loved the truck that i had and\nso there was this little shift and did\nit cost me more money sure but what\nhappened was i realized exactly what he\nwas saying was true is that i showed up\nbetter to everything that i did i wasn't\nthere wasn't a part of me that was like\noh my gosh i'm gonna have to i'm gonna\nhave to park my 2007 hyundai santa fe in\nthe back so nobody sees me driving my\nyou know it's a light blue 2007 hyundai\nsanta fe it's called the the mom mobile\nbecause it looked like i was about to\ndrop kids off at school or at soccer\npractice and i don't have any kids but i\nwas driving the freaking thing around\nstill from years and years and years\nwhen i was an outside sales rep because\nit used to store stuff really well\nand i i was kind of embarrassed by the\ncar but took some pride and i'm going to\nrun this thing to the ground\nand then i was i had this conversation i\nshifted i was like i'm gonna buy\nsomething new something that i enjoy and\ni bought it and i was like he's right he\nwas right he was 100 right i show up\nbetter the entire time that i'm driving\nlike if you think of how many hours you\ndrive over the course of an entire year\nwell shouldn't those hours be more\nenjoyable you know the music that you\nlisten to the podcasts that you listen\nto the youtube stations that you can\nlisten to as you're driving like are all\nof those things yes is for you if this\nwas your last year on life what would\nyou be doing would you be listening to\nsomething that you enjoy more would you\nbe filling your mind with something that\nmakes you feel better so that you show\nup better so that you can impact more\npeople and so you start to think of all\nthese little teeny tiny aspects of your\nlife\nin the the everything that you have and\ngo you know what maybe i should shift\nthis maybe i should change this around a\nlittle bit you know you look at the the\npeople that you work with the people\nthat are around you maybe you like your\njob but you hate your co-workers okay\nwell is there a way to shift that so\nthat you can enjoy every aspect of your\njob more often is uh you know the people\nin your life the people that you hang\nout with the most are you like full hell\nyes on these people or and i put up a\npost on instagram about the other day\nlike you've got to be okay with\nunfollowing some people from your life\nsame way that you unfollow somebody on\nfacebook or instagram when they're not\nyou know they're putting up too much\nposts that make you feel bad or they're\nnot you know they're just too negative\nor in the comment section talking trash\nwith people and you can see their\ncomments pop up when you're scrolling\nthrough facebook because they you know\nwent on a political post or whatever it\nis and started bashing people and you\ncan see those things well are there\npeople that are kind of like that as\nwell in your life where you're like i\nshouldn't follow this if this person\nwere on facebook and i saw the way that\nthey're talking to people around me i\nsaw the way they're treating myself and\nall of this would i unfo would i block\nthem on facebook and you start to look\nat the people in your life and change\nthose things the p the place that you go\nout to lunch the food that you're eating\nyour drive home or all of those things\nhell yes is for you or are they just\nthings that you're just you've been\ndoing them for so long there your mind\njust kind of goes numb and you don't\neven pay attention anymore and so you\nstart to go through every single aspect\nyour drive home your evening routines\nright is it you come home and you just\nput something in the microwave and you\nspend two hours watching netflix and\nthen you just go to bed at 11 o'clock\nand you know you're kind of tired and\nall that stuff do you have an evening\nroutine that fills you up that makes you\nfeel good do you are you reading books\ninstead are you journaling are you doing\na short meditation an evening routine to\nset your subconscious of the way that\nyou want to\nthe time that you get in bed the bed\nthat you have you know like there's all\nof these little tiny things that if we\nwere to go through with with a\nfine-tooth comb and try to pull out\neverything that we like\nand keep it and pull out everything we\ndon't like and replace it what aspects\nof your life would you change would you\nbe like you know what i kind of hate my\nbed i'm going to get a more comfortable\nbed because this is my last year on\nearth\nand start to change all of these things\nyou go through your life and find out\nwhat is a full hell yes for you and what\nis you know a hell no for you are you\ndoing what you want to do and this is an\nimportant question i'm going to ask you\nand i ask this all the time a lot of\ntimes when i'm on lives and i'm on zoom\ncalls and people are you know i\nliterally did this earlier today i was\non a\nconsultation call with somebody i was\nconsulting somebody who has a business\nand their business does a few million\ndollars a year and i said hey talk to c\nand i said hey you know we're going into\nreally deep of things we're talking\nabout here but\nhey man what do you want and he's like\nwhat do you mean i was like what do you\nwant like what do you actually want when\nwe can build out the systems and the\nprocesses and the marketing and the\nsales team and all of this stuff and we\ncan help you with that but what do you\nactually want because i don't want to\nbuild something and have you put a whole\nlot of time into something when you\ndon't even actually want that thing\nbecause if you have something that you\nwant you're going to put hours into it\nand be more focused into making it\nbetter if you have something that you\ndon't want it's going to make building\nthis team building this product that\nyou're selling building this offer\nbuilding the marketing behind it putting\nthe sales funnel together and putting\nthe video sales letter and all those\nthings together\nit's going to be more energy consuming\nto have to force yourself to do it\nversus feeling like hell yeah i want to\ndo this thing and so you look at and ask\nyourself like what do you actually want\nand that's a great question to write\ndown on pen and paper like what do i\nwant and just make it as broad as you\npossibly can and answer that question\nthen you can take the exact same\nquestion and you can put it in each\naspect of your life what do i want in my\nfamily\nand then you can journal through that\nwhat do i want in my body what do i want\nin my health what do i want in my\nrelationships what do i want in my\nbusiness what do i want in my finances\nwhat do i want in the route that i take\nto work what do i want in the food that\ni eat what do i want in my morning\nroutine what do i want in my evening\nroutine what do i want to do with my\nfree time what do i want to do in my\ntraveling and you can go very vague what\ndo i want and then just see what you\nwant and you get very greatly go what do\ni want in my business and you can say\nokay what i want my business you could\njournal through it you can look through\nand say okay\nwhat do i want in my sales team what do\ni want in my marketing if you look at\nyour relationships and you say what do i\nwant in my marriage what do i want in my\nin my relationship with my children what\nam i what are my relationship with my\nmom and my dad my brother my sister my\ncousins what do i want in every single\naspect of my life and you start to plan\nout to build what would be the perfect\nlife knowing that you might not be able\nto take action on every single thing\nright now\nbut what do you want\nnow let's go a little bit deeper you\nlook at every single one of those as\nwell and this is a great exercise i\nimplore all of you to do this\nplease do this\nthen you ask yourself what do i not want\nso what do i not want in my life oh you\nknow what i don't want any more negative\npeople okay great i don't want\nconversations that don't have the energy\nof transformation in them anymore\nwhat do i not want in my relationships\nwhat do i not want in my family what do\ni not want in my business what do i not\nwant in my marketing what do i not want\nin my uh my sales process what do i not\nwant in every single aspect of what i do\nwhat do i not want in my car what do i\nnot want in the drive to work and you\nstart to figure out what it is that you\nwant and what is it you don't want\nyou'll start to realize that you have a\nlot of processes and things that you go\nthrough and routines every single day\nthat you don't even want to do and if\nthis were the last time that you're\ngonna be like this is your last day on\nearth what are you going to do about it\nlike would you want to do those things\nthat you don't want to do anymore no and\nso why would we act as if we have\nforever why would we act as if we have a\nmillion years on this earth why we act\nas if we're just guaranteed tomorrow if\nwe're just guaranteed another year and\nyou start to build out what would be\nfrom this process\nyou start to build out the perfect day\nfor you the perfect life for you and\nsomething that is going to be exciting\nfor you to wake up and get into\nand that's going to make every single\nday better but what's going to happen is\nyou're going to start to notice that if\nyou do this and you get very diligent on\ndoing the things you want and doing not\ndoing the things you don't want you're\ngoing to start to actually realize\nyou're building your perfect life and i\nhave a friend who\nhe was a number 30 employee in facebook\nand when he got fired from facebook\nright before they went public a few\nmonths before they went public\nand when he got fired he lost all of his\nstock in facebook and if he would have\njust been there for a few more months\nwhen they went public he would have made\n180 million dollars and he went into a\ndepression because he went from\nliterally you know i could have made 180\nmillion dollars to i have nothing right\nnow and one of the phrases that will\nstick with me for the rest of my life is\nthe thing that got him out of depression\nis he asked himself what would make me\nhappy like what would make me happy make\nthis massive list of all of the things\nthat made him happy and the phrase that\nhe said that i'll never forget today i\ndie i will not let my happiness or my\ndepression be left up to chance and too\nmany of our lives are left up to chance\nand we just go with the flow he became\nvery diligent on making sure that he\nlooked at his happy list every single\nmorning he looked at his schedule next\nto his happy list every single morning\nhe said how can i put as many of these\nthings in here as possible like what do\ni what do i love what makes me happy\ngoing on walks okay how can i do a walk\nin the forest\noutside of austin because we have a lot\nof trails around here how can i do a\nwalk today in that hour long break that\ni have for work and he started building\nin everything that makes him happy\neverything that he wants into his life\nand he started realizing that his\ndepression slowly started going away\nbecause he wasn't doing anything they\ndidn't want to do anymore and so i want\nyou to realize that your day will come\nmy day will come all of our days will\ncome at some point in time it just makes\nmore sense for us to live a life that we\nabsolutely love but it starts with\nliving each day and the next year that\nwe have living a life that we love so be\nintentional with every single thing that\nyou do and you will realize that you\nhave built a life that you actually love\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well\npretend that there's no such thing as\nquote-unquote being realistic because\nbeing realistic really just means\nsetting self-limiting beliefs because\nnothing is realistic except for what you\nsay is\nyou"
