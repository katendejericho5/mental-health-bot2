    "transcript": "set your intention every single day to\nbecome the person that you want to be so\nthat then you can create the life that\nyou want to it's literally this you have\na very precious life that you have in a\nvery limited amount of time and mental\nenergy stop wasting it on things that do\nnot matter and your life will not be the\nsame it will be measurably different\nso we're going to go through a certain a\nfew aspects of your life and i want you\nto be as open honest and vulnerable with\nyourself right now if you have a pen and\npaper right now would be the best time\nto go grab that pen and paper if you're\ndriving your car make some mental notes\ntry to figure it out grab some pen and\npaper later\nwe're going to dive in and actually\nfigure out\nwhere you are currently in your life\nand\nyou know if you want to throw away this\npiece of paper when you're done throw it\naway but that way you can at least be\nopen honest and vulnerable with yourself\nso we're going to go through a few\naspects of your life and i want you to\ngive yourself a rating on a scale of one\nto ten okay so the first one we're going\nto dive into is your career or your\nbusiness if you were to look at your\ncareer or your business or where you\ncurrently are in your career and you\nwere to look at and enrich yourself on a\nscale of one to ten one being like it is\nabsolutely in shambles i have no career\ni'm homeless i don't have a job like it\none is like really really really bad 10\nis is your career is perfect it can't\nget any better you can't make any more\nmoney you can't have any more impact in\nthe world you can't get any promotions\nany of that stuff if you were to look at\nyourself and rate your career on a scale\nof one to ten what would you rate\nyourself\nthink about it\nyour career you know how long you've\nbeen there how long you want to stay if\nyou're\nclose to an ex promotion whatever it is\non a scale of one to ten what would you\nrate yourself go ahead and write that\nnumber down next thing\nis your relationships okay this can be\nyour romantic relationships this can be\nyour friendships this can be your\nbusiness this could be your network this\ncan be the top five people that you\nspend the most time with this can be\nyour mentors this can be every single\nother\nbreathing human that you have a\nrelationship with if you were to look it\non scale one to ten one being like you\nhave no friends nobody loves you they\nnever have you don't have anybody on\nyour phone you have nobody on your\nfriends on facebook that would be a 1. a\n10 would be like there is absolutely no\nway that any of my relationships could\never improve so on a scale of 1 to 10\nwhat would you rate\nyour relationships go ahead and write\nthe number down\nokay\nnext one intellectual\nwhen we're looking at yourself\nintellectually this could be the reading\nthat you've been doing lately all of the\nlearning courses that you've been taking\nthe conferences or events that you've\nbeen going to\nthe podcast that you've been listening\nto the youtube stations that you've been\nlearning from intellectually how you've\nbeen growing over the past couple months\non a scale of one to ten one being like\nthis podcast that you listen to right\nnow is the very first one you've ever\nlistened to you haven't been learning\nyou haven't been growing you've been\nterrible you've never read a book before\nall of those things 10 being like there\nis absolutely no way on god's green\nearth that i can improve intellectually\ni am perfect i know everything that\nthere ever has been on the entire world\non a scale of one to ten what would you\nrate yourself intellectually\nokay write that down next one your\nphysical body when you look at your\nphysical body on a scale of one to ten\nwould you rate yourself so this is your\nyour body how you feel\nhow much you work out the type of food\nthat you eat if you're sore throughout\nthe day if you have any\njoint issues how you sleep\nall of that stuff is considered your\nphysical body what would you rate\nyourself on a scale of one to ten with\nyour physical body one being like it's\nterrible you need a uh you know a crane\nto pick you up in in to be able to get\nyou out of the house maybe and you've\nnever eaten healthy food in your entire\nlife and maybe you've never worked out\nmaybe you uh don't eat well maybe you\nfeel like crap you sleep like crap all\nof that stuff 10 being you have the most\nperfect body that anyone has ever seen\nyou might as well just put it in statues\nbecause there will never be a better\nbody than yours and it's perfect right\nthat would be your physical so i just\nhave one to ten what would you rate\nyourself physically next one emotional\nstate how do you feel throughout the day\nare you happy are you sad are you\nanxious how do you talk to yourself how\ndo you feel and think are you positive\nare you negative on a scale of one to\nten what would you rate yourself\nemotionally one would be like you're a\ncomplete absolute emotional wreck ten\nbeing you are the most perfect emotional\nbeing that has ever existed on this\nplanet what would you rate yourself on a\nscale of one to ten emotionally and then\nlast but not least is spiritually for\nyou this could be church this could be\nreligion this could be spirituality this\ncould be yoga this could be meditation\nthis could be temple this could be\nashram this could be whatever it is that\nyou believe in spiritually is just the\ngrowth of feeling like you're growing as\na human\noutside of just your intellectual\nknowledge your well-being all that stuff\nis in there on a scale of one to ten\nmodulate yourself spiritually now what\nwe just went through is a super simple\nprocess and i call it cripes i made this\nup it's\nc-r-i-p-e-s cripes\nc-r-i-p-e-s now you can do this with\nyourself\nevery single week it takes maybe\nfour minutes\nyou know like four minutes to go through\nthis entire thing and what you're doing\nis you're getting a pretty good lay of\nthe land as to how you've been over the\npast week and here's what you want to do\nyou want to take all of those numbers\nand for those guys that wrote all this\ndown you take all those numbers and you\nadd them up get your phone get your\ncalculator whatever it is what number do\nyou come to you add it up\nand then you divide it by six and that's\ngoing to show you\nyour average score you might come up\nwith like a 6.35\nright if you come up with a 6.35 all you\nhave to do is move that decimal over to\nthe to the right one spot so if it's a\n6.35 you'd move it over one spot and\nthat would be a 63.5\nthat is the score that you've given\nyourself on your life and you've been\nhonest with yourself now here's the\nfirst thing before you go any further\ni'm going to preface this and say this\ndon't look at this number or look at any\nof these numbers or where you are\ncurrently in your life and start to get\nemotional about it you have to look at\nit very objectively as if you're just\nlooking at a grade and you're grading a\ntest from somebody else that's all that\nyou have to do and you have to look at\nit and say how can i improve this\nbecause that's what we're going to talk\nabout next and you have to realize this\nlet me just show you i don't know how it\nis outside of america because i've never\ntaken any classes outside of america but\nfrom 90 to 100 is an a\nfrom 80 to 89 is a b\nfrom 70 to 79 is a c\nfrom 60 to 69 is a d and then from 59\nand below is 59 and lower than that is\nan f right so if we go back to my score\nof 6.35 if that was what i had and i\nmoved the decimal to the right one place\nthat would give me a 63.5 percent so if\ni'm looking as to if i were to give\nmyself a grade on how my life has been\nright there i gave myself a d now i\nmight look at me like oh my god my life\nis in shambles it's a d all this stuff\nno no once again look at it objectively\nand say okay now let me figure out how i\ncan improve this i'm looking at it\nobjectively as if it's just a test grade\nthat's somebody else that i'm scoring\nand i'm going to look at it as\nobjectively as possible and i'm going to\nsee how i can improve it now immediately\nwhen people see these numbers the first\ntime i usually take somebody through\nthis process they're like oh my gosh how\ndo i get to any i need to get to an as\nsoon as possible i'm not worried about\nyou getting two in it i'm literally just\nworried about you going one test grade\nup that's all i'm worried about so in\nthis case if i were to have a d\nhow do i get myself to a c i'm gonna\nlook at every single one of these things\nthat i just went over and i'm gonna see\nhow i can improve myself\nover the next 30 days\nin each category by one point right so\nthis is super simple follow with me now\nwe're gonna look at every single one of\nthese categories and we're gonna figure\nout how we can improve each of them by\none point my career i'm gonna ask myself\na simple question\nhow could i raise this score whatever it\nis that i wrote down over to the side by\none point let's say i rated myself a\nseven in my career what would i need to\ndo over the next 30 days to raise this\nnumber two and eight there's a certain\npeople i can connect with is there a\ncouple deals that i need to close\nuh do i need to make myself more\nvaluable to the company do i need to go\nclose another sale do i need to start\nyou know i have my own business and i\nneed to to hire somebody what would take\nmy career\nfrom a seven to an eight we'll just\nraise it one point in the next 30 days\nnow i've got my hit list of what i need\nto do\nto improve my career over the next 30\ndays i've got a laser focus\nthat i've got to get on this now okay i\nknow where i am i know where i'm going\nnow all i've got to do is execute\nperfect boom this is easy isn't it\nexcuse me now let's go to relationships\nnow we look at relationships like\ncoughing on my own choking mom spit over\nhere\nwe're looking at relationships\nand we're going into relationships let's\nsay i relate my relationships of six\nhow what do i need to do\nto raise my relationships from a six to\na seven over the next 30 days all right\nmaybe i need to take my girlfriend on a\ndate every single friday

to do to\nimprove this score by one point over the\nnext 30 days and then i just write my\nanswers down so what are the answers for\nyou you can pause me if you want to you\ncan literally start working through this\nright now\nnow you've got your hit list of exactly\nwhat you need to do over the next 30\ndays all right let's go to the next one\nintellectually when i'm looking my\nintellectual let's say my intellectuals\nare five okay what do i need to do to\nraise this intellectual score from a\nfive to a six over the next 30 days now\nyou know what i need to do i need to\nmake it\na practice to wake up every single\nmorning and to read 10 pages there's\nalso you know somebody that i've been\nfollowing on youtube and i need to start\nwatching more of his stuff because i\nfeel like i learned a lot more about\nwhatever it is neurobiology because\nthat's what i've been wanting to learn\nabout right what do i need to do over\nthe next 30 days to raise my\nintellectual score from a five\nto a six write all the answers down\npause me if you need to\nnow you've got a hit list\nof everything that you need to do so you\nknow what you need to do over the next\n30 days to improve it let's go to\nphysical body let's say my physical body\nis at a seven\nwhat do you need to do to raise it from\na seven to an eight what do you need to\ndo as far as your sleep as far as how\nyou feel you need to stretch more do you\nneed to eat healthier food eat more\nsalads eat more protein\nwork out\ninstead of two times a week i need to\nwork out four times a week what do you\nneed to do over the next 30 days to\nimprove your physical score from\nwhatever it is you wrote down from a\nseven to an eight now you've got a hit\nlist of everything that you need to do\nfor your physical body all right what\nabout my emotional state let's say i\nrated my emotional state of six what do\ni need to do to raid my emotion raise my\nemotional state from a six to a seven i\nneed to i need to spend less time around\nmy friends who are negative i need to\nstop myself in the middle of anxious\nthoughts so that i can pull myself out\nof those anxious thoughts and i can\nstart to\nthink about something that i'm grateful\nfor right what do you need to do to\nraise your emotional score by one point\npause me if you need to write it down\nlet's come up with a plan and last but\nnot least spiritually spiritually just\nfeels like i'm growing myself and\ngrowing my spirituality whether that's\nmy religion whether that's yoga whether\nthat's meditation whether that's breath\nwork being more in tune with my body\njust sitting in silence more i don't\nknow what whatever it is for you what is\nwhat does that mean to you spirituality\na real good thing that i'll tell you\nabout spirituality that might actually\nhelp a lot of you guys i did an event\nnot long ago and it was just my team\nmembers and we were talking about\nspirituality and in you know what they\nwould rate themselves on a scale of one\nto ten so we went through this process\nand one of my team members said what do\nyou mean by spirituality like i'm really\nconfused and this is the the the answer\nthat i gave him i said the most\nspiritual person i've ever met is a guy\nnamed radhanath swami and radha swami is\na teacher he was actually jay shetty's\nguru jay shetty's a friend of mine he\ninvented he invited me to an event you\nknow he came up to me after jay did and\nhe's like hey did you meet radha naswami\ni was like no there's so many people\nhere like i don't wanna there's this\nlong line of people he's like all right\nwell you know once everything ends just\nlet me know you can come over and talk\nto him came over and talked to him and\ni've never\nbeen with another person who was more\npresent\nit was like the nothing in the entire\nworld existed except for me when he was\nin this conversation with me and he was\nkind and he was loving and he was sweet\nhe was\nspoke very slow and intentional and it\nwas just like you could tell\nthat this person's done more work on\nhimself than any person i've ever met by\nfar and it wasn't anything that was like\na show that was being put on for me and\nyou could tell like there's nothing that\ni could do that would ever make this guy\njudge me he would just see me as i am as\nthis being that's behind and trying to\nimprove and trying to get better so the\nbeing behind\nthe rob dial right and i said when you\nthink of someone like that whether\nyou've met someone like that or not what\nqualities do they have\nthat you would want in yourself kind\nlove whatever it is that that's in there\nthat can be spirituality for you so it\ncan literally be characteristic traits\nas well in your spirituality of the\nperson that you want to become when you\nlook at yourself spiritually spiritually\nwhat would you rate yourself on a scale\nof one to ten and then what would you\nneed to do so let's say you have\na four what would you need to do to\nraise it from a four to a five you know\nwhat i need to meditate for five minutes\na day i need to notice when i start to\nget angry and i need to start doing some\nbreathing\nsome slow intentional breathing to slow\nmyself down\nwell now what you do is if you look at\nthis piece of paper if you went through\nthis exercise with me\nyou know your score of where you're at\nand you now have a game plan for the\nnext 30 days of how to improve yourself\nin your career how to improve yourself\nin your relationships how to improve\nyourself intellectually how to prove\nyourself physically how to improve\nyourself emotionally and how to prove\nyourself spiritually all you need to do\nevery single day is wake up look at this\npiece of paper if you went through this\npractice with me look at this piece of\npaper and then make sure\nthat you're executing on everything that\nyou said that you need to execute with\nset your intention every single day to\nbecome the person that you want to be so\nthat then you can create the life that\nyou want to it's literally this simple\nthis is something that you should do\nwith yourself every single week to see\nhow you're doing you look back and see\nhow you did you look forward to see how\nyou can improve what you need to\ncontinue doing and it's that simple and\nif you do this simple practice of cripes\ni promise you these six areas of your\nlife if you look at them every single\nday and con and go through and take time\nwith yourself every single week you will\nsee massive improvements in your life\nthere's a phrase that says\nwhat is tracked will improve and what is\ntracked and written down will improve\nexponentially when you track these\nthings and you write them down all areas\nof your life the career the\nrelationships the intellectual the\nphysical the emotional and the spiritual\nif you're tracking them you're being\npotential every single day they will\nimprove exponentially simply because\nyou're tracking yourself and you've got\na game plan of where you're going to go\none thing i would recommend that you do\nif possible get a pen and paper write\nthese down and then when we're done all\nyou have to do is literally answer those\nquestions and start to go through them\nand see if you can start to get some\nreally deep answers for these questions\nso i'm going to ask these questions and\ni'm going to kind of frame them for you\nyou can write them down you can pause me\nif you need to and then force yourself\nto answer them and to not allow yourself\nto be surface level but to allow\nyourself to go deeper than you normally\nwould to find answers that might be\nhidden inside of you that are looking to\nbe uncovered throughout this process\nthe first question that i want you to\nask yourself is this\nwho am i spending time with so there's a\nphrase a quote that says show me who you\nspend time with and i will tell you who\nyou are show me who you spend time with\nand i'll tell you who you are i don't\neven need to know who you are see you or\nanything but if you were to show me the\ntop five people that you spend the most\ntime with the top 10 people who you\nspend the most time with and i were to\nlook at them talk to them\ninterview them all of that stuff i could\nget a pretty good idea of who you are\nwhere you are in your life what you're\ndoing well with what you're struggling\nwith but also what direction you're\nheading in your life as well it's like\nyou've heard me say many times the five\npeople you spend the most time with you\naverage them together you're going to\nbecome those people if you spend time\nwith five alcoholics you're probably\ngoing to be the sixth alcoholic if you\nspend time with five millionaires you're\nprobably going to spend you're probably\ngoing to become the sixth millionaire\nand so that's why if you look at people\nwho are you know if you look at the\npeople you spend the most time with\nthere's a pretty good chance you put\nthem all together you\nthink the same way as them you are\nheaded in the same direction as them\nyour body is probably very similar to\nthem if you hang out with you know if\nyou're overweight and you just start\nhanging out around five people who are\nextremely fit\nyou are going to start to become more\nfit now you might not be as fit of the\npeople who are extremely fit but you\nwill become more fit simply from being\naround them and they are going to hold\nyou to a higher standard you know\nthey're not going to be eating things\nthat you're eating in order to get you\nto where you are and you're going to\nstart changing your habits and when\nyou're around people that are taking\ncare of themselves and you see that\nthey're waking up earlier and you see\nthat they're focused on their business\nor you see that they're focused on their\nmindset or you see that they're focused\non the relationship with their spouse or\nthey're focused on their relationship\nwith their children showing up as the\nbest parent you are going to see what\nthey're doing and you are going to\nbecome like them and so the first\nquestion is who am i spending time with\nis to start thinking about who are the\npeople around me that are\nhelping me become better\nwho are the people that are keeping me\nin the exact same position and who are\nthe people that could possibly be making\nme actually worse and so there's three\ndifferent categories that i just talked\nabout there's the people that are going\nto make you better there's the people\nare going to make you worse and the\npeople that are going to keep you\nexactly the same as you currently are\nwhen you look at these people\nand you start to see who you're spending\ntime with you ask yourself who you're\nspending time with also ask yourself the\nquestion where are these people headed\nin their life like what direction are\nthey headed if you look at the\ntrajectory of their life and what\ndirection they're going into and you're\nsaying okay my good friend john that i\nspend a lot of time with and i look at\nwhere he's going in his life and i fast\nforward in my mind where john could be\nin five years is that where i also want\nto be in five years or am i looking at\nthat going yeah he's not heading in a\ndirection that i want to be\nwell if he's not heading a direction\nthat you want to be maybe it's time to\nnot oh you don't have to get rid of him\nas i always say just spend a little bit\nless time with him and maybe put a new\nperson into your top five i'm not saying\nyou have to get rid of people\nbut just start to be very aware\nof the people that you spend time with\nand where they are helping you head in\nwhat direction you're headed to\nyou know so if you have a\nmassive success you have something\namazing happening happening at work are\nthese people celebrating your success\nare they rooting you on or is there a\npart of you that's like um\ni'm not really sure if they're happy\nabout my success or if they're just\nbeing fake or if they're being if\nthey're if they're indifferent to my\nsuccess a really good friend should be\nsomebody who celebrates your success and\nas happy about your success as you are\nthat's what you're really looking for in\nthese types of people so are they\nheading in the same direction as you or\nare they heading in the direction that\nyou want to be heading that's the first\nquestion who am i spending time with\nquestion number two which is a big\nquestion to ask yourself is is this\nsomething that i have control over and\nso when you look at things that are\npossibly\nstressing you out\nmaking you anxious that you're worrying\nabout maybe a little bit too much ask\nyourself the question is this something\nthat i have control over because so much\nof what we go through in our lives we\ndon't have control over we don't have\ncontrol over the majority of the things\nin our life we don't have the control\nover anybody else we don't have control\nover the weather and if you want to talk\nabout you know control over other people\nand i'll give you a really good example\nof this i was running a zoom earlier\ntoday\nfor about 93 people and these are all\npeople who i'm you know helping them\ngrow their coaching business i'm\nteaching them how to grow a coaching\nbusiness in my business breakthrough\nprogram and i'm teaching them this and\nuh you know there were quite a few\npeople who showed up late not massively\nlate but like one or two minutes late\nlike they were a few minutes late five\nminutes late seven minutes late and i\nstarted exactly on time and i said hey\nwould it be and i didn't preface this in\nany sort of way for them but i said to\nthem you know would it be um\nkind of irresponsible and unacceptable\nif you're expecting me to start this\nlive at 12 eastern and i showed up at\n1207 consistently would you guys see\nthat as unacceptable let me know in the\nchat\nflood it in every single person like yes\nyes yes yes they'll be unacceptable and\nthen i said\nwhy is it unacceptable for me to show up\nlate\nbut many of you showed up a few minutes\nlate and so you have to be willing to\nhold yourself accountable for when\nyou're showing up but you also have to\nrealize that you have no control over\nwhat time other people show up how other\npeople act\nhow they're going to show up whenever\nthey get there when they show up all of\nthat stuff and i always give the example\nif you have kids or you know children\nand you're around a two-year-old the\nlast thing that a two-year-old wants to\ndo is be controlled and so you have to\nrealize it is really hard to control\nother people\nso what is it that you can control those\nare the things that i want you to focus\non stop focusing on what you can't\ncontrol and start focusing on what you\ncan control so things that you can\ncontrol you can control your own mindset\nit might feel like sometimes you can't\ncontrol your own mindset but you are\nfully 100 in control of your mindset\nyou're in control of your attitude\nyou're in control of the way that you\ntalk to yourself you're in control of\nyour energy throughout the day you're in\ncontrol of your actions throughout the\nday you're in control of your happiness\nthose are things that you can control so\nthe important thing is to ask yourself\nis this something that i can control is\nit something i control over and if it is\na no it is something that you should let\ngo of in release and stop worrying about\nbecause if you're stressing over\nsomething that you can't control you're\ngoing to stay stressed forever\nforever\nif you're trying to control that thing\nbecause if you have no control over it\nwhat will make you stress out more than\ntrying to control something that you\ncan't control so don't waste your time\nyour money your energy none of those\nthings on things that you cannot control\nonly focus on what you can control\nbecause those are the things that are\ngoing to move the needle in your life so\nthat's question number two is do i have\ncontrol over this question number three\nwhich is a very important question that\ni would wake up and ask yourself each\nmorning for the next week two weeks and\njust see what comes up what does my\nideal day look like what does my ideal\nday look like i had this practice that\none of my mentors years ago had me go\nthrough it's called the perfect tuesday\nand where he had to sit down and design\nwhat our perfect tuesday would look like\nfrom every single moment from the second\nwe woke up to the second we went to bed\nand the reason why is because tuesdays\nare just normal days they're just days\nit's not like a friday where you're\nexcited for the weekend it's not a\nmonday where you're like gosh the\nweekend i'm still kind of you know\nhungover from the weekend tuesdays are\njust tuesdays they're not even the\nmiddle of the week they don't even get a\nspecial name like wednesday gets hump\nday you know it's not uh you know\nthursday where thursday's friday eve and\nthen friday you have friday so it's like\ntuesday's just a normal day most of the\ntime\nwhat do you want your perfect tuesday\nlook like what do you want your ideal\nday to look like when you wake up what\ntime do you want to wake up where do you\nwant to wake up what do you want your\nmorning routine to look like do you want\nto wake up in the morning what do you\nwant to eat who do you want to spend\nyour time with what do you want to do in\nyour business or in the job that you\nhave or the career that you have or the\nchildren that you spend time with you\nknow what do you want to do in all of\nthe morning plan out your entire morning\nand what you want that to look like and\nthen you start to shift into the noon to\nafternoon time what do you want that to\nlook like what do you want to be eating\ndo you want to be eating with other\npeople who are those people that you\nwant to be eating with like what do you\nwant this ideal day to look like what do\nyou want the afternoon to look like what\ndo you want the evening to look like\ndinner what type of dinner do you want\nto have type of food you want to be\neating who do you want to be eating\ndinner with after dinner what do you\nwant that to look like do you want to be\nspending time with your family with the\ncell phone away with netflix away with\nthe ipads away with all of that do you\nwant to spend time with just your family\ndo you not have a family yet maybe you\nwant to spend your time on your own\npersonal growth or building your\nbusiness\nwhat does your ideal day look like if\nyou don't know what your ideal day looks\nlooks like it's going to be really hard\nto build into that ideal day and so the\nthird question that will help you grow\nis what do i want my ideal date to look\nlike question number four\nis what am i missing out on by choosing\nto worry or be afraid what am i missing\nout on by choosing to worry or be afraid\nnotice i use the word choosing because\nworrying and being afraid is a choice it\nmight not always feel like a choice\nbut if you're worrying you're allowing\nyourself you are choosing to stay in\nthat state you are choosing whether you\nrealize or not to focus on those things\nthat are causing you worry and if you've\nbeen listening long enough you realize\nthe statistics i say it all the time\npsychologists found that about 85\npercent of the stuff that you worry\nabout never even actually happens 85\npercent of what you worry about never\nhappens\nso if you're focusing on those things\nthat means 85\nof the stuff that you spend your energy\nyour mental and physical energy worrying\nabout never actually happens imagine\nwhat could happen if you replaced that\nmental energy that you have been\nchoosing to work and\nwaste\non just\nworrying and being afraid and whatever\nit is that you're focusing on imagine if\nyou took those things that don't happen\nand you were to focus on things that you\ndo have control over that you can do and\nstop wasting your energy and your mental\ncapacity on those things that you have\nno control over so what am i choosing to\nworry about\nor to be afraid of\nthat's question number four\nonce again you can pause me at any time\njust go for it just start asking\nyourself these questions if your brain's\nalready starting to go question number\nfive\nis what is the most important thing in\nmy life\none of the things that i found with a\nlot of people is that they don't have a\nwhole lot of focus as to what the most\nimportant things are so if you can\nidentify what the most important thing\nin your life is you can build a life\naround that so\nfor some of you listening it might be\nyour family it might be your children it\nmight be your uh your brother sister\nyour parents it might be your spouse\nmight be your boyfriend girlfriend what\nis what is the most important thing in\nyour life\nand what do you want to build around\nthat most important thing in your life\nfor some of you it might be family for\nsome of you it might be your happiness\nokay what do i need to do to build a\nlife around that happiness and to create\nmore happiness in my life for some of\nyou guys it might be love like love\nmight be the most important thing for\nyou even if you're just single love\nmight be the most important thing well\ndo i have friends that i can love on\nmore do i can i love on myself more can\ni make loving on myself the most\nimportant thing that i do if i'm single\ni have nobody that i live with i might\nlive in a different city or a different\nstate than my entire family\ncan i focus on loving myself if love is\nthe most important thing\nso you start to build a life focusing\naround what the most important thing is\nto you so that the most important thing\ngrows and gets better because what you\nfocus on you will get more of what you\nappreciate appreciates\nokay it might be your freedom your\nfreedom might feel like the most\nimportant thing to be able to free be\nfree and to travel and to you know build\nyour own business so that you can go\naround the world and do some work from\nbali and go to tulum and do all of those\nthings your freedom might be the most\nimportant thing well how can i focus on\nthe most important number one identify\nwhat the most important thing is and\nthen number two focus on that thing and\nhow it can make that thing much better\nthan it already is this needs to be your\nnorth star in your life and what i mean\nby north star is that if i'm heading\ntowards the north star\nyou're heading in that direction no\nmatter what so if i'm like hey this is\nthe number one thing in my life i'm\nheading towards that direction of this\nnorth star and everything that i do at\nall points in time the the uh\nit might have to move and shift and\nthere might be detours and there might\nbe you know a path might change a little\nbit\nbut the actual direction of where i'm\nheading never changes\nso that becomes your north star what is\nyour north star in your life you have to\nknow what your north star is you have to\nknow what you're standing for because if\nyou don't stand for anything you're\ngoing to fall if you don't stand for\nsomething you're going to fall for\nanything and so you have to know what\nthat most important thing is and then\nnumber six\nanother question to ask yourself often\nis will i remember this in five years\nyou know the majority of the things that\nstress you out right now that have been\nstressing you out today that have\nstressed you out yesterday the day\nbefore that you're not going to remember\nany of this you're really not going to\nand so you ask yourself will i remember\nthis in five years one of my very first\nmentors used to always say this to me he\nused to always say if i won't remember\nit in five years i don't spend more than\nfive minutes thinking about it i don't\nspend more than five minutes worrying\nabout it stressing out whatever it is\nlife\nhey life is up and down it's crazy it's\nall over the place it's beautiful it's\ntragic it's it's a lot of different\nthings and so if it's something that you\nwon't remember in five years don't spend\nmore than five minutes freaking out\nabout it but if you want to if something\nstressful comes up if you get bad news\ngive yourself five minutes if you want\nto you can scream you can throw things\nyou can throw pillows you can break\nthings whatever it is that you want to\ndo you give yourself five minutes to\nfreak the hell out about that thing\nafter that five minutes is up you know\nset a timer on your your phone after\nthat five minutes is up you move on and\nyou go on and you do something different\nwith your life and you stop worrying\nabout the things that don't matter\nand you go alright\nif i'm not gonna remember this\nconversation with this person that said\nthis thing that i didn't enjoy\nin five years i'm not gonna spend more\nthan five minutes on this thing because\nif it's not going to be remembered in\nfive years is it really even worth the\nfive minutes in the first place and so\nthe question is will i remember this in\nthe next five years if you can't\nremember it if it doesn't seem like\nsomething that's going to be you know a\nbig life-changing event that you're\ngoing to remember in five years spending\nmore than five minutes is a waste of\nyour time it's a waste of your energy\nyou don't get time back you don't get\nthe energy back throughout the day so\nfocus on all right i'm gonna give myself\nfive minutes to freak out about this and\nthen what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna\nstart focusing on those things that are\nthe most important to me i have grieved\nthis relationship or this friendship or\nthis person that just said this to me or\nthis you know fire that i have to put\nout at work i'm gonna deal with it i'm\ngonna freak out for five minutes and\nthen i'm going to get moving i'm not\ngoing to spend the next\nday two days week five weeks freaking\nout about this thing there are some\npeople\ntoday right now possibly even listening\nto this episode that are still pissed\noff about something that happened to\nthem 10 years ago what a waste\nyou have a very precious life that you\nhave in a very limited amount of time\nand mental energy stop wasting it on\nthings that do not matter and if you\nwon't remember it in five years it does\nnot matter that much i'm going to talk\nto you about a secret to success and\nit is extremely simple but it is also\nfor most people very difficult to do\nit's not really hard to do we just make\nit way more difficult than it needs to\nbe\nbut even though it's super simple it is\nextremely extremely important for the\nsuccess that you're trying to build for\nyourself for your family for the world\nthe impact that you want to do and i'm\ngoing to teach you a little bit of how\njerry seinfeld the comedian actually\nused this technique to be one of the\ngreatest comedians in the wealthiest\ncomedian that has ever lived by using\nthis thing called the law of 100. so i\ncalled the law of 100. i don't know if\nthere's another name for it i just made\nit up as a law of 100.\nand it's very simple\nthe first thing you need to do is you\nneed to decide what it is that you need\nto do so what i mean by that if you're\nlike oh i want to lose weight okay well\ndecide the one most important thing that\nyou need to do to lose weight\nmaybe it's work out\nmaybe it is\neat healthier maybe it is stop drinking\nalcohol maybe it is stop drinking soda\nstop your intake of sugar find out the\nyou know figure out what it is that you\nwant to do\nand then figure out what the very most\nimportant thing that you need to do in\norder to get there don't figure out the\nthree four five things and try to be an\noverachiever figure out the one thing\none thing and one thing only that you\nneed to do to get yourself there so\nthat's step number one\nyou know in the the way that i think\nabout it is this it could be an action\nin your business it could be an action\nin your relationships it could be an\naction that you need to take in your\nweight loss in your gaining muscle it\ncould be one action that you need that's\nall it is it's just one action that you\nneed to do and you're going to do that\nthing for 100 days in a row\nso it's very simple it's two steps so\ni'm gonna break it down through we're\ngonna go much more in depth why this\nworks how to make it easier but it's\nliterally two steps okay number one\ndecide what that action is\nthat's it what is that action so think\nabout it right now what is it that you\nwant to achieve in your life and what is\none action that you can do to help you\nget there if you are saying hey you know\nwhat\ni want to make a hundred thousand\ndollars this year and in order to do\nthat i know i need to make 100 phone\ncalls a day\nthat's just what i need to do looking at\nmy numbers looking at my closing ratio\nlooking at the amount of people who pick\nup when i call all of that all i need to\ndo is make 100 phone calls every single\nday so that is the action that's going\nto get us closest to the desired result\nthat we want so step number one is to\ndecide what that action is and step\nnumber two is to do it every\nsingle\nday\nfor 100 days so you might be out there\nand saying oh my gosh but\ni don't know if i want to lose weight\nand i need to go to the gym is it okay\nfor me to work out a hundred days in a\nrow yes it's okay for you to work out\n100 days in a row\nchange what your workout is do cardio\none day do weight lifting one day do uh\nyoga one day whatever it is you need you\ncan do hot yoga whatever you need to do\ndo some form of working out for 100 days\nstraight so step number one decide what\nthe action is step number two do it\nevery single day for 100 days the reason\nwhy is because when you decide i'm going\nto do this 100 days\nyou take out all of the room\nthat you allow yourself to give you the\nbs excuses as to why you can't do it or\nyourself let me believe all of those\nthings the excuse and self-limiting\nbeliefs are still going to come up but\nwhen you have made a commitment and your\nword is worth everything so if you make\na commitment and you don't follow\nthrough on it that is your fault that is\nyour giving up on something so when you\ndecide it allows you to get past the\nself-limiting beliefs it allows you to\nget past the the excuses the\nself-sabotage you just decide i don't\ngive a damn what happens to me if i get\nhit by a truck\ni'm going to do this thing every single\nday for the next 100 days and let me\ntell you a few reasons why this is\nimportant for you first thing is that\nsuccessful people whatever success means\nto you the thing that i've come to\nrealize about success is it's not really\nthat hard we make it much more more\nharder than it needs to be\nmuch harder than it needs to be\nsuccessful people are just consistent\nthat's it they're just consistent and we\ncould take success in any way if you\ncould look at somebody who's wealthy if\nthat's what success means to you\nthey worked really hard consistently and\nthey just didn't give up\nsimple did they have struggles and\nchallenges coming up along the way\nabsolutely but they worked really hard\nconsistently\nand they became wealthy now you might\nlook at somebody and say okay well my\ndefinition of success is somebody who is\nextremely calm and centered and is an\namazing person right that might be your\ndefinition of success okay well there's\na pretty good chance that that person\nhas meditated every single day or\ndevelops something that they need to and\ndone it every single day so therefore\nthey can be more calm they can be more\ncentered so if if success to you is joy\nand peace and happiness and all that\nstuff you can 100 create those things\nbut you have to realize that you need to\nbe consistent with whatever that is you\nmight say\nwell success to me right now and what\ni'm trying to work on for this year in\nthe upcoming year and whatever it is the\nnext six months is being in incredible\nshape okay well they quote unquote\nsuccessful person and and someone that's\nin incredible shape they worked out they\nstayed consistent with their workout\nplan they stayed consistent with their\ntheir dieting they stayed consistent\nwith their water intake they stayed\nconsistent with not having so much sugar\nhaving\nless alcohol they stayed consistent the\nnumber one thing that i see among\nsuccessful people they're not the\nsmartest people in the world they don't\ncome from money all of the time\nin fact just in case you guys want to\nknow in the united states out of all of\nthe millionaires that exist in the\nunited states only 20 percent of them\ncome for money which means 80 of them\ndon't come from anything and so you\ncan't say oh yeah but they came for\nmoney and i didn't have any money and my\nfamily was broke you have to realize\nit's just about being consistent it's\nshowing up and it's working towards the\nthing that you need to get it's just the\nconsistent daily action success comes\nfrom consistency\nlet me say that again let me get it into\nyour brain success comes from consistent\nlet's see whatever that success is even\nif you want to be an incredible parent\nokay well i want you to spend an hour a\nday undivided attention with your\nchildren every single night put your\nphone away turn the tv off that's gonna\nmake you a better parent\nmaybe that's what success means to you\nso you have to figure out what the\nsuccess is that you want you have to\nfigure out the number one actually needs\nto be taken and you need to do it every\nsingle day this is it step number one\ndecide what the action is step number\ntwo do it every single day for a hundred\ndays success comes from consistency you\ndon't fail until you give up that's it\nfailure comes from giving up and so\nyou've got to think about that but let\nme explain to you why this is important\nas your brain just in your brains or so\nyou have an idea imagine your brain is\nlike a forest right and i'll explain to\nyou what this means eventually what\nhappens over time i'm 35 years old i\nhave 35 years of habits and things that\ni've done over the years i have neural\npathways in my brain that are strong\nthat i've done over and over and over\nand over again those habits i've done\nover and over again\na habit is just something that my brain\nhas turned on to autopilot so that it\nmakes it easier for me to consistently\ndo over and over and over again\nso we have habits that are good we also\nhave habits that are bad and we don't we\nwant to get rid of those habits and so\nwhen you think about that you start to\nask yourself the question\nokay\nif i don't have the habit that i want to\nto create the life that i want i need to\ncreate that habit of working out every\nsingle day of spending an hour with my\nchildren every single day of meditating\nevery single day whatever it is that\naction is for you and it usually takes\nanywhere between 21 to 100 days to\nrewire a habit or to wire a habit into\nyour brain and so if you think of your\nbrain as a big giant forest\nyour habits are kind of like the pathway\nthat has been carved in the forest by\ngoing down it over and over and over\nagain you know when you walk a pathway\nevery single day every single day every\nsingle day every single day it starts to\nget rid of all the plants and the weeds\nand everything around it because you've\nbeen stepping in that that's what a\nhabit is in your brain in the forest\ncreating a new habit and doing this\nevery single day for 100 days is\nliterally the idea of walking into the\nforest with a machete and then just\nhacking a brand new pathway tacking a\nbrand new place inside of this inside of\nyour brain so whether that's the working\nout habit whether that's spending time\nwith your children habit whether it's\nthe meditation habit whatever it is\nyou're literally taking machete and\nhacking that new thing into your brain\nthat's what we're trying to do here\nthat's how we turn it into a habit now\nhow did seinfeld use this well seinfeld\nis actually famous for doing something\nthat they've now coined the seinfeld\ncalendar and what he would do is what he\nrealized when he was a new comedian he\nneeded to work at his craft every single\nday and so he made himself write jokes\nevery single day like there was not rain\nor shine nothing out of his way he wrote\njokes every single day and he had a\ncalendar that was up on the wall it was\none of the calendars and every single\nday was on it\nand he had a red pen that was attached\nto that calendar and he would you know\nwas just dangling from it and when he\nwould finish his jokes that he had\nwritten for the day he would walk up to\nthat calendar and he would put a big red\nx on the day which means that he\ncompleted his task for the day and so\nhow can you use this to your advantage\nthe thing that he said is that once he\nstarted and he he could consistently see\na bunch of red x's\nhe didn't want to break the cycle he\nliterally drove him to go up and do more\njokes and more jokes because he was able\nto see all of the red x's and he's like\nwell i don't want to i don't want today\nto be the day that i break it and so he\ncontinued to keep it going and so one\nthing you could do is you could say hey\ni want to do this for 100 days straight\nlet me mark off my calendar here's day\none okay today here's 100 days from\ntoday and my my goal my commitment is\nthat i'm going to put a red x every\nsingle day for doing this thing\nthat i'm going to be doing for the next\nhundred days that's it\nhe ended up doing this and he did it for\nthousands of days it was like years and\nyears and years that he went writing\njokes writing jokes and writing jokes so\nwhen you look at him you're like\nwell he's one of the most successful\ncomedians ever he's also the wealthiest\ncomedian ever maybe it's because the\nfact that he was so freaking consistent\nwhen he was trying to master his craft\nthat he became better than everyone else\nbecause of the fact that he was so so\nconsistent success is not hard success\nis so simple we just make it hard it's\njust wake up and do the right things\nevery single day wake up do the right\nthings every single day and do it\nconsistently and then just don't give up\nand eventually you're going to succeed\nin whatever it is that you want like i\nsaid the most successful people that i\nknow they're not\nthe smartest people they don't know\neverything in the world they're not the\nthe most well-read people\nthey're just really damn consistent at\ndoing the right things\nevery single day and so it comes down to\nyour hard work and your dedication more\nthan anything else you know if you were\nto look at it\nand you were to say all right i'm gonna\ndo this for a hundred days imagine what\nwould happen if you did this for the\nnext year imagine what would happen if\nyou do it for a hundred days and then\ndoing it for 100 days motivates you keep\ngoing and you go for an entire year\nimagine where you could be a year from\ntoday if you took that action every day\nfor the next 365 days your life could be\ncompletely different now what if you\nfast forwarded three years\nwhere could your life be if you said you\nknow what success in my business is the\nthing that i'm working at more than\nanything else i'm gonna put 100 days\ninto working hard in my business doing\nxyz because that's what's gonna get my\nbusiness the furthest and then you did\nthat every single day for 100 days and\nthen a year and then three years imagine\nwhere your life could be if you fast\nforwarded\nthree years from today\nknowing that you did that thing every\nsingle day like if i told you\nthink about this for instance i told you\nhey you know what if you do something\nevery single day for the next three\nyears\ni'm gonna pay you five million dollars\nguaranteed absolutely would you go for\nit if you are 100 guaranteed to succeed\ni'm like hey just do it every single day\nfor three years and i'll give you five\nmillion dollars in cash would you do it\nis the answer yes or no answer it out\nloud to yourself\nit's probably yes right i'll give you\nfive million dollars to do this thing\nevery single day for the next three\nyears you're guaranteed success now you\nhave to think about this i can't\nguarantee that whatever that thing is\nthat you want you're gonna have in three\nyears but i can guarantee you if you\ndon't stop you will eventually get that\nthing that you want so if acquiring five\nmillion dollars was the thing that you\nwanted i can't guarantee you that if you\ntake the right action you're gonna get\nit literally in three years but if\nyou're taking the right action to make\nthat money you will eventually make the\nfive million dollars it could be less\nthan three years it could be more than\nthan three years\nbut success is pretty much guaranteed\nwhen you take the right action\nsuccess is pretty much guaranteed when\nyou take the right action if you're not\ntaking the right action it's gonna be a\nlot harder you know and just don't stop\nwhat\nwhere could you be in your life if you\ndidn't give up years ago on that thing\nthat was really important to you how\nmany of you listening right now have\ngiven up on something that was really\nimportant to you four years ago\nyou know that side business that you\nwanted and it wasn't bringing in as much\nmoney as you wanted to so you shut it\ndown where could you be if you just\nnever shut it down\nhow different could your life be if you\ndid not shut that business down four\nyears ago and you have continued to to\nstruggle and mess things up and figure\nit out and get a little bit better and\nstruggle and mess things up and figure\nit out and get a little bit better\nwhere could you be now if you didn't\ngive up four years ago if you didn't\ngive up seven years ago if you didn't\ngive up 17 years ago where could your\nlife be right now a completely different\nplace\ni don't say that because i want to bring\nyou down i say it because i want to put\nyour life into perspective\nyou now know that if you hadn't given up\nyour life would be in a completely\ndifferent place well now let's take the\nknowledge that we have from the past\nlet's bring it into our present and then\nuse it for our future why don't i decide\nwhat it is that i want and then just\ndecide that i'm not going to give up i'm\ngoing to go for 100 days and then\nhopefully at the end of those hundred\ndays i'm motivated to keep going and i'm\ngoing to create a new habit in my brain\nthink about where your life could be it\ncould be a completely different place\nthan it currently is sometimes we have a\nlittle bit of a struggle\nbuilding a business whatever it is we're\ntrying to do and we're like you know\nwhat\nmaybe this isn't for me maybe it's just\nthe universe saying hey rob this isn't\nthe right thing try something else when\nin reality that's just our ego that's\njust that little voice inside of our\nhead that little inside of our\nheads saying oh give up man stay where\nyou are hey give up stay where you are\nhey you you know no you don't need to\nyou don't need to go and be a success\nyou're probably not good enough or smart\nenough for any of those things and what\nhappens is we talk ourselves out of the\nthing that's going to be the most\nfulfilling for us imagine if you didn't\ngive up where you would be\nnow\nimagine where you could be if you\nstarted today imagine where you could be\nif you started today and he said i'm\njust going to give up how many times\nhave you given up on yourself in your\nlife 1 2 5 10 20 times maybe\nwhat if you just decided\ni'm going to go full force of this thing\nfor the next three years and if it\ndoesn't work after three years then i\ncan give it up but i have no other\noptions there is no reason to have a\nplan b because the distraction plan as\nwill smith says but i'm going to succeed\nat this thing no matter what i'm going\nto give myself three years not\nnot 45 days not two months of running a\nbusiness not six months of running\nbusiness i'm gonna go for the next three\nyears i'm dedicated my life to three\nyears in building this business where\ncould your life be in three years if you\nhad that sort of mindset if you didn't\ngive yourself a back door a way to get\nout\nyou said you know\nif you said the the one of my favorite\nlines from the great philosopher of a\nguy named marshall mathers eminem\nsuccess is my only mother option failure\nis not what if you had that thought in\nyour head that success is your only\noption for this\nfailure's not\nbecause you only fail when you give up\nso if you just don't give up you'll\neventually figure it out you'll acquire\nthe skills the knowledge the tool belt\nto do what needs to be done to succeed\nor whatever it is so what if you had\nthat mindset\nthe way that you start it is by\ndedicating the next 100 days the law of\n100 i'm going to stick to this thing i\nknow what my desired outcome is\nstep number one figure out the action is\nstep number two\ndon't give up just go for the next 100\ndays if you want to start a brand new\nlife figure out that action is decide\ntoday\nthat this is the first day of the rest\nof your life and do not stop for the\nnext 100 days if it makes you feel\nbetter and it makes you more excited get\na calendar put a red x on it and make\nsure that you stay consistent for the\nnext 100 days see how much different\nyour life is 100 days from today and\nthen see how much different your life is\na year from today and your life will not\nbe the same it will be measurably\ndifferent\nthree years from today than it is right\nnow just don't give up on yourself\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well there\nare some people\ntoday right now possibly even listening\nto this episode that are still pissed\noff about something that happened to\nthem 10 years ago what a waste\n[Music]"
