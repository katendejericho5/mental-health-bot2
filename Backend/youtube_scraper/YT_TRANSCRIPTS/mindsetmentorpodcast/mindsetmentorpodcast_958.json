to actually take that\naction everything around you is your\ndecision stop acting like you don't have\npower or control over your life\nhave you been living your life as if you\nhappen to get another shot\nhave you been living your life as if\nmaybe you know if you think to baseball\nlike you're not on you're not at the\nbatter's box yet you're kind of on deck\nand maybe you know i'll get another\nchance i'll get another chance i'll get\nanother chance do you live your life as\nif you just happen to get another chance\nor do you live your life as if this is\nthe only thing that i know is that i\nhave it and i'm going to take full\nadvantage of it\ndo you follow your dreams or do you\nwatch netflix\ndo you work for the business that you\nwant to create or do you scroll on\ninstagram do you live your life as if\nthis is the only one that you have\nor do you live your life is just maybe\nyeah i'll get another chance someday\nknowing we all know that you don't get\nanother chance this is the one that you\nhave\nyou know there's so many people live as\nif tomorrow is just guaranteed one\nthings i've been\npulling in as a practice to myself i did\nit this morning is i take about two\nminutes while i'm still laying in bed\nand i look up at the ceiling and i look\nthere and i'm like thank you thank you\nthank you i finally i get another day i\nget another day and for i mean 34 years\nof my life i never did this i'm like i\ncan't believe i get another day how\namazing is it because there's so many\ntimes that i've woken up in my life and\ni'm like\ni have so much stuff to do today i've\ngot so much i gotta do i've gotta go i\ndon't even i wanna go meditate but i\nmight not even have time to meditate\nlike i gotta go chug some coffee because\ni gotta call i gotta hop on then i gotta\nwork out i'm gonna do this this this\nversus just sitting there for a second\nbeing like oh my god i woke up today how\nfreaking amazing is that do you live\nyour life as if you happen to get\nanother one or do you live your life as\nif you know this is it this is all that\nyou got because so many people live\nas if tomorrow is just guaranteed and\nyou know if you've heard me stay the\nstatistics before 150 000 people did not\nwake up today that woke up yesterday 150\n000 people died\nyesterday\nyou did it you're listening to this are\nyou living today as if today is the very\nlast day of your life i remember i was\nlistening to a um\na great talk between um\nneil degrasse tyson and larry king i\nthink larry king just died if i'm not\nmistaken but um if he didn't holy crap\nthat guy's still alive but i don't know\nif he's alive or not probably google it\nbut uh neil degrasse tyson he was being\ninterviewed by larry king it was a few\nyears ago and larry king said\nthey were talking about life and life\nafter death and other planets and aliens\nand all kinds of stuff larry king said\nif you could live forever would you\nand neil degrasse tyson said no\nand then he asked larry king if he would\nand he said absolutely and neil degrasse\ntyson said\nthe reason why i wouldn't want to live\nforever is because if i live forever\nthen it gives me no urgency to do\nanything like death the um the death\nthat we're going to have\nbrings immediate\nuh urgency to my life and i think most\npeople don't live like that they don't\nlive and they don't think about how\ntheir death is coming to them like\nthey're it's every breath we get closer\ni'm not trying to be doom and gloom but\ni'm trying to be honest like when you\nthink to yourself it's going to happen\none day it makes me personally be like i\nneed to start working harder to do what\nit is i want to do make the impact in\nthe world to to change it in some sort\nof way to change myself to make the\npeople around me better\nyou might not wake up tomorrow and if\nyou didn't wake up tomorrow and you're\noff and wherever people go after they\ndie will you look and be like damn\nthere's so much more that i wanted to do\nthat i could have done but i just acted\nlike i didn't get another act like i was\ngoing to be here forever have you been\nliving your life as if you're just going\nto be here forever\nand you're just i'm just that immortal\nperson that stays here forever i can do\nwhatever the hell i want you know i'm\ngonna waste it on netflix i'm gonna\nwaste my instagram scrolling i'm gonna\nwaste it on doing things you know\nworrying about things that don't matter\nwhen 85 percent of the time none of\nthose things actually happen in the\nfirst place if you knew that today was\nyour last day\nwhat would you have missed out on in\nyour life\nif you knew today was the very last day\nof your life what would you have missed\nout on of the past\n20 30 40 50 60 70 years of your life\nwhat would you know that you missed out\non because you were acting like you\nmight get another shot you were not\nputting urgency to taking action your\nlife\nwhat chances\ndidn't you take\nwhat things didn't you do on your bucket\nlist that you wanted to do but you were\ntelling yourself i'll get to it someday\ndown the road i'll try it later on i'll\nfigure it out sometime it's like the\nstory of a guy who he uh\nhe was going to retire he had saved all\nof this money for him and his wife to go\nand travel because her dream was to\ntravel so he was like you know what i'm\ngoing to get to retirement age and then\nwhat i'm going to do is then we're going\nto be able to go travel\nand so he works works works works works\ngets to this retirement agent and and\nhis wife's like all right well now you\ncan retire we can go out and do the\ntraveling we plan for he's like let me\nget just one more year i'll get one more\nyear so i feel that i'm fully\nresponsible like financially good to go\nresponsible we're locked in for life let\nme get one more year and then i swear to\nyou\n365 days from today\nwe're gonna go traveling and i'm gonna\nbe done\nand she's like okay you can do that and\nin those 365 days she died\nand he didn't get to travel with his\nwife the way they want to and now he's\nstuck there by himself having all of\nthese dreams and all this place he want\nto go to with his wife and now he's just\ngot his money but he doesn't have his\nwife and he doesn't have anyone to\ntravel with so are you living your life\nlike that as if you're just guaranteed\ntomorrow as if you're just guaranteed\nnext year what chances didn't you take\nwhat places if you died today what\nplaces did you not travel to that you've\nbeen wanting to travel to but you've\njust been pushing it off because there's\na couple other things a little bit more\nimportant at this part at this point in\nyour life what\nwere you not able to give your loved\nones what were you not able to give your\nchildren if you died today and you look\nback in the rest of your life what were\nyou not able to give your spouse with\nyour family what were you not able to\ngive them that you wanted to give them\nbut you were telling yourself\nit just wasn't the time yet and\ni want to be honest with you and i want\nyou to think about these things because\ni want to kind of shake you up sometimes\nlike i want to shake you up make you\nstart thinking about your life it's like\nwhen someone that you know dies\nand you go to their funeral you start\nthinking about your life a whole lot\nmore don't you\nyou start thinking about man\ni never thought they were going to die\nthey missed out on so many things how\nmany things have i missed out what if i\ndied\nand sometimes people make changes after\nsomeone's funeral\nsometimes they feel like they're gonna\nchange and then a couple weeks down the\nroad life just kind of goes back to\nnormal and they forget all about it but\nif i were to ask you on a scale of one\nto ten\none being like absolutely terrible ten\nbeing like the best possible life that\nanyone has ever lived in the history of\nmankind what would you rate your life as\nof right now and how much you've gotten\nout of your life up until this moment\nanswer the question what is it on scale\nof 1-10\nwhat would you rate your life as far as\nwhat you've done how much you've gotten\nout of it how much how many dreams\nyou've followed how many places you've\ntraveled how many bucket list items\nyou've knocked off\nwhat would you rate it on a scale of one\nto ten\nthink about that for a second\nhave you taken all the risks have you\ndone all of the things have you traveled\nall the places or\nhave you lived your life in fear have\nyou worried too much have you wasted too\nmuch time doing things that didn't\nmatter have you worried too much about\nwhat others would think about you and so\nyou've held yourself back because of\nthat you haven't followed your dreams\nwhich one is it\nand now looking forward\nwhich one would you like it to be you\nknow if you rate yourself as a six in\nyour life right now\nwhat's the difference between a six and\na eight\nand what would add an extra two points\nto that number over the next year to get\nyou two and eight what shifts and\nchanges and moves would you have to do\nin your life in order to get you to go\nfrom i think i'm a six out of a ten my\nlife to an eight out of ten in my life\none of the things that i love and i've\nheard this a couple times in a couple\ndifferent ways from a couple different\npeople\nis is if you imagine god has a checklist\nfor you right and he's just checking off\nall the things and it's like rob dial\nhe's gonna do this he's gonna do this\nhe's gonna do this he's gonna do this\nand it's all of the things that you\ncould possibly do and all the things you\ncould possibly be\nand you know some of them are checking\noff and some of them aren't everything\nthat you could do everything you could\nsee everything that you could achieve\nall of the lives that you could impact\nall the chances that you could take the\nfull on hell yes accomplish everything\nrob dial life is what it'd be for me and\nwhatever would be for you my goal is to\nget to the end of my life and to have\ngod have this checklist\nand go damn\nyou literally checked off all of them in\nsome of them that i didn't even have on\nhere\nlike you did even better than i thought\nyou were going to do that's what my goal\nis to do another example of the way i've\nheard it explained is\nis imagine\nthat your\nperfect self your most\nenlightened badass\naccomplished everything did everything\nimpacted the lives made the money had\nthe success had the love had the joy\nbuilt the best family built the best\nbusinesses change the world as much as\npossible most enlightened version of\nyourself is waiting for you in heaven\nand you die\nmy goal is to get to the end to see that\nversion of me\nand we're twins\nnot to see that version be like oh\ni could have done that\ni could have done that thing oh my god i\ndidn't i could have done that i don't\nwant to get to the end of my life and\nfeel like that's the way i want to feel\ni want to get to end of my life and see\nthe most enlightened the best did as\nmuch as they possibly could change the\nworld as much as they possibly could\nloved as much they possibly could built\nthe family they possibly could and i\nlook at myself and i'm like\ni'm looking in a mirror\nwhat would that look like think of those\ntwo things what would the checklist look\nlike that god would have and what would\nyour twin look like that if you got to\nthe end of your life that you became you\nwere the twins with that person which is\nyour best highest most enlightened self\nwhat would that look like for you\nyou know what i would recommend is take\na pen and paper on literally just spend\nthe next 15 minutes put me on pause\njournal through this if you pause me\ni'll be here forever waiting for you\ni'll literally be here forever until you\ndecide to push play again pause me and\nwrite down all of the things that you\nwant to do that you should do that you\nknow you have the opportunity to do but\nyou just haven't been doing and you want\nto do\nso think about that for a second\nyou have to think about this and think\nokay\nif i rate myself at a level 6 out of 10\nright now\nwhat would i need to do over the next\n365 days to bring that number up to that\neight that we're speaking about earlier\nwhat i need to do okay you know what i\nneed to do this job that i have it's\nit's so sucking it's not fulfilling in\nany sort of way and i know i've been\nwanting to do xyz\ni'm going to start making a plan and\nstart making movement into doing\nwhatever that thing is it might take a\nyear to transition out of my job so i\ncan pay my bills it might take two years\nbut at least i'm starting to make\nmovement\ninto the direction of what it feels like\ni'm actually truly supposed to do and if\nyou\ndon't know what it is you're supposed to\ndo you don't know what your true purpose\nand path in life is i always say this to\nto kind of give you the idea it's okay\nright now\nnot to know what your purpose is\nbut it's not okay to not wake up every\nsingle day and constantly be in the\npursuit of trying to find what that\npurpose is so if you don't know what\nyour purpose is right now no big deal\nmaybe you do maybe you don't but if\nyou're one of the people who doesn't\nknow what your purpose is then it is a\ncrime for you to wake up every single\nday and not be in constant freaking\npursuit to find out why the you're alive\nif you just wake up and do the same\nthing that you did yesterday and the day\nbefore that and the day before that it's\nan absolute crime if you don't know what\nyour purpose is that's okay but it is a\nabsolute crime if you wake up every\nsingle day and you're not in constant\npursuit to find what that thing is\nif we're planning out 365 days from\ntoday\nmake a checklist of all the things that\nyou need to do\nin order to move your\nlife from a six out of ten to an eight\nout of ten what do you want your body to\nlook like\nyou know what if your body's a six out\nof ten what would an eight out of ten\nlook like what do you need to do to get\nthere\nwhat does your family look like at an\neight out of ten what do you use your\nrelationship with your children look\nlike at an eight out of ten what's your\nrelationship with your spouse look like\nat an eight of ten what is a\nrelationship with your parents with your\nbrother sister cousins best friends what\ndoes that look like to become an eight\nout of ten what does your bank account\nlook like to go from a six to an eight\nout of ten what does your mindset look\nlike to go from a six to an eight out of\nten and what are all of the things that\nyou need to do and you need to\naccomplish and you need to be laser like\nfocused on over the next 365 days to\nbring yourself from a six to a ten\nbecause here's the thing that we all\nknow if we put work in we know we'll\nchange think of where you could be 365\ndays from today if you just started\ntoday what do you need to do to get\nthere how much work do you need to put\nin what things you need to check off\ndon't worry about the rest of your life\nbecause you're gonna die one day if it's\nfreaking happening so am i it's\nhappening right\ndon't worry about the rest of your life\njust worry don't worry about the next\n365 days plan for the next 365 days but\njust worry on today\nthink about today if i want to get to an\n8 out of 10 in my body what do i need to\ndo today to get myself from a six to a\nten or six two and eight\nin the next year what do i need to do\ntoday what's the first step that i need\nto take to get myself from a six to an\neight from six to an eight to move up a\ncouple different steps what does that\nlook like\nwhat does my mindset look like what does\nmy body look like what does my bank\naccount look like what does my business\nlook like what does my family look like\nwhat does my\nevery single relationship of my life\nlook like what does every single thing\nlook like if\nrob from six out of eight decided to\nshow up as rob or six out of ten decide\nto show up as rob of eight out of ten\nwhat is the difference in the delta\nbetween the six and the eight what is\nthe difference in my actions what is the\ndifference in my focus what is the\ndifference in every single thing every\nsingle thing that i do\nthink be what does that look like and\nhow do i need to make sure that i focus\non that today i don't care about the\nrest of your life i don't care about the\nnext 365 days i care about today and\nwhat you do today to shift yourself over\nthe next year to shift yourself over the\nnext five years over the next 10 years\nhopefully over the next 50 years but the\nonly thing that matters is just today\nnothing else matters because we don't\neven know if we're gonna get tomorrow\nbut what really matters is today how can\ni make sure that i get every single bit\nof everything\nout of today\nand that's all i gotta focus on and when\ni wake up tomorrow how can i get every\nsingle bit of happiness love joy peace\nsuccess everything out of tomorrow and\nthat's all that matters and if you do\nthis every single day every single day\nit'll stack and stack and stack and\nstack and stack on top of itself and\nthen you do wake up 365\ndays from today and you're like holy\nlife is completely different than it was\na year ago but only because the only\nthing that i focused on was every single\nday every single day because damn it i\nwoke up i'm grateful for that i woke up\nand i'm not going to give a kick in the\nface to god or the universe because i\ndecided to sit around and waste that\nwhat about you\nwhat is it 8 out of 10 look like what\ndoes a 9 out of 10 look like what does a\n10 out of 10 look like\nbecause you don't get another chance\nthis is the only one that you got stop\nliving your life as if you get another\nchance stop living your life as if\nyou're in the on deck circle because\nyou're in the batter's box\nthat is how you should be living your\nlife i'll say this before we dive in\nwe're all busy i mean if you're\nlistening to me right now have you ever\nused the phrase i'm too busy i'm so busy\nright now have you said that in the last\nweek you said in last month oh i'm just\nso busy i've said it a bunch of times\nand we all have things going on you know\nthere's work there's kids there's bills\nthere's cleaning the house there's doing\nchores there's laundry you've got to mow\nthe lawn you've got to do your clothes\nyou got to iron you got to put them back\non them put them away in the dresser\nyou've got to hang them up you've got to\nwe have so many as humans we do so many\nthings we got to eat we gotta go to the\nbathroom we gotta drink water we've\ngotta put stuff inside the refrigerator\nlike we've got so many things so many\ndifferent actions that we do as humans\nand with that\nwe all have so many excuses that we\ncould give as to why we are so busy and\nwe have too many things going on to\ncreate the life that we want to we have\nall of the excuses\nbut you have to think about this\nwe do a lot of things but the question\nis do we do the right things do we do\nthe things are we currently doing things\nin our life that are moving the needle\ntowards the life that we want to create\nthink about that for a second are you\ntaking action\nor are you taking action towards the\ndesired outcome that you want in your\nlife are you doing the needle moving\nactivities to change your life because\nif you're not your life is going to be\nexactly the same\n365 days from today as it is right now\nunless you're doing needle moving\nactivities you could still keep doing\nthe laundry and i'm not saying don't do\nthe laundry and you can start keep doing\nall the things that you need to and get\nthose things done but it's not needle\nmoving activities there'll always be\nthings that you have to do\nyou have to sleep you know you have to\nbrush your teeth you have to do those\nthings you have to do them but\nare you prioritizing\nthe things that you need to get done\nover everything else let me examine what\ni mean because\nall of us are different and we all have\ndifferent things that we need to do and\nthat's what we're going to dive into\ntoday is this conversation came up in a\ncoaching group that i run um i teach\ncoaches how to grow coaching businesses\ni teach literally coaches how to grow\nonline coaching businesses it's called\nbusiness breakthrough and somebody asked\na question\na couple weeks ago and we were talking\nabout this where she was saying as i'm\ntrying to build my business i'm running\nout of time like i'm trying to do this\ni'm trying to run run i'm trying to\nbuild but i'm running out of time and i\nhad another friend that was saying hey\ni'm trying to lose weight\nand i'm just trying to get in the shape\nthat i want to but i just don't have\nenough time once i get done with work\nand i heard this a couple times and i\nwas like huh this is an interesting\nthing that people say i should probably\ntalk about this\nso i was in this conversation with my\nfriend who's trying to lose weight\nand they were saying i don't have time i\ntry to get as much i try to work out as\nmuch as possible but i just run out of\ntime so many days and i was like that's\ninteresting and i said i said to her i\nsaid um\njust just kind of curious um\nyou know you have children you know\nthey're seven and five\num how many days have you run out of\ntime and and not fed them and she's like\nwhat i was like how many how many times\nyou know let's take your seven year old\nfor instance over the course of the\nseven years that he's been alive what is\nthat uh\njust two twenty twenty three hundred\ndays something around there twenty two\nhundred twenty three hundred days how\nmany days have you been so busy that you\nyou're like i ran out of time i didn't i\ndidn't feed my son\nshe's like um\nnone\ni was like really\nthat's interesting there was never one\nday where you're like i'm too busy i\ncan't feed my son and she's like no\nthat'd be ridiculous and i was like oh\nso what you're telling me\nis that\nfeeding your son is a priority for you\nshe's like absolutely i said you will\nonly succeed at losing weight when you\nput losing weight and working out and\neating healthy as a priority for you i'm\nnot saying that that going to the gym is\nas important as feeding your son but\nwhat i'm saying is in your brain it\nneeds to be as important you would never\ngo to sleep with your son not being fed\nyou should never go to sleep without the\nworkout if that's what you said you were\ngoing to do you don't run out of time\nyou just don't plan your time\nefficiently to make sure that the action\nis taken to create the body that you\nwant to create the life that you want to\ncreate the business that you want so the\nproblem is it's not that you don't have\ntime for the action is that you're\nmaking up excuses as to why you're too\nbusy to actually take that action\nshe was like oh\nthat makes so much sense\nworking out hasn't been a priority for\nme and i was like i know there are some\npeople that working out is a priority\nand they do have two kids exactly like\nyou do what's the difference their\nmindset around the priorities i'm not\nsaying don't feed your kids that's the\nexact opposite of what i'm saying\ni'm not saying don't do the laundry i'm\nnot saying don't clean the house i'm not\nsaying don't run your business i'm not\nsaying any of those things what i'm\nsaying is is that the most important\nactions the needle-moving actions in\nyour life need to be as much of a\npriority as feeding your children feed\nyour children of course but also get\nyour ass to the gym feed your children\nof course if you don't have children you\nhave a dog you have a cat you have a\nbird feed your animal or feed your child\nwhatever you might have\nand go to the gym\nbuild your business and feed your child\ndo all of those things don't go to bed\nuntil the action is done same way that\nyou never go to bed and not feed your\nchildren is exactly the same way that\nyou should never go to bed and not have\nthat action done and so i asked her that\nquestion\nand the reason why it was it's a it's\nsuper super important to think this is\nbecause the reason why you need to have\nthis reprioritization in your mind\nis because of the fact that if you don't\nyou're not going to do what needs to be\ndone but it needs to be that of that\nimportant for you so we could all make\nto-do lists right now that could be 75\nthings long\nbut are those things going to be all\nneeded moving activities in your life\nabsolutely not so how can we look at the\nthings that we know are needle-moving\nand prioritize those over everything\nelse and it's very simple\nyou plan the life that you want you\nfigure out what actions need to be taken\nand then you prioritize those actions\nover everything else you don't go to bed\nuntil they're done that's how committed\nyou need to be to your goals i do not go\nto bed until x is done i don't go to bed\nuntil my workout is done i don't go to\nbed until i make\na hundred cold calls i don't go to bed\nuntil i have\nyou know\neating the food that i need to i don't\ngo to bed if\nif i uh i don't go to bed if i haven't\ntold my spouse i love them whatever it\nis you're trying i don't go to bed\nunless i've meditated for the day\nwhatever it is that you're trying to\ncreate you need to prioritize those\ngoals and they need to be that important\nto you and you don't go to bed until\nthey're done and it comes down to this\nsimple phrase if it's important to you\nyou'll find a way\nif it's not you'll find an excuse\nhow many people\nwe've seen movies on it how many people\nhave run out of money they've been on\nthe streets they haven't had whatever it\nis that they need\nbut they've done what needs to be done\nin order to feed their children maybe\nthey steal\nmaybe they borrow some stuff maybe they\nfigure out a way to make money because\nthey need to pay their kids if it's they\nneed to pay their kids need to feed\ntheir kids if it's important to you\nyou'll find a way if it's not you'll\nfind an excuse you'll never run out of\ntime to feed your children it's a\npriority it gets done\nno matter what and that's the mindset\nthat you have around it as a parent i'm\ngoing to feed them i'm going to take\ncare of them what is supposed to be done\nwill be done that's what your life is\nbuilt off of well can it also be built\noff of can can the things that are most\nimportant that move them needle also be\nbuilt the same way in your mind and so i\nwant to ask you this question\nlet's take the next three months of your\nlife let's think about the most\nimportant activity over the next three\nmonths in your life\ndo you prioritize it\njust ask yourself and let's be honest\ndo you prioritize it is it a priority\nfor you how many times have you tried\nthat thing and given up let's say weight\nloss this thing how many times you tried\nlosing weight but you've given up how\nmany times have you tried losing weight\nyou've given them how many diets have\nyou tried but then you gave up how many\ntimes you said today's this is the year\nthis is my year to get in shape my news\nis delicious i'm going to lose weight\nand then you've freaking given up on it\nthink about that for a second\nwhat do you do on a daily basis though\nthat's not a priority and so here's what\nwe're going to do we're going to figure\nout number one what is your priority\nwrite that down with pen and paper if\nyou have a pen and paper what is your\npriority over the next three months that\nis a needle moving activity i don't need\nyou to figure out a hundred different\nthings i just need to figure out one for\nright now what is that one thing that is\na needle-moving activity for you\nwrite it down with pen and paper now i\nwant you to think about all of the\nthings that you do on a daily basis that\nare not priorities for you\nthink about it doing the laundry\nyou know\nmaybe it's uh doing the dishes\nwatching tv scrolling on instagram think\nof every single action that you take\nthat is not a priority for you and then\nask yourself a couple questions are\nthere any of these things that could be\noutsourced\nlike is it possible that these things\ncan be outsourced like for instance\ni have a lawn i don't mow my lawn i did\nat one point mow my lawn but i stopped\nwhy because it takes a couple hours a\ncouple times it takes a couple hours\nover the course of a month i could use\nthose hours doing something to that is\nthe priority for me\nnow some of you are like yeah but i\ndon't have the money to pay for someone\nto mow my lawn okay\nwell is there anything else that could\nbe outsourced and if you were to\noutsource mowing your lawn and use those\nlet's call it four hours over the course\nof a month could you make more than that\nfor out that more than the money that\nyou pay the person\nto be able to actually\npay them so that you can go and do the\nthing that is the priority for you is\nthere stuff that could be outsourced you\nknow if we're talking about cleaning the\nhouse is it possible for you to have\nsomeone clean once a month that would at\nleast help have them come every couple\nweeks is there a way to outsource some\nof the things that are not a priority\nfor you that's what i want you to do so\nyou're going to make a list of all the\nthings that you do on a daily basis and\nadd to this list throughout the day as\nyou do things oh i do this oh i do this\noh i do this so i do this that are all\nthe things that are not a priority and\nstart to ask yourself is it possible for\nme to outsource these is it possible\nthat you can ask someone that you live\nwith to help with these things you know\nmaybe maybe it's the month you live with\nmaybe you can assign one of your\nchildren to do the laundry for the month\nmaybe just have one of your children to\ndo the dishes for the month is it\npossible for you to assign somebody that\nyou live with some of these tasks what\nabout work is it possible for you to\nassign somebody that you work with to do\nsome of the tasks that you're doing that\nyou don't need to do that are not a\npriority for you i know people when they\nget promoted\nsome people will completely change the\nthings to do some people will do do the\njob that they don't need to be doing\nbecause they don't trust other people to\ndo it so\nif you're at work and you're doing\nthings that are not a priority for you\nto move the needle can you outsource\nthat someone else is there someone else\nthat can help you and then when you look\nat the list of things what are those\nthings that you actually need to stop\ndoing\nright so if you're like oh i don't have\nenough time but then you're watching\nnetflix for an hour every single night\nwhere did that freaking time come from\nto say that you don't have time\nbut you have a netflix subscription then\nyou watch it that's bullsh you're lying\nto yourself you can keep lying to\nyourself if you want\nbut the numbers don't lie and if the the\nsuccess in your business or your on the\nscale or whatever it is they don't lie\nand so could you prioritize your life\ndifferently and say oh you know what\nyeah maybe over the next three months i\nwon't watch any netflix i'll prioritize\nthis one thing and just go for this one\nthing what would your life look like if\nyou decided to switch some things around\nand actually start doing that and then\nyou start asking yourself am i being\nbusy or am i being productive\nso this is important to think about\nwe're busy all day long we all are\nbecause we're all doing something even\nif we're doing nothing we're still doing\nsomething if even if we're just sitting\naround watching netflix we're still\nwatching netflix even if we're just\nsitting on the couch scrolling on\ninstagram we're still on instagram we're\nstill doing something even more doing\nnothing even if we're just staring at\nthe ceiling and breathing we're still\njust breathing right we're doing\nsomething always we're all so busy but\nthe question is are you busy\nor are you productive have you ever had\na day\nwhere you're just\nyou're like a chicken with your head cut\noff you're doing things you're doing\nthings you're doing things doing things\nand then you get home or you lay your\nhead down and you're like man i was busy\nall day and i feel like i got nothing\ndone have you ever had one of those days\nbefore well you're just so damn busy but\nfor some reason you feel like you got\nnothing done well don't know why that is\nbecause you were busy you weren't\nproductive and so if you feel like\nyou're busy all day and not moving the\nneedle it's because you're not working\non things that are gonna that are\npriorities for you should be priorities\nfor you\nthat they're gonna move the needle and\nso\nsimple tip if you've been listening for\nlong enough that'll just help you\nconquer this real quickly it's the\nsimplest thing i tell people all the\ntime and when they actually start using\nit they're like this is so simple and it\nalso helps so much you make your to-do\nlist every single morning\nyou go through and you look at it and\nyou say okay\nwhat is number one what is number two\nand what is number three that are the\nnumber one number two number three most\nneedle-moving activities that i put down\non this list you circle them okay that's\nnumber one okay that's number two okay\nthat's number three and then what you do\nis you take a three by five card\nyou write down number one you write down\nnumber two you write number three and\nyou put in your back pocket and you\ndon't go to bed\nuntil all three of those things are done\nthat's it it's that simple\nand that is how you have a productive\ndays because when you feel like you're\nbusy\nbut not productive it's because you're\nnot checking off the boxes of things\nthat are important you're just checking\noff your excuse me you're just checking\noff your to-do list and that's not going\nto do anything for you just checking off\nto-do lists and i know so many people\nbecause i say this all the time and\npeople always laugh so many people out\nthere\nyou made your to-do list in the morning\nyou wrote it all down you're like cool\noh my god i got my my to-do list i've\ngot 32 things on my to-do list\nand then you go and do something that's\nnot on your to-do list and you come back\nto your to-do list and you write that\nthing down on your to-do list and then\nyou cross it off so you get that feeling\nof hey i did it\nthat thing was probably not a priority\nfor you\nit's probably not the needle-moving\nactivity that you needed to take so when\nyou create your to-do list every single\nmorning and then you figure out number\none number two number three and you put\nthem on a three by five card you say i\ndo not go to bed until this is done i'm\ngoing to focus on these three things and\nthose are the three things that are\ngoing to move the business the my\nrelationship my family my body whatever\nit is you're trying to work towards\nthese are the three needle moving\nactivities that i need to get done today\nand you don't do anything until number\none is done\nthen you don't do anything until number\ntwo is done and then you don't do\nanything until number three is done and\nthen my question to you is do you take\nthose things and you put them into your\nschedule do you stick to a schedule in\nthe first place or you just kind of run\naround the chicken with like a chicken\nwith your head cut off these are not\nlike hey if i get time for it kind of\nthings like i was talking about my\nfriend who's trying to lose weight if i\nget time for it i'll work out if it's\nsomething that's a i get if i get time\nfor it it's not a priority for you and\nyou don't really care you don't think to\nyourself\nyou know well i will feed jonathan if i\nget time to no it's like it's going to\nbe done\nso your priorities should never be a if\ni get time for it kind of thing your\npriorities are i don't care what happens\ni'm going to get it done today and if\nyou do that those are the ways that\nyou're going to move the needles the\nquickest in your life and your business\nand your body and your relationships and\nyour finances and your wealth everything\nis that you figure out what the most\nimportant things are and you crush them\nevery single day no matter what and they\nare just as high as a priority for you\nas everything else is in your life\nthere's a beautiful quote that says\nyou're born looking like your parents\nbut you'll die looking like your\ndecisions\nand the idea behind this is that\ntoo many people think because they were\nborn into a certain family or they were\nborn into a certain neighborhood or they\nwere born into a certain religion or\nbelief system that they're going to stay\nthat way forever and that's just the\ncards that they were dealt and they just\nhave to deal with it that way they never\nactually think outside of the\ncircumstances that they were given the\nfamily that they were given the religion\nthat they were given the neighborhood\nthat they were given the skin color they\nwere given the sexuality they were given\nall of those things they never think\noutside of it and saying you know\nmaybe i am not what i've been given\nmaybe i am whatever i build myself up to\nbe you know there's a that beautiful\nstory of the two twin brothers right and\ntheir father's an alcoholic and years\ndown the road\none of the one of the brothers is an\nalcoholic and the other one is a\nsuccessful businessman and they go up to\nthe one who's a successful business or\nthe two who's an alcoholic and they say\nwhy are you an alcoholic and he says i'm\nan alcoholic because my father was an\nalcoholic and they go up to one that's a\nsuccessful business man they said why\nare you a successful businessman\nand why are you not an alcoholic he said\ni'm not an alcoholic because my father\nwas an alcoholic and that gives you the\nperfect example of you were given the\ncards you were given you were given the\nlife you were given the family the\nneighborhood the skin color whatever it\nis that you're dealing with you were\ngiven that that is the cards that you\nwere given you can't choose your parents\nyou can't choose your family you can't\nchoose any of that but you can choose\nwhether or not you want to be similar to\nyour parents whether you want to be\ndifferent than your parents whether you\nwant to be similar to the people in your\nneighborhood or in your family or\nwhether you want to be different than\nthem and you can pick the good\nand then you can leave behind the bat if\nyou want to you're not stuck in the same\nposition you're not a tree you can\nchange at any moment and move to any\ncircumstance in any life that you want\nbut your life is a and what your life\nwill become is just simply a result of\nthe decisions that you make the big\ndecisions that you make in your life can\nbe like the people that you marry the\nperson that you marry the if you decide\nto have children or not those are all\nbig decisions and of course your life is\ngoing to change with those big decisions\nbut there's also these little tiny\ndecisions that most people don't usually\nthink about those little teeny tiny\ndecisions are sometimes more important\nthan the big decisions because they\ncreate who you're going to be and that's\na beautiful thing to think about and the\nmoment that your life will change if you\nhaven't done this yet the moment your\nlife changes when you decide to take\naccountability for everything in your\nlife you decide to take accountability\nfor your current circumstances for what\nyou look like for what you feel like for\nyour bank account for your business for\nyour relationships for your family you\ndecide to go you know what\ni'm going to take accountability for\nevery single aspect of this even if\nnobody else decides to ever step up and\ntake accountability for it i'm going to\ntake accountability for it i'm going to\nmake the decision\nthat i am the one that's in control here\nand a lot of people will think\nokay if i just say that i'm going to\ntake accountability for everything that\nsounds like\ni'm putting myself into a box it feels\nlike i'm stuck in a box and i can't get\nout of this box because i'm literally\nstuck here what am i supposed to do i'm\nstuck in this box\nall of this stuff is my decision but in\nreality that's when you really step into\nyour power is when you realize that your\ndecisions are what make you and from now\non from this moment on i'm going to make\na decision right now that from this\nmoment\nevery decision that i make i'm going to\nput in with more intention towards the\ndesired outcome that i want in my life\nthat's that's simple just the desired\noutcome that i want in my life i do want\nto say this\na lot of people like to go through life\nand not make the decision to step up you\nknow they they're like you know what i'm\ngonna play small i'm okay with playing\nsmall i'm okay with dimming my flame\ni'm okay with just staying where i am\ni'm not gonna make the decision to step\nup to not make the decision to step up\nyour life and to take control of it is\nstill a decision\nyou realize that right it's still a\ndecision whether you want it to be the\ndecision that that you want to be or not\nor whether it is the decision that you\nwant to be or not it's still a decision\nso either you make a decision to fully\nstep into your full power to your full\nlight to the amazingness that your life\ncan be and that you can create it to be\nor you decide to make a decision to\nleave the same that it's always been to\nnot make changes to stay inside of your\ncomfort zone to not bring out your full\npotential and to not change the world in\nthe ways that you can big or small\nwhat's your decision you've got to make\nthe decision at some point in time\nare you going to create the life that\nyou want or are you just going to stay\nthe same\nwhat's your decision so if you're born\ninto this world looking like your\nparents\nbut you leave this world looking at your\ndecisions let's talk about some of the\ndecisions that you consciously are\nunconsciously making at all points in\ntime your body is an easy example the\nreason why it's easy is because it's\nit's a physical thing in the physical\nreality you can see your body if you're\nlooking at your body right now and\nyou're like damn\nthis thing looks good and when you put\non your clothes and your naked you're\nlike damn that body looks good that's\nthe result of your decisions that you've\nmade big decisions and small decisions\nif you look at your body and you don't\nenjoy the way that it looks or you know\nthat you could be treating it better\nthat it could look better that is a\nresult of your decisions nobody else's\ndecisions\nit's your decisions\nso when we look at that you're born with\nthe same genes as your parents sure some\npeople are saying oh yeah but you know\nmy father had this disease and my mother\nhad this issue\nit runs in my family right it's like\nthat phrase not to be offensive but\ntruthful someone's like well you know\nobesity runs in my family it's like the\nphrases it's not obesity runs your\nfamily it's that nobody runs in your\nfamily it's it might be that your genes\nit is harder for you to lose weight but\nit doesn't mean that it's impossible\nwhenever you say something i have this i\nam this this is something i'd be given\nin my genes and obviously i understand\nthere's stuff outside of our\ncircumstances in rare cases somebody's\nborn with something they're born with\nthe disease they have you know something\nthat's that's there but i'm talking to\nlike 95 of people who don't have\nsomething and they're just using their\nexcuses as to why they're not going to\nstep up and finally take control of your\nlife so if you look at your body we're\nborn with our parents jeans in some sort\nof way but it doesn't mean that when i\ndie my body needs to look the same as my\nfather's when he died\nit doesn't mean\nthat because i never saw my father work\nout once ever in my entire life doesn't\nmean that i shouldn't work out i also\ndidn't see my dad eating healthy\nright doesn't mean that i should treat\nmy body the same way he did i also saw\nmy father being an alcoholic doesn't\nmean that i should step up and do the\nsame thing right what i've decided\nbecause my father was an alcoholic his\nfather was an alcoholic it's a\ngenerational thing it ends up happening\nthis way and if you look through many\nmany families it's very common that if\nsomebody's family father was an\nalcoholic her mother was an alcoholic\nit's usually that their father mother's\nan alcoholic and so on and so forth it's\na generational thing i made the decision\nthat it stops with me i'm just not going\nto be an alcoholic my mom's been worried\nsince i was a kid that oh you know what\nif\ni've heard alcoholism is in the genes\nand it's it's in their brain and it's\nsomething that's like that i don't have\nit i'm not going to have it i'm not\ngoing to allow myself to have it i've\nmade the decision right so if you're out\nthere and you have a alcoholic parent in\nsome sort of way or maybe addicted drugs\nin some sort of way you can make the\ndecision i will not allow that to be me\ni saw the way my parents took care of\nthe body that won't be me that's what\nyou can say to yourself i appreciate\nmyself too much i'm gonna pay attention\nto the food that i consume i'm gonna pay\nattention to working out i'm gonna pay\nattention to the sleep that i get the\namount of water that i drink taking care\nof your body or not taking care of your\nbody that is a decision whether you want\nto pretend that it is not your decision\nand you're just given these\ncircumstances there's nothing you can do\nabout it is up to you but ultimately\neverything in your life is your decision\nnext let's talk about business you know\nwhat i love why i love business i love\nbusiness because if you're a business\nowner your business is a part of you\nyour business is a living\nbreathing thing that is externally\noutside of you if your business is doing\namazing\nthat's usually a reflection of how\nyou're doing in your own mind if your\nbusiness is plummeting or it's not\ntaking off\nor it's you know you feel like you've\nbeen spinning your wheels for a while\nwell you've got to look at yourself stop\nlooking at the external look at the\nintro and say okay if it's a mirror of\nme how can i improve and what do i need\nto do in order to take my life to the\nnext level in order to take my personal\nelement to the next level because your\nbusiness will never outgrow you your\nbank account will never outgrow you they\nwill only lag you know they will lag\nbehind your purse development your\nspiritual development your development\nof yourself your business will not\noutgrow the container that you are and\nyou can grow the container that you are\nwith everything that you learn\neverything that you get better at so\nyour business it is a reflection of you\nif it's doing amazing you're probably\ndoing pretty well if it's not doing well\nthere's probably some things that you\ncould pick up and change and make better\nthan yourself and your business will be\na reflection of that see what i'm saying\nhere that's a decision when you look at\nyour bank account\nbelieve me i've had overdraft fees many\nmany many many times and i'm like damn\nthis\nbank of america keeps taking 30 bucks\nfor me even though i've only got five\nbucks in my bank account\nand i overdraw and i go to like negative\none dollar and then i'm like negative\nthirty one dollars i'm like how the hell\nam i negative 31 oh because bank of\namerica wanted to take 30 bucks for me\ni've been in that situation before i've\nbeen five months behind on my car\npayment i've been in a situation where\ni've almost lost everything like really\nclose\nbut i took a step back and realized that\nthat was just a reflection of where i\nwas in my life and as i grew my bank\naccount grew my business grew everything\nthat i did group i'm only telling you\nthis because i can tell you just from\nexperience when i noticed that things\nweren't going the way i wanted the two\nin my life i looked at myself and said\noh\ni am the reason why my life is the\nculmination of my decisions that i'm\nmaking of everything that i've made if\nyou look at your family\nhow's your family life going you know it\ncould be your\nrelationship with your wife how's that\ngoing well it's probably a reflection\nreflection of you you know what how\nyou're showing up it's a reflection of\nthem and how they're showing up your\nrelationship with your children it's a\nreflection of the decisions that you\nmake and you can look at it and say okay\nyou know there were some great aspects\nof my parents there were some not great\naspects of my parents in the way that\nthey raised me everyone can look at that\nand i can identify the things they love\nabout their parents think they love\nabout their parents and they can make a\ndecision that they're not going to\nfollow the exact same path or they can\njust make no decision and just blindly\ndo the exact same thing their parents\ndid and it's just rinse and repeat and\nrinse and repeat and rinse repeat then\nyour children do the same in their\nchildren do the same do you want that to\nbe a generational thing\nor do you want to stop it right now\nthat's fully up to you it's full of your\ndecision so what is it that you want\nwhen you look at your relationships with\neverybody outside of your family maybe\noutside of your your you know your\nchildren and your spouse maybe you look\nat your relationship with your parents\nand you say okay you know it isn't the\nbest that it could be better okay well\nthen i need to make the decision that\ni'm going to show up differently because\nthey're probably not going to make a\ndecision to show up differently i'm\ngoing to make a decision that i'm going\nto show up differently next time i'm\naround them it's like ramdas always says\nif you think you're enlightened spend a\nweek with your family right your family\nknows the triggers they know what to do\nthey trigger you more than anybody else\nthey show us where we need to improve\nthey show us and teach us there's so\nmany lessons in every single thing that\nhappens to us when we're around them so\nwhen you look at that you go okay\nit could be better with my relationships\nwith my mom with my father with my\nsister with my brother with my aunts\nuncles i'm going to make the decision\ni don't care how they show up i'm going\nto show up differently from now on and\nthey're going to probably eventually\nstart to show up differently as well\nthat's a good thing to do okay let's go\nto the next thing what about our\nrelationship with our friends we can\nstay\nand stay friends with somebody simply\njust because we've known them for a long\ntime and we feel obligated to spend time\nwith them simply because we've known\neach other since we were six years old\ni'm not saying break any friendships and\nnever see somebody ever again but do you\nhave relationships that are not serving\nyou as much anymore it is your decision\nthat you're staying in those\nrelationships it is also your decision\nif you decide that you want to get out\nof those relationships or spend less\ntime in those relationships everything\naround you is your decision stop acting\nlike you don't have power or control\nover your life because the moment that\nyou decide to step into the driver's\nseat and say you know what when i look\nat my body i know i can change and make\nit better when i look at my business i\nknow i can change i can make it better\nwhen i look at my bank account i know i\ncan change it i can make it better i\nwant to look at my relationship with my\nspouse i can make it better when i look\nat my\nchildren i look at it and see that i can\nmake my relationship with them better\nwhen i look at my family my relationship\nwith my mom and my dad and my brother\nand my sister my aunts i can make all of\nthose better when i look at my\nrelationship with my children they can\nthey can be better i look at my\nrelationship with my friends and the\npeople i surround myself with all of\nthose things can be better\nso what do i have to do\ni can either sit back and make a\ndecision to not make the decision to\nchange which is still a decision\nand keep everything exactly the same or\nif something's going to change i'm going\nto need to change i'm going to step up\nand make the decision that i'm going to\nchange every single aspect of my life of\nwhat i do and make sure i do everything\ndifferently if i'm not happy about where\nmy life is right now i'm just going to\nstart doing everything differently i go\nto bed late i'm going to start going to\nbed early i'm going to start waking up\nearly if i normally talk negatively\nmyself i'm starting talking positive\nmyself i normally eat a cheeseburger for\nlunch i'm gonna start eating a salad if\ni normally don't work out i'm gonna\nstart working out just do something\ndifferently make the decision to do\nsomething different and do it for 30\ndays and see how you feel and if you\ndon't like it change it make something\nelse you're not a tree you're not stuck\nin the exact same position forever you\ncan change at any moment the only thing\nthat you have to have the awareness of\nis that you have the power to change at\nany moment nobody's telling you you have\nto stay the same the only one that's\ntelling you that you have to stay the\nsame is you\neither you stay in the exact same\ncircumstances and make that decision to\nstay or you wake up you change and you\ndecide that you're going to do something\ndifferent with your life whatever you\ndecide is your decision you're born\nlooking like your parents you die\nlooking like your decisions\nwhat are the decisions that you're going\nto make to change your life\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well
