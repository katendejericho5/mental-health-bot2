    "transcript": "pain is inevitable suffering is optional\nwe so badly almost every person that i\nmeet has some form of a control problem\nyou will have stress and anxiety when\nyou're focusing on trying to control\nthings that you cannot control\nwe're going to talk about the death of\neveryone that you know that's around you\nand how to cope with death we're also\ngoing to talk about your own death and\nhow to become more okay with it right\nand the interesting thing about death is\nthat it is guaranteed it will happen no\nmatter what\nuh and and we really need to learn that\nif it's going to happen it's nothing we\ncan get away from we need to try to\nbecome as okay with it as we possibly\ncan because everybody that you love will\ndie\nright like it sounds morbid but in\nreality it's not that morbid it's just\nfact\nand you\nwill die\nand so we're going to talk about both of\nthose because i get a ton of messages so\nmany messages on on instagram from\npeople and i read all the messages right\nof\nthey lost somebody they don't know how\nto get past it right they lost a loved\none they just died of old age or they\nhad something that happened to them that\nwas tragic or there was a suicide or it\nwas their grandparents or it was their\nparents\nsome people it was old age some people\nit was young age and it was something\nthat was tragic that happened it's every\ntype of thing that you could some of\nthem are overdoses every type of of\ndeath you could think of i've been send\nmessages about it and when i see\nsomething that comes through\nmany many many many times in my\ninstagram messages i go huh i should\nprobably make an episode on this because\nthis is clearly something people want to\nlearn about so\nfor those of you guys that want\nto you know message me and give me some\nform of request of what i should do an\nepisode on message me on instagram\nthat's where i usually talk to people\nrob dial junior\nr-b-d-i-a-l-j-r that's how i communicate\nand talk with people but when we're\ngoing into death and we're talking about\ndeath i've seen it come up many many\ntimes and people are struggling all the\ntime\nwith how do they cope with it you know\nsomeone that they love they won't expect\nthem to die it happened how do you work\nthrough it the first thing that i think\nis important is before anybody dies\nat this moment\nyou have to learn to start becoming more\nokay with it because it's going to\nhappen for everybody right\nto you to your loved ones to everyone\nand that's not morbid it's just a fact\nso first let's dive into the death of\nsomeone that you know before we talk\nabout your own death we'll talk about\nboth of them we'll dive into them and\ni'm going to make it as light as\npossible because it's going to happen\nwhy would i want to make it depressing\nright\nso i'll talk about how you know in\nmy instance of how i've had some\nrelations with death you know up into my\nfirst 14 years i never knew one person\nthat died maybe some older person that i\ndidn't really know that was in my family\nlike a distant cousin or distant aunt or\nuncle or whatever it was but no one that\nwas i was really close to had passed\naway my first 14 years then when i was\n15 my dad died unexpectedly he was an\nalcoholic we weren't expecting him to\ndie\nhe did we were flying up to go see him\nfrom florida to tennessee and we were\ngetting about to get on the plane\nto go see him because he was unconscious\nand we got the message that he had\npassed away i was and you know he was\nthe first dead body i'd ever seen and\nthat left a really big imprint on my\nmind of\nholy this is going to end like this\nas much if you've ever been to a funeral\nof someone that you know and that you're\nclose to it feels like a joke it feels\nlike they're about to pop up and be like\nhey just kidding no no no just joking\ni'm let's go hang out right and it never\nhappens and so it's the it's that\nrealization of like oh wow this is going\nto happen to everyone that i know and\nthat's going to happen to me as well\ni would say that moment\nchanged my life as far as the urgency\nthat i bring to every single thing that\ni do then i'll talk more about that\nlater right i was also in the room uh\nabout three or four years ago when my\ngrandfather passed away right i was in\nthe room in hospice\nthere\nit's a crazy experience to be in the\nroom when someone passes away right i\nwas there\ni was also there when my mom and her\nthree sisters\ntold my grandmother that her husband of\n70 years had passed away right that's a\nwhole other thing to see is to see\nsomebody process that in real time\nright i've had friends die from car\naccidents i've had friends die from\noverdoses i've had friends die from\nsuicides i've had friends that have been\nmurdered i've seen a quite a few\ndifferent sides of death\nand uh\ni don't know if i just gave you like my\nqualifications for talking about death\nbut i guess i just did but i'm going to\ntell you what i have learned through the\nprocess being somebody who is obsessed\nwith mindset obsessed with trying to get\nbetter and the first thing is is there's\nalways a grieving process right\nand one thing that i've noticed with\npeople\nis they try to speed up the greeting\nprocess whatever the grieving process is\nthe grieving processes don't try to\nspeed it up don't try to not feel it\ndon't try to keep yourself busy that's\none thing that pisses me off the most is\nwhen somebody has somebody that they're\nthey're dealing with the emotions of\ndeath and someone says well just keep\nyourself busy so you don't think about\nit yeah that sounds like a really\ngreat way to just repress your emotions\nyou don't want to do that feel it\nas beautiful it is to experience the\nmost beautiful amazing joyful\nloving parts of your life\nthe other emotions\nare also very beautiful and it's part of\nthe human experience and if you can't\nallow yourself to experience the lowest\nof lows i promise you actually won't be\nable to allow yourself to experience the\nhighest of highs so allow yourself to\nfeel it don't feel like you there's a\nright way to do it and a wrong way to do\nit there is no right there is no wrong\njust experience it and see if you can\nenjoy\nthis part of the human experience right\nso i will say that and as far as grief\nand the way that it goes\nis one of the best ways i've heard it\nexplains it's kind of like waves right\ngoing out to the ocean you know in when\nyou first have someone that you love\nthat passes away it's like the waves are\n100 feet tall and they're just crashing\non you and crashing on you and crashing\non you and you can barely come up for\nair that's like how it feels in the very\nbeginning where it's like you're just\ngetting swept in every single emotion\nand feeling and anger will come up and\nsadness will come up and fear will come\nup and you're just getting hit by\nconstantly rocked by these waves\nand then\ntime starts to pass and the waves start\nto come a little bit less frequently but\nwhen they do come they're still 100 feet\ntall and they'll still throw you upon\nthe rocks and you try to get up and try\nto have some form of air to come up\nright\nand then\nyou know as time goes on you tend to\nprocess and you know the waves will\nstill come\nunexpectedly but instead of being 100\nfeet tall they might be 50 feet tall\nthey might they might get to 20 feet\ntall and 30 feet tall and sometimes they\nthen after a while they come really\nunexpectedly could be a year two years\ndown the road it might be like a a song\nthat you hear that just hits you again\nand you can't help but be overcome with\nemotion or it might be driving past a\ncertain part of town and seeing a you\nknow\na gas station where you have a memory\nwith that person and you just get hit\nagain and there's nothing wrong with\nthat\nright the human experience is a\nbeautiful thing the highs are beautiful\nthe lows are beautiful the worst things\nyou can do is try to rush a grieving\nprocess or think that you're doing it\nright or think that you're doing it\nwrong one of the things that i always\ntell people if you want to help yourself\nif you love somebody that died\nright they're not going to come back\nlike i can promise you that\nbut one of the things you can do is you\ncan help them live on in you and what do\ni mean by that this is something i do\nwith my grandfather my grandfather was\nlike\nthe kindest person that i've ever met my\nentire life he was incredible to the\npoint where like i'm finally at the\npoint where i don't cry talking about\nhim because he was just that incredible\nof a human being right and so when he\npassed away it was such a another\nmonumental event in my life that i wrote\ndown and this was a few years ago so i\nwas at least you know\nemotionally intelligent enough to work\nmyself through it because i had worked\nmany clients through at this point in\ntime not like when i was 15 and i had\nnever had a client never really worked\non myself at all right so i wrote down\nall the things that i loved about my\ngrandfather unconditionally like\nliterally\nthe only person i know with\nunconditional love like no matter what\nhe was going to help you out right he\nkindness and loving and joy didn't\nmatter who you are what you believed in\nwhat you looked like didn't matter loved\nyou either way\nso i wrote down all the things that i\nloved about him and the character traits\nthat i\nrespected most about him\nand then what i did was i went i want to\nwake up every single morning and\nmeditate on how i can be more like this\nbecause if i fully respect somebody and\nwho they are in the character traits\nthat they have wouldn't i want those\ncharacter traits to also be inside of me\nand isn't that the best way the best way\nto actually keep that person alive after\nthey have passed away so i recommend\nif you have somebody that's recently\npassed away or you have somebody who\npasses away soon enough or even if they\npass away decent pass write down the two\nthree four five things that you love\nmost about them and then wake up every\nsingle morning and take five minutes and\npause and read those five things and\nclose your eyes and try to get into your\nsubconscious of i'm going to bring\nthese aspects of this person into myself\nevery single day and if you do that\nevery single day what you'll realize is\nyou actually start to become\nthe aspects of that person that you love\nthe most so that's the interesting thing\nabout the grieving process and how to\nhelp you work through it another thing\nthat will help you as well\nis to realize the difference between\npain versus suffering and this is super\nimportant okay because pain is the pain\nthat you feel and pain is inevitable you\ncan't go through this life without some\nform of pain pain is inevitable you're\ngoing to have scars in this in any\nlifetime you're going to have scars pain\nis inevitable suffering is optional\nwhat do i mean by that pain is somebody\ndied in the emotions that you feel with\nthat\npain is the the feelings that you feel\nfrom the loss of someone\nsuffering\nis the resistance\nto someone's death which then makes it\neven worse it is the unnecessary part of\nit right it's the thoughts of oh my gosh\nthey were too young it it shouldn't have\nbeen them\nit shouldn't have happened this way\nmaybe what did i do wrong part of this\nis my fault i should have been\nbeen there for them i shouldn't have let\nthem get in the car i shouldn't have let\nthem do that thing\nand most of the time the suffering comes\nfrom not accepting\nright so there's the pain of the event\nthat's going to happen you're going to\nhave pain it's part of being a human\nthe suffering is not accepting it and\nwishing that it was different there is\nno other way that it could have happened\nbecause it didn't happen any other way\nit happened the way that it happened it\ncould not have happened any other way\nwhy because it didn't\nyou have to learn to accept the\nsuffering comes when you are resisting\nthe way that the world is there's\nnothing you can do about them it is in\nthe past there's nothing you can do\nabout anything in your past right the\nonly thing that you can do something\nabout is you\nso you have to learn to accept\nyou cannot change\nexcept that that's just the way that the\nworld is\nright another thing that i always tell\nmyself that i heard from ram das who is\na spiritual teacher who passed away\nabout a year and a half ago\nis something that i say every that i've\nnoticed and i start to say to myself\nover the past year and a half when\nsomeone that i know passes away and what\nhe says is that a soul does not leave\nthis plane that we're in a second too\nsoon or a second too late\nit happened exactly where that is\nsupposed to happen if you believe in god\nor the universe or fate or\nyou know\nthe quantum realm of all of this stuff\nthat's happening\nyou've got to believe that everything\nhappens the way that it's supposed to\nright and i've just accepted i'm not in\ncontrol i'm not in control of when\nsomeone leaves this time i'm not in\ncontrol of when i leave this\nit's going to happen the way it's\nsupposed to happen the soul does not\nleave this plane a second too soon or a\nsecond too\nlate just the way it goes it worked out\nexactly was supposed to work out that\nwas you know if you want to say that was\ntheir karmic predicament\nit could be and the way that you're\nreacting to it is also your karmic\npredicament too what's going on with\nthat so you have to realize that\ndeath is going to happen but you can\nmake it easier on yourself by instead of\nnot accepting\nactually sitting down accepting and\nstart figuring out what you love most\nabout them and bringing that person into\nyourself and then being okay and not\njudging yourself for the grieving\nprocess and allowing things just to\nhappen so that's the death of a loved\none now\nlet's talk about you dying because it's\ngoing to happen you're not going to be\nable to live to 500 years old you know\nthere's all these people that are\ntalking about longevity and living\nforever and putting yourself inside of a\nfreezer until something i don't know\nwhat all that stuff is i'm not going to\nresist it it's going to happen right\nit's going to happen and most people are\nterrified of it\nit's it's gonna happen there's nothing\nyou can do about it so you might as well\nfigure out a way to become at least a\nlittle bit more okay with it right no\nmatter how terrified you are of it it's\nstill gonna happen so you might as well\naccept that\nright\nbut the way that i see death is i see\ndeath as a beautiful part of life\nright we're dying at every single second\ni am if you're watching me on video i am\nslowly decaying in front of you every\nsingle second as beautiful as that\nsounds right i'm decaying in front of\nyou\nfor those of you guys that are listening\nto me just on the podcast\nmy voice is slowly deteriorating for you\nright but the beautiful thing about\ndeath in my opinion is death gives your\nlife urgency\nright if you didn't have to die\nif you were immortal\nyou'd always have tomorrow\nah why do i need to go ahead and\ntry to build this business why do i need\nto try to get into that relationship\nhelp the world\nmake money have fun\nyou know change other people's lives\nbecause there's always tomorrow\nbut the beautiful thing about death is\nthat there is not always tomorrow\ntomorrow is never guaranteed and so if\nyou take life and look at it that way\nyou realize\nthat that should bring your life some\nurgency an urgency in a good way\nand if you deal with if you've ever\nheard of stoic philosophy\nthere's a stoic phrase and stoics the\nbeautiful thing about the phrase that i\nheard around it not the original phrase\ni was going to tell you i'll tell you\nthat in a second but a phrase i heard\naround stoicism is that stoicism doesn't\ndoesn't take away human emotions it\ndomesticates them it makes you\nunderstand the emotions feel them and be\nable to work through them and process\nthem in real time and one of the things\nthat they say the phrase in stoicism is\nmomentum mori momento mori\nright which means remember that you're\ngoing to die\nand you may have heard me talk about\nthis in the podcast before and uh this\ni've thought this way even before i ever\nheard the phrase you know memento mori\nand i remember i was having a\nconversation with my mom not too long\nago i was like mom\njust curious how often do you think of\ndeath and she's like oh i don't know\nmaybe\nmaybe once a week once every two weeks\nor so i was like oh okay and she could\nwhy\nwhy how often do you think of death and\ni was like ah\ni don't know probably every\nfew hours\nfive times a day ten times a day and\nshe's like really i was like yeah but\nnot in the creepy way like ooh i'm\nthinking about death or i'm thinking\nabout dead people or anything that type\nof stuff or you know i can't wait till\nit happens or can i go i wasn't thinking\nany of that type of stuff it's just like\nit's going to happen and if i think\nabout the fact that it's going to happen\nit brings me urgency i always say that i\ndon't really have any fears anymore\nexcept for one like i don't care what\npeople think about i don't care about\nother people's opinions or judgments i\ndon't care about failing i don't care\nabout any of that stuff i've worked\nthrough it mostly i won't say i'm just\ncompletely it but it's basically mostly\ngone right the one fear that i really do\nhave though is that i'm going to get to\nmy deathbed and wish that i would have\ndone something more to bring out my true\npotential for the world right the only\nthing worse than the pain of hard work\nis a pain of regret i do not want to\nregret anything\nwhen i die\ni want to get to my deathbed and be like\ndamn that was fun\nyou did everything you could kid you did\nit all you did everything you built the\nbusiness you wanted to you had the\nfamily you wanted to you had the kids\nyou wanted to you impact the world that\nyou weigh you wanted to all of that\nstuff and the reason why i do what i do\nand the reason why i push so much harder\nthan a lot of other people that are in\nmy industry because i'm gonna die\nand i pay attention that every single\nday like i think about it all of the\ntime i'm very aware of it and it's a\nbeautiful thing\nso i want to experience everything that\nthere is in this world i don't\nexperience all of the beautiful all of\nthe the hard stuff i won't experience\neverything there is i want to bring out\nall of the potential that i feel that i\nhave inside of myself and i know you all\nfeel that you have some potential inside\nof you i want to release all of it to\nthe world so therefore when i do get to\nthat day when it will eventually happen\ni can go\nall right\ni'm ready\ni've done all that i can\nso when you can come to terms that\neveryone that you know is going to die\nand you are going to die as well\nand you can come to terms with it and\nsee it as a beautiful thing and give it\ngive it have it give you\nmore beautiful things in life than\nnegative things when you start thinking\nabout death and when death happens to\nsee when someone else dies you can take\nthat beautiful part of them and put it\ninto yourself and you can look at your\nown death that will eventually happen\nand have it give you more urgency to get\noff the couch to get off to instagram to\ndo the things you want to to impact the\nworld to impact people around you to\nbring out your potential to the world\nyou realize that death\nis actually one of the most beautiful\nparts of life when things are going\ncrazy we're going to talk about how to\nbe peaceful and we're also going to talk\nabout how to\nchange your relationship with everything\nthat's happened in your past because one\nof the things that i see from a lot of\npeople is that a lot of people are still\nresisting\nthe current moment that they're in and\nthey're still resisting the past and\nthings that have happened them in their\npast even though they have absolutely\nnothing to do with their present moment\nand one of the things that i've been\ntold before we dive in and i give you\nthis phrase that i think could possibly\nchange your life uh one of the things\ni've been told is that i'm uh un\nuncommonly calm in a lot of situations\nand i'll give you a couple of situations\nthat kind of make sense for you the\nfirst things that popped in my head\nthere's three situation pot to my head\nwhen i was thinking about this number\none there was a time when we were\ntraveling my girlfriend i we were in\nchengu bali and uh we were in an uber\nand in bali they don't like ubers so\nliterally somebody came out a bunch of\nthis this local taxi gang is what they\ncall them basically right\nthey come out they start banging on the\nhood they force us to get out they force\nthe driver to get out they're yelling\nthey're screaming it's the middle of the\nnight it's like midnight almost\nand um i remember everyone's freaking\nout and screaming and yelling\nand as they're freaking out i'm going to\nmyself you got to be calm you got to be\ncalm you got to be calm you can't be the\nonly you can't be just just crazy like\nthem and so i had to kind of take the\nsituation and make it calmer right i was\nin this situation i can't change the\nsituation now i've got to figure out how\nto make everybody more calm right i\ndidn't know if anybody had a gun i\ndidn't know if anybody had a machete if\nthere was going to be someone who's\ngoing to be hurt or killed but i just\nknew i had to be calm because nobody\nelse was second time i remember is i\nremember when i used to have an office\nand i had two offices that were right\nnext door to each other and somebody\nbroke into my office in the middle of a\nmeeting they broke into the office to\nthe side stole a tv for me stole a\nnintendo wii that we used to use all the\ntime during team meetings and stuff and\ni remember everyone was like man you're\nso calm during this situation someone\njust stole all of your\ni was like yeah well you know maybe they\nneeded it more than i did\nand then the last thing that popped into\nmy head was you've heard me talk about\nit recently is this whole plane\nsituation where the engine of the plane\nthat i was on caught on fire we had to\ndo an emergency landing and everybody\nwas freaking out and screaming and\ncrying and i had this this thought of\nlike damn i'm really calm in this moment\ni wonder why it is and so then i started\nthinking about it and i think that it\nall comes down to a phrase\nthat i remember kind of brainwashing\ninto myself when i was younger and it\ncomes from one of my friends and one of\nmy first mentors hal elrod and he used\nto literally say it all the time\ngot me to say it all the time and then\nalso at the same time\nmade bracelets that said it and the\nphrase is can't change it\nand the reason why this is so empowering\nis because there's so many circumstances\nin your life right now that are sending\nyou off the deep end or that you're\nworried or that you're stressed or that\nyou have fear or sadness around that you\nliterally cannot change in any sort of\nway so if we go back to those three\nexamples the whole uber situation that's\nhappening in bali can i change the\nsituation i can change the situation yes\ncan i change the fact that i'm in that\ncircumstance and that situation is\nhappening i can't so if i can't change\nit what i need to do is i need to figure\nout how to show up the best that i\npossibly can to it right because i can't\nchange it i'm in this circumstance\neveryone's yelling at each other i don't\nknow if there's guns i don't know if\nthere's someone's going to get hurt\ni just know there's a lot of stuff\nthat's happening in front of me i need\nto figure out how to show up the best\nway that i can because i can't change\nthe circumstance that i'm in okay so\nthat's the first one\nsecond one somebody stole a tv from me\nand nintendo wii and a bunch of other\nstuff sound system that was there as\nwell\ncan i have my stuff unstolen\ni can't\nright so if i can't change it\nthe only thing that i can change is how\ni show up to those circumstances right\nthat's the only thing that i am\nin control of at that moment and then\nthe last one with the plane i can't fly\na freaking plane so if the if there's a\nproblem they have to shut off an engine\nbecause the engines on fire we have to\nland with one engine can i change that\nno i don't know how to fly a plane with\ntwo engines let alone one of them being\nout\nright so the only thing that i can\nchange is my circum is not my\ncircumstance but the way i actually feel\nin that moment and how i show up in that\nmoment and so if you think about this\nphrase it can be super powerful for you\nbecause there's so many things in your\nlife that cause worry frustration anger\nsadness that you literally cannot change\ni'll give you a very simple example that\nprobably happens to every single person\nat least once a week you ready to see\nwhat that is\ntraffic\nright\nif you're stuck in traffic and i've done\nboth of these you can be frustrated and\npissed and you can grip the steering\nwheel until you can see the whites of\nyour knuckles then you can scream and\nyou can cuss about how you're going to\nbe late\nyou can do that and that's completely up\nto you if you want to do that but can\nyou change the traffic that you're stuck\nin by doing that\nno\neven if you don't do that can you change\nyour traffic you can't the only thing\nthat you can do is just go along for the\nride\nthat's the only thing that you can do in\nthat moment right\nso when you think about that and you're\nsitting there and you're pissed and i've\nbeen here but i'm like i'm late i hate\nbeing late first off but i'm late and\ni've got this going on i've got to do\nthis and i'm late and i'm pissed off now\nthat i'm late and i put myself in this\nsituation maybe i left on time and now\ni'm in this situation\ni've been really pissed off in the\nsituations but nothing that i can do in\nthat moment will get rid of all of the\ntraffic\nso\ni've got a choice to make either i can\nbe really pissed off and angry and\nfrustrated or worried in that moment or\nsad or whatever the hell that it is or i\ncan take a step back and say hey rob\nyou can't change it you can't change the\ntraffic\ncan you no you can't there's nothing you\ncan do you don't have a you know tesla\ndoesn't make an airplane yet so i can't\njust take off into the into the sky and\nget to my appointment that i need to get\nto okay\ni'm either gonna be late pissed off or\ni'm gonna be late and happy\nand so what would i rather be i'd rather\nbe happy\nit's just my choice i know about you but\ni'd rather be enjoying my life and\nenjoying my circumstances in life\nversus being pissed off\nand worried and frustrated all the time\nso what can i do okay i could take\nmyself out of the\nout of the the\nworried and frustrated and pissed off\nmode and i can say okay\ni can't change this if i can't change it\nwhat can i appreciate about this moment\nwell why don't i put on some one of my\nfavorite songs i'm gonna listen to a\nsong that i love what else can i look at\nall right\nyou know i can look at the sky oh my\ngosh it's a beautiful day out right now\nit's the sun shining i can appreciate\nthat there's so many things that i can\nappreciate\nin a moment that i was really pissed off\nat 30 seconds ago and so if i can't\nchange my circumstance if i can't change\nthe fact that i'm stuck in traffic i can\nchange the way that i feel\nin that traffic in the way that i feel\nin that traffic will dictate how i show\nup so i can show up pissed off and\nfrustrated that i'm late\nand people can see it on my face and i\ncan put my body through all of this\nthis stuff that it doesn't need to go\nthrough or i can just say you know what\nlet me take a step back\nlet me put on some good music let me\nfind out what i can appreciate and let\nme show up the best that i possibly can\nso if you're in the middle of a\nsituation and you just ask yourself this\nquestion\ncan i change it i can't all right i\ncan't change it what can i love about\nthis moment because the only thing that\nyou can really control in this moment\nand in most moments is literally your\nreaction to the moment that's it\nlike we we so badly almost every person\nthat i meet has some form of a control\nproblem\ni'm one of the people\nto say this as well i have a control\nproblem in many aspects if you're\nlistening this is a pretty good chance\nyou have a control problem in some\naspects of your life\nbut the crazy thing is is we can control\nalmost nothing in our life like\nliterally almost nothing we can control\nand if you think about that you say okay\nwhat is the things that i can control at\nevery moment that i'm 100 sure of my\nreaction to the way i feel about what's\ngoing on how i personally show up how i\nthink about these circumstances and one\nof my favorite quotes is from victor\nfrankl maybe you've heard me say before\nbut you need to get it brainwashed into\nyour head and victor frankel wrote a\nbook called man's search for meaning\nvictor frankel was a psychologist who\nwas who was a jew who was put into\nauschwitz and was watching people get i\nmean some of those brutal things you've\never heard of if you read the book\nand one thing that he says\nin the book is that between stimulus and\nresponse there's such space\nand that space in that space is our\npower to choose our response\nin our response lies our growth and our\nfreedom so let me explain the quote real\nquick\nbetween stimulus and response there's a\nspace so that means something happens\ni'm stuck in traffic whatever it is\nthen i have a response most people act\nlike their response they're not in\ncontrol of which is complete [ __ ]\nyou're in control of your response at\nevery moment it's just most of the time\nit just comes up so quickly because it's\njust programmed into something you've\ndone over and over again that you don't\neven notice it right so between stimulus\nsomething happens in response something\nand i react to that something there's a\nspace and in that space is our power to\nchoose our response you get to choose\nhow you're going to respond it might be\na millisecond\nbut it's still a choice do i want to get\nreally pissed and start screaming at her\nor\nbecause i've been down that road i know\nwhat that looks like do i want to show\nup with love or do i want to get really\npissed off at the\nfrustrated about the traffic or do i\nwant to show up and go you know what i\ndon't want to put my body through all of\nthat stress\nand in our response lies our growth and\nour freedom\nand our response as our growth and our\nfreedom and i think that in this\nquote alone it shows you the path of\npersonal development and you've heard me\nsay before\ni there was times before i used to get\nreally angry about stuff and i would\nstay angry for\na week weeks about one thing that\nhappened i would continue to be angry\nabout something that happened days ago\nor five or six or seven or ten days ago\neven though it has nothing to do with\nthis present moment that i'm in\nright\ni'd stay pissed off for as long as i\npossibly could and i try to justify why\ni should be pissed off right so\nsomething could happen stimulus response\nwould go for a week i'd be pissed off\nand then i started reading a little bit\nmore and trying to work myself and try\nto get better and trying to meditate and\nthen something would happen stimulus in\nresponse would be i'd be pissed off for\nfive or six days\nokay that's that's still not good as i\nwant it to be as good as i wanted to be\nbut it's still better\nand then you work on yourself a little\nbit more in personal development and\nthen it goes to a few days it goes to a\nfew hours and hopefully\nyou know personal development and\npersonal mastery of yourself means\nsomething happens and there is no\nresponse because you have\nmastered and fortified your mind that it\ndoesn't matter what happens to you\nyou're gonna be fine\nand the response is always the way that\nyou want it to be maybe loving maybe\ncaring maybe that's how you want to show\nup and that's the person that you want\nto be\nwell if that's the case if we could get\nthat to be our reaction for everything\nno matter what it's just full acceptance\nlove and trust\ni would say that's self-mastery wouldn't\nyou\nso the path of personal development is\nwrapped up in there between stimulus and\nresponse there's a space and when you\ncan master that space you master your\nfreedom and you master your growth\nyou know and we can't change the we\ncan't change the majority of things that\nare happening to to us around us and we\ncan barely control ourselves and a lot\nof the worry and the stress the anger\nfrustration comes because people are\nresisting\nand not able to change the situation\noutside of them so perfect example right\nnow if you look at everything that's\nhappening with kovid like i can't change\nkovid i don't know how to do any of that\nlike i just i speak it to a microphone\nthat's what i'm good at i don't know how\ni don't know anything about viruses or\nwhat's going on in the world or if the\nstuff that's happening is true or if\nit's not happening and if the conspiracy\ntheorists are true or if they're false\nor if what we're being told is true or\nfalse i don't know any of that stuff i\ndo know that i can't change the\ncircumstance of hey there is lockdowns\nhey there is mass and you want i can't\nchange any of those things right now\nso what can i change the way that i feel\nabout those things how i show up in my\npersonal response to everything that's\nhappening around me that is the only\nthing that i can change so if i can't\nchange my circumstances what do i need\nto do i need to change my response to my\ncircumstances because life is all about\nmastering the reaction that's it you\nknow if you're stuck in traffic if you\nhave coveted going on if somebody breaks\nup with you if somebody dies if you know\n[ __ ] hits the fan whatever it is all you\ncan control is how you show up as a\nperson\nnow does this work for the past because\nas i mentioned in the beginning of this\nepisode\nsome people are still hold holding on to\nthe past\neven though the past is not in this\npresent moment and the past will never\nbe in this present moment so does this\nwork this idea of can't change it for\nthe past absolutely it does\nbecause if there's one thing that i'm\nsure of it's that you don't have a\nfreaking time machine if there's one\nthing that i'm sure of\ni mean i'm actually i'm not sure if you\ndon't have a time machine because i\ndon't go to your house but you may have\na time machine okay i'm sure that i\ndon't have a time machine so if i'm\nworried and frustrated about things that\nhappened to me in my past i don't have a\ntime machine maybe you do i can't go\nback and change what happened to me in\nmy past\nthat is one thing i'm sure of that can't\nchange it is a hundred percent true for\nyour past\nbecause there's nothing that you can do\nunless you happen to be in you know back\nto the future and you have the car you\nhave a delorean that'll take you back to\nthe back to the past right so\nno matter how mad i get no matter how\npissed no matter how much i cry about my\ncircumstances and judge myself for the\nway i act in the past and i wish that i\nwould have done it differently i cannot\nchange it and you can't change it either\nso\nhow many people\nlistening to this episode right now\nare carrying an underlying bit of anger\nfrustration worries sadness anxiety\naround something that happened to them\nin their past and they're ruining this\ncurrent beautiful present moment that\nwe're in by bringing a past moment into\na beautiful present moment\nyour worry your fear your anxiety your\nstress all of those crappy emotions will\nbe in direct proportion to the amount\nthat you're resisting the way that the\nworld is\nyour past happened and if you're anxious\nif you're worried if you're sad if\nyou're fearful it's usually because\nyou're thinking too much about something\nthat you can't change in the past or\nsomething that you can't change in the\npresent moment once again\ntoo many people are ruining a beautiful\npresent moment over something shitty\nthat happened to them in their past or\ntheir what they think could possibly\nhappen to them in the future which you\ncan't change the future as well so if\nyou can't change it why not just learn\nto love the present moment that you're\nin no matter the circumstances\nwouldn't it be nice just to be\ncalm and peaceful and loving as much as\nyou possibly can be\ni don't know about you but that sounds\nnice i would love to be calm and\npeaceful and loving as much as i\npossibly can\nbut if i'm resisting and resisting and\nresisting the past and oh man i should\nhave said that if i would have said that\nshe wouldn't have broken up with me and\nthis wouldn't have happened or the\npresent of oh this i'm in lock down and\ncoveted sucks and this thing and i'm\ntired of it i don't want to be this way\nanymore can't change that either or the\nfuture i can't change the future because\nthe future is not here\nthe only thing i can change is the way\nthat i think in this current moment and\nthe way that i feel in this current\nmoment and if i can master my reaction\nto the stimulus and the response\nthat little reactions on the inside i\ncan i can go okay before i respond\nlet me think about how i want to respond\nlet me take a let me take that little\ngap and make it just a little bit longer\nso that i can figure out what it is that\ni want\nand ask myself in this moment am i okay\nand 99.9 of the time when you ask\nyourself in this moment am i okay the\nanswer is yes\nokay that should calm me down a little\nbit i'm okay in this present moment\nokay next question\nin 10 years am i going to remember this\nmoment\nmost of the time what you're freaking\nout about you will not remember in 10\nyears why ruin a current beautiful\npresent moment with something that you\nwon't remember in 10 years at all you\nprobably won't even remember it next\nweek it's literally means that little\nthat you probably won't remember it last\nnext week but you're ruining a present\nmoment because of it\nyou have at this moment if you listen\nthis podcast\nif you're watching this on youtube or\nfacebook or instagram you have food\nwater shelter clothing and probably a\ncouple people that love you\nyou're good\nlike you're upset\njust let that click into your brain\nbecause our brains always go into\nsurvival survival survival something's\nwrong i've got to survive something's\nwrong i got to survive\nreset it take yourself out of that\nmoment you've got food water shelter\nclothing a couple people that love you\nat least\na couple people that support you you're\ngood\ntake this present moment find out what\nyou can enjoy with it enjoy with it and\nthen put on a calm song\nfind your song that's like your anxiety\nsong your frustration song your worry\nsong when those emotions and those\nfeelings come up go to that one song\nover and over again for me it's been the\nsame song for like\n13 years at this point the song is out\nof africa theme song it's just like this\nsong that chills me and it's i've been\ndoing it for so long\ni've basically trained my brain into\ncalming itself down when i put that song\non i used to when i had an office and\nhundreds of sales are up to work under\nme and she would hit the fan i would go\ninto my office i'd close the door and\ni'd put that song on and i'd just\ntake some deep breaths and within four\nminutes i was like a complete state\nchange\nso in this moment am i okay so i can't\nchange it right\nokay cool in this moment am i okay i am\nin 10 years am i going to remember this\nmoment i probably won't i have food i\nhave water i have shelter i have\nclothing i have a few people that love\nme and i'm gonna put on a song that's\ngonna call me and i'm gonna try to\nfigure out a way to change my response\nto my current circumstances so that i\ncan live in this beautiful moment and\nnot ruin it\nbecause everything in your life you can\nbarely control and if you can't control\nit you can't change it remind yourself\nof this episode remind yourself of these\nsteps find the song and change your\nstate into a beautiful state instead of\ngetting yourself into a state of\nsuffering it looks like the world's\ngoing to hell in a handbasket doesn't it\nit looks like there's just more\nuncertainty and more uncertainty and\nmore uncertainty and then the next week\nthere's another freaking thing that\nhappens and then after that thing's done\nthere's another freaking thing that\nhappens and then there's you know\nthere's covid that comes up and then\nthere's the delta vary and then there's\nstuff that's happening in afghanistan\nand i bet you next week there's going to\nbe another thing so there's a lot of\nthings that are happening i'm not trying\nto downplay any of these in any sort of\nway what i'm actually trying to do is\nmake it more\npeaceful inside of your brain and inside\nof your body so that no matter what\nhappens you\nare calm cool connected and you know\nwhat it is that you need to do so we're\ngoing to talk about how to create\ncertainty in your life and like i said\nwith all the stuff that's happening\nright now you know with with kovid\nhappening what seems like what are we at\nlike\n18 months in or something like that it\nfeels like i don't know it's a long time\nit's been right\nwho knows what's going to happen who\nknows if it's going to go away who knows\nif it's not going to go away who knows\nif it's going to continue to morph and\nchange who knows if it's going to\ndisappear i don't know i'm not a\nfreaking scientist and a lot of the\nscientists i don't think even know\nwhat's going on it's just everybody's\njust kind of uncertain with it right but\none thing that i am certain in is what\ni'm going to tell you about in just a\nlittle while when you look at all the\nthings that's happening over in the\nmiddle east it's a lot of uncertainty\nand you can look at it and it can make\nyou feel terrible and it can break your\nheart and that's not bad it's okay to\nhave your heart break for other people\nand to see things that are happening but\nthe thing that i come back to is that\npeople see keep saying well something\nkeeps happening something keeps\nhappening and something keeps happening\nit's like it never stops and i say can\nyou remember a time\nin your entire life where there wasn't\nsomething bad that was happening or\nwasn't something bad that was being put\non the news i can't remember anything\ni'm 35 years old i don't remember a time\nwhen i turned on the news and it was\nlike hey everything's amazing we have\nnothing to report today except for that\nthe dogs went out and played with their\ntoys i'm like holy sh today's amazing\nlike i've never seen that happen before\nright there's always something and guys\nthere's 7.5\nbillion people on this earth of course\nthere's going to be some crazy stuff\nthat happens but i am 100 sure of one\nthing there's a lot more good people in\nthis world than bad people i can't think\nof a time where there wasn't a lot of\nstuff that's ever happened that's been\nhappening but before we dive into the\nuncertainty and how to meet your\nuncertainty with\nabsolute certainty to calm yourself down\nto have the peace and the joy to be able\nto take the actions you need to to make\nyour life better but also make your\nfamily's life better your community's\nlife better and the world around you\nbetter as well before you dive into that\nit's a good thing to talk about you know\nwhat you consume and you've heard me\ntalk about this before if you've been\nlistening for a while\nbut if you're dealing with a lot of\nuncertainty and the uncertainty is\ngiving you anxiety and stress and it's\nkeeping you up at night\ni promise you one thing that you need to\ndo is stop watching the news because the\nnews is just going to keep putting up\nmore terrible things and more terrible\nthings and more terrible things and the\nnews is just they're just a couple\ncorporations that are owned by media\ncompanies and they can tell you whatever\nthe hell they want to tell you and they\ncan change it however they want to\nwhether it's on the left side whether\nit's on the right side whether it's in\nthe middle all of that stuff your life\nwill be better if you stop listening to\nnews your life will also be better if\nyou start unfollowing more people right\nif somebody's too political or\nsomebody's too doom and gloom or\nsomebody is if you look at somebody's\ninstagram story and it makes you feel\nworse unfollow that person now one thing\nthat i've been doing a lot over the past\ntwo weeks is unfollowing a ton of people\nbecause i just don't even want to deal\nwith it anymore and they're people that\ni'm pretty good friends with\ni see them pretty often some of them but\ni'm like nope your stories don't make me\nfeel better about my life\nyou gotta go\nright that's just the way that it is\nthat's okay there's nothing wrong with\nthat so you know before i dive into the\nuncertainty i just want you to to think\nabout the\nthe news and the politics and the doom\nand gloom and the people who you need to\nunfollow\nremove those things from your life and\nyour life will automatically\nyou'll find more peace automatically\nbecause you don't have those people\npulling at you and trying to pull your\nintention you need to have a peace\nfilter i like to call it i have a filter\nif you think about like you know\nwhenever you're making coffee right and\nyou have that filter it holds all of the\ncoffee the coffee grinds and it lets the\ncoffee and the water drip through i want\nto be like a filter like that and all\nthe coffee grinds are just all of the sh\nthat i don't need to be seeing because\nit's holding me back from creating the\nworld that i want to so you need to have\nsome sort of peace filter what does that\nlook like to you i don't know that's\nwhat you need to plan out so you can ask\nyourself a beautiful question you could\npause me now if you need to and answer\nit what does my peace filter look like\nwhat does it look like for me to create\nthat unfollow as many people as you can\ntake the tv off the wall do whatever it\nis that you need to to make there be\nmore peace in your life so the way to\nfind\nmore\ncertainty\nin this world\nis this now you need to\nmatch the uncertainty in the world with\ncertainty in yourself and you might be\nlike well no i need to take uncertainty\nand i need to match my uncertainty with\ncertainty and that will make me feel\nmore certain no crap that makes a whole\nlot of sense of course but i don't mean\nin the external world i mean internally\nyou know if you have\nstress\nand anxiety or just this\nheaviness or this pressure that you've\nbeen feeling over the past few months or\nyear or year and a half right if you\nhave those most of the time the reason\nwhy you have that stress while you have\nthe anxiety where you feel that weight\nis because you're focusing\nand thinking about things that you\ncannot control and this is very\nimportant because today we're going to\ntalk about what you can control versus\nwhat you can't control and so if you\nfeel a lot of stress and anxiety and\nworry it's because you're thinking about\nthings that you cannot control so if you\nlook at\ncovid for instance\nyou can't control coven i can't control\nit i can't control what it's doing i can\njust kind of\ndo my best as all of this stuff is\nhappening and i can take care of myself\nthat's the best that i can do at this\npoint i can't control it so it's going\nto do what it's going to do and i'm\ngoing to hope for the best\nyou can't control kovit so if you're\nfeeling stress and anxiety is it coming\nfrom that and what's happening in the\nworld\nyou also can't control other people are\nyou trying to control other people\nare you\non one side and you wish the people on\nthe other side would do something or are\nyou on the other side wishing the people\non the the other side of that would do\nsomething and you're just trying to\ncontrol people you will have stress and\nanxiety when you're focusing on trying\nto control things that you cannot\ncontrol\nthere's nothing you can do about it\nthere's nothing you could do about other\npeople there's nothing you could do\nabout kovac there is something that you\ncould do about yourself though and\nthat's where the certainty comes in\nanxiety comes from the future as well\nthinking about what the future could be\nthinking about how uncertain the future\nis thinking about the doom and gloom\nthat could be waiting for us in the\nfuture oh my god it could be so bad in\nthe future it could\nbut it's not here now so why am i making\nmy present moment that isn't bad bad\nbecause i'm focusing on a future moment\nthat might never even come to fruition\nthat's really crazy isn't it have you\never thought about that why am i ruining\na beautiful present moment by focusing\non a future that just might never happen\nand in fact there was a study that was\ndone and found out that 85\nof what humans worry about never happen\nlet me say that again 85 of what humans\nworry about never actually happen are\nyou focusing on things in the future\nthat might never happen of course that's\ngoing to cause you stress and worry and\nanxiety do you know why it's caused you\nstress worry and anxiety because the\nfuture is not here which means it is\nanother thing that you cannot control we\nget stressed and anxious and worried\nwhen we're focusing on things that we\ncannot control you can't control what's\ngoing on you can't control\nwhat happens tomorrow you can't control\nwhat happens in three months\nfor me i'll give you a perfect example\nmy girlfriend and i we have tickets\nwe've had tickets for three months now\nto go to italy for all of october it\nlooks like it might happen it might not\nhappen it went from definitely happening\nto about 50 50 with all of the changes i\ndon't know what's gonna happen and at\none point in time my girlfriend was\nstressing out about like oh my god i\nwant to go so bad i want to go so bad\nare we going to be able to go because\nusually we go for about a month every\nyear we obviously couldn't go last year\nour flights were canceled we had flights\nbooked for april obviously we couldn't\ntravel anywhere in april of 2020. so\nthen we pushed it back and we we started\nwe you know got tickets for october of\nlast year that didn't happen as well so\nnow we got tickets for this october it\nmight happen it might not and what i\nsaid to her is what's going to happen is\nwhat's going to happen\nwhy would i ruin my current moment right\nnow this beautiful day the sun shining\nand\nthere's not problems that are\nimmediately right here in my present\nmoment why would i ruin right now\nthinking about something that might or\nmight not happen in the future do i hope\nthat it happens yeah of course i hope\nthat it happens\nis there a possibility that might not\nyeah but\ni'm not the controller of the universe\ni'm not the person in charge of all of\nthese things that are happening all i\ncan do is i can control the way that i\nfeel right now we can focus on the\npresent moment and when we start to feel\nanxious and stressed and worried it's\nusually a fear\nmechanism that we have in our brain\nthere's some sort of fear something\nthere and we're worried about our safety\nin some sort of way a lot of times and\nso an easy way to help yourself when you\nnotice yourself start to flare up with\nstress and anxiety and worry is just ask\nyourself a very simple question just try\nthis out for a second with me if you've\nfelt stress and worried and anxious at\nall today ask yourself this question\nright now am i safe\nand think about that\nand let it sink in for a second and feel\nit in your body right now am i safe\nyou are\nright now there's nothing wrong in this\npresent moment there might be something\nin the future that could be wrong or\nmight be coming up you might be saying\nrob i have bills coming up that i have\nto pay next week and i'm not sure how\ni'm going to pay them you don't have to\npay them right now\nin this moment am i safe\nthe answer for all of you hopefully is\nyes and if i could come from a place of\ncertainty of who i am and how i can go\ninto the world and not uncertainty and\nnot based in fear or any stress or worry\nor anxiety i'm probably going to go out\nand take actions that are more in line\nwith being able to make the money to be\nable to cover my bills that are coming\nnext week so you've got to realize that\nthere's uncertainty in the future\nbecause we don't know what's going to\nhappen in the future but there's\ncertainty in ourselves and in this\npresent moment if you're stressed about\nthe present moment or the future you\ncan't control if you're stressed about\ncoving you can't control it you can't\ncontrol any of those things all you can\ndo is take care of yourself today if\nyou're stressed about covet you can't\ncontrol what's going to happen in the\nfuture what you can control is how you\ntake care of your body today i can\ncreate certainty in the way that i'm\ncaring for my body in fact i'm getting\nthe right amount of sleep i'm taking the\nright supplements that i'm getting the\nright amount of sun that i'm getting\neverything that i need to in order to if\ni do happen to get it hopefully battle\nit much better than if i wasn't taking\ncare of myself\nthat's something i could create\ncertainty in the workouts you do the\nfood you eat the supplements that you\ntake you know\neat healthy\nget movement get some sun on your skin\ndrink really high quality water get the\nthe you know the meditation in\nbreathe more deeper calm yourself get a\nlot of sleep meditate stop stressing so\nmuch take supplements that are going to\nhelp you that's something that is\ncertainty you can create certainty in\nthis current moment with the way that\nyou take care of yourself\nyou don't know what's going to happen in\nthe future that is going to create as\nmuch certainty as you possibly can right\nnow\nso what do you need to create certainty\nin\nif you've been feeling stress worry\nanxiety any of that what do you need to\ncreate more certainty in you can't\ncreate certainty in the future or what's\ngoing to happen with other people but\nyou can't create certainty in you in\nwhat you do right now if you're\nuncertain with your life path that's\nokay\nbut what you can be certain in is your\npersonal development i don't know what's\ngoing to happen in my future but i know\ni've been working on myself really hard\nfor a long time 16 years now and i have\na feeling that whatever bad could come\nto me in my future i'll be able to\novercome it much better than if i hadn't\nbeen working on myself for the last 16\nyears what about you\nhow's your personal development how's\nyour mental health how's your physical\nhealth\nthose are things that we can be certain\nin we can create certainty in those\nthings because we can control those\nthings your personal development your\nmindset in your health those are the\nfoundation\nto your life to the way that you go out\ninto the world for me\ni want to prepare my mind my body\neverything as if there's a possible war\nnot physical war but actually like\nmental war that's coming up into the\nfuture and i want to be as prepared as\npossible if you knew that you absolutely\nhad to go into fight somebody inside of\na cage in six months and there's no way\nout of it\nwould you just let it happen and just\nwait till the day comes or would you go\nwell if i have to do it i'm going to\nfreaking train anyways even if i've\nnever trained before i'm going to train\nwhy because i can create certainty that\ni've showed up as much as i possibly\ncould by the time i get into that ring\nthat's the way that i prep for life you\nknow it's like david goggins a lot of\npeople make fun of david giggins for how\ncrazy he is and he is quite crazy he's\nreally really hardcore but when people\nsay hey why do you put yourself through\nso much hell why do you push yourself so\nmuch why do you you know run 200 miles\non a weekend when you literally could\njust sit and watch tv the entire time he\nsays he's preparing for life he's\npreparing for what could come up he's\npreparing for\na possible 4 a.m phone call in the\nmiddle of the night where they say his\nmother's dead and how he's going to\novercome that mentally and he knows that\nif he pushes himself now and pushes\nhimself and push himself now the better\nhe'll be able to handle that whenever\nthat potential thing does come up in the\nfuture you know so you can make yourself\nstronger right now mentally physically\nemotionally spiritually by the work that\nyou put into yourself that is what that\nis the only thing that you can really be\ncertain in so there's a lot of\nuncertainty externally in the world\ni don't think that we're going to get to\nthe end of your life and have\nany less uncertainty that we currently\nhave it's just going to keep we're\nalways going to have uncertainty i feel\nlike there's always been uncertainty\nexternal\nthat's always going to be uncertain\nbecause you can't control anything\nexternal but internal what can you\ncontrol what can you create more\ncertainty in what is your life\nwhere in your life is there calling for\nyou to be
