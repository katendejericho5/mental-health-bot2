    "transcript": "success is the freedom to do what you\nwant when you want with who you want i\nknow there's a lot of people that listen\nto this and you stop short just a little\nbit short of your goals before you\nactually get there in 10 years 10 years\nfrom today\nyou will have a life that you absolutely\nlove like the perfect life\nhow to break free from what a normal\nlife is the normal life that you have\nand freedom is interesting and the\nreason why is because\ni don't think that people prioritize\ntheir freedom as much as they need to\nright people will prioritize making\nmoney\nbut they won't prioritize their freedom\nand do you want to know a little secret\nif you want to make more money\nif you want to make more money the thing\nthat you actually want\nis not the money the money is actually\nnot your main goal you think that it's\nyour main goal\nsure you know the money can buy you the\nhouse that you want it can buy the car\nthat you want the trips around the world\nit can buy you pretty much anything that\nyou want a lot of times it can buy you\nthose things but you're not actually\ntrying to accumulate assets or things\nthat are expenses what you're actually\ntrying to do is you're wanting the thing\nthat you think that money will give you\nright and what is that freedom\nfreedom is what we're all searching for\nright and\nsuccess means something different to\nevery single person but for me when\nsomeone says like like first off if\nyou're wanting to be successful\nsuccessful is just a very relative term\nso you've got to define what success\nmeans to you maybe to you success means\nmaking 10 million dollars maybe success\nmeans to you having an incredible family\nmaybe success means to you that you can\nyou know own a t-rex skeleton and put it\ninside your house i don't know what the\nhell success means to you but it's\ndifferent for everybody success to me\nthough and when i usually say this\npeople are like oof yeah actually that\nis my definition of success as well\nsuccess is the freedom to do what you\nwant when you want with who you want\nthat's it\nsuccess is the freedom to do what you\nwant when you want with who you want\nsure you want money\nbut what you actually want is the\nfreedom\nto be able to take that weekend trip\nwith your friends and not have to worry\nabout you know paying rent\nwhat you want you sure you want to make\nmoney but what you really want is the\nthe freedom of the from the burden of\nworrying about not being able to pay\nyour bills\nyou want the freedom to walk into a\nplace not have to care about the tag and\nwhat it says and just be able to buy\nsomething that you want what you're\nactually searching for i don't think\nanybody really knows this most of the\ntime is when you want to make money what\nyou want is freedom you want freedom\naway from uh to be able to get whatever\nyou want you want freedom to do whatever\nyou want you want freedom to be able to\ntravel when you want you want freedom to\nhang out with who you want and you also\nwant freedom\nfrom the mental burden\nthat not having enough money or possibly\nrunning out of money gives you\nbut\ndo you want to know a secret about\nfreedom\ni'm gonna tell you something that i've\nnever heard anybody talk about before\nyour freedom\ncomes from your discipline\nright now you might be thinking about\nthis and when you think of the\nconnotation of discipline when you think\nabout it usually discipline is like a\nbad word like to be disciplined\nas a child means that you did something\nwrong so to discipline yourself\nseems like it's got a bad connotation\nmost people would think that the\nopposite of freedom would be disciplined\nbecause if you're like i'm free i don't\nneed discipline discipline\nwhen when i think of the word of what\nmost people think of of of discipline\nitself it seems restrictive right it\nseems like you're stuck in some sort of\nway but freedom the freedom that you\nwant\nis inside of the discipline and the\nstructure that you don't currently have\nin your life\nright now you're gonna sit there and be\nlike that doesn't sound right at all\nlike freedom\nseems like there'd be no discipline\nfreedom seems like there'd be no\nstructure and i get it\nbut there's a couple different ways\nwhere this works right\nwhen you have discipline and when you\nhave structure in your life it creates\nfreedom later on down the road so we're\ngoing to talk about a couple different\naspects of freedom we're going to talk\nabout a couple of different aspects of\nof discipline and also a couple\ndifferent aspects of just structure\nitself\nwhen you have discipline in your life\nwhen you have structure in your life it\ncreates freedom later on down the road\nright the freedom once again to do what\nyou want when you want with who you want\ndiscipline and structure also create\nfreedom in the moment\nyou'll be like i don't know how that\nworks well let me explain that okay so\nfirst off we're talking about the future\nright\num when you're talking about the future\nthat you want\nin order to get that future i'm\npromising you this unless you happen to\nhit the lottery in order if you want to\nhave the freedom to do what you want\nwhen you want with who you want there's\ngoing to have to be structure and\nthere's going to be have to be\ndiscipline unless once again you happen\nto hit the lottery if you hit the\nlottery then you that's just a fluke you\nended up hitting the lottery but that's\nlike a 1 in 22 million chance at the\nlottery anyways right\nin order to create the freedom that you\nwant you're going to need discipline in\nyour life and you're going to need\nstructure so you're going to need that\nand not automatically for a lot of\npeople i already know how you're feeling\nit feels restrictive but i'm going to\ntell you why it's not ok\nmost people when you think of freedom\nthough you're thinking well\nmy freedom that i want is just the\nfreedom to just hang out and just be\nable to you know sit on the couch and\neat what i want\ni promise you\nin the grand\nscheme of your life and the potential\nthat you have that's not actually what\nyou're searching for you're searching\nfor much much more than that much much\nmore of a beautiful thing but\nif you can wake up\nand you can have no schedule\nthat's freedom\nbut you can't wake up right now most\nlikely and just have nothing that you\nneed to do because your life might not\nbe at the point where you can do nothing\nbecause there's a pretty good chance\nthat if you were at that point where you\ncould just do whatever the hell you want\nyou probably wouldn't be listening to me\nright\nand\nto wake up and have no schedule there's\nfreedom in that\nbut that can also really stress people\nout there's a reason why people who\nretire\nend up going back and working again\nwithin 90 days is because most people\nlike the the inherent feeling in a human\nis to be\nproductive to have progress in your life\nas tony robbins says progress equals\nhappiness so to think that you would\njust wake up and just lollygag all day\nlong and that would bring you happiness\nis probably not going to happen right\nyou feel like you should be doing more\nright you're searching for what you\nshould do to fill that time knowing that\nthere's more for you\nbut when you have structure and you have\ndiscipline there's the freedom inside of\nthat structure so it\nmost people think i want the freedom to\njust wake up and if i didn't have\nanything to do today oh my gosh i would\nfeel so free i promise you this after a\nwhile it gets really boring and you're\nnot going to want to do that but when\nyou wake up and you've got\na plan in place like today i was back to\nback to back to back to back\non calls on recording on planning\npodcast episodes and getting all this\nstuff done i've been back to back i've\nalready had you know what are we we're\nat two o'clock i've already had four\nphone calls and we've recorded three\npodcast episodes right so there's\nbut the beautiful thing about it is in\nthat structure in the discipline of\ngetting those things done\nthere's a whole lot of freedom so i woke\nup and i had a team call at 7 am for me\nright i had a team call with my team\nyou might be like oh man wake up and be\non a call at 7am that feels restrictive\nbut for me when i wake up on a call and\ni'm running a team call with my entire\nteam there there's so much freedom in\nthat for me because i can move and shift\nand do what i want and show up as the\nversion of me why because i'm not\nstressing about what i need to do\nbecause i've got it in the schedule\nright then i woke up then after that i\nhad another meeting\ni'm in the middle of writing a book so\nwe have book pitches next month next\nweek excuse me where i'm meeting with\nseven different publishers next week so\ni was on the call\nwith uh for an hour with my book agent\nand in that time of going over\neverything for me there was a lot of\nfreedom because i was able to to figure\nout how i want to pitch it how i want to\ntalk about it what i'm going to say to\nthese people how i'm going to come up\nwith a marketing plan and for me\nthere's freedom in that because i can\ncome up with whatever it is that i want\nto right so there's actual freedom\ninside of my structure then you know\nsitting here recording these podcast\nepisodes and you know i've usually\nrecord three to four episodes at one\ntime so we just sit here and we just\nbatch them and get them all done there's\nfreedom i know what i'm gonna say to you\nguys i have bullet points but at the\nsame time there's also a lot of stuff\nthat comes out of me that just isn't on\nthere there's freedom in that and so and\ni had this conversation with one of my\nsales reps and he was like he's a very\nmuch like his personality is an\ninnovator he loves to innovate and do\nthings differently and i said what you\nhave to realize is within the structure\nof doing the same things and having some\nphone calls that are very similar is\nthere's so much freedom in it the\nproblem is here it is you're not\nsearching for the freedom you're\nsearching for the restrictiveness in it\nright of of waking up and having to do\nthat what feels like the same thing but\ni was like every person that you talk to\nis different and if you search\nfor the difference in each person and\nthe difference in this conversation\nperiod of this conversation you'll find\nit in the innovator inside of you that\ninnovator that's inside of you is going\nto come alive because each person's\ndifferent and inside of that structure\nthat you have inside of the discipline\nis the freedom\nright now now these he's locked in he's\nbeen doing this for a while he agrees\nand what's cool about is when he is\ndisciplined and structured from monday\nto friday saturday and sunday\nhe's free he makes great money he can do\nwhatever he wants and he has fun in\nthose times and to be able to make good\nmoney monday through friday affords him\nto be able to do whatever the hell he\nwants to on the weekends and that in\nitself\nis freedom\nright and people so that's that's the\nfreedom in the moment right now let's\ntalk about the freedom that the future\ncan bring you from having discipline and\nhaving structure right so people\nunderestimate severely underestimate\nwhat locking down for a couple years can\ndo for your future\nright\nas tony robbins says one of my favorite\nquotes because the the longer i run my\nbusiness and the older i get the more it\ngets true\npeople under people overestimate what\nthey can do in a year but they\nunderestimated they could do in a decade\nand i will even take that and say they\nunderestimated they could do in five\nyears so people think that you know oh\ni'm going to start this business it's\ngoing to be a massive success i'm going\nto sell you know millions of t-shirts or\ni'm going to sell millions of records\ni'm going to sell millions of these\nthings i'm going to make so much money\nand then within three months they're\nbarely making any money and they might\neven be losing money\nand they're like i don't know if this is\nfor me you're most likely if you're 99\nof business owners you're not going to\nsee much success in the first three\nmonths but if you keep going and going\ngoing you have the discipline\nto actually force yourself to show up\nevery single day and you have the\nstructure of knowing what it is that\nyou're going to be doing every single\nday and what is it you need to do\nbecause you've actually come up with a\nplan to execute on that plan\nand you do it and you do it and you do\nit for long enough a couple years\nguess what you're gonna have a\ncompletely different life i can't tell\nyou how many people i've seen their\nlives change they started a business\ntoday and then three years down the road\ntheir life is in a completely different\nplace why because success takes time\nand once that time has passed and\nthey've been working and they've been\ndisciplined they've been waking up early\nthey've been putting structure inside of\ntheir life they've been acting like they\ndon't just work for themselves but\nthey've been acting like a business\nperson and that they have an actual\nbusiness that business actually starts\nto pay them like a business because\nthey're not treating it like a hobby\nanymore right if you treat your business\nlike a hobby you're going to get paid\nlike a hobby if you treat your business\nlike a business you're eventually going\nto get paid like a business right so\nwhen i say freedom\ncomes from the structure in the\ndiscipline one thing like a perfect\nexample for someone who's a business\nowner or a solo entrepreneur or\nsolopreneur one thing that i always say\nto them is like when you wake up in the\nmorning force yourself to have a morning\nroutine force yourself to go through the\nmorning routine and then when you're\ndone with that morning routine what do i\nwant you to force yourself to do take a\nshower\nget dressed as if you're going to go to\nwork like if you're going to go to work\nlike if you had a nine-to-five job\nyou're gonna take a shower hopefully\nyou're gonna take a shower you're gonna\ntake a shower you're gonna get dressed\nyou're going to make yourself\npresentable to go out into the real\nworld\ndon't just\nwalk around your house in your your\nunderwear or your robe and try to work\nbecause mentally that's not the same the\nstructure and the discipline of waking\nup and making yourself shower and making\nyourself go through your morning routine\nand going through your morning routine\nand then shower and then getting dressed\nmakes you have the freedom later on down\nthe road to create the life that you\nwant right i also say to people like\nhave working hours if you're an\nentrepreneur and you're working from\nhome you have to have working hours\nbecause when you work from home a lot of\ntimes people will try to\nimpede on that that working from home\nand your mom will call you be like honey\ni need you to go pick up some some\nlaundry for me and you're like oh god i\nlove my mom and i know she can't go get\nit right all right i'll go get it and so\nyour mom wouldn't call you if you worked\non nine to five and ask you to to go\npick up a freaking laundry right she'd\nbe like hey can you pick up after work\nyeah of course you can so you have to\nhave working hours and what happens is\nby having those working hours you're\ncreating structure and if you have the\ndiscipline to actually make sure that\nyou have those things done you get get\nthings done the way that you're supposed\nto you're creating discipline you're\ncreating structure and in turn creating\nmore freedom in your life down the road\nand so there's freedom inside of the\nstructure that you currently have and\nyou can always find it if you're\nsearching for it and you can have fun\nwith it if you're searching for it\nand on the other side of that if you\nreally lock down for a couple years if\nyou know what it is that you want to do\nyou know exactly what it is that the\nlife that you want and you're like you\nknow what i'm gonna put some structure\nin my life i'm gonna actually start to\nplan out my day every single day i'm\ngonna have the discipline to wake up\nevery single day to go through my\nmorning routine to shower to get dressed\nas if i'm leaving to go to work to maybe\ngo to a coffee shop and work there so\nthat i feel like there's a difference\nbetween working at my house and working\nat a different place and that's more my\nyou know where my office is the coffee\nshop right whatever it is for you of\nhaving the structure and the discipline\nin place and having the discipline and\nmake sure that you do those things and\nto do it day in day out day in day out\nday in day out for years\nlocking down for a couple years once\nagain is severely underestimated for the\nfuture that it could create for you\nseverely underestimated and here's the\nthing that i always say to people\neverybody wants to make lots of money\ncool would be great to make 100 200 300\n000 in your business 500 000 a million\nand are some of you going to do that\nabsolutely right\nbut\nif you're working a nine to five right\nnow and you're getting paid eighty\nthousand dollars a year at your nine to\nfive\nand you leave that nine to five to go do\nthe one thing it is that you're truly\npassionate about whatever that thing is\nthat you're passionate about and you put\nwork into it you put work into it day in\nday out day in day out i guarantee you\nyou can eventually get yourself to 80\n000 a year doing that thing that you're\npassionate about\nhow much more freedom does that create\nfor you when you've built your own\nbusiness paying you the same that you\nwere making before\nand here's what's beautiful if you\nreally put a lot of effort into it what\nyou're going to find out\nis it eventually going to build it to\nmake you way more money than what you\ndid in the past freedom\nis what you're searching for and freedom\ncomes from your discipline\nand it comes from structure habits are\nvery important i'll say this before\nbefore i talk about habits they're\nimportant but they're not the most\nimportant thing\npeople don't talk enough about the\nstandards that people hold themselves to\nand if you can understand this and you\ncan hold yourself accountable to the\nlevel that you really want to hold\nyourself accountable in the level that\nyou need to be in order to create the\nlife that you want you will create that\nlife\nhabits are important but habits are the\nchildren of standards standards are way\nmore important and so\nif you can learn to hold yourself to a\nhigher standard then you'll have to\nforce yourself to grow and if you grow\nyou'll create an amazing life and in\nthis episode i'm going to give you tips\non exactly how to do so but first off\nlet's get really clear on what a\nstandard is because sometimes people\nlike to ask that standards in the\nsimplest form the way i like to explain\nit are what you deem acceptable and\nfully unacceptable in your life and\nthese are levels that you will not let\nyourself drop below at all ever you\nwon't let yourself drop below the\nstandard and your standards are attached\nto your identity in what you think about\nyourself right so you know when you look\nat your body there's a pretty good\nchance that for most people listening\nyour body has been\nvery similar for the past two three four\nfive ten years for some of you even\nlonger right that's because that's the\nstandard that you're holding yourself to\nyou won't let yourself go any lower but\nyou're probably also not going any\nfurther in getting any better in a lot\nof cases you might be in some cases but\nthis is the reason why people can lose a\nbunch of weight and then they can go\nright back to gaining all the weight\nback just standards that they have\nif you look at your bank account you\nprobably have around the same amount\nthat you have for years right tends to\nbe very common if you seeing five\nthousand dollars in your bank account\nyou've probably had around five thousand\ndollars in your bank account for years\nand years why because it's simply just a\nstandard and if some big bill comes in\nand you have to pay that bill and let's\nsay your bank account goes from five\nthousand to four thousand well the\nstandard is that you're used to seeing\nfive thousand so that's when you'll\nyou'll buckle up you won't go out to\neach you won't see your friends you\nwon't go to the movies you won't spend\nany extra money until you feel safe and\nat that same part the same place that\nyou're normally at right so your life\nwhere it currently is is because of your\nstandards how you look how your body\nlooks where your business is at where\nyour bank account is at where your\nfriendships is at where friendships are\nat where your relationships are at where\nyour\nmarriage is at where your relationship\nwith your kids is at\nthe cleanliness of your house everything\ncomes down to the standards that you\nhold yourself to and a standard is\nsomething that you will not drop below\nbut\nthe thing about that is that's basically\nlike the ground floor\nwhich means there's always levels above\nit and those levels above it in order\nfor you to go from ground floor to the\nnext floor you're gonna have to raise\nyour standards in some way so i'll give\nyou a quick example\nif we're talking about not falling below\nany standards let's go really drastic\ni'm assuming that most people listening\nto this podcast right now you're\nprobably not going to get done listening\nto this podcast and then go shoot up\nsome black tar heroine right why\ni would assume that for most people\nlistening to a motivational podcast and\na mindset podcast and trying to improve\nhimself and get into personal\ndevelopment and growth\nyou're probably not shooting up black\ntar heroine on the weekends right\nthe reason why is because that's\nprobably below your standards\nnow what's the difference between that\nand the people out there that are\nlistening that you don't shoot black tar\nheroine but\nyou tend to stop really short of your\ngoals before you ever hit them\nright i know there's a lot of people\nthat listen to this and you stop short\njust a little bit short of your goals\nbefore you actually get there\nthat means that it's it's a standard for\nyou to not hit your goals what if your\nstandard was hey i'm not going to ever\nstop until i hit my goal right or giving\nup short on yourself giving up just a\nlittle bit too early how common it's so\ncommon for me when i work with people to\nhear how many people get really excited\nabout something some goal some new\nyear's resolution and then they give up\nin the middle of it and they're done\nwith it right\nhow about this\nis it your standard to wake up the very\nfirst time your alarm goes off or do you\nhit snooze three times before waking up\nsee that's a standard you have the\nstandard of when my alarm gets up goes\noff my ass gets out of my bed and i do\nnot go back in that is a standard right\npeople love to focus on habits and like\ni said those are important but your\nhabits are just the offspring of your\nstandards so if you have a habit of\nwaking up and having a morning routine\nit's because your standards are i will\nwake up at 6 00 a.m or 5 a.m i will get\nout of my bed the first time the alarm\ngoes off and i will not let myself go\nback to sleep that is a standard in the\nhabit of the morning routine is an\noffspring of that standard right it\nmakes sense i don't know why nobody\ntalks about this\nbecause your standards are actually more\nimportant than your habits your\nstandards create your habits so\ni'll give you a couple of examples\npeople want to wake up and have a\nmorning routine like we're talking about\nthey want that to be a habit of theirs\nbut they don't have the standard of\nwaking up when the alarm goes off they\ndon't have the standard of going to bed\nearly they don't have the standard of\ndoing what they say they're going to do\nthey don't have the standard of\nprioritizing their sleep they don't have\nthe standard of making sure everything\nin the morning is ready for the morning\nbefore they go to bed there are\nstandards that assist in making sure\nthat those habits are executed correctly\nand so what are your standards and where\ndo you need to improve them right you\nwon't go and shoot heroin but you will\nstruggle getting yourself out of bed in\nthe morning why standards it's all\nstandards\nright you have to and here's the\ninteresting thing and this is going to\nsound very drastic to most of you but\nwhen you get it you'll get it\nas drastic as it seems of like i would\nnever\nshoot heroin right like if you think\nthat to yourself like i would never\nshoot heroin\nthe mental the same mental disgust that\nyou have towards shooting heroin you\nshould have towards sleeping in\nthat's a standard and that's what i'm\ntalking about now you might be sitting\nthere going well that's pretty damn\ndrastic rob uh shooting heroin sleeping\nin those are not the same thing i know\nthey're not the same thing but can you\nmake them the mental equivalent where\nit's like i do not sleep in there is no\nway on god's green earth that i freaking\nsleep in at any point in time i get up\nwhen my alarm goes off because that's\nwhat i'm supposed to do the same way\nthat there's no way on god's green earth\nthat i'm going to take heroin and shoot\nit into my arms right the same way there\nneeds to be a a rock bottom for you\nright shooting heroin would be rock\nbottom not\nnot actually waking up and having your\nmorning routine and the habits and\nexecuting the weight you want to should\nbe a rock bottom for you\nso let's give another example look at\nyour body\nis your body right now your dream body\nor could it be better\nwell\nit is what it is because of your\nstandards\nright\nwhat about the food that you eat do you\neat fast food do you eat greasy food\nwings pizza all of that is a standard\nthat you're sticking to do you eat food\nthat's\nyou know if if you were to be taking\nyour food out right and you drop your\nfood in the parking lot\nand it falls on the concrete are you\ngoing to pick it up and eat it after it\nfalls in the parking lot that everyone's\nbeen walking over and car's been going\nand birds have been on right probably\nnot why because eating food off of a\nparking lot is probably below your\nstandards but eating mcdonald's when you\nknow that you shouldn't isn't below your\nstandards\nright you see how these correlate\nthe same way that you wouldn't eat food\noff the floor should be there's no way\ni'm gonna eat some freaking mcdonald's\nthere's no way i'm gonna eat this greasy\nfood because i know when i do it's\nnumber one it's gonna make me fatter\nnumber two it's gonna make me tired\nnumber three i'm not gonna feel good\nnumber four i'm probably probably gonna\nfart a lot right my wife isn't gonna\ndoesn't love isn't gonna love that\nthere's standards you have to hold\nyourself to so that eating mcdonald's\nneeds to be the mental equivalent of\neating food off of the ground\nright look at your body again how often\ndo you work out\nhow many times a week do you work out\nper week\nwhat's your that what's your personal\nstandard what is it\nyou know i know people work out twice a\nday i also know people who haven't\nworked out in 10 years what's the\ndifference standards the standards that\nsomeone's going to hold themselves to\nand the level they will they will not\ndrop below\nif you want to know how to change your\nbody\nwhat do you need to change your\nstandards change your workout standards\nchange your lifestyle standards change\nyour mental standards how hard you go to\nthe gym because you could show up at the\ngym and you could you know walk on the\ntreadmill at you know slow pace for an\nhour if you want to or you can go in\nthere and have that mental standard of\nlike i'm going to work my ass off i'm\nnot going to leave until i burn 500\ncalories according my apple watch\nwhatever it is you live and die by your\nstandards\nright they make the life that you have\ncurrently they have all of your\nstandards a cumulative effect of your\nstandards and your past standards and\nyour current standards have given you\nthe life that you currently have\nthat's the truth\nbut those standards are not going to get\nyou the life that you want\nso the only difference between you now\nin this moment listening to those\npodcasts or watching this podcast the\nonly difference between you now and you\nin 10 years and having the perfect life\nand the perfect body and all the money\nyour bank account and the love and the\nhappiness and the success and the\ntraveling whatever it is that you want\nthe only difference between you now and\nthat version of you\nis that the two versions have two\ndifferent levels of standards there's\nyou now and there's a perfect you\nand the you that's the perfect you has\nfully maxed out their true potential and\nnot wasted their true potential and they\nhave fully decided to step into having\nthe highest standards that they possibly\ncan\nand this is everything in your life you\nhave standards for every single thing\nthat you do in your life all of your\ngoals do you come up short to your goals\ndo you give up too often\nyou know do not or do you not stop until\nthe goal is hit no matter how long it\ntakes right\ncome up short give up\ndon't quit no matter what\nwhat's the difference the standards\nright what about the relationships that\nyou have\ndo you cheat on your significant other\nor do you have a date night every single\nweek\nright do you turn off your phone at 7\np.m so it's you know just enough time\nfor the two of you to hang out\nthe difference is standards cheating on\nsomebody is one standard and you are\nlike well i'm okay with doing that\nthat that thing cheating on somebody or\ni will turn off my phone at 7 pm every\nsingle day so that i can have some time\nwith my significant other that's\nuninterrupted and you know what i'm also\ngoing to take her on a date every single\nweek\ndifference between the two of those\nthey're vastly different the standards\nthat i'm willing to hold myself to\nstandards that you're willing to hold\nyourself to right what about your family\ndo you have a standard of you know hey i\ndo work so hard that i usually miss\ndinner with my wife and kids\nor do you have the standard of i\ndisconnect at 6 pm no matter what so\nthat i can be a fully present parent\nbecause being a present parent matters\nmore than all of the money that i can\nmake\nwhat's the difference standards\nyour body do you work out every single\nday\ndo you follow a healthy lifestyle do you\neat a lot of fast food do you skip\nworkouts often what's the difference\nbetween those two scenarios\nstandards what about your bank account\nright you have a lot of standards for\nhow much that you make\nhow much you save how much you spend if\nyou're a saver that's a standard if\nyou're someone who spends a lot of money\nyou're not really good at saving money\nthat's a standard all of these things\ncan be changed at any point in time look\nat your work look at your career look at\nyour business\nall of that is a standard if you have a\nbusiness and you have people that work\nfor you in your business and there you\nfeel like they're lazy that's a standard\nbecause you don't hold them to a high\nenough standard and usually that means\nthat you're not holding yourself to a\nhigh enough standard\nif you want people who work really hard\nyou better be the one that's working\nreally hard first\nright people follow leaders\nare you a good leader right what about\nyour personal growth are you reading\noften\nare you skipping it\nare you telling yourself that you're\nyou're growing when in reality or not\nwhat is it all of them have to do with\nstandards the way you do one thing is\nthe way you do everything right there's\nno way that you're slipping on standards\nin your relationship\nand\ncheating\nbut you happen to be having this\nbusiness is crushing it no if you're\nslipping in one area of your life i\nguarantee you we can identify all of the\ndifferent areas of your life where you\nhappen to be you happen to be you know\ncheating and having low standards the\nway you do one thing is the way you do\neverything you live and die by your\nstandards\nthey make the life that you have\nthey will create the life that you want\nso the only difference once again\nbetween you\nnow and you in 10 years\nin the perfect life that you want is the\nstand that you hold yourself to so take\na quick\nlook around your life and start thinking\nto yourself what are the standards that\ni typically hold myself to\nwhat are the standards that are are\ngreat standards what are the standards\nthat i need to keep okay i'm really good\nat going to the gym let's say you're\ngood at going to the gym\ni'm not the best at eating healthy\nthough and i know that if i really want\nto get the body that i want\nwell i'm probably going to have to start\neating better okay so now i've noticed\nwhere i do well i've also noticed some\nplace where i need my standards to be\nbetter so about you what are places\nwhere your standards are good and you\nwould like to keep those what are places\nin your life where standards are not\nwhere they should be and you want to\nimprove those\nmaybe you have the standard of oh man my\nrelationship with my wife is doing great\nwe're doing good\nbut\nyou know what i'm missing my morning\nroutine almost every single morning\nyou want to miss my morning routine it\nstresses me out a little bit because i\nfeel like i could have done better i\nfeel like it was something that i needed\nyou know what i'm going to have to go\nahead and figure out you know how to\nmake my morning routine be better\nhow to make sure that i show up and if\ni'm missing my morning routine there's\nonce again when you do one thing as we\ndo everything there's probably other\nplaces that i could make my relationship\nbetter with my wife where i could make\nmy relationship better with my kids\nwhere i could show up as a better leader\nin my business the way you do one thing\nis the way you do everything so there's\nalways going to be other places so take\na look around you and start seeing where\nyou have good standards and where you\nhave standards that need to be improved\nand if you look at yourself in 10 years\nin the perfect life that you could have\nbecause it is\nout there for everybody and you look at\nthat life ask yourself what type of\nstandards would that person hold\nthemselves to\nright\nand\nrealize that when you truly level up all\nof your standards you're pulling your\ntrue potential out of yourself and your\nhabits will be created from that and for\nme personally\nthe way i see everything is i see life\nas this big game i feel like it's a game\ni'm just playing this game in every game\nthere's just a new level right there's\njust new levels that you get to and with\nthe new levels there's always new\nchallenges and i see everything as life\nas just a test to see how i'm going to\nshow up as if god or the universe or\nwhatever it is that you believe in is\nwatching me at all points in time and if\ni have low standards and you know let's\nsay god's watching down on me the\nuniverse is looking at me and i have low\nstandards as to sleeping in not holding\nmyself to a high state or not showing up\nin my relationships all of this stuff\ni'm going to stay where i am why\nwould anybody reward me with anything\ngreat\nfor not doing anything great\nright it's like you don't play could you\nimagine how boring a video game would be\nif you didn't have to accomplish\nanything but you were just rewarded with\ngold coins for just kind of doing\nnothing and\nyou know meandering all over the place\nno you've got to accomplish something\nright but if i hold myself to a high\nstandard\nhuh that's interesting because the\nuniverse tends to reward me every single\ntime i reward my i hold myself to a high\nstandard if i push myself without\nanybody else needing to push me if i\ntreat people the way that people should\nbe treated if i show up for people the\nway that i should show up for people if\ni work harder than anybody else if i\nmentally take care of myself and build\nmyself up it's like the universe just\ngives me gifts it's like the gold coins\njust start falling from the sky\nright but it all comes down to the\nstandards of what i deem acceptable and\nwhat standards i'm going to hold myself\nto so if you're out there and you don't\nhave the life you want currently like\nyou could have a great life and most\npeople listening probably have a great\nlife right it's good but you know that\nthere's more inside of you that more\ninside of you is going to take a shift\nin your standards not shifting your\nstandards is going to change your habits\nand the change of your habits and your\nactions is what's going to change your\nlife\nit's a top-down effect standards to\nhabits to actions that's what you need\nto focus on so as you're looking at your\nlife ask yourself once again\nthis life i have right now the standards\nthat i'm holding myself to where do i\nneed to hold myself to a higher standard\nand how should i pay attention to myself\nat a deep level become very self-aware\nif my standards happen to dip so that i\ncan make sure i pull myself back up and\nnot allow myself to dip below because\nthe only difference between you and the\nlife that you want\nis the standards that you hold yourself\nto\nit seems obvious that every single\nperson should want to build a life that\nthey love right\nso many so many people should every\nsingle person not even so many every\nsingle person should be building a life\nthat they absolutely love they don't\nwant to try to escape from but if that's\nthe case why do so many people not love\ntheir lives\nbecause if i look around and the people\nthat i've coached the people i talk to\nit seems like most people are slightly\ncontent with their life\nand sometimes maybe even a little bit\nagitated with their lives and then some\npeople\nkind of hate their lives but very rarely\ndo i meet someone who's like absolutely\nin love with every aspect of their life\nand so i want to ask you before we dive\nin do you love your life like do you\nlove every single aspect of your life\nor are there certain pieces of your life\nor many pieces of your life you're like\nyeah i don't\ni don't really like that i don't really\nlike that that job that i have that\nperson to my life i don't like any of\nthat because for me personally i think\nthat i should be and i think that you\nshould be\nbuilding a life that i'm in love with in\nevery single aspect i think you should\nbe building a life that you're in love\nwith in every single aspect and there\nshouldn't be\nany pieces of your life to be honest\nwith you that you don't love and i don't\nknow about you but i want to be working\ntowards building a life that i love\nevery single day now are there pieces\nthat i still want to change around a\nlittle bit absolutely but over the past\n14 years i feel like i've been pulling\nout the weeds the things that i don't\nwant in my life and replanting flowers\nin places of all of those weeds so if\nyour life was a garden\nyou know and you're looking at it would\nyou see more flowers in your life or\nwould you see more weeds in your life\nand if you see more weeds what are you\ngonna do to go through and actually\nstart to pull them because there's\nnobody else that can pull those weeds\nwhether that's the job that you have the\nfamily the people that you surround\nyourself with the person you're in a\nrelationship with all of those things\ncan either be flowers or weeds and you\nneed to go through and take an actual\nassessment and figure out exactly what\nit is that you want in your life and how\nyou need to get each of those things as\nwell and um i'm going to say something i\nthink that that that might kind of\nsurprise a lot of people\nlike have waking up one day and having a\nlife that you want in love is not going\nto happen\na life that you actually love\nis built\nit's something that you have to put a\nlot of intention into it's built\nintentionally and it's built\nmeticulously like going through every\nsingle aspect of every single day and\ngoing do i want to keep this here or do\ni want to get rid of it a perfect life\nis built it's not like you just wake up\none day and go holy this is perfect i'm\nso glad that i somehow just absolutely\nlanded somehow on this perfect life no\nyou have to plan it you have to plan it\nyou have to check it you have to check\nit every single week check it every\nsingle day and you have to execute on\neverything that you want in your life\neverything in your life though is\nchangeable that's what's beautiful\nbecause one of the things that really\nholds people back from building the life\nthey love is that they feel like they're\nstuck in the life that they have and if\nyou feel like you're stuck in your\ncurrent life then mentally it's gonna\nseem really hard for you to build a life\nthat you love it's gonna seem like it's\nnear impossible it's gonna seem like\nwell\ni guess i'm just not gonna get it this\nlife i guess i'm not gonna get it this\nthis round and you've heard me talk\nabout a friend of mine who was the\nnumber 30 employee in facebook and he\nwas fired from facebook a year before\nthey went public and he missed out on\nabout 180 million dollars because of the\nfact that he was fired and he started to\ngo into a depression\nand when he noticed he was going into\noppression he was there for a while he\nstarted sitting around and going man i\ndon't i don't like being depressed\nanymore i'm gonna i'm gonna figure out a\nway to be happy and so what he did was\nhe made a happiness list\nevery single thing that makes him happy\nit could have been music it could have\nbeen you know walking his dog it could\nbe certain food it could be certain\npeople it could be conversations it\ncould be a movie he made a massive list\nof every single thing that makes him\nhappy and what he did was every single\nmorning he would look at that list and\nthen he would look at the things that he\nhad to do today and he would say how can\ni bring as many of these things from\nthis list\ninto my day\nand the quote that i love that he told\nme was that i will not leave my\ndepression or my happiness left up to\nchance\ni'm gonna be in control of it\nnow when you hear that and you start\nthinking of your own life are you\nleaving your own life up to chance\nor are you actually being extremely\nintentional about every single thing\nthat you need\nwhat would it look like if you were to\nsit down and make a massive list of\nevery single thing that you love every\nsingle thing that makes you happy every\nsingle thing that makes you feel better\nwhether that is music whether it is you\nknow playing with a puppy whether it is\njust a certain food\ncertain restaurant certain friends\ncertain cocktails that you like whatever\nit is a movie that you want to watch\nlistening to certain music going out and\nyou know seeing a band play what is it\nthat that just makes you feel more alive\nwhat is it that would\nseem like a piece of a life that you\nlove if you were to build a life that\nyou love what is a essential piece that\nyou would want to make sure that you\nhave and you go through every single\naspect of your life and you actually\nstart to plan it so let's do it together\nif you have a pen and paper this would\nbe a really good time to pull it out\nlet's go through as many aspects of your\nlife as we possibly can right so let's\nlet's bring the first thing in let's\njust let's just go hard from the very\nbeginning your significant other\nright is this someone that you actually\ndo love\nor is this someone that you feel like\nmaybe you're just you know making sure\nthat you're not lonely anymore\nyou know be honest with yourself it's\nokay you're the only one that's here\nthat's talking to me and listening to\nthis right so be honest with yourself\nyou know are there uh maybe you do love\nthem but maybe there's certain aspects\nof them in certain aspects of your\nrelationship that you want to change\nokay so what we want to do we take a\na list and we make a list of everything\nthat we love and then we make a list of\nneeds to change right maybe that maybe\nthe person needs to change it needs to\nbe a completely different person or\nmaybe you and that person need to change\na little bit in the way you show up to\nthe relationship maybe say okay\nyeah i do love this person but\nto be honest with you our communication\nsucks\nand what happens well i'll do something\nshe'll do something and we don't say\nanything because our communication sucks\nand it builds up and it builds up and it\nbuilds up and then what happens it just\nexplodes and it explodes because none of\nus are willing to actually have a\nconversation in the time that we're\nsupposed to have a conversation so\nokay what do i love about this person\nwhat are the sternum i love their\nadventure i love how they're you know so\ngoofy i love these things okay i want to\ndeepen these things that i love and if i\nhave a needs to change lists i need to\nbring this up with them and actually\nstart to figure out what we need to do\ntogether to change it perfect now we've\nat least got a little bit of a plan\ndon't we\nnow we can start to build a relationship\nthat we love great let's go into our\nfriendships let's look at all of our\nfriends who do you love who are the\npeople that are there for you what do\nyou love about them\nwhat are the ways that you want to show\nup to that relationship with them even\ndeeper let's go deeper into it okay now\nlet's go into the needs to change list\nwell you know there is this one friend\nthat's always negative i can try to\nchange them but i probably can't so\nmaybe what happens is i spend less time\nwith them okay so you go through each\nperson and you think about the\nrelationship that you have with them and\nyou start thinking to yourself is this\nsomebody that's going to\nbe playing an integral part of my life\n10 years from now and where i want to be\n10 years from now or is this someone\nwho's actually kind of pulling me back\ninto being my old self that i'm trying\nto grow away from you know is there\ncertain aspects of this person or this\nrelationship with them that i want to\nchange or maybe just change it\ncompletely and spend less time with them\nand start spending time with maybe a new\nacquaintance that will pull me into the\nperson that i want to be right something\nto think about\nall right let's keep going what about\nyour family you know your your\nrelationship with your parents\nrelationship obviously you can't change\nyour parents you can't change your\nbrother and sister you can't change any\nof those people what do you love about\nthem how can you deepen the certain\naspects that you love about them so you\nspend more time in that aspect that you\nlove with them\nand then on the other side what are the\nthings that you don't love that you do\nwant to change oh yeah well i feel like\nyou know this person i feel like my\ndad's really surface level and he\ndoesn't really go deep with me and he's\nnot really an emotional guy and\ndoesn't really open himself up there's a\nway to crack them open and maybe start\nto have some real actual legitimate\nconversation so i can feel like i know\nthis person right you can go through\nevery single relationship and start to\nask yourself\nwhat is it that i love about it what is\nit that needs to change okay all right\nlet's go to the next aspect what about\nyour job or your career\nokay what is it about your job or your\ncareer do you love your job or is it\njust something that you're doing to make\nmoney right i understand that you can't\njust quit today a job that you hate\nbut\nit's kind of ridiculous to just think\nthat you're going to be there forever\nisn't it\nlike why if why would you just just\nautomatically go yeah well i hate my job\nbut it's the way that i pay the bills\nright okay i understand that but can you\nmake a transition plan and say okay i\ncan't leave today\nbut i could come up with a way to to be\ngone and to be doing something different\nin 365 days okay that makes me feel good\nokay so let's let's come up with a need\nto need to change what is it that i\nwould like my job to look like what is\nit that i would like my uh\ncareer to look like maybe i do like\nwhere i am but maybe i don't like the\nposition that i'm in i want to actually\nget a promotion okay what do i need to\ndo to change that what do i need to do\nto get a promotion next 365 days and you\nstart coming up with an actual plan to\nget you to where you want to go in your\ncareer and your job as well\nperfect\nlet's keep going let's say that you have\na business okay what do you love about\nyour business\nyou know what do you hate about your\nbusiness what are the things that you\nwant to change about your business think\nabout that what about the people that\nyou work with your employees\nyou know are these employees that you\njust hired because you needed to put\nsomebody in place or these people who\nyou actually really want to see them\ngrow and you want to spend more time\nwith them you know you start to think\nabout that and go yeah maybe i do have\nthese people on my team that i'm not\nreally 100\nuh\nin love with they're not really the best\nperson but i hired them a couple years\nago and when you look at it you're like\nactually this person could be producing\nway more if i had a better person in\nthat position\n[Music]\nmaybe i should let this person go maybe\ni should you know maybe i'm holding them\nback by keeping you know holding them\nback from the life they could have by\nkeeping them in this position maybe i\nneed to let them go right so think about\nthat what about the house that you have\nare you in love with your house\nmaybe you are okay are there certain\naspects of your house that you want to\nchange\noh yeah there are certain aspects i\nwanted to change it's it's always too\ndirty uh okay well that's something that\nwe can work on all right so what do i\nneed to do to change it to make sure the\nhouse isn't as dirty as it is maybe you\ndon't love your house what is the house\nthat you love\nyou know how much would it cost to buy\nthat house maybe you don't have the\nmoney for it right now what do you need\nto do in order to figure out how to get\nthat money and what you do is you start\ngoing through every single aspect of\nyour life and you make a plan you just\nfigure out what needs to be done\nwhat about the car you drive do you love\nthe car you drive do you hate the car\nyou drive what do you need to do to\nfigure out what what is the car that you\nwant\nokay figure out what it is how much does\nit cost you go test drive that freaking\nthing so it gets you more excited about\nit and then you're more likely to work\nto try to get that thing okay great\nthat's the card that i want i know what\nit is i know how much it's going to cost\nme i know exactly how much monthly\npayment's going to be if i were to put\ndown x amount of dollars okay what do i\nneed to do to get that money to drive\nthat car\nyou know it's not about just acquiring\nbut it's also thinking you know maybe i\nfeel better about myself when i'm\ndriving this and i show up better to\nwhere i'm going\nyour car's a part of it what about your\nclothes is there clothes that you don't\nlike maybe you're like oh [ __ ] i've been\nwearing clothes for the past 10 years i\nhaven't bought clothes in a really long\ntime okay well style's changed in the\npast 10 years maybe you don't look as\ngood as you thought you used to back in\nthe day and you're like i need to change\nthis all right well let me change\nexactly the clothes that i'm wearing\nwhat is it that you how much does that\ncost maybe you want to hire somebody to\nto teach you what to wear and they go\nout and they go shopping with you and\nfor you and help you build an actual\nwardrobe where you don't look like a\nshmo right i don't know what it is but\nfigure out what it is that you want what\nabout your mindset what are different\naspects of your mindset that you're like\noh man you know what i talk negatively\nway too much to myself i need to stop\ntalking negatively myself how can i come\nup a plan to not talk as negative to\nmyself right what do i love about the\nway that i talk to myself well\ni build myself up i'm a positive person\ni'm more optimistic whatever it is\nfigure out what you love about the way\nthat you talk to yourself the way that\nyour mindset is and then figure out what\nyou need to change what do you love what\ndo you need to change what about your\nmorning routine what's your morning\nroutine look like right there's so many\naspects of your life every single aspect\nof your life you just go through with a\nfine-tooth comb and you figure out what\nyou like what you don't like and how can\nyou make sure that you're building a\nlife of just the things that you want\nyou think about every single thing that\nyou do on a daily basis from the moment\nyou wake up\nto the moment you go to bed\nhow can i make sure that every single\nthing that i do is something that i love\nyou think about every single action that\nyou take from the moment you wake up to\nmoments you go to bed how can i make\nsure that every single action that i\ntake is something that i absolutely love\nthink about every single person you come\nin contact with\nevery person that you talk to every\nperson who's faces you every person who\ncalls you every person who emails you\nevery person who text messages you how\ncan you make sure that every single\nperson you come in contact with is not\nsomebody that brings you down not\nsomebody's negative but somebody who you\nabsolutely love that wants the best for\nyou and empowers you to be better\nperfect what about every thought that\nyou think from the moment you wake up to\nthe moment you get better what it\nrequires is absolute full awareness\nand i know that some people listen to\nthis it's going to go in one ear and out\nthe other and you're not going to make a\nplan and you're just going to go ah yeah\nwell this is a great episode on to the\nnext one instead of actually taking a\nplane and figure out what it is realize\nthat you can go through every single\naspect of your day and start to make\nchanges in everything that you do start\nto make change in every single thing\nthat you have and realize that your life\nis not going to change right away it\ntakes time to change\nthe person that you're with it takes\ntime to change the place that you live\nit takes time to change the career that\nyou have the job that you have the\nemployees that you have whatever it is\nit takes time for change to happen but\nwhat if i told you that\nin 10 years 10 years from today\nyou will have a life that you absolutely\nlove like the perfect life\nwould that excite you\nif you're like 10 years from today i'm\ngonna have the perfect life would that\nexcite you hell yeah it would\nwell it's absolutely possible but it\nrequires you to step up to figure out\nwhat you love what you don't love and\nstart to work past it what's crazy about\nis that some people\nlike if you really think about it some\npeople are more intentional\nabout putting hard work into their jobs\nand many people hate those jobs so some\npeople are putting hard work and showing\nup and getting [ __ ] done in a job that\nthey absolutely hate but they're not\neven doing that for their own freaking\nlife it blows my mind that some people\ntake their jobs more serious than they\ntake their life\nright so imagine if you and i are\ncreating a business we're going to go in\nas business partners what are we going\nto do we're going to create a business\nplan first we're not just going to go\nhey we're just going to sell this\nproduct and see what happens no we're\ngoing to come up with a business plan\nand figure out exactly okay what's the\nmarketing look like what's the sales\nlook like what's the shipping look like\nwhat's the this look like and the\npictures the photography and all that\nstuff we're going to have about the\nbusiness plan\nright do you have do you even have a\nlife plan\nthink about that for a second that's the\nfirst thing now if we're business\npartners we're gonna at least have\nquarterly reviews aren't we if you work\nfor a business you guys have quarterly\nreviews in what you do so do you have\nquarterly reviews in your life\nno\nwell what are you doing why don't you\ntry to figure out a way to start coming\nup with quarterly reviews see if you're\non track to hitting your goals the same\nway that if you're on a sales team\nyou're going to have quarterly reviews\nwhat else you're gonna have weekly\nmeetings\nsee how today how this week went you're\ngonna look back and look forward see\nwhat you're working for see what's going\non and then what are you gonna do\nsometimes my team and i have a morning\nhuddle every single morning every\nmorning i talk to my team do you even\nhave a morning huddle with yourself\nor you just kind of seeing what happens\nif you're not fully satisfied with your\nlife it might be because you've just not\nbeen intentional you've not been having\nquarterly meetings you have no plan you\nhave no quarterly meetings you have no\nweekly meetings you have no morning\nhuddles\nof course you're not where you want to\nbe because you might not even know where\nyou want to be at this point and it's\nsome it's just it's just so crazy that\nsome people take their job that they\nhate more serious than the life that\nthey have in the life they're trying to\nbuild\nso what would happen if you took\nyour life as serious and planned out\nyour life as serious and as intricately\nas you do your business or the company\nthat you work for where would your life\nbe in a year five years ten years down\nthe road if you took your life that\nseriously\nand it's simple it's not hard but it\ntakes time you have to plan it out\nfigure out what you want make a plan you\nhave to work for it you're gonna have to\nreview it often and then you're going to\nhave to adjust\nthings are not going to work out exactly\nthe way that you want\nit's going to take some time\nbut\nisn't it worth it\nif this is your life\nshouldn't you be taking this more\nserious than anything else that exists\nbecause this is your life this isn't\nanybody else's
