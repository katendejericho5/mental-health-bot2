    "transcript": "the conversations that i have are they\njust neutral conversations or do they\nhold the energy of transformation for\nmyself and for other people\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe importance of every single\nconversation that you have\nand to actually take you through this\njourney that we're going to go on\ntogether i'm actually going to tell you\ntwo separate stories that have really\nkind of changed my perspective of life\nand when i have a conversation with\nsomebody realizing that me but also for\nyou as well\nthat one conversation that we have with\nsomeone can completely change their life\nwhether we realize or not and that can\nbe for positive but it can also be for\nnegative so the first story i'm going to\ntell you is\nabout six months ago i was walking\ninside of a parking lot in austin i was\nleaving the mall and uh this guy was\nwalking past me with his girlfriend and\nhe's like hey rob love everything that\nyou do and i didn't really hear him\nbecause i remote started my truck my\ntruck was kind of loud and so i was like\nwhat's that and he came over and started\ntalking to me it was him his girlfriend\nand he's like hey man i just want to\ntell you i follow you on instagram i\nlisten to your podcast and i love all\nthe stuff that you do i was like that's\nawesome thanks so much and he goes\ni don't know if you remember we actually\nmet before and i was like really where\ndid we meet and he goes uh we met in\nflorence italy a couple years ago and i\nwas like oh that's pretty awesome and he\nstarted telling me about where we met we\nmet at a pizza and gelato making tour\nwhere we were making pizza making gelato\nand as soon as he said and i saw him and\ni saw his girlfriend i was like oh\ni remember you guys we had a\nconversation while we were making gelato\nright and he said yeah and we were\ntalking about you know my girlfriend at\nthe time and i which is not my fiance we\nwere traveling for a month throughout\nitaly and him and his girlfriend were\ntraveling for like 10 days and he had a\njob she had a job and he said uh you\nknow he was like yeah man it'd be so\nnice just to travel and do what we want\nto like you guys but we have a job and\nwe can't really do that well what\nhappened was he asked me what i do and i\ntold him i was a coach and i told him\nhow it worked and i told him how i did\nat that time one-on-one coaching and how\ni made money it was like probably a\n15-20 minute conversation at most like\nit wasn't that long of a conversation we\nhad enough of a conversation that when\nhe went home that day he started\nresearching about becoming a coach\nonline and what that would look like and\nhe used to deal with a lot of anxiety\nwhen he was younger and went through a\nlot of self-development to then overcome\nhis anxiety\ncrazy enough we had that conversation\ntwo years ago never saw him again until\ni saw him inside of this parking lot and\nhe told me that he after leaving and\nleaving italy and coming back to america\nthe day he came back he put his two\nweeks in at work\nand he said i'm gonna figure out how to\nstart a coaching business because i feel\nlike i have a lot of value to give\npeople and when i saw him inside of the\nparking lot he said that he now has 11\nemployees in his company so i just had a\nvery normal conversation talking about\nwhat i do for my profession and how we\ntravel and how we love traveling we\nusually travel for you know\n30 40 50 of the year and he was like i\nwant that i'm gonna figure out how to do\nthat and literally he went from that\nconversation to coming back quitting his\njob starting his business figuring it\nout figuring out marketing figuring out\nall that stuff and now it's not only\njust his life that has changed but it's\nalso\nhis fiance works\nhis fiance now not just his girlfriend\nhis fiancee also works in his company\nand he now employs 11 people so\n12 people's lives have changed from that\nconversation i'm not saying it because\ni'm not trying to toot my own horn\nbecause that's the last thing i'm trying\nto do i'm trying to say it because i was\ndriving home after that i was like holy\nsh\ni can't believe\nhow many conversations i have throughout\nthe day\nand if they have the potential to do\nsomething like what happened with this\nguy and so it was really eye-opening for\nme\nanother story that i want to tell you\nthat's very similar\nin a way also happens to be in florence\nitaly and it was the very first time\nthat i was recognized by somebody in\npublic and this was back four years ago\nnow five years ago and uh there was a\nlady that came up to me and we were\nwalking through a uh leather shop\nand she came up to me as we were walking\nout and it was uh my fiance and i and\nshe goes excuse me excuse me excuse me\nand she was like do you uh she had kind\nof broken english she goes do you uh do\nyou know rob dial and i was like uh\nyeah i do i am robbed out and she's like\noh i swear to god she goes oh mama mia\nand i was like oh my god it's like a\nmovie they actually say this over here\nand uh and she started saying she's like\noh my god oh mamma mia this is i i i\ncan't and she started getting like kind\nof flustered she kept saying mamma mia\nlike 20 times and she's like\ntelling me how i was running a webinar\none time she listened to the podcast i\nwas running a webinar one time and the\nwebinar was like at three o'clock in the\nmorning for her and she woke up in the\nmorning three o'clock in the morning\njust to be on this hour long live that i\nwas running\nand inside of the live i guess i had\nsaid something along the lines of like\nhow we need to focus on what we're\ngrateful for and if we focus on what\nwe're grateful for it will change our\nperspective for our life and she was in\nand she was on her way walking to she\ntold me a story of how she was walking\nto\num her work that she worked at she was\nwalking across the bridge and she was\nhaving this terrible day she got in a\nfight with her boyfriend and a whole\nbunch of other things were just\nhappening and she was having a crap day\nwhich happened sometimes right she was\nhaving a crappy day and she was walking\nacross the bridge and she goes you know\nwhat i'm going to try to think the way\nthat rob told me to think in that live\nthat i was on and so she stopped when\nshe was walking across this bridge\nthat's in florence called ponte vecchio\nshe was walking across and she looked\nand she's like oh my gosh\nwhat can i be grateful for right now and\nshe's like this this city i live in such\na beautiful city like people travel from\nall over the world to literally spend a\ncouple days in the city that i get to\nlive in and have grown up in in my\nentire life and she's looking over the\nbridge and there's people that are on\ncanoes and they're going on the canoes\nand she's like this is beautiful like\nthe mountains are in the distance\nthere's the the river that i'm above\nright now there's people walking around\nthere's a kayak that's down there as\nwell\nand it's so amazing that i get to live\nin a city like this and then she was\nlike what else can i be grateful for and\nshe started listing all of these things\nthat she could be grateful for and she\nrealized that the first half of her walk\nshe was in a terrible mindset and then\nshe shifted her mindset to which she\nshould be grateful for in the rest of\nher walk she said was amazing and she\nhad an amazing day and it clicked in her\nhead of i am in control of how i feel\nthroughout the day and i say those\nstories not to once again toot my horn\nsort of way i say this because i want\nyou to understand the power of every\nsingle conversation that you have and\nyou start to think about that think\nabout all of the conversations that you\nhave in your life all of them that\nyou've had so far today all of them that\nyou've had yesterday the day before that\nyour entire life and then ask yourself a\nquestion\nthe conversations that i have are they\njust neutral conversations or do they\nhold the energy of transformation for\nmyself and for other people do i come\ninto a conversation with some form of\nleadership of hey how can i make this\nperson's day better how can i help them\nin some sort of way if there's something\nthat i can do to transform this person's\nday their mindset this moment is there a\nway that i can show up differently to\nhelp this person transform\nor are we having conversations with\npeople and bringing them down\nthat's something we need to think about\nright i'll tell you another story what\nwas a huge life-changing conversation\nfor me when i was younger\none of my very first mentors i used to\nrun his office when i worked for a\nmarketing company and he's like hey man\nlike we were the number one office out\nof 740 offices right we were number one\nin the entire united states and he goes\nhey man let's he calls me up he says hey\nlet's go get lunch\nmeet me at chipotle we meet at chipotle\nwe sit down and he goes all right and he\nwas very brash like just set it straight\nto the point exactly how it was he goes\ni don't know how else to say this to you\num\npeople don't like you\nand i was like\noh\nokay i wasn't expecting to have this\nconversation and i was very taken back\nby it because i was like what do you\nwhat do you mean people don't like you\nhe's like listen man\ni know your heart and i know who you are\nas a person\nand i see that come out because i spend\nso much time with you and i've seen you\nfor so long\nbut a lot of people don't see that a lot\nof people see this character that you\nhave built yourself into that is not\nyour true self there's a character of\nthis person that you play that is i\ndon't give a damn and you're making fun\nof and you're you're cracking jokes and\nall of this stuff but what the problem\nis you're throwing little tiny and what\nhe called them was negs n-e-g-s short\nfor negative right\nthrowing little negs at people where\nit's like little teeny tiny negative\ncomments you know short short for\nnegative comments you're throwing these\nat them\nand it might not be one that hurts it\nmight not be two but if they have a\nconversation and another conversation\nanother one another one another one and\neven if you're saying it just kidding\naround they eventually add up\nand then people start to go yeah i don't\nreally like this guy because every\nsingle time that i'm around him he makes\nme feel worse about myself and that was\na life-changing conversation for me to\nhave that conversation because then i\nstarted actually thinking back over all\nthe stuff that i said and realizing that\neven though i was kidding really what i\nwas doing was i was trying to overcome\nfrom a lack of self-worth\ni was trying to get my self-worth from\nin little tiny ways bringing people down\nto make myself feel better then and so i\nwant to i want you to think about this\nfor a second and ask yourself like in\nthe conversations that you have\ndo they hold the energy of\ntransformation or do they have little\ntiny negs negative comments in them to\nbring somebody down just a tiny bit even\nif it's just a joke like when i used to\nthink oh we're just kidding we're just\nmessing around we're having fun we're\nkidding we're messing around we're\nhaving fun and i started to realize hey\nthis is people are not viewing it this\nway people actually think that i'm\ncutting them down and do i want to be\nknown as the person forever that cuts\npeople down\nno that's not what i want to be and so i\nstarted to notice the way i was talking\nto people and i didn't get out of the\nhabit very quickly but it was something\ni started working on i would say stuff\nand be like i shouldn't have said that\nand i still do that now oh god i don't\nknow if that was taken correctly i\ndidn't mean it the way that it now\nsounds in my head as i'm starting to\nthink about it from their perspective\nthe thing that i think that we should\nall think about and the reason why i'm\nbringing this up as far as how every\nconversation can change someone else's\nlife is that we should be very aware of\nthe energy that we bring into every\nconversation because\nwe should try our best to lift people up\nbecause there's one thing that i know is\nthat the world is hard enough as it is\nright now\nthe world's not easy there's some fun\nthings there's some beautiful things\nthere's some really challenging things\nand there's a lot of people who put on a\nreally good face\nas if everything's okay and as every as\nif everything's amazing but in reality\nthey're really struggling and the last\nthing that i want to do\nis to accidentally say something to\nsomebody\nthat is not doing their greatest that is\nnot doing the best and i bring them even\nlower\nand even if someone's doing great last\nthing i want to do is bring somebody\ndown i want to build people up in\neverything that i do and so i want to\nthink to you about how powerful every\nsingle conversation has the opportunity\nto be when you go into it with the\nintention of i'm going to hold the\nenergy of transformation and this is for\npeople who you know even if you have\nkids think about the conversations that\nyou have with your children the way that\nyou talk to them and the things that you\nsay and the jokes that you might make to\nyour children but maybe they're young\nand they don't understand that it's a\njoke and they take it seriously and they\ntake it to heart i remember one time\nwhen i was a kid\ni'll kind of give you an idea i'm in the\nthe process of of getting my pilot's\nlicense because i've always wanted to be\na pilot since i was a kid and i remember\nwhen i was younger\ni was a tall kid and this is probably i\nwas probably 13 12 13 years old probably\n12 years old and i was a tall kid\ngrowing up and i remember when i went to\nthe doctor the doctor was like yeah it\nlooks like you're probably gonna be over\nsix feet you're probably gonna be about\nsix feet six foot one six foot two and i\nremember i wanted to be a fighter pilot\ni thought it was like the coolest thing\ni want to be an astronaut i want to be a\nfighter pilot and i was really big on\nlike becoming a fighter pilot and flying\njets\nand i don't even remember who the hell\nthis was but i remember having a\nconversation with an adult one time and\nthe adult said to me well you know that\nif you're over six feet you can't fly\nplanes right for the for the army or the\nnavy or the uh air force you can't you\ncan't fly planes for them because you\ndon't fit inside of the cockpit and i\nremember going oh man\nlike well if if that's the case what's\nthe point of me learning this what's the\npoint of me dedicating my life to\nlearning this if i'm going to event i\ncan't change how tall i am and the\ndoctor says because we all think as a\nkid that doctors know everything\nand a lot of adults think that doctors\nknow everything but that's not always\nthe case\nespecially they don't know how tall i'm\ngonna be then he actually ended up being\npretty close to right because i am over\nsix feet but the the thing that happened\nthough is i've talked with so many\npilots now that are just as tall as me\nor taller than me that fly jets they fly\nplanes and what happened was that one\nconversation with a person that i don't\neven remember who they are but i\nremember that they were an adult and\nthey were older than me so if they're\nadult and they're older they probably\nknow better than i do\nand i don't hold a grudge that person\nany sort of way because i love my life\nas it is and it happened exactly as it's\nsupposed to but how different could my\nlife be right now if that person never\nsaid that to me how many people's dreams\nhave been crushed by an adult that says\nsomething\njust kidding ingest that's just\nside you know side conversation they say\nsomething to a child and a child that\nmight not be as intellectually smart as\nan adult and know that it's a joke or\nmight completely miss it then take that\nto heart and go oh\nyeah maybe i shouldn't do that thing and\nso for those of you guys that have\nchildren\nor you're ever around children also be\nvery aware of the way that you speak to\nthem and do you have the energy of\ntransformation or building that child up\nbecause you guys remember back to when\nyou were kids like\nmiddle school high school those things\ncould be real real hard for people right\nso the worst thing we could do is bring\nsomebody down that's already down\nbecause you know children can be vicious\nthat's for sure we should always have\nthe energy of transformation for\neveryone that we're in a conversation\nwith\nand think about how we can build people\nup as much as we possibly can because\nyou never have any idea\nhow much something that you say to\nsomebody can change your life for the\npositive\nor for the negative and so the one thing\ni want you to be aware of is the stuff\nthat you say to other people because\nit's important knowing how the world is\nknowing how people think knowing how\ntough it is especially right now with\nall of the stuff that people are going\nthrough in the positive face that people\ncan put on how important it is for us to\njust think about\nus showing up for other people as much\nas we possibly can and we might be like\nwell yeah but what about ourselves when\nyou show when you show up with the\nenergy of transformation\nwhat's beautiful about it in\ntransformation or positivity or building\npeople up is people will usually meet\nyou at the energy that you're at so you\ncan either meet them at the energy that\nthey're at which could be low it could\nbe indifferent could be just whatever or\nyou can say you know what i'm going to\nbring people up in every single\nsituation that i'm in every single\nconversation that i'm in i'm going to\nhold\nmyself to the highest standard to\ntalking to people the way that i want to\nbe talked to to treating the people the\nway that i want to be treated and i'm\ngoing to have every single conversation\nthat i have hold the level of\ntransformation so that i can hopefully\nimpact as many people as i want to\nbecause had i never had that\nconversation with that guy that was\ninside the garage i would have never\nknown that that happened had i never\nwalked into that leather shop i would\nhave never known that that happened as\nwell and it makes me think about how\nmany other conversations have i had that\nhave steered people's lives in some sort\nof way because all of our conversations\ncan steer people in other directions\njust little teeny tiny conversations and\nso this really woke me up to the the\nopportunity that we all have to help\npeople or the opportunity we have where\nwe actually bring people down if we're\nnot being very diligent to make sure\nwe're holding that energy but can you go\ninto every single conversation with the\nenergy of i'm going to go in with the\nenergy of transformation positivity and\ntrying to help this person as much as i\npossibly can i will not dip into\nnegativity i will not dip into a place\nthat i don't want to go to i want to\nhold that energy and see if that person\ncan meet me there\nbecause every conversation she has every\nconversation that you have has the\nopportunity for transformation\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well i think the\npurpose of this life purpose of us being\nthat's all i'm here to do there is\nnothing else for me to do except"
