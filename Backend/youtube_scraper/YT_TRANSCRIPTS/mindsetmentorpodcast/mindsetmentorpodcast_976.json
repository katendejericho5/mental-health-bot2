    "transcript": "[Music]\nyou are perfect the way that you are no\nmatter what has happened to you and\nthere is nothing wrong with you it's\ntrue\nbut do you believe it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe fact that there is nothing wrong\nwith you and that you are literally\nperfect as you are and you are not broke\nin any sort of way there is nothing that\nhas ever been wrong with you and\neverything that's ever happened to you\nis absolutely perfect and um you might\nhear that and be like oh well there's a\nlot of things that have happened to me\nthat are bad or there are a lot of\nthings that have happened that i didn't\nwant to happen and i have this\nan episode that has this flavor every\nsingle year i guess you could say\nbecause i get this a lot in my line of\nwork\nof self-improvement\nwhat tends to happen is is when somebody\ndecides that they want to improve\nthemselves it's kind of like a veil\nbeing lifted to all of the things that\nneed some improvement and so when we\nstart to see the things that we've been\nblind to i'll be honest with you\nignorance is bliss if i was ignorant to\nthe fact that i don't need to improve\nmyself and there's things that i need to\nwork on\nthis would be pretty damn blissful but i\ndon't think that i would have the life\nthat i want to and i think that's for\nmost people if you're listening to this\npodcast it's because you do want to\nlearn you do want to grow you do want to\nget better but in turn\nwhen you say getting better that means\nthere's things that you might want to\nquote unquote fix and so we're going to\ntalk about everything that's happened to\nyou once again like i said in my line of\nwork with self-development i've seen it\nall like i've heard\nthe worst stories that you could hear\nfrom all the different things that\npeople go through you know i've seen all\nkinds of abuse i've seen mental abuse\ni've seen physical abuse i've seen\nsexual abuse i've seen people who have\nhad their parents murdered\ni've had seen people who have had family\nmembers murdered i have people who have\nhad attempted murder on them\nall kinds of things that have happened\nall kinds of different traumas all kinds\nof different abuses i've seen\nyou know suicides that people have had\naround them i've seen people who have\nattempted suicide multiple times i've\nseen\npeople who have you know have been\naround murderers i've seen people who\nhave you know been sexually assaulted\ni've seen all of the worst things in the\nworld and it really opens you up to\nnumber one the compassion i have for\npeople because you start to see that\nsome people that even look like they\nhave it all together\nhave other things that they're dealing\nwith at all points in time and it really\nmakes you have compassion for people and\nrealizing that you never really know\nwhat someone's going through like you\nnever know what's actually happening in\nsomeone's mind in someone's life unless\nthey're fully open authentic with you\nand a lot of times people are not and so\ni've seen a lot of the worst things and\nso when you look at those things like\nyou know abuses and suicides and murders\nand parents that have drug problems or\nalcohol problems or parents that you\nknow commit suicide and all of these\nthings those are all traumas and if\nyou're listening to me and you're like\nwell i haven't had all of those things\nhappen to me i've had a pretty good\nchildhood i had things you know happen\nthroughout my life but it was nothing\nthat was that bad of trauma i'm gonna\nbring this frame in just so you can\nunderstand before we go deeper into it\nthe trauma that happens to you in your\nlife doesn't have to be quote unquote\nmassive trauma to leave a really deep\nscar some people feel bad because their\nlives have been pretty good and i talk\nwith a lot of people who have had like\ngreat lives they have great parents but\nthey still have things that they're\ntrying to overcome\nthat happen because you can't go through\nthis life without some scars like it's\nimpossible to go through this life and\nnot have some scars we're still bullies\nthere's still you know advertisements\nthat are telling us that we're not good\nenough unless we buy their products\nthey're comparing ourselves to other\npeople on instagram and other people's\nbusinesses there's all these comparisons\nand they feel like they don't um they\nfeel like they don't deserve to feel\nlike they have trauma because they\ndidn't have any what we would call quote\nunquote massive trauma in their life you\nknow some people\nlistening you might not have had those\nmassive traumas maybe you weren't beaten\nmaybe you weren't sexually assaulted any\nof those things but maybe\nyou know your your dad worked all of the\ntime and he never gave the love that you\nactually wanted or the love that you\nactually deserved and maybe he wasn't\nthere for you you know but he was\ndoing his best and trying to provide for\nthe family and in turn he was very\nabsent that's also a form of trauma\nor you know some people your your mother\ncould have gotten mad at you and the way\nthat she quote-unquote disciplined you\nwas by pulling her love away that right\nthere is a form of trauma it's not\nphysical abuse it's not any of those\nthings that i mentioned earlier but it\nis a form of trauma because a child is\nnot getting what they need in that\nmoment which the most important thing is\njust love from their parents acceptance\nfrom their parents emotional safety from\ntheir parents and some people you know\nyour mom or your dad or someone might\nhave pulled love away from you in order\nas a way to reprimand you that is a\ntrauma and a lot of people go through\nthat as well some people your mom might\nhave been afraid she was a very fearful\nperson because she was taught to be\nafraid of the world and so she might\nhave instilled a lot of fear into you\nand i see this a lot with people where\nit's like my mom was great she loved me\nso much my dad was great he loved me so\nmuch but the thing that they did was\nthey instilled so much fear into me\nabout the real world because they didn't\nwant me to go out and be naive and get\nmyself into a bad situation that is a\nform of trauma in in some people's case\ntrauma can just be absolute neglect you\nknow a lot i mean a lot a lot of people\njust have emotional neglect from their\nparents not on purpose because\neverybody's doing the best with what\nthey have but they have a form of trauma\nbecause they didn't get the love that\nthey wanted as a kid or they didn't they\ndidn't their parents might not have been\ngood with emotion and so they don't\nunderstand how to overcome their\nemotions so they were kind of left in\nthis void of i'm feeling all these\nfeelings i don't know what's going on\nand nobody's here to support me that's\nalso neglect that's also trauma neglect\ncan be emotional trauma it can be an\nemotional neglect it can be physical\nneglect it doesn't have to be a big\nquote-unquote big trauma because all\ntrauma in the brain is trauma uh dr\ngabor mate talks about this he dr gabor\nmate is a a psychologist who helped\npeople on the streets in canada who were\naddicted to heroin and he did this for\n12 years and what he started to notice\nwas that every single person that had\nsome form of an addiction had some form\nof trauma that was not overcome the\ndrug use a lot of times was a way to\nnumb the feeling or to run away from the\nfeeling of that trauma that they had\nwhether it was a big trauma and i'm\ngonna keep saying quote unquote big\ntrauma or big or quote unquote small\ntrauma big trauma and small trauma is a\nhuman measurement it's not a\nnervous system measurement the nervous\nsystem in the brain and the body all\nmeasure trauma as trauma no matter how\nbig it is no matter how small it is and\ntrauma at its simplest form is just not\ngetting what you need in your\ndevelopment as a child that's at its\nsimplest form the trauma that you\nreceive is that you can have as a child\nis not getting what you need in your\ndevelopment it can be from your parents\nmost of the time it is from their\nparents but it's also from people that\nyou're close to it can be teachers that\nyou can trauma from it could be bullies\nthat you get trauma from there's so many\ndifferent forms of it and it's important\nto know that trauma is trauma don't\njudge your trauma against somebody\nelse's don't do don't do trauma\ncomparison it could be a big event that\ncloses you off to your development later\non in life you know it could be somebody\nyou know you\na form of trauma happens with a lot of\npeople is you get into your first real\nrelationship you fall in love with\nsomebody when you're\n15 16 years old and you fully open\nyourself up to this feeling of love and\nthey're fully in that feeling of love\nwith you and then maybe they go and\ncheat on you or maybe you fully open\nyourself up and tell your your best\nfriend about this boy that you have a\ncrush on and you're you fully open about\noh my gosh this boy he's just so cute\nand then your friends go tell that boy\nand it's like it's it's a little bit of\na closing off from the world to to\nprotect yourself we learn to close off\nto protect yourself but there's one\nthing that's very common and among all\nof these things and this is why i say\nthere's nothing wrong with you and\nyou're perfect is that one thing that's\nvery common in the sense is people feel\na sense of brokenness i remember i was\ntalking to somebody after i gave a\nspeech there was a young lady that came\nup to me and she's like\nasking me questions she's like if i you\nknow i'll just kind of tell you a little\nbit of her story without going too much\ninto it you know she was she was\nsexually assaulted when she was younger\nand she said since this sexual assault i\nfelt like there's a piece of me that's\nmissing is what her words were there's a\npiece of me that's missing that is just\nso you guys have an idea that is a story\nthat's being told now what happened to\nher was absolutely terrible of course\nyou don't want to wish that on anybody\nbut the story that she's been telling\nher self since that event that is a\nstory that she needs to change is\nthere's something missing and so to kind\nof wake her up to this idea\ni looked at her and i had a good enough\nreport or i go i was looking at i looked\nat her arms and i looked at her legs and\ni looked at her hands i looked at her\nfeet and i said um\nwhat part of you is missing\nand she goes what do you mean you said\nwell there's a party that's missing\nwhere where is the missing part and\nshe's like well no there's not a missing\npart like it just feels like there's\nsomething missing i said okay what is\nmissing and she couldn't answer the\nquestion of what was missing which kind\nof woke her up to the fact that she's\ntelling herself a story and she's now\nidentified herself with that story and\nshe's living her entire life with\nsomething in me is missing and it came\nfrom a you know that developed a lack of\nself-worth and a lack of confidence and\na lot of other things that we ended up\nworking through a lot of people feel\nbroken when they have something that\nhappens and they feel like something's\nthey feel like they're not whole they\nfeel like they're not holding because\nthey're not whole they're not worthy\nthey're not worthy of love they're not\nworthy of respect they're not worthy of\nsuccess they're not worthy of a lot of\ndifferent things and because they they\ndeep down subconsciously feel like\nthey're not worthy they don't actually\ngo for what it is that they want in life\nbecause they don't feel like they're\nworthy they don't think that they're\nworthy and they feel like something's\nwrong with them and they feel like they\ndon't deserve to be happy they don't\ndeserve to be healthy they don't deserve\nto be wealthy they don't deserve to be\nsuccessful they don't deserve it because\ntheir identity is\ni'm not worthy their identity is\nsomething is wrong i'm not whole and i\ndon't deserve to get whatever it is that\ni want and the example that i love and i\nlove it because i get tagged in it all\nthe time i get tagged in posts all the\ntime on instagram\nfor people who have uh of videos of\nthree-legged dogs i want to take you out\nof the human experience real quick and i\nwant to put you into just an experience\nthree-legged dogs i love three-legged\ndogs do you want to know why because a\nthree-legged dog when they lose their\nleg\nnothing changes they don't think\ndifferently of themselves they are still\nthe happiest dog that exists right and\nthey'll hobble around and they'll still\nrun as full speed as they possibly can\nbut what's happening they still have\ntheir tail wagging all the time i love\nit because they have the same amount of\njoy they have the same amount of love\nthey have the same amount of happiness\nthat they had before that leg was taken\naway and for us when we experience\ntrauma sometimes one of the things that\nhappens is we feel like there's now\nsomething wrong with us and this happens\neven with people sometimes if people\nlose an arm sometimes people feel like\nthey're not worthy if someone loses a\nleg they feel like sometimes they're not\nworthy because they feel like they're\nnow less than and the reason why i'm\nbringing these up is because\nit literally the the the event happening\nto you\nis\nnow created a story and that story needs\nto you need to figure out that story is\nan empowering story or if it's a\ndisempowering story and if it's\ndisempowering what is the story that you\nnow want to start telling yourself you\nknow we have uh you guys have heard me\ntalk about toby before toby's our 13\nyear old dog and he's starting to lose\nhis eyesight he still walks around the\nhouse wagging his tail and he doesn't\nsee as well as he used to you know he'll\ngo around and he'll look for us and if\nhe can't sometimes he'll be like 20 feet\naway and he doesn't see us 20 feet away\nhe doesn't see us because we're not\nmoving whatever it is\nbut in watching him lose his eyesight he\nstill sees a little bit in watching him\nlose his eyesight his\ndemeanor has not changed in any sort of\nway\nat all but if that were a human\nsometimes we feel like there's something\nmissing something lacking we can compare\nourselves to other people and so how can\nwe essentially start to live our lives\nlike a three-legged dog is what i want\nto think about they have a\nsomething that could be considered wrong\nwith them\nbut they don't see as anything wrong\nwith them and so many humans say like i\nfeel i feel broke and i don't feel whole\ni feel like part of me is missing a part\nof me was stolen whenever they have\nstuff like that whether it's emotional\ntrauma whether it's physical trauma or\nwhether it's losing an arm or losing a\nleg or losing eyesight or losing hearing\nall of it that i want to get back to is\njust the story that you're telling\nyourself which is why i start off saying\nyou're already perfect there's nothing\nwrong with you is because you are\nperfect the way that you are no matter\nwhat has happened to you and there is\nnothing wrong with you and that's the\nstory that i want you to start learning\nto tell yourself\nit's true\nbut do you believe it because ultimately\nin the grand scheme of life it is true\nbut do you believe that and the more you\nrepeat a story the more you believe it\nand so there's a there's a real famous\nquote that says if you tell a lie big\nenough and keep repeating it people\neventually come to believe it if you\ntell a lie big enough and keep repeating\nit people will eventually come to\nbelieve it you know who said that\nhitler\nsome of us are hitler in our own mind\nand we just have a story that we latch\non to this event happened to me there's\nsomething wrong with me there's\nsomething wrong with me or something\nwrong with me if you keep telling\nyourself there's something wrong with\nyou you will find all of the things that\nare wrong with you because nobody is\nperfect but if you start telling\nyourself i am perfect there is nothing\nwrong with me i am perfect there is\nnothing wrong with me you'll start to\nsee all of the places where you are\nperfect you'll start to see all of the\nplaces where there is nothing wrong with\nyou those things that happen to you are\njust a piece of what happened to you in\nyour past you're not broken you're not\non whole you're not unlovable you're not\nunworthy it's not that something's\nmissing it's just that you won't stop\nrepeating the story that something is\nmissing or that you are unlovable but\nyou are on whole there is something\nwrong with you you have to start\nlistening to the story that's playing\ninside of your head when no one else is\naround and ask yourself is that the\nstory i want to tell myself because it\ncannot be your identity if it's not\nempowering do not allow anything to be\nyour identity if it's not empowering if\nyou\ntell a child that there's monsters under\nthe bed every single day they're going\nto be terrified to go to bed if you tell\nthem every single day they're going to\ngrow up with always looking for\nsomething to attack them always worried\nabout it they might be afraid of there\nmight be a 35 year old adult that's\nafraid of the dark in some sort of way\nbecause there's a story that's been told\nto them question i have for you is what\nmonsters have you been creating by\ntelling yourself the same story over\nagain and over again and over again and\nover because ultimately you're telling\nyourself a lie there's a couple things\nthat you could do to try to start to\nsolve this if this has been hitting home\nwith you in some sort i want to give you\nfour five pieces five pieces to actually\novercoming and solving this it's not an\novernight thing you know if you've been\ntelling yourself the same story for 35\nyears you're not going to tell yourself\nthis just today and wake up tomorrow and\nbe like oh my god i'm just i'm saved i'm\nmy trauma has disappeared all of the the\nnegative things i've been telling myself\nare gone my identity is completely\nchanged it's an everyday thing that we\nhave to work at and so how do we solve\nthis first number one\ntalk to somebody talk to anybody tell\nsomebody actually what's going on in\nyour head you have to realize if you\nkeep it in the dark shame breathes in\nthe dark so now not only do you have\nthis thing that you're thinking about\nnow you're breeding shame by not talking\nabout or feeling bad about it and so\nyou've got to talk with somebody and\nactually just be around somebody who\nultimately you know will look at you\nwith love and acceptance so no matter\nwhat it is that you can say to them\nit's not going to change their idea of\nyou and so the first thing i think\nthat's super important is just start to\ntalk to people that was one of the\nthings that not one of the things this\nis the probably the biggest thing i've\never gotten from starting this podcast\nis i used to not talk about my father\nand him being an alcoholic and him dying\nand then when i started the podcast i\nwas like i'm gonna just be as authentic\nas i possibly can having this podcast\nand sharing my truth and all of my sh\nand how i'm not a perfect person i never\nintend to be a perfect person i'm just\nworking through things has been so\ncathartic for me so is there a somebody\nthat's in your life even if it's just\none person that you can talk to that's\nnumber one talk to somebody number two\nstart to tell yourself a new story\nbecome aware of the story that you're\ntelling yourself and start to change it\nstop the story when you start to notice\nit go on in your head and switch it to a\nnew one and repeat it all day what is\nthe affirmation that you need to start\nrepeating yourself over and over and\nover and over the same way that if you\nlisten to a song\nand you hear it over and over and over\nagain the song turns off and you just\ncontinue to keep hearing that song\nyou could continue to keep\njust having the song stuck in your head\nwell the song that's stuck in your head\nabout who you are in your identity isn't\nthe one that you actually want so that's\nnumber two number three\naccept it\naccept that what happened to you\nhappened to you except that this is who\nyou are except that you've gone through\nthe things that you've gone through\ndon't wish that it would have been\ndifferent accept it as peter crone\nalways says one of my favorite quotes\nwhat happened happened and could not\nhave happened any other way because it\ndidn't what happened happened and could\nnot have happened any other way because\nit didn't so you have to accept it\nnumber four is to then forgive forgive\nthat person\ni know it's hard but i did an episode\nlast week you can go back and listen to\nabout forgiveness and the importance of\nforgiveness this is super super\nimportant i go really in depth as far as\nif you want peace in your life you've\ngot to learn to forgive and you've got\nto fully let go of it so forgive that\nperson not just for for them but for\nyourself as well forgive yourself\nfor what you've done in your life\nforgive yourself forgive them forgive\neveryone that you can because if you try\nto hold on to this resentment it's like\nthe phrase says holding on to resentment\nis like drinking poison and hoping that\nthe other person dies it's only\naffecting you so you've got to learn to\nforgive and then the fifth thing\nultimately come to terms journal this\nout whatever is you have to do realize\nthat you're not broken understand that\nyou're not broken your trauma builds you\nyour trauma comes into your life there's\na great uh documentary called the wisdom\nof trauma by the guy who was talking\nabout earlier dr gabor mate it's called\nthe wisdom of trauma he talks about how\nyour trauma builds you your trauma is\nis almost like sent to you from god or\nthe universe to help build you into the\nperson that you need it's like it's like\ninstead of asking for god to make you\nstronger ask him to give you challenges\nthat make you stronger these are the\nchallenges that were brought to you this\nis the life that you have been given can\nyou build a new identity for yourself in\nthat trauma and realize that you can\nfind it a way to make it part of your\nempowering story versus something that\nholds you back from the life that you\nwant hey thanks so much for watching\nthis video if you want to learn even\nmore about mastering your mind click\nright here and watch this video as well\nyou would have stolen from yourself too\nyou would have cheated on yourself too\nso let's dive deep into this one"
