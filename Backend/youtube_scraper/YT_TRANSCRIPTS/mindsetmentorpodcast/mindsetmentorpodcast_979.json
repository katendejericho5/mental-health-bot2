    "transcript": "you would have stolen from yourself too\nyou would have cheated on yourself too\nso let's dive deep into this one\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to forgive people at the deepest\nlevel not just like oh yeah i forgive\nthem for cheating on me but like at the\ndeepest level and number one why this is\nimportant when you actually look at the\nthe entire universe and god in the\nuniverse and all of those things so it's\ngoing to make your life easier but it's\nalso going to make the person who might\nhave hurt you become a better person as\nwell so we're going to talk about how to\nmake your life easier and how to bring\nmore peace by giving this forgiveness\nand it is\nsimple\nand we're going to go very very deep\ntoday it's simple but it's not\nnecessarily the easiest thing so we're\ngoing to talk about forgiveness\ni'll tell you my own personal belief\nand my personal belief is that the core\nof every single person is good\nthat's just my belief i believe that\nevery single person is good at their\ncore\nthey might not have done be they might\nnot be doing good things now but at\ntheir core they are good and they want\nto be good and at their core there is\ninnocence\nand\nat some point in time we were all broken\naway from our innocence something\nhappened to us maybe it was trauma maybe\nit was society maybe it was a bully\nmaybe it was a teacher that said\nsomething to you maybe it was your\nparents and the way that they raised you\nwhatever it was we had innocence we were\nborn with all of this innocence and then\nit's something happens and there's a\nbreak from that innocence and for you to\nto deeply understand this will make it\nso much easier for the rest of what i'm\ngoing to talk about in this episode uh\nbecause we don't necessarily stay\ninnocent you know things happen life\nhappens uh trauma happens\nsociety happens uh the world just\nhappens to us as people and all that\nwe're searching for in this world is\npeace i had an episode on this a few\nmonths or a few weeks ago\nand i was telling you that we're not\nlooking for happiness most people think\nlike they're searching for happiness\nthey want to just be happy like the\nmovie the pursuit of happiness like\nwe're all in this pursuit of being happy\nwe're not looking for happiness\nand the reason why is because happiness\nis a fleeting emotion it's just like a\npassing cloud it's it could be here and\nthen it could be gone you could be in\nthe best possible state and you get a\nphone call and you have bad news and\nthat happiness can be gone so we're not\nsearching for happiness at the core what\nwe're actually searching for and what we\ntruly want is peace because peace is not\na fleeting emotion peace is a state of\nbeing and that's what we're all truly\nsearching for and so if we are holding\nresentment towards somebody\nit is absolutely in the way of our peace\nand so that's why we need to talk about\nhow to forgive at a very deep level\nyourself the people around you\npeople who have hurt you in the past how\nto forgive them so that you can move on\nand get on with your life and you cannot\nhave peace if you think of the world as\nguilty or you think of the world as bad\none of the things that the news is\ntrying to do to people right now is pull\npeople away from being one like being\none society one human kind and saying\nthese people are doing this or these\npeople are not doing this and because of\nthem doing it or not doing it they are\nbad and they're trying to demonize a set\nof people based off of what they are\ndoing no matter what you believe in\nthat's a fact that is literally what the\nnews is doing it is literally dividing\nit is divisive it is dividing humans\nwhen in reality the best thing we can do\nis we can get together and stop being\ndivided to get together and to be\ntogether so that's what the news does\nand you cannot have peace in your life\nif you are always thinking that there's\nbad if you're thinking that there's bad\npeople if you're thinking that what\nsomeone else is doing is bad for you or\nbad to you or could possibly be bad to\nyou as well the key to unlocking peace\nin your life is to see the world as good\nand see every single person as good in\nwanting to do good and for to forgive no\nmatter what\nas i said this is simple\nit is not easy and so we're going to go\nreally really deep anybody who does bad\nso if think of someone who's done bad to\nyou maybe they've screwed you over maybe\nthey've taken money from you maybe as a\nbusiness partner that ran off with the\nmoney in the business maybe you're\nsomeone that you're in a relationship\nwith the cheated on you maybe it's\nsomebody that beats you up when you were\na kid maybe it's somebody uh\nan adult who talked down to you as a\nchild there's something bad that\nhappened to you right like let's just\nthink of that bad\nanybody who does bad to somebody else is\nlost let me explain to you what i mean\nby that but every single person who does\nbad to another person is lost\nand they don't actually know what\nthey're doing\nthey're lost and they don't know what\nthey're doing anyone who has hurt you is\nalso hurting themselves\nbecause nobody actually wants to hurt\nyou but if they do hurt you they're\nhurting themselves in some sort of way\nas well they are lost\nand to hold resentment towards somebody\nwho is lost or somebody who has hurt us\nsomeone who has done bad to us so if\nyou're they've done bad to you they are\nlost\nthey've hurt you\nto hold resentment towards them\nis not only making it worse for yourself\nit's also reinforcing that person's bad\nin their own consciousness so let's dive\ndeep into this one and there's a quote\nthat mark twain has and it's something\non the lines of anger and resentment is\nthe acid that burns the vessel so to\nhold anger or to hold resentment towards\nsomeone for something that they've done\nfor you is actually the acid that burns\nthe vessel it is actually burning you up\ninside to hold resentment towards them\nso when people say hey you should\nforgive you should forgive for yourself\nyou should also forgive for them and\nsome people like i don't want to forgive\nthem because i don't want them to think\nthey're off the hook whatever dude get\nover it be an adult just get past it\nalready but if you don't let go if you\ndon't\nforgive you are actually hurting\nyourself as much as you are being hurt\nby what it is that they have done\nthere's people and i say this all the\ntime\nthere's people who are still pissed off\nand hold anger and resentment towards\nsomething that somebody did to them 10\nyears ago that person who did it to you\n10 years ago they forgot about it\nthey're not thinking about you so you're\nliterally just beating yourself up over\nsomething that happened to you that\nsomebody did that was bad to you in the\npast so let's let me give you a couple\nof examples just to kind of take this\nand put into some context right let's\nsay somebody breaks into somebody's\nhouse let's say they break into your\nhouse and they seal some steal some\nstuff right i've had people break in i\nhad an office one time when i had an\noffice in fort lauderdale i had somebody\nbreak in and in the room they stole the\ntvs that were in the room they stole the\nthe uh\nthe nintendo wii they stole the sound\nsystem that was there they stole it all\nthey stole it and then right after they\nstole it when i opened the door was when\ni was actually having a meeting with\nlike 30 of my sales reps that were there\nand they were like aren't you mad aren't\nyou pissed off and for a little while i\nfelt like if you've ever had something\nstolen from you you feel really um like\nviolated and i felt really violated and\nthen i said to them if they stole it\nthey must need it more than i do and\ni've always had that feeling if somebody\nsteals it from me i'm not excited i'm\nlike yay they stole something from me\nbut it's like hey they must need it more\nthan i do i'll just i can buy another\none someday but let's just take someone\nbreaking into your house and stealing\nstuff from you i can tell you this\nat the core of that person who stole\nfrom you at the core of them their true\nself if we go back to what i said before\nat their true self which is good at\ntheir true self which is innocent they\nknow that that is bad and it's not\nsomething that they want to do the child\nwho is inside of them didn't want to do\nthat\nbut then you gotta start to take a step\nback because people tend to look at\npeople's actions\nand they don't look at what actually\npeople what's behind the actions as well\nso okay at the core of it the actions\nsomebody stole something from you okay\nbut that means that there's some sort of\nloss of innocence there's some sort of\nstealing them away from the good that's\ninside of them and then so you start to\nask yourself what could have happened to\nthem in their childhood to feel like\nthey have to take something from someone\nelse\nand then you start to think i had a\npretty decent childhood they might have\nhad a really bad childhood\nto to have to go and take somebody\nelse's things that they know is not\nright everybody knows it's not right to\nsteal someone else's stuff but what\nyou're seeing is a child who is not\nloved correctly\nwhat you're seeing is someone that is\nhurting you\nso that they feel like they can have\nmore peace they're like i need to get\nthis tv because i need to be able to pay\nmy bills that could be whatever it is\nright i need to steal this tv because i\nneed to pay my bills and they think\nthat's going to put them at peace but in\nreality it actually puts them in a more\nturmoil because at their consciousness\nat their core self they know that it is\nwrong so don't see the person who did it\nsee the child that is hurt behind it\nmakes sense to you now it makes it a lot\neasier to forgive people when you\nrealize that there's a child that was\nhurt along the way that was their\ninnocence was stolen from them and they\nwent from a path of good onto a path of\nbad\nyou start to realize oh\ni'm never dealing with an adult i'm\nalways dealing with some hurt child\nwhenever i'm dealing with somebody so\ndon't see the person who did it see the\nchild that is hurt behind it if you have\nsomebody who cheated on you right\nlots of us have been cheated on i've\nbeen cheated on before it's not fun it's\nnot great but when you look at that it\nhas you have to realize it has nothing\nto do with you\nwhat it really is is that they have a\nlack of love for themselves which came\nfrom a lack of love from probably their\nparents\nand then they have to go search for it\nin someone else\nyou can look at that and you can go wow\nthat person is actually going out and\ndoing this thing because they didn't get\nthe love from their parents that they\nwanted there's a lack of self-worth is\nit really what it is it is a search for\nlove because they don't have the love\nfor themselves it's a search for love\nit's a search for acceptance and it's a\nsearch for self-worth because they don't\nhave the self-worth inside of them there\nis only and i'm gonna explain what this\nis in a second there is only sanity\nand there is insanity and i don't mean\ninsane like clinical insane you know\nschizophrenic or any of those types of\nthings or psychopath or any of that\nwhen i say insanity i mean saying as in\nlike you're in a sane state or there's\ninsanity which is you're not in that\nsame state which should be good is the\nsame bad is the insanity so sanity is to\nbe in a state where you do right for\nyourself and you do right for others so\nanybody that is not doing right for\nthemselves and others in all of the\nactions that they take is in in some\nform of insanity insanity is to be in a\nstate that hurts others\nnobody who is in that state wants to be\nin that state and usually their actions\nare trying to get themselves free from\nthat state but part of the problem is\nthat they're lost and they're taking\nactions that are actually making that's\ndigging the hole deeper versus actually\ngetting themselves out of it because\nwhen you hurt yourself you hurt others\nwhen you hurt others you hurt yourself\nthat's just the law of the universe when\nyou do good for yourself you do good for\nothers when you do good for others you\ndo good for yourself so when somebody\ndoes bad to somebody else they are\nactually carrying that wrongdoing with\nthem so if you look at it from another\nstandpoint love\nis sanity fear or anything that is not\nin a state of love is insanity everyone\nwhen you when you realize this at a deep\ndeep level and you really get it to your\nbones it'll make your life so much\neasier everyone\nis doing the best with what they have\nthat's it the person who screwed you\nover the person that wronged you at that\nmoment they were literally doing the\nbest that they could with what they had\nif they could do any better they would\nhave done it everyone's doing the best\nwith what they have if you were in their\nexact same shoes and this is what will\nreally kind of yep when you think about\nit if you were in their exact same shoes\nwith their exact same life every single\nsecond every single moment of their life\ngoing through the exact same experiences\nthat they went through you would have\nchosen the same choices that they chose\nwhoa\nholy sh let's think about that one for a\nsecond\nsomebody who does something let's say\nsomebody who steals right let's go back\nto the stealing somebody who steals from\nyou if you had the exact same life every\nsingle moment every single second every\nsingle experience you would have stolen\nfrom yourself too if you have been\ncheated on if you would have gone back\nand lived every single second every\nsingle moment every single experience of\ntheir life you would have cheated on\nyourself too now there's a part of you i\nknow that's already resisting this\nyou're like no no i wouldn't have chosen\nthat well that's because you're speaking\nfrom the consciousness that you have\nfrom the life that you have currently\nreally think about this one for a second\nyou would have done the exact same thing\nthat they did because in that moment\nthey were doing the best they could with\nwhat they have because\nsomeone's actions is always a reflection\nof their consciousness every single\nperson's action is a reflection of the\nconsciousness that they have so\nlet's talk about i'll give you an\nexample real quick okay the perfect\nexample of this is jesus right whether\nyou believe that jesus was a real person\nor you believe it as a story we can\nstill look at it and we can still\nextract lessons from it right because i\nknow there's some people are like you\nknow you do fully believe that jesus was\na person some of you out there are like\nhave full resistance towards it because\nof the way that you were raised here's\nwhat's crazy if you guys had each\nother's lives you would believe what\neach other believes that's the crazy\npart about it but let's just take the\nstory as the story in the way that it is\nextract what you want to and what good\ncomes from it right\nwhen jesus was being murdered the thing\nthat he actually says is forgive them\nfather for they know not what they do\nthey know not what they do he could see\npast their actions to the consciousness\nthat they had\nhe could see past the actions of other\npeople murdering him\nknowing that if he had the exact same\nlife that they had he would probably\nhave gone through the exact same\nsituation\nthat's pretty crazy if you think about\nit forgive them father for they know not\nwhat they do they know not what they do\nthey cannot take another action because\ntheir life has brought them to this\nexact moment their life every single\nsecond every single experience brought\nthem to make that choice and if i was in\ntheir exact same circumstances i would\nactually make the exact same choice so\nforgive them because they know now what\nthey do so every person that has ever\n[ __ ] you over forgive them because\nthey did not know what they were doing\nbecause\nthey were doing the best with what they\nhad that our truest self\nshould see that a sick person needs\nhealing and maybe the person who hurt\nyou was sick in some sort of way so the\nego the ego sees an evil person that\nneeds to be punished your ego side is\nlike no they need to be punished for\nwhat they did as if that's going to help\nas if punishing really helps a whole lot\nof people no healing is what helps\npeople so the ego sees that's an evil\nperson that needs to be punished the\ntruest self sees that's a sick person\nthat's in need of healing because\neverybody wants happiness and peace\neveryone is doing what they believe will\nbring them that happiness and peace so\nif you judge somebody and this is where\nit really starts to get starts to get\ndeep if you as if we weren't deep enough\nif you judge somebody so if somebody\ncomes and they steal from you and you\njudge them for it and they were if\nsomebody were to be able to steal from\nyou and then you could have a\nconversation with them and yell at them\nand tell them about how much of a thief\nthey are that condemnation you\ncondemning them is actually\nstrengthening their belief in themselves\nas a thief which is going to make them\nmore likely to steal again in the future\nholy\nso when we don't forgive somebody we're\nactually strengthening that bad thing\ninside of them and not healing them in\nany sort of way\nexcuse me getting fired up over here so\nto judge and condemn somebody\nstrengthens their identification\nin whatever action that is so to judge\nand condensable condens condemn someone\nas a thief is actually strengthening\ntheir own identity as a thief to judge\nand condemn somebody is actually as a as\na cheater is actually strengthening\ntheir actions as a cheater and their own\nidentity as a cheater because at the\ncore we know that that person doesn't\nfeel good about what they did if they\nwere to do some psychedelics or an\nayahuasca journey that would pop right\nup into their head and they'd have to\nwork through it their truest self knows\nthat it's wrong so to judge and label\nsomeone as a thief or as a cheater as\nsomeone who whatever they did that was\nwrong to you strengthens their belief\nand that's what what in strengthens\ntheir own belief and that's what they\nare and so they are more likely to then\ndo it again so how do we heal that\nperson to heal that person and to love\nthem is them being able to become free\nfrom this false identity that they have\ncreated this false identity that has\nstolen them from good that has stolen\nthem from sinning that has stolen them\nfrom their true consciousness of good to\nbe able to love and forgive them gives\nthem the opportunity to see past the\nveil of what they were thinking that\nthey actually are to see who they truly\nare and when they can see who they truly\nare because they are loved and they are\nforgiven gives them an opportunity to go\nback to that innocence to go back to\nthat good to go back to that sanity so\nthe best thing that we can do to\nhelp somebody and to help ourselves who\nhas wronged us in the past is to forgive\nthem and to love them because it will\nheal you\nand also heal them\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well what\nis that doing for you to be sad\nabout one thing that happened in your\npast and you keep looking in the\nrearview mirror"
