    "transcript": "some poor phoneless fool is probably\nsitting next to a beautiful waterfall\nsomewhere totally unaware of how angry\nand scared he's supposed to be\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe root of all of the happiness that\nyou desire in your life\nthink about this for a second wouldn't\nit be amazing if you woke up every\nsingle day and you were just happy like\nwhat would that\nfeel like to wake up every single day\nyour alarm goes off maybe you wake up\neven before your alarm and you're like\noh [ __ ] this is amazing wouldn't that be\ngreat wouldn't it be wouldn't it be\nsomething that we all should shoot for\nis making our lives amazing to just be\nhappy all of the time and let's let me\ntake a step back we're not going to be\nhappy all of the time i understand that\nlet's be real about it but to be happy\nmore than we're not happy wouldn't it be\namazing to have it would be heaven on\nearth to be able to do that\nit'd be great but i want to bring in a\nquote i heard will smith say this on his\ninstagram uh not too long ago and he\nsaid happiness is not pleasure happiness\nis peace\nand so one of the things that i notice\nespecially in our western society is\nthat we search for pleasure we always\nwant to find more pleasurable things we\nwant to\nsearch for the pleasure we think that\nmoney is going to bring us happiness and\nmake us give us happiness and we think\nthat maybe if we get other people's\napproval other people's approval god\nthat'd be so good we're going to be so\nhappy once we get everybody's approval\nor you know what maybe if i get this\nreally nice car\npeople will think that i'm freaking\nawesome and then once i get that car and\npeople think i'm awesome then i'm gonna\nbe happy or once i become a millionaire\nthen i'm going to be happy\nand i'm going to feel better about\nmyself but until then\ni can't be happy yet people drink for\npleasure or to to not feel pain so they\nto get away from the pain they want to\nsee the pleasure that they want they\nseek the pleasure they want from\nobviously going out and going hey you\nknow i'm gonna i'm gonna drink and\nthat's gonna make me feel better some\npeople do drugs some people have sex and\nthey they search for these things these\npleasurable things which all of those\nthings can be pleasurable all of them\nare pleasurable like having a nice car\nyou know drinking can be pleasurable\ndoing some drugs can be pleasurable\nhaving sex to be pleasurable other\npeople's opinions of us and making\nthinking that we're awesome all of those\nthings can be pleasurable\nbut then we realize none of those things\nactually make us happy like you've heard\nit before money does not buy happiness i\nheard a quote the other day\nthat has never hit so home\nas this quote about money and it says\nthe only problems that money solves is\nmoney problems\nso if you think that getting rich is\ngoing to solve all your problems getting\nrich is only going to solve your money\nproblems but\nthen when you get rich\nyou realize you have a whole other set\nof money problems so just more problems\ncome up so your problems will not be\nsolved the only problems that will be\nsolved when you make money is money\nproblems but if that's the case if all\nthose pleasurable things don't make us\nhappy what will make us actually happy\nin what i think\nand what i heard will smith say where i\nwas like yeah that makes so much sense\nis peace\npeace will make us happy to wake up and\nfeel peace and not feel stressed not\nfeel worried not feel\nlike oh my god i've got to do this i've\ngot to do this i'm so stressed i'm so\nworried about the future and his\narmageddon coming and is you know is\ninflation going to make me poor and all\nof these things if we just be like\nah i'm just so peaceful wouldn't you\nfeel like you'd be happier if you were\nmore peaceful\nyou know because being around people\nthat bring in more peace will make you\nhappier whenever i start to think about\nthat then i go okay well if if peace is\nthe thing that's going to make me happy\nthen whatever disturbing my peace\nwhatever is disturbing my peace or\ngetting in the way of my peace\nis in the way of my happiness so\ntherefore what i should do is i should\nfigure out number one what is it that\nmakes me peaceful what is it that brings\nmore peace into my life and what is it\nthat gets in the way of my peace and\nmake a list of all of these things so\nthat i can then remove them because if i\ncan remove as many things as i possibly\ncan\nfrom my table of peace then my table's\ngonna be more peaceful it's like looking\nat a counter like i'm sitting at my\nkitchen island right now i'm sitting in\nmy kitchen island like recording this if\nthere was a bunch of all over the place\nand i went i just want to have a clean\ncounter what's the easiest thing to do\njust\nmove everything off and put it all away\nand clean the counter right so if we\nthink of our piece as this counter that\ni'm sitting at and go well this counter\nthat i'm sitting it's really dirty and i\nwant to get all this stuff off of it\nthis is my piece why don't i just remove\nall the things that are not bringing\npeace into my life so what we have to do\nis we have to make a list and figure out\nall of the things that are in the way of\nour piece so for all of you listening\nit'd be a really good idea if you're\nsitting at home if you're able to to get\nout of pen and paper and just start\nmaking a list of everything that's\ngetting in the way so many things get in\nthe way of our piece so i want to ask\nyou this question and i want you to\nwrite it down if you can what is\nstealing my peace and once i've\nidentified what those things are on that\nlist that are stealing my piece i need\nto have laser-like focus to avoid or get\nrid of anything that steals my piece\nanything that steals your piece needs to\nbe removed from your life so what is\nstealing your peace let's go through a\ncouple different things that could be\nstealing your peace\npeople\nare there people in your life that are\nstealing your peace\nare there people in your life that when\nyou are around them are like god i feel\nworse than i did 20 minutes ago before i\nhad that conversation with\njohn okay well if john is stealing your\npeace\ncan you spend a little bit less time\nwith john so that you can have more\npeace in your life if they're disrupting\nyour peace can you\nremove them in some sort of way\nwhat else can get in the way of your\npiece well first off\nbefore we switch and transition that if\npeople can steal your piece are there\npeople that add peace to your life are\nthere people that are in your life\nthey're just like man\nwhenever i'm around this person i feel\nso much better i feel so much more\npeaceful they bring like i've had people\nwhere i've left the room and be like\nwhoa\nmy energy feels amazing after being\naround that person and i'm not much of\nlike an energy person i've never been\nperson that really like feels a whole\nlot when it's like energy but there's\nsome people i've been around i'm like i\nfeel better after being around that\nperson are there people in your life\nthat are like that and can you bring\nmore of those people into your life\neither hang more hang out more with\nthose people but also add more people to\nyour life that will bring peace another\nthing could be stealing your peace what\nwe think in our heads are there things\nthat you say to yourself that steal\npeace from you is there worry that you\nhave that steals your peace are the\nthings that stress you out that bring\nyou peace that steal your peace\ndo you have\nshame in your life do you have guilt for\nthings that you've done in your past you\ncontinue to guilt yourself and shame\nyourself are there things that you think\nin your head that steal your peace if\nthere are write them down become aware\nof them and ask yourself how can i start\nremoving these things from my life to\nhave more peace what about the place you\nlive there's a place that you live does\nit bring you peace is there a city that\nyou live in is it that you're just like\ni hate this city i don't want to be here\nanymore if it's possible to move cities\nis it possible to move cities i'm not\nsaying you have to move like you know if\nyou have a family and a house and all\nthose things but you just hate the city\nthat you're in for whatever reason it\nmight be\ncan you start to make a transition plan\nto go what city would bring me what\nwhat's a city that i would love to live\nin that i would love to raise my family\nthat brings me peace that would bring my\nfamily peace\nis there\num\nany place that i could move to that\nwould bring out a more peaceful more\nbetter version of myself\nmaybe it's just the house that you live\nin\nyou know maybe you can identify i don't\nlike where i live and i've been there\nbefore i've been like i don't freaking\nlike this place i don't like the\nneighborhood that it's in i love the\ncity that i live in but the the house\nthat i live in this condo that i live in\nthe apartment i live in i don't like\nthis can i start to go hey what what\nwould be a more peaceful place maybe i\nmaybe i love being out in nature and i\nlive in the middle of downtown okay can\ni figure out a place that i would love\nto move to and see that if in the next\nyear to 18 months that i could move into\nthat place that was around more nature\nmaybe there's a walking trail that i can\ngo and go out into nature every single\nday and being in nature can bring me\nmore peace and start to make a plan of\nlike hey where i live and doesn't bring\nme peace is there a possibility that i\ncan switch out and move into a place\nthat would bring me more peace\nwhat about the news\ni know the answer to this question for\neverybody listening does the news bring\nyou peace or every single time you watch\nthe news are you like uh yeah i feel\nlike i don't about you guys but i was in\nuh i was in the store the other day and\nthey were they were playing the news and\ni was like\nthis is what people see all day like i\ndon't turn on the news i don't even have\ni have a tv but i don't have any way to\nwatch the news and i was like this is i\ni feel my piece being stolen from me in\nthe two minutes of the news being played\nit's like\ndestruction armageddon people hate each\nother this side versus this side this\nside's wrong this side's right you know\nit's divisive divisive devices does the\nnews\nbring you some form of you know does it\nsteal your piece away from you and if it\ndoes can you stop watching it can you\ndistance yourself from it same way that\na person that that is stealing your\npiece can you distance yourself from\nthem can you distance yourself from the\nnews there's a quote that i saw by\na little while ago by a guy named duncan\ntrussell and he says somewhere in the\nworld some poor phoneless fool is\nprobably sitting next to a beautiful\nwaterfall somewhere totally unaware of\nhow angry and scared he's supposed to be\nlike that's like the perfect example of\nthe news right now right there's some\npoor fool that's phoneless and is\nprobably sitting next to a beautiful\nwaterfall and they're totally unaware\nof how angry and how scared they're\nsupposed to be how angry at other people\nare supposed to be that don't think the\nsame way as them how scared they're\nsupposed to be with you know all of the\nstuff that could or could not be\nhappening in the world you're looking\nyou're like yeah there there probably is\ncan i be more like that person that's\nthat quote unquote ignorant fool that's\nsitting next to a waterfall that has no\nidea how angry or scared they're\nsupposed to be\nignorance sometimes is bliss\ni would like to be more ignorant of the\nnews i don't know about you another\nthing to think about social media\nif you've been following me for the past\nfew months you've i've dropped some\nseeds and kind of told you\nthat the unfollow button is my new best\nfriend i have hit the unfollow button\nway more than i've hit the follow button\nrecently on instagram i've unfollowed\nhundreds of people on instagram over the\npast few months i've unfriended friends\nlike people that i really actually truly\nknow i've unfriended family members i've\nunfriended people because i'm like this\nperson following them and seeing the\nstuff they're talking about seeing the\nstuff they're posting and the doom and\ngloom and this side and that side and\nblah blah blah seeing their stories make\nme feel worse they are stealing my peace\nunfollow i recently over the past about\nsix weeks have unfriended 3 000 people\non facebook i don't know how i got to 5\n000 people that are my friends on\nfacebook because a lot of them i was\nlike i don't know who the hell this\nperson is but i had 5 000 just under 5\n000 friends on facebook just under that\nlimit\nand i was like you know what i'm going\nto build my social media to reflect the\nworld that i want to see to remind me of\nwhat it is i'm working for i'm going to\nfollow motivational pages i'm going to\nfollow people who inspire me who make me\nwant to be better and if somebody if i\nhappen to see somebody's story on\ninstagram and i'm like oh\ni only if it's 15 seconds it's 30\nseconds i'm like i don't\nfeel more peaceful after seeing that in\nfact i feel the exact opposite can i\nstart to unfollow that person and i\nstarted to think about all of these\ndifferent pockets of my life the people\nthat are around me\ndo they add to my peace do they take\naway from my peace the place that i live\ndo they steal my peace do they add to my\npeace\nthe stuff that i think in my head does\nit steal my peace does it add to my\npeace and i went on this mission of just\nlike how can i build and be as\ndiligent as i possibly can to build as\nmuch peace into my life as possible\nto be intentional to seek peace\nin every single moment of my life if i\ncan because i don't need to know\neverything that's happening i don't need\nto know this person's side and that\nperson's side and how this person's\nfighting a cis person how there's\ndivisiveness and divisiveness and device\nin this what i want to do is i want to\nbe intentional of who i want to be\nand how i want to show up for the world\nand the compassion that i want to show\nother people knowing that there's a lot\nof people going through a lot of things\nright now there's a lot of changes that\nhave happened in the world i know who i\nwant to be and how i want to show up in\nthe world and can i just stick to that\nand pay attention to how i'm showing up\nin the world and not worry about the\nnews and not worry about the things in\nmy head that i'm saying and not worry\nabout people that i follow that stuff\nbut go you know what i'm going to make\nsure that i'm as diligent as possible to\nbring as much peace into my life as i\npossibly can\nthe thing that i think that we have to\nbecome very aware of\nand have a new mindset of is we must\nhave a very low tolerance for anything\nthat steals our peace\nyou must have a very low tolerance for\nanything that steals your peace it's not\neasy it's not easy to unfollow people\nthat you know that you've been friends\nfor a long time people that are in your\nfamily it's not easy to stop watching\nthe news and to kind of be unaware of\nwhat's happening\nit's not easy\nto do all of these things but it becomes\neasier and easier as you start to notice\nthat you feel better and better and\nbetter and when you feel better about\nyourself you go this is great i want to\ncontinue doing this i feel better today\nwhat did i do that brought me so much\npeace\nbecause if you look at the root of\neverything that we do getting more\nthings having more money having more\ndrugs having more drinking other\npeople's approval other people's\nopinions all those things all of the\npleasurable things that we think bring\nus happiness will never bring us\nhappiness what's going to bring you the\nmost happiness is to wake up every\nsingle day and feel joy and peace and\nlove that is what's going to bring the\nmost happiness into your life so how can\nyou have a very very low tolerance for\nanything that steals peace from you and\nto wake up every single day with the\nintention of i'm going to be as peaceful\nas possible and anything that makes me\nfeel different than peaceful needs to be\nremoved from my life\nthat is how you have more happiness in\nyour life\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastered your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well can\nyou be fulfilled\nwhere you are\nat this current moment with what you\nhave and still\nwant more\nthe answer is yes"
