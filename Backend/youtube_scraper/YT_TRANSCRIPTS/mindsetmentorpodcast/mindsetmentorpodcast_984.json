shot\nhave you been living your life as if\nmaybe you know if you think to baseball\nlike you're not on you're not at the\nbatter's box yet you're kind of on deck\nand maybe you know i'll get another\nchance i'll get another chance i'll get\nanother chance do you live your life as\nif you just happen to get another chance\nor do you live your life as if this is\nthe only thing that i know is that i\nhave it and i'm going to take full\nadvantage of it\ndo you follow your dreams or do you\nwatch netflix\ndo you work for the business that you\nwant to create or do you scroll on\ninstagram do you live your life as if\nthis is the only one that you have\nor do you live your life as just maybe\nyeah i'll get another chance someday\nknowing we all know that you don't get\nanother chance this is the one that you\nhave\nyou know there's so many people live as\nif tomorrow is just guaranteed one of\nthe things i've been pulling in as a\npractice to myself i did it this morning\nis i take about two minutes\nwhile i'm still laying in bed and i look\nup to the ceiling and i look there and\ni'm like thank you thank you thank you i\nfinally i get another day i get another\nday and for i mean 34 years of my life i\nnever did this i'm like i can't believe\ni get another day how amazing is it\nbecause there's so many times that i've\nwoken up in my life and i'm like\ni have so much stuff to do today i've\ngot so much i got to do i've got to go i\ndon't even i want to go meditate but i\nmight not even have time to meditate\nlike i've i got to go chug some coffee\nbecause i got call i got to hop on then\ni got to work out i'm going to do this\nthis this\nversus just sitting there for a second\nbeing like oh my god i woke up today how\nfreaking amazing is that\ndo you live your life as if you happen\nto get another one or do you live your\nlife as if you know this is it this is\nall that you got because so many people\nlive\nas if tomorrow is just guaranteed and\nyou know if you've heard me say the\nstatistics before 150 000 people did not\nwake up today that woke up yesterday 150\n000 people died\nyesterday\nyou did it you're listening to this are\nyou living today as if today is the very\nlast day of your life i remember i was\nlistening to a um\na great talk between um\nneil degrasse tyson and larry king i\nthink larry king just died if i'm not\nmistaken but um if he didn't holy crap\nthat guy's still alive but i don't know\nif he's alive or not probably google it\nbut uh neil degrasse tyson he was being\ninterviewed by larry king it was a few\nyears ago and larry king said\nthey were talking about life and life\nafter death and other planets and aliens\nand all kinds of stuff larry king said\nif you could live forever would you\nand neil degrasse tyson said no\nand then he asked larry king if he would\nand he said absolutely and neil degrasse\ntyson said\nthe reason why i wouldn't want to live\nforever is because if i live forever\nthen it gives me no urgency to do\nanything like death the um the death\nthat we're going to have\nbrings immediate\nuh urgency to my life and i think most\npeople don't live like that they don't\nlive and they don't think about how\ntheir death is coming to them like\nthey're it's every breath we get closer\ni'm not trying to be doom and gloom but\ni'm trying to be honest like when you\nthink to yourself it's going to happen\none day it makes me personally be like i\nneed to start working harder to do what\nit is i want to do make the impact in\nthe world to to change it in some sort\nof way to change myself to make the\npeople around me better\nyou might not wake up tomorrow and if\nyou didn't wake up tomorrow and you're\noff and wherever people go after they\ndie will you look and be like damn\nthere's so much more that i wanted to do\nthat i could have done but i just acted\nlike i didn't get another act like i was\ngoing to be here forever have you been\nliving your life as if you're just going\nto be here forever\nand you're just i'm just that immortal\nperson that stays here forever i can do\nwhatever the hell i want you know i'm\ngonna waste it on netflix i'm gonna\nwaste my instagram scrolling i'm gonna\nwaste it on doing things you know\nworrying about things that don't matter\nwhen 85 percent of the time none of\nthose things actually happen in the\nfirst place if you knew that today was\nyour last day\nwhat would you have missed out on in\nyour life\nif you knew today was the very last day\nof your life what would you have missed\nout on of the past\n20 30 40 50 60 70 years of your life\nwhat would you know that you missed out\non because you were acting like you\nmight get another shot you were not\nputting urgency to taking action in your\nlife\nwhat chances\ndidn't you take\nwhat things didn't you do on your bucket\nlist that you wanted to do but you were\ntelling yourself i'll get to it someday\ndown the road i'll try it later on i'll\nfigure it out sometime it's like the\nstory of a guy who he uh\nhe was going to retire he had saved all\nof this money for him and his wife to go\nand travel because her dream was to\ntravel so he was like you know what i'm\ngoing to get to retirement age and then\nwhat i'm going to do is then we're going\nto be able to go travel\nand so he works works works works works\ngets to this retirement agent in and\nhe's his wife's like all right well now\nyou can retire we can go out and do the\ntraveling we plan for he's like let me\nget just one more year i'll get one more\nyear so i feel that i'm fully\nresponsible like financially good to go\nresponsible we're locked in for life let\nme get one more year and then i swear to\nyou\n365 days from today\nwe're gonna go traveling and i'm gonna\nbe done\nand she's like okay you can do that and\nin those 365 days she died\nand he didn't get to travel with his\nwife the way they want to and now he's\nstuck there by himself having all of\nthese dreams and all these place he want\nto go to with his wife and now he's just\ngot his money but he doesn't have his\nwife and he doesn't have anyone to\ntravel with so are you living your life\nlike that as if you're just guaranteed\ntomorrow as if you're just guaranteed\nnext year what chances didn't you take\nwhat places if you died today what\nplaces did you not travel to that you've\nbeen wanting to travel to but you've\njust been pushing it off because there's\na couple other things a little bit more\nimportant at this part at this point in\nyour life what\nwere you not able to give your loved\nones what were you not able to give your\nchildren if you died today and you look\nback in the rest of your life\nwhat were you not able to give your\nspouse with your family what were you\nnot able to give them that you wanted to\ngive them but you were telling yourself\nit just wasn't the time yet and\ni want to be honest with you and i want\nyou to think about these things because\ni want to kind of shake you up sometimes\nlike i want to shake you up make you\nstart thinking about your life it's like\nwhen someone that you know\ndies\nand you go to their funeral you start\nthinking about your life a whole lot\nmore don't you\nyou start thinking about man\ni never thought they were going to die\nthey missed out on so many things how\nmany things have i missed out what if i\ndied\nand sometimes people make changes after\nsomeone's funeral\nsometimes they feel like they're gonna\nchange and then a couple weeks down the\nroad life just kind of goes back to\nnormal and they forget all about it but\nif i were to ask you on a scale of one\nto ten\none being like absolutely terrible ten\nbeing like the best possible life that\nanyone has ever lived in the history of\nmankind what would you rate your life as\nof right now and how much you've gotten\nout of your life up until this moment\nanswer the question what is it on scale\nof 1-10\nwhat would you rate your life as far as\nwhat you've done how much you've gotten\nout of it how much how many dreams\nyou've followed how many places you've\ntraveled how many bucket list items\nyou've knocked off\nwhat would you rate it on a scale of one\nto ten\nthink about that for a second\nhave you taken all the risks have you\ndone all of the things have you traveled\nall the places or\nhave you lived your life in fear have\nyou worried too much have you wasted too\nmuch time doing things that didn't\nmatter have you worried too much about\nwhat others would think about you and so\nyou've held yourself back because of\nthat you haven't followed your dreams\nwhich one is it\nand now looking forward\nwhich one would you like it to be you\nknow if you rate yourself as a six in\nyour life right now\nwhat's the difference between a six and\na eight\nand what would add an extra two points\nto that number over the next year to get\nyou two and eight what shifts and\nchanges and moves would you have to do\nin your life in order to get you to go\nfrom i think i'm a six out of a ten my\nlife to an eight out of ten in my life\none of the things that i love and i've\nheard this a couple times in a couple\ndifferent ways from a couple different\npeople\nis is if you imagine god has a checklist\nfor you right and he's just checking off\nall the things and it's like rob dial\nhe's gonna do this he's gonna do this\nhe's gonna do this he's gonna do this\nand it's all of the things that you\ncould possibly do and all the things you\ncould possibly be\nand you know some of them are checking\noff and some of them aren't everything\nthat you could do everything you could\nsee everything that you could achieve\nall of the lives that you could impact\nall the chances that you could take the\nfull on hell yes accomplish everything\nrob dial life is would it be for me and\nwhatever would be for you my goal is to\nget to the end of my life and to have\ngod have this checklist\nand go damn\nyou literally checked off all of them in\nsome of them that i didn't even have on\nhere\nlike you did even better than i thought\nyou were going to do that's what my goal\nis to do another example of the way i've\nheard it explained is\nis imagine\nthat your\nperfect self your most enlightened\nbadass\naccomplished everything did everything\nimpacted the lives made the money had\nthe success had the love had the joy\nbuilt the best family built the best\nbusinesses change the world as much as\npossible most enlightened version of\nyourself is waiting for you in heaven\nand you die\nmy goal is to get to the end to see that\nversion of me\nand we're twins\nnot to see that version be like oh sh i\ncould have done that\ni could have done that thing oh my god i\ndidn't i could have done that i don't\nwant to get to the end of my life and\nfeel like that's the way i want to feel\ni want to get to end of my life and see\nthe most enlightened the best did as\nmuch as they possibly could\nchange the world as much they possibly\ncould loved as much they possibly could\nbuilt the family they possibly could and\ni look at myself and i'm like\ni'm looking in a mirror\nwhat would that look like think of those\ntwo things what would the checklist look\nlike that god would have and what would\nyour twin look like that if you got to\nthe end of your life that you became you\nwere the twins with that person which is\nyour best highest most enlightened self\nwhat would that look like for you\nyou know what i would recommend is take\na pen and paper on literally just spend\nthe next 15 minutes put me on pause\njournal through this if you pause me\ni'll be here forever waiting for you\ni'll literally be here forever until you\ndecide to push play again pause me and\nwrite down all of the things that you\nwant to do that you should do that you\nknow you have the opportunity to do but\nyou just haven't been doing and you want\nto do\nso think about that for a second\nyou have to think about this and think\nokay if i rate myself at a level 6 out\nof 10 right now\nwhat would i need to do over the next\n365 days to bring that number up to that\neight that we're speaking about earlier\nwhat would i need to do okay you know\nwhat i need to do this job that i have\nit's it's so sucking it's not fulfilling\nin any sort of way and i know i've been\nwanting to do xyz\ni'm going to start making a plan and\nstart making movement into doing\nwhatever that thing is it might take a\nyear to transition out of my job so i\ncan pay my bills it might take two years\nbut at least i'm starting to make\nmovement\ninto the direction of what it feels like\ni'm actually truly supposed to do and if\nyou\ndon't know what it is you're supposed to\ndo you don't know what your true purpose\nand path in life is i always say this to\nto kind of give you the idea it's okay\nright now\nnot to know what your purpose is\nbut it's not okay to not wake up every\nsingle day and constantly be in the\npursuit of trying to find what that\npurpose is so if you don't know what\nyour purpose is right now no big deal\nmaybe you do maybe you don't but if\nyou're one of the people who doesn't\nknow what your purpose is then it is a\ncrime for you to wake up every single\nday and not be in constant freaking\npursuit to find out why the you're alive\nif you just wake up and do the same\nthing that you did yesterday and the day\nbefore that and the day before that it's\nan absolute crime if you don't know what\nyour purpose is that's okay but it is a\nabsolute crime if you wake up every\nsingle day and you're not in constant\npursuit to find what that thing is\nif we're planning out 365 days from\ntoday\nmake a checklist of all the things that\nyou need to do\nin order to move your life from a six\nout of ten to an eight out of ten what\ndo you want your body to look like\nyou know what if your body's a six out\nof ten what would an eight out of ten\nlook like what do you need to do to get\nthere\nwhat does your family look like at an\neight out of ten what do you use your\nrelationship with your children look\nlike at an eight out of ten what's your\nrelationship with your spouse look like\nat an eight out of ten what is a\nrelationship with your parents with your\nbrother sister cousins best friends what\ndoes that look like to become an eight\nout of ten what does your bank account\nlook like to go from a six to an eight\nout of ten what does your mindset look\nlike to go from a six to an eight out of\nten and what are all of the things that\nyou need to do and you need to\naccomplish and you need to be laser like\nfocused on over the next 365 days to\nbring yourself from a six to a ten\nbecause here's the thing that we all\nknow if we put work in we know we'll\nchange think of where you could be 365\ndays from today if you just started\ntoday what do you need to do to get\nthere how much work do you need to put\nin what things you need to check off\ndon't worry about the rest of your life\nbecause you're going to die one day if\nit's freaking happening so am i it's\nhappening right\ndon't worry about the rest of your life\njust worry don't worry about the next\n365 days plan for the next 365 days but\njust worry on today\nthink about today if i want to get to an\n8 out of 10 in my body what do i need to\ndo today to get myself from a six to a\nten or six two and eight\nin the next year what do i need to do\ntoday what's the first step that i need\nto take to get myself from a six to an\neight from six to an eight to move up a\ncouple different steps what does that\nlook like\nwhat does my mindset look like what does\nmy body look like what does my bank\naccount look like what does my business\nlook like what does my family look like\nwhat does my\nevery single relationship of my life\nlook like what does every single thing\nlook like if\nrob from six out of eight decided to\nshow up as rob or six out of ten decide\nto show up as rob of eight out of ten\nwhat is the difference in the delta\nbetween the six and the eight what is\nthe difference in my actions what is the\ndifference in my focus what is the\ndifference in every single thing every\nsingle thing that i do\nthink be what does that look like and\nhow do i need to make sure that i focus\non that today i don't care about the\nrest of your life i don't care about the\nnext 365 days i care about today and\nwhat you do today to shift yourself over\nthe next year to shift yourself over the\nnext five years over the next 10 years\nhopefully over the next 50 years but the\nonly thing that matters is just today\nnothing else matters because we don't\neven know if we're gonna get tomorrow\nbut what really matters is today how can\ni make sure that i get every single bit\nof everything\nout of today\nand that's all i gotta focus on and when\ni wake up tomorrow how can i get every\nsingle bit of happiness love joy peace\nsuccess everything out of tomorrow and\nthat's all that matters and if you do\nthis every single day every single day\nit'll stack and stack and stack and\nstack and stack on top of itself and\nthen you do wake up 365\ndays from today and you're like holy\nlife is completely different than it was\na year ago but only because the only\nthing that i focused on was every single\nday every single day because damn it i\nwoke up i'm grateful for that i woke up\nand i'm not going to give a kick in the\nface to god or the universe because i\ndecided to sit around and waste that\nwhat about you\nwhat is it 8 out of 10 look like what\ndoes a 9 out of 10 look like what does a\n10 out of 10 look like\nbecause you don't get another chance\nthis is the only one that you got stop\nliving your life as if you get another\nchance stop living your life as if\nyou're in the on deck circle because\nyou're in the batter's box\nthat is how you should be living your\nlife\nhey thanks so much for
