because no one's coming\nto save you there's not gonna be\nsomeone's gonna come and say hey you\nneed to wake up\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nto turn your life around and make\nsomething great from the life that\nyou're living and um\nyou know i want to tell you a story just\nto kind of put you into the mood\nlet's go back about 11 years ago so\nabout 11 years ago actually yeah just at\n11 years ago right now\ni lived in fort lauderdale this is in\n2010 and i went from at the beginning of\n2010 having an amazing business that was\ncrushing it and as a young kid i was you\nknow 23 24 years old at the time\n25 years old and i was on top of the\nworld i had a bunch of money in my bank\naccount i was doing really well\nand i put all of my money that i had in\nmy bank account back into my business\nand it failed\nmiserably and i mean like it was like a\nplane crash it went from like you know\nlike everything was amazing i was on\nthis rocket ship that was doing so\namazing and then it crashed\nway faster than actually even took off\nin the first place\ni almost lost my car i was five months\nbehind on my car payment i failed my\nbusiness there was you know i was burnt\nout from it i wasn't going back into it\ndidn't want to run it anymore and you\nknow if you've heard the story i lived\noff of pasta for two months i don't know\nhow the hell i did it thank god i was\ngiven the genes to be able to live off\nof walmart pasta for two freaking months\nbut that was all that i ate for the two\nmonths i ate you know it was 88 cents\nfor a box of pasta at walmart it was a\ndollar 88 for the pasta sauce that i had\nand i lived off of that for two months\nand um i remember i was going through\nall of this\nended up leaving the business you know\nstarted working with another company and\n[Music]\nreally just started working with the\ncompany just to make money and get\nmyself back on my feet and went through\nsome pretty terrible things in my life a\nlot of happened at the time and i\nremember i was sitting in my bathroom at\na\nin tampa florida in a two-bedroom\napartment i rented a room from a couple\nthat i met on craigslist and they had\ntheir room up for rent and i remember\nsitting there and i had you know no\nmoney i lost my successful business my\nidentity was attached to this successful\nbusiness so i thought i was a failure\ni'd gone through a terrible breakup and\nall of these things i remember sitting\nin my bathroom it was like this coming\nto god moment where i was like\nthis is terrible like i i see\nat this point why people kill themselves\nlike and i didn't want to kill myself i\nwasn't in that moment but i was like i\nsee like i see\nhow people feel when they're at this\nmoment and i feel like there's almost no\nway out of it it felt like i i had\nfallen into a hole and then kept digging\nand digging and digging for the past\neight months and i remember thinking to\nmyself\nthis moment came in and i was like i am\nthe only one that can fix this\nthat's it i am the only one that can fix\nthis there is no one else no one's going\nto come and save me no one's going to\ncome and\nmake me start having success or make me\ngo to the gym or make me work on myself\nor make me read a book or make me start\nmeditating or make me start journaling i\nam the only one that can fix this\ni can't rely on anybody else to quote\nunquote fix me and i'm going to tell you\nthe exact same thing no matter where you\nare in your life\nwhether it's good whether it's pretty\ngood whether it's not great whether it's\nterrible you are the only one that can\nfix it\nyou can't blame anybody else you can't\nsay it's anybody else's fault you can't\ntry to blame outside circumstance\nanymore you are the only one that can\nfix it and i remember sitting there and\ni remember thinking to myself i'm the\nonly one that can fix this i\nam going to figure out a way to make my\nlife great i'm not going to there's no\nway that i'm going to die\nhaving not done something amazing with\nmy life i'm gonna have to pick myself up\nand start working and put myself back\ntogether piece by piece by piece by\npiece and you fast forward now 11 years\nand now i've gotten to the point where i\ncan see\nthat moment was a huge moment in my life\nand it was the moment where it was like\ni have come to realize it is up to me i\ncan't blame anybody else i can't blame\nmy mom i can't blame the government i\ncan't blame my ex-business that i was\nworking with i can't blame the market i\ncan't blame the government can't blame\nthe president can't blame anybody else i\nhave to blame myself and i fast forward\n11 years and it's like\nit worked like it actually worked it\nliterally worked because people can see\nyou know followers that i have online\nand you know 100 million downloads of a\npodcast and the business that we've\nbuilt and all of those things and they\ncan look and be like well that that must\nbe nice it must be easy good i wish that\ni would have had it handed to me i'll\nsay those two things number one none of\nit was easy and number two none of it\nactually matters in the first place like\nthe amount of people that follow me\nonline the amount of money in a bank\naccount the amount of a business that\ndoes something none of those things\nactually truly matters what matters is\nthe way that i view myself in the\nactions that i take each day and it took\nmore than anything else full belief in\nmyself and pushing through and so i want\nto talk to you no matter where you are\nin your life and use that story to\nhopefully inspire you to do something\namazing with yourself as well no matter\nwhere you are in your life this is my\nfavorite way to look at life i like to\nlook at life i've heard joe rogan talk\nabout it as if life is just a movie like\nit's just this movie and i imagine that\nthere's just spectators watching the\nlife of rob dial and i want you to\nimagine they're spectators watching the\nlife of\nyour name\nwhat does the life of your name look\nlike the idea that he says that i've\nheard joe rogan say\nis to be the hero of your own story\nwhen you're in that moment where things\nare hard when things are not working out\nyou have to decide that i'm going to be\nthe hero of my own story no one's going\nto come in and save me there's no\nsuperman or iron man coming in to save\nme and marvel comics to come in and make\nmy life amazing in this movie i'm the\nonly character that people are following\nand you have to imagine that your life\nis a movie right now because\nwhether it's good and you want to make\nit even better that's inspiring whether\nit's pretty good and things are okay but\nyou want to make it even better that's\ninspiring whether it's terrible and\nthings are just in shambles but you know\nyou want to make it better you have to\ndecide to be the person to do it you are\nthe hero of this story and i always\nthink about the movie that's just so\ninspiring to so many people that really\nhits home is the movie the pursuit of\nhappiness where you see will smith's\ncharacter\nand he's inside of the the bathroom and\nthe bus station with his son and it's\nlike you\nsee somebody hit rock bottom and you see\nhim sleeping on the bathroom of a bus\nstation with his son and he's got\nnowhere to go he's got nothing to do and\nhe decides at that moment he's crying\nand it's a super emotional part of the\nmovie of i'm going to do this there's no\none else that's going to help me succeed\ni have to be the person that's\nsucceeding but what's going to make it\neasier\nknowing that no one's going to come and\nsave you is imagine that there's a ton\nof people watching you imagine there's\npeople watching everything that you're\ndoing throughout each day i asked this\non a zoom call i was on yesterday\nthere's about 100 people that were there\nand i said hey would you do something\ndifferent with the past you know every\nweek i'm on the zoom call and i said hey\nwould you have done different stuff if i\nwas following you around every single\nday last week and every single person's\nlike yes absolutely if i was following\nyou around and i was trying to help you\nbuild your business and i'm watching you\nin every single action would you have\ndone some things differently last week\neveryone's like yes i'm like why does it\nmatter if i'm there or not why does it\nmatter if i'm watching because you know\nwho is watching the most important\nperson you and the actions that you take\nwill either build your confidence that\nyou can do this or strip away your\nconfidence you know if you\nhave your alarm go off at six a.m and\nyou hit the snooze button and you hit\nthe snooze button and you hit the snooze\nbutton you are losing confidence in\nyourself because when you were fully\nconscious and awake the night before\nyou made a decision that you were going\nto wake up at 6 a.m but you decided to\nbreak a contract with yourself a little\ntiny mini contract when you decide i'm\ngoing to work out for you know 45\nminutes today and you don't show up\nor you go to the gym and you only work\nout for 20 minutes you have broken a\nmini contract with yourself when you\ndecide you know what i'm going to go\nahead and i'm going to create my first\npodcast episode and you've been delaying\nit for months and months and months and\nmonths you are breaking mini contracts\nwith yourself so you have to understand\nthat it doesn't matter if i'm watching\nit doesn't matter if anybody else is\nwatching what matters is that you are\nconstantly watching but if it makes you\nfeel a little bit better imagine that\nthere's a theater of a hundred people\nwatching every single thing that you do\nyes\neverything even the weird things that\nyou do they're watching it and they're\npaying attention and they want you they\njust want this story to be good they\nwant to feel good when they move leave\nthe movie theater they want to feel\nmoved to tears about yes they did it i'm\nso happy for them i'm so glad that they\nended up taking their life from where it\nwas and creating something that is so\namazing imagine that there's a room full\nof people that are rooting for you\nthey want to see you win\nthey're watching every single move you\nknow oh man\nthey they said that they're going to\nwake up at 6 a.m they woke up at 6 a.m\nthey said that they were gonna do the\nworkout they did their workout look at\nthem they're starting to put all the\npieces together they're starting to pick\nthemselves out of the shambles of their\nlife they're like the phoenix they're\ncoming back from the fiery you know\ncrash that they've created of their life\nthey're coming up like a phoenix so it's\nthe question is are you going to wake up\nwhen your alarm goes off are you going\nto go to the gym\nor are you going to stay scrolling on\ninstagram are you going to\nwatch netflix\nor you're going to put the extra two\nhours that you need to into your\nbusiness after putting the kids down\ndo it for them do it for the kids\nknowing that they're eventually going to\nwatch this movie they're going to be\nthey're participants in this movie and\nthey're going to see the ending of this\nmovie at some point in time the question\nis is it a movie that your children are\ngoing to watch and they're going to be\nproud of seeing their parent do that\nwhat are you going to do are you going\nto sit there and just sit back and just\nallow life to happen to you and blame\neverybody else and blame external\ncircumstances and act like yeah woe is\nme i'm a victim the world is happening\nto me all of this stuff are you gonna go\nyou know what everything that's\nhappening is happening for me i'm gonna\npick myself up and i'm gonna work i'm\ngonna pick myself up i'm gonna work my\ndust off myself every single day\nand i'm going to work towards what it is\nthat i want because no one's coming to\nsave you\nthere's not going to be someone's going\nto come and say hey you need to wake up\nno one's going to make you read that\nbook no one's going to make you invest\ninto that course no one's going to make\nyou\ngo to that conference to learn about how\nto start that new business no one's\ncoming to save you and no one will ever\ncome to save you but you have an entire\naudience of people who are rooting you\non who want to see you do well with your\nlife they want you to be the hero of\nyour own story and you're at that\nbreaking point right now where it's like\ni either go left or i go right going\nleft is going to take me and it's going\nto be the exact same thing i've been\ndoing my entire life the same fears the\nsame limiting beliefs the same\njudgments of myself the same blaming\nother people the same making excuses in\neverything that i do you could go left\nor you could go right and that's taking\nfull ownership for yourself taking full\nownership for your life deciding that\nyou will no longer blame external\ncircumstances for anything\nand you're going to become the ceo of\nyour life if you've been listening long\nenough i always talk about the phrase\nthe ceo of your life it was a coming to\ngod moment that my very first mentor had\nhad with me in its simplest terms i was\nmaking excuses i wasn't showing up on\ntime to calls i wasn't hitting my goals\ni wasn't paying my projections and i was\nmaking all of these excuses i'm like i\nwas a professional\nexcuse maker and i was really damn good\nat enough that i believed myself all the\ntime of excuses why i'm not getting what\nit is that i want and why my life isn't\nwhat i want it to be and he had a coming\nof god moment with me and he said rob\ni got a question for you if a business\nfails whose fault is it and i said it's\nthe ceo's fault he said if a business\nsucceeds whose fault is it and i said i\nguess it's the ceo's fault he said okay\nif you get to the end of your life\nand you look back at your life and\nyou're like that was a\nfailure\ni didn't do anything that i wanted to do\nit was even close to life that i could\nbuild for myself\nand i failed\nand you're sitting there on your\ndeathbed you're feeling those feelings\nwhose fault is that i was like that's my\nfault he said okay but if you get to the\nend of your life and you're surrounded\nby a bunch of people that love you and\nyou're looking at your life and thinking\nof how amazing you made it and it was it\nwas a full success in every single\naspect of the word whose fault is it i\nsaid that would be my fault and he said\nexactly so the problem is is you're not\nliving your life as if you're the ceo of\nyour of your life you're not living your\nlife as a ceo you have no one else to\nblame there is no one else that's going\nto come and save you you have to take\nfull control and full acceptance for\nevery single thing that you do ceo of\nyour life means that if it's a success\nor if it's a failure you take full blame\nfor every single thing that you do\nthat is how you become the hero of your\nown story because ultimately the thing\nthat you have to realize i say it all\nthe time no one's going to come and save\nyou but the choice is yours and whatever\nyou choose is fine\nbut the question is is it what you\nactually truly deep down inside want or\nis it just what you're used to if you\nwant to stay in bed\nstay in bed dude if you want to go on\ninstagram and waste two hours a day on\ninstagram then waste two hours a day on\ninstagram if you want to\nlay in your bed all weekend and all\nevening every evening and just watch\nnetflix do it\nbut if you want to create greatness in\nyour life if you want to create\nsomething amazing if you want to create\nsomething inspiring if you want to look\nback in your death bed and think to\nyourself holy sh look at what i've\ncreated you have to be the hero of your\nown story you have to step up you have\nto learn to stop blaming other people\nand you've got to decide to step into\nwhat it is that you truly can be because\nthe time is now you can either choose to\ngo left where it is the same thing that\nyou've been getting forever and you're\ngoing to continue to get the same thing\nforever until you make a change or you\ncan go right and that right is to become\nthe ceo of your life to become the hero\nof your own story to imagine there's\npeople watching you at all points in\ntime and they're rooting for you they\nwant you to do well they want you to\nsucceed they're watching every single\nmoment and they're saying oh man they're\ndoing what they said they're gonna they\nfell a little bit there but they got\nthemselves back up and they kept going\nand so you've got to decide are you\ngoing to be the hero of your own story\nare you going to be the victim of\nexternal circumstances\nthe choice is yours\ni just hope that you choose the right\nthing for you\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well we\nhave all of the excuses we're all so\nbusy oh i don't have enough time to say\nthat you don't have time\nbut you have a netflix subscription then\nyou watch it that's [ __ ] you're\nlying to yourself"
