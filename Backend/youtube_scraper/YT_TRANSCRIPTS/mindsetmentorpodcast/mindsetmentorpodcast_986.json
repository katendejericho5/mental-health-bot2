    "transcript": "the reason why this is so important is\nbecause then you realize that the stress\nand anxiety that you might have going\ninto today\ndisappears\ntoday i'm going to be telling you the\nfirst thing that i want you to do every\nsingle morning and we all know at this\npoint in time i think it's pretty\nobvious to everybody if you're in\npersonal growth or you've been working\non yourself for a little while that your\nmorning routine is extremely extremely\nimportant in the way that you greet the\nmorning is basically going to set a\nprecedent for how the rest of the day is\ngoing to go for you now if you have a\nmorning can you still have a great day\nyeah of course\nbut if you have a great morning will it\nmake it easier to have a great day yes\nof course and so what i want to talk to\nyou is what i think is the most\nimportant thing that you should do every\nsingle morning\nin the way that i see a morning routine\ni've been doing this for years my very\none of my very first mentors his name is\nhal elrod he actually wrote the book the\nmiracle morning which is the guy who\nblew up by talking about morning\nroutines\nand that's when really people started to\ntake morning routines really seriously\nso i've been doing morning routines for\na while about nine years now i've been\nfocused on him and a lot of times\na lot of people and i've felt this way\nmany times on my own\nfeel that a morning routine is basically\nlike waking up to get a to-do list done\nto get their checklist done which i\ndon't think necessarily is very\ninspiring i don't think you're really\ninspired to wake up to go okay i've got\nto meditate and then i've got to read\ni've gotta do this and i've gotta do\nthis i'm gonna do this and hopefully i\nhave enough time to get all that done\nthat's not very inspiring to wake up to\na to-do list and so if you find yourself\nnot being motivated to get up earlier to\ndo your morning routine maybe it's\nbecause the morning routine itself isn't\ninspiring to you the way that i've come\nto find what i want my morning routine\nto be is how i want to set my body in my\nmind to feel for the rest of the day and\nso if i wake up and i've immediately got\nto go to meditating and i've got to go\nto journaling and i've got to go to this\nand i've got to go to this and i've got\n10 different things that i have to do\nit's kind of it's kind of like a hurried\nfeeling and i don't want to be hurried\nthroughout my entire day and so what\ni've done over the years is i've gone\nfrom doing a lot of things in the\nmorning to doing just a few things in\nthe morning based off of how i want to\nset myself up to feel we all know\nthat first impressions are everything\nwhen you meet somebody that person in if\nit's an amazing experience to them\nyou're usually going to have a great\nfeeling towards them the rest of the\ntime that you know them if you had a\nreally bad first experience you might\nnever even want another second\nexperience with this person so first\nimpressions are everything what is your\nfirst impression of every single day\nwhen you wake up you know are you\njumping out of bed and you're grateful\nand you're excited to to to start your\nday or do you hit the snooze button like\ndamn it you know i don't want to get up\nyet i'm not ready to get up yet and so\nwhat we want to do is we want to help\nyou build a morning routine that\nactually gets you excited to wake up in\nthe morning where instead of being like\ndamn it my alarm's going off now i've\ngot to go up and i've got to turn it off\nand i've got to do all of these things\nit's like hey what would be something\nthat you're almost like wanting to get\nout of bed remember when you were a kid\nand there was christmas for those of you\nguys that celebrated christmas and like\nsanta would come and you couldn't sleep\nthe night before like what if you had\nthat feeling of you're about to wake up\nand go get christmas gifts every single\nmorning if if you were to have that\nfeeling\nthe moment that your alarm clock goes\noff how can you create a morning routine\nthat feels like that you know and part\nof it is this i think it's very\nimportant as far as the way that you\nwake up in the morning is you've got to\nget up with your very first alarm don't\nhit the snooze don't hit it two three\nfour five times when your alarm clock\ngoes off you've got to get up because\nyou've got to think about this for a\nsecond you as a fully conscious being\nset an alarm before you went to bed you\nwere fully awake and conscious at that\nmoment now\nyou're deciding as a not fully conscious\nbeing why you should be staying in bed\nand so what happens is when you when you\nhit your snooze button you're\nautomatically starting the very first\nsecond of your day off with a little bit\nof a loss now is it a huge loss no but\nis it a little bit of a loss do you lose\na little bit of confidence in yourself\nbecause you didn't follow through the\nway that you wanted to when you went to\nbed\nabsolutely and so you've got to think\nabout how each action that you take sets\nyour rest your day off so if you wake up\nand you wake up on the very first alarm\nand you get up and you brush your teeth\nyou go to the bathroom and you start\nyour morning routine that immediately is\na little bit of a win and so how can you\nset yourself up to win in every single\ncircumstance and so\nanother example would be you know your\nalarm clock goes off and you get up when\nyour alarm clock goes off then maybe you\nget up and you brush your teeth you go\nto the bathroom and then before you\nleave your room\nyou make your bed now i'll be honest\nwith you i don't give a damn about the\nway my bed looks all i do in my bedroom\nis sleep there's nothing else i don't\nwatch tv in there i don't hang out in\nthere all i do is sleep so there's\nreally actually no reason for me to make\nmy bed the only reason why i make my bed\nis to actually feel like i'm completing\na task i'm following through on getting\nsomething done that i did and that's it\nand so the way that i see it is the same\nway that i wake up and i get up the very\nfirst time my alarm goes off well then\nif i wake up and i'm also getting up in\nand making my bed right after\ni have now gotten two wins before i even\nleave my bedroom so now i'm already\nstarting to feel like hey\nrob you're getting some done today and\nso you've got to finish the task of each\nthing that you do and it sounds small it\nis super small it's not a huge deal it's\nnot going to be life-changing but the\nway you do one thing is the way you do\neverything if you're not making your bed\nif you're not waking up on time and\nyou're hitting the snooze button you're\ndoing this in other areas of life you're\nnot fully following through in every\nsingle thing that you're doing if you're\nnot following through on the tiny things\nin life i'm positive that you're not\nfollowing through on a lot of the big\nthings in life the way you do one thing\nis the way you do everything so when\nyour alarm goes off get up when you get\nout of bed make sure that you make it\nand the idea\nis to feel like you're leaning forward\nthis is an idea and you've heard me talk\nabout the podcast before but the idea of\nleaning forward you're on your your\nfront foot versus your back foot you're\nstarting your day off intentionally\nversus reactively so you're proactive\nversus reactive you're getting up on\ntime you're making the bet you have your\nmorning routine decided what you're\ngoing to be doing and you wake up and\nyou start leaning forward you start the\nday on the offensive side versus on the\ndefensive side and i've lived the\nmajority of my life except for the past\nseven years i would say\non the defensive side waking up and just\ngoing about the life that i'm given and\nthe day that i'm given versus waking up\nand actually being on the offensive side\nand feeling like i'm on my front foot\nand i'm leaning forward with everything\nthat i do when you don't wake up on time\nand you don't make your bed and and all\nof this stuff you're on your back foot\nyou want to be on your front foot it's\nthe small rental mental winds that you\nhave every single day now here's what i\ndo the thing that i've started to to\nreally\npay attention to\nis how i feel\nabout my entire life and so instead of\nwaking up and feeling like i have to go\nand accomplish which i felt this way for\nyears and years and years feeling like i\nhave to wake up and accomplish and\naccomplish and accomplish and accomplish\nwhat i've actually started doing over\nthe past few years is waking up and\nliterally thinking about how grateful i\nam for everything that i have that's it\nand just starting my day off in\ngratitude in some sort of way and so as\ni'm going you know brushing my teeth and\ngoing to the bathroom and drinking my\nwater and making the bed and doing all\nof those things i actually try to bring\ninto the forefront of my mind all of the\nthings that i have that i can be\ngrateful for and you don't have to be\nrich or a millionaire or have a you know\na banging body or the most the hottest\nuh significant other in order to be\ngrateful for something like you have\nmany things to be grateful for if you're\nlistening to this podcast right now\nwhich you are you have many things to be\ngrateful for that many people in the\nworld do not have how can you bring\nthose things to the front of your mind\nbecause what i've tend to find out is\nthat when you bring in gratitude\nwhile you're brushing your teeth while\nyou're going to the bathroom while\nyou're drinking your water while you're\nyou know making the bed everything that\nyou're doing\nyou're starting to actually set your day\noff to feel\npeace\nand joy\nversus feeling like stress and agitation\nwhich is what a lot of people feel\nthroughout the day and so once again\nfrom the very beginning of the moment i\nwake up i'm trying to set my body in my\nbrain as to how i want to feel and then\nwhat i do is i come out if you're\nwatching this video and you're on you\nknow facebook or instagram or youtube\nbehind me is my living room and so i go\ninto my living room and my fiance and i\nmeditate every single morning we turn on\nyou know either guided meditation or we\nput on 20-minute\nmeditation music and we meditate every\nsingle morning and the feeling that i\ntry to bring into my body is the exact\nsame feeling that i try to feel when i\nwake up in the morning i'm trying to\nthink of all of the things that i'm\ngrateful for all of the stuff that's\nbeen amazing for me how i've been so\nblessed in my life one of the things\nthat i've become really grateful for is\nall of my challenges and everything that\ni up in because it's easy to be\ngrateful for things that went really\nwell but it's harder to be grateful for\nthe challenges it's hard to be grateful\nfor people that have screwed you over in\nsome sort of way\nin my mind what i'm trying to do is\nbring in every single circumstance\nthat's made me into who i am that's\nhappened in my life and try to feel\ngrateful for it so i literally try to\nfeel the feelings in the center of my\nchest and so i try to feel the feelings\nof gratitude and uh and and i just what\ni've come to find out\nis that when you think about things that\nyou're grateful for and you think about\nall the stuff that you've had and you\nthink about all of the things that have\nbrought you to the to the life that you\ncurrently have\nthey all worked out perfectly and you\nstart to realize the phrase that you\nknow you guys heard me say before is\nyou know peter crone says this it's not\nme is that it couldn't have happened\nwhat happened happened and could not\nhave happened any other way because it\ndidn't so what happened happened it\ncould not have happened any other way\nbecause it didn't and the reason why i\nlove that is because you start to\nrealize when you sit back\nand you start to think about what you're\ngrateful for you start to realize how\nevery single thing that's happened to\nyou in your life has been perfect like\nit's like a perfect perfectly crafted\ncurriculum for you to be you know in the\nschool of you who you are exactly like\ni've had the perfect curricula for the\nschool of being rob dial the reason why\nthis is so important is because then you\nrealize that the stress and anxiety that\nyou might have going into today\ndisappears and the reason why is because\nyou've realized that everything that's\never happened to you you've handled\nperfectly\nwith the best that you possibly could\nand so no matter what happens to the\nentire rest of the day you're going to\nhandle perfectly at the best capacity\nthat you can and so there's no reason to\nhave stress there's no reason to have\nanxiety because you're going to handle\nit perfectly because everything that's\never happened to you you've handled\nperfectly before because everything\nhappened perfectly in your life what\nhappened happened it couldn't have\nhappened any other way because it didn't\nand when you start to bring those\nthoughts into your brain your body\nstarts to release chemicals the hormones\ninside of your body that go with that so\nif you start to think very stressful\nthoughts and what you have to do on your\nto-do list and people that have things\ngoing on and how the you know the\nweather is outside you're gonna start to\nrelease the chemicals the hormones\ninside of your body that are adrenaline\nand cortisol and make you feel like crap\nthe stress hormones is what you're going\nto release when you sit down\nand you go you know what i have so much\nto be grateful for my life has been\nperfect no matter what happens to me\ntoday i'm going to handle it perfectly\nbecause i've handled everything\nperfectly to the best of my capacity\nthen you start to go you know what\nthe beautiful thing about this\nis that i'm creating all of these\nthoughts which are then also creating\nall of these hormones inside of my body\nthat's releasing dopamine that's\nreleasing serotonin and instead of\nfeeling bad and anxious and stressful in\nthe morning i feel great i feel great i\nfeel peaceful i feel joy feel the joy\nand you start to realize that what you\nfocus on you're going to get more of so\nif i wake up in the morning and i start\nto start thinking about the stressful\nthoughts and how i'm reactive and how\ni'm have so many things that i have to\ndo and i'm stressed out about that i\nhave the negative thoughts around that\ni'm going to find more negative when i\nleave my house and i'm on my way to work\nand i'm in the world and i'm starting to\nwork with people but if i wake up and i\nthink about what to be grateful for and\nall the stuff that's amazing in my life\nand i set my\ngps same way if i set my gps to go in my\ncar to go somewhere but i'm setting my\ngps to literally see all the things that\ni can be grateful for\nwhat's crazy is you go through the rest\nof your day\nstarting to see more things that you'd\nbe grateful for so not only is your\nmorning routine amazing and you feel\namazing and joyful and peaceful from\ndoing it but you start to notice all of\nthe other amazing stuff in your life\nthat you also have to be grateful for\nthroughout the rest of your day and so\nthat peace and that joy carries on\nthroughout the rest of your day so the\nway that you start your morning if it's\nstressed and anxious and late and all\nthat stuff it's going to carry on\nthrough the rest of the day but if you\nstart with gratitude and joy and peace\nand love and all the things that you\nwant to bring in you're going to find\nmore of those things to have gratitude\nfor and peace and love for throughout\nthe rest of your day what you appreciate\nappreciates so the question is\nare you appreciating and focusing on the\nthings that you want to get more of or\nare you focusing on things you don't\nwant to get more of right and you gotta\nthink about your your morning routine as\nsetting yourself up for feeling the way\nthat you want to feel throughout the day\nbecause doesn't it just sound nice\ndoesn't it sound nice just wake up and\njust to number one accomplish a couple\nsmall tasks to get to wake up on time\nwhen you said you're going to hey that's\na small win so then going into the next\nthing of hey now i'm going to make my\nbed that's a small win and then when you\nbrush your teeth you're going to the\nbathroom and you're drinking your water\nand all of making your coffee or doing\nwhatever it is that you're doing you're\nthinking about all the things you'd be\ngrateful for and then you go in your\nmeditation or your visualization or just\nsitting down and enjoying your cup of\ncoffee and you're thinking about all of\nthe things that are amazing that you\nhave to be grateful for and you start to\nthink about your challenges in life you\nstart to go i'm so glad that i did have\nthat challenge i'm so glad that that\nperson did break my heart because then\nit set me up to know what i want for my\nnext relationship and what happens is\nyou start to really\nset up the way that you want your life\nto be and your date to be doesn't that\nsound nice so the thing that i would\nrecommend for you is to just be fully\npresent more often and to appreciate\nwhat's going on around you and to use\nyour morning routine as an opportunity\nto set yourself up to feel the way that\nyou want to feel to program yourself\nyour feelings your thoughts your actions\nyour reactions to be the way that you\nwant them to be throughout the day you\nget rid of your anxious feelings you get\nrid of all of your worrying because you\nrealize that where you are is great it's\nperfect and you're not where you want to\nbe yet\ni'm sure if you listen to podcasts you\nstill want to be further along but the\nbeautiful thing is you know that you'll\neventually get to where you want to be\nbecause\nyou're where you are right now because\nof everything that you've done and if\nyou focus on all the things to be\ngrateful for you'll eventually get to\nthe point of where you want to be and\neverything will work out perfectly\nexactly that she's supposed to so\ninstead of feeling like you have to wake\nup and check off a to-do list\nset your gps as to how you want to feel\nevery morning and if you set your gps as\nto how you want to feel how amazing this\nmoment is how it's only going to get\nbetter your life is going to get more\namazing and it's only going to get\nbetter with every single thing that you\ndo so that is the way that i want you to\nstart your morning\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well you\nwoke up 150 000 people didn't wake up\nyesterday
