    "transcript": "fear is not real the only place where\nfear can exist is our thoughts of the\nfuture danger is very real but fear is a\nchoice\ntoday we're gonna be talking about three\nways to get past your fears now why is\nit important to make sure you get past\nyour fears well\nmost people they feel some sort of fear\nand then they allow that to stop them in\nsome sort of way they don't take the\nsteps needed to achieve their dreams\nthey don't take the steps needed to ask\nthat person out to take whatever action\nthat they need to in order to create the\nlife that they want and most people will\ndo anything they possibly can to avoid\nfears and these could be good fears they\nshould be bad fears they just decide hey\ni'm just going to avoid them at all\ncosts and\nthe thing that's really interesting is\nand you've heard me say before i've been\nlistening long enough i hate when\nsomeone says hey let's let's give it up\nfor our fearless leader john\nthinking that the ceo or the leader of\nwhatever it is is some fearless person\nthat's out there and they don't feel any\nfear they just take action and i think\nthat's ridiculous because successful\npeople feel fear\njust as much as everybody else does the\nonly difference is they don't allow that\nfear to hold them back from what it is\nthat they want to do or what it is that\nthey need to do and so you have to\nrealize that people who are successful\nwhatever success means to you i can say\nquotation marks success those people\nhave just found a way to work with their\nfears and that's what we're going to\ntalk about today is to understand that\nyour fears exist but to kind of work\nwith them a little bit easier most of\nthe fears that we have today are not\nlife-threatening in any sort of way\nhumans themselves you were only born\nwith two different fears you were born\nwith the fear of falling and you were\nborn with the fear of loud noises so\nyou're born with the the reaction if\nyou've ever had a baby in your hands\nthey have the reaction where if you know\nthere's a slight movement they think\nthey're falling they're afraid of that\nor if there's a big bang somewhere the\nbaby will start crying other than that\nthere are no other fears that are innate\ninside of a human so like the fear of\njudgment or the fear of rejection the\nfear of you know other people's opinions\nor the fear of what their mom will think\nof them those are things that are\nlearned along the way everything else we\nlearn fears are just false expectations\nappearing real it's all completely false\nin the fears that we have nowadays the\nfalse fears the false expectations\nappearing real\nnone of them are life-threatening so if\nyou think about today what the when i\nhave whenever i ask people i'm talking\nin front of a group of people and say\nhey what is your number one fear what i\nusually hear is fear of rejection fear\nof failure fear of success fear of not\nbeing good enough not making enough\nmoney to support my children fear of my\nspouse leaving me fear of not being\nloved all of those\nare not none of those that i just\nmentioned are life-threatening any sort\nof ways but i just got 95 percent of\npeople's fears\nout of the way right there\nnone of them are life-threatening and so\nfear originally is a signal that you\nhave potential death on the end of\nsomething and so if you were to have\nfeel fear because you're walking through\na forest in the middle of the night and\nyou hear a rustling in a bush that's\nbecause there could be potential death\non the other side of that bush but if\nyou're thinking about i don't know if i\nshould post this post on instagram\nbecause i'm worried about what my\nfriends will think of me there is no\npotential death attached to posting\nsomething on instagram right so most of\nthe fears that we feel fears that we\nfeel are signals that we're out of our\ncomfort zone not that there's a\npotential death but that there's that\nit's that we're out of our comfort zone\nnot that there's potential death in that\nsituation but potential growth and\nthat's a really good thing to realize\nwhen you realize that the fears that\nyou're feeling\ndon't have potential death even though\nyou'll feel the physical feelings of hey\nsomething might actually happen to me\ni'm afraid of what could happen instead\nof feeling that you can feel it and go\nhuh there's not potential death attached\nto this fear right now there's potential\ngrowth there's growth on the other side\nof me feeling this fear and the reason\nwhy we feel this is because every human\nhas something inside of your brain in\nthe limbic system called the amygdala\nand the amygdala is basically just the\nfear generator inside of your brain to\nkeep you away from danger and your fear\ngenerator is working all the time\nbut the difference is it's not 200 000\nyears ago and we don't have to be\nworried about a lion jumping out of a\nbush and attacking us\nor you know something coming out and\nattacking our children as we're walking\nby you know\nwalking inside of the woods that are by\nour house most of the time\nthe fear that is generated from the\namygdala doesn't have anything to do\nwith potential death\nbut it's still working so if you're\ninside of your house and you're\ncompletely safe and you're fed and you\nhave shelter and water and everything\nthat you need your amygdala is still\nrunning and your amygdala is still\nsearching for fears at all points in\ntime so it's literally generating things\nto be afraid of and so if you're\nthinking to yourself i want to post this\nvulnerable post on instagram because\nmaybe some people can relate\nand you feel the feelings of fear you\nhave to realize that's a good thing\nbecause there's no potential death on\nthe other side of you posting i think on\ninstagram but what there is is there's\npotential growth on you posting another\nthing on instagram or if you're gonna go\nmake some sales calls because you need\nto make sales calls for your company to\nmake more money there's no potential\ndeath by making a cold call no one's\ngoing to call you you're not going to\ncall somebody and then you're going to\nyou know like some black mirror episode\njust die from having you know the phone\nup to your ear that's not going to\nhappen what's going to happen is you're\ngoing to get fear because you're afraid\nof being rejected you're afraid of\nsomeone saying no to you\nand what that is to go and step into\nthat it's not potential death it is\npotential\ngrowth but your brain doesn't know the\ndifference between good fears and bad\nfears that's the thing you have to rush\na good fear is one that gets you out of\nyour comfort zone which is the majority\nof things you're going to deal with in\nyour life so what your brain does\nbecause it doesn't know the difference\nbetween good fears and bad fears this is\nwhat you have to learn to start\ncategorizing but because your brain\ndoesn't know the difference between good\nfears and bad fears you think that you\njust need to avoid them at all costs you\nknow you need to avoid all of the things\nthat cause you discomfort and could\npossibly push you out of your comfort\nzone the beautiful thing about this is\nwhen you really understand this you\nreally start to realize how the feeling\nof fear\ncan be amazing to push you out of your\ncomfort zone and to push you to grow\nwhen you feel fear you have two\ndifferent choices number one is you can\ngive in you can just give up and say i\ndon't want to do this anymore you know\nif you're thinking about making the cold\ncollege like i don't want to do this\nanymore or instead of giving in you can\nlean in you can be conscious and say\nwhat am i feeling i'm feeling a little\nbit of fear\nokay is there any death that's attached\nsome something that could possibly kill\nme on the other side of this fear that\ni'm feeling right now no i'm sitting at\nmy desk i'm about to make some cold\ncalls okay so instead of giving in what\nshould i do i should lean in knowing\nthat my growth is on the other side of\nthat a real great quote that has to do\nwith this is will smith says fear is not\nreal the only place where fear can exist\nis our thoughts of the future it's a\nproduct of our imagination causing us to\nfear things that are not present and may\nnot ever exist that is near insanity\ndon't underestimate me danger is very\nreal but fear is a choice\nso this is what we're talking about\ndanger is very real which is like yeah\nthat's some that's a fear to be afraid\nof but fear of the feeling of what we\nhave throughout the day is a choice now\nwe can't go in and just you know pop out\nyour amygdala and you just never have\nfear again and this is why i love\nteaching about the brain is because you\ncan understand the mechanisms that are\ninside of your brain and you can\nunderstand how they work you can be very\nself-aware in the moment and say okay\ni'm feeling fear i am safe there's no\npotential death attached on the other\nside of this the only thing that could\nhappen is potential growth and so\ninstead of giving up i'm going to lean\nin to what i feel is my fear you know\nyou have to you have to start to break\ndown your fears this is what's important\nand i think that it's important when you\nfeel these things to take a pen and\npaper and to literally start to write\nthem down because when something is\ninside of your brain your brain is very\nabstract and you know there's times\nwhere if you're like what are you\nfearing and you're like i don't know i\ndon't know i don't know but if you get\ndown with a pen and paper\nyou start writing down what am i fearing\nand that's the first question you want\nto write down whenever you feel fear\nwhat am i fearing let's say that you\nhave a fear of making phone calls you\nknow if you feel like we've been talking\nabout this right you have a fear of\nmaking those cold calls what am i\nfearing right now i feel a lot of fear i\nfeel a lot of anxiety to go and make\nthese phone calls okay question write it\ndown what am i fearing\ni'm afraid to make these phone calls why\nam i afraid to make these phone calls\ni'm afraid that somebody on the other\nline might say no to me okay if somebody\nsays no to me am i going to die\nno what's the worst that could happen um\nmaybe they could yell at me and then\nhang up\nokay\nand what's the best that could happen\nwell maybe this person could buy from me\nand then i could get commissioned to be\nable to you know if i stack up enough\ncommissions put down payment on a house\ni've been looking for okay the worst\nthat could happen and you can now look\nat your piece of paper the worst thing\ncould happen is that you could get\nyelled at and someone's going to hang up\nthat is very very rare in the world of\ncold calls on the other side the best\ncould happen is if i get enough\ncommissions i could buy a new house for\nmy family well sh looking at these two\nthings i think that leaning into the\nfear seems like a better idea and you\nstart to realize that sitting there and\nfearing making phone calls and talking\nto another human on the other line\nis absolutely ridiculous but you didn't\nthink it was ridiculous when it was\ninside of your head when you started\nwriting it down you start to realize\nthat you're just creating all of these\nfears in your own mind and we scare\nourselves by thinking that the negative\noutcomes that might happen the negative\noutcomes that might happen if we go and\nwe we go towards our fears and we go\ntowards our dreams but luckily the thing\nabout it is beautiful is that we're the\nones that scare ourselves we're the ones\nthat make up these fears but we can also\nstop ourselves from thinking that way\nwhen we become self-aware the feeling of\nfear\nis a very good thing because it's\nshowing you that you're getting past\nyou're pushing past the point of your\ncomfort because your comfort zone you've\nheard me long enough is where your\ndreams go to die so if you're sitting\nthere and you're feeling the feelings of\nfear it is a good thing because you're\nnow pushing past your comfort zone well\nhow do we start to work with your fear\nall right so i'm gonna give you my three\ntips to do so number one\nis to change your mindset it's never\nabout the actual fear itself and so let\nme give an example the phone example if\nyou think you\num\nyou think that somebody is gonna hang up\non you i'm feeling these feelings what\nam i afraid of say it out loud i'm\nafraid of somebody hanging up on me and\nyou're like\nthat's kind of dumb isn't it i'm afraid\nof someone hanging up with me like am i\na child is that really big of a deal say\nit out loud what are you afraid of and\nyou write this down and so you ask\nyourself what you're afraid of you know\nand you you write down this afraid of\nsomebody hanging up on me okay next\nquestion you want to ask yourself what\ngood can come from this so instead of\nbecause we we have we have two choices\nat every point in time we can either\nthink about the bad in every situation\nor we can think about the good in every\nsituation so if i'm feeling my fear and\ni want to change my mindset i'm going to\nsee what i'm concentrating on and i'm\ngoing to ask myself hey what good can\ncome from this\ni want to start writing down all of the\nthings that are good that could possibly\ncome from it okay next question i'm\ngoing to ask myself why should i not be\nafraid of this\nwhy should i not be afraid of making\ncold calls okay write down all of the\nreasons why you should not be afraid\nnext question\nwhat action do i need to take now\nwhat's the best action for me to take in\nthis moment\nwrite down the action you're supposed to\ntake and then you're going to ask\nyourself why do i need to take this\naction and so this is a formula for you\nto be able to go through and actually\nprocess your fears take them out of your\nbrain put them onto a piece of paper and\nrealize that what you're worried about\nis not really a big deal\nand the best things in life are on the\nother side of taking action so that's\nthe first thing is to change your\nmindset around that\nthe second thing is to make your goals\nbite size here's a big thing is a lot of\ntimes our goals are so big that they\ntend to paralyze us so if you're you\nknow a\nmusician for instance you're like you\nknow what i wanna i wanna sell a million\ncopies of a record\nokay well that's great that's a big goal\nbut why don't we make it a little bit\nmore bite-sized you look at your your\nyour band and you're like you know what\nwe've actually never played live\ntogether okay so my first goal\nis to make sure that we get a live show\nin the next month and then you can start\nto process and work through it make your\ngoals bite size so instead of a million\nrecords hey let's get our first\nin the next month let's get our first\nlive show and then let's get our first\nyou know in the next month let's get our\nfirst song written to get our first two\nsongs written because if you don't have\nan entire album how the hell you know if\nyou don't have one song how are you\ngonna get an entire album with a million\ncopies sold so you take your goals that\nseem really big and make them easier to\ndigest so instead of looking at your\n10-year goals\nfigure out what your goals are just for\nthis year and then take your goals from\nthis year and make them even more\nbite-sized so what is your goal for this\nquarter the first three months of the\nyear what is your goal okay the next\nthree months of the year what is your\ngoal\nalright the next one after that and so\ninstead of thinking about these\nlong-term goals that can seem really big\nand can actually paralyze us how can we\ntake those\nand chop them down to make them bite\nsize so if you want to sit there and\nmake you know 80 phone calls in a day\ndon't think about all 80 that you have\nto make just think about that you need\nto take you need to make 10 phone calls\nthis hour that's it i just got to get 10\nphone calls done this hour that's six\nevery one every six minutes that's it i\ncan get that done\nseems a lot easier to think about all of\nthe calls that you need to make if you\nwant to run one mile don't think about\nthe entire mile just think about the\nnext tree that's in front of you and\nthen when you get to that one think\nabout the next tree in front of you\nthink about the next tree in front of\nyou and just continue to put one foot in\nfront of the other and eventually you\nwill have run that so what i'm saying is\ndon't shrink your goals just make them\nmore bite-sized more easy to digest and\nthe last one the last tip to working\nwith your fear is to dance with your\nfear realize your fears are never going\nto go away you're not going to wake up\none day and just be like oh my god i'm\ncompletely fearless that's ridiculous\nlearn to dance with your first learn\nlearn to play with them differently\nlearn that these are not things that\nshould be holding us back these are\nthings we should become very aware of\nbecause when we're aware of them we can\nstart to work through them and realize\nfeeling of fear is a really good thing\nbecause this thing is showing me that i\nam on the edge of my comfort zone and if\ni'm on the edge of my comfort zone and i\nkeep pushing through that means that i'm\ngoing to be getting potential growth\nwith every single step that i take\noutside of my comfort zone you know it\nreminds me\ni was listening to um\na guy that i know that has a uh neuro\nhe's a neurologist and he's got a whole\nvr area virtual reality set area set up\ninside of his uh his lab david goggins\ncame into it and david goggins hates\nsharks like just hate sharks and when he\nfound out that the virtual reality to\nfeel fear like they actually will go\nthrough and try to say like hey are you\nafraid of heights you're afraid of\nsharks they try to make you feel fear\nand they measure all of these different\nwavelengths in your body and your brain\nand everything and david goggins is like\nwait you have shark virtual reality and\nhe's like yeah and he's like that and he\ngoes i have to do it. what happened was\ndavid goggins could feel that he he felt\nfear but he knows that his potential\ngrowth is on the other side of that fear\nso he's like you know what i'm terrified\nof sharks i have to get myself into the\nshark vr and so how can you start\nthinking of your life that way you know\nwrite down the questions the question i\nsaid before what am i afraid of\nsay it out loud what are you afraid of\nwhat good can come from this\nwhy should i not be afraid of this\nwhat action do i need to take\nand why do i need to take this action\nbecause if you can consciously remind\nyourself at all points in time that fear\nis a good thing it is natural it will\nnever go away all you've got to do is\nlearn to work with it then you're going\nto be constantly pushing the edge of\nyour boundaries in your comfort zone and\nthe more that you push your comfort zone\nthe more that you will start to grow\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if
