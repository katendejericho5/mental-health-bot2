    "transcript": "if you're somebody who's just sitting\nthere and you're spending your time on\nnetflix and you're spending your time on\ninstagram if you fast forward 10 years\nthe world's gonna be real real different\nthe people who are the most\nknowledgeable who can solve the most\nproblems where the most intelligent are\nalways going to win\ntoday i'm gonna be giving you three tips\nto read and learn anything faster and\ni'm gonna teach you my strategies for\nthe way that i've learned to read faster\nand also be able to retain much more\ninformation by doing it this way um i'll\ntell you this and i'll be honest with\nyou you know most people who are in the\npersonal development space wouldn't be\nhonest and tell you this i'm not a fan\nof reading i'm just not really a fan i'd\nrather go onto youtube and have somebody\ntell me about a book than actually sit\ndown and read a book and so what i've\nlearned though if i want to actually\nread books and get a lot of information\nhow can i actually speed that time up\nget it done way quicker but make my\nretention of that information even\nbetter and so today i'm going to give\nyou a secret that few people know about\ni don't know why a few people know about\nit\nbut it'll really help you out in\nlearning and retaining your information\nmuch much faster so the first tip that\ni'm going to give you is to start using\nkindle\nnow i know i get it guys i'm one of the\npeople who loves holding onto a physical\nbook as well i do and this is what\neverybody tells me when i tell them i\nneed to get a kindle what i do though is\ni use my iphone and i also use my ipad\nand i use kindle on it why because i do\na lot of traveling i'd rather not have\nto travel with a bunch of different\nbooks i'd rather just have my books on\nmy kindle but there's a secret that\nkindle has and audible has as well when\nyou go and you buy a kindle book and you\njust have the kindle app it's free on\nyour iphone or your ipad when you buy\nthem i would say it's probably 90 of\nbooks on kindle\nand you're about to buy the cool thing\nis you can click a little button and it\nsays add audible narration for it's\nusually like\n7.49 it's cheaper to buy the actual than\nphys buying the physical book itself\nit's cheaper to buy a kindle and get the\naudible narration with it as well and\nwhat's cool about it is it's also\ncheaper even though you get the audible\nuh even though you get the the audiobook\nit's cheaper than getting the audiobook\nby itself so you get the physical book\nyou know on your kindle and you get the\naudio book as well here's the reason why\nthis is so great because you can use\nthis thing called whispersync and\nwhispersync will actually as it's\nreading\nthe actual book to you it will highlight\nthe words that it's saying to you at\nthat point in time and so it can double\nif not triple your reading speed because\nyou're actually reading and hearing it\nat the same time now this is what's\nbeautiful about it when you're just\nreading a book\nyou're just reading a book but when\nyou're reading and listening to a book\nit's using instead of one sense which is\njust your site it's using your site and\nit's also using your hearing it's using\nboth of those at the same time which\nmeans you're more likely to retain that\ninformation because of the fact that you\ncan actually use multiple sentences at\none time and here's the interesting\nthing about it too\nhumans can hear\nfour times faster than they can read and\nso if you really want to speed up the\nprocess of getting books\nread i've taken books that have taken me\nliterally\ni don't bet you guys but it'll take me a\nmonth to read a book sometimes by using\nthis exact strategy it'll turn into like\nfour to five days and i can get through\nan entire book\nmuch quicker much less effort and much\nbetter retention than if i were to just\nread a physical book by itself and the\nbeautiful thing about it is this is when\nyou use kindle i'm not sponsored by\nkindle they should sponsor me for how\nmany freaking people i tell this to i\nshould be able to make some commission\noff of this but i'm not uh the beautiful\nthing about it as well is that i like to\ngo back and read books so when i go back\nand read a book everything that i\nhighlight because i'm a big highlighter\nand notetaker you can highlight and take\nnotes inside of kindle as well but\nwhat's cool is if i want to go back and\nread\nyou know the power of now by eckhart\ntolle i can go back and just read the\nparts that i've highlighted so you can\nliterally hit the highlight section and\ngo back and read all of the parts that\nyou've highlighted and all of the notes\nthat you've taken as well and so\nother than holding a physical book in my\nopinion there is no other benefit to\nbuying a physical copy of a book even\nthough you like the smell of it you like\nthe feeling of it all that stuff\nwhat i'm really worried about is how can\ni\nretain this information as much as\npossible and get it done as quick as\npossible because i like efficiency and\nlike i said the beautiful thing is that\nyou can highlight it you can highlight\ndifferent colors and so whenever i have\nsomething that i'm reading and i'm just\ndoing a normal highlight it's just\nyellow if i'm highlighting something and\ni'm looking at turning this into a\npotential episode i'll highlight it in\nred so that i can go back and look at\nall of my notes and then turn those\nnotes into a podcast episode it's\nfreaking amazing and i can put my notes\nin i can easily type my notes in on each\none of different ideas for episodes all\nof that stuff so i recommend\ntry it out if you have an iphone\ndownload it it's just kindle and then go\nand download a kindle book and\nadd audible narration next time that you\ndo it so that is tip number one use\nkindle to read faster and use audible\nnarration to help you with that as well\ntip number two\nyou've heard me say this so many damn\ntimes it's crazy use the pomodoro\ntechnique the pomodoro technique i\nliterally use it every single day\nalmost all day long it is you work for\n25 minutes and you take five minutes off\nyou work for 25 minutes you take five\nminutes off for 25 minutes the only\nthing that you do is one task if\nplanning a podcast episode is my task i\nwill take my phone i will put my phone\nin the other room i will put my\nheadphones on and i will put on\nyou know my i'll have a cup of coffee or\na cup of tea and i will literally just\nsit there and i will only do one thing\ncreate an episode for 25 minutes the\naverage person usually has one spike of\nreally high productivity in that time\nand then it continues to drop for the\nrest of the time that you're doing it so\nif you sit there and you're like i'm\ngoing to play in in work for the next\nhour and a half\ninstead of working for an hour and a\nhalf straight it is scientifically\nproven through brain activity that you\nwill get more done if instead of doing\nan hour and a half you do three 25\nminute on five minute off 25 minute five\nminutes off 25 minutes on five minutes\noff you will get way more productivity\ndone in that exact same amount of time\nso i recommend if you're reading a book\nand you're trying to retain the\ninformation if you're trying to read\nfaster and you're trying to retain the\ninformation much much better the best\nthings you can do is use the pomodoro\ntechnique okay i want to i want to read\nfor the next hour well then what i'm\ngoing to do is i'm going to take 25\nminutes and i'm going to read and i'm\ngoing to get myself as focused as i\npossibly can i'm going to take my phone\ni'm going to put in the other room the\nonly thing that i have in front of me is\nmy book or my kindle and for the next 25\nminutes this is the only thing i'm going\nto focus on\nafter 25 minutes my alarm on my ipad\ngoes off says hey you've got five\nminutes for five minutes i go and i walk\noutside i get some sun on my skin\nplay with my dogs\nand then after those five minutes i go\nback into learning and reading knowing\nthe way that my brain works that i will\nactually retain more information and\nwork better if i use the pomodoro\ntechnique so if you want to learn\nmuch better and read faster these two\ntips together will help you immensely so\nthat is number two and then the third\nthing which might be the most important\nof all of this\nis to teach somebody\nteach anybody teach your dog teacher cat\nteach somebody the best way to learn\nsomething is to teach it as soon as you\nget done learning it because when you\nteach something right after you learn it\nyour brain is making new neurosynaptic\nconnections and once your brain makes a\nnew connection that connection will\nnever go away and so if you've ever\nthought to yourself you know for\ninstance if you're in college right now\nand you go to a lecture and you go to\nthe lecture and the teacher's speaking\nfor an hour an hour and a half whatever\nit is you're taking a whole bunch of\nnotes and stuff\nand then later on that evening someone's\nlike hey what did you learn in class\ntoday you're like\ni don't i don't even remember\neven though i was fully there even\nthough i was listening even though i was\ntaking notes i don't really remember\nwhat was being taught in that class why\ndon't you remember it well usually\nbecause you're learning passively\npassively means you're just listening\nyou want to learn actively if you learn\nactively you are 10 times more likely to\nremember whatever it is that you just\nlearned so how do you take passive\nlearning sitting there and listening to\nsomebody\non you know\naudible narration or reading it or\nlistening to someone speaking on stage\nhow do you take it and make it from\npassive learning into active learning is\nto actively go and teach it that will\nmake new neurosynaptic connections in\nyour brain which means that you are 10\ntimes more likely to be able to recall\nthat information the best way to do it\nis to if you are in a relationship\nafter you get done with your hour of\nlearning or you get done with your hour\nof reading or whatever it is\ngo and tell your boyfriend or girlfriend\nor spouse what it is that you just\nlearned if you live by yourself and\nyou're completely completely single take\nout a pen and paper it's better if you\ncan use a pen and paper as well take out\na pen and paper and speak out loud as if\nthere was somebody next to you that\nwanted you to teach them what you just\nlearned because if you write it down\nand you teach it you're literally\nrequiring your brain to actually start\nmaking those new connections and\nactually hardwire that information that\nyou just learned into your brain if you\nreally want to learn faster this is the\nabsolute best way to do it whether it's\na youtube video you're watching whether\nit's my podcast that you're listening to\nand you're taking notes on or a lecture\nthat you're in at school when you get\nback to your house when you get back to\nyour dorm when you get back around other\npeople or even if you do it by yourself\ntake out a pen and paper and write down\neverything that you just learned so that\ntherefore you can make it hardwired into\nyour brain this is something that i do\nall of the time anytime i learn\nsomething new\nand i'll watch somebody who's i watch\nsome some pretty complex sometimes\nneurologists and biologists and early\nchildhood psychologists talking about\nthings that are really freaking deep and\nsometimes makes my head want to explode\ni'll take notes on my ipad of all the\nstuff that they're saying and then what\ni'll do is i'll go back and i will\nreteach that\nto usually my fiance or if she's not\naround i will re-teach it to myself and\ni will hear myself say it because then\ni'm writing it down i'm saying it and\ni'm hearing myself say it all at the\nsame time the beautiful thing about it\nis you can do all of these things\nand it doesn't cost you a whole lot of\nmoney there is no excuse at this point\nin time\nto not be extremely knowledgeable in\nanything that you want to be\nknowledgeable in you know and let's say\nthat you know because some people like\nwell you know that sounds nice to have a\nkindle it sounds nice to be able to go\nand buy books it sounds nice to people\ndo that\nbut i'm broke as hell right now okay\ncool let's say that you're really poor\nokay you're really poor and you can't\nafford books right now there's apps that\nare on your phone that you can download\nlike overdrive and there's a few other\nones as well where literally if you walk\ninto your local library and you have a\nlibrary card you can go into overdrive\nand overdrive will allow you to hook up\nyour library card to your phone and you\ncan start listening to audio audio books\nabsolutely free cost you nothing so you\ncan listen to the audiobook you can go\ninto the library and get a physical copy\nyou can go on to youtube youtube has so\nmany lessons that you could watch and\nlearn from certain people you can be\nwatching this on youtube right now if\nyou're listening to your phone on your\nphone go on youtube and type in rob dial\nyou'll see hundreds of videos that i've\nput up there as well absolutely free if\nyou know you go onto youtube and you're\nlike hey there's a book i really want to\nget the audiobook for but i can't find\nit on my local library and i don't have\nany money to go and buy the actual\naudiobook or kindle version\ncool go ahead and type in the power of\nnow audiobook or you know think and grow\nrich audiobook type in all of those\nbooks\n99 of the time those books are already\non youtube so you literally have no\nexcuse to not be reading and not\nconsuming content as much as possible\nanything that you want to learn in this\nworld is absolutely at your fingertips\nthere's no reason why you can't be\nlearning you know it's like the the\nquote says the man who does not read has\nno advantage over the man that cannot\nread and so if you're out there and\nyou're not reading and you're not\nlearning and you're not trying to\nconstantly get better you're going to be\nleft in the dust i'm telling you that\nit's it's very easy to see that this\nworld and technology and everything is\nmoving extremely fast if you're somebody\nwho's just sitting there and you're\nspending your time on netflix and you're\nspending your time on instagram and\nyou're not actively putting time into\nyour schedule to learn to read to get\nbetter\nif you fast forward 10 years the world\nis going to be real real different i\ndon't know what's going to be happening\nin the real world in 10 years but i do\nknow this the people who are the most\nknowledgeable who can solve the most\nproblems who are the most intelligent\nare always going to win and so

catch three minutes of somebody\ntalking i'm constantly trying to learn\ni'm constantly trying to grow whenever i\nget into my car sure i play music a lot\nof times as well but probably about
