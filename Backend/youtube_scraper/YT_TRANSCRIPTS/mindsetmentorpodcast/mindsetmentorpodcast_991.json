    "transcript": "either you do it or you don't there is\nno other options you get the life that\nyou want to or you don't get the life\nthat you want to you don't do anything\nand you're too lazy your life is not\ngoing to be what you want you are\ntricking yourself into thinking that\nyou're stuck in a rut\nchoice number one you create the life\nthat you want to the success that you\nwant the money that you want the\nhappiness that you want the love that\nyou want the joy that you want the peace\nthat you want\nthat's\none way that you could go or the other\nway is you don't get it\nso you either are a success in life or\nyou're a failure in life there is no\nother option between the two now when i\nsay success i don't just mean financial\nsuccess what i mean is you have this\nopportunity this life that you're\ncurrently in\nto create the life that you want to\nyou either do it or you don't that's it\nand if you do\nthat is a success if you don't that is a\nfailure so we're looking at it in the\nsimplest form that we possibly can\nthere's two choices you either get the\nlife that you want to or you don't get\nthe life that you want to those are the\nonly two ways that you could go there's\nno in between there's no like trial time\nthere's no second at bat that you get\npeople tend to act as if there is like\nit's either black or white in life\npeople act like there's a gray area like\nwell maybe maybe if i wait about 15\nyears then maybe somehow i will just get\neverything that i want by not changing\nmy circumstances and i'll get everything\nthat i want i'll get the money i want\nthe happiness that i want even though\nall i do is just sit on instagram all\nday when i'm not at work or i'm on\nnetflix maybe my perfect partner will\njust come knocking at my door while i'm\nsitting there on netflix or maybe my\nperfect body will come in if i just keep\neating the same food either you do it or\nyou don't there is no other options you\nget the life that you want to or you\ndon't get the life that you want to\nultimately it comes down to\nare you going to make excuses\nor are you going to get results\nthat's it you can make excuses if you\nwant to or you can get results which one\nare you going to do which one have you\nbeen doing if you look around you and\nyou don't have the life that you want at\nthis point have you been getting the\nresults that you want to because results\ncome from action\nor have you been making excuses as to\nwhy you have not gotten the results that\nyou want\nright it's like growing up you just\nthe my dog ate my homework turns into\njust another excuse or blame for\nsomething else and people are just my\ndog ate my homework and everything in\ntheir life oh i don't have the money\nthat i want because my dog ate my\nhomework whatever that excuse means for\nthem i don't have the relationship i\nwant because my dog at my homework i\ndon't have the happiness that i want\nbecause my dog ate my homework no you\neither get what you want or you don't\nyou either make excuses\nor you get results\nthat's it there's no other option and if\nyou've been listening to me long enough\nyou know that i like to say excuses are\nlike buttholes everybody's got one and\nthey all stink so do you want to make\nexcuses or do you want to get results\nbecause there's always\nno matter what no matter what you have\nin life no matter how your life was no\nmatter how your parents were no matter\nwhat your current life circumstances are\nthere is always an excuse that you could\nfind as to why you don't have\nwhatever it is that you want oh i don't\nhave enough time how many people out\nthere have said i don't have enough time\nas if the people who do have the lives\nthat they want magically get more than\n24 hours in the day oh i don't have\nenough time\nchange i don't have enough time to i\ndon't give a damn\nand see if that starts to change the way\nthat you perceive it i don't have enough\ntime or i don't give a damn i don't have\nenough time to create the life that i\nwant i don't give a damn enough to give\nto create the life that i want see if\nyour perception starts to change don't\nuse time as an excuse because everyone's\ngot the exact same amount of time oh\nit's not the right time though\nhear that one all the time it's not the\nright time maybe in like you know maybe\nin three months it will be the right\ntime for me to create the business that\ni've always wanted maybe in three months\nit will be the right time for me to\ncreate the body that i want maybe in\nthree months it'll be the right time for\nme to go out and find that perfect\nrelationship because three months from\nnow looks a lot less busy than right now\ndo you know why three months from now\nlooks less busy because it's three\nmonths from now very rarely do we plan\nthree months out and so it's always\ngoing to look less busy than it does\nright now because i guess guess what in\nthree months it's gonna look pretty damn\nbusy you won't have enough time again in\nthree months\nyou know what i have kids that's my\nexcuse are you telling me that every\nperson that's created the life that i\nwant don't have kids and you're just\ndifferent oh you just have kids i always\nask people you know when people blame\ntheir kids which i think is the biggest\ncop-out is blaming their kids your kids\nshould never be your excuse as to why\nyou don't have the life that you want\nyour kids should always be the reason\nwhy you create the life that you want\nfor them you can use them as an excuse\nor you can use a measure why which one\ndo you want because ultimately that's\nwhat's going to change your life i\nalways say to people when they use their\nchildren as an excuse oh\nso you're telling me before you had your\nchildren you were super successful and\nyou had the life that you wanted and you\nhad all the joy and the money and the\npeace and the happiness and the cars and\nclothes whatever it is that you wanted\noh you didn't so what you're doing is\nyou're just actually using your children\nas your scapegoat instead of actually\nlooking internally and blaming yourself\nfor your circumstances and knowing that\nyou can change it right don't use your\nchildren as an excuse it's not their\nfault that they were born into this\nworld so you can't use them as an excuse\nyou have to use them as the reason why\nyou will succeed i coach business owners\ni've consulted business owners for over\na decade now some business owners come\nin and say well yeah no my business\nisn't succeeding because i've got\nchildren i'm like okay cool and then\nsome people come in and they go listen\ni'm a single mother i've got to make\nthis work and they work their ass off\nthey've got two three or four kids and\nno one else supporting them and they're\nmore they become more successful than\nthe people who have everything that they\nneed but happen to have kids why the\nperson who the single mom decided not to\nmake them an excuse they she decided to\nmake them a reason why her back was\nagainst the wall and she's gonna do it\nno matter what\nthat's the difference don't use your\nchildren as an excuse everybody loves to\nuse their children's issues please don't\ndo that oh yeah i don't have enough\nknowledge to be able to do it or i don't\nhave the right skill set to be able to\ndo it we live in the age where every\npiece of knowledge you could ever want\nacross anything that's ever happened in\nthe world is basically close to free if\nyou want to go start a business if you\nwant to go start an e-commerce business\nand start selling something on etsy or\nselling something on shopify or selling\nsomething on amazon\nyou can get a lot of free knowledge on\nyoutube if you want to now will you\nmaybe have to buy a course to get really\nin-depth step by step by step knowledge\nsure\nyou might have to get you know let go of\nsome of your money in order to get the\nknowledge that you need but it will\nprobably be a great investment as long\nas you take action because too many\npeople buy a course and then they make\nexcuses as to why the course didn't work\nwhen in reality it wasn't the course\nthat didn't work it was them that didn't\nwork\nyou can either have excuse or you can\nhave results which one is the which one\nis it that you want oh yeah no\ni don't know there's just so much going\non in the world right now maybe i'll\nwait till things change and things die\ndown i don't know about you but don't\nlook like things are changing too much\nit doesn't\nthe past few years it just seems like\nthings keep getting crazier so if we're\njust looking at this as a as a\nyou know a graph it doesn't look like\nthings are slowing down any sort of way\nso maybe i look at instead of saying\nokay with all of the stuff that's\nhappening in the world right now instead\nof me saying right now isn't the right\ntime or maybe there's too much going on\nin the world right now maybe i look at\nit and say hey if i go back and i look\nwhat warren buffett's one of his most\nfamous quotes warren buffett billionaire\ninvestor says when everyone is greedy be\nfearful when everyone is fearful be\ngreedy and i remember last year thinking\nof that quote when covid hit really hard\nin lockdown and i thought so i started\nseeing people losing their jobs i\nstarted companies firing people and i\nthought to myself\nthis is not the time to pull back\nbecause everyone's being fearful right\nnow this is a time to go double down on\neverything that i'm doing to to hire the\nright people to put the right things in\nplace because i'm going to do the exact\nopposite of everybody else in the world\nbecause if people are going left i'm\ngoing to go right if people are going\nright i'm going to go left so maybe you\nshould look in and say well instead of\nme\nlooking at what's going on in the world\nright now and being fearful maybe i\nshould look at it and say you know what\nmaybe with all of this pullback that\npeople are doing it leaves me so much\nmore opportunity\nif you look at how many businesses that\nare massive businesses like i'm talking\nlike marquee businesses have been around\nfor 50 to 100 years how many of them\nwere started in a great like a massive\nrecession\nit's like more than 50 of them so when\nthings are changing and things are\nshifting it's not a time to be afraid\nit's a time to double down and to go for\nit so\nmaybe you should use that as your reason\nwhy you're doubling down and taking\naction versus not going oh yeah this\nisn't this isn't the right time maybe i\nshould wait and see if things pan out\npositively there is never going to be a\nperfect moment to do whatever it is that\nyou want the perfect moment is always\nthe moment that you are in that's it\nthere will never be a moment in your\nentire life\nwhere you will not be here and it will\nnot be now right so if i if i ask you\nwhere are you right now\nyou would say i'm here\nwhat time is it it's now if i'm thinking\nabout the future\nit seems like it's a different moment\nbut when i get to that future\ni will be here in this moment\nand the time will be now it is here and\nnow always your life is always a here\nand now moment so if you think that the\nfuture is going to be different\nthen right now and then is going to be a\nbetter time for you to create the life\nthat you want it won't now is the time\nyou can find all of the excuses as to\nwhy you're not creating the life that\nyou want\nbut ultimately\nthat's a trick that your brain is\nplaying on you so let me explain to you\nhow your brain is actually screwing you\nover our brain is designed to do one\nthing and one thing only it's to keep us\nsafe to keep us alive and your brain\nknows that in this current moment with\neverything that you've done you are not\ndead which means that everything that\nyou've done to get you here is safe\nenough because it didn't kill you it\ndoesn't know that if you don't you know\nif you go out and want to create a\nmillion dollar business\nthe amygdala the oldest part of your\nbrain the fear mechanism inside of your\nbrain is going to go we've never created\na million dollar business before\nwe should be afraid of that because\nanything that is something that we've\nnever done or\nactually had happened before we should\nbe afraid of because it's potential\ndeath that's there you know that if you\nbuild a million-dollar business you're\nnot going to die but your amygdala\ndoesn't know that so what your amygdala\ndoes is it creates fears and excuses and\nself-sabotaging mechanisms to keep you\nin your comfort zone like for instance\nhere's an example i want to build a\nmillion dollar business and i've got a\ncouple kids and i'm sitting there and\ni'm going i've got the plan i've got\neverything that i need because\nultimately we all know\nhere's the secret to life you know what\nyou need to do to be successful whatever\nsuccess means to you you know what you\nneed to do\nyou're just not doing it\nit's that simple you just got to take\naction so\nthe plan to get there is not the most\nimportant part the action taking is the\nmost important part so people come up\nwith this plan to create this business\nand their market strategy and their\nniche and their perfect clients but then\nthey won't take any action simply\nbecause they're afraid to take action\nbecause their brain has designed itself\nto do that to keep you in your comfort\nzone so then you've got to go okay so\ni've developed this perfect perfect\naction plan and everything that i need\nto do to create this life and you sit\nthere and you go oh yeah but what if oh\nyeah but what if this happens what if\nyou know i want to create this but what\nif what if my mom says something about\nthis what if you know there's a\ncatastrophe what if i stop i can't pay\nthe bills and i have children i've got\nto feed what if something happens with\none of the kids and i don't have\ninsurance whatever it is your brain will\nstart creating all of these fear-based\nbeliefs and thoughts to keep you in your\ncomfort zone you've got to become aware\nthat your brain is designed to\nself-sabotage you\nbecause of that i'm going to tell you\nsomething that's a beautiful thing you\ndon't have to believe in yourself to\ntake action and you don't have to wait\nuntil fear is gone in order to take\naction in fact you're probably not going\nto fully believe in yourself majority of\nthe time and you're not going to get rid\nof all of your fears so knowing that\nyour fears are not going to go away\nand that you're also the same time going\nto find mechanisms of self-sabotage\nand you're going to be afraid you're not\ngoing to do it you're not going to\nbelieve in yourself you can feel all of\nthose feelings and take action anyway\nthat's the beautiful thing about it you\ndon't have to believe in yourself to\ntake action and you don't have to get\nrid of fear to take action your brain is\ndesigned to keep you inside of your\ncomfort zone that's what it is designed\nto do because in your comfort zone you\nstay alive so when you feel the feelings\nof fear when you feel the the\nself-sabotage coming up and the excuses\ncoming up that is actually\nwhat you should be paying attention to\ngoing ah\ni've met the edge of my comfort zone\nso anything\ninside of this if i take a step back is\ngoing to be in my comfort zone but if i\nlean into this it's going to be pushing\nme outside of my comfort zone just\nbecause i don't feel safe\ngoing and creating a million dollar\nbusiness or because i have excuses of\nhaving a family or because i have\nexcuses a student now is not right not\nthe right time doesn't mean that i don't\ntake action anyways your life is changed\nonly only only only when you take action\nif you're not taking action you're\nmaking excuses as to why you're not\ntaking action and you're believing those\nexcuses and all of those excuses\nthey're bs\nand they're holding you back from what\nyou want in life so you have to realize\neither you sit back and you continue to\nlisten to that little voice inside of\nyour head that's keeping you in your\ncomfort zone you continue to make\nexcuses and to self-sabotage and you'll\nwake up 10 years from today and be like\nwhy didn't i take the action when i\nshould have\nor\nyou feel the feelings you feel the lack\nof belief you feel the excuses and you\nsay i don't care i'm going to do it\nanyways don't care i don't care what my\nthoughts are i don't care what my\nfeelings are i don't care what my\nexcuses are i don't care what my beliefs\nare i'm going to do it anyway simply\nbecause i deserve this life i want to\ncreate this life and the people that i\nlove that are around me deserve this\nlife as well\nscrew my excuses you can either have\nexcuses or you can have results but you\ncan't have both\nwhich one are you going to choose you're\nsomeone that's out there and you tend to\nbe a little bit lazy if you're not\ngetting things done that you need to or\nif you tend to procrastinate too much\ni'm going to give you my strategies on\nhow to make sure that you stop being\nlazy so the first tip that i'm going to\ngive you before we dive into like the\nactual meat and potatoes of exactly how\nto do it is to stop lying to yourself\nyou need to first admit that you are a\nlazy person because all too often i see\npeople that are lazy they're not getting\nthe stuff done that they need to and\nthen ultimately what they do oh yeah\nwell you know i'm just i've got stuff\ngoing on and they make excuses for\neverything of so the reason why they're\nnot achieving the goals they want why\nthey don't have the life that they want\nwhen in reality the thing they need to\ndo is just admit\nthat what the real issue is is that\nthey're lazy and they're a\nprocrastinator and they don't have plans\nput in place so the first thing you need\nto do is to admit to yourself to fully\nbe transparent and say you know what i\ndo have a problem with laziness it's the\nsame way that if somebody is an\nalcoholic and they go through a 12-step\nprogram the very first thing to do is to\nadmit\nthat so that they can overcome it\nbecause once you admit it then you can\nstart to work through it and that's the\nimportant thing is to realize that that\nhumans are inherently lazy more than\nanything else if you were to just go\nback in\na hundred thousand years ago 200\nthousand years ago and see our ancestors\ni don't think that they were just\nworking all day long if i were to make a\nguess if they're in the middle of the\ndesert it's really hot outside it's 101\ndegrees they're probably under a tree in\nthe shade hanging out because they hunt\nin the morning and then they hunt in the\nevening and then during the day they're\njust sitting around and sitting in the\nshade most likely so i think being lazy\nis inherently inside of humans so for\nyou to not be lazy is kind of going\nagainst what you actually would be doing\nas a typical human if you weren't born\nin a western world like we are now with\nyou know instagram and facebook and all\nof these things so uh when you realize\nthat we are inherently lazy and you\nadmit okay i am a lazy person i have\nbeen lazy it is my fault it's no one\nelse's fault it's no one no one outside\nof these faults nothing externally it's\n100 me and you stop blaming anybody else\nor anything else and you take full 100\nresponsibility then you can start\nactually taking steps to overcome that\nlaziness that you have\nso that's the first tip make sure that\nyou admit it to yourself stop lying to\nyourself be 100 transparent the second\ntip that i'm going to give you is to\ntake your goals and make sure that all\nof your goals are bite-sized\nand i don't mean take your goals and\nmake them smaller what i mean is take\nyour goals and take the time frame so if\nyou have for instance let's say you want\nto make a hundred thousand dollars this\nyear and that's the goal for the year if\nyou look at that you've never made a\nhundred thousand dollars there's a part\nof you that that scares there's a part\nof you that that's outside of your\ncomfort zone and you're not really sure\nhow you feel about it like you want to\nmake the hundred thousand dollars but\nthere's a party that's kind of for being\nhonest you're kind of scared less of\nmaking a hundred thousand because what\ndo you have to do how hard do you have\nto work how much more time do you have\nto put into it so if you're looking at\nthe number and you're saying okay this\nis a long-term goal over the next year\nthat's 365 days right that's a decent\namount of time from right now so when\nyou look at it that way and you say okay\ni need to take these and make these more\nbite-sized what does that mean i need to\ntake that hundred thousand dollar goal\nand i need to figure out how to take\nthat hundred thousand dollar goal and\nmake it smaller make it so it's more\nbite-sized so let me give you an example\nlet's say that you're a sales rep and\nyour goals make a hundred thousand\ndollars this year okay\nwell now that we have the goal of a\nhundred thousand dollars we've got that\nfigured out if you break down your\nnumbers which every sales rep should\nknow their numbers how many you know\nsales they get depending on how many\nappointments that they have how many\nphone calls they need to make in order\nto get an amount of a certain amount of\nappointments and you look through and\nyou say okay if i'm looking at my\nlong-term goal of how much money i want\nto make this year a hundred thousand\ndollars and i say okay over the next\nyear that means weekly i need to make\nsure that i'm doing a hundred calls per\nweek if i just do\na hundred calls per week\nstatistically i should make a hundred\nthousand dollars this year\nautomatically doesn't that already feel\nbetter because i'm not focusing on the\nentire year\nall i'm doing is i'm focusing on this\nweek so i know what needs to be done\nokay let's take it another step further\nif i look at that and i say okay if i\nwork for five days and it's a hundred\ncalls a day a hundred calls a week\nthat's 20 calls a day i mean i can focus\non 100 100 100 calls a week 20 calls a\nday and if i just do my 20 calls a day\nand i only focus on just that one goal\nstatistically i'll make a hundred\nthousand dollars\nisn't that a lot easier because then\nyou're taking something that's really\nfar away and really big and making it\nreally close and really small 20 calls a\nday i can do that if i'm working for the\nnext eight hours what is that like two\nand a half calls an hour i can do two\nand a half calls in an hour that's super\neasy so take whatever goals that you're\ngoing for and make them more bite sized\nand the thing about it is because the\nfact they're bite sized you're more\nlikely to hit little tiny goals\nthroughout the day\nwhich motivates you to then work harder\nright so if you're lazy the reason why\nthis is important is because if i go oh\ni make a hundred thousand dollars this\nyear that's really far away but if i go\ni only need to make two and a half calls\nthis hour\nthen what happens i make two and a half\ncalls this hour you know three calls\nthis hour and i go holy crap i'm ahead\nand it actually makes me feel better\nbecause i have little teeny tiny\ncheckpoints that i'm hitting and each\ntime i hit a checkpoint what happens i\ngain confidence and when i gain\nconfidence and i feel like i'm moving\nand progressing towards the goal that i\nwant to go for in the life that i want\nto create it actually gives me more\ndrive and more motivation towards that\ngoal which is more\nmore than likely going to make me less\nlazy so take all of your goals all of\nyour big goals and just make them\nsmaller figure out a way to chunk them\ndown a little bit it's easiest way to do\nit if you sit down to eat a meal you\ndon't eat the entire meal you eat the\nmeal one bite at a time so stop worrying\nabout the entire meal and just worry\nabout each and every bite each and every\nday that you have\nso that's number two is to take your\ngoals and make them smaller because then\nyou're going to hit more checkpoints\nwhich is going to then make you excited\nto keep working harder towards your goal\nstep number three is to figure out what\nyour why is if you don't if you're if\nyou're too lazy the reason why is\nbecause you just really don't care\nenough about your goals but if you can\nfigure out exactly what you want and why\nyou want it it makes it much easier to\ngo for it so let me give you a very\ndrastic example but it's my favorite\nexample because it shows everybody they\ncan do whatever they want so one of my\nfavorite things to do when i'm giving a\nspeech and i start to talk about this is\ni'll go into a group of people and i say\nhey\neverybody here\nwhat is the actual percentage chance\nthat you're going to make a million\ndollars in the next 12 months legally\nwhat's the chance that you make a\nmillion dollars in the next 12 months\nlegally who's going to who has over a\nfive percent chance and i raise my hand\nand nobody ever raises their hand\nwho has a one percent chance\nof making a million dollars legally in\nthe next 12 months and like a couple\npeople raise their hand and then i say\nwho thinks that there's a zero percent\nchance of you making a million dollars\nover the next 12 months\nlegally\nand everybody raises their hand they\nthink there's a almost everybody thinks\nthere's a zero percent chance and i okay\ni'm going to take that exact same goal\nand i'm going to shift it around a\nlittle bit and see if we can shift the\nway that you believe in yourself\nokay so i'm gonna say what's the\npercentage chance of you making a\nmillion dollars this year\nlegally and if you don't\neverybody that you love is killed i\nraise my hand and say who's who think\nwhat's the percentage chance 100 100 100\na thousand percent 10 000\neverybody goes from zero\npercent chance\nto 100 chance\nnow why is that the goal didn't change\nthe time frame didn't change what\nchanged is they actually give a damn\nabout the goal that's what changed\nright there's a why behind the goal if\neverybody that you love gets killed\nthere's no such thing as laziness right\nyou'll wake up early you won't make\nexcuses you'll get everything that you\nneed to get done and you won't you\nprobably wouldn't even look at instagram\nor facebook throughout the entire year\nthere would be no way that you're lazy\nover the next year if everyone that you\nloves life depends on it for you to make\na million dollars legally you would\nfigure out a way\nso what does that show you\nyou're not just lazy you're lazy because\nyou don't love what you're doing you're\nlazy because you're not fully tied into\nexactly what it is that you're trying to\ncreate it's not that it's not possible\nit's 100 possible it's 100 impossible\nfor everybody listening to me right now\nsomehow to figure out a way to make a\nmillion dollars in the next year but the\nproblem is it's not that you don't have\nenough time it's that you just don't\ncare enough and that's the main issue\nso how do you make yourself care more\nyou've got to have a really really\nreally strong why so if you figure out\nwhat your goals are and you figure out\nwhat your why is\nlaziness doesn't exist anymore you'll\nget up in work when your why is strong\nenough to figure out why it is that\nyou're working towards what you're\nworking\nso that's the third thing is to find\nyour why behind all of your goals\nthat'll get you past your laziness\nnumber four is to remove the\ndistractions\nhere's the thing that i know when you're\nbeing lazy i guarantee you're not just\nsitting on your couch and just staring\nup at your ceiling the entire time\nright what are you doing you're keeping\nyourself busy in some sort of way\nif i were to guess 99 of people listen\nthis when you're being lazy you're\nprobably either watching something on tv\nor you're on your phone\ni don't think there's anything else that\npeople are really doing besides that\nyou're not just staring up at the clouds\nand watching the clouds pass by and\nthat's your quote-unquote laziness\nwhat's happening is you're figuring out\nanother way to distract yourself so that\nyou don't do the thing that actually\nneeds to be done so if you can remove\nthat distraction then you're more likely\nto just go ahead and go all right well\n[ __ ] i got nothing else to do i might as\nwell go ahead and do it so what's a big\nway to do this take your phone and put\nit in the other room\nif you got something important to do if\nyou have something that needs to get\ndone take your phone and put it in the\nother room\nturn off all of your notifications on\nyour phone\nfor some of you guys that scares you\nturn off all of your notifications take\nyour freaking apple watch off that's the\nbiggest i have an apple watch and the\nonly time i ever wore it as i work is\nwhen i work out because i just don't\neven want to have all of those\ndistractions so turn your apple watch\ndistractions off turn your phone\ndistractions off the only way like for\nme i'll be completely honest the only\nway that you can get a hold of me on my\nphone is if you call me if you send me a\ntext message my phone doesn't light up\nnothing lights up the only time it\nlights up is when i get a phone call not\nwhen i get an email now when i get a\nfacebook message not when i get an\ninstagram message not when i get\nsomebody that likes one of my photos\nnothing\nno way would i ever have notifications\nget in the way of what i'm truly trying\nto do so turn off all of your\nnotifications on your phone\nnext turn off all of your notifications\non your computer\nyour computer should have all of your\nnotifications off as well\ni don't want to know every time someone\nsends me an email i check my email once\nevery two to three days i don't want to\nknow there's no way because that's going\nto pull me from everything that i'm\ntrying to do you know what i mean so i\ndon't want to focus on that there's no\nway that i want to focus on those things\nso i'm going to remove as many\ndistractions as i possibly can how do i\nmove as many distractions i possibly can\nturn off my freaking notifications put\nmy phone in the other room let everyone\nknow that you're about to go do\nsomething so like for instance when i'm\nplanning my episodes i planned this\nepisode earlier today i tell my\ngirlfriend hey i'm gonna go plan some\nepisodes i plan three episodes in a row\nwhat do i do i take my phone i put in\nthe other room i get onto my computer\nthat has no distractions on it i put my\nheadphones in i tell my girlfriend hey\ni'm going to go and start uh start\nplanning some episodes she knows to\nleave me alone for the next two hours\nbecause that's what's going to get me\nfocused because if i break my focus it\nmakes it easier for me to go back to\ndoing nothing so i'm trying to get\nmyself into the zone\nso i can literally go okay i'm in the\nzone now i'm going to stop being lazy\nnow i'm going to do exactly what needs\nto be done\nso just stop freaking turn turn your\nnetflix off delete your netflix account\ndelete your facebook account delete your\ninstagram delete all of those things and\nsee if you're still lazy because you're\nnot gonna have [ __ ] to do it's the truth\nright like if you get rid of instagram\nfacebook whatever else there is twitter\nand you know snapchat some people i\nthink still use snapchat and you know\ntick tock and now there's this new thing\ncalled clubhouse you delete all of those\nand you delete your netflix and your\nhulu and all of those things\nif you're being lazy the only thing\nyou're doing is you're sitting outside\nwatching the grass grow so if you're\nbeing lazy you're probably distracting\nyourself in another way so what are\nthose distractions write them down with\na pen and paper and get rid of those\nfreaking distractions\nso that's number five or number four and\nthen number five\nthe last one is my favorite thing is\njust the pomodoro technique the pomodoro\ntechnique says i'm going to work for 25\nminutes and i'm going to take five\nminutes off you can do anything for 25\nminutes right anything you can figure\nout a way to just work for 25 minutes so\nyou say all right screw it i'm being\nlazy i can notice that i'm being lazy\ni'm admitting to myself that i'm being\nlazy i need to get this thing done all\nright so what am i going to do i'm going\nto get my computer and what am i going\nto do next to my computer i'm going to\nhave a pen and paper and i'm going to\nwrite down whatever it is that pops up\ninto my head because i've got one task\nonly one task that i can do for the next\n25 minutes i'm gonna put my headphones\nin i'm gonna listen to you know i always\nlisten to music on youtube i look up a\nfocused binary beat song it's like three\nhours long and i just put it on so\ntherefore there's no music there's music\nthere's no\nsounds that could come into my ears\nexcept for just this music i'm in\ncontrol of the sounds that are coming in\nand then there's no words inside of the\nsong as well if there's no words inside\nthe song there's nothing to distract me\nand i can start thinking about the\nlyrics like i do so i don't have that to\ndistract me and i go okay the only thing\nthat i can do for the next 25 minutes is\nthis one task\nand if you give your brain no other\noptions you'll realize that your brain\ncan get hyper focused\nand if you are sitting there and a great\nidea comes into your head instead of\ngoing and putting that somewhere all you\nhave to do is take your pen and paper\nand write that on the journal that's\nnext to you and you focus on just one\nthing for 25 minutes you'll be surprised\nhow much you can get done being hyper\nfocused with no distractions with no\nnotifications coming in with no external\nsounds how much you can get done in\nliterally just 25 minutes\nthat's kind of crazy you're way more\nefficient than you actually realize when\nthose 25 minutes is you're doing this 25\nminutes you take a five minute break\nthat's it super simple take a five\nminute break and you can go on instagram\nyou can go to the bathroom you can go\nstare at clouds passing in the sky do\nwhatever you want for those five minutes\nyou're completely done working for those\nfive minutes and then what do you do you\ngo back in and you do another 25 minutes\nand you only have one task to work for\nit's really not that hard being lazy is\na really easy thing to pull yourself out\nof you just have to be aware you have to\nadmit it and you have to make a plan and\nyou have to have a really strong why and\nif you do that it will pull you out of\nyour laziness so that you can start to\nget [ __ ] done because i'm telling you\nthis if you don't do anything and you're\ntoo lazy your life is not going to be\nwhat you want it to be so in order to\nbuild the life that you want follow\nthese steps pull your ass out of\nlaziness and get to work i'm going to\ngive you seven ways seven action steps\nthat you can use to get out of a rut and\nto start off today i want to give you a\nphrase that i say all the time to kind\nof help you understand what a rut is and\nhow to get out of it\nand that phrase is this\ninaction causes more inaction action\ncauses more action what do i mean by\nthat if you're in a rut you're never in\na rut when you're moving like if you\never feel like you're stuck in a rut\nit's never when you're moving it's\nalways when you're stagnant and i always\nuse the phrase stagnant on purpose\nbecause i think very visually when i\nthink the word stagnant i think of like\na pond that's been stagnant for a long\ntime it's got like a gross film over top\nof it there's flies and it's just\nbecoming disgusting because i never want\nto think of my life\nas stagnant as that pond is and i get it\nif i'm saying you have to take action in\norder to get out of a rut you're like\nwell what the hell like i i'm trying to\nlearn how to take action right that's\nthe the reason why i'm in the rut is\nbecause i can't force myself to take\naction\ni get it so i'm going to give you my\nseven tips to actually get out of a rut\nand\ni get it like\nyou take action all day long though so\nyou might be sitting there like yeah but\nrob like i i'm not i want to take action\nbut i'm not taking action that i want to\nright so i'm just i'm not taking action\nso how am i supposed to take action when\ni'm not taking action you have to rise\nyou're taking action all day long right\nif you're in a riot you're not just\nsitting on the couch and then peeing on\nyourself right getting up off of the\ncouch walking to the bathroom and peeing\nis action when you're hungry you get up\noff of the couch and you go and get some\nfood both of those things are taking\naction the only difference is it's not\nthe action that you want to take for the\nlife that you want right you don't need\nto be inspired or motivated to go take a\nsh\nyou're going to do it if you have to\nright you don't have to do it to go pee\nyou don't have to do it if you're hungry\nand i'm telling you this because i want\nyou to actually really\nsee this and feel this in your mind\nyou're tricking yourself into thinking\nthat you're stuck in a rut right if a\nlion walked into your house right now\nyou wouldn't have to search for\nmotivation to run from it\nyou wouldn't right you would just get\nmoving you'd run you'd take off right\nand so you have to realize you're\ntricking yourself into thinking that\nyou're in a rut in the first place and\ni'm going to give you obviously steps to\nget out of it but what it's really about\nmore than anything else is is starting\nsmall\nmore than anything else\na lot of times\nyou're not taking action because you're\nthinking about all of the things that\nneed to be done\nversus what's the next thing that needs\nto be done you're thinking about all of\nthe things right if you\nif you want to go to the gym and you're\nnot motivated you're stuck in a rut\nphysically and your body's not where you\nwant it to be and you know you need to\ngo to the gym it's not because of the\nfact that you have to go to the gym and\ndo a curl it's because of the fact that\nyou have to you're thinking not of that\none curl you're thinking of every single\nexercise every single thing that you\nneed to do getting into the car well\nfirst off getting dressed getting\nyourself ready making sure that you have\nwater putting on your shoes getting into\nthe car going to the gym\nlifting the weights doing every single\nset that you and you start thinking\nabout all of them versus what's the next\nthing they need to do right you're not\nthinking about one curl you're thinking\nabout all of the curls all of the sets\nthat you need to do all of the reps that\nyou need to do\nand sometimes\nyou have to take it back to just the\nsimplest form\nright there's two things you need to\nfocus on number one is your mind number\ntwo is your body right\nin order to get out of a rut you need to\ntrick or\nget two things moving you need to get\nyour mind moving and you need to get\nyour body moving right so when i say get\nyour mind moving find something\nput on something that makes you feel\nbetter whether it's a certain song that\nyou love that you want to dance to\nwhether it's this podcast whether it's\nsomeone else's podcast maybe it's\nanother motivational speaker somebody\nthat makes you feel like you know what i\ncan do this maybe it's david goggins you\nneed someone to yell at you and scream\nat you and cuss at you or maybe you need\nsomeone\ninspirational or motivation or someone\nspiritual i don't know what it is but\nyou need to trick your mind in a way to\nget your mind actually moving so that's\nthe first thing i think about what can\nyou do to get your mind moving\nsecond thing you gotta think about is\nyour body you just have to physically\nmove your body once again i said if you\nhave to go to the bathroom you're going\nto get up and go to the bathroom stuck\nin a rut you're not going to pee on\nyourself right if you're hungry you're\nnot going to starve yourself you're\ngoing to get up and you're going to take\nsmall action now i realize that going to\nthe bathroom and getting food are not\ngoing to create this incredible life\nthat you want to create but sometimes\nyou just got to take the action that you\nneed to even when you feel like [ __ ] and\nyour body will catch up to you right so\nmotivation can come from the mind\nmotivation can come from the body so\nthat comes to the very first thing so\nout of the seven tips i'm going to give\nyou number one is to move your body\nwhatever it is you need to do\ndo not negotiate with your mind if you\nfeel like you're stuck in a rut\nnobody's stuck in a rut moving like i\nsaid you're always stuck in a rut and\nyou don't feel right and you don't feel\nmotivated when you're sitting on the\ncouch and you're looking at instagram\nhey delete instagram already get rid of\nit if you have to if it's getting in the\nway of holding you and holding you back\nfrom the dreams that you want get rid of\nit right move your body if you're not\nmoving your body you find it hard to\nmove your body i need you to get enough\nmotivation to get up and get some form\nof caffeine in you if you need to\nsomething that's going to get you moving\nif you want something that's that's not\ncaffeine you can do b12 right take\nvitamins whatever it is that you have to\ndo to get your body moving\nwhat happens is\nonce again inaction creates more in\naction action creates more action so if\nyou go you know what\ni don't feel 100 i don't feel ready to\ndo this\nall you have to do\nforce your body to move get up do some\njumping jacks put on some music whatever\nit is that you have to do right\ntake small steps which is number two\nnumber one is get your body moving\nnumber two is to take small steps\nonce again as i said earlier if you're\nnot taking action towards the life that\nyou want towards the things that you\nneed to do it's because you're thinking\nabout doing all of the things that you\nneed to do\neven though there's no possible ways you\ncan do all of them at one time right\njust think about okay i need to get in\nshape all i need to do is go to the gym\nand just do one curl that's it\ni don't need to do anything else i just\nneed to do one curl\nand when you get to the gym and you do\none curl and just make that the only\nthing you need to do don't even you\ndon't have to do anything else if you go\ninto the gym and you do one curl and\nwalk out that's a win because you've at\nleast gone in the right direction of\nwhat it is that you want but i guarantee\nyou when you get to the gym and you do\none curl you have a weight in your hand\nyou're like you know what i might as\nwell just do a couple more and you do a\ncouple more and then what happens is\nyour body starts to create endorphins\nyour body starts to create all of the\nfeel-good chemicals that i'll talk about\nright\nwhat you do is your body will trick\nitself into going you know what this\nactually feels good maybe i should keep\ndoing this and then you do it again and\nyou do it again and then you realize 45\nminutes later you're not focusing on the\nwhole 45 minutes realize that you're\nfocusing on just the next curl just the\nnext squat just the next\nfoot in front of the other in your walk\non the treadmill whatever it is you need\nto do\ntake the small steps don't worry about\neverything just worry about what the\nnext thing is in front of you so that's\nnumber two to get overrun is to take the\nsmall steps number three this is\nsomething that not enough people talk\nabout celebrate your small wins if you\ngot up you put on some clothes and you\ngot in the car and you got to the gym\nand you walked inside of the gym that's\na win right you've got to give yourself\ncelebrations for all of these little\nteeny tiny micro wins right\ndance\nafter you get that first set done you\nknow if you're i have a gym in my garage\nright if if i don't feel like it\ni'm gonna put on the music i'm gonna\ndrink some caffeine and i'm gonna make\nmyself feel really good i'm gonna dance\naround my garage and get my body moving\nand i'm going to celebrate the small\nwins this is the reason why this is\nimportant number one it gets the body\nmoving\nyou get on the good music and the good\nmusic always makes you feel better\nbut your brain will release serotonin\nand dopamine and serotonin and dopamine\nmake you feel good and when you feel\ngood\nyour body and brain want more of those\nfeel-good chemicals how do you get the\nfeel-good chemicals by celebration\nthat's when they're released so if you\nyou know if i'm like i don't feel like i\nwant to work out\ni'm like oh god i gotta i'm sitting on\nthe couch i'm like i just gotta force\nmyself to get up and do it i force\nmyself i get my clothes on i walk into\nmy garage and i'm like i'm just going to\nlift one thing right i lift one thing\nthat's all that it is\ni'm like all right i did what i needed\nto do let me put on some music let me\ncelebrate this success and when i\ncelebrate and i move around and i dance\nand i start to force myself to feel good\nwhich is something that is 100 possible\nfor every single person right now is to\nforce yourself to feel good\nby having little celebrations i go i\nactually feel really good you know what\ni actually could do another set and i do\nanother set and i move around i make\nmyself feel good i put on some of my\nfavorite songs i put on my feel good\nmusic i put on my happy playlist\nand i do the next set and i do the next\nthing i celebrate every single one of\nthem and what happens is it start i\nstart to get momentum on my side\nright\nwhich is and i think i'm going to talk\nabout in just a minute but i'm not there\nyet number four\nis to turn off your phone\nyes turn off your damn phone your phone\nis killing you from the dreams that you\nlike killing all of the dreams that you\nwant in your life because it's taking\nyou away getting on facebook getting on\ninstagram like all of those things are\ngreat i think that they're great if\nthey're used correctly but i think\nthey're misused by most people so turn\noff your phone then what do you need to\ndo turn off all of your electronics\nright\nif you just turn off your phone and you\nturn off your electronics and you go you\nknow what\ni'm just going to sit here\nyou're going to get bored and you're\ngoing to go i have to have something to\ndo why because humans at this point in\ntime were so addicted to doing things\nit's really hard to just sit on your\ncouch and stare at the ceiling trust me\ni've tried it right i do it sometimes i\nforce myself to literally stare at the\nat the ceiling i'm like i'm not gonna\nlook at my phone i'm not gonna look at\nelectronics i'm not gonna do something\nright now i'm gonna literally just sit\nand be but for most people you get to\nthat point you're like i gotta find\nsomething to do i've got to do something\nand you get bored because your phone is\noff your tv is off none of this you\ncan't turn your computer on you can't go\nonto youtube tick tock instagram\nfacebook none of those things you'll get\nbored and you'll go i gotta do something\nguess what\nthat's what you want you want to be able\nto do something so literally you force\nyourself into a mini boredom which is\nthen going to make you then take action\nthe way that you want to\nso then what do you do okay i'm in this\nmini boredom i feel like i want to do\nsomething\nnumber five\nis focus on just the next 60 seconds i\ndon't care about the next five minutes i\ndon't care about tomorrow i don't care\nabout the next hour i don't care about\nlater on today i don't care to spell out\nthis afternoon this evening any of those\nthings the next 60 seconds if i'm on the\ncouch and i'm bored because my my i have\ni got no instagram i got no facebook i\ngot no tick tock i got none of those\nthings that come and save me i can't\nturn on netflix because my tv's off i\ncan't go onto youtube because my\ncomputer's off i take all those things\naway i go okay\ni want to do something like i feel like\ni should do something\nwhat do you do\nokay in the next 60 seconds what can i\ndo to get me closer to this goal that i\nwant that's going to get me out of a rut\nof you know the body that i want for\ninstance if we keep going down that\nroute what can i do in the next 60\nseconds i can do\n20 push-ups\nall right let's just do 20 push-ups and\nthat alone the next 60 seconds that's\ngoing to take me into the direction that\ni want to move with my life\nthat's the key what can i do in the next\n60 seconds it's going to move me into\nthe direction of where i want to go with\nmy life\nand you can ask yourself this question\nis what i'm doing right now getting me\ncloser to or further from my goals is\nwhat i'm doing right now i'm going to be\ncloser to it further from our goals okay\nso then over those next 60 seconds boom\n20 push-ups maybe i put on some feel\ngood music maybe i'd celebrate a little\nbit maybe i get all excited i get that\nhappy feeling get those dopamine the\nserotonin all of those things i start to\nfeel a little bit better\nall right cool i'm starting i don't feel\nlike amazing but i'm starting to feel a\nlittle bit better you know what i'm\ntalking about you've done this before\nright you start to feel all right maybe\ni could do another set of 20 push-ups\nwhatever it is\nall right that brings us to number six\nwhich is ride the momentum now i'm\nstarting to feel just a little bit maybe\nnot a whole lot better but just a little\nbit better i'm gonna celebrate i'm gonna\nget that serotonin i'm gonna get that\ndopamine i'm gonna get the music plan\ni'm gonna get the dancing gone we get\nthe celebrating going now that it's\nrolling i want to keep it rolling and\nthis is the important part is to make\nsure that when you start to feel the\nmomentum you don't let the momentum stop\nand you ride the momentum until you're\ndone right i always say that if you're\nat the very top of a really big hill and\nyou take a 15 pound bowling ball and i\ndecide that i'm gonna let the bowling\nball go and i let it go\nand then i immediately stop it\nit's very easy to stop if i immediately\nstop it or a half a second later i stop\nit why because the bowling ball hasn't\ngot any momentum on its side it hasn't\ngot any momentum going to where it's\ntrying to go to where it needs to go\nbut if i'm at the top of a 400 pound or\n400 foot\nhill and i'm like all right\nnow i'm gonna try to stop it at the\nbottom of the hill\nthat 15 pound bowling ball weighs a\nwhole hell of a lot more it feels like\nit weighs a whole hell of a lot more\nbecause it's got so much more momentum\nyou're not going to reach out your hands\nand try to stop a bowling ball at the\nbottom of a hill\nit's going to break some fingers it's\ngoing to break your hand something's\ngoing to happen and so when you start to\nfeel the momentum ride the momentum\nbecause it's very easy to stop the\nmomentum at the top of the hill you want\nto at least start to get down a little\nbit a little bit down the hill a little\nbit downhill so it starts moving a\nlittle bit quicker so once i start\ngetting the next 60 seconds and i go\nokay what's the next 60 seconds i can i\nstart to feel a little bit better what's\nthe next 60 seconds feel like and i'm\npushing myself just a little bit more\nright and then if i want to to add on\ntop of that one of the best ways to do\nthat is tip number seven\nis to get around other people right\nnow when i say get around other people i\nmean get around the right people right\nyou got to make sure you're getting\naround people who are actually going to\nbe holding yourself to a higher standard\nuh earlier in the week on wednesday i\nwork out with a group of men there's\nlike 15 20 of us that work out every\nsingle wednesday it's just the way that\nwe've been doing it now for the past\nthree months right this wednesday my\nalarm went off i did not want to wake up\nthis wednesday didn't feel like it it\nwas really freaking cold outside we work\nout outside and i was like no way\ni don't want to do it and i felt that\nlittle voice inside of my head say rob\njust stay asleep\nand i was like\nno i hate you little voice this is a\nlittle voice that's trying to keep me\nfrom all of my dreams i like to call it\nthe inner [ __ ] and i when i hear the\nlittle inner [ __ ] and i can identify it\ni've got to do the exact opposite of\nwhat it says and i was like oh\nall right i got to get up\ni go\nand i didn't want to work out but i knew\nthat if i was around 15 to 20 other guys\nthat were working out it would start to\nmake me feel better it would start to\ngive me motivation to be around those\npeople that are also doing something\namazing with their life\nso i forced myself\ni was like i'm not going to negotiate\nwith you\ni got some coffee\ngot out the door immediately went there\nand we worked out for an hour and 21\nminutes according to my heart rate\nmonitor and i burned almost 1100\ncalories over a thousand calories in a\nworkout i would not i promise you this i\nwould not have burned a thousand\ncalories i don't know if i've ever\nburned a thousand calories in a workout\nby myself but i burned a thousand over a\nthousand calories in that hour and 21\nminutes i definitely wouldn't have gone\nfor an hour and 21 minutes either but\nthe thing is when you're around other\npeople with the same mission that have\nmomentum going on their side there's\nsomething that happens cohesively when\neverybody else is working towards the\nsame mission so are there other people\nthat are working towards getting better\nin their mind that are working towards\ngetting better in their business that\nare working towards getting better in\nthe relationship they're working towards\ngetting better in their finances that\nare working towards getting better in\ntheir bodies whatever it is that you can\nget yourself and even if you don't feel\nlike it you can place yourself around\nthem and being around them motivates you\nto be better\nthat's what you've got to think about\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well it's very\nsimple\nlife is not hard\nwell okay let me let me rephrase that\nlife\nis not hard to understand"
