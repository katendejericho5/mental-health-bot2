    "transcript": "i will not let my happiness or my\ndepression be left up to chance and too\nmany of our lives are left up to chance\nand we just go with the flow\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about my\nnumber one goal for 2022\nand what i would hope that you actually\nadopt as your number one goal for 2022\nas well and i uh i adopted this\nframe of mind last year this year that\nwe're in 2021 and it was my number one\ngoal and usually when we sit down and we\nsay okay these are my new year's\nresolutions this is what i wanted i want\nto work on my body i want to work in my\nbusiness i want to make more money i\nwant to have better relationships i want\nto be a better boyfriend girlfriend\nspouse\na better parent\nyou can look at all those and all of\nthose are great but i have one kind of\numbrella\nover all of those things and i had it\nlast year i'm gonna have it this year\nagain and this is to live my life in\n2022 as if\nthe very last day i'm going to be alive\nis december 31 2022 so my goal is to\nlive every day like i'm dying every\nsingle day my goal is this is my last\nday on earth i'm going to live like this\nis my last day and i'm gonna have\neverything build up to as if this is my\nlast year that i'm going to be on earth\nbecause ultimately\nlet's be real i don't know if this is\ngoing to be my last year on earth i\ndon't know if this is going to be your\nlast year on earth and it very well\ncould be i say it all of the time but\n150 000 people didn't wake up from their\nsleep or didn't\n150 000 people woke up yesterday did not\nwake up today in saying that knowing\nokay one day it's going to be the day i\ndon't know hopefully it's a long time\nfrom now one day it is going to be the\nlast day of my life whether i realize it\nor whether i don't and so i'm going to\npretend like the year 2023 doesn't even\nexist it doesn't exist in my mind i'm\nnever going to see it i'm going to live\nlike that now hopefully i do see it but\ni'm going to live as if it was\nabsolutely the last year of my life and\ngoing through this last year with that\nnumber one intention\nhas shifted and changed a lot of things\nin my life and i told you this last year\nthat this was my goal if you've been\nlistening for a long time and i'm going\nto tell you that this year coming up it\nis also my goal again as well because as\ni said we're going to die it's going to\nhappen\nand you're not going to if this was the\nlast year of your life you're not going\nto do things that you don't want to do\nif i said hey today is the last day that\nyou're going to be alive you're going to\ntake no actions today\nthat are not things that you actually\nwant to do and this is important because\nif you've been listening long enough you\nknow that i live my life through a lens\nof if it's not a yes it's a no and so\nwhen you think to yourself if this was\nmy last day\nand i'm looking at my schedule and what\ni have to do today would this be what i\nwould do\nor would i do something different is my\nday is today a full guess for me like am\ni so excited to go into my day or am i\nwaking up kind of\noh god i guess i gotta go ahead and do\nthis i guess i gotta go to work right so\nif i've had those feelings before when i\nworked for someone else there's nothing\nwrong with working for anybody i'm just\nthe type of person where i can't work\nfor anybody it's just not built into me\nbut if you're going to a job\nwhen you're driving to your job are you\nexcited about the opportunities that you\nhave are you excited about what it is\nthat you're going to do is your job a\nfull yes for you is your relationship\nthat you're in a full yes for you i've\nhad people that have emailed me it's\nkind of funny since the very first time\nthat i did my\nyes no episode about a year and a half\nago and they're like i have changed so\nmany aspects of my life\ni have somebody who is a friend of mine\nthat literally got out of a relationship\na long term it was like five year\nrelationship\nbecause they listened to the episode and\nthey asked himself is my relationship\nthat i'm in a full yes\nand they started going through the\naspects of it thinking of it saying oh\nmy gosh it's actually not like i'm\nliving in a relationship and i love this\nperson and they're great but if i look\ninto to what the future looks like if we\nstay together am i like a full yes\nknowing that this is my one life when\nyou go through your day and you go\nthrough everything that you do\nthroughout the day ask yourself this\nquestion is what i'm doing right now\nfull yeah it's like is this something\nthat i'm a hundred percent yes i love\nthis so when i wake up in the morning\nand i the the coffee that i drink is it\ntoday is it is it coffee for me does\nthat feel like it's a full yes for me or\ndoes today feel like a tea day like i\nyou know coffee maybe it makes me a\nlittle bit more anxious than tea does so\nmaybe it today is more of a tea day or\nyou know what today it's actually\nneither one of them i don't need the\ncaffeine to get up and it might be on\nthe weekend and you might say you know\nwhat\ni don't need to put myself into a little\nbit more of an anxious state so is it\nthe coffee that you drink is it a hell\nyes for you is it the food that you eat\nin the morning is it a hell yes free is\nyour morning routine what's your morning\nroutine look like is it a hell yes for\nyou is it your your workout process is\nit a hell yes for you the people that\nyou're spending your morning with you\nknow if you're spending your morning and\nyou're just going straight into work in\nemails and everything and you're missing\nyour kids when they leave for school\nis that a hell yes for you i have a lot\nof people that that i've worked with in\nthe past one-on-one clients that are you\nknow very successful people they have\ngreat businesses and what's really\ninteresting is that their number one\ngoal\nis just to be able to start taking their\nkids to school every single morning\nbecause they love that routine\nand their business has taken so much\nfrom that they built a business to not\nhave time to drop their kids off at\nschool and they just love having that\npresent moment with them so if you look\nat your morning routine is there some\nchanges that you could make that would\nbe like hey this is a full hell\nyesterday this is a full yes this is\nwhat i want to do or are there aspects\nof it that you would want to shift\nokay going into work whether you have\nyour own business or you work for\nsomebody else is it a full yes for you\nas well like are you like yes this is\nwhat i want to do the\ntimes that i'm spending my waking hours\nthis is exactly what i want to be doing\nwith my life and all too often i find\npeople\nsettle\nthey do what they feel like they're\nsupposed to do and i understand if you\nhave a family or if you have a house and\nyou have bills that you have to pay\nthere are certain obligations that you\nhave built your built into your life i\nget it i understand it but what i always\nsay to people is if if your job\nis not like a hell yes for you\nokay well what would be a hell yes for\nyou you know can you make your job that\nyou currently have or your business that\nyou currently have\nlike full on yes this is what i want to\nbe doing is there ways to shift that can\nyou have a conversation with your\nmanager about some of the things that\nyou do so that your job can be more of a\nhell yes for you\nor are you working a job where you're\njust showing up you're going to a\ncubicle and you're doing things that you\nhave to do and you know that there's no\nway around it okay\nmaybe you look at that and you say well\nif this is my last day on earth it's my\nlast year on earth i'm going to live\nlike i'm dying this year and i know i\ngot to go to work because i got to pay\nthe bills if this is my last year on\nlife\nlast year with life\ncan i do something that i actually love\nto do can i do something that feels like\nit's it's\nworking towards the right direction so\nmaybe it's like you know is there\nanother job that might pay you about the\nsame maybe it pays you a little more\nmaybe it pays you a little less but you\nfeel\nso good going into that job doing what\nit is that you're doing is it a hell yes\nfor you is it something that you want to\ndo the the route that you take to work\nis it a hell yes for you you know maybe\nyou've got a route to work that's the\nfaster way but maybe you could go a more\nscenic more beautiful route that puts\nyou in nature that feels better for you\nand you just enjoy that drive more\nsometimes enjoying the drive is worth\nthe extra time so like i'll give you a\ngood example when we drive from austin\ndown to san antonio to go see my\nfiance's parents there's a route that\nwill take us to san antonio and it's\nabout 15 minutes shorter if we take all\nof the interstates or we can drive\nthrough texas hill country then we can\nsee nature and it's beautiful and you\ncan see the sunrise you can see the\nsunset and even though it takes 15\nminutes longer it makes the drive more\nenjoyable we go the extra 15 minutes\nbecause it makes the two to two hours\nand 15 minutes a more enjoyable process\nis there a route that you can do in that\nthat would be something that would\nbetter for you the route that you take\nto work when you get into your car\nis your car like a full hell yes for you\ni'm not saying you have to drive like a\nlamborghini or a ferrari or anything\nlike that but can you make the car that\nyou currently have more of a hell yes\nfor you can you make uh make some\nadjustments and maybe\nchange your car around a little bit or\nmaybe just in general is there another\ncar that you could get that could be a\nhell yes for you there's all these\nlittle teeny tiny changes that you start\nto go through in your life you start to\nmake shifts so that you actually enjoy\nwhat you're doing i had a conversation\nwith a friend of mine\nvery successful guy he's in his 50s and\nat the time he's worth about 100 million\ndollars and i was about to interview him\nfor the podcast about five years ago\nfour years ago whatever it was\nand at that point in time i was driving\na 2007 hyundai santa fe and i could\nafford another car at that point in time\nbut my\nmy mindset around this car was that i'm\ngonna run this freaking thing into the\nground like\ni was getting pride in the fact that i\nwas gonna run this thing to the ground\nand he said he said one thing to me that\ni'll never forget\nhe wasn't trying to talk me into\nanything\nbut we were talking about cars and stuff\nand he drives like a lexus nothing you\nknow no ferraris or lamborghinis or any\nof that type of stuff and he goes you\nknow what\ni just find that when i drive a car that\ni enjoy i show up better like i show up\nbetter\nfor whatever it is i'm doing when i get\nthere and i enjoy myself more in that\ncar and he gave me this whole how he\nfeels\nand immediately i was like\ni gotta buy something else and i told\nhim this i was like i have to buy\nsomething else and about a month later i\nwent and bought a truck because i had\nyou know found the truck that i wanted\nit you know got really good gas mileage\ncompared to everything else that i'd\nseen and i'd always wanted a truck my\nentire life and i was like you know what\ni want to get this truck and i got it\nand i realized what he was talking about\nlike i instead of getting into my car\nand there's a there's a energy in the\nback of my head of like yeah screw this\nhyundai santa fe it was like i was\nactually excited to get into my car\nbecause i loved the truck that i had and\nso there was this little shift\nand did it cost me more money sure but\nwhat happened was i realized exactly\nwhat he was saying was true is that i\nshowed up better to everything that i\ndid i wasn't there wasn't a part of me\nthat was like oh my gosh i'm gonna have\nto i'm gonna have to park my 2007\nhyundai santa fe in the back so nobody\nsees me driving my you know it's a light\nblue 2007 hyundai santa fe it's called\nthe the mob mobile because it looked\nlike i was about to drop kids off at\nschool or at soccer practice and i don't\nhave any kids but i was driving the\nfreaking thing around still from years\nand years and years when i was an\noutside sales rep because it used to\nstore stuff really well\nand i was kind of embarrassed by the car\nbut took some pride and i'm going to run\nthis thing to the ground\nand then i was i had this conversation i\nshifted i was like i'm going to buy\nsomething new something that i enjoy and\ni bought it and i was like he's right he\nwas right he was 100 right i show up\nbetter the entire time that i'm driving\nlike if you think of how many hours you\ndrive over the course of an entire year\nwell shouldn't those hours be more\nenjoyable you know the music that you\nlisten to the podcasts that you listen\nto the youtube stations that you can\nlisten to as you're driving like are all\nof those things yes is for you if this\nwas your last year on life what would\nyou be doing would you be listening to\nsomething that you enjoy more would you\nbe filling your mind with something that\nmakes you feel better so that you show\nup better so that you can impact more\npeople and so you start to think of all\nthese little teeny tiny aspects of your\nlife\nin the the everything that you have and\ngo you know what maybe i should shift\nthis maybe i should change this around a\nlittle bit you know you look at the the\npeople that you work with the people\nthat are around you maybe you like your\njob but you hate your co-workers okay\nwell is there a way to shift that so\nthat you can enjoy every aspect of your\njob more often is uh you know the people\nin your life the people that you hang\nout with the most are you like full hell\nyes on these people or and i put up a\npost on instagram about the other day\nlike you've got to be okay with\nunfollowing some people from your life\nsame way that you unfollow somebody on\nfacebook or instagram when they're not\nyou know they're putting up too much\nposts that make you feel bad or they're\nnot you know they're just too negative\nor in the comment section talking trash\nwith people and you can see their\ncomments pop up when you're scrolling\nthrough facebook because they you know\nwent on a political post or whatever it\nis and started bashing people and you\ncan see those things well are there\npeople that are kind of like that as\nwell in your life where you're like i\nshouldn't follow this if this person\nwere on facebook and i saw the way that\nthey're talking to people around me i\nsaw the way they're treating myself and\nall of this would i unfollow would i\nblock them on facebook and you start to\nlook at the people in your life and\nchange those things the the place that\nyou go out to lunch the food that you're\neating your drive home or all of those\nthings hell yes is for you or are they\njust things that you're just you've been\ndoing them for so long their your mind\njust kind of goes numb and you don't\neven pay attention anymore and so you\nstart to go through every single aspect\nyour drive home your evening routines\nright is it you come home and you just\nput something in the microwave and you\nspend two hours watching netflix and\nthen you just go to bed at\n11 o'clock and you know you're kind of\ntired and all that stuff do you have an\nevening routine that fills you up that\nmakes you feel good do you are you\nreading books instead are you journaling\nare you doing a short meditation an\nevening routine to set your subconscious\nup the way that you want to um the time\nthat you get in bed the bed that you\nhave you know like there's all of these\nlittle tiny things that if we were to go\nthrough with with a fine-tooth comb and\ntry to pull out everything that we like\nand keep it and pull out everything we\ndon't like and replace it what aspects\nof your life would you change would you\nbe like you know what i kind of hate my\nbed i'm going to get a more comfortable\nbed because this is my last year on\nearth and start to change all of these\nthings you go through your life and find\nout\nwhat is a full hell yes for you and what\nis you know a hell no for you are you\ndoing what you want to do and this is an\nimportant question i'm going to ask you\nand i ask this all the time a lot of\ntimes when i'm on lives and i'm on zoom\ncalls and people are you know i\nliterally did this earlier today i was\non a\nconsultation call with somebody i was\nconsulting somebody who has a business\nand their business does a few million\ndollars a year and i said hey talk to c\nand i said hey you know we're going into\nreally deep of things we're talking\nabout here but\nhey man what do you want and he's like\nwhat do you mean i was like what do you\nwant like what do you actually want when\nwe can build out the systems and the\nprocesses and the marketing and the\nsales team and all of this stuff and we\ncan help you with that but what do you\nactually want because i don't want to\nbuild something and have you put a whole\nlot of time into something when you\ndon't even actually want that thing\nbecause if you have something that you\nwant you're going to put hours into it\nand be more focused into making it\nbetter if you have something that you\ndon't want it's going to make building\nthis team building this product that\nyou're selling building this offer\nbuilding the marketing behind it putting\nthe sales funnel together and putting\nthe video sales letter and all those\nthings together\nit's going to be more energy consuming\nto have to force yourself to do it\nversus feeling like hell yeah i want to\ndo this thing and so you look at and ask\nyourself like what do you actually want\nand that's a great question to write\ndown on pen and paper like what do i\nwant\nand just make it as broad as you\npossibly can and answer that question\nthen you can take the exact same\nquestion and you can put it in each\naspect of your life what do i want in my\nfamily\nand then you can journal through that\nwhat do i want in my body what do i want\nin my health what do i want in my\nrelationships what do i want in my\nbusiness what do i want in my finances\nwhat do i want and the route that i take\nto work what do i want in the food that\ni eat what do i want\nin my morning routine what do i want in\nmy evening routine what do i want to do\nwith my free time what do i want to do\nin my traveling and you can go very\nvague what do i want and then just see\nwhat you want and you can very greatly\ngo what do i want in my business and you\ncan say okay what i want my business you\ncould journal through it you could look\nthrough and say okay\nwhat do i want in my sales team what do\ni want in my marketing if you look at\nyour relationships and you say what do i\nwant in my marriage what do i want in my\nin my relationship with my children what\nam i what are my relationship with my\nmom and my dad my brother my sister my\ncousins what do i want in every single\naspect of my life and you start to plan\nout to build what would be the perfect\nlife knowing that you might not be able\nto take action on every single thing\nright now but what do you want\nnow let's go a little bit deeper you\nlook at every single one of those as\nwell and this is a great exercise i\nimplore all of you to do this\nplease do this then you ask yourself\nwhat do i not want so what do i not want\nin my life uh you know what i don't want\nany more negative people okay great i\ndon't want conversations that don't have\nthe energy of transformation in them\nanymore\nwhat do i not want in my relationships\nwhat do i not want in my family what do\ni not want in my business what do i not\nwant in my marketing what do i not want\nin my uh my sales process what do i not\nwant in every single aspect of what i do\nwhat do i not want in my car what do i\nnot want in the drive to work and you\nstart to figure out what is that you\nwant and what is it you don't want\nyou'll start to realize that you have a\nlot of processes and things that you go\nthrough in routines every single day\nthat you don't even want to do and if\nthis were the last time that you're\ngonna be like this is your last day on\nearth\nwhat are you gonna do about it like\nwould you want to do those things that\nyou don't want to do anymore no and so\nwhy would we act as if we have forever\nwhy would we act as if we have a million\nyears on this earth why we act as if\nwe're just guaranteed tomorrow if we're\njust guaranteed another year and you\nstart to build out what would be from\nthis process you start to build out the\nperfect day for you the perfect life for\nyou and something that is going to be\nexciting for you to wake up and get into\nand that's going to make every single\nday better but what's going to happen is\nyou're going to start to notice that if\nyou do this and you get very diligent on\ndoing the things you want and doing not\ndoing things you don't want you're going\nto start to actually realize you're\nbuilding your perfect life and i have a\nfriend who\nhe was a number 30 employee in facebook\nand when he got fired from facebook\nright before they went public a few\nmonths before they went public\nand when he got fired he lost all of his\nstock in facebook\nand if he would have just been there for\na few more months when they went public\nhe would have made 180 million dollars\nand he went into a depression because he\nwent from literally you know i could\nhave made 180 million dollars to i have\nnothing right now and one of the phrases\nthat will stick with me for the rest of\nmy life is the thing that got him out of\ndepression is he asked himself what\nwould make me happy like what would make\nme happy make this massive list of all\nof the things that made him happy\nand the phrase that he said that i'll\nnever forget the day i die i will not\nlet my happiness or my depression be\nleft up to chance and too many of our\nlives are left up to chance and we just\ngo with the flow he became very diligent\non making sure that he looked at his\nhappy list every single morning he\nlooked at his schedule next to his happy\nlist every single morning he said how\ncan i put as many of these things in\nhere as possible like what do i what do\ni love what makes me happy going on\nwalks okay how can i do a walk in the\nforest outside of austin because we have\na lot of trails around here how can i do\na walk today in that hour long break\nthat i have for work and he started\nbuilding in everything that makes him\nhappy everything that he wants into his\nlife and he started realizing that his\ndepression slowly started going away\nbecause he wasn't doing anything they\ndidn't want to do anymore and so i want\nyou to realize that your day will come\nmy day will come all of our days will\ncome at some point in time it just makes\nmore sense for us to live a life that we\nabsolutely love but it starts with\nliving each day and the next year that\nwe have living a life that we love so be\nintentional with every single thing that\nyou do and you will realize that you\nhave built a life that you actually love\nhey thanks so much
