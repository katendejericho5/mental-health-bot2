    "transcript": "this is the reason why people care about\nsocial media that's why people care\nabout how many likes they get this is\nthe reason why people care about how\nmany followers they have how many\ncomments they have opinions don't matter\nat all 99 of the opinions that come in\nto you you can just throw them out\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nother people's opinions\nand how to take advice from other people\ndepending on who they are and so\nthe question is not to take advice or\nnot to to take advice or not to take\nadvice the question is really more than\nanything else whose opinions actually\nmatter to you and whose opinions\nactually don't if you're in a situation\nright now where you have been\nbasing your entire life off of\neverybody's opinion of you you're\nprobably not in the position that you\nwant to be in life and so it's really\nimportant to\nthink about the people that give you\nadvice and then look at where their life\nis and see if there's somebody that you\nwant to take advice from and so that's\nwhat we're going to talk about we're\ngoing to talk about how to not care\nabout other people's opinions and how to\ntake advice from people who actually\nmatter and let's take a step back before\nwe talk about that let's talk about why\nwhy we care as humans so much about\nfitting in why we care about other\npeople's opinions so much and how if we\nallow ourselves to be held back by those\nopinions we're never going to have the\nlife that we want to so\nwhy do we care about other people's\nopinions in the first place the thing\nthat you have to realize is we are\ntribal beings if you go back a hundred\nthousand years it was impossible for us\nto survive without the tribe we had to\nhave the tribe around us it was\nnecessary for us to survive for us to\nhunt for us to take care of the children\nfor us to gather food and have shelter\nall of that stuff it was necessary we\nhad to fit in in order to survive now a\nhundred thousand years ago if you did\nnot fit in with your tribe and you were\npushed out of the tribe you would die\nand so there's a part of us deep down\ninside we're like i have to fit in with\npeople or i will die because that part\nof your brain still exists the\ndifference now though\nis if you don't fit in with anybody\ndeath is not attached to that you can\nstill pay your bills you can still\nfeed yourself you can still have food\nwater shelter clothing all of that if\nyou don't fit in with society and that's\nthe beautiful thing is you can now be\nyour own\nsovereign being that does whatever the\nhell that you want to as long as you're\nnot hurting other people you know it\ndoesn't matter as i always say you guys\nall know her nancy in accounting it\ndoesn't matter what she thinks about you\nwho gives a [ __ ] about nancy's opinion\nit doesn't matter if anything if you're\nlike you know what i want to start a\npodcast but i'm so worried about what\nnancy and accounting is going to think\nof me i don't give a sh who cares about\nwhat nancy in accounting thinks of you\nis she someone that you want to take\nadvice from\nbut there's still that part of our brain\nthat's like oh but i want to fit in but\ni want to fit in and so\nthere is\nnature of how we actually are and we've\ngot to be aware of that and then there's\nreality in 2020 2022 23 and so on and so\nforth of what actually matters this is\nthe reason why people care about social\nmedia that's why people care about how\nmany likes they get this is the reason\nwhy people care about how many followers\nthey have how many comments they have\nwhere if somebody posts a picture and it\ndoesn't get the response that they want\nto right away but they're like oh my god\ni gotta delete it because clearly i'm\nnot being accepted for what i post this\nis why social media can be such a a\naddicting but also traumatic thing for\nsome people is because we literally have\nthat part of our brain that is just\nlooking for other people's exceptions\npeople want to look like we we want to\nbe liked like let's be real we want to\nbe liked we want to fit in in some sort\nof way in the problem with that and\nthere's a really great phrase that jim\ncarrey says is he says your need for\nacceptance can make you invisible in\nthis world\nand if you fit in\nyou're going to be invisible think about\nevery great person that you let you look\nup to it could be lebron james it could\nbe oprah it could be the rock will smith\nelon musk it could be any of those\npeople could be many different people\nit could be some of the spiritual\nleaders you might look up to like jesus\nyou might look up to buddha you might\nlook up to all these different spiritual\nleaders none of these people actually\nfit in and so there's a part of us that\nwants to fit in but then we look at\nthese great leaders and the people that\nwe look up to we're like well they're\nnot like anybody else\ndo i want to fit in or do i want to be\nlike my idols\nand not fit in with the world\nevery great person in society that you\nlook up to is an outlier in some sort of\nway and so the last thing that you\nshould want to do\nis fit in with everybody else so let's\nstart off by by understanding that the\nlast thing that you should want to do is\nfit in with everybody else because if\nyou fit in with everybody else we can\nagree and there's nothing wrong with the\nway other people live their lives\nbecause it's their their choice and how\nthey want to live their life is\ncompletely fine and they're living their\nlife from their own consciousness that\nthey have but if you look around at all\nof society and you're like uh yeah i\ndon't want that and if you're listening\nto podcasts you probably don't want that\nwell then we should actually know nature\nwants me to fit in but i don't want to\nfit in so i'm going to have to fight\nagainst a little bit of nature on my\nside\nto be able to create the life that i\nwant to the thing that's really\ninteresting about it as well as well is\nthat\nwe want to be accepted\nbut if we don't\ndo anything amazing in this world we're\nnot ever going to stand out but if we\nwant to do something amazing in this\nworld\nyou will get haters\nand this is one thing that really holds\npeople back from creating the business\nthat they want for the social media that\nthey want the you know the following\nthat they want going and speaking on\nstage whatever starting a podcast a\nyoutube station uh creating the jewelry\ncompany that they want is that if you\nstand out if you are an outlier you will\nnaturally start to get haters and one of\nthe things that that i know that's down\nin australia someone the phrases that\nthey say is tall poppy syndrome you know\nif you look at a field of poppies and\none of them is standing up higher than\nall the other ones it's got to be cut\ndown it's tall poppy syndrome and so\nsociety sometimes will look at that\nperson that is standing out that is\ndoing something amazing and naturally\ntalk about that person if you're doing\nsomething amazing you're going to have a\nlot of people that love you just so you\nknow it's like 99 people love you but\nthat one percent will hate you in some\nsort of way if you try to do anything\nout of the ordinary you will have haters\nin some sort of way and sadly\nyou just have to accept that that's just\nthe way that the world is but you can't\nlet that one percent or below one\npercent of people hold you back from\nstepping into what it is that you want\nand the thing that you have to realize\nabout haters is that haters don't hate\nyou ever they don't hate you they hate\nthemselves because you are a reflection\nof them so if they see you doing\nsomething amazing and then they look at\ntheir lives and they're like i'm not\ndoing anything amazing what they do is\nthey try to cut you down\nto try to bring you down because if they\nbring you down then they naturally feel\nabove you and so it gives them this\nmomentary sense of self-worth\nand so that's just something that you\nhave to realize is number one you don't\nwant to fit in and number two when you\ndon't fit in you are going to naturally\nget some people who just hate you they\nwant to bring you down because it'll\ngive them a momentary sense of\nself-worth because their self-worth is\nso low that the only way that they can\nmake themselves feel better is to try to\nbring you down but it's not about being\nloved by everyone it's about knowing\nwhose opinions matter and whose opinions\ndon't matter and that's what we're going\nto really dive into today is whose\nopinions matter and whose opinions don't\nand so it'll be really good if you're\nnot driving your car if you have a pen\nand paper is pause me if you need to and\nmake a list of people in your life that\nyou're really close to whose opinions\nactually matter to you make a list\nand and what would you take their advice\nfor so say for instance your mom is on\nthe list because you really love her\nadvice\nbut your mom's never grown a business\nyou're not gonna take business advice\nfrom your mom\nright you might take maybe your parents\nhave a great relationship maybe you take\nit you take relationship advice from\nyour mom and dad but if you know they\nwork a job and they hate their job and\nthen you want to go start a business and\nlike no no no don't start a business\nbecause you know it's too there's too\nmuch going on the world's too scary and\nthey tell you that it's not a good\nbusiness idea\nwhy the hell would you take business\nadvice from them and so it's about\nknowing who you will take advice from\nand making that short list it shouldn't\nbe a big list my list is literally only\nthree people in this world whose advice\ni take three\nand then realizing what you would take\ntheir advice for\nso you have to think about that and if\nyou need to pause me in order to do it\npause me write those people down make\nthe list that you need to but the three\npeople who are on my list i know would\nnever steer me in the wrong directions\nthey are not jealous of me in any sort\nof way they want me to win they want the\nbest for me whenever i have something\nthat's amazing that happens in my life i\ncall them up and they celebrate with me\nand they're as truly truly as excited\nabout my success\nas\ni am that's how excited that they are so\nwho are those people in your life who\nare the people that want you to win who\nare the people that you know\nno matter what they want the best for\nyou that's the list of people that we\nwant to find out we want to write them\ndown and then next to their name\nwrite down what you really love about\nthem and what you would take advice from\nthem on so once again your parents maybe\nthey they've never started a business\nbefore but they have a great\nrelationship well yeah you could take\nrelationship advice maybe they've been\ngreat parents you can take parental\nadvice from them but as far as business\nadvice not so much you know if uh you\nhave a friend that's that's that's your\nyour friend that really wants you to\nsucceed and they're in business\nbut they're severely overweight maybe\nyou're not gonna take you know uh\nfitness advice or health advice from\nthem and so you just gotta kind of think\nof who do you go to and then what do you\ngo to them for so that you can start to\nrealize okay the most important people\nin my life they do have certain things\ni'm going to take advice from them on\nand they do have other things that i'm\nnot going to take advice from them on if\nsomebody says something negative to me\nif something somebody is trying to bring\nme down if somebody's trying to poke\nholes in my successes they're just not\non my list i don't even give it time if\nthey say something to me if i'm like hey\ni've got this idea and i just you know\nhappened to see it in passing and they\ntell me why it's a bad idea like for\ninstance if i have a friend who has\nnever started a business before and i\nhave this business idea and they're like\nno that would never work\ni'm not going to listen to them just\nbecause of the fact that it's it doesn't\nthe two of those things don't go inside\nthey don't go together someone who\ndoesn't run a successful business giving\nme business advice doesn't make any\nsense let's talk about other people's\nadvice because the thing that's\ninteresting about is people love\nto give advice they love to give\nunsolicited advice too so people love to\njust pop up out of nowhere and be like\nhey this is what you should do hey this\nis what you shouldn't do they love to\ngive their two cents do you know why\nit's called two cents\nbecause that's all it's worth it's not\nworth anything else besides two cents\nand you have to pay attention to\nwho these people are so i'll give you an\nexample of what i mean the the first\nexample that i gave was your mother\nright you have certain things that\nyou'll go to her for but if you have a\nbusiness idea you're not gonna go to\nyour business your mom for business\nadvice if you have a a friend who is\nyour brokest friend and they always talk\nabout how they don't have money and they\nalways talk about how poor they are and\nthey try to give you a relationship they\ntry to give you um financial advice\nyou're probably not going to listen to\nthem if they are trying to tell you\nabout the stock market or they're trying\nto tell you about crypto but you were if\nyou were to go into their bank account\nit's got 97 in it they're probably not\nthe best person to listen to if you have\none friend though that's made uh 500 000\nthis year off of crypto do you think you\nshould ask that person for crypto advice\nor some financial advice yeah maybe\nmaybe they'd be smart to ask\nbecause that person clearly has\nsomething that's working if you have a\nfriend as i said who's really overweight\nand they try to tell you what foods to\neat or they try to tell you how to work\nout they're probably not the best person\nto go to for that advice but if you have\na friend who is in really great shape\nand you not even i'm talking about like\nripped or anything but they just they\njust glow they're healthy their skin\nlooks good everything looks good about\nthem they have so much energy and they\ntry to give you some health advice\nthat'd probably be somebody who would be\ngood to listen to if you have a friend\nwho's\nruined every relationship that they've\nbeen in and blame it on how it's always\nthe guy or it's always the girl and it's\nnever their own fault it's probably not\nthe best person to listen to for\nrelationship advice you know if you have\na friend who runs a uh who's a ceo of a\n10 million dollar company\nthey'd probably be a really good person\nto ask business advice hey i've got this\nbusiness idea can i run it by you and\nyou can run that business idea by him\nbut let's say he's got a business that's\ndoing 10 million dollars a year he's a\ngreat person to go to for business but\nif his relationship with his wife is in\nshambles and his kids freaking hate him\nhe's probably not the best person to ask\nfor relationship advice or if he gives\nyou unsolicited relationship advice he's\nprobably not the best person to listen\nto and if his kids hate him and he's\ntrying to tell you about how to raise\nkids probably not the best person to\nlisten to and so you've got to start\nlooking at these people and if you could\nfind somebody who's got multiple of\nthese these pillars like their fitness\nis on point their business is on point\ntheir relationship is on point their\nparenting is on point they're a really\ngood person to get to help you with all\nof the different pillars in your life\nand so what you want to find out is who\nare these people\nwhat are you going to go to them for and\nthen you start to take an assessment of\nyour entire life and you want to say\nokay if i'm looking into the next year\nthese are the pillars of my life that i\nwant to improve on most i want to prove\nin my health i want to improve my\nfinances\ni want to take my business the next\nlevel i want to uh deepen my\nrelationship with my significant other\nand i want to become a better parent\nokay if those are your pillars that you\nwant to work off of who can you go to\nfor each of those things and so it's\nthis is people always ask like how can i\nfind mentors there's so many mentors\nthat are around you you know if you have\nsomebody that\nthey don't have to have a 100 million\ndollar your business but they have a\ngreat relationship and they're great\nparents that is somebody that can be an\namazing mentor for you with what they're\ngood at which is how to be a great\nparent and how to develop a great\nmarriage or relationship and so what you\ndo is you start to find the pillars of\nyour life that matter to you to the most\nin the next year two years five years\nand then you go who already exists in my\nlife that could be mentors for me in\nthis\nsituation and then if you find some\nholes maybe say okay well i don't really\nhave anybody in my life who who is\nreally killing it on the fitness side\nthey're not really killing it on the\nhealth side okay well then can you make\nit your mission to go and find those\npeople who can become your mentors\nwhether it's a free mentor or whether\nit's a paid mentor i think free mentors\nare great i think paid mentors are great\ni even think they're even better in most\ncases and so it's about finding the\npillars of your life\nfiguring out who can be your mentors in\nthose pillars finding the people who\nalready exist in your life whose advice\nyou truly actually want to take and then\nfinding out exactly what advice you want\nto take from one and the easiest way to\ndo this\nis to look at somebody and then ask\nyourself with this advice that they're\ngiving me\nwould i want to trade places with them\nso if somebody's giving me financial\nadvice do i want to trade places with\nthem financially\nokay someone's giving me health advice\ndo i want to trade places with them\nwith health if someone's giving me\nparenting advice do i want to trade\nplaces with them as far as being a\nparent if someone's giving me business\nadvice do i want to trade places with\nthem with our businesses and if\nsomebody's answer is yes then that's the\nperson that you want to take advice from\nbut if the answer to that is no\nthen i don't want to take their advice\nto heart in any sort of way so once\nagain if somebody's giving me fitness\nadvice and health advice but i'm looking\nat them and i'm like i don't want their\nbody well then i'm not going to listen\nwhat they tell me to do if someone's\ngiving me financial advice and i look at\nthem i'm like i don't want their bank\naccount well then i'm not going to take\nadvice from them i get i appreciate it i\nappreciate them wanting to help me\nbecause that's all people want to do is\nthey actually do want to help\nbut you have to realize who do you want\nto take advice from in all these\ndifferent categories and there's nothing\nwrong with someone giving you advice but\nyou have to be very very smart about\nwhose advice you take and whose advice\nyou don't because there's people in your\nlife who want you to succeed and there's\npeople in life that don't want you to\nsucceed the only ones that matter the\nones that want you to succeed and what\nthey are good at and then filling the\nholes of your pillars of your life and\nfinding the best mentors that you\npossibly can anybody who gives you\nadvice outside of that circle of\ninfluence does not\nmatter to you in taking advice move on\nsay hey thanks so much for that piece of\nadvice on finances\nthank you and then just whatever they\ntold you\nthrow it inside the trash and don't pay\nattention to it because all that really\nmatters is that you're taking advice\nfrom people who you want to trade places\nwith in this position that you are\ngiving it getting advice from and so the\nimportant thing is to realize opinions\ndon't matter at all 99 of the opinions\nthat come into you you can just throw\nthem out but there's a one percent of\nopinions who actually truly matter find\nthose people stay as close to them as\nyou possibly can go to them when you\nneed help be okay with asking for help\nand when they give you advice on the\nthing that you want to learn from them\ntake it implement it your life as fast\nas possible and you will see all of the\nimportant pillars of your life start to\nchange massively\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well that\nwas\nthe best money i've ever spent by far\ni'm never not working with a mentor\nagain"
