    "transcript": "you\nwill not die\nbut there is an old version of you\nthat must die to step into a new version\nof you\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to have a breakthrough in your life\nand to be a little bit honest with you\nthere's parts of this episode that might\nbe a little bit tough for you uh but if\nyou stick with me until the end i\npromise you it'll be worth it and it'll\nall pay off so i was watching a movie\nnot too long ago it's called honeyboy i\nrecommend it if you guys like shia\nlabeouf and he uh speaks in this\nit's kind of a a rough movie on his\nchildhood of being a childhood actor\nand i watched it and whenever i want to\nwhenever i hear something in my life i'm\nlistening to a conversation watching a\nmovie seeing a video listening to a\npodcast and an idea comes into my head\ni'll put it inside of my notes tab and\ni'll look back later on and be like hey\ni could do an episode on this and so\nthere's a quote inside of that movie in\nthe quote that it's you know shia\nlabeouf is playing his father talking to\nhim as a child and he said this quote it\nsays a seed has to be complete a seed\nhas to completely destroy itself in\norder to become a flower\nlet me say that again real quick\na seed has to completely destroy itself\nin order to become a flower\nand so when you take that idea and you\nput it into your life when you look at\nwho you want to be you might have to\ncompletely destroy not might when you\nlook at who you want to be you have to\ncompletely destroy who you are in order\nto become that version of yourself you\ncannot bring an old version of you into\nthe new version of you\nyou sometimes have to completely destroy\nwho you are in order to create yourself\ninto who you want to be\nyou literally have to become somebody\ndifferent and so when i think about\nmyself for instance and you could think\nabout yourself as i'm talking about this\nbecause\ni know my story you know your story\nif i think about myself today versus who\ni was five years ago who i was 10 years\nago who i was 15 years ago who i was 17\nyears ago before i got into personal\ndevelopment and realizing that i was\nfully in control of changing my life and\nnobody was going to come and save me i\nam a completely different person today\nthan i was when i didn't have an idea\nthat i could change myself when i looked\nat the world as a victim and i had a\nvictim mindset and said oh i'm just this\nway because i grew up with an alcoholic\nfather and\nit's the world's fault it's the\ngovernment's fault and i had excuse\nafter excuse after excuse after excuse\nwhen i look back to who i was let's say\n17 years ago\ni have\nactually destroyed who that person was i\ndestroyed my habits i destroyed my way\nof thinking i destroyed my way of\ntalking to myself i destroyed my way of\ntalking to other people i have mentally\nphysically emotionally energetically\ndestroyed\nwho rob dial was 17 years ago compared\nto in order to build up into who i am\ntoday\nand i want you to think about that\nbecause it's exactly the same for you\nyou have to destroy the person that you\nare in order to become the person you\nwant to be i had an identity\nof myself of who i thought i was that\nneeded to be destroyed in order to build\nmyself into who i wanted to be i built a\nnew version of myself\nand brick by brick by brick by brick\njust like building a wall i built myself\ninto who i am and you can build yourself\ninto who you want to be at any point in\ntime so\nyou're listening to this podcast you're\nin self-development you're dipping your\ntoes into the self-development thing\nbecause there's a part of you that\nthinks\nif i work on myself i might be able to\nbuild myself into who i want to be if i\nwork on myself i might be able to create\nthe future in the and the life that i\nwant to but the life that you want is\nabsolutely impossible and will never\nhappen unless you change first your life\nwill not change unless you change your\nlife will always be the same\nif you are always the same\nbecause your life and everything in your\nlife everything around you is based off\nof who you were in the past and so if i\ncan look at myself today i can see\neverything that's in my life\neverything that i have everything that i\nam all of the people in my life\nare based off of who i was in the past\nthat can be a good thing for some of you\nthat could be a bad thing for some of\nyou that could be you know looking at\nand going well damn yeah i do want to\nchange some aspects of who i am because\ni do want to change aspects of my life\nand it's\ni don't know how many times i've said\nthis in the podcast i've done over a\nthousand episodes but so many times i've\nsaid this\nthe einstein quote\nis\nto\nexpect different results but stay\nexactly the same as insanity two think\nthat your life can be different but you\ncontinue to do the same thing over and\nover again and expected results is\nabsolutely insanity\nsometimes\nand this is why it might be a little bit\ntough sometimes you have to have a\nbreakdown in order to have a\nbreakthrough\nsometimes you have to have a breakdown\nin order to have a breakthrough this is\nthe benefit of life this is the benefit\nof relationships great relationships\nfailed relationships but the problem\nwith that is that humans resist change\nthe human brain will always resist\nchange you will subconsciously resist\nchange\nalways\nyou can consciously\nwant change you can consciously want a\ndifferent life you can consciously want\nto build a business you could\nconsciously want to have a deeper\nrelationship with the person you're in\nrelationship with\nbut change is always a threat to the\nbrain and so the mind will resist change\nbecause\nchange means a destruction of who you\nare\nyou have to destroy who you are and that\nalone\nis scary\nto the parts of your brain that are not\nwith us in our old old old old parts\nfrom our ancestors a hundred thousand\nyears ago two hundred thousand years ago\nall of that stuff there's still parts of\nour brain the amygdala which is you know\nin the limbic system which basically is\nthe animal part of your brain\nthey're just like survival survivor\nsurvivor service survival\nis going to resist that so you can\nconsciously want to change\nbut subconsciously hold yourself back\nand this is why and i don't hear people\ntalk about this enough especially not in\nself-development you can feel like\nyou're at two ends of a spectrum with\nyourself like you can want to change so\nmuch and you're just like god i don't\nwant to be in this situation anymore\nbut continuously self-sabotage\nself-sabotage self-sabotage\nself-sabotage because there's a\nsubconscious programming running in the\nbackground that's going to try to\nsubconsciously self-sabotage you so\ntherefore you don't change because\nchange is automatically seen as a threat\nyou\nwill not die\nbut there is an old version of you\nthat must die to step into a new version\nof you in order for a butterfly to\nbecome a butterfly it has to go into the\ncocoon\nas a you know caterpillar\nugly little caterpillar goes into a\ncocoon and it's gotta literally\ncompletely transform itself to become a\nnew version of itself and so i want you\nto think about this as i'm talking are\nthere parts of yourself that you're\nresisting the change\nyou know you can want to you can go you\nknow what in order to change my life i\nneed to wake up and have a morning\nroutine\nbut then when you hear the alarm go off\nyou're like no screw that\nright that's the little part of you the\nlittle inner voice i like to call it the\nlittle inner [ __ ] it's the inner [ __ ]\nthat needs to be stomped on in order to\nchange your life in order to change your\nlife you have to completely destroy\nyourself\nlife is\na beautiful thing\nthere's beautiful things that happen\nthere's terrible things that happen\nthere's tragedies that happen there's\nsuccesses there's amazing moments\nthere's terrible moments\nbut we have to look at it and through\nthe lens of everything that comes to me\nis an opportunity for me to transform\neverything that comes to me is an\nopportunity for me to change myself if i\nhave a great relationship with somebody\nthat is calling me into a greater\nversion of myself to show up better for\nthis person\nso that i can\nhave this relationship to stay in this\nrelationship to change myself but also\nto change them i've also been through\nsome breakups i'm sure you've been\nthrough some breakups before that are\nearth-shattering\nand sometimes those relationships need\nto happen in order for us to wake up and\ngo you know what i need to change it can\nbe that person's fault in many ways as\nwell\nbut it can also be our fault in many\nways as well in our lens needs to be\nwhat happened to me happened\nand this is what one of my favorite\nquotes from peter crone he says what\nhappened happened and could not have\nhappened any other way because it didn't\nsay that again\nfor everybody what happened happened and\ncould not have happened any other way\nbecause it didn't\ni believe that everything happens for a\nreason i've gone through the ups and\ndowns of being like there's no such\nthing as fate\neverything happens for a reason and then\nnot everything happens for a reason\nand i've gone through every up and down\nand nooks and cranny of my mind to try\nto figure it out\nand the older that i get the more i\nstart to realize damn\nthat thing did happen to me so that i\ncould make a change that thing happened\nto me as another version of growth that\ni need to step into\ni was in a uh i'll be honest with you i\nwas in a psychedelic journey one time uh\ni was uh\nyeah i won't tell you what i was doing\nbut i was in a psychedelic journey one\ntime i'll leave it at that and i saw\nthis like visual of a flower a rose a\nred rose is what it was a visual of and\ni saw that\nyou know a rose will bloom from the\ncenter and in order to make room for a\nnew leaf to come through the leaves on\nthe outside must die they must crinkle\nthey must fall off in order to make room\nfor the other one\nin life as a human is that life as a\nhuman is in order for that new version\nof me to bloom from the center the new\nfresh great smelling version of the\nflower that is me\ni must have other parts of me die off i\nmust have other parts of me that need to\nchange that need to go there is only so\nmuch room on a flower and a rose\nso\nin order for me to make room for the new\nversion of that flower for the new petal\nto come out old petals that do not serve\nthat flower anymore anymore must fall\noff and that is exactly how life is\nbut it's really really hard so much of\nwhat we do is rooted in our identity of\nourselves so much of what we do is\nrooted in our identity and if we don't\nhave our identity\nwhat do we have\nand at that point in time it becomes\nvery hard for a human to figure out like\ni've gone through very tough times\nbefore that you know people in the\nspiritual world would call it dark night\nof the soul where it's like in order for\nme to figure out who i truly am i've got\nto go through some really hard stuff and\nthat is the world or the universe or god\nor whatever is it you believe in\npresenting you with things that make you\nchange in order to have a breakthrough\nsometimes you have to have a break down\nand i remember there was one time\nit's about four years ago at this point\ni uh i started really thinking about\nwhat i do\nand at this point in time i was already\nin self-development i was already a\ncoach and there was about three weeks\nwhere i remember i was like it's just\nsomething doesn't feel right i feel like\ni'm like i'm leading from who i am but\nthere's a part of myself that isn't my\ntruest version of myself that's still\nsticking around and i had to go through\nthis\njournaling and meditating every single\nday every single day and be like what is\nit that is sticking around that is not\na part of my highest potential and i\nneed to get rid of it i need to identify\nit i need to get rid of it i need to\nwork through it consciously\nevery single day and be very intentional\nabout working through those things it's\nlike in order to build a new building\nsometimes you got to destroy the\nbuilding that's there\nyou've got to destroy a building and\nbuild a new building that's the backbone\nof personal growth the backbone of\npersonal growth is you have to lose\nyourself in order to find yourself you\nhave to completely lose yourself\nand your identity and who you are and\nwho you think that you are so that you\ncan build yourself into who you want to\nbe you have to lose yourself to find\nyourself you have to let go of who you\nthink that you are\nso that you can build yourself into who\nyou truly want to become\nand you can see it as a blank canvas you\nknow sometimes you're you're painting if\nyou've ever painted before i've done\npainting before and i'm not a good\npainter in any sort of way but i've\npainted and been like what the hell is\nthis this thing looks like trash\nand it gets the point where it's like\nyeah this\ni'm too far down the line of this canvas\nthis canvas looks like crap i've got to\nthrow this canvas away and i've got to\ngo for a new canvas i've got to\nliterally put a brand new canvas on and\nstart painting again that's exactly how\nlife is sometimes so if you're looking\nat your life and you're like you know\nyour life might be good it might be\ngreat and you just know that there's\nmore potential or you might be looking\nat your life and it might not be that\ngood and it might not be that great and\nyou know that you have to look at that\ncanvas\nand go uh\nthis canvas has to go like i can't just\nmake changes on this canvas anymore i've\ngot to throw this canvas away and i've\ngot to come get a brand new canvas i got\nto go to the art store i've got to buy a\nnew canvas and i've got to buy new\npaints and i've got to start painting\nagain\nsometimes that's what is required of you\nfrom personal development is to be that\nway and one thing that is very important\nthat i don't hear talked about uh enough\nin personal development another thing is\nthat sometimes you might have to mourn\nthe old version of you\nthe old version of you got you where you\nare and that's a good thing it's never a\nbad thing it got you to where you are\nand it did its job\nbut\nit's got to go at some point in time i\nremember i had this really deep\nmeditation one time\nand i realized all of these fears that\nwere in my way of my highest potential\nand i had to mourn these fears\nnot mourn them in some crazy way but\nalmost like a mini death of these fears\nof going you know what these fears that\ni have that are holding me back\nthey are a good thing they i have these\nfears for a reason they protected me for\na really long time like these fears\nprotected me emotionally when i was a\nyounger kid and i was going through a\nlot of stuff with my father these\nprotected me they're like my friends\nthat have been with me for a really long\ntime and you know what they're a part of\nmy identity they're part of who i am but\nin order for me to step into who i want\nto be i've literally got to get rid of\nthese things so what am i going to do\ni'm going to mourn these i'm going to\nlet go of them i'm going to say you know\nwhat thank you so much fear of\nof emotionally getting invested into\nsomebody\nthank you for that fear because it\nprotected me but in order for me to step\ninto new relationships that i want to\nhave with myself with people around me\nwith everyone that i want to impact i've\ngot to get rid of these fears of\nallowing myself to open up and be\nemotionally vulnerable to other people\nbecause i won't be able to step into\nthat new version unless i get rid of it\nand so i had this this whole deep\nmeditation of like this is a fear i need\nto get rid of hey fear thank you so much\nfor everything that you've done for me\nthank you for being here thank you for\nprotecting me as a child thank you for\nhelping me get to where i am because\nwithout that fear\ni would not be who i am and i love who i\nam but i know there's another side that\ni want to grow to so in order for me to\nget to my next level i gotta let go of\nyou thank you so much for everything\nthat you've done\nbut we can't be friends anymore you\ncan't be a part of my life change is not\neasy\nsometimes it needs to be mourned but\nchange\nis necessary\nin the one thing that i know about\nhumans is that progress equals happiness\ni have uh never seen somebody\nthat is\nin true alignment with who they feel\nlike they need to be in this world and\nwhat they need to do in this world i've\nnever seen somebody that's in alignment\nwith who they need to be and they're\nmaking progress day after day after day\neven if it's just a tiny bit of progress\nand they're having real progression i've\nnever seen somebody who is making\nprogress towards the life that they want\nthat is unhappy progress equals\nhappiness and so i want you to realize\nthat deep down inside of you there is a\nversion of you that is you are like a\nflower there is a version of you that\nwants to bloom that wants to come\nthrough but there's just not enough room\non the rose anymore and so in order for\nthat side to bloom you've got to let\nsome of the pieces some of the petals\ndie might be fears it might be thoughts\nit might be identity shifts that you\nneed to have and you need to look at\nthem and say thank you for being here\nthank you for what you've done for me\nthank you for this relationship that we\nhave thank you for all of the\nperspective that you give me but it is\ntime for us to break up we can no longer\nbe friends\ni gotta let you go\nand you've got to let go of those things\nto step into a new version yourself\nto loop this all back around i'm going\nto leave you the exact same way that i\nstarted you with this quote a seed has\nto completely destroy itself in order to\nbecome a flower so if you want to become\na flower and you want to grow into that\nversion of you you have to ask yourself\nwhat pieces of me need to be destroyed\nso that i can step into my true\npotential\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout
