    "transcript": "if you start to see success you deserve\nall of the success that comes your way\nthe universe god whatever it is that you\nbelieve in\nis not going to bless you with success\nunless it feels like you deserve it\ntoday we're going to talk about what i\nlearned from 1 000 episodes of this\npodcast the mindset mentor and uh before\nwe dive into that i want to tell you a\nlittle bit of the story of it because i\nthink it's interesting to to see where\nit started because a lot of people can\nlook at the podcast and see the success\nand think that it was this way all the\ntime\nbut this podcast wasn't a successful\npodcast from the very beginning\nand so i'm going to go over the five\nthings that i learned\nfrom going through but real quick let me\ntell you how this came to be hopefully\nthis can be a inspirational story for\nanyone out there that wants to start a\nbusiness it's the exact same thing or\nwants to start a podcast or wants to be\nable to help people in some sort of way\nso a little background on me before i\nstarted the podcast i was uh in sales i\nhad trained a few thousand sales people\nat a company that i was at and the thing\nthat i missed the most\nafter i left and went into doing\ncorporate sales and corporate training\nthe thing that i missed the most around\nthat was i just miss helping people and\nthen one day i was in a place called\njason's deli with my girlfriend and i\ngot this like feeling this overwhelming\nfeeling this is back in 2015 this\noverwhelming feeling of like i need to\nteach the stuff that i've learned that's\nhelped me along the way the personal\ndevelopment the books that i've read the\nmindset tips and tricks and all of that\nstuff i need to teach it so i told my\ngirlfriend\nand literally\nhad this microphone that you guys that\nare watching on video can see this exact\nsame microphone is the same one that\ni've been using since the very first\npodcast episode i just happen to have it\ninside of my house because i'm a\nmusician so i had recording equipment\nand i just decided to do it but for six\nmonths i didn't put the podcast out\nbecause i was afraid\nwhy would somebody listen to me you know\ni had the imposter syndrome why would\nsomebody listen to me i was at that time\nlike 28 29 years old this is six years\nago and i'm like why would somebody\nlisten to me when they can listen to\ntony robbins or some of the greats that\nare out there they can listen to john c\nmaxwell they can listen to brian tracy\nthey can listen to zig ziglar they can\nlisten to jim rohn why would somebody\nlisten to some 29 year old guy that's\nstill just trying to figure it out\nand that's what i thought and for six\nmonths i didn't start the podcast and\nthen i just decided you know what screw\nit i'm gonna do it i'm just gonna put\nout the podcast and we'll just see how\nit goes i created seven episodes i'm\nsorry i created 14 episodes because i\nheard that the average podcaster gives\nup after seven so i created 14 and on\nday one i released and this was in\naugust of 2015. on day one\ni released three episodes\nthey were terrible i don't recommend\ngoing back and listening to them you can\nif you'd like you can scroll all the way\nback and listen to them but they were\nnowhere near as good as i feel like they\nare now i had 44 downloads 44 plays 44\nlistens on the very first day 44 for\nthree episodes which means approximately\n15 people were listening at that point\nin time i think a lot of people can get\ndiscouraged and say you know i don't\nwant to do this you know only 15 people\nare listening to me it's never going to\nbe anything big i might as well just\ngive up i'm right i was a fraud i am an\nimposter somebody can go listen to tony\nrobbins they can listen to john c\nmaxwell zig zigler jim rohn all of the\ngreats\nand they can give up but my thing that i\nhave is that if i start something i\nusually don't give up on it if i start\nit i'm gonna see it all the way through\nit grew and grew and slowly grew and\nthen it got to about 80 000 downloads a\nmonth\nand it stayed at 80 000 loads a month\nfor about three years and it just stayed\nit plateaued it was a hardcore plateau\nat that point a lot of people would\nthink it's not growing it's not worth it\ni can give it up but for me i was like\ni'm gonna figure out a way to get this\nto get to continue to grow but if you\nfast forward six years we're at around a\nthousand just over a thousand episodes\nand approaching 100 million downloads\nand we consistently are in the top 100\npodcasts in the entire world it's just\nbeen an amazing ride and so there's a\nlot that i've learned in this process\nbut i wanted to tell you before i tell\nyou what i've learned i wanted to tell\nyou the story so that you can see that\nit wasn't all you know unicorns\nsunshines and rainbows there's a whole\nbunch of struggles and having to stay\nwith it for a really long time no matter\nwhere you are whether it's a business\nyou want to start whether it's a podcast\nyou want to start you want to start\nhelping people whatever it is\nthis what i'm gonna teach you these five\nsteps the five things that i've learned\nwill help you immensely so number one\nis to trust your gut feeling this is\nsomething i feel like people especially\npeople that i've worked with thousands\nof people i've worked with over the\nyears a lot of people have really hard\ntime distinguishing their brain versus\ntheir gut feeling like that what is it\nwhat do i feel like my intuition is\ntelling me because we're so trained\nespecially in the west to think to think\nto be logical with stuff and so to go\nwhat does my intuition say is very\nforeign i got the feeling inside of\njason's deli\nthat i needed to start a podcast\nlogically it didn't make any sense\nbecause i was\n29 years old working for a sales company\nnot working very much i was working\nprobably a few hours a day and i was\nmaking a couple hundred thousand dollars\na year it didn't make sense logically to\ngo hey i'm gonna go start a podcast\nbecause six years ago people didn't\nreally listen to podcasts and to think\nthat i'm gonna build a business on the\nback end of it\nlet alone a business that's doing\nmultiple millions of dollars every\nsingle year now it's like it that didn't\nmake any sense i didn't think that was\neven gonna be something to be possible\nbut there was this feeling inside of me\nlike this is what i'm going to do this\nis what i feel called to do as if it is\nmy obligation to do this and to teach\nthis stuff and it was just a gut feeling\nand the people on the outside all of my\nfriends were like you're gonna do what\nthat doesn't make any sense what is a\npodcast i don't even know how to listen\nto podcasts there wasn't a podcasting\napp on your phone at that point in time\nspotify didn't have it it was just\nreally hard to listen to them and so\nmany people when i had when i first had\nthe podcast were like oh that's cool\ni've heard of podcasts before i've never\nlistened to one i don't really know how\nto and so it didn't make logical sense\nbut i got this gut feeling of like i'm\nsupposed to do this\nand i just followed the gut feeling and\nthen i just never gave up on it and\nthat's the beautiful thing about us just\nto continue keep going and that's going\nto be one of the steps as well so the\nfirst thing i'll tell you is if you get\na gut feeling if you get a pull if you\nhave this feeling of like i'm supposed\nto do this even if it doesn't logically\nmake sense\nif it feels right not if you think that\nit's right if it feels right even if it\njust feels right to you it usually is\nright your gut feeling is your emotional\ncompass it is telling you where you're\nsupposed to go in your life your job is\nto try to tune in to what that is to\nactually figure out what it is that\nyou're supposed to do so the first thing\nthat i will say is go with your gut\nfeeling and don't pay attention to what\nanybody has to say i don't care who they\nare i don't give a damn if it's your\nparents if you're teachers if it's your\nmentors if it's your best friends if you\nget a gut feeling and it's a strong pull\nand it feels like a full yes to you\nyou've got to go for it doesn't matter\nif it doesn't make any sense to anybody\nelse doesn't matter if it doesn't make\nsense to you if it feels right it's\nusually right so the first thing is to\nfollow your gut feeling that's what i've\nlearned from this podcast the second\nthing that i've learned\nis to follow your dreams for me all i\never wanted to do is be able to build a\nbusiness where i've been able to help\npeople that's all i wanted to do how can\ni help people how can i help people the\nthing that i miss the most about when i\nleft cutco when i was you know 23 24\nyears old\nfor six years being in the corporate\nworld i just missed\nthe the feeling of being a teacher the\nfeeling of being a mentor the feeling of\nhelping people and so my dream was in\nsome sort of way how can i help people i\ndon't know what it is it doesn't make\nany sense but i had this this\nfirst off this emotional gut feeling\nthat i needed to do something and then i\nalso had this feeling of like i'm\nsupposed to help people i don't know\nwhat that means i don't know if that\nmeans supposed to be a coach i don't\nknow if that means i'm supposed to go\nand be a high school teacher but i just\nhad this pull of i'm supposed to help\npeople and that was the dream that i\nwanted to follow and the cool thing\nabout it is\nnow looking back six years later\nall of the dots connect a thousand\nepisodes later all of the dots connect\nit all makes sense but back then it\ndidn't make a whole lot of sense i just\nhad a couple feelings of i'm not\nsupposed to be doing this sales job\nanymore this isn't fulfilling me i don't\nwant to die working jobs that i hate\nsimply in exchange you know exchange my\ntime that i have in this life for just\nmoney i don't want to to be stuck in the\nrat race and i went through and looked\nthrough my journals six years ago before\nrecording this podcast and it was just\njournal entry after journal entry after\njournal entry that just said i don't\nwant to work for anyone anymore i want\nto build my own business i want to help\npeople i don't want to have a salary i\ndon't want to be stuck to somebody\nelse's schedule i want to be able to\ntravel the world i want to be able to\nhelp millions of people across the world\nand it was just like i kept journaling\nand putting it down and putting it down\nand putting it down and eventually the\nuniverse revealed itself to me in a way\nthat just made sense and that gut\nfeeling was the pull and so i'll say\nmake sure that you follow your dreams\nstart to figure out what your dreams are\nif you're not clear\nas i always say if you've been never\nheard me say it before it's okay not to\nknow what your passion is and what your\npurpose is right now but if you don't\nknow what it is it's not okay to not be\nin constant search for what that thing\nis you've got to figure out what it is\nso that's number two is to follow your\ndreams number three is to just don't\nstop\nthat's it it's simple the only reason\nwhy i feel like i've won in the\npodcasting world is because everyone who\nstarted when i started they just stopped\ndoing it it was just countless person\nperson after person after person after\nperson after person\ni follow up with them years down the\nroad and they're like oh yeah i gave\nthat up you know about a year in i just\ndidn't stop and i eventually just\nfigured out my flow i figured out what\npeople liked i found a community of\npeople who liked my message and it just\nworked and so whatever it is that you\nwant to do just don't stop you're not\ngoing to see success right away no\nmatter what it is that you do it's just\nnot not going to happen\nit's going to take time you know it's\nlike the chinese bamboo it takes five\nyears for the bamboo once you put it\ninside of the ground it takes five years\nfor the seed to even break through the\nground but after five years it goes from\nno feet zero feet you know literally\njust a tiny little\nseed\nto up to 80 feet\nhigh in six months\nbut it needed five years to get to that\npoint sometimes people give up\nright before they're about to see\nsuccess and so what i'll tell you is if\nyou get the gut feeling and you feel\nlike it's right and you have this dream\nthat you're following\ntime doesn't matter you need time on\nyour side it needs time to mature it\nneeds time to grow it needs time for you\nto mess up and figure things out and\nmess things and figure mess up things\nand figure them out just don't stop just\nstop stopping if you want to be\nsuccessful just stop stopping that's it\njust keep going one of the things that i\nlove is i was with a friend one time and\nhe was like you know the thing i love\nabout you is you're basically just like\na cockroach like you just don't die you\njust keep going and keep going you keep\ngoing and that's that's how you have to\nbe in pursuit of what you want so just\ndon't stop number four be consistent\nwith whatever it is that's one thing\nthat i've learned over a thousand\nepisodes and\nfrom the very first time i started the\npodcast monday wednesday and friday i\nhave not missed a monday wednesday or\nfriday in six years not one time in a\nthousand episodes have i missed a monday\nwednesday or friday simply because\nthere was one time\nyears and years and years ago that i\nuploaded an episode and it didn't go out\nin time because i scheduled it instead\nof four o'clock in the morning i\nscheduled for four o'clock p.m and i was\nbrushing my teeth and i saw a couple\nemails that had come through and as i\nwas brushing my teeth i looked at these\nemails and people were sending me emails\nsaying rob your podcast didn't come out\nare you okay i'm not even kidding you i\nwas like holy crap it's only been a few\nhours and i'm already getting emails\nfrom people who are concerned about my\nwell-being simply because they've gotten\nused to my podcast coming out a certain\ntime and so you know you have to stay\nconsistent with it i realize that my\nlisteners depend on me you guys depend\non me to sometimes fill your time when\nyou're driving to work or while you're\ngoing on your morning run or while\nyou're at the gym and it's my obligation\nto make sure that i show up for you if\nyou're gonna be listening to me and so\nwhen i say be consistent\nto be successful in anything you have to\nnumber one like i said a minute ago\ndon't stop number two be consistent just\ncontinue to keep showing up it doesn't\nmatter if you believe in yourself but if\nyou show up to the gym four times a week\nand just work out hard with a trainer\nyou're eventually going to get in much\nbetter shape that's exactly how it is\nwith life that's exactly i was a success\njust don't stop be consistent don't stop\nbe consistent keep going keep going keep\ngoing and then the fifth thing that i've\nlearned is you deserve all of the\nsuccess that comes your way this is one\nthing that holds a lot of people back\ni've coached many people i've coached\nmany people who have massive trouble\nwith success they have massive trouble\nwith failure and a lot of times the\nreason why is because they don't feel\nlike they deserve the success that comes\ntheir way and so they actually when they\nstart to see success they self-sabotage\nthat success they get in their own way\nthey literally\nthink to themselves i don't know if i\ndeserve this money i don't know if i've\ncome from a place where everyone is poor\ni don't know if i deserve to me and\nthey're not consciously thinking this\nmost times usually deep subconscious\nthat's just a pattern but it's like if i\nget rich will everyone that i've always\nbeen friends with not be friends with me\nanymore cause i don't fit in with them\nwill everyone want to use me for money\nwill everyone forget you know make fun\nof me and and you know get rid of me and\nnot be not let me be part of the family\nit's this weird thing where it's like\nit doesn't make any sense when you\nactually speak it out loud but so many\npeople have this deep psychological\nfeeling of of i don't deserve success i\nhad that feeling for a little while of\nlike why\nhow did i get so lucky\nto do something that i absolutely love\ndoing that makes me feel alive and also\nbe able to make a load of money doing it\nit was like this doesn't seem fair i\nremember seeing people and seeing parts\nseeing my mom and family struggle to\nmake money when i was younger and it\nseemed like it was so hard to do it's\nlike who the am i to be able to do\nsomething that i love to not feel like\ni'm struggling for it to feel effortless\nfor me to love doing this and for me to\nget paid tons of money doing it and for\nyears i want to see yours for a while i\nwas like i don't know if i deserve this\nand so there's a lot of people that deal\nwith this and i want to tell you that no\nmatter what it is that you do if you\nstart to see success you deserve all of\nthe success that comes your way the\nuniverse god\nwhatever it is that you believe in\nis not going to bless you with success\nunless it feels like you deserve it the\nsuccess the money whatever it is that\nyou get is just a byproduct of the value\nthat you're giving the world and so you\ndeserve all of the success that comes\nyour way whatever that success looks\nlike whatever it feels like whatever it\nmeans to you\nyou deserve it and so don't\nself-sabotage yourself on this path\nto success\nthinking that i don't know if i deserve\nit i don't i'm not going to fit in with\nmy friends anymore you know all of my\nfriends are broke will they try to use\nme for money will they make fun of me\nfor starting to make money it's just\nthis weird thing we feel like we're\ngoing to be kicked out of the tribe if\nwe simply become different\nif i start talking in front of people\nand putting my message out there am i\ngoing to be exiled from the group it's\nkind of like the old you know tribal\nfeeling of the brightest light gets the\nmost arrows maybe if i stand out and i\ndo something different then i have to\nfear that because there could be\nsomething that could come bad down the\nroad nothing bad is coming down the road\nfor you no matter what it's all coming\nthere's all good coming down the road\nfor you either believe that the world is\nworking everything that's happening in\nthe world is happening to you or it's\nhappening for you i'm here to tell you\nit's happening for you you deserve all\nthe success that you want that you will\nget\ndon't get in your own way when that\nsuccess is starting to come in because\nyou can dam it up and put a dam in in\nfront of you and all of your success\nbecause you don't feel that it's right\nand so with six years almost 100 million\ndownloads over a thousand podcast\nepisodes those are the five biggest\nthings that i've learned\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if you\nwere already the person that could\ncreate the success that you want you\nwould have already had that success so\nwhat we're getting down to\nis that it's you that needs to change"
