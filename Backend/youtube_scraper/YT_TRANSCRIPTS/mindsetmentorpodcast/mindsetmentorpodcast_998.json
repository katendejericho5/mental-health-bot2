    "transcript": "and i'm not saying when i'm when i'm\nwhen i'm talking with this i'm not\nsaying that you have to change the world\ni'm just saying that you have to change\nyour life\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to step into your own personal power\nand i'm going to talk about the small\ndecisions that you make the big\ndecisions that you make but i'm going to\ntalk about how every single decision\nthat you make in your life is based in\neither one of two places every decision\nthat you make is either based out of\nfear or it's based out of personal power\nso it's either fear or it's power those\nare the two places that you can make\ndecisions from there are no other place\nyou can make decisions the problem\nthough is that at least for me most of\nmy life until i realized this is that\nmost of my decisions were made out of\nfear which is also called scarcity i was\nin a scarcity mode i wasn't raised with\na whole lot i didn't know anything about\nbusiness i didn't know anything about\ngrowing a business or growing a podcast\nor growing stuff and so a lot of my\ndecisions that i've made in my life were\nbased out of fear\neven though i felt like i should\nprobably make a different decision you\nknow when i look back on my entire life\nmost of them were made out of fear and\nso what i want you to think about for\nyourself if you look back on your entire\nlife\nin all of things you've done and all of\nthe decisions that you've made have they\nbeen based out of power of a place of\npersonal power and stepping into your\npersonal power or have they been made\nfrom a place of fear\nof scarcity have they been made from a\nplace of oh yeah i won't do this because\nit costs too much money i won't invest\ninto myself because it costs more money\ni won't start that business because i\nknow it's going to cost me money to do\nyou know those are based out of fear and\nwhen we talk about fear you have to\nrealize that fear is a good thing and\nfear is also a bad thing because fear\nwill show you the edge of your comfort\nzone and show you where you're on the\nedge of your comfort zone so if you want\nto push past it you continue to keep\ngoing or fear if you listen to it is a\nbad thing because it will keep you in\nthe exact same place that you're in and\nfear\nwas a great thing for our ancestors they\nkept them alive a hundred thousand years\nago when they had to be fearful of\npossibly walking by a bush and a lion\nbeing in there so that fear kept our\nspecies alive but now today fear is\nactually one of the things that holds\npeople back the most and you may have\nheard me talk about it i had a\npsychedelic journey a few years ago\nwhere i really realized that fear is the\nworst thing in the world because without\nfear if we had no fear there wouldn't be\nany wars there wouldn't be any killings\nthere wouldn't be people that were\nlooking at people that didn't look like\nthem or act like them and and hating\nthem fear\nholds people back from making a true\nconnection and really growing but also\nfear holds people back from starting the\nbusiness that could possibly change the\nworld or cure cancer or be able to\nchange global warming they're just too\nfearful of actually taking that step so\nif fear were not there this place could\nbe amazing this could be a utopia this\ncould be just an amazing place we can\nlive in but fear holds us back when i\nlook back on my life a lot of my\ndecisions were made in fear what i\nrealized is i got to a point in my life\nwhere i looked at my life and i didn't\nhave the life that i wanted i knew that\nthere was more and i knew that if i\nwanted to\ncreate the life that i wanted to create\ni would have to step out of fear i would\nfeel the fear but i would have to\ncontinue to do it and doing it anyways\nmy decisions were all made to keep me in\nmy comfort zone\nand its simplest form to keep me in the\nexact same position that i always was in\nwhy does it come from fear because like\ni said fear is the thing that kept us\nalive but the part that existed in our\nancestors a hundred thousand two hundred\nthousand years ago in their brains still\nexists in our brains today it's the\namygdala it's this little tiny thing and\nthat's where all of your fears come from\nit keeps you alive it is a great thing\nbut when there are no nothing to fear\nabout like lions attacking you or\nrunning out of food or running out of\nwater or you know a animal attacking\nyour child when you have all of those\ngone\nyour brain still has the amygdala and\nthat amygdala will then create fears\nthat don't even exist\nlet me ask you something have you ever\nhad you know a moment of silence you're\nsitting around and you're quiet and your\nbrain just immediately goes to fears it\ngoes to fear base it starts making\nthings up that don't even exist that's\nwhat happens is a brain that's that you\ndon't pay attention to will\nautomatically go to fear so how can you\nstop going to fear and everything that\nyou do and this is why it's very very\nimportant for you for me for all of us\nfor every single person to become very\nself-aware and i wanted you to think\nabout\nall of the great decisions that have\nhappened in this world all of the\namazing things that have changed the\ncourse of history\nthink about all these great decisions i\nwant to ask you a question how many of\nthose great decisions\ndo you think came from a place of fear\ndon't worry i'll give you a second how\nmany came from a place of fear\nprobably none of them\nright i don't mean fear of death\ni don't mean fear of like\nof being attacked i mean fear of\nof i don't know if i can do it maybe i\nshouldn't do it maybe i should do this\ninstead i don't think that any great\nbusiness any nobel prize winner any of\nthose things came from a place of fear\nall of those came from some place of\npersonal power\nand these decisions are the decisions\nthat we have that can completely change\nthe course of our lives and the people's\nlives around us and i'm not saying when\ni'm when i'm when i'm talking to this\ni'm not saying that you have to change\nthe world i'm just saying that you have\nto change your life these decisions of\nfear\nwill make us play small they will make\nus not live up to our potential they\nwill make us afraid of rejection they\nwill make us afraid of other people's\nopinions it'll make us afraid of what\nmight happen if we step into the unknown\nthose are all decisions that keep us\nplaying small and they keep us\ntaking the safe route and they keep us\nstaying inside of our comfort zone and\nyou might be out there and you might\nhave this amazing business idea that\ncould completely change your life and\nmaybe\nchange the course of history\nand it's out there and you have this\nidea and it's there and it's so close\nbut there's a feeling inside of your\nhead of like well what if i what if i\nmess up what if i what if i make an\nembarrassment of myself whatever make an\nembarrassment of my family and those\nthoughts will keep you from changing the\nworld now let's go on even even smaller\nscale maybe\nyou have this feeling if you want to go\nstart a business and you're not sure\nwhat the business is but you have this\nfeeling of i want to go start a business\nbut the fear is actually even keeping\nyou from going out and trying new things\nit's keeping you from going out and\ngoing to conferences that interest you\nto see what you can find out that fear\nif you didn't have it could\nget you to start your if you didn't have\nit and you started to a place of power\nyou could go out and you could learn\nsomething new you could start a business\nand maybe that business doesn't change\nthe course of history maybe it doesn't\nchange the world but maybe it changes\nyour life\nand if you have kids or even a spouse or\nyou plan on having kids and spouses\nlater on down the road\nthat will change their world and so it's\nnot about changing the entire world but\ncan you change your world which will\neventually change other people's world\nas well it's also another thing of like\nstepping into you know your own personal\ndevelopment and investing into that\ni always talk about it all the time one\nof the biggest moments of my life was\nwhen i invested into my first coach and\npaid 500 a month i could have not paid\nhim 500 a month because i didn't have it\nbecause i didn't i put onto a credit\ncard but there was something inside of\nme that said i should do it and that was\nme stepping into a place of personal\npower going you know what i don't like\nwhere i am i don't want to be here\nanymore and i'm not going to be here\nanymore and i'm going to do something\ndifferent\nthat thought\nthat feeling completely changed the\ncourse of my life and i wouldn't be\ndoing what i do right now i wouldn't be\nspeaking to you whether this is through\na podcast whether this is through\nyoutube or whether it's through facebook\nor instagram i would not be speaking to\nyou right now if i didn't hire that guy\nthat changed my life and hopefully it's\nchanging your life in some sort of way\nas well you know how many how many great\ndecisions came from a place of no risk\noh i'm not going to risk it here's the\nthing in life this is one of my favorite\nquotes if you don't risk anything you\nrisk everything if you don't risk\nanything in your life and you play your\nentire life safe and you play scared and\nyou play inside of your comfort zone you\nrisk everything you risk an amazing life\nyou risk all the happiness and joy and\nthe true potential and the wealth that\nyou could get in the way that you could\nchange your family's life by that wealth\nyou risk everything when you decide in\nyour life that you're not going to risk\nanything how many\npeople do you look up to in your life\namazing people\nthat change the world that do you think\njust didn't live in their personal power\nvery few right probably none how many\ngreat inventions and companies came from\nplace of fear none so what should we be\nfocused on we talked a lot about fear\nwhat should we be focused on is we\nshould be focused on our personal power\nstepping into a place where we know it's\ngoing to cause the greatest greatest\ngrowth for ourselves is it going to be\neasy no is it going to be uncomfortable\nyes but is it going to help us grow\nabsolutely so that is what we need to be\nfocused on stepping into who you could\nbe\nand ultimately who you should be more\nthan anything else will there be risk\nabsolutely there's going to be tons of\nrisks there's gonna be tons of failures\nyou're gonna up a lot of stuff but\nthat doesn't matter what matters is who\nyou come out on the other side and it's\nthe difference between your gut feeling\nand your brain feeling your gut feeling\nand your brain your brain is a and\nyou've heard me say this a million times\nyour brain is designed to do one thing\nand one thing only and that is to keep\nyou safe your brain is literally a\nfear-based mechanism it's what it does\nit creates fear so that therefore it\nkeeps you alive and keeps you inside of\nyour comfort zone but your gut feeling\nis that feeling deep down inside of your\nsoul of like i feel like i'm supposed to\ndo this and the tragedy of life is that\ntoo many people\ndon't listen to that gut feeling and\nthey don't step into their personal\npower they don't step into who they\ncould be they don't step into the true\npotential and then ultimately they get\nto end their life and they really regret\nthat they didn't do what they ultimately\nshould have done they listen to fear\nmore than they listen to their personal\npower everything\nthat you want to do is going to require\nyou to at some point step into a place\nof personal power and you need to become\nvery aware of when your gut feeling is\npulling you towards something when it's\ndriving you towards something\nor when you are coiling back and you're\ncoming from a place of fear and you're\nnot making that decision and once again\ni said this a minute ago it's going to\nrequire you to become\nvery very self-aware of what's going on\nand that's the first thing that you need\nto realize is that you need to become\nself-aware whenever you feel a certain\nway to take a step back get out of the\njar so you can read the label you know\nliterally look at yourself as if you're\na different person take out a pen and\npaper and say what am i feeling right\nnow\nyou know what i'm feeling pretty fearful\nokay why am i fearing feel fear why am i\nfeeling fearful right now i'm feeling\nfearful because i feel like i don't want\nto work at my job anymore and i want to\ngo start a business\nokay why does that scare me write down\nall the reasons why it scares you it's\nokay to write down all the reasons why\nit scares you and then you can also\nwrite down\nbut what if i succeed what will happen\noh i could have this i could have this i\ncould create this i could impact these\npeople's lives i could start a charity i\ncould have so much money to donate and\nyou start to realize when you take\neverything out of your head and put onto\na piece of paper\nthat you could coil away you could\nlisten to the fear but then you could\nfast forward 20 years from now and see\nwhat your life would look like if you\ndecided to follow that route so you ask\nyourself the question what would my life\nlook like if i decided to not do this 20\nyears from now if i fast forward what\nwill my my life look like if i don't do\nthis i'll probably be in the same\nposition making a little bit more money\ni'll probably not be as happy as i could\nbe in fact i'll probably be less happy\nbecause i know that i'm not living up to\nmy full potential okay if i were to step\ninto my personal power and decide to\nstart this business knowing it's going\nto be hard knowing there's going to be\nunknowns knowing i'm going to screw\nthings up and i'm going to mess it up\nand i'm going to fail over and over\nagain but if i do fast forward of what\nmy life could be like in 20 years what\ncould my life look like oh my gosh i\ncould impact these people i could change\nmy life i could feel better of myself i\ncould finally feel confident of what it\nis that i do\nand when you break it down and you start\nto look at your life as if you're\nplanning a business like if you're going\nto start a business you're going to have\na business plan right and what are you\ngoing to do you're going to have your\nbusiness plan in your head no you're\ngoing to write down the things that\nyou're needing to do or that you need to\ndo to grow your marketing and grow your\nsales and grow your revenue and create\nthe products you're going to write all\ndown on a piece of paper\nwhy is it any different with planning\nout where your life is going if you're\nthinking about your life too much\nyou're going down the wrong route you\nneed to start planning out your life act\nlike it's a business okay what if i do\ndecide to go out and take this path in\nmy life what can my life look like what\nwhat challenges could come up if i go\nthis route what could i do to make sure\nthat i i mitigate the risk with all of\nthese challenges so therefore i can work\nthrough them what if my mom does say\nthis about me well she does say it about\nme that's her own opinion but i'm going\nto go through this route because it\nfeels like it's what i'm supposed to be\nso that's the first thing is become very\nself-aware take yourself out of the jar\nand read the label to put everything\nthat's happening in your head on a piece\nof paper and work through them as if it\nwas a business plan and the second thing\nis to start becoming comfortable living\non the edge of your comfort zone if\nyou've never lived on the edge of your\ncomfort zone before\nthen it's going to be hard for you in\nthe beginning but once you've done this\nenough it feels uncomfortable\ninstead of it's instead of it feeling\nuncomfortable to live on your comfort\nzone it feels uncomfortable to not be\nuncomfortable\nif that makes sense where comfort\nactually is uncomfortable because you\nknow that it's not what you should be\ndoing you know that it's holding you\nback you know that it's not giving you\nthe life that you want and so what you\ndo is you actually start to find the\nedge of your comfort zone and you start\nto know what that feels like you know\nwhat the fear popping up feels like but\nyou decide not to listen to it and what\nyou do when you get to the edge of your\ncomfort zone instead of backing away\nas you start to lean in and go this is\nshowing me where i am not free i am\nstuck in this comfort zone and if i want\nto create something amazing in my life\ni'm gonna have to lean into this just a\nlittle bit and then what i want you to\ndo is i want you to fast forward your\nlife\nand think it to the future\nif you continue to make decisions out of\nfear\nfor the next five years what is your\nlife going to look like in five years if\nyou continue to make decisions out of\nfear over the next 20 years\nwhat is your life going to look like in\n20 years are you going to look at it and\ngo man i'm so excited about this life\ni'm so proud of it my children are going\nto be so proud of me that the life that\ni lived in fear for the past 20 years\nwhat would your life look like if you\nlived in fear for the next five years\nfor the next 20 years fast forward\nyourself and see it and if it's painful\nlet it be painful because sometimes that\npain is needed for you to make a change\nand then what i want you to do is i want\nyou to start to write down what could my\nlife look like if i stepped into my\npersonal power for the next five years\nwhat could my life look like if i\nstepped into my personal power for the\nnext 20 years if i leaned on the edge of\nmy comfort zone and i pushed past it\nconstantly and pushed past it constantly\nand i felt the fear but i did it anyways\nwhat could my life look like and you\nstart to plan ahead and you start to\nrealize that if you're going to step\ninto your own personal power you've got\nto learn to work with fear fear is\nalways going to be present it's always\ngoing to be there it's never going to go\naway you just become more comfortable\nwith it being there it's just like that\nawkward person sitting in the corner of\nthe room it's always going to be there\nbut just because he's talking to you\ndoesn't mean that you have to listen to\nhim you can put on your headphones and\nstart going to the path that you want to\nso if you want to create a life that\nsteps into your personal power you've\ngot to start following it you've got to\nstart planning it out you've got to\nbecome very aware when you're starting\nto be pulled back into fear\nand then just like a business plan write\nout what's going on and how you can get\npast it and if you do that\nthat is how you create the life that you\nwant to over the next five years the\nnext 10 years next 20 years and until\nthe day you die when you get to that\ndeath bed you'll be proud of what you\ncreated versus not happy about what it\nended up looking like hey thanks so much\nfor watching this video if you want to\nlearn even more about mastering your\nmind click right here and watch this\nvideo as well\nlike what is actually scary about that"
