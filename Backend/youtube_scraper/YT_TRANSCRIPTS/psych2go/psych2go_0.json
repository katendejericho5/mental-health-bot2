Or\nCinderella being bullied\nby her obnoxious stepsisters\nJealousy if not a crime And\nfeeling this way from time\nto time is completely normal\nHowever It can definitely cross\nthe line From healthy\nto dangerous If it's not\naddressed properly And it can make\npeople do some messed up\nthings Here are some signs\nto figure out Whether you\nhave a jealous friend in your\ncorner And what to look out\nfor Competition What's wrong\nwith some healthy competition?\nWell, jealousy is like a disease\nand there's nothing healthy\nabout that friends are supposed\nto be supportive and encouraging\nbut if you feel\nthat your friend is always\ncompeting against you then it's a\nclear sign that they're jealous\nof you it could be the\nsmallest things too such as\nwho gets more views on their tiktok reels\nor who gets the most compliments\non their outfit over time\nit can be exhausting dealing\nwith a friend who's\nalways competing with you\nand can cause bitterness\nand resentment to build up\ncompetition doesn't always signal\njealousy but if you notice\nyour friend makes everything an\nintense competition and\nconstantly compares herself\nto you then it might be time\nto reconsider the\nfriendship critical much out\nof all the signs this one\nmight be the most heartbreaking\nthere's nothing worse than being\nharshly put down by someone\nwho you thought was your friend\nand that you could trust\ncriticism could also come in the\nform of harmless teasing\nbut usually this is just\npersistent criticism masked\nas a joke for example let's say you\nand your friend go to\nthe same school together\nand you get a good grade\non an assignment a jealous\nand critical friend might\nminimize your accomplishment\nand make a rude remark such\nas you probably only earned\nthat grade because you kissed up\nto the teacher ouch if this\nsounds familiar it's important\nthat you communicate\nboundaries with your friend\nand let them know that their\ncomments are more hurtful than\nthey think smear campaign you\nknow all hull has broken loose\nwhen your friend creates a\nsmear or gossip about you\nand we're not just talking\nabout burn books this is usually\na very premeditated\nand calculated attempt to\nbring you down in the eyes\nof your peers with the intention\nof elevating themselves you\ncould call it backstabbing in\nthe first degree all jokes\naside when a friend is going out\nof their way to gossip and\nspread lies about you then their\njealousy has been brewing for a long time\nand they've gradually built up\nresentment towards you which\nmakes it even more toxic it's\nnot just harmless jealousy\nanymore because now they're\nputting their negative feelings\ntowards you in action\nand they have an end game in\nmind it's also easier for them\nto hurt you if you still\nthink that they're your friend\nbecause you might not suspect\nthem of being the source\nof the gossip and lies\nthat are being spread about\nyou nothing good can come out\nof a situation like this\nso if you find out your\nfriend has been gossiping\nand spreading rumors\nabout you then it's time\nto cut ties entirely\nbackhanded compliments also\nreferred to as negging which\nis when a person makes a remark\nto you or about you\nwhich can be interpreted\nas both an insult\nand a compliment you could also say\nthat backhanded compliments\nare poorly disguised insults if\nyour friend is constantly\ndishing out these types\nof compliments it's usually a sign\nthat they're projecting their insecurities\nand frustrations onto you which\nincludes jealousy here are\nsome examples wow I can't believe you wore\nthat I wish I had your confidence I'm\nso surprised you passed your\nfinal exams congratulations\nbackhanded compliments are\nmeant to dim your shine\nand rain on your parade\nso don't let me bring you down\nif your friend is doing this\ntry confronting the issue head on ask them\nfor a clarification on their remark\nand let them know\nthat it feels more like an\ninsult than a compliment this\ntype of direct communication\ncan salvage the friendship\nor it can at the very least\nhold your friend accountable\nfor their inappropriate\nbehavior a form of flattery\nso they say imitation is\nthe highest have a friend\nwho just loves your taste\nin music art clothes Etc\nand that might feel great at first\nbut then you notice\nthat they start copying\neverything you do shamelessly it's\none thing to draw\ninspiration from other people\nand it's another thing to just\nhijack their entire persona\nand make it your own\nthis is actually a sign\nof a deeper issue if your friend seems\nto lack a solid identity of\ntheir own then they may look up\nto you but this also means\nthat they want what you have\nand that can be frustrating\nit starts innocently\nbut could manifest into\nsomething worse such as going\nafter your friends loved ones\nand even career aspirations\nin this case it's important\nto draw some boundaries\nand even politely confront\nyour friend if they seem\nto copy you constantly hot\nand cold do you have a friend\nwho seems to be really excited\nto see you one minute and\nthen acts completely cold\nand closed off the next day\nwell this could mean they really\ndon't value the friendship\nbut it also means that they\nhave built resentment due\nto jealousy and you might not\neven realize it pay attention\nto your friend's behavior\nwhenever you tell them about\nsomething positive in your life\nor about something you've\naccomplished usually you can see\nalmost an immediate change\nin their body language\nand demeanor and you can gauge\nhow they're feeling something\nwill always feel off your\nfriend might act like this\nbecause of a deep insecurity\nand self-doubt which causes\nthem to not only feel jealous\nof you but they may even react\nwith sudden anger your friend might\nthat you are rubbing your\naccomplishments in their face even\nthough that's not your intention\nclingy jealous Behavior\ndoesn't just mean a person is jealous\nof you it can also mean\nthey're jealous of those\naround you which can take\nthe form of possessive\nand clingy behavior this is something\nthat isn't discussed enough\nbut if you're dealing\nwith a jealous friend\nsometimes they'll do things\nto isolate you from your social Circle\nand
