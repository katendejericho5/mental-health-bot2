    "transcript": "renowned psychologist Carl Young once\nuntil we are able to make the\nunconscious conscious it will direct\nyour life and you will call it fate\nthat's the value of self-awareness the\nmore aware we become of our own flaws\nstruggles and shortcomings the better we\nare at adapting evolving and flourishing\nin life but introspection can be scary\nbecause it forces us to confront things\nabout ourselves in our past we may not\nknow how to deal with but as they always\nsay the first step to overcoming any\nproblem is to acknowledge it and the\nsame is true for a lot of emotional\nbaggage we still carry with us today so\nif you'd like to take that first step\nhere are some of the most common types\nof coping mechanisms and how they relate\nto certain types of traumatic\nexperiences\nthere's been a huge decline in mental\nhealth around the world which is why\nwe're so committed to creating more\ncontent than we ever have thanks for\nbeing a part of our journey number one\nabuse exploitation have you ever had\nsomeone you trusted purposefully hurt\nabused or took advantage of you have you\never been humiliated cheated on lied to\nor manipulated by someone you once\nconsidered a friend or a loved one for\nmost people who have had and still have\nunhealed trauma because of this their\ncoping mechanism is likely to mistrust\nor always be suspicious of other people\nand their intentions does this sound\nlike you number two abandonment whether\nit was a parent who walked out on you a\nromantic partner who ghosted you out of\nthe blue or growing up in the system and\nmoving around from one family to another\nexperiences of being abandoned\nespecially at a young age can easily\nleave us with lasting emotional damage\nthey often erode our sense of self-worth\nand negatively impact our view of others\nas well so if you have a deep-seated\nfear of abandonment it's most likely\nthat your Kobe mechanism is to keep\npeople at an emotional distance and\nleave before you get left\nnumber three emotional deprivation\nsimilar to the last Point even if the\nsignificant people in your life are\nphysically and actually there for you\ntheir emotional neglect and deprivation\ncan be just as traumatizing too\nwhere they never attentive or\naffectionate towards you did they\ndeprive you of empathy understanding and\nemotional connection did you often feel\nalone and unsupported\nexperiences of emotional deprivation\noften lead to an over-reliance on\noneself and inability to ask for help or\nshow weakness to others\nnumber four\nshame unworthiness\nanyone who's had to deal with a\ndifficult person in their lives knows\nthe psychological and emotional toll it\ntakes to listen to their criticism every\nday and when we're constantly made to\nfeel like nothing we do will ever be\ngood enough it's hard not to internalize\ntheir rejection and resort to self-blame\npeople who have had this particular\ntrauma tend to be timid overly\napologetic and hypersensitive they are\noften prone to perfectionism and\noverachieving and are likely to be\noverly self-critical as well number five\ndependence incompetence\nbeing cuddled and overprotected can also\ntear down self-esteem when everyone in\nyour life is acting like you can't ever\ndo anything by yourself and exaggerate\nhow much you need them it can lead to\nenmeshment and an underdeveloped sense\nof self that's why people who are\nspoiled and entitled also have very\nfragile egos those who've experienced\nthis are most likely to struggle with a\nlot of self-doubt hidden insecurity and\neasily fall victim to emotionally\ncodependent relationships number six\napproval or recognition seeking while it\nmight not seem so traumatic at first\nglance an overemphasis on one status\nappearance or achievement can make us\noverly approval and recognition seeking\nmaking our sense of self-worth entirely\ndependent on external rather than\ninternal validation thus those with this\nkind of emotional trauma often end up\npeople Pleasers and pushovers and tend\nto struggle with a lack of authenticity\nin their sense of self and unsatisfying\nrelationships and number seven emotional\ninhibition\nlast but certainly not the least people\nwho have been punished or invalidated\nfor their emotions told things like\nthat's nothing to get upset about just\nget over it or why are you even crying\nit's not a big deal you're just a\ncrybaby often end up emotionally stunted\nand resort to suppression avoidance and\ndenial to deal with their problems\nbecause they were taught early on that\nexpressing one's emotions is inherently\nnegative\nthey will often just bottle up their\nfeelings and ignore them until they\ncan't anymore these people are prone to\nemotional outbursts anger management\nproblems and difficulty expressing or\ncommunicating their feelings so do you\nrelate to any of the things we've\nmentioned here has watching this made\nyou realize how your own traumatic\nexperience has influenced the ways in\nwhich you try to cope\nif you feel overwhelmed right now and\nwould like to begin healing from your\ntrauma then learn better healthier ways\nof coping the best thing you can do for\nyourself is to reach out and talk to\nsomeone about it seeking help from a\nmental health care professional
