succeed as couples\nrather they need to understand the love\nlanguage their significant other speaks\nthat is not easy it requires\nunderstanding the person and how they're\ndifferent from you so knowing your\ncrush's love language is an important\npart of making sure they feel loved and\nappreciated because what feels loving to\nyou might not necessarily feel loving to\nthem two if your

more\npositively to you being patient and\nrespecting their need for time and space\nrather than trying to crowd them more\nfour the relationship patterns similar\nto our earlier point it might do you\nsome good to take a look at your crush's\nrelationship patterns before seriously\ncommitting to them first do they have a\nhistory of cheating or moving on too\nfast what are the reasons why their past\nrelationships didn't work out and what\nlessons have they learned from it while\nyou should definitely be careful not to\nseem too NOS you and asking about all of\nthis life coach Chelsea Lee trescot\nstill recommends knowing your crush's\nrelationship patterns because it allows\nyou to get to know them more deeply and\nhelps you to work together to avoid\nmaking the same mistakes five

able to\nhandle it constructively do they bounce\nback after a setback or just give it up\nAl together all of this matters because\naccording to Dr Lea their relationship\nwith themselves will mirror their\nrelationship with their Partners so The\nTelltale sign of a supportive\nsignificant other is their ability to\nforgive themselves as the saying goes\nyou can't pour from an empty cup\nopenness to Improvement in an article\nfor the economic Times author and\nprofessor of psychology Gary W lowski Jr\nstates that people tend to Value\nPartners who help them become a better\nversion of themselves he also asserts\nthat couples who grow together more have\nbetter relationships as characterized by\nby more physical affection greater\nsexual desire less conflict and greater\nrelationship satisfaction because when a\nrelationship doesn't help us grow or\nmake us more open to Improvement it can\nbe easy to feel like we're stuck in a\nrut and that it's not doing us any good\nbeing with this person hence Dr laera\nrecommends assessing first if your crush\nis able to listen well take feedback\nconstructively and openly communicate\nrather than simply avoiding their\nproblems or deflecting denying their\nmistakes to summarize having strong\nfeelings for your crush doesn't\nnecessarily guarantee that you two will\nbe compatible for one another and
