    "transcript": "Have you ever been treated\nrudely by a stranger?\nOr maybe you're surrounded by\na rude or toxic environment.\nPerhaps you have experienced\nyour family member,\nsignificant other, or friends\nbehaving rudely in front of you.\nThis is exactly what happened to Nancy.\nMeet Nancy.\n- [Nancy] Hello!\n- [Narrator] Nancy is a bright,\ncheerful college student\nwho is also working a part-time job\nin her school's convenience store.\nHer close friends describe her\nas a glass half full kind of girl,\nhardworking, extremely\ncourteous and polite.\nBut her friends worry.\nThey say her extreme politeness\ncan take a toll on her\nemotional well-being.\nRude people can sometimes\ntake advantage of her strength\nand behave improperly in her presence.\nOh no.\nSo, how does she respond to\nthese rudely-behaving fellas?\nLet's find out, shall we?\nOne fine afternoon, while\nworking her part-time job\nin the convenience store of her college,\na young lady walks up to the counter.\nShe plops a can of energy drink\nand tuna sandwiches onto it,\nall the while frantically\nlooking for something\nin her sling bag.\n- [Nancy] Excuse me, did you\nforget to bring your card?\nYou can scan using the college app,\nif you've downloaded it inside your phone.\n- [Narrator] Nancy said politely.\nThe woman rolls her eyes.\n- [Customer] And what makes\nyou think I brought my phone?\n- [Narrator] The customer\nraises her voice.\nNancy is taken aback by her snarky remark.\nShe then remembers what her\nmother has always taught her,\nto be empathetic towards people,\neven if they might seem rude to you.\nSo this is the time she can\nuse her power of empathy.\nShe decides not to take\nthe rudeness personally\nand just let it go.\nThe woman storms off,\nleaving the drink and sandwiches\non the counter, unpaid.\n- [Nancy] Maybe she's having a bad day\nand is projecting that\nupset feeling to the world.\n- [Narrator] Nancy thought to herself.\nShe feels quite calm and assured\nwhen she does not let\nthe negative behavior\naffect her emotion.\nAs they say, rudeness begets\nrudeness, and is contagious.\nSo yes, dear Psych2goers,\none tip when encountering a rude person\nis to break the cycle of rudeness\nby choosing to empathize and be kind.\nMoving along.\nDo you know what happened when Nancy\nhad to prepare a presentation,\nalong with two other\ngroupmates the other day?\nMeet Will and Amber, the\nschool's hotshot couple.\nThey were Nancy's groupmates.\nUnfortunately, both of them contributed\nvery little to the preparations.\nNancy was the one always\narranging a meeting\nto discuss what they should\ndo regarding the presentation.\nAnd most of the time,\nthe couple would bail out.\nThey said they're too busy\nwith their other classes,\nsS they always postponed the discussion.\nThe class presentation was in two days,\nso Nancy decided to send the couple\none last text in the group chat,\ninviting them to complete the slides\ntogether with her in the library.\nThey ignored her invitation.\nSo Nancy proceeded to\nlooking for information\nand doing the slides all by herself.\nAnd that is how she\nspent the whole weekend.\nFinally, after finishing up the sides,\nshe logs onto her Instagram,\nonly to find it filled with pictures\nof the star couple's Saturdate.\nOutraged, she then remembered\nreading an article a while ago\non how to behave when\nsomeone is rude towards you.\nIt said one of the ways is to count to 10\nand take a few deep breaths,\nso she did that.\n- [Nancy] One,\ntwo,\nthree.\n- [Narrator] Nancy counted taking\na few deep breaths in between.\nShe asked herself...\n- [Nancy] Is it really worth\nlosing my cool over this?\n- [Narrator] Nancy\ndecided that it's a waste\nof her emotional energy\nto let this get under her skin.\nShe lets it go,\nsince she doesn't want the situation\nto take up too much room in her life.\nTwo days later, the group\npresentation turns out quite well.\nThe professor compliments\nthe slide presentation,\nstating that the designs\nand bullet point information\nis very engaging to the audience.\nHearing the compliment,\nNancy is elated and feels appreciated.\nHowever, her bubble of joy\nbursts when Will says...\n- [Will] Thanks to my dearest Amber\nworking very hard for the presentation.\nWithout her, these slides\nwould be super dull.\n- [Narrator] Hm, do I spot another rude\nand disrespectful behavior?\nPsych2goers, here's another tip.\nWhen you're dealing with\ndisrespectful people,\nyou need to summon up your courage.\nAlways trust your gut\ninstinct and intellect.\nWhether you want the situation\nto roll off your back\nand not fight back,\nor put your foot down and make it clear\nthat you won't tolerate\nany more rude behavior,\nyou need to know when to\nbe assertive and speak up\nand when to just ignore rude behavior.\n- [Nancy] This is unfair.\n- [Narrator] Nancy thought to herself.\n- [Nancy] I spent a whole lot of time\nfinding the information and\nmaking the slides all by myself,\nand now someone else is\ngonna take the credit for it?\nThey're being rude and\ndisrespectful towards myself\nand the time that I spent\nmaking the presentation.\n- [Narrator] So that's what made Nancy\nstand up in the lecture hall.\n- [Nancy] Uh, Dr. James.\n- [Narrator] She addresses her professor.\n- [Nancy] I am their groupmate.\nI'm the one who spent my whole Saturday\nmaking the presentation.\n- [Narrator] Leaving\nWill and Amber shocked,\nNancy continued.\n- [Nancy] I designed everything\nand even edited the video\nthat was played at the\nbeginning of the presentation.\nThe only thing that they were involved in\nis to attend the class\nand present from the notes\nI made on what to say\nand highlighted during the presentation.\n- [Narrator] She also\nwanted to spill the beans\nabout them in lying to her\nand ignoring her when she asked\nfor a discussion regarding\nthe presentation,\nand having fun, instead.\nBut she thought that what\nshe'd said was already enough\nto let people know that it was her\ndoing the gritty work behind the scenes.\nAnd she won't let people\nlike Amber or Will\ntake away the appreciation from her.\n- [Dr. James] Okay, Nancy,\nthank you for letting me know.\n- [Narrator] Dr. James then continues.\n- [Dr. James] Will, Amber, I'll\nneed to see you after class.\nNancy, I'll see you separately,\nand will let you know.\n- [Narrator] Dr. James asked\nto meet Nancy two days later.\nHe asked her some questions\nand clarified things with her.\nDr. James said that this will not affect\ntheir carry marks in any way,\nsince the presentation is\njudged collectively as a group.\n- [Dr. James] I appreciate\nyou standing up for yourself.\n- [Narrator] Dr. James said.\n- [Dr. James] I hope this experience\nwill teach you more about yourself\nand how to deal with others,\nand you did a really good\njob with the presentation.\nThank you, Nancy.\n- [Narrator] Nancy feels appreciated.\nShe feels ever so grateful\nto have a supporting\nlecturer like Dr. James.\nShe walks back home with a light heart\nand a skip in her step.\nAfter all, there is a way to\nstand in the face of rudeness\nwithout resorting to it yourself.\nHave you ever encountered a person\nbehaving rudely towards you?\nHow did you respond to them?\nNow that you have some\ntips and advice from Nancy,\nlet us know in the comments below."
