    "transcript": "hi everyone welcome to ask an expert an\ninterview series where we talk about\ntopics around mental health with experts\nranging from clinicians to people with\nlived expertise\nmy name is monica and i am a\nneuroscience postgraduate student at the\nuniversity of oxford\nhere i study depression\na disabling debilitating mental health\nchallenge that is the leading cause of\nmental health disease related burden\nworldwide\nand so it's especially important for us\nto talk about it to talk about ways to\ncope and what potential treatments could\nbe like\nand so i feel especially honored to be\njoined by scott today\nsomeone who brings on lived experience\nand expertise\nhis story is incredible you'll get to\nhear from him in just a few moments\nwelcome scott\nhi monica thanks for having me\nthank you so much for joining\num it's great to be able to chat today\nabout living with\num depression and what's that like for\nyou\noh gosh\nwhat a question\nit's\nyou know when people describe depression\nwe have to use metaphors\nbecause if you just say i'm sad i'm low\nthe world's a little dark it doesn't\nencapsulate what it actually feels like\nand feelings are impossible to describe\nlike how do i describe beauty or\nwell-being how do we describe even\nhappiness when you're happy you just\nknow you're happy right\nso depression for me\nwasn't like a black cloud over my head\nand it's not like the world is losing\nsaturation and the colors aren't as\nbright\nthis was far more serious for me\num this was\ni i asked people to imagine\nwaking up every morning\nand every morning you get a phone call\nand your cell phone's right by your bed\nright and it's a phone call\nand you pick it up you say hello good\nmorning and someone says hi scott\nwe just like to let you know that\neverybody you know\nhas died\nyour family your friends and now you're\ncompletely alone okay goodbye click\nand you have to go through the day\nin this grieving and sense of aloneness\nlike you're nobody in the world anymore\nand there's an alienation and an\nisolation and you don't know how to make\nsense of it because you're like i it's\nnot my fault i didn't know what i did\nbut i still feel responsible for that\nand you go to bed\nand the next morning you kind of wake up\nokay\nand then you get the phone call and\nyou're like oh i remember what this is\ngoing to be about and we have to go\nthrough the day like that depression for\nme is it was a sense of grieving for a\nlife that\ndidn't exist\nand and this is a lot of people kind of\nresonate with this and it's that\nheaviness\nof existence it's a heaviness of of life\nand through practice and what we'll talk\nabout today a little bit monica is and\neveryone watching is\nhow can we\nwear the world lightly\nbecause depression really\nmakes us wear this heavy robe and it's\nwet and it's like it's totally heavy on\nus how can we wear something a little\nlighter what tools can we practice to\nreally just feel some levity and\nlightness in our lives and it's it's\nvery difficult with depression but i\nhope we can get to the bottom of things\nbut\nthat's how i describe it yeah\nthank you it's\nyou know i'm reading the chat right now\nblake is saying oh my goodness god you\nare so right\num sometimes it feels like the world has\njust abandoned you it's\nsuch a difficult thing to\ngo through every day essentially yeah\nyeah and blake's yeah not wrong and\neverybody has their own experiences with\ndepression right like\nlisten\njust be i've i was diagnosed in 2008\nand it's been a journey man 14 years and\ni've i've had amazing moments in the\nlast two years have been very very\ninteresting for me as far as growth and\nseeing depression in a new way\nbut\ni still get low\nlike people say scott did you beat it\ndid you cure yourself\nand i don't even know what that really\nmeans\ni still have really tough days and the\nworld sometimes is too much for me to\nhandle it's all\ntoo much every\nmaking my bed is too much showering is\ntoo much the feeling that work is part\nof the day\nsometimes these things are just too\nmuch and that's where compassion can\ncome in a little later on but if people\nfeel this way and blake knows and people\nin the comments know\nyou're not alone in that feeling man\nno it's very real and and i i empathize\nwith that and i understand that\nand\nyou need to find people that that can\nrelate to that it helps us feel\nnot so alienated and that the world has\nleft us behind\nthat's the sense sometimes that\neverything else is moving on\neveryone's doing this everyone's smiling\neverything's happening\nbut i'm\nleft behind\nwhat's that why is that happening what\ndoes that mean did i do something wrong\nis am i gonna feel like this forever\nwhat is this feeling telling me and what\ncan i do about it these are the kind of\nquestions that cycle through our mind\nright because everyone experiences\nsomething very different it could be\nuseful to talk about different ways that\npeople cope and coping can come in many\ndifferent stages and i think forms too\nwhether it's hearing that one has been\ndiagnosed with depression or hearing\nthat a friend has been diagnosed with\ndepression or hearing if oneself has\nbeen diagnosed with depression\nand\nso it might be useful to kind of share a\nbit about what that might look like for\nyou in terms of coping\num yeah so\nlike any diagnosis right\nit's like\nyep you're uh i remember i fractured my\ntibia and tore my pcl in my left knee\nmonica knows all about anatomy she's\ngoing to medical school she knows\nexactly where those tendons are and\nligaments so\ni was given that diagnosis i'm like\nokay well what's the plan like okay so i\ngot that fracture okay we're going to\nput the cast on this is what your rehab\nis going to be like this is when you've\ngot to get the cane the crutches\nall i see with a mental health diagnosis\nlike that\ndepression anxiety is\nyou know we we tend to put ourselves in\nthe boxes and then that's that's not all\nyou are\nthat's just what's happening right now\nso i saw a diagnosis and i see it now as\nit's a launch pad\nand\nwe need these launch pads in a solid\nfoundation if you're going up to space\nyou're not taking off on the rocket in a\ndesert in dubai with no concrete padding\nand out of the sand\nthe rocket ships it's gonna tip over a\ndiagnosis can be a foundation and a\nlaunch pad so then we can move towards\nsomething better something in something\na little higher something that's for our\nbest selves right something that'll be\ngood for us\nbut a foundation of okay this is what's\nhappening right now now i can put a\nlittle label on it\nbecause what is a diagnosis anyways we\nget cluster of symptoms and then we're\njust laying out okay this is what it\ncould be for sure and now we can go into\ndifferent streams of what would be good\nfor you\nokay you're feeling this way this is\nwhat we think it is okay\nwhat would be good for you then\nbecause of that let's try that and let's\nsee how that goes okay\nlet's tweak that it didn't do too well\nlet's try this with you so\nfor me it was it wasn't as intimidating\nas i thought because\nit allowed me to create that launch pad\nand now i can almost rest on that\ndiagnosis a little bit be like oh\nthat's what's going on okay we now let's\ngo for some solutions but you can make a\nplan on that launch pad you can take a\nnap on that launch pad right you can\nrest on it you can set up camp for a bit\nif you're like i don't want to do\nanything about it right now okay well at\nleast you got a little place to nap set\nup camp start a fire chill out a little\nbit\nit's like right when we get the\ndiagnosis we think oh\nnow everything has to change everything\nno\nit's a sometimes it's up to you too to\nbe like uh okay i got it\nnow i take my time now there are options\noptions are good with depression you're\nnot just confined to one thing\noptions choice okay i can do something\nabout it when i feel maybe i'm ready\nbut i see i i like to think of the\nthink of that launch pad idea that\nreally helped me\nthat's amazing so what i really hear is\njust kind of reframing the whole\nthe whole\nkind of scary daunting feeling of a\ndiagnosis as something that\nyou can take as an information source\nyou can sit with it you can do something\nabout it you have ultimately choice\nyeah i think that's a great way to do\nthat yeah like think about a doctor\nthey're there to help you the diagnosis\nis there to help and i know it's\ndaunting sometimes right but like you i\ndon't know i went it was like a cheap h\nm shirt but i went to the store and i'm\nlike i gotta look for a they have the\ntags on it for sizes i'm like i'm\nlooking for the label that's a medium\nokay\ni used to be a small i'm getting bigger\nbut i'm a medium now because this helps\nme make the right choice for me and\nthing to fit me the best way so a\ndiagnosis it's just finding something at\nthis point in your life it's not a\nforever thing it doesn't have to be at\nthis point in my life i'm looking for\nmedium t-shirts we go through another\npandemic i'm going to be looking for\nlarge t-shirts something a little more\nroom in the gut okay so it depends\nwhat stage you're at in your life and\nwhat's going to fit you best in a\ndiagnosis that's all it has to be\ndoesn't have to be bigger than that\ni love how you use this reframing tool\num you know in the idea of cognitive\nbehavioral therapy cbt reframing is also\none of the many different tools that\na therapist or even a friend might\nrecommend someone else a try so i'm\nreally glad that we brought this up yeah\num\nyeah and what has it been like for you\non kind of a day-to-day basis\nbecause we mentioned more like the\nthe time before\num hearing about the diagnosis and i\nthought it might be useful to focus on\njust you know every day\nwhen you when i look back at my life\nit's very easy to think that years were\nterrible\nthat i had weeks that were all bad days\nthat were all bad 100 bad\nand then if i reframe and i really think\nabout it i really think about the years\nthe last 14 years since that diagnosis\nhow many days if i had a calendar and a\nstamp right and i had this big red stamp\nthat said failure\nright how many days could i really stamp\nthe whole entire day was a complete\nwrite-off a complete waste of time\nwhere i was just debilitated and a\ncomplete nobody and it was the worst day\never how many days could i write off i\ndon't think i could write off one\nto be honest in every day even if i deal\nwith depression for the whole day\nthere is a\nshining light\nno matter how small\nthere is one little good thing\nthat came from that i don't care if i'm\nin bed all day and i discover a new\nmozart song that that hit me just just\nhere i'm like oh i felt good for a\nsecond then i can't write off the whole\nday with a failure stamp\njust if there's one good thing in the\nday that means it's not a write-off\nand anyone who's been through depression\nhad panic attacks during the day you\nknow it felt completely low and hopeless\nif we can just shift and just see okay\nhey i ate a meal today hey i had a cup\nof tea today and that warm sensation in\nthe body that felt good for a second\nbecause with depression for me i just\nhad to wait some days for the clouds to\nbreak for a second\nand then okay i feel good oh my god i\nfeel okay there's a bit of hope in the\nfuture okay yeah yeah hold on to that\nit's gone okay\nthat's the day\nit's not a write-off so\nlisten the last many years\nhave been\nto be honest like 99\nfantastic\ni've been very happy the last 14 years\nit's been an incredible life going to\nschool working in all types of jobs uh\nnon-profits for-profits in tech in in\nmental health right for the canadian\nmental health association helping people\nwith my youtube channel and podcast\nif if we can\nthe biggest thing that helped me was\nbeing of service\nbecause with depression\npeople who deal with depression were and\nanxiety were more likely to use the\nwords i and me in our vocabulary that's\npretty pretty standard\ni feel this way i can't believe i did\nthat i'm such a failure what did i do\nwrong they don't like me they look at me\nthat way i wonder how they perceive me\nwhen we be of service to others\nand we do things for other people it\ntakes the thoughts about ourselves how\nwe're all consumed\nand it puts our energy towards something\nelse someone else\nit's it call it a distraction but it's a\ngood one\nif you want to lose your sense of self\nand ego\ndo things for other people\nyou know volunteer somewhere and if you\ncan't have enough energy if your mom's\nmaking something in the kitchen hey i'll\nwash a dish for you mom or hey dad i saw\nthe cars a little dirty i brought it to\nthe car wash i went i went for a drive\nand washed the car or i vacuum the mats\nyou know like these little things i'll\ntell you\na few weeks ago i had a low low low day\nand all i could do was wash the car\nand that brought me comfort because it\nwas a tangible action for us to do and\nsomething we'll talk about with\ncompassion in a second\ncar is dirty\nwhat is the best possible thing in the\nworld in the universe that i can do\nwash the car oh\nthat brings comfort we have a problem in\neveryday life this is life this is very\nstandard easy\nsimple living and i love that the car is\ndirty what would be good for me what\nwould be good for my dad what would be\ngood for the car\nlet's wash the car that's all i did that\nday three hours i detailed that thing i\nwaxed it i vacuumed it\nthese are the things that are important\nfor me when i'm dealing with depression\nand that day\nstamped with a win\nthese are these are the wins that we can\ntake care of ourselves with when when\ntimes are tough\ni absolutely love this idea of\ncelebrating little wins it doesn't have\nto be huge it could be\nsomething\njust as meaningful as getting out of bed\nbecause that in of itself can be quite\ndifficult to do yes and monica and we\ngotta talk for an hour but we'll keep it\nshort i just wanna say\nyou know\npeople listening to\nwhat is a win actually because we\ncompare ourselves social media what we\nsee in the world\nwe think that we need to achieve this\ngrandiose purpose in life that we need\nto be this famous successful amazing\nperson and then we'll be happy then\nwe'll be somebody\nand we need to redefine the word win or\namazing in our lives the fact that\neverybody here\njoined this and watched it and came to\nlearn something new the fact that you're\nawake\nright now maybe you're still in bed the\nfact that you went to school the fact\nthat you ate a meal that you cooked that\nyou cleaned that you went to bed that\nyou made your bed that you studied that\nyou brushed your hair that you put on\nclothes\nthese are the things in daily life that\nare amazing that you do\nwhy do you think we need to prove\nourselves more than that why do you\nthink you need to be better than that\nthat oh i'm not good enough because i\ndidn't start a business oh i'm not good\nenough because i don't have a girlfriend\nor boyfriend i'm not good enough because\ni'm not the most popular person in\nschool i'm not good enough because the a\nminus didn't feel good i only got a c\nplus\nyou're amazing just by\nexisting and by existence we're moving\nforward by existing\njust by being here by doing what you do\nby being who you are\nit's an incredible feat\nand we we need to show ourselves that\nand and start to believe that within\nourselves like hey\ni'm me i'm doing this life thing\nsure it doesn't feel great sometimes\nsure i get really down and things are\nreally tough because i'm a sensitive\nperson\nbut man let me beat my chest a little\nbit let me walk to my own drum and say\ni'm doing it i'm doing this life thing i\ndon't need to prove myself to anybody\nthat for me\nis amazing that for me is a win\nso we don't need to achieve this\ngrandiose thing that we're taught that\nwe need to do to be somebody if you're\nkind if you wash that car if you went to\nschool if you smiled at somebody\nthat's a day that's a that's a day in\nheaven\nfor somebody else and for yourself just\nmark that win these are the things that\ni think about during the day when i have\na bad day and i'm like hey hold on\nyou're awesome chill chill chill be\ngentle with yourself be gentle\nwhat i hear is a lot of the idea of\nself-compassion\ni think this is something we can focus a\nfew minutes to talk about it's\ndefinitely a topic that we could talk\nabout for hours so if anyone here is\ninterested please give the idea of\ncompassionate inquiry or self-compassion\na quick google search and do some\nresearch because the field is absolutely\nphenomenal\nbut yes i'd love to hear your\nperspective on self-compassion and what\nit really means to you\nwell okay so we hear empathy a lot we\nhear of sympathy a lot but compassion is\na little different\ncompassion\nif you see someone struggling\nokay\ncompassion is the felt urge\nto relieve that suffering from that\nperson so compassion\ni feel like it rhymes with action okay\nso the action is in the word compassion\nwhen you have compassion\nfor yourself and other people you're\nactually taking action\nand think of that word passion\nmonica and everyone think about\nif you're passionate about something\nif you're passionate about basketball\nall right\nand i ask you oh you're passionate about\nbasketball you're like yeah yeah yeah\ni'm like oh do you play you're like no\nno no i'm like okay uh do you watch\nbasketball no no no no do you own a\nbasketball no no no do you have any\nposters of basketball players no no no\nthen where's the passion right so pat if\nsomeone's passionate about something\nyou're watching basketball you're\nplaying it you collect you know\nbasketball cards something like that\nso when we offer ourselves compassion\npassion means action and it's being\npassionate and offering yourself a sense\nof action towards yourself so\nif i'm offering myself self-compassion\nwhat does that mean\nthat means that if monica and i\nif right behind me near my little little\nlight there and by my map which is of\nthe roman empire\nin constantine's uh\nconstant the roman world yeah 337\nwhenever constantine was run in the\nworld love that map\nand i'm passionate about the roman\nhistory that's why i got the map see it\nworks it's action so\nself-compassion is\nif someone was behind me right now\nand you can practice this yourself if\nanyone wants to close their eyes are we\nokay to do that monika real quick\nokay i'll close my eyes too i want to do\nthis practice today too because this\nmorning wasn't the best\nso\neveryone\nif you can\njust come into where you are\nwhere your feet are where your sit bones\nare\nclose your eyes and come into your body\nand if you can imagine\njust creating a bit of space and\ndistance\nand hovering over yourself\nlooking at yourself from behind your\nchair\nwherever you are\njust watching yourself\nfrom behind\nwhat do you want to say to that person\nthat's sitting\nwatching this stream\nwhat do you want to tell them\nand what do they want to tell you\nand as a best friend would\ncome a little closer\nand maybe give that person a hug\nor whatever they need\nin this moment\nwhat do they need\nfrom you\nand\n[Music]\nwhenever you're ready you don't have to\nbut if you'd like you can open your eyes\nagain\nusually this is over like a 10 15 minute\nmeditation\nbut what i usually get from people is\nthe person behind us that's like acting\nlike a best friend caregiver the higher\nself\nand we see my i see myself sitting in\nthis chair\nand what do i want to say to myself i\nwant to say hey scott a good job on the\nstream so far\nand i know you were tired this morning\nand that's okay\nyou know and maybe for some of us\ntoday's been a hard day\nand then that person that saw us from\nbehind says\ni know it's been hard\ni know i know you're going through a\nhard time\nit's gonna be okay\ni love you anyways\nright\nno matter how you feel i love you\nanyways\nthis is when we create that distance\nfrom emotion so the self-compassion\nis removing ourselves a little from the\ninternal dialogue of why me i'm such a\nterrible person\nwhy am i feeling this way i'm such a\nloser\ngreat distance that's all that exercise\nis you create some distance\nbetween you and the emotion and you see\nthat person there who's dealing with\nthat\nthat's the distance from emotion\nother things to offer self-self\ncompassion is you can hold all of these\nemotions that we feel in a ball\nand just look at them and you hold this\nball and how emotions are so complex\nthey have different layers and they get\nall tangled so you have a ball of yarn\nhere\nand you look at it and you can twist it\nyou can see it from different angles\nright and just look objectively like\nyou're a scientist like monica the\nscientist the neuroscientist look at\nthese things huh\nokay i'm thinking that is that really\ntrue\nhmm is is me beating myself up right now\nis that\ni see that thought there that i'm i'm no\ngood and i'm never gonna be loved by\nanyone hmm\nis that true\nno i don't i don't think so let me look\nat that from another angle oh yeah my\nmom and dad love me oh yeah people at\nschool they smiled at me today yeah so\nthat's not true okay okay and offer\nyourself that that kindness that we know\nwe have in ourselves what a best friend\nwould say to you\nwhat monica would say to you in her soft\npodcast voice what would she say to you\nright so these are the perspectives that\nwe can bring\nto offer ourselves\nsome compassion and love because i know\nwe're over time but\njust 10 more seconds\nwith depression i had to really realize\ni blamed myself for 10 years\ni always thought it was my fault that oh\ni wasn't thinking the right way for all\nthose years and you know oh it's because\ni didn't exercise enough or it's because\nthis happened in childhood in this and\nthis and this\nis that my fault\noh yeah my life was going just great and\nthen i thought hey you know what spice\nthings up a bit a little depression yeah\nthat would make my life great do you\nthink i did that you think we wake up\nevery morning everybody and think hey\ni don't want to have a good day today\nhow about a little anxiety and\ndepression spice things up of course not\nit's not our fault that we go through\nthese things\nthe blame you know what i mean it's like\nwow\nlet's really be like it's not my fault\nit's not your fault\nit's not we're just\nsometimes we lose genetic lotteries\nbut i tell you what\nthat i promise you there's another side\nand i've seen the other side\nand\nour sensitivity to the world and our\nemotions\nit is a gift\nif like i've used it you know for the\nbetterment of myself\nand it took a while\nbut\nanyone who's struggling right now hang\nin there there's another side i promise\noffer yourself some love and compassion\nthank you so much for sharing this\npowerful exercise i could just feel
