    "transcript": "hey sectagors let's talk about burnout\nyep it's a rough one today\nare you a high achiever do you work\nreally really hard during the week are\ndetailed plans and complicated to-do\nlists the very fiber of your being even\nif you managed to accomplish everything\nyou wanted do you still find yourself\ntotally exhausted and unsatisfied\nyou may be achieving all of your goals\nwhich is great yet you may also be\nworking too hard to achieve those very\nsame goals\ndoes this sound familiar it's very\nlikely that you may be experiencing\nburnout according to helpguide.org\nburnout is classified as a state of\nemotional physical and mental exhaustion\ncaused by excessive and prolonged stress\nit occurs when you feel overwhelmed\nemotionally drained and unable to meet\nconstant demands\nso how do you know for sure if you're\nexperiencing burnout well here are the\nseven stages of burnout which stage are\nyou in number one a desired level of\nhigh achievement\nthe first level isn't necessarily\nconnected to burnout itself you can be a\nhigh achiever who's still able to\nbalance all of your work during the week\nthere's nothing inherently wrong with\nwanting to do your best in any situation\nand people may appreciate it as well\nyour desire to be a high achiever can be\nthe basis for potential burnout later on\nthough\nif you're the kind of person who desires\na constant high level of success this\nmay be because you also feel a strong\nneed to prove yourself\nproving yourself is a key thing that\npeople often need when they're around\nothers\nthe key thing to remember when wanting\nto prove yourself is that it's not just\nfor one particular project you most\nlikely want to be successful with all\nsorts of different work\nif others appreciate the hard work you\nput into something this will potentially\ncreate an unspoken expectation on\nyourself\nit can be created by others or even\nyourself\nyou'll likely desire to keep working\nharder and harder to maintain this\ninitial success\nit's important to keep track of why\nyou're working so hard ask yourself\nis it because you want to or do you\nthink it's because you're expected to by\nothers\nnumber two\nneglect\ndo you find yourself forgetting to\nchange your clothes from the day before\ndid you forget to apply deodorant brush\nyour teeth or even have a shower\noops do you find yourself forgetting\nlittle details about your work\nyou may be becoming neglectful\nwhen you have a lot of work to get done\nsometimes you might become overwhelmed\nby trying to get too much done in a\nshort time\nthere are only so many hours in a day\nthe burnout at this stage can be due to\nthe fact that you may be too tired\nif you're lacking in energy you may be\neating less than your body needs to\nproperly function\nhaving less than three square meals a\nday not only affects your diet but also\nhow you generally feel about yourself\nif you're avoiding meals then you may\nbecome tired this neglect can be so\naggressive at times that you might be\ntoo tired to eat\nwhy\nbecause you're not eating in the first\nplace does that make sense\nthink of a snake eating its own tail\nalso known as an auroborus oh hey there\ndid you relate to these two stages so\nfar comment below we want to remind you\nto take it easy and if you're feeling\nburnt out

it\nit's okay i'll wait\ndone\nthanks now let's move on to the next\npoint\nnumber three denial do you find yourself\neasily frustrated by even the most minor\nof inconveniences or the simplest of\nconversations\nis your first instinct at that very\nquestion to shout no i don't\nif you're at the third level of burnout\nyou're probably feeling denial even if\nyou claim you're not here you'll likely\ntake issue with accepting responsibility\nfor problems that you might have caused\nsay you have an aggressive outburst at a\nfriend during your morning coffee\nthis moment might shock your friend\nbecause it seemed like such an out of\ncharacter moment for you\nwhen you're in denial you're more likely\nnot to apologize for your behavior\nif your friend knows about your need for\na higher level of achievement they may\ncall you out for this apparent burnout\nbased attitude\nthe denial may kick in where you insist\nthat you're fine and not overworking\nyourself\nnumber four withdrawal\ndo you often find yourself withdrawing\nfrom certain situations\nif you find yourself denying the amount\nof stress you're under your response may\nbe to withdraw\nthe pain you could be ignoring can\nsometimes become so sharp and so great\nthe only response that you can think of\nmay be withdrawing entirely removing\nyourself from the situation\nand to a greater extent your emotions is\nan important defense mechanism to\nrecognize in yourself\nat this stage you'll likely ignore\nfriends family and social functions\ndo you find yourself ignoring text\nmessages it's normal to not respond to\none or two texts here and there most\npeople do this\nif you're feeling burned out those one\nor two texts can become five or six\nmaybe 10 or 12.\nburnout can cause you to ignore almost\nall of your messages to the point that\nyou feel overwhelmed by not texting even\none person back\nthe more you let the messages build the\nless likely you are to ever reply back\nwithdrawal may even make you want to\navoid going to parties it takes a lot of\nenergy to be in social settings for sure\nespecially if you identify as an\nintrovert\nif you find yourself ignoring contact\nwith your loved ones whether that's\ndigitally or in person it may upset your\nsocial circle\nnumber five\nemptiness and depersonalization\nthe fifth level of burnout is definitely\na tough one\nonce you've removed yourself from your\nsocial life you may begin to feel an\noverwhelming sense of emptiness\nyou may be unhappy with your job for\ninstance if your work makes you feel\nentirely unfulfilled it's possible that\nyou've lost your own identity and sense\nof self along the way\nif the work you do feels utterly soul\ncrushing you may feel like just another\ncog in the corporate machine\nas someone who's a hard worker\nyou may be more likely to become\nfrustrated when all you do at your job\ngoes seemingly unappreciated\ndoes your boss almost never say thank\nyou do they only talk to you whenever\nthey have a problem that needs fixing\nfeeling unappreciated at work is a key\nfactor in why people often quit their\njob there's a common saying for this\npeople don't quit jobs they quit bad\nbosses\ndo you feel this deep in your bones\nif your job is no longer satisfactory\nyou probably feel a lot less like an\nindividual person and more of a\ncollective conglomerate\nlost in the corporate shuffle\ntalking to a friend or medical\nprofessional about how you're feeling\nmay help\nnumber six\ndepression and numbness\ndo you feel empty lately\nthe irony of numbness is that there's no\nphysical sensation in your body\nhow do you actually feel when you're\nnumb\nit may be hard to describe the exact\nsensation but you certainly know it when\nit happens\nthe emptiness that can be experienced\nwhen you're depressed may be so great\nthat you feel numb\neven on an emotional level\nif you feel numb to this scale\nyou may be more inclined to partake in\nsubstance and or drug abuse\nthis can lead to intense depression do\nthe sails on your boat feel totally\ndeflated do you find almost all of your\nmotivation to be totally gone\nwhen you're depressed\nit can make you feel entirely lost and\nadrift at sea\nwhen you're aimlessly drifting it's\nbecause you don't have any wind to guide\nyou\ndepression can feel like all the wind is\ngone from your life\nnumber seven\nexhaustion and collapse\nthe seventh and final stage of burnout\nis you guessed it the hardest one to\ndeal with these feelings can manifest\nthemselves in both physical and\nemotional forms when you are physically\nburnt out your legs can turn to jelly\nfiguratively not literally thankfully\nbut the sensation of physical burnout\ncan make you feel like all bone\nstructure inside of your body has become\nentirely non-existent\nemotional burnout is a similar feeling\nto those pesky jelly legs but instead\nit's your brain if you're emotionally\nexhausted then activities you once used\nto enjoy like reading a book or watching\na movie may no longer be fun for you\nthey may become more of a chore than\nsomething that you used to do to rest\nand relax\nif you've reached that last level it's\nvery important that you recognize the\nfact that you've gotten there\nthe first step to solving a problem is\nrecognizing there is one\neating some nutritious food getting\nbetter sleep or listening to music you\nenjoy can all help lower the stress that\nhas somatically built itself up inside\nyour body\ndid any of these symptoms ring a bell\nfor you\nwhere do you rank on this
