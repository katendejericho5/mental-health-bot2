    "transcript": "ever wonder why sticking to a routine or\nkeeping up with New Year's resolutions\nfeels so hard a bit like your Copus\nconstantly pushing a boulder up a hill\nonly to watch it roll back down the\nstruggle is real and you're not alone\nwe've all been there maybe you set your\nmind on a goal swore to stick to a plan\nonly to stop once your motivation\nfizzled out whether it's learning a new\nlanguage controlling your spending or\nbecoming more active staying\nconsistently on track is hard but do you\nknow why well psychology has a few\nanswers for you let's dive in shall we\nthe brains tug of war according to\nneurologists our minds tend to strongly\nlean towards what's predictable we are\nhardwired to enjoy what's easy safe and\ncomfortable over what's not often When\nwe struggle to stay consistent it's\nbecause our goal is neither of the\nthings for example exercising more going\nto the gym seems like such a hassle when\nwe could just lay in bed all night\nwatching TV like we usually do right but\nlike the famous BoJack Horseman quote\ngoes it gets easier every day it gets\neasier but you have to do it every day\nthat's the hard part that's why\nself-help experts recommend the 10minute\nhack commit to doing a task for just 10\nminutes and it won't seem so EX\nexhausting anymore often getting started\nis the hardest part but once you do\neverything seems more\nmanageable the instant gratification\nmonkey another interesting thing about\nour brains is that We crave immediate\nreward so when you're trying to be\nconsistent it'll suddenly come up with\nso many other more fun easier things to\ndo like watch Netflix or go on social\nmedia studying for example is more about\nlong-term gain than instant\ngratification\ndo it for too long and you'll suddenly\nstart thinking to yourself just one more\nepisode won't hurt or I'll start\nstudying after a quick scroll through\nInstagram so instead of trying to study\ncontinuously for hours experts recommend\ntaking short 5 to 15 minute breaks in\nbetween to satisfy your need for\nimmediate gratification this is called\nthe Pomodoro method a well recommended\nstudying strategy no accountability when\nyou're struggling to stay consistent\nwith something sh share your goals with\na friend or partner that way you'll have\nsomeone to hold you accountable for your\nprogress because without accountability\nit's easy to succumb to the whims of the\ninstant gratification monkey or the\nAllure of procrastination this leads to\ninconsistency because there's no\nexternal Force gently nudging you back\non track or acknowledging your\nachievements along the way but when you\nknow someone is rooting for you\nexpecting updates on your progress it\nadds a layer of responsibility that can\nbe a powerful motivator the fear of\nletting your accountability partner down\ncan be just the push you need to stick\nyour commitment even when the going gets\ntough\nprocrastination no preparation if you've\nmade it this far you'll hopefully\nalready have a good idea about why we\nprocrastinate any guesses yeah that's\nright the instant gratification monkey\nour brains love immediate satisfaction\nfortunately there are are plenty of\ntechniques you can try to overcome your\nprocrastination like eat the Frog tackle\nthe big stuff first or Atomic habits\nsmall doable steps you can also do\nmeditation or mindfulness to stay on\ntrack every time you feel yourself\ngetting distracted whatever you do just\nkeep in mind that today's tasks are\neither going to be tomorrow's victories\nor headache skip this lacking your\nfuture self-d deserv is better than\ncleaning up your m\ncrush them now and your future self will\nthank you perfectionist paralysis raise\na hand if you've ever abandon a project\nbecause it didn't meet your Skyhigh\nstandards we've all been there the fear\nof not doing things perfectly can lead\nto not doing them at all but being too\nafraid to make mistakes or fall short is\nonly getting in the way of our own\nprogress the fix Embrace imperfection\nrealize mistakes are Stepping Stones not\nnot roadblox break tasks into smaller\nachievable chunks and learn to enjoy the\nprocess you'll not only ease the\npressure on yourself but also Foster a\nhealthier and more productive mindset\nremember Rome wasn't built in a day so\nthere you have it dear viewers\nconsistency really is a tricky thing to\nmaster but hopefully unraveling these\nsecrets together gave you a better idea\non how to tackle it remember it's okay\nto stumble take a break or even take an\nunplanned detour sometimes be kind to\nyourself and simply start over with a\nbit of patience grit and self-awareness\nyou can achieve anything you set your\nmind to so what
