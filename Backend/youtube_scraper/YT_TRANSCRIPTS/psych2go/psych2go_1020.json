everything there is to\nknow\nbut surprisingly there are still areas\nregarding depression that are quite\nobscure\nmany resources simply list symptoms of\ndepression most people who talk about\ndepression paint a picture of someone\nlying in bed under the covers without\nany energy or motivation\nalthough fatigue is a telltale sign of\ndepression it is not the only one\nthere is a myriad of subtle personality\nshifts that occur when you slip into a\ndepressive state\nso here are five lesser-known symptoms\nof depression\nnumber one emotional toggling\nemotional toggling refers to an extreme\nshift in emotions a happy moment can\ntake you out of your blues but only for\na moment you may experience radical\nshifts and emotions where one moment you\nfeel at your lowest and in the next\nmoment you feel euphoric\nemotional toggling can be confused for\nhypomania and thus being misdiagnosed as\nbipolar disorder or borderline\npersonality disorder but it also affects\npeople with depression\nthese up days are usually caused by\nexternal factors like a promotion at\nwork or good news\nthough you may not seem depressed at the\nmoment internally you may still be\nbattling with depression\nthese intense mood swings damper your\nmoments of success or happiness and can\nmake you feel confused about your\nemotions\nnumber two forgetfulness though\nforgetfulness is a common trait of\ndepression it is a trait typically\noverlooked it's easy to ignore because a\nlapse in memory happens\nit happens to everyone\nhowever absent-mindedness caused by\ndepression happens because the person is\nruminating\nthey are most likely trapped inside\ntheir mind\nadditionally depression affects your\nmemory studies show that depression can\nproduce short-term memory loss\none recommended way to tackle depression\nfog is through exercise\nit may seem counterintuitive because you\nmight not have energy but exercising\ngets you out of your head\nnumber three inability to concentrate\ndepression can also affect your\nconcentration\nconcentration problems are attributed to\nadhd but it can also be a sign of\ndepression\ndepression is a private battle where you\nbattle your mind in a depressive state\nyou experience intrusive thoughts about\nworthlessness and sadness\nnegative intrusive thoughts distract you\nfrom your work or push you to engage in\nself-soothing habits such as distracting\nyourself with your phone or scrolling\nthrough youtube or food\nconcentration issues can set you back on\nyour assignments\nthus causing you to miss deadlines and\nassignments\nif you find yourself ruminating or\ndealing with intrusive thoughts take a\nmoment to observe them\nbreathe\nand step back from your mind\nyou can also try to find an activity\nthat grounds you in the present\nyoga and meditation are great practices\nthat can help you get out of your head\nnumber four\nextreme guilt\nthough experiencing guilt from time to\ntime is not an indicator of your\nemotional state\nexcessive guilt is a sign of depression\nin fact it was listed as a symptom in\n1994 by the american psychiatric\nassociation\nthe guilt you experience in a depressive\nstate is all-consuming\nthe guilt you feel prevents you from\nseeing past your mistakes it snowballs\ninto feeling guilty for forgetting a\nbirthday to feeling guilty for being\nborn\nthe guilt someone with depression\nexperiences builds and builds and can\nget to a point where it pushes them\ntowards suicidal thoughts or ideations\nguilt is something that happens\nprivately it festers during stifled\npauses in a conversation and hides\nbehind self-depreciating jokes\nand number five\nrigid perfectionism\naccording to shannon kalikowski author\nof when depression hurts your\nrelationship\nhaving and holding yourself to rigid\nideals are contributors and byproducts\nof depression in the context of\ndepression perfectionism belies the idea\nthat others will love you if you are\nperfect\nit conflates your self-worth to what you\ndo\nunfortunately this makes you susceptible\nto easily lapse into depressive episodes\nespecially when something goes wrong\ndepression comes in all shapes and\ncolors and affects us all differently\nit is a very real and very serious\nmental illness\nbut you don't have to fight it all on\nyour own\ndon't be afraid to ask for help nor let\nthe stigmas attached deter you\nno matter how bad it gets there's always\nhope that things can get better\nreaching out to a psychologist or a\ncounselor and getting the help that you\nneed and deserve can not only improve\nyour life but also encourage others to\nbreak away from the stigmas to seek help\ndo any of these describe your experience\ntell us in the comments if you have
