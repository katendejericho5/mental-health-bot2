    "transcript": "hey psych2goers do you currently like\nsomeone and you're pretty sure they like\nyou but you can't help but feel\nsomething is off you've had a few ideas\nof what could be wrong but your god is\ntelling you they may have a fear of\nrejection how can you tell\nwell if for some reason you don't want\nto discuss your concerns or perhaps you\nwant a few more signs something is off\nbefore bringing up the subject there are\na few ways that you may be able to tell\nif someone is afraid of rejection here\nare a few signs they like you but fear\nyou'll reject them\nnumber one they try to spend time with\nyou and do but often disappear\nso\nyou're starting to get emotionally close\nwhen you notice they pull away suddenly\nthat day or soon after\nyour conversations are interesting and\nyou talk with them daily you even text\neach other good morning and good night\nbut then suddenly they start to become\nbusy and then seemingly disappear out of\nthe blue it could be possible they're\ntrying to see if you're still interested\nin them but even if you then start to\ndrift away in reaction as well they\noften will come back to see how you're\ndoing this could be due to the idea that\nas much as they do fear rejection they\nstill can't help but care about you it's\nbest to discuss this with them and\nfigure out what's going on and what\nthey're thinking\nnumber two\nwhen they first met you they were really\nnervous\nis this person a crush or have you\nalready been out on a date with them\nmaybe you've talked to them a few times\nso you know each other pretty well by\nnow\nwell think back to when you first met\nthem how nervous were they\nif they were obviously nervous it's a\ncommon sign that they like you\nmany individuals with a fear of\nrejection will often be more anxious on\na first date because they very much want\nthings to go well they may be wondering\nif you like them as well so they become\na bit nervous about the idea if you\nnotice they're having trouble talking\nand their palms are sweaty perhaps try\nto ease their nerves on a second date\nand go somewhere that's comfortable for\nthem\ndo they have a favorite spot they often\ngo to how about a picnic at the park\nthere are many ways you can help both\nyou and your date to feel calm and\ncomfortable\nand number three\nthey don't often bring up their needs\nand they're more passive\nhave you noticed that they don't often\nbring up their needs everyone is\ndifferent and has different levels of\nenergy but if you notice they've been\nacting a bit passive lately and don't\noften bring up their needs or desires\nthis could be due to a fear of rejection\nmany with a fear of rejection also fear\nconfrontation both partners needs and\nwants are valid and important in a\nrelationship so if it seems as if\nthey're holding back on what they want\nyou could gently bring up the topic on\nwhat they need in a relationship what\nare they hoping for in a relationship\nwhat do they emotionally need are you\ngetting what you want as well\nnumber four they're often a people\npleaser\nwith their friends they're pretty chill\nbut with you you've noticed they seem to\nbe more of a people-pleaser they go out\nof their way to please you even when it\ncould negatively affect them for example\nyou may not have known it at first but\nyou find out later they cancelled\nimportant plans because they didn't want\nto say no to your request to go out or\nmaybe they don't express their genuine\nopinion because they try to keep one\nthat's fairly similar to yours\nthey always seem to not along with your\nopinion even though you remembered they\nfelt very different before while having\ncommon interests and opinions is a great\nthing in a relationship it's important\nthat they aren't altering their opinion\njust to please you they may be thinking\nthis is something you want if something\nseems off a calm discussion about your\nconcerns could be a good idea for those\nin a relationship people can have\ndifferent opinions and compromising can\nbe healthy\nnumber five they do silly things to try\nand impress you\nit's a common sign that if someone often\nattempts to impress you they like you\neven if they like you as a friend they\nmay want to impress you but this is\nespecially true when someone has a crush\non someone do you notice they often try\nto impress you every time they can\nthey may try to often show you what\nmakes them a suitable partner or maybe\nyou don't know each other that well yet\nso they try to impress you because that\nmeans you may notice them\nthey may just be afraid to flat out tell\nyou they like you so they impress you in\nhopes you'll approach them\nnumber six\nthey go above and beyond when doing kind\nthings for you but don't like to open up\nemotionally\ndoes your partner often open up\nemotionally to you\nare they ever vulnerable\nsome partners have trouble expressing\ntheir feelings and fears some may\nbelieve that expressing their feelings\nof fear will only drive their spouse\naway\nbut one of the most important aspects of\na relationship communication if your\npartner refrains from talking about\ntheir feelings but you notice they go\nout of their way to do things for you\nthey likely do have feelings for you but\nthose who don't often express their\nfeelings show them through their actions\nso pay attention to what they do if they\nshow you they care for you they probably\nlike you but may have a fear of\nrejection that's holding them back when\nin doubt or if there are any concerns in\nyour relationship it's a good idea to\nsimply bring them up with your partner\nask them what's going on and they may\nhave an easier time opening up if you\nkindly ask\nso\ndo you think someone likes you but may\nhave a fear of rejection feel free to\nlet us know in the comments section\nbelow\nwe hope you enjoyed this video if you\ndid don't forget to click the
