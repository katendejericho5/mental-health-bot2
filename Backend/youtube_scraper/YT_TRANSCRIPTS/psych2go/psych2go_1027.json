    "transcript": "trauma and its aftermath have a huge\nimpact on every part of our lives\nhealing from trauma can lead to a lot of\npositive growth self-awareness and\nincreased resilience\nbut of course it can also impact us in a\nlot of negative ways that we may not\neven be aware of\ntrauma comes in many forms from\nemotional to physical to psychological\nsimply put a traumatic experience can\nrefer to any situation that evokes an\nintense overwhelming and long-lasting\nsense of fear anxiety and stress\nif left unresolved this trauma can\nmanifest in a lot of negative ways\nwith that said here are seven signs that\nyou're not a bad person it's your trauma\nnumber one\nyou're always looking for the first sign\nof trouble\nhas anyone ever told you that you're too\nmuch of a negative thinker are you\nusually the first to give up when things\nget tough do you find it difficult to\nforgive and forget when someone else\nwrongs you\nif you said yes to any of these things\ndon't be so quick to blame yourself\nthese are actually all common responses\nto trauma there are even studies that\nshow how trauma makes it more difficult\nfor us to be optimistic\nbecause experience has taught us to\nalways keep an eye out for the first\nsign of trouble number two you have a\nhard time trusting others\nsimilar to the previous point many\ntrauma survivors also struggle to trust\nand get close to others even their loved\nones trauma makes them more emotionally\ndistant and closed off and more\nsuspicious of everyone's motives and\nintentions\nthey tend to overthink and hyperfixate\nevery little thing someone else says or\ndoes because of this they also have a\nhard time asking for help from others or\nopening up to them about their true\nfeelings\nnumber three\nyou socially withdraw sometimes\none of the most i'll tell warning signs\nthat someone is still struggling with\ntheir trauma is if it starts to affect\ntheir interpersonal relationships and\nmakes them socially withdraw at times\nhave you found yourself always declining\ninvitations or cancelling at the last\nminute\ndo you never feel like spending time\nwith your loved ones anymore or keeping\nin touch with them would you rather just\nbe by yourself doing nothing even though\nit doesn't make you happy\ndon't beat yourself up for becoming more\nsocially withdrawn and losing interest\nin your hobbies and relationships\nit's likely an unfortunate effect of\nyour trauma\nnumber four\nyou sabotage your own relationships\nhave you ever found yourself getting\nclose to someone and growing to love\nthem be it romantically or platonically\nonly to find that it makes you feel\nscared\nunsettled or uncomfortable do you ever\nfeel compelled to just run away or\nsabotage your own relationships\nespecially when things are going well\nalthough you may not be doing it\nconsciously you've likely internalized\nyour past traumatic experiences\nespecially those that involve other\npeople\nso that you now expect every\nrelationship of yours from now on to\nfail and that's why you self sabotage\nnumber five you have unhealthy coping\nmechanisms\nwhen people are struggling mentally and\nemotionally and don't know how to deal\nwith it it can be easy to feel\noverwhelmed and turn to unhealthy coping\nmechanisms instead\nsome people start binge drinking and\npartying while others turn to gambling\nand overspending others might oversleep\nto avoid their problems and feelings or\novereat to make themselves feel better\nfor a moment\nsome resort to self-harm self-neglect or\nputting themselves in danger\nwhatever the unhealthy coping mechanism\nmight be the bottom line is that it\nlikely stems from you looking for a way\nto grapple with your trauma\nnumber six you're emotionally repressed\nand distant\nfollowing a traumatic event most people\ntend to feel vulnerable afraid ashamed\nconfused violated or even hopeless\nso when we're not ready to confront our\nfeelings yet we often end up murraying\nthem instead but once you start it can\nbe hard to stop especially when you\nhaven't fully dealt with or processed\nyour trauma so if you notice you've\nbecome more emotionally repressed and\ndistant\never since the trauma\nthis is likely why\nand number seven\nyou can't control your emotions\nanother sign that someone is still\nstruggling with the fallout of their\ntrauma is that they can't control their\nemotions opposite to our earlier point\nsome people may feel too emotionally\noverwhelmed to turn off their feelings\nand thus will often be angry irritable\nand have frequent mood swings and temper\ntantrums\nthey might cry a lot more than they used\nto or start taking their frustrations\nout on those around them\neither way these are all clear signs of\nlingering psychological trauma\nso before you blame yourself\ntake some time to heal and understand\nfirst show yourself some compassion\nbefore you call yourself a bad person\ndo you relate to any of the things we've\nmentioned here if you still have some\nunhealed trauma that's hurting you\nplease don't hesitate to reach out to a\nmental healthcare professional today and\nget help\nyou can heal and it can get better\nwhat's your personal experience with\ntrauma and recovering from it talk about\nit in the comments below we love hearing\nyour stories i talk
