know how much\nyou've grown as a person?\nYou may not notice it, but you\nare developing continuously.\nYou probably aren't the\nsame you were a year ago\nand that's because of all the effort\nand patience you've given.\nIt doesn't matter if you're an artist,\na singer or someone who likes to work out.\nYou've been told time and time\nagain to trust the process.\nIt's a statement that's so easily said,\nbut so hardly followed.\nWhen you trust the process,\nyou are signing yourself\nup for consistency.\nYou're devoting time to\nyour craft and putting\nin all the work to become\nsomeone better than yesterday.\nAt times, frustration may take hold.\nYou could feel like you're at standstill.\nThat no matter what you do\nnothing changes or improves, but it is.\nYou are better and you are
