    "transcript": "do you believe in soulmates\nhaving a soul connection is more\npowerful than any kind of relationship\nwe can have\nif you share a spiritual bond with a\nfriend or partner the bond is likely to\nlast a lifetime and as your friendship\nblossoms you're drawn to one another and\nlearn from each other's experiences\nso\nhow will you know when you meet them\nthat they're special before we begin we\nwould like to say that there has been a\nhuge decline in mental health around the\nworld\nwhich is why we're so committed to\ncreating more content than we ever have\nstay tuned and thanks for being a part\nof our journey\nall right\nhere are six signs your soul is\nconnected to someone\nnumber one your conversations are easy\nand natural\nare most of your conversations awkward\nor boring\nmaybe your conversations lately haven't\nhad that spark that you're looking for\nwhen you have a sole connection with\nsomeone all of that can change\nconversations with your partner or\nfriend should flow easily and new topics\nshould come up naturally you'll find\nyourself wanting to talk to them more\neven if you're not one to frequently\nkeep up to chat in a group\nforced small doc and awkward silences\nwon't be a regular occurrence with them\nactually when you do run out of things\nto say those moments of silence will be\ncomfortable because you feel comfortable\nwith them\nnumber two your intuition is telling you\nthis is right\ndo you let your intuition guide you\nperhaps your instincts are kicking in\nwith this individual\nsomething just feels right and you know\nit deep down inside of you whether\nyou've known them for a while and want\nto grow in your relationship or you're\njust meeting them for the first time\nyour intuition is telling you you should\nmake a move\nwill you approach them\nnumber three it's as if you've known\neach other forever\nso you're falling into one of those\nnatural conversations we've discussed\nand everything just feels right\nyou can't help but think\nbut have we met before because it feels\nlike i've known you all my life\nmaybe in a past life or maybe there's\njust a deep connection between the two\nof you\nyou feel comfortable around them and\ntheir presence even feels familiar\nthis is a sign you may have a soul\nconnection whether as a friend or a\nlover they may just be destined to be a\ngreat addition to your life\nnumber four you both respect each other\nso you've been hanging out with this\nindividual for some time now and you've\nnoticed there's a great deal of respect\nbetween you both no one's trying to\nforce you to fit their standards and\nboth are looking out for each other's\nneeds in a respectful way\nyou should have and receive respect in\nall your relationships but this is\ndefinitely true for someone you connect\nwith spiritually\nyou're both equal partners in this\njourney you take together and you treat\neach other as such number five\nthere's a strong positive energy between\nyou both\nthings feel natural and comfortable\nbetween you two but you also often feel\nthis strong energy an electrical current\nrunning between you two this is another\nsign and should be a positive force you\nfeel you shouldn't feel afraid or\ninsecure when you're with them but\ninstead excited and drawn to them they\nshould also feel the same way about you\nand number six you share the same values\nand you encourage each other to grow\nhealthy relationships work when couples\nnot only trust and respect each other\nbut when they share the same life values\nas well\nthis goes for the important things in\nlife not the small indifferences and\nopinions every now and then\nif you both can agree on the important\nvalues of life then your relationship\nwill flourish\nyou should also encourage each other to\ngrow and not stay static you shouldn't\nhave to stay in the same place for\nsomeone you can both grow together in\nmany ways\npartners who not only encourage each\nother to grow but hold similar values in\nlife are perhaps destined to be grey\ncouples and if they have many of these\nsigns they may even be a spiritually\nconnected couple as well\nso do you have a sole connection with\nsomeone\nwho\nfeel free to share with us in the\ncomments down below we hope you enjoyed\nthis video and if you did don't forget\nto click the like button and share it\nwith a friend or someone who could use\nit subscribe to psyc2go and hit the\nnotification bell icon for more content\nlike this as always thanks for watching\nsee you next time"
