thoughtful outlook on life.\nSo, how do you know if\nyou are an old soul?\nWell, here at Psych2Go,\nwe've made a little quiz\nfor you to take to find out.\nKeep track of your answers\nand find out if

them well.\nNumber three, how good\nare you at helping others\nor providing advice?\nA, I give great advice and\nlove to help others when I can;\nB, I try my best to give advice,\nbut I like comforting more instead;\nor C, I'm terrible at advice,\nbut try to be there for my friends.\nNumber four.\nHow often do you eat or learn new things?\nA, I love to read and have\na thirst for knowledge;\nB, I read when I can,\nbut much prefer getting\nout and seeing friends;\nor C, I don't read much\nand love to go out and be around people.\nNumber five, how do you respond to others\nin a serious discussion?\nA, I like to observe,\nlisten, think, then react;\nB, I listen while thinking\nof how I can convince them\nthat I'm right about the topic;\nor C, I listen and respond\nquickly with my opinion.\nAnd finally, number six,\ndo you feel like an outsider?\nA,\nyes, all the time;\nB, sometimes, but not really;\nor C,\nno.\nSo, what do your answers mean?\nMostly Cs.\nDid you mostly answer C?\nWell, you are most likely not an old soul.\nYou're pretty opposite\nfrom them, actually.\nYou are more into material\nthings, unlike old souls.\nAnd you love going out\nrather than staying in with a good book,\nunlike most old souls.\nYou're very extroverted\nand love hanging around people your age.\nYou're not often hanging out\nwith people much older than you.\nMostly Bs.\nYou are not quite an old soul,\nbut you can be pretty wise at times.\nYou are not focused on material things,\nbut you do love to go\nshopping every now and then.\nWho doesn't?\nYou also don't mind hanging\nout with people of all ages.\nMostly As.\nYou are an old soul.\nYou value deep connections.\nSo instead of many acquaintances,\nyou likely have a few close friends\nthat you have deep connection with.\nYou're not very interested\nin material things.\nYou prefer the intangible things in life.\nYou love learning new things,\nexpanding your knowledge,\nand improving the relationships\nyou have in your life.\nYou make most of your choices\nwith your intentions at\nthe forefront of your mind.\nWhen you sit down to create a project\nor do work on a task you care about,\nyou're keeping the end goal in mind.\nAs an old soul, when\nyou respond to others,\nyou think before you react.\nThis is also because you're\na very observant person.\nBecause most of your choices\nhave strong intentions behind them,\nyou also don't like to waste time,\nand you often spend time alone, too,\nto reflect and think.\nYou don't mind time alone.\nAnd like an introvert,\nyou often need this time to recharge\nfrom time around people.\nThis is likely due to the idea\nthat you're also very\nempathetic, open-minded,\nand can often feel emotionally\ndrained because of this.\nYou enjoy spending some time\nalone to recharge, reflect,\ncontemplate, and daydream:\na few of the common signs of an old soul.\nSo have you been told that you're wise?\nDo your loved ones come to\nyou before others for advice?\nYep, you're pretty good when\nit comes to giving advice,\nand you've been called\nwise many times before.\nBecause of your maturity,\nyou may have a hard time\nfitting in with others\nin your age group,\nespecially if you are very young.\nYou get along with older\nindividuals much better\nbecause you can have a deeper\nconversation with them,\nand you love those.\nSmall talk isn't really your thing.\nYou also likely felt like an outsider\nat one point in your life.\nBut don't worry,\nbecause there are other\nold souls out there,\nand you'll likely get\nalong just fine with them\nbecause of how much you\ncan relate to each other,\nand because you'll probably have\nsome pretty deep conversations as well.\nWho doesn't love a good\ntheorizing session?\nSo, are you an old
