    "transcript": "[Music]\nif someone is arrogant and bossy you may\nthink that they're likely to be a\nnarcissist but what about someone who's\nreserved anxious and quiet\nthere's a difference between narcissism\nand narcissistic tendencies after all\njust because someone is arrogant and\nbossy doesn't necessarily mean they're a\nnarcissist and having these certain\npersonality traits does not constitute a\ndiagnosis\nbut narcissism actually comes in two\nforms overt narcissism and covert\nnarcissism at first glance you probably\nwouldn't even realize someone is a\ncovert narcissist because of how much\nmore reserved in nature they seem to be\nremember this video is not made to\nattack anyone who may display these\nsigns or anyone diagnosed with npd but\nrather to understand them and bring more\nawareness to the topic\nthis video is also not made to diagnose\nanyone with npd\nwith that said these are seven signs\nsomeone is secretly a narcissist\nnumber one they often act\npassive-aggressive do you know anyone\nmaybe a friend family member or\ncolleague who often acts\npassive-aggressively to manipulate\nothers and get what they want\na covert narcissist can't take no for an\nanswer but they also won't confront you\nabout it because they want to make you\nlook like the bad guy\nso instead they'll give you the cold\nshoulder tell you backhanded compliments\nor whisper snide remarks about you under\ntheir breath all the while insisting\nthat nothing is wrong and that they're\nnot mad at you covert narcissists have\nan unrealistic sense of entitlement and\nwant to demand special treatment from\nothers without actually asking for it\nnumber two they're easily envious of\nothers\nwhether we like to admit it or not the\ntruth is a lot of us struggle with\nfeelings of jealousy and envy towards\nothers but for most people this is\nbecause we can't help but compare\nourselves to those around us and feel\ndown when we don't think we measure up\nfor narcissists however their feelings\nof envy are excessive and rooted in the\nidea that they are superior to everyone\nelse so no one should ever outshine or\noutperform them\nthey resent other people for having the\nthings they feel that they deserve more\nlike wealth power success and popularity\nand because seeing others succeed gives\nthem feelings of inadequacy a narcissist\nwill often try to downplay the\naccomplishments of others\nnumber three they hold a lot of grudges\nnarcissists tend to hold a lot of\ngrudges against others because they hold\nthemselves in such high regard so anyone\nwho treats them with anything short of\nworship and unending praise is going to\nend up on their blacklist\nnow a narcissist might not say anything\nat the moment but they may already be\nseething with rage on the inside\n[Music]\nnumber four they are highly sensitive to\ncriticism\nremember what we said about narcissists\nhaving a superiority complex and holding\nthemselves at an unrealistically high\nregard\nwell another way this can manifest is by\nbeing overly sensitive to criticism\nespecially for introverted narcissists\nas introverts tend to internalize their\nfeelings more than extroverts\nand while there are a number of reasons\nwhy someone would be highly sensitive to\ncriticism such as being highly sensitive\nperson or struggling with low\nself-esteem or narcissists it's because\nany criticism can damage their perfect\nidealized view of themselves\nthey can't come to terms with the fact\nthat they have flaws and make mistakes\ntoo\nnumber five\nthey have false modesty narcissists need\nand desire lots of admiration from\nothers and covert narcissists might try\nto get this by putting on a false sense\nof modesty they put themselves down as a\nway of fishing for compliments and try\nto downplay their skills and successes\nin ways they don't really believe\nnumber six\nthey have self-serving empathy\na narcissist might seem like they're\nyour friend\ncomforting you when you're down and\ncheering you on when you're happy\nhowever narcissists are self-serving and\nmasters of emotional manipulation\nthey're only empathizing with you\nbecause they want others to see them as\nsomeone kind caring and compassionate\ntowards others for example they give\nmoney and food to the homeless only when\nthere is someone else there to admire\nthem doing it they don't really care\nabout other people except for what they\nthink of them and number seven\nthey think no one understands them\nlast but certainly not least\nplaying once again into their ideas of\nsuperiority and specialness covert\nnarcissists will often complain about no\none else being able to understand them\nand while you might feel bad for them at\nfirst what they really mean is that they\nsee everyone else as beneath them and\nstruggle with being so much better than\nthose around them they will often remark\nabout things like how they're so ahead\nof their time that no one else could\never appreciate their genius\nso did anyone in particular come to mind\ndo you think someone you know might be a\ncovert narcissist while we're definitely\nnot saying that any of the signs we've\ntalked about here like feeling jealous\nof other people feeling misunderstood or\nbeing sensitive to criticism\nautomatically make you a narcissist it's\nimportant to understand that narcissism\nis so much more complex than what it's\noften made out to be\nspotting a narcissist isn't always easy\nespecially when they're masquerading as\nsomeone who loves and cares about you\ndid
