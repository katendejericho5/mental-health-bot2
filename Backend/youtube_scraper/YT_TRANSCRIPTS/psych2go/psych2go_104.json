    "transcript": "our goal is to provide everyday life\nlearning that can enhance our mental\nwell-being your support by watching our\nvideos contributes to it so thank you\nthere's a beautiful quote from American\npoet Miko Javi that goes I think I get\nso scared because I'm greedy I want to\nhold on to everything the world wants to\ntake it away the number of hours we have\ntogether is actually not so large please\nlinger near the door uncomfortably\ninstead of just leaving please forget\nyour scarf in my life and come back\nlater for it these poignant lines\nresonate with a deep-seated fear that\noften dwells within us the loneliness\nthat comes with the certainty of goodbye\nand the apprehension of never knowing\nwhen as ancient Greek philosopher epic\ntetus realized all those thousands of\nyears before our attachments are what\nmake it so hard to accept change but\nlife is in a constant state of change to\nfear loss and resent change is to\nwrongly assume that you can go against\nthe natural Order of Things epictetus's\nwise words are echoed in the teachings\nof stoicism which invites us to view\nseparation and change through a gentler\nlens with that said let's explore the\ninsights that allow us to embrace the\nbeauty of both the presence and absence\nof human connection rethinking farewells\nthe first and perhaps most important\nprinciple of stoic philosophy is the\nacceptance of impermanence in this\nconstantly changing World refusing to\nlet go is surely going to bring an ache\nto our hearts but this perspective\nsoothes the soul because it reminds us\nthat the impermanent nature of Our Lives\nis part of what makes it so precious we\nwe can find something to be grateful for\neven in farewells the stoics advise us\nto acknowledge that people like all\naspects of Life are subject to change\nand eventually parting ways is a natural\npart of The Human Experience the\ntreasures of shared moments with this in\nmind let us begin to consider each\nencounter as a gift of time borrowed is\nthere someone in particular you're\nhaving trouble letting go of maybe you\njust recently went through a breakup or\na falling out with a friend while their\nloss may hurt you now an important part\nof the healing process is recognizing\nall the ways they contributed to your\nlife so make a list of all the wonderful\nmemories you shared with them and all\nthe reasons why you're thankful for them\nthis gratitude can help us find meaning\nand fulfillment even when someone leaves\nour life navigating The Winds of Change\nas seasons change so do the roles people\nplay in our lives some arrive as the\nsunshine of Joy others as the storm of\nchallenge but just as the wind carries\nleaves in various directions life guides\neach person down their own path that's\nwhy the stoics emphasized focusing on\nourselves and what's within our control\nnot on others Letting Go gracefully\nallows both of you to pursue your own\nJourneys in life so whatever grudges you\nmay feel against this person for leaving\nacknowledge them and let them go hold\nthe door open for them and thank them\nfor stopping by in your\nlife new hellos and Beginnings sometimes\nwhen we've been hurt by The Bitter sting\nof goodbye we become closed off and\nhesitant to let new people into our\nlives but remember you don't lose people\nyou return them people aren't ours to\nown and whatever time we have with each\nother is always borrowed so when the\ntime comes for us to go our separate\nways take comfort in the fact that life\nis constantly moving forward and so\nshould you the end of one chapter is the\nbeginning of another Embrace new\nconnections because every new hello is a\npromise of hope and a reminder that our\nhearts have endless capacity for\nconnection returning to ourselves the\nirony of life is that the more you try\nto control something the more it\ncontrols you so don't be afraid of\nlosing people be afraid of losing\nyourself and trying so hard to hold on\nto those who are already gone when\ndealing with the loss of relationships\nstoicism encourages individuals to\nprioritize virtue and their own\ncharacter development this means\ncherishing the time spent with loved\nones and using those relationships as\nopportunities for personal growth\nrealize that the person you lost didn't\nmake you feel the love you felt but that\nit came from you any love they made you\nfeel is yours to keep because you\ncreated that love and you made them the\ncenter of it so when they're going when\nit's time to return them bring that love\nback within\nyourself so psychor as we draw this\njourney to a close let us hold the truth\nin our hearts that the bonds we Forge\naren't lost or broken but rather we\nreturn our borrowed time with others and\nreceive in return memories lessons and\nimprints in our hearts let us know your\npersonal insights in the comments down\nbelow and don't forget to like this\nvideo If it emotionally
