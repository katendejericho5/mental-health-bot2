    "transcript": "[Music]\nhey psych-goers\nhave you been missing some company\nlately\nor do you feel isolated and left out\ndespite being surrounded by people you\ncare about do you still feel lonely and\nempty\nloneliness is not always obvious and\nsometimes it may feel like a weakness\nyou may try to make yourself believe you\ndon't really need anybody especially if\nyou've been alone for a long time\nbut we all need at least some kind of\nwarmth from the ones around us\nif you noticed you've been feeling down\nlately check out these six signs to see\nif you're secretly lonely\nnumber one you're often bored\ndo you often feel bored with nothing to\ndo and no one to hang out with\nhumans are social beings our brains are\nwired for social connection we need\npeople to talk to you have fun and spend\nquality time with people who give us\nemotional support and connection and\nmake our days more fun\nbut if you don't have many friends or if\nyou're not close with the ones you have\nyou may start feeling bored you spend\nyour days alone doing activities alone\neating alone just scrolling through your\nphone mindlessly\nin this case the boredom you feel could\nactually mean you're feeling lonely\nnumber two\nyou're jealous of others having fun\nhow do you feel when you see a group of\nfriends hanging out outside or when you\nsee all those pictures on social media\nof people having fun\nare you indifferent or does it make you\nfeel a tiny bit jealous\nif yes you should know that's totally\nfine if you're feeling lonely and left\nout it's normal that you wish you could\nspend time with others rather than being\nalone and even if they don't talk about\nit many others feel the same way number\nthree you're taking long showers or\nbaths\nthis may sound kind of weird because who\ndoesn't love a nice warm shower or\nbubble bath after a long day\nbut if a nice stream of hot water brings\nyou comfort that you can't find outside\nit could be a sign of loneliness a study\npublished in 2012 in the journal of\nmotion found that the lonelier a person\nis the more showers and baths they take\nthe hotter the water and the longer they\nstay under the water researchers believe\nthat the physical warmth that you feel\nfrom hot water may actually be a\nsubstitute for social warmth that you're\nlacking\nbut this finding can be used to your\nadvantage when there are no friends\naround maybe you can feel a bit better\nwith a nice cup of hot chocolate\nnumber four you have no one to turn to\nimagine this you had a long bad day you\nfinally get home but your mind is still\nracing you're feeling overwhelmed and\nwant to get it off your chest you take\nout your phone to call or text someone\nwho do you call\nif you're having trouble answering on\ntop of feeling stressed you might be\nlonely too\nloneliness is not just about not having\nany friends it's about not having a\nclose friend\nyou can talk about work or school with\nyour colleagues or to chat about the\nweather with your neighbor but it's also\nimportant to have someone to turn to who\ncan help you when you're feeling down\nnot having someone like that in your\nlife can make you feel lonely\nnumber five over sharing when someone's\nwilling to listen\nanother sign of loneliness could be over\nsharing\ndo you talk quickly when you're having a\nconversation do you talk in great detail\nsharing lots of personal stuff that you\nmight feel bad afterwards for saying\nthe reason is simple if you're lonely\nyou probably don't talk much or at all\nyou're left with all your thoughts and\nideas and emotions but there's no one to\nlisten\nso when you finally find someone to have\na conversation with you have so much to\nsay so much to make up for that it just\ncomes out at once\nand number six you keep buying and\nhoarding stuff\nwhen we're little we find comfort in our\nblankies and teddy bears\nthey give us a sense of security but as\nwe grow older we learn to turn to people\nrather than stuffed animals that is if\nwe don't feel lonely if you are lonely\nyou may find yourself compulsively\nbuying or hoarding items you don't\nreally need such as clothes ornaments\nand jewelry that can become a substitute\nfor the company you're lacking\nyou feel like you don't have people to\nmake you happy so use the happiness and\nmaterial things and become emotionally\nattached to those items\naccording to a recent 2020 study\nloneliness hoarding and object\nattachment are all associated with one\nanother\nbeing attached to material objects might\nactually be an attempt to compensate for\nthe loneliness you feel\nif you're feeling lonely know that there\nare some small steps you can take to try\nand help feel less lonely\nthe first is talking to someone and\nsharing your feelings\nthis can be a mental health professional\nif you don't feel like opening up to\nsomeone else in your life\nyou could also try engaging with others\nmaybe by volunteering joining a sports\nclub or enrolling in language or art\nclasses\nlastly take care of your body\nsince the body and mind are connected\ndrink enough water get some sunlight and\nexercise as much as you can can you\nrelate to any of these points\nif so let us know in the comments and\nshare this video with others who you\nthink it might help the studies and\nreferences used are in the description\nbelow\nuntil next time friends and thanks for\nwatching we'll see you next time"
