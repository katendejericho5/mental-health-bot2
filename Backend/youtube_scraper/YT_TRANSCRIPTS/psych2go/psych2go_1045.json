    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Are you an introvert?\nHave you ever wondered\nwhat an introvert would like\nto hear once in a while?\nJust like any other person,\nintroverts need to hear\nencouraging words once in a while,\nmaybe even more so,\nbecause we tend to be a bit\nmore sensitive than others.\nIf you're wondering\nhow to make your introverted\nfamily member or friend's day,\nkeep watching.\nWithout further ado,\nhere are nine things that\nintroverts would like to hear.\nNumber one, words of appreciation.\nDue to their introversion,\nintroverts tend to look for ways\nto get things done behind the scenes\nso as not to get the\nspotlight shone on them.\nUnfortunately, that leads\nto much of their work\nor achievements going\nunnoticed and unappreciated.\nThis becomes a pattern\nfor everything they do,\nincluding when helping friends or family.\nThe help they give goes unnoticed\nor begins to be expected.\nThere comes a time when\nintroverts feel invisible.\nA few words of appreciation\ncan light up an introvert's world,\nbecause it makes them feel seen\nand like their effort was not wasted.\nIt also makes them feel\nlike they are actually\ndoing something good,\ninstead of just not being sure,\ndue to not getting any type of feedback.\nNumber two, \"Are you OK?\"\nIntroverts don't generally get\nasked if they're all right,\ndue to their quietness and stillness.\nThis stillness is often seen\nby others as something good,\nbecause they think that being\nstill means being at peace.\nThis is not always the case.\nSo when someone asks an\nintrovert how they are,\nit truly makes their day.\nThis act also lets the introvert know\nthat someone is actively\nlooking out for them and cares.\nThe silence and sometimes\nstand-offish way of the introverts\nmeans that not many people approach them,\nand they feel alone.\nSomeone asking if they're\nall right lets them know\nthat there are people that can\naccept them for who they are\nand care about them.\nNumber three, compliment\nthe way they think.\nIntroverts think a lot, often\nto the point of overthinking.\nThis happens because of observation\nand wanting to do the right thing\non the part of the introvert.\nIntroverts are observers,\nand they spend vast amounts\nof time absorbing information\non the conscious and unconscious levels.\nThis enables them to accurately\nknow things about others,\neven though they rarely say anything.\nAll the information they absorb\nis then analyzed in\nseveral different ways,\nmainly to see it through\ndifferent perspectives.\nIt is very satisfying\nwhen someone acknowledges\nthe mental and emotional work\nthat introverts put into their thoughts.\nNumber four, \"I love the way you are.\"\nYou can always see other\npeople being praised\nfor their extroverted personalities.\nIf you're an introvert,\nit is very rare that people take the time\nto get to know you.\nWhat is most valued in today's society\nis the outward qualities\na person can demonstrate.\nFor us introverts, this makes\nus feel like an outcast,\nand like we need to change\nin order to develop the connections\nthat we see others have.\nBeing praised for being the way we are\nlets us know that there is\nabsolutely nothing wrong\nwith being an introvert,\nand that we don't have to\nchange if we don't want to,\nwhich is a big relief for us.\nNumber five, \"Thank you for your insight.\"\nAs thinkers, introverts\nwork very hard to analyze,\nprocess, learn,\nand put themselves in someone else's shoes\nin order to help solve problems,\nbut because what is normally\nconsidered as hard work\nis usually physical labor\nor something that others\ncan see from the outside,\nthis kind of hard work\nof the mind and emotions\nis often overlooked or criticized.\nThey can also be shut down and laughed at\nbecause people do not understand them,\nor they for some reason get triggered.\nWhen someone compliments\nor thanks introverts\nfor their advice and insights,\nit helps them feel like\nthey did something right,\nand that they are actually helping people.\nIt also makes them feel\nunderstood, at least on some level.\nIf you thank an into\nintrovert for their insight,\nit is guaranteed to make their day.\nNumber six, \"I feel so\ncomfortable around you.\"\nIntroverts love being told\nhow comfortable and peaceful\nothers feel around them.\nThey feel good providing that space\nwhere people can just be\nthemselves without expectations.\nIt is not something that\nis given much by society,\nbecause it always wants people to fulfill\ncertain predetermined roles,\nbut that can be toxic on many levels.\nPlus, if they feel peace, it\nmeans that they are healing,\nand that the introvert is\na part of that healing.\nIn a society where\neverything is fast-paced\nand there is little to no rest,\nit is easy to be run down and wounded.\nIt's not easy to heal from all of that.\nFor many, it is an honor to know\nthat they are providing\na safe place for others\nto get away from their\ntumultuous day-to-day and heal.\nNumber seven, \"You were or are right.\"\nIntroverts with their constant thoughts\nare often able to see\nthings before others.\nHowever, when they express these ideas,\nthey are some times ignored or shunned.\nThen when those\npossibilities do come true,\nthey either get people mad\nat us, ignore us completely,\nor they just can't find\nthe courage to tell them,\n\"I told you.\"\nThis kind of treatment\nmakes many introverts\nkeep things to themselves\nin order to protect\nthemselves from backlash.\nWhen you acknowledge with\nsincerity and a good heart\nthat they were right all along,\nit helps them realize\nthat not everyone will react negatively\nto what they have to say.\nNumber eight, \"You can\ngo whenever you'd like.\"\nOne thing introverts\nhate is going somewhere\nwith no way of getting out of it\nonce they get drained or over-stimulated.\nA lot of people don't understand\nthat introverts don't thrive\nor get energy from other people.\nInstead, they're more\nlikely to be drained.\nTo have someone that says\nthey can go back home\nwhenever they like\nmakes them feel seen and loved as well.\nNumber nine, \"I'm here for you.\"\nIntroverts are very good\nat being there for others\nall the time,\nbut not very good at being\nthere for themselves,\nnor are they good at letting\nother people in to help them.\nHearing for the first time\nthat someone is there for them\nwhenever they need\ndoes take a lot of weight\noff their shoulders,\nand reminds them\nthat they don't have\nto do everything alone.\nThese are just a few\nthings that introverts\nwould like to hear once in a while.\nWhat did you think?\nDo you relate to any of these?\nLet us know
