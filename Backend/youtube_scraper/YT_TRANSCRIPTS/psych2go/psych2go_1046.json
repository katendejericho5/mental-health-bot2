    "transcript": "hey sectagors\ndid you know it's possible to have two\ndifferent mental health conditions at\nthe same time\nin psychology this is called comorbidity\nsome pairings are more common than\nothers\nbut this does not make them any easier\nto handle\none such pairing is the anxiety and\ndepression combo\nanxiety and depression are two disorders\nthat are totally contradictory on the\nsurface\ndepression is typically characterized by\na lack of motivation and an overall sad\nfeeling on the other hand anxiety is\nconstantly worrying and feeling on edge\nthese are the two most commonly\ndiagnosed psychiatric conditions while\ndifferent these can overlap making it\nhard to treat one disorder by itself\nto better look at the similarities\nbetween the two conditions here are five\nsigns of anxious depression\nnumber one you've been diagnosed with\neither depression or anxiety depression\nand anxiety have a high comorbidity rate\nmeaning nearly half of those diagnosed\nwith either depression or anxiety likely\nhave the other condition as well\ntherefore being able to diagnose and\ntreat both conditions is crucial for\nyour well-being\nnumber two you feel apathetic but also\non edge\ndo you feel that nothing matters and\nfind it hard to care about things you\nonce enjoyed but at the same time you\nfind yourself caring intensely about\nsomething with little consequence\nas depression and anxiety are different\nthey tend to foster contradicting\nfeelings it's a pendulum vibrating on\nboth extremes\nwith these feelings you find yourself\nconstantly switching between totally\nopposite modes of thinking\nnumber three\nyou're tired in the day but restless at\nnight\ntiredness is typically a depressive\nsymptom whereas anxiety is associated\nwith restlessness\nthese two symptoms tend to act up during\nall the wrong times\nduring the day you might feel that\nyou're unable to accomplish anything\ndue to a lack of energy while at night\nyou find you can't sleep as your mind is\nspinning with all sorts of worries such\nas the tasks left unaccomplished\nthis makes sleeping extremely difficult\nleading to other problems later on\nnumber four you're constantly exhausted\nbut in a loop\nwhen you're in a constant cycle of\ndepression and anxiety it can be hard to\nfocus on anything else much of you is\nconsumed catering to the demands of each\ncondition\nas both are draining you may find that\nyou lose yourself to your condition and\nhave little energy to spare\nthis loop is especially disruptive to\nliving a normal life which makes seeking\nhelp\nsuch a huge priority number five\nyou're at war with yourself\ndepression and anxiety can fight with\neach other completely disrupting your\ninner peace not only are they a struggle\nthemselves but they also struggle with\neach other vying for your attention\nyou may find it impossible to enjoy\nyourself as you struggle with either a\ndepressive or anxious mindset with\nlittle rest in between\nyou care too much about some things and\ntoo little about others you may also\nfind yourself completely lost without\nknowing how to cope with your feelings\nwhile depression and anxiety are\nseemingly contradictory conditions it is\npossible to have them both at the same\ntime\nhaving both conditions together can make\ntreatment much harder than the single\ncondition by itself but no matter how\nbad it gets there's always hope that\nthings can get better getting in touch\nwith the right mental health\nprofessional is a great first step to\ngetting back on track and i say that\nfrom personal experience\ndepression and anxiety are very real and\nvery serious mental illnesses but you\ndon't have to fight all on your own\nwhat are your thoughts on anxious\ndepression\nare there any more signs leave a comment\ndown below about your encounters with\nthem if you'd like if you found this\nvideo helpful be sure to hit the like\nbutton and share it with others don't\nforget to subscribe to psyc2go and hit\nthe notification bell for more new\nvideos thanks for watching"
