    "transcript": "hey sick to goers busy busy busy this\nexpression of having no time being a\nworkaholic and being constantly busy has\nbecome almost a bragging point which is\nmost definitely not healthy\nunfortunately so many of us have bought\ninto this mindset that we regularly\noverdraw on our energy banks and have\nbecome numb to the internal signs\ntelling us to relax\nif you don't pay attention you may set\nyourself on the quick path to burnout\nprevention of this involves keeping\nstress levels in check\nwhile there are certainly obvious signs\nof stress it's important to recognize\nlesser-known signs that hide themselves\nas other unrelated symptoms let's look\nat these hidden signs of stress\nnumber one you're constantly tired yet\ncan't sleep this is the most prominent\nof the hidden signs if stress has you\nfeeling constantly exhausted there's a\ngood chance your mind won't switch off\nto let you get a good night's sleep\nwhich is one of the most important\nthings needed to recharge to enable\ntackling the next day if you are not\naware that extreme fatigue actually\nblocks you from falling asleep at night\nyou end up staying awake even longer\ncreating a never ending cycle number two\nyou're sick all the time\nstress affects your immune system\nchronic stress weakens it leaving your\nbody unable to protect itself from\nillness\nso if you find yourself constantly sick\njumping from cough to cold to other\nillnesses and there's no obvious reason\nfor it it might be stress\nnumber three you can't remember things\nas well as you used to\nif you're finding trouble recalling that\nthing someone just told you yesterday or\ncan't remember what snack you had a few\nhours ago and this is super weird for\nyou it could be due to stress\nwhen stressed your brain malfunctions\nincluding the part that manages\nshort-term memory even though long-term\nmemory remains intact under chronic\nstress prolonged exposure will affect\nyour reasoning skills and problem\nsolving if left unaddressed\nnumber four your anger and frustration\nare always out of control\noverwhelming stress commonly allows for\nintense feelings of anger or frustration\nto rush forth like a torrent with little\nto no warning\nthis rush is often disproportionate to\nthis situation\nlike when you're asked to do something\nthat you've been putting off and you\nsuddenly feel like snapping\nfeeling this massive swell of anger and\nfrustration can be jarring\nwhat you can do is take a step back\nyou'll likely find that you're not\nreally that angry at a particular person\nbut more the situation as a whole so you\ncan now break it down into smaller more\nmanageable bits\nnumber five you experience discomfort\nwhile sitting still for too long\nyou may not be aware but other than the\ngun show in your arms or the grapefruit\ncalves in your socks there are numerous\nsmaller muscles that help you stabilize\nthose are the ones that hurt after using\nfree weights and you say i hurt in\nplaces i didn't know i had\nknow what stress does it makes all of\nthe muscles tense that means they're now\ntight they're not all happy flexy and\nbendy so you're no longer sitting in a\nnice pliable cushion of your body it's\nmore like a slightly flexible rock\ndoes that sound uncomfortable\nyou bet it is\ndo you unconsciously adopt positions\nlike a hunched back or crossed legs to\nprovide some comfort yeah you likely do\ni do too but neither of these positions\nare very good for our bodies and will\nhave detrimental long-term effects so\ndon't forget to take regular breaks even\nif they're short to unpretzel number six\nyou feel your heart racing all the time\nour base drive like all living things is\nto survive\nlike a deer escaping a predator our\nbodies too have developed a survival\nmechanism to impending danger\nthe fight or flight response just like\nit says on the tin this reflex readies\nyour body to rumble or to get the heck\nout of dodge\nthe downside is that stress is read by\nthe body as danger and all those come at\nme bro responses kick in including\nmaking your heart beat faster to supply\nthe muscles with more blood this means\nyou could be sitting still at your desk\nlooking at a monitor yet your heart is\nrunning like a caffeine-fueled hamster\non a wheel\nexhausting number seven\nyou really want that junk food now\nmmm cookies ooh chips\ni would kill for some ice cream\nif you're having frequent cravings for\njunk food like this this could well be a\nsign that something isn't quite right\nit could be the result of stress this is\nrelated to the fight or flight response\nmentioned before your body essentially\nsays in short term this is not the time\nto think about eating run away run away\nso it shuts down normal or regular\nappetite and produces cortisol the\nstress hormone this response also tells\nyour system that there is intense energy\nconsumption required so now your body\nthinks it absolutely requires sugars and\nfats basically fast fuel\nfor those muscles you need to throw down\nor run away from the predator the result\nis you're generally hungry because\nstress interrupted your normal eating\nhabits and there's an internal alarm\nsaying you need junk food to live and\nthe next thing you know you're reaching\nfor the bag of chips or fries tipped in\nice cream number eight you have a huge\ndrop in motivation for tasks\nthis is where procrastination hits an\nall-time high and you find yourself\nputting off all must do tasks like\nchores around the house work\nresponsibilities or even getting\ngroceries as you can imagine the result\nisn't pretty\nif this lack of motivation becomes\nchronic the piled up dishes unfinished\nwork tasks and empty fridge will just\nadd more stress causing burnout\nnumber nine\nfocus what focus and what were you\ntalking about again\ntaking little breaks is important\nwhen you force yourself to the grind for\nan extended time without a breather you\noverwhelm your brain\nthe sponge can't take anymore other\nstuff gets squeezed out like remembering\nwhere you put your keys and incoming\ninformation starts to look like some\nnebulous blob you'll find you have\ntrouble staying focused when attempting\nhigher levels of thought activities like\nreading or driving\nand number 10\nfrequent headaches\nharkening back 2.5 your muscles get\ntense that includes the muscles in the\nhead neck and shoulders which leads to\ntension headaches this tension may lead\nto blood vessel inflammation which is\nwhere the dreaded migraine shows up\nnow now don't stress one or two of these\nsymptoms could easily be caused by other\nthings altogether take a closer look if\nyou find yourself nodding and\nrecognizing many of them though\nthen you may want to consult your\nfriendly neighborhood healthcare\nprofessional\nchronic stress is a dangerous thing\nespecially when the signs are\ninconspicuous continuing to wear down\nyour mental physical and emotional\nhealth if left untreated\nso please take those breaks in order to\nrecharge your batteries so you can best\nmanage whatever challenges come up a\nhealthy you is a stronger you thanks for\nwatching see you soon"
