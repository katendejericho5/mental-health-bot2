    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers.\nBeing in a relationship could be\none of the most fulfilling\nexperiences to have,\nespecially when both\npartners are committed,\nwhile also prioritizing\ntheir individual needs.\nHowever, a relationship that consists\nof one or both partners using\nthe relationship as a way\nto validate their own self-worth\nis considered a codependent relationship,\nnot a healthy one.\nCodependency can be tricky to identify,\nespecially when you or your\npartner are so entrenched\nthat it's difficult to tell\nwhat is helpful from detrimental.\nTo help you recognize the difference,\nhere are five common signs\nthat you might be in a\ncodependent relationship\ninstead of a healthy one.\nNumber one, no responsibility\nfor personal feelings.\nWhile it's inevitable\nthat hurt feelings occur\nthroughout a relationship,\nhow conflicts are\nresolved can be different\nacross the board, depending on how healthy\na relationship is.\nIn a healthy relationship,\nboth parties understand and accept\nthat they're responsible\nfor their own feelings\nand responses to said feelings.\nBlaming and forcing\nultimatums upon the other\nto change is not a good\nway to deal with conflict.\nYou may be in a codependent\nrelationship if either partner\nrequires constant reassurance, validation,\nor approval from the other.\nTake it as a sign of codependency,\nIf you or your partner are unable to feel\nself-worth on your own.\nNumber two, unbalanced\ngiving at personal expense.\nTraits like compassion,\npatience, and generosity\nare all surefire signs of\nan amazing romantic partner.\nHowever, it's not uncommon\nfor people who have warm\nand thoughtful characteristics\nto unknowingly find themselves\nin codependent relationships.\nPartners who continue\nsacrificing their own needs\nfor the needs of their\npartner tend to be prideful\nfor living up to their ideals\nof being a compassionate,\npatient, and generous partner,\nwhile at the same time,\nfeeling depleted, dissatisfied\nwith the relationship,\nand taken for granted by their partner.\nThe need to be constantly\nprioritizing their partner's needs\ncan be mentally and emotionally toxic.\nIf you or your partner fall into habits\nof pleasing the other at your own expense,\nfind ways to communicate with one another\nto reach solutions that\ncould benefit both sides.\nYou deserve to receive as much\nas you're willing to give.\nNumber three, boundaries are blurred.\nDo you find it hard to\nsay no to your partner?\nOr do you feel responsible for their\nmental and emotional health\nat the detriment of your own?\nIf your answer to either\nof these questions is yes\nit's possible that you might be\nin a codependent relationship.\nIt can be hard to define where\nyour boundary lines are drawn\nwhen you bind yourself\nemotionally to another.\nA healthy relationship\ncalls for strong boundaries,\neven if that means saying\nno, to the one you love.\nWhile a codependent relationship\nenables both partners\ninto deeper unhealthy patterns\nwhen neither are willing\nto stand their ground.\nThough, it might be difficult,\nboundaries have the potential\nto strengthen a relationship\ninstead of weakening it\nas someone with codependency\nbelieves, might assume.\nNumber four, not thinking for oneself.\nA healthy relationship often\ncreates a blending effect\nfor the individuals involved.\nIt's normal for partners to\nbegin behaving, thinking,\nand even looking similarly,\neven so, this can be a\nred flag to look out for\nwhen it comes to\ncodependent relationships.\nNotice if you or your partner begin\nparroting one another's\nthoughts or perspectives.\nWhile it can seem harmless to agree 100%\nwith everything your partner thinks,\nthis pattern can potentially\nlead towards an eventual,\nharmful belief that someone\nelse will always know\nbetter than you, or worse,\nthat they know what's best\nfor you as an individual.\nOne way to grow out of this behavior\nis to consider your partner's thoughts\nagainst your personal\nbeliefs and perspectives.\nTry to stay true to yourself.\nIt will add to your level\nof independence and self assurance.\nNumber five, losing sense of self.\nMost dangerously of all,\na codependent relationship may cause\na loss of sense of self.\nPeople who fall into codependent\nrelationships often do so\nwithout realizing that\nthey're looking for someone\nto validate their identity,\nbut in their search\nthey may have sacrificed\ntoo much of themselves.\nTo combat this from happening,\nbe sure to prioritize both your needs\nalongside your partner's and never feel\nthat being in a happy and\nfulfilling relationship\nrequires you to sacrifice\nyour individualism.\nThe difference between\nsacrifice and compromise\nis considering yourself.\nTo think of and consider\nthe wellbeing or benefit\nof one self while doing\nthe same for another.\nMaintain connections to\nthose who supported you\neven before your relationship began.\nContinue nurturing the hobbies or interest\nyou had before your\npartner entered your life,\nand find new ones to\nenjoy together or alone.\nDo you relate to any of these signs?\nNot all forms of dependency are negative.\nWhile codependent relationships\nare unhealthy and detrimental.\nIt's possible to build a relationship\non the principles of\ninterdependence, instead.\nInterdependence calls for both partners\nto approach the relationship\nwith a balanced sense of self,\nto support one another towards\nbecoming their best selves\nin both the relationship,\nand individual lives.\nDid you find this video insightful?\nIf so, don't forget to\nleave a like and a comment\nabout your own experiences.\nShare this video with a friend,\nif you think it'll help them too.\nAs usual, all references\nused are in the description.\nThat's it for now."
