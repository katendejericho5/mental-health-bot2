    "transcript": "- [Narrator] There's been a\nhuge decline in mental health\naround the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks for being a part of our journey.\nHey there, welcome to\nthe world of personality.\nSure, having above average looks is great,\nbut as we mature, grow wiser,\nand get to know more people,\nwe realize that personality has a massive,\nlonger lasting impact on our lives\nthan those perfect eyebrows.\nSo what is it about a golden personality\nthat makes it sparkle?\nHere are a few signs you're attractive\nand have a beautiful personality.\nNumber one, your success\nextends beyond pure work.\nAccording to a 2008 study,\nindividuals with more\npositive personality traits\nare more likely to be successful\nin areas relating to economics.\nPeople who know how to keep a good balance\nof giving and taking\nin all kinds of\nrelationships and activities,\nfrom friends, to hobbies, to partners,\nwill be better able to\ndo well in all of them.\nThis success might be\ndue to your personality\nand good work ethic, of course.\nNumber two, you're nice to the waiter.\nNo, we don't literally mean\njust the restaurant employee,\nalthough they definitely count.\nWe're asking, although\nyou're warm and friendly\nwith your squad,\nhow are you with strangers\nor someone new to a group?\nAttractive personalities are\ncomfortable and welcoming.\nSo they're the ones\nwho will give a positive acknowledgement\nwhen someone says hello,\nwhether they're a good friend or not.\nThey'll make a point of not\nexcluding the new person,\nand they don't contact people\nonly when they need a favor.\nNumber three, you are commonly courteous.\nOkay, this reminds us of\nthe stuff we were taught\nor should have been taught as kids,\nlike saying please and thank you,\nand not taking things that aren't ours.\nCommon courtesy or basic manners\nshows that you have a\ngeneral respect for others\nand respect for societal norms.\nPeople trust that you are\nunlikely to steal the silverware\nor be a jerk in a social situation,\nbecause that would be awfully rude.\nNumber four, you show\ngratitude and appreciation.\nHand in hand with courtesy,\nshowing appreciation and gratitude\nwhen something is done for you\nis a definite must for an\nattractive personality.\nIt shows that you aren't self-entitled\nand that you understand\nrelationships aren't material commodities.\nHint, time is precious,\nso someone spending time with you\nis also something to be grateful for.\nNumber five, you have good\nconversational skills.\nThis is where the conversation\nis going so strong\nthat no one realizes it's nighttime\nuntil someone says, \"I can't see.\"\nA good conversationalist\ncan keep it rolling\nbecause they're able to get others\nto open up to contribute too.\nThis means no one is feeling disengaged\nand they feel wanted.\nNothing dies because the\ninspiration is alive and well.\nIf in person, this can be\nadded to by body language\nthat shows interest in\nwhat the person is saying,\nlike facing towards someone\nand having eye contact.\nNumber six, you're also a good listener.\nThis also applies to text and chat.\nBeing a good listener\nmeans you respond to their whole message\nand not just pick out the bits\nthat directly speak to your interests.\nThis shows that you\nacknowledge, value, and care\nabout the other person as an equal.\nSo if you're steamed about\na difficult situation\nand your friend says something like,\n\"Didn't that manager\nhave some health issues?\nI still think they're\ntreating you unfairly.\"\nThe response should\ninclude some reflection\non whether there were some\nhealth issues at play,\nnot just piling on about\nhow unfair the manager was.\nNumber seven, drama llamas?\nNot on this flight.\nWe prefer our drama to\nstay on Netflix or Hulu.\nThat is to say in\nHollywood land, thank you.\nSure, it plays well on screen,\nbut in real life,\nto have the drama llama crash\nyour group is not so great.\nIt's draining, and often\ncauses unnecessary clashes,\nfights, and discord.\nThe attractive personality\ndoesn't leave everyone\nfeeling drained, hurt, or betrayed.\nIt brings people together,\nnot rip them apart.\nNumber eight, you're open-minded.\nSure, you still have your boundaries.\nThis is about balance,\nand not letting those boundaries\nbecome solitary confinement barricades.\nWhen we're told we're wrong,\nwe reflexively feel defensive,\nespecially if we're told our\nopinion or emotion is wrong.\nHaving an attractive personality\ndoesn't mean that you\ndon't feel those things.\nIt does mean that you're aware\nof both how to give\nand receive information\nwith minimal assumption.\nSo if you share a song\nwith someone and they say,\n\"I'm not sure about this kind of music,\"\ndo you automatically scold them\ntelling them that they\nneed to be more open-minded\nor do you consider they're simply saying\nthey really aren't sure?\nSo you ask them about\ntheir indecisiveness,\nlearning about their point of view.\nIf you were on the other side of this,\nwould you tell the song\nsharer you hated it,\nthat you were unsure,\nor give your answer context\nwith an explanation?\nNumber nine, you are authentic\nand 100% you, be yourself.\nThis doesn't mean being static,\nforcing others to your opinion,\nor never changing your mind,\nunless that's truly the choice you'd make.\nAuthenticity is the\nability to still be you\ndespite receiving new information\nand expanding your knowledge.\nThe water in the teapot may\nbe the shape of the teapot\nbut it's still water.\nWhen you're authentic,\npeople know that they're\ngetting to know you,\nnot some made up mask.\nThis means they feel they\nknow who they're trusting\nand can open up.\nBeing able to safely open up\nto someone is super attractive.\nAs our values deepen,\nwe realize that there is\nso much more to a person\nthan what a selfie can show.\nWe find ourselves making different choices\nin who we spend time with.\nUnderstanding that it's a finite resource.\nThe biggest assessment tool\nfor that is personality.\nWhich traits have you seen?\nHow much do you agree or\ndisagree with these points?\nWhich nuances would you add?\nWe are always working\non being more attractive\nto all of you,\nand hey, tapping that\nLike button would help.\nThanks for watching and see you soon."
