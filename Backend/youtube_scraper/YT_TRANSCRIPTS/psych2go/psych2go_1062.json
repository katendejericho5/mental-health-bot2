    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhen you think of someone\nwho is mentally strong,\nwhat traits come to mind?\nCalm, cool, and collected?\nAlways put together?\nWell, these are ideal traits\nthat are often present.\nIt isn't that black and white\nand there's a lot happening\nbehind the scenes.\nIn order to understand\nwhat mental strength is,\nit would be helpful to\nlearn what it isn't.\nHere are eight things mentally\nstrong people don't do.\nNumber one, they don't\nbottle their emotions.\nAccording to Psychologist Leon Seltzer,\nhiding emotional pain\ncomes from a place of fear.\nWe may fear judgment,\nridicule, or social rejection,\nbut choosing to hide your emotions\nmay lead to strong, unresolved feelings\nwith lasting effects.\nFear and mental strength\nhave a complex relationship.\nPeople who are mentally\nstrong work at acknowledging,\naccepting, and navigating\nthrough their fear.\nThey try not to let it\nget in the way of life.\nNumber two, they don't live in the past.\nWhether they're big or small,\nregrets don't escape anyone\nand being remorseful is a good thing\nas it allows us to correct our actions.\nThinking about the past in\na healthy, productive way\nallows us to grow into our best selves.\nBut when that thinking\nturns into rumination,\nit's easy to get consumed by them.\nFor people that are mentally strong,\nthey work at letting go and\naccepting these past situations\nand progressing forward.\nNumber three, they are not\neasily influenced by others.\nFollowing crowds and\nletting others influence you\nindicates a weak sense of self.\nThose who are mentally strong\nare not ones to follow crowds\nand jump on bandwagons\nbecause they are firm\nin who they are.\nThis isn't to say that people\nwho are mentally strong\ndon't listen and adapt to others.\nInstead, they understand\nthat you should not let peer\npressure drive your actions\nor beliefs.\nSo they're less likely to find themselves\nroped into something they\naren't comfortable with.\nThey work at understanding viewpoints\ninstead of blindly\naccepting them as their own.\nNumber four, they do not let people\noverstep their boundaries.\nSetting boundaries is a crucial\naspect of mental wellbeing.\nAccording to Jane Collingwood\nfrom Psych Central,\nthe ability to set personal boundaries\nis directly related to\nhaving a high self-esteem.\nPeople who are mentally strong are aware\nof their own boundaries,\nwhether that be personal,\nprofessional, emotional or anything else.\nEstablishing and enforcing boundaries\nhelps your mental wellbeing\nand keeps others aware\nof your needs.\nNumber five, they don't stick\nto their own perspective.\nEven though people with high\nlevels of mental strength\nhave a strong sense of self,\nthey are still open-minded to\nother people's perspectives.\nIn fact, they often reevaluate\ntheir ideas and beliefs.\nThe difference is that this\nreevaluation is internal\nand based on newly acquired\ninsights and perspectives,\nnot peer pressure,\nas in thinking and\nunderstanding viewpoints\nrather than jumping on a bandwagon.\nPeople who are mentally strong\nare open to new perspectives\nand believe that they are fuel for growth.\nNumber six, they don't blame\nothers for their mistakes.\nAccountability is key.\nPeople who are mentally strong\ndo not play the blame game.\nBeing mentally strong does\nnot mean that you are perfect.\nSo they take ownership of their\nactions and they recognize\nthat their emotions, thoughts,\nand ideas are their own\nrather than trying to blame\nothers for influencing them.\nThey have trained themselves\nto focus on progress\nand problem solving rather\nthan dwelling on things\nout of their control, such as what or who\nmight have put them in\nan unfavorable situation.\nNumber seven, they don't\nfixate on perfection.\nContrary to popular belief,\nmental strength does\nnot equal perfectionism.\nPeople who are mentally strong\nhave a healthy view of\nfailure and continuously learn\nfrom their mistake.\nHowever, although they\nare not perfectionists,\nthey do strive to become better.\nThe difference lies in that\nthey strive to become better\nin comparison to their past selves,\nnot better in comparison to others.\nThey have a growth mindset\nversus a fixed mindset.\nIn order to grow, these\nindividuals embrace failures\nand constructive criticism,\nviewing them as lessons\nrather than testaments to\nwho they are as people.\nAnd finally, number eight.\nThey don't dread their own company.\nFor some people, time spent\nalone can be difficult\nbecause it invites loneliness,\nobsessive thoughts,\nand other insecurities to\ncome up towards the surface.\nTo people who are mentally strong,\ntime alone is time to reflect, relax,\nand get to know themselves better.\nThis is different from introversion,\nas mentally strong people\ndon't necessarily prefer\nor need time alone.\nIt's just something they take\ncomfort in when it happens.\nThe most important takeaway to note\nis that being mentally strong is a skill\nthat anyone can develop.\nEverything mentioned\nin the video are things\nthat you can work on to\nimprove your mental strength,\njust like how working out\nimproves your physical strength.\nWhat are some things you can do\nto improve your mental strength?\nIn what ways are you\nmentally strong already?\nLet us know in the comments.\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to like and share it with someone\nwho might benefit from it as well.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you soon.\n(gentle music)"
