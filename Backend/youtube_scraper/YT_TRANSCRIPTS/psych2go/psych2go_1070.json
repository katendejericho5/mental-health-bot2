    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Do you believe\nin love at first sight?\nWhen you feel intense chemistry,\nyou may believe you finally found the one\nbut is attraction enough for\na meaningful relationship?\nFor a couple to stand\nthrough the tests of time\na deeper connection is crucial.\nThe connection called compatibility.\nUnderstanding the\ndifference between the two\ncan get confusing sometimes.\nSo is it just chemistry,\nbut not compatibility.\nHere are some signs to\nhelp you figure it out.\nNumber one.\nYou can't imagine spending\nyour life with them.\nYou like cuddling with them and have fun\nwhen you go out to the movies,\ntheir jokes make you cry, laughing\nand you can't stop smiling\nwhen you're with them.\nIf that's true, there's\ndefinitely chemistry between you.\nNow close your eyes, and imagine\nthem by your side forever.\nDo you feel something's\nwrong with that picture?\nMaybe you like to hang out with them\nbut they're not serious enough\nfor a long-term relationship\nor they pursue a completely\nopposite lifestyle.\nWhatever it is, you can ignore it for now,\nbut you know it would drive\nyou crazy in the long run.\nThey just don't seem right\nand you're probably right.\nIf you can feel it, even\nthrough all that chemistry,\nmost likely you're just not compatible.\nNumber two.\nYou don't share the same values.\nThat first attraction,\nyou probably didn't talk about your values\nor opinions as much.\nYou just wanted to spend time with them\nand possibly stop blushing so much, right?\nBut sooner or later,\nthe question of your beliefs will pop up\nand you might get surprised.\nWhen you're not truly compatible,\nyou might have completely\ndifferent opinions\non topics of religion,\npolitics, parenting style.\nWhile it's true that you\ncan value others' opinions\neven if you disagree,\nit can get difficult to date someone\nwho doesn't share your values and beliefs.\nHaving opposing views on major topics\ncan impact your life together\nand make you prone to arguments and fights\neven if they're extremely cute.\nNumber three.\nYou're complete opposites.\nIt is said that opposites attract.\nWhen it comes to relationships,\nyou may be a naturally calm person\nwhich helps ground your\nnaturally hotheaded partner,\nor maybe you are very anxious\nbut your optimistic partner\nhelps you calm that anxiety.\nBut if you're complete opposites\nwhen it comes to your\ninterests, ideas and opinions,\nit may be difficult for you\nto enjoy each other's company.\nIf you like to spend your\nweekends going to the theater\nwhile your partner would\nrather go to a soccer game,\nyou're probably going\nto have some problems\ndeciding how to spend your time together.\nMaybe you have some common interests\nbut if you're planning to\nstay together long-term,\na few common interests\nmay not be enough for you\nto have a fulfilling relationship.\nNumber four.\nYou're often bored of each other.\nHow did you feel when you first met them?\nDid the excitement of seeing them again\nmake you lose sleep?\nAnd every second you spent\nthus was filled with fun.\nYou could feel the chemistry\nwith all your senses.\nWhat about now?\nAs time passed,\nyou started spending more time together\nbut now you kind of feel bored.\nThe initial excitement\nstopped being so intense.\nThis often happens to couples\nthat were blinded with chemistry,\nbut are not actually compatible.\nYou stop spending quality time together\nor even avoid one another.\nUnfortunately, it rarely\ngets better with time\nand sometimes the relationship ends\nbecause they find someone new,\nsomeone who makes them feel\nthat excitement all over again.\nAnd number five.\nYou have different goals for the future.\nWhat do you want out of your future?\nDo you wanna get married\nand start a family\nbut your partner would rather\nspend their life traveling\nor maybe you wanna move into a big city\nwith lots of opportunities,\nbut they would like to\nlive in the countryside,\nsurrounded by animals.\nHaving similar goals is pretty important\nfor a long-term relationship\nand by pretty, we mean, absolutely.\nIt's a touchstone for a\ncompatible relationship.\nHaving different views about the future\nis something that's definitely\ngoing to take a toll on you\nno matter how much you\nlike them at the moment.\nWhen your feelings are\nonly led by chemistry\nand attraction without compatibility,\nit opens the door for lots of\nfrustration and loneliness.\nEven if you are still not sure,\nyou don't have to worry, time will tell\nand your heart will know what to do.\nThe good news is Psych2Goers\nthat it's completely possible\nfor chemistry and compatibility\nto go hand in hand.\nWhen that happens,\nit's the start of a wonderful\nand fruitful relationship.\nSo do you recognize any of these signs?\nIf so, do you think this video\nhelped you to identify them?\nFeel free to leave a
