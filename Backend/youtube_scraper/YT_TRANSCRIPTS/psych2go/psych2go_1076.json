    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nhow do you see yourself?\nAre you confident in who you are,\nor do you struggle a lot with it?\nSeeing value and worth in\nyourself despite what others think\nand what you go through,\nis important to your overall wellbeing.\nIt can affect how you think,\nfeel and act towards yourself\nand also impact how you\nlet others treat you.\nWhile many may think that low self-esteem\nlooks like someone who is\nsitting alone by themselves\nnot wanting to do anything all the time,\nit can actually manifest in\na number of different ways,\nsome which may surprise you.\nSo to look more into this topic,\nhere are seven habits of\npeople with low self-esteem.\nNumber one, procrastination.\nAre you always delaying or\navoiding things you have to do?\nWhether it's a project for work\nor replying to emails and messages,\nthis habit to procrastinate on things\nmay stem from having a low self-esteem.\nAccording to several studies\nthat looked into self-esteem\nand procrastination,\nit's found that those with low self-esteem\ntend to procrastinate and\ndelay their tasks more,\nsince it can justify poor\nperformance and negative outcomes.\nTo protect your self esteem\nfrom the possibility of failure,\nyou may purposefully\nsabotage yourself early on.\nBy doing so, if you do get a\nbad grade or make a mistake,\nyou can blame it on the circumstances\nin the limited time you had,\ninstead of your ability.\nNumber two: Passivity.\nDo you actively take\nsteps to reach your dreams\nor do you just let things happen to you?\nAnother habit you may develop\nfrom having low self-esteem\nis passivity.\nThis can mean being\ndisinterested and disengaged\nfrom everyday activities or\nletting opportunities pass by\nwithout a moment's thought.\nWhen you have low\nself-esteem, you may believe\nthat you're not capable of\nachieving your goals or dreams.\nAs a result, you may lack\nthe motivation and drive\nto try or to take the steps to get closer\nto achieving what you want.\nIf you find that the things\nyou want felt too overwhelming\nand almost impossible to reach,\ntry to break them up into smaller steps.\nIf you wanna be a published author\nbut are struggling to write,\nyou can try taking up a\nclass or talking to people\nabout their experience in the field.\nLittle by little, you may\nstart to find yourself\nbecoming more active in\nchasing what you want.\nNumber three, negative self talk.\nAre you very harsh on yourself?\nThe way you speak to yourself\ncan affect your attitude and behavior.\nAnd so if you tend to be\nvery negative about yourself,\nthen it's likely that your\nself-esteem will suffer.\nPerhaps you are overly\ncritical of yourself.\nYou blame yourself for things\nthat are out of your control\nor are always focused on\nthe negative side of things\ninstead of looking at the bigger picture.\nIn the end, when all you're\nsurrounding yourself with\nis criticism and negativity, all the time,\nyour mental and emotional\nhealth will take a dive.\nSo if you notice that you\ntend to be very negative,\nyou can try to be more aware\nof the things you are telling yourself\nand question whether they are true.\nAre these thoughts helping you\nor just unnecessarily pulling you down?\nNumber four: Isolation.\nHave you been ignoring your friends' calls\nand invitations lately?\nIt's normal to wanna have some\nalone time from time to time\nbut it may become a cause for concern\nwhen you start to isolate\nyourself for a long time,\nfrom everyone around you.\nRelated to the last point,\nhaving low self-esteem can lead\nto negative thoughts and beliefs,\nsuch as thinking that you're\nunworthy of friendship or love.\nOr believing that you're\na burden to be around.\nAs a result, you may\nstart to isolate yourself\nfrom your loved ones.\nUnfortunately, by doing this,\nyou may only end up ruminating even more,\noften to the point that\nit no longer matches up\nwith what's true and real.\nFor this reason, it's important to go out\nand meet up with people and\nstop these negative thoughts\nfrom taking over.\nNumber five: People pleasing.\nDo you agree to plans despite\nbeing busy and unavailable\njust because you don't\nwant to upset anyone?\nWhen your self esteem is low,\nyou may turn to pleasing others\nto feel validated and accepted.\nWhile it's certainly good to\nwanna help and care for others\nit can become an issue\nif you're only doing it to gain approval.\nOr if you end up\nsacrificing all your energy\nor your mental wellbeing for it.\nPeople pleasing may also lead\nto exhaustion and burnout,\nsince you're taking on much\nmore than you can carry.\nSo before you take on any\nmore plans for other people,\nremember to also think about\nyour own needs and wants.\nAnd set some healthy\nboundaries for yourself.\nNumber six: Perfectionism.\nAre you always overworking yourself\nuntil the project or task\nis done to the utmost of perfection?\nWhen you feel like you're\nnot worthy or good enough\nyou might try to perfect\nthe things around you\nto create the illusion of\nsuccess and achievement.\nWith low self-esteem, you\nmay worry about others\nthinking that you're incompetent\nand overcompensate by trying\nto do everything perfectly.\nHowever, since it's impossible to do so,\nyou might just find yourself\neven more stressed and overwhelmed,\nsometimes to the point of burnout.\nSo while it's hard to admit,\ntry to remind yourself\nthat it's human to make mistakes.\nAnd number seven: Being\nunable to accept compliments.\nAs you feel awkward\nwhen someone praises you\nfor a job well done.\nAccording to a study that\nlooked at the relationship\nbetween self-esteem and positive feedback,\nit's found that those with low self-esteem\ntend to have a harder time\naccepting compliments.\nThis is because your self\nperceived sense of worthlessness\ncontradicts the positive\nfeedback you receive.\nAs a result, you may find\nyourself unable to accept praise\nor think that what is\nbeing said is untrue.\nOr because of a misunderstanding.\nDo you struggle with
