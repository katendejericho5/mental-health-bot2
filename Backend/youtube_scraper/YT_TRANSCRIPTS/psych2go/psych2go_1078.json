    "transcript": "- [Presenter] Hey, welcome back.\nThere has been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks for being a part of our journey.\nDo you know what it means\nto have a trauma bond\nwith someone?\nMost people would wrongly assume\nthat this means bonding with\nsomeone over a shared trauma\nbut actually trauma bonding\nis a defining characteristic\nof many toxic and abusive relationships.\nAnd it's often the main reason why\nwe might find ourselves\nunable to leave them.\nA drama bond refers to the\ndeep emotional attachment\none might feel towards their abuser\nand it's more likely to develop in those\nwho have a history of abuse, exploitation,\nor emotional codependency\nin their past relationships.\nTrauma bonds can easily be mistaken\nfor feelings of love and\ncommitment towards another person.\nSo with that said, here are\nsome signs to look out for\nthat tell you if it's not actually love\nthat you're experiencing,\nbut a trauma bond.\nNumber one, the other person\nis outwardly charming.\nOf course, if given the choice\nno one would willingly choose\nto pursue a relationship\nwith someone who acts\nabusive towards them.\nThe problem is however\nthe toxic relationships\ndon't start out that way.\nAnd it's usually only when\nyou've already experienced\nthe abuse that you start to\nrealize something is wrong.\nYou might develop a\ntrauma bond with someone\nif they are outwardly\ncharming, sweet, caring,\nand seem trustworthy to\nyou, but don't be fooled.\nThere might be something more sinister\nlurking beneath it all.\nNumber two, they are\nemotionally unpredictable.\nYou might be asking yourself\nwhy don't people just\nleave the relationships\nonce they realize that\nit's unhealthy for them,\nbut the trouble is it's a lot\nharder to spot trauma bonding\nwhen it's up close and personal\ncompared to if you just saw\nit happening to someone else.\nThis is because abusive partners\ncan often be emotionally\nmanipulative, too.\nThey might abuse you and devalue you\nonly to shower you with\nkindness, apologies,\nand promises to change the next day.\nThis serves as positive\nreinforcement to make you\nsecond guess any thoughts you\nmight have of leaving them.\nNumber three, they tend to\ntake their problems out on you.\nThink back to the last\ntime this partner, friend,\nor family member heard some bad news\nor encountered a problem.\nHow do they usually deal with it?\nDo they often lash out,\ntake it out on you,\neven when you've done nothing wrong?\nThey could be keeping you around\nas their psychological punching bag\nand you deserve better than that.\nNumber four, they isolate\nyou from your loved ones.\nSome people might think\nit's sweet to have someone\nwho wants them all to\nthemselves and gets jealous\nof those you spend your time with,\nbut there's a difference\nbetween loving someone so much\nyou want them around all the time\nand actively working to isolate them\nfrom the other important\nrelationships in their lives.\nDoes this person get mad at you\nfor spending time with\nanyone who isn't them?\nDo they try to control\nwho you're with or ask you\nto distance yourself from\nyour friends and family?\nIf the answer is yes then that's\nas clear a red flag as any.\nNumber five you deny or\nminimize their abusive behavior.\nNow let's look at all\nthe ways the trauma bond\nmight affect you and your behavior.\nOftentimes the most telling sign\nthat you are in a destructive relationship\nis if you find yourself\nconstantly trying to deny\nor minimize the other\nperson's wrongdoings.\nWe look past all their\nmistreatment towards us\nand minimize the abuse\nby saying things like,\noh, it's not that bad\nreally, or I don't mind it,\nbecause in the moment it's easier for us\nto just brush it off\ninstead of confronting\nwhat might be a terrible harsh reality\nthat the person you're\nwith is abusing you.\nNumber six, you constantly\nmake excuses for them.\nThe moment you can no longer deny\nor minimize what the\nother person has done,\nand a family member or\nfriend says something like\nwhat they did to you is not okay,\ndon't let them treat you like that,\nyou're still most likely going to try\nto make excuses for them\nand come to their defense.\nAt times you might even\nfind yourself feeling\nlike you deserve their mistreatment.\nOnce you start thinking like\nthis, that is a critical sign\nthat you are in a trauma bond\nand not a loving relationship.\nNumber seven, you're becoming more\nand more emotionally numb.\nHave you noticed yourself\nfeeling less and less lately?\nLike you are detached\nand emotionally numb.\nYou might be feeling this way\nbecause subconsciously it's\nyour mind's way of coping\nwith all of the abuse\nthat it's had to deal with\nfrom the person you're trauma bonded to.\nYou can't take any more pain,\nfear, anger, or heartache.\nSo instead you close yourself\noff from all of your emotions.\nYou're not as vibrant, talkative,\nor expressive as you used to be.\nAnd they're the reason why.\nAnd number eight,\nyou're hiding aspects of your\nrelationship from others.\nFinally, but perhaps most\nimportantly, if you start to hide\ncertain aspects of your\nrelationship from those around you\nthen you know that there's\ndefinitely something wrong\nbecause why else would you\nactively try to cover up\nhow bad things are\ngetting between you two.\nLoyalty towards an\nabusive significant other\nis a hallmark of trauma bonding.\nSo you might find yourself\nbecoming defensive\nor even angered by other\npeople's attempts to intervene\nin your relationship and help you.\nDo you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nIf you or anyone you know\nis trapped in a trauma bond\nwith someone abusive,\ndon't hesitate to speak out\nand seek professional help today.\nAnd if you need to, get\nin touch with authorities\nwho can help you too.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find use in this video
