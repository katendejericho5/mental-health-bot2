    "transcript": "everever found yourself in a situation\nwhere someone seem to be more into you\nthan you were into them it can be\nflattering at first but sometimes it can\nget a little intense right well\npsychology actually has a term for this\nand it's called limerance larance is an\nintense unhealthy infactuation that\ndiffers from genuine love because it's\nfocused more on idealization and\nObsession rather than mutual respect and\nunderstanding when someone is\nexperiencing lumirance they're totally\nobsessed with the object of their\naffection now being the object of\nsomeone's affection can feel pretty good\nbut it's important to recognize when\nthings might be getting out of hand here\nare some signs that someone might be a\nlittle too into you or becoming lant\nwith you Constant Contact do they text\nyou constantly bombard you with messages\nor call you nonstop sure it's nice to\nhear from someone you like but if this\nperson is blowing up your phone every 5\nminutes needing Constant Contact from\nyou it could very well be a sign to\ncrossing the line from interested to\nobsessed physical clinginess while\nphysical affection is a normal part of\nany relationship someone who is limerent\nmight take it to the extreme they might\ninsist on physical contact invade your\npersonal space or become overly\npossessive in public so does this person\nrespect your personal space or do they\nconstantly invade it no matter who the\nthis person is or what kind of\nrelationship you have with them it's\nimportant to establish boundaries when\nit comes to physical\nintimacy grand gestures sure Grand\nromantic gestures can be sweet but when\nthey start to feel more like something\nout of a romcom in real life it might be\na sign of limerance think Ted Mosby from\nHow I Met Your Mother are they\nconstantly showering you with\nextravagant gifts or planning elaborate\nsurprises without considering whether\nyou actually want them well it's not\nnice to feel appreciated it's also\nimportant for gestures to feel genuine\nand thoughtful not forced or over the\ntop these acts or gifts are supposed to\nmake you feel loved not\noverwhelmed idealizing you it's one\nthing to admire someone's qualities but\nit's another thing entirely to put them\non a pedestal for example they might be\nquick to dismiss any negative qualities\nor mistakes you have believing you can\ndo no wrong you get the sense that they\nbelieve being with you will solve all of\ntheir problems\nand make their life complete this is a\nsign they're more infatuated with the\nidea of you rather than who you actually\nare loss of identity have you noticed\nthat this person seems to have lost\nsight of who they are outside of their\nfeelings for you did they stop talking\nto other people in their life and only\nseem to want to spend time with you\nmaybe they've started adopting your\ninterests hobbies and even mannerisms as\ntheir own while it's flattering to have\nsomeone admire you it's also important\nfor them to maintain their own sense of\nself contact no for an answer this is a\nbig one no means no right but someone\nwho is too lerant might have a hard time\naccepting rejection do they respect your\ndecisions or do they try to override\nthem they might try to manipulate or\nguilt trip you into changing your mind\nor even resort to more Extreme Measures\nto try to win you over it's important to\nstand firm within your boundaries and\nnot let anyone pressure you into\nsomething you're not comfortable\nwith extreme jealousy a little jealousy\nis natural in any relationship but if\nsomeone is overly possessive or jealous\nof any attention you give to others it\ncould be a red flag do they closely\nmonitor your interactions with friends\nor get upset when you talk about other\npeople in your life do they police your\nother relationships and dictate who you\ncan and can't spend time with do they\nseem paranoid about your friends or even\nstrangers being friendly with you\nhealthy relationships are built on trust\nand mutual respect not possessiveness\nand jealousy so if this person is\ncrossing the line from caring to\ncontrolling it may be a sign of a deep\nissue like limerance it's important to\nremember that most people who experience\nlimerance aren't dangerous or malicious\nthey just caught up in a whirlwind of\nintense emotions this is common for\npeople who grew up emotionally neglected\nstill that doesn't mean you should\ntolerate this Behavior especially if\nyou're uncomfortable it's natural to\nfeel conflicted especially especially if\nthe person experiencing limerance is a\nfriend or someone you care about deeply\nbut tolerating this behavior is only\ngoing to keep this cycle of unhealthy\nfeelings and attachment unchecked by\nsetting some boundaries talking openly\nand making sure you're taking care of\nyourself you're not only keeping\nyourself safe but also helping both of\nyou grow in the end dealing with\nlimerance isn't just about looking out\nfor yourself but making things better\nfor both of you it might be tough to let\ngo but in the end it's the only way way\nfor the two of you to feel respected and\nunderstood and to anyone on the other\nend experiencing limerance maybe it's\ntime to stop seeing love where there is\nnone and move on to find real happiness\nand real love so how do you\ndifferentiate between genuine feelings\nof love and unhealthy infactuation share\nyour insights in the comments down below\nand if you found this video helpful
