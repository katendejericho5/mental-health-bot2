worried\nabout your mental health?\nMajor mental illnesses,\nsuch as schizophrenia\nor bipolar disorder, rarely\nappear out of the blue.\nMost often family, friends, teachers\nor individuals themselves\nrecognize that something's not quite right\nabout one's thinking,\nfeelings, or behaviors\nbefore one of these illnesses appears\nin its full blown form.\nBeing informed about developing symptoms\nor early warning signs\ncan lead to intervention\nthat can help produce the\nseverity of an illness.\nIt may even be possible to delay\nor prevent a major mental\nillness altogether.\nBefore we begin, this video is\nfor educational purposes only\nand is not a substitute\nfor professional guidance,\nadvice, treatment, or diagnosis.\nWe recommend you to reach out\nto a qualified healthcare provider\nor mental health professional\nif you or someone you know are struggling.\nWith that said, let's look\nat the seven warning signs\nof a mental illness.\nNumber one, recent social withdrawal\nand loss of interest in others.\nDo you know someone who\nhas withdrawn themselves\nfrom social interaction?\nHave they been spending an\nexcessive amount of time alone\ncompared to before?\nSocial withdrawal is defined\nas the lack of social relations\nwith one's family and friends.\nSocial withdrawal can be\na symptom of depression\npersonality disorder,\nanxiety disorder, and more.\nBut it could also be caused by\nother factors in one's life,\nsuch as high pressure\nfrom family or peers.\nNumber two, an unusual\ndrop in functioning,\nespecially at school or work.\nSomeone who is suffering\nfrom a mental illness\nmay experience a sudden\ndrop in their grades\nor performance in school or work.\nThis can be caused by\ndifficulties in concentrating,\nlack of self-worth, low mood, joylessness,\na lack of activities and\ninterest, social withdrawal,\ngiving up leisure activities,\nchanges in appetite, and sleep disruption.\nThese are all symptoms\nthat could heavily impact\nsomeone's ability to do work\nand could be a sign of mental illness.\nNumber three, problems with concentration,\nmemory, or logical thought and speech.\nDo you have trouble concentrating\nno matter how hard you try?\nAccording to an article\nwritten by Rachell Nall\nand medically reviewed\nby Dr. Alana Biggers,\nall of us rely on concentration\nto get through work or school every day.\nWhen you're unable to concentrate,\nyou can't think clearly, focus on a task,\nor maintain your attention.\nThis not only affects your\nperformance at school or work,\nbut also your decision making.\nSome symptoms you may have experienced\ndue to poor concentration\ninclude being unable to remember things\nthat occurred a short time ago,\ndifficulty sitting still,\ndifficulty thinking clearly,\nfrequently losing things\nor difficulty remembering\nwhere things are,\nand inability to make decisions\nor an inability to\nperform complicated tasks.\nNumber four, loss of initiative\nor desire to participate in any activity.\nAre you uninterested in\nthings that you once enjoyed?\nAnhedonia, similar to apathy,\ncan refer to the\ninability to feel pleasure\nor manifest as a reduced\ndesire and reduced motivation\nto engage in activities\nthat were once pleasurable.\nThe resulting numbness of this condition\ncan be overwhelming and scary,\nand it could be a symptom of depression.\nAnother term for anhedonia\nis emotional flatlining.\nIf you'd like to know more about it,\ncheck out our video,\nEmotional Flatlining, What is it?\nNumber five, a vague feeling\nof being disconnected\nfrom one's self or one's surroundings.\nA sense of unreality.\nHave you ever had an experience\nwhere everyone you know,\neverything around you,\neverything that you're thinking\nand feeling feels fake?\nOr that instead of being\nin the here and now,\nyou feel like a detached observer?\nWatching yourself go through life\nfrom a disconnected vantage point.\nThis could also be another\nsign of mental illness.\nAnd there are actually\na few terms for this.\nThey're called depersonalization,\nan internal feeling of\ndisconnection from one's self.\nDerealization, an external\nfeeling of disconnection\nfrom one's surroundings.\nAnd dissociation, detachment\nfrom one's physical\nand emotional experience.\nNumber six, unusual or exaggerated beliefs\nabout personal powers or magical thinking.\nWhat is magical thinking you may ask?\nWell, it refers to the idea\nthat you can influence the\noutcome of specific events\nby doing something that has no\nbearing on the circumstances.\nIt's pretty common in children.\nRemember holding your breath\ngoing through a tunnel,\nor not stepping on sidewalk\ncracks for the sake\nof your mom's back, or\njumping from sofa to sofa\nbecause the floor is lava?\nMagical thinking can\npersist into adulthood too.\nGenerally speaking, there's nothing wrong\nwith following rituals or superstitions\nas long as they do not hurt anyone\nor they're not done excessively.\nHowever, uncontrollable and\nexcessive magical thinking\ncan be a symptom of\nmental health disorders,\nlike obsessive compulsive disorder,\nschizophrenia, and anxiety disorder.\nAnd number seven, rapid or dramatic shifts\nin feelings or mood swings.\nOf course, it's normal to have days\nwhere you feel sad or days\nwhen you're overjoyed.\nAs long as your mood changes\ndon't interfere with your\nlife to an extreme degree,\nthey're generally\nconsidered to be healthy.\nBut if your behavior is unpredictable\nfor a number of days or longer,\nit may be a sign of\nsomething more serious.\nYou may feel grumpy one\nminute and happy the next.\nYou may also have emotions\nthat can cause damage to your life.\nIf you are experiencing\nsevere shifts in mood\nor mood changes that\ncause extreme disruption\nin typical behavior, it's\nbest to talk to your doctor.\nProfessional therapy or medications\ncan help you relieve these\nlife altering shifts in mood.\nSo, have you seen any of\nthese signs in yourself\nor those around you?\nIf you or someone you know identifies\nwith a lot of these signs,\nplease don't hesitate\nto reach out to a mental\nhealth professional.\nYou're not alone in your struggles.\nDid you find value in this video?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find
