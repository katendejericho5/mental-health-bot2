    "transcript": "Five ways my ADHD makes adulting hard.\nYeah, so did I.\nI'm Sonya, I was diagnosed with\nADHD as an adult last year.\nI never even considered\nthat I could have ADHD\nuntil my doctor suggested I get tested.\nA couple of years ago, I\nshowed up to her office,\nsobbing to her, because\nI felt like I was failing\nat being an adult.\nI was anxious all the\ntime and felt depressed,\nand I was overwhelmed by basic things\nlike keeping my apartment\nclean, paying my phone bill,\nor remembering my best friend's birthday,\nor where I put my keys.\nIt turns out that ADHD doesn't always\nlook like a hyperactive\nkid bouncing off the walls,\nespecially in girls and adults.\nI have a type of ADHD\ncalled Inattentive ADHD,\nwhich shows up as distractibility,\ndisorganization, forgetfulness,\nor procrastination.\nOnce I got my diagnosis\nand learned how ADHD affects my brain,\nmuch of what I struggled\nwith my whole life,\nfinally made so much more sense.\nI wasn't lazy or incompetent.\nMy brain just works differently\nand it turns out my ADHD\nmakes adulting hard.\nHere our five ways my ADHD\nmakes basic life tasks\nextremely challenging.\nNumber one, I'm super disorganized.\nDo you have a friend or\nroommate who's always late,\nconstantly loses important things,\nbounces from idea to idea,\nand sometimes gets lost\ncoming to your house even\nthough she's been there\na million times before?\nYeah?\nThat's me.\nMy brain is kind of\nlike a computer browser\nwith a whole bunch of open tabs\nthat I'm constantly jumping between,\njust as I try to do one thing,\nI think of something else\nthat needs to be done or something else\ncatches my attention and\nanother tab gets opened.\nPeople with ADHD struggle\nwith a set of skills\ncalled executive function that\nare needed to stay organized\nand complete tasks.\nExecutive function\nincludes working memory,\nflexible thinking, and self-control.\nIt's sort of like the\nmanagement system of the brain.\nIt's completely unsurprising\nthat I'm constantly misplacing things.\nMy keys, my wallet, my\nphone, and forgetting to do\nimportant adulting things\nlike pay my bills on time\nor file my taxes.\nThe second way my ADHD makes adulting hard\nis that I lose hours of\nmy life to hyperfocus.\nHyperfocus is kind of a\nsurprising symptom of ADHD\nsince it's basically the\ncomplete opposite of distraction.\nHyperfocus is when a person\nbecomes intensely immersed\non something like a new\nhobby or topic of activity\nfor a long time.\nWhen I get hyperfocused on something,\nI'm often so focused I don't\nnotice the world around me\nor realize how much time is passing.\nSometimes, the ability to\nhyperfocus is actually helpful.\nThink pulling an all nighter\nto cram for an exam, for\nexample, because I can completely\nblock out all distractions\nand focus super intensely,\nbut more often than not, my\nhyperfocus gets me into trouble.\nI'll miss my subway stop,\nbecause I'm so fixated\non researching which\nrestaurant I wanna go to\nfor my birthday dinner,\nand then I end up late\nfor an important meeting or appointment.\nI basically need to set alarms\nfor myself for everything,\nbecause it's so easy for\nme to get sidetracked\nwhen I get hyperfocused.\nThe third way my ADHD\nmakes my adulting hard\nis that I'm completely time blind.\nMy time blindness makes\nalmost every aspect\nof my life more difficult.\nWhat's hard for my friends\nand family to understand\nis that I'm not just\nintentionally ignoring the time\nor showing up late, because I don't care.\nThe ADHD brain actually\nsenses time differently.\nFor me, time passes differently\ndepending on the state I'm in.\nIf I'm hyperfocused, hours\ncan fly by before I know it.\nI'll sit down to play a quick\nvideo game and then suddenly,\ntwo hours have passed\nwithout me realizing it.\nI often misjudge how long getting ready\nto go out for dinner will take\nor how long a certain project\nwill take to complete.\nThis means I upset my friends\nwho have to wait for me\nor often have to work through the night,\nbecause I'm trying to meet\na deadline for a project\nI didn't realize would take so long.\nAnother way my ADHD makes adulting hard\nis that I have a hard\ntime managing my emotions,\nand I'm super sensitive.\nResearch shows that people with ADHD\nfeel emotions more suddenly and intensely\nthan people without ADHD.\nThe ADHD brain sometimes\nallows a sudden emotion\nto become too strong and floods the brain\nwith that emotion super intensely.\nWhen I get one of these\nintense floods of emotion,\nit's really hard to not have\nan equally strong reaction\nlike an outburst of anger,\nor sadness, or excitement.\nTypically, these outbursts of emotions\ndon't go over well in the adult world.\nI'm also extremely sensitive\nto criticism in any kind\nof rejection, which I always thought\nwas just because I was super emotional.\nIt turns out, Rejection\nSensitivity Disorder\nor RSD is actually a\ncommon symptom of ADHD.\nPeople with RSD feel extreme\nemotional sensitivity\nand even physical pain when they feel like\nthey've been rejected, or criticized,\nor if they feel like\nthey've failed in some way.\nEven though I've come to\nembrace my emotional nature,\nit's part of what makes me\ncompassionate, creative,\nand sensitive to others.\nThis struggle to manage my emotions\nis one of the most difficult\nparts of adulting with ADHD.\nAdults are expected to be\nable to deal with frustrations\nin life and accept feedback\nwithout losing their cool\nor having a complete meltdown.\nAnd the fifth way my\nADHD makes adulting hard\nis that I am the ultimate procrastinator.\nAs the responsibilities of\nadulting continue to pile up,\nmy ability to hyperfocus\nisn't always enough\nto help me get by like it used to.\nWhile it may look like\nI'm simply being lazy,\nmy ADHD can actually\nmake it feel physically\nimpossible for me to\nget started on something\nlike doing laundry or studying for an exam\nI'm nervous about.\nI will desperately want\nto clean up my apartment,\nor do my laundry, or\nsome other basic task,\nbut I become immobilized with anxiety\nand feel like I'm stuck to my couch,\ncompletely overwhelmed with\nall the things I need to do\nthat I can't seem to do anything at all.\nThis part of my ADHD is really tough,\nbecause when I can't do things\nthat seem so simple to other people,\nlike just doing my dishes\nbefore they get moldy\nor remembering to call my\ngrandma on her birthday,\nI feel stupid and full of shame.\nSo yeah, adulting with ADHD is hard,\nbut I've learned that it's\nnot totally impossible.\nKnowing that I'm not lazy,\nweak, or incompetent,\nthat my brain just\nfunctions a bit differently\nhas been life changing.\nOver time, I've learned lots\nof ways to cope with my ADHD\nand even knew some of the\nsymptoms to my advantage.\nA combination of medication, therapy,\nsupport groups, scheduling\ntools, time apps,\nand a lot of self-compassion\nhave turned me\ninto a pretty decent adult.\nThough, I'm still pretty messy\nand usually late for dinner.\nThis video is not meant to\nbe used to diagnose ADHD.\nIf you think you might have ADHD,\nthe best thing to do\nis contact your doctor\nto see about getting assessed."
