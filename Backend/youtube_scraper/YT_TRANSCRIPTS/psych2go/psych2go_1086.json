    "transcript": "- Welcome, hope you've\nbeen enjoying our videos.\nI think Disney's \"Hercules\" put it best.\nPeople always do crazy\nthings when they're in love,\nbut they didn't say anything\nabout the crazy things we can do\nto figure out if someone likes us back.\nWell, we're in luck, because\nthere's a couple here.\nCome on out, don't be shy.\nMeet Noah and Kay.\nThey wanna share their story.\nBefore couplehood, they had\nfeelings for each other,\nbut they were unsure if\nthe feeling was mutual.\nThese two are just like you.\nLike attracts like, and\nthey did the same things\nmany of you would do.\nSo, Noah, Kay, don't worry,\nI'm here for support.\nWind back the clock and\nshow us how it happened.\nHere, why don't I introduce the first sign\nto get you started?\nNumber one, they talk to you all the time.\nKay and Noah meet at work\nwhere they're placed on the same team\nand also sat right next to each other.\nOkay, not a Hollywood flick.\nThey weren't a couple within\none hour and 54 minutes,\nbut they do get along and\ncontinue to talk at work\nabout normal things, like\nmeeting times or emails.\nA little after that they exchanged numbers\nand began texting before and after work.\nIt soon got to the point\nwhere they were constantly in contact,\neven on the weekends.\nOkay, pause the story for a sec.\nDoes this remind you of anyone?\nEagerly talking to each other\nfrom the moment you wake up\nuntil the moment you fall asleep?\nPart of you knows you\nare chatting with them\nway more than anyone else.\nCould it be something more?\nBut it could still be a new friend thing,\njust like what Noah and Kay think.\nLet's take a cue from The Chainsmokers.\nNo, no, no, put that lighter away.\nWe don't mean that kind.\nNevermind, as I was saying, number two.\nJust like The Chainsmokers, the EDM duo,\nthey wanna be closer.\nNoah and Kay are always together.\nWhen they're hanging out off the clock,\nthey like to watch\nanime and action movies.\nMartial arts flicks are their favorite.\nWhenever they're watching something,\nNoah and Kay are always sitting close,\nnever touching, but they're never more\nthan a foot away from each other.\nAt work they respect each\nother's personal space,\nbut they will sit next\nto each other in meetings\nand take their breaks together.\nPause, Noah and Kay are\nnon-verbally communicating\nthrough body language.\nInviting body language signs are things\nlike frequent physical closeness\nand open-body positions.\nSo no closed arms or legs\nand no distancing behaviors.\nNow back to the story.\nNumber three.\nThey seem to be strangely\njust right all the time.\nNoah and Kay like to take\na bit of a walk together\nafter a cooped-up day at work.\nOne hot and sunny day Kay\nnoticed, dun dun, dun,\nshe is sweating.\nNormally she doesn't care.\nBut now with Noah right there, really?\nNope, not happening.\nSo when the sweat feels close\nto gross, she wipes it away.\nBut only when Noah isn't looking.\nShe occasionally creates\nthe distraction herself,\nlike pointing out a\nfictional eagle over there.\nWhen Noah turns back to Kay,\nhuh, how is it this hot out,\nyet Kay still looks pristine.\nLet's talk about it.\nThis point isn't about general vanity,\nbut why does Kay care so much\nabout how she looks for Noah?\nThe effort here is for\none specific reason.\nThe truth is, they don't really care\nhow others view their aesthetics.\nThey're only worried\nabout one specific person,\ntheir crush.\nSo next time you're hanging\nout with your crush,\nkeep an eye out for a quick\nhair-fix, a lipstick retouch,\na hidden shirt-fix, or\neven a breath check.\nIf you see these kinds of actions\nthey might have a thing for you.\nNumber four.\nSo many questions.\nNoah notices that spending\ntime with Kay is awesome.\nHe realizes that to keep her\nwanting to hang out with him,\nhe needs to know more about her.\nWhat she likes and her interests.\nAssumptions aren't going to fly.\nSo he asks questions,\nranging from the blunt,\nwhat's your favorite food queries,\nto subtle, so are you seeing\nthat new Marvel movie soon?\nThen watching for her reaction.\nAnd in the process,\nshe got to know more about\nhim without even knowing it.\nEssentially, we like it\nwhen we're cared for.\nWe may not spontaneously\ntalk about ourselves\nif we feel no one's listening.\nBut if someone genuinely\nasks, we'll enjoy sharing.\nAnd with great detail.\nNoah, or that crush of yours,\ncan really up the like factor,\nif they act on the information.\nLike getting you a baby Yoda,\nsince you gushed about \"Star Wars.\"\nOr they can make their\nfeelings even more obvious\nby adding a personal touch.\nNumber five.\nThey create intimacy with personal gifts.\nKay realizes that Noah's\nbirthday is coming up.\nA generic store-bought\ncard feels impersonal.\nMaybe a dinner, no, no, too serious.\nIt's gotta be special, but not too much.\nAha, Kay remembers that\none anime Noah loves.\nSo she draws his favorite character\nposing with an anime version of Noah.\nShe even frames and wraps it.\nNoah opens the gift and his\njaw just about hit the floor.\nIn fact, hey, are those tears?\nYeah, she got him in the feels.\nKay is good.\nNoah mentally adds up all the signs.\nPlus, this cherry-on-top gift,\nthat required significant\nthought and effort.\nHe knows, he's just got to ask her out.\nHand-making gifts is a great\nway to create a strong bond.\nIn Noah and Kay's situation,\nshe made something tailor-made to Noah\nand the purpose was\nsolely for him to love it.\nBonus.\nDo you wanna give your\ncrush a personal gift\nbut you're not too good at\narts and crafts or drawings?\nWell, another alternative is,\nyou can give them a knitted item,\nlike a nice cozy sweater or a blanket.\nAccording to a 2015 study\nspecifically on knitted items,\nwhen the item is something\nheld close to the body,\nlike a sweater or blanket,\nthis item is seen as loving or kind.\nWhen the item is something\nnot personally used,\nmaybe a pot holder,\nit's viewed as old-fashioned and thrifty.\nEnd scene.\nThanks for the\nparticipation, Noah and Kay.\nWe know it was obvious to us\nthat Noah and Kay had that attraction,\nbut it's not so easy to see the forest\nwhen you're in amongst the trees.\nAm I right?\nHave you been there?\nWhat other signs can you think of\nthat might indicate more than friends?\nAnything you're wondering about?\nPlease comment and discuss.\nMaybe you'll even do a meet cute here.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you soon."
