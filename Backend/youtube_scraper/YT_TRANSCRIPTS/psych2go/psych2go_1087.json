    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nAh, love, it's by far one\nof the most sought-after\ntreasures since the dawning of emotion.\nAnd we mean romantic,\nforever, partner kind of love,\nbut we can often mistake\ndifferent kinds of bonds\nor comradery as love,\nwhich can set us up for a\nwhole world of heartbreak,\nand sometimes embarrassment.\nSo, to help you figure\nout what love is not,\ncome on over to our knowledge vault.\nOpening up, here we go.\nNo talking for a few weeks?\nNo problem.\nWe're not encouraging clingy,\nsmothering, rapid-fire,\nwhere-are-you, who-are-you-with,\nwhat-are-you-doing texts\nevery few seconds.\nAt the same time, if you\nare in love with someone,\nyou will at least want to\nhear from them regularly.\nIf you find yourself breathing\na little sigh of relief\nwhen they don't respond to your texts,\nor they've been mysteriously\nsilent for days on end\nand you either shrug\nit off or don't notice,\nyou're likely not in love.\nBeing in love is a pretty intense emotion,\nso feeling super nonchalant\nor avoidant doesn't fit.\nNumber two, you are consistently venting\nto others about them.\nYay, we're not perfect.\nWe all mess up, messed up and blunder.\nOnce in a while, that's normal\nand expected and can even be healthy\nas an avenue to learn something\nnew about your partner.\nIf being outright irritated\nwith them is the norm,\nthat's different.\nThink about when you talk about them\nwith your friends and family.\nIs it usually pretty even,\npeppered with mundanely positive things\nlike, the store was so busy.\nGood thing they're really\ngood at parallel barking.\nIt was the last spot.\nOr, is the bulk of the\nconversation always,\nI can't believe they did this.\nWhat were they thinking?\nHow can they always be so inconsiderate?\nI could just scream right now!\nIf the occasional\nventing becomes constant,\nfrequent and consistent complaining,\nlove just might have exited the building.\nNumber three, you don't enjoy\nbeing around them anymore.\nBe honest with yourself,\ndo you feel relief when they cancel dates?\nDoes being with them feel like work?\nEven if you're someone who\nnormally likes your alone time,\nyou would still normally enjoy\nbeing around your partner,\nor at least feel some comfort in it.\nYou'd wanna share meaningful\nmoments with them.\nWe get it, though, you are\nnot clones of each other\nand you might wanna catch up\non the latest Marvel movie\nwith your Marvel fan friends\ninstead of your partner\nwho prefers period dramas.\nThat's all good.\nWhat's not all good?\nWhen you'd rather be\nalone without your partner\nor with other people for all the outings.\nYou could keep saying, well,\ntheir interests are different,\nwhich happens, but if it gets to a point\nwhere your interests diverge so much\nthat there's nothing in common,\nlove may not be the\nemotion you're feeling.\nNumber four, telling them\nyou love them feels fake.\nAre the words \"I love\nyou\" stuck in your throat\nbecause you really feel that\nway and want to tell them,\nbut you're scared of what they'll say?\nSure, you could be in\nlove but feel insecure.\nOr, does \"I love you\"\ncome out feeling forced?\nDoes it feel like an obligatory payment\nin exchange for your partners saying it\nor from outside pressures?\nIf the words feel rough coming out\nbecause you don't really feel\nit, you're likely not in love.\nAnd number five, honesty\nfeels conditional.\nSure, you'll be honest with them\nabout little things and only\nwhere there's a common like.\nThey like chocolate chip meant ice cream\nand so do you, so you'll\nhappily talk about that.\nBut you like sappy romcoms,\nwhereas they hate them\nand like action movies,\nso you only see action movies.\nMaybe you a Star Trek fan\nand you think Star Wars is overrated,\nbut you won't tell them that.\nHiding even the little things means\nyou feel you can't be\nyourself around them,\nwhich is definitely not a sign\nof being in love with a person.\nIf you feel you can't be\nyou around your partner,\nhow could it truly be love?\nLove in all its forms is\none of the major drivers\nthat lets us be and feel our best.\nLove has created healers and\nenabled major discoveries.\nIt's powerful.\nForget the gold rush,\nwhat about the love rush?\nUnfortunately, we often want it so badly,\nwe're willing to deal with pyrite,\nalso known as fool's gold,\nand took ourselves into\nthinking it's the real thing.\nBe better to yourself and\nto the person you're with.\nWe deserve love in its\nmost real, pure form.\nDon't settle for a knockoff.\nDo you have questions\nabout any of the points?\nWhat are your experiences?\nDiscuss, comment, and share.\nEven if you're not in love with us,\nyou can like us by\nclicking on that button.\nThanks so much, and we'll see you soon."
