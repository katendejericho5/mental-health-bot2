    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you have a sneaking suspicion\nthat a particular person likes you?\nAnd yes, in that like like kind of way?\nBut wait, does the thought\nof being completely wrong\nhold you back?\nYou just don't know how to be sure,\nas it can be super embarrassing\nin case you were mistaken.\nWhen someone likes you,\nthey often act differently around you\nthan they do with other people.\nIt's all in an attempt\nto seek some form of validation\nor approval from you.\nHow sweet?\nAnd they have many different\nways to go about it too.\nSome overly obvious, and\nothers entirely too subtle.\nSo here are some things\none will definitely do\nwhen they really like\nlike that special someone.\nNumber one, the social media stalk.\nThis is a big one.\nSay you meet at a party,\nyou add each other on social media.\nA few days pass,\nand you still haven't heard\na word from their end.\nHow could this be?\n(notification beeping)\nA notification pops up.\nThey like to photo of yours\nfrom four summers ago.\nWhoops.\nWhile you were waiting for\nwhat seemed like an eternity,\nthey were busy searching you up.\nWhere?\nOn every single social media platform.\nThey're going through all of your posts,\njust to get a better idea of who you are.\nIf they're really interested,\nthey'll wanna know more about you\nbefore sending that first text.\nWhile waiting,\nit's not a bad idea to\nthink of a few jokes\nyou can send back their way, once they do.\nOr have a stockpile of GIFs prepared.\nThose who GIF together, stay together?\nNumber two, obsessively\nre-reading your texts.\nSpeaking of texting,\nwhen someone likes you,\nthey may struggle to not be\nsuper obsessive about it.\nWhat's the proper amount of time to wait\nbefore texting back?\nDo they seem to have memorized\nall 11,997 text messages\nyou've sent back and forth to each other\nover the last two months?\nIf they're unsure how you feel about them,\nthey may go to the very start,\nand re-read every single message.\nThey may wanna track the\nnarrative arc of your connection.\nWhen someone likes you,\nthey may double or triple\ncheck the messages sent\nback and forth.\nIs that little ... notification\ndriving you totally mad,\nas you wait for them to respond?\nOnly for them to type nothing?\nIf they replied to quickly,\nthey may be worried\nthat they're coming off\ntoo needy or overbearing.\nAlthough if they reply too late,\nyou might find yourself losing interest.\nThey may text back almost immediately\nbecause they don't want\nyou to be kept waiting.\nIf you write in short, quick bursts,\nand they really like you,\nthey'll probably write\nback in the same exact way.\nNumber three, copy your speech\npatterns and mannerisms.\nDo you have keywords or catch phrases\nthat you say all the time?\nHave they started saying them too?\nIf you talk a lot with your hands,\ndo they now gesticulate\nwidely back to you?\nIf a person really, really likes you,\nthey may seize every opportunity\nto be in your company.\nAnd it's natural for them to\nwanna spend more time with you.\nIf, okay, a lot of time with you.\nAnd the more time they spend with you,\nthe more likely it is that\nthey'll start mirroring you.\nThey're probably going to start speaking\nin a similar rhythm and cadence.\nAs the saying goes,\n\"Imitation is the sincerest\nform of flattery.\"\nNumber four, trying too\nhard in your friend circle.\nWhat is a big hurdle,\nif not the biggest one they have to pass\nif someone really likes you, your friends.\nI mean, yeah, your\nclosest group of friends\nknow everything about you.\nThey've probably known you\nfor a longer time period,\nand your social media and texting history\ncan only tell a person so much.\nIf a person likes you,\nthey'll want your\nfriends to like them too.\nHanging out as a group in a social setting\ncan be really beneficial for this reason.\nThey are more receptive to your friends\nwhen they are recalling mutual\nadventures from the past.\nThey ask your friends a\nton of questions about you.\nIf they come off as really awkward\nin front of the group at first,\nthat's not necessarily a bad thing.\nThey might just be super nervous.\nBut if the other person\nputs in the effort to listen\nto those around you, that's a good thing.\nAnd number five, they do things you like\nthat they have zero interest in.\nDo you enjoy quietly looking\nat artwork in museums,\nor strolling casually through the park\non a bright sunny day?\nOr is it more of an intense jog?\nIf someone really likes you,\nthey're also more likely\nto join in on activities\nthat they don't normally\npartake in otherwise.\nTake exercise for example.\nAre you often getting out there\nand working on that cardio?\nDoes the other person never\ngo for an intense run,\nor even a casual jog?\nIf someone likes you,\nthey may be more likely to say yes\nto do something like this,\neven when they're not used\nto such physical exertion,\nthey wanna share your interests.\nWhen they're going way far outta\ntheir comfort zone for you,\nthat says a lot about them.\nAttraction is often complicated.\nRelationships can\nsometimes be even messier.\nSigns that someone likes you\ncan be very confusing for sure.\nSignals can also be misinterpreted.\nHow one person reacts to a situation\ncould be totally different\nfrom how you would yourself.\nIf you are the one\nwho's obsessively checking\nthe other person's socials,\nand re-reading their\ntexts, it's totally okay.\nYou are not alone.\nJust try to avoid accidentally liking\none of their old vacation\nphotos from four summers ago.\nDo you know someone in your life\nwho's exhibited any of\nthe signs mentioned here?\nOr on the flip side, have\nyou exhibited any of them?\nFeel free to leave a comment\nwith your experiences,\nfeedback, or suggestions.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the lake
