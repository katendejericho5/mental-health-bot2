    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych-2-goers,\nhave you ever wondered\nwhether your relationship with\nsomeone is just friendship,\nkindness or something more?\nYou're probably well acquainted\nwith the frustration that\ncomes along with this.\nSometimes, overthinking\nabout a person's actions\nleads to headaches and\neven more confusion.\nSo to help, this video lists\nseven signs someone likes you\nbut is afraid of admitting it.\nHope it helps.\nOh, by the way, one more thing.\nWe have a treat for you\nat the end of this video,\nif you wanna get more involved with us.\nLet's begin.\nNumber one, they make you\nfeel like someone special.\nIt's no secret that\nwhen a person likes you\nthey act differently around you.\nDo they light up more when\nthey're talking to you?\nDo they go out of their\nway to create interaction?\nWhen someone likes you, chances are\nthere are ways it will show,\neven if they're afraid to admit it to you.\nIf you're unsure, try\nlooking at the small details.\nAre they acting in a way\nthat makes you feel like\nthey care for you more than others?\nIf so, it's good to consider the chance\nthat they might have feelings for you.\nNumber two, they want you to meet those\nwho are important to them.\nHave they introduced you\nto their friends, parents\nor even pets?\nA person who likes you\nnaturally wants you to be\na part of their life.\nEven if they're afraid of\nadmitting how they feel,\nthis method gives them a\nchance to connect with you more\nand build a deeper relationship.\nOf course, not everyone who does this\nmeans that they have feelings for you.\nHowever, when a person\ndoes this out of the blue\nor if they do it together\nwith the other signs mentioned\nin this video, there is a good chance\nthat they like you and\nare afraid to admit it.\nNumber three, they either\ncompliment you or tease you a lot,\nsometimes even both.\nDo they often attempt to flatter you?\nDo they joke around and tease you\nbut still manage to remain friendly?\nThere is a line between playful teasing\nand outright insulting.\nSo if they somehow find a way to tease you\nwhile remaining your friend,\nthey're just probably\nlooking for a way to get your attention.\nWhen someone is afraid of\nadmitting their feelings\nthey tend to find other\nways to communicate them.\nSo if they constantly drop compliments\nor do stuff that turns\nyour head their way,\nthey might just be waiting\nfor you to get the hint.\nNumber four, somehow you see them a lot.\nThis relates to the third point.\nWhen they compliment, tease\nor find ways to be around you,\neven if they have no reason to\nbe there in the first place,\nthey're basically screaming\n\"I want you to notice me\".\nDo they find ways to hang out\nwith you and your friends?\nIs their voice becoming a regular thing\nyou hear almost every day?\nA person who has feelings\nfor you most likely\nwants you to think about them a lot.\nAnd that's why they wanna\nbe involved in your life\nas much as possible.\nNumber five, they insinuate\njokes about you being together.\nDo they sometimes say flirty\nthings that they pass off\nas a joke, or something along those lines?\nWhenever they do this, they're most likely\ntesting the waters.\nIf they see a good reaction,\ntheir confidence will probably go up.\nThere's a lot of anxiety that\ncomes with liking someone.\nAnd as much as it's good\nto confess their feelings\ncompletely, they may also get\nthe urge to protect themselves\nfrom the hurt or rejection.\nNumber six, they ask for\nassistance from others.\nDo you notice their friends\nor other people making it\nobvious that they like you?\nIf someone who likes you\nis too scared to tell you\nthemselves, they may ask\nfor help from other people\nto tell you for them.\nOf course, there is nothing better\nthan open, honest communication.\nSo if you notice that\nthey're doing their best\nto show their feelings, it might\nbe time to have a good chat\nabout it.\nAnd number seven, they do\neverything but confess.\nHave they done everything in this video\nexcept talk to you about\ntheir true feelings?\nPerhaps it's because\nthey're waiting for you\nto bring it up first.\nYou may mistake someone's\nfriendly affection\nfor something more.\nHowever, your intuition\nis also not something\nyou can just ignore.\nDo they act more romantic than friendly?\nAre their actions starting to make you\nthink about how they feel?\nIf you're starting to get these thoughts\nit's good to talk it out\nwith the other person.\nIt may even save you a lot\nof time and frustration\nand who knows, maybe you're\neven helping them out\na great deal by doing so.\nDo you have a certain someone in your life\nwho acts this way?\nDid this video give you any clarity?\nIt's good to remember that\nthere are a lot of factors\nthat go into someone confessing\nor choosing to hide their feelings.\nWhatever it is, it's good to\nremain understanding and true\nto what you feel as well.\nIf you have experiences with confessing,\nbeing confessed too, and the like\nyou can always share them in\nthe comment section below.\nWe always appreciate hearing\nabout your experiences.\nThanks for sticking\nwith us to the very end.\nAre you looking for ways\nto make extra income?\nGiven the current state of the economy\nand how difficult it is to
