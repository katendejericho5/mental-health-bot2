    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you ever\nbeen labeled as awkward,\nor snobbish, but really you\njust feel tense around people?\nIf so, you may be shy\nand not really awkward.\nWhile it's true that shyness\nand social awkwardness\nmay have characteristics that overlap,\nthere are some key differences\nthat set them apart.\nTo learn more about this,\nhere are six signs you're\nshy, not socially awkward.\nNumber one.\nYou feel uncomfortable around strangers.\nDo you tense up when you're in\nthe presence of someone new?\nPerhaps you clam up and\nfind it hard to speak.\nPeople who are shy often feel nervous\nand uncomfortable around strangers.\nWhile those who are socially awkward,\nmight also feel the same way,\nthey're not limited to\nfeelings of discomfort,\nas they may also have\ndifficulty reading social cues.\nFor example, they may be outgoing\nand have a lot of things to say,\nbut come off as a little\nweird, quirky, or even aloof.\nShy people on the other hand,\ntend to be tense and\nawkward just at the start\nand willing to gradually open up\nand come out of their shell in time.\nNumber two.\nYou don't like unfamiliarity.\nIs it nerve wracking for you\nto speak in front of a crowd,\nfor the first time,\nor think about how your first\nday of school will be like?\nPeople who are shy might\nnot enjoy new environments\nas they often find comfort,\nholed up in their rooms,\nor in the company of\npeople they already know.\nThey can be less open\nthan outgoing people,\nbut deep inside they also recognize\nthe necessity of doing things\ndespite their discomfort.\nThis aversion to unfamiliarity,\ncan also make them seem uninterested\nor bored in new situations,\nbut don't be fooled, shy\npeople aren't completely\nagainst meeting new people,\nor venturing into new places.\nThey'd just rather dip their\ntoes first into something new,\nrather than jump straight into it.\nSocially awkward people\nmay also feel this way,\nbut not as much as those who are shy.\nNumber three.\nYour parents are shy too.\nDo you ever wonder if you've\ncarried over the traits\nof your biological parents?\nSurprisingly, genetics may play a role\nin whether you're shy or not.\nAccording to a report published by\nNemour's Children's Health,\nup to 20% of people have genes\nthat dictate their shyness.\nHowever, it's also important to note\nthat while your level of shyness\ncan be influenced by genetics,\nit's also possible for\nsome people to develop\na shy temperament, depending\non their life experiences.\nNumber four.\nYou had negative past experiences.\nDid you go through a life\ndefining experience in the past,\nthat changed who you are?\nIt's possible that your\nnegative experiences\nin the past have led you to become shy.\nMaybe you were always\nthe new kid at school\nand had trouble making friends,\nor maybe you had a\nfriend that betrayed you\nand so are more cautious in\nfinding genuine connections.\nThe source of your shyness\nmay not even necessarily\nstem from one event, but a\nculmination of many small events.\nOn the other hand,\nwhile social awkwardness can also stem\nfrom past experiences, it\ntends to manifest differently.\nInstead of remaining reserved\nand quiet, like shy people\nsocially awkward individuals\nmay do other things\nlike overshare in a discussion,\nor overreact inappropriately.\nNumber five.\nWith friends you can be\nthe life of the party.\nBeing shy doesn't mean you can't\nhave fun with your friends.\nIn fact, when you're around\npeople you know well,\nyou might be a natural conversationalist\nand can go on chatting for hours.\nIn contrast, people\nwith social awkwardness\ntend to act the same\nway around all people,\nregardless of how well they know them.\nThey may not find it difficult to chat\nwith a friend who they already know,\nbut they may bring up topics\nthat would strike others as strange,\nor not know when to end a conversation.\nAnd number six.\nYou're selective with who\nyou let into your life.\nDoes it take a while for\nyou to warm up to someone?\nIt's not that shy people\ndon't wanna make friends,\nit's just that they're more selective\nwith who they let into their lives.\nShy individuals are often very choosy\nabout the people they talk to\nand the situations they put themselves in.\nThey like to take their time\nin getting to know a person\nbefore completely opening up to them.\nSocially awkward people on the other hand,\ndon't necessarily follow the same rules.\nThey may talk to people indiscriminately,\nor be friends with everyone they meet.\nSo, which one do you relate to the most?\nAre you socially awkward, or just shy?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to
