    "transcript": "- [Narrator] There's been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nStay tuned and thanks for\nbeing a part of our journey.\nWho hasn't watched at\nleast one movie or show\nwhere the smart one peaks your interest?\nFrom Sherlock Holmes to Shikamaru Nara,\nthe highly intelligent\nhave been sought after.\nThe aloof, intelligent person\nwho unwittingly captivates\nthe hearts of people around them\nis a popular drop in films.\nDespite that, they're also often depicted\nas being incredibly unlucky in love.\nAnd this doesn't only happen in movies\nbut also in real life.\nBut why?\nHere are six reasons why\nhighly intelligent people\nstruggle with love.\nNumber one, they overthink.\nWhen it comes to the\npopular notion of love,\nwe tend to think of feeling what's right\nand just following your heart\ninto this sweet mist of romance.\nAnd there's absolutely no way\nthat an intelligent person is going\nto stumble around blindly.\nThey're gonna analyze the details\nand compare the information\nto trusted standards\nbefore they make a big decision.\nIs it great for data? Yes.\nIs it wise for the long-term? Yeah.\nIs it good for enticing\nand starting a passionate relationship?\nNot quite.\nIt can be exasperating for some,\nleading them to mistake\nthe time taken to analyze\nmeans for disinterest on the\npart of the intelligent person.\nIn a tragic irony,\nthe intelligent person means the opposite.\nBy taking this time to\nstudy, plan, and review,\nthey're deeming their love\ninterest as worthy and desirable.\nThat analytical effort is\nto ensure a best chance\nof success for the relationship.\nIf there is no interest\nor a low valuation,\nthey wouldn't bother.\nNumber two, they love their independence.\nThis is one of the problems\nwith the Hollywoodized version of love.\nIt's this whole, \"You\ncomplete me\", concept\nimplying someone is less of a person\nif they don't find that other half.\nIt encourages co-dependence\nand indirectly derides self-sufficiency.\nHighly intelligent\npeople are usually secure\nin who they are and already feel whole.\nThey don't require another\nperson to complete the picture.\nThey feel another person\ncould add to the picture\nand make it better.\nThis can be interpreted by others as,\n\"This person just doesn't want me.\"\nIn truth, this just means\nthat they don't unnecessarily\nburden their partner.\nFor example, the intelligent\nperson understands\ntheir happiness is their\nown responsibility,\nnot their partners.\nNumber three, they prioritize their goals.\nThis doesn't mean that\nthey think their goals\nare more important than their partners.\nIt just means that they get things done.\nThey won't be halfway to a goal\nthen abandon it suddenly to\nget swept into a romance.\nThey can also see that some goals\nrequire a lot of attention and time,\nwhich means that relationships\nwould have to be put\non the back burner until the goal is done.\nThey may not wanna have\nrelationships at all\nuntil they've crossed the finish line.\nIntelligent people rather be single\nthan have a partner who\nis not of the same mindset\nor is impatient,\nbecause they don't wanna\nend up in an unsupportive\nand bitter situation.\nNumber four, they have high standards.\nWell, high in itself is\na fairly subjective term,\nbut suffice to say,\nmost intelligent individuals\nwill have some pretty definite standards.\nThey're usually demanding\nmore of themselves\nand as such, they'll usually\nhave pretty strong boundaries\nand a definite standard for their partner.\nAlthough the standard can have\nsome small adjustments as they mature,\nit never does a nose dive.\nThey'd usually prefer\nsurfing through life solo\nthan settling for a\nsubstandard relationship.\nNumber five, they think with their heads,\nbut not their gut.\nThe intelligent person\ntends to lean very heavily\non the cold logic, you know, like Spock.\nThey won't even follow a gut instinct\nif they can't suss out the\nbits of evidence or clues\nthat contribute to it.\nSo, when it comes to falling in love,\nthe intelligent person often\nwill hit the breaks asking,\n\"Wait, why do I feel this way?\"\nThey might mentally go through\nall of their favorite movies\nand consider any influences in their life\nto try to find a reason.\nThey'll likely then analyze to see\nif those influences provide good proof.\nThen, they'll consider\nmaking their first move.\nAs you can imagine, it's\nnot exactly the smoothest\nor timeliest of ways to get passionate.\nAnd number six, they are single by choice.\nTogether with being in harmony, happiness,\nand peace with themselves,\nthis means they aren't\ndesperately seeking someone else\nto fulfill their basic needs\nor to help them figure out who they are.\nThey have the luxury of already\nhaving a good time on their own\nand coming up with new ways to do so.\nAt the far end of the spectrum,\nsometimes they just can't find someone\nwho they feel will add to their world\nso they choose to be with the one person\nwho truly gets them,\nthemselves.\nLove, in and of itself\nhas so many aspects,\nbut we, in general, tend\nto be heavily influenced\nby how it's depicted in media\nand build our ideals of how\nit's supposed to happen on that.\nUnfortunately, those that don't follow\nthat particular popular format\ntend to struggle.\nNext time that cute geek\nis awkward around you,\nconsider that it might be a\ncompliment to your worthiness.\nWhich point can you relate to?\nWhat insights have you clinged?\nDoes something that's been\nhappening make more sense now?\nWe'd love for you to discuss\nand expand your mind.\nAnd also intelligently,\nhit that like button.\nThanks for watching and see you soon.\n(light music)"
