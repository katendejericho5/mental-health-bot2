    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWe are talking about relationships today.\nSometimes, people can get stuck\nin super toxic relationships,\nbut not realize it\nuntil after they're out.\nThese relationships can drain you,\nand make you feel like\na shell of yourself.\nNo matter what your\nrelationship status is,\nit's really important to know\nwhat a strong healthy\nrelationship looks and feels like.\nAre you curious if your\nrelationship is a strong one?\nWe're going to explore eight things\nthat strong relationships have in common.\nLet's go.\nNumber one, you can openly\ncommunicate with your partner.\nLet's start at the beginning.\nYou meet someone and wanna get\nto know them a little better.\nHow do you do that?\nYou communicate.\nYou talk about your likes and\ndislikes, interests, hobbies,\nand you ask them the same\nto get to know them better.\nThat shouldn't stop\nonce you're actually in\nthe relationship though.\nWhen you're in a strong relationship,\nyou should be able to discuss\nanything with your partner.\nWhen you're in a strong relationship,\nnot only can you talk about\nthese things with your partner,\nbut they can also come to\nyou with anything as well.\nNumber two, you're an\nindividual in a relationship,\nyou are not the relationship.\nWhen you get in a new relationship,\ndo you take on a whole new persona?\nDo you stop doing things you like?\nStop hanging out with your friends?\nDo you start picking up habits and hobbies\nthat your partner likes, but you don't?\nThis is a sign of an\nunhealthy relationship.\nWhen in a relationship,\ndropping everything in\nyour life for your partner\ncan be a sign of an\nunhealthy attachment style.\nIn a strong relationship,\nyou should still be you.\nThat's why they liked\nyou in the first place.\nBoth individuals should still\nmaintain their own identity\nwhile creating couple\nlikes and hobbies to share.\nNumber three, you respect one another.\nRespect does not equal agreement.\nYou are not required to\nagree with your partner,\nor their opinions 100% of the time,\nbut you do need to respect\nthem and their opinions.\nOther ways you can show\nrespect in a relationship\nare listening to each other,\nforgiving each other for small mistakes,\nmaking room in your life for them\nwhile still allowing them\nto be their own person,\nand respecting their boundaries.\nDoing these things\nwill ensure your partner\nfeels loved and cared for,\nand it'll help strengthen\nthe relationship.\nNumber four, you show\naffection to each other.\nHow do you like to be shown affection?\nHow does your partner like affection?\nIs it an of service, like preparing lunch,\nor maybe physical touch?\nHow does your partner like\nto be shown, they matter?\nIf you're curious about you or\nyour partner's love language,\ncheck out our breakdown of\nthe five love languages.\nOnce you figure it out, try it out,\nand notice how your partner responds.\nNumber five, you support each other.\nHave you ever been in a relationship,\nwhere your partner downplayed\nyour accomplishments?\nMaybe you've been in a relationship,\nwhere your partner needs\nto one up your achievement?\nThis is a sign of a toxic relationship.\nIn a strong relationship,\nyou support your partner,\nand are their biggest cheerleader.\nYou want them to achieve their goals.\nThis support helps to build\na strong relationship.\nNumber six, you are\ncommitted to each other\nand the relationship.\nCommitment, there are two sides of it.\nOn one side, you have\npeople who seek commitment\nas being tied down, or the fun being over.\nOn the other hand, you\nsee people who feel joy\nand a sense of belonging\nthrough commitment.\nA 2014 study on relationships\nfound that the individuals,\nwho saw commitment positively,\nwere more satisfied and\nhad stronger relationships.\nThat commitment and unwavering\ncare for your partner\ncreates a strong bond of\nsecurity in the relationship,\nsince a lot of insecurities are relieved.\nNumber seven, you both\nhave mutual hobbies.\nNow this may seem contrary\nto our earlier point,\nbut we said to keep\nyour own identity, yes,\nbut it is absolutely healthy and normal\nto pick up hobbies that\nyou both like doing.\nKeyword, both.\nIf your partner is a huge\ngym person and you are not,\nyou may not wanna join\nthem on their 5:00 AM run,\nfollowed by a one hour\nweight lifting session.\nTalk to your partner to see\nwhat interests of theirs\nline up with yours.\nIt could help create some\ngood bonding time for you two,\nto help strengthen the relationship.\nAnd number eight, you both\ncontribute to the relationship.\nRelationships are always two way streets,\nno matter what you're talking about.\nNo one person should always be giving,\nand no one person should always be taking.\nNow, contribution isn't\nnecessarily always the same.\nIt could be contributing love, money,\nyour abilities, or talents.\nCan you count on your\npartner as your teammate?\nIf so, you're probably\nin a strong relationship.\nDid these signs make you think\nof that special someone in your life?\nNo matter your relationship status,\nwe hope this list got\nyou thinking a little bit\nabout your current or next relationship,\nand how you can better yourself\nto be a strong part of a healthy one.\nDid you find this video
