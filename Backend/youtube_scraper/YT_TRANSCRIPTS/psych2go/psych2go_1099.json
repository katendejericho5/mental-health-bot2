    "transcript": "- [Narrator] You've probably\nheard, live long and prosper,\nthe famous salute from \"Star Trek.\"\nYour lifespan may seem beyond your control\nbut identifying and giving\nup some common toxic habits\ncan have psychological improvements,\nwhich can allow you to be\nhappier and live longer.\nWith that said, here are\nsix habits to give up\nif you wanna be happy and live long.\nNumber one, blaming the world around you.\nWhen we're frustrated, it can\nbe a common defense mechanism\nfor us to blame the subject\nwe're trying to learn\nrather than accepting that some things\nare just more difficult than others,\nand we may need to take\nthe time to learn and grow.\nBlaming others, the world around us,\nand other factors such as luck or chance\ntakes the weight off our shoulders.\nBut when we never accept responsibility,\nwe make it easy to\nexcuse our lack of action\nor change in ourselves.\nIt's always easy to blame somebody else\nand leave our self-esteem\nand self image intact.\nBut this can have long term consequences\nsetting goals for something\nyou want to achieve\ncan feel disheartening when\nit seems too hard to do,\ninstead of feeling that\nthe world is unfair,\ntry accepting the challenge\nthe world is offering.\nAnd even if you don't\nget it the first time,\nyou can always try again.\nNumber two, seeing yourself\nas your own worst enemy.\nBeing cruel and harsh to yourself\ncan be detrimental to your\nhappiness and lifespan.\nDo you call yourself horrible names\nor blame yourself for\neverything bad that happens?\nYou may try to berate or hurt\nyourself with these insults,\nor even go as far as to\nphysically harm yourself.\nIf you can imagine what it would be like\nfor you to do this to another person,\nyou may have some perspective\non why it's so hard\nto heal from these mistakes\nwhen we punish ourselves so harshly.\nAlthough this habit can\nrange from mild to severe,\nby showing yourself compassion\nand reaching out to health professionals,\nyou can find recovery and\nways to change this thinking.\nSelf-hatred can persist into\nself-destructive attitudes,\nwhich can push your\nhappiness even further,\nespecially if you feel as\nthough you don't deserve it.\nRemember that not only will you experience\nyour mistakes firsthand,\nbut also your greatest achievements too.\nForgive yourself and try\nto appreciate yourself\nfor the small things you do have.\nBeing thankful and\nshowing yourself gratitude\ncan go a long way.\nNumber three, repetitive\npessimistic thinking.\nAre you always thinking negatively\nand constantly getting down on yourself\nor the way you see the world?\nThis may be avoidant behavior,\nand negative thinking can affect\nthe way you chase your goals\nand stunt potentially happy\nor exciting opportunities.\nA study conducted by Philip Spinhoven,\nAlbert M. Van Hemert,\nand Brenda W. Pennix,\nhas shown that repeated negative thinking\nis strongly associated with\nanxiety and depression,\nalong with relapses of preexisting anxiety\nand depression episodes.\nMake a point to try and think positive\nwhen things are difficult,\nor seek out happy things that inspire you\nto work hard towards your goals.\nUsing reaffirming statements,\nto reaffirm yourself\nthat you are in control of your thinking,\nwhich can help inspire mindfulness.\nNumber four, neglecting your sleep\nand ignoring your body's needs.\nAs much as taking care of your\nmental health is beneficial,\ntaking care of your body's\nneeds is half the battle.\nInterrupting your body's natural processes\nfor something that may\nseem like a good idea,\njust might come back to haunt you.\nSometimes it can feel as though\nyou only have so many hours\nin the day, so much to\ndo yet so little time,\nwhy not stay up late to enjoy\njust a few more episodes\nbefore tomorrow, or maybe get\na few extra study hours in,\nwhile this can seem relatively harmless,\ndisrupting your body's internal clock\ncan cause issues with memory retention\nand interrupt your productivity.\nRepeating this process\nmultiple times a week\ncan cause an increased amount of issues.\nSo, before you go to bed,\nyou may find it helpful\nto turn off your lights,\nunplug your internet, shut your phone off,\nor even listen to music\nto help fall asleep.\nClearing your mind of distractions\nfor a good night's sleep\ncan help you feel\nrecharged in the morning.\nNumber five, thinking of\nothers and not yourself.\nHave you been giving your\nattention to others lately,\nlike chatting or texting\naway on your phone\nand before you know it\nit's already time to\npack it in for the night?\nIt can be very easy to fall\ninto a habit of helping others\nwithout taking any time\nto take care of yourself\nor your priorities.\nMaybe you feel obligated\nto constantly give your friends a hand,\nand that project you\nhave isn't that important\nand you can finish it later, right?\nLetting others into your\nschedule at all times\nto help them can be\ndisruptive to your own tasks,\ngoals, and desires.\nThere is nothing wrong with\nlending someone at hand\nwhen they need it, but\nit can sometimes feel\nlike you're giving\neveryone the time, love,\nand attention they need, but yourself.\nReassuring yourself that you\ndeserve to aim for your goals\nand giving yourself the\ntime that you give to others\ncan open up more time and\npossibilities throughout your day.\nTry to schedule a little bit of me time,\ntake yourself out on a date,\nbuy yourself a small treat\nthat you've been craving,\nor have a bit of dedicated\nalone time with a book,\ngame or movie you've been dying to see.\nAnd number six, repeatedly giving up.\nWhen we face adversity, such\nas rejection, humiliation,\nor setbacks, we may feel\nlike just giving up.\nGiving up can be different\nfrom person to person.\nMaybe you wanna stop your education\nor never give love a try.\nYou might stop seeing doctors\nor feel unmotivated or uncaring,\nlike you've done all that you can do.\nWorking within your abilities\nand not giving up on\nyourself and your happiness\nmay just improve the way\nyou can handle hardships.\nYou may just find it helpful\nto journal about your success\nand about the things that\nmaybe didn't go so well.\nSo when you feel like you've been failing\nyou can revisit some of your best moments\nif you write them down.\nRemembering your purpose and\nreason for doing something\nor working towards something\ncan help keep your goals in perspective.\nAnd remember all the successes you've had\nwhen things seem bleak.\nCan you identify with\nany of the habits listed?\nAre you able to identify the habits\nthat you may be falling into,\nand find a way to combat them.\nLet us know in the comments,\nwe'd love to hear your story.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\nplease share it with\nothers who might benefit\nand let them know you're there for them.\nThe references and studies\nare listed in the description below.\nUntil next time, live long\nand prosper, psych2goers."
