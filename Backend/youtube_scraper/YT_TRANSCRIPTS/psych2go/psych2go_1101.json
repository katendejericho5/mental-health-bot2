    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nIs it the highs of the\nhoneymoon period wearing off\nor maybe you are about to\nbegin a new relationship?\nYou're bound to wonder and\nyou are sure to ponder.\nWow, did that just rhyme?\nAnyways, where, oh yes,\nis your partner the one?\nAnd no you're not alone.\nIt's only natural for one\nto have second thoughts\nwhen you think about the long run.\nYou were in love and that\ncan make it hard for you\nto see why you two don't\nwork as a we anymore.\nIt can even occur way down the road\nwhen you're beginning to\nsettle in for the ride\nthat is life.\nIt can be emotionally jarring\nto even contemplate a breakup\nas you may still love the person.\nBut when the realization\nthat you don't have a\nfuture together sets in,\nit's all the more important\nto make the right decision.\nHere are seven signs they are not the one.\nNumber one, they want you to change.\nHave they made a list of things\nthey would like to change about you?\nIf any such list exists,\neven in imagination,\nchances are they're not the one for you.\nIt said love change is one for the better.\nBut if that change has to be enforced\nrather than a gradual naturalness,\nit sure does leave\nsomething to be desired.\nEveryone wants to be\nloved and appreciated.\nThe right partner should\nbring out the best in you,\nnot change the very you of you.\nIf they're not comfortable\nwith the funny, awkward,\nclumsy real you, it calls\nfor some serious review.\nNumber two, you can't count on them.\nAre you a go getter?\nIn this day and age, self-reliance\ncomes with the territory.\nBut at the end of the day,\nit feels good to know your\npartner's got your back.\nAs adults you each have\nyour own path to tread.\nStill you look for a\npartner you can rely on\nin times when your path is not so smooth.\nIt's difficult to find\nmotivation sometimes.\nAnd it makes all the difference to know\nthat the one beside\nyou is cheering you on.\nSo it does beg the question,\nwill they be there for you\nwhen you need them the most?\nNumber three, you have different values.\nDo they revere the same things as you?\nNow it is surely difficult\nfor two individuals\nto have completely the same taste,\nbut when it comes to the big questions,\nit's essential to be facing\nthe same direction at least.\nIt's difficult to stay on the same road\nif the destination isn't the same, right?\nRelationship experts recommend\ndiscussing major topics\nsuch as finances, intimacy, and others\nthoroughly and openly from the get go\nas they may become a major\ndeal breaker later on.\nIf the two of you don't see eye to eye\non things regarding marriage\nor kids for example,\nit will only break your heart\nthe longer you wait for them\nto come around to your ideals\nor for you to turn to theirs.\nIf your priorities don't match,\nchances are they won't\nallow you to match either.\nNumber four, they can hear but not listen.\nDoes it seem like you are the\nonly one making compromises?\nDo you have a hard time getting them\nto understand your perspective?\nCommunication is to a relationship,\nwhat sunshine is to a flower.\nIt's important for the\nones in a relationship\nto read their partner's emotions as well.\nThey should show a willingness\nto work on the relationship together.\nConflicts are a given for every couple,\nbut it's important to\nhave all hands on deck\nand work towards a solution.\nIf it takes all your effort\nto get the two of you\non the same page,\nit's possible they're not\nemotionally available.\nBrushing things under the rug\nis only a temporary solution.\nFor the long term,\nyour partner should not only\nlook out for your needs,\nas well but be willing to meet you halfway\nin all the efforts you put in.\nNumber five, your intuition.\nWhat does your gut feeling say about them?\nAre you constantly feeling\nlike something is off?\nOne of the first red\nflags in any relationship\nis when you begin to question\nyour relationship with them.\nYou have this gut feeling that\nsomething's just not right.\nMaybe you've already\nenvisioned that sparkling rock,\nor maybe you've already picked\nthat flowing mesh of white.\nBut the thought of the\nright one gives you pause.\nWhatever you feel for them\nis overshadowed by a sense of foreboding.\nNumber six, they are\nfond of 'You' statements.\n\"We're always late because of you.\nYou don't ever care how I feel.\"\nIs your partner always quick to criticize?\nAs witnessed, couples\nare more likely to engage\nin complaining behavior\nthan most others, right?\nBut is it constructive\nor corrosive criticism?\nThey leave you feeling hurt and rejected\nby using even honest mistakes\nto make negative judgements about you.\nThey always find a way to blame you\nfor the smallest inconvenience\nwithout even hearing\nyour side of the story.\nPsychologist John Gottman,\nwho has analyzed couples\nfor over four decades now\nfound that repeated critiques,\nberating another person's intentions\ncan soon cause relationships to derail.\nOn top of that, expressions of contempt\nsuch as sarcasm on a daily\nbasis can make it difficult\nfor the couple to lead the\nlife they always dreamed of.\nAnd number seven, your\nclose ones can tell.\nHas your best friend been\ntelling you to stop seeing them?\nDo your closest family members\nfeel like the two of you don't match?\nIt's very true that it is your life\nand you should get to make\nall the major decisions,\nbut often your close ones\ncan see what you fail\nto realize way before you do.\nYour friends and family are the ones\nwho have spent the longest time with you.\nThey're sure to know more about you\nand are always on the lookout for you.\nSo if they recommend you\nrevisit your decision,\nthere might be something\nthat struck them as odd.\nIt's wise to understand\nwhere they're coming from\nbefore striking them\nout as being too nosy.\nIt is highly possible for you\nto encounter such situations\nand even the most\nlongstanding of relationship.\nDoes that mean you're with the wrong one?\nNot at all.\nEvery couple is unique.\nThere are good days\nand then there are bad days.\nIf you can observe these\nscenarios occurring sparingly\nin response to particular events,\nthey're bound to go away with time.\nBut if you see a pattern\nforming too often,\nit might be time for you\nto have a little talk\nto figure things out.\nFor serious relationship issues,\nwe fully recommend seeking\nout a trained professional.\nFeel free to leave a
