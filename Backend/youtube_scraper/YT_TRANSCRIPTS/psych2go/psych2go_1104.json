    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nHealing is not easy.\nThere's a lot of stigma\nregarding going to therapy\nand doing any independent inner-self work.\nIt's still seen as something\nthat either weak or crazy people do,\nand that's just not true.\nIt might not be 100% easy,\nbut healing is a journey\nthat leads to deep fulfillment\nthat nothing outside of you\ncould shake or take away.\nThis process is very humbling,\nbut with high risk comes high reward.\nDuring this journey,\nyou will start to feel\nthe growing pains of change\nand self-integration.\nKeep moving forward.\nThis discomfort is helping\nyou move into a beautiful life\nin which you have a deeper\nsense of inner peace.\nHere are nine uncomfortable\nsigns that you are healing.\nNumber one, you allow yourself\nto feel your emotions.\nWhen you're still stuck in survival mode,\nyou are mostly focused\non logic and what you see\nbecause emotions are painful\nfor you to feel and process.\nIt's hard for you to take\nthe time and make room\nfor your emotions to just be\nacknowledged and validated\nbecause it reminds you of hurt\nthat you would've liked to keep buried.\nWhen you heal, you start\nacknowledging your negative\nand positive emotions because you realize\nthat extreme focus on one is\ndetrimental to your whole being\nand that you are a whole person.\nIt's uncomfortable at first,\nbut as you are no longer\nsuppressing or denying them,\nyou see the value of your\nemotions and feelings,\nand of just letting yourself sit with them\nand allowing them to pass.\nNumber two, you're getting better\nat expressing and maintaining boundaries.\nWhen you're not healed or in the process,\nyou struggle with stating\nand enforcing boundaries\nbecause you're afraid of\nrejection, feelings of shame\nand guilt from putting\nyour own interest first\nor saying what's on your mind.\nIt's unusual to set firm boundaries\nwhen you're not used to\nit, but once you start,\nit creates more healthy\ninterpersonal dynamics\nbecause you stated your\nopinions and emotions.\nYou have the mental and emotional clarity,\nand you are more capable of\nmaking your own decisions.\nNumber three, you accept\nthat you've been through\ndifficult experiences.\nLife is hard and unfair, and\ninstead of suppressing all\nof the experiences that\nyou have been through,\nyou acknowledge and\naccept that they happened.\nYou accept that these\npeople, places and things\nhad life-changing impact on\nyou and probably still do.\nOnce you have accepted that\nthese uncomfortable events\nimpacted you in their\nentirety, they actually start\nto hurt you less because\nyou've accepted the truth\nand are in charge of the\nnarrative of your life again.\nNumber four, you're less\nreactive and more responsive\nwhen you're in survival mode.\nEverything and everyone is a\nthreat and is treated as such.\nNothing is trusted, and\nyou don't have time to sit\nand logically think things through\nbecause you are pure action\nneeding to defend yourself constantly.\nOnce you start healing,\nyour natural response\nof lashing out, shutting\ndown, running away,\nor people pleasing is\ntested and slowly makes way\nfor questioning your feelings\nand reactions regarding things.\nYou even find yourself asking,\n\"Why do I think this way?\n\"Where does this thinking come from?\"\nYou start practicing\nemotional self-regulation,\nself-analysis, and responsibility.\nNumber five, you realize\nthat healing is not linear.\nHealing is uncomfortable\nbecause you are unearthing\nand confronting things\nyou would've preferred to keep suppressed.\nOnce you get into the\nrhythm, you realize that part\nof that healing is that this\ndistress is okay and normal\nbecause it's not a straight\nroad to inner peace and healing.\nYou understand and have\nexperienced the highs and lows\nof healing and know that\nthe feeling of today\nwill not match the feelings\nof tomorrow or even later on.\nNumber six, you begin to step\nout of your comfort zone.\nHere's the thing about healing.\nIt's not something everyone will do.\nHowever, if you decide to,\nit actually has far-reaching\nbenefits beyond the acceptance\nand acknowledgement of\nthe traumatic experience.\nOnce you are in the healing process,\nyou are developing bravery\naround your emotions and your mind.\nWith this newfound conscious control,\nyou are no longer scared by\nthings that scared you before.\nScared of making a\nliving situation change?\nYou now are redecorating your bedroom\nand experimenting with paint colors\nyou never thought you would.\nGoing to a party you don't know?\nBefore, you would've\nrecoiled at the thought,\nbut now it's a little\nless anxiety inducing,\nand you have a bit more confidence.\nNumber seven, you easily\naccept the disappointments\nand take them in stride.\nLife is a balance of success and failure,\nlight and dark, ups and downs.\nWhen you're not healing,\ndisappointments hit you\nlike a freight truck to the chest,\nknocking all of the motivation\nand passion out of you.\nWith healing, you understand\nthat bad days do happen\nand can't be avoided,\nbut are also temporary.\nAny disappointments or unmet expectations\nare accepted and taken in stride.\nYou respond in better, healthier ways\nthat are less reactive.\nNumber eight, you have more inner peace.\nHealing brings about self-integration.\nIf you're a Harry Potter fan,\nit's as if Voldemort brought\nback all of his Horcruxes\nand decided on becoming\na better, complete person\nwho accepts the natural way\nof life on a soul level.\nAnd if you're not a fan,\nit's like taking inventory\nof all of your experiences,\npainful or not,\nand seeing yourself as the whole person.\nYou develop this inner peace\nbecause you deeply forgive yourself,\nand you can readily forgive others, too.\nBy having this peace and integration,\nyou are less likely to self-sabotage\nbecause you're no longer a\nwarring country within yourself\nwith conflicting desires and emotions.\nYou reconcile your inner differences.\nYou no longer criticize and\ndismantle your character\nin your mind.\nAnd number nine, you\nwelcome help and support.\nThe independent survivor has a\ndon't ask for help mentality,\nmaybe because they never\ngot it when they needed it\nor because of the harsh\nrejection when they spoke up.\nThey shut down to get by and\ndecided to do it by themselves\nbecause they had no choice.\nWith healing, you start to realize\nthat, as strong as you are,\nyou can't carry and do\neverything by yourself.\nYou do need help, and we all do,\nand it's available out there for you.\nYou are more open to\nsupport and less afraid\nof having this need for assistance met.\nThe pride and shame you might\nfeel for asking for help\nare gone because you know that it's okay\nto let go of the heavy\nburden on your shoulders\nand have someone to lean on.\nDid you relate to any of these points?\nDo you feel that you\nare beginning to heal?\nAs rewarding as the\nfirst step of healing is,\nyou will run into the\ndiscomfort of your healing,\nand this will try to\nmake you stop, to lessen\nor ignore the pain, but whatever\nyou resist, you prolong.\nIf you are in the healing\nprocess, well done,\nI'm proud of you for doing this work,\nand I hope you can find peace through it.\nAnd if you're not, that's\nokay because healing\nis a long process that takes time.\nYou're still living\nand doing what you can.\nApplaud yourselves.
