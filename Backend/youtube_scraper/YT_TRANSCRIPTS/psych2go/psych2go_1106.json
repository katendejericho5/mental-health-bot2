    "transcript": "Well, that seems obvious, now.\nEver said any of these things to yourself?\nUsually in a rather frustrated\nor annoyed at yourself manner?\nSo have we.\nDespite our best planning,\nhow much we think we know\nor how confident we are\nin our own abilities, life\ncan still throw one doozy\nof a curve ball.\nAt Psych2Go, we're all\nabout trying to help make life\na little smoother for you.\nSo we'll share some wisdom\nothers have said they\nwish they'd known sooner,\nthings like, \"You are more than the sum\nof your certificates.\"\nAccomplishments like good grades\nor awards are certainly\nsigns of success and progress\nbut they don't determine\nyour value as a person.\nIntelligence is varied, multi-form,\nand requires so much more\nthan a piece of paper.\nIntegrity, the choices you make,\nand the impact you leave on others\nhave the most lasting value.\nNumber two, learn\nfinancial basics early on.\nWe're not saying you\nshould be an accountant\nbut money is still necessary\nfor the fundamentals.\nSo unless you're planning to go\noff grid and live off the land,\nlearn how to balance your\nbooks on a simple level.\nThis means knowing how to\nat least file basic taxes and getting\ninto the habit of creating\nand keeping a budget of sorts.\nThis can save you so much anxiety\nand possible financial loss in the future.\nNumber three, time is\nprecious currency, value it.\nIn fact, time is even\nmore valuable than money\nbecause you can't earn it back.\nEven now, we're sure you\ncan remember having thought\nat least once, \"I wish\nI had more time to...\"\nYour time is extra special\nbecause it's yours and\nyou have to spend it.\nNo one else can spend it except you.\nYou can't give it to an\ninvestment person to make it grow\nand no bank in the world\nwill make it grow interest.\nAlthough there are some things\nthat require good timing.\nDon't wait for the right\ntime for too many things\nbecause often there isn't an ideal time,\njust the best choice possible\nbased on prudence and wisdom.\nDon't throw your time away\non people who dismiss you,\nwhen something is irreplaceable,\nyou wanna spend it\non those who understand\nand appreciate its value.\nNumber four, boundaries,\nhave them, keep them.\nYour boundaries help\nmaintain your self respect\nand your self identity.\nThey help you keep safe\nwhen learning new things\nand let others know how\nbest to interact with you.\nWithout them, relationships\nbecome codependent\nand you find that you're\nnot living your life\nbut one dictated by others.\nNumber five, color outside the lines.\nRemember those coloring books and the joy\nof getting to use the big\nbox of coloring pencils?\nThen remember learning that coloring\ninside the lines was deemed correct?\nSure, that was the way it\nwas when we were little\nand didn't know much about life.\nSo we needed a guideline to start us off.\nAs we grow older, though,\nmany of us end up forming our own lines\ninto which we box ourselves.\nWe convince ourselves\nto stay in these lines\nbecause outside isn't safe or isn't right.\nEven if we're unhappy,\nwe choose to stay comfortable\nin the familiarity\nof our misery because we\nfear the unknown, the new,\nor going outside the lines.\nTo not color outside the lines leads\nto missed opportunities,\nstaying in bad relationships\nforever wondering what if\nand the regret that follows.\nWell, that doesn't sound good.\nYou can do it.\nDefinitely do some risk assessment though\nand then take the leap.\nNumber six, learn to read subtext.\nIt's not what you say,\nit's how you say it.\nYou get me?\nFine does not usually mean fine.\nSubtext is that nonverbal\nmessage that's sent\nwhen we communicate, vocal\ninflections, omissions,\na dropped gaze, or even a\nchange in breathing rate\ncan completely change the message\nthat's being literally spoken.\nIf you ever wondered how some\npeople can speak so easily\nwith others, it's because\nthey've learned how to listen\nand observe others with both\nempathy and understanding.\nThey're avid subtext readers,\nthis allows you to respond to\nwhat a person actually means.\nNumber seven, Rome was not built in a day.\nThat's right, despite\nall the myriad posts,\narticles, and podcasts\nbleeding about this life hack\nand that magic method to\nget rich, it's not true.\nThere is no fabulous\nfantastical method to fast track\nto glory, the effort, the failures,\nand the heartbreak can't be skipped.\nEven playing things safe, staying\nwithin those lines and\nnever venturing beyond,\ncan you claim to\nexperience the truthfulness\nof life that way?\nIf you have a dream or goal, go for it.\nDo it smartly, of course, don't\ndump all your life savings\ninto a thing you haven't planned\nout, but still go for it.\nJust know to expect\nfailures, possibly derision,\nand at least some rejection.\nTo figure out what's right,\nwe have to know what's wrong as well.\nNothing truly great and\nmeaningful ever came easy\nbecause it's what you put\ninto it that made it that\nmeaningful in the first place.\nAnd number eight, go outside.\nYeah, we know, mom was right.\nIt's a nice day out, why\ndon't you go play outside?\nIt's true.\nAnd even more so now in\nthe age of being able\nto do everything online, that\ngoing out is good for you.\nTouching nature actually is\nhealthy and has been shown\nto be rejuvenating, even\nif it's sitting in a park\non cultivated grass under\nthe shade of a tree.\nSo go on outside, mother\nnature misses you.\nWe know that sometimes 2020 vision\nis the only way we realize\nhow important some things are.\nHopefully sharing these tips\nwith you will help you make\nthe looking back a little more,\nyeah, I did that, I feel\ngood, unless I wish I had,\na good life is one\nwithout regrets after all.\nAnything you wanna add or discuss?\nComment below.\nAlso don't regret not\nshowing us a little TLC\nand give us a like, catch you next time."
