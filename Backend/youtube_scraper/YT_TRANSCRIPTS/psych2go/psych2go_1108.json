    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hi, there, psych2goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nNarcissism and sociopath are two terms\nthat are thrown around often.\nYou may even wonder what's the difference.\nBoth conditions come with a lot of stigma.\nSo to understand them better\nwe will be looking at the\ndifferences between them.\nWhat is sociopathy?\nWhat is commonly known as a\nsociopath is actually a person\nwith antisocial\npersonality disorder, ASPD.\nSociopathy is not a medical term\nand is most commonly referred to\nby its associated condition.\nPeople with ASPD tend\nto have frequent issues\nfollowing rules and laws,\nhave a lack of empathy towards others,\nand act impulsively.\nAccording to the Cleveland\nClinic and Mayo Clinic,\nsome other signs of ASPD\ninclude lack of remorse\nafter hurting another person,\nreckless behavior,\nchaotic and abusive relationships,\nmanipulative behavior,\ndisrespect towards others,\nsubstance abuse.\nASPD is considered a cluster\nB personality disorder,\nmeaning that the behavior is emotional,\nunpredictable, and dramatic.\nApproximately 1 to 4% of people in the US\nare suspected to have this condition,\nbut it can be hard to tell\nas people often go undiagnosed.\nWhat is narcissism?\nA narcissist is someone\nwith narcissistic\npersonality disorder, NPD.\nPeople with this condition\ntend to think highly of themselves,\nlack empathy for others,\nand constantly seek praise.\nAccording to both\nCleveland and Mayo Clinics,\nsigns of NPD include\ngrandiose sense of importance,\nmanipulative behavior,\nviewing others as inferior,\nfeeling entitled,\narrogance, and will only\nassociate with people\nthey feel are of high status.\nLike ASPD, NPD is also a\ncluster B personality disorder.\nAnd people often go undiagnosed\nas they do not typically seek treatment.\nApproximately 5% of the population\nis believed to have this condition.\nHow are they similar?\nSymptoms of NPD and ASPD\ndo overlap in many ways.\nPeople tend to lack empathy towards others\nand may take advantage of\npeople to serve their needs.\nThey can appear charming\nand will use that trait\nto win others over.\nIn general, people with either condition\nwill tend to focus on themselves first\nand use other people for their own gain.\nUntreated, relationships with others\ncan be stormy and toxic.\n(gentle music)\nHow are they different?\nOne of the biggest difference\nbetween the two conditions\nis how people with NPD care highly\nabout how others view them,\nwhereas those with ASPD don't.\nPeople with NPD may work harder\nto keep marriages and jobs,\nas they're more dependent on their status\nand need for approval.\nOn the other hand, people with ASPD\nmay leave anything once it\nno longer serves its purpose.\nOverall, people with NPD\nwill work to keep gaining admiration,\nwhereas those with ASPD\nwill drift around to fulfill their needs.\nHow are they treated?\nIt's important to know that sufferers\nof NPD or ASPD are still people.\nThey live with a condition\nthat causes much stress to themselves\nand the people around them.\nWhile many don't pursue any\ntype of mental health treatment\nor do so because they are forced,\nboth conditions have\noptions for treatment.\nGenerally they will require\nmental health professionals\nthat have expertise in\nthe specific disorder.\nA combination of medication\nalong with psychotherapy\nare common to help manage\nsymptoms of both disorders.\nWhile NPD and ASPD do\nhave their similarities,\nthey are different conditions\nwith different problems and treatments.\nRemember to reach out\nto a qualified mental health professional\nif you're struggling.\nGetting in touch with the right person\ncan be a great first step to\nimproving your quality of life.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topic?\nWhat are some more\nsimilarities and differences?\nWhat have you learned?\nLet us know in the comments\nand remember to share with\nsomeone who might benefit.\nAs always, the references and studies\nare listed in the description below.\nThanks for watching.\nUntil next time."
