    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHope you're having a wonderful day.\nCurious about who finds you attractive,\nnot based on your looks but\nbased on your behavior as well?\nYou may have a friend\nthat's fallen for you,\nor at least you think so,\nor perhaps you notice\npeople often compliment\nyour personality, and\nperhaps your looks as well.\nSo how can you tell if\nsomeone finds your behavior\nand personality attractive?\nWell, here are five signs\npeople find your personality attractive,\nnot just your looks.\nNumber one, they seem\nnervous or awkward around you\nafter they've gotten to know you a bit.\nSo you've been hanging out with someone\nfor a while and suddenly\nthey've been a bit nervous\nand awkward around you lately.\nMaybe they've started blushing\nat the little things you say.\nThey stumble on their words\nor now have trouble meeting your eyes.\nThis could mean they've\ndeveloped feelings for you\nbased on the interactions\nyou've had together.\nEveryone's different.\nSome may try their best\nto shake off the nerves\nbefore speaking with you again.\nSo you may not always notice it.\nOthers may not be able to help it.\nSo do you notice your friend\nsuddenly can't meet your gaze\nwithout blushing?\nThey may just like you, my friend.\nThey may just like you.\nNumber two, their attitude and\nvocabulary suddenly changes\naround you after a while.\nYou have a friend you've been\nhanging out with more lately,\nbut you suddenly noticed\nthey've started to noticeably\nchange their vocabulary\nand manner only around you.\nThis plays into how others may tend\nto mimic another's subtle\ngestures and behavior\nif they like them\nincluding changing their expressions.\nLanguage and speak researcher,\nDr. Marina Kalashnikova\nfrom the university of Western Sydney\ntold ABC Radio Melbourne's Lindsay Burns\nthat we would use more\nsimilar expressions.\nFor example, to sound more alike.\nShe explains that this\ncan sometimes happen fast\nover a conversation.\nSo do you notice someone unconsciously\nchanges the way they speak\nbecause they're simply in awe of you,\nor they just really nervous\nonly around you again.\nOver due time they've admired you so much,\nthey've mimicked your\nbehavior and language,\nsounds like the chameleon\neffect to me, folks.\nNumber three, they're engaged\nin your conversations.\nHave you had a few conversations\nwith someone recently?\nNotice they were particularly engaged\nin what you had to say, or\nare they on their phone?\nAre they scanning around the room?\nAre they looking at something else?\nIf they don't engage with you\noften on the emotional level\nor even any level during your outings,\nthen it's likely they don't\nlike you on an emotional level.\nHowever, if they ask follow up questions\nand keep their focus on you,\nthen it's another good sign\nthat they're interested in you.\nNumber four, they keep\nthe conversation going\nand emotionally open up to you as well.\nSimilar to being engaged\nin your conversation\nand listening to what you have to say,\nthey'll likely wanna keep talking to you.\nDo they try to keep the conversation going\nby asking questions and\nmentioning interesting points\nof their own.\nIt can sometimes be difficult to do this.\nBut if they've been trying\nto continue chats with you,\nthis is a good sign that they like you.\nThis can be through text too.\nThis could mean they bring up\nrandom things about their day,\ninteresting comments on\na show they're watching,\nor even sending those funny memes.\nThey'll try to make more\nexcuses to talk to you.\nAnd once you start talking,\nthey'll generally put a bit of effort\ninto keeping the conversation going.\nBut often for a conversation to continue,\nyou'll wanna put in some effort too.\nIf you don't, they may be wondering\nif you like them as much as they like you.\nSo let them know you\nenjoy talking to them.\nThen your conversations may\nbecome effortless and easy.\nCould you become more than friends?\nAnd number five, they often\ncompliment your personality,\ntraits, humor, et cetera.\nNot only does this\nperson you're thinking of\nhave some of the signs above\nbut you notice they give you\ngenuine compliments as well.\nNot just about your looks, but\noften about your personality\nor perhaps your humor too.\nMaybe they've mentioned how\nmuch they enjoy spending time\nwith you, or perhaps they've\nstarted flirting with you\nafter getting to know you for a while.\nThis can be a good indicator\nthat they're falling for you,\nnot only on an emotional level,\nbut a romantic one as well.\nThey've gotten to know you and\nrecognize all the many things\nthat make you amazing and unique.\nThey've fallen for you\nand now likely find you\nboth emotionally attractive\nand physically attractive as well.\nThe question is, how\ndo you feel about them?\nIs there romance in the air?\nFeel free to let us know
