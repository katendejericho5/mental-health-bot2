    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nAre you worried about your\nbond with your partner?\nYou feel like your\nrelationship isn't as strong\nas it was before.\nOr are you still single and\nwanna learn how to build\na strong relationship\nwith your future partner?\nWhen you've been so accustomed\nto being around your partner\nafter dating or being married\nfor months to years on end,\nyou may feel that a once\nsolid connection has gone cold\nor stagnant.\nBut worry not because\nthere are a number of ways\nto keep your relationship strong.\nAnd while many people may tell\nyou that communication is key\nand it is, here are some other,\nperhaps more specific ways\nto help strengthen your\nrelationship between you\nand your partner.\nNumber one, spend time together\nwithout being distracted\nby technology.\nHave you ever been to a\nrestaurant with your partner,\nbut spent most of your\ntime on your phones?\nIt can happen to the best of us,\nwhether it's scrolling\nthrough our Instagram feeds\nor checking our emails.\nIt's no secret that we're beyond\nhooked on our smartphones.\nHowever, while the\nissue may seem harmless,\na problem can add to relationship strain,\nparticularly to married couples.\nA New York Times article\nfrom 2016 points out\nthat while men and women\nare equally as attached\nto their devices, women in partnerships\nreact more sensitively to it.\nDr. Susan Heitler, author of\n\"Prescription Without Pills\",\nnoted that one of her\nclients who was fearful\nthat his partner was unfaithful to him\nreacted to his anxiety\nby retreating further\ninto his smartphone rather\nthan facing the issue head on.\nSo a good way to strengthen\nyour relationship\nmay be to make a conscious\neffort on the conversations\nin real time rather than\nthe ones on your phone.\nNumber two, ask your\npartner something new.\nWhen was the last time you\nasked your partner a deep,\nthought-provoking question?\nWhen you get so used to\nbeing around someone,\nit's common to think\nthat you know everything\nthere is to know about them,\nbut the truth is human\nbeings are ever evolving\nand there's usually\nmore beneath the surface\nthat could be revealed.\nAccording to the website Goalcast,\nopen and honest conversations\ncan further serve a couple\nby eliciting feelings\nof trust, understanding,\nand compassion.\nThese conversations can\nallow you and your partner\nto have a clearer idea as\nto why the other thinks\nand behaves the way they do.\nIt also gives each partner the\nopportunity to be empathetic\nand good listeners.\nNumber three, look into\neach other's eyes more.\nHave you ever actively looked\ninto your romantic partner's eyes?\nIt's been shown that\nsustained eye contact,\nmeaning a few minutes or more,\ncan foster feelings of\nintimacy, connectedness,\nand vulnerability.\nEven more powerfully,\naccording to the website Mind and Spirit,\nlooking into each other's eyes more\ncan create the feeling of really\nbeing seen and acknowledged\nwithout distraction.\nWhile it may seem unlikely\nthat the common couple\nwith busy schedules\nwill just take time out\nto stare at each other every day,\nthe act alone of increasing eye contact\nin unsuspecting moments can\nhave a transformative effect.\nNumber four, small acts\nof physical affection.\nHow often do you show your\npartner physical affection?\nFinding small moments\nto touch your partner,\na brush of each other's\nhands, a hug from behind,\na kiss hello or goodbye are\nalways to strengthen your bond\nwith them.\nA 2003 study which surveyed\n295 college students\nshowed that there's a direct link\nbetween the amount of physical\naffection in a relationship\nto the overall relationship satisfaction.\nThe correlation was simple.\nThe more physical affection there was,\nthe more satisfied couples were.\nAnd number five, cooking\nand eating together.\nDo you spend time with your\npartner in the kitchen?\nCooking together can be an overlooked way\nto strengthen the bond with your partner\nbecause sometimes it can be\nlogistically difficult to do.\nFor example, you and your\npartner may come home from work\nat different times.\nBut making a conscious effort\nto make a meal together\ncan be the perfect opportunity\nfor you both to share stories\nabout your respective days, to banter,\nand simply work towards\nsomething together.\nAnd don't forget the playful\nsplash from the faucet\nthat always adds just a little\nbit more fun to the process.\nSo what other ways have you tried\nto strengthen your\nrelationship with your partner?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like and share this
