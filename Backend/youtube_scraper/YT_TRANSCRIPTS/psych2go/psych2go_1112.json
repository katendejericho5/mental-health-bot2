    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nIt's been said\nthat loneliness is a\nuniversal human experience.\nAnd chances are,\nif you're watching this\nthen you've probably felt lonely too.\nNo one is exempt\nfrom feeling a sense of\nloneliness in their lives\nfrom time to time, no\nmatter what their age, race,\nbackground or social circumstances may be.\nBut when left to its own devices\nit can be a potentially\ndamaging state of mind to be in.\nSo why do we feel lonely?\nAnd better yet, what can we do about it?\nWell, here are six psychology\nbacked signs to help\nwith just that.\nNumber one, you have a good friend or two.\nAnd most people tend to feel lonely\nwhen they don't have as\nmany friends as they like,\nor they have too many acquaintances\nthey don't feel particularly close to.\nSo if you have at least one\nclose friend in your life\nyou genuinely feel like you can trust,\nand who cares for you,\nthen you're already doing so much better\nthan you probably think you are.\nIn fact, one of the most\nfamous psychological studies,\nthe 40 year Harvard study\non happiness has found\nthat it's not the quality\nof our social relationships\nthat determines our happiness,\nbut rather, their quality.\nNumber two, you have people\nyou can get help from.\nMany people wanna be\npopular and well liked,\nnever without a friend by their side\nor flaunting a million\nfollowers on social media.\nBut we all know that deep down\ninside, none of that matters.\nIf the people you surround yourself with,\ndon't truly care about you as a person.\nSo if you've ever found\nyourself in a tough spot before\nor struggling with a problem\nthat someone in your\nlife helped you to solve,\nbe it a friend or a family member,\nthen count yourself lucky.\nYou're not as alone as you think you are.\nNumber three, you have people\nwho can give you advice,\neven though you might\nfeel too scared to open up\nand burden other people\nwith your problems.\nOr worry that they might treat\nand look at you differently\nonce you do.\nThe truth is you'll never\nreally know until you try.\nWho knows,\nyou might already have\nplenty of people in your life\nwho'd be more than happy to\nlisten to what's troubling you,\nand even offer some advice;\nlike your parents, your\nbest friend, your teacher,\nyour guidance counselor and so on.\nNumber four, you can talk about\nyour hobbies and interests.\nOkay, so maybe talking about\nall the touchy-feely stuff\nis a bit uncomfortable\nfor you; that's okay.\nA lot of people feel the same way,\nbut talking to someone about your hobbies\nand interests can be just as\nfulfilling and therapeutic too,\nespecially with those who\nshare the same passion as you.\nFinding someone you can\ntalk to about all the things\nthat make you happy, whether\nit's a favorite film,\nbook or pastime is already enough\nto make us feel a stronger\nsense of belonging\nand emotional connection with others.\nNumber five, you have people\nyou regularly check in with.\nEven if you might not see\nthem, as often as you'd like,\nor you feel like you've drifted\napart and aren't as close\nas you used to be,\nthat doesn't mean that your\nloved ones have stopped caring\nabout you or that you don't\nmatter to them anymore.\nChances are even if they\ndon't keep in touch anymore,\nthey still check in on you\nfrom time to time and\nmake sure you're okay;\nSunday brunch at your parents' house,\nGrab grabbing coffee with an old friend,\na quick phone call from your sibling.\nAll of these things tell\nyou you're not as alone,\nas you might feel sometimes,\nBecause at the end of the day,\nyour loved ones will always be there.\nAnd number six, you're\ncareful about who you let in.\nBeing careful about who\nyou let into your life\nand your inner circle can\nreap a lot of rewards,\nbut it can also make us feel\nmore alone than we really are.\nWe might feel like we don't have as much\nof a social media presence.\nDon't go out as often as\nother people think we should\nor aren't constantly\nsurrounded by other people\nin our day-to-day lives.\nRegardless of all these things however,\nit's still a lot better to\nchoose your friends wisely\nbecause then you can be sure\nthat the people you do\nlet your guard down around\ncan be trusted.\nSo do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nHas this helped you realize\nthat you're not as alone\nas you once thought?\nWhile it's tempting to push such a painful\nand scary feeling aside,\nit's important that we acknowledge it\nand try to understand why\nwe're feeling this way.\nLoneliness, after all,\nis just like any other human emotion.\nIt's meant to teach us\nsomething about ourselves\nwe might not yet realize.\nMaybe your loneliness\nis trying to tell you\nto make a conscious effort\nto get closer to your loved ones\nor maybe it's telling you\nthat something needs to change\nin your life.\nRegardless whatever the reason may be,\nif you're seriously struggling\nwith your mental health,\nthe best thing you can do is reach out\nto a mental healthcare\nprofessional today and seek help.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nlike and share it with friends\nthat might find insight in it too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go,\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the sources used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks for watching, until next."
