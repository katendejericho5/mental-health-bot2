    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, friends,\nwelcome back to another video.\nIs your brain often working on overdrive,\nand you're overthinking more\nthan you'd like to admit?\nBut what if you're not overthinking,\nand it's self-gaslighting instead?\nLet's take a look at the\ndifferences between the two.\nOverthinking versus self-gaslighting.\nOverthinking is where\nyour mind gets cluttered\nwith repetitive thoughts,\nand playing out some situations\nover and over in your head.\nThinking about what could\nhave gone differently,\nsecond guessing your decisions,\nor imagining worse case\nscenarios about the future.\nIt can be a hard to break habit\nthat can leave you exhausted\nand even more anxious than before.\nSelf-gaslighting also deals with unwanted,\nhard to control thoughts,\nbut it's more complex,\nmore ingrained, and holds a\nstrong emotional importance.\nWhen you are self-gaslighting,\nyou are internalizing emotional abuse,\nand manipulation tactics\nthat you've probably experienced before.\nWhen someone is gaslighting you,\nthey're trying to skew your reality,\nand make you question it, making\nit seem like you're crazy,\nand that things are not how you see them.\nIf you are hearing this often,\nyou may slowly adapt to it,\nand might start self-gaslighting\nor manipulating yourself.\nLet's explore a few situations\nin which the line between\noverthinking and gaslighting\nmight not be so clear.\nNumber one, intimate relationships.\nLet's say you have a\nfight with your partner.\nSome hurtful things were said,\nand they stormed out of the door\nbefore you had a chance\nto talk it through.\nNow you're alone in bed, trying to sleep,\nbut your thoughts keep you awake.\nAre you overthinking?\nYou might be wondering,\nwas I too offensive?\nMaybe I should have said that.\nThey're probably telling their\nfriends about the fight now.\nI think they should be on my side.\nI was right, but was I, was it worth it?\nI don't even know anymore.\nOr are you self-gaslighting?\nI'm so sensitive, crazy, and emotional.\nOf course I was wrong,\nthey would never try to\nhurt me intentionally.\nI'm overreacting once again.\nI know they love me too much.\nThey didn't mean it like that.\nIt's all my fault anyway.\nI better send a text apologizing.\nThis should really be a lesson for me.\nNumber two, social interactions.\nIt's your first day of class,\nor you're starting in a new workplace.\nYou're meeting your new colleagues.\nYou chit chat, and joke around a bit.\nAfter the day is finally over,\nyou come home and take a shower,\nand that's when the brain starts working.\nAre you overthinking?\nOh my God, what did they think of me?\nWas I talking too much or too little?\nWas that joke I said totally lame?\nMy hair looked so bad today.\nI hope they didn't pay attention to it.\nOr are you self-gaslighting?\nThat went really bad.\nI'm not surprised.\nI'm just not a likable person.\nNo wonder nobody liked me in school.\nI always say the stupidest things.\nI should just keep to myself next time.\nNumber three, toxic household.\nDo you often fight with\nyour parents or siblings?\nMaybe you're used to insults,\nyelling, criticizing,\nbecause you've been\nliving in that environment\nfor quite some time, but\nyou finally had enough.\nYou wanna stand up for yourself,\nbut when you start planning what to say,\nyou're not so sure if that's\nsuch a good idea anymore.\nAre you overthinking?\nWhat if I just make it worse?\nAm I even capable of confronting them?\nWhat if they don't take me seriously?\nWhat would I even say?\nI can't tell them they're toxic,\nor are you self-gaslighting?\nMaybe I don't have it so bad.\nI mean, some people live in\nfar worse conditions than I do.\nMy parents gave me so much in life.\nI would be ungrateful\nif I stood up to them.\nActually when I think about\nit, I really am a bad child,\njust like they told me so many times.\nAnd number four, trusting your judgment.\nFinally, sometimes our\ngut feelings about others\ntell us exactly what we need to hear,\nespecially if someone is manipulating us,\ntreating us badly, or using us.\nWe may notice their bad intentions,\nand feel like something's\nwrong, or at least for a moment.\nBut after that moment,\nour thoughts about the\nsituation may once again\nspiral out of control,\nand those people gain\neven more power over us.\nAre you overthinking?\nAre they really being manipulative?\nI feel like they might be using me,\nbut everyone else thinks they're so nice.\nWill other people think\nI'm not being fair?\nWill they accuse me of being a bad person?\nOr are you self-gaslighting?\nI'm overreacting again,\nit's all in my head.\nThey're a good person.\nThey would never treat anyone badly.\nI'm the bad person for\nassuming stuff about them,\nso I should probably do\nsomething nice for them.\nIn short, if you're overthinking,\nyou may overanalyze every little detail\nabout everything, and ask\nyourself a thousand questions.\nWhat could go wrong?\nWhat could have been better?\nBut if your mind is playing tricks on you,\nand you start self-gaslighting,\nyou will minimize your feelings,\nconstantly blame yourself, doubt yourself,\nbe your own worst critic,\nand question yourself.\nYou won't need to overthink,\nbecause you'll already have an answer.\nYou are the problem.\nOf course, the first step towards healing\nis recognizing there's a\nproblem in the first place.\nIf you notice your overthinking\nis really self-gaslighting,\nconsider talking to a\nmental health professional,\nwho may help turn your\nself-gaslighting into self-love.\nCan you relate to any of these scenarios?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nPlease like and share this\nvideo with others it might help.\nThe references and studies, as always,\nare listed in the description below.\nUntil next time, take care."
