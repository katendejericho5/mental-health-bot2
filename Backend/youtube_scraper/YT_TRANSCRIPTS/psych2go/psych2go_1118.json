    "transcript": "- [Narrator] There has been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks for being a part of our journey.\nHave you ever lost the\nenthusiasm for doing things\nthat were once new and exciting?\nOr do you dread the\nthought of having to work\nlong, hard hours on a project\nthat just leaves you unfulfilled?\nIf so, you may be feeling\na case of burnout,\nwhich is the loss of motivation\nthat once compelled you to keep going.\nThe absence of ambition to do what you,\nor others expect of you\nand the lack of desire to\nfinish what you started.\nSo with that said,\nhere are six signs that indicate\nthat you are burning out.\nNumber one.\nYou work hard but don't\nseem to reach your goals.\nIf you're working longer hours,\nyet don't feel in touch with your goals,\nyou might be on the verge of burnout.\nBurning out, makes you feel\ndisengaged from your tasks.\nYou may just be going on autopilot,\nputting in work but not really feeling\na sense of purpose in what you do.\nWhen this starts to happen,\nyou may need to step back\nand evaluate your goals.\nIs what you're working towards\nfulfilling something you truly want,\nor is it someone else's\nexpectations of you?\nCan you change the situation in any way?\nFrom there you can decide\nwhether the path you're\nheading is truly worthwhile.\nIt's never too late to change\ndirections when you want to.\nNumber two.\nYou have no desire to\nsocialize with friends.\nDo you find yourself avoiding\nany interactions with people,\neven the ones you're close with?\nIt's easy to forget what\nit feels like to live life,\nwhen you're stuck with\nan endless pile of tasks.\nYou may be so caught up with your duties,\nthat it can be hard to find time\nto enjoy yourself with friends.\nAnd when you do find time\nto catch up with them,\nyou may end up feeling irritated,\nbecause you'd rather be\nproductive and working.\nWhile burnout can be the\nsource of avoidant tendencies,\nmany other conditions\ncan lead to blame too.\nSo, it's always best to\ntalk with a therapist\nto truly understand the root motivations\nbehind your actions.\nNumber three.\nProcrastinating has become second nature.\nDo you often put tasks off until later on,\nbecause they seem endless?\nWhen you're faced with the magnitude\nof all the tasks to be done,\nit can be daunting to start.\nYou may put things off\nuntil the last minute,\nforcing you to rush and feel stressed.\nIf you've ever wondered, why\nyou always end up in this loop,\nit may be because procrastination stems,\nfrom a sense of perfectionism,\nwhere you wanna do everything\nas well as you possibly can\nand because of this, you\nmay put off actual work\nand spend more time\nmulling over the project,\nthan actually completing it.\nIf you find yourself putting\nthings off more than usual,\ntry breaking your tasks into smaller\nand more manageable chunks.\nThis way you won't overwhelm\nyourself with larger goals,\nbut still continue working\ntowards them bit by bit.\nNumber four.\nYou feel insecure about your abilities.\nDo you find yourself second\nguessing your capabilities\nand comparing yourself with other people?\nIf so, you might be experiencing\na common cause of burnout.\nWhen you have a lot on your plate,\nit can be difficult to prioritize things,\nwhich can cause you to make mistakes\nand feel dissatisfied with your work\nand ultimately your abilities.\nIt's easy to get caught up in\nseeing other people's talents\nand forgetting your own.\nEspecially if you're in a\nhighly competitive field.\nIf that's the case, try focusing on\nyour own personal strengths\nas you work towards your goals.\nNumber five, you don't feel\na sense of accomplishment in your work.\nDoes getting recognized for your efforts,\nmean next to nothing to you?\nBeing burnt out is often associated\nwith a lack of interest\nin your current situation.\nYou may find yourself not caring\nabout the results of your projects\nand instead, only happy\nwhen they're dealt with.\nFor example, a teacher may compliment you\non your performance in\na university course,\nbut if you didn't wanna pursue that major\nin the first place,\nor if you found the work uninteresting\nand not aligned with your\npersonal motivations,\nyou won't feel any sense of accomplishment\nfrom their praise.\nAnd number six.\nYou feel like your situation is hopeless.\nDo you feel like there's no way out\nof the situation you are in?\nPeople who are burnt out often can't find\nany sense of pride in their work.\nIt's as if their emotional\nwell has dried up,\ncausing them to be too unmotivated\nto do anything that would push\nthem in the right direction.\nIt may be hard to rise above it,\nbut know that you're not alone.\nTalk to a friend, or loved one for help\nand consider talking to a therapist\nif you can't seem to get\nthrough it on your own.\nAs a final note, remember\nto take some time\nfor yourself every once in a while.\nIt's important to go out\nand socialize with friends.\nEnjoy activities that make you happy\nand rest ever so often.\nWe're not built to live\nlike machines after all.\nIf you have limited hours in the day,\nyou can always start\nsmall with simple things\nlike going for a walk every day,\nor spending quality time\nwith friends, or loved ones.\nSo, do you relate to\nany of the above signs?\nAre there some that we may have missed?\nShare them in the comments below.\nRemember to like and share this video\nwith those who might enjoy it.\nAs always the references\nand studies are listed\nin the description below.\nThat's all for now, Psych to Goers.\nSee you next time.\n(soft music)"
