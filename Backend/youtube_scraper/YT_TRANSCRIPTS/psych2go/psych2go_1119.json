    "transcript": "- [Narrator] There has been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nStay tuned and thanks for\nbeing a part of our journey.\nWhen you think of an intelligent person,\nwhat do you think they do?\nYou might think they typically read books,\nace tests and achieve success,\nbut what about the opposite question?\nWhat do they avoid doing?\nTo help answer this question,\nhere are five things that\nintelligent people never do.\nNumber one.\nIntelligent people don't get complacent.\nHow often do you worry about the future?\nYou may think worrying\nis a bad mental trait,\nbut complacency could be even worse.\nIn a study published in Personality\nand Individual Differences,\nanxiety levels were connected\nwith high verbal intelligence.\nAccording to authors,\nintelligent people think\nabout every situation in\nintense detail to gain insight\nand to prepare for the future,\neven at the risk of excessive worrying.\nSo while they know that a totally relaxed\nHakuna Matata attitude might\nbe emotionally satisfying,\nit may not be a smart way to navigate\nan unpredictable world.\nNumber two.\nIntelligent people\ndon't dwell on the past.\nDo you get anxious about the past as well?\nAlthough the previous\nstudy from Personality\nand Individual Differences\nfound that intelligent people\nare more anxious, there was\none exception to their worries\nand it's that they don't\ndwell on events in the past.\nAccording to the same study,\npeople with high nonverbal intelligence\ninterpret events clearly the first time,\nso they don't need to go back later on\nto process it all over again.\nUltimately, they know\nthat dwelling on the past\njust repeats the emotional pain they felt\nand doesn't add any new insight\nto help them in the present.\nNumber three, intelligent\npeople don't listen\nto repetitive cheerful music.\nWhat kind of music do you\nassociate with intelligence?\nIf you thought of high brow classic music,\nyou might be surprised to know\nthat intelligent people\nactually prefer sad music.\nAccording to research by\nthe University of Bologna,\nhighly intelligent people\ntend to avoid cheerful music\nwith repetitive melodies\nand conventional structures.\nIn other words, your typical\nupbeat top 40 single.\nThey know that these simple\ntracks don't satisfy their need\nfor musical novelty and\ndeep emotional resonance.\nNumber four, intelligent\npeople don't sit around.\nHow much time do you spend lazing around\non the couch all day?\nYou might assume that intelligence\nis all about mental habits,\nbut your physical habits matter as well.\nThe British Cohort Study tracked the lives\nof 17,000 individuals in the\nUK from 1970 to the present,\ngiving researchers an insight\ninto how psychology affects lifestyle.\nThey found that the more\nintelligent an individual,\nthe more often they're engaged in exercise\nthat left them out of breath.\nUltimately, a passive lifestyle\nhas destructive consequences\nfor the body and mind.\nNumber five, intelligent\npeople don't indulge\nin alcohol and tobacco.\nHow often do you partake in substances\nyou know you might regret later on?\nA study published in the\nJournal of Applied Psychology\ntracked the life trajectories of Swedes\nand found that intelligence\nwas strongly connected\nto habits of avoiding alcohol and tobacco.\nThis also led to a much lower prevalence\nof serious medical\nconditions later on in life.\nDo you relate to any of\nthe traits we've mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you find this video\nhelpful, be sure to like,\nsubscribe and share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it,\nand don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2go posts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks so much for watching\nand see you in our next video."
