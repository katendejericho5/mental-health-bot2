    "transcript": "there has been a huge decline in mental\nhealth around the world which is why\nwe're so committed to creating more\ncontent than we ever have thank you so\nmuch for being a part of our journey hey\npsych2goers welcome back to another\nvideo to help you gain knowledge and\nspread awareness on different mental\nhealth conditions today we are\ndiscussing post-traumatic stress\ndisorder ptsd when you hear ptsd what do\nyou think of\na soldier\na victim of a crime\nthe american psychiatric association\ndefines ptsd as a psychiatric disorder\nthat may occur in people who have\nexperienced or witnessed a traumatic\nevent\nbut did you know that there are\ndifferent types of ptsd\ntraditional ptsd is when someone\nexperiences a single traumatic event\nthat causes post-traumatic stress\naccording to medical news today only\nseven percent of those in u.s will be\naffected by traditional ptsd at some\npoint in their lives\nhave you heard of complex post-traumatic\nstress disorder cptsd the world health\norganization department of mental health\nand substance abuse conducted a study in\n2016 that discovered the distinction\nbetween ptsd and cptsd\nlet's jump into five signs it's cptsd\nnot ptsd\n[Music]\nnumber one\nyou notice feelings of trauma coming up\nmore frequently the main differences\nbetween ptsd and see ptsd is how often\nwe feel stress from the traumatic event\nwe experienced\nptsd is typically a one-time traumatic\nevent that will cause stressful feelings\nthat subside within a few days\ncptsd is either trauma from a series of\nevents or a prolonged event\nlet's say you were in a car accident\nif you feel trauma after that event and\nit goes away we might assume this is\ntraditional ptsd but what if you feel\nnervous and anxious about getting into a\ncar a long time after this accident\neven five years after the accident you\nstill won't drive\nthis can be categorized as cptsd\ncptsd can also include reliving the\nevent through flashbacks or nightmares\nbringing on these stressful feelings the\nfrequency of these episodes increase can\nbe the main indicator of cptsd\nnumber two you have difficulty\ncontrolling your emotions\nwhen someone has traditional ptsd the\neffects are short-lived but cptsd is a\ndiagnosis that involves an extended\nperiod of feeling stress and trauma\nstemming from a series of events\nwith a longer time frame comes more\nsevere symptoms on top of feeling the\nstress of the event an individual with\ncptsd may also have difficulty\ncontrolling their emotions let's take\nthat same car accident for example you\nmay feel stressed even getting into a\ncar let alone driving the car if a\nfriend suggests carpooling to lunch you\nmay react by getting very angry and\nyelling at them\nyou might start to cry because the\nthought of being stuck in a car is too\noverwhelming for you\nthese strong emotions paired with a\ntraumatic event can be a sign of cptsd\nnumber three\nhuh what\nwere you saying something\nhave you ever been in the middle of\nsomething and completely spaced out\nmaybe you were driving home from the\nstore and then bam all of a sudden in\nyour home\nthis phenomenon is called dissociation\ndissociation is when our brains lack\ncontinuity you can separate yourself\nfrom your thoughts surroundings and even\nemotions and it's a common coping\nmechanism when we have incredibly\noverwhelming feelings and don't wish to\nbe present to feel them anymore\ndissociation is another symptom specific\nto cptsd due to how long you feel the\nstress so let's go back to the example\nof your friend suggesting to carpool to\nlunch when the friend asks you may begin\nfeeling all of those negative emotions\nbubbling up\nat that point you may notice that you\nblack out or dissociate to stop feeling\nlike this\nif you also take the car ride you may\ndissociate during the car ride to keep\nyourself from having an emotional\noutburst\nnumber four you feel physical symptoms\nwhen you are reminded of your past\ntrauma\nhave you ever been listening to someone\ntelling a story and they describe\nsomething that makes you sick to your\nstomach\nthe brain is a powerful organ that holds\non to a lot of information including\nwhat you feel how you feel and when you\nfeel it so back to the car example\nsay you're recounting your traumatic car\naccident with a mental health\nprofessional\neven though you're safe with the\ntherapist in an office or the comfort of\nyour own home and not in a car\nyou may start to feel physical symptoms\nthat come with anxiety\nthese symptoms can include nausea\ndizziness or pain in your stomach this\nis because your brain remembers having\nthese feelings come back up when simply\nremembering trauma can be a cptsd sign\nnumber five you avoid your trauma\ntriggers at all possible costs\nwhen you know what sets off a mental or\nphysical health concern most of us are\ninclined to avoid that trigger someone\nexperiencing cptsd for a length of time\nmay feel so tired of the stress or other\nsymptoms that they're feeling and they\nmay also be sick of letting their\nemotions get the better of them so what\ndo they do\nthey avoid the trigger at all costs\ndo cars make you nervous okay you can\nuse public transportation to meet\nfriends or invite them to your home for\na friend's night in\nsomeone asks you to run a quick errand\nfor them you can politely make an excuse\nthat you're stuck at the office someone\nsuffering from cptsd might feel the need\nto control their situation to feel like\nthey're in control of themselves\ndid any of these signs shock you were\nyou surprised at the different types of\nptsd leave a comment down below to let\nus know\nexperiencing a traumatic event is awful\nbut reliving it can be just as difficult\nif you or a loved one has experienced\nany of these signs please reach out to a\ntrusted mental health professional to\nexplore more if you enjoyed this please\nshare this video with others who might\nbenefit as always the references and\nstudies used are listed in the\ndescription below until next time\nfriends take care and thanks for\nwatching"
