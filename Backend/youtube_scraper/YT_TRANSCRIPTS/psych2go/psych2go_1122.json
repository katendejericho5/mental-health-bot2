    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHope you're all having a splendid day.\nLately, there's been someone\nwho's been a bit flirty with you.\nAt least you think so.\nIn fact, you're having a hard time telling\nwhether or not they like you.\nMaybe they're not\nobviously flirting with you\nbut you have a hunch that\nthey may be attracted to you.\nSo how can you tell?\nWell, if you think they like you\nand they ask these questions too,\nthen it may just be that\nthey find you attractive.\nHere are five questions someone will ask\nonly if they really like you.\nNumber one, do you find me attractive?\nPerhaps they're trying to flirt\nor maybe they genuinely want to know.\nLikely both.\nWhen someone asks if you\nfind them attractive,\nit's like they wanna find out\nwhether or not you like them\nso they can then make the next move.\nIf you know that you're just friends\nand they make it pretty clear\nthat they're just messing\naround and asking,\nthen that's a different story.\nBut if you sense something is up\nand they give you those goo-goo eyes,\nthey probably really want you to think\nthat they're good looking\nso they can admit that they\nthink you're attractive too.\nNumber two, are you single?\nOr they hint at your relationship status.\nDo you know someone who's\nrecently tried to find out\nabout your relationship status?\nMaybe they smoothly throw in a statement\nthat requires you to reveal a bit of info\nabout if you're dating someone.\nOr maybe they assume you\nhave a romantic partner\nso they can see if you deny it.\nIf someone flirtily asks if you're single,\nor tries to find out if you are,\nthey're doing this likely\nbecause they want you\nto no longer be single,\nif you know what I mean,\nbecause, you know, they wanna date you.\n(narrator chuckling)\n(screen beeping)\nAnyways, watch out for any awkwardness\nwhen they try to hint at\nyour relationship status.\nThey could be nervous to ask you\nor look out for any\nsigns of flirting as well\nwhen they bring up the subject.\nNumber three, tell me more about yourself.\nOr they eagerly try to get\nto know you emotionally or personally.\nFriends wanna get\nto know their friends\npersonally and emotionally\nbut have you noticed a new\nacquaintance eagerly trying\nto get to know you on\na more personal level?\nMaybe you have a bit of\nsmall talk with them,\nmaybe they flirt a little too\nbut they're really interested\nin the deeper conversations\nand getting to know you.\nThey keep up the conversation\nby asking follow-up questions,\nand reveal personal things\nabout themselves too.\nBeing vulnerable and open with you.\nThis could mean they not\nonly find you attractive\nbut really like you.\nThey probably wanna jump right in\nto getting to know you\nbecause they feel a serious connection\nor admire your personality as well.\nNumber four, do you believe\nin love at first sight?\nHave you ever been asked by someone\nif you believe in love at first sight?\nWell, do you?\nIf you're asked this by someone\nand their tone strays\naway from friendliness,\nlying somewhere between\nplayfulness and seriousness,\nthen they could be flirting with you.\nDo they look deep into your eyes?\nSuddenly touch your hand?\nGive you a good old wink?\nWell, they don't need to\ndo that to flirt with you\nbut it would give you a clear idea\nof whether or not they\nwere flirting with you.\nAnd number five, where do\nyou wanna go on a date?\nOr they ask you out.\nMhm, you don't say?\n(character whistling)\nHas someone been asking you\na few of these questions?\nMaybe they've even flirted with you.\nAnd then they ask you about\nyour date preferences.\nOdds are they may be trying\nto see whether you like them\nbefore making a full move\ntowards asking you out.\nThey're trying to give you a hint\nand see where you'd like to go on a date\nso they can ask you on that\nperfect date you described.\nOr maybe they have\nasked you out on a date.\nYeah. Mhm.\nI'm gonna guess they're attracted to you.\nThe question now is do you wanna go out\non that date with them?\nSo has someone asked you\nthese questions before?\nHave you asked anyone\nelse these questions?\nOr will you ask your\ncrush these questions now?\nDo you believe in love at first sight?\nNo, I'm not flirting with you\nbut here at Psych2Go,\nwe do appreciate our Psych2Goers.\nWe really like you, friend.\nHad to let them down easy.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video\nand if you did, don't forget\nto click the Like button\nand share it with someone,\na friend, family member or a crush.\nAsk them a question too.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for watching."
