    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you have a feeling\nthat something is wrong\nin your relationship or\nin a potential partner?\nSomething just seems off.\nPsychotherapist and sex\ntherapist Dulcinea Pitagora\nnoted in an article from the \"SELF\"\nthat red flags in a relationship\ncan be noticed first\nas simply feelings.\nHer tip: to pay attention to your body.\nWhat sensations are you\nfeeling when you're deciding\nif something is a red flag?\nIs your heart rate increasing?\nDo you feel nervous in a negative way?\nShe explained to \"SELF\"\nthat it's enough to know\nthat something doesn't feel\nright and needs to change.\nBut what if there are\nsome red flags you missed?\nTo help you out, here are\nfive relationship red flags\nthat therapists often warn about.\nNumber one: they criticize you,\nsubtly or passive aggressively.\nDoes your date or partner\nsubtly criticize you?\nAre they passive aggressive with you\nor maybe they aren't subtle at all?\nCriticizing a partner is a red flag.\nIf you notice this early on,\nit's best to think again on if\nthis person is right for you.\nLicensed marriage and family\ntherapist at Choosing Therapy,\nSamara Quintero, told\n\"Insider\" that this is a form\nof emotional abuse that\ncan lead to feelings\nof anxiety and insecurity\nin the partnership.\nQuintero gave \"Insider\" some examples\nof these frequent put downs\nand criticisms including:\nyou're lucky I'm still with you\nbecause you'll never do better than me.\nAnd, you sound so ridiculous\nwhen you try to be funny.\n\"Insider\" even mentioned\na 2013 study published\nin the journal of \"Violence and Victims\".\nThe study proposed that the\neffects of emotional abuse\nare just as detrimental as\nthe effects of physical abuse.\nNumber two: they're rude\nto staff and waiters.\nHow does your date\ntreat waiters and staff?\nPay attention on your\nnext date at a restaurant.\nDating coach and couples\ncounselor, Dr. Gina Senarighi\nexplain to SELF magazine\nthat how they treat\nservice industry workers\nwill give you some insight\non their opinion on social structure.\nIt can also show you\ntheir sense of entitlement\nand give you a look into\nhow they treat others\nwhen they're in a position of power.\nIf they're rude to them, then\nyou now have a lot more info\ninto what kind of person they really are.\nAccording to statistics,\nonly a small percentage\nof you who watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nSo if you haven't and\nat the end of the video\nyou enjoy what you see\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nNumber three: they're\nirresponsible and immature.\nIs your date or partner often\nirresponsible, immature?\nIrresponsible partners may find themselves\nin many crises each day\nbecause of their actions or immaturity.\nAccording to psychiatrists,\nDr. Abigail Brenner\nin her \"Psychology Today\" article,\nsmall crises surrounding the\nway they live their daily life\nmay take up a lot of time and energy.\nIf so, there may be little\ntime and energy left\nfor you and your issues.\nThese people may still\nbe working on growing up.\nIn other words, it may\nbe hard to rely on them\nfor almost anything.\nSo while you may be there\nfor them a lot of the time,\nthey often won't be responsible enough\nor have much energy to give\nyou the things you need\nin a relationship,\npossibly time and energy.\nNumber four: they describe every\none of their exes as crazy.\nHave you ever found out\nyour partner was lying\nor maybe you've already discovered\nif you small lies from your date?\nLying is a common relationship red flag.\nTherapist, Samara Quintero\nexplained in an article\nfrom \"Insider\" that we are all\nguilty of telling white lies.\nHowever, if you notice\nthat your partner is\nconsistently deceiving\nor getting caught in\nlies, it's a red flag.\nWhat's a relationship\nwithout trust, anyway.\nLittle lies add up.\nAnd if there are small lies,\nthere could be big ones as well.\nNumber five: they don't\ncommunicate with you\nor express how they feel\nin the relationship.\nDo you notice that you're the only one\neffectively communicating\nin the relationship?\nBeing honest and communicating early on\nwill only benefit your relationship.\nTherapist Samara Quintero\nalso mentioned to \"Insider\"\nthat a healthy relationship\nprovides a safe place\nfor both partners to speak\nopenly on their emotions\nwithout fear of judgment or criticism.\nWe mentioned passive aggressiveness before\nand harsh criticisms.\nThese two can be signs\nof poor communication in a relationship.\nCommunication is key, people.\nSo make sure both you and your\npartner are both expressing\nhow you really feel in the relationship\nand talking about what you\nwant and need from each other.\nIf they're not communicating\neven after you've mentioned your concerns,\nthis is likely another\nrelationship red flag.\nIf you've noticed many of these red flags,\nit's best to reconsider your relationship\nand not ignore the red flag warnings.\nSo did you notice any of these red flags\nin your relationship, in\nyour partner or yourself?\nfeel free to share with\nus in the comments
