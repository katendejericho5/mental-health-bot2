    "transcript": "- [Narrator] There's been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we are so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks so much for being\na part of our journey.\nDo you have a toxic family and\nyou're not sure what to do?\nHaving a toxic family\nmember can be detrimental,\nbecause family is supposed to be defined\nby love and support.\nThis is a betrayal of the highest order,\nand something, if left untreated,\nthat will haunt someone for\nthe rest of their lives.\nIt's difficult to even admit\na family member is toxic,\nand the treatment isn't easy.\nAlthough we do recommend reaching out\nto a professional for help,\nhere are a few tips to ponder\nwhile you decide what to do.\nNumber one: make clear\nboundaries for yourself.\nWe know that it sounds simple\nto say, hey I like this,\nand I don't like that,\nand you're right, it does\nseem straightforward,\nso why does this toxic person continue\nto be able to cross those boundaries?\nIt might be that, due to\nfear, being worn down,\nor not realizing that it's happening,\nyou haven't made the boundaries clear.\nThe problem with toxic\nfamily members is not only\nthat they know you well,\nbut they exercise that knowledge\nregularly to get at you.\nThey know where all the thin spots are.\nClarifying a boundary is like\nadding an extra fortification,\nor making your house out\nof brick rather than straw,\nand filling in all the gaps.\nSo you need to be super\nclear with yourself\non not only what your\nboundaries are, but why.\nGive it some backup.\nKnow that your own limit is\nbecause toxic people will\noverstep that boundary repeatedly,\nso you'll need to determine for yourself\nhow much you'll put up with\nbefore you know it's time to walk.\nThey might rush you before the\ncement has been set properly,\nso don't worry about\nfailing the first few times.\nWith practice, you'll be\nable to hold your own.\nThese boundaries will\nalso help to remind you\nthat you have not only\nthe need but the right\nto protect yourself from these attacks.\nThis means when you cut a call off\nfrom your body-shaming\nmother or block the number\nto that sibling who keeps cursing at you\nor demeaning your life,\nyou can understand that\nit's right for you.\nYou've had enough.\nNumber two: distance.\nWe mean either emotionally or physically.\nBecause physically isn't\nalways realistically possible,\nemotional distance involves cutting off\nthe gifts you've been giving.\nWhat gifts, you ask.\nThe gift of you,\nthe gift of knowing anything\nmeaningful about you,\nlike your interests, goals,\nsecrets, or memories.\nThose were things you\npreviously shared with them,\nand they responded by repeatedly,\nmaliciously using that\ninformation to hurt you.\nThey have proven themselves undeserving,\nso you get to stop the flow.\nIt's okay to say you don't wish\nto talk on a subject, or\nnot answer a question.\nIf you must speak with them,\nyou can have cordial contact,\nalso known as keeping\nthem at an arms' length.\nThis is where conversations\nand emotions are purposefully\nsuperficial, pleasant,\nand all about them,\nsince toxic people are usually\nall about themselves anyhow.\nYou can remind yourself this\nis being done on purpose\nfor your own protection and sanity.\nYou're not giving in to them.\nIf possible, you can have low contact,\nwhere you interact only at\nlarge occasions like weddings.\nThen there's also no contact,\nwhen even low contact\nhas become unbearable.\nSo don't worry about,\nwhat if they've changed?\nOnce toxic family members\ncatch on to what's happening,\nthey'll redouble their efforts\nto force poison down your throat,\nletting you know that nothing has changed.\nIn fact, they're worse than before.\nThe most important thing to\nremember in all of this is\nthat it's not your fault\nthat they did this to you,\ndespite what they're screaming at you.\nTheir repeated abuse,\ndespite all your efforts\nto appease them or talk to them,\nis effectively a foot\nshoving you against the exit,\nso take the exit and let them deal\nwith the outcome themselves.\nNumber three: don't argue or justify.\nYou know the drill.\nIt's been a blissful week of peace\nfrom that condescending,\ngaslighting family member,\nbut then a call or email will come,\nand it'll be something that\nseems to require a conversation.\nSo you, being compassionate,\nask them what's going on,\nand it devolves into drama and arguments.\nAlert: you might wanna fight back\nand provide proof to support yourself.\nAdmiral Ackbar says, \"It's a trap.\"\nOh yeah, he knew what was up.\nThis toxic family member has reeled you in\nto a staged argument they know\nand will ensure you can't win.\nTheir goal is to make you feel low,\nso they can proclaim superiority.\nBattles need to be chosen carefully.\nDetermine what arguments\nand battles are actually\nfor real need to go to war,\nand which ones are drama and\nself-made pseudo emergencies.\nThese emergencies are false\nand solvable by themselves,\nbut they wanna feel the power\npuppeteering you to their bidding.\nIt's okay to decline being suckered in.\nYou can then conserve your energy\nfor other things, like your own life.\nNumber four: hold strong to yourself.\nYou need to be your own\nanchor and lighthouse.\nHaving that strong, solid\nsense of self means accepting\nand understanding that no one,\nincluding yourself, is perfect,\nand that you still know who you are,\nregardless of snags along the way.\nWe understand you can feel shame or guilt,\nbut knowing yourself lets\nyou know what to do about it,\nor even if it's warranted.\nDid you purposefully and consciously act\nwith malicious intent?\nWhen it comes to that toxic family member,\nchances are pretty good that you didn't.\nThere is nothing shameful or bad\nabout simply being yourself.\nYou do not need the approval\nof that toxic family member.\nMaybe ignore all of those\nwell done, son movies.\nYou only need the approval\nof yourself for yourself.\nAll those degrading, mean things said\nby toxic people are usually projections\nof their own shortcomings\nthat they aren't mature\nor wise enough to deal with.\nThey instead do the cheap, cowardly move,\nand dump it on others.\nTheir incompetence is not\nyour fault, nor your problem.\nThe rock that is you\nknows it doesn't matter\nthat a mistake happened.\nIt's not going to destroy you.\nIn fact, it lets you know where you get\nto uncover more knowledge.\nAnd number five: find support.\nNo man is an island, and\npeople work better together.\nHaving and building that support net\nto catch you is important, even necessary.\nThese are the people\nyou know you can lean on\nwhen your I toxic family's attempts\nto recapture you get hard.\nSupport can also come from\na therapist or program,\nas well as new friends who have nothing\nto do with your family.\nHealing and breaking away\nfrom abuse is a process that takes time.\nBe forgiving and patient with yourself.\nThis journey will have you\nlooking deep into your core,\nand more closely at others.\nA breakage needs to happen\nbefore you're able to start rebuilding,\nand you know you have\nthe strength to do it.\nNobody, including you, deserves abuse,\nand you are worthy of so much more.\nWhat other advice do you\nthink could be helpful?\nAre you trying any of\nthe tips we talked about?\nDiscuss and share in the comments.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you soon.\nTake care."
