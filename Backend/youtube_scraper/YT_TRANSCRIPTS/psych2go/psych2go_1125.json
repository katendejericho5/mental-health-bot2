    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\ndo you feel like there's\na growing distance\nbetween you and your friends?\nWhile no one is inherently a toxic person,\nyou can adapt and take on some behaviors\nthat make the people\naround you uncomfortable\nand sometimes even hurt.\nSo if you've ever wondered\nwhether your actions\nare causing your friends to push you away?\nThen here are six signs that\nyou might be a toxic friend.\nNumber one, you don't\nroot for their success.\nImagine your friends\nentering a competition,\nand it's their turn to show up on stage.\nAre you waiting to cheer them on,\nor do you feel insecure\nand bitter that it's\nthem onstage and not you?\nSometimes your feelings of\nenvy may manifest itself\ninto unintentional ways.\nYou may turn passive aggressive\ntowards them in resentment,\nor you may distance yourself from them\nout of shame or anxiety.\nHowever, even if you\nfeel upset or envious,\nknow that whatever negative\nfeeling you're feeling\nis a valid emotion.\nInstead of inflicting\ncriticism against yourself\nby fighting these emotions or\nallowing them to control you,\nembrace them and practice self compassion\ntowards yourself without judgment.\nThis way you'll learn to\ncope with the conflict\nand in turn, channel it\nin a more positive way.\nNumber two, you enable them.\nDo you ignore your friend's bad behavior\nor make excuses for them?\nIf you allow your friend to do\nharmful things to themselves\nor to the people around them,\nthen you may be a toxic friend.\nWhile it doesn't directly\ncreate an immediate impact.\nContinuously letting them get away\nwith self destructive behavior\ncan be harmful in the long term\nfor both themselves and\nthe people around them.\nInstead, you may wanna lend a helping hand\nand nudge them in the right direction.\nYou don't have to lecture\nthem if you don't want to,\nbut pointing them to the right resources\nwhile maintaining an honest\nand empathetic demeanor with them\ncan help them acknowledge their actions.\nNumber three, you never apologize.\nIs it hard for you to say sorry.\nEveryone makes mistakes.\nYou may unintentionally\nsay or do something\nthat makes the people around\nyou feel bad about themselves.\nBut if your response is to\ntell others to suck it up\nor not to worry about it,\nwithout considering how they feel,\nthen you're doing more harm\nthan good for your relationship.\nNo one's perfect.\nBut having humility and the\ncourage to admit your mistakes\nis a sign of genuine sincerity.\nA simple heartfelt sorry,\nat the right time can\nmake all the difference\nto wash away any repressed\ndynamics in a relationship.\nNumber four, you dismiss their emotions.\nDo you make fun of people when\nthey express their feelings?\nPerhaps you poke fun at them\nthrough derogatory comments\nor say snarky remarks that\ndiminish their emotions.\nFriendships founded on snarky jobs\nand light teas are fine and all,\nbut if a friend shows that\nthey're uncomfortable with it\nand you still do it,\nthen you're not being a good friend.\nThis also holds true in\nmore serious situations,\nwhere they ask for emotional support\nbut you try to shift the\nsubject into something else.\nBy doing this,\nyou're sending the message\nthat their feelings aren't\nimportant and are better unsaid.\nNumber five, you demand them\nto give more than you give.\nHow often do you call your for help,\nwhile friends are supposed\nto be there for each other.\nBeing overly needy can be taxing as well.\nBeing too needy\ncan stem from an anxious\nattachment personality style,\nand low self-confidence.\nSo growing out of it will\nrequire conscious effort.\nAside from open and honest\ncommunication with your friends.\nYou may also wanna talk\nto a professional about it\nsince they can teach you\nhow to learn to rely on\nand love yourself more,\nwhich can help you maintain\nhealthier relationships\nin the long run.\nAnd number six, you're arrogant.\nDo you gloat a lot about your success?\nThere's a difference between\nbeing happy about your\nachievements and being prideful.\nIf you're too arrogant,\nyou might cause your friend group\nto feel less secure in sharing their ideas\nand engaging with you.\nIt may even feel like\nthey're walking on eggshells around you,\nwhich is not good for either party.\nWhile there's no question\nthat staying true to\nyourself is important.\nStaying humble and\nopen-minded among your peers\nis also important to\nmaintain your relationships\nand to make yourself more\nlikable around others.\nSo do you think you're a toxic friend?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like subscribe\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks for watching.\nAnd we'll see you in the next video."
