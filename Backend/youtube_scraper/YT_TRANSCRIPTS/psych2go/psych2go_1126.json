    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey friends.\nWhat's the first thing that comes to mind\nwhen you hear the word sex?\nFor some, sexy time means\nfun, enjoyment, or love,\nbut for others, it's a trigger\nfor feelings of anxiety,\nuneasiness, and embarrassment.\nDo you feel uncomfortable\nwhen it comes to sex?\nAre you avoiding it\nor do you feel something's\nwrong when you're having sex?\nIf so, there's a possibility\nyou could be experiencing\nsexual repression.\nIf you're not sure, here are\nfive signs to look out for.\nNumber one.\nLack of interest in sex.\nDo you notice that you\nrarely think about sex?\nMaybe you seek other\nforms of physical contact,\nsuch as cuddling,\nkissing, or holding hands,\nbut having sex is just not on your mind.\nYou simply find it\nuninteresting and unappealing.\nLack of interest in sex could\nmean you are simply asexual,\nbut if you used to be\ninterested in it before\nand you don't find it appealing anymore,\nyou may be suppressing your sexuality.\nNumber two.\nFeelings of guilt and shame.\nDo you feel ashamed of your sexuality\nor maybe feel guilty\nif you think about sex?\nFor some people, guilt\nand shame around sex\nmake their sexual desire\ndiminish completely.\nIt could be that you grew up\nin a religious or strict household\nthat saw sex as something dirty and bad.\nIf so, your psyche is trying\nto suppress your urges\nas best as it can.\nYou may see it as a sin\nor think that you're a bad person\nfor having sexual thoughts.\nNot only do these feelings\nsuppress something in you\nthat is completely natural,\nbut they could also destroy\nyour romantic relationships.\nNumber three.\nInability to enjoy sex.\nSex should never be for reproduction.\nIf you choose to have sex,\nyou should enjoy it\nand feel good about it.\nBut if you are sexually repressed,\nyou may find it to be\neverything but enjoyable.\nYou may have trouble getting\nor staying sexually excited\nor maybe having an orgasm.\nThese problems could take a\ntoll on your mental health\nand even worsen your\nsymptoms of sexual repression\nbecause having sexual\nactivity you don't enjoy\ncould make you desire sex even less.\nNumber four.\nPhysical pain.\nAnother telltale sign of sexual\nrepression is physical pain.\nWhile it could be a sign\nof a medical problem,\npain in your abdomen or\ngenitals during intercourse\ncould mean sexual repression.\nIf it's accompanied by emotional problems\nor other signs mentioned,\nit's best to visit your physician\nto rule out other possible causes\nand possibly work on emotional problems\nthat are causing you pain.\nAnd number five, erotic dreams.\nWhile, usually, people\nhave zero desire for sex\nwhen they're experiencing\nsexual repression,\nthere may be a part of you\nthat wants to satisfy\nyour normal human urges.\nBut since the body and mind\ndon't agree on the matter,\nyour subconscious is working instead.\nThis can manifest in erotic dreams,\ndreams of flirting, passionately kissing,\nhaving sex, or experiencing orgasm.\nIf you can relate to any of these points,\nknow that these feelings\nare nothing to be ashamed of\nand it's certainly not your fault.\nEven if you feel alone,\nknow that sexual\nrepression is not uncommon\nand it's possible to get help.\nYou can talk to a sex therapist\nwho can help you find out the\nreasons behind your feelings.\nIt could be your upbringing,\ndifficulties accepting\nyour sexual orientation,\nor a trauma response.\nTalking about it and working\non resolving the issue\ncould help you regain your sexual energy\nand accept your body and your sexuality.\nCan you relate to this topic?\nLet us know in the comments below\nand share this video with\nothers who might benefit.\nAs always, the references and studies used\nare in the description below.\nUntil next time friends, take\ncare and thanks for watching."
