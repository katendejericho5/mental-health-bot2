    "transcript": "- [Narrator] How often do you check up\non your physical health\nversus your mental health?\nFor physical health, you\nknow what foods are better\nand that exercise is important, right?\nHowever, your mental health is\noften not greatly emphasized.\nYou may go about your daily life\nwithout really thinking too much\nabout how certain habits\naffect you mentally.\nHere are seven habits\nthat are endangering your mental health.\nAnd by the way, we have a treat for you\nat the end of this video\nif you wanna get more involved with us.\nNumber one, too much self deprecation\nand negative self-talk.\nSelf deprecating jokes\nseem to be the only way out\nof awkward situations, right?\nMaking such jokes about\nany aspect of yourself\nis often a nod towards low self-esteem\nor having a negative image of yourself.\nIt can be an unhealthy coping\nmechanism you fall back onto\nevery time you face an\nuncomfortable situation.\nAnother habit connected to this is fishing\nfor compliments by making\nnegative comments about yourself\nso that others can\ncompliment and validate you.\nPatricia Celan, a psychiatry resident\nat Dalhousie University\nexplains that making negative\ncomments about yourself\nserves to cement those beliefs\nand reinforces brain\npathways for negativity.\nNumber two, poor sleep.\nI'm late, I'm late, I'm late.\nWonderland's White Rabbit\nwas always in a hurry.\nHas this habit rubbed off on you too?\nDoes it feel like you have so much to do\nand not enough time to rest?\nYour piling tasks and responsibilities\ndon't allow for any downtime,\nin all this frenzy, you\nforget to get proper sleep.\nPoor sleep can result in being irritable,\nbecoming easily overwhelmed\nand having difficulty concentrating\nexplains Patricia Celan.\nShe states that for\npeople with mental illness\nor for those vulnerable\nto mental health issues,\nsleep deprivation can even\ntrigger a mental illness episode.\nNumber three, checking\nyour phone too much.\nSmartphones are basically a\npart of our hands now, right?\nYou use them for work, appointments,\nsocial media, connecting\nwith friends and family\nand checking the weather or news.\nHowever, according to the\nUniversity of Gothenburg,\nchecking your phone too\noften is also a cause\nfor mental distress, especially\nafter you've just woken up\nor before you go to bed.\nIt causes mood and sleep dysregulations.\nThis can also give you\na case of tech neck,\nwhich creates tension\nand can cause pain in\nyour neck and spine area.\nNumber four, procrastinating\nand disorganization.\nHave you heard that procrastination\nis the thief of time?\nNot only that, it also eats\naway at your mental health.\nIt's an avoidance strategy\nthat raises stress levels\nand lowers levels of wellbeing.\nChronic procrastination can also result\nin low self confidence, reduced energy\nand poor performance at work or at school.\nThis leads to poor mental\nhealth down the road.\nIt is a feeling of life passing\nyou by, says Forrest Talley,\na California based clinical psychologist.\nWhen you don't have a\ndaily routine or order,\nit provides hopelessness about your future\nand a lack of faith in yourself.\nWellness coach, Annie Michalski,\nexplains that creating\npredictability does wonders\nfor your mental health,\nas well as your physical\nand emotional health.\nNumber five, overspending\nand not having a budget.\nHow closely do you keep a budget?\nSpending money on things you\nenjoy once in a while is fun.\nAnd it's like a reward.\nHowever, overspending as a\nhabit is actually harmful\nto your mental and financial health.\nNot having a budget can spell disaster\nas it creates money related stress.\nClinical psychologist Derek Mihalcin\nexplains that we have\nthe ability to reduce\nor eliminate financial stress, but sadly,\nlive with the worry it creates every day.\nWe spend too much time\ntrying to justify our actions\ninstead of changing our habits.\nWhile living on a budget might\nnot be something you enjoy\nor want to do, it can have great benefits\nfor reducing stress about money.\nNumber six, not enough alone time.\nDo you make time to enjoy your hobbies?\nHow often do you hang out\nwith friends and family?\nIt's true, human beings do require\nhealthy amounts of social interaction\nand that amount is unique to everyone.\nThe threat to your mental health\nstarts when you're putting too much time\ninto being around people\ninstead of having time to be by yourself.\nOne of the benefits of being\nalone is listening to your body\nand using that time to\nreset and get more me time\nand to continue to discover\nand create your own identity.\nIt can be exhausting to be\naround people all the time.\nSo having a time where\nyou are fully yourself\nin your own space is extremely important.\nAnd number seven, worrying\ntoo much about being nice.\nDo you agree that kindness is a virtue\nthat the world can always use more of?\nIt's a balance between being generous\nand open whilst having boundaries\nand focusing on respect.\nA 2017 University of Oxford study\nshowed that kindness boosts happiness,\nnot only for the recipient\nbut for the giver.\nBut, there's always a but, right?\nWhen you start to think\ntoo much about being nice,\nit is harmful to your mental health.\nYes, that's because you're not operating\nfrom a place of genuine\nhonesty and kindness.\nYou are trying to be\nliked or going with a flow\nyou don't want to be going along with,\nyou worry too much about what people think\nand put their needs above\nyour wants and needs.\nIf you especially don't enjoy\nspending time with someone,\nlicensed health counselor, Don Friedman\nstates that it's not mean to\nlimit your time with them.\nWe're allowed to not like people\nand we don't owe them anything more\nthan basic human respect.\nWhile you can't change habits overnight,\nchallenging yourself to start\nwith just one can have a big impact\non your mental health going\nforward, keep doing your best.\nAnd don't forget to rest.\nThanks for sticking\nwith us to the very end,\nare you
