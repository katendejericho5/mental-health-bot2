    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Do you ever feel\nlike you don't fit in\nwith your own family?\nDo you feel constantly\nignored or criticized?\nYou might be the family scapegoat,\nit means that your own family\nuses you to unload their\nown frustration and anger.\nAre you constantly blamed for mistakes?\nSome of which aren't even yours,\ndo they call you names and\ntalk bad about you to others?\nBeing the family scapegoat\ncan really affect your\nbehavior and way of thinking.\nIt can make you think less of yourself\nand get lost in hatred for your family.\nSo if you want to know healthy\nmethods to cope with it\nand possible reasons why\nyour family does this,\nkeep watching.\nNumber one, they treat you like\na metaphorical punching bag.\nDo you get blamed for a lot of things,\neven the ones that aren't your fault?\nLet's say your parent just\ngot home in a bad mood,\nand they're often yelling at you\nor scolding you for things\nthat are unnecessary,\nbeing in a dysfunctional\nenvironment like this\ncan certainly take a toll\non your physical and mental health.\nThat's why if you find that\nyou're currently stuck in this situation,\ndon't hesitate to ask for help,\nkeep in touch with supportive friends\nor distant relatives and let\nthem know how you're doing.\nIt's not good to keep everything\ninside or harbor grudges.\nNumber two, they talk bad\nabout you to other people.\nHave you ever had a family member\nbad mouth you in front\nof friends or guests?\nIt certainly doesn't feel great,\nand chances are the words\nstill ring clear in your head until now.\nThis situation usually happens\nwhen you're raised by\nnarcissistic parents,\nbecause they want you to\nappear perfect to other people\nand they'll distance themselves\nfrom things that may\ndisrupt that illusion.\nBut think of it this way,\nit's a way of them saying,\nwell, I don't know why they're like that,\nall I know is that it's not related to me.\nThey may bring you down\njust to lift themselves up.\nThey can really make you\nfeel bad about yourself,\nbut please remember that it's never true\nand it's in no way your fault.\nRemember to talk about your feelings\nto those who really care and\ntry to engage in activities\nthat make you feel good about yourself.\nMost of the time, their own actions\nare a reflection of\ntheir internal battles.\nNumber three, they put a\ndamper on your achievements.\nDo you have times when you just\nreally wanna be recognized\nby your own family?\nIf you often have those kind of thoughts,\nit probably means that you\naren't being appreciated enough.\nYou probably think, well,\nI'm not doing well enough,\nI should do more,\nor maybe they won't recognize\nme no matter what I do,\nmight as well, just not do anything.\nAll those things are not true.\nYou don't have to do something big\nto get the recognition you deserve,\neach human leads different lives\nand is capable of\ntotally different things.\nEveryone goes at a different pace.\nSo take this as a reminder\nto tell yourself that you are doing great.\nYou may think that what\nyou're doing is insignificant,\nbut another person is looking up to you\nsomewhere in this world.\nSo whenever you notice\nthat your own family\ntends to downplay your attainments,\ntake it as a probable mark\nof their own insecurity.\nPerhaps they set super high\nstandards for themselves\nand other people, perhaps they're in pain\nand putting you down\nmakes them feel better.\nIt doesn't excuse their actions,\nbut it does give insight\ninto their perspective.\nNumber four, they project\ntheir own mistakes onto you.\nHave you ever had a\nfamily member yell at you\nfor an error they personally made?\nMost of the time these things happen\nbecause they're angry or irritated\nand you are within the firing\nrange of their emotions.\nThey don't know how to cope\nwith the sudden burst of anger\nso they let it out\nusing detrimental means.\nTry to keep in mind that\nwhenever this happens,\nit's best to let them cool off,\nlet some distance between you two\nand be careful not to engage\nwith them in their state,\nfighting won't solve the problem.\nA family member may also act this way\nbecause they're not comfortable\nwith a certain aspect of you.\nThey feel inclined to blame\neverything on you out of prejudice.\nYou are not the problem here.\nFirst accept that what they're\nsaying about you is not true,\nyou are a wonderful person.\nNext, understand that every person\nfaces battles of their own.\nAfter you've learned to accept yourself,\nit's likely time to accept\nthat your family members\nare flawed people too.\nHow they treat you says more\nabout them than about you.\nNumber five, they blatantly ignore you.\nDo you ever notice your family members\ngoing out of their way to\npretend you don't exist?\nPerhaps they don't invite you to dinners\nor ask for your opinions on matters,\nwhatever it is they're\noutright blocking you out.\nFamily members do this\nfor a number of reasons.\nOne is that they know they've\ndone something wrong to you\nand want to avoid possible confrontation,\nanother is that they're afraid\nyou'll talk about their abusive behavior\nto people outside of the household.\nThey might see something in you\nthat they don't like to look at.\nBasically anything that\ntriggers their own insecurity\nor discriminatory tendencies.\nIt's really important to remember that\njust because your family avoids you\ndoesn't mean you're not worthy\nof any attention at all.\nSometimes it's good to reach out\nto an external support system.\nLet yourself enjoy life\nwith people who love you\nand make you feel seen.\nAnd number six, they treat\nyou differently from others.\nAre you always being compared\nto a sibling or a cousin?\nEnforcing ranks or hierarchy\nsystems on family members\nis toxic for everyone involved.\nFor example, as a scapegoat,\nyou are often being talked down to\nin order to make the golden child shine.\nBeing continuously subjected\nto that sort of environment can hurt you,\ndamage your self esteem\nand at the same time,\ncause unnecessary pressure for\nthe other family member too.\nThey probably have thoughts\nlike I have to do better,\nI have to do more, I should\nnever make a mistake.\nThey become scared to make mistakes\nwhile you feel discouraged\nto take on challenges.\nAll it breeds is unhealthy competition,\ncontempt and toxic perfectionism.\nMost of the time, these situations\nstem from narcissistic parenthood.\nBecause of their need to seem perfect\nand have a perfect family,\nthey push their children to be more\nwithout noticing that they're\npast their breaking point.\nHave you ever noticed that\nyou are too competitive\nor perhaps that you don't\neven bother to compete at all?\nYour current behavior is\nusually heavily influenced\nby how you were treated as a child,\nbut the important thing\nis that you're here now\nand you're doing great.\nDo you think you are the family scapegoat?\nWhy, which points do\nyou relate to the most?\nThere are many reasons why family members\nwould treat you this way.\nMental conditions, insecurities\nand discriminatory\ntendencies are just some,\nit doesn't excuse their behavior,\nbut it helps to get an\ninsight into the root cause,\ntry not to combat hate with hate,\nthere are times when it's quite difficult\nto be the bigger person and move on,\nbut try to accept their hurtful behavior\nas a sign of their own pain and let it go.\nThat doesn't mean you\nhave to forgive them,\nbut it also doesn't mean that you need\nto constantly be tied\ndown by their actions\nor your own anger.\nShare your experiences in\nthe comments down below.\nIf you know someone who might\ngain something from this,\nplease don't hesitate to send it to them.\nAs always all references used\nare in the description below.\nSee you next time."
