    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhat would you say\nabout your intelligence?\nAs you'll soon learn,\nintelligence is not\nalways about being able\nto memorize huge books of definitions,\nsolving quantum physics equations,\nor multiplying big numbers in your head.\nBeing smart can mean a lot of things.\nAnd even if you don't think so,\nyou're probably much\nsmarter than you think.\nIf you're interested to\nlearn more, keep watching.\nNumber one, you're highly creative.\nDo you feel like you\nhave an artistic soul?\nMaybe you like to paint,\nplay an instrument, dance?\nNo matter your preferred art\nform, if you're creative,\nyou're most likely intelligent, too.\nFor a long time,\npsychologist have considered creativity\nto be a form of intelligence.\nAnd even though research has shown\nthat intelligent people\naren't necessarily creative,\nthe opposite is usually true.\nThe ones who are creative\nare also intelligent.\nThis is because creativity is also\nabout thinking outside the box,\nfinding new solutions for problems,\nhaving a different perspective,\nand these are all traits\nthat intelligent people have.\nNumber two, your room is a bit messy.\nHave you ever heard of\nthe term creative mess?\nAs it turns out, that's\nactually backed by research.\nWorking in a cluttered and messy room\ncan actually spark\ncreativity for some people,\nand since we know creativity goes hand\nin hand with intelligence,\nyou could say that your creative mess\nactually shows off how clever you are.\nSo if someone complains\nabout the state of your room,\ntell them you're\njust sparking your\ncreativity and innovation.\nNumber three, you have smart friends.\nPeople say like attracts like,\nand when it comes to\nintelligence, this might be true.\nWhen we choose our friends or partners,\nwe usually tend to hang out\nwith those who we have\nsomething in common with.\nOf course, this doesn't\nmean that we want them\nto be 100% the same as we are,\nbut we need some common ground\nto have something to talk about.\nThink about the people you hang out with.\nDo you think they're smart and talented?\nIf the answer is yes,\nyou're probably just as smart as them.\nThink about it.\nIf they were above your level,\nyou would probably feel\nbored in their company.\nMaybe you wouldn't understand them,\nor you wouldn't know how\nto even start a meaningful\nconversation with them,\nbut because you're all such a smart group,\nyou're able to connect on a deeper level.\nNumber four, you're empathetic.\nDo you care about other people deeply?\nDo you always try to\nsee their perspective?\nAnd can you feel their pain\nif someone close to you is hurting?\nIf you think that description suits you,\nyou probably have high empathy\nand emotional intelligence,\ncommonly known as EQ.\nEmotional intelligence is\nan important aspect of intelligence.\nIt's the ability to understand emotions\nand express them in ways that\nare healthy and productive.\nBeing empathetic, a key component\nof emotional intelligence means\nthat you can see things from\nsomeone else's point of view.\nIt means that you can see\nif someone is struggling.\nYou have no problem reading\ntheir subtle body language cues.\nIt means you're deeply accepting\nof everyone around you,\nand you have no problem\nunderstanding their experiences.\nNumber five, you want to know everything.\nYou've heard of IQ, intelligence quotient,\nbut have you heard of CQ?\nCuriosity quotient represents your desire\nand motivation to learn new things,\nand it's been shown that\nthe more curious you are,\nthe more intelligent you probably are.\nBut why is that?\nIt could be that curious\npeople feed their curiosity\nby investing a lot of time and\neffort researching new things\nand learning as much as they can.\nAlso, they are more likely to\ncome up with original ideas,\nwhich helps them solve\nproblems more effectively.\nSo if you love to learn new things\nabout the world around you,\nyou're probably much\nsmarter than you think.\nAnd number six, you don't\nthink you're very smart.\nYou know that one person who just loves\nto boast and tell everyone\nhow smart they are,\nand at the same time,\nthere's this other person\nwho is clearly clever\nbut has a low opinion\nabout their intelligence?\nThis is known as the\nDunning-Kruger effect,\na cognitive bias that\nmakes people overestimate\nor underestimate their intelligence.\nIt has been shown by research that people\nwho are more intellectually\ngifted hold more realistic\nand grounded views of themselves.\nThey know how much there is to learn,\nand they recognize\nintelligence in other people.\nBecause they know this,\nthey spend their time seeking knowledge.\nThis makes them feel like\nthey're not really smart,\nbut it's exactly what makes\nthem smart in the first place.\nSo did you relate to any of\nthe things we mentioned here?\nIt's always so easy to think\nthe worst about ourselves\nor to simply disregard all the\nnice things others tell us,\nbut there's really no reason for you\nto think you're not smart.\nIntelligence is a very, very wide concept.\nSo wide that even today psychologists\nare still researching it\nand finding out new\nthings about it every day.\nThe one thing they do agree on is\nthat you can be intelligent\nin many different ways.\nYou don't have to be\nEinstein to be intelligent.\nAnd if you allow yourself to see that,\nyou'll be able to fulfill\nyour potential even further.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nlike and share it with friends\nthat might find insight in this too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the sources used are added\nin the description box
