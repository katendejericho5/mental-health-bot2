    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hi, Psych2Goers!\nSo it looks like you like someone\nand you're scanning through your brain\nfor possible ideas on how\nto make them notice you.\nSo far, you've come up with\nnothing.\nSo you think, \"Are there\nsome little things I can do\nto get them to notice me a bit more?\"\nWhether they're a crush, a partner,\nor even a friend,\nhere are six subtle behaviors\nto make people notice you\nand like you more.\nNumber one, don't be afraid\nto talk about your flaws.\nEver heard of the Prattfall Effect?\nThis is a psychological phenomenon\nthat states that if you\nare seen as very competent,\nmaking a mistake or small\nblunder makes you more likable\nthan those other very competent people\nwho don't show their mistakes or flaws.\nPeople can sometimes be intimidated\nby people who seem as\nif they have no flaws,\nso it's not a bad thing\nif you do show your flaws once in a while.\nNumber two, keep their secrets\nand share one of yours.\nDo you keep secrets\nor are you horrible at keeping them?\nA 2009 study by researchers\nCatherine A. Cottrell,\nSteven L. Neuberg, and Norman P. Li\nfound that people greatly\nvalued trustworthiness\nin their relationships.\nThe study states,\n\"Across different measures\nof trait importance\nand different groups and relationships,\ntrustworthiness was\nconsidered extremely important\nfor all interdependent others;\nthe evidence for the enhanced\nimportance of cooperativeness\nacross different interdependent context\nwas more equivocal.\"\nTrust is a big deal in a relationship\nso you might as well show your crush,\nyour relationship material\nby keeping their secrets.\nOne way you can show you\ntrust someone early on\nis to tell them a small secret of yours.\nThis may just bring you closer.\nNumber three, mirror your\npartner's gestures and behavior.\nSo you're at a party\nand you suddenly find yourself\nsubconsciously mimicking\nthe gestures and movements\nof the person you're talking to,\nwhat's going on?\nThis instance is called\nthe Chameleon Effect\nand was explored in further studies.\nIf you're often subconsciously mirroring\nyour crushes gestures and movements,\nthis could make your\ncrush like you a bit more.\nWhy?\nPeople tend to like\npeople who are like them.\nThe next question is,\ndo you notice them mirroring you?\nNumber four, show them you like them.\nAre you afraid that your friends\nwill reveal your true\nfeelings to your crush?\nWell, your crush finding out\ncan often be a good thing.\nWhy?\nBecause of reciprocity of attraction\nor sometimes known as reciprocal liking.\nThis is a psychological\nterm used to describe\nwhen one person starts to\nfeel attraction for someone\nonly after hearing that\nindividual likes them.\nA 1959 study published\nin \"Human Relations\"\ntold their group subjects\nthat certain individuals in their group\nwould likely like them.\nAfter group discussions,\nsubjects told researchers\nwho they liked the most.\nCan you guess who they liked?\nYou guessed it right!\nThe subjects chose the people\nthey were told initially liked them.\nSo if you like someone\nand wanna be friends,\nor perhaps more than friends,\nlet them know you like them.\nThis may get them to\nstart thinking of you more\nand then they may just like you back.\nNumber five, start deep conversations\nand sometimes paraphrase\nwhat you understood.\nDo you hate small talk?\nWell then, don't shy away\nfrom starting some deep\nconversations with your crush.\nResearch from Harvard found\nthat deep conversations\nand meaningfully talking about yourself\ncan help activate the very\nsame regions of your brain\nthat delicious food or sex activates.\nThe study states that\nover a 45-minute period,\nsubject pairs carried out self-disclosure\nand relationship building tasks\nthat gradually escalated in intensity.\nStudy 1 found greater\npost-interaction closeness\nwith these tasks\nversus comparable small talk tasks.\nSo while small talk is\nfine every now and then,\nwhen you're on a romantic date\nor speaking with your crush,\na more meaningful discussion\nmay excite them more.\nWhen you both open up and\nreveal your true emotions,\nyour partner may fall in love\nwith the deep, engaging conversations\nyou have together instead.\nActively listening is often\nseen as attractive as well.\nRemember, it can't just be\nyou talking on first date.\nA good way to show them\nyou're actively listening\nand that you understand them\nis by paraphrasing what they've told you,\nrepeat it back to them.\nThis is known as reflective listening.\nSo actively listen\nand then offer what you understood\nfrom their discussion back to them.\nIt's a great way to show\nyou empathize with them\nand it can bring you closer.\nFindings from a 2007 research study\npublished in the \"American\nJournal of Psychotherapy\"\nfurthered this theory.\nThe studies have found\nthat when therapists use\nreflective listening,\ntheir patients had a higher chance\nof disclosing more information\nabout their emotions\nand their therapeutic relationship\nwith their therapist improved.\nNot only is it good for\nyour romantic relationships\nbut it's good for any\ntype of relationships.\nSimply put, it brings\npeople closer together.\nAnd number six, display open body language\nand build your confidence,\nthen show it.\nDo you show your confidence when you can?\nIt's great to have confidence\nin yourself for many reasons\nand it can often help when\ngetting to know others as well.\nPerhaps, you've heard\nthat confidence is key.\nWell, showing some confidence\ncan indeed be important\nwhen getting others to\nnotice you romantically.\nDisplaying confident behavior\nis often seen as an attractive quality.\nWhy?\nWell, generally, people wanna be confident\nso seeing someone who is can be admirable.\nOne way you can seem more confident\nis if you display open body language.\nKeep your chest and torso open\nand try not to cross your arms as much.\nClosed body language can\ngive off the impression\nyou aren't available\nor simply don't want to talk.\nAvailability is key in making friends\nand simply giving others\na chance to talk with you.\nSo that crush of yours,\nif they notice you look\napproachable and welcoming,\nthey may just have an easier time\nintroducing themselves to you.\nThere has been a huge\ndecline in mental health\naround the world\nwhich is why we are so
