    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nHave you ever heard the\nterm gaslighting before\nand wondered what it means?\nSimply put, it is abuse\nand a form of manipulation\nand psychological control.\nVictims are fed lies and false information\nunder the guise of truth,\nwhich makes them question\ntheir sanity and beliefs.\nOver time, the manipulations\nbecome so complex\nthat the victim can no\nlonger identify what's real.\nHere are some common phrases\nan abusive person might\nuse to control you.\nNumber one, \"You are so sensitive.\"\nIf you hear this one, calmly\ndisengage from the conversation\nand acknowledge that you\nare not too sensitive.\nAn abusive person resorts to this line\nto make themselves not\naccountable for their actions.\nAdditionally, this statement\nminimizes your feelings\nby making you think\nthat your feelings are\ninappropriate or wrong,\nso you end up feeling guilty.\nNumber two, \"I was just joking.\"\nYou have probably heard this phrase,\nespecially when someone says\nsomething deliberately cruel.\nThis is the classic backpedaling remark.\nAgain, it's a way to remove accountability\nfor their actions, it also\nserves to downplay your emotions\nand make you feel bad about\ncalling out their behavior.\nThey use this phrase to try\nto normalize cruel comments.\nNumber three, \"It's no big deal.\"\nThis statement is another\ntactic manipulators often use\nto deny wrongdoing.\nLike the previous statement,\nthis also tries to normalize\ncruelty and verbal violence\nby trivializing their abuse\nand minimizing your pain.\nIt is also a blatant attempt\nto shrink responsibility on\nthemselves and put it onto you,\nmaking you responsible\nfor misunderstanding them,\nit's aimed at making you\nfeel unseen and unimportant.\nNumber four, \"You're imagining things.\"\nThis is another classic\ngaslighting phrase,\nit's perhaps the only phrase\nthat comes directly from the film.\nThe purpose is to discredit you\nand make you doubt your sanity.\nThis is effective,\nbecause it makes others\nside with your abuser\nand reinforces the statement.\nWhat makes it particularly nefarious\nis it's often sugarcoated\nwith concern and worry.\nYour abuser may approach\nyou and express concern\nwhile also dismissing your emotions.\nThey may say, \"I'm only telling you this,\nbecause I'm worried about you.\"\nOr something similar.\nWhen this is expressed as a concern,\nit makes it harder to\nsee the manipulation.\nAnd number five, \"I'm sorry\nthat you think that I hurt you.\"\nA common tactic that an abuser\nmight use is shifting blame,\nthis statement is an apt example.\nThe phrasing of this is clever,\nbecause it makes you think\nthe abuser is apologizing.\nIn reality, they're\nplacing the blame on you,\nthey're also making you feel\nlike you misinterpreted them\nor judged them unfairly\nand like you are the\ncause of the bad behavior\nor bad relationship.\nAs a result, your self-esteem suffers,\nmaking you more dependent on them.\nAbuse, verbal or otherwise,\nshould never have a place\nin your relationship.\nIf you see it or\nexperience it, call it out,\nlet the other person\nknow that it's not right.\nIf you are struggling with abuse,\nplease reach out to a\nlicensed medical professional\nfor help.\nHave you experienced gaslighting?\nLet us know in the comments below,\nand share this video with\nsomeone who might benefit.\nAs always, the references and studies used\nare listed in the description below.\nThanks for watching and take care.\nUntil next time."
