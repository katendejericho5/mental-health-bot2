    "transcript": "- [Narrator] There's been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks for being a part of our journey.\nHey you, Psych2goer's happy\nMental Health Awareness Month.\nIt's so important to\nhave a month dedicated\nto spreading awareness\nof medical conditions that can't be seen.\nWhen you think of depression\nwhat do you think of?\nBeing sad?\nThoughts related to death,\nunanswered calls or texts?\nThese are all very common\nand noticeable signs\nof depression, but did you know,\nthere are more subtle signs\nof depression that can\nfly under the radar?\nLet's check out seven signs of\ndepression that go unnoticed.\nNumber one, you toggle between emotions\ndepending on your surroundings.\nWhen we think of depression\nwe often think of being sad all the time\nbut did you know that that\nisn't always the case?\nA subtle sign of depression\nis when an individual\nflips between sadness and happiness\nbased on the scenario and setting.\nFor example you might\nbe sad when you're alone\nbut really happy when you're\nout with your friends.\nHaving people around or\nsomething to keep your mind off\nthe things allows for a bit of reprieve.\nThis can also be something\ncalled forced happiness,\nwhere the person feels inclined\nto put on a smile for others.\nA group of researchers found\nthat potential depression\nsufferers on Twitter\nchange the way they use language\nand interact on social media.\nYou may notice them sending\nyou more negative texts\nor posting darker posts on\ntheir social media accounts.\nBut when you hang out with them in person,\nthey're completely happy.\nThis online persona allows them to be\nand say what they want.\nNumber two, you notice\nchanges in your habits.\nThere's a certain stigma around\nstaying up late at night.\nWhen you see posts or texts from a friend\nin those early hours, you\nmay not think anything of it\nbut when you notice it more consistently\nthis could be caused for concern.\nOther habits that can be\ndisrupted can be eating,\nbathing, getting dressed\nand going to work school\nor other appointments.\nIgnoring these basic human needs\nis not caring for yourself.\nThen it could be a sign that\nthere are more things at play\nthan just being tired or feeling lazy.\nNumber three, you start\nblaming yourself for things\neven if it's not your fault.\nWhen you've done something,\nit's important to take\nresponsibility for it\nand hold yourself accountable.\nBut do you notice someone\napologizing for everything,\neven for things they didn't do?\nYou say I spilled juice on my shirt.\nThey say, sorry.\nYou say it's raining,\nI wanted to go running.\nThey say, sorry.\nThey didn't make you\nspill juice on your shirt.\nThey didn't make it rain\nand purposely ruin the day\nbut they feel like it's their fault.\nThis can even manifest as remembering\nor reliving an embarrassing memory\nand not moving on from it.\nEven having a feeling of guilt\ncan leave someone feeling depressed.\nNumber four, you're not\ndoing what you used to do.\nHave you noticed a certain friend\nhas declined a lot of your\ninvitations to hang out lately?\nDid you notice they're not going anywhere\nbesides work or school?\nMaybe there's a friend who\nstill shows up at their hobbies\nlike sports practice or music rehearsal\nbut has lost all enjoyment.\nThese are all signs of\npotential depression.\nWhen you're depressed,\nactivities that used to produce dopamine,\nthe feel good hormone,\ndon't react the same way\ncausing you to not feel that same joy.\nThis is another sign that can be paired\nwith toggling mentioned\nin the first point.\nThe individual may feel\nlike they need to match\ntheir previous high spirits\nand hide their new emotions\nso they don't bring the mood down.\nNumber five, you have\ndifficulty making decisions.\nWhen you ask your\nsignificant other to hang out\nit's nice to get some\ninput on what they wanna do\nor even leave the decision up to them.\nSomeone who may have depression\nmay not have any opinions on anything.\nIt can be as small as\nwhat to eat for dinner\nor more difficult like what to major in\nor deciding your budget.\nThis can mean the\nindividual doesn't feel like\nthey're good or smart enough\nto make the right decision.\nPushing away from making\ndecisions can be a good indicator\nof possible depression.\nNumber six, you're always on edge.\nIrritability is a common symptom\nof mental health conditions.\nBut how can you tell the difference?\nLet's say you're crushing on someone\nand your friend knows it.\nIf your friend starts\nflirting with your crush\nin front of you, this is a situation where\nbeing irritable is a valid\nand reasonable response\nbut say you have a\nroommate and one shared TV.\nYou wanna watch a movie after\nwork, but when you come home\nyour roommate is already\nwatching something\nwhich causes you to blow\nup at your roommate.\nThe reaction is out of\nproportion to the situation.\nSure, it's annoying that\nsomeone's watching TV\nbut it's something a simple\nconversation can solve.\nYou can ask your roommate\nif they would mind\nyou watching a movie\nafter they've finished.\nThat knee jerk reaction\nto get angry can be a sign\nof other mental health\nissues like depression.\nAnd number seven, you feel physical pain.\nHave you ever felt pain like\nmuscle ache or headache?\nAnd you have no idea where it came from?\nWhen you feel physical pains regularly,\nit's always a good idea to\nconsult a medical professional\nto determine if there are any\nunderlying reasons for them.\nIf nothing is found, it\nmay be a good next step\nto contact a trusted\nmental health provider.\nSo did any of these signs surprise you?\nHave you noticed these other signs\nof depression in yourself or a loved one?\nLet us know in the comments blow.\nIf you are someone you know is concerned\nthat they may be showing\nsigns of depression,\nplease consult a mental\nhealth professional.\nAnd if you found this video helpful\nplease share it with others.\nThe references and studies used are listed\nin the description below.\nUntil next time, take\ncare and see you soon."
